  <p>3 THE WILL TO POWER AS EXEMPLIFIED IN SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Society and the State.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>We take it as a principle that only individuals feel any responsibility. Corporations are invented to do what the individual has not the courage to do. For this reason all communities are vastly more upright and instructive, as regards the nature of man, than the individual who is too cowardly to have the courage of his own desires.</p>
<p>All altruism is the prudence of the private man. societies are not mutually altruistic. The commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy next-door neighbour,&rdquo; has never been extended to thy neighbour in general. Rather what Manu says is probably truer: &ldquo;We must conceive of all the States on our own frontier, and their allies, as being hostile, and for the same reason we must consider all of their neighbours as being friendly to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study of society is invaluable, because man in society is far more childlike than man individually. Society has never regarded virtue as anything else than as a means to strength, power, and order. Manu&rsquo;s words again are simple and dignified: &ldquo;Virtue could hardly rely on her own strength alone. Really it is only the fear of punishment that keeps men in their limits, and leaves every one in peaceful possession of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="717">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The State, or <em>unmorality</em> organised, is from within—the police, the penal code, status, commerce, and the family; and from without, the will to war, to power, to conquest and revenge.</p>
<p>A multitude will do things an individual will not, because of the division of responsibility, of command and execution; because the virtues of obedience, duty, patriotism, and local sentiment are all introduced; because feelings of pride, severity, strength, hate, and revenge in short, all typical traits are upheld, and these are characteristics utterly alien to the herd-man.</p>
<ol start="718">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t, any of you, the courage either to kill or to flog a man. But the huge machinery of the State quells the individual and makes him decline to be answerable for his own deed (obedience, loyalty, etc.).</p>
<p>Everything that a man does in the service of the State is against his own nature. Similarly, everything he learns in view of future service of the State. This result is obtained through division of labour (so that responsibility is subdivided too):—</p>
<p>The legislator—and he who fulfils the law.</p>
<p>The teacher of discipline—and those who have grown hard and severe under discipline.</p>
<ol start="719">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A division of labour among the emotions exists inside society, making individuals and classes produce an imperfect, but more useful, kind of soul. Observe how every type in society has become atrophied with regard to certain emotions with the view of fostering and accentuating other emotions.</p>
<p>Morality may be thus justified:—</p>
<p><em>Economically,</em>—as aiming at the greatest possible use of all individual power, with the view of preventing the waste of exceptional natures.</p>
<p><em>Æsthetically,</em>—as the formation of fixed types, and the pleasure in one&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p><em>Politically,</em>—as the art of bearing with the severe divergencies of the degrees of power in society.</p>
<p><em>Psychologically,</em> as an imaginary preference for the bungled and the mediocre, in order to preserve the weak.</p>
<ol start="720">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Man has one terrible and fundamental wish; he desires power, and this impulse, which is called freedom, must be the longest restrained. Hence ethics has instinctively aimed at such an education as shall restrain the desire for power; thus our morality slanders the would-be tyrant, and glorifies charity, patriotism, and the ambition of the herd.</p>
<ol start="721">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Impotence to power, how it disguises itself and plays the hypocrite, as obedience, subordination, the pride of duty and morality, submission, devotion, love (the idolisation and apotheosis of the commander is a kind of compensation, and indirect self-enhancement). It veils itself further under fatalism and resignation, objectivity, self-tyranny, stoicism, asceticism, self-abnegation, hallowing. Other disguises are: criticism, pessimism, indignation, susceptibility, beautiful soul, virtue, self—deification, philosophic detachment, freedom from contact with the world (the realisation of impotence disguises itself as disdain).</p>
<p>There is a universal need to exercise some kind of power, or to create for one&rsquo;s self the appearance of some power, if only temporarily, in the form of intoxication.</p>
<p>There are men who desire power simply for the sake of the happiness it will bring; these belong chiefly to political parties. Other men have the same yearning, even when power means visible disadvantages, the sacrifice of their happiness, and well-being; they are the ambitious. Other men, again, are only like dogs in a manger, and will have power only to prevent its falling into the hands of others on whom they would then be dependent.</p>
<ol start="722">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If there be justice and equality before the law, what would thereby be abolished?—Suspense, enmity, hatred. But it is a mistake to think that you thereby increase happiness; for the Corsicans rejoice in more happiness than the Continentals.</p>
<ol start="723">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Reciprocity and the expectation of a reward is one of the most seductive forms of the devaluation of mankind. It involves that equality which depreciates any gulf as immoral.</p>
<ol start="724">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Utility is entirely dependent upon the object to be attained,—the wherefore? And this wherefore, this purpose, is again dependent upon the degree of power. Utilitarianism is not, therefore, a fundamental doctrine; it is only a story of sequels, and cannot be made obligatory for all.</p>
<ol start="725">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Of old, the State was regarded theoretically as a utilitarian institution; it has now become so in a practical sense. The time of kings has gone by, because people are no longer worthy of them. They do not wish to see the symbol of their ideal in a king, but only a means to their own ends. That&rsquo;s the whole truth.</p>
<ol start="726">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I am trying to grasp the absolute sense of the communal standard of judgment and valuation, naturally without any intention of deducing morals.</p>
<p>The degree of psychological falsity and denseness required in order to sanctify the emotions essential to preservation and expansion of power, and to create a good conscience for them.</p>
<p>The degree of stupidity required in order that general rules and values may remain possible (including education, formation of culture, and training).</p>
<p>The degree of inquisitiveness, suspicion, and intolerance required in order to deal with exceptions, to suppress them as criminals, and thus to give them bad consciences, and to make them sick with their own singularity.</p>
<ol start="727">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Morality is essentially a shield, a means of defence; and, in so far, it is a sign of the imperfectly developed man (he is still in armour; he is still stoical).</p>
<p>The fully developed man is above all provided with <em>weapons:</em> he is a man who <em>attacks.</em></p>
<p>The weapons of war are converted into weapons of peace (out of scales and carapaces grow feathers and hair).</p>
<ol start="728">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The very notion, &ldquo;living organism&rdquo;, implies that there must be growth,—that there must be a striving after an extension of power, and therefore a process of absorption of other forces. Under the drowsiness brought on by moral narcotics, people speak of the right of the individual to <em>defend himself;</em> on the same principle one might speak of his right to <em>attack</em>: for <em>both</em>—and the latter more than the former—are necessities where all living organisms are concerned: aggressive and defensive egoism are not questions of choice or even of &ldquo;free will,&rdquo; but they are fatalities of life itself.</p>
<p>In this respect it is immaterial whether one have an individual, a living body, or &ldquo;an advancing society&rdquo; in view. The right to punish (or society&rsquo;s means of defence) has been arrived at only through a misuse of the word &ldquo;right&rdquo;: a right is acquired only by contract, but self-defence and self-preservation do not stand upon the basis of a contract. A people ought at least, with quite as much justification, to be able to regard its lust of power, either in arms, commerce, trade, or colonisation, as a right the right of growth, perhaps&hellip;. When the instincts of a society ultimately make it give up war and renounce conquest, it is decadent: it is ripe for democracy and the rule of shopkeepers. In the majority of cases, it is true, assurances of peace are merely stupefying draughts.</p>
<ol start="729">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The maintenance of the military State is the last means of adhering to the great tradition of the past; or, where it has been lost, to revive it. By means of it the superior or strong type of man is preserved, and all institutions and ideas which perpetuate enmity and order of rank in States, such as national feeling, protective tariffs, etc., may on that account seem justified.</p>
<ol start="730">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In order that a thing may last longer than a person (that is to say, in order that a work may outlive the individual who has created it), all manner of limitations and prejudices must be imposed upon people. But how? By means of love, reverence, gratitude towards the person who created the work, or by means of the thought that our ancestors fought for it, or by virtue of the feeling that the safety of our descendants will be secured if we uphold the work—for instance, the <em>polis.</em> Morality is essentially the means of; making something survive the individual, because it makes him of necessity a slave. Obviously the aspect from above is different from the aspect from below, and will lead to quite different interpretations. How is organised power <em>maintained</em>?—By the fact that countless generations sacrifice themselves to its cause.</p>
<ol start="731">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Marriage, property, speech, tradition, race, family, people, and State, are each links in a chain—separate parts which have a more or less high or low origin. Economically they are justified by the surplus derived from the advantages of uninterrupted work and multiple production, as weighed against the disadvantages of greater expense in barter and the difficulty of making things last. (The working parts are multiplied, and yet remain largely idle. Hence the cost of producing them is greater, and the cost of maintaining them by no means inconsiderable.) The advantage consists in avoiding interruption and incident loss. Nothing is more expensive than a start. &ldquo;The higher the standard of living, the greater will be the expense of maintenance, nourishment, and propagation, as also the risk and the probability of an utter fall on reaching the summit.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="732">
<li></li>

<p>In bourgeois marriages, naturally in the best sense of the word marriage, there is no question whatsoever of love any more than there is of money. For on love no institution can be founded. The whole matter consists in society giving leave to two persons to satisfy their sexual desires under conditions obviously designed to safeguard social order. Of course there must be a certain attraction between the parties and a vast amount of good nature, patience, compatibility, and charity in any such contract. But the word love should not be misused as regards such a union. For two lovers, in the real and strong meaning of the word, the satisfaction of sexual desire is unessential; it is a mere symbol. For the one side, as I have already said, it is a symbol of unqualified submission: for the other, a sign of condescension—a sign of the appropriation of property. Marriage, as understood by the real old nobility, meant the breeding forth of the race (but are there any nobles nowadays? <em>Quaeritur</em>),—that is to say, the maintenance of a fixed definite type of ruler, for which object husband and wife were sacrificed. Naturally the first consideration here had nothing to do with love; on the contrary! It did not even presuppose that mutual sympathy which is the <em>sine qua non</em> of the bourgeois marriage. The prime consideration was the interest of the race, and in the second place came the interest of a particular class. But in the face of the coldness and rigour and calculating lucidity of such a noble concept of marriage as prevailed among every healthy aristocracy, like that of ancient Athens, and even of Europe during the eighteenth century, we warm-blooded animals, with our miserably oversensitive hearts, we &ldquo;moderns,&rdquo; cannot restrain a slight shudder. That is why love as a passion, in the big meaning of this word, was invented for, and in, an aristocratic community—where convention and abstinence are most severe.</p>

<p><em>Another commandment of philanthropy.</em>—There are cases where to have a child would be a crime—for example, for chronic invalids and extreme neurasthenics. These people should be converted to chastity, and for this purpose the music of <em>Parsifal</em> might at all events be tried. For Parsifal himself, that born fool, had ample reasons for not desiring to propagate. Unfortunately, however, one of the regular symptoms of exhausted stock is the inability to exercise any self-restraint in the presence of stimuli, and the tendency to respond to the smallest sexual attraction. It would be quite a mistake, for instance, to think of Leopardi as a chaste man. In such cases the priest and moralist play a hopeless game: it would be far better to send for the apothecary. Lastly, society here has a positive duty to fulfil, and of all the demands that are made on it, there are few more urgent and necessary than this one. Society as the trustee of life, is responsible to life for every botched life that comes into existence, and as it has to atone for such lives, it ought consequently to make it impossible for them ever to see the light of day: it should in many cases actually prevent the act of procreation, and may, without any regard for rank, descent, or intellect, hold in readiness the most rigorous forms of compulsion and restriction, and, under certain circumstances, have recourse to castration. The Mosaic law, &ldquo;Thou shalt do no murder,&rdquo; is a piece of ingenuous puerility compared with the earnestness of this forbidding of life to decadents, &ldquo;Thou shalt not beget&rdquo;!!! &hellip; For life itself recognises no solidarity or equality of rights between the healthy and unhealthy parts of an organism. The latter must at all cost be <em>eliminated,</em> lest the whole fall to pieces. Compassion for decadents, equal rights for the physiologically botched—this would be the very pinnacle of immorality, it would be setting up Nature&rsquo;s most formidable opponent as morality itself!</p>

<p>There are some delicate and morbid natures, the so-called idealists, who can never under any circumstances rise above a coarse, immature crime: yet it is the great justification of their anæmic little existence, it is the small requital for their lives of cowardice and falsehood to have been for one <em>instant</em> at least—strong. But they generally collapse after such an act.</p>

<p>In our civilised world we seldom hear of any but the bloodless, trembling criminal, overwhelmed by the curse and contempt of society, doubting even himself, and always belittling and belying his deeds—a misbegotten sort of criminal; that is why we are opposed to the idea that <em>all great men have been criminals</em> (only in the grand style, and neither petty nor pitiful), that crime must be inherent in greatness (this at any rate is the unanimous verdict of all those students of human nature who have sounded the deepest waters of great souls). To feel one&rsquo;s self adrift from all questions of ancestry, conscience, and duty—this is the danger with which every great man is confronted. Yet this is precisely what he desires: he desires the great goal, and consequently the means thereto.</p>

<p>In times when man is led by reward and punishment, the class of man which the legislator has in view is still of a low and primitive type: he is treated as one treats a child. In our latter-day culture, general degeneracy removes all sense from reward and punishment. This determination of action by the prospect of reward and punishment presupposes young, strong, and vigorous races. In effete races impulses are so irrepressible that a mere idea has no force whatever. Inability to offer any resistance to a stimulus, and the feeling that one must react to it: this excessive susceptibility of decadents makes all such systems of punishment and reform altogether senseless.</p>
<p>The idea &ldquo;amelioration&rdquo; presupposes a normal and strong creature whose action must in some way be balanced or cancelled if he is not to be lost and turned into an enemy of the community.</p>

<p><em>The effect of prohibition.</em> Every power which forbids and which knows how to excite fear in the person forbidden creates a guilty conscience. (That is to say, a person has a certain desire but is conscious of the danger of gratifying it, and is consequently forced to be secretive, underhand, and cautious.) Thus any prohibition deteriorates the character of those who do not willingly submit themselves to it, but are constrained thereto.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Punishment and reward.&quot;</em>—These two things stand or fall together. Nowadays no one will accept a reward or acknowledge that any authority should have the power to punish. Warfare has been reformed. We have a desire: it meets with opposition: we then see that we shall most easily obtain it by coming to some agreement—by drawing up a contract. In modern society where every one has given his assent to a certain contract, the criminal is a man who breaks that contract. This at least is a clear concept. But in that case, anarchists and enemies of social order could not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Crimes belong to the category of revolt against the social system, A rebel is not punished, he is simply suppressed. He <em>may</em> be an utterly contemptible and pitiful creature; but there is nothing intrinsically despicable about rebellion in fact, in our particular society revolt is far from being disgraceful. There are cases in which a rebel deserves honour precisely because he is conscious of certain elements in society which cry aloud for hostility; for such a man rouses us from our slumbers. When a criminal commits but one crime against a particular person, it does not alter the fact that all his instincts urge him to make a stand against the whole social system. His isolated act is merely a symptom.</p>
<p>The idea of punishment ought to be reduced to the concept of the suppression of revolt, a weapon against the vanquished (by means of long or short terms of imprisonment). But punishment should not be associated in any way with contempt. A criminal is at all events a man who has set his life, his honour, his freedom at stake; he is therefore a man of courage. Neither should punishment be regarded as penance or retribution, as though there were some recognised rate of exchange between crime and punishment. Punishment does not purify, simply because crime does not sully.</p>
<p>A criminal should not be prevented from making his peace with society, provided he does not belong to the race of criminals. In the latter case, however, he should be opposed even before he has committed an act of hostility. (As soon as he gets into the clutches of society the first operation to be performed upon him should be that of castration.) A criminal&rsquo;s bad manners and his low degree of intelligence should not be reckoned against him. Nothing is more common than that he should misunderstand himself (more particularly when his rebellious instinct—the rancour of the <em>unclassed</em>—has not reached consciousness simply because he has not read enough). It is natural that he should deny and dishonour his deed while under the influence of fear at its failure. All this is quite distinct from those cases in which, psychologically speaking, the criminal yields to an incomprehensible impulse, and attributes a motive to his deed by associating it with a merely incidental and insignificant action (for example, robbing a man, when his real desire was to take his blood).</p>
<p>The worth of a man should not be measured by any one isolated act. Napoleon warned us against this. Deeds which are only skin-deep are more particularly insignificant. If we have no crime—let us say no murder—on our conscience; why is it? It simply means that a few favourable circumstances have been wanting in our lives. And supposing we were induced to commit such a crime would our worth be materially affected? As a matter of fact, we should only be despised, if we were not credited with possessing the power to kill a man under certain circumstances. In nearly every crime certain qualities come into play without which no one would be a true man. Dostoievsky was not far wrong when he said of the inmates of the penal colonies in Siberia, that they constituted the strongest and most valuable portion of the Russian people. The fact that in our society the criminal happens to be a badly nourished and stunted animal is simply a condemnation of our system. In the days of the Renaissance the criminal was a flourishing specimen of humanity, and acquired his own virtue for himself,—Virtue in the sense of the Renaissance—that is to say, <em>virtù;</em> free from moralic acid.</p>
<p>It is only those whom we do not despise that we are able to elevate. Moral contempt is a far greater indignity and insult than any kind of crime.</p>
<ol start="741">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Shame was first introduced into punishment when certain penalties were inflicted on persons held in contempt, such as slaves. It was a despised class that was most frequently punished, and thus it came to pass that punishment and contempt were associated.</p>
<ol start="742">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In the ancient idea of punishment a religious concept was immanent, namely, the retributive power of chastisement. Penalties purified; in modern society, however, penalties degrade. Punishment is a form of paying off a debt: once it has been paid, one is freed from the deed for which one was so ready to suffer. Provided belief in the power of punishment exist, once the penalty is paid a feeling of relief and lightheartedness results, which is not so very far removed from a state of convalescence and health. One has made one&rsquo;s peace with society, and one appears to one&rsquo;s self more dignified pure&hellip;. To-day, however, punishment isolates even more than the crime; the fate behind the sin has become so formidable that it is almost hopeless. One rises from punishment still an enemy of society. Henceforward it reckons yet another enemy against it. The <em>jus talionis</em> may spring from the spirit of retribution (that is to say, from a sort of modification of the instinct of revenge); but in the Book of Manu, for instance, it is the need of having some equivalent in order to do penance, or to become free in a religious sense.</p>
<ol start="743">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>My pretty radical note of interrogation in the case of all more modern laws of punishment is this: should not the punishment fit the crime?—for in your heart of hearts thus would you have it. But then the susceptibility of the particular criminal to pain would have to be taken into account. In other words, there should be no such thing as a preconceived penalty for any crime—no fixed penal code. But as it would be no easy matter to ascertain the degree of sensitiveness of each individual criminal, punishment would have to be abolished in practice? What a sacrifice! Is it not? Consequently &hellip;</p>

<p>Ah! and the philosophy of jurisprudence! That is a science which, like all moral sciences, has not even been wrapped in swaddling-clothes yet. Even among jurists who consider themselves liberal, the oldest and most valuable significance of punishment is still misunderstood—it is not even known. So long as jurisprudence does not build upon a new foundation—on history and comparative anthropology—it will never cease to quarrel over the fundamentally false abstractions which are fondly imagined to be the &ldquo;philosophy of law,&rdquo; and which have nothing whatever to do with modern man. The man of to-day, however, is such a complicated woof even in regard to his legal valuation that he allows of the most varied interpretation.</p>

It would be better to widen the gulf—that is to say, roguery and stupidity should be increased. In this way human nature would become broader &hellip; but, after all, this is Fate, and it will happen, whether we desire it or not.

<p>Society, to-day, is full of consideration, tact, and reticence, and of good-natured respect for other people&rsquo;s rights—even for the exactions of strangers. To an even greater degree is there a certain charitable and instinctive depreciation of the worth of man as shown by all manner of trustful habits. Respect for men, and not only for the most virtuous, is perhaps the real parting of the ways between us and the Christian mythologists also have our good share of irony even when listening to moral sermons. He who preaches morality to us debases himself in our eyes and becomes almost comical. Liberal-mindedness regarding morality is one of the best signs of our age. In cases where it is most distinctly wanting, we regard it as a sign of a morbid condition (the case of Carlyle in England, of Ibsen in Norway, and Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism throughout Europe). If there is anything which can reconcile us to our own age, it is precisely the amount of immorality which it allows itself without falling in its own estimation—very much the reverse! In what, then, does the superiority of culture over the want of culture consist—of the Renaissance, for instance, over the Middle Ages? In this alone: the greater quantity of acknowledged immorality. From this it necessarily follows that the very <em>zenith</em> of human development <em>must</em> be regarded by the moral fanatic as the <em>non plus ultra</em> of corruption (in this connection let us recall Savonarola&rsquo;s judgment of Florence, Plato&rsquo;s indictment of Athens under Pericles, Luther&rsquo;s condemnation of Rome, Rousseau&rsquo;s anathemas against the society of Voltaire, and Germany&rsquo;s hostility to Goethe).</p>
<p>A little more fresh air, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! This ridiculous condition of Europe <em>must</em> not last any longer. Is there a single idea behind this bovine nationalism? What possible value can there be in encouraging this arrogant self-conceit when everything to-day points to greater and more common interests?—at a moment when the spiritual dependence and denationalisation, which are obvious to all, are paving the way for the reciprocal <em>rapprochements</em> and fertilisations which make up the real value and sense of present-day culture! &hellip; And it is precisely now that &ldquo;the new German Empire&rdquo; has been founded upon the most thread-bare and discredited of ideas—universal suffrage and equal right for all.</p>
<p>Think of all this struggling for advantage among conditions which are in every way degenerate: of this culture of big cities, of newspapers, of hurry and scurry, and of &ldquo;aimlessness&rdquo;! The economic unity of Europe must necessarily come—and with it, as a reaction, the pacivist movement.</p>
<p>A pacivist party, free from all sentimentality, which forbids its children to wage war; which forbids recourse to courts of justice; which forswears all fighting, all contradiction, and all persecution: for a while the party of the oppressed, and later the powerful party:—this party would be opposed to everything in the shape of revenge and resentment.</p>
<p>There will also be a war party, exercising the same thoroughness and severity towards itself, which will proceed in precisely the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The princes of Europe should really consider whether as a matter of fact they can dispense with our services—with us, the immoralists. We are to-day the only power which can win a victory without allies: and we are therefore far and away the strongest of the strong. We can even do without lying, and let me ask what other power can dispense with this weapon? A strong temptation fights for us; the strongest, perhaps, that exists—the temptation of truth&hellip;. Truth? How do I come by this word? I must withdraw it: I must repudiate this proud word. But no. We do not even want it—we shall be quite able to achieve our victory of power without its help. The real charm which fights for us, the eye of Venus which our opponents themselves deaden and blind—this charm is the magic of the extreme. The fascination which everything extreme exercises: we immoralists—we are in every way the extremists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Atonement of all Sin?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>People speak of the profound injustice of the social arrangement, as it the fact that one man is born in favourable circumstances and that another is born in unfavourable ones—or that one should possess gifts the other has not, were on the face of it an injustice. Among the more honest of these opponents of society this is what is said: &ldquo;We, with all the bad, morbid, criminal qualities which we acknowledge we possess, are only the inevitable result of the oppression for ages of the weak by the strong&rdquo;; thus they insinuate their evil natures into the consciences of the ruling classes. They threaten and storm and curse. They become virtuous from sheer indignation—they don&rsquo;t want to have become bad men and <em>canaille</em> for nothing. The name for this attitude, which is an invention of the last century, is, if I am not mistaken, pessimism; and even that pessimism which is the outcome of indignation. It is in this attitude of mind that history is judged, that it is deprived of its inevitable fatality, and that responsibility and even guilt is discovered in it. For the great desideratum is to find guilty people in it. The botched and the bungled, the decadents of all kinds, are revolted at themselves, and require sacrifices in order that they may not slake their thirst for destruction upon themselves (which might, indeed, be the most reasonable procedure). But for this purpose they at least require a semblance of justification, <em>i.e.</em> a theory according to which the fact of their existence, and of their character, may be expiated by a scapegoat. This scapegoat may be God,—in Russia such resentful atheists are not wanting,—or the order of society, or education and upbringing, or the Jews, or the nobles, or, finally, the well-constituted of every kind. &ldquo;It is a sin for a man to have been born in decent circumstances, for by so doing he disinherits the others, he pushes them aside, he imposes upon them the curse of vice and of work&hellip;. How can I be made answerable for my misery; surely some one must be responsible for it, or I could not bear to live.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>In short, resentful pessimism discovers responsible parties in order to create a pleasurable sensation for itself—revenge&hellip;. &ldquo;Sweeter than honey&rdquo;—thus does even old Homer speak of revenge.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The fact that such a theory no longer meets with understanding—or rather, let us say, contempt is accounted for by that particle of Christianity which still circulates in the blood of every one of us; it makes us tolerant towards things simply because we scent a Christian savour about them&hellip;. The Socialists appeal to the Christian instincts; this is their really refined piece of cleverness&hellip;. Thanks to Christianity, we have now grown accustomed to the superstitious concept of a soul—of an immortal soul, of soul monads, which, as a matter of fact, hails from somewhere else, and which has only become inherent in certain cases—that is to say, become incarnate in them—by accident: but the nature of these cases is not altered, let alone determined by it. The circumstances of society, of relationship, and of history are only accidents for the soul, perhaps misadventures: in any case, the world is not their work. By means of the idea of soul the individual is made transcendental; thanks to it, a ridiculous amount of importance can be attributed to him.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it was Christianity which first induced the individual to take up this position of judge of all things. It made megalomania almost his duty: it has made everything temporary and limited subordinate to eternal rights! What is the State, what is society, what are historical laws, what is physiology to me? Thus speaks something from beyond Becoming, an immutable entity throughout history: thus speaks something immortal, something divine—it is the soul!</p>
<p>Another Christian, but no less insane, concept has percolated even deeper into the tissues of modern ideas: the concept of the equality of all souls before God. In this concept the prototype of all theories concerning equal rights is to be found. Man was first taught to stammer this proposition religiously: later, it was converted into a moral; no wonder he has ultimately begun to take it seriously, to take it <em>practically</em>!—that is to say, politically, socialistically, resento-pessimistically.</p>
<p>Wherever responsible circumstances or people have been looked for, it was the <em>instinct of revenge</em> that sought them. This instinct of revenge obtained such an ascendancy over man in the course of centuries that the whole of metaphysics, psychology, ideas of society, and, above all, morality, are tainted with it. Man has nourished this idea of responsibility to such an extent that he has introduced the bacillus of vengeance into everything. By means of it he has made God Himself ill, and killed innocence in the universe, by tracing every condition of things to acts of will, to intentions, to responsible agents. The whole teaching of will, this most fatal fraud that has ever existed in psychology hitherto, was invented essentially for the purpose of punishment. It was the social utility of punishment that lent this concept its dignity, its power, and its truth. The originator of that psychology, that we shall call volitional psychology, must be sought in those classes which had the right of punishment in their hands; above all, therefore, among the priests who stood on the very pinnacle of ancient social systems: these people wanted to create for themselves the right to wreak revenge—they wanted to supply God with the privilege of vengeance. For this purpose; man was declared &ldquo;free&rdquo;: to this end every action had to be regarded as voluntary, and the origin of every deed had to be considered as lying in consciousness. But by such propositions as these ancient psychology is refuted.</p>
<p>To-day, when Europe seems to have taken the contrary direction; when we halcyonians would fain withdraw, dissipate, and banish the concept of guilt and punishment with all our might from the world; when our most serious endeavours are concentrated upon purifying psychology, morality, history, nature, social institutions and privileges, and even God Himself, from this filth; in whom must we recognise our most mortal enemies? Precisely in those apostles of revenge and resentment, in those who are <em>par excellence</em> pessimists from indignation, who make it their mission to sanctify their filth with the name of &ldquo;righteous indignation.&rdquo;&hellip; We others, whose one desire is to reclaim innocence on behalf of Becoming, would fain be the missionaries of a purer thought, namely, that no one is responsible for man&rsquo;s qualities; neither God, nor society, nor his parents, nor his ancestors, nor himself—in fact, that no one is to blame for him &hellip; The being who might be made responsible for a man&rsquo;s existence, for the fact that he is constituted in a particular way, or for his birth in certain circumstances and in a certain environment, is absolutely lacking.—<em>And it is a great blessing that such a being is non-existent &hellip;</em>. We are <em>not</em> the result of an eternal design, of a will, of a desire: there is no attempt being made with us to attain to an &ldquo;ideal of perfection,&rdquo; to an &ldquo;ideal of happiness,&rdquo; to an &ldquo;ideal of virtue,&quot;—and we are just as little the result of a mistake on God&rsquo;s part in the presence of which He ought to feel uneasy (a thought which is known to be at the very root of the Old Testament). There is not a place nor a purpose nor a sense to which we can attribute our existence or our kind of existence. In the first place, no one is in a position to do this: it is quite impossible to judge, to measure, or to compare, or even to deny the whole universe! And why?—For five reasons, all accessible to the man of average intelligence: for instance, <em>because there is no existence outside the universe &hellip;</em> and let us say it again, this is a great blessing, for therein lies the whole innocence of our lives.</p>

But nowadays people are trying to understand <em>the herd</em> as they would an individual, and to confer higher rights upon it than upon isolated personalities. Terrible mistake!! In addition to this, all that makes for gregariousness, <em>e.g.</em> sympathy, is regarded as the <em>more valuable</em> side of our natures.</p>

<p>The individual is something quite <em>new,</em> and capable of <em>creating new things.</em> He is something absolute, and all his actions are quite his own. The individual in the end has to seek the valuation for his actions in himself: because he has to give an individual meaning even to traditional words and notions. His interpretation of a formula is at least personal, even if he does not create the formula itself: at least as an interpreter he is creative.</p>

<p>Every living organism gropes around as far as its power permits, and overcomes all that is weaker than itself: by this means it finds pleasure in its own existence. The <em>increasing &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;</em> of this tendency consists in the fact that we are beginning to feel ever more subtly how difficult it is really to <em>absorb</em> others: while we could show our power by injuring him, his will <em>estranges</em> him from us, and thus makes him less susceptible of being overcome.</p>

<p>The degree of resistance which has to be continually overcome in order to remain <em>at the top,</em> is the measure of <em>freedom,</em> whether for individuals or for societies: freedom being understood as positive power, as will to power. The highest form of individual freedom, of sovereignty, would, according to this, in all probability be found not five feet away from its opposite—that is to say, where the danger of slavery hangs over life, like a hundred swords of Damocles. Let any one go through the whole of history from this point of view: the ages when the individual reaches perfect maturity, <em>i.e.</em> the free ages, when the classical type, <em>sovereign man,</em> is attained to—these were certainly not humane times!</p>
<p>There should be no choice: either one must be uppermost or nethermost—like a worm, despised, annihilated, trodden upon. One must have tyrants against one in order to become a tyrant, <em>i.e.</em> in order to be free. It is no small advantage to have a hundred swords of Damocles suspended over one: it is only thus that one learns to dance, it is only thus that one attains to any freedom in one&rsquo;s movements.</p>

<p>A criticism of <em>selfishness.</em> The involuntary ingenuousness of La Rochefoucauld, who believed that he was saying something bold, liberal, and paradoxical (in his days, of course, truth in psychological matters was something that astonished people) when he said. &ldquo;<em>Les grandes âmes ne sont pas celles qui ont moins de passions et plus de vertus que les âmes communes, mais seulement celles qui ont de plus grands desseins.</em>&rdquo; Certainly, John Stuart Mill (who calls Chamfort the <em>noble</em> and philosophical La Rochefoucauld of the eighteenth century) recognises in him merely an astute and keen-sighted observer of all that which is the result of habitual selfishness in the human breast, and he adds: &ldquo;A noble spirit is unable to see the necessity of a constant observation of <em>baseness</em> and <em>contemptibility</em>, unless it were to show against what corrupting influences a lofty spirit and a noble character were able to triumph.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Morphology of the Feelings of Self.</em></p>
<p><em>First standpoint</em>—To what extent are <em>sympathy</em> or <em>communal feelings,</em> the lower or preparatory states, at a time when personal self-esteem and initiative in valuation, on the part of individuals, are not yet possible?</p>
<p><em>Second standpoint.</em>—To what extent is the zenith of collective self-esteem, the pride in the distinction of the clan, the feeling of inequality and a certain abhorrence of mediation, of equal rights and of reconciliation, the school for individual self-esteem? It may be this in so far as it compels the individual to represent the pride of the community —he is obliged to speak and act with tremendous self-respect, because he stands for the community And the same holds good when the individual regards himself as the instrument or speaking-tube of a godhead.</p>
<p><em>Third standpoint.</em>—To what extent do these forms of impersonality invest the individual with enormous importance? In so far as higher powers are using him as an intermediary: religious shyness towards one&rsquo;s self is the condition of prophets and poets.</p>
<p><em>Fourth standpoint.</em>—To what extent does responsibility for a whole educate the individual in foresight, and give him a severe and terrible hand, a calculating and cold heart, majesty of bearing and of action—things which he would not allow himself if he stood only for his own rights?</p>
<p>In short, collective self-esteem is the great preparatory school for personal sovereignty. The noble caste is that which creates the heritage of this faculty.</p>

<p>The disguised forms of will to power:—</p>
<p>(1) <em>The desire for freedom,</em> for independence for equilibrium, for peace, for <em>co-ordination.</em> Also that of the anchorite, the &ldquo;Free-Spirit.&rdquo; In its lowest form, the will to live at all costs—the instinct of self-preservation.</p>
<p>(2) Subordination, with the view of satisfying the will to power of a whole community; submissiveness, the making of one&rsquo;s self indispensable and useful to him who has the power; love, a secret path to the heart of the powerful, in order to become his master.</p>
<p>(3) The feeling of duty, conscience, the imaginary comfort of belonging to a higher order than those who actually hold the reins of power; the acknowledgment of an order of rank which allows of judging even the more powerful, self-depreciation; the discovery of new <em>codes of morality</em> (of which the Jews are a classical example).</p>

<p>*Praise and gratitude as forms of will to power.—*Praise and gratitude for harvests, for good weather, victories, marriages, and peace—all festivals need a subject on which feeling can be outpoured. The desire is to make all good things that happen to one appear as though they had been done to one: people will have a donor. The same holds good of the work of art: people are not satisfied with it alone, they must praise the artist.—What, then, is praise? It is a sort of compensation for benefits received, a sort of giving back, a manifestation of <em>our</em> power—for the man who praises assents to, blesses, values, <em>judges</em>. he arrogates to himself the right to give his consent to a thing, to be able to confer honours. An increased feeling of happiness or of liveliness is also an increased feeling of power, and it is as a result of this feeling that a man <em>praises</em> (it is as the outcome of this feeling that he invents a donor, a &ldquo;subject&rdquo;). Gratitude is thus revenge of a lofty kind: it is most severely exercised and demanded where equality and pride both require to be upheld—that is to say, where revenge is practised to its fullest extent.</p>

<p><em>Concerning the Machiavellism of Power.</em></p>
<p>The <em>will to power</em> appears:—</p>
<p><em>(a)</em> Among the oppressed and slaves of all kinds, in the form of will to &ldquo;<em>freedom</em>&rdquo;: the mere fact of breaking loose from something seems to be an end in itself (in a religio-moral sense: &ldquo;One is only answerable to one&rsquo;s own conscience&rdquo;; &ldquo;evangelical freedom,&rdquo; etc. etc.),</p>
<p><em>(b)</em> In the case of a stronger species, ascending to power, in the form of the will to overpower. If this fails, then it shrinks to the &ldquo;will to justice&rdquo;—that is to say, to the will to the same measure of rights as the ruling caste possesses.</p>
<p><em>(c)</em> In the case of the strongest, richest, most independent, and most courageous, in the form of &ldquo;love of humanity,&rdquo; of &ldquo;love of the people,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;gospel,&rdquo; of &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of &ldquo;God,&rdquo; of &ldquo;pity,&rdquo; of self sacrifice,&rdquo; etc. etc.; in the form of overpowering, of deeds of capture, of imposing service on some one, of an instinctive reckoning of one&rsquo;s self as part of a great mass of power to which one attempts to give a direction: the hero, the prophet, the Cæsar, the Saviour, the bell-wether. (The love of the sexes also belongs to this category, it will overpower something, possess it utterly, and it looks like self-abnegation. At bottom it is only the love of one&rsquo;s instrument, of one&rsquo;s &ldquo;horse&rdquo;—the conviction that things belong to one because one is in a position to use them.)</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Senses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Passions.&rdquo;.</em>—When the fear of the senses and of the passions and of the desires becomes so great as to warn us against them, it is already a symptom of <em>weakness:</em> extreme measures always characterise abnormal conditions. That which is lacking here, or more precisely that which is decaying, is the power to resist an impulse: when one feels instinctively that one must yield,—that is to say, that one must react,—then it is an excellent thing to avoid opportunities (temptations).</p>
<p>The stimulation of the senses is only a temptation in so far as those creatures are concerned whose systems are easily swayed and influenced: on the other hand, in the case of remarkable constitutional obtuseness and hardness, strong stimuli are necessary in order to set the functions in motion. Dissipation can only be objected to in the case of one who has no right to it; and almost all passions have fallen into disrepute thanks to those who were not strong enough to convert them to their own advantage.</p>
<p>One should understand that passions are open to the same objections as illnesses: yet we should not be justified in doing without illnesses, and still less without passions. We require the abnormal; we give life a tremendous shock by means of these great illnesses.</p>
<p>In detail the following should be distinguished:—</p>
<p>(1) The <em>dominating passion,</em> which may even bring the supremest form of health with it: in this case the co-ordination of the internal system and its functions to perform one task is best attained,—but this is almost a definition of health.</p>
<p>(2) The antagonism of the passions the double, treble, and multiple soul in one breast:[6] this is very unhealthy; it is a sign of inner ruin and of disintegration, betraying and promoting an internal dualism and anarchy—unless, of course, one passion becomes master. <em>Return to health.</em></p>
<p>(3) The juxtaposition of passions without their being either opposed or united with one another. Very often transitory, and then, as soon as order is established, this condition may be a healthy one. A most interesting class of men belong to this order, the chameleons; they are not necessarily at loggerheads with themselves, they are both happy and secure, but they cannot develop—their moods lie side by side, even though they may seem to lie far apart. They change, but they become nothing.</p>
<p>[6] This refers to Goethe&rsquo;s <em>Faust.</em> In Part I., Act I., Scene 11., we find Faust exclaiming in despair: &ldquo;Two souls, alas! within my bosom throne!&rdquo; See Theodore Martin&rsquo;s <em>Faust,</em> translated into English verse.—Tr.</p>

<p>The quantitative estimate of aims and its influence upon the valuing standpoint, the <em>great</em> and the <em>small</em> criminal. The greatness or smallness of the aims will determine whether the doer feels respect for himself with it all, or whether he feels pusillanimous and miserable.</p>
<p>The degree of intellectuality manifested in the means employed may likewise influence our valuation. How differently the philosophical innovator, experimenter, and man of violence stands out against robbers, barbarians, adventurers!—There is a semblance of disinterestedness in the former.</p>

<p>Historians prove its justification and reason; travels, exoticism, psychology, penal codes, the lunatic asylum, the criminal, sociology.</p>
<p>Impersonality (so that as media of a collective whole we allow ourselves these passions and action—the Bar, juries, the bourgeois, the soldier, the minister, the prince, society, &ldquo;critics&rdquo;) makes us feel that we are <em>sacrificing something.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The growing autonomy of the individual&rdquo;—Parisian philosophers like M.

For Heaven&rsquo;s sake open your eyes, ye sociologists who deal with the future! The individual grew strong under quite opposite conditions: ye describe the extremest weakening and impoverishment of man; ye actually want this weakness and impoverishment, and ye apply the whole lying machinery of the old ideal in order to achieve your end. Ye are so constituted that ye actually regard your gregarious wants as an ideal! Here we are in the presence of an absolute lack of psychological honesty.</p>
<ol start="783">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The two traits which characterise the modern European are apparently antagonistic <em>individualism and the demand for equal rights</em>: this I am at last beginning to understand. The individual is an extremely vulnerable piece of vanity: this vanity, when it is conscious of its high degree of susceptibility to pain, demands that every one should be made equal; that the individual should only stand <em>inter pares</em>. But in this way a social race is depicted in which, as a matter of fact, gifts and powers are on the whole equally distributed. The pride which would have loneliness and but few appreciators is quite beyond comprehension: really &ldquo;great&rdquo; successes are only attained through the masses—indeed, we scarcely understand yet that a mob success is in reality only a small success; because <em>pulchrum est paucorum hominum.</em></p>
<p>No morality will countenance order of rank among men, and the jurists know nothing of a communal conscience. The principle of individualism rejects <em>really great</em> men, and demands the most delicate vision for, and the speediest discovery of, a talent among people who are almost equal; and inasmuch as every one has some modicum of talent in such late and civilised cultures (and can, therefore, expect to receive his share of honour), there is a more general buttering-up of modest merits to-day than there has ever been. This gives the age the appearance of <em>unlimited justice.</em> Its want of justice is to be found not in its unbounded hatred of tyrants and demagogues, even in the arts; but in its detestation of noble natures who scorn the praise of the many. The demand for equal rights (that is to say, the privilege of sitting in judgment on everything and everybody) is anti-aristocratic.</p>
<p>This age knows just as little concerning the absorption of the individual, of his mergence into a great type of men who do not want to be personalities. It was this that formerly constituted the distinction and the zeal of many lofty natures (the greatest poets among them); or of the desire to be a <em>polis,</em> as in Greece; or of Jesuitism, or of the Prussian Staff Corps, and bureaucracy; or of apprenticeship and a continuation of the tradition of great masters: to all of which things, non-social conditions and the absence of <em>petty vanity</em> are necessary.</p>
<ol start="784">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Individualism</em> is a modest and still unconscious form of will to power; with it a single human unit seems to think it sufficient to free himself from the preponderating power of society (or of the State or Church). He does not set himself up in opposition as a <em>personality,</em> but merely as a unit; he represents the rights of all other individuals as against the whole. That is to say, he instinctively places himself on a level with every other unit: what he combats he does not combat as a person, but as a representative of units against a mass.</p>
<p>Socialism is merely an agitatory measure of individualism: it recognises the fact that in order to attain to something, men must organise themselves into a general movement—into a &ldquo;power.&rdquo; But what the Socialist requires is not society as the object of the individual, <em>but society as a means of making many individuals possible</em>: this is the instinct of Socialists, though they frequently deceive themselves on this point (apart from this, however, in order to make their kind prevail, they are compelled to deceive others to an enormous extent). Altruistic moral preaching thus enters into the service of individual egoism,—one of the most common frauds of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p><em>Anarchy</em> is also merely an agitatory measure of Socialism; with it the Socialist inspires fear, with fear he begins to fascinate and to terrorise: but what he does above all is to draw all courageous and reckless people to his side, even in the most intellectual spheres.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, individualism is the most modest stage of the will to power.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When one has reached a certain degree of independence, one always longs for more: separation in proportion to the degree of force; the individual is no longer content to regard himself as equal to everybody, he actually <em>seeks for his peer</em>—he makes himself stand out from others. Individualism is followed by a development in groups and organs; correlative tendencies join up together and become powerfully active: now there arise between these centres of power, friction, war, a reconnoitring of the forces on either side, reciprocity, understandings, and the regulation of mutual services. Finally, there appears an order of rank.</p>
<p>Recapitulation—</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The individuals emancipate themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They make war, and ultimately agree concerning equal rights (justice is made an end in itself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once this is reached, the actual differences in degrees of power begin to make themselves felt, and to a greater extent than before (the reason being that on the whole peace is established, and innumerable small centres of power begin to create differences which formerly were scarcely noticeable). Now the individuals begin to form groups, these strive after privileges and preponderance, and war starts afresh in a milder form.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>People demand freedom only when they have no power. Once power is obtained, a preponderance thereof is the next thing to be coveted; if this is not achieved (owing to the fact that one is still too weak for it), then <em>&ldquo;justice&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;equality</em> of power&rdquo; become the objects of desire.</p>

<p><em>The rectification of the concept &ldquo;egoism.&quot;</em>—When one has discovered what an error the &ldquo;individual&rdquo; is, and that every single creature represents the whole process of evolution (not alone &ldquo;inherited,&rdquo; but in &ldquo;himself&rdquo;), the individual then acquires <em>an inordinately great importance.</em> The voice of instinct is quite right here. When this instinct tends to decline, <em>i.e.</em> when the individual begins to seek his worth in his services to others, one may be sure that exhaustion and degeneration have set in. An altruistic attitude of mind, when it is fundamental and free from all hypocrisy, is the instinct of creating a second value for one&rsquo;s self in the service of other egoists. As a rule, however, it is only apparent—a circuitous path to the preservation of one&rsquo;s own feelings of vitality and worth.</p>
<ol start="786">

</ol>
<p><em>The History of Moralisation and Demoralisation.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposition one.</em>—There are no such things as moral actions: they are purely imaginary. Not only is it impossible to demonstrate their existence (a fact which Kant and Christianity, for instance, both acknowledged) but they are not even possible. Owing to psychological misunderstanding, a man invented an <em>opposite</em> to the instinctive impulses of life, and believed that a new species of instinct was thereby discovered: a <em>primum mobile</em> was postulated which does not exist at all. According to the valuation which gave rise to the antithesis &ldquo;moral&rdquo; and &ldquo;immoral,&rdquo; one should say: <em>There is nothing else on earth but immoral intentions and actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposition two.</em>——The whole differentiation, &ldquo;moral&rdquo; and &ldquo;immoral,&rdquo; arises from the assumption that both moral and immoral actions are the result of a spontaneous will—in short, that such a will exists; or in other words, that moral judgments can only hold good with regard to intuitions and actions <em>that are free.</em> But this whole order of actions and intentions is purely imaginary: the only world to which the moral standard could be applied does not exist at all: <em>there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral action.</em></p>
<p>The <em>psychological error</em> out of which the antithesis &ldquo;moral&rdquo; and &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; arose is: &ldquo;selfless,&rdquo; &ldquo;unselfish,&rdquo; &ldquo;self-denying&rdquo;—all unreal and fantastic.</p>
<p>A false dogmatism also clustered around the concept &ldquo;ego&rdquo;; it was regarded as atomic, and falsely opposed to a non-ego; it was also liberated from Becoming, and declared to belong to the sphere of Being. The false materialisation of the ego: this (owing to the belief in individual immortality) was made an article of faith under the pressure of <em>religio-moral discipline.</em> According to this artificial liberation of the ego and its transference to the realm of the absolute, people thought that they had arrived at an antithesis in values which seemed quite irrefutable—the single ego and the vast non-ego. It seemed obvious that the value of the individual ego could only exist in conjunction with the vast non-ego, more particularly in the sense of being subject to it and existing only for its sake. Here, of course, the gregarious instinct determined the direction of thought: nothing is more opposed to this instinct than the sovereignty of the individual. Supposing, however, that the ego be absolute, then its value must lie in <em>self-negation.</em></p>
<p>Thus: (1) the false emancipation of the &ldquo;individual&rdquo; as an atom;</p>
<p>(2) The gregarious self-conceit which abhors the desire to remain an atom, and regards it as hostile.</p>
<p>(3) As a result: the overcoming of the individual by changing his aim.</p>
<p>(4) At this point there appeared to be actions that were self-effacing: around these actions a whole sphere of antitheses was fancied.</p>
<p>(5) It was asked, in what sort of actions does man most strongly assert himself? Around these (sexuality, covetousness, lust for power, cruelty, etc. etc.) hate, contempt, and anathemas were heaped: it was believed that there could be such things as selfless impulses. Everything selfish was condemned, everything unselfish was in demand.</p>
<p>(6) And the result was: what had been done? A ban had been placed on the strongest, the most natural, yea, the only genuine impulses, henceforward, in order that an action might be praiseworthy, there must be no trace in it of any of those genuine impulses—<em>monstrous fraud in psychology.</em> Every kind of &ldquo;self-satisfaction&rdquo; had to be remodelled and made possible by means of misunderstanding and adjusting one&rsquo;s self <em>sub specie boni.</em> Conversely: that species which found its advantage in depriving mankind of its self-satisfaction, the representatives of the gregarious instincts, <em>e.g.</em> the priests and the philosophers, were sufficiently crafty and psychologically astute to show how selfishness ruled everywhere. The Christian conclusion from this was: &ldquo;Everything is sin, even our virtues. Man is utterly undesirable. Selfless actions are impossible.&rdquo; Original sin. In short, once man had opposed his instincts to a purely imaginary world of the good, he concluded by despising himself as incapable of performing &ldquo;good&rdquo; actions.</p>
<p><em>N.B.</em> In this way Christianity represents a step forward in the sharpening of psychological insight: La Rochefoucauld and Pascal. It perceived the essential equality of human actions, and the equality of their values as a whole (all immoral).</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Now the first serious object was to rear men in whom self-seeking impulses were extinguished. <em>priests, saints.</em> And if people doubted that perfection was possible, they did not doubt what perfection was.</p>
<p>The psychology of the saint and of the priest and of the &ldquo;good&rdquo; man, must naturally have seemed purely phantasmagorical. The real motive of all action had been declared bad: therefore, in order to make action still possible, deeds had to be prescribed which, though not possible, had to be declared possible and sanctified. They now honoured and idealised things with as much falsity as they had previously slandered them.</p>
<p>Inveighing against the instincts of life came to be regarded as holy and estimable. The priestly ideal was: absolute chastity, absolute obedience, absolute poverty! The lay ideal: alms, pity, self-sacrifice, renunciation of the beautiful, of reason, and of sensuality, and a dark frown for all the strong qualities that existed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An advance is made: the slandered instincts attempt to re-establish their rights (<em>e.g.</em> Luther&rsquo;s Reformation, the coarsest form of moral falsehood under the cover of &ldquo;Evangelical freedom&rdquo;), they are rechristened with holy names.</p>
<p>The calumniated instincts try to demonstrate that they are necessary in order that the virtuous instincts may be possible. <em>Il faut vivre, afin de vivre pour autrui:</em> egoism as a means to an end.[7]</p>
<p>But people go still further: they try to grant both the egoistic and altruistic impulses the right to exist—equal rights for both—from the utilitarian standpoint.</p>
<p>People go further: they see greater utility in placing the egoistic rights before the altruistic—greater utility in the sense of more happiness for the majority, or of the elevation of mankind, etc. etc. Thus the rights of egoism begin to preponderate, but under the cloak of an extremely altruistic standpoint—the collective utility of humanity.</p>
<p>An attempt is made to reconcile the altruistic mode of action with the natural order of things. Altruism is sought in the very roots of life. Altruism and egoism are both based upon the essence of life and nature.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the opposition between them is dreamt of as a future possibility. Continued adaptation, it is hoped, will merge the two into one.</p>
<p>At last it is seen that altruistic actions are merely a species of the egoistic—and that the degree to which one loves and spends one&rsquo;s self is a proof of the extent of one&rsquo;s individual power and personality. In short, that the more evil man can be made, the better he is, and that one cannot be the one without the other. At this point the curtain rises which concealed the monstrous fraud of the psychology that has prevailed hitherto.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Results.</em>—There are only immoral intentions and actions; the so-called moral actions must be shown to be immoral. All emotions are traced to a single will, the will to power, and are called essentially equal. The concept of life: in the apparent antithesis good and evil, degrees of power in the instincts alone are expressed. A temporary order of rank is established according to which certain instincts are either controlled or enlisted in our service. Morality is justified: economically, etc.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Against proposition two.—Determinism: the attempt to rescue the moral world by transferring it to the unknown.</p>
<p>Determinism is only a manner of allowing ourselves to conjure our valuations away, once they have lost their place in a world interpreted mechanistically. Determinism must therefore be attacked and undermined at all costs: just as our right to distinguish between an absolute and phenomenal world should be disputed.</p>

<p>If one is clear as to the &ldquo;wherefore&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s life, then the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of it can take care of itself.</p>
<p>It is already even a sign of disbelief in the wherefore and in the purpose and sense of life—in fact, it is a sign of a lack of will—when the value of pleasure and pain step into the foreground, and hedonistic and pessimistic teaching becomes prevalent; and self-abnegation, resignation, virtue, &ldquo;objectivity,&rdquo; <em>may,</em> at the very least, be signs that the most important factor is beginning to make its absence felt.</p>

<p>Hitherto there has been no German culture. It is no refutation of this assertion to say that there have been great anchorites in Germany (Goethe, for instance); for these had their own culture. But it was precisely around them, as though around mighty, defiant, and isolated rocks, that the remaining spirit of Germany, <em>as their antithesis,</em> lay that is to say, as a soft, swampy, slippery soil, upon which every step and every footprint of the rest of Europe made an impression and created forms. German culture was a thing devoid of character and of almost unlimited yielding power.</p>

<p>Germany, though very rich in clever and well-informed scholars, has for some time been so excessively poor in great souls and in mighty minds, that it almost seems to have forgotten what a great soul or a mighty mind is; and to-day mediocre and even ill-constituted men place themselves in the market square without the suggestion of a conscience-prick or a sign of embarrassment, and declare themselves great men, reformers, etc. Take the case of Eugen Dühring, for instance, a really clever and well-informed scholar, but a man who betrays with almost every word he says that he has a miserably small soul, and that he is horribly tormented by narrow envious feelings; moreover, that it is no mighty overflowing, benevolent, and spendthrift spirit that drives him on, but only the spirit of ambition! But to be ambitious in such an age as this is much more unworthy of a philosopher than ever it was: to-day, when it is the mob that rules, when it is the mob that dispenses the honours.</p>

<p>My &ldquo;future&rdquo;: a severe polytechnic education. Conscription; so that as a rule every man of the higher classes should be an officer, whatever else he may be besides.</p>
