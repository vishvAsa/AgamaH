  <p>4 THE WILL TO POWER IN ART.</p>
<ol start="794">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Our religion, morality, and philosophy are decadent human institutions. The counter-agent. Art.</p>
<ol start="795">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>Artist-philosopher.</em> A higher concept of art. Can man stand at so great a distance from his fellows as to mould them? (Preliminary exercises thereto:—</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To become a self-former, an anchorite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do what artists have done hitherto, <em>i.e.</em> to reach a small degree of perfection in a certain medium.)</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Art as it appears without the artist, <em>i.e.</em> as a body, an organisation (the Prussian Officers&rsquo; Corps, the Order of the Jesuits). To what extent is the artist merely a preliminary stage? The world regarded as a self-generating work of art.</p>
<ol start="797">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The phenomenon, &ldquo;artist,&rdquo; is the easiest to see through: from it one can look down upon the fundamental instincts of power, of nature, etc., even of religion and morality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play,&rdquo; uselessness—as the ideal of him who is overflowing with power, as the ideal of the child. The childishness of God, παῑς παίζων.</p>
<ol start="798">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Apollonian, Dionysian.</em> There are two conditions in which art manifests itself in man even as a force of nature, and disposes of him whether he consent or not: it may be as a constraint to visionary states, or it may be an orgiastic impulse. Both conditions are to be seen in normal life, but they are then somewhat weaker: in dreams and in moments of elation or intoxication.[9]</p>
<p>But the same contrast exists between the dream state and the state of intoxication; both of these states let loose all manner of artistic powers within us, but each unfetters powers of a different kind. Dreamland gives us the power of vision, of association, of poetry: intoxication gives us the power of grand attitudes, of passion, of song, and of dance.</p>
<p>[9] German: &ldquo;Rausch.&quot;—There is no word in English for the German expression &ldquo;Rausch.&rdquo; When Nietzsche uses it, he means a sort of blend of our two words: intoxication and elation.—Tr.</p>
<ol start="799">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sexuality and voluptuousness belong to the Dionysiac intoxication: but neither of them is lacking in the Apollonian state. There is also a difference of tempo between the states&hellip;. <em>The extreme peace of certain feelings of intoxication</em> (or, more strictly, the slackening of the feeling of time, and the reduction of the feeling of space) is wont to reflect itself in the vision of the most restful attitudes and states of the soul. The classical style essentially represents repose, simplification, foreshortening, and concentration—the <em>highest feeling of power</em> is concentrated in the classical type. To react with difficulty: great consciousness: no feeling of strife.</p>
<ol start="800">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The feeling of intoxication is, as a matter of fact, equivalent to a sensation of <em>surplus power</em>: it is strongest in seasons of rut: new organs, new accomplishments, new colours, new forms. Embellishment is an outcome of <em>increased power.</em> Embellishment is merely an expression of a triumphant will, of an increased state of co-ordination, of a harmony of all the strong desires, of an infallible and perpendicular equilibrium. Logical and geometrical simplification is the result of an increase of power: conversely, the mere aspect of such a simplification increases the sense of power in the beholder&hellip;. The zenith of development: the grand style.</p>
<p>Ugliness signifies <em>the decadence of a type</em>: contradiction and faulty co-ordination among the inmost desires—this means a decline in the <em>organising</em> power, or, psychologically speaking, in the will. The condition of pleasure which is called intoxication is really an exalted feeling of power. &hellip; Sensations of space and time are altered; inordinate distances are traversed by the eye, and only then become visible; the extension of the vision over greater masses and expanses; the refinement of the organ which apprehends the smallest and most elusive things; divination, the power of understanding at the slightest hint, at the smallest suggestion; intelligent sensitiveness; <em>strength</em> as a feeling of dominion in the muscles, as agility and love of movement, as dance, as levity and quick time; strength as the love of proving strength, as bravado, adventurousness, fearlessness, indifference in regard to life and death&hellip;. All these elated moments of life stimulate each other; the world of images and of imagination of the one suffices as a suggestion for the other: in this way states finally merge into each other, which might do better to keep apart, <em>e.g.</em> the feeling of religious intoxication and sexual irritability (two very profound feelings, always wonderfully co-ordinated. What is it that pleases almost all pious women, old or young? Answer: a saint with beautiful legs, still young, still innocent). Cruelty in tragedy and pity (likewise normally correlated). Spring-time, dancing, music, —all these things are but the display of one sex before the other,—as also that &ldquo;infinite yearning of the heart&rdquo; peculiar to Faust.</p>
<p>Artists when they are worth anything at all are men of strong propensities (even physically), with surplus energy, powerful animals, sensual; without a certain overheating of the sexual system a man like Raphael is unthinkable&hellip;. To produce music is also in a sense to produce children; chastity is merely the economy of the artist, and in all creative artists productiveness certainly ceases with sexual potency&hellip;. Artists should not see things as they are; they should see them fuller, simpler, stronger: to this end, however, a kind of youthfulness, of vernality, a sort of perpetual elation, must be peculiar to their lives.</p>
<ol start="801">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The states in which we transfigure things and make them fuller, and rhapsodise about them, until they reflect our own fulness and love of life back upon us: sexuality, intoxication, post-prandial states, spring, triumph over our enemies, scorn, bravado, cruelty, the ecstasy of religious feeling. But three elements above all are active: <em>sexuality, intoxication, cruelty</em>; all these belong to the oldest <em>festal joys</em> of mankind, they also preponderate in budding artists.</p>
<p>Conversely: there are things with which we meet which already show us this transfiguration and fulness, and the animal world&rsquo;s response thereto is a state of excitement in the spheres where these states of happiness originate. A blending of these very delicate shades of animal well-being and desires is the <em>æsthetic state.</em> The latter only manifests itself in those natures which are capable of that spendthrift and overflowing fulness of bodily vigour; the latter is always the <em>primum mobile.</em> The sober-minded man, the tired man, the exhausted and dried-up man (<em>e.g.</em> the scholar), can have no feeling for art, because he does not possess the primitive force of art, which is the tyranny of inner riches: he who cannot give anything away cannot feel anything either.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Perfection&rdquo;</em>—In these states (more particularly in the case of sexual love) there is an ingenuous betrayal of what the profoundest instinct regards as the highest, the most desirable, the most valuable, the ascending movement of its type; also of the condition towards which it is actually striving. Perfection: the extraordinary expansion of this instinct&rsquo;s feeling of power, its riches, its necessary overflowing of all banks.</p>
<ol start="802">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Art reminds us of states of physical vigour: it may be the overflow and bursting forth of blooming life in the world of pictures and desires; on the other hand, it may be an excitation of the physical functions by means of pictures and desires of exalted life—an enhancement of the feeling of life, the latter&rsquo;s stimulant.</p>
<p>To what extent can ugliness exercise this power? In so far as it may communicate something of the triumphant energy of the artist who has become master of the ugly and the repulsive; or in so far as it gently excites our lust of cruelty (in some circumstances even the lust of doing harm to ourselves, self-violence, and therewith the feeling of power over ourselves).</p>
<ol start="803">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty&rdquo; therefore is, to the artist, something which is above all order of rank, because in beauty contrasts are overcome, the highest sign of power thus manifesting itself in the conquest of opposites; and achieved without a feeling of tension: violence being no longer necessary, everything submitting and obeying so easily, and doing so with good grace; this is what delights the powerful will of the artist.</p>
<ol start="804">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The biological value of <em>beauty</em> and <em>ugliness.</em> That which we feel instinctively opposed to us æsthetically is, according to the longest experience of mankind, felt to be harmful, dangerous, and worthy of suspicion: the sudden utterance of the æsthetic instinct, <em>e.g.</em> in the case of loathing, implies an act of judgment. To this extent beauty lies within the general category of the biological values, useful, beneficent, and life-promoting: thus, a host of stimuli which for ages have been associated with, and remind us of, useful things and conditions, give us the feeling of beauty, <em>i.e.</em> the increase of the feeling of power (not only things, therefore, but the sensations which are associated with such things or their symbols). In this way beauty and ugliness are recognised as determined by our most fundamental self-preservative values. Apart from this, it is nonsense to postulate anything as beautiful or ugly. Absolute beauty exists just as little as absolute goodness and truth. In a particular case it is a matter of the self-preservative conditions of a certain type of man: thus the gregarious man will have quite a different feeling for beauty from the exceptional or super-man.</p>
<p>It is the optics of things in the foreground which only consider immediate consequences, from which the value beauty (also goodness and truth) arises.</p>
<p>All instinctive judgments are short-sighted in regard to the concatenation of consequences: they merely advise what must be done forthwith. Reason is essentially an obstructing apparatus preventing the immediate response to instinctive judgments: it halts, it calculates, it traces the chain of consequences further.</p>
<p>Judgments concerning beauty and ugliness are short-sighted (reason is always opposed to them): but they are convincing in the highest degree; they appeal to our instincts in that quarter where the latter decide most quickly and say yes or no with least hesitation, even before reason can interpose.</p>
<p>The most common affirmations of beauty stimulate each other reciprocally; where the æsthetic impulse once begins to work, a whole host of other and foreign perfections crystallise around the &ldquo;particular form of beauty.&rdquo; It is impossible to remain objective, it is certainly impossible to dispense with the interpreting, bestowing, transfiguring, and poetising power (the latter is a stringing together of affirmations concerning beauty itself). The sight of a beautiful woman&hellip;.</p>
<p>Thus (1) judgment concerning beauty is short-sighted; it sees only the immediate consequences.</p>
<p>(2) It smothers the object which gives rise to it with a charm that is determined by the association of various judgments concerning beauty, which, however, are quite alien to the <em>essence of the particular object.</em> To regard a thing as beautiful is necessarily to regard it falsely (that is why incidentally love marriages are from the social point of view the most unreasonable form of matrimony).</p>
<ol start="805">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Concerning the genesis of Art.</em> That making perfect and seeing perfect, which is peculiar to the cerebral system overladen with sexual energy (a lover alone with his sweetheart at eventide transfigures the smallest details: life is a chain of sublime things, &ldquo;the misfortune of an unhappy love affair is more valuable than anything else&rdquo;); on the other hand, everything perfect and beautiful operates like an unconscious recollection of that amorous condition and of the point of view peculiar to it—all perfection, and the whole of the beauty of things, through contiguity, revives aphrodisiac bliss. (Physiologically it is the creative instinct of the artist and the distribution of his semen in his blood.) The desire for art and beauty is an indirect longing for the ecstasy; of sexual desire, which gets communicated to the brain. The world become perfect through &ldquo;love.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="806">
<li></li>

<p><em>Sensuality in its various disguises.</em>—(1) As idealism (Plato), common to youth, constructing a kind of concave-mirror in which the image of the beloved is an incrustation, an exaggeration, a transfiguration, an attribution of infinity to everything. (2) In the religion of love, &ldquo;a fine young man,&rdquo; &ldquo;a beautiful woman,&rdquo; in some way divine; a bridegroom, a bride of the soul. (3) In art, as a decorating force, <em>e.g.</em> just as the man sees the woman and makes her a present of everything that can enhance her personal charm, so the sensuality of the artist adorns an object with everything else that he honours and esteems, and by this means perfects it (or idealises it). Woman, knowing what man feels in regard to her, tries to meet his idealising endeavours half-way by decorating herself, by walking and dancing well, by expressing delicate thoughts: in addition, she may practise modesty, shyness, reserve—prompted by her instinctive feeling that the idealising power of man increases with all this, (In the extraordinary finesse of woman&rsquo;s instincts, modesty must not by any means be considered as conscious hypocrisy: she guesses that it is precisely artlessness and real shame which seduces man most and urges him to an exaggerated esteem of her. On this account, woman is ingenuous, owing to the subtlety of her instincts which reveal to her the utility of a state of innocence. A wilful closing of one&rsquo;s eyes to one&rsquo;s self&hellip;. Wherever dissembling has a stronger influence by being unconscious it actually becomes unconscious.)</p>

<p>What a host of things can be accomplished by the state of intoxication which is called by the name of love, and which is something else besides love!—And yet everybody has his own experience of this matter. The muscular strength of a girl suddenly increases as soon as a man comes into her presence: there are instruments with which this can be measured. In the case of a still closer relationship of the sexes, as, for instance, in dancing and in other amusements which society gatherings entail, this power increases to such an extent as to make real feats of strength possible: at last one no longer trusts either one&rsquo;s eyes, or one&rsquo;s watch! Here at all events we must reckon with the fact that dancing itself, like every form of rapid movement, involves a kind of intoxication of the whole nervous, muscular, and visceral system. We must therefore reckon in this case with the collective effects of a double intoxication.—And how clever it is to be a little off your head at times! There are some realities which we cannot admit even to ourselves: especially when; we are women and have all sorts of feminine, *&ldquo;pudeurs.&rdquo;&hellip;*Those young creatures dancing over there are obviously beyond all reality: they are dancing only with a host of tangible ideals: what is more, they even see ideals sitting around them, their mothers!&hellip; An opportunity for quoting <em>Faust.</em> They look incomparably fairer, do these pretty creatures, when they have lost their head a little; and how well they know it too, they are even more delightful <em>because</em> they know it! Lastly, it is their finery which inspires them; their finery is their third little intoxication. They believe in their dressmaker as in their God: and who would destroy this faith in them? Blessed is this faith! And self-admiration is healthy! Self-admiration can protect one even from cold! Has a beautiful woman, who knew she was well-dressed, ever caught cold? Never yet on this earth! I even suppose a case in which she has scarcely a rag on her.</p>
<ol start="808">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If one should require the most astonishing proof of how far the power of transfiguring, which comes of intoxication, goes, this proof is at hand in the phenomenon of love; or what is called love in all the languages and silences of the world. Intoxication works to such a degree upon reality in this passion that in the consciousness of the lover the cause of his love is quite suppressed, and something else seems to take its place,—a vibration and a glitter of all the charm-mirrors of Circe&hellip;. In this respect to be man or an animal makes no difference: and still less does spirit, goodness, or honesty. If one is astute, one is befooled astutely; if one is thick-headed, one is befooled in a thick-headed way. But love, even the love of God, saintly love, &ldquo;the love that saves the soul,&rdquo; are at bottom all one; they are nothing but a fever which has reasons to transfigure itself—a state of intoxication which does well to lie about itself&hellip;. And, at any rate, when a man loves, he is a good liar about himself and to himself: he seems to himself transfigured, stronger, richer, more perfect; he <em>is</em> more perfect&hellip;. <em>Art</em> here acts as an organic function: we find it present in the most angelic instinct &ldquo;love&rdquo;; we find it as the greatest stimulus of life—thus art is sublimely utilitarian, even in the fact that it lies&hellip;. But we should be wrong to halt at its power to lie: it does more than merely imagine; it actually transposes values. And it not only transposes the <em>feeling</em> for values: the lover actually <em>has</em> a greater value; he is stronger. In animals this condition gives rise to new weapons, colours, pigments, and forms, and above all to new movements, new rhythms, new love-calls and seductions. In man it is just the same. His whole economy is richer, mightier, and <em>more complete</em> when he is in love than when he is not. The lover becomes a spendthrift; he is rich enough for it. He now dares; he becomes an adventurer, and even a donkey in magnanimity and innocence; his belief in God and in virtue revives, because he believes in love. Moreover, such idiots of happiness acquire wings and new capacities, and even the door to art is opened to them.</p>
<p>If we cancel the suggestion of this intestinal fever from the lyric of tones and words, what is left to poetry and music? &hellip; <em>L&rsquo;art pour l&rsquo;art</em> perhaps; the professional cant of frogs shivering outside in the cold, and dying of despair in their swamp&hellip;. Everything else was created by love.</p>
<ol start="809">

</ol>
<p>All art works like a suggestion on the muscles and the senses which were originally active in the ingenuous artistic man; its voice is only heard by artists—it speaks to this kind of man, whose constitution is attuned to such subtlety in sensitiveness. The concept &ldquo;layman&rdquo; is a misnomer. The deaf man is not a subdivision of the class, whose ears are sound. All art works as a <em>tonic;</em> it increases strength, it kindles desire <em>(i.e.</em> the feeling of strength), it excites all the more subtle recollections of intoxication; there is actually a special kind of memory which underlies such states—a distant flitful world of sensations here returns to being.</p>
<p>Ugliness is the contradiction of art. It is that which art <em>excludes,</em> the <em>negation</em> of art: wherever decline, impoverishment of life, impotence, decomposition, dissolution, are felt, however remotely, the æsthetic man reacts with his <em>No.</em> Ugliness <em>depresses</em>: it is the sign of depression. It <em>robs</em> strength, it impoverishes, it weighs down, &hellip; Ugliness <em>suggests</em> repulsive things. From one&rsquo;s states of health one can test how an indisposition may increase one&rsquo;s power of fancying ugly things. One&rsquo;s selection of things, interests, and questions becomes different. Logic provides a state which is next of kin to ugliness: heaviness, bluntness. In the presence of ugliness equilibrium is lacking in a mechanical sense: ugliness limps and stumbles—the direct opposite of the godly agility of the dancer.</p>
<p>The æsthetic state represents an overflow <em>of means of communication</em> as well as a condition of extreme sensibility to stimuli and signs. It is the zenith of communion and transmission between living creatures; it is the source of languages. In it, languages, whether of signs, sounds, or glances, have their birthplace. The richer phenomenon is always the beginning: our abilities are subtilised forms of richer abilities. But even to-day we still listen with our muscles, we even read with our muscles.</p>
<p>Every mature art possesses a host of conventions as a basis: in so far as it is a language. Convention is a condition of great art, <em>not</em> an obstacle to it&hellip;. Every elevation of life likewise elevates the power of communication, as also the understanding of man. <em>The power of living in other people&rsquo;s souls</em> originally had nothing to do with morality, but with a physiological irritability of suggestion: &ldquo;sympathy,&rdquo; or what is called &ldquo;altruism,&rdquo; is merely a product of that psycho-motor relationship which is reckoned as spirituality (psycho-motor induction, says Charles Féré). People never communicate a thought to one another: they communicate a movement, an imitative sign which is then interpreted as a thought.</p>
<ol start="810">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Compared with music,</em> communication by means of words is a shameless mode of procedure; words reduce and stultify; words make impersonal; words make common that which is uncommon.</p>
<ol start="811">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is exceptional states that determine the artist—such states as are all intimately related and entwined with morbid symptoms, so that it would seem almost impossible to be an artist without being ill.</p>
<p>The physiological conditions which in the artist become moulded into a &ldquo;personality,&rdquo; and which, to a certain degree, may attach themselves to any man:—</p>
<p>(1) Intoxication, the feeling of enhanced power; the inner compulsion to make things a mirror of one&rsquo;s own fulness and perfection.</p>
<p>(2) The extreme sharpness of certain senses, so that they are capable of understanding a totally different language of signs—and to create such a language (this is a condition which manifests itself in some nervous diseases); extreme susceptibility out of which great powers of communion are developed; the desire to speak on the part of everything that is capable of making-signs; a need of being rid of one&rsquo;s self by means of gestures and attitudes; the ability of speaking about one&rsquo;s self in a hundred different languages—in fact, a state of <em>explosion.</em></p>
<p>One must first imagine this condition as one in which there is a pressing and compulsory desire of ridding one&rsquo;s self of the ecstasy of a state of tension, by all kinds of muscular work and movement; also as an involuntary <em>co-ordination</em> of these movements with inner processes (images, thoughts, desires)—as a kind of automatism of the whole muscular system under the compulsion of strong stimuli acting from within; the inability to resist reaction; the apparatus of resistance is also suspended. Every inner movement (feeling, thought, emotion) is accompanied by <em>vascular changes,</em> and consequently by changes in colour, temperature, and secretion. The suggestive power of music, its &ldquo;<em>suggestion mentale.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>(3) <em>The compulsion to imitate:</em> extreme irritability, by means of which a certain example becomes contagious—a condition is guessed and represented merely by means of a few signs&hellip;. A complete picture is visualised by one&rsquo;s inner consciousness, and its effect soon shows itself in the movement of the limbs,—in a certain suspension of the <em>will</em> (Schopenhauer!!!!). A sort of blindness and deafness towards the external world,—the realm of admitted stimuli is sharply defined.</p>
<p>This differentiates the artist from the layman (from the spectator of art): the latter reaches the height of his excitement in the mere act of apprehending: the former in giving—and in such a way that the antagonism between these two gifts is not only natural but even desirable. Each of these states has an opposite standpoint—to demand of the artist that he should have the point of view of the spectator (of the critic) is equivalent to asking him to impoverish his creative power&hellip;. In this respect the same difference holds good as that which exists between the sexes: one should not ask the artist who gives to become a woman—to <em>&ldquo;receive.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Our æsthetics have hitherto been women&rsquo;s æsthetics, inasmuch as they have only formulated the experiences of what is beautiful, from the point of view of the receivers in art. In the whole of philosophy hitherto the artist has been lacking &hellip; <em>i.e.</em> as we have already suggested, a necessary fault: for the artist who would begin to understand himself would therewith begin to mistake himself—he must not look backwards, he must not look at all; he must give.—It is an honour for an artist to have no critical faculty; if he can criticise he is mediocre, he is modern.</p>
<ol start="812">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Here I lay down a series of psychological states as signs of flourishing and complete life, which to-day we are in the habit of regarding as morbid. But, by this time, we have broken ourselves of the habit of speaking of healthy and morbid as opposites: the question is one of degree, what I maintain on this point is that what people call healthy nowadays represents a lower level of that which under favourable circumstances actually would be healthy—that we are relatively sick&hellip;.</p>
<p>The artist belongs to a much stronger race. That which in us would be harmful and sickly, is natural in him. But people object to this that it is precisely the impoverishment of the machine which renders this extraordinary power of comprehending every kind of suggestion possible: <em>e.g.</em> our hysterical females.</p>
<p>An overflow of spunk and energy may quite as well lead to symptoms of partial constraint, sense hallucinations, peripheral sensitiveness, as a poor vitality does—the stimuli are differently determined, the effect is the same&hellip;. What is not the same is above all the ultimate result; the extreme torpidity of all morbid natures, after their nervous eccentricities, has nothing in common with the states of the artist, who need in no wise repent his best moments&hellip;. He is rich enough for it all: he can squander without becoming poor.</p>
<p>Just as we now feel justified in judging genius as a form of neurosis, we may perhaps think the same of artistic suggestive power,—and our artists are, as a matter of fact, only too closely related to hysterical females!!! This, however, is only an argument against the present day, and not against artists in general.</p>
<p>The inartistic states are: objectivity, reflection suspension of the will &hellip; (Schopenhauer&rsquo;s scandalous misunderstanding consisted in regarding art as a mere bridge to the denial of life)&hellip; The inartistic states are: those which impoverish, which subtract, which bleach, under which life suffers—the Christian.</p>
<ol start="813">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The modern artist who, in his physiology, is next of kin to the hysteric, may also be classified as a character belonging to this state of morbidness. The hysteric is false,—he lies from the love of lying, he is admirable in all the arts of dissimulation,—unless his morbid vanity hood-wink him. This vanity is like a perpetual fever which is in need of stupefying drugs, and which recoils from no self-deception and no farce that promises it the most fleeting satisfaction. (The incapacity for pride and the need of continual revenge for his deep-rooted self-contempt, this is almost the definition of this man&rsquo;s vanity.)</p>
<p>The absurd irritability of his system, which makes a crisis out of every one of his experiences, and sees dramatic elements in the most insignificant occurrences of life, deprives him of all calm reflection; he ceases from being a personality, at most he is a rendezvous of personalities of which first one and then the other asserts itself with barefaced assurance. Precisely on this account he is great as an actor <em>i</em> all these poor will-less people, whom doctors study so profoundly, astound one through their virtuosity in mimicking, in transfiguration, in their assumption of almost any character required.</p>
<ol start="814">

<p>Artists are not men of great passion, despite all their assertions to the contrary both to themselves and to others. And for the following two reasons: they lack all shyness towards themselves (they watch themselves live, they spy upon themselves, they are much too inquisitive), and they also lack shyness in the presence of passion (as artists they exploit it). Secondly, however, that vampire, their talent, generally forbids them such an expenditure of energy as passion demands.—A man, who has a talent is sacrificed to that talent; he lives under the vampirism of his talent.</p>
<p>A man does not get rid of his passion by reproducing it, but rather he is rid of it if he is able to reproduce it. (Goethe teaches the reverse, but it seems as though he deliberately misunderstood himself here—from a sense of delicacy.)</p>

<p><em>Concerning a reasonable mode of life.</em>—.Relative, chastity, a fundamental and shrewd caution in regard to <em>erotica,</em> even in thought, may be a reasonable mode of life even in richly equipped and perfect natures. But this principle applies more particularly to artists; it belongs to the best wisdom of their lives. Wholly trustworthy voices have already been raised in favour of this view, <em>e.g.</em> Stendhal, Th. Gautier, and Flaubert. The artist is perhaps in his way necessarily a sensual man, generally susceptible, accessible to everything, and capable of responding to the remotest stimulus or suggestion of a stimulus. Nevertheless, as a rule he is in the power of his work, of his will to mastership, really a sober and often even a chaste man. His dominating instinct will have him so: it does not allow him to spend himself haphazardly. It is one and the same form of strength which is spent in artistic conception and in the sexual act: there is only one form of strength. The artist who yields in this respect, and who spends himself, is betrayed: by so doing he reveals his lack of instinct, his lack of will in general. It may be a sign of decadence,—in any case it reduces the value of his art to an incalculable degree.</p>
<ol start="816">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Compared with the artist, the scientific man, regarded as a phenomenon, is indeed a sign of a certain storing-up and levelling-down of life (but also of an increase of strength, severity, hardness, and will-power). To what extent can falsity and indifference towards truth and utility be a sign of youth, of childishness, in the artist? &hellip; Their habitual manner, their unreasonableness, their ignorance of themselves, their indifference to &ldquo;eternal values,&rdquo; their seriousness in play, their lack of dignity; clowns and gods in one; the saint and the rabble&hellip;. Imitation as an imperious instinct.—Do not artists of ascending life and artists of degeneration belong to all phases? &hellip; Yes!</p>
<ol start="817">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Would any link be missing in the whole chain of science and art, if woman, if woman&rsquo;s work, were excluded from it? Let us acknowledge the exception—it proves the rule—that woman is capable of perfection in everything which does not constitute a work: in letters, in memoirs, in the most intricate handiwork—in short, in everything which is not a craft; and just precisely because in the things mentioned woman perfects herself, because in them she obeys the only artistic impulse in her nature,—which is to captivate&hellip;. But what has woman to do with the passionate indifference of the genuine artist who sees more importance in a breath, in a sound, in the merest trifle, than in himself?—who with all his five fingers gropes for his most secret and hidden treasures?—who attributes no value to anything unless it knows how to take shape (unless it surrenders itself, unless it visualises itself in some way). Art as it is practised by artists—do you not understand what it is? is it not an outrage on all <em>our pudeurs? &hellip;</em> Only in this century has woman dared to try her hand at literature (&quot;<em>Vers la canaille plumière écrivassière,&rdquo;</em> to speak with old Mirabeau): woman now writes, she now paints, she is losing her instincts. And to what purpose, if one may put such a question?</p>
<ol start="818">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A man is an artist to the extent to which he regards everything that inartistic people call &ldquo;form&rdquo; as the actual substance, as the &ldquo;principal&rdquo; thing. With such ideas a man certainly belongs to a world upside down: for henceforward substance seems to him something merely formal,—his own life included.</p>
<ol start="819">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A sense for, and a delight in, nuances (which is characteristic of modernity), in that which is not general, runs counter to the instinct which finds its joy and its strength in grasping what is typical: like Greek taste in its best period. In this there is an overcoming of the plenitude of life; restraint dominates, the peace of the strong soul which is slow to move and which feels a certain repugnance towards excessive activity is defeated. The general rule, the law, is honoured and made prominent, conversely, the exception is laid aside, and shades are suppressed. All that which is firm, mighty, solid, life resting on a broad and powerful basis, concealing its strength this pleases: <em>i.e.</em> it corresponds with what we think of ourselves.</p>
<ol start="820">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In the main I am much more in favour of artists than any philosopher that has appeared hitherto: artists, at least, did not lose sight of the great course which life pursues; they loved the things &ldquo;of this world,&quot;—they loved their senses. To strive after &ldquo;spirituality,&rdquo; in cases where this is not pure hypocrisy or self-deception, seems to me to be either a misunderstanding, a disease, or a cure, I wish myself, and all those who live without the troubles of a puritanical conscience, and who are able to live in this way, an ever greater spiritualisation and multiplication of the senses. Indeed, we would fain be grateful to the senses for their subtlety, power, and plenitude, and on that account offer them the best we have in the way of spirit. What do we care about priestly and metaphysical anathemas upon the senses? We no longer require to treat them in this way: it is a sign of well-constitutedness when a man like Goethe clings with ever greater joy and heartiness to the &ldquo;things of this world&rdquo;—in this way he holds firmly to the grand concept of mankind, which is that man becomes the glorifying power of existence when he learns to glorify himself.</p>
<ol start="821">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Pessimism in art?</em>—The artist gradually learns to like for their own sake, those means which bring about the condition of æsthetic elation; extreme delicacy and glory of colour, definite delineation, quality of tone; distinctness where in normal conditions distinctness is absent. All distinct things, all nuances, in so far as they recall extreme degrees of power which give rise to intoxication, kindle this feeling of intoxication by association;—the effect of works of art is the excitation of the state which creates art, of æsthetic intoxication.</p>
<p>The essential feature in art is its power of perfecting existence, its production of perfection and plenitude; art is essentially the affirmation, the blessing, and the deification of existence&hellip;. What does a pessimistic art signify? Is it not a <em>contradictio</em>?—Yes.—Schopenhauer is in error when he makes certain works of art serve the purpose of pessimism. Tragedy does not teach &ldquo;resignation.&rdquo; &hellip; To represent terrible and questionable things is, in itself, the sign of an instinct of power and magnificence in the artist; he doesn&rsquo;t fear them&hellip;. There is no such thing as a pessimistic, art&hellip;. Art affirms. Job affirms. But Zola? and the Goncourts?—the things they show us are ugly, their reason, however, for showing them to us is their love of ugliness &hellip; I don&rsquo;t care what you say! You simply deceive yourselves if you think otherwise.—What a relief Dostoievsky is!</p>
<ol start="822">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If I have sufficiently initiated my readers into the doctrine that even &ldquo;goodness,&rdquo; in the whole comedy of existence, represents a form of exhaustion, they will now credit Christianity with consistency for having conceived the good to be the ugly. In this respect Christianity was right.</p>
<p>It is absolutely unworthy of a philosopher to say that &ldquo;the good and the beautiful are one&rdquo;; if he should add &ldquo;and also the true,&rdquo; he deserves to be thrashed. Truth is ugly.</p>
<p>Art is with us in order that we may not perish through truth.</p>

<p>Moralising tendencies may be combated with art. Art is freedom from moral bigotry and philosophy <em>à la</em> Little Jack Horner: or it may be the mockery of these things. The flight to Nature, where beauty and terribleness are coupled. The concept of the great man.</p>
<p>—Fragile, useless souls-de-luxe, which are disconcerted by a mere breath of wind, &ldquo;beautiful souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>—Ancient ideals, in their inexorable hardness and brutality, ought to be awakened, as the mightiest of monsters that they are.</p>
<p>—We should feel a boisterous delight in the psychological perception of how all moralised artists become worms and actors without knowing it.</p>
<p>—The falsity of art, its immorality, must be brought into the light of day.</p>
<p>—The &ldquo;fundamental idealising powers&rdquo; (sensuality, intoxication, excessive animality) should be brought to light.</p>

<p>Modern counterfeit practices in the arts: regarded as necessary—that is to say, as fully in keeping with the needs most proper to the modern soul.</p>
<p>The gaps in the gifts, and still more in the education, antecedents, and schooling of modern artists, are now filled up in this way:—</p>
<p><em>First:</em> A less artistic public is sought which is capable of unlimited love (and is capable of falling on its knees before a personality). The superstition of our century, the belief in &ldquo;genius,&rdquo; assists this process.</p>
<p><em>Secondly;</em> Artists harangue the dark instincts of the dissatisfied, the ambitious, and the self-deceivers of a democratic age: the importance of poses.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly:</em> The procedures of one art are transferred to the realm of another; the object of art is confounded with that of science, with that of the Church, or with that of the interests of the race (nationalism), or with that of philosophy—a man rings all bells at once, and awakens the vague suspicion that he is a god.</p>
<p><em>Fourthly:</em> Artists flatter women, sufferers, and indignant folk. Narcotics and opiates are made to preponderate in art. The fancy of cultured people, and of the readers of poetry and ancient history, is tickled.</p>

<p>We must distinguish between the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and the &ldquo;select&rdquo;; to satisfy the public a man must be a charlatan to-day, to satisfy the select he <em>will</em> be a virtuoso and nothing else. The geniuses peculiar to our century overcame this distinction, they were great for both; the great charlatanry of Victor Hugo and Richard Wagner was coupled with such genuine virtuosity that it even satisfied the most refined artistic connoisseurs. This is why greatness is lacking: these geniuses had a double outlook; first, they catered for the coarsest needs, and then for the most refined.</p>

<p>False &ldquo;accentuation&rdquo;: (1) In romanticism, this unremitting &ldquo;<em>expressivo</em>&rdquo; is not a sign of strength, but of a feeling of deficiency;</p>
<p>(2) Picturesque music, the so-called dramatic kind, is above all easier (as is also the brutal scandalmongering and the juxtaposition of facts and traits in realistic novels);</p>
<p>(3) &ldquo;Passion&rdquo; as a matter of nerves and exhausted souls; likewise the delight in high mountains, deserts, storms, orgies, and disgusting details,—in bulkiness and massiveness (historians, for instance); as a matter of fact, there is actually a cult of exaggerated feelings (how is it that in stronger ages art desired just the opposite—a restraint of passion?);</p>
<p>(4) The preference for exciting materials (<em>Erotica</em> or <em>Socialistica</em> or <em>Pathologica</em>): all these things are the signs of the style of public that is being catered for to-day—that is to say, for overworked, absentminded, or enfeebled people.</p>

<p>Modern art is the art of tyrannising. A coarse and salient definiteness in delineation; the motive simplified into a formula; formulæ tyrannise. Wild arabesques within the lines; overwhelming masses, before which the senses are confused; brutality in coloration, in subject-matter, in the desires. Examples: Zola, Wagner, and, in a more spiritualised degree, Taine. Hence logic, massiveness, and brutality.</p>

<p>In regard to the painter: <em>Tous ces modernes sont des poètes qui ont voulu être peintres, L&rsquo;un a cherché des drames dans l&rsquo;histoire, l&rsquo;autre des scènes de mœurs, celui ci traduit des religions, celui là une philosophie.</em> One imitates Raphael, another the early Italian masters. The landscapists employ trees and clouds in order to make odes and elegies. Not one is simply a painter; they are all archæologists, psychologists, and impresarios of one or another kind of event or theory. They enjoy our erudition and our philosophy. Like us, they are full, and too full, of general ideas. They like a form, not because it is what it is, but because of what it expresses. They are the scions of a learned, tormented, and reflecting generation, a thousand miles away from the Old Masters who never read, and only concerned themselves with feasting their eyes.</p>

<p>At bottom, even Wagner&rsquo;s music, in so far as it stands for the whole of French romanticism, is literature: the charm of exoticism (strange times, customs, passions), exercised upon sensitive cosy-corner people. The delight of entering into extremely distant and prehistoric lands to which books lead one, and by which means the whole horizon is painted with new colours and new possibilities&hellip;. Dreams of still more distant and unexploited worlds; disdain of the boulevards. &hellip; For Nationalism, let us not deceive ourselves, is also only a form of exoticism&hellip;. Romantic musicians merely relate what exotic books have made of them: people would fain experience exotic sensations and passions according to Florentine and Venetian taste; finally they are satisfied to look for them in an image&hellip;. The essential factor is the kind of novel desire, the desire to imitate, the desire to live as people have lived once before in the past, and the disguise and dissimulation of the soul&hellip;. Romantic art is only an emergency exit from defective &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attempt to perform new things: revolution, Napoleon. Napoleon represents the passion of new spiritual possibilities, of an extension of the soul&rsquo;s domain.</p>
<p>The greater the debility of the will, the greater the extravagances in the desire to feel, to represent, and to dream new things.—The result of the excesses which have been indulged in: an insatiable thirst for unrestrained feelings&hellip;. Foreign literatures afford the strongest spices.</p>

<p><em>Offenbach;</em> trench music imbued with Voltaire&rsquo;s intellect, free, wanton, with a slight sardonic grin, but clear and intellectual almost to the point of banality (Offenbach never titivates), and free from the <em>mignardise</em> of morbid or blond-Viennese sensuality.</p>
<ol start="834">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If by artistic genius we understand the most consummate freedom within the law, divine ease, and facility in overcoming the greatest difficulties, then Offenbach has even more right to the title genius than Wagner has. Wagner is heavy and clumsy: nothing is more foreign to him than the moments of wanton perfection which this clown Offenbach achieves as many as five times, six times, in nearly every one of his buffooneries. But by genius we ought perhaps to understand something else.</p>

<p><em>Concerning &ldquo;music.&quot;</em>—French, German, and Italian music. (Our most debased periods in a political sense are our most productive. The Slavs?)—The ballet, which is the outcome of excessive study of the history of strange civilisations, has become master of opera.—Stage music and musicians music.—It is an error to suppose that what Wagner composed was <em>a. form</em>: it was rather formlessness. The possibilities of dramatic construction have yet to be discovered.—Rhythm. &ldquo;Expression&rdquo; at all costs. Harlotry in instrumentation.—All honour to Heinrich Schütz; all honour to Mendelssohn: in them we find an element of Goethe, but nowhere else! (We also find another element of Goethe coming to blossom in Rahel; a third element in Heinrich Heine.)</p>

<p>Descriptive music leaves reality to work its effects alone&hellip;. All these kinds of art are easier, and more easy to imitate; poorly gifted people have recourse to them. The appeal to the instincts; suggestive art.</p>

<p><em>Concerning our modern music.</em>—The decay of melody, like the decay of &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo; and of the freedom of intellectual activity, is a piece of clumsiness and obtuseness, which is developing itself into new feats of daring and even into principles;—in the end man has only the principles of his gifts, or of his lack of gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dramatic music&rdquo;—nonsense! It is simply bad music&hellip;. &ldquo;Feeling&rdquo; and &ldquo;passion&rdquo; are merely substitutes when lofty intellectuality and the joy of it (<em>e.g.</em> Voltaire&rsquo;s) can no longer be attained. Expressed technically, feeling and &ldquo;passion&rdquo; are easier; they presuppose a much poorer kind of artist. The recourse to drama betrays that an artist is much more a master in tricky means than in genuine ones. To-day we have both dramatic painting and dramatic poetry, etc.</p>

<p>What we lack in music is an æsthetic which would impose laws upon musicians and give them a conscience; and as a result of this we lack a real contest concerning &ldquo;principles.&quot;—For as musicians we laugh at Herbart&rsquo;s velleities in this department just as heartily as we laugh at Schopenhauer&rsquo;s. As a matter of fact, tremendous difficulties present themselves here. We no longer know on what basis to found our concepts of what is exemplary, masterly, perfect. With the instincts of old loves and old admiration we grope about in a realm of values, and we almost believe, &ldquo;that is good which pleases us&rdquo;&hellip;. I am always suspicious when I hear people everywhere speak innocently of Beethoven as a &ldquo;classic&rdquo;; what I would maintain, and with some seventy, is that, in other arts, a classic is the very reverse of Beethoven. But when the complete and glaring dissolution of style, Wagner&rsquo;s so-called dramatic style, is taught and honoured as exemplary, as masterly, as progressive, then my impatience exceeds all bounds. Dramatic style in music, as Wagner understood it, is simply renunciation of all style whatever; it is the assumption that something else, namely, drama, is a hundred times more important than music. Wagner can paint; he does not use music for the sake of music, with it he accentuates attitudes; he is a poet. Finally he made an appeal to beautiful feelings and heaving breasts, just as all other theatrical artists have done, and with it all he converted women and even those whose souls thirst for culture to him. But what do women and the uncultured care about music? All these people have no conscience for art: none of them suffer when the first and fundamental virtues of an art are scorned and trodden upon in favour of that which is merely secondary (as <em>ancilla dramaturgica</em>). What good can come of all extension in the means of expression, when that which is expressed, art itself, has lost all its law and order? The picturesque pomp and power of tones, the symbolism of sound, rhythm, the colour effects of harmony and discord, the suggestive significance of music, the whole sensuality of this art which Wagner made prevail—it is all this that Wagner derived, developed, and drew out of music. Victor Hugo did something very similar for language: but already people in France are asking themselves, in regard to the case of Victor Hugo, whether language was not corrupted by him, whether reason, intellectuality, and thorough conformity to law in language are not suppressed when the sensuality of expression is elevated to a high place? Is it not a sign of decadence that the poets in France have become plastic artists, and that the musicians of Germany have become actors and culturemongers?</p>

<p>To-day there exists a sort of musical pessimism even among people who are not musicians. Who has not met and cursed the confounded youthlet who torments his piano until it shrieks with despair, and who single-handed heaves the slime of the most lugubrious and drabby harmonies before him? By so doing a man betrays himself as a pessimist&hellip;. It is open to question, though, whether he also proves himself a musician by this means. I for my part could never be made to believe it. Wagnerite <em>pur sang</em> is unmusical, he submits to the elementary forces of music very much as a woman submits to the will of the man who hypnotises her—and in order to be able to do this he must not be made suspicious <em>in rebus musicis et musicantibus</em> by a too severe or too delicate conscience. I said &ldquo;very much as&rdquo;—but in this respect I spoke perhaps more than a parable. Let any one consider the means which Wagner uses by preference, when he wishes to make an effect (means which for the greater part he first had to invent), they are appallingly similar to the means by which a hypnotist exercises his power (the choice of his movements, the general colour of his orchestration; the excruciating evasion of consistency, and fairness and squareness, in rhythm; the creepiness, the soothing touch, the mystery, the hysteria of his &ldquo;unending melody&rdquo;). And is the condition to which the overture to <em>Lohengrin,</em> for instance, reduces the men, and still more the women, in the audience, so essentially different from the somnambulistic trance? On one occasion after the overture in question had been played, I heard an Italian lady say, with her eyes half closed, in a way in which female Wagnerites are adepts: &ldquo;<em>Come si dorme con questa musica!</em>&rdquo;[10]</p>

<p><em>Religion in music.</em>—What a large amount of satisfaction all religious needs get out of Wagnerian music, though this is never acknowledged or even understood! How much prayer, virtue, unction, virginity, salvation, speaks through this music!&hellip; Oh what capital this cunning saint, who leads and seduces us back to everything that was once believed in, makes out of the fact that he may dispense with words and concepts! &hellip; Our intellectual conscience has no need to feel ashamed—it stands apart—if any old instinct puts its trembling lips to the rim of forbidden philtres&hellip;. This is shrewd and healthy, and, in so far as it betrays a certain shame in regard to the satisfaction of the religious instinct, it is even a good sign&hellip;. Cunning Christianity: the type of the music which came from the &ldquo;last Wagner.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="841">

<p>I distinguish between courage before persons, courage before things, and courage on paper. The latter was the courage of David Strauss, for instance. I distinguish again between the courage before witnesses and the courage without witnesses: the courage of a Christian, or of believers in God in general, can never be the courage without witnesses—but on this score alone Christian courage stands condemned. Finally, I distinguish between the courage which is temperamental and the courage which is the fear of fear; a single instance of the latter kind is moral courage. To this list the courage of despair should be added.</p>
<p>This is the courage which Wagner possessed. His attitude in regard to music was at bottom a desperate one. He lacked two things which go to make up a good musician: nature and nurture, the predisposition for music and the discipline and schooling which music requires. He had courage: out of this deficiency he established a principle; he invented a kind of music for himself. The dramatic music which he invented was the music which he was able to compose,—its limitations are Wagner&rsquo;s limitations.</p>
<p>And he was misunderstood!—Was he really misunderstood?&hellip; Such is the case with five-sixths of the artists of to-day. Wagner is their Saviour: five-sixths, moreover, is the &ldquo;lowest proportion.&rdquo; In any case where Nature has shown herself without reserve, and wherever culture is an accident, a mere attempt, a piece of dilettantism, the artist turns instinctively—what do I say?—I mean enthusiastically, to Wagner; as the poet says: &ldquo;Half drew he him, and half sank he.&rdquo;[11]</p>
<p>[11] This is an adapted quotation from Goethe&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;The Fisherman.&rdquo; The translation is E. A. Bowring&rsquo;s.—Tr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Music&rdquo; and the grand style. The greatness of an artist is not to be measured by the beautiful feelings which he evokes: let this belief be left to the girls. It should be measured according to the extent to which he approaches the grand style, according to the extent to which he is capable of the grand style. This style and great passion have this in common—that they scorn to please; that they forget to persuade; that they command: that they will&hellip;. To become master of the chaos which is in one; to compel one&rsquo;s inner chaos to assume form; to become consistent, simple, unequivocal, mathematical, law this is the great ambition here. By means of it one repels; nothing so much endears people to such powerful men as this,—a desert seems to lie around them, they impose silence upon all, and awe every one with the greatness Of their sacrilege&hellip;. All arts know this kind of aspirant to the grand style: why are they absent in music? Never yet has a musician built as that architect did who erected the Palazzo Pitti&hellip;. This is a problem. Does music perhaps belong to that culture in which the reign of powerful men of various types is already at an end? Is the concept &ldquo;grand style&rdquo; in fact a contradiction of the soul of music,—of &ldquo;the Woman&rdquo; in our music? &hellip;</p>
<p>With this I touch upon the cardinal question: how should all our music be classified? The age of classical taste knows nothing that can be compared with it: it bloomed when the world of the Renaissance reached its evening, when &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; had already bidden farewell to both men and their customs—is it characteristic of music to be Counter-Renaissance? Is music, perchance, the sister of the baroque style, seeing that in any case they were contemporaries? Is not music, modern music, already decadence? &hellip;</p>
<p>I have put my finger before on this question: whether music is not an example of Counter-Renaissance art? whether it is not the next of kin to the baroque style? whether it has not grown in Opposition to all classic taste, so that any aspiration to classicism is forbidden by the very nature of music?</p>
<p>The answer to this most important of all questions of values would not be a very doubtful one, if people thoroughly understood the fact that music attains to its highest maturity and plenitude as romanticism—likewise as a reactionary movement against classicism.</p>
<p>Mozart, a delicate and lovable soul, but quite eighteenth century, even in his serious lapses &hellip; Beethoven, the first great romanticist according to the French conception of romanticism, just as Wagner is the last great romanticist &hellip; both of them are instinctive opponents of classical taste, of severe style—not to speak of &ldquo;grand&rdquo; in this regard.</p>
<ol start="843">

</ol>
<p>Romanticism: an ambiguous question, like all modern questions.</p>
<p>The æsthetic conditions are twofold:—</p>
<p>The abundant and generous, as opposed to the seeking and the desiring.</p>
<ol start="844">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A romanticist is an artist whose great dissatisfaction with himself makes him productive—; who looks away from himself and his fellows, and sometimes, therefore, looks backwards.</p>
<ol start="845">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Is art the result of dissatisfaction with reality? or is it the expression of gratitude for happiness experienced? In the first case, it is romanticism; in the second, it is glorification and dithyramb (in short, apotheosis art): even Raphael belongs to this, except for the fact that he was guilty of the duplicity of having defied the appearance of the Christian view of the world. He was thankful for life precisely where it was not exactly Christian.</p>
<p>With a moral interpretation the world is insufferable; Christianity was the attempt to overcome the world with morality: <em>i.e.</em> to deny it. <em>In praxi</em> such a mad experiment—an imbecile elevation of man above the world—could only end in the beglooming, the dwarfing, and the impoverishment of mankind: the only kind of man who gained anything by it, who was promoted by it, was the most mediocre, the most harmless and gregarious type.</p>
<p>Homer as an apotheosis artist; Rubens also. Music has not yet had such an artist.</p>
<p>The idealisation of the great criminal (the feeling for his greatness) is Greek; the depreciation, the slander, the contempt of the sinner, is Judæo-Christian.</p>
<ol start="846">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Romanticism and its opposite. In regard to all æsthetic values I now avail myself of this fundamental distinction: in every individual case I ask myself has hunger or has superabundance been creative here? At first another distinction might perhaps seem preferable, it is far more obvious,—<em>e.g.</em> the distinction which decides whether a desire for stability, for eternity, for Being, or whether a desire for destruction, for change, for Becoming, has been the cause of creation. But both kinds of desire, when examined more closely, prove to be ambiguous, and really susceptible of interpretation only according to that scheme already mentioned and which I think is rightly preferred.</p>
<p>The desire for destruction, for change, for Becoming, may be the expression of an overflowing power pregnant with promises for the future (my term for this, as is well known, is Dionysian); it may, however, also be the hate of the ill-constituted, of the needy and of the physiologically botched, that destroys, and must destroy, because such creatures are indignant at, and annoyed by everything lasting and stable.</p>
<p>The act of immortalising can, on the other hand, be the outcome of gratitude and love: an art which has this origin is always an apotheosis art; dithyrambic, as perhaps with Rubens, happy, as perhaps with Hafiz; bright and gracious, and shedding a ray of glory over all things, as in Goethe. But it may also, however, be the outcome of the tyrannical will of the great sufferer who would make the most personal, individual, and narrow trait about him, the actual idiosyncrasy of his pain—in fact, into a binding law and imposition, and who thus wreaks his revenge upon all things by stamping, branding, and violating them with the image of his torment. The latter case is romantic pessimism in its highest form, whether this be Schopenhauerian voluntarism or Wagnerian music.</p>
<ol start="847">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It is a question whether the antithesis, classic and romantic, does not conceal that other antithesis, the active and the reactive.</p>
<ol start="848">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to be a classic, one must be possessed of all the strong and apparently contradictory gifts and passions: but in such a way that they run in harness together, and culminate simultaneously in elevating a certain species of literature or art or politics to its height and zenith (they must not do this after that elevation has taken place &hellip;). They must reflect the complete state (either of a people or of a culture), and express its most profound and most secret nature, at a time when it is still stable and not yet discoloured by the imitation of foreign things (or when it is still dependent &hellip;); not a reactive but a deliberate and progressive spirit, saying Yea in all circumstances, even in its hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does not the highest personal value belong thereto?&rdquo; It is worth considering whether moral prejudices do not perhaps exercise their influence here, and whether great moral loftiness is not perhaps a contradiction of the classical? &hellip; Whether the moral monsters must not necessarily be romantic in word and deed? Any such preponderance of one virtue over others (as in the case of the moral monster) is precisely what with most hostility counteracts the classical power in equilibrium, supposing a people manifested this moral loftiness and were classical notwithstanding, we should have to conclude boldly that they were also on the same high level in immorality! this was perhaps the case with Shakespeare (provided that he was really Lord Bacon).</p>
<ol start="849">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Concerning the future. Against the romanticism of great passion.</em>—We must understand how a certain modicum of coldness, lucidity, and hardness is inseparable from all classical taste: above all consistency, happy intellectuality, &ldquo;the three unities,&rdquo; concentration, hatred of all feeling, of all sentimentality, of all <em>esprit,</em> hatred of all multiformity, of all uncertainty, evasiveness, and of all nebulosity, as also of all brevity, finicking, prettiness and good nature. Artistic formulæ must not be played with: life must be remodelled so that it should be forced to formulate itself accordingly.</p>
<p>It is really an exhilarating spectacle which we have only learned to laugh at quite recently, because we have only seen through it quite recently: this spectacle of Herder&rsquo;s, Winckelmann&rsquo;s, Goethe&rsquo;s, and Hegel&rsquo;s contemporaries claiming that they had rediscovered the classical ideal &hellip; and at the same time, Shakespeare! And this same crew of men had scurvily repudiated all relationship with the classical school of France! As if the essential principle could not have been learnt as well here as elsewhere! &hellip; But what people wanted was &ldquo;nature,&rdquo; and &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo;: Oh, the stupidity of it! It was thought that classicism was a kind of naturalness!</p>
<p>Without either prejudice or indulgence we should try and investigate upon what soil a classical taste can be evolved. The hardening, the simplification, the strengthening, and the bedevilling of man are inseparable from classical taste. Logical and psychological simplification. A contempt of detail, of complexity, of obscurity.</p>
<p>The romanticists of Germany do not protest against classicism, but against reason, against illumination, against taste, against the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The essence of romantico-Wagnerian music is the opposite of the classical spirit.</p>
<p>The will to unity (because unity tyrannises. <em>e.g.</em> the listener and the spectator), but the artist&rsquo;s inability to tyrannise over himself where it is most needed—that is to say, in regard to the work itself (in regard to knowing what to leave out, what to shorten, what to clarify, what to simplify). The overwhelming by means of masses (Wagner, Victor Hugo, Zola, Taine).</p>
<ol start="850">

</ol>
<p><em>The Nihilism of artists.</em>—Nature is cruel in her cheerfulness; cynical in her sunrises. We are hostile to emotions. We flee thither where Nature moves our senses and our imagination, where we have nothing to love, where we are not reminded of the moral semblances and delicacies of this northern nature; and the same applies to the arts. We prefer that which no longer reminds us of good and evil. Our moral sensibility and tenderness seem to be relieved in the heart of terrible and happy Nature, in the fatalism of the senses and forces. Life without goodness.</p>
<p>Great well-being arises from contemplating Nature&rsquo;s indifference to good and evil.</p>
<p>No justice in history, no goodness in Nature. That is why the pessimist when he is an artist prefers those historical subjects where the absence of justice reveals itself with magnificent simplicity, where perfection actually comes to expression—and likewise he prefers that in Nature, where her callous evil character is not hypocritically concealed, where that character is seen in perfection&hellip;. The Nihilistic artist betrays himself in willing and preferring cynical history and cynical Nature.</p>
<ol start="851">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What is tragic?—Again and again I have pointed to the great misunderstanding of Aristotle in maintaining that the tragic emotions were the two depressing emotions—fear and pity. Had he been right, tragedy would be an art unfriendly to life: it would have been necessary to caution people against it as against something generally harmful and suspicious. Art, otherwise the great stimulus of life, the great intoxicant of life, the great will to life, here became a tool of decadence, the hand-maiden of pessimism and ill-health (for to suppose, as Aristotle supposed, that by exciting these emotions we thereby purged people of them, is simply an error). Something which habitually excites fear or pity, disorganises, weakens, and discourages: and supposing Schopenhauer were right in thinking that tragedy taught resignation (<em>i.e.</em> a meek renunciation of happiness, hope, and of the will to live), this would presuppose an art in which art itself was denied. Tragedy would then constitute a process of dissolution; the instinct of life would destroy itself in the instinct of art. Christianity, Nihilism, tragic art, physiological decadence; these things would then be linked, they would then preponderate together and assist each other onwards—downwards&hellip;. Tragedy would thus be a symptom of decline.</p>
<p>This theory may be refuted in the most cold-blooded way, namely, by measuring the effect of a tragic emotion by means of a dynamometer The result would be a fact which only the bottomless falsity of a doctrinaire could misunderstand: that tragedy is a tonic. If Schopenhauer refuses to see the truth here, if he regards general depression as a tragic condition, if he would have informed the Greeks (who to his disgust were not &ldquo;resigned&rdquo;) that they did not firmly possess the highest principles of life: it is only owing to his <em>parti pris,</em> to the need of consistency in his system, to the dishonesty of the doctrinaire—that dreadful dishonesty which step for step corrupted the whole psychology of Schopenhauer (he who had arbitrarily and almost violently misunderstood genius, art itself, morality, pagan religion, beauty, knowledge, and almost everything).</p>
<ol start="852">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The tragic artist.</em>—Whether, and in regard to what, the judgment &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; is established is a question of an individual&rsquo;s or of a people&rsquo;s strength The feeling of plenitude, of overflowing strength (which gaily and courageously meets many an obstacle before which the weakling shudders)—the feeling of power utters the judgment &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; concerning things and conditions which the instinct of impotence can only value as hateful and ugly. The <em>flair</em> which enables us to decide whether the objects we encounter are dangerous, problematic, or alluring, likewise determines our æsthetic Yea. (&ldquo;This is beautiful,&rdquo; is an affirmation).</p>
<p>From this we see that, generally speaking, a preference for questionable and terrible things is a symptom of strength; whereas the taste for pretty and charming trifles is characteristic of the weak and the delicate. The love of tragedy is typical of strong ages and characters: its <em>non plus ultra</em> is perhaps the <em>Divina Commedia.</em> It is the heroic spirits which in tragic cruelty say Yea unto themselves: they are hard enough to feel pain as a pleasure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, supposing weaklings desire to get pleasure from an art which was not designed for them, what interpretation must we suppose they would like to give tragedy in order to make it suit their taste? They would interpret their own feeling of value into it: <em>e.g.</em> the &ldquo;triumph of the moral order of things,&rdquo; or the teaching of the &ldquo;uselessness of existence,&rdquo; or the incitement to &ldquo;resignation&rdquo; (or also half-medicinal and half-moral outpourings, <em>à la</em> Aristotle). Finally, the art of terrible natures, in so far as it may excite the nerves, may be regarded by the weak and exhausted as a stimulus: this is now taking place, for instance, in the case of the admiration meted out to Wagner&rsquo;s art. A test of man&rsquo;s well-being and consciousness of power is the extent to which he can acknowledge the terrible and questionable character of things, and whether he is in any need of a faith at the end.</p>
<p>This kind of artistic pessimism is precisely the reverse of that religio-moral pessimism which suffers from the corruption of man and the enigmatic character of existence: the latter insists upon deliverance, or at least upon the hope of deliverance. Those who suffer, doubt, and distrust themselves,—the sick, in other words,—have in all ages required the transporting influence of visions in order to be able to exist at all (the notion &ldquo;blessedness&rdquo; arose in this way). A similar case would be that of the artists of decadence, who at bottom maintain a Nihilistic attitude to life, and take refuge in the beauty of form,—in those select cases in which Nature is perfect, in which she is indifferently great and indifferently beautiful. (The &ldquo;love of the beautiful&rdquo; may thus be something very different from the ability to see or create the beautiful: it may be the expression of impotence in this respect.) The most convincing artists are those who make harmony ring out of every discord, and who benefit all things by the gift of their power and inner harmony: in every work of art they merely reveal the symbol of their inmost experiences—their creation is gratitude for life.</p>
<p>The depth of the tragic artist consists in the fact that his æsthetic instinct surveys the more remote results, that he does not halt shortsightedly at the thing that is nearest, that he says Yea to the whole cosmic economy, which justifies the terrible, the evil, and the questionable; which more than justifies it.</p>
<ol start="853">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Art in the &ldquo;Birth of Tragedy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The conception of the work which lies right in the background of this book, is extraordinarily gloomy and unpleasant: among all the types of pessimism which have ever been known hitherto, none seems to have attained to this degree of malice. The contrast of a true and of an apparent world is entirely absent here: there is but one world, and it is false, cruel, contradictory, seductive, and without sense. A world, thus constituted is the true world. We are in need of lies in order to rise superior to this reality, to this truth—that is to say, in order to live&hellip;. That lies should be necessary to life is part and parcel of the terrible and questionable character of existence.</p>
<p>Metaphysics, morality, religion, science, in this book, all these things are regarded merely as different forms of falsehood: by means of them we are led to believe in life. &ldquo;Life, must inspire confidence&rdquo;; the task which this imposes upon us is enormous. In order to solve, this problem man must already be a liar in his heart, but he must above all else be an artist. And he is that. Metaphysics, religion, morality, science, all these things are but the offshoot of his will to art, to falsehood, to a flight from &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; to a denial of &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; This ability, this artistic capacity <em>par excellence</em> of man—thanks to which he overcomes reality with lies,—is a quality which he has in common with all other forms of existence. He himself is indeed a piece of reality, of truth, of nature: how could he help being also a piece of genius in prevarication!</p>
<p>The fact that the character of existence is misunderstood, is the profoundest and the highest secret motive behind everything relating to virtue, science, piety, and art. To be blind to many things, to see many things falsely, to fancy many things: Oh, how clever man has been in those circumstances in which he believed he was anything but clever! Love, enthusiasm, &ldquo;God&rdquo;—are but subtle forms of ultimate Self-deception; they are but seductions to life and to the belief in life! In those moments when man was deceived, when he had befooled himself and when he believed in life: Oh, how his spirit swelled within him! Oh, what ecstasies he had! What power he felt! And what artistic triumphs in the feeling of power! &hellip; Man had once more become master of &ldquo;matter,&quot;—master of truth! &hellip; And whenever man rejoices it is always in the same way: he rejoices as an artist, his power is his joy, he enjoys falsehood as his power&hellip;.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Art and nothing else! Art is the great means of making life possible, the great seducer to life, the great stimulus of life.</p>
<p>Art is the only superior counter-agent to all will to the denial of life; it is <em>par excellence</em> the anti-Christian, the anti-Buddhistic, the anti-Nihilistic force.</p>
<p>Art is the alleviation of the seeker after knowledge,—of him who recognises the terrible and questionable character Of existence, and who will recognise it,—of the tragic seeker after knowledge.</p>
<p>Art is the alleviation of the man of action,—of him who not only sees the terrible and questionable character of existence, but also lives it, will live it,—of the tragic and warlike man, the hero. Art is the alleviation of the sufferer,—as the way to states in which pain is willed, is transfigured, is deified, where suffering is a form of great ecstasy.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>It is clear that in this book pessimism, or, better still, Nihilism, stands for &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; But truth is not postulated as the highest measure of value, and still less as the highest power. The will to appearance, to illusion, to deception, to becoming, and to change (to objective deception), is here regarded as more profound, as more primeval, as more metaphysical than the will to truth, to reality, to appearance: the latter is merely a form of the will to illusion. Happiness is likewise conceived as more primeval than pain: and pain is considered as conditioned, as a consequence Of the will to happiness (of the will to Becoming, to growth, to forming, i.e. to creating; in creating, however, destruction is included). The highest state of Yea-saying to existence is conceived as one from which the greatest pain may not be excluded: the tragico-Dionysian state.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>In this way this book is even anti-pessimistic, namely, in the sense that it teaches something which is stronger than pessimism and which is more &ldquo;divine&rdquo; than truth: Art. Nobody, it would seem, would be more ready seriously to utter a radical denial of life, an actual denial of action even more than a denial of life, than the author of this book. Except that he knows—for he has experienced it, and perhaps experienced little else!—that art is of more value than truth.</p>
<p>Even in the preface, in which Richard Wagner is, as it were, invited to join with him in conversation, the author expresses this article of faith, this gospel for artists; &ldquo;Art is the only task of life, art is the metaphysical activity of life&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
