  <h2 id="1-origin-of-moral-valuations">1 Origin of Moral Valuations</h2>
<p>253 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>For the Preface of The Dawnco An attempt to think about morality without falling under its spell, mistrustful of the seductiveness of its beautiful gestures and glances. A world we can revere, that is adequate to our drive to worship that continually proves itself-by providing guidance in the particular and the general : this is the Christian viewpoint in which we have all grown up.</p>
<p>Through an increase in our acuteness, mistrust, scientificality (also through a more ambitious instinct for veracity, thus under anti-Christian influences), this interpretation has grown more and more impermissible to us.</p>
<p>Subtlest way of escape: Kantian Criticism. The intellect dis putes its right to make interpretations of this sort as well as to</p>
<p>The first edition of The Dawn appeared in 1881; the second, with a new preface, in 1887. This heading has always been omitted so far.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(p147)</p>
<p>reject interpretations of this sort. One contents oneself with an increase in one&rsquo;s trust and faith, with a renunciation of all prova bility in matters of faith, with an inconceivable and superior &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; (God) as a stopgap.</p>
<p>The Hegelian way out, following Plato, a piece of roman ticism and reaction, at the same time a symptom of the historical sense, of a new strength: the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; itself is the &ldquo;self-revealing and self-realizing ideal&rdquo;: more and more of this ideal in which we believe manifests itself in the course of its &ldquo;process,&rdquo; in &ldquo;becom ing&rdquo;- thus the ideal realizes itself; faith is directed into the future wheni, in accordance with its noble requirements, it can worship. In short,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God is unknowable for us and not demonstrable by us (the hidden meaning of the epistemological movement);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is demonstrable but as something in process of be coming, and we are part of it, as witness our impulse toward the ideal (the hidden meaning of the historical movement),</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*Observe; criticism is never directed at the ideal itself, but only at the problem, where the opposition to it originates: why it has not yet been achieved or why it is not demonstrable in small things and in great.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It makes all the difference whether one feels this state of distress as a state of distress from passion, from a yearning, or whether one barely reaches it as a problem after the utmost thought and with a certain force of historical imagination.</p>
<p>We discover the same phenomenon outside religion and philosophy: utilitarianism (socialism, democracy) criticizes the origin of moral evaluations, but it believes them just as much as the Christian does. (Naiveté: as if morality could survive when the God who sanctions it is missing! The &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; absolutely necessary if faith in morality is to be maintained.)</p>
<p>Basic problem: whence this omnipotence of faith? Of faith in morality? (-Which betrays itself in this, too, that even the basic conditions of life are falsely interpreted for the benefit of morality: despite our knowledge of the animal world and the world of plants. &ldquo;Self-preservation&rdquo;: the reconciliation of altruistic and egoistic principles in the perspective of Darwinism.)</p>
<p>(p148)</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>254 (1885-1886) The inquiry into the origin of our evaluations and tables of the good is in absolutely no way identical with a critique of them, as is so often believed: even though the insight into some pudenda origobi certainly brings with it a feeling of a diminution in value of the thing that originated thus and prepares the way to a critical mood and attitude toward it.</p>
<p>What are our evaluations and moral. tables really worth? What is the outcome of their rule? For whom? in relation to what? - Answer: for life. But what is life? Here we need a new, more definite formulation of the concept &ldquo;life.” My formula for it is: Life is will to power,</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the act of evaluation itself? Does it point back or down to another, metaphysical world? (As Kant still believed, who belongs before the great historical movement.) In short: where did it originate? Or did it not &ldquo;originate&rdquo;? Answer; moral evaluation is an exegesis, a way of interpreting. The exegesis itself is a symptom of certain physiological condi tions, likewise of a particular spiritual level of prevalent judg ments: Who interprets? - Our affects.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>255 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>All virtues physiological conditions: particularly the principal organic functions considered as necessary, as good. All virtues are really refined passions and enhanced states..</p>
<p>Pity and love of mankind, as development of the sexual drive. Justice as development of the drive to revenge. Virtue as pleasure in resistance, will to power, Honor as recognition of the similar and equal-in-power.</p>
<p>256 (1887-1888)</p>
<p>I understand by &ldquo;morality&rdquo; a system of evaluations that partially coincides with the conditions of a creature&rsquo;s life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shameful origin.</li>
</ul>
<p>(p149)</p>
<p>257 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>Formerly one said of every morality: &ldquo;By their fruits ye shall know them.&rdquo; I say of every morality: &ldquo;It is a fruit by which I recognize the soil from which it sprang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>258 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>My attempt to understand moral judgments as symptoms and sign languages which betray the processes of physiological pros perity or failure, likewise the consciousness of the conditions for preservation and growth-a mode of interpretations of the same worth as astrology, prejudices prompted by the instincts (of races, communities, of the various stages of life, as youth or decay, etc.).</p>
<p>Applied to the specific Christian-European morality: Our moral judgments are signs of decline, of disbelief in life, a prepara</p>
<p>tion for pessimism.</p>
<p>My chief proposition: there are no moral phenomena, there is only a moral interpretation of these phenomena. This interpre tation itself is of extra-moral origin.62</p>
<p>What does it mean that our interpretation has projected a contradiction into existence? Of decisive importance: behind all other other evaluations these moral evaluations stand in com mand. Supposing they were abolished, according to what would we measure then? And then of what value would be knowledge, etc., etc. ???</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>259 (1884) Insight: all evaluation is made from a definite perspective: that of the preservation of the individual, a community, a race, a state, a church, a faith, a culture.&ndash; Because we forget that valua tion is always from a perspective, a single individual contains within him a vast confusion of contradictory valuations and con sequently of contradictory drives. This is the expression of the diseased condition in man, in contrast to the animals in which all existing instincts answer to quite definite tasks.</p>
<p>This contradictory creature has in his nature, however, a great method of acquiring knowledge: he feels many pros and</p>
<ul>
<li>Cf. section 266.</li>
</ul>
<p>(p150)</p>
<p>cons, he raises himself to justice-to comprehension beyond es teeming things good and evil.</p>
<p>The wisest man would be the one richest in contradictions, who has, as it were, antennae for all types of men as well as his great moments of grand harmony-a rare accident even in us! A sort of planetary motion</p>
<p>260 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willing&rdquo;: means willing an end. &ldquo;An end&rdquo; includes an evaluation. Whence come evaluations? Is their basis a firm norm, &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; and &ldquo;painful&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But in countless cases we first make a thing painful by invest ing it with an evaluation.</p>
<p>The extent of moral evaluations: they play a part in almost every sense impression. Our world is colored by them.</p>
<p>We have invested things with ends and values: therefore we have in us an enormous fund of latent force: but by comparing values it appears that contradictory things have been accounted valuable, that many tables of value have existed (thus nothing is valuable &ldquo;in itself&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Analysis of individual tables of value revealed that their erection was the erection of the conditions-often erroneous-of existence of a limited group for its preservation.</p>
<p>Observation of contemporary man reveals that we employ very diverse value judgments and that they no longer have any creative force&ndash;the basis, &ldquo;the condition of existence,&rdquo; is now missing from moral judgment. It is much more superfluous, it is not nearly so painful. It becomes arbitrary. Chaos.</p>
<p>Who creates the goal that stands above mankind and above the individual? Formerly one employed morality for preservation: but nobody wants to preserve any longer, there is nothing to pre serve. Therefore an experimental morality: to give oneself a goal.</p>
<p>261 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>What is the criterion of a moral action? (1) its disinterested ness, (2) its universal validity, etc. But this is armchair moralizing. One must study peoples to see what the criterion is in every case, and what is expressed by it: a belief that &ldquo;such a scheme of</p>
<p>(p151)</p>
<p>behavior is one of the first conditions of our existence.&rdquo; Immoral means &ldquo;bringing destruction.&rdquo; Now, all the communities in which these propositions are discovered have perished: certain of these propositions have been reaffirmed again and again because every new community that arose had need of them again; e.g., &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal.&rdquo; In ages when it was impossible to demand any feeling for the community (e.g., in the imperium Romanum), the drive was directed to &ldquo;salvation of soul,” in religious language: or &ldquo;the greatest happiness,&rdquo; in philosophical terms. For even the Greek moral philosophers no longer had any feeling for their polis. 63</p>

<p>The necessity of false values. One can refute a judgment by proving its conditionality: the need to retain it is not thereby removed. False values cannot be eradicated by reasons any more than astigmatism in the eyes of an invalid. One must grasp the need for their existence: they are a consequence of causes which have nothing to do with reasons.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to take &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; etc., in a definite, narrow, bourgeois sense, as in &ldquo;Do right and fear no man&rdquo;: i.e., to do one&rsquo;s duty according to a definite rude scheme within which a community exists.</p>
<p>-Let us not think meanly of that which two thousand years of morality have bred in our spirit!</p>
<p>268 (Jan.-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>Two types of morality must not be confused: the morality with which the healthy instinct defends itself against incipient de cadence and another morality with which this very decadence defines and justifies itself and leads downwards.</p>
<p>The former is usually stoical, hard, tyrannical ( Stoicism itself was such a brake-shoe morality); the latter is enthusiastic, sentimental, full of secrets; it has the women and &ldquo;beautiful feel ings&rdquo; on its side ( primitive Christianity was such a morality).</p>
<p>269 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>To get the whole of moralizing into focus as a phenomenon. Also as a riddle. The phenomena of morality have occupied me like riddles. Today I would know how to answer the question: What does it mean that the welfare of my neighbor ought to possess for me a higher value than my own? but that my neighbor himself ought to assess the value of his welfare differently than I, that is, that he should subordinate it to my welfare? What is the meaning of that &ldquo;Thou shalt,&rdquo; which even philosophers regard as &ldquo;given&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The apparently crazy idea that a man should esteem the actions he performs for another more highly than those he per forms for himself, and that this other should likewise, etc. (that one should call good only those actions that a man performs with an eye, not to himself, but to the welfare of another) has a mean</p>
<p>(p154)</p>
<p>ing; namely, as the social instinct resting on the valuation that the single individual is of little account, but all individuals together are of very great account provided they constitute a community with a common feeling and a common conscience. Therefore a kind of training in looking in a certain definite direction, the will to a perspective that seeks to make it impossible to see oneself.</p>
<p>My idea: goals are lacking and these must be individuals&rsquo;! We observe how things are everywhere: every individual is sacri ficed and serves as a tool. Go into the street and you encounter lots of &ldquo;slaves.&rdquo; Whither? For what?</p>
<p>270 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>How is it possible that a man has respect for himself with regard to moral values alone, that he considers everything else subordinate and of little worth compared with good, evil, improve ment, salvation of soul, etc.? e.g., Henri Fréd. Amiel.56 What is the meaning of the moral idiosyncrasy?- I mean in a psychological sense, also in a physiological sense; e.g., Pascal. That is, in cases where other great qualities were not lacking; also in the case of Schopenhauer, who obviously valued that which he did not and could not have—is it not the consequence of a merely habitual moral interpretation of actual states of pain and displeasure? is it not a definite kind of sensibility that does not understand the cause of its frequent feelings of displeasure but believes it explains them with moral hypotheses? So that even a transitory feeling of health and strength immediately appears, in the perspective of a &ldquo;good conscience,&rdquo; to be illumined by the nearness of God, by the consciousness of redemption?&ndash;</p>
<p>Thus the man of moral idiosyncrasy has (1) either really acquired his worth through approximating society&rsquo;s model of virtue: &ldquo;the good man,&rdquo; &ldquo;the righteous&rdquo;&ndash;a highly respectable condition of mediocrity: mediocre in all his abilities but decent, conscientious, solid, respected, trusty; (2) or he believes he has acquired it because he does not know how otherwise to understand all his states he is unknown to himself, so he interpretes himself in this way.</p>
<p>Morality as the only scheme of interpretation by which man can endure himself a kind of pride?</p>

<p>271 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>The predominance of moral values. Consequences of this predominance: the corruption of psychology, etc.; the universal fatality which follows from it. What does this predominance mean? What does it point to?</p>
<p>To a certain greater urgency for a definite Yes and No in this field. All kinds of imperatives have been employed to make moral values appear permanent; they have been commanded for the longest time they seem instinctive, like inner commands. Moral values reveal themselves to be conditions of the existence of society, in that they are felt to be beyond discussion. The practice, which is to say the utility, of agreement about the highest values has here acquired a kind of sanction. We observe that every means is employed to paralyze reflection and criticism in this field:- look at the attitude of Kant! not to speak of those who reject as im moral all &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; here</p>
<p>272 (Spring-Fall 1887) My purpose: to demonstrate the absolute homogeneity of all events and the application of moral distinctions as conditioned by perspective; to demonstrate how everything praised as moral is identical in essence with everything immoral and was made possible, as in every development of morality, with immoral means and for immoral ends&hellip;; how, on the other hand, everything decried as immoral is, economically considered, higher and more essential, and how a development toward a greater fullness of life necessarily also demands the advance of immorality. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; the extent to which we permit ourselves to understand this fact.</p>
<p>273 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry: for one needs a great deal of morality to be immoral in this subtle way; I will speak in a parable:</p>
<p>A physiologist interested in a disease and an invalid who claims to be cured of it do not have identical interests. Let us suppose the disease is morality&ndash;for it is a disease and that we Europeans are the invalids: what subtle torment and difficulties would arise if we Europeans were at the same time inquisitive</p>
<p>(p156)</p>
<p>spectators and physiologists! Would we then really desire to be free of morality? Would we want to be? Quite apart from the question whether we could be. Whether we could be &ldquo;cured.&rdquo; —</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Herd</li>
</ol>
<p>274 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Whose will to power is morality? - The common factor in the history of Europe since Socrates is the attempt to make moral values dominate over all other values: so that they should be the guide and judge not only of life but also of (1) knowledge, (2) the arts, (3) political and social endeavors. &ldquo;Improvement&rdquo; the sole duty, everything else a means to it (or a disturbance, hin drance, danger: consequently to be combatted to the point of anni hilation-). A similar movement in China. A similar movement in India.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this will to power on the part of moral values which has developed so tremendously on earth?</p>
<p>Answer:- three powers are hidden behind it: (1) the in stinct of the herd against the strong and independent; (2) the instinct of the suffering and underprivileged against the fortunate; (3) the instinct of the mediocre against the exceptional.&ndash; Enor mous advantage possessed by this movement, however much cruelty, falseness, and narrow-mindedness have assisted it (for the history of the struggle of morality with the basic instincts of life is itself the greatest piece of immorality that has yet existed on earth&ndash;).</p>
<p>275 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Very few manage to see a problem in that which makes our daily life, that to which we have long since grown accustomed our eyes are not adjusted to it: this seems to me to be the case especially in regard to our morality.</p>
<p>The problem &ldquo;every man as an object for others&rdquo; is the occasion of the highest honors: for himself—no!</p>
<p>The problem &ldquo;thou shalt&rdquo;: an inclination that cannot ex plain itself, similar to the sexual drive, shall not fall under the general condemnation of the drives; on the contrary, it shall be their evaluation and judge!</p>
<p>(p157)</p>
<p>The problem of &ldquo;equality,&rdquo; while we all thirst after dis stinction: here, on the contrary, we are supposed to make exactly the same demands on ourselves as we make on others. This is so insipid, so obviously crazy: but it is felt to be holy, of a higher rank, the conflict with reason is hardly noticed.</p>
<p>Sacrifice and selflessness as distinguishing, unconditional obe dience to morality, and the faith that one is everyone&rsquo;s equal before</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>The neglect and surrender of well-being and life as distin guishing, the complete renunciation of making one&rsquo;s own evalua tions, and the firm desire to see everyone else renounce them too. &ldquo;The value of an action is determined: everyone is subject to this valuation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We see: an authority speaks-who speaks? One may forgive human pride if it sought to make this authority as high as possible in order to feel as little humiliated as possible under it. Therefore-God speaks!</p>
<p>One needed God as an unconditional sanction, with no court of appeal, as a &ldquo;categorical imperator&rdquo;— or, if one believed in the authority of reason, one needed a metaphysic of unity, by virtue of which this was logical</p>
<p>Now suppose that belief in God has vanished: the question presents itself anew: &ldquo;who speaks?&rdquo;. My answer, taken not from metaphysics but from animal physiology: the herd instinct speaks. It wants to be master; hence its &ldquo;thou shalt!” — it will allow value to the individual only from the point of view of the whole, for the sake of the whole, it hates those who detach themselves it turns the hatred of all individuals against them.</p>
<p>276 (1886-1887)</p>
<p>The whole of European morality is based upon what is use ful to the herd: the affliction of all higher, rarer men lies in this, that everything that distinguishes them enters their consciousness accompanied by a feeling of diminution and discredit, The strong points of contemporary men are the causes of their pessimistic gloom: the mediocre are, like the herd, little troubled with questions and conscience-cheerful. (On the gloominess of the strong: Pascal, Schopenhauer.)</p>
<p>The more dangerous a quality seems to the herd, the more thoroughly is it proscribed.</p>
<p>(p158)</p>
<p>277 (1883-1888) Morality of truthfulness in the herd. &ldquo;You shall be knowable, express your inner nature by clear and constant signs&ndash;otherwise you are dangerous: and if you are evil, your ability to dissimulate is the worst thing for the herd. We despise the secret and un recognizable. Consequently you must consider yourself know able, you may not be concealed from yourself, you may not believe that you change.&rdquo; Thus: the demand for truthfulness presupposes the knowability and stability of the person. In fact, it is the object of education to create in the herd member a definite faith concem ing the nature of man: it first invents this faith and then demands &ldquo;truthfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>278 (1885)</p>
<p>Within a herd, within any community, that is to say inter pares, 57 the overestimation of truthfulness makes good sense. Not to be deceived and consequently, as a personal point of morality, not to deceive! a mutual obligation between equals! In dealing with what lies outside, danger and caution demand that one should be on one&rsquo;s guard against deception: as a psychological preconditioning for this, also in dealing with what lies within. Mistrust as the source of truthfulness.</p>
<p>279 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Toward a critique of the herd virtues.- Inertia operates (1) in trustfulness, since mistrust makes tension, observation, reflection necessary;— (2) in veneration, where the difference in power is great and submission necessary: so as not to fear, an attempt is made to love, esteem, and to interpret the disparity in power as disparity in value: so that the relationship no longer makes one rebellious;— (3) in the sense of truth. What is true? Where an explanation is given which causes us the minimum of spiritual effort (moreover, lying is very exhausting); (4) in sympathy. It is a relief to count oneself the same as others, to try to feel as they do, to adopt a current feeling: it is something passive com pared with the activity that maintains and constantly practices</p>
<p>67 Among equals.</p>
<p>(p159) the individual&rsquo;s right to value judgments (the latter allows of no rest); (5) in impartiality and coolness of judgment: one shuns the exertion of affects and prefers to stay detached, &ldquo;objective&rdquo;; (6) in integrity: one would rather obey an existing law than create a law oneself, than command oneself and others: the fear of commanding&ndash;: better to submit than to react;— (7) in toleration: the fear of exercising rights, of judging.</p>
<p>280 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>The instinct of the herd considers the middle and the mean as the highest and most valuable: the place where the majority finds itself; the mode and manner in which it finds itself. It is therefore an opponent of all orders of rank, it sees an ascent from beneath to above as a descent from the majority to the minority. The herd feels the exception, whether it be below or above it, as something opposed and harmful to it. Its artifice with reference to the ex ceptions above it, the stronger, more powerful, wiser, and more fruitful, is to persuade them to assume the role of guardians, herdsmen, watchmen&mdash;to become its first servants:58 it has there with transformed a danger into something useful. Fear ceases in the middle: here one is never alone; here there is little room for misunderstanding; here there is equality; here one&rsquo;s own form of being is not felt as a reproach but as the right form of being; here contentment rules. Mistrust is felt toward the exceptions; to be an exception is experienced as guilt.</p>
<p>281 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>When, following the instinct of the community, we make prescriptions and forbid ourselves certain actions, we quite reason ably do not forbid a mode of &ldquo;being,&rdquo; a &ldquo;disposition,&rdquo; but only a certain direction and application of this &ldquo;being,&rdquo; this &ldquo;disposition.&rdquo; But then the ideologist of virtue, the moralist, comes along and says: “God sees into the heart! What does it matter if you refrain from certain actions: you are no better for that!&rdquo; Answer: My dear Sir Long-Ears-and-Virtuous, we have no desire whatever to be better, we are very contented with ourselves, all we desire is not to harm one another—and therefore we forbid certain actions</p>
<p>** Frederick the Great (King of Prussia from 1740 to 1786) called him self &ldquo;the first servant of my state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(p160)</p>
<p>when they are directed in a certain way, namely against us, while we cannot sufficiently honor these same actions provided they are directed against enemies of the community against you, for instance. We educate our children in them; we cultivate them If we shared that “God-pleasing&rdquo; radicalism that your holy madness recommends, if we were fools enough to condemn together with those actions the source of them, the &ldquo;heart,&rdquo; the “disposition,&rdquo; that would mean condemning our own existence and with it its supreme prerequisite&ndash;a disposition, a heart, a passion we honor with the highest honors. By our decrees, we prevent this dispo sition from breaking out and expressing itself in an inexpedient way</p>
<p>-We are prudent when we make such law for ourselves, we are also moral-Have you no suspicion, however faint, what sacrifice it is costing us, how much taming, self-overcoming, severity toward ourselves it requires? We are vehement in our desires, there are times when we would like to devour each other- But the &ldquo;sense of community&rdquo; masters us: please note that this is almost a definition of morality.</p>
<p>282 (Fall 1888) The weakness of the herd animal produces a morality very similar to that produced by the weakness of the decadent: they understand one another, they form an alliance ( the great decadence religions always count on the support of the herd). In itself, there is nothing sick about the herd animal, it is even in valuable; but, incapable of leading itself, it needs a &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo;. the priests understand that- The state is not intimate, not clan destine enough; &ldquo;directing the conscience&rdquo; eludes it. And that is how the herd animal has been made sick by the priest?&mdash;</p>
<p>283 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Hatred for the privileged in body and soul: revolt of the ugly, ill-constituted souls against the beautiful, proud, joyous. Their means: inculpation of beauty, pride, joy: &ldquo;there is no merit,&rdquo; &ldquo;the danger is tremendous: one should tremble and feel ill,&rdquo; “natural ness is evil; it is right to oppose nature.&rdquo; Also &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; (The anti natural as the higher).</p>
<p>Again it is the priests who exploit this condition and win the &ldquo;people&rdquo; over. &ldquo;The sinner&rdquo; in whom God has more joy than in</p>
<p>(p161)</p>
<p>the &ldquo;just man.&rdquo; This is the struggle against &ldquo;paganism&rdquo; (the pang of conscience as the means of destroying harmony of soul).</p>
<p>The hatred of the average for the exceptional, of the herd for the independent. (Custom as true &ldquo;morality.&ldquo;50) Turning against &ldquo;egoism&rdquo;: only the &ldquo;for another&rdquo; has value. &ldquo;We are all equal&rdquo;;— against lust for dominion, against &ldquo;dominion&rdquo; in general; against privilege; - against sectarians, free spirits, skeptics;- against philosophy (as opposing the tool-and-corner instinct); with philosophers themselves &ldquo;the categorical impera tive,&rdquo; the essence of morality &ldquo;universal and general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>284 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>The conditions and desires that are praised: peaceable, fair, moderate, modest, reverent, considerate, brave, chaste, honest, faithful, devout, straight, trusting, devoted, sympathetic, helpful, conscientious, simple, mild, just, generous, indulgent, obedient, disinterested, unenvious, gracious, industrious</p>
<p>To distinguish: to what extent such qualities are conditioned as means to a definite aim and end (often an &ldquo;evil&rdquo; end); or as natural consequences of a dominating affect (e.g., spirituality) or expression of a state of distress, which is to say: as condition of existence (e.g., citizen, slave, woman, etc.).</p>
<p>Summa: they are none of them felt to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; for their own sake, but from the first according to the standards of society,&rdquo; *the herd,&rdquo; as means to the ends of society and the herd, as neces sary to their preservation and advancement, at the same time as the consequence of an actual herd instinct in the individual: thus in the service of an instinct which is fundamentally different from these conditions of virtue. For the herd is, in relation to the out side world, hostile, selfish, unmerciful, full of lust for dominion, mistrust, etc.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo; this antagonism becomes patent: he must possess opposite qualities to the herd.</p>
<p>Mortal enmity of the herd toward orders of rank: its instinct favors the leveller (Christ). Toward strong individuals (les souve rains) it is hostile, unfair, immoderate, immodest, impudent, in considerate, cowardly, mendacious, false, unmerciful, underhand, envious, revengeful.</p>
<p>** Die Sitte als eigentliche &ldquo;Sirrlichkeit&rdquo;: mores as the essence of moral ity. Cf. section 265 above,</p>
<p>(p162)</p>
<p>285 (1884)</p>
<p>I teach: the herd seeks to preserve one type and defends itself on both sides, against those who have degenerated from it (crim inals, etc.) and those who tower above it. The tendency of the herd is directed toward standstill and preservation, there is nothing creative in it.</p>
<p>The pleasant feelings with which the good, benevolent, just man inspires us (in contrast to the tension, fear which the great, new man arouses) are our own feelings of personal security and equality: the herd animal thus glorifies the herd nature and then it feels comfortable. This judgment of comfort masks itself with fair wordsthus &ldquo;morality&rdquo; arises. But observe the hatred of the herd for the truthful.</p>
<p>286 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Let one not be deceived about oneself! If one hears within oneself the moral imperative as it is understood by altruism, one belongs to the herd. If one has the opposite feeling, if one feels one&rsquo;s danger and abberration lies in disinterestėd and selfless actions, one does not belong to the herd.</p>
<p>287 (1883-1888) My philosophy aims at an ordering of rank: not at an in dividualistic morality.so The ideas of the herd should rule in the herd—but not reach out beyond it: the leaders of the herd require a fundamentally different valuation for their own actions, as do the independent, or the &ldquo;beasts of prey,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<li>General Remarks on Morality</li>
</ol>
<p>288 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>Morality as an attempt to establish human pride. The theory of &ldquo;free will&rdquo; is antireligious. It seeks to create the right for man to think of himself as cause of his exalted state and actions: it is a form of the growing feeling of pride.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cf. section 361.</li>
</ul>
<p>163</p>
<p>BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values Man feels his power, his &ldquo;happiness,&rdquo; as they say: there must be &ldquo;will&rdquo; behind this state-otherwise it would not be his. Virtue is the attempt to set the fact of willing and having-willed before every exalted and strong feeling of happiness as a necessary ante cedent:- if the will to certain actions is regularly present in the consciousness, a feeling of power may be interpreted as its effect. This is merely a perspective of psychology: always based on the false presupposition that nothing belongs to us that we have not consciously willed. The entire theory of responsibility depends upon the naive psychology that the only cause is will and that one must be aware of having willed in order to believe in oneself as cause.</p>
<p>Comes the countermovement: that of the moral philos ophers, still subject to the same prejudice that one is responsible only for what one has willed. The value of man is posited as a moral value: consequently his morality must be a causa prima; 61 consequently there must be a principle in man, a &ldquo;free will” as causa prima.- The idea behind it is: if man is not causa prima as will, then he is irresponsible consequently he has no business before the moral tribunal-virtue and vice would be automatic</p>
<p>and mechanical</p>
<p>In summa: so that man may respect himself he must be capable of doing evil.</p>
<p>289 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>Play-acting as a consequence of the morality of &ldquo;free will.&rdquo; It is a step in the development of the feeling of power itself to have caused one&rsquo;s own exalted states (one&rsquo;s perfection) - consequently, one immediately concludes, to have willed them</p>
<p>(Critique: All perfect acts are unconscious and no longer subject to will; consciousness is the expression of an imperfect and often morbid state in a person. Personal perfection as conditioned by will, as consciousness, as reasoning with dialectics, is a carica ture, a kind of self-contradiction- A degree of consciousness makes perfection impossible Form of play-acting.)</p>
<p>290 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>The moral hypothesis with the object of justifying God was:</p>
<p>$1 First cause.</p>
<p>(p164)</p>
<p>evil must be voluntary (merely so that the voluntariness of good ness can be believed in), and on the other hand: the object of evil and suffering is salvation.</p>
<p>The concept &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; as not extending back to the ultimate ground of existence, and the concept &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; as an educative benefit, consequently as the act of a good God.</p>
<p>Absolute dominion of moral valuation over all others: one did not doubt that God could not be evil and could not do any thing harmful, i.e., by &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; one meant merely a moral perfection.</p>
<p>291 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>How false is the idea that the value of an action must depend upon that which preceded it in consciousness! And morality has been judged according to this, even criminality</p>
<p>The value of an action must be judged by its consequences say the Utilitarians to judge it by its origins implies an impossi bility, namely that of knowing its origins.</p>
<p>But does one know its consequences? For five steps ahead, perhaps. Who can say what an action will stimulate, excite, pro voke? As a stimulus? Perhaps as a spark to touch off an explo sion?- The Utilitarians are naive And in any case we must first know what is useful: here too they look only five steps ahead. They have no conception of the grand economy, which cannot do without evil.</p>
<p>One does not know the origin, one does not know the conse quences:- does an action then possess any value at all?</p>
<p>The action itself remains: its epiphenomena in consciousness, the Yes and the No that follow its performance: does the value of an action lie in its subjective epiphenomena? (that would be like assessing the value of the music according to the pleasure or displeasure it gives us-it gives its composer-). Obviously value feelings accompany it, a feeling of power, compulsion, impo tence; e.g., freedom, ease-put in another way: could one reduce the value of an action to physiological values: whether it is the expression of a complete or an inhibited life?02_ It may be that</p>
<p>62 In all editions the immediately following words in the MS have been omitted: &ldquo;is it permitted to measure its value according to epiphenomena, such as pleasure and displeasure, the play of the affects, the feeling of dis charges, explosion, freedom&hellip;.&rdquo; Also the following words at the end of</p>
<p>(p165)</p>
<p>its biological value is expressed in this</p>
<p>If therefore an action can be evaluated neither by its origin, nor by its consequences, nor by its epiphenomena, then its value is &ldquo;x,&rdquo; unknown</p>
<p>292 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>On the denaturalization of morality. To separate the action from the man; to direct hatred or contempt against the &ldquo;sin&rdquo;; to believe there are actions that are good or bad in themselves.93</p>
<p>Restoration of &ldquo;nature&rdquo;: an action in itself is perfectly devoid of value: it all depends on who performs it. One and the same &ldquo;crime&rdquo; can be in one case the greatest privilege, in another a stigma. In fact, it is the selfishness of the judges which interprets an action, or its performer, in relation to its utility or harmfulness to themselves ( or in relation to its similarity or unlikeness to them).</p>
<p>293 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>The concept &ldquo;reprehensible action&rdquo; presents us with difficul ties. Nothing that happened at all can be reprehensible in itself: for one should not want to eliminate it: for everything is so bound up with everything else, that to want to exclude something means to exclude everything. A reprehensible action means: a repre hended world</p>
<p>And then further: in a reprehended world reprehending would also be reprehensible — And the consequence of a way of thinking that reprehended everything would be a way of living that affirmed everything If becoming is a great ring, then everything is equally valuable, eternal, necessary. In all correlations of Yes and No, of preference and rejection, love and hate, all that is expressed is a perspective, an interest of certain types of life: in itself, every thing that is says Yes.</p>

<p>43 Thus in the M$. In all editions: &ldquo;It is a denaturalization of morality</p>
<p>to&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(p166)</p>
<p>merly one concluded: the conscience reprehends this action; consequently this action is reprehensible. In fact, the conscience reprehends an action because it has been reprehended for a long time. It merely repeats: it creates no values. That which in the past decided to reprehend certain actions was not conscience: but the insight into (or the prejudice against) their consequences</p>
<p>The assent of the conscience, the pleasant feeling of &ldquo;at peace with oneself,&rdquo; is of the same order as the pleasure of an artist in his work-it proves nothing at all</p>
<p>Self-contentment is as little a standard for that to which it relates as its absence is an argument against the value of a thing. We do not know nearly enough to be able to measure the value of our actions: in addition, it is impossible for us to be objective about them: even when we reprehend an action, we are not judges but interested parties.</p>
<p>If noble agitation accompanies an action, this proves noth ing about its value: an artist can go through the highest possible pathos of passion and bring forth something wretched. One should say rather that these agitations are a means of seduction: they Iure our eyes, our strength away from criticism, from caution, from suspicion, so that we perpetrate a stupidity they make us stupid</p>
<p>295 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>We are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-cruci fixion of two millennia: in these we have had longest practice, in these lies our mastery perhaps, certainly our subtlety; we have conjoined the natural inclinations and a bad conscience.</p>
<p>A reverse attempt would be possible: to conjoin the unnatural inclinations, I mean the inclination for the beyond, for things con trary to sense, reason, nature, in short all previous ideals, which were all world-slandering ideals, with a bad conscience.</p>

<li>
<p>that love has been falsified as surrender (and altruism), while it is an appropriation or a bestowal following from a super abundance of personality.

<p>This whole psychology is a psychology of prevention, a kind of immuring out of fear; on one hand the great masses (the under privileged and mediocre) seek to defend themselves by means of it against the stronger (-and to destroy them in their develop ment-), on the other all the drives through which they best prosper, sanctified and alone held in honor.

<p>&ldquo;Morality for morality&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;-an important step in its denaturalization: it itself appears as the ultimate value. In this phase it has permeated religion: e.g., in Judaism. And there is likewise a phase in which it separates itself again from religion and in which no God is &ldquo;moral&rdquo; enough for it: it then prefers the impersonal ideal - This is the case at present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;- this is an equally dangerous principle: therewith one introduces a false antithesis into things-it culmi pates in a defamation of reality (&ldquo;idealization&rdquo; into the ugly). If one severs an ideal from reality one debases the real, one impov erishes it, one defames it. &ldquo;The beautiful for the sake of the beautiful,&rdquo; &ldquo;the true for the sake of the true,&rdquo; &ldquo;the good for the sake of the good&rdquo;&mdash;these are three forms of evil eye for the real.</p>
<p>-Art, knowledge, morality are means; instead of recogniz ing in them the aim of enhancing life, one has associated them with the antithesis of life, with &ldquo;God&rdquo;-also as the revelation of a higher world which here and there looks down upon us through them</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful and ugly,&rdquo; &ldquo;true and false,&rdquo; &ldquo;good and evil these distinctions and antagonisms betray certain conditions of existence and enhancement, not only of man but of any kind of firm and enduring complex which separates itself from its adver sary.

<li>How Virtue Is Made to Dominate</li>
</ol>
<p>304 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>Of the ideal of the moralists.66 This treatise deals with the grand politics of virtue. It is intended for the use of those whose interest must lie in learning, not how one becomes virtuous, but how one makes virtuous—how virtue is made to dominate. I even intend to prove that to desire the one&ndash;the domination of virtue— one absolutely must not desire the other; one automatically renounces becoming virtuous oneself. This is a great sacrifice: but such a goal is perhaps sufficient reward for such a sacrifice. And for even greater sacrifices! — And some of the most famous moral ists have risked as much. For they had already recognized and anticipated the truth, which is in this treatise to be taught for the first time, that one can achieve the domination of virtue only by the same means as those by which one can achieve domination of any kind, in any case not by means of virtue</p>
<p>This treatise, as already stated, deals with the politics of virtue: it posits an ideal of these politics, it describes them as they would have to be, if anything on this earth could be perfect. Now, no philosopher will be in any doubt as to the type of per fection in politics; that is Machiavellianism, But Machiavellianism pur, sans mélange, cru, vert, dans toute sa force, dans toute son apreté,07 is superhuman, divine, transcendental, it will never be achieved by man, at most approximated. Even in this narrower kind of politics, in the politics of virtue, the ideal seems never to have been achieved. Even Plato barely touched it. One discovers, if one has eyes for hidden things, traces in even the most uopreju</p>

<p>In the standard editions these words are omitted, obviously to avoid duplication of the section the German editors placed at the beginning of The Will to Power. Schlechta ignores 1911 (p. 503) and reproduces the printed versions, not the text of the MS.</p>

<p>(p171) diced and conscious moralists (and that is indeed the name for such politicians of morality, for every kind of founder of new moral forces) that show that they too have paid their tribute to human weakness. They all aspired, at least when they were weary, to virtue for themselves: first and capital error for a moralist who must as such be an immoralist in practice. That he must not appear to be so is another matter. Or rather, it is not another matter: such a fundamental self-denial (in moral terms, dissimula tion) is part of the canon of the moralist and his most specific duties: without it he will never attain to his kind of perfection. Freedom from morality, also from truth, for the sake of that goal that outweighs every sacrifice: for the sake of the domination of virtue—that is the canon. Moralists need the gestures of virtue, also the gestures of truth; their error begins only when they yield to virtue, when they lose domination over virtue, when they themselves become moral, become true. A great moralist is, among other things, necessarily a great actor; his danger is that his dis simulation may unintentionally become nature, while it is his ideal to keep his esse and his operari48 in a divine way apart; every thing he does must be done sub specie boni69__a high, remote, exacting ideal! A divine ideal! And indeed, it is said that the moralist imitates in that no less a model than God himself: God, the greatest of all immoralists in practice, who nonetheless knows how to remain what he is, the good God</p>

<p>There are those who go looking for immorality. When they judge: &ldquo;This is wrong,&rdquo; they believe one should abolish and change it. I, on the contrary, cannot rest as long as I am not yet clear about the immorality of a thing. When I unearth it I recover my equanimity.</p>
<p>310 (Spring-Fall 1887) a. The paths to power: to introduce a new virtue under the name of an old one-to excite &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in it (&ldquo;happiness&rdquo; as its consequence and vice versa)&ndash;the art of slandering what stands in its way—to exploit advantages and accidents for its glorification &ndash;to turn its followers into fanatics by means of sacrifice and separation;-grand symbolism.</p>
<p>b. Power attained: (1) virtue as force; (2) virtue as seduc tion; (3) virtue as (court) etiquette.</p>
<p>311 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>By which means does a virtue come to power?- By exactly the same means as a political party: the slandering, inculpation, undermining of virtues that oppose it and are already in power, by rebaptizing them, by systematic persecution and mockery. Therefore: through sheer &ldquo;immorality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does a desire do with itself to become a virtue? Rebaptism; systematic denial of its objectives; practice in self</p>

<p>Cruelty has been refined to tragic pity, so that it is denied the name of cruelty. In the same way sexual love has been refined to amour-passion; the slavish disposition to Christian obedience; wretchedness to humility; a pathological condition of the nervus sympathicus, e.g., to pessimism, Pascalism, or Carlylism, etc.</p>

<p>It would arouse doubts in us concerning a man if we heard he needed reasons for remaining decent: certainly, we would avoid him. The little word &ldquo;for&rdquo; can be compromising in certain cases; one can even refute oneself now and then with a single &ldquo;for.971 Now, if we hear further that such an aspirant to virtue needed bad reasons for remaining respectable, this would be no reason for us to feel an increased respect for him. But he goes further, he comes to us and tells us to our face: &ldquo;Unbeliever, you are dis turbing my morality with your unbelief; as long as you do not believe in my bad reasons, which is to say in God, in a punish ment in the beyond, in freedom of will, you hamper my virtue&ndash; Moral: unbelievers must be abolished: they hamper the moraliza tion of the masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>314 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>Our most sacred convictions, the unchanging elements in our supreme values, are judgments of our muscles.</p>
<p>315 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Morality in the valuation of races and classes. In view of the fact that the affects and fundamental drives in every race and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cf. The Antichrist, section 45.</p>
<p>(p174)</p>
<p>class express something of the conditions of their existence ( at least of the conditions under which they have prevailed for the longest time), to desire that they should be &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo; means:</p>
<p>that they change their character, shed their skin and blot out their past:</p>
<p>means that they should cease to be distinct:</p>
<p>means that they should begin to resemble one another in their needs and demands-more clearly: that they should perish</p>
<p>The will to a single morality is thereby proved to be a tyranny over other types by that type whom this single morality fits: it is a destruction or a leveling for the sake of the ruling type (whether to render the others no longer fearsome or to render them useful). &ldquo;Abolition of slavery&rsquo;_supposedly a tribute to &ldquo;human dignity,&rdquo; in fact a destruction of a fundamentally different type (the undermining of its values and happiness ).</p>
<p>The qualities in which an opposing race or class is strong are interpreted as its most evil, worst qualities; for it is with those that it can harm us (-its &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; are defamed and rebaptized.-).</p>
<p>It counts as an objection against a man or people if they harm us; but from their point of view we are desirable, because we are such as one can make use of.</p>
<p>The demand for &ldquo;humanization&rdquo; (which quite naively believes itself to possess the formula for &ldquo;what is human?&rdquo;) is a tartuffery, behind which a quite definite type of man seeks to attain domina tion: more exactly, a quite definite instinct, the herd instinct. &ldquo;Human equality&rdquo;: which is concealed behind the tendency to make men more and more alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interestedness&rdquo; with reference to communal morality. (Anti fice: to transform the great passions of lust for power and posses sions into protectors of virtue).</p>
<p>To what extent all kinds of businessmen and the avaricious, all who have to give and claim credit, find it necessary to become more and more alike in character and in conception of value: world trade and exchange of every kind extorts and, as it were, buys virtue.</p>
<p>The same applies to the state and to every kind of rule by means of officials and soldiers; likewise science, in order to work in security and with economy of its forces.&ndash; Likewise the priest hood.</p>
<p>Here, therefore, a communal morality is enforced because it procures an advantage; and to make it victorious, war and force</p>
<p>(p175)</p>
<p>are practiced against immorality&ndash;with what &ldquo;right&rdquo;? With no right whatever: but in accordance with the instinct for self-preser vation. These same classes make use of immorality when it serves their purpose.</p>
<p>316 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>The hypocritical show with which all civil institutions are whitewashed, as if they were products of morality-e.g., marriage; work; one&rsquo;s profession; the fatherland; the family; order; law. But since they are one and all founded on the most mediocre type of man, as protection against exceptions and exceptional needs, it is only to be expected that they are full of lies.</p>
<p>317 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) One should defend virtue against the preachers of virtue: they are its worst enemies. For they teach virtue as an ideal for everyone; they take from virtue the charm of rareness, inimitable Dess, exceptionalness and unaverageness—its aristocratic magic. One should also take a stand against the obdurate idealists who eagerly knock on all vessels and are satisfied when they ring hollow: what naiveté to demand the great and rare and then to establish, with rage and misanthropy, that they are absent. It is obvious, e.g., that a marriage is worth as much as those whom it joins together, i.e., that in general it will be something wretched and inept: no priest, no mayor can make anything else of it.</p>
<p>Virtue has all the instincts of the average man against it: it is unprofitable, imprudent, it isolates; it is related to passion and not very accessible to reason; it spoils the character, the head, the mind according to the standards of mediocre men; it rouses to enmity toward order, toward the lies that are concealed in every order, institution, actuality-it is the worst of vices, if one judges it by its harmful effect upon others.</p>
<p>-I recognize virtue in that (1) it does not desire to be recog nized; (2) it does not presuppose virtue everywhere, but precisely something else; (3) it does not suffer from the absence of virtue, but on the contrary regards this as the distancing relationship on the basis of which there is something to honor in virtue; it does not communicate itself; (4) it does not propagandize (5) it permits no one to judge it, because it is always virtue for itself;</p>
<p>(p176)</p>
<p>(6) it does precisely all that is generally forbidden: virtue, as I understand it, is the real vetitum?? within all herd legislation; (7) in short, it is virtue in the style of the Renaissance, virtù, moraline-free virtue.78</p>
<p>318 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Above all, gentlemen of virtue, you are not our superiors: we should like you to be a little more modest: it is a miserable self-interest and prudence that suggests your virtue to you. And if you had more strength and courage in you, you would not reduce yourselves to virtuous nonentities in this way. You make what you can of yourselves: partly what you must—what your circumstances force you to, partly what gives you pleasure, partly what seems useful to you. But if you do only what is in keeping with your inclinations, or what necessity demands of you, or what is useful to you, then you should neither praise yourselves nor let others praise you! One is a thoroughly small type of man if one is only virtuous; do not be misled about that! Men who have been in any way notable were never such virtuous asses: their innermost instinct, that of their quantum of power, did not find satisfaction that way: while, with your minimum of power, nothing can seem wiser to you than virtue. But you have numbers on your side; and in so far as you play the tyrant, we shall make war on you</p>
<p>319 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>A virtuous man is a lower species because he is not a &ldquo;per son&rdquo; but acquires his value by conforming to a pattern of man that is fixed once and for all. He does not possess his value apart: he can be compared, he has his equals, he must not be an individual</p>
<p>Reckon up the qualities of the good man: why do they give us pleasure? Because we have no need to fight against them, be cause they impose upon us no mistrust, no need for caution, no marshalling of forces and severity: our laziness, good nature, frivolity, have a good time. It is this pleasant feeling in us that</p>
<p>72 What is forbidden.</p>

<p>(p177)</p>
<p>we project out of us and bestow upon the good man as a quality, as a value.</p>
<p>320 (1888)</p>
<p>Virtue is under certain circumstances merely an honorable form of stupidity: who could be ill-disposed toward it on that account? And this kind of virtue has not been outlived even today. A kind of sturdy peasant simplicity, which, however, is possible in all classes and can be encountered only with respect and a smile, believes even today that everything is in good hands, namely in the &ldquo;hands of God&rdquo;; and when it maintains this proposition with the same modest certainty as it would that two and two make four, we others certainly refrain from contradicting. Why disturb this pure foolishness? Why darken it with our worries about man, people, goal, future? And even if we wanted to do it, we could not. They project their own honorable stupidity and goodness into the heart of things (the old God, deus myops,74 still lives among them!); we others—we read something else into the heart of things: our own enigmatic nature, our contradictions, our deeper, more painful, more mistrustful wisdom.</p>
<p>321 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>He who finds virtue easy also laughs at it. It is impossible to maintain seriousness in virtue: one attains it and leaps beyond it</p>
<p>&ndash;whither? into devilry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, how intelligent all our wicked tendencies and impulses have become! how much scientific inquisitiveness plagues them! So many fishhooks of knowledge!</p>

<p>-To associate vice so closely with something decidedly pain ful that at last one flees from vice in order to be rid of that which is associated with it. This is the famous case of Tannhäuser.

<p>Virtue is no longer believed in, its power of attraction is gone; to restore it, someone would have to know how to take it to market as an unfamiliar form of adventure and excess. It demands too much extravagance and narrow-mindedness of its believers not to have the conscience against it today. To be sure, precisely that may constitute its new charm for unconscionable and totally unscrupu lous people:- it is now what it never was before, a. vice.</p>
<p>325 (Jan-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>Virtue is still the most expensive vice: it should remain so!</p>
<p>326 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Virtues are as dangerous as vices in so far as one lets them rule over one as authorities and laws from without and does not first produce them out of oneself, as one should do, as one&rsquo;s most personal self-defense and necessity, as conditions of precisely our own existence and growth, which we recognize and acknowledge independently of whether other men grow with us under similar or different conditions. This law of the dangerousness of imperson ally understood, objective virtue applies also to modesty: many of the choicest spirits perish through it. The morality of modesty is the worst form of softening for those souls for which it makes sense that they should become hard in time,</p>
<p>327 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>One should reduce and limit the realm of morality step by step: one should bring to light and honor the names of the instincts</p>
<p>(p179)</p>
<p>that are really at work here after they have been hidden for so long beneath hypocritical names of virtue; out of respect for one&rsquo;s &ldquo;honesty,&rdquo; which speaks more and more imperiously, one should unlearn the shame that would like to deny and lie away one&rsquo;s natural instincts. It is a measure of strength how far one can divest oneself of virtue; and a height can be imagined where the concept &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; is so understood that it sounds like virtù, Renaissance virtue, moraline-free virtue.75 But in the meantime-how distant we are from this ideal!</p>
<p>The reduction of the domain of morality: a sign of the progress of this ideal. Wherever one has not yet been capable of causal thinking, one has thought morally.</p>
<p>328 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>In the end; what have I achieved? Let us not hide from our selves this most curious result: I have imparted to virtue a new charm&ndash;the charm of something forbidden. It has our subtlest honesty against it, it is spiced &ldquo;cum grano salis&quot;78 of the sting of scientific conscience; it smells old-fashioned and antique, so that at last it lures the refined and makes them inquisitive-in short, it appears as a vice. Only after we have recognized everything as lies and appearance do we regain the right to this fairest of false hoods, virtue. There is no court of appeal left that could deny it to us: only by exhibiting virtue as a form of immorality do we again justify it-it is classified and compared with reference to its fundamental significance, it is part of the fundamental im morality of all existence as a form of luxury of the first order, the haughtiest, dearest and rarest form of vice.

<li>The Moral Ideal</li>
</ol>
<p>A. Critique of Ideals</p>
<p>330 (1886-1887)</p>
<p>To tackle this in such a way as to abolish the word &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;: critique of desiderata.</p>
<p>331 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Very few are clear as to what the standpoint of desirability, every &ldquo;thus it should be but is not&rdquo; or even &ldquo;thus it should have been,&rdquo; comprises: a condemnation of the total course of things. For in this course nothing exists in isolation; the smallest things bear the greatest, upon your little wrongful act stands the entire structure of the future, every critique of the smallest thing also condemns the whole. Now, granted that the moral norm, even as Kant understood it, has never been completely fulfilled and remains suspended over actuality as a kind of beyond without ever falling down into it, then morality would contain a judgment concerning the whole, which, however, still permits the question: whence does it derive the right to this judgment? How does the part come to sit as judge over the whole</p>
<p>And if this moral judging and dissatisfaction with actuality were in fact, as has been suggested, an ineradicable instinct, might this instinct not be one of the ineradicable stupidities and im modesties of our species?</p>
<p>But in saying this we do that which we censure; the stand point of desirability, of unauthorized playing-the-judge, is part of the character of the course of things, as is every injustice and imperfection-it is precisely our concept of &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; which is never satisfied. Every drive that desires to be satisfied expresses its dissatisfaction with the present state of things: what? is the whole perhaps composed of dissatisfied parts, which all have</p>
<p>&quot; Utilized in Twilight, Chapter 1, section 36 (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 471-72).</p>
<p>(p181) desiderata in their heads? is the &ldquo;course of things&rdquo; perhaps precisely this &ldquo;away from here? away from actuality!&rdquo; eternal dissatisfaction itself? is desirability perhaps the driving force itself? is it deus?78</p>
<p>It seems to me important that one should get rid of the all, the unity, some force, something unconditioned; otherwise one will never cease regarding it as the highest court of appeal and baptizing it &ldquo;God.&rdquo; One must shatter the all; unlearn respect for the all; take what we have given to the unknown and the whole and give it back to what is nearest, what is ours.</p>
<p>When, e.g., Kant says: &ldquo;Two things70 remain forever worthy of reverence&rdquo; (conclusion of the Critique of] Practical Reason)</p>
<p>-today we should sooner say: &ldquo;Digestion is more venerable.&rdquo; The all would always bring the old problems with it &ldquo;How is evil possible?&rdquo; etc. Therefore, there is no all, there is no great sensorium or inventarium or storehouse of force.</p>
<p>332 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) A man as he ought to be: that sounds to us as insipid as &ldquo;a tree as it ought to be.&quot;*80</p>
<p>333 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Ethics: or &ldquo;philosophy of desirability.&rdquo; — &ldquo;Things ought to be different,&rdquo; &ldquo;things shall be different&rdquo;: dissatisfaction would thus be the germ of ethics.</p>
<p>One could rescue oneself from it, firstly by selecting states in which one did not have this feeling; secondly by grasping the presumption and stupidity of it: for to desire that something should be different from what it is means to desire that everything should be different-it involves a condemnatory critique of the whole. 8v But life itself is such a desire!</p>
<p>** God. # &ldquo;The starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This section was used in Twilight, in section 6 of the chapter &ldquo;Morality as Anti-Nature&rdquo; (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 491-92): “Let us finally consider how naive it is altogether to say: &lsquo;Man ought to be such and such!&rsquo; Reality shows us an enchanting wealth of types, the abundance of a lavish play and change of forms&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>$1 At this point the MS still has the words: &ldquo;It is to that extent&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(p182)</p>
<p>To ascertain what is, as it is, seems something unspeakably higher and more serious than any &ldquo;thus it ought to be,&rdquo; because the latter, as a piece of human critique and presumption, appears ludicrous from the start. It expresses a need that desires that the structure of the world should correspond with our human well being; also the will to bring this about as far as possible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is only this desire thus it ought to be&rdquo; that has called forth that other desire to know what is. For the knowledge of what is, is a consequence of that question: &ldquo;How? is it possible? why precisely so?&rdquo; Wonder at the disagreement between our desires and the course of the world has led to our learning to know the course of the world. But perhaps the case is different: perhaps that &ldquo;thus it ought to be&rdquo; is our desire to overcome the world</p>
<p>334 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>Today, when every &ldquo;man ought to be thus and thus&rdquo; is spoken with a grain of irony, when we are altogether convinced that, in spite of all, one will become only that which one is 82 (in spite of all: that means education, instruction, milieu, chance, and acci dent), we have learned to reverse cause and consequences in a curious way in moral matters-nothing perhaps distinguishes us more completely from the old believers in morality. We no longer say, e.g.: &ldquo;Vice is the cause that a man also goes to ruin physio logically&rdquo;&rsquo;; and just as little: &ldquo;A man prospers through virtue, it brings long life and happiness.&rdquo; Our view is rather that vice and virtue are not causes but only consequences. One becomes a decent man because one is a decent man: i.e., because one was born a</p>
<p>Cupitalist of good instincts and prosperous circumstances</p>
<p>If one comes into the world poor, of parents who have squandered everything and saved nothing, one is &ldquo;incorrigible,&rdquo; which means ripe for prison or the madhouse</p>
<p>Today we no longer know how to separate moral and physio logical degeneration: the former is merely a symptom-complex of the latter; one is necessarily bad, just as one is necessarily ill</p>
<p>Bad: here the word expresses a certain incapacity associated physiologically with the degenerating type: e.g., weakness of will,</p>
<p>*Cf. the subtitle of Ecce Homo: &ldquo;How One Becomes What One Is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cf. I&rsquo;wilight, Chapter VI (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 492 f), and sec tions 41-44 above and 380 below.</p>
<p>BOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>insecure and even multiple &ldquo;personality,&rdquo; inability to resist reacting to a stimulus and to &ldquo;control&rdquo; oneself, constraint before every kind of suggestion from the will of another. Vice is not a cause;</p>
<p>vice is a consequence</p>
<p>Vice is a somewhat arbitrarily limited concept designed to express in one word certain consequences of physiological degen eration. A universal proposition such as Christianity teaches.&ldquo;Man is evil&rdquo;&ndash;would be justified if one were justified in taking the degenerate type as the normal type of man. But perhaps this is an exaggeration. To be sure, the proposition is correct wherever Christianity prospers and stays on top: for that demonstrates a morbid soil, a field for degeneration.</p>
<p>335 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) One cannot have too much respect for man when one sees how well he understands how to fight his way through, to endure, to turn circumstances to his own use, to overthrow his adversaries; but when one looks at his desires he appears the absurdest of animals</p>
<p>It is as if he required a playground of cowardice, laziness, weakness, lusciousness, submissiveness for the recreation of his strong and manly virtues: observe human desiderata, his &ldquo;ideals.&rdquo; Desiring man recovers from the eternally valuable in him, from his deeds: he employs nothingness, the absurd, the valueless, the childish for his recovery. The spiritual poverty and lack of in ventiveness of this inventive and resourceful animal are terrible. The &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; is, as it were, the penalty man pays for the tremendous expenditure he has to meet in all actual and pressing tasks. When reality ceases, dream, weariness, weakness come along: &ldquo;the ideal&rdquo; is simply a form of dream, weariness, weakness</p>
<p>The strongest and the most powerless natures become equal when this condition overtakes them: they deify the cessation of work, of war, of passion, of tension, of oppositions, of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in summa—the struggle for knowledge, the exertion of knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocence&rdquo;; that is their name for the ideal state of stupe faction; &ldquo;blessedness&rdquo;: the ideal state of sloth; &ldquo;love&rdquo;: the ideal state of the herd animal that no longer wants to have enemies. Therewith one has raised everything that debases and lowers man to an ideal.84</p>
<p>**Cf. Twilight, section 38 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 541)&ndash;and James Hilton&rsquo;s Lost Horizon.</p>
<p>(p184)</p>
<p>336 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) Desire magnifies that which one desires; it grows even by not</p>
<p>by the most violent and protracted desires. The more our desire for a thing grows, the more value we ascribe to that thing:85 if &ldquo;moral values&rdquo; have become the highest values, this betrays the fact that the moral ideal has been the least fulfilled to that extent it represented a &ldquo;beyond all suffering,&rdquo; as a means to blessed ness), Mankind has embraced, with ever-increasing ardor, nothing but clouds: finally it called its despair, its impotence &ldquo;God&rdquo;.</p>
<p>337 (1887-1888)</p>
<p>Naiveté in respect of ultimate &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo;-while one does not know the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of mankind.</p>
<p>338 (Jan.-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>What is the counterfeiting aspect of morality?- It pretends to know something, namely what &ldquo;good and evil” is. That means wanting to know why mankind is here, its goal, its destiny. That means wanting to know that mankind has a goal, a destiny</p>
<p>339 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>The very obscure and arbitrary idea that mankind has a single task to perform, that it is moving as a whole toward some goal, is still very young. Perhaps we shall be rid of it again before it becomes a &ldquo;fixed idea&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mankind is not a whole: it is an inextricable multiplicity of ascending and descending life-processes it does not have a youth followed by maturity and finally by old age; the strata are twisted and entwined together&ndash;and in a few millennia there may still be even younger types of man than we can show today. Decadence, on the other hand, belongs to all epochs of mankind:</p>
<p>*Cf. R. B. Perry&rsquo;s General Theory of Value (1926). *Cf. Freud.</p>
<p>(p185) refuse and decaying matter are found everywhere; it is one of life&rsquo;s processes to exclude the forms of decline and decay.87</p>
<p>When Christian prejudice was a power, this question did not exist: meaning lay in the salvation of the individual soul; whether mankind could endure for a long or a short time did not come into consideration. The best Christians desired that it should end as soon as possible concerning that which was needful to the individual there was no doubt</p>
<p>The task of every present individual was the same as for a future individual in any kind of future: value, meaning, domain of values were fixed, unconditional, eternal, one with God. That which deviated from this eternal type was sinful, devilish, con demned</p>
<p>For each soul, the gravitational center of valuation was placed within itself: salvation or damnation! The salvation of the immortal soul! Extremest form of personalization For every soul there was only one perfecting; only one ideal; only one way to redemp tion- Extremest form of equality of rights, tied to an optical magnification of one&rsquo;s own importance to the point of insanity Nothing but insanely important souls, revolving about themselves with a frightful fear</p>
<p>No man believes now in this absurd self-inflation: and we have sifted our wisdom through a sieve of contempt. Nevertheless, the optical habit of seeking the value of man in his approach to an ideal man remains undisturbed: fundamentally, one upholds the perspective of personalization as well as equality of rights before the ideal, In summa: one believes one knows what the ultimate desideratum is with regard to the ideal man</p>
<p>This belief, however, is only the consequence of a dreadful deterioration through the Christian ideal: as one at once discovers with every careful examination of the &ldquo;ideal type.&rdquo; One believes one knows, first that an approach to one type is desirable; sec ondly, that one knows what this type is like; thirdly, that every</p>

</ul>
<p>(p186)</p>
<p>deviation from this type is a regression, an inhibition, a loss of force and power in man</p>
<p>To dream of conditions in which this perfect man will be in the vast majority: even our socialists, even the Utilitarians have not gone farther than this.</p>
<p>In this way a goal seems to have entered the development of mankind: at any rate, the belief in progress towards the ideal is the only form in which a goal in history is thought of today. In summa: one has transferred the arrival of the &ldquo;kingdom of God&rdquo; into the future, on earth, in human form—but fundamentally one has held fast to the belief in the old ideal.</p>
<p>340 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>The more concealed forms of the cult of the Christian moral ideal. The insipid and cowardly concept &ldquo;nature&rdquo; devised by nature enthusiasts (-without any instinct for what is fearful, implacable and cynical in even the most beautiful&rdquo; aspects), a kind of attempt to read moral Christian &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; into nature Rousseau&rsquo;s concept of nature, as if &ldquo;nature&rdquo; were freedom, good ness, innocence, fairness, justice, an idyl..still a cult of Christian morality fundamentally.- Collect together passages to see what the poets really admired in, e.g., high mountains, etc.— What Goethe wanted from them-why he admired Spinoza, Com plete ignorance the presupposition for this cult</p>
<p>The insipid and cowardly concept &ldquo;man&rdquo; à la Comte and Stuart Mill, perhaps even the object of a cult. It is still the cult of Christian morality under a new name - The freethinkers, e.g., Guyau.</p>
<p>The insipid and cowardly concept &ldquo;art&rdquo; as sympathy with all that suffers and is ill-constituted (even history, e.g., Thierry&rsquo;s): it is still the cult of the Christian moral ideal.</p>
<p>And now, as for the entire socialist ideal: nothing but a clumsy misunderstanding of that Christian moral ideal.</p>
<p>341 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) The origin of the ideal. Investigation of the soil in which it grows.</p>
<p>a. Proceeding from the &ldquo;aesthetic” states, in which the world is seen fuller, rounder and more perfect-: the pagan ideal: self</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values affirmation predominates (one bestows). The highest type: the classical idealas the expression of the well-constitutedness of all the chief instincts. Therein the highest style: the grand style. Expression of the &ldquo;will to power&rdquo; itself. The instinct that is most feared dares to acknowledge itself.</p>
<p>b. Proceeding from states in which the world is seen emptier, paler, more diluted, in which &ldquo;spiritualization&rdquo; and nonsensuality assume the rank of perfection, in which the brutal, the animalic direct, the proximate are most avoided (one removes, one chooses&mdash;): the &ldquo;sage,&rdquo; the &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; priestly = virginal = igno rant, physiological characteristics of idealists of this sort the anemic ideal. Under certain circumstances it can be the ideal of those who represent the first ideal, the pagan (thus Goethe sees his &ldquo;saint&rdquo; in Spinoza).</p>
<p>c. Proceeding from states in which we find the world more absurd, worse, poorer, more deceptive than we suppose or desire can be consistent with embodying the ideal (-one negates, one destroys ): the projection of the ideal into the antinatural, anti actual, illogical; the state of him who thus judges ( the &ldquo;impov erishment of the world as consequence of suffering: one takes, one no longer gives ): the antinatural ideal.</p>
<p>(The Christian ideal is an intermediate form between the second and third, now with the former, now with the latter pre dominating.)</p>
<p>The three ideals: a. either a strengthening of life (pagan) or b. a dilution of life (anemic) or c. a denial of life (-anti natural). The state of &ldquo;deification&rdquo; is felt: in the greatest abund ance in the most fastidious selectivity&ndash;in contempt for and destruction of life.</p>
<p>342 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>a. The consistent type. Here it is grasped that one must not hate even evil, that one must not oppose it, that one must not make war even against oneself; that one should not merely acquiesce in the suffering that such a way of life entails; that one should live entirely in positive feelings; that one should take the side of one&rsquo;s opponent in word and deed; that through a superfe tation of the peaceable, good-natured, conciliatory, helpful, and loving states one impoverishes the soil in which other states grow</p>
<p>(p188)</p>
<p>&ndash;that one requires a perpetual way of living. What is achieved here? The Buddhist type or the perfect cow.</p>
<p>This standpoint is possible only when no moral fanaticism prevails, i.e., when evil is hated, not for its own sake, but only because it opens the way to states that are harmful to us (unrest, work, care, entanglements, dependence).</p>
<p>This is the Buddhist standpoint: here sin is not hated, here the concept &ldquo;sin&rdquo; is lacking.</p>
<p>b. The inconsistent type. One wages war against evil-one believes that war for the sake of goodness does not have the moral consequences or effect on the character that war otherwise brings with it (and owing to which one detests it as evil). In fact, such a war against evil does much more fundamental harm than any kind of hostility of one person against another; and usually &ldquo;the person&rdquo; is reinterpolated as the opponent, at least in imagination (the devil, evil spirits, etc.). A hostile attitude of watching and spying on everything in us that is bad and might have a bad origin ends in a most tormented and anxious constitution: so that &ldquo;miracles,&rdquo; reward, ecstasy, transcendent solutions now become desirable The Christian type: or the perfect bigot.</p>
<p>c. The stoical type. Firmness, self-control, imperturbability, peace as the inflexibility of a protracted will-profound quiet, the defensive state, the fortress, a warrior&rsquo;s mistrustfulness-firmness of principle; the union of will and knowledge; respect for oneself. Hermit type. The perfect &ldquo;ox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>343 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>An ideal that wants to prevail or assert itself seeks to support itself (a) by a spurious origin, (b) by a pretended relationship with powerful ideals already existing, (c) by the thrill of mystery, as if a power that cannot be questioned spoke through it, (d) by defamation of ideals that oppose it, (e) by a mendacious doctrine of the advantages it brings with it, e.g., happiness, repose of soul, peace or the assistance of a powerful God, etc.— Toward a psy chology of the idealist: Carlyle, Schiller, Michelet.</p>
<p>BOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>If one discovers all the defensive and protective measures by which an ideal maintains itself, is it then refuted? It has employed the means by which all living things live and grow they are one and all &ldquo;immoral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My insight: all the forces and drives by virtue of which life and growth exist lie under the ban of morality: morality as the instinct to deny life. One must destroy morality if one is to liberate life.</p>
<p>344 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>Not to know oneself: prudence of the idealist. The idealist: a creature that has good reasons to be in the dark about itself and is prudent enough to be in the dark about these reasons too.</p>
<p>345.(1885-1886)</p>
<p>Tendency of moral development. Everyone desires that no doctrine or valuation of things should come into favor but that through which he himself prospers. The basic tendency of the weak and mediocre of all ages is, consequently, to weaken and pull down the stronger: chief means, the moral judgment. The attitude of the stronger toward the weaker is branded; the higher states of the stronger acquire an evil name.</p>
<p>The struggle of the many against the few, the commonplace against the rare, the weak against the strong one of the subtlest interruptions of this struggle occurs when the choice, subtle, more fastidious present themselves as the weak and repudiate the coarser means of power</p>
<p>346 (March-June 1888)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pretended pure drive after knowledge in all philoso phers is dictated by their moral &ldquo;truths&rdquo;—is only apparently independent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &ldquo;moral truths,&rdquo; &ldquo;thus one ought to act,&rdquo; are merely forms of consciousness of a tired instinct &ldquo;thus and thus one does act among us.&rdquo; The &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; is supposed to restore and strengthen an instinct; it flatters man to be obedient where he is only an automaton.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(p190)</p>
<p>347 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Morality as a means of seduction.— &ldquo;Nature is good, for a wise and good God is its cause. Who, then, is responsible for the &lsquo;corruption of mankind&rsquo;? Its tyrants and seducers, the ruling orders&ndash;they must be destroyed”-: Rousseau&rsquo;s logic (compare Pascal&rsquo;s logic, which lays the responsibility on original sin).</p>
<p>Compare the related logic of Luther. In both cases a pretext is sought to introduce an insatiable thirst for revenge as a moral religious duty. Hatred for the ruling order seeks to sanctify itself (the &ldquo;sinfulness of Israel&rdquo;: foundation of the power of the priest).</p>
<p>Compare the related logic of Paul. It is always God&rsquo;s cause in which these reactions come forth, the cause of right, of humanity, etc. In the case of Christ, the rejoicing of the people appears as the cause of his execution; an anti-priestly movement from the first. Even in the case of the anti-Semites it is still the same arti fice: to visit condemnatory judgments upon one&rsquo;s opponent and to reserve to oneself the role of retributive justice.</p>
<p>348 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Course of the struggle: the fighter tries to transform his oppo nent into his antithesis-in imagination naturally. He tries to have faith in himself to such a degree that he may have courage for the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; (as if he were the good cause); as if his oppo nent were attacking reason, taste, virtue</p>
<p>The belief he needs as the strongest means of defense and attack is a belief in himself, which, however, knows how to mis understand itself as belief in God:— never to imagine the advan tages and utility of victory, but always victory for the sake of victory, as &ldquo;the victory of God&rdquo;- Every little community (even an individual) that finds itself involved in struggle tries to convince itself: &ldquo;We have good taste, good judgment, and virtue on our side.&rdquo; - The struggle compels to such an exaggeration of self esteem</p>
<p>349 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>Whatever kind of bizarre ideal one may follow (e.g., as &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; or as &ldquo;free spirit&rdquo; or as &ldquo;immoralist&rdquo; or as Reichs</p>
<p>(p191) deutscher88.-), one should not demand that it be the ideal: for one therewith takes from it its privileged character. One should have it in order to distinguish oneself, not in order to level oneself,</p>
<p>How comes it, this notwithstanding, that most idealists at once propagandize for their ideal, as if they could have no right to the ideal if everyone did not recognize it?- This, e.g., is what all those brave little women do who permit themselves to learn Latin and mathematics. What compels them? The instinct of the herd, I fear, terror of the herd: they fight for the &ldquo;emancipation of women&rdquo; because it is under the form of a generous activity, under the banner of &ldquo;For others,&rdquo; that they can most prudently forward their own little private separatism.</p>
<p>Prudence of idealists to be only missionaries and &ldquo;representa tives&rdquo; of an ideal; they &ldquo;transfigure&rdquo; themselves in the eyes of those who believe in disinterestedness and heroism, Whereas: true heroism consists, in not fighting under the banner of sacrifice, devotion, disinterestedness, but in not fighting at all. “This is what I am; this is what I want: you can go to hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>350 (Spring-Fall 1887) Every ideal presupposes love and hate, reverence and con tempt. Either the positive feeling is the primum mobile89 or the negative feeling is. Hate and contempt are, e.g., the primum mobile in all ressentiment ideals.</p>
<p>B. Critique of the &ldquo;Good Man,&rdquo;</p>
<p>the Saint, etc.</p>
<p>351 (Jan.-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;good man.&rdquo; Or: the hemiplegia&rdquo; of virtue. For every strong and natural species of man, love and hate, gratitude and revenge, good nature and anger, affirmative acts and negative acts, belong together. One is good on condition one also knows how to be evil; one is evil because otherwise one would not under stand how to be good. Whence, then, comes the sickness and</p>
<p>&ldquo;A member of the German Reich. Bo First motive.</p>
<p>Paralysis of one side.</p>
<p>(p192)</p>
<p>ideological unnaturalness that rejects this doubleness—that teaches that it is a higher thing to be efficient on only one side? Whence comes the hemiplegia of virtue, the invention of the good man?</p>
<p>The demand is that man should castrate himself of those instincts with which he can be an enemy, can cause harm, can be angry, can demand revenge</p>
<p>This unnaturalness corresponds, then, to that dualistic con ception of a merely good and a merely evil creature (God, spirit, man); in the former are summarized all the positive, in the latter all the negative forces, intentions, states.</p>
<p>Such a manner of valuing believes itself to be &ldquo;idealistic&rdquo;, it does not doubt that, in the conception of &ldquo;the good,&rdquo; it has posited a supreme desideratum. At its peak, it imagines a state in which all that is evil is annulled and in which only good creatures actually remain. It does not even consider it settled that this antithesis of good and evil is conditional on the existence of both; on the contrary, the latter should vanish and the former remain, the one has a right to exist, the other ought not to be there at all</p>
<p>What is it really that desires this?</p>
<p>Much labor has been expended in all ages, and especially in the Christian ages, to reduce mankind to this half-sided efficiency, to the &ldquo;good&rdquo;: even today there is no lack of those deformed and weakened by the church for whom this object coincides with &ldquo;humanization&rdquo; in general, or with the &ldquo;will of God,&rdquo; or with &ldquo;salvation of the soul.” The essential demand here is that mankind should do nothing evil, that it should under no circumstances do harm or desire to do harm. The way to achieve this is: the cas tration of all possibility of enmity, the unhinging of all the instincts of ressentiment, &ldquo;peace of soul&rdquo; as a chronic disease.</p>
<p>This mode of thought, with which a definite type of man is bred, starts from an absurd presupposition: it takes good and evil for realities that contradict one another (not as complementary value concepts, which would be the truth), it advises taking the side of the good, it desires that the good should renounce and oppose the evil down to its ultimate roots&ndash;it therewith actually denies life, which has in all its instincts both Yes and No. Not that it grasps this: it dreams, on the contrary, that it is getting back to wholeness, to unity, to strength of life: it thinks it will be a state of redemption when the inner anarchy, the unrest between those opposing value drives, is at last put an end to.. Perhaps there has never before been a more dangerous ideology,</p>
<p>(p193)</p>
<p>a greater mischief in psychologicis, than this will to good: one has reared the most repellent type, the unfree man, the bigot; one has taught that only as a bigot is one on the right path to god hood, only the bigot&rsquo;s way is God&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>And even here, life is still in the right-life, which does not know how to separate Yes from Nom: what good is it to hold with all one&rsquo;s strength that war is evil, not to do harm, not to desire to negate! one wages war nonetheless! one cannot do otherwise! The good man who has renounced evil, afflicted, as seems to him desirable, with that hemiplegia of virtue, in no way ceases to wage war, have enemies, say No and act No. The Christian, for example, hates &ldquo;sin&rdquo;! Precisely because of his faith in a moral antithesis of good and evil the world has become for him overfull of things that must be hated and eternally combated. &ldquo;The good man&rdquo; sees himself as if surrounded by evil, and under the continual onslaught of evil his eye grows keener, he discovers evil in all his dreams and desires, and so he ends, quite reasonably, by considering nature evil, mankind corrupt, goodness an act of grace (that is, as impossi ble for man). In summa: he denies life, he grasps that when good is the supreme value it condemns life&ndash;</p>

<p>352 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>The concept of power, whether of a god or of a man, always includes both the ability to help and the ability to harm. Thus it is with the Arabs; thus with the Hebrews. Thus with all strong races.</p>
<p>It is a fateful step when one separates the power for the one from the power for the other into a dualism-In this way, morality becomes the poisoner of life</p>
<p>353 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>Toward a critique of the good man. Integrity, dignity, sense of duty, justice, humanity, honesty, straightness, good conscience are certain qualities really affirmed and approved for their own sake with these well-sounding words? or is it a case of qualities and states, in themselves of no particular value, being moved into</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>The WILL TO POWER a certain light in which they acquire value? Does the value of these qualities reside in them or in the use and advantage to which they lead (appear to lead, are expected to lead)?</p>
<p>Naturally, I do not mean by this an antithesis between ego and alterol in the judgment: the question is whether these qualities are supposed to have value on account of their consequences, either for the bearer of these qualities or for the environment, for society, for &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;: or whether they have value in themselves</p>
<p>In other words: is it utility that bids one condemn, combat, deny the opposite qualities (untrustworthiness, falseness, per versity, lack of self-confidence, inhumanity&mdash;-)? Is the essence of such qualities condemned, or only their consequences? In other words: would it be desirable that men with these latter qualities should not exist? In any event, that is what is believed. But here lies the error, the short-sightedness, the narrow-mindedness of nook egoism.</p>
<p>Otherwise expressed: would it be desirable to create condi tions in which all the advantage would be with the righteous-s0 that the opposite natures and instincts would be discouraged and slowly die out?</p>
<p>This is at bottom a question of taste and of aesthetics: would it be desirable that the &ldquo;most respectable,&rdquo; i.e., most tedious, species of man should survive? the square, 02 the virtuous, the worthies, the good people, the straight, the &ldquo;oxen&quot;708</p>
<p>If one imagines the tremendous abundance of the &ldquo;others&rdquo; gode, then even the righteous no longer has a right to existence: he is no longer necessary and here one grasps that it is only coarse utility that has brought such an insufferable virtue into honor.</p>
<p>Perhaps desirability lies on precisely the other side: to create conditions in which the &ldquo;righteous man&rdquo; is reduced to the modest position of a &ldquo;useful tool&rdquo; -as the &ldquo;ideal herd animal,&rdquo; at best herdsman: in short, conditions in which he no longer stands among the higher orders which require other qualities.</p>

<p>take over and over again: he has made a means to life into a standard of life; instead of discovering the standard in the highest enhancement of life itself, in the problem of growth and exhaus tion, he has employed the means to a quite distinct kind of life to exclude all other forms of life, in short to criticize and select life. I.e., man finally loves the means for their own sake and forgets they are means: so that they enter his consciousness as aims, as standards for aimsmi.e., a certain species of man treats the con ditions of its existence as conditions which ought to be imposed as a law, as &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;good,&rdquo; &ldquo;perfection&rdquo;: it tyrannizes- It is a form of faith, of instinct, that a species of man fails to perceive its conditionality, its relativity to other species. At least, it seems to be all over for a species of man (people, races) when it becomes tolerant, allows equal rights and no longer thinks of wanting to be master</p>

<p>One must reckon up what had been accumulated as a conse quence of the highest moral idealism: how almost all other values had crystallized around the ideal.

<p>an expression of egoism, etc. In fact, the false valuation is aimed at the interests: (1) of those who are helped and aided, the herd; (2) it contains a pessimistic mistrustfulness of the basis of life; (3) it would like to deny the most splendid and best-constituted men; fear; (4) it wants to aid the subjected to their rights against their conquerors; (5) it brings with it a universal dishonesty, and precisely among the most valuable men,</p>

<p>Man is an indifferent egoist: even the cleverest thinks his habits more important than his advantage.</p>
<p>364 (1884)</p>
<p>Egoism! But no one has yet asked: what kind of ego? On the contrary, everyone unconsciously thinks every ego equal to every other ego. This is the consequence of the slaves theory of sufrage universel and &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>365 (1884)</p>
<p>The actions of a higher man are indescribably complex in their motivation: any such word as &ldquo;pity&rdquo; says nothing whatever. The most essential thing is the feeling &ldquo;Who am I? who is the other in relation to me?&rdquo;- Value judgments are continually at work.</p>
<p>366 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>That the history of all phenomena of morality could be sim plified in the way Schopenhauer believed.namely, so that pity is to be discovered as the root of all moral impulse hitherto-only a thinker denuded of all historical instinct, and one who had eluded in the strangest way even that strong schooling in history undergone by the Germans from Herder to Hegel, could have attained to this degree of absurdity and naiveté.</p>
<p>367 (1885)</p>
<p>My kind of &ldquo;pity.&rdquo; This is a feeling for which I find no name adequate: I sense it when I see precious capabilities squan</p>
<p>(p199) dered, e.g., at the sight of Luther: what force and what insipid backwoodsman problems! (at a time when in France the bold and light-hearted skepticism of a Montaigne was already possible!) Or when I see anyone halted, as a result of some stupid accident, at something less than he might have become. Or especially at the idea of the lot of mankind, as when I observe with anguish and contempt the politics of present-day Europe, which is, under all circumstances, also working at the web of the future of all men. Yes, what could not become of &ldquo;man,&rdquo; if ! This is a97 kind of &ldquo;compassion&rdquo; although there is really no &ldquo;passion&rdquo; I share.98.</p>
<p>368 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Pity a squandering of feeling, a parasite harmful to moral health, 99 &ldquo;it cannot possibly be our duty to increase the evil in the world.&rdquo; If one does good merely out of pity, it is oneself one really does good to, and not the other. Pity does not depend upon maxims but upon affects;100 it is pathological. The suffering of others infects us, pity is an infection.</p>
<p>369 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>No egoism at all exists that remains within itself and does not encroach-consequently, that &ldquo;allowable,&rdquo; &ldquo;morally indifferent&rdquo; egoism of which you speak does not exist at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One furthers one&rsquo;s ego always at the expense of others;&rdquo; &ldquo;Life always lives at the expense of other life&rdquo;-he who does not grasp this has not taken even the first step toward honesty with himself.</p>

<p>371 (1885-1886) The &ldquo;ego&rdquo;-which is not one with the central government of our naturel-is, indeed, only a conceptual synthesis thus there are no actions prompted by &ldquo;egoism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>372 (1883-1888) As every drive lacks intelligence, the viewpoint of &ldquo;utility&rdquo; cannot exist for it. Every drive, in as much as it is active, sacrifices force and other drives: finally it is checked; otherwise it would destroy everything through its excessiveness. Therefore: the &ldquo;un egoistic,&rdquo; self-sacrificing, imprudent, is nothing special-it is com mon to all the drives&ndash;they do not consider the advantage of the whole ego (because they do not consider at all!), they act contrary to our advantage, against the ego: and often for the ego-innocent in both cases!</p>
<p>373 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>Origin of moral values 101— Egoism is of as much value as the physiological value of him who possesses it.</p>
<p>Every individual consists of the whole course of evolution (and not, as morality imagines, only of something that begins at birth). If he represents the ascending course of mankind, then his value is in fact extraordinary; and extreme care may be taken over the preservation and promotion of his development. (It is concern for the future promised him that gives the well-constituted individ ual such an extraordinary right to egoism.) If he represents the descending course, decay, chronic sickening, then he has little value: and the first demand of fairness is for him to take as little space, force, and sunshine as possible away from the well constituted. In this case, it is the task of society to suppress egoism (which sometimes expresses itself in absurd, morbid and rebel</p>
<p>10* This section was put to use by Nietzsche in Twilight, section 33 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 533 ff). Cf. also Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1169a: &ldquo;The good man ought to be a lover of self, since he will then act nobly, and so both benefit himself and aid his fellows; but the bad man ought not to be a lover of self, since he will follow his base passions, and injure both himself and his neighbors&rdquo; (tr, Rackham, Loeb Classical Library).</p>
<p>(p201)</p>
<p>lious ways), whether it be a question of individuals or of whole decaying and atrophying classes of people. A doctrine and religion of &ldquo;love,&rdquo; of suppression of self-affirmation, of patience, endurance, helpfulness, of cooperation in word and deed, can be of the highest value within such classes, even from the point of view of the rulers: for it suppresses feelings of rivalry, of ressentiment; of envy</p>
<p>the all too natural feelings of the underprivilegedit even deifies a life of slavery, subjection, poverty, sickness, and inferiority for them under the ideal of humility and obedience. This explains why the ruling classes (or races) and individuals have at all times up held the cult of selflessness, the gospel of the lowly, the &ldquo;God on the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preponderance of an altruistic mode of valuation is the consequence of an instinct that one is ill-constituted. The value judgment here is at bottom; &ldquo;I am not worth much&rdquo;: a merely physiological value judgment; even more clearly: the feeling of impotence, the absence of the great affirmative feelings of power (in muscles, nerves, ganglia). This value judgment is translated into a moral or a religious judgment, according to the culture of this class ( the predominance of religious and moral judgments is always a sign of a lower culture-): it seeks to establish itself by relating to spheres in which it recognizes the concept &ldquo;value&rdquo; in general. The interpretation by means of which the Christian sinner believes he understands himself is an attempt to justify his lack of power and self-confidence: he would rather consider him self guilty than feel bad for no reason: it is a symptom of decay to require interpretations of this sort at all.</p>
<p>In other cases, the underprivileged man seeks the reason not in his &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; (as the Christian does), but in society: the socialist, the anarchist, the nihilist-in as much as they find their existence something of which someone must be guilty, they are still the closest relations of the Christian, who also believes he can better endure his sense of sickness and ill-constitutedness by finding someone whom he can make responsible for it. The instinct of revenge and ressentiment appears here in both cases as a means of enduring, as the instinct of self-preservation: just as is the preference for altruistic theory and practice.</p>
<p>Hatred of egoism, whether it be one&rsquo;s own (as with Chris tians) or another&rsquo;s (as with socialists), is thus revealed as a value judgment under the predominating influence of revenge; on the other hand, as an act of prudence for the self-preservation of the</p>
<p>(p202)</p>
<p>suffering by an enhancement of their feelings of cooperation and solidarity</p>
<p>Finally, even that release of ressentiment in the judging, re jecting, punishing of egoism (one&rsquo;s own or another&rsquo;s) is also, as already indicated, an instinct of self-preservation on the part of the underprivileged. In summa: the cult of altruism is a specific form of egoism that regularly appears under certain physiological conditions.</p>
<p>When the socialist with a fine indignation demands &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;equal rights,&rdquo; he is merely acting under the impress of his inadequate culture that cannot explain why he is suffering: on the other hand, he enjoys himself; if he felt better he would re frain from crying out: he would then find pleasure in other things. The same applies to the Christian: he condemns, disparages, curses the &ldquo;world&rdquo; himself not excluded. But that is no reason for taking his clamor seriously. In both cases we are in the presence of invalids who feel better for crying out, for whom defamation is a relief.</p>
<p>374 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>Every society has the tendency to reduce its opponents to caricatures&ndash;at least in imagination-and, as it were, to starve them. Such a caricature is, e.g., our &ldquo;criminal.&rdquo;. Within the aristocratic Roman order of values, the Jew was reduced to a caricature. Among artists, the &ldquo;philistine and bourgeois&rdquo; become caricatures, among the pious, the godless; among aristocrats, the man of the people. Among immoralists it is the moralist: Plato,</p>
<p>for example, becomes a caricature in my hands.</p>
<p>375 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>All the drives and powers that morality praises seem to me to be essentially the same as those it defames and rejects: e.g., justice as will to power, will to truth as a tool of the will to power.</p>
<p>376 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s growing inwardness. Inwardness grows as powerful drives that have been denied outward release by the establishment</p>
<p>(p203)</p>
<p>of peace and society seek compensation by turning inward in concert with the imagination. The thirst for enmity, cruelty, re venge, violence turns back, is repressed;102 in the desire for knowl edge there is avarice and conquest; in the artist there reappears the repressed103 power to dissimulate and lie; the drives are trans formed into demons whom one fights, etc,</p>
<p>377 (1883-1888) Falsity. Every sovereign instinct has the others for its tools, retainers, flatterers: it never lets itself be called by its ugly name: and it countenances no praise in which it is not also praised in directly. All praise and blame in general crystallizes around every sovereign instinct to form a rigorous order and etiquette. This is one of the causes of falsity. *** Every instinct that struggles for mastery but finds itself under a yoke requires for itself, as strengthening and as support for its self-esteem, all the beautiful names and recognized values: so, as a rule, it ventures forth under the name of the &ldquo;master&rdquo; it is combatting and from whom it wants to get free (e.g., the fleshly desires or the desires for power under the dominion of Christian values).- This is the other cause of falsity.</p>
<p>Perfect naiveté reigns in both cases: the falsity does not be come conscious. It is a sign of a broken instinct when man sees the driving force and its &ldquo;expression&rdquo; (&ldquo;the mask&rdquo;) as separate things—a sign of self-contradiction, and victorious far less often. Absolute innocence in bearing, word, affect, a &ldquo;good conscience&rdquo; in falsity, the certainty with which one grasps the greatest and most splendid words and postures-all this is necessary for victory.</p>
<p>In the other case: when one has extreme clearsightedness one needs the genius of the actor and tremendous training in self control if one is to achieve victory. That is why priests are the most skillful conscious hypocrites; then princes, whom rank and ancestry have endowed with a kind of acting ability. Thirdly, men of society, diplomats. Fourthly, women,</p>
<p>Basic idea: falsity seems so profound, so omnisided, the will so clearly opposed to direct self-knowledge and the calling of</p>
<p>102 Tritt zurück.</p>

<p>things by their right names, that it is very highly probable that truth, will to truth is really something else and only a disguise. (The need for faith is the greatest brake-shoe on truthfulness.)</p>
<p>378 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not lie&rdquo;; one demands truthfulness. But acknowl edgement of the factual (refusal to let oneself be lied to) has been greatest precisely among liars: they have recognized that just this popular &ldquo;truthfulness&rdquo; is not a fact. What is said is always too much or too little: the demand that one should denude one self with every word one says is a piece of naiveté.</p>
<p>One says what one thinks, one is &ldquo;truthful,&rdquo; only under certain conditions: namely, that one is understood (inter pares),104 and understood with good will (once again inter pares). One conceals oneself in presence of the unfamiliar: and he who wants to attain something says what he would like to have thought of him, but not what he thinks. (&ldquo;The powerful always lie.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>379 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>The great nihilistic counterfeiting through artful misuse of moral values:</p>
<p>a. Love as depersonalization; also pity.</p>
<p>b. Only the most depersonalized intellect (&ldquo;the philosopher&rdquo;) knows the truth, &ldquo;the true being and nature of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>c. The genius, the great human beings, are great because they do not seek their own advantage: the value of a man increases in proportion as he denies himself.</p>
<p>d. Art as the work of the &ldquo;pure free-willed subject&rdquo;; mis understanding of &ldquo;objectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>e. Happiness as the end of life: virtue as means to an end.</p>
<p>The pessimistic condemnation of life by Schopenhauer is a moral one. Transference of herd standards into the realm of meta physics</p>
<p>The &ldquo;individuum&rdquo; meaningless, necessitating an origin in the &ldquo;in-itself&rdquo; (and an explanation of his existence as an &ldquo;aberration&rdquo;); parents only &ldquo;accidental cause.&rdquo;- We are paying for the fact that science has not understood the individuum: he comprises the en tirety of life hitherto in one development, and is not its result.</p>

<p>380 (Spring-Fall 1887) 1. Systematic falsification of history; so that it may provide the proof of moral valuation:</p>
<p>a. decline of a people and corruption;106 b. rise of a people and virtue; c. zenith of a people (&ldquo;its culture&rdquo;) as consequence of</p>
<p>moral elevation. 2. Systematic falsification of great human beings, the great creators, the great epochs:</p>
<p>one desires that faith should be the distinguishing mark of the great: but slackness, skepticism, &ldquo;immorality,&rdquo; the right to throw off a faith, belong to greatness (Caesar, also Homer, Aristophanes, Leonardo, Goethe). One always sup presses the main thing, their &ldquo;freedom of will”.</p>
<p>381 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Great lie in history: as if the corruption of the church were the cause of the Reformation! Only pretext and self-deception on the part of the instigators-strong needs were present whose brutality very much required a spiritual cloak.108</p>
<p>382 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>Schopenhauer interpreted high intellectuality as liberation from the will; he did not want to see the freedom from moral prejudice which is part of the emancipation of the great spirit, the typical immorality of the genius; he artfully posited the only thing he held in honor, the moral value of &ldquo;depersonalization,&rdquo; as the condition of spiritual activity, of &ldquo;objective&rdquo; viewing. &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; even in art, appears after the withdrawal of the will</p>
<p>I see a fundamentally different valuation cutting across all the moral idiosyncrasies; I know nothing of such an absurd dis tinction between &ldquo;genius&rdquo; and the moral and immoral world of the will. The moral man is a lower species than the immoral, a weaker species; indeedhe is a type in regard to morality, but</p>
<p>105 Cf. section 334 above; also 41-44 and Twilight, Chapter VI (Portable Nietzsche, p. 492 f).</p>
<p>101 See 150n above.</p>
<p>(p206)</p>
<p>not a type in himself; a copy, a good copy at best&ndash;the measure of his value lies outside him. I assess a man by the quantum of power and abundance of his will: not by its enfeeblement and extinction; I regard a philosophy which teaches denial of the will as a teaching of defamation and slandet - I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage; I do not account the evil and painful character of existence a reproach to it, but hope rather that it will one day be more evil and painful than hitherto 107</p>
<p>The high point of the spirit imagined by Schopenhauer was to attain to the recognition that there is no meaning in anything, in short, to recognize what the good man already instinctively does&mdash;He denies the possibility of a higher kind of intellect&ndash;he took his insight for a non plus ultra. Here spirituality is placed much lower than goodriess; its highest value (e.g., as art) would be to urge and prepare moral conversion: absolute domination of moral values.</p>
<p>Beside Schopenhauer I would characterize Kant: nothing Greek, absolutely antihistorical (his passage on the French Revo lution) and a moral fanatic (Goethe&rsquo;s passage on radical evil). Saintliness was in the background in his case, too.</p>
<p>I need a critique of the saint Hegel&rsquo;s value. &ldquo;Passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper&rsquo;s philosophy of Mr. Spencer; complete absence of an ideal, except that of the mediocre man.</p>
<p>Fundamental instinctive principle of all philosophers and his torians and psychologists: everything of value in man, art, history, science, religion, technology must be proved to be of moral value, morally conditioned, in aim, means and outcome. Everything under stood in the light of the supreme value: e.g., Rousseau&rsquo;s question concerning civilization: &ldquo;Does man become better through it?&quot;-an amusing question, since the reverse is obvious and is precisely that which speaks in favor of civilization.</p>
<p>383 (March-June 1888) Religious morality - Affect, great desire, the passion for power, love, revenge, possessions—: moralists want to extinguish and uproot them, to &ldquo;purify&rdquo; the soul of them.</p>
<p>107 Italics supplied. In the original only &ldquo;power&rdquo; and &ldquo;will&rdquo; are empha sized. Sections 382-88 are of exceptional interest,</p>
<p>(p207)</p>
<p>The logic is: the desires often produce great misfortune consequently they are evil, reprehensible. A man must free himself from them: otherwise he cannot be a good man</p>
<p>This is the same logic as: &ldquo;if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.&rdquo; In the particular case in which that dangerous &ldquo;innocent from the country,&rdquo; the founder of Christianity, recommended this practice to his disciples, the case of sexual excitation, the conse quence is, unfortunately, not only the loss of an organ but the emasculation of a man&rsquo;s character And the same applies to the moralist&rsquo;s madness that demands, instead of the restraining of the passions, their extirpation, Its conclusion is always: only the castrated man is a good man,</p>
<p>Instead of taking into service the great sources of strength, those impetuous torrents of the soul that are so often dangerous and overwhelming, and economizing them, this most shortsighted and pernicious mode of thought, the moral mode of thought, wants to make them dry up. 108</p>
<p>384 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>Overcoming of the affects? -No, if what is implied is their weakening and extirpation. But putting them into service: which may also mean subjecting them to a protracted tyranny (not only as an individual, but as a community, race, etc.). At last they are confidently granted freedom again: they love us as good servants and go voluntarily wherever our best interests lie.</p>

<p>Moral intolerance is an expression of weakness in a man: he is afraid of his own &ldquo;immorality,&rdquo; he must deny his strongest drives because he does not yet know how to employ them. Thus the most fruitful regions of the earth remain uncultivated the longest: the force is lacking that could here become master</p>

<p>There are very naive peoples and men who believe that con tinual fine weather is something desirable: even today they believe,</p>

<p>(p208)</p>
<p>in rebus moralibus, 100 that the &ldquo;good man,&rdquo; and nothing but the &ldquo;good man,&rdquo; is something desirable and that the course of human evolution is directed toward the survival of the &ldquo;good man&rdquo; only (and that one must bend all one&rsquo;s efforts in that direction-). This is in the highest degree an uneconomic thought and, as stated, the acme of naiveté, nothing but the expression of the pleasing effect produced by the &ldquo;good man&rdquo; (-he arouses no fear, he permits one to relax, he gives what one is able to take).110</p>
<p>From a superior viewpoint one desires the contrary: the ever-increasing dominion of evil, the growing emancipation of man from the narrow and fear-ridden bonds of morality, the in crease of force, in order to press the mightiest natural powers the affects-into service.</p>

<p>The whole conception of an order of rank among the passions: as if the right and normal thing were for one to be guided by reason-with the passions as abnormal, dangerous, semi-animal, and, moreover, so far as their aim is concerned, nothing other than desires for pleasure</p>

<p>*** Moral matters.</p>
<p>110 The reading &ldquo;nothing but the expression&rdquo; is doubtful, as the words in the MS are somewhat illegible.</p>
<p>In the first edition (1901) only the first paragraph was printed (as sec tion 225). In the MS the second paragraph does not follow the first; it appears earlier in the same notebook, preceded by the words: &ldquo;The same kind of man who wishes us &lsquo;good weather also wishes only for &lsquo;good men and, quite generally, for good qualities at least the ever-growing dominion of what is good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(p209)</p>
<p>zation, it was precisely the affects of love, goodness, pity, even those of justice, magnanimity, heroism, that were necessarily misunderstood: 111</p>
<p>It is richness in personality, abundance in oneself, over flowing and bestowing, instinctive good health and affirmation of oneself, that produce great sacrifice and great love: it is strong and godlike selfhood from which these affects grow, just as surely as do the desire to become master, encroachment, the inner certainty of having a right to everything. What according to common ideas are opposite dispositions are rather one disposition, and if one is not firm and brave within oneself, one has nothing to bestow and cannot stretch out one&rsquo;s hand to protect and support &hellip;</p>
<p>How was one able so to transform these instincts that man thought valuable that which was directed against his self? when he sacrificed his self to another self. Oh the psychological wretched ness and mendaciousness that has hitherto laid down the law in the church and in church-infected philosophy!</p>
<p>If man is sinful through and through, then he ought only to hate himself. Fundamentally, he would have to treat his fellow men on the same basis as he treats himself, charity needs to be justified-its justification lies in the fact that God has commanded it. It follows from this, that all the natural instincts of man (the instinct of love, etc.) appear to be forbidden in themselves and only after they have been denied are they restored to their rights on the basis of obedience to God-Pascal, the admirable logician of Christianity, went so far! consider his relations to his sister. &ldquo;Not to make oneself love&quot;112 seemed Christian to him.</p>
<p>389 (1883-1888)</p>
<p>Let us consider the cost of such a moral canon (&ldquo;an ideal&rdquo;). (Its enemies are well? The &ldquo;egoists.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The melancholic astuteness in self-disparagement in Europe (Pascal, La Rochefoucauld)—the inner enfeeblement, discour agement, self-vexation of the non-herd animals</p>
<p>the perpetual emphasizing of the qualities of mediocrity as the most valuable (modesty in rank and file, the tool-like nature) -</p>
<p>the bad conscience associated with all that is self-glorifying and original;</p>

<p>therefore displeasure; therefore the world of the more strongly constituted made gloomy!</p>
<p>herd-consciousness transferred to philosophy and religion; also its timorousness.</p>
<p>Let us leave aşide the psychological impossibility of a purely selfless action!</p>
<p>390 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)</p>
<p>My final proposition is: that the actual man represents a much higher value than the “desirable&rdquo; man of any ideal hitherto; that all &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo; with reference to man have been absurd and dangerous excesses through which a single type of man tried to establish his conditions of preservation and growth as a law for all mankind; that every &ldquo;desideratum&rdquo; of this kind ever brought into a position of dominance has reduced the value of man, his strength, his certainty of the future; that the nook-intellectuality and poverty. of spirit of man is most apparent, even today, when he desires; that man&rsquo;s ability to posit values has hitherto been too little developed for him to be just, not merely to the &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; values, but to the real values of man; that the ideal has hitherto been the actual force for disparaging the world and man, the poisonous vapor over reality, the great seduction to nothingness</p>

<p>393 (Spring-Fall 1887)</p>
<p>Thought about the most universal subjects is always behind the times: the ultimate &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo; for. mankind, for example, have never really been grasped as a problem by philosophers. They all naively postulate the &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; of man as if an intuition answered for us the question why we ought to &ldquo;improve.&rdquo; TO what extent is it desirable that man should become more virtuous? or cleverer? or happier? Provided we do not already know the &ldquo;wherefore&rdquo; of mankind, such an outlook has no meaning; and if one desires one of these things, who knows, perhaps one is pre cluded from desiring the others. Is an increase in virtuousness compatible with an increase in cleverness and insight? Dubito;113 only too often I shall have occasion to show the reverse. Has virtuousness as a goal not hitherto been in the most rigorous sense incompatible with being happy? does it not, on the contrary, re quire misfortune, self-denial and self-mistreatment as a necessary means? And if the deepest insight were the goal, would one not then have to renounce the increase of happiness? and choose danger, adventure, mistrust, seduction as the road to insight And if one desires happiness, well, perhaps one has to become one of the &ldquo;poor in spirit.”</p>
<p>394 (March-June 1888)</p>
<p>The universal deception and cheating in the realm of so called moral improvement.&mdash; We do not believe that a man will become another if he is not that other already; i.e., if he is not, as is often the case, a multiplicity of persons, at least the embryos of persons. In this case, one can bring a different role into the foreground and draw &ldquo;the former man” back- The aspect is changed, not the essence. That someone ceases to perform certain actions is a mere fatum brutumi14 that permits the most various interpretations. It is not always the case that the habit of a certain act is broken, the ultimate reason for it removed. He who is a criminal through fate and facility unlearns nothing, but learns more and more: and a long abstinence even acts as a tonic to his talent</p>
<p>113 I doubt [it]. 131 Brute fate.</p>
<p>(p212)</p>
<p>For society, to be sure, all that is of interest is precisely that someone no longer performs certain actions: to this end it removes him from those conditions in which he can perform certain actions; that is wiser, in any event, than to attempt the impossible, namely, to disrupt the fatality by which he is thus and thus. The church and in this it has done nothing but succeed and inherit from the philosophy of antiquity&ndash;proceeding from a different standard and desiring to save a &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; the &ldquo;eternal destiny&rdquo; of a soul, first believes in the expiatory power of punishment and then in the obliterating power of forgiveness: both are deceptions of religious prejudice-punishment does not expiate, forgiveness does not ex tinguish, what is done is not undone. That someone forgets some thing is certainly not evidence that something has ceased to exist</p>
<p>A deed produces its consequences, within the man and out side the man, regardless of whether it is considered as punished, &ldquo;expiated.&rdquo; &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo; and &ldquo;extinguished,&rdquo; regardless of whether the church has in the meantime promoted the doer to a saint. The church believes in things that do not exist, in &ldquo;souls;&rdquo; it believes in effects that do not exist, in divine effects; it believes in states that do not exist, in sin, in redemption, in the salvation of the soul: it stays everywhere on the surface, at signs, gestures, words to which it gives an arbitrary meaning. It possesses a thoroughly thought-out method of psychological counterfeiting.</p>
<p>395 (1887-1888) &ldquo;Jllness makes men better&rdquo;: this famous opinion, which one encounters throughout the centuries, in the mouth of the sage as often as in the mouth and maw of the people, makes one wonder. As to whether it is valid, one would like to ask; were morality and illness originally connected, perhaps? The &ldquo;improve ment of man,&rdquo; regarded as a whole, e.g., the undeniable softening, humanizing, mellowing of the European within the last millennium</p>
<p>is it perhaps the result of long hidden and mysterious suffering and failure, abstinence, stunting? Has &ldquo;illness&rdquo; made the European “better&rdquo;? Or, in other words; is our morality&ndash;Our modern sensi tive European morality, which may be compared with the morality of the Chinese&ndash;the expression of a physiological regression?</p>
<p>For one cannot deny that every period in history in which &ldquo;man&rdquo; has shown himself in exceptional splendor and power at once assumed an impetuous, dangerous, and eruptive character</p>
<p>BOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values</p>

<p>under which humanity fared ill; and perhaps in those cases in which it seems otherwise, all that was lacking was the courage or subtlety to take psychology into the depths and to find there, too, the universal law: &ldquo;the healthier, stronger, richer, more fruitful, more enterprising a man feels, the more &lsquo;immoral&rsquo; he will be, too.&rdquo; A painful thought! in which one certainly ought not to indulge! If, however, one goes along with it for just a few moments, how astonishing the future seems then! What would then be paid for more dearly than precisely that which we are promoting with all our strength&ndash;the humanizing, the &ldquo;improvement,&rdquo; the grow ing &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; of man? Nothing would be more costly than virtue: for one would in the end have turned the earth into a hospital: and ultimate wisdom would be &ldquo;everyone as everyone else&rsquo;s nurse.&rdquo; To be sure, one would then possess that much desired &ldquo;peace on earth&rdquo;! But how little &ldquo;delight in each other&rdquo;! How little beauty, high spirits, daring, danger! How few &ldquo;works.&rdquo; for the sake of which life on earth is worth while! And, alas, no more &ldquo;deeds&rdquo; whatever! Al great works and deeds that have re mained and have not been washed away by the waters of time were they not all in the profoundest sense immoralities?&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>396 (Jan.-Fall 1888) The priests&ndash;and with them the semi-priests, the philosophers -have at all times called true any teaching whose educative effect was beneficial or seemed beneficial-which &ldquo;improved.&rdquo; In this they resemble a naive quack and miracle man of the people, who, because he has used a poison as a cure, denies it is a poison &ldquo;By their fruits shall ye know them-namely, our &rsquo;truths&rsquo; &ldquo;: that has been the reasoning of the priests to this day. With fateful results, they have expended their subtlety to make the &ldquo;proof of power&rdquo; (or &ldquo;from their fruits”) pre-eminent, even decisive, above all other forms of proof. “What makes good must be good; what is good cannot lie&rdquo;_that is their relentless conclusion ; &ldquo;what bears good fruit must be true: there is no other criterion of truth&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if &ldquo;making better&rdquo; counts as an argument, then making worse must count as a refutation, One can prove an error to be an error by testing the lives of those who espouse it: a mistake, a vice can refute This most indecent form of opposition, from behind and below, the doglike form of opposition, has not died out either: the priests, in so far as they are psychologists, have</p>
<p>(p214)</p>
<p>never discovered anything more interesting than to spiff at the secrets of their adversaries&ndash;they demonstrate their Christianity by looking about the &ldquo;world&rdquo; for filth. Especially with the first men of the world, with the &ldquo;geniuses”: one will remember how Goethe has been attacked in Germany at all times (Klopstock and Herder were the first to provide a &ldquo;good example&rdquo; of this kind sticks to kind).</p>
<p>397 (Jan-Fall 1888) One must be very immoral in order to make morals by deeds. The means of the moralist are the most terrible means that have ever been employed; he who has not the courage for immorality in deeds is fit for anything, but he is not fit to be a moralist.</p>
<p>Morality is a menagerie; its presupposition is that iron bars can be more profitable than freedom, even for the prisoners; its other presupposition is that there exist animal-trainers who are not afraid of terrible means who know how to handle red-hot iron. This frightful species which takes up the fight against the wild animal is called &ldquo;priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man, imprisoned in an iron cage of errors, became a carica ture of man, sick, wretched, ill-disposed toward himself, full of hatred for the impulses of life, full of mistrust of all that is beauti ful and happy in life, à walking picture of misery: this artificial, arbitrary, recent abortion that the priests have pulled up out of their soil, the &ldquo;sinner&rdquo;: how shall we be able, in spite of all, to justify this phenomenon?</p>
<p>In order to be fair to morality, we must put two zoological concepts in its place: taming of the beast and breeding of a particular species.</p>
<p>The priests have pretended at all times that they want to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; — But we others would laugh if an animal-trainer spoke of his &ldquo;improved&rdquo; animals. In most cases, the taming of a beast is achieved through the harming of a beast: the moral man, too, is not a better man but only a weaker one. But he is less harmful&ndash;115</p>
<p>11 Cf. Twilight, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Improvers&rsquo; of Mankind&rdquo; (Portable Nietzsche, p. 501 i).</p>
<p>(p215)</p>
<p>398 (Jan.-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>What I want to make clear by all the means in my power:</p>
<p>a. that there is no worse confusion than the confusion of breeding with taming; which is what has been done Breeding, as I understand it, is a means of storing up the tremendous forces of mankind so that the generations can build upon the work of their forefathers&ndash;not only outwardly, but inwardly, organically growing out of them and becoming something stronger</p>
<p>b. that it is extraordinarily dangerous to believe that man kind as a whole will progress and grow stronger if individuals become flabby, equal, average Mankind is an abstraction: the goal of breeding, even in the case of a single individual, can only be the stronger man (the man without breeding is weak, ex travagant, unstable ).</p>

<li>Further Considerations for a</li>
</ol>
<p>Critique of Morality</p>
<p>399 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>These are the demands I make upon you—however ill they may sound to you; that you should undertake a critique of the moral evaluations themselves. That you should call a halt to the moral impulse, which here demands submission and not a critique, with the question: &ldquo;why submission?&rdquo; That you should regard this demand for a &ldquo;wherefore?&rdquo;, for a critique of morality, as precisely your present form of morality, as the sublimest form of morality, which does honor to you and to your age. That our honesty, our will not to deceive ourselves, must prove itself: why not?&mdash; Before what tribunal? The will not to let oneself be de ceived is of different origin; a caution against being overpowered, exploited—one of life&rsquo;s instincts of self-defense. 110</p>
<p>114 The last sentence, omitted from all editions, has here been restored, and the penultimate sentence revised, in acordance with the MS and 1911, p. 504.</p>
<p>For the contrast implicit in the last two sentences see also The Gay Science, Book V, section 344, which is discussed at length in my Nietzsche, Chapter 12, section III.216</p>
<p>THE WILL. TO POWER</p>
<p>400 (1883-1888) The three assertions: The ignoble is the higher (protest of the &ldquo;common man&rdquo;); the antinatural is the higher (protest of the underprivileged);</p>
<p>the average is the higher (protest of the herd, of the &ldquo;medi ocre&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Thus in the history of morality a will to power finds expres sion, through which now the slaves and oppressed, now the ill constituted and those who suffer from themselves, now the mediocre attempt to make those value judgments prevail that are favorable to them.</p>
<p>To this extent, the phenomenon of morality is, from a bio logical standpoint, highly suspicious. Morality has developed hitherto at the expense of: the rulers and their specific instincts, the well-constituted and beautiful natures, those who are in any sense independent and privileged.</p>
<p>Morality is therefore an opposition movement against the efforts of nature to achieve a higher type. Its effect is: mistrust of life in general (in so far as its tendencies are considered &ldquo;im moral&rdquo;)-hostility toward the senses (in so far as the supreme values are considered to be opposed to the supreme instincts) degeneration and self-destruction of &ldquo;higher natures,&rdquo; because it is precisely in them that the conflict becomes conscious.</p>
<p>401 (March-June 1888) The Values That Have Been on Top Hitherto</p>
<p>Morality as the supreme value, in all phases of philosophy (even among the skeptics). Result: this world is good for nothing, there must be a &ldquo;real world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What really determines the supreme value here? What is morality really? The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted and disinherited who in this way take their revenge and play the master</p>
<p>Historical proof: the philosophers always decadents, always in the service of the nihilistic religions.</p>
<p>The instinct of decadence which appears as will to power. Introduction of its system of means: absolute immorality of means.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values General insight: supreme values hitherto are a special case of the will to power; morality itself is a special case of immorality.</p>
<p>Why the Opposing Values Always Succumbed 1. How was this really possible? Question: why did life, physiological well-constitutedness everywhere succumb? Why was there no affirmative philosophy, no affirmative religion?</p>
<p>The historical signs of such movements: the pagan religion. Dionysus versus the &ldquo;Crucified.&rdquo; The Renaissance. Art.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The strong and the weak: the healthy and the sick; the exception and the rule. There is no doubt who is the stronger</li>
</ol>
<p>General aspect of history: Is man therefore an exception in the history of life? -Objection to Darwinism. The means the weak employ to keep themselves on top have become instincts, &ldquo;humanity,&rdquo; &ldquo;institutions&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Proof of this dominion in our political instincts, in our social value judgments, in our arts, in our science.</li>
</ol>
<p>The declining instincts have become master over the ascending instincts. The will to nothingness has become master over the will to life!</p>
<p>-Is this true? is there perhaps not a stronger guarantee of life in this victory of the weak and mediocre?is it perhaps only a means in the total movement of life, a slackening of tempo? a self-defense against something even worse?</p>
<p>-Suppose the strong had become master in everything, and even in moral valuation: let us draw the consequences of how they would think about sickness, suffering, sacrifice! Self-con tempt on the part of the weak would be the result; they would try to disappear and extinguish themselves. And would this be desirable?&ndash;and would we really want a world in which the in fluence of the weak, their subtlety, consideration, spirituality, pliancy was lacking?</p>
<p>We have seen two &ldquo;wills to power&rdquo; in conflict (in this special case: we had a principle, that of considering right those who hitherto succumbed, and wrong those who hitherto prevailed): we have recognized the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; as a &ldquo;false world&rdquo; and</p>
<p>(p218)</p>
<p>morality as a form of immorality. We do not say: &ldquo;The stronger is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have grasped what it was that determined supreme value and why it became master over the opposing valuation, it was stronger numerically.</p>
<p>Now let us purify the opposite valuation of the infection and half-measures of the degeneration characteristic of the form in which it is known to us.</p>
<p>Restoration of nature: moraline-free.</p>
<p>402 (Jan.-Fall 1888)</p>
<p>Morality a useful error; more clearly in the case of the greatest and least prejudiced of its advocates, a lie that is con sidered necessary.</p>
<p>403 (1886-1887)</p>
<p>One may admit the truth to oneself to the point where one is sufficiently elevated no longer to require the disciplinary school of (moral]118 errorWhen one judges existence morally, it disgusts.</p>
<p>One should not invent unreal persons, e.g., one should not say &ldquo;nature is cruel.&rdquo; Precisely the insight that no such central responsible being exists is a relief!</p>
<p>Evolution of man. a. To gain power over nature and in ad dition a certain power over oneself. (Morality was needed that man might prevail in his struggle with nature and the &ldquo;wild animal.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>b. If power has been attained over nature, one can employ this power in the further free development of oneself: will to power as self-elevation and strengthening,</p>
<p>404 (1886-1887)</p>

<p>Profoundest gratitude for that which morality has achieved hitherto; but now it is only a burden which may become a fatality! Morality itself, in the form of honesty, compels us to deny morality.</p>
<p>405 (1885-1886)</p>
<p>End 117</p>
<p>To what an extent the self-destruction of morality is still a part of its own force. We Europeans have in us the blood of those who died for their faith; we have taken morality to be serious and awesome, and there is nothing that we have not in some way sacrificed to it. On the other hand: our spiritual subtlety has es sentially been attained through conscience-vivisection. We do not yet know the &ldquo;wither&rdquo; toward which we are driven once we have detached ourselves from our old soil. But it was from this same soil that we acquired the force which now drives us forth into the distance, into adventures, thrusting us into the boundless, the un tried, the undiscovered we have no choice left, we have to be conquerors once we no longer have any country in which we are at home, in which we would want to preserve&rdquo; things. A con cealed Yes drives us that is stronger than all our No&rsquo;s. Our strength itself will no longer endure us in the old decaying soil: we venture away, we venture ourselves: the world is still rich and undiscovered, and even to perish is better than to become half hearted and poisonous. Our strength itself drives us to sea, where all suns have hitherto gone down: we know of a new world</p>
