<p>Nihilism As an Outcome of the Valuations and Interpretations of Existence Which Have Prevailed Heretofore.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What does Nihilism mean?—<em>That the highest values are losing their value.</em> There is no bourne. There is no answer to the question: &ldquo;to what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Thorough Nihilism is the conviction that life is absurd, in the light of the highest values already discovered; it also includes the <em>view</em> that we have not the smallest right to assume the existence of transcendental objects or things in themselves, which would be either divine or morality incarnate.</p>
<p>This view is a result of fully developed &ldquo;truthfulness&rdquo;: therefore a consequence of the belief in morality.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What <em>advantages</em> did the Christian hypothesis of morality offer?</p>
<p>(1) It bestowed an intrinsic value upon men, which contrasted with their apparent insignificance and subordination to chance in the eternal flux of becoming and perishing.</p>
<p>(2) It served the purpose of God&rsquo;s advocates, inasmuch as it granted the world a certain <em>perfection</em> despite its sorrow and evil—it also granted the world that proverbial &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;: evil seemed full of <em>meaning</em>.</p>
<p>(3) It assumed that man could have a <em>knowledge</em> of absolute values, and thus granted him <em>adequate perception</em> for the most important things.</p>
<p>(4) It prevented man from despising himself as man, from turning against life, and from being driven to despair by knowledge: it was a self-preservative measure.</p>
<p>In short: Morality was the great <em>antidote</em> against practical and theoretical Nihilism.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>But among the forces reared by morality, there was <em>truthfulness</em>: this in the end turns against morality, exposes the <em>teleology</em> of the latter, its interestedness, and now the <em>recognition</em> of this lie so long incorporated, from which we despaired of ever freeing ourselves, acts just like a stimulus. We perceive certain needs in ourselves, implanted during the long dynasty of the moral interpretation of life, which now seem to us to be needs of untruth: on the other hand, those very needs represent the highest values owing to which we are able to endure life. We have <em>ceased</em> from attaching any worth to what we know, and we <em>dare</em> not attach any more worth to that with which we would fain deceive ourselves—from this antagonism there results a process of dissolution.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the <em>antinomy</em>: In so far as we believe in morality, we condemn existence.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The highest values in the service of which man ought to live, more particularly when they oppressed and constrained him most—these <em>social values, owing to their tone-strengthening</em> tendencies, were built over men&rsquo;s heads as though they were the will of God or &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; or the actual world, or even a hope of a world to come. Now that the lowly origin of these values has become known, the whole universe seems to have been transvalued and to have lost its significance—but this is only an intermediate stage.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The consequence of <em>Nihilism</em> (disbelief in all values) as a result of a moral valuation:—<em>We have grown to dislike egotism</em> (even though we have realised the impossibility of altruism);—<em>we have grown to dislike what is most necessary</em> (although we have recognised the impossibility of a <em>liberum arbitrium</em> and of an &ldquo;intelligible freedom&rdquo;[1]). We perceive that we do not reach the spheres in which we have set our values—at the same time those other spheres in which we live have <em>not</em> thereby gained <em>one iota</em> in value. On the contrary, we are <em>tired,</em> because we have lost the main incentive to live. &ldquo;All in vain hitherto!&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Pessimism as a preparatory state to Nihilism.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A. Pessimism viewed as strength—<em>in what respect?</em> In the energy of its logic, as anarchy, Nihilism, and analysis.</p>
<p>B. Pessimism regarded as collapse—<em>in what sense?</em> In the sense of its being a softening influence, a sort of cosmopolitan befingering, a &ldquo;tout comprendre,&rdquo; and historical spirit.</p>
<p><em>Critical tension</em>: extremes make their appearance and become dominant.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The logic of Pessimism leads finally to Nihilism: what is the force at work?</em>—The notion that <em>there are no values,</em> and <em>no purpose</em>: the recognition of the part that moral valuations have played in all other lofty values.</p>
<p>Result: <em>moral valuations are condemnations, negations; morality is the abdication of the will to live&hellip;.</em></p>
<p>[1] This is a Kantian term. Kant recognised two kinds of Freedom—the practical and the transcendental kind. The first belongs to the phenomenal, the second to the intelligible world.—TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S NOTE.</p>

</ol>
<p>The Collapse of Cosmopolitan Values.</p>
<p><em>A.</em></p>
<p>Nihilism will have to manifest itself as a <em>psychological condition, first</em> when we have sought in all that has happened a purpose which is not there: so that the seeker will ultimately lose courage. Nihilism is therefore the coming into consciousness of the long <em>waste</em> of strength, the pain of &ldquo;futility,&rdquo; uncertainty, the lack of an opportunity to recover in some way, or to attain to a state of peace concerning anything—shame in one&rsquo;s own presence, as if one had <em>cheated</em> oneself too long&hellip;. The purpose above-mentioned might have been achieved: in the form of a &ldquo;realisation&rdquo; of a most high canon of morality in all worldly phenomena, the moral order of the universe; or in the form of the increase of love and harmony in the traffic of humanity; or in the nearer approach to a general condition of happiness; or even in the march towards general nonentity—any sort of goal always constitutes a purpose. The common factor to all these appearances is that something will be <em>attained,</em> through the process itself: and now we perceive that Becoming has been aiming at <em>nothing,</em> and has achieved nothing. Hence the disillusionment in regard to a so-called <em>purpose in existence,</em> as a cause of Nihilism; whether this be in respect of a very definite purpose, or generalised into the recognition that all the hypotheses are false which have hitherto been offered as to the object of life, and which relate to the whole of &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; (man <em>no longer</em> an assistant in, let alone the culmination of, the evolutionary process).</p>
<p>Nihilism will manifest itself as a psychological condition, in the second place, when man has fixed a totality, a systematisation, even an organisation in and behind all phenomena, so that the soul thirsting for respect and admiration will wallow in the general idea of a highest ruling and administrative power (if it be the soul of a logician, the sequence of consequences and perfect reasoning will suffice to conciliate everything). A kind of unity, some form of &ldquo;monism&rdquo;:&rsquo; and as a result of this belief man becomes obsessed by a feeling of profound relativity and dependence in the presence of an All which is infinitely superior to him, a sort of divinity. &ldquo;The general good exacts the surrender of the individual &hellip;&rdquo; but lo, there is no such general good! At bottom, man loses the belief in his own worth when no infinitely precious entity manifests itself through him—that is to say, he conceived such an All, <em>in order to be able to believe in his own worth.</em></p>
<p>Nihilism, as a psychological condition, has yet a third and last form. Admitting these two <em>points of view</em>: that no purpose can be assigned to Becoming, and that no great entity rules behind all Becoming, in which the individual may completely lose himself as in an element of superior value; there still remains the <em>subterfuge</em> which would consist in condemning this whole world of Becoming as an illusion, and in discovering a world which would lie beyond it, and would be a <em>real</em> world. The moment, however, that man perceives that this world has been devised only for the purpose of meeting certain psychological needs, and that he has no right whatsoever to it, the final form of Nihilism comes into being, which comprises <em>a denial of a metaphysical world,</em> and which forbids itself all belief in a <em>real</em> world. From this standpoint, the reality of Becoming is the only reality that is admitted: all bypaths to back-worlds and false godheads are abandoned—but <em>this world is no longer endured, although no one wishes to disown it.</em></p>
<p>What has actually happened? The feeling of worthlessness was realised when it was understood that neither the notion of &ldquo;<em>Purpose</em>&rdquo; nor that of &ldquo;<em>Unity</em>&rdquo; nor that of &ldquo;<em>Truth</em>&rdquo; could be made to interpret the general character of existence. Nothing is achieved or obtained thereby; the unity which intervenes in the multiplicity of events is entirely lacking: the character of existence is not &ldquo;true,&rdquo; it is <em>false</em>; there is certainly no longer any reason to believe in a <em>real</em> world. In short, the categories, &ldquo;Purpose,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Being,&rdquo; by means of which we had lent some worth to life, we have once more divorced from it—and the world now appears <em>worthless</em> to us&hellip;.</p>
<p><em>B.</em></p>
<p>Admitting that we have recognised the impossibility of <em>interpreting</em> world by means of these three categories, and that from this standpoint the world begins to be worthless to us; we must ask ourselves whence we derived our belief in these three categories. Let us see if it is possible to refuse to believe in them. If we can <em>deprive them of their value,</em> the proof that they cannot be applied to the world, is no longer a sufficient reason for <em>depriving that world of its value</em>.</p>
<p>Result: <em>The belief</em> in the categories of reason[2] is the cause of Nihilism—we have measured the worth of the world according to categories <em>which can only be applied to a purely fictitious world.</em></p>
<p>Conclusion: All values with which we have tried, hitherto, to lend the world some worth, from our point of view, and with which we have therefore <em>deprived it of all worth</em> (once these values have been shown to be inapplicable)—all these values, are, psychologically, the results of certain views of utility, established for the purpose of maintaining and increasing the dominion of certain communities: but falsely projected into the nature of things. It is always man&rsquo;s <em>exaggerated ingenuousness</em> to regard himself as the sense and measure of all things.</p>
<p>[2] This probably refers to Kant&rsquo;s celebrated table of twelve categories. The four classes, quantity, quality, relation, and modality, are each provided with three categories.—TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S NOTE.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Nihilism represents an intermediary pathological condition (the vast generalisation, the conclusion that there <em>is no purpose</em> in anything, is pathological): whether it be that the productive forces are not yet strong enough—or that <em>decadence</em> still hesitates and has not yet discovered its expedients.</p>
<p><em>The conditions of this hypothesis</em>:—That there is <em>no truth</em>; that there is no absolute state of affairs—no &ldquo;thing-in-itself.&rdquo; <em>This alone is Nihilism, and of the most extreme kind.</em> It finds that the value of things consists precisely in the fact that these values are <em>not</em> real and never have been real, but that they are only a symptom of strength on the part of the <em>valuer,</em> a simplification serving the <em>purposes of existence.</em></p>
<ol start="14">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Values and their modification</em> are related to the <em>growth of power of the valuer.</em></p>
<p>The measure of <em>disbelief</em> and of the &ldquo;freedom of spirit&rdquo; which is tolerated, viewed as an <em>expression of the growth of power.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nihilism&rdquo; viewed as the ideal of the <em>highest spiritual power,</em> of the over-rich life, partly destructive, partly ironical.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What is <em>belief</em>? How is a belief born? All belief assumes that <em>something is true.</em></p>
<p>The extremest form of Nihilism would mean that <em>all</em> belief—all assumption of truth—is false: because no real world is at hand. It were therefore: only an <em>appearance seen in perspective,</em> whose origin must be found in us (seeing that we are constantly in need of a narrower, a shortened, and simplified world).</p>
<p>This should be realised, that the extent to which we can, in our heart of hearts, acknowledge appearance, and the necessity of falsehood, without going to rack and ruin, is the <em>measure of strength.</em></p>
<p>In this respect, Nihilism, in that it is the <em>negation</em> of a real world and of Being, might be <em>a divine view of the world.</em></p>
<ol start="16">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If we are disillusioned, we have not become so in regard to life, but owing to the fact that our eyes have been opened to all kinds of &ldquo;desiderata.&rdquo; With mocking anger we survey that which is called &ldquo;<em>Ideal</em>&rdquo;: we despise ourselves only because we are unable at every moment of our lives to quell that absurd emotion which is called &ldquo;Idealism.&rdquo; This <em>pampering</em> by means of ideals is stronger than the anger of the <em>disillusioned one.</em></p>

<p><em>To what extent does Schopenhauerian Nihilism continue to be the result of the same ideal as that which gave rise to Christian Theism?</em> The amount of certainty concerning the most exalted desiderata, the highest values and the greatest degree of perfection, was so great, that the philosophers started out from it as if it had been an <em>a priori</em> and <em>absolute fact</em>: &ldquo;God&rdquo; at the head, as the <em>given quantity</em>—Truth. &ldquo;To become like God,&rdquo; &ldquo;to be absorbed into the Divine Being&rdquo;—these were for centuries the most ingenuous and most convincing desiderata (but that which convinces is not necessarily true on that account: it is <em>nothing more nor less than convincing.</em> An observation for donkeys).</p>
<p>The granting of a <em>personal-reality</em> to this accretion of ideals has been unlearned: people have become atheistic. But has the ideal actually been abandoned? The latest metaphysicians, as a matter of fact, still seek their true &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in it—the &ldquo;thing-in-itself&rdquo; beside which everything else is merely appearance. Their dogma is, that because our world of appearance is so obviously <em>not</em> the expression of that ideal, it therefore cannot be &ldquo;true&rdquo;—and at bottom does not even lead back to that metaphysical world as cause. The unconditioned, in so far as it stands for that highest degree of perfection, cannot possibly be the reason of all the conditioned. Schopenhauer, who desired it otherwise, was obliged to imagine this metaphysical basis as the antithesis to the ideal, as &ldquo;an evil, blind will&rdquo;: thus it could be &ldquo;that which appears,&rdquo; that which manifests itself in the world of appearance. But even so, he did not give up that ideal absolute—he circumvented it&hellip;.</p>
<p>(Kant seems to have needed the hypothesis of &ldquo;intelligible freedom,&rdquo;[3] in order to relieve the <em>ens perfectum</em> of the responsibility of having contrived this world as it is, in short, in order to explain evil: scandalous logic for a philosopher!).</p>

<p><em>The most general sign of modern times</em>: in his own estimation, man has lost an infinite amount of <em>dignity.</em> For a long time he was the centre and tragic hero of life in general; then he endeavoured to demonstrate at least his relationship to the most essential and in itself most valuable side of life—as all metaphysicians do, who wish to hold fast to the <em>dignity of man,</em> in their belief that moral values are cardinal values. He who has let God go, clings all the more strongly to the belief in morality.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Every purely <em>moral</em> valuation (as, for instance, the Buddhistic) <em>terminates in Nihilism</em>: Europe must expect the same thing! It is supposed that one can get along with a morality bereft of a religious background; but in this direction the road to Nihilism is opened. There is nothing in religion which compels us to regard ourselves as valuing creatures.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The question which Nihilism puts, namely, &ldquo;to what purpose?&rdquo; is the outcome of a habit, hitherto, to regard the purpose as something fixed, given and exacted <em>from outside</em>—that is to say, by some supernatural authority. Once the belief in this has been unlearned, the force of an old habit leads to the search after <em>another</em> authority, which would <em>know how to speak unconditionally,</em> and could <em>point to</em> goals and missions. The authority of the <em>conscience</em> now takes the first place (the more <em>morality</em> is emancipated from theology, the more imperative does it become) as a compensation for the <em>personal authority.</em> Or the authority of <em>reason.</em> Or the <em>gregarious instinct</em> (the herd). Or history with its <em>immanent</em> spirit, which has its goal in itself, and to which one can <em>abandon oneself.</em> One would like to <em>evade</em> the <em>will,</em> as also the <em>willing</em> of a goal and the risk of setting oneself a goal. One would like to get rid of the responsibility (<em>Fatalism</em> would be accepted). Finally: Happiness and with a dash of humbug, the <em>happiness of the greatest number.</em></p>
<p>It is said:—</p>
<p>(1) A definite goal is quite unnecessary.</p>
<p>(2) Such a goal cannot possibly be foreseen. Precisely now, when <em>will</em> in its <em>fullest strength</em> were <em>necessary,</em> it is in the <em>weakest</em> and most <em>pusillanimous</em> condition. <em>Absolute mistrust concerning the organising power</em> of the will.</p>

<p><em>The perfect Nihilist.</em>—The Nihilist&rsquo;s eye <em>idealises in an ugly sense,</em> and is inconstant to what it remembers: it allows its recollections to go astray and to fade, it does not protect them from that cadaverous coloration with which weakness dyes all that is distant and past. And what it does not do for itself it fails to do for the whole of mankind as well—that is to say, it allows it to drop.</p>

<p>Nihilism. It may be <em>two things</em>:—</p>
<p>A. Nihilism as a sign of <em>enhanced spiritual strength</em>: active Nihilism.</p>
<p>B. Nihilism as a sign of the <em>collapse</em> and <em>decline</em> of spiritual <em>strength</em>: passive Nihilism.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Nihilism, a <em>normal</em> condition.</p>
<p>It may be a sign of <em>strength</em>; spiritual vigour may have increased to such an extent that the <em>goals</em> toward which man has marched <em>hitherto</em> (the &ldquo;convictions,&rdquo; articles of faith) are no longer suited to it (for a faith generally expresses the exigencies of the <em>conditions of existence,</em> a submission to the authority of an order of things which <em>conduces</em> to the <em>prosperity,</em> the <em>growth</em> and <em>power</em> of a living creature &hellip;); on the other hand, a sign of <em>insufficient</em> strength, to fix a goal, a &ldquo;wherefore,&rdquo; and a faith for itself.</p>
<p>It reaches its <em>maximum</em> of relative strength, as a powerful <em>destructive</em> force, in the form of <em>active Nihilism.</em></p>
<p>Its opposite would be <em>weary</em> Nihilism, which no longer attacks: its most renowned form being Buddhism: as <em>passive</em> Nihilism, a sign of weakness: spiritual strength may be fatigued, <em>exhausted,</em> so that the goals and values which have prevailed <em>hitherto</em> are no longer suited to it and are no longer believed in—so that the synthesis of values and goals (upon which every strong culture stands) decomposes, and the different values contend with one another: <em>Disintegration,</em> then everything which is relieving, which heals, becalms, or stupefies, steps into the foreground under the cover of various <em>disguises,</em> either religious, moral, political or æsthetic, etc.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Nihilism is not only a meditating over the &ldquo;in vain!&quot;—not only the belief that everything deserves to perish; but one actually puts one&rsquo;s shoulder to the plough; <em>one destroys.</em> This, if you will, is illogical; but the Nihilist does not believe in the necessity of being logical&hellip;. It is the condition of strong minds and wills; and to these it is impossible to be satisfied with the negation of judgment: the <em>negation by deeds</em> proceeds from their nature. Annihilation by the reasoning faculty seconds annihilation by the hand.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Concerning the genesis of the Nihilist.</em> The courage of all one really <em>knows</em> comes but late in life. It is only quite recently that I have acknowledged to myself that heretofore I have been a Nihilist from top to toe. The energy and thoroughness with which I marched forward as a Nihilist deceived me concerning this fundamental principle. When one is progressing towards a goal it seems impossible that &ldquo;aimlessness <em>per se</em>&rdquo; should be one&rsquo;s fundamental article of faith.</p>

<p><em>The Pessimism of strong natures.</em> The &ldquo;wherefore&rdquo; after a terrible struggle, even after victory. That something may exist which is a hundred times <em>more important</em> than the question, whether we feel well or unwell, is the fundamental instinct of all strong natures—and consequently too, whether the <em>others</em> feel well or unwell. In short, that we have a purpose, for which we would not even hesitate to <em>sacrifice men,</em> run all risks, and bend our backs to the worst: <em>this is the great passion</em>.</p>

<p>Further Causes of Nihilism.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The causes of Nihilism</em>: (1) <em>The higher species is lacking, i.e.,</em> the species whose inexhaustible fruitfulness and power would uphold our belief in Man (think only of what is owed to Napoleon—almost all the higher hopes of this century).</p>
<p>(2) <em>The inferior species</em> (&ldquo;herd,&rdquo; &ldquo;ass,&rdquo; &ldquo;society&rdquo;) is forgetting modesty, and inflates its needs into <em>cosmic</em> and <em>metaphysical</em> values. In this way all life is <em>vulgarised</em>: for inasmuch as the <em>mass</em> of mankind rules, it tyrannises over the <em>exceptions,</em> so that these lose their belief in themselves and become <em>Nihilists.</em></p>
<p>All attempts to <em>conceive of a new species</em> come to nothing (&ldquo;romanticism,&rdquo; the artist, the philosopher; against Carlyle&rsquo;s attempt to lend them the highest moral values).</p>
<p>The result is that higher types are <em>resisted</em>.</p>
<p><em>The downfall and insecurity of all higher types.</em> The struggle against genius (&ldquo;popular poetry,&rdquo; etc.). Sympathy with the lowly and the suffering as a <em>standard</em> for the <em>elevation of the soul</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>philosopher is lacking,</em> the interpreter of deeds, and not alone he who poetises them.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Imperfect</em> Nihilism—its forms: we are now surrounded by them.</p>
<p>All attempts made to escape Nihilism, which do not consist in transvaluing the values that have prevailed hitherto, only make the matter worse; they complicate the problem.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The varieties of self-stupefaction.</em> In one&rsquo;s heart of hearts, not to know, whither? Emptiness. The attempt to rise superior to it all by means of emotional intoxication: emotional intoxication in the form of music, in the form of cruelty in the tragic joy over the ruin of the noblest, and in the form of blind, gushing enthusiasm over individual <em>men</em> or distinct <em>periods</em> (in the form of hatred, etc.). The attempt to work blindly, like a scientific instrument; to keep an eye on the many small joys, like an investigator, for instance (modesty towards oneself); the mysticism of the voluptuous <em>joy</em> of eternal emptiness; art &ldquo;for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; (&ldquo;le fait&rdquo;), &ldquo;immaculate investigation,&rdquo; in the form of narcotics against the disgust of oneself; any kind of incessant work, <em>any</em> kind of small foolish fanaticism; the medley of all means, illness as the result of general profligacy (dissipation kills pleasure).</p>
<p>(1) As a result, feeble will-power.</p>
<p>(2) Excessive pride and the humiliation of petty weakness felt as a contrast.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The time is coming when we shall have to pay for having been <em>Christians</em> for two thousand years: we are losing the equilibrium which enables us to live—for a long while we shall not know in what direction we are travelling. We are hurling ourselves headlong into the <em>opposite</em> valuations, with that degree of energy which could only have been engendered in man by an <em>overvaluation</em> of himself.</p>
<p>Now, everything is false from the root, words and nothing but words, confused, feeble, or over-strained.</p>
<p><em>(a)</em> There is a seeking after a sort of earthly solution of the problem of life, but in the same sense as that of the <em>final triumph</em> of truth, love, justice (socialism: &ldquo;equality of persons&rdquo;).</p>
<p><em>(b)</em> There is also an attempt to hold fast to the <em>moral ideal</em> (with altruism, self-sacrifice, and the denial of the will, in the front rank).</p>
<p><em>(c)</em> There is even an attempt to hold fast to a &ldquo;Beyond&rdquo;: were it only as an antilogical <em>x</em>; but it is forthwith interpreted in such a way that a kind of metaphysical solace, after the old style, may be derived from it.</p>
<p><em>(d)</em> There is an attempt to read the phenomena of life in such a way as to arrive <em>at the divine guidance of old,</em> with its powers of rewarding, punishing, educating, and of generally conducing to a something <em>better</em> in the order of things.</p>
<p><em>(e)</em> People once more believe in good and evil; so that the victory of the good and the annihilation of the evil is regarded as a <em>duty</em> (this is English, and is typical of that blockhead, John Stuart Mill).</p>
<p>(f) The contempt felt for &ldquo;naturalness,&rdquo; for the desires and for the ego: the attempt to regard even the highest intellectuality of art as a result of an impersonal and disinterested attitude.</p>
<p>(g) The Church is still allowed to meddle in all the essential occurrences and incidents in the life of the individual, with a view to consecrating it and giving it a <em>loftier</em> meaning: we still have the &ldquo;Christian State&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Christian marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="31">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>There have been more thoughtful and more destructively thoughtful[4] times than ours: times like those in which Buddha appeared, for instance, in which the people themselves, after centuries of sectarian quarrels, had sunk so deeply into the abyss of philosophical dogmas, as, from time to time, European people have done in regard to the fine points of religious dogma. &ldquo;Literature&rdquo; and the press would be the last things to seduce one to any high opinion of the spirit of our times: the millions of Spiritists, and a Christianity with gymnastic exercises of that ghastly ugliness which is characteristic of all English inventions, throw more light on the subject.</p>
<p>European <em>Pessimism</em> is still in its infancy—a fact which argues against it: it has not yet attained to that prodigious and yearning fixity of sight to which it attained in India once upon a time, and in which nonentity is reflected; there is still too much of the &ldquo;ready-made,&rdquo; and not enough of the &ldquo;evolved&rdquo; in its constitution, too much learned and poetic Pessimism; I mean that a good deal of it has been discovered, invented, and &ldquo;created,&rdquo; but not caused.</p>
<p>[4] <em>zerdachtere</em>.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Criticism of the Pessimism which has prevailed hitherto. The want of the eudæmonological standpoint, as a last abbreviation of the question: what is the <em>purpose</em> of it all? The reduction of gloom.</p>
<p><em>Our</em> Pessimism: the world has not the value which we believed it to have,—our faith itself has so increased our instinct for research that we are <em>compelled</em> to say this to-day. In the first place, it seems of less value: <em>at first it is felt</em> to be of less value,—only in this sense are we pessimists,—that is to say, with the will to acknowledge this transvaluation without reserve, and no longer, as heretofore, to deceive ourselves and chant the old old story.</p>
<p>It is precisely in this way that we find the pathos which urges us to seek for <em>new values.</em> In short: the world might have far more value than we thought—we must get behind the <em>naïveté of our ideals,</em> for it is possible that, in our conscious effort to give it the highest interpretation, we have not bestowed even a moderately just value upon it.</p>
<p>What has been <em>deified</em>? The valuing instinct inside the <em>community</em> (that which enabled it to survive).</p>
<p>What has been <em>calumniated</em>? That which has tended to separate higher men from their inferiors, the instincts which cleave gulfs and build barriers.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Causes effecting the <em>rise of Pessimism</em>:—</p>
<p>(1) The most powerful instincts and those which promised most for the future have hitherto been <em>calumniated,</em> so that life has a curse upon it.</p>
<p>(2) The growing bravery and the more daring mistrust on the part of man have led him to discover the fact that <em>these instincts cannot be cut adrift from life,</em> and thus he turns to embrace life.</p>
<p>(3) Only the most <em>mediocre,</em> who are not <em>conscious</em> of this conflict, prosper; the higher species fail, and as an example of degeneration tend to dispose all hearts against them—on the other hand, there is some indignation caused by the mediocre positing themselves as the end and meaning of all things. No one can any longer reply to the question: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(4) Belittlement, susceptibility to pain, unrest, haste, and confusion are steadily increasing—the materialisation of all these tendencies, which is called &ldquo;civilisation,&rdquo; becomes every day more simple, with the result that, in the face of the monstrous machine, the individual <em>despairs</em> and <em>surrenders.</em></p>
<ol start="34">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Modern Pessimism is an expression of the uselessness only of the <em>modern</em> world, not of the world and existence as such.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The &ldquo;preponderance of <em>pain over pleasure&rdquo;</em> or the reverse (Hedonism); both of these doctrines are already signposts to Nihilism&hellip;.</p>
<p>For here, in both cases, no other final purpose is sought than the phenomenon pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>But only a man who no longer dares to posit a will, a purpose, and a final goal can speak in this way—according to every healthy type of man, the worth of life is certainly not measured by the standard of these secondary things. And a <em>preponderance</em> of pain would be possible and, <em>in spite of it,</em> a mighty will, a <em>saying of yea</em> to life, and a holding of this preponderance for necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is not worth living&rdquo;; &ldquo;Resignation&rdquo;; &ldquo;what is the good of tears?&quot;—this is a feeble and sentimental attitude of mind. &ldquo;<em>Un monstre gai vaut mieux qu&rsquo;un sentimental ennuyeux.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="36">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The philosophie Nihilist is convinced that all phenomena are without sense and are in vain, and that there ought to be no such thing as Being without sense and in vain. But whence comes this &ldquo;There ought not to be?&quot;—whence this &ldquo;sense&rdquo; and <em>this standard</em>? At bottom the Nihilist supposes that the sight of such a desolate, useless Being is <em>unsatisfying</em> to the philosopher, and fills him with desolation and despair. This aspect of the case is opposed to our subtle sensibilities as a philosopher. It leads to the absurd conclusion that the character of existence <em>must perforce afford pleasure to the philosopher</em> if it is to have any right to subsist.</p>
<p>Now it is easy to understand that happiness and unhappiness, within the phenomena of this world, can only serve the purpose of <em>means</em>: the question yet remaining to be answered is, whether it <em>will ever be possible</em> for us to perceive the &ldquo;object&rdquo; and &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of life—whether the problem of purposelessness or the reverse is not quite beyond our ken.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The development of <em>Nihilism out of Pessimism.</em> The denaturalisation of <em>Values.</em> Scholasticism of values. The values isolated, idealistic, instead of ruling and leading action, turn <em>against</em> it and condemn it.</p>
<p>Opposites introduced in the place of natural gradations and ranks. Hatred of the order of rank. Opposites are compatible with a plebeian age, because they are more easy to grasp.</p>
<p>The <em>rejected</em> world is opposed to an artificially constructed &ldquo;true and valuable&rdquo; one. At last we discover out of what material the &ldquo;true&rdquo; world was built; all that remains, now, is the rejected world, and to the account of our reasons for <em>rejecting it we place our greatest disillusionment.</em></p>
<p>At this point <em>Nihilism</em> is reached; the directing values have been retained—nothing more!</p>
<p>This gives rise to <em>the problem of strength and weakness</em>:—</p>
<p>(1) The weak fall to pieces upon it;</p>
<p>(2) The strong destroy what does not fall to pieces of its own accord;</p>
<p>(3) The strongest overcome the directing values.</p>

<p>The Nihilistic Movement As an Expression of Decadence.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Just lately an accidental and in every way inappropriate term has been very much misused: everywhere people are speaking of &ldquo;<em>Pessimism</em>,&rdquo;  and there is a fight around the question (to which some replies must be forthcoming): which is right—Pessimism or Optimism?</p>
<p>People have not yet seen what is so terribly-obvious—namely, that Pessimism is not a problem but a <em>symptom,</em>—that the term ought to be replaced by &ldquo;Nihilism,&quot;—that the question, &ldquo;to be or not to be,&rdquo; is itself an illness, a sign of degeneracy, an idiosyncrasy.</p>
<p>The Nihilistic movement is only an expression of physiological decadence.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>To be understood</em>:—That every kind of decline and tendency to sickness has incessantly been at work in helping to create general evaluations: that in those valuations which now dominate, decadence has even begun to preponderate, that we have not only to combat the conditions which present misery and degeneration have brought into being; but that all decadence, previous to that of our own times, has been transmitted and has therefore remained an <em>active force</em> amongst us. A universal departure of this kind, on the part of man, from his fundamental instincts, such universal decadence of the valuing judgment, is the note of interrogation <em>par excellence,</em> the real riddle, which the animal &ldquo;man&rdquo; sets to all philosophers.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The notion &ldquo;decadence&rdquo;:—Decay, decline,</em> and <em>waste,</em> are, <em>per se,</em> in no way open to objection;they are the natural consequences of life and vital growth. The phenomenon of decadence is just as necessary to life as advance or progress is: we are not in a position which enables us to <em>suppress</em> it. On the contrary, reason <em>would have it retain its rights.</em></p>
<p>It is disgraceful on the part of socialist-theorists to argue that circumstances and social combinations could be devised which would put an end to all vice, illness, crime, prostitution, and poverty&hellip;. But that is tantamount to condemning <em>Life</em> &hellip; a society is not at liberty to remain young. And even in its prime it must bring forth ordure and decaying matter. The more energetically and daringly it advances, the richer will it be in failures and in deformities, and the nearer it will be to its fall. Age is not deferred by means of institutions. Nor is illness. Nor is vice.</p>
<ol start="41">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Fundamental aspect of the nature of decadence: <em>what has heretofore been regarded as its causes are its effects.</em></p>
<p>In this way, the whole perspective <em>of the problems of morality</em> is altered.</p>
<p>All the struggle of morals against vice, luxury, crime, and even against illness, seems a <em>naïveté,</em> a superfluous effort: there is no such thing as &ldquo;<em>improvement</em>&rdquo; (a word against <em>repentance</em>).</p>
<p>Decadence itself is not a thing <em>that can be withstood</em>: it is absolutely necessary and is proper to all ages and all peoples. That which must be withstood, and by all means in our power, is the spreading of the contagion among the sound parts of the organism.</p>
<p>Is that done? The very <em>reverse</em> is done. It is precisely on this account that one makes a stand on behalf of <em>humanity.</em></p>
<p>How do the <em>highest values</em> created hitherto stand in relation to this fundamental question in <em>biology</em>? Philosophy, religion, morality, art, etc.</p>
<p>(The remedy: militarism, for instance, from Napoleon onwards, who regarded civilisation as his natural enemy.)</p>
<ol start="42">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>All those things which heretofore have been regarded as the <em>causes of degeneration,</em> are really its effects.</p>
<p>But those things also which have been regarded as the <em>remedies</em> of degeneration are only <em>palliatives</em> of certain effects thereof: the &ldquo;cured&rdquo; are <em>types of the degenerate.</em></p>
<p><em>The results of decadence</em>: vice—viciousness; illness—sickliness; crime—criminality; celibacy—sterility; hysteria—the weakness of the will; alcoholism; pessimism, anarchy; debauchery (also of the spirit). The calumniators, underminers, sceptics, and destroyers.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Concerning the notion &ldquo;decadence.&rdquo; (1) Scepticism is a result of decadence: just as spiritual debauchery is.</p>
<p>(2) Moral corruption is a result of decadence (the weakness of the will and the need of strong stimulants).</p>
<p>(3) Remedies, whether psychological or moral, do not alter the march of decadence, they do not arrest anything; physiologically they do not count.</p>
<p>A peep into the <em>enormous futility</em> of these pretentious &ldquo;reactions&rdquo;; they are forms of anæsthetising oneself against certain fatal symptoms resulting from the prevailing condition of things; they do not eradicate the morbid element; they are often heroic attempts to cancel the decadent man, to allow only a minimum of his <em>deleterious influence</em> to survive.</p>
<p>(4) Nihilism is not a cause, but only the <em>rationale</em> of decadence.</p>
<p>(5) The &ldquo;good&rdquo; and the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; are no more than two types of decadence: they come together in all its fundamental phenomena.</p>
<p>(6) The <em>social problem</em> is a result of <em>decadence.</em></p>
<p>(7) Illnesses, more particularly those attacking the nerves and the head, are signs that the <em>defensive</em> strength of strong nature is lacking; a proof of this is that irritability which causes pleasure and pain to be regarded as problems of the first order.</p>
<ol start="44">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The most common types of decadence</em>: (1) In the belief that they are remedies, cures are chosen which only precipitate exhaustion;—this is the case with Christianity (to point to the most egregious example of mistaken instinct);—this is also the case with &ldquo;progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2) The <em>power of resisting</em> stimuli is on the wane—chance rules supreme: events are inflated and drawn out until they appear monstrous &hellip; a suppression of the &ldquo;personality,&rdquo; a disintegration of the will; in this regard we may mention a whole class of morality, the altruistic, that which is incessantly preaching pity, and whose most essential feature is the weakness of the personality, so that it <em>rings in unison,</em> and, like an over-sensitive string, does not cease from vibrating &hellip; extreme irritability&hellip;.</p>
<p>(3) Cause and effect are confounded: decadence is not understood as physiological, and its results are taken to be the causes of the general indisposition:—this applies to all religious morality.</p>
<p>(4) A state of affairs is desired in which suffering shall cease; life is actually considered the cause of all ills—<em>unconscious</em> and insensitive states (sleep and syncope) are held in incomparably higher esteem than the conscious states; hence a <em>method</em> of life.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Concerning the hygiene of the &ldquo;weak.&rdquo; All that is done in weakness ends in failure. Moral: do nothing. The worst of it is, that precisely the strength required in order to stop action, and to cease from reacting, is most seriously diseased under the influence of weakness: that one never reacts more promptly or more blindly than when one should not react at all.</p>
<p>The strength of a character is shown by the ability to delay and postpone reaction: a certain ἀδιαφορία is just as proper to it, as involuntariness in recoiling, suddenness and lack of restraint in &ldquo;action,&rdquo; are proper to weakness. The will is weak: and the recipe for preventing foolish acts would be: to have a strong will and to do nothing—contradiction. A sort of self-destruction, the instinct of self-preservation is compromised&hellip;. <em>The weak man injures himself</em>&hellip;. That is the decadent <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we meet with a vast amount of thought concerning the means wherewith <em>impassibility</em> may be induced. To this extent, the instincts are on the right scent; for to do nothing is more useful than to do something&hellip;.</p>
<p>All the practices of private orders, of solitary philosophers, and of fakirs, are suggested by a correct consideration of the fact, that a certain kind of man is most <em>useful to himself</em> when he hinders his own action as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>Relieving measures</em>: absolute obedience, mechanical activity, total isolation from men and things that might exact immediate decisions and actions.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Weakness of Will</em>: this is a fable that can lead astray. For there is no will, consequently neither a strong nor a weak one. The  multiplicity and disintegration of the instincts, the want of system in their relationship, constitute what is known as a &ldquo;weak will&rdquo;; their co-ordination, under the government of one individual among them, results in a &ldquo;strong will&rdquo;—in the first case vacillation and a lack of equilibrium is noticeable: in the second, precision and definite direction.</p>
<ol start="47">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>That which is inherited is not illness, but a <em>predisposition to illness</em>: a lack of the powers of resistance against injurious external influences, etc. etc, broken powers of resistance; expressed morally: resignation and humility in the presence of the enemy.</p>
<p>I have often wondered whether it would not be possible to class all the highest values of the philosophies, moralities, and religions which have been devised hitherto, with the values of the feeble, the <em>insane</em> and the <em>neurasthenic</em> in a milder form, they present the same evils.</p>
<p>The value of all morbid conditions consists in the fact that they magnify certain normal phenomena which are difficult to discern in normal conditions&hellip;.</p>
<p><em>Health</em> and <em>illness</em> are not essentially different, as the ancient doctors believed and as a few practitioners still believe to-day. They cannot be imagined as two distinct principles or entities which fight for the living organism and make it their battlefield. That is nonsense and mere idle gossip, which no longer holds water. As a matter of fact, there is only a difference of degree between these two living conditions: exaggeration, want of proportion, want of harmony among the normal phenomena, constitute the morbid state (Claude Bernard).</p>
<p>Just as &ldquo;evil&rdquo; may be regarded as exaggeration, discord, and want of proportion, so can &ldquo;good&rdquo; be regarded as a sort of protective diet against the danger of exaggeration, discord, and want of proportion.</p>
<p><em>Hereditary weakness</em> as a <em>dominant</em> feeling: the cause of the prevailing values.</p>
<p><em>N.B.</em>—Weakness is in demand—why?&hellip; mostly because people cannot be anything else than weak.</p>
<p><em>Weakening considered a duty</em>: The weakening of the desires, of the feelings of pleasure and of pain, of the will to power, of the will to pride, to property and to more property; weakening in the form of humility; weakening in the form of a belief; weakening in the form of repugnance and shame in the presence of all that is natural—in the form of a denial of life, in the form of illness and chronic feebleness; weakening in the form of a refusal to take revenge, to offer resistance, to become an enemy, and to show anger.</p>
<p><em>Blunders</em> in the treatment: there is no attempt at combating weakness by means of any fortifying system; but by a sort of justification consisting of moralising; <em>i.e.,</em> by means of <em>interpretation.</em></p>
<p>Two totally different conditions are <em>confused</em>: for instance, the <em>repose of strength,</em> which is essentially abstinence from reaction (the prototype of the gods whom nothing moves), and the <em>peace of exhaustion,</em> rigidity to the point of anæsthesia. All these philosophic and ascetic modes of procedure aspire to the second state, but actually pretend to attain to the first &hellip; for they ascribe to the condition they have reached the attributes that would be in keeping only with a divine state.</p>
<ol start="48">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The most dangerous misunderstanding.</em>—There is one concept which apparently allows of no confusion or ambiguity, and that is the concept <em>exhaustion.</em> Exhaustion may be acquired or inherited—in any case it alters the aspect and <em>value of things.</em></p>
<p>Unlike him who involuntarily <em>gives</em> of the superabundance which he both feels and represents, to the things about him, and who sees them fuller, mightier, and more pregnant with promises,—who, in fact, <em>can</em> bestow,—the exhausted one belittles and disfigures everything he sees—he impoverishes its worth: he is detrimental&hellip;.</p>
<p>No mistake seems possible in this matter: and yet history discloses the terrible fact, that the exhausted have always been <em>confounded</em> with those with the most abundant resources, and the latter with the most detrimental.</p>
<p>The pauper in vitality, the feeble one, impoverishes even life: the wealthy man, in vital powers, enriches it. The first is the parasite of the second: the second is a bestower of his abundance. How is confusion possible?</p>
<p>When he who was exhausted came forth with the bearing of a very active and energetic man (when degeneration implied a certain excess of spiritual and nervous discharge), he was <em>mistaken</em> for the wealthy man. He inspired terror. The cult of the madman is also always the cult of him who is rich in vitality, and who is a powerful man. The fanatic, the one possessed, the religious epileptic, all eccentric creatures have been regarded as the highest types of power: as divine.</p>
<p>This kind of strength which inspires terror seemed to be, above all, divine: this was the starting-point of authority; here <em>wisdom</em> was interpreted, hearkened to, and sought. Out of this there was developed, everywhere almost, a <em>will</em> to &ldquo;deify,&rdquo; <em>i.e.,</em> to a typical degeneration of spirit, body, and nerves: an attempt to discover the road to this higher form of being. To make oneself ill or mad, to provoke the symptoms of serious disorder—was called getting stronger, becoming more superhuman, more terrible and more wise. People thought they would thus attain to such wealth of power, that they would be able to <em>dispense</em> it. Wheresoever there have been prayers, some one has been sought who had something to give away.</p>
<p>What led astray, here, was the experience of intoxication. This increases the feeling of power to the highest degree, therefore, to the mind of the ingenuous, it is <em>power.</em> On the highest altar of power <em>the most intoxicated man</em> must stand, the ecstatic. (There are two causes of <em>intoxication</em>: superabundant life, and a condition of morbid nutrition of the brain.)</p>
<ol start="49">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Acquired,</em> not inherited exhaustion: (1) inadequate <em>nourishment,</em> often the result of ignorance concerning diet, as, for instance, in the case of scholars; (2) erotic precocity: the damnation more especially of the youth of France—Parisian youths, above all, who are already dirtied and ruined when they step out of their <em>lycées</em> into the world, and who cannot break the chains of despicable tendencies; ironical and scornful towards themselves—galley-slaves despite all their refinement (moreover, in the majority of cases, already a symptom of racial and family decadence, as all hypersensitiveness is; and examples of the infection of environment: to be influenced by one&rsquo;s environment is also a sign of decadence); (3) alcoholism, not the instinct but the habit, foolish imitation, the cowardly or vain adaptation to a ruling fashion. What a blessing a Jew is among Germans! See the obtuseness, the flaxen head, the blue eye, and the lack of intellect in the face, the language, and the bearing; the lazy habit of stretching the limbs, and the need of repose among Germans—a need which is not the result of overwork, but of the disgusting excitation and over-excitation caused by alcohol.</p>
<ol start="50">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>A theory of exhaustion.</em>—Vice, the insane (also artists), the criminals, the anarchists—these are not the <em>oppressed</em> classes, but <em>the outcasts</em> of the community of all classes hitherto.</p>
<p>Seeing that all our classes are permeated by these elements, we have grasped the fact that <em>modern society</em> is not a &ldquo;society&rdquo; or a &ldquo;body,&rdquo; but a diseased agglomeration of Chandala,—a society which no longer has the strength even to <em>excrete</em>.</p>
<p>To what extent living together for centuries has very much deepened <em>sickliness</em>:</p>
<p>modern virtuee}<br>
modern intellect} as forms of disease.<br>
modern science}</p>
<ol start="51">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The state of corruption.</em>—The interrelation of all forms of corruption should be understood, and the Christian form (Pascal as the type), as also the socialistic and communistic (a result of the Christian), should not be overlooked (from the standpoint of natural science, the <em>highest</em> conception of society according to socialists, is the lowest in the order of rank among societies); the &ldquo;Beyond&rdquo; —corruption: as though outside the real world of Becoming there were a world of Being.</p>
<p>Here there must be no compromise, but selection, annihilation, and war—the Christian Nihilistic standard of value must be withdrawn from all things and attacked beneath every disguise &hellip; for instance, from modern <em>sociology, music,</em> and <em>Pessimism</em> (all forms of the Christian ideal of values).</p>
<p>Either one thing <em>or</em> the other is true—that is to say, tending to elevate the type man&hellip;.</p>
<p>The priest, the shepherd of souls, should be looked upon as a form of life which must be suppressed. All education, hitherto, has been helpless, adrift, without ballast, and afflicted with the contradiction of values.</p>

</ol>
<p>If Nature have no pity on the degenerate, it is not therefore immoral: the growth of physiological and moral evils in the human race, is rather the <em>result</em> of <em>morbid and unnatural morality.</em> The sensitiveness of the majority of men is both morbid and unnatural.</p>
<p>Why is it that mankind is corrupt in a moral and physiological respect? The body degenerates if one organ is <em>unsound.</em> The <em>right of altruism</em> cannot be traced to physiology, neither can the right to help and to the equality of fate: these are all premiums for degenerates and failures.</p>
<p>There can be no <em>solidarity</em> in a society containing unfruitful, unproductive, and destructive members, who, by the bye, are bound to have offspring even more degenerate than they are themselves.</p>
<ol start="53">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Decadence exercises a profound and perfectly unconscious influence, even over the ideals of science: all our sociology is a proof of this proposition, and it has yet to be reproached with the fact that it has only the experience of <em>society in the process of decay,</em> and inevitably takes its own decaying instincts as the basis of sociological judgment.</p>
<p>The <em>declining</em> vitality of modern Europe formulates its social ideals in its decaying instincts: and these ideals are all so like those of <em>old and effete</em> races, that they might be mistaken for one another.</p>
<p>The <em>gregarious instinct,</em> then,—now a sovereign power,—is something totally different from the instinct of an <em>aristocratic society</em>: and the value of the sum depends upon the value of the units constituting it&hellip;. The whole of our sociology knows no other instinct than that of the herd, <em>i.e.,</em> of a <em>multitude of mere ciphers</em>—of which every cipher has &ldquo;equal rights,&rdquo; and where it is a virtue to be——naught&hellip;.</p>
<p>The valuation with which the various forms of society are judged to-day is absolutely the same with that which assigns a higher place to peace than to war: but this principle is contrary to the teaching of biology, and is itself a mere outcome of decadent life. Life is a result of war, society is a means to war&hellip;. Mr. Herbert Spencer was a decadent in biology, as also in morality (he regarded the triumph of altruism as a desideratum!!!).</p>

<p>After thousands of years of error and confusion, it is my good fortune to have rediscovered the road which leads to a Yea and to a Nay.</p>
<p>I teach people to say Nay in the face of all that makes for weakness and exhaustion.</p>
<p>I teach people to say Yea in the face of all that makes for strength, that preserves strength, and justifies the feeling of strength.</p>
<p>Up to the present, neither the one nor the other has been taught; but rather virtue, disinterestedness, pity, and even the negation of life. All these are values proceeding from exhausted people.</p>
<p>After having pondered over the physiology of exhaustion for some time, I was led to the question: to what extent the judgments of exhausted people had percolated into the world of values.</p>
<p>The result at which I arrived was as startling as it could possibly be—even for one like myself who was already at home in many a strange world: I found that all prevailing values—that is to say, all those which had gained ascendancy over humanity, or at least over its tamer portions, could be traced back to the judgment of exhausted people.</p>
<p>Under the cover of the holiest names, I found the most destructive tendencies; people had actually given the name &ldquo;God&rdquo; to all that renders weak, teaches weakness, and infects with weakness&hellip;. I found that the &ldquo;good man&rdquo; was a form of self-affirmation on the part of decadence.</p>
<p>That virtue which Schopenhauer still proclaimed as superior to all, and as the most fundamental of all virtues; even that same pity I recognised as more dangerous than any vice. Deliberately to thwart the law of selection among species, and their natural means of purging their stock of degenerate members—this, up to my time, had been the greatest of all virtues&hellip;.</p>
<p>One should do honour to the <em>fatality</em> which says to the feeble: &ldquo;perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opposing of this fatality, the botching of mankind and the allowing of it to putrefy, was given the name &ldquo;God&rdquo; One shall not take the name of the Lord one&rsquo;s God in vain&hellip;.</p>
<p>The race is corrupted—not by its vices, but by its ignorance: it is corrupted because it has not recognised exhaustion as exhaustion: physiological misunderstandings are the cause of all evil.</p>
<p>Virtue is our greatest misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Problem: how were the exhausted able to make the laws of values? In other words, how did they who are the last, come to power?&hellip; How did the instincts of the animal man ever get to stand on their heads?&hellip;</p>

<p>The Crisis: Nihilism and the Idea of Recurrence.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Extreme positions are not relieved by more moderate ones, but by extreme <em>opposite</em> positions. And thus the belief in the utter immorality of nature, and in the absence of all purpose and sense, are psychologically necessary attitudes when the belief in God and in an essentially moral order of things is no longer tenable.</p>
<p>Nihilism now appears, <em>not</em> because the sorrows of existence are greater than they were formerly, but because, in a general way, people have grown suspicious of the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; which might be given to evil and even to existence. One interpretation has been overthrown: but since it was held to be <em>the</em> interpretation, it seems as though there were no meaning in existence at all, as though everything were in vain.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It yet remains to be shown that this &ldquo;in vain!&rdquo; is the character of present Nihilism. The mistrust of our former valuations has increased to such an extent that it has led to the question: &ldquo;are not all &lsquo;values&rsquo; merely allurements prolonging the duration of the comedy, without, however, bringing the unravelling any closer?&rdquo; The &ldquo;long period of time&rdquo; which has culminated in an &ldquo;in vain,&rdquo; without either goal or purpose, is the <em>most paralysing</em> of thoughts, more particularly when one sees that one is duped without, however, being able to resist being duped.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Let us imagine this thought in its worst form: existence, as it is, without either a purpose or a goal, but inevitably recurring, without an end in nonentity: &ldquo;<em>Eternal Recurrence.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the extremest form of Nihilism: nothing (purposelessness) eternal!</p>
<p>European form of Buddhism: the energy of knowledge and of strength drives us to such a belief. It is the most <em>scientific</em> of all hypotheses. We deny final purposes. If existence had a final purpose it would have reached it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It should be understood that what is being aimed at, here, is a contradiction of Pantheism: for &ldquo;everything perfect, divine, eternal,&rdquo; <em>also</em> leads <em>to the belief in Eternal Recurrence.</em> Question: has this pantheistic and affirmative attitude to all things also been made possible by morality? At bottom only the moral God has been overcome. Is there any sense in imagining a God &ldquo;beyond good and evil&rdquo;? Would Pantheism in <em>this</em> sense be possible? Do we withdraw the idea of purpose from the process, and affirm the process notwithstanding? This were so if, within that process, something were <em>attained</em> every moment—and always the same thing. Spinoza won an affirmative position of this sort, in the sense that every moment, according to him, has a logical necessity: and he triumphed by means of his fundamentally logical instinct over a like conformation of the world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>But his case is exceptional. If every <em>fundamental trait of character,</em> which lies beneath every act, and which finds expression in every act, were recognised by the individual as <em>his</em> fundamental trait of character, this individual would be driven to regard every moment of his existence in general, triumphantly as good. It would simply be necessary for that fundamental trait of character to be felt in oneself as something good, valuable, and pleasurable.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Now, in the case of those men and classes of men who were treated with violence and oppressed by their fellows, <em>morality</em> saved life from despair and from the leap into nonentity:. for impotence in relation to mankind and <em>not</em> in relation to Nature is what generates the most desperate bitterness towards existence. Morality treated the powerful, the violent, and the &ldquo;masters&rdquo; in general, as enemies against whom the common man must be protected—<em>that is to say, emboldened, strengthened.</em> Morality has therefore always taught the most profound <em>hatred</em> and <em>contempt</em> of the fundamental trait of character of all rulers—<em>i.e., their Will to Power.</em> To suppress, to deny, and to decompose this morality, would mean to regard this most thoroughly detested instinct with the reverse of the old feeling and valuation. If the sufferer and the oppressed man were <em>to lose his belief</em> in his right to contemn the Will to Power, his position would be desperate. This would be so if the trait above-mentioned were essential to life, in which case it would follow that even that will to morality was only a cloak to this &ldquo;Will to Power,&rdquo; as are also even that hatred and contempt. The oppressed man would then perceive that he stands <em>on the same platform</em> with the oppressor, and that he has no individual privilege, nor any <em>higher rank</em> than the latter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the <em>contrary</em>! There is nothing on earth which can have any value, if it have not a modicum of power—granted, of course, that life itself is the Will to Power. Morality protected the <em>botched</em> and <em>bungled</em> against Nihilism, in that it gave every one of them infinite worth, metaphysical worth, and classed them altogether in one order which did not correspond with that of worldly power and order of rank: it taught submission, humility, etc. <em>Admitting that the belief in this morality be destroyed,</em> the botched and the bungled would no longer have any comfort, and would perish.</p>
<p>This <em>perishing</em> seems like <em>self-annihilation,</em> like an instinctive selection of that which must be destroyed. The <em>symptoms</em> of this self-destruction of the botched and the bungled: self-vivisection, poisoning, intoxication, romanticism, and, above all, the instinctive constraint to acts whereby the powerful are made into <em>mortal enemies</em> (training, so to speak, one&rsquo;s own hangmen), <em>the will to destruction</em> as the will of a still deeper instinct—of the instinct of self-destruction, of the Will to Nonentity.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Nihilism is a sign that the botched and bungled in order to be destroyed, that, having been deprived of morality, they no longer have any reason to &ldquo;resign themselves,&rdquo; that they take up their stand on the territory of the opposite principle, and <em>will also exercise power</em> themselves, by compelling the powerful to become their hangmen. This is the European form of Buddhism, that <em>active negation,</em> after all existence has lost its meaning.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; has grown more acute, on the contrary! &ldquo;God, morality, resignation&rdquo; were remedies in the very deepest stages of misery: <em>active</em> Nihilism made its appearance in circumstances which were relatively much more favourable. The fact, alone, that morality is regarded as overcome, presupposes a certain degree of intellectual culture; while this very culture, for its part, bears evidence to a certain relative well-being. A certain intellectual fatigue, brought on by the long struggle concerning philosophical opinions, and carried to hopeless scepticism <em>against</em> philosophy, shows moreover that the level of these Nihilists is by no means a low one. Only think of the conditions in which Buddha appeared! The teaching of the eternal recurrence would have learned principles to go upon (just as Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, for instance, had the notion of causality, etc.).</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What do we mean to-day by the words &ldquo;botched and bungled&rdquo;? In the first place, they are used <em>physiologically</em> and not politically. The unhealthiest kind of man all over Europe (in all classes) is the soil out of which Nihilism grows: this species of man will regard eternal recurrence as damnation—once he is bitten by the thought, he can no longer recoil before any action. He would not extirpate passively, but would cause everything to be extirpated which is meaningless and without a goal to this extent; although it is only a spasm, or sort of blind rage in the presence of the fact that everything has existed again and again for an eternity—even this period of Nihilism and destruction. The value of such a <em>crisis</em> is that it <em>purifies,</em> that it unites similar elements, and makes them mutually destructive, that it assigns common duties to men of opposite persuasions, and brings the weaker and more uncertain among them to the light, thus taking the first step towards a new <em>order of rank</em> among forces from the standpoint of health: recognising commanders as commanders, subordinates as subordinates. Naturally irrespective of all the present forms of society.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What class of men will prove they are strongest in this new order of things? The most moderate—they who do not <em>require</em> any extreme forms of belief, they who not only admit of, but actually like, a certain modicum of chance and nonsense; they who can think of man with a very moderate view of his value, without becoming weak and small on that account; the most rich in health, who are able to withstand a maximum amount of sorrow, and who are therefore not so very much afraid of sorrow—men who are <em>certain of their power,</em> and who represent with conscious pride the state of strength to which man has attained.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How could such a man think of Eternal Recurrence?</p>

<p><em>The Periods of European Nihilism.</em></p>
<p><em>The Period of Obscurity</em>: all kinds of groping measures devised to preserve old institutions and not to arrest the progress of new ones.</p>
