The great Proclus was a nodal figure unifying knowledge across mathematics, science and the framework of heathen thought. Below is a snippet of his thought from his "mAhA-bhAShyA" on Euclid -- he was like pata~njali to pANini to Euclid:

> [Mathematics] makes contributions of the greatest value to physical science. It reveals the good order of the ratios according to which the Universe is constructed &c: It exhibits the simple and primal causal elements being continuous in every way according to symmetry and equality, through which all heaven was perfected, when it took upon itself the figures appropriate to its particular region. 

Johannes Kepler opened his great work on the laws on planetary motion by citing this.
