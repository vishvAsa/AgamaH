*—Pseudo-Julian*

What was it about Iamblichus that attracted the respect and veneration of Platonic thinkers from the fourth century to the Renaissance? Why did the emperor Julian regard Iamblichus as the equal to Plato? And why did a student describe Iamblichus as the “great glory,” “universal blessing,” and

“savior”1 of the Hellenic world? The slavish cheerleading of an enthusiast? Why then did later Platonists like Proclus and Damascius give Iamblichus’s teachings more authority than even the teachings of Plotinus? Was Iamblichus’s influence due simply to the

“loss of nerve” among late antique intellectuals—as many would have us believe—or did he, perhaps, outline a compelling and comprehensive vision of a world that we no longer understand?

In light of the pressures confronting Platonists in the fourth century, Iamblichus’s unknown student may have been correct to see his teacher as the *soter* of the Hellenic world. Under the leadership of Plotinus and Porphyry, the influence of Platonism had receded to an intellectual elite that was becoming increasingly alienated from the common man. Following the social and economic changes of the third and fourth centuries, the loyalties of the latter were being drawn away from the traditional cults of old Hellenism, and increasing numbers of people were adopting new identities as participants in the *musteria* of Christ. This was certainly true in the Antioch of Iamblichus’s time, and although pagan philosophers were still respected, their authority was gradually being transferred 1.

to Christian bishops who offered salvation to all regardless of their social or intellectual class.2

It would be tempting, but incorrect, to see Iamblichus’s soteriological praxis as a reaction to this state of affairs, as his attempt to accommodate Platonism to the changing times. It is tempting because Iamblichus’s theurgic reinterpretation of Platonism fulfilled the requirements of popular religion while preserving the esoteric disciplines of a privileged few. The former aspect has usually drawn attention, but it is the latter that is of greater importance. In one sense theurgy was the logical correlate to the law of arithmogonic procession; namely, that the higher and more unified a principle, the more extensive or more piercing \( *drimutera*\)3 its effects.

Because theurgy provided a more direct and simplified participation in the One, it had a wider circle of application and was as available to the common man as to the intellectual. Rather than falling outside the circumference of Platonism—as many have suggested—

theurgy penetrated to a deeper center, one that extended the boundaries of the Platonic world. To say that Iamblichus *preserved* the esoteric disciplines of the Platonic school, however, is not quite correct, for in his estimation those disciplines had already been lost or distorted by his predecessors.

Iamblichus broke away from the teachings of Porphyry and Plotinus in order to reestablish—in theurgical Platonism—what he believed to be the true teachings of Plato and Pythagoras. Iamblichus thought that he had inherited a kind of gnosticized Platonism from Porphyry, with its attendant consequences: \(1\) a cosmological dualism with matter viewed as evil; \(2\) the human soul equated with the World Soul and the *Nous*; and \(3\) a desacralized and demonic cosmos from which the soul, in Porphyry’s view, should seek its permanent escape. The impact of these views on popular audiences may or may not have been significant, but it was far more important to Iamblichus that they were mistaken and therefore incapable of leading souls to a genuine transformation and apotheosis.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

In a manner that was traditionally Platonic, Iamblichus turned to the “Egyptians” and the “Chaldeans”—that is, to barbarian wise-men—for the authority to change the direction of his philosophical tradition. The degree to which theurgy reflects genuine Egyptian cult practices may be significant,4 but it is not the central issue. At issue is Iamblichus’s belief in a sacred tradition. Only a tradition received from the gods could play the role of authoritative “other” to the fallen soul and fallen society. Deference to Egyptian wisdom in this sense was already a topos in the Platonic dialogues where “Egypt” functioned as an ideal culture against which Plato measured his own.5

The role of Plato *redivivus*, as seen in the Chaldean Oracles, cannot be underestimated either as an important influence on Iamblichus’s development of theurgic Platonism. As divine *logia*, the Oracles also functioned as an authoritative “other” capable of saving the soul.

The influence of Pythagorean thought on Iamblichus was perhaps most critical, as it provided him with the conceptual framework and the theoretic justification for the practice of theurgy.

Although Iamblichus was an advocate of conserving traditional pagan religions, he discovered in Pythagoreanism a revolutionary method to identify himself with the “old ways.” Using Pythagorean cosmological principles as his standard, Iamblichus discovered theurgical dimensions in a variety of religious practices. While each cultural embodiment of the gods was unique in its myths and rituals—and therefore untranslatable by man—each possessed a common theurgic power. As a theurgist, and one who had coordinated himself with the numbers of creation, Iamblichus had the ability to become unified with the gods in a variety of cultural guises. The cult simply had to meet his Pythagorean standards, one being that the soul’s apotheosis was the result of its homologization to the *arithmoi* of the World Soul. These unchanging mathematical proportions were the constants in the shifting valencies of Iamblichean theurgy. Plato too had spoken of a “great power of geometric equal-4. See for example Derchain’s essay, “Pseudo-Jamblique ou Abammon?” *Chronique d’Egypt* 76 \(1973\): 220–26.

*Conclusion*

ity amongst gods and men” \( *Gorgias* 508bc\) and for Iamblichus the *arithmoi*, in their theological, mathematical, or material expression were the invisible foundation of every theurgy.

The most distinctive cosmological feature in theurgy was the central position given to the sun. For Iamblichus, Helios played the key role in the apotheosis of the soul: first awakening it through the senses and then leading it noetically to the eternal *arithmoi*. As Plato says in the *Timaeus*: “God lit a fire which we now call the sun . . .

that it might give light to the whole of heaven, and that animals, as many as nature intended, might participate in *number*” \( *Tim*. 38bc\).

And as choreographer of the heavens, the sun led souls into their mathematical bodies. The *Epinomis* says: “But this is the greatest boon of all, if a man will accept his *gift of number* and let his mind wander freely over the whole heavenly circuit” \(977b\).

Like Plato, Iamblichus attempted to uphold the “old ways” of traditional religions by reinterpreting them according to a cosmological and arithmetic schema. Yet, even more than Plato, Iamblichus preserved these schemas in their own cultural expressions, believing that the power of these rites could never be explained intellectually; they had to be enacted and embodied. In this, particularly, Iamblichus differed from his Platonic predecessors, especially where it concerned the capacity of the human intellect.

The role of the intellect in the soul’s salvation was a recurring motif within the *De Mysteriis*. While Plotinus allowed that each soul already contained the *Nous* but was “unconscious” of it, Iamblichus made the unconscious presence of the *Nous* and the One radically distinct, ontologically other, and therefore inaccessible despite all efforts of the soul. To reach the superior hypostases the soul needed the aid of superior entities and these were received from without \( *exothen*\).

One consequence of Iamblichus’s embodied psychology was that to reach the gods *all* the energies engaged in the soul’s descent had to be ritually reengaged and transformed into theurgic receptacles: a world ritualized into the *energeiai* of the gods. In one sense, the differences between Plotinus and Iamblichus might seem insignificant since the Iamblichean gods \(like Plotinus’s undescended soul\) were always present and available to any soul able to receive them.

269

*Theurgy and the Soul*

However, because the Iamblichean soul was anatropic it was unable to receive this aid, which is why the Egyptian/Chaldean element becomes important. For Iamblichus, the only way the soul could receive the gods was by preparing the proper receptacles, the knowledge of which was preserved by the priests of sacred races like the Egyptians and Chaldeans. According to Iamblichus, their mystagogy was a reflection of cosmogony, and their receptacles of the gods recapitulated the act of creation. Apotheosis was realized only through the soul’s mimesis of cosmogony, and therefore an “escape”

from the cosmos apart from a more causal and responsible involvement in it not only was undesirable, it was impossible. Such a notion could arise only from an exaggerated sense of personal importance, and an escape of this kind did not result in freedom but in bondage to an anatropic fantasy.

Iamblichus argued that theurgy provided everyone, regardless of intellectual training, a way of returning to the gods by preparing their receptacles, however crude or subtle these needed to be. A soteriological cult of this kind might easily degenerate into a form of fetish worship if the ritual receptacles \(the *sunthemata*\) became objects of veneration in themselves. This may account for Iamblichus’s harsh condemnation of the “image makers” who attend to the dregs of matter rather than to divine causes \( *DM* 171, 5–18\). Iamblichus reserved some of his most severe criticism for these men, no doubt because the integrity of theurgy was vulnerable to the degenerative worship they encouraged. Conversely, a sterile intellectuality that abstracts itself from nature was the weakness to which Plotinus’s model was vulnerable, and Iamblichus criticizes this attitude throughout the *De Mysteriis* as a form of intellectual hubris.

At the conclusion of the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus sums up the goals of Egyptian theurgy, claiming that “theurgists do not address the divine *Nous* over trifling matters but only concerning things that pertain to the purification, liberation, and salvation of the soul” \( *DM*

293, 5–8\). From the theurgies performed by “material” souls with heavier *sunthemata* to those performed by “noetic” souls in the more subtle vehicles of mathematic images, the purpose of every theurgic ritual was the purification \( *katharsis*\), liberation \( *apolusis*\), and salvation \( *soteria*\) of the soul. Iamblichus’s complaint to Porphyry is as 270

*Conclusion*

relevant today as it was when Iamblichus wrote his apology for theurgy. He says: “One should not introduce mistakes when making a true judgment of reality, for in the case of other sciences or arts we do not judge their works based on distortions that occur in them”

\( *DM* 92, 4–7\). I believe that Iamblichean theurgy and the ritual practices of the later Neoplatonists have suffered from just this kind of misunderstanding. Because theurgy has erroneously been portrayed as an attempt to manipulate the gods it has been dismissed as a debased and superstitious form of Platonism. It was nothing of the kind. Rather, Iamblichus’s prestige in his own and subsequent eras was due to his success in creating—like his fictional Pythagoras—a synthesis of worship and divine philosophy. In theurgy the highest thought of Platonic philosophy was fully integrated with common religious practices, and the immaterial gods were connected to the lowest sublunary daimons: in sum, heaven was joined to earth through the common mathematical structures of Pythagorean science. The Pythagorean solutions that mediated the One and the Many were translated by Iamblichus to the tensions pulling at the fourth century; the result was a comprehensive vision of a cosmos connected everywhere by numbers and accessible to anyone who ritually embodied them. This theurgical vision shaped the thinking of later Platonists such as Syrianus, Proclus, and Damascius, and its influence also extended beyond Platonic circles and may well be reflected in the sacramental theology of Christian thinkers. Indeed, the Church, with its ecclesiastical embodiment of the divine hierarchy, its initiations, and its belief in salvation through sacramental acts, may have fulfilled the theurgical program of Iamblichus in a manner that was never concretely realized by Platonists. In a sense that has yet to be examined, the Church may well have become the reliquary of the hieratic vision and practices of the later Platonists.6

See James Miller, *Measures of Wisdom: The Cosmic Dance in Classical Antiquity* \(Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1986\) for an excellent description of theurgical principles enacted in the liturgy of the sixth-century Orthodox church \(pp.515–17\). One important difference between Platonic and Christian \(pseudo-Dionysian\) theurgy, however, is that for Christians their *ekklesia* replaces the physical cosmos of the Platonists; it is a theurgy in some sense opposed to the cosmos, an idea entirely at odds with Iamblichean theurgy.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

Even if theurgy were limited to Platonic circles, its significance would call for a more careful examination than it has received. It is my hope that this study has made some contribution to that end.
