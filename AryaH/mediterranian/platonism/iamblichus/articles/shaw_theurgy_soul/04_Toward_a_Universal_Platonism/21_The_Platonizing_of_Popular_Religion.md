*There are two kinds of madness, *

*one resulting from human illness, *

*the other from a divine disruption*

*of our codes of conduct. *

*—Phaedrus *\( *265a*\)

ivination \( *mantike*\) in the late antique world was the art of bird watchers, gut-gazers, dream interpreters, trance medi-Dums, and others to predict the future and determine the will of the gods. Divinational practices were an integral part of the Greco-Roman world and provided Iamblichus with striking, yet universally recognized evidence that divine powers exist beyond the human soul. In the *De Mysteriis* the phenomena of *mantike* became the *exempla* of theurgy, furnishing Iamblichus’s hieratic Platonism with a familiarity that it did not yet possess. At the same time, by arguing for the philosophical legitimacy of divinational rites—

under the rubric of theurgy—Iamblichus provided a theoretical justification for well-known religious practices of the Greco-Roman world.

Iamblichus’s interpretation of *mantike* was perfectly orthodox for a Platonist, since Plato himself had already pointed to a connection between divine madness \( *theia mania*\) and divination \( *mantike*; *Phaedrus* 244a–c\). For Plato, “man’s greatest blessings come by way of madness, indeed of madness that is heaven-sent” \( *Phaedrus* 244a, 6–8\), and Iamblichus maintained that since divination came from the gods it was “divine work,” hence, *theourgia*. The theurgical interpretation of divination, therefore, represents Iamblichus’s attempt to flesh out the suggestions about divine madness \( *theia* 259

*Theurgy and the Soul*

*mania*\) in the *Phaedrus*. For Platonists, the dramatic change of consciousness seen in trance diviners and rhapsodists would have vividly exemplified the kind of transformation sought for in the soul.

Plotinus, for example, referred to the phenomenon of the *mantis* to describe the soul’s contact with the One:

But just as those who have a god within them \( *enthousiontes*\) and are in the grip of divine possession may know this much, that they have something greater in them, even if they do not know what; and from the ways in which they are moved, and the things they say, get a certain awareness of the god who moves them, though these are not the same as the mover; so we seem to be disposed towards the One.1

However, what served Plotinus as an evocative comparison and Plato as a suggestive etymology became, for Iamblichus, the principal example of his theurgical program. One cannot fail to recognize the influence of the *Phaedrus* on the *De Mysteriis*, particularly Plato’s statement that *mania*, like theurgy, comes from the gods and reasoning from men \( *Phaedrus* 244d, 3–5\). Cast against the background of this dialogue, Porphyry becomes the “merely clever” man of the *Phaedrus* while Iamblichus/Abammon assumes the role of the

“wise” spokesman for theurgy, the *theia mania* of the fourth century \( *Phaedrus* 245c, 1–2\).

According to Iamblichus, whenever a soul was touched by the gods it entered the condition of a *mantis*, and just as a traditional *mantis* exchanged ordinary consciousness for a divine possession, so Iamblichus believed that each transformation of the soul was a theurgic exchange, a *theia* *mantike*. In effect, Iamblichus generalized the specific phenomenon of the *mantis* or the *enthousiastes* to describe theurgic transformations and he required in turn that the traditional oracles at Delphi, Colophon, and Branchidae fit his interpretive criteria for theurgy \(see *DM* 123, 11–127, 11\).

True divination, according to Iamblichus, was equivalent to divinization, making the soul divine, and knowledge of the future 1. Plotinus, *Enn*. V, 3, 14, 9–14, trans. A.H. Armstrong \(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1966–68\).

*The Platonizing of Popular Religion* was merely a secondary consequence of ascending to the *arche* of temporal events. Iamblichus argued that theurgical divination should be carefully distinguished from inductive techniques aimed at making predictions or diagnosing illnesses,2 and he also distinguished it from the natural prescience of animals to predict earth-quakes or rain. Such presentiments arose from a sympathy with natural elements or from acute sense perception, but they were fallible and did not have the same function as divine *mantike* \( *DM* 162, 16–163, 11\). Iamblichus admitted that human souls, like animals, receive impressions of coming events—what today would be called ESP—but he maintained that this was divination of a second order and fell short of divine stability and truth. Most significant, it did not transform the soul. “This intuitive faculty,” Iamblichus says, “has nothing in it that is truly blessed” \( *DM* 288, 18–19\). As a consequence of having appropriated the phenomenon of *mantike* into his theurgical program, any aspect of popular divination that did not meet Iamblichus’s criteria for theurgy was not considered true divination.

According to Iamblichus, the function of divination was the deification of the soul:

Divine *mantike* alone *unites us with the Gods*, for it genuinely gives us a share of the divine life, has a share in prognosis and divine intuitions, and *makes us truly divine*. It truly bestows the Good on us, because the most blessed intuition of the Gods is filled with all the good things. \( *DM* 289, 3–8\)

The divinatory elements and techniques might be modified according to the needs of the time and the soul, but the divine function of *mantike* remained constant:

There is one correct definition and principle for all forms of divination and it has nothing to do with irresponsibly divining the future with things that lack foreknowledge. Rather, it is to view from \[the perspective\] of the Gods—who contain in themselves the limits of the entire knowledge of reality—the divination allotted throughout the whole world and all the lives defined in it. This 2. *DM* 288, 9–11; 163, 11–13. Iamblichus, again, follows Plato; cf. *Phaedrus* 244cd; *Republic* 516d.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

cause is primordial and eminently universal, possessing in a primary way \( *protos*\) what it bestows to its participants. Certainly, it possesses the truth necessary for divination and anticipates the essence and cause of events from which it necessarily and accurately yields foreknowledge. Let us take this kind of principle universally as the cause for all divination and from which we may scientifically discover all its species. \( *DM* 101, 15–102, 11\) The foreknowledge \( *prognosis*\) given in divination was not knowledge of particular events. It was, rather, an immediate knowing, “possessing in a primary way \( *protos*\)” things that happen seri-ally in time. Like the *noesis* of the gods, this primary knowing was unreflective and therefore was not “knowledge” in a discursive sense.3 It lifted the soul from particular knowing to the level of the gods where all events, past and future, were simultaneously contained. Theurgic prognosis was literally a *pro* \+ *gnosis*, an ascent to the *arche* of knowing and thus, to that which *precedes* knowing. Yet, as the *arche* of knowledge, prognosis contained all its species, so the information received in divination, although accurate, was merely incidental to the soul’s ascent to the *arche*. Knowledge of the future was not an essential characteristic of theurgic *mantike*. Iamblichus says: “Whenever it is necessary for the soul to exercise virtue, and ignorance of the future contributes to this, *the Gods conceal the* *things that will happen* in order to make the soul better” \( *DM* 289, 17–290, 1\). Divine *mantike* did not serve human desires; it existed solely “for the sake of the salvation and ascent of souls” \( *DM* 290, 2–

3\). Nor was *mantike* an “artifice or invention useful for the conduct of life” \( *DM* 100, 5–6\). “It is not a human work at all,” Iamblichus says, “but divine and supernatural and sent down to us from heaven” \( *DM* 100, 6–8\).

The differences between Porphyry and Iamblichus are most clearly defined on the topic of divination, for both used the phenomenon to distinguish their forms of Platonism. Porphyry defined the piety of the philosopher by contrasting it with the false wisdom 3. For “knowledge is separated \[from its object\] by otherness. But *prior to the* *act of knowing* another as being itself ‘other’ there exists a spontaneous . . . uniform conjunction suspended from the Gods” \( *DM* 8, 4–6\).

*The Platonizing of Popular Religion* of the diviner. He says: “The philosopher . . . is detached from exterior things . . . and has no need of diviners or the entrails of animals. *For the goods about which divinations are concerned are the* *very things from which the philosopher strives to detach himself*.”4 In his letter to Anebo, Porphyry maintained that the dramatic effects observed in divination were not indicative of the soul’s exaltation but of diseases caused by “black bile, drunkenness or the fury of mad dogs” \( *DM* 158, 7–10\). Porphyry said that the *ekstasis* that threw the soul out of discursive awareness was a degenerative phenomenon and that the “not-knowing” condition of the *mantis* indicated a privation of knowledge, not an ascent to its principle. The issue is significant, for if theurgy translated the soul to an ineffable possession, what would distinguish this from a derangement and loss of intelligence? Indeed, this issue continues to lie at the heart of current debates over the value of theurgy in the history of Platonism. Iamblichus recognized its importance and responded by distinguishing two kinds of ecstasy:5

From the beginning, it is necessary to divide ecstasy into two species: one is turned toward the inferior \[and the other reaches up to the superior\];6 one is filled with foolishness and delirium, but the other imparts goods more honorable than human wisdom. One degenerates to a disorderly, confused and material movement, but the other gives itself to the cause that rules over the very order of the cosmos. The former deviates from understanding because it is deprived of knowledge, but the latter because it is attached to beings that transcend all human understanding. The former is unstable, the latter unchangeable; the first is counter to nature \( *para phusin*\), the latter is beyond nature \( *huper phusin*\); the former makes the soul descend, the latter raises it up; and while 4. *De Abst*. II, 52, 2–4; in *Porphyre: De l’abstinence*, text, translation, and introduction by Jean Bouffartique and Michel Patillon \(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1977\).

5. The distinctions that follow elaborate upon the distinction already made by Plato in the *Phaedrus*. “There are two kinds of madness,” Socrates says, “one resulting from human illness, the other from a divine disruption of our codes of conduct” \( *Phaedrus* 265a, 9–11\).

6. I follow the conjecture of Westerink for the lacuna that precedes *kai* \( *DM* 158, 12\). See the apparatus of des Places’s text and translation of *Jamblique: Les mystères* *d’Egypte* \(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1966\), 133.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

the former entirely separates the soul from participation in the divine, the latter connects the soul with the divine. \( *DM* 158, 10–

159, 6\)

These contrasts are crucial for understanding Iamblichus’s defense of theurgy and they represent his clearest refutation of the implications of sorcery raised by Porphyry and those of “irrationalism”

brought by modern scholars. To an untutored observer a deranged ecstasy *para phusin* might appear the same as a divine ecstasy *huper* *phusin*, but they were fundamentally opposed, and the *De Mysteriis* represents Iamblichus’s attempt to clarify this opposition. In a subsequent passage he makes the same kind of distinction with respect to *phantasia*, contrasting the imagination stirred up by diseases with divine imaginations \( *theiai phantasiai*; *DM* 160, 9–11\) sent by the gods. Iamblichus’s criterion for determining whether the ecstasy was divine or deranged was whether or not it had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the soul.

It is significant that Plotinus used the term *ekstasis* only once in a positive sense and even then, Armstrong says, the manuscript may be in error.7 *Ekstasis*, the “standing outside oneself,” would not have played a part in the spiritual discipline of one whose soul was already equivalent to the *Nous*. For Plotinus and Porphyry, *ekstasis* could only be a degenerative act, falling out of one’s true self, which was equivalent to falling away from the divine *Nous* itself.8 Hence, Porphyry saw mantic phenomenon as a derangement and loss of the “sacred sobriety of the gods” \( *DM* 160, 7\). In contrast, because of his embodied psychology, Iamblichus believed that “standing outside oneself ” was altogether necessary for the salvation of the soul. The human “sobriety” extolled by Porphyry was simply not enough; Iamblichus tells him: “You should in no way regard human sobriety as comparable to divine sobriety” \( *DM* 160, 6–8\). Theurgic *ekstasis* was Iamblichus’s answer to Plato’s *theia mania*, and he saw the doctrine of the complete descent of the soul as its correlate.

264

*The Platonizing of Popular Religion* Because of the soul’s hypostatic disjuncture from the gods, *ekstasis* was a sine qua non for apotheosis. The gods came to the soul from without, *exothen*, and to attain a divine life the soul had to undergo an ecstatic transformation and “exchange.” Every theurgist had to become a *mantis*.
