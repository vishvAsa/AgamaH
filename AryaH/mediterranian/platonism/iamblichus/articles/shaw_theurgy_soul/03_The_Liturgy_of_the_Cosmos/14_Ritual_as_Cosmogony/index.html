  <p>The omission, even of few things,
subverts the entire effect of</p>
<p>worship.</p>
<p>To divide theurgists into three groups corresponding to three levels of the cosmos suggests a static structure, with each soul assigned a specific rank to worship a specific class of gods fixed in its rank. Although this schema is not inaccurate it overlooks the vitality of the structure, the dynamic character of theurgy as the unifying energeia of the gods. Cosmogonically theurgic action was philia, the demiurgic weaving of opposites (cf. In Nic. 73, 1–5), and it should be remembered that theurgic rites were performances that initiated human souls into the activity of the gods.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter I argued that every sacrifice had to meet two criteria of fitness ( prosekon): the sacrifice had to be connatural ( sungenes) both with the soul who offered it and with the god who received it. The sacrifice, therefore, served as a mean to awaken the philia between the god and the soul. The affinity of the theurgist with his offering and its connection to the god allowed him to enter the god’s energeia when the sacrifice was properly performed.</p>
<p>Through sacrifice the soul tapped the power of the ruling god whether the offering was an animal, a plant, a song, or a virtue, and these sacrifices were not extraneous to the will of the gods but direct expressions of their own activity. For Iamblichus, theurgy was fundamentally dynamic, for the philia that sustained both cosmos and sacrifice was seen, ultimately, as the eros of the One, proceeding from, and returning to, itself.</p>
<p>Theurgic sacrifice was also dynamic from the perspective of an individual soul; in its worship each soul gradually moved from material to immaterial gods. Following the Aristotelian principle 173</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>that the first in ontology was last in generation, the human soul proceeded to the intelligible gods by first accommodating itself to the material gods; only when the soul had integrated itself with material powers could its immaterial principles become active.1 The soul’s ascent to the noetic Father followed an unbroken continuum and any attempt to worship the Father directly and without intermediaries was bound to fail. Iamblichus explains that “for people not yet liberated from the fate of the material world and the communion tied up with bodies, unless a corresponding sort of worship is offered, they will utterly fail to attain immaterial or material blessings” ( DM 219, 18–220, 5). Although the immaterial gods contained ( perichein) the material gods and were the ultimate source of material blessings, their goods had to be mediated by the material gods and their daimons. Iamblichus says: “it must not be allowed for anyone to say that the immaterial Gods provide their gifts with their attention immediately bound up in the affairs of human life”</p>
<p>( DM 222, 9–13).</p>
<p>The worship of the material gods fulfilled the order of fate ( DM</p>
<p>223, 13–15), which allowed the soul to experience its laws as providential and liberating.2 Since the material gods were revealed by daimons, material rites necessarily worked with daimonic orders, and since these same daimons ruled over bodily instincts and passions, the rituals that established the proper measures for associating with them also stabilized the passions of the soul. Somatic life was ritually sewn into the cosmogonic philia, but to attain this affiliation the theurgist had to awaken all the powers in his soul through their correspondences in the cosmos. Iamblichus says: “The theurgists know ppp</p>
<ol>
<li>This progress through the orders of the gods is reflected in the psychological progress within the orders of the soul itself; just as the immaterial gods were present, but hidden, in the material gods, so the soul’s circle of the “same” was present in the circle(s) of the “other” but remained inactive until the soul balanced them ( Tim. 37ab). Cf. the soul’s relation to the two horses of the Phaedrus (247ab).</li>
</ol>
<p>For Iamblichus, this rectification was possible only by theurgy. See Dillon’s comments, Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 341–42.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>See Iamblichus’s identification of fate and providence in his letter to Macedonius; Stob. II, 173, 26–174, 27.</li>

<p>174</p>
<p>Ritual as Cosmogony</p>
<p>that the omission, even of insignificant things, subverts the entire effect of worship; just as in a musical scale, if one string is broken the whole scale becomes inharmonious and out of tune.”3</p>
<p>To deny any power its honor would deny to one’s soul the divinization of its corresponding element. Thus Iamblichus says: He who has not distributed to all [these powers] what is fitting and in accord with the appropriate honor that each is worthy to receive, will depart imperfect and deprived of participation in the Gods. But he who celebrates all these powers and offers to each gifts that are pleasing and honors that are as similar to them as possible, will always remain secure and infallible since he has properly completed, perfect and whole, the receptacle of the divine choir. ( DM 228, 19–229, 7)</p>
<p>The “receptacle of the divine choir” was the soul itself whose task it was to receive all the gifts of the gods ( DM 55–56). In Aristotelian terms, this reception transformed the soul from a cosmos in potentiality ( en dunamei) to a cosmos in actuality ( en energeia). Since the cosmos was collectively the energeiai of the gods, the human soul, in effect, assimilated itself to the gods by ritually enacting their energeiai; first, however, the soul had to co-ordinate its passions with material daimons. The affections that enslaved the soul to daimons had to be purified and aligned with sunthemata in nature before the soul could reach the simpler and more unified levels of the gods.</p>
<p>Without this collaboration with daimons the soul lacked the foundation necessary to homologize itself to the material gods.4</p>
<p>Noetic worship was useless without this foundation. Yet, in the view of Iamblichus, such premature noetic worship was being encouraged in Platonic schools, and Porphyry, his chief rival, was a 3. DM 230, 2–6. Repeating the same principle, Simplicius says: “Just as in the case of a word, if letters are left off or added on the form of the word is lost, so with divine works and words, if anything is left off, or added on, or mixed up, the divine illumination will not take place”; Simplicius, Commentarius in Enchiridion Epicteti, ed. L. Deubner (Paris, 1842), 94, 42–46.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Philo of Alexandria, faced with a similar challenge (i.e., to justify the traditional Jewish cult in the face of philosophic critique) argued that without the fulfillment of the material cult the soul would lack a foundation for spiritual initiations; see De Mig. Abr. 89; 92–93; 96.</li>
</ol>
<p>175</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>prime example of one who attempted to short-circuit the material gods and daimons. Although Porphyry had spoken of his henosis with the One, he was subject to severe bouts of depression, even to the point of suicide. Such emotions would suggest that Porphyry neglected to honor the god and daimons associated with his depression and thus failed to homologize himself to the material gods, gatekeepers of the immaterial gods and true union with the One.</p>
<p>From a theurgical perspective, Porphyry lacked a foundation, the security ( asphales) and infallibility ( aptaistos; DM 229, 5–6), that came from properly completing the “receptacle” of the divine choir.</p>
<p>From Iamblichus’s perspective Porphyry’s henosis had to have been false: if someone were still dominated by worldly passions (e.g., suicidal depression), he could not presume to pass beyond the material gods.5 Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>For if we ourselves are in the world, are contained as individual parts in the whole of the universe, are brought into existence primarily through it, are perfected by all the powers in it, are constituted by its elements, and receive from it our share of life and nature, if this is the case, it is not allowed for us to pass beyond the cosmos and the encosmic orders. ( DM 227, 6–13) The soul could not rise to the paternal Demiurge alone.6 To reach the One, the soul had to be assimilated to the Whole, and this was accomplished only by honoring “all the gods.” Though Iamblichus admits that noetic theurgy worshiped the “One, at the summit of the whole multitude of gods” ( DM 230, 15–16), the direct worship of the One came only “at the very end of life and to very few” ( DM 230, 18–231, 1). In the De Mysteriis Iamblichus did not reveal the details of this elevated form of theurgy ( DM 231, 2–5) except to say that its method of worship corresponded to the simplicity of its object, the One. Although noetic theurgy made no use of material objects, it ppp</p>

<p>Ritual as Cosmogony</p>
<p>would not have been opposed to material theurgies; the One was as present to sublunary natures as it was to the hypercosmic gods. The theurgist who performed noetic worship consequently honored the multitude of encosmic orders contained in the One. In fact, the One was never reached directly—by seeking unity—but by unified activity that imitated the energeia of the One: the manifesting cosmos.</p>
<p>Iamblichus explains:</p>
<p>[J]ust as a cosmos is gathered into one congregation out of many orders, so also the completion of sacrifices—to be faultless and whole—must be connected to the entire order of Superior Beings.</p>
<p>And if, indeed, this order is numerous, all-perfect, and united in several ranks, it is necessary that the sacred rite also should imitate its variety by attaching itself to all the powers. Therefore, in accord with this, and with respect to the great variety of beings around us, it is not allowed to be joined with the divine causes that preside over these powers from a certain part ( meros) that they contain, nor to ascend imperfectly to their first causes. ( DM 231, 6–17) In contrast to Porphyry, Iamblichus felt that souls must participate directly, and theurgically, in the material cosmos. For Iamblichus, cosmogenesis was the divine activity and the material cosmos, including its daimons, was a theophany. To participate in this activity required simply that the ritual and the gods invoked in the rite be appropriate ( prosekon) to the soul that performed the sacrifice. As Iamblichus says: “Each man attends to his sacrifice according to what he is, not according to what he is not; therefore the sacrifice should not surpass the proper measure of the one who performs the worship.”7</p>
<p>There is no simpler or more comprehensive expression of theurgy’s pragmatism. The theurgic cure for any disturbance in the soul had to be adapted to the nature of the illness. When this concerned 7. DM 220, 6–9. I follow the emendation by Gale and Sicherl of thusias for hosias. The ousias preserved in book V was probably a copyist’s error due to the similarity of omicron and theta in the uncial script. The hosias preserved in M, therefore, represents a subsequent attempt to emend the error of ousias. See Jamblique: Les Mystères d’Egypt, trans. and ed. E. des Places (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1966), 170.</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>exaggerated affections or disturbances the god and daimons who had jurisdiction over that condition had to be placated. Theurgy simply attempted to balance the disturbed element of the soul by restoring it to the lord of that element, and to effect this the soul focused on a ritual object connatural ( sungenes) to itself and to the ruling god. Explaining this method, Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>The law of religious worship distributes similars to things obviously similar ( ta homoia . . . tois homoiois) and extends through all things from the highest to the lowest, assigning incorporeals to incorporeals, but bodies to bodies, and to each of these classes (it distributes) things that are proportionate to their natures [ DM</p>
<p>227, 16–228, 2]. . . . Indeed, when the divine causes and the human preparations resembling them are united in one and the same act, the accomplishment of the sacrifice achieves all things and bestows great blessings. ( DM 232, 6–9)</p>
<p>The objects of the rite varied depending on the soul and the god invoked, but if the objects were offered properly they worked in the same way—through the sungeneia that existed between the soul and its sacrifice and the sungeneia between the sacrifice and the god.</p>
<p>Because the soul employed animals, plants, and other objects to enter the energeiai of the gods, one might assume that theurgists believed the objects themselves effected the soul’s unification. Porphyry suggested that this was what theurgists believed, making them no better than sorcerers. Iamblichus disagreed with the assumption: “It is better to assign as the cause [of the power in sacrifices] the intimacy ( philia), familiarity ( oikeiosis), and united relationship ( schesis sundetike) of creators toward their creations and of generators toward things generated” ( DM 209, 11–14). Iamblichus maintained that the sacrifice of a material object released the will of the Demiurge by means of the intermediate orders and the preparation of the soul:</p>
<p>Therefore, with this common principle [i.e., the universal philia]</p>
<p>leading us, whenever we take a certain animal or any of the plants of the earth that preserve intact and pure the will of its maker, by means of this intermediary then, we appropriately move the demiurgic cause which presides over this undefiled. But since these 178</p>
<p>Ritual as Cosmogony</p>
<p>causes are numerous, some, like the Daimones, are immediately engaged, [but] others, like the divine causes [Gods], are situated above these, and even further above these is the one most venerable and leading cause, and in conjunction with the perfect sacrifice, all these causes are moved. ( DM 209, 14–210, 4) The ritual objects awakened corresponding sunthemata in the soul, and for each soul its unification was proportionate to its level of existence. Thus, a noetically received union communicated a more intense awareness of the One than a union received through material objects. Yet the philia was the same, and the noetic theurgist would not have disdained material sacrifices for he already comprehended them through a vital identification with their energeiai (cf. DM 8, 3–6). Again, in theurgy the soul did not escape from generation but assimilated itself to the demiurgy of the world. As the “inspired” Socrates explains in the Cratylus (411e), noesis comes from neou + hesis, the soul longing for the new and generating world. “Ugliness” ( aiskron), by contrast, was “the obstacle to the flow” (416a), from which it may be inferred that the soul’s resistance to generation is what alienated it from beauty and divinity, not the flow of generation itself (see Tim. 43d).</p>
<p>The initial anatrope that the soul suffered in birth was caused, not by the flow of generation—for the flow was theophany—but by the soul’s incapacity to receive the flow. Theurgy enhanced the soul’s receptivity and drew it into deeper resonance with the demiurgic will. Ultimately the soul’s individual identity was restructured so that the anatropic self became a pivot for the gods to experience mortality. The theurgist became a living sunthema, a vehicle of the gods. The theurgic progress of the soul from the sublunar realm to the cosmic and hypercosmic gods may be exemplified in Diagrams 2 and 3.</p>
<p>The apotheosis of the soul has been divided into three stages: A and A.1 represent the soul at the beginning of theurgic disciplines using material sunthemata connected to the orders of the encosmic gods. B and B.1 represent the middle stage of worship using intermediate rites tied to the intermediate (or liberating) gods. C and C.</p>
<p>1 represent the noetic worship of a wholly purified soul directed to 179</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>the hypercosmic gods. A, B, and C, from above, show how the disorder and imperfections of the anatropic soul were replaced at each stage by the divine order of the World Soul. Beginning with material rites the soul used material sunthemata as a foundation (A) for intermediate rites and intermediate sunthemata (B), and these, in turn, supported the complete alignment of the soul into the order of the World Soul in the final state (C). A.1, B.1, and C.1 (side view), show how this movement to the principle of the soul also effected its ascent up the axis of cosmogenesis. At birth the cosmogonic procession from unity was experienced by the anatropic soul as brute necessity and the laws of fate (broken lines). In A.1 as the soul assimilated itself to the encosmic gods (indicated by the solid ascending lines) the continuity of the encosmic order was realized and fate began to appear as providence (solid descending lines). In B.1 the same transformation occurred, as errant necessity and fate were seen as the will of the paternal Nous. Finally in C.1 the circulation of the procession and return became continuous and unbroken, but this was not realized until the soul completely integrated itself to the divine will. The reward of the soul’s anagoge to the paternal Nous was realized in its active participation in the procession from the Nous to the hypercosmic, cosmic, and sublunary worlds, ensuring that the “parts” the soul had purified remained properly situated within their “causes.” In the soul’s coadministra-ting—with the encosmic gods—the extension of daimons into the last things, it helped to ensure that these extensions remained in their causes. This was the cosmogonic weaving of apeiron into peras, and it was accomplished by each soul in its material, intermediate, and noetic theurgies.</p>
<p>In each mode of worship the gods were mediated to the soul by means of sunthemata, and though Iamblichus did not provide a ritual taxonomy he referred to objects that may be distinguished heuristically as material, noetic, and intermediate sunthemata. Since theurgy was more a practical therapy than a philosophic system, this division of sunthemata is based on therapeutic appropriations, not on metaphysical essences. A sunthema may be defined as material when it divinizes the material powers of the soul, intermediate when it divinizes the soul’s intermediate powers, and noetic when it 180</p>

<p>divinizes its noetic powers. All sunthemata were essentially divine but, like the gods, they received different allotments cosmologically and were therefore distinguished by their recipients. In terms of the previous diagram, all sunthemata oriented souls to the vertical axis of the cone. In view of their common divinity but contextual differences they may be defined as “proportionately equivalent.” Therefore, if the ratio 1:2 represents a sunthema appropriate to divinize a noetic soul, for a more divided and materialistic soul the same divinizing power/ratio would be employed in a range of multiplicity proportionate to that soul, say 16:32. In other words, for the sunthema to draw a soul into the demiurgic will it had to affect that soul on its level of existence. This is what Iamblichus means when he says</p>
<p>“the sacrifice should not surpass the proper measure of the soul who performs the worship” ( DM 221, 8–9). The sunthema affected the soul in its world of experience, whether this was entirely material or noetic. Therefore, noetic sunthemata would not be effective in moving a material soul to the vertical axis. On the contrary, if the soul’s intellect served anatropic desires, its movement would not be axial but peripheral to appropriate the noetic sunthema as an idea to inflate its self-importance.8 Iamblichus believed that this kind of conceptual spirituality threatened the integrity of the Platonic school. Theurgy guaranteed that the soul’s anagoge could not be</p>
<p>“rationalized”; the sunthemata that released the will of the Demiurge and effected the soul’s ascent functioned at a level that preceded all conceptualization.</p>
