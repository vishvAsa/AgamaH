Sounds and melodies are conse-

crated to each one of the Gods…

ecause intermediate souls performed a combination of noetic and material rites, they necessarily employed material sunthe-B mata. Indeed, material sunthemata would not have been inap-propriate for purely noetic souls either since material rites were guided by the same gods and, by analogia, in the same way as noetic rites. Nevertheless, there are forms of worship discussed in the De Mysteriis that exhibit less material characteristics than those discussed previously, and for heuristic purposes the objects used in these rites will be designated as “intermediate sunthemata.” These were the visible and audible sunthemata that Iamblichus described in the De Mysteriis as hieratic characters, symbols, names, and musical compositions. Although the designation “intermediate” is my own, I believe the distinction is consistent with Iamblichus’s thought. Following Iamblichus’s principle that the law of worship derived from the order of the gods, the visible and audible symbols mediated between immaterial and material realms just as liberated gods mediated between the hypercosmic and encosmic realms.

Incantations and hieroglyphics did not draw directly from the material order like plants, animals, or stones, yet neither were they wholly immaterial. They were intermediate and remained material to the degree that they had a sensible expression.

It is important not to misunderstand this distinction. It does not mean that the unity of the gods was less present in a stone because it was materially more dense. Iamblichus’s division of sunthemata was based on the needs of souls, not on the degree of divinity in the ritual objects. A soul already justified with material daimons and encosmic gods, for example, still had to sanctify its dianoetic capacities. For such a soul, following the homeopathic principle described in Chapter 4, the cure for its disorder was found in the disordered elements themselves, and this called for sunthemata more akin to dianoetic activity. In short, the symbolic vehicle for a soul’s purification had to be suited to the specific needs of that soul, and if the soul was ready for contact with the intermediate gods, it called for rites and sunthemata of an intermediate order.

Iamblichus speaks of diviners who invoke the gods with “characters” \( charakteres\) sketched on the ground and says that they should follow a carefully prescribed order of worship \( DM 129, 14–131\). Further, in his explanation of divinization effected through the medium of light \( photagogia\), Iamblichus says that theurgic contact may be awakened when light is cast on a wall prepared “with sacred inscriptions of characters” \( DM 134, 4–6\). Although he does not describe these characters in any detail, Proclus, in his commentary on the Timaeus, says the chi \(X\) \( Tim. 36b\) was the “character” \( character\) or “shape” \( schema\) most evocative for recollecting the divinization of the world and our souls \( In Tim. II, 247, 14–29\). The characteres mentioned by Iamblichus probably included this X and other symbols that corresponded to the planetary gods.1 Subsequent Arabic Hermeticists describe such planetary “characters” and claimed that their science derived from theurgists.2

Iamblichus provides an explicit account of visible sunthemata in his exegesis of Egyptian symbols. He explains that since Egyptian symbols originate with the gods, they cannot be understood discur-1.

sively or in terms of human imagination. Here Iamblichus follows Plotinus who praised the Egyptians for having developed a mode of communication superior to discursive thought. For Plotinus the “images” \( agalmata\) engraved on the walls of Egyptian temples

“manifest the non-discursiveness of the intelligible world” \( Enn. V, 8, 6, 8–9\), and he compared them to the “spectacles” viewed by the gods, i.e., to the divine Forms, real and

not imagined \( Enn. V, 8, 5, 20–25\).

The first Egyptian symbol Iambli-

chus describes is a god seated on a

lotus \(see Fig. 1\).3 Iamblichus begins

with the “mud” \( ilus\) in which the

lotus was rooted. For Iamblichus

“mud” represented matter and all that

is corporeal, nutritive, generated, and

subject to change \( DM 250, 17–251, 3\).

Mud was the “primordial cause”

\( archegon aition; DM 251, 5\) of the elements and was therefore pre-estab-

lished as their “foundation” \( puthmen\)

\( DM 251, 5\). The god of generation,

Fig. 1. The sun god as a child  however, wholly transcended his mate-seated on the primeval lotus

\( first century

rial powers. He was “immaterial” \( ahu-

b.c.e. \)

los\), “incorporeal” \( asomatos\), “supernatural” \( huperphues\), and “ungenerated” \( agennetos; 251, 8–9\).

This god “contains all things” \( DM 251, 11–12\) though he remains

“separate” \( choristos; DM 251, 14\) and elevated above the mundane elements. This condition, Iamblichus says, is represented by his being seated on a lotus that separates him from the “mud.” The lotus, therefore, functioned as the intermediary between the transcendent god and the material world, and Iamblichus says its circularity represented the god’s intellectual empire for the circle was the image of the Nous \( DM 252, 2–6\).

cities were then rectified \(made circular\) to create a receptacle sufficient to seat \(i.e., activate\) the anterior presence of the god. The hieroglyph symbolically portrayed the entire cycle of embodiment.

The second Egyptian symbol discussed by Iamblichus portrays a god sailing in a barge \(see Fig. 2\),4 which represented the god that guides the material world while remaining *choristos* \( *DM* 252, 13\).

He identifies this god with the sun, Helios: “Thus, *Helios*, *being separate, governs the tiller of the entire cosmos*” \( *DM* 252, 15–16\). The sun played a central role in the theurgic cult. For Iamblichus, its light-giving power was far more than a conceptual analogue of the noetic Demiurge, it was a *sunthema* of the One itself. The importance of Helios in the Neoplatonism of Emperor Julian testifies to its importance in the Iamblichean school, and the solar motif also reappears in Iamblichus’s remarks on audible symbols.

The visible “characters” of the planetary gods invoked in theurgic ritual had their audible counterparts. Consider, for example, the following rules for composing theurgic hymns:

1. Find out what powers and effects any particular star has in itself, what positions and aspects, and what these remove and produce. And insert these into the meanings of our lyrics, detesting what the stars remove and approving what they produce.

4. S.G.F. Brandon, *Man and God in Art and Ritual* \(New York: Scribner, 1975\), 144, fig. 178 “Atum-Re in solar boat.”

*Theurgy and the Soul*

2. Consider which star chiefly rules which place and man. Then observe what modes these regions and persons generally use, so that you may apply similar ones, together with the meaning first mentioned, to the word which you wish to offer to these same stars.

3. The daily positions and aspects of the stars are to be noticed; then investigate to what speech, songs, movements, dances, moral behavior and actions most men are usually incited under those aspects, so that you may make every effort to imitate these in your songs, which will agree with the similar disposition of the heavens and enable you to receive a similar influx from them.5

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

These principles for invoking the gods were written by Marsilio Ficino, the fifteenth-century leader of the Platonic Academy in Florence. Following Iamblichus, he says that his invocations were not attempts to compel the gods6 but to allow men to “imitate them”

and share in their divine activity.7

Ficino reports that his celestial music derived from “the Ancients,” among whom he includes Iamblichus,8 and though Ficino’s explanation of the effects of these rites differs somewhat from that of Iamblichus,9 their principles were nearly identical.

Consider, for example, Iamblichus’s description of the divinizing effects of theurgic music. Refuting Porphyry’s suggestion that theurgic hymns worked on the passions, he says:

5. Ficino, *Opera Omnia*, 2 vols. \(Basel, 1576; reprint, Turin, 1962\), 562–63; translated by D.P. Walker, *Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella* \(London: Warburg Institute, University of London, 1958; Liechtenstein: Klaus Reprint, 1976\), 17.

6. Walker, *Spiritual and Demonic Magic*, 42.

*Marsilio Ficino: The Book of Life*, trans. Charles Boer \(Irving, Tex.: Spring Publications, 1980\), 160–61.

8. Boer, trans. *Marsilio Ficino*, 150ff.

9. Ficino, unlike Iamblichus, says these rites have an effect only on the human soul. Faced with the charge of attempting to compel angels or, worse yet for Ficino,

“demons,” he argues that the rites change only the soul by accommodating it to the divine powers. Iamblichus says nearly the same, but because for him theurgy is not merely psychological he says that what is awakened in the rites is not the soul, but the “one in the soul,” which, collectively, are the various *sunthemata*.

Rather, we say that sounds and melodies are consecrated to each of the Gods in a proper way and that a natural alliance \( *sungeneia*\) has been suitably allotted to these \[planetary\] Gods according to the particular orders and powers of each, the motions of the universe itself, and the harmonious whirring sounds emitted by their motions. Then, by means of such melodies adapted to the Gods, their divinity becomes present \(for there is nothing at all to stop it\). So, whatever happens to possess a likeness to the Gods directly participates in them; a perfect possession immediately takes place and the \[experience of\] being filled with the essence and power of a Higher Being. \( *DM* 118, 6–119, 9\)

Iamblichus emphasizes that although this possession manifest * *

ed * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

through bodily organs and emotions, it was not caused by somatic conditions. He says:

It is not that the body and soul are in sympathy with each other and are together affected by the melodies. Rather, because *the* *inspiration of the Gods is not separate from the divine harmony, and* *since it has been adapted to it from the beginning*, it is participated by it in the appropriate measures. And the awakening of this inspiration as well as its ceasing occurs in accordance with each order of the Gods. \( *DM* 119, 9–15\)

The divine inspiration \( *epinoia*\) or possession \( *katoche*\) could not occur unless the soul already possessed measures that corresponded “horizontally” to the audible melodies and “vertically” to their inaudible principles. Musical theurgy was a form of *anamnesis* that awakened the soul to its celestial identity with the gods. It was not, Iamblichus argues, a way to purge the soul of psychological or somatic disorders,10 for it affected the soul at a level that preceded its embodiment. Musical theurgy came from the gods and gave the soul direct contact with them. Iamblichus says:

Indeed, before the soul gave itself to the body, it heard the divine harmony plainly. Therefore, after it departs into a body and hears the sort of melodies that especially preserve the trace of the divine harmony, it welcomes these and recollects \( *anamimnesketai*\) the divine harmony from them. It is drawn to this, makes itself at 10. An explanation adopted by Dodds, *The Greeks and the Irrational*, 79, 98.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

home with it, and partakes of it as much as possible. \( *DM* 120, 7–

14\)

According to Iamblichus, Pythagoras was the first composer of this anagogic music. Pythagoras’s special gifts11 allowed him to “thread his intellect into the divine harmony of the stars” \( *VP* 36, 18\) where he was “assimilated to the heavens” \( *VP* 37, 10–11\), heard its ineffable harmony, and re-created its audible “traces” for the disciples of his school.

The sacred names and incantations used in theurgic invocations also originated from the gods, and Iamblichus says the Egyptian prophet Bitys revealed “the name of the god that pervades the entire

* *

cosmos” \( *DM* 268, 2–3\). This recalls Chaldean fragment 37 where the Paternal *Nous* “sounded forth \( *rhoizein*\)” the multiform Ideas.

The term *rhoizos*, “whirring” or “rushing,” was used by Iamblichus to describe the sound of the divine harmony \( *DM* 119, 3\), and Chaldean fragment 146 uses the same term. It speaks of “formless fire, from which a voice \( *phone*\) is sent forth . . . a sumptuous light \( *phos*\) rushing \( *rhoizaion*\) like a spiral round the earth.”12 For the soul to make its ascent to the gods the Oracles say that it had to recover the audible *sumbola* sent from the Father by giving them expression, through “speaking a word.”13

For Iamblichus the god whose “name” pervaded the cosmos was Helios, yet because the recipients of “the undivided gift of the god”

\( *DM* 253, 14\) were themselves divided, they received and expressed it in different ways. Iamblichus says:

11. *VP* 36, 17–18. Iamblichus refers to a “certain ineffable divinity” \( *arrhetos tis* *theiotes*\).

12. *CO*, Frag. 146, 105.

13. *CO*, Frag. 109; 158–59a. In his commentary on the *Alcibiades* Proclus says:

“The secret names of the gods have filled the whole world, as the theurgists say; and not only this world, but also all the powers above it . . . since the ‘mediating name that leaps into the boundless worlds’ has received this function. The gods, then, have filled the whole world both with themselves and with their names”; *Commentary on the First Alcibiades of Plato*, ed. L.G. Westerink \(Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1954\), 150, 10–15; trans. W. O’Neill \(1965, 1971\), 99. Proclus adds that this

“naming power” is perversely reflected in every man’s desire to have the world impressed with his own “name” and power \(150, 8–10\).

These multiform powers are received from *Helios* according to the unique movements of the recipients, and because of this, the symbolic teaching means to show that God remains one through the multitude of his gifts and through the diversity of powers he proves his one power. Hence, this doctrine says God remains one and the same and it assumes that his changes of form and shifting aspects occur in the recipients. \( *DM* 253, 15–254, 3\) Iamblichus refers here to the movement of the sun through the signs of the zodiac. They exist, he says, through receiving the “powers descending from *Helios*.”14 Man’s prayers must therefore be presented to Helios through the many zodiacal *schemata* that the god assumes. Iamblichus says: “The Egyptians employ these sorts of prayers to *Helios* not only in their visions but also in their more ordinary prayers that have this same kind of meaning, and they are offered to God according to this symbolic mystagogy” \( *DM* 254, 6–

10\).

The names used in these prayers were *sunthemata* of the gods and they functioned in the same manner as stone, plant, or musical *sunthemata*. Iamblichus explains that despite the prima facie meaning of the term, invocations do not, in fact, “invoke” the gods or call them down. On the contrary, they “evoke” the divine *sunthemata* lying in the human soul:

It does not, as the name \[ *prosklesis*; *DM* 42, 6\] seems to indicate, incline the intellect of the Gods to men, but according to the truth itself—as it means to teach— *the invocation makes the intelligence* *of men fit to participate in the Gods*, elevates it to the Gods, and harmonizes it with them through orderly persuasion. Whence, indeed, the names of the Gods are adapted to sacred concerns, and with the other divine *sunthemata* they are anagogic and have the power to unite these invocations to the Gods. \( *DM* 42, 9–17\) Iamblichus says the names of the gods were impressed on souls before birth and that theurgic chants awakened them. As Trouillard puts it, “le nom prononce devient, pour ainsi dire, le symbole efficace 14. *DM* 253, 6. In the same way Iamblichus says human souls exist by virtue of gazing on \(receiving\) the gods \( *DM* 8, 13–14\).

*Theurgy and the Soul*

d’un vertu divine.”15 The “names” of the gods, in effect, defined transforming experiences in the soul. Paraphrasing Proclus, Trouillard writes:

Les dieux, comme Zeus, Poseidon ou Hermès, personnifient des théophanies qui sort des révélations diverses de la même divinité.

Celle-ci, étant au-dela de la lumière elle-même, se devoilera sous des aspects divers par autant de systèmes expressifs dont chacun sera présidé par un dieu. Les noms des dieux ne sort pas des attributs divines proprement dits, mais *les modes selon lesquels* *l’efficacité divine retentit en nous*.16

In his *Timaeus* commentary Iamblichus said the paternal Demiurge \(the hidden sun\) contained the intelligible \(i.e., hypercosmic\) realm, just as Helios contained the encosmic powers of the zodiac.

Their power was transmitted in theurgic invocations by awakening the corresponding Helios/Demiurge in the soul. Since “naming,”

“thinking,” and “creating” were one and the same activity for the gods,17 theurgic naming allowed souls to experience the thinking/

creating of the gods. Theurgic naming was equivalent to primordial demiurgy, articulating the powers of the paternal Father through his audible *sunthemata*.18 By reciting the *agalmata* of the gods the theurgist was assimilated to their order and the silence that contained them \(cf. Proclus, *In Crat*. 32, 18–25; 59, 1–8\).
