title = "18 Noetic*Sunthemata*— Mathematics and the Soul"

+++

*The soul contains in itself the*

*sum-total of mathematical reality. *

n the *De Mysteriis*, Iamblichus says he will not discuss noetic forms of worship; but to pursue the division of *sunthemata* into Imaterial, intermediate, and noetic categories, I would argue that the soul’s noetic powers would have to be transformed by noetic objects, and that these would have been best exemplified in numbers. An implicit arithmetic influence is evident already in the intermediate *sunthemata*, for a numerical framework determines the composition of theurgic incantations and melodies. Since Iamblichus was a Pythagorean, it seems likely that he would have given mathematics a central role in the highest form of worship.

That mathematical objects made up the *sunthemata* of noetic worship is a supposition that may easily be misunderstood. Iamblichus never states this explicitly, which might be enough to dismiss the conjecture. I believe, however, that the context of Iamblichus’s thought as demonstrated in relevant citations will bear the supposition out. Far more problematic is our tendency to presume that in noetic or mathematic theurgy Iamblichus’s genuinely Platonic \(i.e.,

“rational”\) teachings may be discerned. In this light, recent studies of theurgy have argued that the material and intermediate forms of worship represent Iamblichus’s “concession” to the intellectual inad-equacies of the common man, his effort to save Platonism by creating a salvific cult to rival the increasing popularity of Christianity. In 212

two recent studies, Andrew Smith and Anne Sheppard argue that there was, in fact, a “higher” form of theurgy free from the sinister elements of animal sacrifice, the chanting of *nomina barbara*, and other superstitions. With a more sympathetic approach to Neoplatonic theurgy, they have attempted to save it from the accusations of irrationality by E.R. Dodds and others by dividing theurgy into high and low forms, the former being appropriate for genuinely spiritual and Platonic souls, the latter for the uneducated.1 Such efforts to render theurgy more intelligible and acceptable to our norms of rationality, however, succeed only in obfuscating the problem.

Our norms of rationality are not the norms of the Neoplatonists.

On this issue Jean Trouillard says:

Dans notre Occident le rationalisme et le primat de la technologie ont tellement imprégné notre mentalité qu’ils sont le plus souvent inconscients. D’ou la difficulté d’entrer dans des pensées comme celle de Proclus, *aussi longtemps que nous tentons de lui appliquer* *nos modèles d’intelligibilité*.2

Trouillard argues here that our belief in the univocity of reason prevents us from grasping the mystagogy of the later Neoplatonists \(223\). Although they valued clarity and coherence of thought, it was never an end in itself. Yet it is difficult for us to realize that “rational thought” did not have the same value for “Platonists” as it does in our age where reason and mathematics form the bases of our worldview. One must grant to Trouillard the credit for recognizing this.

He says: “il faut revenir *à la thèse capitale du néoplatonisme selon* *laquelle la pensée n’est pas la valeur suprême*. Elle est une médiation entre la dispersion du sensible et la pure coincidence mystique” \(83; my emphasis\). The function of reason for the Neoplatonists was simply to reveal “*l’Ineffable qui l’habite*” \( *La mystagogie*, 233\), and 1. For a discussion of recent interpretations of theurgy, particularly those that divide it into “higher” and “lower” forms, see Gregory Shaw, “Rituals of Unification in the Neoplatonism of Iamblichus,” *Traditio* 41 \(1985\): 1–28; A. Smith, *Porphyry’s* *Place*, 32–99; and Anne Shepard, “Proclus’ Attiude to Theurgy,” *Classical Quarterly* 32 \(1982\): 212–24.

rational thought was simply one mode of activity through which a superior intelligence guided and sustained the soul throughout its embodiment.

If mathematic elements functioned for Iamblichus as *sunthemata* it was not because of their “horizontal” expression as rational formulas. Their intelligibility alone did not make them theurgic but their capacity to create noetic rhythms capable of receiving the gods. Their horizontal expression as intellectual formulas was no more theurgic than the horizontal expression of stones, animals, or songs. Taken as ends in themselves, mathematical formulas were as much obstacles to the soul as the crudest form of fetish worship or passionate obsession. If, as I shall argue, mathematic elements made up the *sunthemata* of noetic theurgy, they must be understood as ritual objects and according to the same principles as the other *sunthemata*, “not that we may regard those things as Gods, but that we may worship the Gods *through* them.”3 Despite the cognitive content of mathematics their theurgic function was to transform the soul, not “teach” it.4

The importance of mathematics in the Platonic dialogues is unquestioned today. What is unclear, however, as it was even to Plato’s students, is the role that mathematics played in their spiritual discipline and how it related to the soul.5 Mathematic elements are fully evident in the *Timaeus* where the Demiurge creates the World Soul out of geometric, harmonic, and arithmetic proportions. The entire passage from 35a to 35b is based on the *tetraktus*, 3. Julian, *Letter to a Priest* 293ab, in *The Works of the Emperor Julian*, 3 vols., trans. W.C. Wright \(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1969\), 2: 308–9.

4. Cf. Aristotle’s remark that the “mysteries” did not teach the soul anything, but made it experience something; Synesius, *Dion* 10, 48a. Similarly, mathematic rituals were not learned or taught but “performed” to effect a transformation of the soul; cf. Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1051a, 29–31.

5. Aristoxenus’s well-known report on Plato’s lecture “On the Good” shows how paradoxical and disturbing his listeners found the identification of the “One”

and the “Good.” The variety of reports on what Plato meant by his mathematizing of the Forms suggests that Plato himself never made this clear to his students or that his explanations allowed for a variety of interpretations; see Aristoxenus, *Elements of Harmony*, II, 30–1, Meibom; see J.N. Findlay, *Plato: The Written and* *Unwritten Dialogues *\(London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974\), appendix I, 413.

the Pythagorean symbol for cosmogenesis.6 Mathematics was central to the educational program of Platonists and each teacher developed his own interpretation of the numerical proportions of the World Soul described by Plato.

In Iamblichus’s commentary on the *Timaeus* 35b, for example, he posits that the seven numbers that divide the World Soul—1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27—had metaphysical functions. Sameness and unity were under the monad, procession under the dyad, and return under the triad. The tetrad functioned as a mean, communicating the primary order to its secondary manifestation, the ennead functioned as a “new monad,” the ogdoad as dyadic procession, and the *eikosi-heptad* \(27\) exemplified the power of return. According to Iamblichus the tetrad held the pivotal position of the *mean*. He says: “The Tetrad, being in the middle, through being a square, has the quality of remaining stable; on account of its being even times even, \(it has\) the quality of proceeding; and through being filled with all the ratios from the monad, \(it has\) the property of returning. And these are symbols of divine and ineffable things.”7 There were, however, a variety of opinions in the later Academy as to how the soul was defined with regard to the mathematicals.

In the *De Anima* Iamblichus reviews the opinions of those who identified the soul as a “mathematical essence.” He lists three positions:

1. *Soul as geometric figure*:

Now, one kind of mathematical essence is the figure \( *to schema*\), being the limit of extension and the extension itself. The Platonist Severus defined the soul in these very terms, while Speusippus defined it as the form of that which is extended in all directions.

\( *Stob*. I, 364, 2–5\)

2. *Soul as number*:

Number, therefore, is still another kind of mathematical essence.

Indeed, some Pythagoreans find that number without any qualifi-cation is a fitting description of the soul: Xenocrates, as “self-6. Francis M. Cornford, trans. and comm., *Plato’s Cosmology: The Timaeus of* *Plato* \(London, 1937; reprint, New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1959\), 66–72.

moved” \[number\]; Moderatus the Pythagorean, as containing

\[numerical\] ratios. \( *Stob*. I, 364, 8–11\)

3. *Soul as harmony*:

Let us now consider harmony, not that seated in the body, but the mathematical harmony. This latter harmony, in a word, somehow brings things which are disjointed into proportion and connection, and Moderatus equates the soul with this. \( *Stob*. I, 364, 19–

23\)

It is clear that Platonic and Pythagorean philosophers identified the soul with different branches of the mathematicals, and in the *De* *Anima* Iamblichus leaves the issue unresolved. In his treatise *On* *General Mathematical Science*, however, he takes up the problem again and attempts to solve it.

It would not be reasonable to posit the soul as being just one class of the mathematicals. . . . Therefore, the soul, should not be defined either as \[1\] idea of the all-extended \[Speusippus\], or as \[2\]

self-moved number \[Xenocrates\], or as \[3\] harmony of \(numerical\) ratios \[Moderatus\], or as anything else of this kind specifically, but rather, all these should be intertwined together. For if the soul is a numerable idea and subsists according to the numbers containing harmony, all the symmetries of the mathematical order ought to be subsumed together under the soul along with all the mathematical proportions. On account of this, then, the soul coexists together with the geometric, arithmetic and harmonic proportions, so that by analogy the soul is identical with \[all\]

mathematical ratios; it has a certain connaturality \( *sungenia*\) with the *archai* of existing things; it lays hold of all reality and has the capacity to resemble all things.8. . . To sum up the whole doctrine, we think the soul exists in ratios common with all mathematicals, possessing, on the one hand, the power of discerning them, and on the other hand, the power of generating and producing the incor-8. *DCMS* 40, 12–41, 3.

poreal measures themselves, and with these measures the soul has the capacity to fit together the generation and completion of forms in matter by means of images, proceeding from the invisible to the visible, and joining together the things outside with those inside.

In view of all this, in brief, the definition of the soul contains in itself the sum-total of mathematical reality.9

For Iamblichus, the soul was identified with *all* branches of the mathematicals together, a position that Philip Merlan summed up aptly: “he who says ‘soul’ expresses mathematics in its fulness”;10

this is particularly so when soul bestows mathematical measures on the material realm.11

There is nothing explicitly theurgical in this view of the soul and mathematics. Nevertheless, Iamblichus’s description of the soul joining the “inside” with the “outside” by means of mathematical images, parallels the function of ritual *sunthemata*. While it would be incorrect to conflate theurgy with mathematics, the structural analogy between them is striking, particularly where Iamblichus compares mathematical exercises to a kind of Platonic *anamnesis*.

11. While I agree with Merlan’s characterization of the soul and numbers, B.D.

Larsen argues that Merlan mistakenly interprets Iamblichus in chapters 9 and 10 of the *DCMS* as identifying the soul with mathematicals as such. Larsen contends that ppp

217



The soul is raised up to the objects of knowledge from without \( *exothen*\), and while it receives from things other \[than itself\] the beginning of its recollection \( *anamnesis*\), it projects \( *proballein*\) this beginning from itself. This activity is not stable according to one energy—as is the case with the *Nous*—but in movement the soul proceeds out of itself and into itself. Nor, in this, is the soul complete, as is the *Nous*, but in continually seeking and finding the soul proceeds from a lack of knowledge to a fulness thereof. It is divided equally between the limit \( *peras*\) and the unlimited \( *apeiron*\). Wherefore, the soul continually advances from the unlimited to being defined and transforms itself for the reception of mathematical figures.12

This transformation was more than intellectual because mathematics permeated the soul’s entire life \( *DCMS* 69, 18–23\). In strictly Platonic terms, the soul was a mathematical entity \( *Tim*. 34–36; 43–

44\) and its immortal *ochema* was also designed according to mathematical ratios. Iamblichus’s view of mathematical images as living *logoi* of the *Nous* shares little with our understanding of numbers as ppp

intellectual abstractions.13 For Pythagoreans the study of numbers was a religious exercise. Iamblichus says that “if we wish to study mathematics in a Pythagorean manner, we ought to pursue zeal-ously its God-inspired, anagogic, cathartic and initiatory process.”14

Hardly the prerequisites of mathematicians today\! The requirements for a Pythagorean mathematician were far more demanding, for Pythagoreans accepted only those who were willing “to share their entire life with the community” \( *DCMS* 74, 23–26\).

For Iamblichus, mathematics revealed divine mysteries. Specifically, he maintained that mathematics recapitulated the soul’s descent and return, and since the soul was a mathematical entity, the performance of mathematical disciplines allowed it to see this process clearly. The soul’s mental projection of mathematic images initiated a ritual activity that effected the soul’s return to its true self \( *autos*\) if the *mathesis* was performed in a Pythagorean manner. As Proclus put it, in the performance of mathematics “the soul becomes at the same time seeing and seen.”15

Mathematical activity exemplifies the Iamblichean standard for every theurgic apotheosis: that the embodied and self-alienated soul recover its identity \( *autos*\) by immersion in the other \( *heteros*\). The divinizing “other” was encountered in a theurgic rite, and each rite had to be appropriate to the condition of the soul who performed it; that is, to its degree and manner of self-alienation. Just as the material powers of the soul were divinized through material sacrifices, and the intermediate powers were divinized by visual or audible images, so the noetic powers of the soul were divinized through the mental imagery of mathematic objects. In each case, the

“weight” of the rite was proportionate to the “weight” of the soul’s self-alienation; otherwise it would not have the proper effect. And 13. Iamblichus argues that *ta mathematika* are not drawn out of sensible things by abstraction \( *kata aphairesin*\) but descend directly from the Forms which also give them their appearance in our imagination; *DCMS* 34, 7–12.

in each case the soul was made divine through its imitation of the cosmogonic cycle: it went out of itself in a ritually controlled manner to return to the god within.

The structural similarity of *mathematike* to theurgy is not the only reason to suppose that mathematic elements made up the noetic *sunthemata*. Iamblichus’s portrayal of the Pythagorean *bios* in *De Vita Pythagorica* suggests a direct correlation between ritual worship and mathematic disciplines. Iamblichus says that Pythagoras learned his mysteries from “barbarians,” in particular the Egyptians, in whose temples he spent twenty-two years, “studying astronomy and geometry, and being initiated in all the mystic rites of the Gods.”16 During his tenure with the Babylonians, Pythagoras was instructed by the Magi, “where he was educated thoroughly in their solemn rites, learned perfect worship of the Gods with them, and reached the highest point in knowledge of numbers, justice, and other mathematical disciplines.”17 These mathematical initiations were passed down by Pythagoras in symbolic and enigmatic forms yet, Iamblichus says, these enigmas were designed to illuminate those philosophers whose genius surpassed human understanding \( *huper anthropinen epinoian*; *VP* 59, 27–60, 1; chap. 103\).

The fact that Iamblichus’s portrayal of Pythagoras reflects the ideal life as conceived by Iamblichus more than it does a history of Pythagoras,18 makes it all the more useful for understanding Iamblichus’s theurgical agenda and the role of mathematics in ritual.

The Iamblichean Pythagoras was primarily a revealer of mysteries.

Iamblichus says: “Pythagoras proclaimed the purificatory rites of the Gods and what are called ‘mystic initiations’ \( *teletai*\), and he 16. *VP* 13, 8–11, chap. 19, in *De Vita Pythagorica Liber*, ed. L. Deubner \(1937\); ed.

The translation, modified slightly, is that of John Dillon and Jackson Hershbell, *Iamblichus: On* *the Pythagorean Way of Life* \(Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars Press, 1991\).

had most accurate knowledge of these things. Moreover, the Pythagoreans say that he made a *synthesis of divine philosophy and* *the worship of the Gods*.”19 The synthesis of philosophy and ritual worship was precisely the agenda that Iamblichus took upon himself. He attempted to integrate the *theia philosophia* of the Platonic tradition with the *therapeia* of the gods that he, like Pythagoras, learned from the barbarian priests of Egypt and Chaldea.

The result of this synthesis, as read into the life of Pythagoras, was a thoroughgoing application of numbers to worship. Libations were to be made three times; Apollo delivered oracles from a tripod because the *trias* was the first number; Aphrodite received sacrifices on the sixth day, and Herakles on the eighth day of the month \( *VP*

86, 1–8; chap. 154\). Temples were to be entered on the right but departed from the left because the “right” \( *dexion*\) was the principle of the “odd number” and divine, while the “left” \( *aristeron*\) was a symbol of the “even number” and of what dissolves \( *VP* 88, 3–6; chap. 156\). Iamblichus also reports that Pythagoras taught the Scythian Abaris “physiology” and “theology,” which included a new form of divination. He says: “Instead of divination through the examination of sacrificed animals he taught Abaris divination through numbers, believing this to be purer, more divine, and more akin to the heavenly numbers of the Gods” \( *VP* 54, 22–25; chap. 93\).

Abaris must have been spiritually ready for this teaching or Pythagoras would not have revealed it \( *VP* 54, 24–26; chap. 93\) for Pythagorean \(i.e., theurgic\) pedagogy required that each person perform only the kind of worship appropriate to his “nature” \( *phusis*\) and “power” \( *dunamis*; *VP* 54, 28; chap. 93\).

Iamblichus says that Pythagoras did not want to diminish Abaris’s desire for the truth but taught him that instead of divining through blood sacrifices he could more securely discover the divine will through arithmetic science \( *VP* 83, 9–18; chap. 147\). By means of it the soul was able to bring the mind into resonance with the numbers of the World Soul.

mind and allowed it to participate in the gods \( *VP* 122, 17–20; chap.

78, 6; chap. 138\). For some in the Pythagorean community, blood sacrifice was the appropriate means for this, for others, the performance of mathematic mysteries.20 Indeed, as Walter Burkert suggests, there may have been a hidden connection between the mathematical *tetraktus* and the *triktus*, the altar of blood sacrifice.

Burkert explains:

The *tetraktys*, “a tetrad” made up of unequal members, is a cryptic formula, only comprehensible to the initiated. The word inevitably reminds of *triktys*, the “triad” of different sacrificial animals. Is the sacrificial art of the seer, involving the shedding of blood, superseded by a “higher,” bloodless secret?21

For Iamblichus, the answer was clearly yes. The Pythagorean *bios*, which in large part was the theurgical bios, defined a continuity of worship extending from blood sacrifice to the sacrifice of numbers.

In a passage from Pythagoras’s *On the Gods*, Iamblichus says the

“eternal essence of number” was praised as the “most providential principle of the universe, of heaven, earth and the intermediate nature.”22 He concludes: “By means of these same numbers Pythagoras created a marvelous divination and worship of the Gods according to the numbers that are most especially allied to them”

\( *VP* 83, 5–7; chap. 147\).

While Pythagoras and his contemplative disciples did not sacrifice animals, “he ordered the *Acusmatikoi* and *Politikoi* \[his exoteric disciples\] to sacrifice animals such as the cock, lamb, or some other newly born animal—but not frequently, and not to sacrifice oxen.”
