If, as I have argued, mathematics formed an essential part of the worship of the gods, Iamblichus left no practical guide for its theurgic use. Proclus and Damascius provide the only references to a theurgy of numbers and even they give little concrete detail. In Platonic Theology IV where Proclus discusses the anagogic power of numbers he says:
The unifying numbers, in themselves, are unknowable. For they are more ancient than Beings and more unified than Forms, and since they are the generators of Forms they exist prior to those beings we call “intelligibles” ( noeta). The most august of theurgies demonstrate this, since they make use of numbers capable of acting ineffably, and by means of them, they effect the greatest and most ineffable of operations.1">

  <p>*A man of this kind is above all law. *</p>
<p>If, as I have argued, mathematics formed an essential part of the worship of the gods, Iamblichus left no practical guide for its theurgic use. Proclus and Damascius provide the only references to a theurgy of numbers and even they give little concrete detail. In <em>Platonic Theology</em> IV where Proclus discusses the anagogic power of numbers he says:</p>
<p>The unifying numbers, in themselves, are unknowable. For they are more ancient than Beings and more unified than Forms, and since they are the generators of Forms they exist prior to those beings we call “intelligibles” ( <em>noeta</em>). The most august of theurgies demonstrate this, since they make use of numbers capable of acting ineffably, and by means of them, they effect the greatest and most ineffable of operations.1</p>
<p>Proclus explains that unifying numbers are “monadic” and have two aspects: (1) as the numerical Forms of triad, pentad, heptad; and (2) as unities or principles of these Forms. Thus, Proclus says, “each of them is one and many.”2 What Proclus means may 1. Proclus, <em>Théologie platonicienne</em> ( <em>Th. Pl</em>.) IV, 100, 21–101, 4, trans. and ed.</p>

<p>be explained by reference to Nicomachus’s distinction3 between</p>
<p>“conventional” numbers, which are man’s invention (e.g., i&rsquo; = 10, k'</p>
<p>= 20, and v&rsquo; = 800) and “natural” numbers, which are more “primitive” and are expressed graphically, the number bearing an intrinsic relationship to its shape. Thus, for example:</p>
<p>1 = <em>a</em> 2 = <em>aa</em> 3 = <em>aaa</em> 4 = <em>aaaa</em> 4</p>
<p>With regard to the formal and henadic aspects of numbers the triad as henad would be imagined as (i.e., the unified triad, or triad in potential), and the actualized triad as followed by all the subsequent “triadic” numbers.</p>
<p>(i.e., numbers which are “graphically” triangular). The same holds for the pentad which, as unified, is but in actualized form is and so on.5</p>
<p>Although Proclus does not say how theurgical numbers were employed, he refers to them as the temporal measures of the cosmos and speaks of the power of Time to perfect souls:6 “Time 3. It may be of interest to note that Proclus considered himself to be the reincarnation of Nicomachus. See Marinus, <em>Vita Procli</em> 28, ed. J.F. Boissonade (Leipzig, 1814).

<p>proceeds according to number, and by number it measures the existence of all souls.”7 Given the fact that the proportions of Time—revealed in the heavens—were identical with the numerical proportions of the soul, the regulation of ritual <em>energeia</em> with heavenly <em>energeia</em> would tie the numbers of the soul to their ineffable unities. By performing rituals at precise times and in accord with appropriate constellations, the soul would be united with the gods.8</p>
<p>Iamblichus seems to suggest this mode of theurgy in the <em>De Mysteriis</em> when he discusses Egyptian astrology:</p>
<p>The Egyptians do not simply contemplate these things theoretically, but by means of sacred theurgy they report that they ascend to higher and more universal realms, superior to fate, even up to the Creator God, using neither matter nor employing anything else at all <em>except the observation of the critical moment</em>. ( <em>DM</em> 267, 6–12) In his <em>Platonic Theology</em> I, Proclus reports that the Pythagoreans made use of mathematics “for the recollection ( <em>anamnesis</em>) of divine principles”9 and “consecrated numbers and geometric shapes to the gods.”10 In his *Commentary on Euclid * Proclus describes the “rhythmic choruses of the heavenly bodies” ( <em>In Euclidem</em> 137, 13) that trace out copies of the “Intellectual Forms” ( <em>In Euclidem</em>, 137, 16). He says: Transcending all these forms are the perfect, uniform, unknowable and incomprehensible figures of the Gods ( <em>schemata ton</em> <em>theon</em>), which, being mounted on the intellectual figures, impose unifying limits upon all figures, holding all things together in their unifying boundaries. Theurgy, having represented their properties in the statues of the Gods, has amplified them in various ways. ( <em>In</em> <em>Euclidem</em>, 138, 5–12)</p>
<p>To each god, he concludes, there are appropriate symbols and shapes 7. Ibid., 102, 4–5. In attributing to “time” such powers Proclus followed Iamblichus; see *In. Tim. *, frag. 63 and commentary, in Dillon, <em>Iamblichi Chalcidencis</em>, 172–</p>
<p>75; 345–47.</p>

<p>This would be the theurgic fulfillment of Platonic <em>paideia</em> as outlined in the <em>Timaeus</em> 90b–d.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>225</p>
<p>( <em>In Euclidem</em>, 138, 21–22). One may assume, therefore, that each god was associated with a geometric figure that appeared in the heavens</p>
<p>“at critical moments,” and that these figures (constellations?) were employed at such times in some form of theurgic worship.</p>
<p>An extensive citation from Damascius supports this. In his discussion of the “figure” ( <em>schema</em>) of the One-Being of the <em>Parmenides</em> (145b, 3), after explaining that each of the gods has a shape, he says: For why did the Pythagoreans consecrate to one God the circle, to another the triangle, to another the square, and to each of the others another rectilinear figure as well as their mixtures, as the semi-circle to the Dioscouroi? Philolaos, who was wise in these matters, oftentimes assigned to one same God one or another figure in accord with one or another property of that God. <em>In general terms</em> <em>it is certain that the circular figure is common to all the intellectual</em> <em>Gods qua intellectual, while the different rectilinear figures are the</em> <em>properties of each respectively in accord with their particular properties of numbers, angles and sides</em>. For example, the triangle is the property of Athena and the square of Hermes—as Philolaos has already said. And of the square, one angle is the property of Rhea, another of Hera, and the other angles are associated with other deities.11 And this is the complete theological definition of figures.</p>
<p>( <em>Dub. et Sol</em>. II [261], 127, 7–17)</p>
<p>Damascius adds that not all sacred figures need be enclosed and cites the helix which he also accepts as a “figure” ( <em>Dub. et Sol</em>., 127–20–21).</p>
<p>His second example of an unenclosed figure is that of the Egyptian god “Tet” represented as a vertical line with three, or four, horizontal lines, depending on the local cult:12 . The inhabitants of Gaza, he says, consecrate this same figure (with one more horizontal line) to Zeus ( <em>Dub. et Sol</em>. II, 128, 1–2):</p>

<p>In his commentary on Euclid, Proclus also cites Philolaos as the authority for attributing goddesses to the angles of the square.

<p>Damascius concludes, citing the authority of the Oracles, that since the gods often reveal themselves in a single curved line, and since every line has a beginning, a middle, and an end, each of these may also be considered a “figure” ( *Dub. et Sol. * II, 128, 3–7).</p>
<p>Sources are too few and fragmentary to reconstruct a coherent system of mathematic symbols employed in theurgy. In any case, given its practical and therapeutic purposes, the possibility that a coherent systematization ever existed should probably be ruled out.</p>
<p>On the basis of the evidence, however, it may be inferred that the geometric figures of the gods functioned as contemplative icons, perhaps like the geometric mandalas of yogic disciplines. The comparison is intriguing, particularly in consideration of the mandala’s function. According to Mircea Eliade: “the mandala is at once an image of the universe and a theophany—the cosmic creation being, of course, a manifestation of the divinity. But the mandala also serves as a ‘receptacle’ for the gods. In Vedic India the gods descended into the altar—which proves the continuity between the tantric liturgy and the traditional cult.”13 The continuity asserted by Eliade seems to be the same kind of continuity that Burkert suspected between the sacrificial <em>triktus</em> and the mathematical <em>tetraktus</em>. Both demonstrate the transformation of cults of blood sacrifice into mathematical forms that served the same function: to provide a receptacle ( <em>hupodoche</em>) to receive and worship the gods.14</p>

<li>Though the structural comparison between tantra and theurgy should not be pressed too far, the similarities between the two are striking. Tantra, like theurgy, may be defined as that which provides continuity or unfolding of divine gnosis (Eliade, <em>Yoga</em>, 200), and it was introduced to India in the fourth century c.e. with the argument that ritual practice was the only mode of worship capable of saving man in this age. Tantra incorporated aboriginal Indian elements as well as alien features, which led Eliade to suggest that it may have been introduced to India from</li>
</ol>
<p>“the great Western mysteriosophic current” (202). According to Eliade, the Bud-dhist tantras are divided into four classes which, like theurgy, are related “to the principal human types and temperaments” (201). As in Neoplatonic theurgy, these classes are graded and proceed from the more material and overt forms of ritual practices/persons, to the more spiritual and interior.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>or differentiated aspects of the cosmos were represented by triangles with their apex down: the masculine or undifferentiated aspect, was represented by triangles with apex up: and the two were intertwined:</p>
<p>In theurgic “mandalas” the principles were the same but represented differently. Proclus reports that rectilinear angles proceed from the (masculine) principle of the Limit ( <em>to peras</em>) and produce the one right angle, ruled by equality and similarity to every other right angle; [they are] determinate and fixed in nature, admitting neither of growth nor of diminution: ( <em>In Euclidem</em> 132, 9–12).</p>
<p>From the (feminine) principle of the Unlimited ( <em>to apeiron</em>) come acute and obtuse angles that are subject to variations of more and less ( <em>In Euclidem</em> 132, 9–12): , . The right angles, Proclus continues, are associated with the hypercosmic gods whereas the acute and obtuse angles are associated with the encosmic gods. The latter lead the soul down into generation while the former, remaining present in the latter as their principles, provide to the soul a connection with the gods above fate ( <em>In Euclidem</em> 132–34). Since the soul contains all the mathematicals, the geometric figures that it consecrates, draws, and visualizes would schematize the entire process of its separation from, and return to the gods.</p>
<p>In the <em>De Mysteriis</em> Iamblichus discusses the ritual use of number only incidentally in order to distinguish ritual objects that are in physical <em>sumpatheia</em> with one another, from the gods who are the causes of those sympathies. As causes, the gods were unaffected by the sympathies enjoined in the rites. The latter, Iamblichus says, served only to reveal, not affect, the divine principles. Others, however, believed that the benefits of sacrifice were caused by the objects employed in the rite. Iamblichus refutes this view by referring to the belief that numerical sympathies <em>caused</em> the benefits of sacrifice: “The same absurd conclusions occur if some of those among us [i.e., Egyptian priests], attribute the effect (of the sacrifice) to numbers—since the “sixty” associated with the crocodile is related to <em>Helios</em>” ( <em>DM</em> 208, 7–9). Iamblichus refers to the Egyptian 228</p>

<p>belief that the crocodile lays sixty eggs and lives sixty years, the number associated with the heavenly cycle of the sun. Because of this, some believed that rites involving the crocodile would command the presence of the sun god through their common numerical identity.15</p>
<p>Although Iamblichus denied that the sympathy of crocodile and sun with the number “sixty” could effect the presence of the sun god, his refutation did not rule out the possibility that numbers were used in theurgy as a kind of organizational system through which rituals could be designed and performed. Dominic O’Meara’s study of Iamblichus’s Pythagorean texts, including the fragments preserved by Psellus: <em>On Physical Number</em> and <em>On Ethical and Theological Arithmetic</em>, supports this idea.16 In <em>On Physical Number</em> Iamblichus explained that all things in nature not only were determined by number but were the concrete manifestations of number, including the stars, animals, plants, and stones. This also included all the rhythms of life: cycles of disease, reproduction, growth, and death.</p>
<p>In short, the variety and vitality of nature was simply the concrete manifestation of numerical powers. Iamblichus distinguished intelligible numbers ( <em>noetoi arithmoi</em>)17 from mathematical numbers ( <em>mathematikoi arithmoi</em>)18 and then discussed natural numbers ( <em>phusikoi arithmoi</em>), those involved directly in the shaping of matter.</p>

<p>Physical number is found in the lowest things, things generated and divided in bodies. For the principles mixed in bodies, both in animals and plants, are physical numbers ( <em>phusikoi arithmoi</em>), for each of these is born, grows, and dies at determined times. And the philosopher should fit the appropriate numbers to the causes in nature.</p>
<p>And since form ( <em>eidos</em>) is, in nature, the first and most important cause (for the being of all depends on it), thus such numbers as provide being to nature and are essential, these are connatural ( <em>homophues</em>) with forms.19</p>
<p>Iamblichus later identified odd numbers specifically as form-giving and even numbers as “appropriate to matter,”20 with their mixture creating the physical world. Even the human being was made of two numbers:</p>
<p>For since animals are made up of soul and body, the Pythagoreans say soul and body are not produced from the same number, but soul from cubic number [6 x 6 x 6 = 216],21 and body from the irregular volume ( <em>bomiskos</em>) [5 x 6 x 7 = 210].22</p>
<p>The fact that <em>bomiskos</em> also described the shape of a sacrificial altar was a coincidence unlikely to have been missed by Iamblichus. It brings to mind Burkert’s connection between the <em>triktus</em> of blood sacrifice and the Pythagorean <em>tetraktus</em>, yet it also points to something distinctively and paradoxically Iamblichean. For, although the theurgist’s physical body effected his separation from the gods, it was also the sacrifical altar ( <em>bomiskos</em>) by which he returned to them.</p>
<p>Iamblichus did not think that discursive conceptions of numbers and letters could influence the gods, but he firmly believed that cosmogonic and natural numbers were their <em>energeia</em>. Therefore, Iamblichus was careful to distinguish conventional numbers from the natural and theurgic. Evidence of Iamblichus’s caution is seen in his 19. <em>On Phys. Numb</em>. 7–16; O’Meara, <em>Pythagoras Revived</em>, 219.</p>

<p>refutation of the numero-logical and grammatical theories of Amelius.23 Amelius theorized that since there were four elements ( <em>stoicheia</em>) in the cosmos24 and four elements ( <em>stoicheia</em>) in the word</p>
<p>“soul” (cyx¸), the soul must be the “sum of number or the geometrical number” on the grounds that Plato said all geometric proportions exist among the four elements.25 According to Iamblichus this theory derived from human imagination and convention, not from divine inspiration. Amelius’s “proof ” was that if one took the</p>
<p>“extremes” of cyx¸, i.e., c and h, and substituted for c (= 700) its root, i.e., z (= 7), one had, as a result, zh, or zÎ = “the soul lives”</p>
<p>(Proclus, <em>In Tim</em>. II, 275, 24–26). Such theorizing was rejected by Iamblichus:</p>
<p>For after all, “Body” ( <em>soma</em>) is composed of the same number of letters, and even “Non-Being” ( <em>me on</em>) itself; so that then Non-Being ( <em>me on</em>) would be the sum of number. And you could find many other words made up of the same number of letters, words for things base and even mutually contradictory, all of which it is surely not correct to mix and jumble up together.26</p>
<p>In response to Amelius’s other conjectures concerning the “shape”</p>
<p>of numbers, Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>Secondly, it is not safe to base any theories on the letters themselves; for these are conventional ( <em>thesei</em>), and their shapes have changed between ancient times and the present. . . .</p>
<p>Thirdly, reduction of the Soul to the root numbers [i.e., c = 700</p>
<p>to z = 7] and wasting one’s time on them transfers the speculation from one set of numbers to another; for the number seven in the units is not the same as that in the tens or that in the hundreds.27</p>

<p>The theory refuted is actually that of Theodorus, as Proclus reports, but Dillon suggests that Amelius may have shared the same theories and that Iamblichus wanted to avoid refuting Theodorus, his own pupil, so refutes Amelius; see Dillon, <em>Iamblichi Chalcidensis</em>, 338.</p>

<p>Dillon explains that Iamblichus was criticizing the practice of</p>
<p>“gematria,” where each letter of the Hebrew or Greek alphabet was assigned a numerical value. In this theory, when the sums of the letters of two different words were equivalent they were considered en rapport.28 For Iamblichus, however, this kind of “hidden connection” was contrived and only a caricature of the true continuity and <em>philia</em> of existing things. Since numerical systems based on letters were merely “conventional” ( <em>thesei</em>) and not “natural” ( <em>phusei</em>), they could not provide the basis for theurgic ritual. If theurgists employed an arithmetic system to conduct theurgies, it would not have been based on an artificial gematria for this would contradict Iamblichus’s rule that superior orders cannot be moved by their inferiors.29 To invoke the gods, one had to employ <em>their</em> speech as revealed in the cosmos and in their numerical powers.</p>
<p>Although Iamblichus denied that the discursive use of numbers was theurgic, he knew that as a numerical entity the soul eventually had to undergo a numerical transformation. Since all mathematical images ultimately had their “foundation” ( <em>epereismos</em>) in the Forms ( <em>DCMS</em> 34, 9) to imagine them—even discursively—was to enform one’s <em>phantasia</em> with their noetic <em>energeiai</em>. Since these images were intrinsically connected to the <em>noeta</em>, if the soul had the capacity to coordinate its <em>phantasia</em> with these mathematic images it could create a subtle receptacle to embody them. Just as material souls were united with material gods through material <em>sunthemata</em>, noetic souls were united with the immaterial <em>Nous</em> through mathematical <em>sunthemata</em>. This form of theurgy might initially have been a discursive exercise: mathematic visualizations, but at a certain point the visualizations would spontaneously become visions empowered by the gods. This lifted the soul’s discursive energies into the numbers of the heavens described in the <em>Timaeus</em>, and the soul surren-dered its false “unity” to the unifying action of the One. Noetic theurgy, therefore, penetrated to the core of the soul’s inversion, for 28. Dillon, <em>Iamblichi Chalcidensis</em>, 338–39. In this case Amelius (Theodorus) appears to be using an even more simplified gematria.</p>

<p>the objectified unity of the soul—its self-identity—was the foremost obstacle that barred it from sharing in the objectifying unity of the One. Yet, paradoxically, this alienation was the sine qua non for the soul’s theurgy and participation in cosmogony.30</p>
<p>It is possible that mathematics did not make up what Iamblichus calls “the simple and incorporeal form of worship purified from all generation” ( <em>DM</em> 219, 8–9). Although I have argued that <em>ta</em> <em>mathematika</em> were the “intellectual offerings adapted to the hypercosmic gods” ( <em>DM</em> 226, 9–10) I may be wrong. Iamblichus himself says the</p>
<p>“summit” of hieratic worship was attained only rarely and that souls who reach it were beyond the limits of his discourse (whether he means book V alone, or possibly all of the <em>De Mysteriis</em> is unclear). He says: “Our present discourse, however, does not ordain laws for a man of this kind <em>for he is above all law</em>, but to those in need of a certain law it introduces this kind of legislation” ( <em>DM</em> 231, 2–5). The noetic theurgist was “above all law” ( <em>kreiton pantos</em> <em>nomou</em>). Does this mean that such souls have left behind the rituals of the common man, as an “enlightened society” frees itself from the superstitions of a darker (and more ritualistic) age? This is how the enlightened scholar sympathetic to Iamblichus might read this passage. “Here,” he would argue, “here is the Plotinian dimension of Iamblichus’s theurgy!” Leaving to the side what a Plotinus might say, I would argue that the most elevated theurgist was “above the law” not because he knew better or had graduated beyond such superstitions. In light of Iamblichus’s view of cosmology, he was above the law because he was above its effects, having become their living embodiment.31 After all, since the laws of ritual reflected the order of the gods, a divinized soul would have been assimilated to ppp</p>

<p>233</p>
<p>that order and hence to the laws ( <em>nomoi</em>) of hieratic worship. He was no longer under the law because he <em>was</em> the law.32</p>
<p>We might reconsider the notion of a mathematic system for Iamblichean theurgy through the image of the theurgist as an embodiment of divine law. According to Iamblichus, all theurgic ritual, by definition, was rooted in ancient tradition; it could not be concocted to suit one’s mood or personal desires. Theurgic rites, in fact, appear to have been traditional acts of worship practiced for centuries in the Mediterranean world. The oldest and most conservative people, the Egyptians, were seen by Iamblichus as exemplary because of their preservation of god-inspired rites that were enact-ments of their myths.</p>
<p>Iamblichus was by no means intellectually naive; he was a leading figure in the most learned circles of his time. Yet he rejected the anthropocentric “demythologizing” of Porphyry and defended the sanctity and power of the ancient rites—regardless of our ability to explain them. Nevertheless, it seems that Iamblichus did embrace an underlying paradigm for these myths and rites, a master myth outlined by Plato and the Pythagorean interpreters of his dialogues. The cosmogonic myth of the <em>Timaeus</em> demanded great intellectual skill of its interpreters, yet for Iamblichus this Platonic myth sustained a vital connection to the most primitive myths and rituals: Egyptian, Chaldean, Assyrian, and other ancient traditions of the Mediterranean. If there was a mathematical model of Iamblichean theurgy it would have been a Pythagorean schema reflecting the creative tensions of the One and the Many. These tensions, Iamblichus believed, were portrayed in the traditions of ancient and holy people, in their art, dance, sacrifice, and prayers, and would have been discovered as mathematical only after the fact of their cultural embodiment.33</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>
<p>Philo of Alexandria, faced with the same challenge as Iamblichus—to justify the practice of traditional rituals according to Platonic principles—produced very similar arguments. For Philo, although the Patriarchs lived prior to the written law they had no need of it for they were, like the noetic theurgists, “living laws” ( <em>empsu-choi nomoi</em>). See Philo, <em>De Abrahamo</em>, 4-6; Samuel Sandmel, <em>Philo of Alexandria</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 57.</p>

<p>Mathematical proportions simply outlined the intensity and valences of ritual patterns already established in nature and cult.</p>
<p>Perhaps when a theurgist ritually embodied the numbers of a tradition he could translate this vital mathematics into other traditions.</p>
<p>This may have put him “above all law” and free from the specific requirements of any tradition, yet since the theurgist became an embodiment of the law, it is more likely that he would have been subject to all traditions that preserved the divine <em>arithmoi</em>, for in them he would have recognized and experienced divine authority.</p>
<p>I believe that Pythagorean mathematics made up the <em>sunthemata</em> employed in noetic worship because they exemplify both the transcendence and immanence common to theurgic <em>sunthemata</em> and because their exercise expressed the dynamics seen in all theurgy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most suggestive confluence of mathematics and theurgy may be seen in the enigmatic warning from the Chaldean Oracles: “Do not deepen the plane” ( <em>mede bathunes to epipedon</em>).34</p>
<p>Hans Lewy explains this warning by referring to the Pythagorean theory of cosmogenesis described as the unfolding of dimensions from point to line to plane to volume, with the pyramid as the first body:35 “•”, “• •”, “ ”, “ ”; ** **i.e., the <em>tetraktus</em>: According to Lewy, the oracle warns the soul to remain in the</p>
<p>“plane,” the triad. As he explains: “The number three is in the Oracles the measure of the noetic and therefore the purport of the Oracular warning is that the mortal should not “materialize” his mental substance by extension into the realm of the somatic.”36</p>
<p>Assuming that Lewy’s analysis is correct, the question remains: How was the soul to avoid its fall into matter? How does the soul remain in the plane? The obvious response: “by not descending into volume,” may be correct, but it is insufficient and, if accepted prima facie, it would lead to a distortion of one of the central principles of theurgy.

<p>To disdain the corporeal <em>qua</em> corporeal would alienate the soul from the activity of the gods who will to reveal themselves in their geom-etrizing descent into the world.37 To avoid the body <em>tout court</em> was a gnostic or dualist answer to the oracular warning. The theurgic answer, however, not only preserved the soul in the plane while completing the volume; I would argue that it kept the soul in the plane <em>only</em> by completing the volume. An examination of this paradox should reveal how thoroughly the Pythagorean teachings influenced Iamblichus, and how, today, they may still throw light on Neoplatonic theurgy.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this study I have argued that theurgy was cosmogonic activity, a mimesis of the gods in creation. Correlate to this axiom is the view that the ascent of the soul in theurgy was realized as a cosmogonic descent, that procession and return were not opposed to one another but that the soul’s return confirmed the divinity of its procession. Strictly speaking, this means that procession and return cannot be separated, either temporally or spatially, except in discursive thought.38</p>
<p>Theurgy, however, was not a conceptual enterprise. “It is not thinking that connects theurgists to the gods . . . but ineffable acts”</p>
<p>( <em>DM</em> 96, 13–19). Therefore, only a hieratic performance was able to give the soul “the ineffable power of the gods” ( <em>he arrhetos dunamis</em> <em>ton theon</em>; <em>DM</em> 96, 19-97, 2). This <em>arrhetos dunamis</em> could not be grasped or explained, and in that sense it was irrational ( <em>alogos</em>).</p>
<p>Yet it was an <em>alogos</em> power that generated <em>logos</em>, and in this sense it bears a profound similarity to the Pythagorean solution to the</p>
<p>“scandal” of the irrational diagonal. Burkert maintains that prior to 460 b.c.e. “Pythagoreans” had discovered that the diagonal of a square with the side of “1” has an irrational value and therefore ppp</p>

<p>cannot be defined arithmetically.39 Nevertheless, it becomes defined when it is geometrically <em>performed</em>, which means that the irrational becomes rational when it functions as a generative power. In the same way, a corresponding irrational power was understood to exist in the soul,40 a power that remained ineffable until it was revealed in theurgic performance: the “ineffable acts.”</p>
<p>The supposed “irrationality” of the theurgic rite, therefore, was consistent with the mathematic solution to the problem of incommensurate lines within the “unit square” and “unit cube.”41 Like the irrational diagonal, the ineffable power of the gods was <em>alogos</em> with respect to discrete (arithmetic) reasoning yet became the source for a <em>logos</em> revealed in embodied (geometric) action.</p>
<p>Henri Joly argues that the geometric solution to the arithmetic problem of the irrational shifted the Hellenic philosophic tradition to an entirely new epistemological foundation, one that demanded an integration of <em>episteme</em> with an elevated sense of <em>techne</em>.42 In the parlance of the later Neoplatonists, this would be the <em>hieratike</em> <em>techne</em>, anterior to conceptual reflection yet capable of being performed by the soul.43 Against the background to this problem in the Pythagorean tradition, the theurgic solution to the warning of the Chaldean Oracles may support my hypothesis that noetic theurgies 39.

<p>were, indeed, mathematic rituals. In any case, the Pythagorean principles will help to explain the raison d’être of theurgic rites.</p>
<p>In the geometric unfolding of the <em>tetraktus</em>, each dimension functioned as the principle ( <em>arche</em>) and limit ( <em>peras</em>) of the dimension that it contained and of which it was the boundary ( <em>horos</em>). The</p>
<p>“point” was the limit of the “line,” the “line” was the limit of the</p>
<p>“plane,” and the “plane” was the limit of the “volume.” In each stage the limit was “outside” and therefore “contained” what it limited.</p>
<p>Damascius explains this process of dimensional unfolding in his <em>Parmenides</em> commentary:</p>
<p>The point ( <em>semeion</em>), insofar as it limits, contains; it limits the length ( <em>mekos</em>) without depth44 and contains it either from both extremes or only one, but it does not contain the whole length in itself—not entirely in itself—as a part is contained in a whole, or a figure in the limit which encloses it but as something limited is contained in a limit. <em>For the Limit is always outside what is limited</em>, as is the Unlimited, but the Unlimited is outside infinitely, while the Limit is outside only once. . . . Thus, the body ( <em>soma</em>) is within the surface ( <em>epiphania</em>), the surface is within the line ( <em>gramme</em>), and the line is within the point, but not (literally) “in” it. ( <em>Dub. et</em> <em>Sol</em>. II, 121, 13-21)</p>
<p>Damascius’s use of the terms “within” ( <em>eiso</em>) and “in” ( <em>en</em>) in the last sentence points to an important distinction between ontological containment, when subordinate entities are contained “within”</p>

<p>Now, in order for a volume to become manifest it must be limited by a plane; the plane, in turn, must be limited by a line; and the line must be limited by a point. Iamblichus says that a line should not be conceived as a “collection of many points”45 because the point <em>qua</em> point is of a different order—it is the <em>arche</em> of the line and, strictly speaking, has no dimension at all. The transition from point to line occurs only when a fundamental change takes place in the orientation of the point, to be precise: when it begins to <em>flow</em>.</p>
<p>“The geometricians,” Iamblichus says, “maintain that the line is the</p>
<p>‘flow’ ( <em>rhusis</em>) of the point.”46 To use the example of a cubic volume, the process may be exemplified as follows:</p>
<p>•</p>
<ol>
<li>The point as principle of all expres-</li>
</ol>
<p>sion. [No dimension.]</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>

<p>power in the manifestation of the</p>
<p>line. [The point <em>flows</em> into the line.]</p>
<ol start="3">

</ol>

<p>[The line <em>flows</em> into the plane.]</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>** **The plane realizes its limiting power</li>
</ol>
<p>in the manifestation of the volume.</p>
<p>[The plane <em>flows</em> into the volume.]</p>

<p>third level of descent and do not fall into a body, the volume. The theurgical solution to the warning now may be understood: the principal understanding of theurgy is that for the soul to remain a plane and free of volume it must <em>act</em> as a plane. That is to say, it must bestow limit to volume: it must descend (i.e., flow) into a body and rule it as its limit and <em>arche</em>.</p>
<p>In each successive degree of the <em>tetraktus</em> the superior dimension becomes the principle ( <em>arche</em>) of the subsequent level and manifests its specific logos in its descent. Descent in itself was not wrong so long as it was measured. After all, the genesis of the world was the result of the descent of divine powers. Therefore, from a theurgical perspective, what the Oracle warned against was not descent in itself, but an unmeasured descent. Contrasting these two notions of descent in his analysis of the <em>Laws</em> (894a) Konrad Gaiser says: To be precise, it is necessary to distinguish two different possibilities in that which concerns the passage from an anterior dimension to a posterior dimension. It is clear that one may speak of</p>
<p>“genesis” if—when a dimension is extended to pass into another—the original dimension produces its effect <em>by imposing a</em> <em>form</em>, by playing the role of a limit ( <em>peras</em>). But there exists another way, a completely different sort of movement between dimensions, which is produced following the <em>loss of the regulating limitation</em>. When a singular being is detached from the connection it had with the Superior dimension of being (its <em>eidos</em>), it loses its unifying form and is totally dissolved in the subordinate dimension. In the case of such a descent, it is no longer a matter of genesis but of the downfall of that which exists, thus, of a passage to non-being, of a “corruption” ( <em>phthora</em>).47</p>
<p>The misunderstanding of theurgy by modern scholars may be explained by these two notions of “descent.” Theurgy has too often been judged as an example of the latter kind, as a loss of rationality and corruption of the soul. In light of Iamblichus’s Pythagorean 47. Konrad Gaiser, <em>Platons Ungeschriebene Lehre</em>, 188; quoted by Remi Brague, <em>Le Restant: Supplément aux commentaires du Ménon de Platon</em> (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1978), 101. Brague discusses this principle at some length in his chapter 4, 100–105.</p>

</ul>
<p>principles, however, theurgy was the means for the soul to participate in “genesis” at the highest possible level.</p>
<p>In the cosmos conceived by Iamblichus one acted with the Demiurge or against him. The theurgist, of course, did the former. He embraced the Unlimited ( <em>to apeiron</em>) in his descent/embodiment by assuming the role of the Limit ( <em>to peras</em>). If he avoided this responsibility he forfeited his role as Limit and was condemned to an inferior dimension and the ignominy of having limits imposed on him by others: that is, by daimons who preserve the orders of genesis. In short, only by flowing into <em>apeiron</em> could the theurgist remain <em>peras</em>.</p>
<p>Only by measuring himself into matter could he participate directly in the immaterial forms. If, as the Platonists maintained,48 “god is always doing geometry” ( <em>aei geometrei ho theos</em>), then the theurgists were his instruments.</p>
