*— * The Chaldean Oracles

he two kinds of descent outlined in the previous chapter may help shed light on Iamblichus’s distinction in the *De Anima* Tbetween souls who voluntarily and involuntarily enter bodies. Iamblichus subdivided the former group into souls who were \(a\) already free and entered the corporeal realm to preserve it and \(b\) those who were imperfect but were working toward perfection \( *Stob*. I, 380, 6–14\). The descent of this latter type of soul was neither entirely a corruption nor a creative participation in genesis though it was moving toward the latter. The great majority of souls, however, were embodied involuntarily and were completely verged toward *to apeiron*. Nevertheless, in Iamblichus’s estimation, even these souls could participate in cosmogenesis if they limited their passions with material theurgies. The material rites laid the foundation for the soul’s final exchange of a life shaped by the *perata* of daimons, for a life bestowing *peras* upon *apeiron*, like the gods. The divinity appropriate to the soul guided each rite, and as the soul became increasingly aligned with cosmogonic measures, so did its awareness of the gods.

The most marked transition in the progress of the soul was the rare moment that it received a god as a guardian to replace its personal \( *oikeios*\) daimon \( *DM* 280, 17–281, 1\). In book IX of the *De* *Mysteriis* Iamblichus describes this transition in response to Porphyry’s question about discerning the “Lord of one’s nativity” \( *DM*

278, 15–19\). While Iamblichus did not reject the validity of *mathematike* \(i.e., the “calculation” of astrological nativities\) as a divine science, he said that it had been distorted by mortal conceptions 242

*The Sunthe*

*The Sunthema of*

*ma o the Su*

* the S n*

\( *DM* 277, 14–18\). Iamblichus explained that one’s guardian daimon cannot be determined simply by finding the “Lord of the geniture”1

for the guardian is distributed to the soul through all aspects of its astrological portrait \( *DM* 280, 2–6\). Iamblichus maintained that the soul’s daimon was “more ancient” than the nativity and therefore could not be discovered by astrological calculations or identified with a particular section of the heavens. He says:

If we must to reveal to you the truth concerning one’s personal *Daimon* we must say that he is not distributed to us from one part of the heavens nor from any of the visible planets but from the entire cosmos—its multi-faceted life and its multi-form body—

through which the soul descends into generation. And a certain individual allotment is imparted to us, allotted to each of our aspects, according to an individual jurisdiction.2 This *Daimon*, therefore, is established in the paradigm even before souls descend into generation. And when the soul selects him as its leader the *Daimon* immediately attends to his task of fulfilling the lives of the soul, and he binds the soul to the body when it descends. \( *DM*

280, 1–13\)

The ruling daimon mixed the soul’s immortal *logoi* with the mortal lives received from the body in order to meet the particular demands of its incarnation.3 The daimon served as coordinator of the soul’s descent into the material world.

The task of each soul was to align itself and its activities with its 1. *DM* 278, 16. Astrology describes the “ruler” as follows: “The Lord of the Geniture would be precisely termed the Ruler of the Figure meaning that planet having the most dignities, either Essential \[i.e., being situated in a sign amicable to its properties\] or Accidental \[i.e., in positive relation to other planets\].” Nicholas Devore, *Encyclopedia of Astrology* \(New York: Philosophical Library, 1947\), 246.

Usually the planet on the ascendant of one’s horoscope—if it is well-aspected—

would be considered the “ruler” of one’s nativity. Thus, if the sign Leo is on the eastern horizon at one’s birth then the planet associated with it, the sun, if well-aspected, would be considered the Lord of one’s nativity. If Sagittarius were ascending then a well-aspected Jupiter would be one’s “Lord,” etc.

2. This is the process of the soul’s “taking on attributes” \( *prostheke*\) in its descent into the physical cosmos.

3. See Iamblichus’s description of the soul’s descent in Simplicius, *In Aristotelis* *Categorias Commentarium* ed. C. Kalbfleisch \(Berlin: Reimeri, 1907\), 374, 31–34.

243

*Theurgy and the Soul*

ruling god, and when this was achieved the guardian daimon gave way to a higher guide. Iamblichus continues:

\[T\]he *Daimon* oversees the composite life of the soul \[and body\]

and the individual life of the soul; and all that we think, we conceive due to the principles he has implanted in us. We do the things that he suggests to our mind, and he continues to govern human beings until, by means of sacred theurgy, the time comes that we are entrusted with a God as guardian and leader of the soul. For then the *Daimon* either yields to the superior entity or hands over his jurisdiction to him or subjoins himself to him as a co-collaborator or in some other way ministers to him as to his Lord. \( *DM* 280, 13–281, 4\)

This was a privilege reserved for very few souls. The great majority were best served simply by fulfilling the dictates of their guardian daimons.4 It should be noted that despite Iamblichus’s occasional references to “evil” daimons, there was no evil daimon competing for control of the soul. Iamblichus explicitly states that the soul has only one ruling daimon and that he is good \( *DM* 282, 1–5\). To fulfill the charges of its guardian, however, the soul first had to recognize him and then develop a rapport. Recognition of the daimon was not gained by artificial means or human effort but was given directly and theurgically by the Lord of daimons \( *DM* 283, 18–19\).

Iamblichus says:

The invocation of these guardian *Daimones* is effected through their one ruler God who, from the beginning, distributed individual *Daimones* to every soul, and in the sacred rites he reveals the individual *Daimon* to each soul according to his own will. For, in the theurgic hierarchy, subordinate entities are always invoked by their superiors. Consequently, in the case of *Daimones*, one universal leader of those who are charged to rule over generation dis-patches individual *Daimons* to every entity. And, when the familiar *Daimon* appears to each soul, then he reveals his particular mode of worship as well as his name, and he also teaches the particular manner of invoking him. \( *DM* 283, 19–284, 10\) 4. This is a standard Platonic teaching. In the *Timaeus* 90a–c Plato says that only by constantly “worshiping” the daimon who dwells with us can man partake of immortality.

244

*The Sunthe*

*The Sunthema of*

*ma o the Su*

* the S n*

In each embodiment, the daimon acted on behalf of the god until its “limits” \( *ta perata*\) had been realized by the soul. The soul’s freedom from the daimon—like its freedom from the “law”—was determined, paradoxically, by its degree of identity with it. The daimon was not left behind but was, as it were, digested and incorporated by the theurgist. In addition, insofar as daimons served a processional and dividing function in cosmology, the graduation to a god as overseer indicated that the soul was no longer identified with a “particular” self. When the soul became resonant with the ratios of the World Soul, it began to live for the entire world, and since daimons had jurisdiction over parts, not wholes, the soul then received a god for its leader.

The personal daimon revealed himself to the theurgist and taught him how to stay in contact, but to recognize one’s daimon demanded an ability to discriminate among the appearances \( *phasmata*\) of invisible entities. In book II, chapters 3–9 of the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus provides a diagnostic guide of the entities that appear in theurgic worship. Porphyry had asked how theurgists were able to distinguish among gods, archangels, angels, daimons, archons, and souls \( *DM* 70, 10–82\), and Iamblichus provided an exhaustive answer. He distinguished among the appearances of \(1\) gods, \(2\) archangels, \(3\) angels, \(4\) daimons, \(5\) heroes, \(6\) sublunary archons, \(7\) material archons, and \(8\) souls according to the *ousia*, *dunamis*, and *energeia* of each class. Iamblichus examined twenty different visionary qualities whose manifestations were diminished in each succeeding ontological class. Examining first the “uniformity” of appearances, then their “beneficence,” “immutability,”

“beauty,” etc., Iamblichus concluded with a discussion of the “benefits” provided to souls by each class. H.D. Saffrey provides an excellent outline of these chapters,5 and Friedrich Cremer has covered the same ground to demonstrate the influence of the Chaldean Oracles.6

245

*Theurgy and the Soul*

Following the Iamblichean principle that *energeia* reveals *ousia*, the appearances of invisible entities were the *energeiai* that revealed their sources, the *ousiai*. In terms of human experience, however, the rank of the divinity that appeared depended on the soul’s receptive capacity \(the *epitedeiotes* discussed in Chapter 7\). Iamblichus, in fact, seems to suggest that the soul actually contributed something to the appearance of the deity. Speaking of the “benefits”

\( *dora*\) that come to souls from the appearance of a god, he says:

\[T\]he presence of the Gods gives us health of body, virtue of soul and purity of mind. In short, it elevates everything in us to its proper principle. It annihilates what is cold and destructive in us, *it increases our heat* and causes it to become more powerful and dominant. It makes everything in the soul consonant with the Nous; it causes a light to shine with intelligible harmony, and it reveals the incorporeal as corporeal to the eyes of the soul by means of the eyes of the body.7

Iamblichus’s reference to corporeal vision as the means to see the incorporeal points to imagination as the medium of theophanies.

By means of images the “eyes of the soul” \( *hoi tes psuches ophthal-moi*\) clothed the gods in an interior space. Clearly, a contribution on the part of the soul was necessary to reveal what was invisible, and Proclus explains that it was the soul’s “body of light” \( *augoeides* *soma*\). He says:

The Gods themselves are incorporeal, but since those who see them possess bodies, the visions which issue from the Gods to worthy recipients possess a certain quality from the Gods who send them but also have something connatural \( *sungenes*\) with those who see them. This is why the Gods are seen yet not seen at all. *In fact, those who see the Gods witness them in the luminous gar-ments of their souls* \( *augoeide ton psuchon periblemata*\). The point is, they are often seen when the eyes are shut. Therefore, since the visions are extended and appear in this different kind of “atmosphere” they are connatural with those who see them. However, 7. *DM* 81, 13-82, 2; cf. Proclus’s “Fire-Song,” lines 8–9, discussed by Lewy, *Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy*, ed. M. Tardieu \(Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1978\), 491–93.

246

*The Sunthe*

*The Sunthema of*

* the S n*

because visions emit divine light, possess effectiveness, and portray the powers of the Gods through their visible symbols, they remain in contact with the Gods who send them. This is why the ineffable symbols of the Gods are expressed in images and are projected sometimes in one form, sometimes in another. \( *In Remp*. I, 39, 5–17\)

In summary, Proclus adds:

Each God is formless \( *amorphotos*\) even if he is seen with a form.

For the form is not in him but comes from him due to the incapacity of the viewer to see the formless without a form; rather, according to his nature he sees by means of forms.8

The psychic organ that received the divine light was the pneumatic or luminous body. In his treatise *On Dreams* \( *De Insomniis*\) Synesius identified this body with the “imagination” \( *to phantastikon*; 136a, 1\) and described it as the soul’s “first vehicle” \( *to proton* *ochema*; 137a, 2\). It was within this imaginal body that the soul experienced its most profound illuminations. The imaginal body, however, should not be confused with ordinary imagination. Iamblichus distinguished not only the “god-sent” dreams from the

“human” \( *DM* 103, 2–10\) but also the “divine appearances” given by the gods from the images concocted by man.9 The former possessed transformative power while the latter were merely reflections of embodied life. Just as the horizontal expressions of *sunthemata* were distinguished from their vertical or divine dimension, so with the imagination. On the horizontal level *phantasia* was merely the play of the discursive mind, but if properly purified and trained, the vertical dimension that sustained it could be awakened. The imaginal body of the ordinary person, however, was “diseased” \(Synesius, *De* *Insomniis*, 136d, 1\) and until purified it could not serve as a vehicle for the god.

9. The *phasmata* of *DM*, book II, chaps. 3–9, are divine as are the visions described in *DM* 132, 11–15, but human imaginations are rejected as being nontheurgical \(see *DM* 287, 1–3\).

247

*Theurgy and the Soul*

In reply to Porphyry’s questions about lights seen in divination Iamblichus explains the role of *phantasia* and catalogues, under the rubric of *photagogia*, the various methods used to illuminate it. He explains:

The entire kind of divination that you describe, while of many kinds, is contained in a single power which may be called “drawing in the light” \( *photos agoge*\). This power illuminates with divine light the aetherial and luminous vehicle surrounding the soul, from which divine visions \( *phantasiai theiai*\) take possession of our imaginative faculty being moved by the will of the Gods. For the entire life of the soul and all its powers, when directed by the Gods, are moved however the Lords of the soul wish.

And this occurs in two ways, either when the Gods are present with the soul, or when they shine into the soul a certain advance light coming from themselves. In each case, the divine presence or the illumination, they are transcendent \[to the soul\]. The attention and discursive power of the soul follow what takes place \[cf.

*DM* 104, 11\] since the divine light does not touch them, but the imaginative faculty \( *to phantastikon*\) is divinely inspired because it is lifted into modes of imagination that come from the Gods, not from itself, and it is utterly removed from what is ordinarily human.10

The Neoplatonic doctrine of the imaginal body and its role in theurgic ascent exemplifies what Mircea Eliade has called a “mystical physiology.” In his well-known study on yoga Eliade explains that the descriptions of such “physiologies” are “not conceptualizations, but images expressing transmundane experiences.”11 It is in this sense that Iamblichus’s doctrine of the soul’s pneumatic or aetherial body must be understood, for he used physiological terms to describe experiences that transcend the physical realm. In effect, Iamblichus used “the eyes of the body” to awaken “the eyes of the soul.”

10. *DM* 132, 9–133, 9. Compare this mode of divination with that described at *DM* 117, 1–9 where the discursive mind is unaware of what takes place. In both cases, the cause for the divine inspiration is “the lights which come down from the Gods” \( *DM* 117, 2\).

The similarities between the doctrines of the subtle body in later Neoplatonism and the yoga traditions are suggestive, particularly with respect to the role of “heat” as it relates to “breath” and the

“channels” of the soul’s mystical body in yogic and theurgic practices.12 Iamblichus says the presence of the god heats the soul and effects a visual theophany. The divine heating occurred within the soul’s “mystical” body, yet the fact that this body was called pneumatic \( *pneumatikos*\), as well as aetheric \( *aitherodes*\) and luminous \( *augoeides*; *DM* 239, 9–11\) suggests that physical breath \( *pneuma*\) played a role in this heating and incandescence. Breath may have been the means through which the soul was translated to its mystical body and, once established there, homologized to the cosmos and Creator. Evidence from the *Chaldean Oracles* supports this. In fragment 130, the soul established in god is said to “breathe in the flowering flames that descend from the Father,”13 and fragment 124

speaks of liberated souls who are “thrust out” \[of their bodies\]

\( *exosteres*\) by “inhaling” \( *anapnooi*; trans. Majercik, 97\). Psellus explains that this was not effected by the soul but by divine powers who “cause the soul to breathe far from the weariness and oppression of the body.”14 It is possible that Iamblichus’s legendary ability to levitate in prayer15 had its origins in these breathing techniques and that the story of his “levitation” \(which he laughed off\),16 may 12. A careful comparison cannot be developed here except to point to the terms and their functions in the respective spiritual practices. “Heat” \( *tapas*/yoga : *ther-mon*/theurgy\) is awakened by, or directly related to, the “breath” \( *prana*/yoga : *pneuma*/theurgy\). When sufficiently heated, it flows up the “channels” \( *nadis*/yoga : *ochetai*/theurgy\) of the mystical body to divinize the soul. It may be possible also to compare the fiery goddess Hecate, invoked by theurgists, with the goddess Kundalini, invoked by yogins, since both were responsible for the salvation or punishment of souls depending on their purity and preparation for the encounter.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

have derived from a misinterpretation of the phenomenon that occurred when the theurgist coordinated his breath and visualization. For example, the Mithras Liturgy states: “Draw in breath from the \[sun’s\] rays, drawing in three times as much as you can, and *you* *will see yourself lifted up* and ascending to the height so that you seem to be in midair.”17

The key to these pneumatic exercises was the belief that the soul’s aetheric body was directly connected with the sun, the source of light. It should be borne in mind that the radiance of this body was related, not only to the physical sun, but also to its hidden source.

Plato’s reference to the sun as the image of the Good in the *Republic* \(509b, 2–10\) profoundly influenced the Neoplatonists who saw the physical sun as revealer of the divine *Nous*. In a cosmology where nature was seen as a theophany of the gods it would be inconsistent if the sun did not play a central role in soteriological rites. Julian says that Helios was surrounded by the “fifth body” \( *pempton* *soma*\) with its summit being the rays of the sun,18 and Iamblichus identified this “fifth body” with aether \( *TA*, 34, 13\), the same aether that made up the soul’s subtle body. Thus, through its aetheric vehicle the embodied soul participated in the aetheric body of the sun in varying degrees of intensity. According to the *Chaldean Oracles* the leader god of each soul was identified with one of the solar rays, and fragment 110 says that the soul must discover its “ray”

\( *ochetos*\) and perform the proper ritual in order to make its ascent.

Fragment 123 says that the soul is relieved by *heated breath*, pointing again to the connection of breath and the sun. In the *De Anima* Iamblichus says that according to the Ancients \(i.e., theurgists\), souls are purified by all the visible gods “and of them all most especially by the sun.”19

The connections between light, fire, the pneumatic body, and physical breath were also described in the *De Mysteriis* where Iam-17. *The Mithras Liturgy* \(PGM IV, 538–41\), trans.

blichus measures the degrees of divine light by their effects on breath. He says:

Indeed, with respect to the subtlety of light, the Gods irradiate it to such a fine degree that the eyes of the body cannot receive it, and *they undergo the same experience as fish when they are lifted up* *out of turbid and thick fluid into subtle and diaphanous air*. In fact, those who contemplate the divine fire are not able to inhale the subtlety of it; *they appear to fall into a swoon, to all appearances,* *and are cut off from their natural breath*. \( *DM* 86, 5–14\) This passage suggests some form of trance in which the theurgist’s breath was completely stopped. Such phenomena are not uncommon in yogic practices and Iamblichus may be describing the theurgic equivalent of yogic *turiya*, a “cateleptic” condition where the breath appears to stop.20 On the other hand, Iamblichus may simply be pointing out that when the human soul entered the subtlety of divine light it began to breathe, in Psellus’s terms, “far from the weariness and oppression of the body” \( *PG* 1144c, 8–9\). To

“breathe,” that is to say, to “live” with the gods, the soul could not continue to breath/live in an ordinary way. One could “inhale the sun’s rays” only with an *augoeides soma*, a solar body. Iamblichus adds that the light emitted by the archangels was also too rarefied for the soul to inhale but notes that the presence of angels produced a mixture of air that theurgists were capable of breathing \( *DM* 86, 13–18\). Since Iamblichus believed that human souls were able to live no higher than the rank of angels \( *DM* 69, 12–14\), perhaps this passage simply reiterates that position, employing “breath” as the index of the soul’s “life.”

Iamblichus’s description of the soul’s inability to endure the atmosphere of the gods is also reminiscent of Plato’s *Phaedo*. There, Socrates tells Simmias that humanity lives in the “hollows of the earth,” the “dregs of the starry aether,” unable or unwilling to emerge to the true surface of the world \(109c\):

We are too feeble and sluggish to make our way out to the upper limit of the air. If someone could reach to the summit, or put on 20. Eliade, *Yoga*, 57.

251

*Theurgy and the Soul*

wings and fly aloft, when he put up his head he would see the world above, *just as fishes see our world when they put their heads* *out of the sea*. And if his nature were able to bear the sight, he would recognize that that is the true heaven and the true light and the true earth. \(109c\)

For Platonists the mythic geography of the *Phaedo* was a map of the soul. It was possible for the soul to live in resonance with divine ratios, suspended in perfect equilibrium \(109c\) on a “true earth”

\(110b, 5\) “as pure as the starry heavens in which it lies” \(109b, 9\); or the soul might live in the “dregs of that aether” \(109c, 2\), in anatropic dissonance, alternately attracted and repelled by the flux and reflux of sensible matter.

The theurgist emerged from this perversity and heaviness to behold the true heaven, true light, and true earth and live in direct contact with the divine causes. He achieved this condition by means of *sunthemata* that purified his luminous body and translated him to the divine. Since the luminous vehicle \( *augoeides ochema*\) was solar in origin, when it was purified it returned to the sun. Damascius explains that the theurgist was made divine “when the radiant vehicle journeys upward to the sun * *. . . when we are established in the soul of the sun” \( *Dub. et Sol*. II, 255, 17–18\).

It is almost certain that the cultic expression of theurgy centered on the worship of the sun. Julian says that his devotion to Helios was perfected through the teachings of Iamblichus, and his *Hymn to* *the Mother of the Gods* 21 testifies to the importance of the sun in the apotheosis of the human soul. The drama of Attis was the drama of the human soul in its descent into generation. Like human souls, Attis was the lowest of divine beings, and although he was “as pure as the Milky Way” \(171a\) he was troubled by passion when he joined with matter. Like human souls, Attis entered the generated world

“following the will of the gods” \(171b\), but this obedience came at the cost of his equanimity. The descent, in other words, was a sacrifice willed by the gods and performed by Attis, and his subsequent

“castration” symbolized the completion of his mission. In meta-21. Julian, *Oration V: Hymn to the Mother of the Gods*, trans. W.C. Wright, in *Works*, 1:439–503.

252

*The Sunthe*

*The Sunthema of*

* the S n*

physical terms, the castration of Attis represented the limiting of the soul’s unlimited propensity, the bestowal of *peras* upon *apeiron*, which is the act of demiurgy and theurgy par excellence. The apotheosis of Attis, significantly, was effected by Helios. Julian says:

“After bringing a halt to his unlimited procession, Attis brought this chaos into order through his sympathy with the cycle of the equi-nox since the great *Helios* controls the most perfect measure of his motion within due limits” \(171c\). The myth portrayed this demiurgy as an ongoing activity, for the cycle of Attis did not happen in the past, nor was it ever finished. Thus, Julian says: “And never did this happen, except in the manner that it happens *now* . . . for Attis *always* yearns for generation, and he is *always* cutting short the unlimited through the limited cause of the Forms” \(171d\).

The role of souls as suggested in the myth of Attis was demiurgic, but once embodied—and souls were *always* entering bodies—their divine measures had to be received from without. The sun, therefore, was the initiator in the recollection and return of souls. In his manifestation as physical light and chief among encosmic gods Helios served as administrator for the cult of “material” souls, yet in his noetic expression Helios’s invisible rays defined the mathematic ratios invoked in the cult of noetic souls.22 “\[For\] *Helios*,” say the Pythagoreans, “is the great geometer and arithmetician.”23 Julian explains the role of the sun as follows:

Consider this clearly: *Helios*, by his vivifying and marvelous heat, draws up all things from the earth and calls them forth and makes them grow, separating, I believe, corporeal things to their highest degree of tenuity, and he makes things light that naturally would sink. These things should be taken as sure signs of his unseen powers. For if among corporeal things he can effect this through his corporeal heat, how would he not draw and lead upwards the souls of the blessed by means of the invisible, wholly incorporeal, and divinely pure essence established in his rays? \(172b\) 22. Cf. *Epinomis* 977ab. For a discussion of the cult of the sun in the Platonic tradition see H.D. Saffrey, “La Dévotion de Proclus au Soleil,” *Institut de Philosophie* \( *et Science Morale*\) *Annales* \(Brussels, 1984\): 73–86.

253

*Theurgy and the Soul*

For Julian the worship of Helios was a theurgical mystery. He continues:

If I should also touch on the ineffable mystagogy \( *he arrhete myst-agogia*\) which the Chaldean, divinely frenzied, celebrated to the God of the Seven Rays—he who lifts up the souls of men through himself—I would be describing unknowable things, indeed, entirely unknowable for the vulgar, but quite familiar to the blessed theurgists. \(172d–173a\)

Julian’s religiosity should not be taken as a sure index of Iamblichus’s views; certainly not with the same confidence that one may draw from Proclus, Simplicius, or Damascius.24 Nevertheless, the role of the sun, or rather, the *sunthema* of the sun, as symbol of the noetic fire and Demiurge, was almost certainly the central mystery of Neoplatonic theurgy. Proclus worshiped the sun three times a day, at rising, noon, and setting.25 In his *Timaeus* commentary he spoke of the demiurgic powers of the hidden sun described in the Oracles: “The truer sun measures the All together with Time, truly being . . . ‘Time of Time’”26 and in his *Parmenides* commentary he says: “\[The sun is\] the analogue of the One, established in it secretly and inseparably” \(1045, 6–9\).

In the later Roman Empire the sun became increasingly important not only as a god appropriated for the emperor cult but also in the most spiritual worship. Tractate XIII of the *Corpus Hermeticum* suggests that the sun played a key role in the highest mysteries, and the Hermetic apotheosis exemplifies several theurgic characteristics. Tat, the disciple of Hermes, learned to “regenerate” his soul and complete the *tetraktus* of intelligent generation \(i.e., the “measured descent” described in Chapter 19\). At this point, Hermes tells him: ppp

24. There was understandably a greater tendency to dogmatism and theological uniformity in the Neoplatonism of a political figure like Julian than in spiritual teachers like Iamblichus and Proclus. For an excellent discussion of this issue see A.H. Armstrong, “The Way and the Ways: Religious Tolerance and Intolerance in the Fourth Century a.d.,” *Vigiliae Christianae* 38 \(1984\); esp. 6.

“You now know, my child, the way of regeneration. When the Decad comes into being, my child, your spiritual birth has been established” \( *CH* X, 10; 204, 21–24\). Tat replies: Being stabilized by the God, O Father, I visualize for myself, *not* *with the vision of the eyes but through the Powers, in intelligible* *activity*. I am in heaven, in earth, in water, in air. I am in animals, in plants, in the womb, before the womb, after the womb, everywhere\! \( *CH* XIII, 11; 205, 3–7\)

Hermes explains to Tat that by completing the decad he has entered into contact with the One since “the Decad is in the One, and the One is in the Decad” \( *CH* XIII, 12\). The decad was the Pythagorean symbol of the actualized *tetraktus*, the manifestation of all principles in the cosmos. Having been reborn into this “body,” Tat sees himself in all things, an experience amenable to a theurgical interpretation for, according to Iamblichus, the soul may return to the One only if it has been homologized to the All. The soul must first

“see itself in all things” before it enters the immortal body measured by the gods. At the culmination of his ascent Tat asks for the final mystery and Hermes, significantly, does not explain it—the divine powers perform the mystery *through* him. They sing a mystery oriented to the sun. Hermes instructs Tat to “bow down at the setting and rising of the sun” \( *CH* XIII, 16, 207, 11–12\) and sing a hymn to the “intelligible light” \( *to noeton phos*; *CH* XIII, 18, 208, 5\) to celebrate the union of the will of the soul with the will of the Demiurge.

Hermes sings to the Creator: “The Powers that are in me sing these things; they chant out the universe. They complete your will, your plan as it proceeds from you and returns to you as the \[completed\]

universe. Receive from all existing things the spiritual sacrifice” \( *CH*

XIII, 19, 208, 13–16\).

Whether or not the authors of this Hermetic tractate formed part of a “theurgic” community, or any community at all is a question that will not be addressed, yet the motifs involved—\(1\) Pythagorean mysticism; \(2\) homologization to the cosmos as a means of release; \(3\) participation in demiurgy; and \(4\) the central role of the sun in the ritual act—were all characteristics of theurgy as conceived by Iamblichus. The evidence suggests that theurgic mysteries were 255

solar mysteries, for the goal of all *mantike* and theurgic ritual was

“the ascent to the intelligible Fire” \( *DM* 179, 9–12\) and theurgists, Iamblichus says, “are true athletes of the Fire” \( *DM* 92, 13–14\).
