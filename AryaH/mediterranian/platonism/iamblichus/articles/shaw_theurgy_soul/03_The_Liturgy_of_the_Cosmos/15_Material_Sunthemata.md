Immaterial beings are present in

material natures immaterially.

Iamblichus used the terms sunthema, sumbolon, and semeia, to describe respectively the theurgic “token,” “symbol,” or “sign” that divinized the soul. Iamblichus’s use of the term sunthema probably derived from the Chaldean Oracles where it was synonymous with sumbolon. In fragment 108 of the Oracles, the sumbola are said to be “sown . . . throughout the cosmos” by the Paternal Demiurge,1 and Ruth Majercik explains that these symbols “can be equated with the Platonic Forms” \( CO, 182\). The sunthemata of the Oracles had a cosmogonic role like the Forms of Middle Platonism.

Both functioned as dynamic powers enforming the cosmos, and both were considered the “thoughts of the Father.”2 From Oracle fragments 2 and 109 it is clear that the sunthemata were also anagogic, for when the soul “remembers the pure, paternal token \( sunthema\),” it returned to the paternal Nous.3 In the Chaldean system and the De Mysteriis the sunthemata were distributed simultaneously into the cosmos and into every soul by the Demiurge.

Iamblichus discussed sunthemata in a cosmogonic context three 1. CO, frag. 108, p. 91.

2. For the Middle Platonic interpretation of the Forms as the “thoughts” of the Demiurge see Philo, De opif. 4, 17–20; 44, 129–130; cf. Albinus, Didasc. 9, 1–2. Also, see the discussion by John Dillon, The Middle Platonists \(London: Duckworth, 1977\), 55.

3. CO, Frag. 109, 91. Frag. 2 states to reach the Intelligible “you must cast into your imagination the entire token \( sunthema\) of the triad” \(49\). See Majercik’s commentary, 141.

times in the De Mysteriis. In DM 65–66 Iamblichus says that each theurgic rite engaged the “eternal measures” \( metra . . . aidia\) and

“wondrous deposits” \( enthemata thaumasta\) sent by the Demiurge to our world \( DM 65, 6–8\), and through them “the inexpressible is expressed through ineffable symbols” \( DM 65, 8–9\). This describes a cosmogonic and hieratic function of sunthemata. In an explanation of augury Iamblichus makes the hieratic and cosmogonic connection even more explicit. He says that the gods use the cosmogonic power of daimons to reveal their will through natural signs \( DM 135, 8–10\). He explains:

The Gods produce signs \( semeia\) by means of nature which serves them in the work of generation, nature as a whole and individual natures specifically, or by means of the generative Daimones who, presiding over the elements of the cosmos, particular bodies, animals, and everything in the world, easily produce the phenomena in whatever way seems good to the Gods. They reveal the inten-tions of the God symbolically \( sumbolikos\) \( DM 135, 14–136, 3\) Quoting Heraclitus, Iamblichus says this is the oracular mode: “neither speaking, nor concealing, but signifying” \( DM 136, 4–5\) and suggests that this was also the cosmogonic mode. He continues:

“Therefore, just as the Gods create all things by means of images and signify all things in the same way through sunthemata, in the same way the Gods stir up our understanding to a greater sharpness by the same means” \( DM 136, 6–10\).

Finally, Iamblichus says the Egyptians imitated the nature of the universe and the creation of the gods through their use of noetic images \( eikones\) \( DM 249, 14–250, 7\). For Iamblichus, the Egyptian cult served as a model for theurgy because of its imitation of cosmogenesis. The hieroglyphic symbols were images of creative powers, the same powers that effected the soul’s return to the gods. The eikones of the Egyptian cult, like the sunthemata of theurgy, performed a cosmogonic function. Iamblichus uses the verb “to impress” \( apotupein\) to describe Egyptian cosmogenesis,4 following 4. At DM 65, 10, to reveal the Forms in images; at 135, 5, to stamp out the character of the Demiurge; and again at 250, 5, to reveal the Forms in images.

Plato, who says the Demiurge perfected the world by “impressing \( apotupoumenos\) living creatures according to the nature of the paradigm” \( Tim. 39e, 6–7\). For Iamblichus the living eikones impressed by the Demiurge were simultaneously cosmogonic and anagogic.

The sunthemata and sumbola of theurgy functioned in a manner similar to Plato’s Forms in that both revealed the divine order.

According to Plato, however, only the Form of Beauty is sensibly revealed, and therefore it is Beauty that instigates man’s anamnesis of the gods \( Phaedrus 250, b–d\). Significantly, in Proclus’s theory of prayer, where he purports to explain the view of Iamblichus \( In Tim. I, 209, 11\), sunthemata are described as the material causes \( hulikai aitiai; In Tim. I, 213, 16\) \[of prayer\], implanted in the essences of souls by the Demiurge for their recollection \( anamnesis\) of the Gods who made them and of other

\[divine\] things. \( In Tim. I, 213, 16–18\)

Common to Beauty and to theurgic sunthemata was the eros that initiated the soul’s divinization. In Chapter 13, I suggested that the eromenoi of the Symposium and the sunthemata of theurgy were functionally equivalent. Both revealed divinity to the soul at its level of attraction, and both initiated its ascent to the gods. If sunthemata may be equated with the Forms of Plato, they should especially be associated with the Form of Beauty for, like Beauty, sunthemata were revealed to the senses and through the sanctification of the senses the sunthemata—like expressions of Beauty—gradually led the soul back to the highest level as the soul elevated its eros for the Good.

Posing the question of what relation theurgic sunthemata have to the Platonic Forms, Andrew Smith acknowledges their similarity but distinguishes the sunthemata and sumbola by noting that they

“perfect the cosmos rather than simply enform it.”5 Smith explains that for Proclus the sunthemata tend to express more the anagogic 5. Smith cites Proclus In Tim. I, 161, 10; see Smith, Porphyry’s Place in the Neoplatonic Tradition: A Study in Post-Plotinian Neoplatonism \(The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1974\), 107 n.11.

than emanative power of the Forms, and he says this distinction is also present in the De Mysteriis where Iamblichus asserts the “analogy” but not identity between the sunthemata and the Forms \( Porphyry’s Place, 107 n. 11\).

Smith’s distinction is correct, yet it may be developed further.

Since Iamblichus asserts that questions may be discussed in a philosophical, theological, or theurgical manner, it is possible to see the cosmological description of the Forms as proper to a philosophic discourse while an anagogic description would stress the theurgic function of the Forms as sunthemata. In other words, although every soul was created by the Demiurge with “harmonic ratios”

\( logoi harmonikoi\) \( In Tim. I, 4, 32\), and “divine symbols” \( sumbola theia; In Tim. I, 4, 32–33\), the former were active in all souls by virtue of cosmogenesis while the latter remained inactive until awakened in theurgy. Thus, when the logoi that constitute the soul’s essence were ritually appropriated and awakened in the life of the soul, these logoi could then be called sumbola or sunthemata.

Friedrich Cremer argues that theurgic sunthemata were charged with demiurgic will, and he contends that Iamblichus’s source for this understanding was the Chaldean Oracles.6 Cremer’s first point is indisputable, but I believe he exaggerates Iamblichus’s dependence on the Oracles for this teaching. The notion of the “beneficent \( aphthonos\) will” of the Demiurge was already described by Plato in the Timaeus \(29e\) as the primary cause for creation. This was a Platonic topos and had been developed by Middle Platonists in their description of the Forms as the “thoughts” of the Father. In the hieratic discourse of the Oracles these “thoughts” were translated into sunthemata and sumbola, charged with divine will. Iamblichus says that despite the variety of these symbols the Demiurge contains them all undividedly: “he contains the signs within himself, has comprehended them in unity, and creates them from himself according to one will” \( DM 141, 11–13\).

If the generosity of the Platonic Demiurge was the cause for creation, it follows that this will was immanent throughout his 6. Cremer, Die Chaldaïschen Orakel und Jamblich de Mysteriis \(Meisenheim am Glan: Anton Hain, 1969\), 106–11.

creation. As Proclus put it, the world was contained within his will \(cf. In Tim. I, 209, 13–210, 4\). When the Platonic Forms were transformed by Middle Platonists into the “thoughts” of the Creator and these, in turn, were understood to be “powers” extending into the cosmos, it was perhaps inevitable that these demiurgic powers would be “discovered” in their manifest expressions and adapted in some manner to benefit embodied souls. Theurgy and the doctrine of divine sunthemata was the practical culmination of this development, and it is one that Iamblichus believed to be entirely Platonic.

The hieratic function of sunthemata in the noetic, material, and intermediate realms reinforced the connection between the highest and lowest levels and communicated the demiurgic will to every part of the world where the soul was bound. Iamblichus says: “The abundance of power of the highest beings has the nature always to transcend everything in this world, and yet this power is immanent in everything equally without impediment. According to this principle, therefore, first beings illuminate the last, and immaterial beings are present in material natures, immaterially” \( DM 232, 11–

16\). In his explanation of prayer Proclus repeats this principle almost verbatim. He says that although the procession from the gods is carefully graded, the gods contain everything “directly”

\( autothen; In Tim. I, 209, 17–18\): “for the divine is separate from nothing, but is present equally \( ex isou\) to all” \( In Tim. I, 209, 19–

20\). Hieratic Neoplatonists believed that sunthemata had a twofold function. They remained “equally” \( ex isou\) in the gods because they were all “vertically” rooted in their causal power, yet each also had a “horizontal” identity in its respective order in the cosmos \( In Tim. I, 210, 12–20\). Since each god had a specific cosmic function, its sunthemata bore its identifying marks in their respective \(horizontal\) realms of expression and possessed a special intimacy with others marked by the same god.

In On the Hieratic Art Proclus explains that the relationship between the sunthemata tied to the same deity was not based on natural power but on the degree of participation in their ruling god.

For example, in the case of lions and cocks, which are both solar animals, Proclus says:

187

Theurgy and the Soul

Indeed, it is amazing how things that are lesser in natural power and size are fearful to those greater than them in both attributes.

For they say the lion draws back from the cock. The cause for this may not be grasped from the physical senses but from intuitive observation and from the differences among the causes. For the symbol of solar qualities is certainly more actively present in the cock \[than in the lion\].7

The “things below,” Iamblichus says, are connected to “divine causes,” yet, as Proclus explains, the relationship between sensible symbols was determined by the degree of “verticularity” that each actualized. This would explain Iamblichus’s hierarchy of human souls: the more active the god in a soul, the higher the soul’s spiritual rank. In addition, human souls under a hermetic, solar, or lunar order had a special affinity for the plants, animals, and stones associated respectively with Hermes, Helios, or Selene \( In Tim. I, 210\). As cause of a specific order, the god contained all its symbols and the theurgist had to re-create the entire collection in his ritual.

Therefore, theurgists observed the natural properties of things in order to identify their gods and to gather the appropriate objects when invoking a specific deity. Proclus says: “Hence, in the mixture of many things the theurgists united the aforementioned \[divine\]

emanations and made the unity derived from many things resemble that unity which is whole prior to the many” \( CMAG VI, 150, 28–

30\). Without this collection of things, each of which “bears a certain characteristic of the god” \( CMAG VI, 150, 27\), Proclus says the theurgist could not invoke him. This follows Iamblichus’s teaching that one must honor all the powers or the gods will not be reached \( DM 228, 19–229, 7\). One could not ascend to the undivided deity through only one of its parts or divisions.

The fragmentation of material souls required a corresponding multiplicity in their worship. Material souls had to gather a multitude of objects to represent and contain their own dividedness.

To consecrate a statue, worshipers collected various objects through which they could invoke the deity. The statue was a mean that func-7. Proclus, Peri tes kath’ Hellenas Hieratikes Technes \[On the hieratic art of the Greeks\], in CMAG, 6:150, 5–10.

tioned both as a projection of the soul’s powers and as an image of the powers of the god revealed in single coherent form.8 To ensure the effectiveness of the rite the objects had to be fitting \( prosekon\) to the god invoked and to the material attachment of the soul.

These collections formed “receptacles” \( hupodochai\) for the gods and Iamblichus says that theurgists created them with “stones”

\( lithoi\), “herbs” \( botanai\), “animals” \( zoa\), “aromatics” \( aromata\), and other sanctified objects \( DM 233, 9–12\) that possessed intimate affiliations with the gods invoked. These material objects were necessary for worship and therefore Iamblichus warns Porphyry that one ought not to despise all matter, only matter that is estranged from the Gods, for matter that is related to them should be chosen since it is able to be in harmony with the shrines built to the Gods, the erecting of statues, and also with the holy acts of sacrifices. For there is no other way that places on earth or men who dwell in them might receive participation in the Superior Beings unless a foundation of this kind is first established.9

The objects and shapes used to erect a temple or consecrate a statue had to possess sunthemata of the god invoked or theurgic contact would not be effected. In addition to the objects listed above Iamblichus refers to the use of “batons” \( rabdoi\), “pebbles”

\( psephidia; DM 141, 14\), and “incense” \( aroma; DM 233, 13–16\) to awaken corresponding sunthemata in the soul, and a form of theurgic divination called “light-gathering” \( photagogia\) employed

“water” \( hudor; DM 134, 2–3\) and “walls” \( toichoi; DM 134, 2–7\) as media for light. Iamblichus’s most extensive discussion of a material sunthema concerned the vernal rites of erecting phalli whose worship introduced man to cosmogonic action. He says: “Speaking of particular things, we say that the erection of phalli is a sunthema 8.

of generative power, and we believe this act calls out for the fecundation of the cosmos. Hence, most are offered in the spring, precisely when the entire cosmos receives from the Gods the germination of the whole natural world” \( DM 38, 14–39, 3\). The obscenities uttered during this rite also had a psychagogic function.

Iamblichus continues:

In my view the obscene words spoken indicate the privation of beauty in matter and of the antecedent state of deformity in things about to be brought into cosmic order. The entities in need of being ordered yearn \[for it\] proportionately more as they despise more the ugliness in themselves. Again, therefore, they pursue the causes of the forms and of beauty after they have learned about ugliness from the uttering of obscenities. The execution of base actions is averted, yet by means of verbal expressions the knowledge of it is revealed, and they turn their desire to the opposite \[of what is base\]. \( DM 39, 3–13\)

Iamblichus employed Aristotle’s theory of catharsis to explain the psychological effects of phallus rituals \( DM 39, 14–40, 8\), for he believed that the experience of the embodied soul was vicariously portrayed in the rite. Estranged from its own divinity, the soul—

like chaotic matter—was deprived of beauty, and the obscenities shouted in the ritual allowed the soul to recognize its ugliness apart from the divine. This recognition awakened the soul’s desire \( ephesis\) for the divine, and the erect phallus—as sunthema—was an image of that desire.10

The participant in the rite did not literally worship a phallus but the divine power of fecundation. In other words, the erect phallus functioned as an intermediary to the divine, a sunthema of the god. As Julian explains in his Letter to a Priest: “Our fathers established images and altars, and the maintenance of undying fire, and all such things, in a word, as symbols of the abundant presence of the Gods, not that we may regard these things as Gods, but that we ppp

10. The recognition of one’s “ugliness,” like the recognition of one’s “nothingness” \( oudeneia\) in prayer \( DM 47, 17\), caused the soul to yearn more intensely for the divine.

may worship the Gods through them \( di’ auton\).”11 The horizontal sympathy that the soul shared with a symbol became the foundation through which its vertical power was received, and any ritual that stopped at the horizontal level of sumpatheia and did not “preserve the analogy with divine creation” \( DM 168, 13–16\) was not theurgy at all, but sorcery \( goeteia\).Theurgic activity was always—

in analogia—cosmogonic activity, and Iamblichus condemned sorcery specifically because it did not share in the creative generosity of the gods: “If some of those \[sorcerers\] who perform invocations make use of natural or corporeal powers of the universe, the influence \( dosis\)12 of the energy, in itself, is involuntary and without evil, but he who uses it perverts the influence to a contrary purpose and to base things” \( DM 193, 15–18\). Although the influence of the material gods was universal and worked on the principle of like to like \( di’ homoioteta; DM 193, 18–19\), the sorcerer “directs this gift toward base things according to his will and contrary to justice” \( DM 194, 1–2\). Iamblichus continues:

The influence \[from the Gods\] causes things that are furthest apart to move together according to the one harmony of the cosmos, but if someone who understands this tries to draw certain parts of the universe to other parts in a perverse way the parts are in no way the cause of the perversion but the audacity of men and their transgression of the order in the cosmos, perverting things which are beautiful and lawful. \( DM 194, 2–7\) The perversity of the sorcerer returned to himself:

If anyone takes the things that contribute properly to the perfection of the universe and diverts them to another purpose and ille-gitimately achieves something, the damage from what he has evilly used will fall on him personally. \( DM 182, 13–16\) 11. Julian, Letter to a Priest 292ab, in The Works of the Emperor Julian, 3 vols., ed.

W.C. Wright \(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1969\); cf. 294c: “When we look at the images of the god, let us not indeed think they are stones or wood, but neither let us think they are the gods themselves.”

12. dosis, “influence” or “gift,” refers to the beneficent emanations that come to man from the gods; cf. DM 29, 13–15.
