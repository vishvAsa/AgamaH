  <p>Even the perfect soul is imperfect</p>
<p>when compared with divine</p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>heurgic rites reflected the order of the gods and therefore played a role in cosmogenesis, but since human souls per-Tformed the rites their differences influenced the form and intensity of their theurgies. Given the variety of human beings it would be impossible to see how theurgic ritual mirrors cosmogony unless one first understands how Iamblichus conceived these differences. Not surprisingly, he divides human souls into three classes distinguished by their purposes for descending into bodies.</p>
<p>According to Iamblichus, the purpose for the descent of the soul was revealed in its embodiment and this determined the kind of theurgy appropriate for it. Following the principles of continuity, filiation, and the rule that “like can only be joined to like” each soul was fit to perform a specific kind of ritual. For Iamblichus’s description of the descents of souls we must return to the De Anima.</p>
<p>It is significant that Iamblichus begins his review with the teachings of the Platonist Calvenus Taurus, who maintained that the Demiurge sent souls to earth to complete the cosmos ( Stob. I, 378, 25–28) and, more specifically, to reveal the life of the gods in the pure and faultless life of souls ( Stob. I, 379, 2–6). This view is consistent with Iamblichus’s own explanation for the descent of souls.</p>
<p>Since souls were the lowest of the superior kinds they were the last mediators of immortality to the mortal world. The common purpose of each soul’s descent was cosmogonic and revelatory, but 162</p>
<p>Ritual and the Human Hierarchy</p>
<p>since souls were seeded into the ranks of different gods, the nature of their manifestations differed. In addition, because embodiment itself was anatropic, it caused each soul to experience alienation and lose the continuity it possessed with the gods. Therefore, to the degree that each soul lost its original filiation with its god and divine community, it had to undergo corresponding degrees of correction. In accord with this, Iamblichus described the descent of souls first as being voluntary or involuntary: “According to another division, some modes of descent are conceived to be voluntary, either when the soul chooses to govern terrestrial things, or when it is persuaded to do so by the Superior Kinds. But other descents are involuntary, when the soul is forcibly dragged to what is inferior” ( Stob. I, 379, 6–10). The causes for these different modes of descent were the different purposes of embodiment.</p>
<p>Iamblichus continues:</p>
<p>I think that inasmuch as there are different purposes for the soul’s descent this creates differences in the manner of descent. For if the soul descends for the salvation, purification, and perfection of the things in this world then it descends purely. But if the soul is turned toward the body for the sake of exercising and correcting its habits, the descent is not entirely without passion nor is the soul, in itself, released and liberated. And if the soul descends as if being dragged down here for punishment and judgment, the descent is forced. ( Stob. I, 380, 6–14)</p>
<p>Contrary to the view of Porphyry, Iamblichus did not believe that apotheosis resulted in the soul’s escape from the cosmos. The perfectly purified soul continued to “descend,” not for the sake of punishment or correcting psychic imbalances, but for the benefit of others, revealing through its own perfection the perfection of the gods.1 The descent of a purified soul may not have severed its connection with divine beings ( ta ekei), yet it had to descend.2 As Olympiodorus says, following Iamblichus: “Indeed, Plato does not 1. Dillon aptly compares the descended soul of the theurgist (i.e., a purified soul) to the bodhisattva of Mahayana Buddhism who takes on a body for the benefit of his fellow beings. See Dillon, Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 243.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Dillon, Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 243.</li>
</ol>
<p>163</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>allow the souls of theurgists to remain always in the intelligible world, but even they descend into generation, concerning which the oracle says: ‘[to] the angelic order.’”3</p>
<p>Dillon suggests that the epithet theios given by Neoplatonists to Plato and Pythagoras, and later to Iamblichus himself, may be explained in part by this doctrine of divine incarnation: the belief that angelic souls took on human bodies for the salvation of the race. Such a soul, in the estimation of the Neoplatonists, was theios.</p>
<p>Before examining the impact of these views on Iamblichus’s theory of ritual practice, their apparent conflict with the Platonic doctrine of embodiment must be taken into account. For if a divine soul did not lose contact with the gods, as Iamblichus seems to suggest, it would be spared the trauma of birth and the experience of anatrope described in the Timaeus, but I do not think this was Iamblichus’s point. To cite the words of the Athenian stranger in the Laws: “This much I know—that no creature is ever born in possession of that intellect ( nous), or that amount of intellect that properly belongs to it when fully developed” (672b). The context, appropriately, is the condition of newborn children, and what may be inferred is that even a perfect soul would have to pass through stages of growth and accommodate itself to a mortal body and the generated world. This may have led to the theory of “progressive animation” that Iamblichus discussed in the De Anima ( Stob. I, 381, 7–13).</p>
<p>If anatrope was experienced by every embodied soul, then theurgic rituals would have been necessary for even the purest. Yet, because of the high purpose of its descent, when a divine soul entered the human condition, it may have been born into a family where it could receive the pedagogy proper to a vehicle of the gods.4</p>
<p>As embodied, the soul would still be anatropic—identified with an individual self—but in the case of a pure descent the inversion of 3. Olympiodorus, Olympiodori Philosophi in Platonis Phaedonem Commentaria, ed. W. Norvin (Leipzig, 1913; reprint Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1958), 64, 2–5.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>One such family was that of Julian the Chaldean who prayed to the Paternal Demiurge that his son be given the soul of an archangel. According to Psellus, this son, “Julian the Theurgist,” received the soul of Plato himself; see Hans Lewy, Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy, ed. M. Tardieu (Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1978), 223–24 n. 195.</li>

<p>Ritual and the Human Hierarchy</p>
<p>the soul would never become deviant.5 Its anatrope would never become habitual, making it actively enantios: opposed to itself and to the Whole. On the contrary, its anatropism would function as a pivot through which the soul could manifest the cosmogonic principle of philia, joining the parts with the Whole. Although no extant work of Iamblichus takes up this problem specifically, I would argue on Iamblichean principles that each individual consciousness, even that of a perfect soul, would be seen as deficient simply because it was human. As Iamblichus says: “Even the perfect soul is imperfect when compared with divine action” ( DM 149, 11–12). For soteriological reasons the perfect soul would have to become human in any case in order to experience anatrope and mediate the human realm with the angelic.6 Like the liberated gods who held a middle rank and lived a double life: encosmic and hypercosmic, the theurgist also held a middle rank and lived a double life: human and divine.7</p>
<p>Theurgic apotheosis was not a flight to the gods. As human, the soul remained anatropic, embedded in the natural cosmos and human society; but to the degree that the soul embodied the divine measures of the gods it sustained a direct connection with them.</p>
<p>The gods, Iamblichus says, were everywhere ( DM 30, 1–3; 27, 8–10), but they could be received only by a vehicle that had been properly prepared. Thus, speaking for all theurgists, Iamblichus says: “Let us not disdain to say this also, that we often have occasion to perform rituals for the sake of genuine bodily needs, to the Gods who oversee the body, and to their good Daimones” ( DM 221, 1–4). The reverence paid by theurgists to the gods that ruled over physical nature was an expression of their confidence in philia. This comprehensive force extended from the unity of the gods to the divisions of the sensible world, but to experience philia the soul had to know the grade of the cosmos to which it was attached so that it could honor its tutelary gods and daimons. To prescribe the appropriate ritual 5. That is to say, when heteros permanently assumes the role of autos.</p>

<p>Dillon says Iamblichus’s bodhisattva doctrine was in conflict with the myth of the soul’s descent in the Phaedrus but in accord with the role of philosopher in the Republic returning to the cave; Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 243.</p>

<p>Iamblichus described this double life of the theurgist in the De Mysteriis 184, 1–13; 246, 16–247, 5.</p>

<p>165</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>for a soul the theurgist needed to be able to “read” the nature of its energeia, for this revealed the mode of its descent and, consequently, the purpose ( telos) for its embodiment.</p>
<p>The purpose for the embodiment and descent of souls was reflected in their bodies and lives: the manifesting energeia of their souls.8 Distinguishing the three grades of souls in the De Mysteriis, Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>According to another division,9 the great herd10 of humanity is subject to nature, is governed by natural powers, and looks downward towards the works of nature;11 it fulfills the administration of fate, and accepts for itself the order of things which are brought to completion by fate. It makes use of practical reasoning all the time and only concerning things in nature. But there are a small number who, using a certain power of the mind that surpasses nature, are released from nature and are led to the separate and unmixed Nous, and at once they become superior to the powers of nature. And there are others who are between these, placed about the media between nature and the pure Nous. Some of them follow both [i.e., the separate Nous and nature], others pursue a life mixed from these, and others are liberated from inferior natures and pass on to better things. ( DM 223, 10–224, 6) Iamblichus distinguished three types of souls: (1) the great herd who follow nature and fate; (2) those who have risen to the divine 8. This triad of (1) “purposes” ( tele); (2) “modes” ( tropoi); and (3) “bodies”</p>
<p>( somata), function in a manner corresponding to the ousia-dunamis-energeia triad that Iamblichus uses to distinguish classes among incorporeals (see Chapter 6). In both cases, the body, the living energeia of the soul, revealed the tropos of its descent (just as energeia reveals its dunamis) and this, in turn, allows the theurgist to identify the telos for that soul’s embodiment.</p>
<ol start="9">

<p>The following division concludes that begun in book V, 15 where Iamblichus distinguished two modes of worship appropriate to two different conditions of the soul: when it is purely noetic, with the intelligible gods, and when it is in a body. In the division quoted here he developed this into three modes.</p>

<p>This phrase, he polle agele, was probably drawn from the CO, frag. 153; 107, 198; cf. des Places, ed., trans., and comm., Oracles chaldaïques (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1971), 103.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cf. DCMS 18, 9–13, where the embodied soul “falls out” of the natural order, and DM 21, 6–7, which describes the soul’s inclination toward the phenomena of nature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>166</p>
<p>Ritual and the Human Hierarchy</p>
<p>Nous above nature and fate; and (3) those who are between the two extremes. To each type of soul there was a corresponding mode of worship. Iamblichus continues:</p>
<p>Therefore, since these distinctions have been made, what follows should be most obvious. Souls governed by the nature of the universe, leading lives according to their own personal nature and using the powers of nature, should perform their worship in a manner adapted to nature and to the corporeal things moved by nature. In their worship they should employ places, climates, matter and the powers of matter, bodies and their characteristics and qualities, movements and what follows movements, and changes of the things in generation, along with other things associated with these in their acts of reverence to the gods, and especially in the part that pertains to performing sacrifice.</p>
<p>Other souls, living according to the Nous alone and the life of the Nous, and liberated from the bonds of nature, should concern themselves in all parts of theurgy with the intellectual and incorporeal law of the hieratic art.</p>
<p>Other souls, the media between these, should labor along different paths of holiness according to the differences of their intermediate position, either by participating in both modes of ritual worship, or by separating themselves from one mode, or by accepting both of these as a foundation for more honorable things—for without them the transcendent goods would never be reached. ( DM 224, 7–225, 10)</p>
<p>The objects sacrificed to the gods had a direct affinity with them.</p>
<p>Iamblichus says: “Whenever we worship the Gods who rule over the soul and nature it is not out of place to offer natural powers to them, nor is it despicable to consecrate to them bodies under the rule of nature, for all the works of nature serve the Gods and contribute to their government” ( DM 226, 3–9). To the gods who presided over particular places, the things produced in those places were the appropriate sacrifices ( DM 234, 1–2). Iamblichus says: “For always, to creators their own works are especially pleasing, and to those beings who are primarily the causes for producing certain things, those very things are primarily dear to them” ( DM 235, 3–5). Such creations, Iamblichus says, may be “animals” ( zoa tina), “plants”</p>
<p>( phuta) ( DM 235, 6) or other earthly products that contribute to the 167</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>administration of the gods. These creations united embodied souls with the universal philia. As Iamblichus put it, “they preserve the power of the communion between Gods and men” ( DM 235, 11–12).</p>
<p>Material creations were the proper elements to sacrifice in the theurgies of souls bound to material concerns. Through the consecration of these elements souls brought themselves into accord with the gods who ruled them; that is, with the material and encosmic deities. All souls began theurgic disciplines with sacrifices to these gods to establish a foundation for more comprehensive forms of worship, and the material gods themselves presided over these offerings. Iamblichus explains:</p>
<p>According to the art of the priests it is necessary to begin sacred rites from the material Gods. For the ascent to the immaterial Gods will not otherwise take place. The material Gods, therefore, are in communion with matter in as much as they preside over it.</p>
<p>Hence they rule over material phenomena: (i.e., division, colli-sion, impact, reaction, change, generation, and corruption of all material bodies).</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to worship these Gods theurgically, [that is to say,] in the manner in which they naturally exist and have been allotted their rule, one ought to render to them a material form of worship. For in this way we may be led into complete familiarity with all these Gods, and in worship we offer what is appropriately related to them. In the sacrifices, therefore, dead bodies and things deprived of life, the blood of animals, the consumption of victims, their diverse changes and destruction, and in short, the breakdown of the matter offered to the Gods is fitting—not for the Gods themselves—but with respect to the matter over which they preside. For although the Gods are pre-eminently separate ( choristoi) from matter they are nevertheless present to it. And though they contain matter by virtue of an immaterial power, they coexist with it. ( DM 217, 8–218, 12)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Iamblichus described the benefits of animal and blood sacrifices. In the case of expiatory sacrifices to appease the</p>
<p>“anger of the gods” ( DM 43, 2), he explained that the “anger” did not come from the gods but from the soul’s “turning away from their beneficent care” ( DM 43, 4–5). The purpose of the sacrificial rite was to turn the soul’s attention back to the gods and the higher 168</p>
<p>Ritual and the Human Hierarchy</p>
<p>order. The expiation did not affect the gods but souls, converting them to the divine order. Iamblichus says: “If anyone believes that deserting the guardian care [of the gods] leads to a sort of auto-matic injury, the appeal to Superior Beings by means of sacrifice serves to remind us again of their beneficent care, removes the privation [of their presence], and is entirely pure and inflexible” ( DM 44, 5–10). Animal sacrifice and the burning of victims portrayed how the soul’s impurities were consumed in its apotheosis. Iamblichus chided Porphyry for ignoring this symbolic (and theurgic) dimension of fire ( DM 214, 5–6, 216, 9–10):</p>
<p>Your question betrays an ignorance concerning the offering of sacrifices by means of fire, for it is the greater power of fire to consume, destroy, and assimilate matter to itself but not to be assimilated to matter, and fire lifts up the offering to the divine, heavenly, and immaterial Fire instead of drawing it down to matter and generation. ( DM 214, 5–10)</p>
<p>The power of fire to destroy and assimilate matter was a ritual anticipation of the soul’s assimilation to the gods. Iamblichus says: For Superior Beings, those for whom the breakdown of matter through fire is dear, are impassive, and they render us impassive.</p>
<p>Whatever exists within us is made similar to the Gods just as fire assimilates all solid and resistant substances to luminous and attenuated bodies. And by means of sacrifices and the fire of the sacrificial offering, we are led up to the Fire of the Gods just as [we see] in the ascent of fire to the Fire invoked and in the drawing up of gravitating and resistant things to divine and heavenly natures.</p>
<p>( DM 214, 17–215, 7)</p>
<p>In effect, the drama of blood sacrifice was a mnemonic rite to remind the soul of its fiery origin. One can imagine how the sounds, smells, and colors of an animal sacrifice would hold the attention of the worshiper; for Iamblichus, one’s absorption in the rite was the sine qua non to awaken the divine sunthema in the soul.</p>
<p>As he says, “the fire of our sacrifice imitates the divine Fire” ( DM</p>
<p>215, 19), which “liberates” ( DM 216, 5) the soul from the bonds of matter, “assimilates” ( DM 216, 5) it to the gods, and makes it fit to participate in their philia ( DM 216, 6).</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>The offering and consumption of a victim was vicariously the sacrifice of the soul, yet to achieve the desired familiarity ( oikeosis) with the gods of the sacrificed elements, the worshiper had to be similar to the elements offered. His communion with the gods depended on his connaturality ( sungeneia) with the elements.</p>
<p>Material theurgy often called for the consumption of life and blood, which may signify that for the “great herd” of humanity, embodied for punishment ( dike) and judgment ( krisis) ( Stob. I, 380, 12–13) the ritual suffering of matter effected their own. The “middle class” of souls who descended to “exercise” and “correct” ( Stob. I, 380, 10) their habits also participated in material worship that accelerated their spiritual progress. Iamblichus says: “The law of sacrifices for this use therefore will be necessarily corporeal-formed, some sacrifices cutting off what is superfluous in our souls, others filling us to the degree that we are deficient, and others leading into symmetry and order that in us which is offensively disordered” ( DM 221, 13–</p>
<p>17). Still other “sacred operations” ( DM 221, 19) fulfilled the practical needs of human existence such as the health and well-being of the body ( DM 222, 1–2), and these rites were also offered to the material gods who preside over such things.</p>
<p>Since the soul offered the gods things connatural to them, Iamblichus explained that there was also a completely immaterial mode of worship directed to the immaterial gods: “Whenever we take it upon ourselves to honor those Gods who are uniform in themselves, it is appropriate to celebrate them with liberated honors.</p>
<p>Intellectual gifts and things of incorporeal life are fitting for these beings. As much virtue and wisdom that the soul has is offered, any perfection, and all the goods that are in the soul” ( DM 226, 9–14).</p>
<p>Theurgists who performed this kind of rite were “entirely purified”</p>
<p>and very rare ( DM 219, 14–15). Indeed, Iamblichus says to participate in the gods in this manner was “the rarest of all things” ( to pan-ton spaniotaton; DM 228, 2–3), and the De Mysteriis provides little information on the theurgy practiced by these souls.12 Undoubt-12. Iamblichus says that it would not be appropriate to discuss this kind of theurgy with those who are beginning sacred operations or even with those who have reached the intermediate stage ( DM 228, 6–12).</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>Ritual and the Human Hierarchy</p>
<p>edly, these were the bodhisattvas to whom Dillon refers, the perfect souls who descended into bodies for the salvation of others ( Stob. I, 380, 8). Since they were already in perfect harmony with the gods who ruled the material cosmos they had no need to perform material worship. Nevertheless, because of the weakness of the human soul, their noetic perfection could not manifest immediately, and material forms of worship would have been necessary during their years of maturation. Such practices established the proper “foundation” ( hupothesis; DM 225, 8–11) for the immaterial worship of hypercosmic gods.</p>
<p>Finally, to the intermediate gods, who were both encosmic and hypercosmic, a twofold kind of worship was appropriate. Iamblichus says: “And in truth, to the intermediary Gods, who are leaders of intermediate blessings, sometimes two-fold offerings are adapted, sometimes a common gift to both, or such gifts that are detached from what is inferior and connected with more elevated natures, or generally, in one of the modes of worship that fills the mean position between extremes” ( DM 226, 14–20).</p>
<p>To sum up, Iamblichus affirmed a tripartite anthropology determined by the three purposes ( tele) for the descent of souls into bodies: (1) to save, purify and protect the cosmos; (2) to correct and exercise their character; or (3) to undergo punishment and judgment. These divisions correspond to Iamblichus’s tripartite theology where gods are distinguished as: (1) hypercosmic; (2) hypercosmic and encosmic; and (3) encosmic. To each class of gods a corresponding mode of worship was assigned, drawn from the elements over which it ruled. Since encosmic gods were responsible for the material order they received material offerings, hypercosmic gods received noetic gifts, and the intermediate gods received both, or a mixture, or one in favor of the other. The divisions of the gods in their cosmogonic procession, therefore, had corresponding expressions in worship. Since there were three classes of human souls, each performed the worship appropriate to its type and to the occasion for the worship. The “great herd” of humanity worshiped the material gods with material offerings, the extremely rare noetic souls worshiped the immaterial gods with noetic gifts, and the intermediate souls worshiped the intermediate gods with twofold 171</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>gifts. The correspondence between Iamblichus’s theology, psychology, and ritual worship may be portrayed in Table 1.</p>
