Iamblichus believed that theurgy was entirely compatible with Plato’s teachings on the soul and that it provided a practical solution to the problem of embodiment. Yet Iamblichus’s apology for theurgy did more than address the philosophical problem of the soul’s embodiment; more generally, it provided a defense of religious ritual against well-known arguments brought forward by Porphyry in his letter to Anebo and his treatise On the Abstinence of Animal Food. Far from being a mere propaideia to philosophy, Iamblichus argued that the concrete performance of ritual was the culmination of one’s philosophical development. Theurgy tied soteriology to cosmogony and allowed the soul to share in both.">

  <p>God is the leader of these things…</p>
<p>Iamblichus believed that theurgy was entirely compatible with Plato’s teachings on the soul and that it provided a practical solution to the problem of embodiment. Yet Iamblichus’s apology for theurgy did more than address the philosophical problem of the soul’s embodiment; more generally, it provided a defense of religious ritual against well-known arguments brought forward by Porphyry in his letter to Anebo and his treatise On the Abstinence of Animal Food. Far from being a mere propaideia to philosophy, Iamblichus argued that the concrete performance of ritual was the culmination of one’s philosophical development. Theurgy tied soteriology to cosmogony and allowed the soul to share in both.</p>
<p>Up to this point Iamblichus’s Platonism has been considered with respect to his metaphysical positions. In Part I, matter and embodiment were examined and absolved of the pejorative conno-tations given to them by Iamblichus’s predecessors. In Part II, the embodied soul was examined, the most problematic aspect of Iamblichus’s metaphysics. Yet Iamblichus’s paradoxical definition of the soul as “self-change” is crucial for a proper understanding of Platonic theurgy. The anatropic condition of the embodied soul was tied to the mysteries of creation and salvation. Far from being denied, the inversion of the soul was seen by Iamblichus to be necessary to complete the cosmogonic cycle, and embodied experience, progressively incorporated by theurgic activity, put the soul in place despite the prima facie fact of its being out of place, i.e., anatrope.</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s metaphysical solutions to the problems of matter and the embodiment of the soul form an essential background to 147</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>his theory of theurgy. Yet without ritual performance they would remain, by his own definition, discursive fantasies cut off from the divine. Therefore, we must examine the rituals themselves: although theurgy may be described theoretically as a soteriological and cosmogonic practice, it must be seen specifically how this was understood and accomplished. Since this is the question Iamblichus himself was challenged to answer, we can do no better than (1) follow Iamblichus’s explanation of the correspondence that exists between the cosmos and the cult; (2) consider the significance of this correspondence for man in finding and performing an appropriate ritual; and (3) examine in detail how the rites exemplify this correspondence and fulfill a theurgic function. In sum, the question to be answered is how Iamblichus understood ritual to be simultaneously soteric and cosmogonic, and consequently, how the stages of cosmogony were reflected in the theurgic cult.</p>
<p>In his letter to Anebo, Porphyry accused theurgists of believing that the gods “were especially enticed by the vapors of animal sacrifice” ( DM 212, 2–3), and Iamblichus responds by laying out the principle of all theurgic sacrifice: “The best of all beginnings is the one which demonstrates that the law of sacrifices ( thesmos ton thusion) is connected with the order of the gods ( taxis ton theon)” ( DM 217, 3–5). In On the Abstinence of Animal Food Porphyry had argued that the “gods” worshiped in blood sacrifices were not gods at all, but daimons counterfeiting as gods. That daimons were the immediate objects of worship was a point with which Iamblichus agreed, for it followed the hierarchical law that man must approach the gods through the mediation of daimons. However, Iamblichus disagreed with Porphyry’s description of these entities. While both acknowledged that daimons were invisible beings with pneumatic bodies, Porphyry contended that their bodies were perishable and nourished by the vapors of blood sacrifice. Iamblichus categorically denied it: “For although Daimones possess a kind of body which some believe is nourished by sacrifices, this body is unchangeable, impassive, luminous, and without needs, so that nothing flows from it and, in addition, it does not need anything outside to flow into it”</p>
<p>( DM 212, 3–7). As a class daimons were ontologically superior to man and revealed the invisible powers of the gods. Iamblichus says: 148</p>
<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>“they bring into manifest activity the invisible good of the Gods, reveal what is ineffable in them, shape what is formless into forms, and render what is beyond all measure into visible ratios” ( DM 16, 17–17, 4). In short, daimons were agents of the Demiurge in his cosmogonic activity. Understandably, for Porphyry, the agents of a desacralized cosmos could not be considered superior to man.</p>
<p>Therefore, his estimation of daimons as perishable and perverse demons was a correlate to his view of the cosmos as a topsy-turvy realm from which souls must escape, a point not missed by Iamblichus who accused Porphyry of holding unreasonable views, saying:</p>
<p>“It is not possible that the Creator has generously provided ready nourishment for animals in the sea and on earth, but has made the beings superior to us [i.e. daimons] in want of it” ( DM 212, 15–18).</p>
<p>To believe, as Porphyry did, that daimons depended on man for their sustenance contradicted the rational order of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Thus, Iamblichus argues:</p>
<p>Why don’t those who say this simply turn the entire hierarchy of things upside down, making us more powerful and in a better class? For if they make us responsible for nourishing and fulfilling Daimones we would be above them in the order of causes. For every order receives its perfection and nourishment from the order that generates it. One can see this even in the generation of visible things, and it is also seen among cosmic entities; in fact, earthly things are nourished by the celestial. And this becomes especially clear among the invisible causes. For Soul is perfected by Intellect, and Nature by Soul, and other things similarly are nourished by their causes. And since it is impossible for us to be the ruling causes of Daimones, for the same reason we could not be the causes of their nourishment. ( DM 213, 8–214, 3) Iamblichus’s position on the question of sacrifice and daimons was based on his understanding of the “order of the gods” ( taxis ton theon). Although his criticism of Porphyry on the question of daimons exemplifies only one instance where he found himself at odds with his former teacher, the issue typifies Iamblichus’s more general critique of Porphyry’s soteriology. Iamblichus continually referred to the hierarchical order of the cosmos to correct Porphyry’s misunderstandings of theurgy, so to understand theurgic ritual we must 149</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>understand the order of the Iamblichean gods, the archai of his cosmos.</p>
<p>Iamblichus divided superior beings ( hoi kreittones) into four distinct classes: gods, daimones, heroes, and pure souls. As discussed previously, the extreme classes, gods and souls, were unified and divided respectively; whereas daimons and heroes served as media connecting the extremes. Iamblichus imagined the gods at the top and souls at the bottom of an ontological scale, with daimons in the second rank “suspended far below the gods” ( DM 16, 13–14).</p>
<p>Heroes, situated below daimons, were adjacent to souls but superior to them in virtue, beauty, magnitude, and other goods ( DM 16, 8–</p>
<p>10). Due to Porphyry’s questions about daimons, Iamblichus devoted more attention to explaining their function.</p>
<p>Significantly, their task was cosmogonic. Daimons were the agents of prohodos. They obeyed the “beneficent will of the gods”</p>
<p>( DM 16, 15–17) and revealed the divine and invisible good. Insofar as daimons served the processional impulse of the gods they were responsible, as well, for binding souls to bodies ( DM 67, 15–68, 1). In their extrovertive function, daimons produced growth in plants and preserved animal species (including human) through the sex drive and other instincts. In this sense daimons might seem opposed to the soul’s desire to free itself from material attachments. Yet Iamblichus never forgets that it is the gods and the Demiurge who send the daimons forth. Therefore, man had to understand how to work with these demiurgic functions, not to reject or oppose them. As Iamblichus asserts: “I say, therefore, that Daimones are produced by the generative and demiurgic powers of the Gods in the most extreme culmination of the [cosmogonic] procession and the last distribution of parts” ( DM 67, 3–6). The daimons of Iamblichus may be likened to “laws of nature.”1 As guardians of the generated realm, daimons blindly performed their tasks, and souls prospered or not depending on their judicious use of these powers. Heroes, on the other hand, performed a soteriological function and guided 1. For a development of this idea in the context of Egyptian rites and symbols see Philip Derchain, Le Papyrus Salt 825 ( B.M. 10051): Rituel pour la conservation de la vie en Egypte (Brussels: Paleis der Academien, 1965), 3–21.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>souls in their spiritual integration. Iamblichus says: “But Heroes are produced according to the logoi of life in divine beings, and the first and perfect measures of souls are completed and defined by Heroes” ( DM 67, 6–9). Typical to Iamblichus’s method, he distinguished daimons and heroes in the same manner that he distinguished gods and souls: by their essence ( ousia), power ( dunamis), and activity ( energeia). “For,” Iamblichus says, “being generated from different causes, the essence of one is different from the essence of the other” ( DM 67, 10–11). His distinctions are as follows: ousia: The essence of Daimones is fit for bringing about final effects; it is perfective of mundane natures and gives completion to the providential care that oversees each generated being. But the essence of Heroes is vital and rational and is the leader of souls. ( DM 67, 11–15)</p>
<p>dunamis: With respect to their powers, those of Daimones must be defined as fecundating, for they oversee nature and the binding of souls into bodies; but to Heroes one must assign powers that are vivifying, that lead men, and are liberated from generation. ( DM</p>
<p>67, 15–68, 2)</p>
<p>energeia: It follows that the activities of these classes should be defined. The actions of Daimones should be defined as more mundane and more widely extended in the deeds they bring to completion; but the actions of Heroes are less pervasive and are concerned with the orderly arrangement of souls. ( DM 68, 3–7) According to these definitions the function of daimons was cosmogonic. Acting centrifugally, they carried the generative will of the Demiurge into its most minute and particular expressions. The function of heroes, by contrast, was convertive. As agents of epistrophe they guided the soul’s daimonic drives into divine measures.</p>
<p>Viewed statically, daimons and heroes were in conflict, the former binding souls to bodies and the latter aiding in their release.</p>
<p>In this light it is understandable how the daimons of the Platonic tradition became the demons of the Gnostic and Christian worlds.</p>
<p>For Iamblichus, however, both daimons and heroes acted in conjunction and obedience to the divine will ( DM 70, 5). They completed the circuit of divine life that descends continually into 151</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>sensible expression while remaining rooted in the Forms. Thus, Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>these mediating classes complete the universal bond between Gods and souls, they effect an indissoluble connection between them, and they bind together one continuum extending from the highest to the lowest. They make the communion of universal beings indivisible and provide an excellent blend and proportionate mixing for all. They allow the procession ( prohodos) to pass from more excellent to inferior natures, and they equally facilitate the ascent ( anagoge) from inferior to superior natures. They insert order and measures of the communication descending from more excellent natures, [they allow for] its reception into imperfect beings, and they make all things mutually agreeable and in harmony with each other, receiving from on high, from the Gods, the causes of all these things. ( DM 17, 8–20)</p>
<p>The continuity ( sunecheia) and kinship ( sungeneia) of the cosmos were essential to Iamblichus’s theory of theurgy. Based on the principle that there was an unbroken continuity throughout the cosmos ( DM 20, 5), Iamblichus could defend rites that used material objects. Theoretically, any object could connect the human soul with the gods because the entire world was their energeia and therefore manifested their presence. As Iamblichus put it, the gods were</p>
<p>“present immaterially within material things” ( DM 232, 15–16), and therefore theurgists invoked the gods in accord with their different expressions ( DM 30, 13).</p>
<p>Porphyry challenged this view and asked how theurgists can invoke subterranean and terrestrial deities if the gods dwell only in the heavens ( DM 29, 17–19). Repeating Thales’ well-known dictum, Iamblichus replied: “To begin with, it is not true that the Gods dwell only in heaven, for all things are full of the Gods” ( DM 30, 1–3; cf.</p>
<p>DM 27, 8–10). Each god’s authority was allotted to a different region of the cosmos: heaven, earth, sacred cities, sacred places, or certain sacred groves or statues ( DM 30, 14–16), yet the gods themselves were not affected by these allotments for</p>
<p>the divine illuminates all these externally ( exothen) just as the sun externally ( exothen) illuminates all things with its rays. Therefore, just as light envelops things illuminated by it, so does the power of 152</p>
<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>the Gods externally embrace those natures that partake of it. And just as natural light is undividedly present in the air . . . so also the light of the Gods shines separately ( choristos), and though it remains firmly established in itself it proceeds through all existing beings. ( DM 30, 16–31, 6)</p>
<p>Although the light of the gods was indivisible ( DM 31, 6–10), the world was divided and therefore their light was received in different ways.</p>
<p>Yet the light itself is everywhere and entirely one and it is indivisible in all things that are able to participate in it. By its perfect power it fulfills everything, and by virtue of its unlimited and causal transcendence it brings all things to completion in itself.</p>
<p>Everywhere it is united to itself and joins last things to their principles. ( DM 31, 13–18)</p>
<p>The gods were revealed by their participants aetherially ( aitherios), aerially ( aerios), aquatically ( enhudrios), etc. ( DM 33, 8–9), and theurgists invoked the gods accordingly ( DM 33, 9–11).</p>
<p>Attempting to find contradictions in Iamblichus’s Platonism, Porphyry asked how theurgists could worship the gods as sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies if the gods were incorporeal ( DM</p>
<p>50, 14–17). To which Iamblichus replies: “Indeed, we maintain that the celestial Gods are not contained by bodies but that they contain bodies in their divine lives and activities ( energeiai)” ( DM 50, 17–51, 2). The celestial gods contained their bodies, and since all gods were defined by unity their activities were also unified. As we have seen, the only body that exemplifies unified action is the sphere, so the bodies of the gods were spheres, the geometric complement to their unity. Yet heavenly spheres were not bodies in the ordinary sense for they were perfect energeiai of gods. Quite literally they were the divine acts ( theia erga) or theurgies of the gods. Like the theurgic actions performed by human souls, the celestial bodies “imitate the sameness of the Gods with an eternal motion, in accord with the same principles and similarly toward the same end, according to one ratio ( heis logos) and one order ( mia taxis)” ( DM 51, 16–52, 2).</p>
<p>According to Iamblichus, the bodies of the celestial gods were</p>
<p>“entirely similar,” “united,” and “uniform” ( DM 52, 6–8) so that, 153</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>despite their embodiment, “the visible Gods in the heavens are all, in a certain sense, incorporeal” ( DM 52, 17–18).</p>
<p>Because the body of a visible god was totally under the control of its soul and guiding Nous, its noetic character was iconically revealed as a sphere and, like other sunthemata, it served as a mean between the corporeal and the incorporeal.</p>
<p>According to Iamblichus, incorporeal gods existed above their celestial counterparts. In a lost treatise entitled On the Gods Iamblichus distinguished these two classes of deities as “cosmic” ( perikos-mioi) and “hyper-cosmic” ( huperkosmioi) ( DM 271, 11), and in his discussion of sacrifices and gods in the De Mysteriis he referred to these gods respectively as “material” and “immaterial”: In the first place, we maintain that among the Gods some are material and others immaterial. The material Gods are those that contain matter within themselves and give it order, but the entirely immaterial Gods are removed from matter and transcend it. ( DM</p>
<p>217, 4–8)</p>
<p>The material gods were the celestial deities, and though Iamblichus distinguished them from the “incorporeal” ( asomatoi) and “intelligible” ( noetoi) gods ( DM 57, 7–8), all the gods were united. The different allotments—whether material or immaterial—simply reflected the contexts in which they communicated the will of the Paternal Demiurge. In response to Porphyry’s question about the relation of corporeal to incorporeal gods, Iamblichus says: Since the Gods ride upon celestial spheres while remaining incorporeal, intelligible, and united, they continue to possess their principles in the intelligible realm, and while contemplating their own divine forms they govern the entire heaven according to one infinite activity. And if, while being in the heavens separately ( choristos), they lead the eternal revolutions through their will alone, they remain themselves, unmixed with the sensible order and coexisting with the intelligible Gods. ( DM 57, 7–14) Like light that remains “firmly established in itself ” ( DM 31, 5), the celestial gods remained in the intelligible realm yet served as principles for their “visible statues,” the celestial spheres ( DM 57, 18). In turn, the celestial gods generated sublunary existences which 154</p>
<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>also remained in “continuity” ( sunecheia) with the intelligible gods</p>
<p>“according to one union” ( kata mian henosin) ( DM 58, 3–4). The dominant characteristic of the gods was unity, their activity was unifying, and thus, although the One was present everywhere ( DM</p>
<p>58, 7), it was most evident among the gods. The material gods were therefore united with the immaterial gods through their common characteristic of “unity.” Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>In the case of the Gods, their order exists in the union of them all: their primary and secondary genres and all natures generated from them co-exist together in unity. The beginning, the middle, and the end co-exist according to the One itself, so as regards the Gods one ought not to seek from whence the One comes to them.</p>
<p>For whatever the Being itself is in them, this Being of theirs is the One. And according to this principle, the secondary Gods remain in the One of the primary Gods while the primary Gods give to the secondary the unity proceeding from themselves. All of them together possess the communion of an indissoluble connection.</p>
<p>( DM 59, 15–60, 8)</p>
<p>Despite this unity at the level of the gods, the soul could reach the immaterial level only first by passing through the material gods. In fact, the characteristics of these two orders may have been determined by their effects on souls. For example, Iamblichus said that the soul’s liberation from fate was effected by the hypercosmic gods ( DM 271, 11–12). Unfortunately, his explanation of these gods has been lost, but Damascius says that his description of the liberated gods ( apolutoi theoi) was based on Iamblichean teachings so we will follow his explanation.</p>
<p>Damascius says that according to “Orpheus” and “the theurgists”</p>
<p>( Dub. et Sub. II, 214, 8) each order of the gods was determined and guided by the order immediately prior to it. Thus, the summit of any order was rooted in the order above it and guided it from there.</p>
<p>Concerning the liberated gods, Damascius says:</p>
<p>Thus, the liberated ( apolutoi) Gods should be conceived as the last of the hypercosmic ( huperkosmioi) Gods and as exercising providential attention over the world. Therefore, [we ask], do these liberated Gods occupy the highest point among the encosmic 155</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>( enkosmioi) Gods, and are they to be counted among them with respect to their characteristics, or are the liberated Gods not only encosmic but also reveal a hypercosmic nature? Accordingly, and with respect to their proper species, one ought to classify them as the mean ( mesotes) of these [i.e., the hyper- and encosmic gods].</p>
<p>We maintain that the liberated Gods are those that exercise a providential attention over the cosmos but are neither held in its nature nor completed within its order. ( Dub. et Sol. II, 214, 8–15) Under the reign of Kronos, the “liberated Demiurge” ( apolutos demiourgos; Dub. et Sol. II, 214, 22), the gods ruled in Plato’s Golden Age ( Dub. et Sol. II, 214, 17–19), guiding the world from above with noetic and providential care. As the mesotes between encosmic and hypercosmic gods, the liberated gods were in contact with both worlds. Damascius continues:</p>
<p>Indeed, their position according to their half-related status reveals more clearly how they occupy the middle rank among the Gods.</p>
<p>For at the same time that their status of being “related” ( to kata schesin) is proper to the encosmic Gods, their status of being</p>
<p>“unrelated” ( to ascheton) is proper to the hypercosmic Gods. For</p>
<p>[their] nature is one but [also] double since they project a single life which is both encosmic and hypercosmic. ( Dub. et Sol. II, 215, 4–6)</p>
<p>Damascius applied the law of mean terms to create an intermediary class of gods, and since he attributed these teachings to Iamblichus it is safe to assume that Iamblichus’s material and immaterial gods would have been joined in the same way. Iamblichus said that the liberation of souls was effected by the hypercosmic gods, but to fulfill a liberating function Damascius reminds us that these gods must somehow have been in the cosmos: how else could they lead souls out of it? The difference between the material and immaterial gods therefore, like the difference between fate and providence, cannot be separated from the soul’s experience of them.2 The mediating class (or function) of “liberated” gods reflected the soul’s experience of the liberating presence of immaterial gods in the material order 2. In the same way that Iamblichus says that “fate is providence” so the material gods, in one sense, are the immaterial gods; cf. Stob. II, 174, 5–7.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>and further, since the soul’s experience was triadic,3 the order of the gods was also assumed to be triadic.4 Just as the spherical bodies of celestial gods mediated between the corporeal and incorporeal realms, the liberated gods mediated between the encosmic and hypercosmic realms, their identity and position being relative to the context in which they were experienced (see Diagram 1, below).</p>
<p>Hypercosmic gods</p>
<p>Liberated gods</p>
<p>Encosmic gods</p>
<p>Diagram 1. The liberated gods, AB, allow the hypercosmic gods, A, to manifest themselves as cosmic gods, and they allow the encosmic gods, B, to participate in the hypercosmic gods.</p>
<p>The division of the gods into hypercosmic (A), encosmic (B), and liberated (AB) is an extension of Iamblichus’s “law of mean terms”</p>
<p>to the divine classes.5 Since Iamblichus assumed the law of the 3. That is, the soul experienced the hypostasis of the liberated gods and thus identified with the mean term embracing two divine orders: immaterial and material.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Personal experience must always be taken into account to understand the abstract schemas of the Neoplatonists. As A.C. Lloyd puts it: “The hypostases are experiences; they are types of consciousness. . . . It follows that the element of personal experience is needed to complement the non-empirical philosophical system.</li>

<p>157</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>mean distinguished the classes of the gods, the archai of his universe, it necessarily distinguished lower levels of manifestation.</p>
<p>With the law of the mean Iamblichus connected the extremes of any opposition, including that between gods and men.</p>
<p>In his letter to Anebo, Porphyry understandably had asked why theurgists subordinated invisible daimons to visible gods ( DM 61, 12–15). Iamblichus replied that the visible gods were “united” ( sun-hemmenoi; DM 61, 17) with the intelligible gods because their very Form (unity) was held in common ( DM 61, 18) but daimons were far removed from unity and had a different essence ( DM 62, 1).</p>
<p>With respect to the invisibility of the noetic gods and daimons, Iamblichus said that although both daimons and the noetic gods were invisible ( aphaneis), significant differences separated them.</p>
<p>Daimons were merely invisible to the senses, but the gods were invisible to “rational knowledge” and “material intelligence” ( DM</p>
<p>62, 5–7). For Iamblichus, whatever was invisible to the intellect because of its transcendence was certainly higher than what was merely invisible to sight. In the case of the celestial gods, although they were empirically visible, they remained invisible to the grasp of the mind. Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>What then? Are the invisible Gods, by virtue of being invisible, any greater than the visible Gods? Not at all! For the divine wherever it is and whatever allotment it has, possesses the same power and dominion over its subordinates. Accordingly, even if it is visible it rules in the same way over invisible Daimones, and if it exists in the earth, it still rules over the Daimones of the air. For neither the place of reception nor a part of the world can produce any change in the authority of the Gods. ( DM 62, 10–63, 1) Gods and daimons were also distinguished by their dominions.</p>
<p>The dominion of the gods was universal while that of daimons was divided into parts ( DM 63, 5–10), and the gods were “entirely independent” ( pantelos kechorismenoi; DM 63, 14–15) of the bodies they commanded while daimons were not separated ( achoristoi) from the things they ruled ( DM 63, 12–13). As Iamblichus put it: Generally, the divine is leader and stands over the order of beings, but the daimonic nature is attendant and willingly receives what-158</p>
<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>ever the Gods instruct them to do, and they work out manually the things which the Gods conceive, wish, and command intellectually. Surely this is why the Gods are free from the powers that verge into generation, but Daimones are not completely free of them. ( DM 64, 2–9)</p>
<p>Consequently, every god manifested itself through its attendant daimons, who were in sumpatheia with animate life while the god remained entirely independent ( choristos).</p>
<p>Since the order of the gods and of each god was triadic, the structure of the universe and of every ontological order necessarily reflected this triune principle. The Pythagorean influence on Iamblichus is particularly evident in the role of the triad, which was central to Pythagorean worship. In De Caelo Aristotle reports: It is just as the Pythagoreans say, the whole world and all things in it are summed up in the triad; for end, middle, and beginning give the number of the whole and their number is the triad. Hence it is that we have taken this number from nature, as if it were one of her laws, and make use of it even in the worship of the gods.6</p>
<p>More specifically, the triadic rule was reflected in each ontological class. For example, Iamblichus distinguished three kinds of daimons: (1) those who help the gods reward theurgists for their sacred labors ( DM 181, 8–13); (2) those who preside over judgments as the agents of justice, aiding good men and punishing the evil ( DM 181, 13–19); and (3) those who are without reason ( alogistos) or judgment ( akritos), are allotted one power, and preside over a single natural function ( DM 182, 1–4). Of this third group Iamblichus says: Just as the function of a knife is “to cut” and to do nothing else it is the same in the case of the spirits distributed into the cosmos. . . .</p>
<p>Indeed, in the case of certain invisible spirits each receives but one power, and by nature it performs only this one task that has been ordained for it. ( DM 182, 4–13)</p>
<p>This last class of daimons was irrational, blindly preserving the order of nature and corporeal life. They manifested in the rhythms 6. Aristotle, De Caelo 268a, 11–17, in Aristotle, vol. 6, On the Heavens, trans.</p>
<p>W.K.C. Guthrie (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1939; 1971).</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>of somatic life: the diastole and systole of the heart, the rhythm of breath, the digestion of food, and the consistency of the nervous system. In the psychic life they were instincts of preservation, sustaining the hungers and drives that preserve individuals and society.</p>
<p>The task of each soul, therefore, was to engage these daimons in a way that “imitates the Demiurge,” to act “justly” and in obedience to the laws of the creator gods ( Tim. 41c). If the soul succeeded in this it was lifted to the level of the gods. Since these laws were as much biological as ethical, the labors of the embodied soul included eating justly, exercising justly, sleeping and waking justly, as well as behaving justly toward other human beings and the ruling gods: in short, labors that made up the Pythagorean bios as conceived by Iamblichus in De Vita Pythagorica.</p>
<p>The Chaldean Oracles reflect the same Pythagorean influence and one fragment reads: “For in every world shines a triad, ruled by a monad.”7 While the One ruled transcendentally over all triads, its immanent activity took the form of philia, a term Iamblichus borrowed from the Pythagoreans.8 Cosmologically, philia, like the Chaldean eros, was the power that bound all things to all. Theologically, philia unified the triads of the gods, and since the gods ruled all theurgies, each theurgic rite was an expression of the philia that governed the cosmos and “[binds] the Gods to men . . . through learned worship” (VP 123, 7–9). This philia was conveyed to humanity in rituals that both embodied and reflected the divine order. Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>Is not every sacred ritual legislated intellectually from first principles according to the laws of the Gods? For each rite imitates the order of the Gods, both the intelligible and the celestial, and each possesses the eternal measures of beings and the wondrous symbols which have been sent here by the Demiurge, the Father of all things.” ( DM 65, 3–7)</p>
<p>Every rite had its beginning and end in the gods; man was the performer, not the initiator, for “it is not possible for any of the divine 7. The CO, frag. 27, p. 59; cf. des Places, ed., Oracles chaldaïques (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1971), 73.</p>

<p>Cult and Cosmos</p>
<p>actions to be performed in a sacred manner without one of the Superior Beings present to oversee and complete the sacred acts”</p>
<p>( DM 144, 1–3). Since the human soul was the lowest divinity and, in its embodied and anatropic state, was incapable of reaching the gods, it could neither invent nor initiate a theurgic rite. On this point Iamblichus was clear:</p>
<p>If these things were only human customs and received their authority from our legal institutions one might say that the worship of the Gods was the invention of our ideas. But in fact God is the leader of these things, the one who is invoked in the sacrifices and a great number of Gods and angels surround him. And each nation on earth is allotted a certain common guardian by him, and every temple is similarly allotted its particular overseer. ( DM</p>
<p>236, 1–8)</p>
