*We Egyptians do not use words, *

*but sounds…*

ne might assume, with Porphyry, that since “names” fall within the order of discourse they would have discursive Omeanings, so he asked why theurgists recited “names without meaning” \( *ta asema onomata*; *DM* 254, 15\). Iamblichus replied contentiously that such names “are not meaningless” \( *ta de ouk* *estin asema*; *DM* 254, 16\) even if they are “unknowable” \( *agnosta*\) to us: “to the Gods, however, they are all meaningful, but not in a way that can be described, or in a manner that is significant or indicative to men through their imaginations” \( *DM* 254, 18–255, 3\). These names, he continues, were revealed through the intellect of the gods or remained completely ineffable \( *aphthengtos*\) and intelligibly united with them \( *DM* 255, 4–6\). Therefore, Iamblichus says: It is necessary to remove all conceptions and logical deductions from divine names, and to remove as well the physical imitations of the voice naturally akin to the things in nature. Rather, it is the symbolic character of divine resemblance, intellectual and divine, that must be accepted in the case of divine names. \[ *DM* 255, 6–

11\] . . . even if it is unknowable to us, *this very thing is its most venerable aspect*. \( *DM* 255, 11–13\)

If divine names, like other names, were conceptually knowable they would possess the same properties as human thoughts; Por-201

*Theurgy and the Soul*

phyry’s interest in their “meaning,” therefore, was characteristically anthropocentric and misguided. It was equivalent to seeing herbal *sunthemata* as food, or mineral *sunthemata* as building material. In short, Porphyry was caught up in the horizontal expression of the nominal *sunthemata*, and since he saw no meaning in the names, he questioned their value. For Iamblichus, however, their ineffability was their “most venerable” \( *to semnotaton*\) aspect because it awakened the ineffable presence of the divine in the soul. Thinking, by itself, could not achieve this. As Iamblichus says:

Whence indeed, the divine causes are not called into activity prompted by our thoughts. Rather our thoughts and all the noble dispositions of the soul, as well as our purity, should be considered as auxiliary causes, but the things that truly excite the divine will are the divine *sunthemata* themselves. And so the causes from the Gods are activated by the Gods themselves, who accept nothing for themselves from their inferiors as cause of their own proper activity. \( *DM* 97, 11–19\)

*Sunthemata* were the “wild cards” in Iamblichus’s cosmological deck. They revealed the presence of the gods at any grade of reality since each grade was sustained directly \( *autothen*\) by them. Yet the ascent of each soul was gradual, and at its particular level of attachment only an encounter with a *sunthema* from that level allowed the soul to proceed.

With respect to the names used in theurgy Porphyry also asked why the priests prefer barbarian names over “our own.” For this Iamblichus says there is a “mystical reason” \( *mustikos logos*\) \( *DM*

256, 5–6\): “Because the Gods have taught us that concerning the sacred races such as the Egyptians and Assyrians their entire language is adapted to sacred concerns, and on account of this we believe that it is necessary for us to address the Gods in a language which is connatural \( *sungeneia*\) to them” \( *DM* 256, 6–9\). Iamblichus maintained that the Egyptians and Assyrians received the names of the gods through divine revelation, kept them intact and thus connected with the gods who sent them.

Iamblichus opposed Porphyry’s suggestion that sacred names could be translated, as if their conceptual meanings were indepen-202

dent of their phonetic expressions. This view overlooked the theurgic and “vertical” dimension of the *sunthemata*. Iamblichus says: The situation is not as you have supposed. For if it were according to convention \( *kata suntheken*\) that names were established, it would make no difference whether some names were used instead of others. But if they are tied to the nature of reality those names which are more adapted to it would no doubt be more pleasing to the Gods. Indeed, from this, as is reasonable, the language of sacred races are preferred over those of other men. \( *DM* 257, 3–10\) The translation of “sacred names” would be ineffectual, “for even if it were possible to translate them, they would no longer hold the same power” \( *DM* 257, 13–15\).

The translation of divine names was a much-debated topic in antiquity, and while the question cannot be treated here in detail it is worth noting that Iamblichus’s *mustikos logos* was shared by Origen, for whom Hebrew was the sacred language, “not concerned with ordinary, created things, but with a certain mysterious divine science that is related to the Creator of the universe.”1 And in the *Corpus Hermeticum* “Asclepius” warns King Ammon not to translate Egyptian mysteries into Greek:

For the Greeks, O King, who make logical demonstrations, use words emptied of power, and this very activity is what constitutes their philosophy, a mere noise of words. But we \[Egyptians\] do not \[so much\] use “words” \( *logoi*\), but “sounds” \( *phonai*\) which are full of effects.2

Fragment 150 of the *Chaldean Oracles* puts it very simply: “Do not change the *nomina barbara*.”3

In a critical essay on the question of translation Claire Préaux explains the underlying issue of the debate. “The attitude of religious communities with regard to translation,” she says, “is conditioned by the degree of rationality that they admit in the relations between 1.

man and the divine.”4 Because of the limits of embodiment, Iamblichus allowed human rationality only a small role in these relations.

By contrast, Porphyry—with his doctrine of the undescended soul—

believed that the exercise of rationality allowed the soul direct access to the divine. Préaux concludes by suggesting that the nontransla-tors’ view of human existence was pessimistic, but in this she fails to see the cosmological affirmation that underlies it, at least in Iamblichus’s case. She also overlooks the cosmological pessimism in the translators’ view, implied in their devaluation of the sensible expression of the word. For if one adopts the translators’ view that the sound of a sacred name is not significant or powerful apart from its conceptual meaning, then the sound as such would be superfluous, and the sensible aspect of the word could be disregarded in favor of its inaudible *logos*. For Iamblichus, however, to deny the value of the god’s audible expression would dismiss the *energeia* of the god, and in principle it would deny the value of the entire sensible cosmos as the *energeia* of the Demiurge.5 The names of the gods were individual theophanies in the same way that the cosmos was the universal theophany, and since both preceded man’s conceptual understanding Iamblichus says they should not be changed according to conceptual criteria \( *DM* 259, 1–5\). Out of the same respect that Iamblichus held for the cosmos as the sensible expression of the Demiurge, he honored the audible manifestations of the gods. The sacred names were “bodies” of the gods that should not be violated by translation.

In contrast to Iamblichus, Proclus believed that several nations possessed divine names, among whom he includes Egyptians, Chaldeans, Indians, and Greeks.6 Proclus maintains: “Even though God may be called by the Greeks *Briareus* under the influence of the Gods, and is called in another way by the Chaldeans, it must be 4.

As Trouillard explains in his discussion of the Neoplatonic understanding of the revelatory power of the “spoken word”: “Mais il ne faut pas oublier qu’un être supérieur ne contient pas en acte les déterminations qui procèdent de lui. En s’exprimant et en se manifestant, il fait de nouveau. Il ne se redouble pas.” “L’Activ-ite onomastique selon Proclos,” in *Entretiens*, 254.

understood that each of these names is the offspring of the Gods and signifies the same essence.”7

The difference between Proclus and Iamblichus on this issue depends on how much emphasis is given to Proclus’s phrase: “under the influence of the gods” \( *para ton theon*\). If taken in a strong sense, it puts Proclus in the same camp as Iamblichus with respect to theurgic principles, for it implies that the name Briareus was divinely received by the Greeks, that is to say, in the same manner that the Assyrians and Egyptians received their divine names “having mixed them with their own language” \( *DM* 256, 11–13\). Iamblichus never argued that there was only one sacred language—after all, this would contradict his own principles by giving universal power to a particular *qua* particular. He argued, rather, that the names of the gods were determined by the gods themselves and established as inviolate. Proclus, for his part, never argued that divine names were changed or even translated; he simply asserted an equivalence between the Greek and the barbarian names of the gods. Where the two clearly part company was in their estimation of the Greeks. The Athenian *diodochos* allowed for a theurgy of names native to the Hellenes while the Syrian Iamblichus polemicized against the Greeks as proponents of undisciplined speculation.8

In this regard, Iamblichus followed the Hermetic teachings of the Asclepius tractate and emphasized the stability of the Egyptians against the instability of the Greeks. Because the names used in Egyptian prayers remained unchanged, they were still charged with the unchanging power of the gods. The Greeks, however, lost the power of their prayers through continual innovations.

The contrast is twofold. In general, throughout the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus contrasted the stability and goodness of the gods with the instability and perversity of men \(cf. *DM* 146, 10–12; 144, 12–14; 284, 19–285, 2\); more specifically, he opposed sacred races, who humbly preserve rituals given by the gods, to the Greeks and others 7. Ibid., 32, 9–12.

8. Trouillard also points out that for Proclus the *onoma* is distinguished from *phone* because the latter functions as *hule* and the former as *eidos*. “L’activité onomastique,” 252–54.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

who presumed a creative license about sacred matters. In this regard the Egyptians functioned for Iamblichus as a racial *sunthema*, and he upbraided Porphyry for thinking that he might be singling them out arbitrarily. There was nothing about the Egyptian language *qua* Egyptian, that made it sacred \(i.e., viewed “horizontally” in comparison with other languages\), but rather it was because “the Egyptians were the first human beings to be allotted participation in the Gods” \( *DM* 258, 3–5\), and sustained this connection in their language. It was due to this divine \(“vertical”\) dimension that Iamblichus honored their rituals and language.9

Neither Iamblichus nor any of his Platonic successors provide concrete examples of how names, sounds, or musical incantations were used in theurgic rites. There is a great wealth of evidence from nontheurgical circles, however, to suggest that theurgists used the *asema onomata* according to Pythagorean cosmological theories and a spiritualization of the rules of grammar. In Demetrius’s first-century book *On Elocution* he reports: “In Egypt, the priests, when singing hymns in praise of the gods, employ the seven vowels \( *pho-netai*\), which they utter in due succession.”10 The report is tantaliz-ing but only suggestive. More theoretical evidence for the liturgical chanting of the vowels by theurgists is given by Nicomachus of Gerasa who explains that each of the seven spheres is associated with a tone and a vowel. Nicomachus says:

Indeed, the tones of the seven spheres, each of which by nature produces a particular sound, are the sources of the nomenclature of the vowels. These are described as unspeakable \( *arrheta*\) in themselves and in all their combinations by wise men, since the tone in this context performs a role analogous to that of the monad in number, the point in geometry, and the letter in grammar. However, when they are combined with the materiality of the 9. *Laws* 656d–657b. B.D. Larsen rightly explains that in antiquity it was the common conviction that Greek philosophy derived from Egyptian wisdom. Larsen says that in the role of Abammon, Iamblichus represents Egyptian wisdom answering the questions posed by Greek philosophy, represented by Porphyry.

consonants, just as soul is combined with body, and harmony with strings, \(the one producing a creature \( *zoon*\), the other notes and melodies\), they have potencies which are efficacious and perfective of divine things. \[Thus whenever the *theourgoi* are conducting such acts as worship they make invocations symbolically with hissing, clucking, and inarticulate and discordant sounds\].11

Hans Lewy suggests that Proclus substituted *theourgoi* for another term or simply added the last sentence, since theurgists were unknown in the first half of the second century c.e.12 Nevertheless, Nicomachus’s association of vowel sounds, the seven spheres, and their power to effect divine things when uttered anticipated the principles of theurgy if not its nomenclature, and Iamblichus was undoubtedly familiar with this teaching. In the *Theology of Numbers*, attributed to Iamblichus, the author describes the attributes of the heptad:

Seven is also called “voice”13 because the seven elementary sounds

\[vowels\] exist not only in the human voice but also in the instrumental, the cosmic, and, in short, the *consonant* voice, and not only because of the single and primary sounds emitted from the seven stars—as we have learned—but also because the first scale of the musicians is a heptachord.14

*Theurgy and the Soul*

Iamblichus cites the authority of Ostanes and Zoroaster to explain the connection of the heptad with planetary angels. The Babylonians, Iamblichus says, call the stars “herds” \( *agelai*\) because they move together in circles and act as “bonds” \( *sundesmoi*\) and “collections”

\( *sunagogai*\) of physical ratios. \( *TA* 57, 2–3\). Since the administration of these ratios was an “angelic” function, Iamblichus notes that with the addition of a *g* these “herds” \( *agelai*\) were called “angels” \( *aggeloi*/

*angeloi*\), by the Babylonian priests \( *TA* 57, 5\). He continues: Hence, in a similar way, they call the stars and *Daimones* that rule over each of these herds “Angels” and “Archangels,” and these are seven in number. So, according to the truest etymology the heb-domad is called *angelia*.15

Iamblichus says the heptad is also called the “Guardian” \( *phulakitis*\) because the seven starry spheres guard the universe and rule over it with “continuous and everlasting permanence” \( *TA* 57, 12\).

Iamblichus believed that the seven vowels were connatural \( *sungenia*\) with the seven planetary gods, and certain Gnostic writings suggest that one-to-one correlations were ritually developed. For example, Valentinus’s disciple Marcus associated the vowels with heavenly spheres as follows: and16

Ruelle provides examples from the magical papyrus of Leiden that demonstrate how these vowels were used in invocations. The papyrus reads:

I invoke you Lord, with a chanted hymn, I sing your holy prayer: *A E E I O Y O O O*.17 Your name made up of seven letters in harmony with the seven sounds which have voices \( *phonai*\) corresponding to the 28 lights of the moon \(“Le chant,” 40\).

There are numerous other examples of vocalic invocations in the Greek Magical Papyri.18 The so-called *Mithras Lithurgy* as well as certain Hermetic tractates provide examples of theurgic-like invocations that were certainly known to Iamblichus. This prevalence of *voces mysticae* in the rites of late antique sorcerers probably played a significant role in Iamblichus’s defense of theurgy in the *De Mysteriis*. For, as Dodds pointed out, the techniques of the sorcerer and the theurgist would have been indistinguishable to the uninitiated,19

so Iamblichus had to explain theurgy in a way that was entirely consonant with Platonic philosophy. The *hieratike techne* of the later Platonists had to be distinguished from sorcery \( *DM* 161, 10–16\).

After all, Iamblichus employed the craft and material of sorcerers, the *asema onomata* for example, and he probably shared their cosmological assumptions, but in theurgy the purpose of the rite was never to manipulate the gods or call them down. On the contrary, theurgic invocations called souls up to experience the gods.

In a discussion of theurgy’s relation to Gnosticism, Birger Pearson suggests that Iamblichus’s theories of theurgy might profitably be applied to certain Gnostic texts.20 Pearson has already shown the 17. Ruelle, “Le Chant des sept voyelles grecques,” *Revue des Etudes Grecques* 2

*Theurgy and the Soul*

decidedly Platonic flavor in some later forms of Gnosticism;21 so, he argues, there is reason to suspect that certain Gnostics shared the theoretical presuppositions of the Neoplatonists.22 Since the Gnostics did not provide a theoretical framework to explain their rites and Iamblichus did not provide concrete ritual data, Pearson’s study is useful for both scholars of Gnosticism and later Neoplatonism.

Pearson suggests that some Gnostic rites effected the soul’s salvation through a simultaneous ascent and descent achieved by chanting the *nomina barbara* and unintelligible vowels. He explains the Gnostic chants with a passage from the *De Mysteriis* where Iamblichus maintains that anagogic rites fulfilled divine law since the purpose of the soul’s descent was to reascend.23

Since the ascent of the soul was integrally tied to the descent of the gods in cosmogenesis, when the soul chanted the names and vowels associated with the gods it entered their *energeia*. Because the names were divinizing the soul ascended, yet insofar as the soul chanted the names, it descended with them into the sensible world.

Since these sounds were the *agalmata* of the gods, when the soul chanted them, it imitated the activity and the will of the Demiurge in creation. In this sense the theurgist did bring the gods down into the world, but he did so at their command and to fulfill their will.

This clearly would distinguish theurgy from sorcery, for a theurgic incantation preserved the transcendence and ineffability of the gods while making the soul an embodiment or actualization of their will.

Since the soul itself could never grasp or initiate theurgy, the incantation, strictly speaking, was accomplished by the god, yet it freed the soul by allowing it to actively experience what it could never conceptually understand.

Again, theurgical Platonism may be seen as Iamblichus’s practical application of Pythagorean theory. Following the rule that first principles contained and yet remained hidden in their pluralities, 21. Pearson, “Gnosticism as Platonism: With Special Reference to Marsanes \(NHC 10, 1\),” *Harvard Theological Review 77* \(1984\): 55–72.

the theurgist reached the primordial silence of the One only by embracing the plurality of sounds. Just as the monad was present in multiplicity monadically, preexisting silence was present in the seven sounds silently, and the theurgist entered this silence by chanting/containing the sounds that proceed from it.

In an incantation the theurgist became a citizen of two worlds.

On the one hand, he joined the gods through his assimilation to the Demiurge; on the other, he remained mortal due, in part, to the expression of the demiurgic will. Insofar as the theurgist became divine, he commanded the daimons who served the gods, yet he did not command them as a man but as one of the gods. Discussing this double nature of the theurgist Iamblichus says: “According to this distinction, therefore, as is proper, \[the theurgist\] invokes as his superiors the powers from the universe since the one making the invocation is a man and, on the other hand, he commands them since, somehow, by means of the ineffable symbols, he is invested with the hieratic shape of the Gods” \( *DM* 184, 8–13\).
