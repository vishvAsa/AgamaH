> *The existence of souls is lowest, *
*deficient, and imperfect…*

In the *De Anima* [^1] Iamblichus outlined his differences with Plotinus on the doctrine of the soul  
and developed his own position in more detail.

[^1]: See A.-J. Festugière’s translation and commentary, “Traité de l’âme,” *La Rév*. 3:177–264. Compare B.D. Larsen’s discussion of this treatise, B.D. Larsen, *Jamblique* *de Chalcis: Exégète et philosophe* \(Aarhus: Universitetsforlaget, 1972\), 197–213. Larsen argues that Iamblichus makes use of Aristotelian methods to pursue Platonic themes. By drawing parallels with Iamblichus’s other writings Larsen demonstrates how Iamblichus’s philosophic positions support theurgy.


Although the treatise is valuable as a doxography of the philosophical schools of antiquity,  
Iamblichus’s own position is evident,  
and the rationale for his psychology lends support to his adoption of theurgy  
as the praxis necessary for the embodied soul.

The first part of the treatise discusses the essence \( *ousia*\) of the soul  
and the philosophers who define it as incorporeal,  
including those who equate the soul with all other incorporeals.  
Iamblichus says:

> There are some who maintain that all parts of this incorporeal substance are alike  
> and one and the same,  
> so that the whole exists in any part of it.  
> They even place in the individual soul, the Intelligible World, the Gods, the *Daimones*, the Good, and all races superior to the soul;  
> and in each soul they contend that all these exist in the same way,  
> though for each in a manner appropriate to its essence.  
> Holding this opinion without question is Numenius, and Plotinus agrees with it, though not entirely,  
> Amelius vacillates towards it,  
> and Porphyry is in doubt about it, sometimes [[78]] he earnestly rejects it  
> and sometimes he follows it completely as having been handed down from on high.  
> 
> According to this view, the soul, considering its entire essence,  
> is in no way different from the *Nous*, the Gods, or the Superior Races. \( *Stob*. I, 365, 7–21\)  

According to Iamblichus this view failed to make distinctions within the incorporeal realm itself,  
so that from the human soul to the Good  
all incorporeals were considered as more or less equivalent.  
In contrast Iamblichus drew clear distinctions between ontological levels of the incorporeal realm.[^2]  
He says:

> The doctrine opposed to this, however,  
> makes the soul a separate entity,  
> inasmuch as it is generated second after the *Nous* as a different hypostasis,  
> and that part of it which is noetic is explained as being dependent on the *Nous* along with the power of subsisting independently on its own, and it separates the soul also from all the classes of being superior to itself and assigns to it, as the particular definition of its essence, either \[1\] the mean between the divisible and indivisible, the corporeal and the incorporeal beings, or \[2\] the totality of the universal *logoi*, or \[3\] that which, after the Forms, is at the service of the work of creation, or \[4\] that Life which has Life of itself, which proceeds from the *Nous*, or \[5\] again the procession of the classes of Real Being as a whole to an inferior status. Indeed, Plato himself, Pythagoras, Aristotle, and all of the Ancients whose great names are praised for wisdom, were absolutely convinced of these doctrines \(as anyone would discover if he were to study their teachings with care\). And truthfully, we will attempt to construct our entire treatise around these teachings.3

Iamblichus defined the essence of the human soul with characteristics that describe its function as mediator between irreconcilable extremes \( *Tim. * 34c–36e\). In the *Timaeus* it is through the mathematical mediation of soul that the indivisible appears as ordered divisions of the cosmos. The human soul’s essence, therefore, lay precisely in its mediating role, and Iamblichus’s strict 2. Cf. *DM* 50, 6 where Iamblichus says that it would be out of place to put such things as “time,” a “line,” and “god” in the same genus simply because they are

“incorporeal.”

adherence to this teaching led him into paradoxes that were resolved only in theurgic ritual. If mediation defines the essence of the soul as Iamblichus believed, it is clear why he did not identify soul with *Nous* as Plotinus did, for *Nous* is entirely free of the

“lower” end of the oppositions mediated by the soul. Consequently, for Iamblichus, the deification of the soul could not be effected by introspection because the embodied soul had no immediate access to the divine. In light of this, Iamblichus developed a soteriological practice that by its very name, *theourgia*, defines not what the soul does, but what gods do through the soul.

Iamblichus’s *De Anima* was clearly influenced by the language and the method of Aristotle; its significance, however, remained Platonic. Like most Neoplatonists, with the exception of Plotinus, Iamblichus believed that Aristotle’s teachings were entirely harmonious \( *sumphonos*\) with Plato’s.4 Iamblichus even integrated Aristotle’s seemingly unplatonic view of the soul as *entelecheia* of the body into his theurgical Platonism. In his commentary on the *Alcibiades* Iamblichus employed the Aristotelian distinction of *ousia*, *dunamis*, and *energeia* but transformed it into an emanative triad typical of later Neoplatonism.5 Having explained that the essences \( *huparx-eis*\) of daimons and the superior races were extremely difficult to grasp Iamblichus says:

\[E\]ven the essence \( *ousia*\) of the \[human\] soul is not easily perceptible to everyone. \(Only\) the *Timaeus* at any rate has given a full revelation of its essence . . . but to make clear the powers \( *dunameis*\) of Daimons is easy enough. We attain to a perception of them through their activities \( *energeiai*\) of which the powers are the immediate mothers; for a power is a median between an 4. See H.J. Blumenthal, “Neoplatonic Elements in the De Anima Commentaries” *Phronesis* 21, no. 1 \(1976\): 64–87.

5. The Aristotelian dictum that essences are known by their activities \( *De Anima* 146, 21\) had precedents in the Platonic dialogues \( *Rep*. 477c; *Soph*. 247e\), a point that was certainly not overlooked by the later Neoplatonists. See P. Shorey, “Simplicius *de Anima* 146, 21,” *Classical Philology* 17 \(1922\): 143–44; cf. Stephen Gersh, *From Iamblichus to Eriugena: An Investigation of the Prehistory and Evolution of the Pseudo-Dionysian Tradition* \(Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1978\), 32–45.

essence and an activity, put forth from the essence on the one hand, and itself generating the activity on the other.6

Using this method to differentiate species of “soul” by reference to their activities, Iamblichus placed human souls near the bottom of the psychic hierarchy and maintained that their actions revealed their ontological rank. This was in opposition, he says, to the opinion of the Stoics, Plotinus, and Amelius who did not distinguish between the acts of particular souls and the acts of the World Soul \( *Stob*. I, 372, 7–14\). Thus Iamblichus says:

There may be another opinion which may not be rejected, one which, according to classes and kinds of souls, distinguishes between the perfect acts of universal souls, the pure and immaterial acts of divine souls, the efficacious acts of daimonic souls, the great acts of heroic souls, and the mortal acts performed by animals and men.7

What distinguished embodied souls was the separation of their *ousiai* and *energeiai*, a hypostatic rupture that condemned them to mortality and separated them from the gods. Theurgy was able to bridge this gap by uniting the *energeia* of mortals with the *energeia* of the gods. Iamblichus explained that each soul began its corporeal life in a fallen and separated state due to the weakened consistency of human souls portrayed by Plato in his metaphor of the demiurgic mixing bowl \( *Tim. * 41d\). Although every human soul carried the divine ratios \( *logoi*\) established by the Demiurge, its “measures of coherence” \( *metra tes sunoches*\)8 were no longer uniformly preserved but were broken apart into divisions of time. Following a suggestion by Proclus, Dillon says that Iamblichus conceived the 6. *In Alcib*., frag. 4, 9–16, Dillon, trans., *Iamblichi Chalcidensis*, 74–75.

hierarchy of souls according to their respective allotments of the elements “essence” \( *ousia*\), “sameness” \( *tautotes*\), and “otherness”

\( *heterotes*\). The distribution of these three elements, respectively, determined the rank of all souls: divine, daimonic, and human, with human souls carrying the greatest proportion of “otherness.”9

Iamblichus believed that inattention to this passage of the *Timaeus* \(41d\) caused Plotinus and Amelius to miss important distinctions among souls \( *Stob*. I, 372, 23–26\). Outlining his own position, Iamblichus says:

Others make a more prudent distinction and insist that the different essences of the soul continually proceed according to a downward sequence of primary, secondary, and tertiary processions—

such as one would expect of those who discuss these matters with arguments which are unfamiliar but unshakable. They say that the operations of universal, divine, and immaterial souls are completely realized in their essences, but they will by no means agree that individual souls, *confined as they are to one single form* and divided out among bodies, are immediately identical with their acts.10

Like all entities in tertiary procession from the Demiurge, the acts of embodied souls were separated from their essences and completed only within the cycles of generation. Iamblichus says: “In accord with the opinion just espoused the acts of those souls which are self-perfect, uniform, and independent of matter are naturally connected to their powers \( *dunameis*\), but the acts of imperfect souls, who are divided among parts of the earth, are like plants producing fruit” \( *Stob*. I, 373, 10–15\). The “plant” in which the soul’s actions were brought to fruition was the human body, which gradually manifested the powers of the soul. As Andrew Smith puts it,

“the manifestation of the soul in a body is the activity of the soul.”11

Since the body reflected the activity of the soul, it also indicated the kind of soul that animated it.12 The bodies of celestial souls, for example, were perfectly receptive to their lords and revealed them by their circular activity.13 These were the self-perfect souls \( *autoteleis*\) whose actions were realized within their essences. Their *arche* and *telos* were simultaneous. The activity/manifestation of the embodied soul, however, lacked the capacity to receive the powers of the soul at once; they had to be developed over time as the soul gradually bore the fruit of its different psychic powers. Iamblichus describes this progressive animation:

The powers of the soul and its modes of being are several, and following a measured chronology in which the developing body is appropriately disposed from one period of time to the next, it participates first in a *vegetative* life, then in *sensation*, next in an *appetitive* life, then it participates in the *rational* soul, and finally in the *intellectual* soul. \( *Stob*. I, 381, 7–13\) Although the activity of the soul-as-body revealed the soul’s essence and powers, it did not define them. Iamblichus emphasized this point in response to Porphyry’s questions on the characteristics \( *idiomata*\) of divine races. In the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus argued that if one defines the gods or higher races by the receptacles \(bodies\) that manifest them the ontological hierarchy would be turned upside down \( *DM* 10, 12–11, 2\). The *energeiai* reveal but do not define the identity of a god:

For if activities and movements were constitutive of essences they would determine the differences between them. But if, on the contrary, essences generate activities, these essences, being prior to and separate from the effects of the activities, would bestow to movements, activities, and their accidents that which defines them. \( *DM* 13, 13–14, 1\)

Apart from turning the ontological order upside down, defining 12. Following the principle that matter was the index of the spiritual state of the soul.

13. As Aristotle puts it: “for the body whose motion is circular, the place where it ends is also the place where it begins” \( *De Caelo* 279b, 4–5\).

83



essences by their activities would place the defining characteristics of incorporeals in their material vehicles, and nothing would distinguish one incorporeal from another apart from its *material* expression. Iamblichus implies that both Plotinus and Porphyry held this view so that, as an ironic correlate to their monopsychist tendencies, they were forced to accept Aristotle’s metaphysical position that matter was *principium individuationis*.14

Iamblichus considered this a gross misunderstanding and misap-plication of the *ousia-dunamis-energeia* method: To make bodies principles in determining the specific properties of their own first causes seems terribly out of place \( *DM* 23, 16–24, 1\). . . . This argument makes bodies superior to divine races, since they would provide superior causes with their foundation and would impart to them their essential characteristics. \( *DM* 24, 15–

18\)

Iamblichus argued that each divine genre defined itself, and its activity neither exhausted nor determined it. What distinguished divine races was not their material manifestation but their priority and independence with respect to one another:

If you conceive the unique characteristic \[of each divine genre\] to be a certain simple state defined in itself as in prior and posterior orders which change entirely and essentially in each genre, this conception of characteristics would be reasonable \( *DM* 11, 2–

6\). . . . Those of them which are prior are independent of those which are inferior. \( *DM* 14, 11–12\)

In effect, Iamblichus distinguished divine entities following Aristotle’s distinction of Plato’s Ideal Numbers and his own Unmoved 14. This problem reflects the difficulty of integrating the transcendental psychology of Plato with Aristotle’s physics and descriptions of the embodied soul.

The Neoplatonists’ juxtaposition of Aristotle’s technical virtuosity with Plato’s teachings pitted the evocative but imprecise imagery of Plato against Aristotle’s more articulate physics. This may have caused Platonists to embrace certain Gnostic positions that put a breach between physics and metaphysics, materiality and spirituality. It was precisely this kind of bifurcation that Iamblichus saw in Plotinus’s and Porphyry’s metaphysics and that he criticized philosophically and sought to correct theurgically.

84



Movers.15 According to Aristotle, each was a species unto itself, not under a common genus, and not to be synthesized or combined.16

Following this mathematical model, Iamblichus tells Porphyry that the correct way to conceive the relations between divine orders is by following a proportional method: “Anyone using proportional methods to determine the analogous sameness in the genres under consideration, i.e., to the many races among the Gods and in turn to the races among *Daimones*, Heroes, and finally Souls, will be able to determine their defining characteristics” \( *DM* 14, 15–20\).

In Iamblichus’s estimation, the human soul was unique because of its radical self-division. Unlike divine souls, the human soul was bound to the generative cycles of its body, yet it projected for itself the mortal life that bound it. Therefore, although the material body defined the soul’s characteristics, it did so by proxy, given by the soul when it descended into a body. In each of its incarnations, Iamblichus says the soul projects immortal *logoi* from itself in its descent, and these in turn were combined with mortal lives acquired from the cosmos.17 Thus, each incarnation produced an entirely new identity.

15. See Philip Merlan’s classic treatment of this topic, “Aristotle’s Unmoved Movers,” *Traditio* 4 \(1946\): 1–30.

16. The term used by Aristotle is *asumbletoi*, “incombinable,” “incomparable”

\( *Meta*. 1080a, 29\) to describe numbers in themselves, prior to their being considered in relation to one another. See *Aristotle’s Metaphysics*, 2 vols., text and commentary by W.D. Ross \(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958\), liii and 2:426–27. Merlan argues convincingly that Aristotle identified these “monads” with his unmoved movers and that these were later identified by Saint Thomas with “angels” \(9–10\). For Thomas’s angelology and its background, see Etienne Gilson, *The Philosophy of St. Thomas* *Aquinas*, trans. Edward Bullough, ed. G.A. Erlington \(New York: Dorset Press, 1948\), 175–77. The equation of Platonic divine numbers with the angels of medieval Christianity was probably the result of the arithmogonic and theurgic speculations of later Neoplatonists passed on to the West by Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna. In the *Theologoumena Arithmeticae* Iamblichus describes numbers in their

“incombinable” essences, as monadic “gods.” In the *De Communi Mathematica Scientia* the mathematic expressions of these monads are discussed in their “relations.”

Since Iamblichus’s daimons, angels, and heroes bore the signatures of their presiding deities, the relations of their orders were understood on analogy with the principles they expressed and obeyed.

17. See Iamblichus’s description of this process in Simplicius, *In Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium*, in *CAG*, ed. C. Kalbfleisch \(Berlin: G. Reimeri, 1907\), 8:376, 26–377, 4; cf. *DM* 25, 8–13; 59, 1–8.

85



As a mean between divine and mortal realms the Iamblichean soul had the unique distinction of being both mortal and immortal.

This has led to many difficulties in making sense of Iamblichus’s psychology, for depending on the context being discussed the soul could be described with opposite characteristics relative to what it is being compared. Referring to this problem Iamblichus says: “someone might say the soul in bodies is divisible with regard to *Nous*, not because it is only divisible but because compared to the *Nous* it appears to be so, whereas with regard to the divisible essence it appears indivisible.”18

Although all genres of soul mediated, certain souls did so in a more unified manner than others. The human soul, as we have seen, carried a greater degree of *heterotes* and therefore suffered a separation unexperienced by other souls. Only in the case of the human soul did its “otherness” \( *heterotes*\) bring about a separation in its essence,19 for only in the case of a human soul did its manifestation produce a *mortal* vehicle. Consequently, the human soul was the lowest of all divine hypostases for below it \(e.g., animals and plants\) there was no independent or sustained identity.20

The diminished status of the human soul is clearly drawn out in the *De Mysteriis* where Iamblichus compares the properties of the highest and lowest classes of souls, that is, the souls of gods and ppp

\(translation modified\).

19. Cf. Simplicius \(Priscianus?\), *In Libros Aristotelis de Anima Commentaris*, in *CAG*, ed. M. Hayduck \(Berlin: G. Reimeri, 1882\), 11–241, 2–20. It is significant that of all the Neoplatonic interpreters of the *Parmenides*, only Iamblichus assigns soul to the fourth hypothesis, putting it under the sway of the “other.” See Dillon, trans., *Iamblichi Chalcidensis*, 387–89; see also Proclus, *Théologie platonicienne* \( *Th. Pl*.\), 5

vols., trans. and ed. H.D. Saffrey and L.G. Westerink \(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1968–87\), 1:lxxv–lxxxix.

20. The technical term to describe the “self-subsistence” or “self-constitution”

of the human soul is *authupostaton*, which Iamblichus coined in his treatise on fate \( *Stob*. II, 174, 22\); cf. also R.T. Wallis, *Neoplatonism* \(London: Duckworth, 1972\), 129; John Whittaker, “The Historical Background of Proclus’s Doctrine of the *AUTHUPOSTATA*,” in *Entretiens*, 193–237.

86



souls of humans,21 by referring to the *ousia-dunamis-energeia* triad in each class. His distinctions are as follows:22

*The Gods*

*ousia*: The gods’ *existence* is highest, transcendent, and perfect.

\( *DM* 21, 1–2\)

*dunamis*: The gods have the *power* to do all things at once, uniformly, and in an instant. \( *DM* 21, 3\)

*energeia*: The gods *generate* *and* *govern* all things without inclining to them. \( *DM* 21, 5\)

*Humans*

*ousia*: The *existence* of souls is lowest, deficient, and imperfect.

\( *DM* 21, 2\)

*dunamis*: Human souls do not have the *power* to do all things, neither at one time, nor in an instant, nor uniformly. \( *DM* 21, 4\) *energeia*: Souls have the nature to incline and turn toward what they *generate* and *govern*. \( *DM* 21, 6–7\).

Iamblichus also includes the following distinctions:

21. The “gods” described as one of the “extremes” in Iamblichus’s fourfold hierarchy are the *neoi theoi* of the *Timaeus* \(41a\) and thus part of the creative work of the Demiurge. As such they would be “cosmic gods,” but for Iamblichus these encosmic deities were themselves the vehicles through which the “supracosmic gods” \( *huperkosmikoi theoi*\) revealed themselves. \(Cf. *DM* 271, 10–12 for their distinction; *DM* 59, 15–60, 8 for their connection.\) Like most Neoplatonists, Iamblichus’s use of terms such as *theos* or *psuche* was not entirely consistent. Plotinus, for example called the human soul the “last god” \( *Enn*. IV, 8, 5, 25\), and Hierocles referred to human souls as “mortal gods” \( *thnetoi theoi*\); *Hierocles in Aureum* *Pythagoreorum Carmen Commentarius*, ed. F.G. Koehler \(Stuttgart: Teubner, 1974\), 9, 8. In his explanation of the terminology of the “middle genres” Hierocles said that “Daimons,” “Heroes,” and “Angels” were interchangeable terms depending on the author and the context \( *Car. Aur*. 19, 9–27\).

22. I have followed the outline of H.D. Saffrey, “Plan des livres Iet II du *de Mysteriis* de Jamblique,” in *Zetesis Album Amicorum*, ed. E. de Strycker \(Antwerp: De Nederlandsche Boekhandel, 1973\), 281–95.

87



*The Gods*

\(a\) are the cause of all things. \( *DM* 21, 8\)

\(b\) already embrace perfection. \( *DM* 21, 10–11\) \(c\) are superior to every measure and form. \( *DM* 21, 4–5\) *Humans*

\(a\) are suspended from a cause. \( *DM* 21, 8–9\)

\(b\) move from imperfect to perfect. \( *DM* 21, 12–13\) \(c\) are conquered by inclination, habit, and tendency, and take their form from the measures of secondary orders. \( *DM* 21, 18–19\) Iamblichus said that the existence of daimons and heroes between these extremes ensured an unbroken continuity between the gods and man. While gods and human souls were distinguished by unity and multiplicity respectively,23 daimons were “multiplied in unity”

\( *heni plethuomenon*; *DM* 19, 12–13\), and heroes, while more manifestly divided, still preserved uniformity and continuity in their divisions and motions \( *DM* 19, 15–20, 2\). Although gods and humans had no characteristics in common, the mediation of daimons and heroes provided communion with the gods. Later in the *De Mysteriis*, perhaps in response to Porphyry’s terminology \( *DM* 70, 10–

12\), Iamblichus adds two classes of “angelic” souls between the gods and daimons and two classes of “archontic” souls between heroes and human souls resulting in the following stratification: 1. gods

2. archangels

3. angels

4. daimons

5. heroes

6. archons \(sublunary\)

7. archons \(material\)

8. human souls24

23. The gods are *henomenon* \( *DM* 18, 7\) and humans are *eis plethos* \( *DM* 18, 15\).

24. Cf. *DM* 70, 18–71, 18. For a discussion of these added distinctions see Dillon, trans., *Iamblichi Chalcidensis*, 50–52.

88



Unlike the system of Plotinus, where the soul could transcend its hypostasis and attain union with the One, Iamblichus fixed the soul in its ontological rank. He allowed it to rise higher than its given class but only through the benevolent will of the gods; regardless of its degree of ascent the soul remained distinctly soul: The soul is attached to the Gods with other harmonies of essences and powers than those by which *Daimones* and Heroes are joined to them. And though it possesses an eternity of life and activity similar to, but in a less degree than *Daimones* and Heroes, due to the good will of the Gods and the illumination of light imparted by them the soul often is elevated higher and is lifted up to a greater order, the angelic. Indeed, then it no longer remains within the limits of “soul,” but the whole of it is perfected into an angelic soul and an immaculate life. Whence indeed, it seems \( *dokein*\) that the soul comprehends in itself all manner of essences, activities, ratios, and ideas of every kind. *But if it is necessary to speak the* *truth, the soul is always limited according to one certain class, but by* *joining itself to its ruling causes it is sometimes aligned with one* *group, sometimes with another*. \( *DM* 69, 5–19\) Iamblichus almost allows the soul to embrace all the higher essences like the Plotinian soul. This, however, would give it the characteristics of a god, not a soul \( *DM* 28, 18–20\); what separated Iamblichus from Plotinus in this regard was his cautionary *dokei* and subsequent explanation.

Each class of soul defined its own activity \(Cf. *DM* 11, 2–6; 12, 6–

14\) and therefore determined the receptacle through which its capacities were expressed. The manifestation of a soul-as-body was itself an activity of the soul, and therefore the kind of body that a soul animated indicated its class. These classes, Iamblichus says, do not change.25 As lowest of divine beings, the human soul had an unstable and mortal vehicle that alienated it from its own divinity.

In embodiment, the soul literally became *other* to itself.

25. It should be noted that, for Iamblichus, although human souls cannot rise above their rank neither can they fall below it. As Dillon puts it: “Man was not to be ranked with the gods and angels, but he was not down among the pigs and wolves either” \( *Iamblichi Chalcidensis*, 45–46\). According to Dillon, Nemesius reported that Iamblichus denied that the soul transmigrated into animals.
