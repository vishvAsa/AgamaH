  <p>That which is immortal in the</p>
<p>soul is filled completely with</p>
<p>mortality…</p>
<p>he repercussions of viewing the Platonic soul through Aristotle’s doctrine that essences ( ousiai) are revealed by activi-Tties ( energeiai) have been examined by Carlos Steel in a brilliant monograph on Neoplatonic psychology, The Changing Self.1 Steel outlines Iamblichus’s view of the soul by examining the Iamblichean fragments preserved in Priscianus’s (Simplicius’s?) commentary on Aristotle’s De Anima.2 At the outset of his commentary Priscianus says that he “will hold to the truth of the matter as much as possible according to the interpretation of Iamblichus 1. Carlos G. Steel, The Changing Self: A Study on the Soul in Later Neoplatonism: Iamblichus, Damascius, and Priscianus, trans. E. Haasl (Brussels: Paleis der Academien, 1978).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>For the attribution of this commentary to Priscianus rather than to his contemporary, Simplicius, see F. Boussier and Carlos G. Steel, “Priscianus Lydus en de ‘In de Anima’ van Pseudo(?)-Simplicius,” Tijdschrift voor Filosofie 34 (1972): 761–822. Ilsetraut Hadot accepts the hypothesis of Boussier and Steel on the basis of the striking similarities between the De Anima commentary and Priscianus’s Metaphrasis in Theophrastum, ed. I. Bywater in Supplementum Aristotelicum 1, no.</li>

<p>2 (Berlin, 1886): 1–37, but shows their argument of supposed doctrinal incompati-bilities between Simplicius’s other works and the  de Anima commentary to be unfounded; see Hadot, Le Problème du néoplatonisme alexandrin: Hiéroclès et Simplicius (Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1978), 193–202. Blumenthal says he shall continue to call the author of the de Anima commentary “Simplicius” “as a matter of convenience”; Blumenthal, “The Psychology of (?)Simplicius’ Commentary on the De anima,” in Soul and the Structure of Being in Late Neoplatonism: Syrianius, ppp</p>

<p>The Paradox of Embodiment</p>
<p>set out in his teachings on the soul.”3 For Priscianus, Iamblichus was “the best critic of the truth” ( ho aristos tes aletheias krites; DA 89, 33–37), and his extensive quotations and discussions of Iamblichus’s views form the basis of Steel’s analysis.</p>
<p>Steel throws light on the disturbing complexity of Iamblichus’s psychology. He shows that Iamblichus followed the energeia-</p>
<p>reveals- ousia formula not only to distinguish incorporeal classes but also to focus on the specific case of the human soul. It led Iamblichus to the conclusion, especially difficult for a Platonist, that because the energeiai of embodied souls were mortal and subject to change so their ousiai, being the source of this activity, were also mortal and subject to change! Even more problematic was Iamblichus’s belief that the soul’s separation from the Nous also separated the soul from itself and its immortality. Priscianus says: If, however, as Iamblichus thinks, a perverse and imperfect activity would not proceed from an essence which is impassive and perfect, the soul would be, even in its essence, somehow subject to passion. For, in this view the soul is a mean, not only between divided and undivided, the remaining and the proceeding, the noetic and the irrational, but also between the ungenerated and the generated.4 . . . For on account of its verging outside, the soul simultaneously remains as a whole and proceeds as a whole, and it is neither entirely involved in, nor free from, either trait. Wherefore, that which is immortal in the soul is filled completely with ppp</p>

<p>mortality and no longer remains only immortal. Somehow the ungenerated part of the soul becomes subject to generation just as the undivided part of the soul becomes subject to division.5</p>
<p>Ambiguity and paradox defined the very essence of the soul. Again, Priscianus:</p>
<p>According to Iamblichus, the particular soul embraces both characteristics equally, both permanency and change, so that in this way its intermediate position is again preserved; for higher beings are stable, mortal ones are completely changeable. The particular soul, however, which as middle, is divided and multiplied together with the mundane beings, does not only remain permanent but also changes because it lives through so many divisible lives. And not only in its habits, but it changes also in its substance.6</p>
<p>These oppositions were triggered by the soul’s animation of its body. Since the human soul was “inclined toward the body that it governs” ( DM 21, 5–7, 16), when it projected its “lower lives” (i.e., the irrational powers of the soul) its ousia was broken apart and intertwined with mortal lives.7 Paraphrasing Iamblichus,8 Priscianus says: “It is therefore more reasonable and necessary to say that not only the activity but also the highest essence of our soul is in some way relaxed, broken up, and has its existence constituted, so to speak, in its descent toward lower lives.”9 While Plotinus and Porphyry also 5.

<p>The Paradox of Embodiment</p>
<p>maintained that the soul projected its lower powers ( dunameis) to animate the body and believed that these powers acted as a mean between the ousia and the embodied energeia of the soul, the essence of the soul was never affected by this projection. Changes may seem to affect the soul, but its rational essence remained untouched. For Plotinus, the diverse activities attributed to the soul were merely accidental and somatic accretions which do not implicate the soul’s unfallen ousia.10 For Iamblichus, they do. In embodiment the ousia, in fact, becomes ousiai, for in accord with the energeia-reveals- ousia formula, the multiplicity of the energeiai and dunameis reflect a multiplicity of ousiai. Consequently, Iamblichus speaks of the essences ( ousiai) of the soul,11 and Priscianus, following him, says:</p>
<p>“The definition of these matters is difficult because in truth the soul is one and many in essence” ( DA 14, 7–8).</p>
<p>The soul endured such paradox because of its cosmogonic function as the mean between extremes. Remaining and proceeding were essential modes of the soul’s existence, and if it were truly to function as a mean its essence could not remain stable and unchanging. The loss of the soul’s unity and stability caused it to suffer, but this was the soul’s way to participate in the activity of the Demiurge. To deny diversity to the soul would deny its role in cosmogenesis where it bestowed coherence and unity to the chaos and diversity of generated life. However, because it was a human soul with weakened measures of coherence, it experienced this demiurgy as a kind of self-alienation and dismemberment. The pppp</p>

<p>Cf. Enn. I, 1, 7, 1–7 where Plotinus says the soul does not descend but extends a “sort of light” ( tis hoios phos) to animate a body, and Enn. VI, 4, 15, 14–17, where he says the soul does not incarnate but only exudes a “warmth” ( thermasia) or “illumination” ( ellampsis) whose “trace” ( ichnos) animates the composite life. It should be noted that Iamblichus similarly states in the DM (35, 8–12) that the soul undergoes no pathos in its embodiment. However, this does not contradict the Iamblichean teachings preserved by Priscianus, for the pathos discussed at DM 35 is one imposed on the soul from without, as upon perishable creatures. Unlike them, the soul is cause of its own pathos as a composite entity ( DM 35, 11–12), and this agrees with Iamblichus’s description of the soul as autokinesis and therefore not subject to the sensible alterations of poiein/paschein ( DM 12, 6–11).</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>soul’s demiurgic unity, ironically, was available to it only through the act of self-division.</p>
<p>Among the hierarchy of immortal entities, the human soul possessed the greatest degree of “otherness” ( heterotes). This caused it to identify with what was other to itself, and the corporeal body became the context of its self-alienation. Priscianus12 says: “Our soul remains one and is multiplied at the same time in its inclination to the body; it neither remains purely nor is changed entirely, but somehow it both remains and proceeds from itself, and when it is made other to itself the sameness with itself is made faint.”13 The soul was self-alienated in embodiment,14 even to the point of having its existence constituted by its descent to the generated world,15</p>
<p>yet, as Priscianus explains, “it can never become entirely self-alienated or it would cease to be soul.”16 As Steel puts it: “the soul only remains itself because it ceaselessly proceeds from itself and, at the same time, returns to itself.”17</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s definition of the soul was received by his successors in significantly different ways. Proclus, despite following Iamblichus in his teaching that the soul descends entirely in embodiment,18</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p>I have quoted Priscianus here (and elsewhere) as paraphrasing Iamblichus’s teaching even where he does not explicitly mention Iamblichus. In the case of the doctrine that the ousia of the soul is changed in embodiment one may be sure that Priscianus is, indeed, reporting Iamblichus’s position; not only because it is explicitly attributed to Iamblichus elsewhere, but because it was clearly not the position adopted by Priscianus himself. Following Proclus, Priscianus believed that the incarnate soul was changed only on the level of its acts, not its essence.

<p>The Paradox of Embodiment</p>
<p>could not accept that the highest part of the soul, its ousia, is changed when the soul animated a body. Proclus employed Iamblichus’s own principle of mediating terms to argue that the eternal ousia of the soul cannot undergo temporal change. Using a triadic division, Proclus placed the human soul between the extremes of (a) that which is eternal in substance and activity; and (b) that which is temporal in substance and activity. The soul, therefore, was (a) and (b), that which is eternal in substance but temporal in activity.19</p>
<p>Proclus says: “every participated soul has an eternal substance but a temporal activity,”20 which seems to resolve the tension and contradiction in Iamblichus’s view by preserving the ousia of the soul from the changes endured in its energeia. Yet, in doing this, Proclus splits the soul and returns to the position of Plotinus, for what else is the soul’s eternal and unchanging ousia if not an undescended soul?</p>
<p>Damascius, on the other hand, accepted Iamblichus’s definition of the soul and explained the paradox of change in the soul’s ousia with a Pythagorean reading of Aristotle’s distinction of specific and individual identity. According to Aristotle, perishable entities such as plants and animals possess immortality and identity in their species but not as individuals ( De Anima 415b, 2–9), for any entity whose essence changes does not remain the same individual. Thus, if the human soul were changed in its essence it would lose its immortal identity. Damascius solved this dilemma by asserting that</p>
<p>“the essence of the human soul is the mean between that which endures specifically ( kat’ eidos) and that which endures individually ( kat’arithmon)” ( Dub. et Sol. II, 263, 12), which is another way of saying that the soul is both mortal and immortal.</p>
<p>According to Damascius, the Platonic definition of the soul as</p>
<p>“self-moved” ( autokinesis) led directly to the contradictions seen in Iamblichus’s position. The soul was kinesis in that its essence was</p>
<p>“moved” and endured “change,” yet it was autos in that the soul</p>
<p>“endured” the change, for change itself could have no meaning without a fixed point of reference. Self-change, however, does not mean ppp</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>that there are two parts of the soul, a stable element and a moveable element. In the De Mysteriis Iamblichus argued that the autokinesis of the soul was “a simple essential movement that subsists from itself and not in relation to another” ( DM 12, 8–9). Damascius developed this point at length in order to prove that “self-moved” ( autokinesis) indicates that “both moved and mover are the same being” ( Dub. et Sol. II, 263, 12). The soul, he says, “both changes itself and is always being changed, thus, it possesses its being precisely by always changing its own essence” ( Dub. et Sol. II, 263, 12–14).</p>
<p>The preservation of the soul’s identity in Damascius’s definition is indicated by the word “always” ( aei). Iamblichus used this term in a technical sense in his Parmenides commentary to indicate how Motion ( kinesis) and Rest ( stasis) were combined into one idea ( hen eidos) at the level of the second hypothesis ( Parm. 146a).21 In the human soul Damascius called this combination of auto-kinesis, the eidos tes huparxeos of the soul, and he again credited Iamblichus for distinguishing between huparxis—which is the principle of the soul’s determination—and ousia, which is its determined essence ( Dub. et Sol. I, 132, 12–23; cf. I, 312, 4–28). The eidos tes huparxeos of Damascius and Iamblichus was not conceived as a deeper sub-strate ( ousia) of the soul but as its pre-essence, the presence of the One that revealed itself as autokinesis, self-change. If this eidos were simply a higher essence then the changes of the soul would be accidental, not essential. The peculiar characteristic of the human soul, however, was that it preserved its identity “by always changing its own essence.”22</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Iamblichus says: “So then Motion is permanent (stationary) in the process of being in motion (for it will always be in motion), while Rest will be extended in its being at rest (for it in turn will always be at rest) inasmuch as Motion will not allow Rest to, as it were, drop off to sleep, while Rest will not permit Motion to</li>
</ol>
<p>‘jump out of its skin.’ In this way the notion of ‘always’ is essentially bound up with both being at rest and being in motion”; see In Parm., frag. 8, 13–16, in Dillon, trans., Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 218–19.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>DA 263, 13. According to Iamblichus, the huparxis of the soul was the active presence of the One, experienced by the soul in the form of “lights” ( phota) ( DM 117, 2). Pierre Hadot notes that Damascius explains huparxis etymologically as hupo +</li>

<p>The Paradox of Embodiment</p>
<p>Damascius attempted to explain this change by comparing the soul’s aetheric body to a sponge. For Damascius, as for Iamblichus, the soul’s sphericity was the sign of its illumination. Damascius says: Like a sponge, the soul loses nothing of its being but simply becomes rarefied or densified. Just so does the immortal body of the soul remain individually the same, but sometimes it is made more spherical and sometimes less, sometimes it is filled with divine light and sometimes with the stains of generative acts, and as its life undergoes some essential change so also the soul itself, while remaining what it is, is changed in itself and by itself. ( Dub.</p>
<p>et Sol. II, 255, 7–12)</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” Damascius says, “the soul is tied essentially to the Gods, sometimes to mortal creatures” ( Dub. et Sol. II, 255, 25–26), yet following Iamblichus, Damascius said it never loses its identity as soul. Like the sponge the soul could be filled with divine light and</p>
<p>“established in the essence of the sun” ( Dub. et Sol. II, 255, 7), or it could lose the light as well as its spherical shape in the darkness of generative impulses.</p>
<p>Damascius concluded that the soul cannot be split into higher and lower parts. Its autokinesis is, as Iamblichus said, haplous, “a simple essential movement” ( DM 12, 6–9), yet when the soul extends its secondary powers ( deuterai dunameis) into a corporeal body its essence divides and the soul identifies with its animated parts. Although immortal and divine, the soul becomes a mortal creature.</p>
<p>This last point is of crucial importance and is arguably Iamblichus’s raison d’être for theurgy. According to Iamblichus, it was the entire soul that changed in embodiment, both its rational and ppp</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>irrational powers, and, just as significantly, it was the entire soul that remained immortal, both its rational and irrational powers.</p>
<p>In his Phaedo commentary Damascius lists the Platonists who share this position: “Some consider immortality to extend from the rational soul as far as to the irrational soul, among the older are Xenocrates and Speusippus, of the more recent are Iamblichus and Plutarch.”23 Proclus, on the other hand, restricted immortality to the rational soul ( logismos), which was consistent with his view that only the energeiai of souls undergo change (hence mortality), not their ousiai ( In Phaed. 177, 5; trans. Westerink). This was also consistent with Proclus’s view that each soul has three vehicles ( ochemata): (1) the fleshy vehicle, (2) the pneumatic vehicle, drawn from the planetary elements, and (3) the universal and divine vehicle.24</p>
<p>For Proclus, as well as for Porphyry, only the divine body was immortal whereas the pneumatic body had a limited immortality relative to its degree of purity; when entirely purified it ceased to exist. Since Porphyry followed Plotinus in his belief that part of the soul was undescended, he held that theurgic rituals were necessary only for cleansing the lower soul and its pneumatic vehicle, for the un-descended soul would need no purification ( De regressu animae 27, 21–28, 15). Although Proclus says that the soul’s ousia was unchanged (hence, somehow undescended), he nevertheless followed Iamblichus’s view that theurgy was necessary even at the highest levels. This may indicate that he had a different conception of theurgy than Iamblichus, or that his understanding of theurgy was inconsistent with his teachings on the extent of the soul’s fall ppp</p>

<p>The Paradox of Embodiment</p>
<p>and the three ochemata.25 For Iamblichus, the pneuma of the soul could be filled with divine light, where it truly became augoeides ( DM 132, 11–13) or darkened by generative affections and lose its sphericity, yet—like Damascius’s sponge—it remained the same vehicle.26</p>
<p>Iamblichus was reluctant to separate the rational from the irrational parts of the soul: the logismos from the thumos and epithumia.</p>
<p>Again, following Aristotle, who rejected Plato’s tripartite division of the soul ( Rep. 435–41), which identified each “part” with a “place” in the body ( Tim.  69; cf. Aristotle, De Anima 414a, 29; 411b, 5), Iamblichus says the soul is a simple essence ( ousia) with several powers ( dunameis), and when it incarnates it does so as an integral whole.27</p>
<p>According to Iamblichus, Plato spoke of the soul ambivalently, sometimes defining it as “essentially tripartite” and sometimes as an</p>
<p>“undivided essence of life having many powers and properties in one identity” (see Stob. I, 368, 23–369, 2; 369, 1). Although Plato’s language varied, Iamblichus believed that Plato understood the soul to be a simple unity with three powers, and the discrepancy with Aristotle on this issue was merely semantic. Iamblichus says: “In ppp</p>

<p>Ilsetraut Hadot has attempted to make Iamblichus’s position agree with that of Proclus by reading an implicit doctrine of “three” ochemata in the De Mysteriis and the De Anima fragments: (1) the vehicle of the flesh, (2) the pneumatic vehicle</p>

<p>“relatively” immortal and subject to fate, and (3) the vehicle of the noetic soul; I.</p>
<p>Hadot, Le problème, 98–106. Dillon notes, however, that the soul subject to fate ( DM 269, 1–12) is never described as “mortal, merely that it is subject to Fate” ( Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 375). Blumenthal is correct, therefore, when he says that Proclus had “two” subtle vehicles and Iamblichus only “one” because Iamblichus held that both the rational and irrational parts of the soul were immortal while Proclus granted immortality only to the rational soul; Blumenthal, “Some Problems,” 83. I disagree with Blumenthal, however, when he says the theurgical rites relevant to the pneumatic body were the result of Iamblichus’s inability to grasp Porphyry’s views (84), and his description of theurgy as a “dubious” aid to ascend to the gods is itself dubious since Blumenthal has misconstrued theurgy as “a system for operating on the gods” (84; my emphasis).</p>

<p>short, part differs from power in that part ( meros) presents to our mind an otherness of essence ( ousias heterotes) while power ( dunamis) suggests a creative or productive distinction in the same subject.”28 For Iamblichus, the soul’s thumos, epithumia,  and logismos belonged to one immortal subject, but in embodiment they all verged to the mortal body and were rejoined with the gods only by theurgy.29</p>
