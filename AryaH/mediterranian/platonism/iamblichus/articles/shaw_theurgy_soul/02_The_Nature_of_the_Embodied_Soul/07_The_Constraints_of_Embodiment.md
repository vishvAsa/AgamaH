*The soul possesses a double life. *

Aristotle’s conception of the soul as *entelecheia* of the body may well have influenced Iamblichus more than his Platonic predecessors; the limits of the soul as conceived by Iamblichus were the limits of its mortal body. Yet despite this, Iamblichus did not limit the soul’s existence to its corporeal form, and in the *De Anima* he says that sometimes the soul is not in a body:

“The soul, of itself, possesses its own actions which, freed from the composite life \[soul-as-body\] and self-contained, activate the essential powers of the soul: enthusiasms \( *enthusiasmoi*\), immaterial intuitions \( *ahulai noeseis*\), and all those spiritual acts which join us to the Gods” \( *Stob*. I, 371, 19–24\). Iamblichus refers to an independence from the body prior to death, when the soul was “joined to the Gods” \( *Stob*. I, 371, 23–24\) by divine enthusiasms. Such activities were the concern of theurgic divination, and Iamblichus provides several examples in the *De Mysteriis* to demonstrate their authenticity. His method of proof, as in the *De Anima*, followed the *energeia-reveals -ousia formula applied to various kinds of enthousiasmos. *
*
Porphyry had challenged the authenticity of theurgic divination and suggested in his letter to Anebo that divination through dreams did not provide contact with the gods. Iamblichus responded by distinguishing ordinary dreams from those sent by the gods \( theopemptoi\) \( DM 103, 9\). Only the latter were divine and they were superior to contacts made with the gods while awake \( DM 105, 9–11; cf. Synesius, De Insomniis 151, 18–152, 1\). Iamblichus explains: 90

The Constraints of Embodiment

Since the soul possesses a double life, the one with the body and the other separate from all body, when we are awake, for the most part in our ordinary life, we make use of the life in common with the body \(except when we are somehow entirely free of it by intuiting and conceiving in pure thought\). But in sleep we are completely liberated, freed as it were, from certain bonds closely held on us, and we employ a life separated from generation. At this time, therefore, whether intellectual or divine are the same, or each one exists with its own characteristic, this kind of life is awakened in us and acts according to its nature. \( DM 106, 4–15\) Iamblichus added that since sleep liberated the soul from the body the presence of the gods was clearer \( saphesteran\) and sharper \( akribesteran\) in dreams than when awake \( DM 105, 9–11\).

Iamblichus applied the energeia- reveals -ousia formula to more dramatic forms of divination to prove that the miraculous feats of the possessed were, in fact, divine acts and not human, saying: This is the greatest proof: many are not burned even though fire is applied to them, for the fire does not touch them because of the divine inspiration. And many, though they are burned, do not respond because they are not living the life of a \[mortal\] creature.

And some, while being pierced with spits, and others, while striking their backs with sharp blades, do not feel it. Still others, while stabbing their lower arms with daggers, are completely unaware of it. Their activities \( energeiai\) are in no way human—for the inaccessible things become accessible to those possessed by a God—

and they throw themselves into fire, walk through fire, and pass through water just like the priestess at Castabalis.1 From these examples it is clear that those inspired by the Gods are not conscious of themselves; they live neither a human life nor an animal life according to sensation or impulse, but they have taken in exchange a more divine life from which they are inspired and perfectly possessed. \( DM 110, 5–111, 2\)

It may be difficult to see how such phenomena met the goals of 1. E. des Places notes that according to Strabo \(XII, 2, 7; 537 Cas.\) the priestesses of Artemis Perasia at Castabalis walked barefoot through burning coals; Jamblique: Les mystères d’Egypte, trans. and ed. E. des Places \(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1966\), 104.

Theurgy and the Soul

Platonic philosophy, but they clearly demonstrated Iamblichus’s point that the divine came to the soul from without, and this principle also explained the more subtle possessions experienced in Iamblichus’s own life.2 For example, in discussing theurgic prayer, Iamblichus says: “It \[prayer\] quietly \( erema\) lifts up the habits of our thought and bestows on us the habits of the Gods” \( DM 239, 5–

6\), for the activity, life, and habits of the theurgist exemplified the activity and life of the gods. Thus, “the soul . . . takes in exchange \( allattetai\) another life and establishes itself in another order, entirely giving up its former existence” \( DM 270, 17–19\).

Iamblichus rejected the possibility that contact with the gods was effected by the soul. He says:

If, therefore, genuine divination were the liberation of the divine part from the rest of the soul or a separation of the intellect or a sort of attainment—an intensity and effort either of activity or passivity or an acuity and application of thought or a fervor of the intellect—all such things would be awakened by our soul, and it would be correct to assume that divine inspiration \( enthousiasmos\) was a property of the soul. \( DM 115, 16–116, 4\) Iamblichus explained that if inspiration were awakened by somatic conditions it would derive from the body \( DM 116, 9–11\), and if from the soul-body conjunction it would derive from that common life \( DM 116, 11–13\). He rejected these possibilities: “Inspired action is \(derived\) neither from the body nor from the soul nor from the two combined, for these do not possess in themselves the cause of divine inspiration; for it is not the nature of superior things to be generated from those which are inferior” \( DM 116, 14–17\).

The upshot of Iamblichus’s argument is that of the soul’s two activities it was capable of performing only one: the animation of the body as its vehicle \( ochema\) and instrument \( organon\). The other activity, the inspired acts and intuitions that pertain to the soul’s essence \(cf. Stob. I, 371, 19–21\), did not derive from the soul 2. Eunapius reports that Iamblichus avoided spectacular displays of power and was accustomed to worship the divine in solitude; Eunapius, Vita Soph. 458–59, trans. W.C. Wright, Philostratus and Eunapius: The Lives of the Sophists \(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1921; reprint, 1968\), 362–65.

but from the gods who use the soul as their vehicle. Iamblichus says:

“For the act of divine inspiration is not human, nor does all its authoritative power rest in human members or actions, but these are otherwise disposed, and the God uses them as his instruments.”3

Just as the corporeal body was the instrument of the soul and depended on it to receive its “more perfect life” \( DM 25, 12–13\), so the soul was the instrument of the gods and depended on them for its perfection. This is why theurgic activities were ineffable to the soul; they completely transcended its composite life. The activities that joined the soul to the gods were accomplished by the gods themselves, and in a polemical statement that seems clearly directed to the teachings of Plotinus and Porphyry, Iamblichus says: Intellectual understanding does not connect theurgists with divine beings, for what would prevent those who philosophize theoretically from having theurgic union with the Gods? But this is not true; rather it is the perfect accomplishment of ineffable acts religiously performed and beyond all understanding, and it is the power of ineffable symbols comprehended by the Gods alone that establishes theurgical union. Thus, we don’t perform these acts intellectually for then their energy would be intellectual and depend on us, which is not at all true. In fact, these very symbols, by themselves, perform their own work, and the ineffable power of the Gods with which these symbols are charged, itself, recognizes, by itself, its own images. It is not awakened to this by our thinking.

\( DM 96, 13–97, 9\)

The actions performed in a theurgic rite were the erga of the gods actualized by an embodied soul. Participation in this action depended entirely on the soul’s “suitability” \( epitedeiotes\)4 as an organon of the gods; from a theurgic perspective, the embodied soul was a receptacle \( hupodoche\) of the god like the other receptacles used in theurgic divination.

Theurgy and the Soul

light into the soul \( photagogia\),5 theurgists used “diaphanous water”

\( DM 134, 2\), a “wall on which sacred characters are inscribed” \( DM

134, 5–6\), or “any solid place” \( DM 134, 8\), to enable the soul to receive the light and see the “will of the gods” \( DM 132, 15\). Lest Porphyry misunderstand the purpose of using ritual objects to effect this reception, Iamblichus explained that the sign of genuine theurgy was the manifestation of divine characteristics in the habits of a soul,6 an explanation that is similar to a theory of embodiment reported by Iamblichus in De Anima:

The Platonists around \[Calvenus\] Taurus say that souls are sent to earth by the Gods. Some, following the Timaeus \[39e, 41b\] teach that it is for the perfection of the universe, that there be as many living things in the \[sensible\] world as in the intelligible. Others think the purpose of the soul’s descent is to reveal the divine life, for this is the will of the Gods: to be revealed through souls. For the Gods come forth into bodily appearance and reveal themselves in the pure and faultless life of souls. \( Stob. I, 378, 25–379, 6\) As a receptacle of the gods, the soul reflected their activity and habits \( DM 239, 5–6; 176, 10–13\). These were symptoms of theurgic exchange, and because of this Iamblichus vigorously condemned any attempt to perform a theurgic invocation for selfish reasons \( DM 115–16\). Although “ineffable symbols” and not “our thinking”

established theurgical union \( DM 97–98\), Iamblichus believed that the power of these symbols could not be tapped without the moral and intellectual preparation of the theurgist. For “ineffable acts” to be “perfectly accomplished” they had to be “religiously performed”

\( DM 96, 17–19\). In other words although the intellectual effort of the soul was not sufficient to effect a theurgic union, it was a necessary auxiliary \( DM 98, 8–10\).

In his letter to Anebo, Porphyry implied that theurgic rites attempted to manipulate the gods and that theurgists stood on 5. Photos agogia, the “leading” or “gathering up” of “light” is the rubric under which Iamblichus includes various kinds of divination.

6. DM 239, 5–6. Iamblichus maintained that the soul’s illumination was not produced by a mechanical manipulation of images in mirrors or water \( DM 94, 3–5; 174, 10–11\). Such phenomena were psychic and unworthy of the gods.

The Constraints of Embodiment

magical characters \( charakteres\) to impose their will on the gods.

Iamblichus replied that any attempt to control the gods was the antithesis of theurgy:

When you say “those who stand on characters” you have put your finger on nothing less than the cause of all evils concerning theurgic invocations. For certain persons, disdaining the entire task of completing their theoretic knowledge about the one who invokes and the overseer,7 and disregarding the order of the ritual and the most sacred and extensive perseverance in labors over a long period of time, reject sacred laws and prayers and other holy preparations and believe that standing on characters alone is sufficient.

Having done this for an hour, they think that a spirit will enter.

Such reckless men fail to accomplish anything and are not worthy to be counted among diviners. \( DM 131, 3–132, 2\) Others, Iamblichus says, were less fortunate:

All those who are offensive and who awkwardly leap after divine mysteries in a disordered way are not able to associate with the Gods due to the slackness of their energy or deficiency of their power. And on account of certain defilements they are excluded from the presence of pure spirits but are joined to evil spirits and are filled by them with the worst possession. They become wicked and unholy and, being glutted with undisciplined pleasures and filled with evil, they affect habits foreign to the gods. \( DM 176, 13–

177, 4\)

The equation of theurgy with ex opere operato activity, therefore, must be qualified. Following the Neoplatonic principle that like can only be joined to like, the theurgist had to purify the future vehicle of the god in order to receive its power, for the presence of the god was always in proportion to the purity of its receptacle.

Epitedeiotes was the term Iamblichus used to describe the “fitness”

or “aptitude” to receive a form. Coined in the second century c.e. to describe the kind of Aristotelian “potency” \( dunamis\) sufficient for ppp

7. While the union with the gods was purely theurgical, the preparation for theurgy demanded a theoretical knowledge of the gods and ritual procedures; cf.

DM 267, 5ff.

Theurgy and the Soul

“actualization” \( energeia\) of a form,8 epitedeiotes came to be used by Neoplatonists to account for differences in mystical experience.9 Just as “dry wood” provided the capacity \( epitedeiotes\) for fire to be actualized,10 so, analogously, the purity of a soul provided the capacity for a god to become manifest. Plotinus accounted for different experiences of souls in the presence of the Intelligible as follows: “One must understand the \[degree of\] presence as something depending on the fitness \( epitedeiotes\) of the recipient” \( Enn. VI, 4, 11, 3–4\), and he compared it to the reception of light in clear or muddy water \(9–

10\). For Iamblichus also, epitedeiotes described the fitness of a passive element to receive the influence of an active one, regardless of spatial distance or proximity.11

Epitedeiotes was a component in every theurgy, which is why the mere performance of ritual acts could not join the soul to the gods.

Although the gods were everywhere \( DM 27, 9\), their powers could not affect souls that lacked an appropriate receptacle. Only when the vehicle was prepared could divine possession occur. Iamblichus says:

“Whenever terrestrial things—which possess their being from the totalities of the Gods—become fit for divine participation they immediately possess, prior to their own essence, the Gods who preexist in it” \( DM 28, 20–29, 3\). Consequently, Iamblichus explained that the authority of the oracles at Delphi, Colophon, and Branchidae was not caused by the places themselves but by the careful purification of their oracular vehicles, making them “fit” \( epitedeiotes\) to give voice to the god \( DM 125, 5–127, 9\). Similar purifications were necessary for every soul. Iamblichus says, for example, 8. See S. Sambursky, The Physical World of Late Antiquity \(New York: Basic Books, 1962\), 106.

The Constraints of Embodiment

that “the time one spends in prayer nourishes the intuitive mind and greatly enlarges the soul’s receptacles for the Gods.”12 The soul itself was a receptacle of the gods, and in Iamblichus’s response to Porphyry’s questions about famous oracular shrines he makes it clear that it is the purity of the receiving soul—not the geographical place—that allows for divine possessions, including those experienced privately by every theurgist.13 To equate this “possession” with the spiritualist phenomena of the late nineteenth and early twenti-eth century, as Dodds has done, is misleading.14 For the spiritualist was no more a theurgist than was the fourth-century goes, and although all of them share superficial similarities, the purposes of theurgy were altogether different.

12. DM 238, 17–239, 1. Iamblichus almost always employs epitedeiotes in the De Mysteriis to describe the soul’s “readiness” for divine transformation: 105, 1 to describe conditions of the soul that are “fit” to receive the god; 125, 5 to describe the cleansing of the soul to make it “fit” and 127, 9 explicitly for the reception of a god; 233, 1, the matter sent from the Demiurge is described as “fit” to connect the soul with the gods; in 207, 10–15, however, epitedeiotes is described in a purely physical way, not theurgic.

Iamblichus’s explanation should have been sufficient to deter this interpretation; see DM 93, 10–95, 14; esp. 95, 10–12.
