  <blockquote>
<p><em>One must take into account the</em><br>
<em>differences between the universal</em><br>
<em>soul and our own…</em></p></blockquote>
<h2 id="gnostic-context">Gnostic context</h2>
<p>Iamblichus’s teachings on the soul<br>
were an essential correlate to his theurgical system,<br>
yet to be understood properly<br>
they must be seen in the context of alternative developments in Platonic schools<br>
from the second to the fourth century c.e.<br>
Iamblichus’s emphasis on the descent of the soul<br>
was a response to what he perceived as unorthodox and dualistic forms of Platonism.<br>
The most significant in Iamblichus’s era<br>
was the Gnostics’ reversal of the Platonic creation myth<br>
and their reinterpretation of the Demiurge and World Soul.+++(4)+++<br>
Though Gnostics drew their dramatis personae from Jewish myths,<br>
their cosmological framework was taken from Plato’s <em>Timaeus</em>,<br>
and to some degree from the <em>Phaedo</em> and <em>Phaedrus</em>.</p>
<p>For the Gnostics, creation was no longer the beneficent expression of the Demiurge<br>
but the result of primal sin and error.<br>
The sensible world was a maleficent prison,<br>
and the orders of the heavens,<br>
which for Plato served as media for a return to the divine,<br>
were transformed into spiritual oppressors<br>
who held souls captive in matter.+++(5)+++<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>ppp</p>
<p>[[67]]</p>
<p>This inverted mythology may have been rooted in Jewish apocalypticism,<br>
but it came to influence Platonists of the third century.</p>
<p>There were several gnosticizing Platonists in attendance at Plotinus’s lectures,<br>
and the second-century Platonist, Numenius, had already explained the myth of the <em>Timaeus</em><br>
in a manner similar to the Gnostics by asserting a secondary Demiurge<br>
who <em>falls</em> into Nature and<br>
whose longing for release is reflected in the drama of human suffering.<br>
The Hermetic <em>Poimandres</em> is another example of a gnosticizing Platonism<br>
where creation is portrayed as the result of an error or fall.</p>
<p>Hans Lewy contends that these remythologizings of the <em>Timaeus</em><br>
were attempts to improve on a myth that failed to provide satisfactory answers to the problem of evil and human suffering.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The obvious appeal of Gnostic dualism was its dramatic clarity<br>
and the solution it offered through gnosis.+++(5)+++<br>
Gnostics promised salvation to those who felt dominated by foreign and insensitive rulers, social as well as cosmic.<br>
Although Iamblichus never explicitly argues against the Gnostics,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><br>
his description of the soul, as well as his theurgical system,<br>
were surely influenced by the Platonic-Gnostic debate,<br>
particularly as it was taken up by Iamblichus’s predecessor Plotinus.</p>
<h2 id="plotinuss-response">Plotinus&rsquo;s response</h2>
<p>Plotinus’s arguments against the Gnostics, and the solutions he suggests for the problems of the embodied soul<br>
provide the appropriate context to evaluate Iamblichus’s position.</p>
<p>In his <em>Treatise Against the Gnostics</em> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><br>
Plotinus charged that the Gnostics failed to differentiate between the ontological levels of the World Soul, which is a whole, and individual souls, which are parts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Gnostics with whom Plotinus and Iamblichus were familiar were</p>
<p>[[68]]</p>
<p>Contrasting the respected teachings of the Ancients ( <em>palaioi</em>)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and Plato with those of the Gnostics, Plotinus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They [the Gnostics] blame the soul for its association with the body<br>
and censure the director of this universe and<br>
identify its maker with the soul,<br>
and attribute to this universal soul the same affections<br>
as those which the souls in parts of the universe have [ <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 6, 59–63; trans. Armstrong]. . . .</p>
<p>But to apply conclusions drawn from our soul to the Soul of the All<br>
is as if somebody were to take the tribe of potters or smiths in a well-ordered city<br>
and make them a reason for blaming the whole.<br>
But one must take into account the differences between the universal soul and ours,<br>
in its management of the body;<br>
it does not direct it in the same way,<br>
and is not bound to it. ( <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 7, 5–9)</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Plotinus,<br>
the Gnostics projected their psychological condition on the cosmos<br>
and shifted the burden for their suffering to the Demiurge and his astral regents.+++(5)+++<br>
In other words, they mistakenly took the “part,” the particular soul, for the “whole,” the World Soul.<br>
The cause for this, Plotinus argued,<br>
was the Gnostics’ attempt to go beyond their capacities as individual souls and “set themselves up next to god” ( <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 9, 48).<br>
This was nothing more than wishful thinking ( <em>hosper oneirasi petesthai</em>; <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 9, 49), Plotinus said,<br>
and it diverted their souls from making the only possible ascent to the gods,<br>
realized not by rejecting the stars and World Soul<br>
but by imitating them as much as possible ( <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 18, 31–35).+++(5)+++<br>
The cause for evil and the suffering of the soul<br>
did not come from the World Soul or its regents<br>
but from the inability of the individual soul<br>
to harmonize itself with the ordered movements of the whole.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>[[69]]</p>
<p>Plotinus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If any of the parts of the universe is moved according to its nature,<br>
the parts with whose nature the movement is not in accord suffer,<br>
but those which are moved go on well,<br>
as parts of the whole;<br>
but the others are destroyed because they are not able to endure the order of the whole.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>+++(4)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>Iamblichus would have agreed with Plotinus’s distinction between universal and individual souls.<br>
It was a position argued by Iamblichus himself—<br>
probably with some degree of irony—<br>
in his defense of theurgy against Plotinus’s pupil, Porphyry.<br>
Yet the basis for Porphyry’s reversal of this teaching<br>
probably lay in the thinking of Plotinus himself<br>
who, apart from his distaste for Gnostic views,<br>
had never found a satisfactory answer for the cause of human suffering and evil.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In his treatise on the descent of souls into bodies ( <em>Enn</em>. IV, 8)<br>
Plotinus followed Platonic tradition by contrasting the somatic experience of partial souls ( <em>para meros</em>) ( <em>Enn</em>. IV, 8, 7, 24),<br>
who move gradually from embodied confusion to tranquility,<br>
with the Soul of the All ( <em>tou pantos</em>; <em>Enn</em>. IV, 8, 7, 27), which is never distressed and remains in the divine world.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Plotinus then admittedly diverged from Platonic doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And if one may be so bold as to express more clearly <em>one’s own conviction against the common opinion of others</em>,<br>
even our soul has not sunk entirely,<br>
but there is always something of it in the Intelligible World.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>In his later <em>Enneads</em> <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Plotinus continued to maintain this opinion<br>
and denied that the soul completely descends into a body.<br>
Describing “descent” as an “illumination” he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the inclination ( <em>neusis</em>) is an illumination ( <em>ellampsis</em>) to what is below it is not a sin;<br>
what is illuminated is responsible,<br>
for if it did not exist<br>
the soul would have nowhere to illuminate.<br>
The soul is said to go down ( <em>katabainein</em>) or decline ( <em>neuein</em>) in the sense that the thing which receives the light from it lives with it. ( <em>Enn</em>. I, 1, 12, 25–29; trans. Armstrong)</p></blockquote>
<p>70</p>
<p>Plotinus’s position betrays the influence of the Gnostic myth of Sophia’s fall,<br>
which he had condemned in his <em>Treatise Against the</em> <em>Gnostics</em>.<br>
There he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It [Sophia] did not come down itself, did not decline ( <em>me katelthein</em>) but only <em>illuminated</em> the darkness ( <em>ellampsai monon to skoto</em>)<br>
and so an image from it came into existence in matter” ( <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 10, 25–27; trans. Armstrong [modified]).</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="iamblichuss-rejection">Iamblichus&rsquo;s rejection</h2>
<p>The undescended soul of Plotinus<br>
exhibits the same traits<br>
and is described with the same metaphors as the Gnostics’ Sophia.<br>
These similarities cannot prove that Plotinus’s doctrine of the undescended soul<br>
was influenced by Gnostics,<br>
but Plotinus himself admitted<br>
that his view was unorthodox<br>
and it was condemned by nearly all post-Iamblichean Platonists.</p>
<p>The problem Plotinus was attempting to solve<br>
with his doctrine of the undescended soul<br>
was how to account for the soul’s suffering and experience of evil.<br>
His solution, that the soul never really descends into a body,<br>
proved unsatisfactory to anyone faced with the reality of suffering.<br>
According to Iamblichus,<br>
the answer could be reached<br>
only by first understanding the nature of the soul as embodied.<br>
After one gained a proper grasp of the soul’s condition,<br>
its activities could be redirected into theurgic rites<br>
that transformed the passions of the soul into divine actions.<br>
For Iamblichus the pain of embodiment<br>
was not dismissed<br>
but ritually transformed into an act of cosmogenesis.</p>
<p>In strictly Platonic terms<br>
the <em>novum</em> for Plotinus<br>
was his view of the soul as undescended,<br>
which may have been influenced by his encounter with Gnostics;<br>
for Iamblichus it was ritual theurgy.<br>
Why Iamblichus felt that theurgy was more consonant with Platonic teachings<br>
may be made clearer against the following outline of Plotinus’s debate with the Gnostics.</p>
<h2 id="suffering">Suffering</h2>
<p>The three positions on the suffering of the embodied soul represent the views of</p>
<p>(1) the Gnostics,<br>
(2) Plotinus’s counter position, and<br>
(3) Plotinus’s later views on the soul: 71</p>
<ol>
<li>Gnostics (as described in <em>Ennead</em> II, 9)</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) The suffering of individual souls is due to the fall of the World Soul.</p>
<p>(b) Individual souls (collectively) = the World Soul.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Plotinus (A) (against the Gnostics)</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) The suffering of individual souls is <em>not</em> due to the fall of the World Soul because the World Soul cannot fall [ <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 7, 9–19].<br>
The relation of individual souls to their bodies includes a temporary period of suffering and confusion [ <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 7ff.], which can be overcome by education and an increasing mimesis of the gods [ <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 18, 32–35].</p>
<p>(b) The World Soul <em>is not equal to</em> the sum of individual souls</p>
<p>[ <em>Enn</em>. II, 9, 8, 36–39].</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Plotinus (B)</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) The World Soul does not fall and neither do individual souls.</p>
<p>The suffering of individual souls, therefore,<br>
is merely the suffering of their “images”;<br>
in truth, individual souls remain above, at the level of the World Soul.</p>
<p>(b) The World Soul = unfallen individual souls.</p>
<p>Iamblichus believed that the Gnostics and Plotinus (B) erred by confusing ontological levels.<br>
To account for the experience of suffering,<br>
the Gnostics confused the part with the whole<br>
and interpreted the condition of the World Soul as if it were an individual soul.<br>
Plotinus (B) erred no less, but in the opposite way:<br>
he raised the part (the individual soul) to the level of the whole (the World Soul),<br>
perpetually unfallen.<br>
In contrast, theurgy may be seen to be in agreement with the principles of Plotinus (A).<br>
For Iamblichus, the problem of human suffering had to be solved<br>
without changing the ontological status of the soul.</p>
<h2 id="threefold-soul">Threefold soul</h2>
<p>Iamblichus’s view of the embodied soul<br>
was influenced by the Pythagorean principle of the “mean.”<br>
Explaining this principle in mathematic terms Iamblichus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If the Many is conceived as a triad<br>
and that opposed to the Many is conceived as a monad,<br>
the dyad would be a borderland between them. Therefore, <em>the dyad</em> [[72]] <em>possesses the characteristics of both</em>.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> +++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>Iamblichus held that every realm of being followed this law and Proclus applied Iamblichus’s principle of the “mean” to the <em>nous</em> and soul in <em>Timaeus</em> 37e, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“he (Iamblichus) takes issue<br>
with those who connect the soul directly with the Absolute Intelligence<br>
(for the transition from the transcendent to the participating should not be immediate,<br>
but there should be as media<br>
those essences which are combined with things that participate).”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Following the law of the mean,<br>
every hypostasis had three expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) unparticipated ( <em>to amethekton</em>);</li>
<li>(2) participated ( <em>to metechomenon</em>); and</li>
<li>(3) participating ( <em>to</em> <em>metechon</em>), at every level of the cosmos.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>De Mysteriis</em> Iamblichus used a threefold distinction of souls according to wholes and parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conflict of views in the issue at hand<br>
may easily be solved by demonstrating<br>
the transcendence of wholes with respect to parts<br>
and by recalling the exempt transcendence of the Gods with respect to men.<br>
For example, I mean that the entire corporeal world is ruled by [a] <em>the World Soul</em>,<br>
and that the celestial body is presided over by [b] <em>the Celestial Gods</em>,<br>
nor is there injury in their reception nor impediment to their intellection;<br>
on the other hand, both these ills exist for [c] <em>the individual soul</em> in communion with a body. ( <em>DM</em> 200, 1–10)</p></blockquote>
<p>73</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s celestial gods (souls) mediate between the World Soul and individual souls.<br>
Like the dyad in the mathematical example, celestial gods are the “borderland” ( <em>metaichmion</em>)<br>
between the exempt wholeness and unity of the World Soul<br>
and the multiplicity and division of individual souls.<br>
Celestial souls possess the characteristics of their extremes:<br>
like the World Soul they exist in noetic perfection,<br>
never departing from their pure condition,<br>
but like individual souls,<br>
they each possess a single and moving body.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Iamblichus believed that the perfection of an individual soul occurred<br>
only through its return to the celestial orders,<br>
and through them, to the Demiurge (Cf. <em>DM</em> 292, 5–18)+++(4)+++.</p>
<p>This was an elaboration of the Platonic teaching that<br>
the ratios of the embodied soul,<br>
twisted at birth,<br>
were identical to the ratios revealed in the heavens ( *Tim. * 90cd).<br>
Indeed, what distinguished the theurgical Platonism of Iamblichus<br>
from the “exalted soul” Platonism of Plotinus<br>
was its interpretation of how the soul attained its celestial identity.<br>
Unlike Plotinus, Iamblichus maintained a need for mediation<br>
and a triadic distinction of souls,<br>
as seen in his description of their appearances in rites of divination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]f the soul is universal and does not belong to any particular species,<br>
it appears as a formless fire<br>
revealing—through the whole world—the total, one, indivisible, and formless Soul of the World.</p></blockquote>
<p>But a purified soul [i.e., like the stars] exhibits a fiery form<br>
and a pure unmingled fire,<br>
its inner light and form appear to be pure and stable,<br>
and it follows in the company of its anagogic Leader,<br>
rejoicing in his good will<br>
while revealing its own rank through its activities.</p>
<p>But the soul which verges downward<br>
drags with it the signs of bonds and punishments,<br>
is weighed down with the conflicts of material spirits,<br>
is possessed by irregular troubles of matter,<br>
and appears to have placed before itself the authority of generative <em>Daimones</em> ( <em>DM</em> 84, 6–20).</p>
<p>The mediating entities in this schema are described as purified souls instead of celestial.<br>
Since theurgists were able to attain the spherical purity of the celestial gods while still living a mortal life (Cf. <em>DM</em> 41, 4–11),<br>
their souls, <em>qua</em> theurgic, were equal to these divinities.<br>
According to Iamblichus they were “seated in the order of [[74]] the angels,”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><br>
and their appearance provided corporeal souls with “sacred hope” ( <em>DM</em> 83, 4–5) to attain salvation.<br>
The angelic soul of the theurgist<br>
was the functional equivalent of Plotinus’s undescended soul,<br>
yet the realization of this divine status<br>
was explained by the two Platonists in strongly contrasting terms.+++(5)+++<br>
For Iamblichus, the theurgist attained this rank through ritual practices<br>
and a demiurgic assimilation of all the powers that he encountered in embodiment.<br>
For Plotinus, it was less an assimilation of cosmic powers<br>
than a realization that the soul,<br>
as undescended, somehow never really encountered them.</p>
<p>This admittedly portrays a distorted picture of Plotinus’s view of the soul<br>
and its relation with the <em>Nous</em>.<br>
We should remember that Iamblichus’s portrayal of Plotinus’s views was polemical.<br>
While it is true that Plotinus does speak of the soul as undescended<br>
and as possessing a continued contact with the <em>Nous</em>,<br>
he also says that <em>Nous</em> transcends the soul’s discursive awareness ( <em>Enn</em>. V, 3, 3, 22–28).<br>
“The <em>Nous</em>,” he says, “is ours <em>and</em> not ours” ( <em>Enn</em>. V, 3, 3, 27–28),<br>
so there is a tension in Plotinus’s position<br>
that Iamblichus does not sufficiently take into account.</p>
<h2 id="choice">Choice</h2>
<p>For both Plotinus and Iamblichus,<br>
the background to their views on the soul’s apotheosis was the <em>Phaedrus</em> (246–48)<br>
where Plato describes the celestial circuit of the gods<br>
and the vain effort of human souls to imitate them.</p>
<p>Due to the unruly character of one of his steeds<br>
the charioteer of the soul cannot follow the gods and falls into a body.<br>
Since Plotinus denied that this fall was complete,<br>
he had to explain why the soul identifies with the body<br>
if—as he also maintained—evil only occurs to the soul<br>
through its association with the body ( <em>Enn</em>. I, 8, 15, 12–21).</p>
<p>Iamblichus criticized Plotinus’s position and the contradiction it posed<br>
with regard to the soul’s experience of suffering. Proclus reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The divine Iamblichus is quite correct, therefore,<br>
in attacking those who hold this opinion [that there is something of the soul which does not fall],<br>
for what element in us is it that sins<br>
when the unreasoning principle in us is stirred,<br>
and we chase after a lawless [[75]] notion?<br>
Is it not our free will ( <em>prohairesis</em>)?<br>
And how would it not be this?<br>
For it is by reason of this<br>
that we differ from those beings that follow impressions without reflection.</p>
<p>If the free will sins, then how would the soul remain sinless? . . .<br>
And what is the Charioteer of the soul?<br>
Is it not the noblest, and, one might say, con-summate part of us?<br>
And how can we avoid this conclusion,<br>
if indeed this is what directs our whole being<br>
and with its own head views the supracelestial sphere<br>
and is assimilated to the “great leader” of the gods,<br>
who “drives a winged chariot” and “journeys through the heaven as a first” charioteer?<br>
And if the charioteer is the highest element in us,<br>
and he, as is said in the <em>Phaedrus</em>,<br>
sometimes is carried up aloft and raises “his head into the region outside,”<br>
while at other times he descends and (fills his pair) with lameness and moulting,<br>
<em>it plainly follows that the highest element in us experiences different states at different times</em>.14</p></blockquote>
<p>The agent of the soul’s descent was <em>prohairesis</em>, its “free will,” “choice,” or “disposition.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> In his letter on fate Iamblichus again used this term to account for different conditions in human life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why, you ask, are goods undeservedly distributed?<br>
Rather, to begin with, is it not impious even to ask this?<br>
For the goods of life do not depend on anything else<br>
but on man himself and on man’s choice ( <em>hairesis</em>),<br>
and the most important goods are determined by free-will ( <em>prohairesis</em>) alone.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>For Iamblichus <em>prohairesis</em> was neutral.<br>
It verged to what was better or worse<br>
and its choices were a reflection of the character of the soul.<br>
In some sense the soul was its <em>prohairesis</em>, at least with respect to its spiritual condition,<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><br>
and if its <em>prohairesis</em> determined the quality of its life,<br>
then for the soul to change—for better or worse—it had to change its <em>prohairesis</em>.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>This is why Iamblichus says that<br>
theurgy did not act through the intellect<br>
but through one’s entire character<br>
to allow the soul to exchange one life for another,<br>
to sacrifice its mortal life for the life of a god.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Theurgy transformed the soul’s <em>prohairesis</em><br>
by conforming it to the divine <em>actions</em> communicated in theurgic symbols:<br>
the sacred stones, plants, animals, prayers ( <em>DM</em> 48, 5–6), and names ( <em>DM</em> 255, 4–15; 157, 13–16) that “preserve the <em>will</em> of the gods” (cf. <em>DM</em> 209, 14–17).</p>

<p>Recent scholarship has shown that this anticosmic characterization of Gnosticism, while generally accurate, is not universally applicable. The tractate <em>Marsanes</em> ( *Nag Hammadi * Codices [ <em>NHC</em>] 10, 1), for example, presents a monistic view of the cosmos fully in line with Plato’s <em>Timaeus</em> (see esp. <em>Marsanes</em> 5, 17–26).

<p>The only extant evidence of Iamblichus’s familiarity with the Gnostics is in his doxography of the descent of the soul in the <em>De Anima</em>. “According to the Gnostics,” Iamblichus says, “the soul descends because of derangement ( <em>paranoia</em>) or deviation ( <em>parekbasis</em>)”; <em>Stob</em>.
