Iamblichus’s teachings on the soul were an essential correlate to his theurgical system, yet to be understood properly they must be seen in the context of alternative developments in Platonic schools from the second to the fourth century c.e. Iamblichus’s emphasis on the descent of the soul was a response to what he perceived as unorthodox and dualistic forms of Platonism. The most significant in Iamblichus’s era was the Gnostics’ reversal of the Platonic creation myth and their reinterpretation of the Demiurge and World Soul. Though Gnostics drew their dramatis personae from Jewish myths, their cosmological framework was taken from Plato’s *Timaeus*, and to some degree from the *Phaedo* and *Phaedrus*. For the Gnostics, creation was no longer the beneficent expression of the Demiurge but the result of primal sin and error. The sensible world was a maleficent prison, and the orders of the heavens, which for Plato served as media for a return to the divine, were transformed into spiritual oppressors who held souls captive in matter.1

1. Recent scholarship has shown that this anticosmic characterization of Gnosticism, while generally accurate, is not universally applicable. The tractate *Marsanes* \( *Nag Hammadi * Codices \[ *NHC*\] 10, 1\), for example, presents a monistic view of the cosmos fully in line with Plato’s *Timaeus* \(see esp. *Marsanes* 5, 17–26\). For a discussion of *Marsanes* and its relation to Platonism, see Birger Pearson, “Gnosticism as Platonism: With Special Reference to Marsanes \( *NHC* 10, 1\),” *Harvard Theological* *Review* 77, no. 1 \(1984\): 55–72. Pearson shows in this article that certain Gnostic ideas influenced and informed later Platonic thought \(17\). Cf. Pearson, “The Tractate Marsanes \( *NHC* X\) and the Platonic Tradition,” in *Gnosis: Festschrift für Hans* *Jonas*, ed. Barbara Aland \(Göttingen: Vandenhoech and Ruprecht, 1978\), 373–84.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

This inverted mythology may have been rooted in Jewish apocalyp-ticism, but it came to influence Platonists of the third century.

There were several gnosticizing Platonists in attendance at Plotinus’s lectures, and the second-century Platonist, Numenius, had already explained the myth of the *Timaeus* in a manner similar to the Gnostics by asserting a secondary Demiurge who *falls* into Nature and whose longing for release is reflected in the drama of human suffering. The Hermetic *Poimandres* is another example of a gnosticizing Platonism where creation is portrayed as the result of an error or fall.

Hans Lewy contends that these remythologizings of the *Timaeus* were attempts to improve on a myth that failed to provide satisfactory answers to the problem of evil and human suffering.2 The obvious appeal of Gnostic dualism was its dramatic clarity and the solution it offered through gnosis. Gnostics promised salvation to those who felt dominated by foreign and insensitive rulers, social as well as cosmic. Although Iamblichus never explicitly argues against the Gnostics,3 his description of the soul, as well as his theurgical system, were surely influenced by the Platonic-Gnostic debate, particularly as it was taken up by Iamblichus’s predecessor Plotinus.

Plotinus’s arguments against the Gnostics, and the solutions he suggests for the problems of the embodied soul provide the appropriate context to evaluate Iamblichus’s position.

In his *Treatise Against the Gnostics* 4 Plotinus charged that the Gnostics failed to differentiate between the ontological levels of the World Soul, which is a whole, and individual souls, which are parts.

3. The only extant evidence of Iamblichus’s familiarity with the Gnostics is in his doxography of the descent of the soul in the *De Anima*. “According to the Gnostics,” Iamblichus says, “the soul descends because of derangement \( *paranoia*\) or deviation \( *parekbasis*\)”; *Stob*. I, 375, 9.

4. *Enn*. II, 9 is listed as thirty-third in the chronology of Plotinus’s writings.

Contrasting the respected teachings of the Ancients \( *palaioi*\)5 and Plato with those of the Gnostics, Plotinus says:

They \[the Gnostics\] blame the soul for its association with the body and censure the director of this universe and identify its maker with the soul, and attribute to this universal soul the same affections as those which the souls in parts of the universe have

\[ *Enn*. II, 9, 6, 59–63; trans. Armstrong\]. . . . But to apply conclusions drawn from our soul to the Soul of the All is as if somebody were to take the tribe of potters or smiths in a well-ordered city and make them a reason for blaming the whole. But one must take into account the differences between the universal soul and ours, in its management of the body; it does not direct it in the same way, and is not bound to it. \( *Enn*. II, 9, 7, 5–9\) According to Plotinus, the Gnostics projected their psychological condition on the cosmos and shifted the burden for their suffering to the Demiurge and his astral regents. In other words, they mistakenly took the “part,” the particular soul, for the “whole,” the World Soul. The cause for this, Plotinus argued, was the Gnostics’ attempt to go beyond their capacities as individual souls and “set themselves up next to god” \( *Enn*. II, 9, 9, 48\). This was nothing more than wishful thinking \( *hosper oneirasi petesthai*; *Enn*. II, 9, 9, 49\), Plotinus said, and it diverted their souls from making the only possible ascent to the gods, realized not by rejecting the stars and World Soul but by imitating them as much as possible \( *Enn*. II, 9, 18, 31–35\). The cause for evil and the suffering of the soul did not come from the World Soul or its regents but from the inability of the individual soul to harmonize itself with the ordered movements of the whole.

Plotinus says: “If any of the parts of the universe is moved according to its nature, the parts with whose nature the movement is not in accord suffer, but those which are moved go on well, as parts of the ppp

5. It is interesting that Plotinus refers to the authority of the “Ancients”

\( *palaioi*\) \( *Enn*. II, 9, 6\) over against the *new* opinions of the Gnostics, for Iamblichus refers to the “Ancients” in the *De Anima* in contrast to the views of Numenius \(and possibly Plotinus\) \( *Stob*. I, 458\).

*Theurgy and the Soul*

whole; but the others are destroyed because they are not able to endure the order of the whole.”6

Iamblichus would have agreed with Plotinus’s distinction between universal and individual souls. It was a position argued by Iamblichus himself—probably with some degree of irony—in his defense of theurgy against Plotinus’s pupil, Porphyry. Yet the basis for Porphyry’s reversal of this teaching probably lay in the thinking of Plotinus himself who, apart from his distaste for Gnostic views, had never found a satisfactory answer for the cause of human suffering and evil.7

In his treatise on the descent of souls into bodies \( *Enn*. IV, 8\) Plotinus followed Platonic tradition by contrasting the somatic experience of partial souls \( *para meros*\) \( *Enn*. IV, 8, 7, 24\), who move gradually from embodied confusion to tranquility, with the Soul of the All \( *tou pantos*; *Enn*. IV, 8, 7, 27\), which is never distressed and remains in the divine world. Plotinus then admittedly diverged from Platonic doctrine: “And if one may be so bold as to express more clearly *one’s own conviction against the common opinion of others*, even our soul has not sunk entirely, but there is always something of it in the Intelligible World.”8 In his later *Enneads* 9

Plotinus continued to maintain this opinion and denied that the soul completely descends into a body. Describing “descent” as an

“illumination” he says:

If the inclination \( *neusis*\) is an illumination \( *ellampsis*\) to what is below it is not a sin; what is illuminated is responsible, for if it did not exist the soul would have nowhere to illuminate. The soul is said to go down \( *katabainein*\) or decline \( *neuein*\) in the sense that 6. *Enn*. II, 9, 9, 33–36. This is essentially the same argument that Iamblichus employs. Like Plotinus \(II, 9, 9, 37–40\), Iamblichus uses the analogy of a “dance” to account for evil, though in a slightly different manner \( *DM* 56, 7–15\).

7. See E.R. Dodds *, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety* \(New York: Norton, 1965\), 24–26; R.T. Wallis, *Neoplatonism* \(London: Duckworth, 1972\), 76–79.

8. *Enn*. IV, 8, 8, 1–4; cf. *Enn*. IV, 3, 12, 1–5 where Plotinus says that although the soul descends, its “head” remains above in heaven; cf. *Enn*. I, 1 where Plotinus portrays the higher soul as undescended.

9. Following the accepted chronology, the treatise on the descent of souls is early in the Plotinus corpus, no. 6 of 54; *Enn*. IV, 3, 12 is no. 27, and *Enn*. I, 1 is no. 53, next to the last in the corpus.

the thing which receives the light from it lives with it. \( *Enn*. I, 1, 12, 25–29; trans. Armstrong\)

Plotinus’s position betrays the influence of the Gnostic myth of Sophia’s fall, which he had condemned in his *Treatise Against the* *Gnostics*. There he says: “It \[Sophia\] did not come down itself, did not decline \( *me katelthein*\) but only *illuminated* the darkness \( *ellampsai monon to skoto*\) and so an image from it came into existence in matter” \( *Enn*. II, 9, 10, 25–27; trans. Armstrong \[modified\]\).

The undescended soul of Plotinus exhibits the same traits and is described with the same metaphors as the Gnostics’ Sophia. These similarities cannot prove that Plotinus’s doctrine of the undescended soul was influenced by Gnostics, but Plotinus himself admitted that his view was unorthodox and it was condemned by nearly all post-Iamblichean Platonists.

The problem Plotinus was attempting to solve with his doctrine of the undescended soul was how to account for the soul’s suffering and experience of evil. His solution, that the soul never really descends into a body, proved unsatisfactory to anyone faced with the reality of suffering. According to Iamblichus, the answer could be reached only by first understanding the nature of the soul as embodied. After one gained a proper grasp of the soul’s condition, its activities could be redirected into theurgic rites that transformed the passions of the soul into divine actions. For Iamblichus the pain of embodiment was not dismissed but ritually transformed into an act of cosmogenesis.

In strictly Platonic terms the *novum* for Plotinus was his view of the soul as undescended, which may have been influenced by his encounter with Gnostics; for Iamblichus it was ritual theurgy. Why Iamblichus felt that theurgy was more consonant with Platonic teachings may be made clearer against the following outline of Plotinus’s debate with the Gnostics. The three positions on the suffering of the embodied soul represent the views of \(1\) the Gnostics, \(2\) Plotinus’s counter position, and \(3\) Plotinus’s later views on the soul: 71

*Theurgy and the Soul*

1. Gnostics \(as described in *Ennead* II, 9\)

\(a\) The suffering of individual souls is due to the fall of the World Soul.

\(b\) Individual souls \(collectively\) = the World Soul.

2. Plotinus \(A\) \(against the Gnostics\)

\(a\) The suffering of individual souls is *not* due to the fall of the World Soul because the World Soul cannot fall \[ *Enn*. II, 9, 7, 9–19\]. The relation of individual souls to their bodies includes a temporary period of suffering and confusion \[ *Enn*. II, 9, 7ff.\], which can be overcome by education and an increasing mimesis of the gods \[ *Enn*. II, 9, 18, 32–35\].

\(b\) The World Soul *is not equal to* the sum of individual souls

\[ *Enn*. II, 9, 8, 36–39\].

3. Plotinus \(B\)

\(a\) The World Soul does not fall and neither do individual souls.

The suffering of individual souls, therefore, is merely the suffering of their “images”; in truth, individual souls remain above, at the level of the World Soul.

\(b\) The World Soul = unfallen individual souls.

Iamblichus believed that the Gnostics and Plotinus \(B\) erred by confusing ontological levels. To account for the experience of suffering, the Gnostics confused the part with the whole and interpreted the condition of the World Soul as if it were an individual soul. Plotinus \(B\) erred no less, but in the opposite way: he raised the part \(the individual soul\) to the level of the whole \(the World Soul\), perpetually unfallen. In contrast, theurgy may be seen to be in agreement with the principles of Plotinus \(A\). For Iamblichus, the problem of human suffering had to be solved without changing the ontological status of the soul.

Iamblichus’s view of the embodied soul was influenced by the Pythagorean principle of the “mean.” Explaining this principle in mathematic terms Iamblichus says: “If the Many is conceived as a triad and that opposed to the Many is conceived as a monad, the dyad would be a borderland between them. Therefore, *the dyad* 72



*possesses the characteristics of both*.”10 Iamblichus held that every realm of being followed this law and Proclus applied Iamblichus’s principle of the “mean” to the *nous* and soul in *Timaeus* 37e, saying

“he \(Iamblichus\) takes issue with those who connect the soul directly with the Absolute Intelligence \(for the transition from the transcendent to the participating should not be immediate, but there should be as media those essences which are combined with things that participate\).”11 Following the law of the mean, every hypostasis had three expressions: \(1\) unparticipated \( *to amethekton*\); \(2\) participated \( *to metechomenon*\); and \(3\) participating \( *to* *metechon*\), at every level of the cosmos.12 In the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus used a threefold distinction of souls according to wholes and parts:

The conflict of views in the issue at hand may easily be solved by demonstrating the transcendence of wholes with respect to parts and by recalling the exempt transcendence of the Gods with respect to men. For example, I mean that the entire corporeal world is ruled by \[a\] *the World Soul*, and that the celestial body is presided over by \[b\] *the Celestial Gods*, nor is there injury in their reception nor impediment to their intellection; on the other hand, both these ills exist for \[c\] *the individual soul* in communion with a body. \( *DM* 200, 1–10\)

12. Cf. *In. Tim*. III, frag. 54, 6–7, Dillon, trans. *Iamblichi Chalcidensis*, 33, 162–

63, 335–36; Iamblichus also employs the principle of mediation to explain the Aristotelian categories *poien/paschein*. In opposition to Plotinus, who attributes to agent and patient “the same substance” \( *ten auten ousian*\) but viewed “agentially”

or “patiently,” Iamblichus says: “the motion of the agent and the patient is distinguished as something intermediate between the two and which proceeds from the agent and produces an effect in the patient.” See Simplicius, *In Aristotelis Categorias* *Commentarium*, in *Commentaria in Aristotolem Graeca* \(AG\), ed. C. Kalbfleisch, 8:303, 27–9 \(Berlin: G. Reimeri, 1907\). Cf. Stephen Gersh, *From Iamblichus to Erui-gena: An Investigation of the Prehistory and Evolution of the Pseudo-Dionysian Tradition* \(Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1978\), 43–44, 90–91.

73

*Theurgy and the Soul*

Iamblichus’s celestial gods \(souls\) mediate between the World Soul and individual souls. Like the dyad in the mathematical example, celestial gods are the “borderland” \( *metaichmion*\) between the exempt wholeness and unity of the World Soul and the multiplicity and division of individual souls. Celestial souls possess the characteristics of their extremes: like the World Soul they exist in noetic perfection, never departing from their pure condition, but like individual souls, they each possess a single and moving body.

Iamblichus believed that the perfection of an individual soul occurred only through its return to the celestial orders, and through them, to the Demiurge \(Cf. *DM* 292, 5–18\). This was an elaboration of the Platonic teaching that the ratios of the embodied soul, twisted at birth, were identical to the ratios revealed in the heavens \( *Tim. * 90cd\). Indeed, what distinguished the theurgical Platonism of Iamblichus from the “exalted soul” Platonism of Plotinus was its interpretation of how the soul attained its celestial identity. Unlike Plotinus, Iamblichus maintained a need for mediation and a triadic distinction of souls, as seen in his description of their appearances in rites of divination:

\[I\]f the soul is universal and does not belong to any particular species, it appears as a formless fire revealing—through the whole world—the total, one, indivisible, and formless Soul of the World.

But a purified soul \[i.e., like the stars\] exhibits a fiery form and a pure unmingled fire, its inner light and form appear to be pure and stable, and it follows in the company of its anagogic Leader, rejoicing in his good will while revealing its own rank through its activities. But the soul which verges downward drags with it the signs of bonds and punishments, is weighed down with the conflicts of material spirits, is possessed by irregular troubles of matter, and appears to have placed before itself the authority of generative *Daimones* \( *DM* 84, 6–20\).

The mediating entities in this schema are described as purified souls instead of celestial. Since theurgists were able to attain the spherical purity of the celestial gods while still living a mortal life \(Cf. *DM* 41, 4–11\), their souls, *qua* theurgic, were equal to these divinities. According to Iamblichus they were “seated in the order of 74



the angels,”13 and their appearance provided corporeal souls with “sacred hope” \( *DM* 83, 4–5\) to attain salvation. The angelic soul of the theurgist was the functional equivalent of Plotinus’s undescended soul, yet the realization of this divine status was explained by the two Platonists in strongly contrasting terms. For Iamblichus, the theurgist attained this rank through ritual practices and a demiurgic assimilation of all the powers that he encountered in embodiment. For Plotinus, it was less an assimilation of cosmic powers than a realization that the soul, as undescended, somehow never really encountered them.

This admittedly portrays a distorted picture of Plotinus’s view of the soul and its relation with the *Nous*. We should remember that Iamblichus’s portrayal of Plotinus’s views was polemical. While it is true that Plotinus does speak of the soul as undescended and as possessing a continued contact with the *Nous*, he also says that *Nous* transcends the soul’s discursive awareness \( *Enn*. V, 3, 3, 22–28\). “The *Nous*,” he says, “is ours *and* not ours” \( *Enn*. V, 3, 3, 27–28\), so there is a tension in Plotinus’s position that Iamblichus does not sufficiently take into account.

For both Plotinus and Iamblichus, the background to their views on the soul’s apotheosis was the *Phaedrus* \(246–48\) where Plato describes the celestial circuit of the gods and the vain effort of human souls to imitate them. Due to the unruly character of one of his steeds the charioteer of the soul cannot follow the gods and falls into a body. Since Plotinus denied that this fall was complete, he had to explain why the soul identifies with the body if—as he also maintained—evil only occurs to the soul through its association with the body \( *Enn*. I, 8, 15, 12–21\). Iamblichus criticized Plotinus’s position and the contradiction it posed with regard to the soul’s experience of suffering. Proclus reports:

The divine Iamblichus is quite correct, therefore, in attacking those who hold this opinion \[that there is something of the soul which does not fall\], for what element in us is it that sins when the unreasoning principle in us is stirred, and we chase after a lawless 13. *DM* 83, 3; cf. *DM* 69, 9–12; Proclus, *In Platonis Rempublicam Commentaria* \( *In Remp*.\) 2 vols., ed. G. Kroll \(Leipzig, 1903–6\), 2: 154. 17–19.

*Theurgy and the Soul*

notion? Is it not our free will \( *prohairesis*\)? And how would it not be this? For it is by reason of this that we differ from those beings that follow impressions without reflection. If the free will sins, then how would the soul remain sinless? . . . And what is the Charioteer of the soul? Is it not the noblest, and, one might say, con-summate part of us? And how can we avoid this conclusion, if indeed this is what directs our whole being and with its own head views the supracelestial sphere and is assimilated to the “great leader” of the gods, who “drives a winged chariot” and “journeys through the heaven as a first” charioteer? And if the charioteer is the highest element in us, and he, as is said in the *Phaedrus*, sometimes is carried up aloft and raises “his head into the region outside,” while at other times he descends and \(fills his pair\) with lameness and moulting, *it plainly follows that the highest element in* *us experiences different states at different times*.14

The agent of the soul’s descent was *prohairesis*, its “free will,”

“choice,” or “disposition.”15 In his letter on fate Iamblichus again used this term to account for different conditions in human life:

“Why, you ask, are goods undeservedly distributed? Rather, to begin with, is it not impious even to ask this? For the goods of life do not depend on anything else but on man himself and on man’s choice \( *hairesis*\), and the most important goods are determined by free-will \( *prohairesis*\) alone.”16 For Iamblichus *prohairesis* was neu-tral. It verged to what was better or worse and its choices were a reflection of the character of the soul. In some sense the soul was its *prohairesis*, at least with respect to its spiritual condition,17 and if its *prohairesis* determined the quality of its life, then for the soul to change—for better or worse—it had to change its *prohairesis*.

This is why Iamblichus says that theurgy did not act through the intellect but through one’s entire character to allow the soul to exchange one life for another, to sacrifice its mortal life for the life 14. *In Tim*. IV, frag. 87, Dillon, trans., *Iamblichi Chalcidensis*, 198–201.

15. For the uses of this term by Neoplatonists, see John M. Rist, “Prohairesis: Proclus, Plotinus et alii,” in *Entretiens sur l’antiquité classique*, vol. 21: *De Jamb-liqueà Proclus* \(hereafter *Entretiens*\), 103–22 \(Geneva: Fondation Hardt, 1975\).

16. *Stob*. II, 175, 17–21. Iamblichus’s position simply follows standard Platonic doctrine; cf. *Rep*. 617e.

of a god.18 Theurgy transformed the soul’s *prohairesis* by conform-ing it to the divine *actions* communicated in theurgic symbols: the sacred stones, plants, animals, prayers \( *DM* 48, 5–6\), and names \( *DM* 255, 4–15; 157, 13–16\) that “preserve the *will* of the gods” \(cf.

*DM* 209, 14–17\).

18. See *DM* 270, 17–19. Plotinus also speaks of the exchange of one life for another, though for Plotinus it is the exchange of the fallen for the unfallen soul.

Plotinus calls the former the *inferior companion* of the higher soul. See *Enn*. I, 2, 6.
