Although Iamblichus was not a dualist, this definition is perfectly applicable to his theurgical Platonism. Petrément’s thesis is that genuine experiences of transcendence occur beyond one’s understanding and that these ruptures in the continuity of consciousness lead naturally to the postulation of a “two-world” cosmology. “To speak of two worlds,” she says, “is to speak of total change” (8). Petrément argues convincingly that cosmological dualism is rooted in experiential dualism and that soteriology necessarily precedes cosmology. In this I believe she is correct, but for Iamblichus the dualism that derives from a transcendent rupture:">

  <p>The divine is joined with itself . . .</p>
<p>In her classic study, Le Dualisme chez Platon, le Gnostiques et les Manichéens,1 Simone Petrément characterizes dualism as follows: “In religions and philosophies where it appears, dualism seems tied to the belief in a transcendent, to an unknown which is not simply not yet known, to an invisible which is not simply not yet seen, but to that which essentially goes beyond anything seen and known” (3). Although Iamblichus was not a dualist, this definition is perfectly applicable to his theurgical Platonism. Petrément’s thesis is that genuine experiences of transcendence occur beyond one’s understanding and that these ruptures in the continuity of consciousness lead naturally to the postulation of a “two-world” cosmology. “To speak of two worlds,” she says, “is to speak of total change” (8). Petrément argues convincingly that cosmological dualism is rooted in experiential dualism and that soteriology necessarily precedes cosmology. In this I believe she is correct, but for Iamblichus the dualism that derives from a transcendent rupture:</p>
<p>“[when] the soul exchanges one life for another [and] entirely abandons its former existence” ( DM 270, 17–19), did not produce a cosmological dualism but a psychological one. Iamblichus differed from his Platonic predecessors because he believed the dualism experienced by the soul was caused by its mediating function, link-ing the oppositions of same and other, unified and divided, immortal and mortal. Iamblichus spoke of the soul’s “two lives” ( Stob. I, 1. (Paris: Presses Universitares de France, 1947).</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>371, 6–8), “two powers” ( Stob. I, 368, 1–6), and “two activities” ( Stob.</p>
<p>I, 371, 5–8), and in the De Mysteriis he cited Hermetic teachings stat-ing that man has “two souls,” one subject to fate and the other above fate resting in the noetic world ( DM 269, 1–270, 12). Yet Iamblichus qualified this description of a noetic and seemingly undescended soul by saying that it was the vehicle of theurgic apotheosis ( DM</p>
<p>270, 11–12) and thus beyond reach of the embodied soul. The Iamblichean soul had two lives, but because of its embodied condition it could only know one. The higher life received in theurgy was an epistemological impossibility for the embodied soul. Its divine life came from the gods as other to the soul even if it expressed the soul’s truest identity.</p>
<p>Can Iamblichus’s paradoxical psychology still be considered a genuine form of Platonism? Porphyry’s letter to Anebo challenged Iamblichus to answer this question, and the De Mysteriis was a philosophical apology for a discipline that claimed to transcend philosophy. Yet it was Iamblichus’s skill as philosopher that makes his defense of theurgy convincing, for in his reply to Porphyry, Iamblichus used standard Platonic arguments to support the practice of theurgy.2</p>
<p>According to Iamblichus, every human soul contained the ineffable presence of the One. By definition this presence was unknowable and would thus satisfy Petrément’s demand for the ineffability of an other. This ineffable presence was the functional equivalent of Plotinus’s undescended soul, a point Zintzen makes when he says that Iamblichus translated Plotinus’s noetics into theurgical terminology.3 Yet I would argue that the reason for this translation and the difference in their psychologies was due, not only to the greater influence of Aristotle on Iamblichus but more important, to Iamblichus’s different understanding of salvation. The psychologies of Plotinus and Iamblichus were coherent with their soteriologies, and 2. B.D. Larsen has demonstrated that Iamblichus’s method in the De Mysteriis was entirely philosophic and Platonic; see Jamblique de Chalcis: Exégète et philosophe (Aarhus: Universitetforlaget, 1972), 165–76.</p>

<p>Descending to Apotheosis</p>
<p>these, I believe, derived from their attempts to make sense of transcendent experiences. Armstrong distinguishes Plotinus’s doctrine of the undescended soul from the Iamblichean view of the soul based on this experiential criterion:</p>
<p>I believe that Origen, Iamblichus, Augustine, Proclus and the rest who disagreed with Plotinus on this point were aware of and experienced themselves as one person. Plotinus, on the other hand, on the strength of his own experience, knew perfectly well that he was two people . . . a rightful inhabitant of the world of pure intelligence . . . [and] here below, body-bound and immersed in earthly concerns and desires.4</p>
<p>The “one person” that Iamblichus knew himself to be and that he described in the De Anima and the De Mysteriis was the completely descended soul identified with its particular mortal body. Indeed, the self-consciousness of any soul was rooted in this identification, and the rigorous limitations that Iamblichus imposed on the soul were not, pace Armstrong, necessarily due to his lack of transcendent experiences but from his concern that they be received properly and not confused with “body-bound” matters. Porphyry, for example, had claimed that Plotinus achieved henosis with the One</p>
<p>“four” times ( Vita Plot. 23). This, of course, would have made no sense to Iamblichus, or even to Plotinus, for a henosis that can be enumerated or even known could not be a true henosis. It was precisely this kind of counterfeit spirituality that Iamblichus opposed by distinguishing the human activity of philosophy from the divine activity of theurgy. In one sense, Iamblichus’s emphasis on the ineffability of theurgy was not even a theurgical issue, but a philosophical one, to correct the kind of thinking that fails to distinguish between the content of a discursive statement and its evocative and iconic power.5 That Iamblichus would have questioned the authen-4.

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>ticity of Plotinus’s mystical experience is unlikely, but he certainly disagreed with the manner in which Plotinus explained it.6</p>
<p>Plotinus retained a Middle Platonic conception of matter as evil.</p>
<p>He understood the dualism experienced by the soul to be caused by matter; once cleansed of material accretions, the soul immediately realized its divinity. For Plotinus the soul’s division was not essential but accidental, caused by matter and the dualistic cosmos, but for Iamblichus the soul’s dividedness was integral to its essence; it could never grasp the undividedness through which it participated in the divine. Therefore, Iamblichus shifted Platonic soteriology from an intellectual to a ritual askesis. What the embodied soul could never know, it could, nevertheless, perform in conjunction with the gods. As discursive, however, the mind remained enantios, barred from union with the gods.</p>
<p>The goal of theurgy was to awaken the soul to the presence of the One that it bore unknowingly. And, by means of the very images that bound the soul to its generative life, theurgy released the soul from their grip. Theurgic ritual transformed the soul’s somatic, emotional, and intellectual identity through “symbols” ( sumbola) and “tokens” ( sunthemata) that united the soul with the Demiurge ( DM 97, 4–8; 97, 16–17; 209, 14–19; 65, 6–9; 136, 2–8). However, what the Demiurge contained simultaneously ( DM 141, 10–13), each soul had to integrate over the course of its life and lives, and because the soul had distributed its powers into generated life, its salvation had to include all the mortal activities with which it was identified. The soul’s return to the divine, therefore, demanded that it ritually re-enact cosmogenesis.</p>
<p>Since theurgic symbols transmitted the power of the demiurgic Nous they functioned much like the Platonic Forms by enforming matter ( DM 65, 6–9). Yet because Iamblichus and his successors saw the cosmos as the “most sacred temple of the Demiurge” ( In Tim.  I, 124, 16–22), these Forms also possessed an anagogic power in theurgic ritual. Only then did they function properly as symbols and sunthemata. Describing the relation of theurgic cult to cosmology Iamblichus says:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Cf. Lowry, Logical Principles, 14–25.</li>
</ol>
<p>124</p>
<p>Descending to Apotheosis</p>
<p>This cult, has it not been intellectually ordained from the beginning according to the sacred laws of the Gods? It imitates the order of the Gods, both the intelligible order and that in heaven. It possesses the eternal measures of beings and wondrous signatures which have been sent down here from the Demiurge and Father of Wholes, through which the inexpressible is revealed through ineffable symbols. ( DM 65, 3–9)</p>
<p>When the soul activated the power of these symbols their presence in the soul was awakened. Iamblichus tells Porphyry that this occurred, for example, when meaningless ( asema; DM 254, 15) names of the gods were chanted. As theurgic symbols these names transcended discursive understanding: “Even if they are unknowable to us, this very unknowableness is its most venerable aspect, for it is too excellent to be divided into knowledge” ( DM 255, 17–256, 3). The ineffable names were already present in the soul in the form of an undivided image. Iamblichus says: “We preserve completely in the soul the mystical and ineffable image of the Gods, and through these</p>
<p>[names] we lead the soul up to the Gods and, when elevated, we are connected with them as much as possible” ( DM 255, 17–256, 3).</p>
<p>Chanting the ineffable names awakened corresponding sunthemata in the soul, and Iamblichus says, “these sunthemata themselves do their own work, from themselves, and without our thinking” ( DM 97, 4–5). The embodied soul, as intermediary, was simply the conduit through which the divine will in nature joined the divine will in the soul, a conjunction that transcended discursive consciousness. In practical terms, theurgy matched the images in the soul to their counterparts in nature, and though this demanded effort on the part of the soul, the transformative work was done by the images. Iamblichus says: “It is the divine sunthemata themselves, these are the things which properly awaken the divine will; and thus these sunthemata of the Gods are awakened by the Gods themselves” ( DM 97, 4–5).</p>
<p>A divine name was the audible energeia of the god and when invoked the theurgist entered its power, joining the divine image in his soul to the divine itself: “For the divine, intellectual, and one in us—or if you prefer to call it intelligible—is clearly awakened in prayer, and being awakened, it vehemently yearns for its match and 125</p>
<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>is joined to perfection itself ” ( DM 46, 13–16). Strictly speaking, theurgists did not call down the gods with their prayers; the gods were present already in the invocations ( DM 47, 6). Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>“At the moment of prayer, the divine itself is literally joined with itself, and it is united with the spiritual conceptions in prayers but not as one thing is joined to another” ( DM 47, 9–11).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is man who prays, and the impulse to prayer was a crucial element in Iamblichus’s soteriology. Responding to Porphyry’s criticism that man’s prayers were impure and unfit to be offered to the divine Nous, Iamblichus retorts: Not at all! For it is due to this very fact, because we are far inferior to the Gods in power, purity, and everything else, that it is of all things most critical that we do pray to them to the utmost! For the awareness of our own nothingness, when we compare ourselves to the Gods, makes us turn spontaneously to prayer. And from our suppli-cation, in a short time we are led up to that One to whom we pray, and from our continual intercourse with it we obtain a likeness to it, and from imperfection we are gradually embraced by divine perfection. ( DM 47, 13–48, 4)</p>
<p>When the soul fully recognized its nothingness it was stirred to pray, and any presumption that it had the capacity to reach the gods would prevent its occurrence. Before its conjunction with the divine the human soul had to recognize the unbridgeable gulf that separated it from the gods, and the recognition of this limitation was the only genuinely theurgical act that Iamblichus allowed to the soul.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to reach the gods by giving them anthropomor-phic characteristics (the Gnostics) or by giving divine characteristics to man (Plotinus) ( DM 65, 16–66, 2), Iamblichus maintained that only when the human soul fully accepted the unflattering reality of its rank, would it spontaneously ( autophuos) be drawn to the gods.</p>
<p>Clearly, spontaneous prayer could not derive from discursive deliberation. It was, in fact, the energeia of the divine image in the soul yearning for its original. Yet to awaken this divine power the soul had to establish a limit ( to peras) on its unlimited pretense to know ( to apeiron). The soul’s turn to prayer, in short, was the awakening of its divine sunthema. Iamblichus says: “If one considers that 126</p>
<p>Descending to Apotheosis</p>
<p>sacred prayers are sent down to men from the Gods themselves and that they are the sunthemata of these very Gods and are known only to the Gods and possess, in a manner, the same power as the Gods, how could anyone justly conceive this sort of prayer to be physical and not divine and intellectual?” ( DM 48, 5–11). In its unity, the One of the soul was always in a state of prayer, joining itself to itself, yet the soul participated in this union only in moments of theurgy and through the medium of prayer.</p>
<p>Like Plotinus, Iamblichus maintained that the soul’s final goal was an ineffable henosis ( DM 238, 4), yet he was somewhat vague about the divinity with whom the soul unites. Iamblichus said the soul is united with “the Gods” ( hoi theoi; DM 238, 5), with the “universal Demiurge” ( holos demiourgos; DM 292, 7), or even with the</p>
<p>“God who transcends thought” ( ho proennooumenos theos; DM 293, 2–3). It should be remembered, however, that the De Mysteriis was an apology for ritual theurgy, not a theological treatise, and each ritual was directed to the specific needs of a particular soul. A theurgist, therefore, would not attempt first to ascertain the “highest god” in an abstract sense and then worship it. The highest god for any soul in practical and theurgic terms was the god that ruled the elements that bound it. Therefore, Iamblichus’s vagueness concerning divine henosis may simply reflect his theurgic pragmatism.</p>
<p>Henosis was always relative to the deity with whom one needed to unite.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, book VIII of the De Mysteriis and Iamblichus’s commentary on the Timaeus suggest that the highest unification for a soul was with the pre-essential ( proousios) Demiurge,7 who contained the entire intelligible world.8 Iamblichus distinguished this primary Demiurge from the secondary Demiurge who managed the 7. DM 262, 5; 291, 7. Iamblichus introduced the term proousios into Neoplatonism. The use of pro instead of huper, Trouillard argues, shows that the Iamblichean school was concerned more with the ineffable foundation of consciousness ( en deca) than in extending consciousness into the beyond ( au dela); see J. Trouillard, “Note sur PROOUSIOS et PRONOIA chez Proclos,” Revue des Etudes Grecques 73 (1960): 80–87.</p>

<p>“cause of all the intelligibles” ( DM 262, 7–8), and “God of gods”</p>
<p>( DM 262, 4). Iamblichus calls him the “first God and king” ( DM 161, 10–11) and identified him with the Egyptian god Ikton, the indivisible one who holds in himself the secondary demiurgic gods Amon and Ptah. In mathematical terms he was simply the “monad from the One” ( DM 262, 4–5).</p>
<p>Was the One itself beyond the reach of the soul? Strictly speaking, yes. But according to the Parmenides the One transcended even itself; strictly speaking, even the One could not be one ( Parmenides 141d–</p>
<p>142). The complexity of this problem was much appreciated by the Neoplatonists. For them “unity” was simply a heuristic term that marked the point of transcendence, and its conceptual meaning was defined only by the particular context from which it was approached.10 For Iamblichus, beyond the noetic Demiurge was utter ineffability, and it was called “one” only by virtue of its unifying ppp</p>

In Jamblique: Les mystères d’Egypt, des Places translates: “ils (les Egyptians 266, 10) préposant le démiurge au devenir comme un père du démiurge antérieure à celui-ci et distinguent la puissance vivante antérieure au ciel et celle qui est dans le ciel.” Scott comments: “According to the reading of the mss. the propator is ton en genesei demiourgos. But the meaning must have been that the Egyptians recognize a propator distinct from and prior to the demiourgos ton en genesei”; see Hermetica, 4 vols., ed. and trans. W. Scott (London: Dawsons, 1968; reprint, Boston: Shambhala, 1985), 4:71. Scott’s remark is corroborated by Iamblichus’s commentary on the Sophist (frag 1, in Dillon, trans. Iamblichi Chalcidensis, where he distinguishes three Demiourgoi: “the sublunar Demiurge” (1, 1–2), “the heavenly demiurge” (1, 15–16), and the “Father of Demiurges” (1, 18). Dillon explains the fragment: “What we have in this passage is, first, a transcendent Demiurge who sends forth the original creative thoughts; then a heavenly Demiurge, whom one may equate with the neoi theoi of the Timaeus; and finally our third Demiurge, who presides over generation in the realm of the Moon” (246).

Cf. the discussion following Beierwaltes’s essay “Das Problem der Erkenntnis bei Proklos,” in Entretiens, 186–90. There the notion of henosis and to en hemin hen is discussed in connection with the degree of unity afforded the soul in its unio mystica. Beierwaltes, like Trouillard, denies that henosis implies that the soul achieves an “absolute Identität” with the One.</li>

<p>effects, all of which the Demiurge contained. So there was no unification higher than with the pre-essential Father.</p>
<p>Iamblichus maintained that regardless of the degree of the soul’s ascent it must always remain soul. Therefore, the soul’s conjunction with the divine was never an absolute identity of soul and god but a unification of the will and activity of the soul with the will and activity of the Demiurge. Describing this conjunction Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>When the theurgic art has united the soul successively to the orders of the universe and to all the divine powers that pervade them, it leads it up to the Creator in his entirety and deposits it there with him, outside of all matter, uniting the soul with the one eternal Logos. Specifically, what I mean is this: theurgy joins the soul with the Self-Begotten, Self-Moving, and All-Sustaining Powers, then with the Intellectual Power which arranges the cosmos, with the Anagogic Power leading to Intelligible Truth, with the Self-Perfect and Creative Powers, and with all other demiurgic powers of this God in order that the theurgic soul may be perfectly established in the activities, thoughts, and creations of these powers. Then, indeed, it establishes the soul in the Creator God in his entirety. And this is the goal of the hieratic ascent according to the Egyptians.11</p>
<p>The soul was established in the gods by taking part in their activities, that is to say, in their theurgies, for only by entering the activity of the Demiurge could the soul remain within the eternal logos that held the divine worlds together. Souls who entered this company became “companions of the gods” at which time Iamblichus says,</p>
<p>“the aetheric and luminous pneuma, which surrounds the soul, is divested of all generative impulses” ( DM 239, 9–11).</p>
<p>Iamblichus explicitly rejected the idea that the soul achieves an absolute union with the divine. In the De Anima he contrasted the view of the Ancients (i.e., theurgists),12 who denied absolute 11. DM 292, 5–18. W. Scott suggests that the eight Powers mentioned by Iamblichus (Abammon) refer to specific Egyptian gods and the order of initiation among Egyptian priests. See Scott, ed. and trans. Hermetica, 4:97–99.</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>unification, with the view of Numenius (and by implication Plotinus), who affirmed it. Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>Numenius appears to maintain that there is unification and identity without distinction of the soul with its principles, but the Ancients maintain that the soul is united while remaining distinct as an essence. Numenius compares it to a “resolution” ( analusis) but the Ancients to an “association” ( suntaxis) and while the former used the terms “unification with no distinction of parts,”</p>
<p>the latter say it is a “unification with distinction of parts.” ( Stob. I, 458, 3–8)</p>
<p>This forms part of Iamblichus’s explanation of the rewards given to the purified soul after death. It is germane because theurgy, like death, separated the soul from its embodied identity and caused it to experience post-mortem purifications and rewards.13 Therefore, Iamblichus’s description of liberated souls in the De Anima concurs with his description of theurgic souls in the De Mysteriis. Like theurgists, divinized souls after death share in the creation and preservation of the cosmos. Contrasting the more theurgic view of the Ancients with the Platonists, Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>According to the Ancients, the souls freed from generation coadminister the cosmos with the Gods, but according to the Platonists they contemplate their divine hierarchy. And in the same way, according to the Ancients, liberated souls create the cosmos together with the angels, but according to the Platonists they accompany them in the circular journey. ( Stob. I, 458, 17–21) 13. That theurgy may be seen to culminate in a kind of “voluntary death” is implied in Proclus’s remark that “in the most mystic of all consecrations ( en te mus-tikotate ton teleton) the theurgists order the whole body to be buried except for the head” ( Th. Pl. IV, 30, 19, trans. and ed. H.D. Saffrey and L.G. Westerink [Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1981]). See Saffrey’s discussion of this passage, 135–36; and Hans Lewy, Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy, ed. M. Tardieu (Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1978), 204–7. Damascius, in his catalogue of “deaths,” refers to a “supernatural ( huperphues) death by dissolution of the elements, in other words, the deaths which many theurgists have died” ( In Phaed. II, 149, 7–8). This form of “voluntary death” ( hekousious thanatos) Damascius calls “setting the soul free in the most divine way” (149, 12–13); See In Phae d. II, trans. L.G. Westerink, in The Greek Commentaries on Plato’s Phaedo, vol. 2: Damascius (New York: North-Holland, 1977), 368–69.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>Descending to Apotheosis</p>
<p>Theurgic henosis was not a beatific repose but an active embodiment and beneficent sharing of beatitude in cosmogenesis. After all, unification in the will of the Demiurge was a unification in the divine generosity ( aphthonos; Tim.  29e) that creates the cosmos. To remain above with the Demiurge, souls had to descend demiurgi-cally in the act of creation.</p>
<p>When the soul was liberated it joined the circulation of angels and archangels “united in mind”14 with the Demiurge. The soul performed its cosmogonic round in the luminous and spheric body gained after a life of theurgic purification. Yet this final body of the soul was identical to its first body created in the beginning by the Demiurge. To become a “companion” ( sunopados) of the gods ( Phaedrus 248c), the soul had to re-enter its first ochema at the moment of creation. According to Iamblichus, this vehicle was a microcosm, “produced from the entire aether . . . which possesses a generative power.”15 Yet its recovery demanded a laborious reharmonizing of the “numerous pegs” ( puknoi gomphoi; Tim.  43a, 4) that bound the soul to its body. It is significant that Iamblichus equates these bonds with the “reason-principles of Nature” ( hoi phusikoi logoi);16 “binding” is an accurate description of the soul’s unknowing bestowal of divine logoi to the world. In theurgy these logoi were ritually realigned with their divine principles and the soul was translated to its luminous ochema as if to its “first birth” ( prote genesis).17 The soul’s ascent to the rank of an angel was therefore experienced as a descent into its first vehicle at the moment of creation. This was consistent with the Neoplatonic paradox that the return ( epistrophe) to the One manifests the procession ( prohodos) of Ideas from the One. Only temporal experience and discursive 14. For Iamblichus the term homonoetikos describes the noetic concord that is the culmination of all theurgy ( DM 294, 5). Cosmologically, it is also the term that describes the perfect concord of demiurgic powers in the orders of creation ( DM</p>
<p>23, 5), as well as the condition of the human soul when it has been assimilated to these powers ( Stob. I, 456, 24).</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>thought separated the procession from the return.18 Theurgy over-came this and allowed the soul to return to the gods by embodying the eternal measures ( metra aidia) which continually proceed from them ( DM 65, 6).</p>
<p>The noetic simultaneity of prohodos and epistrophe was also reflected in the salvation of the soul although it was extended over time:</p>
<p>From their first descent God sent souls here in order that they might return again to him. Therefore there isn’t any change [in the divine will] on account of this sort of [theurgic] ascent, nor do the descents and ascents of souls oppose each other. For just as in the entire cosmos generation and this world below are conjoined with the Intellectual Essence, so in the order of souls, their concern for generated lives is in concord with their liberation from generation.</p>
<p>( DM 272, 10–15)</p>
<p>The embodiment of the soul and its concern for generated lives was a fall only so long as the soul failed to limit ( to peras) its ceaseless attraction to external phenomena ( to apeiron).19 As the soul was initiated into the eternal measures of the cosmos, its fall was transformed into theophany, revealing a demiurgic concern for genesis.</p>
<p>Iamblichus and the later Platonists rejected the notion of static perfection as an idol of the discursive mind. Their negative theology 18. Henry Duméry discusses this aspect of Neoplatonic metaphysics in H.</p>
<p>Duméry, The Problem of God in Philosophy of Religion (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1964), 96–97.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>For Iamblichus each soul is stamped with the ineffable principles of peras and apeiron. Metaphysically the latter is responsible for procession from the One and the former for return to the One. The uneducated soul described by Plato ( Tim. 44) and the uninitiated soul described by Iamblichus are dominated by the principle of apeiron, for they have not yet learned to limit their powers in accord with the divine economy of the cosmos. In the Philebus, where peras and apeiron are investigated as cosmogonic powers, Plato puns on the homonym apeiron, which also means an “inexperienced one.” ( Phil. 17e). The embodied soul, therefore, may properly participate in the demiurgic mixing of the principles peras-</li>
</ol>
<p>apeiron ( Phil. 26cd) only when, through the experience of its embodiment, it discovers its limits. For Iamblichus, the education/initiation of the soul was necessarily its homologization to the demiurgic mixing of these principles, which Plato called the genesis eis ousian ( Phil. 26d8).</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>Descending to Apotheosis</p>
<p>demanded that even the terms “one” and “good,” should not be taken descriptively but symbolically; that is to say, by virtue of their beneficial and unifying effects. As Trouillard puts it: “La bonté car-actérise la cause, non parce qu’elle possède le bien, mais parce qu’ elle la crée.”20 In the same way, the highest condition for souls was not their enjoyment of divine status, but their bestowal of divine measurements in cosmogenesis. This made theourgia superior to the highest forms of theoria, and from this perspective even the descent of souls into bodies was an expression of the same informing activity though it came at the cost of the soul’s beatitude.21 For although embodiment broke the soul’s connection with the gods, theurgy recovered it through a mimesis of divine action.</p>
