  <p>There is another principle of the</p>
<p>soul . . .</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s doctrine of the “one of the soul” provided important theoretical support for the practice of theurgy. Because the soul carried the presence of the One it had the capacity to rise above itself, be homologized to the cosmos and united with its divine cause. The fact that the soul possessed correspondences to the entire cosmos meant that, like the cosmos, it possessed a principle that preceded its multiplicity. Iamblichus called this principle “the one of the soul” ( to hen tes psuches), and he identified it with the</p>
<p>“helmsman” ( kubernetes) of the Phaedrus who unites the soul with the Intelligibles in its celestial circuit.1</p>
<p>In his Phaedrus commentary Iamblichus described this helmsman as “an entity more perfect than the charioteer,”2 yet in his Timaeus commentary he says that the “charioteer [not the helmsman] is the highest element in us.”3 The discrepancy in the two statements may reflect the difference for Iamblichus between the henological and ontological orders. As a being in the hierarchy of souls, man’s highest element was certainly logismos, the rational faculty, but Iamblichus 1. Dillon notes that in the phrase psuches kubernete mono theate no ( Phaedrus 247c, 7–8) the no was not in the Platonic text used by Iamblichus and, if it were, he would have had to explain it away; Dillon, trans., Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 253; cf.</p>

<p>Eros and the One of the Soul</p>
<p>distinguished between an entity’s being ( ousia) and its huparxis.</p>
<p>Damascius explains this distinction etymologically:</p>
<p>[ Huparxis], as the word ( hupo + archein) itself indicates, signifies the first principle of every hypostasis. It is, as it were, a sort of foundation or substructure previously established for the structure as a whole and for each part. . . . Huparxis is the simplicity anterior to all things. . . . It is the One itself, which pre-exists beyond all things and is the cause of every ousia but is not yet itself ousia.4</p>
<p>Considered essentially, the charioteer/ logismos was indeed the soul’s highest faculty, but pre-essentially the helmsman/ huparxis or “one of the soul” was its highest element. Strictly speaking, the “one of the soul” was not part of the soul but was present to it in a pre-essential way, just as the One was present to all hypostases as their pre-essential cause.5</p>
<p>Iamblichus explains that the helmsman is called a “spectator”</p>
<p>( theate) of the supercelestial realm, “not to signify that it directs its gaze on this object of intellection as being other than it ( kath’ het-eroteta), but that it is united with it ( henoutai auto) and appreciates it on that level . . . for it is the essential nature of the “one of the soul” to be united with the Gods.”6 Theurgy was the embodied realization of this union, for in theurgy the “one of the soul” united with the hypercosmic gods just as the “helmsman” joined the disembodied soul to the supercelestial realm. Iamblichus said the soul was capable of this unification “[because] there subsists in its very essence an innate knowledge ( emphutos gnosis) of the Gods” ( DM 7, 13–14). Iamblichus admits that he uses the term gnosis inexactly, for the highest aspect of the soul could not possibly “know” the gods any more than the helmsman could “see” them. Defining this innate knowledge, Iamblichus says:</p>

Hadot, “L’Etre et L’Etant dans le Néoplatonisme,” Revue de Théologie et de Philosophie (1973): 110–11. The same principle was articulated already by Iamblichus in the DCMS 15, 6–14.</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>[It] subsists in our very essence, is superior to all judgment and choice, and exists prior to reason and demonstration. From the beginning it is united to its proper cause and is established with the soul’s essential desire ( ephesis) for the Good. But if one must speak the truth, contact with the divine is not knowledge. For knowledge is separated [from its object] by otherness. But, prior to the act of knowing another as being, itself, “other,” there exists a spontaneous [. . .] uniform conjunction suspended from the Gods.7</p>
<p>It is a contact, Iamblichus says, established by the gods, and the soul’s very existence depended on it, “for we are enveloped in it, even more, we are filled by it, and our existence itself we possess by</p>
<p>“knowing” ( eidenai) the Gods” ( DM 8, 11–13). This essence-making knowledge, like the gaze of the helmsman, is not of one to another; it is a unifying contact. And since the “principles ( archai) of reason and life” ( DM 9, 6) can never be grasped by the orders they establish, it is through the soul’s preconceptual contact with the gods that it sees and knows them.</p>
<p>Des Places has noted the influence of Plato’s Phaedrus on the De Mysteriis and points to Iamblichus’s direct borrowing of words and phrases.8 In his explanation of the soul’s innate knowledge of the gods Iamblichus says: “Indeed, it seems ( eoiketo de) that with the eternal companions of the Gods is fitted an inborn ( sumphutos) perception of their Lords” ( DM 9, 10–11). The terms eoiketo de and sumphutos were also used by Plato in his description of souls who are joined to the gods in their celestial round ( Phaedrus 246a, 5), and though (unlike Iamblichus) Plato used sumphutos to describe the ppp</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>DM 7, 14–8, 6. I find A. Smith’s explanation of emphutos gnosis (7, 14) as “still divided” (see Porphyry’s Place in the Neoplatonic World: A Study in Post-Plotinian Neoplatonism [The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1974], 85–86) and therefore subordinate to the sumploke, which is uniform ( monoeides; 8, 5) to be unconvincing. Iamblichus begins his explanation of human contact with the gods with the term gnosis probably because it was the term Porphyry used in his question (10, 2), and in any case, Iamblichus clearly distinguishes it from human gnosis and explicitly denies its dividedness since he equates the emphutos gnosis ton theon with the sumploke. Iamblichus, therefore, defines two kinds of gnosis: divine and human (10, 1–6) and explicitly states that the gnosis/eidesis of divine things is monoeides (10, 8).</p>

<p>Eros and the One of the Soul</p>
<p>unity of the vehicle and rider and not their contact with the supercelestial realm, Iamblichus’s use of the terms sumphutos (9, 11) and emphutos (7, 14) in this context suggests that he imagined theurgical unification against the background of the Phaedrus.9</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s use of terms, however, must be understood in context. For example, although Iamblichus denies that noesis is sufficient to reach the divine he also says that souls join the gods by noesis: “It is by pure and blameless intuitions ( noeseis) that are received out of eternity from the Gods that the soul is joined to them” ( DM 9, 16–18). Iamblichus’s reference to noesis, gnosis, or eidesis to describe contact with the gods should not be confused with human modes of understanding. These terms were used as metaphors to describe the soul’s pre-essential contact with the gods, and Iamblichus always qualified them as innate ( emphutos), natural ( sumphutos), uniform ( monoeides), or pure ( katharos) to distinguish them from human understanding.</p>
<p>Since the noesis of the gods had no “otherness” in the separated manner of human knowledge, their “pure intuitions” ( katharai noeseis) necessarily transcended the soul. Theurgic noesis was, in fact, the act of a god knowing itself through the activity and the medium of the soul, not vice versa. Noesis, in fact, was not conceptual, and Iamblichus maintained that noetic contacts with the gods were more erotic than intellectual. In his Parmenides commentary he says: “The Intelligible is held before the mind, not as knowable ( hos gnoston), but as desirable ( hos epheton), and the mind is filled by this, not with knowledge, but with the being and every intelligible perfection.”10</p>
<p>The “one of the soul” was anterior to the soul’s hypostasis. As arche of the soul’s being and consciousness, it was pre-essential and 9. Trouillard has demonstrated the influence of the Phaedrus on the theurgy of Proclus. See, L’Un et l’âme selon Proclos (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1972), esp. 171–89.</p>

<li>Damascius, Dub. et Sol. I, 154, 9–11. In the same section (70), Damascius lists nine ways in which the noeton cannot be grasped by the soul (151, 18–23), again attributing this to the “great Iamblichus”; cf. Dillon’s translation of this passage, In Parm., frag. 2A, in Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 208–9, and commentary, 389–91. Cf. DM</li>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>pre-noetic, completely inaccessible to understanding. Although the soul could not consciously know the gods or even its own divinity, it was nevertheless drawn to them by its innate gnosis and desire ( ephesis). Theurgy successfully embodied this desire in proportion to the soul’s capacity to homologize itself to the cosmos. Graphically put, the soul’s vertical ascent was determined by its horizontal extension and its co-ordination of the many attractions of embodied life.</p>
<p>According to Damascius, Iamblichus believed that “the ascent to the One is not possible unless the soul co-ordinates itself to the All and, with the All, moves itself toward the universal principle of all things”</p>
<p>( Dub. et Sol. I, 79, 12–14). According to Pythagorean teachings, the One manifested itself as a co-ordinated multiplicity: a Whole, and similarly, the “one in the soul” manifested itself when the soul ritually co-ordinated its multiplicity into a whole, imitating “the anterior and commanding principle which contains in and around itself otherness and multiplicity” ( DM 59, 13–15). In its co-ordination of parts the soul was lifted out of the contraries of embodied life11 and entered the unity that preceded its embodied existence.</p>
<p>Iamblichus referred to the “one of the soul” differently depending on the context, and his inconsistency suggests that he was not concerned about the term he used so long as it conveyed the idea of an anteriority pre-established with the gods. Responding to Porphyry’s question on prayer, Iamblichus used the terms hen, theios, noeros, and noetos to describe the divine element in the soul ( DM 46, 13–15).</p>
<p>In a discussion of divination, Iamblichus explained that prophecy was caused by this “one principle” and he made a rigorous distinction between theurgic divination ( to theion mantikes eidos; DM 64, 11. P. Hadot, citing Simplicius, In Categ. 116, 25–30, says that for Iamblichus and other Neoplatonists, categories that are opposed in the sensible world are contained uniformly in the intelligible world. See Hadot, 2 vols. (Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1968), Porphyre et Victorinus, 442. The Iamblichean fragment preserved by Simplicius ( In Categ. 116, 25–118, 15) reveals Iamblichus’s application of the Aristotelian categories kata analogian (116, 26) to the entire noetic realm as well as to celestial divinities such as stars and planets. B.D. Larsen comments on the above-mentioned fragment and shows its relation to the “Pythagorean” Aristotle of Iamblichus; see Larsen, Jamblique de Chalcis: Exégète et philosophe (Aarhus: Universitetsforlaget, 1972), 243, 260–62.</p>

<p>Eros and the One of the Soul</p>
<p>16–17) and the varieties of human divination. The latter, Iamblichus says, are “false and deceptive” ( DM 165, 2–3), in contrast to theurgic divination which is “one, divine, and unmixed” ( DM 164, 18–19). He says: “The divine kind [of divination] must be uniformly comprehended according to one measure and order ( hen logos kai mia taxis) and according to one intelligible and immutable truth” ( DM</p>
<p>165, 4–6). True divination was not a natural gift, “but a certain divine good which is pre-established as more ancient than our nature” ( DM 165, 18–19; cf. Stob. II, 174, 15–16). This “certain divine good” stood in precisely the same relation to man as the “one of the soul” and Iamblichus maintained that it came to the soul from outside: “It is necessary to contend vigorously against anyone who says that divination originates from us” ( DM 166, 14–15). Divine mantike came to the soul “from without” ( exothen; DM 167, 2), just as the Aristotelian nous came to the soul “from without” (GA 736b, 28).</p>
<p>Even the soul’s “innate knowledge” of the gods had to come to it from without for due to its anteriority it was “more ancient” ( pres-butera) and therefore inaccessible to the soul.</p>
<p>That this more ancient principle remained outside the soul was a point on which Iamblichus was unwilling to compromise. One might suppose that since the soul enjoyed a degree of union with the gods between incarnations it could sustain this connection sub-liminally or, as Plotinus seems to suggest, “unconsciously,”12 but Iamblichus’s view of the descent of the soul and his distinction of incorporeal hypostases did not allow for this. The embodied soul was incapable of returning to the gods of its own power and needed their aid to reach them. This “otherness” of the divine principle was consistent with Iamblichus’s psychology. Because of the inversion of the soul its autos was recovered only by ritually embracing the heteros, and although the objects employed in theurgy appeared as</p>
<p>“other,” it was through them that the soul’s external inclinations were united with their celestial archetypes. By ritually unifying its ppp</p>

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>own multiplicity the soul entered the activity of the One and penetrated to its own pre-essential arche.13 Of this principle Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>But there is another principle ( arche) of the soul, superior to all nature and knowledge, by which we are able to be unified with the Gods, transcend the mundane order, and participate in the eternal life and activity of the supercelestial Gods. . . . The soul is then entirely separated from those things which bind it to the generated world and it flies from the inferior and exchanges one life for another. It gives itself to another order, having entirely abandoned its former existence. ( DM 270, 8–19)</p>
<p>Iamblichus believed that the unifying principle that transformed the soul in theurgy was the same principle that held the cosmos together as its universal philia or eros ( DM 211, 3–6): “There is a single friendship ( philia) which contains all things and produces this unifying bond ( sundesmos) by means of an ineffable communion” ( DM</p>
<p>211, 16–18). The unifying power of philia defined the steps of theurgic ascent at the same time as it revealed the cosmogonic procession. In short, philia sustained both the cosmos and every act of theurgy.</p>
<p>Consequently, Iamblichus argued that the effective agent in theurgy was philia or, speaking Platonically, that eros drew the soul back to the gods (cf. DM 239, 6–13). Although the heavenly cycles described in the Phaedrus and the Timaeus were the goal to which a Platonist aspired, it was erotic madness that brought him there. According to the Chaldean Oracles, Eros was the first god born of the Paternal Father;14 Eros co-ordinated the Ideas in the intelligible world15 and, proceeding with them, knitted the cosmos together in a unified bond.16 In a word, the will of the Demiurge was revealed as Eros: 13. Dillon notes that it is only “through the Circuit of the Same within it” that the embodied soul, with the aid of theurgy, is allowed to rise above the material world; Dillon, trans., Iamblichi Chalcidensis, 342.</p>

<p>Eros and the One of the Soul</p>
<p>For after he conceived his works, the Self-generated Paternal Mind sowed the bond of love, heavy with fire, into all things . . . in order that the All might continue to love for an infinite time and that the things woven by the intellectual light of the Father might not collapse. . . . [It is] with this Love ( eros) that the elements of the world remain on course.17</p>
<p>According to the Oracles the Demiurge filled each soul with a “deep eros” ( eros bathus) to draw it back to the gods.18</p>
<p>The deep eros of the Oracles, like the innate gnosis or essential desire ( ephesis) of the De Mysteriis ( DM 7, 14; 8, 2), was present in the soul but anterior to consciousness. It was the desire that drew the soul down into a mortal body and led it back to its immortal ochema. The theurgist received this eros from the gods, and returned it to them in the form of a ritualized cosmos (cf. DM 210, 3–4; 211, 3–10). Embodiment was simply the pivot through which the eros of the Demiurge returned to itself.</p>
<p>In this light, the embodiment of the soul and the tension caused by its separation from divinity was not a fall or an error but the sine qua non to stimulate the circulation of Eros. For only in the embodied soul, in its self-alienation and inversion, could the divine genuinely experience separation, and consequently, an eros for itself.19 In the Timaeus Plato says that without the descent of souls into mortal bodies the universe would remain incomplete (41b, 8–9). Thus, theurgy saved the soul and the cosmos, for without the embodiment of the soul and its inversion ( anatrope), the divine could never yearn for itself, Eros would never arise as the “firstborn god,” and the cosmos would never come to exist. For a theurgist, his experience in a 17. CO, frag. 39, trans. Majercik, 62–65. For the will of the Demiurge being equivalent to the eros of the Oracles, see Friedrich W.

<p>Theurgy and the Soul</p>
<p>corporeal form was the linchpin of the cosmos: embodiment was a creative and sacramental act.</p>
<p>That the soul’s embodiment was the ultimate sunthema of its ascent remains an insoluble logical paradox, but appropriately, for the lover it is a commonplace experience. In the erotic dialectic discussed by Plato in the Symposium (200–202), the separation of the lover from the beloved was the sine qua non of their attraction and unification,20 and in Iamblichean theurgy the sunthema had the same function as the beloved ( eromenon) in Plato’s erotic ascent.</p>
<p>Both were sensible objects drawn from the elements to which the soul was bound, and both deified the soul through an act of creation.21 Theurgy, therefore, may be seen as the ritual elaboration of both the Platonic doctrines of eros and anamnesis.</p>
<p>It is perhaps appropriate to conclude Iamblichus’s vision of the embodied soul with a hagiographical image of Iamblichus himself.</p>
<p>In the Lives of the Philosophers, Eunapius reports that when Iamblichus journeyed to the baths of Gadara with his disciples he acceded to their demands to demonstrate his power. Eunapius says: There were two hot springs smaller than the others but prettier, and he [Iamblichus] bade his disciples ask the natives of the place by what names they used to be called in ancient times. When they had done his bidding they said: “There is no question about it, this spring is called Eros, and the name of the one next to it is Anteros.”22</p>

<li>J. Trouillard explains the unifying activity of Eros in the soul as “the active presence of the One in us,” and as much dependent on our “procession” as on our</li>
</ol>
<p>“return”; see Trouillard, “Sur un pluriel de Plotin et de Proclus,” Association Guillaume Budé 4 (1958): 90.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>In the Symposium Diotima defines the praxis and ergon of love: “To love,”</li>
</ol>
<p>she says, “is to bring forth upon the beautiful both in body and in soul” (206b, 7–8).</p>
<p>“The act of creation ( he gennesis),” she adds, “is the one deathless ( athanaton) and eternal ( aeigenes) element in our mortality” (206e, 7–8). In the Phaedrus, Plato says the erastes “would offer sacrifice to his beloved as to a holy image of deity” (251a, 6–</p>
<p>7); and at 253a he says the divine habits that the soul receives from the deity who possesses him are attributed to the beloved upon whom he pours out his love. See J.</p>

<ol start="22">
<li>Wright suggests the two Erotes of Themistius’s fable (304d) as a possible source for the names of these springs. Considering the profound similarity in the function of Platonic eromenoi and theurgic sunthemata, it is more likely that ppp</li>

<p>Eros and the One of the Soul</p>
<p>He at once touched the water with his hand—he happened to be sitting on the ledge of the spring where the overflow runs off—and uttering a brief summons, he called forth a boy from the depth of the spring. He was white-skinned and of medium height, his locks were golden and his back and breast shone; and he exactly resembled one who was bathing or had just bathed. His disciples were overwhelmed with amazement, but Iamblichus said, “Let us go to the next spring,” and he rose and led the way, with a thoughtful air.</p>
<p>Then he went through the same performance there also and summoned another Eros like the first in all respects, except that his hair was darker and fell loose in the sun. Both the boys embraced Iamblichus and clung to him as though he were genuinely their father.</p>
<p>He restored them to their proper places and went away after his bath, reverenced by his pupils.23</p>
<p>We need not concern ourselves about the veracity of this fabulous tale to appreciate its iconic truth. Perhaps no better image for the theurgist could be portrayed than this: Iamblichus himself, seated by an overflowing stream, invokes its Eros and having called it out, joins it—through his own body—to its responsive Anteros. All theurgy did the same: situated in the stream of generation, the theurgist invoked the eros of this stream to awaken the anteros hidden in his soul; in the hieratic moment of joining the divine to the divine the theurgist himself became a creator. Yet it was only by virtue of his embodiment and alienation from the gods that he was able to fulfill this task.24 In the theurgic act of an embodied soul, Eros was allowed to join itself and regenerate the bonds that unite the cosmos.</p>
