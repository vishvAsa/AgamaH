John initially sug-gested that I consider republishing my book two years ago, and after patiently sticking with the project, and with me, he has seen the process through. The present volume is an exact facsimile of the 1995 edition with the exception of a few typographical errors corrected from the original. Nothing else has been changed, which means that the scholarship on Iamblichus since 1995 has not been integrated into this republished text. Most significantly, my references to Iamblichus’s work on theurgy use Édouard des Places’ Jamblique: Les mystères d’Égypte (1966)—the standard academic text in 1995—rather than the fine English translation and text, Iamblichus: On the Mysteries by Emma C. Clarke, John M. Dillon, and Jackson P. Hershbell (2003) or the impressive text, translation, and annota-tion by Henri Dominique Saffrey and Alain-Philippe Segonds, *Jamblique: Résponse à Porphyre *( De Mysteriis) (2013). I also want to thank John Milbank and Aaron Riches who, when they learned of Angelico’s plan to republish my book, generously offered to write a Foreword in which they draw connections between Iamblichus’s theurgy and the theology of the Incarnation. Of their stimulating Foreword and the connections they make between the Christian sacramental vision and Iamblichean theurgy I have more to say.">

  <p>I wish to thank John Riess of Angelico Press for making possible the republication of . John initially sug-gested that I consider republishing my book two years ago, and after patiently sticking with the project, and with me, he has seen the process through. The present volume is an exact facsimile of the 1995 edition with the exception of a few typographical errors corrected from the original. Nothing else has been changed, which means that the scholarship on Iamblichus since 1995 has not been integrated into this republished text. Most significantly, my references to Iamblichus’s work on theurgy use Édouard des Places’ <em>Jamblique: Les mystères d’Égypte</em> (1966)—the standard academic text in 1995—rather than the fine English translation and text, <em>Iamblichus:</em> <em>On the Mysteries</em> by Emma C. Clarke, John M. Dillon, and Jackson P. Hershbell (2003) or the impressive text, translation, and annota-tion by Henri Dominique Saffrey and Alain-Philippe Segonds, *Jamblique: Résponse à Porphyre *( <em>De Mysteriis</em>) (2013). I also want to thank John Milbank and Aaron Riches who, when they learned of Angelico’s plan to republish my book, generously offered to write a Foreword in which they draw connections between Iamblichus’s theurgy and the theology of the Incarnation. Of their stimulating Foreword and the connections they make between the Christian sacramental vision and Iamblichean theurgy I have more to say.</p>
<p>Firstly, however, I want to reflect briefly on this book after living with it for nearly twenty years.</p>

<p>Emerson says the poet “speaks adequately . . . only when he speaks somewhat wildly.”1 The author of a poem touched by this wildness knows that what he speaks is past his understanding, and so too what he writes. When I initially completed  I scarcely understood what I had written.2 My engagement with Neoplatonic thinkers was like someone who has stumbled into a cave of gems. I found myself captivated by the depth and beauty of their ideas and then was even more fortunate to have been initiated into the intellectual subtlety of their vision by the late Neoplatonic scholar, Jean Trouillard. Through his writing, generosity, and hospi-tality, Trouillard revealed to me the living architecture of the world imagined by the Neoplatonists, and again, thanks to Trouillard, I was able to find my place in their world.  is a work of imagination inspired by his lucidity and warmth. It has passed successfully for twenty years as an academic study of the theurgic phase of Neoplatonism, but it is more the product of my exploration of the beauty I stumbled upon in that cave of gems—</p>
<p>the imagined world of the Neoplatonists.</p>
<p>As conceived by its principal architect, Iamblichus, theurgy may be defined as <em>divine activity communally shared</em>. It is not transcendent knowledge, something that might be grasped or experienced by an individual for, as Iamblichus put it, “it is impossible to participate individually in the universal orders, but only in communion with the divine choir of those lifted up together, united in mind.”3 As distinct from what often passes for Neoplatonism, even today, theurgic Neoplatonism did not culminate in an elevated state disengaged 1.

<p>from the messiness of our day to day existence (the <em>escape</em> from mundane reality often associated with Plotinus). The inequalities and suffering of mortal life, all that we experience in our mundane lives, was <em>included</em> in the theurgic vision of Iamblichus. It is a radically non-dual vision that sees the physical world as radiantly transformed, not rejected or denied in favor of a “spiritual” reality. I was drawn to Iamblichus’s vision and my feeling today about <em>Theurgy</em> <em>and the Soul</em> is largely unchanged. In the last twenty years, significant scholarship on theurgy has been published in the fields of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Magic, and Sacramental Theology. These studies have taken us much further into the subtleties of theurgic Neoplatonism and the cultural contexts in which it developed; I hope that my work on theurgy may have contributed to some of this impressive research.4 Most notably the fine scholarship of Wayne Hankey has shown the crucial importance of Iamblichean theurgy in the history of Western philosophy and in the development of contemporary French Neoplatonists in particular. In the practical appropriation of theurgy I have been impressed by Sam Webster’s measured integration of theurgic Neoplatonism with his Open Source community of the Golden Dawn, indicating an interface between what has long been an occult magical tradition and academic scholarship.5 Perhaps most striking is the importance given to Iamblichean theurgy by John Milbank and other theologians of Radical Orthodoxy for whom the metaphysics and <em>praxis</em> of Iamblichus’s sacramental vision play a critical role in transfiguring a world that has been drained of all depth, meaning, and divinity. The spiritual wasteland of our age, rightly lamented by Milbank, had been predicted by Iamblichus himself to Porphyry, the editor of Plotinus’</p>
<p><em>Enneads</em>. Iamblichus prophesied darkly that Porphyry’s conviction 4. Scholars who have deepened my understanding of Neoplatonic theurgy since 1995 include Sara Rappe, Algis Uzďavinys, Robbert Van Den Berg, John Dillon, John Finamore, Henri Saffrey, Sarah Johnston, Emma Clarke, Wayne Hankey, Edward Butler, Dominic O’Meara, Zeke Mazur, John Bussanich, Angela Voss, Radek Chlup, Tuomo Lankila, Ilinca Tanaseanu-Döbler, and Polymnia Athanassiadi. I am sure to have overlooked others since our discipline has grown tremen-dously.</p>

<p>that gods are too spiritual to be engaged in material rites is a belief that empties our world of divinity:</p>
<p>This doctrine [Iamblichus says] spells the ruin of all holy ritual and theurgic communion between gods and men, since it places the presence of superior beings outside the earth. It amounts to saying that the divine is at a distance from the earth and cannot mingle with men, and that this lower region is a desert, without gods.6</p>
<p>In direct contrast to this bleak vision, Iamblichean theurgy aims to sustain the continuity of the gods with our physical world—this lower region—by recognizing their presence in material existence: in animals, plants, and even in stones, and further, that human beings have the capacity to engage this presence by ritually embodying the divine activity, the <em>theurgy</em>, through which it is revealed.</p>
<p>For a Platonist and Pythagorean the cosmos is theophany, and theurgy is the <em>praxis</em> through which human beings enter and embody the divine revelation that is the cosmos and natural world.</p>
<p>Iamblichus thus avoided the temptation, so prevalent in his age, to escape from material reality** **and split the world in two. For Iamblichus *the highest is in the lowest. * The ineffable One beyond being is present in the densest material reality. The ineffable unities, the henadic gods, are not isolated in some exalted “place” but are revealed symbolically in <em>unifying activities</em> seen, felt, and encountered in our mundane world.7 In Iamblichus’s cosmology, the powers emanating from the One are received and orchestrated by a noetic activity personified by Plato as a Demiurge who weaves these divine powers into a living cosmos. Thus, the highest and most 6. <em>On the Mysteries</em>, * * 28.4–8, translated by Peter Brown, <em>The Making of Late</em> <em>Antiquity</em> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978), 101. I have modified his translation. The reference to <em>On the Mysteries</em> in the Preface is to <em>Iamblichus: On the</em> <em>Mysteries</em>, translated with introduction and notes by Emma C. Clarke, John M. Dillon, and Jackson P. Hershbell (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2003); the numeration refers to the Parthey marginal numbers of Iamblichus’s text.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Iamblichus says that daimons reveal the will of the gods “neither by disclosure nor by concealment,” that is, not as one would reveal or conceal objective information. In Iamblichean theophany the divine <em>remains</em> <em>hidden in its disclosure</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Iamblichus believes this is the way of cosmogenesis and of the sacred traditions that embody it: an activity he describes as <em>symbolic</em> ( <em>On the Mysteries</em>, 136.1–7).</p>

<p>hidden spiritual principles unfold and are revealed through our evanescent and material reality—including all the passions of the human condition—and theurgy is the art of learning how to receive this procession** **in a way that mimics—no, even more—that <em>incarnates</em> the demiurgy that continually creates and sustains our world.</p>
<p>To ignore and disparage material reality would thus ignore its divinity and, inevitably, our own. It would make the world, as Iamblichus feared, “a desert, without gods.” Yet we live in that desert and have lived in it for a very long time, so it is difficult for us to recover the non-dual vision of Iamblichean theurgy, difficult to rediscover life-giving water hidden in our desert.</p>
<p>It is here that I fully appreciate the work of John Milbank, Aaron Riches, and others in Radical Orthodoxy in their effort to recover the sacramental in human existence. With their vision of the Incarnation as center-piece to Christian theology, they seek to free us from the dark spell of a world ruled by a technologized rationality applied to merely material and physical existence. It is a kind of enchantment that one can only describe as grotesque and abysmal: the numbing weight of the world we live in. It is clear that we need a sophisticated response to this dark spell, and it will do us no good to embrace a pre-modern and idyllic vision. It requires integrating and redirecting the intellectual currents that have shaped our world. Most importantly, it requires that we recover a deep symbolic imagination that has the power to effect our transformation but—and this is critical—at the same time, re-coordinate our discursive powers in relation to this imagination. This is the monu-mental task that Milbank has heroically— <em>madly</em>—taken on his shoulders and I admire him for it.</p>
<p>The linchpin of Milbank’s theology is the symbol, the living reality, of the Incarnation, for in the full descent of divinity into our world, the world becomes saturated with divine presence that allows it, henceforth, to be experienced as sacred. Much of the work of Radical Orthodoxy, it seems to me, is concerned, on the one hand, with examining the intellectual habits that prevent us from being able to experience this sacramental presence and, on the other, with attempting to redirect our thinking to the poetic sources that open us to the sacramental. In theurgic terms, they are performing an xxiii</p>
<hr>
<p>intellectual incantation to free us from our dark trance. In the imagination of Milbank and Riches, the Incarnation is far greater in scope than the singular event of the life of Jesus. Rather, the Incarnation initiates the valorization of all material reality as evident in their quotation of John of Damascus who, in light of the Incarnation, imagines that <em>all</em> matter has become “filled with divine energy and grace.” It is here that Iamblichus’s emphasis on the penetration of the One throughout all material existence,8 provides precisely the metaphysical principle needed to support a more profound and expan-sive understanding of the Incarnation. Like the vision of Iamblichean theurgy—and the theology of John of Damascus—Milbank and Riches extend the boundaries of the Incarnation to include the entire material world. And in this sense they rightly see a “convergence” between Neoplatonic theurgy and Incarnational theology.</p>
<p>Yet, despite this convergence, Milbank and Riches also point to a difference, the *key * difference, between the theurgy of Iamblichus and Christian theurgy. It is this: in Neoplatonic theurgy the material cosmos is an <em>agalma</em>, a shrine of the Demiurge ( <em>Timaeus</em> 37c); the cosmos itself reveals the presence of gods. That is, the natural world for Iamblichean Platonists is a theophany. Far from being</p>
<p>“fallen,” nature itself is the face and living symbol of the divine: nature is the <em>incarnation</em> of divine realities <em>ab ovo</em>. From this perspective, the Incarnational theology of the Church enters this theophanic current *downstream * and embraces theurgic realities that had already been spelled out by Platonists and in a manner significantly different from Christian theology. Jean Trouillard addressed these issues in a different context but one that is germane. He observed that “certain Christian authors speak of the presence of the divine in the same terms as the Neoplatonists,” leading some to assert an “influence or spontaneous convergence” of thinking. Yet, he observes, identical language can “mask heterogeneous thoughts”</p>

<p>( <em>recouvrir pensées hétérogènes</em>).9 I would like to explore these differences, not to rebut the insights of Milbank and Riches concerning the Christian Incarnation and Neoplatonic theurgy, but to provide a richer context for understanding both.</p>
<p>In Christian theology the cosmos is not the privileged revelation of the divine, the shining <em>agalma</em> of the <em>Timaeus</em>. Here the Christian and Platonic myths diverge: the Platonic myth is cosmocentric, the Christian anthropocentric. In the Christian myth nature becomes “fallen” and needs redemption. The Incarnation of the Divine Man in history is necessary to redeem nature and the material order; yet, after the event of the Incarnation, the material cosmos has the same function as the material cosmos of Iamblichus with one significant difference: for Iamblichus the sacramental power of matter does not require the Incarnation of Christ. The material realm is, and has always been, inalterably and intrinsically sacramental. For the Neoplatonist there is no need for a “new creation,” no need to be redeemed <em>from</em> a fallen nature, for <em>nature itself</em> *is the body of our salvation. * The ongoing and natural expression of demiurgy reveals the choreography of an ancient and everlasting theophany. This is why Iamblichus insists that all theurgy must be in “<em>analogia</em> with creation.” Theurgic activity was always—in <em>analogia</em>—cosmogonic activity, and this is what distinguishes it from sorcery ( <em>goeteia</em>).10 Iamblichus thus honored the Egyptians as sacred people precisely because their rituals mimetically reflect the demiurgy of the gods. Theoretically, any culture could be theurgic if its rites and prayers preserve the “eternal measures” of creation.11</p>
<p>The question is whether this difference between the Platonic and Christian myths has significant consequences “downstream,” i.e., after the Incarnation.</p>
<p>It may. For Iamblichus the theurgic rites of each sacred race 9. Jean Trouillard, *L’Un et l’âme selon Proclos *(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1972), 5.</p>

<p>revealed the gods in modes appropriate to their respective cultures.</p>
<p>Neoplatonic theurgy was imagined within a polytheistic and plural-istic cosmos: the varieties of culture and geography corresponding to the diversity of theurgic societies. This was also consistent with Iamblichus’s metaphysics where the utterly ineffable One can only be “known” in the Many, the henophany of each culture both veil-ing and revealing its ineffable source. To privilege any one of these henophanies over the others, to proclaim that it alone is true, is an assertion that would have been treated with contempt by theurgic Neoplatonists.12 For such a claim betrays the very principle of theurgy understood as cosmogonic activity rooted in an <em>ineffable</em> source, one that necessarily expresses itself in <em>multiple</em> forms of demiurgic generosity. Theurgists would find claims to an exclusive possession of truth equivalent to the deranged assertion that the sun shines only in my backyard! These are delicate matters, but it needs to be explored in what sense Christian theology remains divergent from Neoplatonic theurgy, and I believe we may find clues in that most theurgic and Neoplatonic of Christians, Dionysius the Areopagite.</p>
<p>It is now well-known that Dionysius appropriated theurgy to shape his understanding of the sacraments. Indeed, in the writings of the Areopagite we find some of the richest evidence for theurgic worship, and since Iamblichus gives few concrete examples one could find no more striking evidence of how theurgic rites were performed than in the liturgical writings of Dionysius. Yet there is an almost imperceptible shift in Dionysius away from the cosmocentric roots of Platonic myth. For example in <em>Divine Names</em> Dionysius uses the term *para phusin *(opposed to nature) synonymously with <em>huper</em> <em>phusin</em> (above/before nature) to describe the miracle of the Incarnation.13 For Iamblichus, the term “supernatural” ( <em>huper phues</em>)—</p>

<p>Thus, Julian’s effort to re-Hellenize the Empire based on Iamblichean teachings was inevitably a distortion of Iamblichus’s less hegemonic vision. Yet, it is one thing to serve as a sage, surrounded by one’s students in Apamea, quite another to attempt to govern an Empire. The social context is inevitably important in shaping one’s metaphysical system.

<p>which he coined—could never be opposed to nature ( <em>para ten</em> <em>phusin</em>). To be <em>para phusin</em> was to be opposed to <em>phusis</em>, to nature, and thus, to theophany.14 <em>Huper phues</em> is not in any way opposed to nature nor did it refer to a separate “supernatural world” as it has come to be conceived; rather, it refers to divine powers that are continually revealed <em>through</em> nature. For Pythagoreans like Iamblichus, numbers, like gods, are also supernatural: they are anterior principles that unfold into the physical world. With Dionysius the sensitivity to <em>phusis</em> as theophany is diminished, if not lost, and we see a shift away from Platonic cosmocentricism. The *ecclesia * assumes the divine status that had previously been ascribed to the material cosmos in Neoplatonic theurgy. This shift was noted by A.H. Armstrong who said: “It is the ecclesiastical cosmos, not the natural cosmos, which appears to be of primary religious importance for the Christian. There is here a new and radical sort of religious anthropocentricism. . . .”15 Despite the homologization of the Church to the world in the <em>Mystagogia</em> of Maximus the Confessor *, * 16</p>
<p>the shift from cosmocentric to anthropocentric had been established. One must ask, then, if Christian theurgy can still claim to be—in <em>analogia</em>—cosmogonic and, if not, whether it is theurgy at all. Such questions go beyond the bounds of this Preface, but it seems to me from the evidence of Milbank’s and Riches’ reading of their tradition that this divergence may not be altogether definitive.</p>
<p>For example, their understanding of prayer as an “attunement” with the divine that allows its influence to “flow into reality” is entirely theurgic <em>and</em> Christian. The question, however, has to do with how that flow is imagined and here, again, we might discern an even more interesting convergence *and * divergence of the two traditions.</p>

<p>Milbank and Riches invite us to consider a convergence in the</p>
<p>“common paradox that is the heart of being” for both theurgic Neoplatonism and Christianity. Neoplatonic theurgy—they observe, alluding to a central Incarnational theme—requires a kind of “kenosis of mind . . . that plunges downward into matter, into the simplicity and non-reflexivity of material being” to give the soul a receptacle <em>undivided by thought</em> and thus capable of receiving the powers of the One. This paradox of going <em>below</em> form to receive what is *above * form is already evident in the *Timaeus * since the maternal principle of matter, the <em>chora</em>, must be utterly formless to serve as receptacle and nurse through whom all Forms come to exist.17 This paradox, at the core of demiurgy, is necessarily re-enacted in theurgic rites that employ what Iamblichus calls the</p>
<p>“pure and divine form of matter.”18 The nature of this theurgic-demiurgic paradox has its correspondence, as one might expect, in the human soul. For Christians the paradox is represented through the image of Jesus Christ, the Paradox Incarnate, while for theurgical Neoplatonists paradox defines every human soul and reflects the paradox of the One itself.19 Again, there is thematic convergence between Neoplatonic theurgy and Christianity: paradox as essential for continuity with the divine; and yet there is also divergence: this paradox is conceived in distinctly different ways. The paradox of the incarnate Christ is at the very core of Christian sacramental life, a 17. <em>Timaeus</em>, 50e.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Iamblichus maintained that the power of the One pervades all things undividedly and thus establishes the <em>continuity</em> of all existence, yet since the One stops to define each existence as “one” it also establishes *discontinuity. * As Iamblichus puts it: “its power encompasses both halting and proceeding at the same time” (Simplicius, <em>In</em> <em>Categ</em>. 135.8ff). The theurgist would realize that the soul’s contraction into an isolated and individual mortal life was as much an expression of the power of the One as was its reintegration into the continuity of the whole. To deny discontinuity in favor of continuity, the material in favor of the immaterial, mortal for immortal, would cut the soul out of the activity the One and its demiurgic expression. In sum, for human souls to become divine, they must remain mortal. Such reflections on the One are radically non-dual, and this is explored in remarkably clear terms by ppp</p>

In the formula of the Council of Chalcedon Jesus Christ is defined as “truly god and truly man . . . consubstantial ( <em>homoousios</em>) with the Father according to the Godhead and consubstantial ( <em>homoousios</em>) with us according to his humanity.” These two natures, divine and human, are present in one person, and through this utterly paradoxical image of the God who has become man, an immortal mortal, Christians find their continuity with the divine.</p>
<p>The divergence with Neoplatonic theurgy may appear significant here, but the formal heterogeneity masks an underlying similarity that can best be described as <em>incarnational</em>. One of the most significant contributions of Iamblichus to Neoplatonism is his insistence—against Plotinus and Porphyry—that the human soul descends fully into a body and is subject to all the consequences of mortal existence. According to Iamblichus the soul is defined as the mean between divisible and indivisible, corporeal and incorporeal beings; [it is] the totality of the universal ratios ( <em>logoi</em>) which, after the Forms, serves the work of creation; [the soul is]</p>
<p>that Life which, having proceeded from the Intellect, has life itself and is the procession of the classes of Real Being as a whole to an inferior status.20</p>

<p>mortal. ** **This no longer allows the soul to return by introspection to an “unfallen” state, as Plotinus had taught. The soul is more deeply implicated in the material world, and yet, as a Platonist, Iamblichus believed the soul is also immortal, which leads him to some profoundly paradoxical conclusions. Iamblichus’s definition of the human soul, of <em>every</em> human soul, includes paradoxes as dramatic as those invoked at Chalcedon. According to Iamblichus</p>
<p>the soul is a mean ( <em>mese</em>), not only between the divided and the undivided, the remaining and the proceeding, the noetic and the irrational, but also between the ungenerated and the generated. . . .</p>
<p>Thus, <em>that which is immortal in the soul is filled completely with</em> *mortality and no longer remains only immortal. * 21</p>
<p>The kenosis of a Savior who empties himself of divinity to take on mortality, the paradoxical generosity of the God who becomes mortal man is, for Neoplatonic theurgy, the condition of <em>every * human soul. The convergence <em>and * divergence with Christianity are here</em></em>. **</p>
<p>We ourselves are the Paradox Incarnate: immortal beings filled completely with mortality. This paradox of the soul is heightened by Iamblichus to such an acute degree that only Damascius in the 5th century was able to endure it. The Iamblichean soul is a *coinci-dentia oppositorum; * becoming incarnate changes not merely its activities but its very essence: our unity becomes divided, our immortality mortal, and our identity a form of self-alienation. As Iamblichus puts it, as embodied souls we are “made other” ( <em>het-eroiousthai</em>) to ourselves.22 “Self-alienation” ( <em>allotriothen</em>) constitutes our existence.23 Yet it is only through this experience of self-alienation that we are able to mediate the ongoing demiurgy of the cosmos. ** **Herein lies the paradox for Neoplatonic theurgy.

Haasl (Brussels: Paleis der Academien, 1978), 16–20. Steel’s book continues to be the single most important source for understanding the consequences and paradoxes of Iamblichus’s psychology.</p>

<p><em>Preface</em></p>
<p>mean of cosmogenesis, the human soul cooperates with the Demiurge by creatively weaving unity with multiplicity and allowing the Forms to become embodied. Milbank and Riches have this precisely correct: in theurgy the soul is called on to imitate and to cooperate with the activity of the Demiurge. Yet to perform this mediation the soul must necessarily embrace dividedness, weakness, and mortality. Ironically and paradoxically, the soul’s identity with the Demiurge is realized only through self-alienation and division; only through our dividedness and contingency can we enter the unifying activity of the Demiurge. It is the unique character of the human soul that its immortality and universality are discovered and expressed in a particular and mortal form. To escape mortality, therefore, would forego our only path to immortality. Christianity expresses this paradox through the Incarnation that redeems the world and presents a paradoxical model of losing-finding/giving-receiving, that Christians emulate in order to participate in the mystery of the Incarnation. Neoplatonic theurgists recognize this paradox but, again, they see it as an expression of cosmogenesis and as rooted in the essential structure of *every * human soul.</p>
<p>For Iamblichus, the paradox at the heart of being is manifest to an acute degree in theurgic rites where the soul experiences its paradox fully. Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>The whole of theurgy presents a double aspect. One is that it is conducted by men, which preserves our natural rank in the universe; the other is that, being empowered by divine symbols, it is raised up through them to be united with the gods and is led harmoniously into their order. This can rightly be called taking the shape of the gods.24</p>
<p>The theurgist takes the shape of a god while remaining human and preserving our mortal rank in the universe. Iamblichus was careful not to erase the distinction between humans and gods as he believed Plotinus had done.25 In <em>On the Mysteries</em> he tells Porphyry 24. <em>On the Mysteries</em>, 184.1–8.</p>
<ol start="25">

</ol>
<p>xxxi</p>
<p>that human beings are “weak and small, possessed by a congenital nothingness ( <em>oudeneia</em>).”26 He protects the experience of deification from our titanic intellectual appetite by maintaining a clear distinction between the divine and human. Yet, while he tells Porphyry plainly that “the divine has nothing in common with us,”27 he also says theurgic prayer “increases our divine eros ( <em>theion erota</em>) and kindles the divine element of the soul ( <em>to theion tes psyches</em>).”28 The paradox of Iamblichean theurgy is that both statements are true; both reflect the itinerary of theurgic deification. The theurgist remains human yet takes the shape of the gods. The language of Chalcedon is remarkably similar. Christ is described as possessing two natures, divine and human, that remain unmixed despite their</p>
<p>“union” in the person of Christ. The theurgist also possesses two natures, divine and human, that remain distinct while being embodied by the theurgist. The expression of paradox in theurgic ritual is the culmination of a mediating itinerary that begins when the immortal soul becomes mortal and ends when the embodied soul recovers its immortality and “takes the shape of the gods,” yet it is a deification that occurs only by virtue of the theurgist <em>remaining</em> mortal.</p>
<p>The convergence Milbank and Riches see with Neoplatonic theurgy lies not merely in this incarnational paradox; there is, in the Neoplatonic vision an essential element that breathes through the entire cosmos and is felt most especially in theurgic activity: the generosity of the Demiurge ( *Timaeus * 29e). For theurgists the world is the manifestation of this generosity, our descent into bodies is an expression of this generosity, and our deification in theurgic rites is effected, Iamblichus says, by this same generosity ( <em>apthonos</em>).29 In Christian terms, as articulated by Milbank and Riches, this generosity is imag-26. <em>On the Mysteries</em>, 144.10–11. In his <em>De Anima</em> commentary Iamblichus says that embodied souls are “confined in one single form and divided out among bodies” (Finamore and Dillon, op. cit., 373.26). Thus, as embodied, the human soul is identified with and limited by its physical body.</p>

<p>They describe it as God’s love and—as in Neoplatonic theurgy—</p>
<p>they see this expressed through the paradox and gift of the Incarnation: gift and paradox being the “fundamental dimensions” of Christian theology.</p>
<p>In <em>On the Mysteries</em>, Iamblichus’s defense of worship seems to anticipate modern critics of religion and may also help to situate theurgy in today’s Church. He says:</p>
<p>If these forms of worship were only human customs and received their authority from our cultural habits, one might argue that the cults of the gods were inventions created by our thinking. But in fact the one invoked in sacrifices is a God, and he presides over these sacrifices,30 and a great number of gods and angels surround him. And every race on earth is allotted a common guardian by this God, and every temple is also allotted a particular guardian.31</p>
<p>In a world replete with divine powers, the task of theurgists was to discover a way of honoring each divinity in a manner appropriate to its specific qualities and related to the place in which it was received.</p>
<p>The geographic features of each place would reveal the appropriate mode of worship to a discerning eye. Yet our culture has long since moved out of this cosmocentric vision of the Neoplatonists. Nature is no longer an imaginal landscape of divinities. The world has been drained of its sanctity, and with it, so have we. Yet, in a way that would surely have surprised Iamblichus, who deigned not even to speak of Christians,32 it is clear that elements of his theurgic vision have survived within the church and are now being applied creatively to a community and culture—Christian <em>and</em> post-Christian—that are in desperate need of revival. While the formal character of Milbank’s and Riches’ theology may be foreign to Iamblichus’s Platonism, they share an underlying impulse that, to my mind, reflects Iamblichus’s statement that to “<em>every race on earth</em> <em>is allotted a Common Guardian</em>.” These Christian thinkers, these 30. John Dillon suggests that this god is the Demiurgic Nous who presides over all other gods and divinities; see <em>On the Mysteries</em>, 273, footnote 350.</p>

<p><em>theurgists</em>, are heroically addressing the aching need of their Christian and post-Christian community. In their service to this community they serve its Guardian and, with their Incarnational theology, they are breathing life back into a culture that desperately needs to become <em>incarnate</em>. I may be more securely held by the parameters of the Platonic myth than the Christian, but I have learned a great deal from Milbank and Riches about the theurgic function of the incarnate soul in Christianity <em>and</em> in Neoplatonism. For this, especially, I thank them.</p>
