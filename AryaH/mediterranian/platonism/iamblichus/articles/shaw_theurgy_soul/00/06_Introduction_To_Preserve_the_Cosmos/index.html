  <p><em>To no man is it permitted to</em></p>
<p>*change these prayers. . . . *</p>
<p>At the end of the fourth century c.e. the decline of traditional pagan culture had come to focus on the temples of the gods, the last vestige of the “<em>old ways</em>.” By 386 sacrifices to the gods had been outlawed and temples were being vandalized by Christian monks. To protect the pagan shrines the orator Libanius appealed to Emperor Theodosius, saying:</p>
<p>They [the monks] are spreading out like torrents across the countryside; and in ruining the temples, they are also ruining the countryside itself at one and the same time. <em>For to snatch from a region</em> <em>the temple which protects it is like tearing out its eye, killing it, annihilating it</em>. The temples are the very life of the countryside; around them are built houses and villages, in their shadow a succession of generations have been born up until the present day. It is in those temples that farmers have placed their hopes for themselves and their wives and children, for their oxen and for the ground they have sown or planted. A country region whose temple has been destroyed in this manner is lost, because the despairing villagers no longer have the will to work. It would be pointless to exert themselves, they think, because they have been deprived of the gods who made their labors prosper.1</p>
<p>Despite Libanius’s plea it was too late. The countryside had already been “blinded” and the gods were being driven from the land.2 For 1. Libanius, <em>Pro templis</em> 30.8; quoted by H.D. Saffrey, “The Piety and Prayers of Ordinary Men and Women in Late Antiquity,” in <em>Classical Mediterranean Spirituality</em>, ed. A.H. Armstrong (New York: Crossroad, 1986), 200.</p>

<p>1</p>
<hr>
<p>pagans, the loss of these shrines marked the end of a way of life: it severed their contact with the gods, threatened their society, and disturbed the order of nature.</p>
<p>The sentiments of Libanius reflect the despair of a culture that only two generations earlier had been far more hopeful. When the Roman imperial court first came under Christian influence during the reign of Constantine (312–336 c.e.), the leading thinkers of the pagan world turned to the Syrian Platonist, Iamblichus (c. 240–c.</p>
<p>325 c.e.), for spiritual and intellectual leadership.3 An official of Emperor Licinius praised Iamblichus as “benefactor of the entire world,” “universal blessing of the Hellenes,” and “[the] one ap-pointed by the gods to be the savior of the entire Hellenic world.”4</p>
<p>Such praise was not mere hyperbole. Only one generation after Iamblichus’s death, the emperor Julian employed the Platonic and theurgic doctrines of Iamblichus in an attempt to wrest control of the empire away from the “Galileans” and return it to the ancestral practices of the “Hellenes.” In “the divine Iamblichus” Julian saw a philosopher equal to Plato, for Iamblichus’s teachings had led Julian and other pagans to a deeper understanding of their traditional religious practices. Specifically, Iamblichus revealed the integral connection between the rituals of cultic worship and the intellectual disciplines of philosophic <em>paideia</em>. Such an integration had been the goal of Plato himself, and by the fourth century c.e. it was crucial for the survival of Hellenic (i.e., non-Christian) religions. Julian recognized this and intended to re-paganize the empire on Iamblichean lines.5 In his short reign (361–363) he refurbished the temples, restored a state priesthood, and praised the gods in hymns following 3. For a biographical sketch of Iamblichus see John Dillon, “Iamblichus of Chalcis,” <em>Aufstieg und Niedergang der Römischen Welt</em> ( <em>ANRW</em>), vol. 2, 16.2 (New York: de Gruyter, 1987), 863–78.</p>

<p>Iamblichean doctrine. Yet Julian’s enterprise ended abruptly with his death in 363 c.e. and by the end of the fourth century—apart from a small group of philosophical elite—the death of his world had all but transpired and the pagan gods had been exiled from the Christian empire.</p>
<p>Iamblichus lived at a critical juncture in the history of the late antique world. As foremost Platonist of his time and designated</p>
<p>“savior” of Hellenic culture, one might expect the “god-inspired Syrian” to have been a leading figure in the pagan polemic against Christianity. After all, his teacher Porphyry had been one of Christianity’s most formidable opponents. Yet there is no extant writing of Iamblichus in which he criticizes, or even mentions, Christianity.</p>
<p>For Iamblichus, the central issue of his age was not the polemic between pagans and Christians but the far more serious conflict between “old ways” and “new ways,” between the ancient traditions inspired by the gods and those recently invented by man.</p>
<p>Iamblichus was not a proponent of “Hellenic” culture in the manner of his enthusiastic student Julian. Indeed, writing in the persona of Abammon, an Egyptian priest, Iamblichus claimed in the <em>De</em> <em>Mysteriis</em> 6 that “Hellenes” had already abandoned their religious heritage, and he blamed them for the loss of sanctity in his age: At the present time I think this is the reason everything has fallen into a state of decay—both in our [sacred] words and prayers—it is because they are continually being changed by the endless innovations and lawlessness of the Hellenes. For the Hellenes are by nature followers of the latest trends and are eager to be carried off in any direction, possessing no stability in themselves. Whatever they may have received from other traditions they do not preserve, but even this they immediately reject and change everything through their unstable habit of seeking the latest terms. ( *DM * 259, 5–14) Iamblichus’s tirade against the Greeks should not surprise us, for Plato himself censured the Greeks with almost identical charges, 6. The standard edition is <em>Jamblique: Les mystères d’Egypte</em>, * * trans. and ed. E. des Places (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1966). Also useful is Thomas Taylor’s translation, <em>Iamblichus on the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians</em>, * * 2d ed. (London: Bertram Dobell, 1895). References to the *De Mysteriis * will be noted by *DM. *</p>
<p>3</p>

<p>and he blamed the cultural demise of his own era on the innovations of Hellenic thinkers ( <em>Laws</em> 657a). Such anti-Hellenic criticism was, in fact, a topos in Plato’s writings, as was his exaltation of barbarian races (especially Egyptian) in contrast to the unstable Greeks. Iamblichus similarly praised the Egyptians and explained the power of their hieratic rites:</p>
<p>Understand that since the Egyptians were first to be allotted the participation in the Gods, the Gods are pleased when invoked according to the custom of the Egyptians [ <em>DM</em> 258, 3–6]. . . . The barbarians, since they are fixed in their manners, firmly continue to employ the same words. Thus they are beloved by the Gods and offer invocations pleasing to them. To no man is it permitted to change these prayers in any way. ( <em>DM</em> 259, 14–19) For Iamblichus, the crisis of the fourth century had little to do with Christianity. As a Platonist he felt responsible to preserve humanity’s contact with the gods, so his concern was not with Christians or with any other group that promised to replace the</p>
<p>“old” order with a “new” one. As Plato put it, such purveyors of</p>
<p>“new styles” could never corrupt the “sacred” traditions rooted in the cosmic gods ( <em>Laws</em> 657b). Yet Iamblichus was more than a Platonist, he was also one of the holy barbarians of whom he speaks. A Syrian by birth, Iamblichus chose not to hellenize his Semitic name, as was the fashion among educated and well-to-do families;7 rather, like his own pious barbarians he remained loyal to a holy ancestry.</p>
<p>Descended from the royal blood of the priest-kings of Emesa—several of whom bore his name8—Iamblichus possessed a unique perspective to reinterpret Plato’s esteem for those races who maintained an unbroken contact with the gods. In Iamblichus’s estimation the responsibility of Platonists to value and explore this contact had recently been ignored and Plato’s cosmological principles overlooked due to an excessive rationalism in Platonic schools. This rationalism exalted the powers of the mind while diminishing the 7. His contemporary, Porphyry, by contrast, was born with the Phoenician name Malchos; John Dillon, “Iamblichus of Chalcis,” 864.</p>

<p>prestige of the traditional cults of the gods that, in Iamblichus’s view, were the basis for all genuine culture and wisdom. It is ironic, but the exile of the Hellenic gods lamented by Libanius in the fourth century may well have been initiated by the antipathies of leading Hellenic thinkers toward the powers of the sensible cosmos and the cults that venerated them.9</p>
<p>To appreciate Iamblichus’s contribution to the late antique world and to the Platonic tradition we must understand the crisis of the age as he did. Only then can we understand why Iamblichus placed <em>theourgia</em> (god-work) at the heart of Platonic disciplines, why he preferred it to <em>theologia</em> (god-talk), and why his soteriology was intimately tied to the invocation of the natural powers of the cosmos. Iamblichus believed that the world described by Plato in the <em>Timaeus</em> was being torn apart by a new kind of Platonism that denied the sanctity of the world and elevated the human mind beyond its natural limits. According to Iamblichus such rationalistic hubris threatened to separate man from the activity of the gods, and he presented theurgy as the antidote to restore contact with the divine order.</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s distinction between theurgy and theology is crucial for understanding his Platonism.10 For theology was merely <em>logos</em>, a</p>
<p>“discourse about the gods,” and however exalted, it remained a human activity, as did philosophy. Theurgy, on the other hand, was a <em>theion ergon</em>, a “work of the gods” capable of transforming man to a divine status. Although the term <em>theourgia</em>, originated with second-century Platonists to describe the deifying power of Chaldean rituals—some of which were believed to be transmitted by the soul of Plato himself11—it was Iamblichus who provided a philosophic rationale for the performance of these rites and ensured that theurgy 9. The pronounced rationality among philosophers of late antiquity, including their distaste for cultic activity, is described by Pierre Hadot, <em>Exercices spirituels et</em> *philosophie antique *(Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1981), 237–38.</p>

<p>would become an integral part of the Platonic vocabulary. In Platonic terms, theurgy fulfilled the goal of philosophy understood as a <em>homoiosis theo</em>. The rituals themselves, Iamblichus explained, varied according to the capacities of its participants, and though he provided little information about particulars, it is clear that many “theurgic” rites were already well known to the Hellenic world. In the hands of Iamblichus, theurgy represented a revaluation of traditional cult practices. Iamblichus maintained that the divine principles invoked in these rites were exemplified abstractly and theoretically in the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, and that both cultic acts and philosophic <em>paideia</em> were rooted in one source: the ineffable power of the gods. In theurgy these divine principles were embodied and enacted, not merely contemplated, and in whatever context this occurred it was a “work of the gods,” a <em>theourgia</em> in which the human soul participated both as recipient and beneficiary.</p>
<p>As a Platonist, Iamblichus defended the practice of theurgy according to the canons of the Platonic tradition. Therefore, any attempt to understand Iamblichean theurgy must follow the Platonic themes that Iamblichus himself was so careful to explain. Of central concern to Iamblichus was Plato’s description of the cosmos and its role in the education and deification of the soul. As we shall see, it was the issue of the soul’s place in the sensible cosmos that divided Iamblichus and all subsequent theurgical Platonists from the nontheurgical Platonism of Plotinus and Porphyry.</p>
<p>In the <em>De Mysteriis</em>, Iamblichus the philosopher argued that Plato’s teachings were integrally related to the sacred traditions of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians; and as a theurgist, he explained and defended his tradition using Platonic categories. In so doing Iamblichus established a new synthesis of cult and philosophy, becoming the first leader of a Platonic school to function simultaneously as hierophant of a sacred cult.12 The synthesis of 12. Not surprisingly, Iamblichus’s Pythagoras was portrayed as the exemplary spiritual man, combining cultic worship and philosophy in his teachings.

<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>these diverse modes of thought in Iamblichus’s school deeply influenced and, in some measure, defined the soteriological thinking of the later Platonists and other inheritors of Platonic thought.</p>
<p>The great influence Iamblichus exercised over subsequent Platonists was due, in large part, to the theoretical framework he outlined in the <em>De Mysteriis</em> for a wide variety of divinational rites practiced in the late antique world. On the one hand it was a great theoretical achievement to have demonstrated how the abstract tenets of the Platonists were exemplified concretely in time-honored divinational rites. Yet in practical terms, as the Church increasingly began to persecute pagans and outlaw their religious practices in the later fourth century, Iamblichus’s apology for traditional pagan forms of worship and divination gained far more than theoretical significance. The <em>De Mysteriis</em> and Iamblichean theurgy became the foundation for the resurgence and continued life of Platonic communities until the closing of the Athenian Academy by Justinian in 529 c.e. and later—for Platonists in exile—in the frontier city of Harran where Iamblichean Platonism ultimately passed into Arab hands and thrived until the tenth century.13</p>
<p>It should be recognized that the author of the <em>De Mysteriis</em> eventually came to play a far different role from any that he might have imagined as a Platonic teacher living on one of his estates in the predominantly pagan Apamea of the late third and early fourth centuries. Even the title of his best-known work, the <em>De Mysteriis</em>, is not his own but that of the Renaissance “magus,” Marsilio Ficino, who attempted to revive Iamblichean Platonism in fifteenth-century Florence.14 The true title of the work, though less sensational, more accurately describes its contents: “The Reply of the Master Abammon to the ‘Letter of Porphyry to Anebo,’ and the solutions to the difficulties that it contains.”15 In effect, this treatise, which today has 13.

<p>become notorious as an apology for the practice of magic and divination, formed part of the correspondence between two of the most learned Platonists of the later third century. Porphyry, who directed a Platonic school in Rome, posed the questions and was therefore responsible for the structure of the work. Yet it was Iamblichus’s answers that changed the course of Platonism; in his lengthy replies to Porphyry’s questions Iamblichus solved problems that had long vexed Platonists, and he provided a philosophically viable framework for a religious way of life that Porphyry himself had longed to create.</p>
<p>Yet why would Iamblichus adopt the pseudonym of an Egyptian priest in order to explain his Platonic mystagogy? According to the later Platonists the answer was clear.16 Plato himself had acknowledged that his writings were merely a <em>propaideia</em> to deeper mysteries,17 and in several dialogues he spoke of the influence of “Oriental,”</p>
<p>particularly “Egyptian,” wisdom on his thought.18 Although Plato probably never participated in Egyptian or Chaldean mysteries, he was believed to have done so by Platonists,19 and therefore the Oriental element in Iamblichus’s Platonism should not be seen as alien but as an attempt to reveal more completely the wellspring of *Le * 15.</p>

<p>In his <em>Théologie platonicienne</em> ( <em>Th.Pl</em>.), vol. 1 (Saffrey-Westerink, 1968), Proclus says that Plato received his philosophy from the gods (5, 1–6), and that in writing the dialogues he functioned as a mystagogue: “the primary leader and hierophant of those true mysteries into which souls separated from terrestrial places are initiated” (6, 2–7). It was a commonplace among Platonists that Plato received his mathematic and hieratic teachings from the Egyptians; see <em>Anonymous</em> <em>Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy</em> (4, 8–10), trans.

<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>Platonic wisdom.20 Just as Plato turned to his Lady of Prophecy, Diotima Mantinike,21 to reveal erotic mysteries, so Iamblichus deferred to his persona, the Egyptian priest Abammon, to explain theurgic mysteries, the <em>hieratike techne</em>. In the role of Egyptian mystagogue responding to the questions and criticisms of Porphyry the</p>
<p>“philosopher,” Iamblichus played “divine revealer” to the wayward Hellene, guiding Porphyry back to the primitive intuitions that Plato and Pythagoras received from the Egyptians.22 Since Plato’s dialogues had already become a kind of scripture for fourth-century Platonists,23 the hieratic posture adopted by Iamblichus would not have seemed unorthodox.</p>
<p>To understand theurgical Platonism, however, one must first understand Iamblichus’s cosmology and soteriology. He believed that it was necessary for the soul to inhabit its proper “place” in the cosmos, so we must try to picture the place of the soul according to the later Platonists. For Iamblichus, Plato’s <em>Laws</em> provide the model of a community properly placed in the cosmos.</p>
<p>Plato says that in man’s Golden Age humanity was ruled by a divine hierarchy that ensured the well-being of all. The god Kronos established religious and political law, and society was governed by daimons. Plato says:</p>
<p><em>Kronos</em> gave our communities as their kings and rulers, not men but <em>Daimones</em>, beings of diviner and superior kind just as we still do the same with our flocks of sheep and herds of other domesti-cated animals. We do not set oxen to manage oxen, or goats to manage goats; we, their betters in kind, act as masters ourselves.</p>
<p>So, the god, in his kindness to man, did the same; he set over us the superior race of <em>Daimones</em>. ( <em>Laws</em> 713cd; trans. A.E. Taylor) 20. Ibid., 155–57.</p>

<p>Guided by these daimons, man enjoyed peace, prosperity, and justice until he usurped their authority, began to rule himself, and ignored the hierarchical law that each species must obey its superior order ( <em>Laws</em> 716ab). In accord with this principle, Plato believed that humanity should seek to re-establish the order and hierarchy of the Golden Age ( <em>Republic</em> 500c).</p>
<p>This myth reveals Plato’s model for cosmic and social order. It describes a taxonomy in which the gods stand as the principle and basis for human society.24 Acting as intermediaries between the gods and man, daimons revealed the rhythms of the year through which human society contacted the gods in ritual and sacrifice and thus became properly “placed” within the unity of the cosmos. As Plato observes, for a city to be kept alive “its sacrifices and feasts must fit the true natural order” ( <em>Laws</em> 809d), and this co-ordination of human acts to the cosmos “increases the intelligence of men”</p>
<p>( <em>Laws</em> 809e). Thus, Plato’s <em>homoiosis theo</em>, recognized as the goal of <em>paideia</em>, was measured by the soul’s <em>homoiosis kosmo</em>; to be assimilated to the gods one had to enter into communion with the daimons who revealed them in the natural world.</p>
<p>Plato’s taxonomy of the cosmos and society exemplifies what Jonathan Z. Smith has termed a “locative” view of existence.25</p>
<p>Quoting Cornelius Loew’s outline of this worldview Smith describes the locative orientation as centered in five basic propositions: “(1) there is a cosmic order that permeates every level of reality; (2) this cosmic order is the divine society of the gods; (3) the structure and dynamics of this society can be discerned in the movements and patterned juxtapositions of the heavenly bodies; (4) human society should be a microcosm of the divine society; and (5) the chief responsibility of priests and kings is to attune human order to the divine world.”26 In a locative orientation, evil and the ppp</p>

<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>“demonic”27 arise only when something is “out of place”; in Plato’s taxonomy, the demonic was relegated to the province of the inverted soul,28 turned “upside-down” ( <em>anatrope</em>) and alienated from the Whole.</p>
<p>Platonic <em>paideia</em> was supposed to reorient the soul to the cosmic (locative) order and exorcise it of its self-assertion. The “demonic,”</p>
<p>in the Platonic view, was a symptom of the soul’s confusion, the cosmic order gone haywire.29 Since Platonic taxonomy was locative as well as monistic, the demonic element was only relatively evil, an unbalanced expression of divine elements. Therefore the power of evil was temporary and limited to the province of the upside-down soul.</p>
<p>The pervasive acosmic mood of late antiquity effected a change in this locative orientation, and its influence was felt even in Platonic circles where it reversed the traditional locative taxonomy. In the late imperial period, man’s “cosmological conviction” was shattered.30 The all-pervasive and beneficent order of a cosmos articulated in its most sophisticated form by Plato—and less subtly by others—was transformed into a maleficent system of repression and punishment meted out by cruel demons.31 As Smith puts it: 27. The term “demonic,” as employed here and by Smith in his taxonomy, represents chaos, disorder, and evil; in short, that which threatens the cosmos. It should not be confused with the daimons of traditional Platonism. The Platonic <em>daimon</em> was a cosmogonic entity and certainly not evil, although the question surrounding its cosmogonic function did lead, eventually, to dualist interpretations that transformed the Platonic <em>daimon</em> into a demon.</p>

Smith’s use of the term “demonic” as discussed in his article: “Towards Interpreting Demonic Powers in Hellenistic and Roman Antiquity,” <em>ANRW</em> 2, 16.1, see esp. 429–30. While I find Smith’s terminology and analysis useful, I disagree with his description of the theurgist’s worldview as “utopian” (438). The “utopian” view described in his essay seems less a worldview than a view of the self and should not be equated with the utopian worldview as described in Smith’s articles: “Birth Up Side Down or Right Side Up?” in <em>Map Is Not Territory</em>, or “The Temple and the Magician.”</p>

<p>Hellenistic man suffers from what might be called cosmic paranoia. He experiences himself to be naked and helpless; he sees danger and threat everywhere. Looking up at the heavens, at the stars, and the motions of the heavenly bodies, he no longer sees guarantors of order; the guardians of a good cosmic and human destiny . . . but rather a grim system of aggressors, an openly hos-tile army which seeks to chain him. ( <em>Map Is Not Territory</em>, 138) In such a world, Smith says, man’s salvation is no longer measured by the degree of his assimilation to the patterns of the cosmos “but rather by the degree to which he can escape the patterns” (139).</p>
<p>Smith aptly terms this inverted locative orientation “utopian,”</p>
<p>meaning that there is no place in the cosmos that is good.32</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s position developed in the context of this cosmic pessimism: he was the inheritor of a Plotinian Platonism where the soul never descended into a body; it remained in the heavens, above the flesh and the physical world. Plotinus’s (c. 205–270 c.e.) view of the soul, which may have been influenced by Gnostic dualists, was unorthodox from a Platonic perspective. Plotinus admitted as much ( <em>Enn</em>. IV, 8, 8, 1–4), yet his psychology had a profound influence on the Platonism of his time.</p>
<p>With respect to Smith’s locative and utopian categories, the Gnostics and Plotinus were in the same camp and represent two possibilities within the utopian orientation: the Gnostics, by identifying the cosmos as evil and the soul as a fallen spirit; and Plotinus, by denying the soul’s descent and identifying sensible matter as evil and the cause of the soul’s confusion. They seemed to concur that traditional Platonic taxonomy was no longer valid, for both project the demonic <em>outside</em> the soul. For Gnostics the soul was pure but polluted by material demons; for Plotinus the soul never descends at all. And with the effects of <em>anatrope</em> denied, or presumed to inhibit only a nonessential aspect of the soul, Plotinus, as much as the Gnostics, rejected the locative taxonomy of his inherited tradition.</p>
<p>By placing the demonic outside the soul, in the demon enchantress 32. Smith pursues this theme with examples drawn from Gnostic and gnosticizing literature that demonstrate a reversed evaluation of the structures of the cosmos. See also <em>Map Is Not Territory</em>, 172–89.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>Nature ( <em>Enn</em>. IV, 4, 43, 23–26) and by denying the soul’s descent from the noetic realm, Plotinus reversed Platonic taxonomy.</p>
<p>Whereas traditional Platonic <em>paideia</em> had traced an ascent to the gods through a deepening assimilation to cosmic orders, Plotinus’s utopian orientation tended to devalue the cosmos as a divine revelation; this, in turn, denied the value of religious rituals tied to the rhythms of the sensible world.</p>
<p>A.C. Lloyd has argued that Iamblichus’s metaphysics of the completely descended soul served to justify his practice of theurgic rituals, and conversely, that Plotinus’s rejection of ritual practices and Porphyry’s low evaluation of them reflected their view of the soul as undescended.33 Important as this may be to distinguish the metaphysics of Plotinian and Iamblichean Platonism, it does not sufficiently account for the pronounced significance that Iamblichus gave to this issue. Iamblichus’s doctrine of the completely descended soul may, in part, be explained as his intellectual justification for theurgy; but it was far more than that. Tied to this doctrine were issues central to the principles of the Platonic tradition. For Iamblichus, the doctrine of the undescended soul struck at the heart of Platonic <em>paideia</em> because it threatened to desacralize and demonize the cosmos. This consequence, clearly, was not foreseen by Plotinus, who would have opposed it. Indeed, Plotinus argued eloquently for the divinity of the cosmos against the Gnostics ( <em>Enn</em>. II, 9), but for Iamblichus such arguments were futile without the corollary doctrine of the soul’s descent. If, as Plotinus believed, the soul’s confusion does not derive from the soul, if the soul does not undergo a complete change in embodiment, and if it does not, in fact, truly become embodied, then the manifestation of the divine as <em>kosmos</em> would have little or no role in the soul’s <em>paideia</em>. In addition, with the demonic projected from the soul to the sensible cosmos, Plotinus gave to it a permanence it never held in traditional Platonism.</p>
<p>In effect, the doctrine of the undescended soul split the cosmos into 33. See A.C. Lloyd, “The Later Neoplatonists,” in <em>The Cambridge History of</em> <em>Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy</em>, ed. A.H. Armstrong (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 287–93; cf. R.T. Wallis, <em>Neoplatonism</em> (Duckworth: London, 1972), 118–20.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>two opposed worlds, and if the physical world was upside-down ( <em>anatrope</em>) and not the soul, then the performance of sacrifices and rituals to assimilate oneself to its orders would be worse than useless; they would be positively harmful.34</p>
<p>The doctrine of an undescended soul also had significant social consequences. If the traditional agricultural and civic religious festi-vals were tied to nature’s powers, to take part in them would commit oneself to the demonic order. The philosopher of the Plotinian school, therefore, should refuse to acknowledge demonic gods or participate in civic religious rites and all corresponding social customs. To paraphrase the words of Plotinus, it is for the gods of the cosmos to come to the philosopher, not for him to go to them.35</p>
<p>While traditional Platonism had long recognized hierarchical distinctions in one’s ascent to the gods, it never opposed one stage of <em>paideia</em> to the next in the manner described above. From the soul’s prenatal “lessons” given through the mother’s rhythmic chants and movements ( <em>Laws</em> 790d), to the increase of intelligence from daily rituals ( <em>Laws</em> 809d) and the rigorous program of training in gym-nastics, music, mathematics and dialectic ( <em>Republic</em> 535a–541b), <em>paideia</em> was conceived by Plato as a hierarchical unfolding of the powers of the soul through a corresponding enfolding of the soul into the harmonies and powers of the cosmos. Higher degrees of <em>paideia</em> included lower degrees, just as primary orders of the cosmos contained subordinate orders. With the desacralization of the cosmos, however, this paradigm was lost, and despite Plotinus’s profound testament to the divinity of the world in <em>Against the Gnostics</em> ( <em>Enn</em>.</p>
<p>II, 9), his doctrine of the undescended soul, in principle, has already severed the body from its head. A complete separation was inevitable, ontologically separating the sensible cosmos from the noetic, and politically pitting the philosopher against the common man.</p>

Harris (Norfolk, Va.: International Society for Neoplatonic Studies, 1976), 187–97. Indeed, Armstrong suggests that Iamblichus’s use of the term <em>huperphues</em> in the <em>De Mysteriis</em> led to a “two world” way of thinking.

<p>14</p>
<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>Plotinus’s position was reflected in the writings of his disciple, Porphyry, the historical and ideological mediator between Plotinus and Iamblichus.36 In his treatise <em>On the Abstinence of Animal Food</em>,37</p>
<p>Porphyry attacked the practice of animal sacrifice and said such rites did not pertain to gods but to evil daimons: “For he who is studious of piety knows very well that no animated being is to be sacrificed to the Gods; but a sacrifice of this kind pertains to <em>Daimones</em> and to other Powers” ( <em>De Abst</em>. II, 36, 5). In an explanation that was sure to delight Christians, Porphyry attributed the origin of these rites to the devices of bloodthirsty daimons whose life depended on ingesting the vapors of blood sacrifice (II, 42, 1). He continued:</p>
<p>“Falsehood is allied to these malevolent beings, for they want to be considered as Gods, and the power which presides over them is ambitious to appear as the greatest God. These are they who rejoice in libations and the savour of sacrifices” (II, 42, 2; trans. T. Taylor).</p>
<p>The philosopher should stand aloof from this superstitious cult and become godlike by dissociating himself from daimons and their misguided worshipers (II, 43, 3–4). Employing the formula of his master Plotinus, Porphyry advised the philosopher to forgo all ritual activities in order to return “alone, through himself, to God alone” (II, 49, 1); while the philosopher should understand the enchantments of nature and the cults tied to its daimons, he should have nothing to do with them. “In every respect,” Porphyry says,</p>
<p>“*the philosopher is the savior of himself *” (II, 49, 2).</p>
<p>I would argue that Porphyry’s repudiation of the value of cult sacrifice and his belief that man can save himself depend entirely on his accepting the doctrine of the undescended soul and its corollary that the human self is identical to the divine <em>Nous</em>. On this latter point Porphyry maintained flatly that “the true self is the <em>Nous</em>” (I, 36. See Garth Fowden’s essay describing the “shift” in the Platonic tradition from the Plotinian/contemplative to the Iamblichean/theurgical mode, “Late Antique Paganism Reasoned and Revealed,” *Journal of Roman Studies * 71 (1981): 178–82.</p>

<p>29, 4). This new metaphysics undercut the traditional basis of <em>paideia</em>, for it transformed the Platonic <em>homoiosis theo</em>, measured by the soul’s assimilation to the cosmic gods, into a <em>homoiosis heauto</em> with the “self ” understood as the divine <em>Nous</em>! The soul’s identification with the cosmos, therefore, was no longer necessary or desirable, for the cosmos had been altogether short-circuited: it was something to escape from, not assimilate oneself to. Consequently, Porphyry conceived of salvation as the soul’s permanent escape from the cosmos, “never again to find itself held and polluted by the contagion of the world.”38 In this, he abandoned the Platonic doctrine of rebirth,39 yet his unorthodoxy with respect to traditional Platonism was consistent with its “gnosticized” form where the cosmos, and not the soul, carried the burden of the demonic. Porphyry maintained that permanent escape was possible only for the philosopher, not for the common man, and this again exemplifies the social as well as ontological oppositions tied to the doctrine of the undescended soul. Those incapable of the philosophic escape, says Porphyry, performed theurgic rites to purify their irrational elements, but such souls were never free.40</p>
<p>Iamblichus had been led to the higher reaches of Platonism by Porphyry, and although Porphyry also introduced Iamblichus to theurgy it was Iamblichus who discovered its deeper significance.</p>
<p>For Porphyry, theurgy functioned as a mere <em>preparatio</em> for the philosophic life and was to be left on the periphery of its higher disciplines. Iamblichus, on the other hand, moved theurgy from periphery to center, not only in the life of the philosopher, but for anyone who worshiped the gods.</p>
<p>With theurgy Iamblichus hoped to recover Plato’s positive orientation to the cosmos. At issue was the divinity of the world, and for Iamblichus the most effective means to acknowledge this was through the performance of rites that conformed the soul to its 38. <em>De regressu animae</em> 40*, 15–16, in J. Bidez, <em>Vie de Porphyre</em> (Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1964).

<p>orders. At issue as well was the future of the Platonic philosopher in society. Porphyry’s metaphysics of an undescended soul and</p>
<p>“demonized” cosmos opposed the philosopher to the sensible world and the social order. For Porphyry, Platonism was limited to an intellectual elite. The theurgical Platonism of Iamblichus, by contrast, allowed for gradations of religious experience that corresponded to the different levels of the cosmos and society. In theurgy, Iamblichus provided a soteriology that theoretically could touch any soul, from the most material to the most spiritual, while preserving their communal affiliations. With a more consistent meta-physics41 Iamblichus succeeded in restructuring Plato’s teachings in a way that preserved the mystical elements of Plotinus’s soteriology without losing contact with the physical cosmos or society.</p>
<p>To return to Smith’s categories, Iamblichus’s theurgical Platonism was “locative” in a highly sophisticated way. In both traditional and theurgical Platonism the demonic was not an external evil on the fringe of the cosmos,42 for the cosmos was all-embracing and entirely good.43 Iamblichus, like Plato, placed the demonic within the embodied soul, the only chaos untamed by the Demiurge. Yet, in Iamblichus’s Platonism the purpose of this alienation was made clearer: while Plato’s Demiurge gave to each soul a spark of himself ( <em>Tim</em>. 41c), Iamblichus understood this to mean that each soul had the responsibility to perform its own demiurgy, that is to say, its own <em>theurgy</em>. The task for every soul was to partake in divine mimesis by creating a cosmos out of the initial chaos of its embodiment. Therefore, the “demonic” condition of the embodied soul was a <em>felix culpa</em> without which the soul could not participate in cosmogenesis, including its own creation and salvation.</p>
<p>Platonists of the second and third centuries c.e. had disowned this confusion of the soul. In direct contrast to the traditional taxonomy, Numenius had shifted the demonic from the soul to the 41. For a discussion of the greater consistency in Iamblichus’s metaphysics than in Plotinus’s, see J.M.P. Lowry, <em>The Logical Principles of Proclus’ STOICHEIOSIS</em></p>

<p>sensible world and both Plotinus and Porphyry followed him.</p>
<p>These twin doctrines of an upside-down world and an undescended soul were rejected by Iamblichus, who warned Porphyry that such teachings would destroy their entire way of life, saying: “This doctrine spells the ruin of all holy ritual and theurgic communion between gods and men since it places the presence of superior beings outside this earth. For it amounts to saying that the divine is at a distance from the earth and cannot mingle with men and that this lower region is a desert, without gods.”44</p>
<p>Like Plato, Iamblichus believed his age was threatened by the loss of the gods, and he yearned for the time when gods and men were joined concretely through ritual. With theurgical Platonism, Iamblichus tried to recapture this Golden Age, and although he succeeded only within Platonic circles, his Syrian school presents probably the best synthesis of philosophy and ritual in the late antique world. In the <em>De Mysteriis</em> Iamblichus explained in a coherent and systematic way the raison d’être of the rituals he performed and prescribed for others, and he attempted to prove the necessity for these rites through a careful reflection on the intellectual canons of his time: the corpus of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Pythagorean writings.</p>
<p>Since much of Iamblichus’s writing is fragmentary, I have had to make speculative interpretations concerning some aspects of theurgy. However, these have been made in accord with the extant literature, and if apparently contradictory or unintelligible material begins to “make sense” without doing violence to the extant literature then I believe the interpretive framework has been justified and may at least be considered a viable hypothesis for understanding Iamblichean theurgy. The ineffability of the “divine acts” means that although theurgy was the centerpiece of Iamblichus’s Neoplatonism, it remained undefined. I shall, however, reveal its significance through an examination of the issues that were directly relevant to theurgy and of crucial importance to Iamblichus and other fourth-century Platonists: the status of matter and the material world, the nature of the embodied soul, and the way to achieve 44. <em>DM</em> 28, 6–11.

<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>salvation. By examining theurgy in each of these contexts successively, I believe we may begin to understand its function and meaning without violating its essentially indefinable character.</p>
<p>Without the goodness of a material world connected to the gods, Iamblichus, as a Platonist, could not have encouraged rituals that invoke the powers of the physical cosmos. If matter was the cause of evil and human suffering—as many argued—a Platonic theurgy would have been inconceivable. Therefore, in Part I, I examine Iamblichus’s arguments against Platonic dualists who had demonized the material world. Using Neopythagorean theories, which he presented as the “old ways” of the Egyptians, Iamblichus argued that matter derived from a divine principle and that the physical cosmos was directly generated by the gods.</p>
<p>Once the material world has been exorcised of evil and is seen to be an expression of divine activity, we turn to the confusion of the human soul, perhaps the most vexing problem for Platonists. In Part II, I examine Iamblichus’s understanding of the soul and his rationale for the performance of theurgic rites. The defining issue for Iamblichus and other Platonists was whether or not a divine soul descended completely into a mortal body, and profoundly different soteriologies developed depending on one’s answer. Since Iamblichus believed the soul fully descended and was, paradoxically, both mortal and immortal, he had to create a soteriological practice that incorporated the soul’s physical actions into a divine pattern—the specific function of theurgic rites. Theurgy allowed the embodied soul to tap the divine power hidden in its mortality and to realize that its paradoxical nature, being both mortal and immortal, allowed it to participate directly in the creation and salvation of the cosmos.</p>
<p>After a careful study of Iamblichus’s psychology and theurgy’s role in the cure of souls, I turn to the actual performance of theurgic rites and the guidelines suggested by Iamblichus. In Part III, I examine the tripartite schema Iamblichus employed to co-ordinate the mortal activities of souls with their immortal archetypes. For Iamblichus, the cosmos itself was the paradigmatic theurgy: the act of the gods continually extending themselves into mortal expression. Without first appreciating Iamblichus’s conception of the 19</p>
<p>divinity of the material world as well as his views on the paradox of the embodied soul, the full significance of theurgy and the guidelines for its practice could not be properly understood. In short, theurgy was Iamblichus’s attempt to ensure the deification of souls through their assimilation to the orders of the cosmos—a traditional Platonic teaching.</p>
<p>It is with Iamblichean Platonism that my study of theurgy concludes. In Part IV, I argue that theurgy represented Iamblichus’s attempt to bring traditional pagan divinational practices in line with Platonic and Pythagorean teachings. Through discovering metaphysical principles in time-honored sacrifices and divinational rites, Iamblichus believed he was following the example of both Plato and Pythagoras. As the scion of Syrian priest-kings who were, themselves, oracular figures, Iamblichus was ideally suited to refashion the Platonic tradition to meet the cultural and intellectual needs of fourth-century pagans. Iamblichean Platonism, with its emphasis on theurgy, succeeded in incorporating pagan religious rites into the intellectual edifice of Platonism while, at the same time, infusing the Platonic school with the vitality of popular cultic practices. It was a synthesis that other Platonists—for a variety of reasons—had not accomplished, and I hope this study will shed light on the significance of Iamblichus’s achievement.</p>
