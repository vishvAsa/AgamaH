This book began as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of Birger Pearson of the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am grateful for his unfailing support of my work and the high standards of his scholarship. I owe thanks to other professors at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Richard Hecht introduced me to Iamblichus, asked the right questions, and infected me with his passion for the religions of Late Antiquity. Hal Drake was always generous with his time, and his pointed suggestions, encouragement, and humor were a great help. Ruth Majercik taught me a great deal about theurgy and led me, by example, into the study of later Platonism.

I owe many thanks to Peter Brown of Princeton University, whose interest in this manuscript has been a source of encouragement from the beginning. He read several versions of the work and offered strategies that brought clarity and coherence to the entire manuscript. This publication is due primarily to his generous advice.

Equal thanks are owed to John Dillon of Trinity College, Dublin, who also read several versions of the manuscript; he tightened my argument and corrected numerous errors, including my translations of Iamblichus’s Greek. Jay Bregman of the University of Maine, Orono, initially urged me to publish the manuscript and later read the final version, making several helpful suggestions. The time these scholars have given to this work will always be appreciated.

I am also grateful to two French scholars of Neoplatonism, H.D.

Saffrey and the late Jean Trouillard, who invited me into their homes to share their ideas, books, and conversation in the winter of 1982–83. Trouillard’s publications had previously allowed me to glimpse the beauty of Platonic theurgy, and the intelligence and kindness he conveyed personally confirmed for me the depth and wisdom of the tradition that he embodied. My thanks also to Erma i

Pounds of Tempe, Arizona, and Robert Johnson of Encinitas, California, who earlier helped me recognize such depth.

Two Faculty Summer Grants from Stonehill College aided my research and provided time for revisions of the manuscript, which Thomas Hallinan graciously photocopied on several occasions. The constant support of my colleagues in the Department of Religious Studies at Stonehill has also been a great help. The late Helen Nes-bitt was kind enough to give the first four chapters of the manuscript hours of careful reading, which produced clearer and more economic prose. Working with the editorial staff of Penn State Press has been a pleasure. Peter Potter has always been prompt, clear, and professional, and he made several suggestions that improved the manuscript. Betty Waterhouse did a meticulous job of copyediting, correcting numerous bibliographical errors, tightening my prose, and asking for needed clarifications. My thanks also to Cherene Holland and others at Penn State Press who have helped bring the manuscript to publication. An earlier version of this manuscript has the unique distinction of having been “bottled” by Cameron Shaw, an artist, whose *Untitled Table with Thesis on Theurgy * has been displayed in galleries in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles.

Finally, I thank my wife, Lisa, for her lighthearted patience and understanding through all phases of bringing this book to publication. She has read and listened to all the revisions and has made many suggestions to improve my writing, but, more importantly, she allows me to see a world detached from my academic interests.

My thanks as well to Ariel and Adrian, who reminded me to play.
