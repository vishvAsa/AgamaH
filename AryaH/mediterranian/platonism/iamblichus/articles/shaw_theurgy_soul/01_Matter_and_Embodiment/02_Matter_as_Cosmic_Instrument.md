*It would be far from true to*

*suggest that the material*

*principle is evil. *

Iamblichus’s description of the origin of matter in the *De Mysteriis* concludes his explanation of Egyptian and Hermetic theology. After asserting a primordial and ineffable god, Iamblichus describes the “first God and king” \( *DM* 261, 10\), “God and principle of God” \( *DM* 262, 4\), who derived self-begotten as a “monad from the one” \( *DM* 262, 4–5\); and it is from this god, the “father of essence” \( *DM* 262, 6\), and “principle of intelligibles” \( *DM* 262, 7–8\), that matter is created. He says: “God produced matter out of the scission of materiality from substantiality, which the Demiurge, receiving as a living substance, fashioned into simple and impassi-ble spheres and organized the last of this into generated and mortal bodies” \( *DM* 265, 6–10\). This is repeated almost verbatim in Iamblichus’s commentary on the *Timaeus* quoted by Proclus: “The divine Iamblichus relates that Hermes wishes materiality to be created out of substantiality; and it is likely that it is from this source that Plato derived such a doctrine of matter.”1

Iamblichus’s portrayal of matter here is clearly positive, and the reference to Hermes was meant to lend authority to his view. Iamblichus’s metaphysical position was monistic, as can be seen in his ppp

summary of the Egyptian hierarchy: “And thus, from on high to the lowest things, the Egyptian doctrine concerning principles \( *archai*\) begins from the One and proceeds into multiplicity, and the multitude in turn is governed by the One; and everywhere the indefinite nature is ruled by a certain defined measure and by the highest uniform cause of all things” \( *DM* 264, 14–265, 6\). Not only was matter divinely created; even its furthest sensible expression was dominated by the supreme principle.2

Iamblichus’s Hermetic position opposed Platonic dualists such as Numenius, who viewed matter as autonomous and evil, and Plutarch, who postulated an evil soul that preceded the World Soul.3

Iamblichus also disagreed with Plotinus’s portrayal of matter; although Plotinus said that intelligible matter was divine and essentially good \( *Enn*. II, 4, 5, 12–22\), he condemned sensible matter as the

“cause of all evils” and “evil in itself ” \( *Enn*. I, 8, 3, 38–40\). Plotinus left a breach between intelligible and sensible matter, with the latter carrying the pejorative imagery of his dualist predecessors.4 Iamblichus, on the other hand, asserted an unbroken continuity between divine and sensible matter. The implications of this argument will be treated later, but in sum, Clemens Bäumker has characterized the difference by pointing out that while the Plotinian cosmos was diminished in value in proportion to its degree of sensible expression, in the Iamblichean world sensible matter represented no sub-traction of intelligible power because it was derived directly from the ppp

*Matter as Cosmic Instrument*

highest intelligible being, the *aoristas duas*.5 Iamblichus, under the influence of Pythagorean arithmology, viewed all manifestation, sensible or intelligible, as reducible to numerical principles, and it is possible that many important differences between pre- and post-Iamblicheans were due more to the influence on Iamblichus of an

“immanentist” Pythagorean metaphysics than to his reputed “Oriental” predisposition to “alien ideas.”6

Festugière demonstrated that Iamblichus’s description of the origin of matter was a well-known Pythagorean teaching, as evidenced in the writings of the Neopythagorean Moderatus of Gades \(first century c.e.\). In Moderatus’s description of first principles, “quan-tity” \( *posotes*\) is derived from Unifying Reason \( *heniaios logos*\), after it has been separated from it and deprived of all “formal qualities,” and in Iamblichus’s system materiality is derived from the Paternal Monad when it is separated from substantiality \(i.e., all formal qualities\).7 The *posotes* of Moderatus and the *hule/hulotes* of Iamblichus were functionally the equivalents of the material principle in the *Timaeus*, which was able to receive the Forms without distortion because it lacked all “formal” qualities \( *Tim*. 49b\).

Vogel has discussed the difference between Plato’s “metaphysic of the transcendent” and the Pythagorean “metaphysic of immanent order”; see de Vogel, *Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism* \(Assen: Van Gorcum, 1966\), 197–200. In the hands of Pythagoreans such as Iamblichus the transcendence/immanence distinction of Plato and Pythagoras was fused into an ineffable principle at once transcendent and immanent. As regards Iamblichus’s supposed infection by alien \(Oriental\) ideas, see E.R. Dodds, “Iamblichus,” *Oxford Classical Dictionary*, 2d ed. \(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1970\), 538. Festugière, however, argues that Neopythagorean notions of a transcendent god and material dyad need not derive from Oriental sources: “On le voit donc, quelque route qu’on suivît, qu’on distinguat Monade et Dyade *aoristos* comme un couple antithétique, on qu’on les réunait en une même Monade *arsenothelus*, on révenait à la notion de l’ *hen* absolutement transcendant. Ces speculations, purement grecques, sont anterieures à Eudore. Et il n’est donc nul besoin de recourir à l’Orient pour éxpliquer la transcendance de Dieu.” *La. Rev*. 4:53.

again discussed the origin of the matter that was shaped by the Platonic Demiurge: “The God, *Demiurgos*, is not the creator of matter, but when he receives it, as eternal, he molds it into forms and organizes it according to numerical ratios.”8 Having already explained that form and matter in the cosmos are analogous to the monad and dyad in number \( *In* *Nic*. 78, 11–14\), Iamblichus maintained that just as numbers are derived from combinations of the monad and dyad, the manifest world is derived from a demiurgic activity that he called the “rhythmic weaving” of monadic and dyadic *archai*.9

Arithmogony, for Iamblichus, was the analogue of cosmogony, and both expressed the harmony of opposed principles.10 Thus Iamblichus: “If, as the Pythagoreans say, ‘there is a combination and unification of disagreeing parts and a harmony of things naturally at war,’ the essence of harmony necessarily holds rule.”11 Quoting another Pythagorean dictum, Iamblichus says: “There is nothing in existence in which opposition is not present.”12 These oppositions, held in measured grades of tension and proportion, made up the framework for physical manifestation.

Iamblichus maintained that the “wisest men” \(the Pythagoreans\) grasp all things according to number \( *In* *Nic*. 72, 6–9\), and following their example, he believed that all matter—from its intelligible ppp

“means” that developed out of the initial opposition of the “odd” and “even” \( *In. *

*Nic*. 72, 9–13\). “Ten,” for the Pythagoreans, was the glyph for the perfectly manifested cosmos; it culminated the arithmogonic progression symbolized in the tetractys. All manifest possibilities were contained in the decad-tetractys.

to sensible expression—simply manifested the dyadic principle.13

In his treatise *On General Mathematical Science*, Iamblichus gives an account of this principle and describes the place of evil in the cosmos:14

Now, of the mathematical numbers let the two first and highest principles be set forth: the One \(which one must not yet call

“being” on account of its being simple, the principle of beings and not yet that sort of being of which it is principle\), and the other is the principle of the Many which—of itself—is able to provide division. Because of this, as much as it is in our power to say, we compare it to a completely fluid and pliant matter.15

The *archai*, One and Many, were nonexistent in themselves, but in combination they gave rise to intelligible differentiation and being.

Evil arose as a subsidiary and was not identified with matter. Thus Iamblichus:

Let it be thus for us. In the elements from which numbers arise neither beauty nor the good yet exist, but out of the combination of the One and the causal matter of the Many, number subsists. In these first existences \[numbers\], being and beauty appear, and, in turn, from the elements of lines, geometrical existence appears in which being and beauty are similarly found and in which there is nothing ugly or evil. But, in the last of things, in the fourth and 13. For the dyad as source of matter in Neopythagorean thinking see Dominic J.

draws directly or indirectly from Speusippus, Iamblichus certainly stands behind it.

fifth levels, which are composed from the last elements, evil appears, not as a guiding principle, but from something falling out and not maintaining the natural order.16

Evil came to exist only accidentally, from a falling out and lack of control in the fourth and fifth grades of existence, not, as Tarrant translates: “from . . . failing to control nature’s ways,”17 as if nature were evil, for in the *Theology of Numbers*, attributed to Iamblichus,18 he says that *phusis* is good and the same as *pronoia*, that is, nature *is* providence and manifests the order of the gods.19

Although Iamblichus gives no explanation for the fourth and fifth levels, Merlan, Kramer, and Tarrant suggest that he was following a Speusippan design but they disagree on its ontological order.20 John Dillon argues that Iamblichus is either quoting Speusippus directly or paraphrasing him.21

Iamblichus flatly denied that the material principle of number was evil. In *On General Mathematical Science* he says: “It is not 16. *DCMS* 18, 1–13. Text: KaÁ to†to m‚n o«n o‹tvq Ôm¡n ®x™tv. tÅ d‚ stoixe¡a, ®j

*Matter as Cosmic Instrument*

appropriate to contend that this \[material principle\] is evil or ugly.22 . . . It would be far from true to suggest that the material principle is evil.”23 Iamblichus argues that if the One is praised on account of its independence \( *autarcheia*\) and being the cause of beauty in numbers, “would it not be senseless to say that the natural receptacle of such a thing is evil or ugly?”24 Just as the principles of the “same” and “different” were mixed together by “persuasive necessity” in the *Timaeus* \(35a\), so, Iamblichus said, the principles of unity and multiplicity were combined by “a persuasive necessity”

\( *tinos pithanes anagkes*; *DCMS* 15, 17\) and in both cases the resulting *harmonia* served as the framework for the manifest world.

The dualism that Iamblichus described in *On General Mathematical Science* held only at the level of mathematical numbers; the *Theology of Numbers* said that the dyad itself, the principle of multiplicity and matter, not only is derived from the One, but, in a certain sense, *is* the One: “According to one designation they \[the Pythagoreans\] call the monad ‘matter’ and ‘receptacle of all’ since it is the cause of the dyad and of all receiving ratios.”25 In short, prior to the two primary principles of the One and the Many \( *DCMS* 15, 6–14\) Iamblichus asserts a monad from which these principles derive and in which they remain essentially contained. This was consistent with what we know of Iamblichus’s metaphysics in the *De Mysteriis* where he described a paternal monad \(itself derived from a higher unity\) that gave rise to the division of materiality and substantiality \( *DM* 265, 6–10\). The consistency of Iamblichus’s metaphysics is borne out by Damascius, who said that Iamblichus asserted an “entirely ineffable” One \( *pantelos arrheton*\) prior to the simple unity \( *ho haplos hen*\) that preceded the limit \( *peras*\) and pppp

unlimited \( *apeiron*\) and whose mixing gave rise to the One-Being \( *to hen on*\).26

The dyad, Iamblichus said more specifically, served as a borderland \( *metaichmion*\) between the multiple *arithmoi*, represented by the triad, and the monad.27 This he demonstrated by the fact that while the monad is made greater by addition than by multiplication \(1 \+ 1 > 1 x 1\), and all other numbers become greater by multiplication than by addition \(3 x 3 > 3 \+ 3; 4 x 4 > 4 \+ 4, etc.\), the dyad alone remains equal by addition or multiplication \(2 \+ 2 = 2 x 2\) \( *TA* 10, 10–11, 1\). It was the “mother of numbers” and served as the matrix that transformed the monad into *arithmoi*.28

Though Iamblichus held a positive view of matter, as a Platonist, he needed to account for Plato’s description of matter as the discordant and chaotic mass ordered by the Demiurge.29 In his commentary on the *Timaeus* \(30a\), Iamblichus argued that this passage should not be taken literally so that chaos is understood to exist prior to an ordered cosmos. This, Iamblichus says, would be “impious, not only about the cosmos, but about the Demiurge himself, utterly abolishing either his supremely good will or else his creative power.”30 Rather, Iamblichus said that Plato described a cosmos 26. *Damascius: Dubitationes et Solutiones de Primis Principiis in Platonis Parmenidem* \( *Dub. et Sol*.\), 2 vols., ed. C.A. Ruelle \(1889; Brussels: Culture et Civilisation, 1964\), 103, 6–10. While my references to Damascius are taken from Ruelle’s edition, I have checked my citations with the improved text and translation of Damascius, *Traité des premiers principes*, 3 vols., text established by L.G. Westerink and translation by J. Combes \(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1986–91\). See also the diagram of Iamblichus’s metaphysical hierarchy based on this passage; J.

28. Iamblichus gave the dyad the epithets “Isis” based on the false etymology with *isos* “equal” \( *TA* 13, 12\) and “Rhea” because of the “flowing” \( *rhusis*\) of the material principle \(14, 7\). Though the dyad was needed to mediate the appearance of the intelligible *arithmoi*, in itself it was without “form” either *en dunamei*, as the monad \( *TA* 1, 9\), or *en energeia*, as all other numbers \(1, 10\).

*Matter as Cosmic Instrument*

*after* chaos in order to emphasize the dependence of the sensible world on: \(1\) the providence of the Demiurge, \(2\) the choreography of the *Nous*, and \(3\) the presence of the soul, without which the cosmos would fall into disarray.31 The separation of corporeality from its form-giving qualities was merely a necessity of discourse. Iamblichus explains: “although the cosmos is eternally in being the exigencies of discourse separate the creation from the creator and bring into existence in a time sequence things which are established simultaneously.”32

Thus, although in the *Timaeus* Plato describes creation as a sequence of events, the work of the Demiurge was simultaneous.

For Iamblichus this meant that the cosmogony did not take place in a chronological past but was always present *in illo tempore*, and was therefore always accessible by means of theurgic ritual. The chronology of the *Timaeus* simply portrayed ontological grades of being simultaneously present in the corporeal world. The separation of corporeality from its principles was an impossibility that could occur only in abstraction, not in actuality. In other words, at the

“moment” the Demiurge exists the entire corporeal world exists, and in every sense. There was no spatial or temporal separation between the Forms and their sensible expression.

Post-Iamblicheans no longer impugned matter as the cause of evil, and their solution to the problem was summed up by Jean Trouillard who said: “On exorcise la nuit en l’introduisant parmi les valeurs divines.”33 This followed Pythagorean thinking where the dyad became the mother of divine numbers. In any case, Iamblichus’s strong monism made no allowance for a principle of evil; it was merely an accident within the flux of nature.34 Yet, as Iamblichus noted, evil does appear in the composite lives of the last elements, in the fourth and fifth levels of existence, when something ppp

It was entirely parasitic on the Good. See *Proclus: Trois études sur la providence*, vol.

“falls out of the order of nature” \( *tina ekpiptein* . . . *tou kata phusin*; *DCMS* 18, 13\).

I follow Merlan and Tarrant in assigning the fourth and fifth levels to “bodies” and “unordered masses” respectively, for Iamblichus emphasized that the soul was not a composite.35 In the *De Mysteriis* he says: “Whenever the soul comes into the body it does not suffer nor do the *logoi* which it gives to bodies, for the *logoi* are forms \( *eide*\), simple and uniform, allowing no disturbance to come in or out of themselves. The soul, moreover, is *the cause of the suffering* for the composite, and the cause is surely not identical with its effect” \( *DM* 35, 8–14\). This would seem to refute Kramer’s assigning souls and bodies to the fourth and fifth levels respectively, yet, according to Iamblichus, the soul maintains an intimate connection with the composite lives that it sustains. Despite the fact that the soul, *kath’ heauten*, is ungenerated and free of suffering, it nevertheless “inclines and is turned to the generated composites over which it has jurisdiction” \( *DM* 21, 6–7\), and to the degree that the soul’s attention falls into these lives it is subject to the suffering and evils that are their lot.36

35. *Suntithemi* is the key term in both the *DM* and *DCMS* to designate lives in the “last orders” in generated and composite existences. In the *DCMS* Iamblichus says evil appears *en tois tetartois kai pemptois tois suntithemenois* \(18, 10\), and in the *DM* Iamblichus says the soul is the generative cause of *gignomenon te kai* *phtheiromenon ton suntheton* \(35, 14–16\).
