In his introduction to Egyptian theology in the *De Mysteriis*, Iamblichus says: 

> “The Egyptians, imitating the nature of the universe and the creative energy of the Gods,  
> themselves produce images of mystical insights—hidden and invisible—by means of symbols,  
> just as nature symbolically reveals invisible measures through visible shapes  
> and the creative energy of the Gods outlines the truth of the Forms through visible images” \( *DM* 249, 14–250, 7\). 

Writing under the pseudonym of “Abammon,” an Egyptian priest, Iamblichus dedicated book VII of the *De Mysteriis* to the exegesis of the symbols and theology of Egyptian religion.

<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

In this passage Iambli-1. H.D. Saffrey says that Abammon was a theophoric name  
combining the Syriac word for father “ab\(ba\)” with the Egyptian god Amon who had been assimilated by the Greeks to Zeus;  
see his “Abamon, pseudonyme de Jamblique,” *Philomathes— Studies and Essays in the Humanities in Memory of Philip Merlan* \(The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1971\), 227–39. 

Thus, “Abammon” was a popularized transcription of the Greek *pater theou or theopator*,  
which Saffrey says was descriptive of the theurgist in the Iamblichean scheme of virtues.  
Iamblichus’s list differs from Porphyry’s in that his highest virtue was called “hieratic” or “theurgic” rather than “paradigmatic” as in Porphyry’s scheme. Porphyry’s list of the virtues is as follows: 

- *virtue* *activity* *agent*
- political, curbing of passions, virtuous man
- cathartic, cleansing of passions, daimonic man/ good daimon
- theoretic, intellectual activity free from passions, god
- paradigmatic, conjunction with the intellect, father of gods

\( *Sent*. 32; 30, 6–31, 8; ed. E. Lamberz \[Leipzig: Teubner, 1975\]\) 23


Iamblichus interpreted Porphyry's theoretic and paradigmatic virtues as degrees of "human" intelligence  
and distinguished them from the hieratikai (or theourgikai) aretai (cf. Damascius, In Phaed. paras. 138-44, in L.G. Westerink, ed. and trans., The Greek Commentaries on Plato's Phaedo, 84-87; (New York: North-Holland, 1977).  
For lamblichus, the theurgic virtues were "father, in the soul, of all in it which exists from god" (Saffrey, "Abamon," 238),  
not intellectual virtues as listed by Porphyry.  
Thus, the term theopator, which Porphyry gave to the one who practiced "paradigmatic" virtues,  
was transferred by lamblichus to the theurgist.  
By using the pseudonym Abammon (father of gods)  
Iamblichus avoids the indiscretion of refuting his teacher directly;  
at the same time,  
he plays on Porphyry's scheme of the virtues,  
adopting a name as an apologist for theurgy,  
which describes the highest degree of virtue in Porphyry's own system.

Iamblichus referred to the theme of divine mimesis, which is of central importance in his apology for theurgy.

Reverence for Egyptian wisdom was already well established in the Platonic tradition in the fourth century c.e., but Iamblichus’s[^2]Syrian school exhibited an unmatched admiration for their rites and theology.  
Iamblichus explained that he revered Egyptian theology  
because it possessed real power,  
“imitating the nature of the universe and the creative energy of the Gods.” 

In Platonic terms this meant taking an active part in the demiurgy of the cosmos  
and becoming a co-creator with the god of creation.  
The power and authority of Egyptian rites  
derived from this co-operative mimesis:  
according to Iamblichus,  
they embodied the eternal ratios \( *metra aidia*; *DM* 65, 6\)  
which were the guiding powers of the cosmos.

The Egyptians praised by Iamblichus worshiped the true gods of Platonism:  
the unchanging patterns of nature;  
they were a community perfectly integrated with the natural world,  
reproducing in cult and ritual the activity of the Demiurge in the cosmos.[^3]  
For Iamblichus, Egyptian mysteries represented the highest possible appropriation of the divine in mortal life,  
and he looked to their rites as a model for the religious rituals he introduced to the Platonic tradition  
under the name of *theourgia*, a term borrowed from second-century Chaldean Platonists.[^4]

Theurgical Platonism represents Iamblichus’s attempt to introduce the divine mimesis of Egyptian cult to the Platonic community and the Hellenic world.  
It was a contribution that Iamblichus believed was sorely needed by Hellenes  
because of their obsession with discursive novelties that lacked power  
and a vital connection to the cosmos \( *DM* 259, 9–14\).  
Like the Egyptian cult, theurgy imitated the gods,  
and Iamblichus said that every theurgic observance was a ritualized cosmogony \( *DM* 65, 4\)  
that endowed embodied souls—regardless of their station in life—  
with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos.  
From a theurgic perspective, embodiment itself became a divine service,  
a way of manifesting the will and beauty of the gods.[^5]

Iamblichus’s position irrevocably changed the attitude of Platonists toward embodiment and the physical world,  
yet the basis for this change and the central role of theurgy in later Neoplatonism have largely been ignored.  
If theurgy is understood as co-operative demiurgy,  
then the attitude of a theurgist toward the physical world would be of decided importance.  
By sharing in the activity of creation  
the theurgist would participate in the ordering of matter,  
which was the specific function of the Demiurge as described in Plato’s *Timaeus*. +++(5)+++ 

[^4]: Though Porphyry was the first Platonist to adopt theurgical practices, it was Iamblichus who elevated its importance. For a discussion of the origin of the term, see Hans Lewy, *Chaldean Oracles and Theurg* y, ed. M. Tardieu \(Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1978\), 461–66.

[^5]: *DM* 272, 10–12. Cf. Iamblichus’s discussion of the school of Calvenus Taurus in the *De Anima* \( *Stob*. I, 378, 25–379, 6\).

One’s attitude to the body and matter, then, would be an index of the degree and manner of one’s participation in the Demiurge;  
more specifically, Iamblichus held that the worship of embodied souls  
was determined precisely by their degree of material involvement \( *DM* 219–228, 13\).+++(5)+++

The theurgist’s highest good was not realized by escaping from materiality  
but by embracing matter and multiplicity in a demiurgic way.  
In this, Iamblichus virtually reversed the symbolic language of his age:  
apotheosis in theurgy could no longer be imagined as the ascent of the soul \(the well-known Plotinian metaphor\),  
without a corresponding descent and demiurgy.  
The pivot on which the metaphor turned was Iamblichus’s understanding of the soul’s relation to matter,  
and his solution to this question is critical for understanding the central role he gives to theurgy.  
Indeed, in the view of Iamblichus and other hieratic Neoplatonists, embodied souls were able to attain salvation *only* through the theurgic use of matter.+++(4)+++

That the soul’s ritual use of matter  
could itself bring about the salvation of the soul  
was certainly a new development in the Platonic tradition,  
yet despite its apparent unorthodoxy,  
there are elements in the dialogues that lend it support—  
most obviously the doctrine of *anamnesis*, the core of Plato’s epistemology \( *Phaedo* 75e; *Meno* 81cd\).  
In the doctrine of recollection,  
the soul’s education is described as a process of reawakening  
by means of contacts with the sensible world  
that functioned as mnemonic prods,  
reminding the soul of the Platonic Forms.  
Theurgy should be seen as the development and translation of this epistemological theory into a ritual praxis  
where the prods of sensate experience were carefully controlled in rites  
designed to awaken the soul to the Forms.[^6]

[^6]: For an illuminating discussion of ritualized recollection among neoplatoniz-ing Muslims, see Henry Corbin, *Avicenna and the Visionary Recital*, tr. W. Trask \(Dallas: Spring Publications, 1980\), 115–16. Pierre Hadot says that the notion of innate or pre-intellectual knowledge of the Forms had assumed a “mystical value” for Iamblichus since, for him, each soul has “innate knowledge of the gods” \( *DM* 7, 14\); *Porphyre et Victorinus *\(Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1968\), 1:117 n. 6.

While the doctrine of recollection lent itself specifically to a theurgic development,  
the cosmology of the *Timaeus* provided the necessary framework:  
without the descent of souls into mortal bodies and the physical appearance of Forms,  
Plato says the work of the [[26]] Demiurge would remain incomplete.  
The embodiment of the soul and its perfection in theurgy  
was seen by Iamblichus as essential to cosmogenesis.

Although there is evidence in Plato’s dialogues  
that seems to contradict Iamblichus’s positive view of matter and embodiment,  
this conflict is in the dialogues themselves  
and was the inheritance of any Platonist who attempted to resolve the problem of embodiment.  
Plotinus, for example, in his discussion of embodiment,  
said that the *Timaeus* supported an optimistic view of the soul’s descent,  
while the *Phaedo* and *Phaedrus* presented the soul’s descent in a far more negative light,  
one that Plotinus himself emphasized.  
As Plotinus put it: 

> “\[Plato\] . . . does not always speak consistently, so that his meaning might be grasped easily” \( *Enn*. IV, 8, 2, 27–28\), 

and Platonists quoted the dialogues to support positive and negative views of matter and embodiment.  
However, due to the canonical authority of the dialogues in late antiquity  
and the demand by Platonists for consistency in the writings of their master,  
the ambiguities on this issue needed to be brought into accord.[^7]  

[^7]: For a discussion of the “canonization” of Plato’s dialogues, see Michael Dunn, “Iamblichus, Thrasyllus, and the Reading Order of the Platonic Dialogues,” in *The Significance of Neoplatonism* \(Norfolk, Va.: International Society for Neoplatonic Studies, 1976\), 59–80. See also *Anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy*, ed. L.G. Westerink \(Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1962\), xxxvi–xl; H.D. Saffrey, “Quelques Aspects de la spiritualité des philosophes néoplatoniciens: De Jamblique à Proclus et Damascius,” *Revue des Sciences Philosophiques et Théologiques* 68 \(1984\): 169–82.


E.R. Dodds explained that the task specifically was to reconcile the cosmology of the *Timaeus*  
with the psychology of the *Phaedo* and *Phaedrus*,  
and he noted that Plotinus had not been altogether successful in this  
as he leaned too much toward the psychological perspective,  
which presented matter negatively.[^8]

A.-J. Festugière catalogued the optimistic and pessimistic views of embodiment outlined in Iamblichus’s treatise *De Anima*,  
which shows the Syrian’s thorough familiarity with this issue.[^9]

In the context of this problem,  
theurgy may be seen to bridge the gap between the psychological matter of the *Phaedo* and *Phaedrus*,  
with their pessimistic view of embodiment, and the cosmological matter of the *Timaeus*,  
which presents embodiment optimistically.  
The theoretic structure of this bridge  
was outlined in Iamblichus’s metaphysical solution to the problem of how the One becomes Many.  
By postulating a middle term, or, as it turns out, middle *terms*,  
Iamblichus allowed for continuity between irreconcilable extremes,  
a principle of mediation that became an integral part of post-Iamblichean Platonism.[^10]

In the existential situation of embodied souls,  
Iamblichus’s introduction of theurgic rituals  
provided a mediation between man’s experience of matter as an oppressive weight,  
separating him from the divine,  
and his innate awareness of matter as the vehicle that joined him with the gods \( *DM* 7, 13–8, 2\).  
Theurgy was the dynamic expression of the mathematical mean,  
establishing a continuity between mortal and immortal realms  
by allowing embodied souls to enter divine energies through the performance of ritual.+++(4)+++

Iamblichus solved the Platonic problem of matter and embodiment as a “Pythagorean,”  
for he viewed all aspects of creation, however dense,  
as expressions of the primary and divine principles: *peras-apeiron*.  
Theurgic rites allowed the soul to enter these measures directly,  
ritually enacting divine principles  
whose power was shared by those who embodied them.

Iamblichus’s solution must also be seen  
in the context of the late third and fourth centuries  
and the increasing popularity of religions of radical dualism  
exemplified in Gnosticism, Manichaeanism, and, to some degree, Christianity.[^11]

The question of the value of life in a body  
and the status of the physical world had become highly charged issues  
on which often depended the salvation or damnation of one’s soul.[^12]  
In this light, it was not Iamblichus as Platonic scholar and mathematician  
that attracted the adulation of his successors.  
It was Iamblichus as savior, *theios* *Iamblichos*,  
who revealed mysteries that transformed the suffering and weight of material experience  
into a foundation for communion with the gods.[^13]  
The body-as-tomb \( *soma = sema*\), “riveted to the soul by sense experience” \( *Phaed*. 83d\),  
became the vehicle through which the soul found its proper limits,[^14]  
thereby “saving itself ”  
and “becoming liberated while still in a body” \( *DM* 41, 10\).  
Thus, matter and the soul’s use of matter  
played an indispensable role in theurgy  
as it did in cosmogony.  
The soul could no more realize its salvation without embracing matter  
than the Demiurge could create the cosmos without the formless receptacle that gave expression to the Forms \( *Tim*. 48e–49a\). The difference, however, is that while the soul’s embrace of matter was piecemeal, following the cycles of time, the act of the Demiurge on matter was simultaneous and complete, and it is precisely in this “difference”

that Iamblichean theurgy must be understood.

At this point we should bear in mind that Iamblichus’s term for

“matter” was coined by Aristotle who said that Plato’s material principle, which was called “space” \( *chora*\) \(Tim. 52b\), “receptacle”

\( *hupodoche*\), “mother” \( *meter*\), and “nurse” \( *tithene*\) \( *Tim*. 49b\), was equivalent to the term *hule*: “the receptive space \( *chora*\) of Plato’s *Timaeus* is the same as matter \( *hule*\)” \( *Physics* 209b, 11–13\).

*Hule*, originally meaning “wood” or “timber,” henceforth became the technical philosophical term used by Platonists to refer to 12. This theme is examined in the social and institutional life of late antiquity by Jonathan Z. Smith in three essays: “The Influence of Symbols on Social Change: A Place on Which to Stand,” “Birth Upside Down or Right Side Up?” and “The Temple and the Magician,” in *Map is Not Territory* \(Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1978\), 129–89.

13. The attestations for Iamblichus as *theios* are numerous. See Eduard Zeller, *Die Philosophie der Griechen* \(Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1963\), 3: part 2, 378–79 n.2.

14. *Cratylus* 400c. C.J. de Vogel has corrected misconceptions in our understanding of Plato’s view of the body as a tomb. She argues that, for Plato, the body was not simply the soul’s prison but provided the soul its limits, its enclosure \( *peri-bolos*\), “in order that it might be saved” \( *Crat*. 400c\); see de Vogel, “The *SOMA–*

*SEMA* Formula: Its Function in Plato and Plotinus Compared to Christian Writers,” in *Neoplatonism and Early Christian Thought*, 79–99 \(London: Variorum, 1981\).

29



“matter.” Like most Neoplatonists, Iamblichus believed Aristotle and Plato were essentially in agreement, and he translated many of Aristotle’s theories about the physical world to the intelligible.15

Aristotle’s influence on Iamblichus, however, remained terminolog-ical and to some degree structural, for his meanings were transformed entirely in Iamblichus’s theurgical Platonism.
