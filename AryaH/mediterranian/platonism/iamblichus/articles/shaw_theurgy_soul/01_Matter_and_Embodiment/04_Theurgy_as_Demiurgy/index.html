  <p>*… taking the shape of the Gods. *</p>
<p>In the <em>De Mysteriis</em> Iamblichus described the human soul as the <em>eschatos kosmos</em>, the last world and reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Recognize, if you will, the lowest of divine beings: the soul purified from the body”+++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>( <em>DM</em> 34, 8). Because the human soul was the lowest divinity it suffered with the mortal lives that it sustained.<br>
Identified with only “certain parts” of the cosmos, the soul lost its perspective of the “whole” and become absorbed into the flux of mortal life.</p>
<p>Since matter cannot be discussed, from an existential perspective,<br>
apart from the soul’s experience of it,<br>
one may assume that Iamblichus’s negative remarks about matter in the <em>De Mysteriis</em> describe,<br>
in fact, the soul’s experience of matter.</p>
<p>Though Iamblichus used the same term, <em>hule</em> (or its functional equivalents: <em>soma</em>, <em>phusis</em>, <em>genesis</em>),<br>
it was not the <em>hule</em> of the <em>Theology of Numbers</em><br>
or the <em>hule</em> produced from the paternal monad in the <em>De Mysteriis</em>.<br>
It is one thing to speak about matter philosophically or theologically—in an abstract or theoretical way—<br>
quite another to experience matter and to outline a practical discipline to free souls from its constraints.<br>
However, apart from telling Porphyry that he will answer questions philosophically, theologically, or theurgically as he deemed appropriate,<br>
Iamblichus did not explicitly signal the shifts in his discourse ( <em>DM</em> 7, 2–6).<br>
What was undoubtedly clear to himself and his readers is not always clear to us.<br>
Being accustomed to a more univocal use of terms,<br>
the modern reader of the <em>De Mysteriis</em> will likely miss these contextual shifts and find Iamblichus’s use of terms inconsistent and confusing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>+++(5)+++</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of Iamblichus’s pejorative descriptions of matter in the <em>De Mysteriis</em>,<br>
it was not viewed negatively, nor was embodiment per se.<br>
For later Neoplatonists, the body was understood as an integral part of a larger process. As Trouillard put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The body that the soul animates and through which it is placed in the cosmos<br>
is not an extrinsic addition but<br>
<em>the circuit that it travels</em> <em>in order to be united with itself</em>.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The body was connatural ( <em>sumphues</em>) with the soul, the soul with the intellect, and the intellect with god.+++(5)+++ The physical body was simply the “point of condensation” in a long process/ <em>prohodos</em> that followed the material function of creative dispersion.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Iamblichus was aware of the problems of embodiment and believed that theurgy was able to cure souls of somatic identification by guiding them into divinely sanctioned postures.+++(4)+++ He believed that the soul’s “fall” into a body followed a divine impulse, a cosmogonic law, and that this same impulse, leading souls into bodies through daimonic urges, could be rerouted and transformed by theurgic rites.+++(5)+++ Theurgy limited and redirected the soul’s daimonic attractions, transforming these intermediary beings into the soul’s receptacle of salvation.</p>
<p>In an excellent analysis of the role of matter in the Chaldean Oracles, Stanislas Breton says that the negativity of matter was compensated by the Chaldean view of an unbroken continuity that extended from the gods to matter. He says:</p>
<p>51</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matter and the body, consequently, are subject to a two-fold interpretation according to whether one descends or ascends the degrees of an ontological and divine hierarchy. . . . [The negative gravitation of the daimons] is equilibrated and compensated by an inverse pressure which makes of matter, in its “very fury,” a homeopathic remedy for the degradation that it provokes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the profound meaning of theurgy which, relying on the continuity and connaturality of which we have spoken, discovers and exploits the quasi-sacramental virtues of little things as useless as stones.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Even the densest aspects of matter, therefore, were potential medicines for a soul diseased by its body, and the cure for a somatic fixation in this theurgic homeopathy was the tail of the (daimonic) dog which bound it.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>According to the <em>Timaeus</em> (41d), each soul was constituted by the same ratios as the World Soul and so necessarily participated, to some degree, in the entire world.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>+++(5)+++ Consequently, there was nothing essentially perverse about material things or embodied experience.</p>
<p>Yet, as Iamblichus explained in his letter on fate, if the soul directed excessive attention to the body<br>
it became subject to the rules governing corporeal action.<br>
In theurgic terms this demanded that the soul be reconciled with the daimon<br>
who ruled the realm of nature governing this activity.<br>
Being tied to generated life,<br>
the soul was bound to laws administered by daimonic intermediaries,<br>
and until the soul achieved a proper relation with them it remained subject to the punishments of their administration.</p>
<p>How these theurgic rapprochements were conducted, remains unknown since there are no extant records of theurgic ceremonies.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Iamblichus did refer to material objects used in theurgic rites and accounted for the hidden power in such things as stones, plants, and animals. He says:</p>
<p>52</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it was necessary that earthly things not be deprived of participation in the divine,<br>
the earth received a certain divine portion capable of receiving the Gods.<br>
The theurgic art, therefore, recognizing this principle in general,<br>
and having discovered the proper receptacles, in particular,<br>
as being appropriate to each one of the Gods,<br>
often brings together stones, herbs, animals, aromatics, and other sacred, perfect, and deiform objects of a similar kind.<br>
Then, from all these it produces a perfect and pure receptacle. ( <em>DM</em> 233, 7–16; cf. <em>DM</em> 235, 6–12)</p></blockquote>
<p>Such objects served as receptacles of the gods because they preserved an intimate relation with them and bore their “signatures” ( <em>sunthemata</em>) in the manifest world.+++(5)+++ As such they were pure specimens of divine presence in matter,<br>
and for souls suffering a specific imbalance within the administration of a divine being,<br>
the objects that bore its symbol/ <em>sunthema</em> became homeopathic antidotes if handled in a ritually appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Iamblichus explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore, whether (it is) certain animals or plants or any of the other things on earth governed by Superior Beings,<br>
they simultaneously share in their inspective care and procure for us an indivisible communion with the Gods” ( <em>DM</em> 235, 5–9).</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the appropriate use of the gods’ <em>sunthemata</em> in nature<br>
the soul could awaken in itself the power of their corresponding symbols ( <em>DM</em> 136, 6–10).<br>
This realigned the soul with the manifesting energies of a deity and freed it from servitude to the daimons who watched over its physical expression ( <em>DM</em> 174, 9–10).</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s extant writings do not describe these theurgical practices in detail,
but it is unlikely that they could have been explained discursively, for Iamblichus said that theurgic knowledge was gained only through “practical experience” ( <em>DM</em> 229, 17–230, 1).+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Iamblichus’s theoretical justification for the use of material objects in theurgy may be summarized under three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The gods illuminate matter and are present immaterially in material things. ( <em>DM</em> 232, 14–16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There exists a filial and beneficent bond between the gods who preside over life and the lives which they produce. ( <em>DM</em> 235, 3–5) 53</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sacrificial order in theurgy was connected to the order of the gods. ( <em>DM</em> 217, 3–4)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Proclus includes more specific information in his treatise <em>On the Hieratic Art</em>, an introduction to theurgic taxonomy that identified <em>sunthemata</em> in nature with their ruling gods.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Proclus’s best-known example of a <em>sunthema</em> is the “heliotrope” that bears the signature of the sun god Helios.+++(5)+++ As Proclus puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>each thing prays according to the rank it occupies in nature, and sings the praise of the leader of the divine series to which it belongs . . . for the heliotrope moves to the extent that it is free to move, and in its rotation, if we could hear the sound of the air buffeted by its movement, we should be aware that it is a hymn to its king, such as it is within the power of a plant to sing.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Like the heliotrope, other things in nature bore the imprint of the sun god: cock ( <em>CMAG</em> IV, 150, 4), lotus ( <em>CMAG</em> IV, 149, 12), lion ( <em>CMAG</em> IV, 150, 3), and bel stone ( <em>CMAG</em> IV, 149, 22), each revealing different characteristics of the god hidden in its premanifest unity.</p>
<p>For example, while the bel stone demonstrated a solar affinity by its mimesis of the sun’s rays, the lotus and heliotrope imitated its diurnal revolution ( <em>CMAG</em> IV, 150, 26–30).+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Iamblichus explained that the power of the gods who “illuminated matter” was undiminished by their manifestations ( <em>DM</em> 140, 19–141, 4). The use of “base” objects in theurgical rites in no way degraded the god who was present in them. In fact, the use of inanimate objects in divination was all the more proof and guarantee that a god was responsible for the prognosis since the objects themselves could not have provided it. Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>54</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the power of the Gods extends in revealing itself as far as to inanimate things like pebbles, rods, pieces of wood, stones, corn or wheat, this very fact is the most striking aspect of the divine prognostic in divination,<br>
for it gives soul to soulless things and motion to things without the power of movement.<br>
It makes all things clear and known, participate in reason,<br>
and be defined by the measures of <em>noesis</em> although they possess no reason in themselves. ( <em>DM</em> 141, 14–142, 3)</p></blockquote>
<p>That things without intelligence should be vehicles of divine wisdom<br>
followed a principal tenet of theurgy that<br>
communion with the gods did not take place through man’s mental efforts or power ( <em>DM</em> 97, 1–9).<br>
Iamblichus continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just as God sometimes makes an innocent fool speak words of wisdom—<br>
by which it is clear to all<br>
that the speech is not human but divine—<br>
in this same way God reveals ideas ( <em>noemata</em>) that transcend all [human] knowledge through things deprived of knowledge” ( <em>DM</em> 142, 5–10).+++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>Iamblichus’s use of material objects in theurgy<br>
and his praise of their divine power was a correlate to his critique of human intellectual power.+++(5)+++<br>
Man’s incapacity to achieve union with the gods<br>
was made particularly evident in rites that employed insentient objects<br>
to achieve an experience that surpassed reason. The point, in short, was that theurgy is “divine action, not human” ( <em>DM</em> 142, 7),<br>
and the use of inanimate objects in theurgic divination clearly demonstrates this point.</p>
<p>The <em>sunthemata</em> embedded in nature<br>
were not limited to dense matter<br>
but were also present in certain incantations ( <em>DM</em> 133, 18), concoctions ( <em>DM</em> 133, 18), characters traced [on the earth] ( <em>DM</em> 129, 15–17), and in the ineffable names that were able to draw souls into the presence of the gods ( <em>DM</em> 157, 13–16).+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Iamblichus also mentions certain melodies and rhythms<br>
that gave the soul direct ( <em>euthus</em>; <em>DM</em> 119, 6) participation in the gods.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><br>
The <em>sunthemata</em>, in whatever expression, were divinizing, and for the same reason:<br>
they bore the impress of the god<br>
and were able to awaken souls to the divinity they symbolized.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>In theurgy, anything that received the god and mediated its presence<br>
functioned as a sacred receptacle<br>
whether it was a stone, a plant, a smell, or a song.</p>
<p>All functioned as <em>hule</em> with respect to the divine agent which they received and revealed.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Thus, even a “vision” that mediated the presence of a god was a kind of <em>hule</em>. Iamblichus explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One must be convinced by secret teachings that a certain matter is given by the Gods by means of blessed visions.<br>
This matter is somehow connatural ( <em>sumphues</em>) with those who give it.<br>
The sacrifice with this sort of matter stirs the Gods up into manifestation<br>
and immediately invokes their appearance,<br>
receives them when they come forth,<br>
and reveals them perfectly. ( <em>DM</em> 234, 7–14) +++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>Iamblichus compares this visionary matter to the “pure and divine matter” ( <em>hulen tina katharan kai theian</em>)<br>
that receives and reveals the gods in cosmogony ( <em>DM</em> 232, 17).<br>
As the soul became increasingly purified by theurgy so that it received such visions,<br>
its experience of matter became less like that of the <em>Phaedo</em><br>
and more like the cosmological matter of the <em>Timaeus</em>,<br>
transforming the entire world into an immense receptacle,<br>
a <em>sunthema</em> revealing the “will of the gods.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>+++(5)+++<br>
From a theurgic perspective, the cosmos was a temple whose sacrificial orders were designed by the Demiurge ( <em>DM</em> 65, 6–8).+++(5)+++</p>
<p>To be in a body, for a theurgist,<br>
was to have a place in this <em>temenos</em>+++(=sacred space)+++,<br>
and even union with the gods was not impossible for those whose embodiment was properly consecrated.+++(5)+++<br>
Iamblichus says:</p>
<p>[[56]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By means of this [divine] will,<br>
the Gods, being benevolent and gracious,<br>
shine their light generously on theurgists,<br>
calling their souls up to themselves and giving them unification ( <em>henosis</em>),<br>
accustoming them—while they are yet in bodies—<br>
to be detached from their bodies and turned to their eternal and noetic principle” ( <em>DM</em> 41, 4– 11).</p></blockquote>
<p>To be <em>in</em> the body in a divine manner<br>
was to be <em>out of the body</em> (i.e., free of its material constraints),<br>
and Iamblichus maintained that this paradox was integral to every theurgic experience.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of theurgy has a two-fold character.<br>
One is that it is a rite conducted by men<br>
which preserves our natural order in the universe;<br>
the other is that it is empowered by divine symbols ( <em>sunthemata</em>),<br>
is raised up through them to be joined on high with the Gods,<br>
and is led harmoniously round to their order.<br>
This latter aspect can rightly be called “taking the shape of the Gods.” ( <em>DM</em> 184, 1–8) +++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>The theurgist was simultaneously man and god;<br>
he became an icon and <em>sunthema</em><br>
in precisely the same way as the other pure receptacles described by Iamblichus.</p>
<p>By means of appropriate rites<br>
the theurgist directed the powers of his particular soul ( <em>mikros kosmos</em>) into alignment with the powers of the World Soul (cf. <em>DM</em> 292, 5–9),<br>
which gave him direct participation in the “whole.”+++(5)+++<br>
He became a <em>theios</em> <em>aner</em>, universal and divine<br>
yet particular and mortal ( <em>DM</em> 235, 13–14); in somatic terms<br>
this was the result of having filled the measures of his immortal <em>augoeides</em> <em>soma</em>,<br>
the soul’s “star body,” which was visualized as a sphere.</p>
<h2 id="ochema">Ochema</h2>
<p>The doctrine of the “soul vehicle” ( <em>ochema</em>) in the Platonic tradition<br>
is essential for understanding the manner in which the later Platonists visualized immortality.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Referred to by Iamblichus as a vehicle ( <em>ochema</em>) ( <em>DM</em> 132, 12), or breath ( <em>pneuma</em>) ( <em>DM</em> 125, 6),<br>
the perfection of this aetheric and luminous body effected the soul’s immortalization.<br>
Through the purifying light given by the gods in theurgy<br>
the embodied soul was freed of its particularity<br>
and established in its starry vehicle, the <em>augoeides ochema</em> ( <em>DM</em> 312, 9–18).+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Like the spherical bodies of the universe and stars,<br>
for whom embodiment was simply adornment and revelation,<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><br>
the spherical body gained in theurgic rituals<br>
established the soul as immortal<br>
yet still allowed for the multitude of activities engaged in by a mortal and embodied soul.</p>
<p>Iamblichus often repeats the Neoplatonic principle that “like approaches like,”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><br>
and in the case of a particular embodied soul<br>
the only way to reach the universality of the World and celestial souls<br>
was to become like them, that is, spherical.+++(5)+++<br>
Thus, Iamblichus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wherefore, also our vehicle ( <em>ochema</em>) is made spherical<br>
and is moved circularly whenever the soul is especially assimilated to <em>Nous</em>.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>106</p>
<p>Apart from the historical sources for this teaching,<br>
discussed in large part by Kissling,<br>
the question remains of how to understand it.<br>
Blumenthal suggests that the psychic vehicle/faculty (i.e., imagination) was used by Plotinus<br>
“to protect the higher soul from influence from below” (“Some Problems,” 83),<br>
to keep the higher principles from being stained by the lower.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>While this may be the case for Plotinus, it was not so for the later Neoplatonists.<br>
In “Réflexions sur <em>l’OCHEMA</em>,” Trouillard argues that for Proclus<br>
the <em>ochema</em>, while separating distinct levels of the soul in the cosmos,<br>
at the same time joins them, preserving a continuity through all levels.<br>
In terms of salvation,<br>
the vehicle of the soul and its “imaginal body” became the “place” where the soul forgot or remembered its immortality.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>It was within his luminous and spherical vehicle<br>
that the theurgist received visions<br>
and was unified with the gods,<br>
yet this unification did not deny the multiplicity of his mortal life,<br>
for the sphere, Iamblichus says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“is capable of containing multiplicity ( <em>to</em> <em>plethos</em>), which indeed makes it truly divine, that not departing from its oneness it governs all the multitude.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The theurgist became spherical. He “took on a divine appearance” ( <em>DM</em> 184, 8) but remained a man. His apotheosis demanded not only that he activate his aetheric and immortal body but also that he remain bound to his mortal life.</p>
<h2 id="divinization">Divinization</h2>
<p>To the degree that a theurgist was divinized and assimilated to the Demiurge ( <em>DM</em> 292, 14–17)<br>
he necessarily shared the benign interest of the Demiurge in generated life, including his own.<br>
Any aversion he may have felt toward his mortal existence was therefore overcome by his experience of the “whole,”<br>
and his physical body became the nexus<br>
through which he expressed this divine benevolence.+++(5)+++<br>
In his person, he preserved a continuity between the “whole” and its “parts,”<br>
between the gods and man.</p>
<p>Iamblichus outlines this process in his description of catharsis in the <em>De Anima</em>.<br>
The cleansing of the soul’s particular fixations<br>
by purgation and withdrawal from the body<br>
was merely a preliminary stage,<br>
to be followed by a positive reinvestment in particulars. Iamblichus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, of catharsis, one must conceive its most useful aspects to be:<br>
[1] withdrawal from alien things;<br>
[2] restoration of one’s own essence;<br>
[3] perfection;<br>
[4] fullness;<br>
[5] independence;<br>
[6] ascent to the creative cause;<br>
[7] conjunction of parts with wholes; and [8] contribution from the wholes to the parts of power, life, activity, and similar things. ( <em>Stob</em>. I, 455, 25–456, 4)</p></blockquote>
<p>59</p>
<p>Of the eight attributes,<br>
only the first is negative,<br>
and Iamblichus specifically faults the view of those who defined catharsis+++(=purification)+++<br>
as a withdrawal from matter.+++(5)+++<br>
He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some give greater value to separation from the body,<br>
freedom from [material] bonds,<br>
liberation from mortality,<br>
release from generation and similar <em>lesser goals</em> of catharsis” ( <em>Stob</em>. I, 456, 6–8).</p></blockquote>
<p>The greater goals that followed were theurgic:</p>
<ul>
<li>the unification with the creative cause,</li>
<li>the demiurgic activity of joining parts of wholes,</li>
<li>and the subsequent reinvestment of parts with the vitality of their universal sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mistake of an embodied soul was not in having a body,<br>
nor in being fully aware of physical existence.<br>
The error lay in the weighing of the soul’s attention.<br>
Its consciousness was to be anchored in the whole,<br>
the harmonic unity of the Demiurge,<br>
with only minimal attention given to one’s localized self.+++(5)+++<br>
The experience of the theurgist would still include suffering and evils,<br>
but these would be incorporated into the whole.+++(5)+++<br>
Iamblichus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore, due to corporeal necessities,<br>
certain evils and corruptions occur to parts,<br>
but they are salvific and good with respect to wholes<br>
and the harmony of the universe” ( <em>DM</em> 192, 3–6).</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the imposition of one “part” on another,<br>
while apparently distressful to that part,<br>
was necessary and beneficial to the harmony of the “whole,”<br>
a principle which, Iamblichus says, “we see exemplified clearly in a dance” ( <em>DM</em> 56, 14–15).+++(5)+++</p>
<h2 id="evils">Evils</h2>
<p>Evils rooted in corporeal necessities were inevitable and unavoidable,<br>
but moral evils and perverse acts derived from man’s poorly receiving the emanations of the celestial gods,<br>
manipulating them for selfish ends,<br>
or suffering them in an unbalanced way ( <em>DM</em> 194, 4–6; 13–15).+++(5)+++<br>
These evils, however, did not come from the gods themselves.<br>
Iamblichus explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That which is given in one manner [from above],<br>
is received in another by the things here below.<br>
For example, the emanation of <em>Kronos</em> tends to stabilize<br>
and that of <em>Ares</em> is kinetic,<br>
but the passive and generative receptacle in material things receives the former as rigidity and coldness<br>
and the latter as exaggerated inflammation” ( <em>DM</em> 55, 4–11; cf. <em>DM</em> 192, 18–193, 2).+++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the gods descended with unified sameness to preserve the cosmos ( <em>DM</em> 55, 17–18; 194, 8–12)<br>
their powers were received by mortals in a partial and passionate manner; as Iamblichus says,+++(5)+++ [[60]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“parts are incapable of receiving the energies of the whole” ( <em>DM</em> 192, 7–8).</p></blockquote>
<p>Through his participation in the whole the theurgist became immortal and universal,<br>
but as a part he lived and died.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>He ritually encircled his mortal life<br>
with the providential care of a creator.</p>
<p>The whole/part dichotomy<br>
was of central importance to Iamblichus,<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><br>
allowing him to reconcile experiences of evil<br>
and corruption within a good cosmos.<br>
Cosmologies that opposed spirit to matter<br>
or assigned to matter a positive evil force erred, in the view of Iamblichus -<br>
by assuming that the cosmos could be adequately measured by the dialectical oppositions of the discursive mind ( <em>DM</em> 10, 1–7).<br>
A cosmology with matter evilly opposed to spirit<br>
indicated that one’s vision was still partial and fixed in unresolved oppositions.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Iamblichus’s whole/part theodicy<br>
held that the experience of evil was rooted in an incomplete perception,<br>
in a partial identity not yet sacrificed for the good of the whole ( <em>DM</em> 186, 11–187, 3; cf. book IV, chap. 5).+++(5)+++<br>
In this, Iamblichus was simply following Plato,<br>
who, in the <em>Laws</em>, discussed the whole/part dichotomy in a similar way.<br>
Having outlined the order of the world,<br>
the Athenian stranger says that individual souls must also make their contribution.<br>
They exist, he tells his listener,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in order that blissful existence be secured for the life of the whole;<br>
not for your sake was the world generated—<br>
but you were born for its sake” ( <em>Laws</em> 903c).+++(5)+++</p></blockquote>
<p>The partial or whole experience of matter and embodiment<br>
correspond directly to the Platonic description of embodiment in the <em>Phaedo</em> and the <em>Timaeus</em>:<br>
the former being the perspective of a particular soul in a mortal body,<br>
and the latter a view of matter from the perspective of the whole, perpetual and perfect.<br>
For a Platonist, the <em>Timaeus</em> and the <em>Phaedo</em><br>
defined the parameters in which the problem of embodiment was discussed,<br>
and Iamblichus’s solution was that<br>
the blessedness of embodiment as portrayed in the <em>Timaeus</em><br>
was available to the particular soul only by imitating the activity of the Demiurge,<br>
and this was possible only through theurgic rites.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>61</p>
<h2 id="theurgy">Theurgy</h2>
<p>The meaning of theurgy in the history of Platonism becomes clear<br>
if it is seen as the praxis<br>
that allowed souls to move from the experience of embodiment as an isolated prison<br>
to a participation in the World Soul,<br>
where its particularity was re-established in the unity of the whole.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>By entering into the community of the gods as one of its bodies of light,<br>
the embodied soul was no longer alienated by matter<br>
nor passionately drawn to it.+++(5)+++
Embodiment was transformed<br>
from the psychic chaos of suffering<br>
into a cosmos, an adornment of the divine.+++(4)+++<br>
The “lapse of time” in the <em>Timaeus</em> (30a) between material chaos and cosmos—<br>
though only a necessity of discourse when speaking of the World Soul—<br>
was an accurate description of the experience of the embodied soul on its path to demiurgy.<br>
In theurgy the soul gradually transformed the chaos of its embodied experience<br>
into the perfect measures of the cosmos.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><br>
In his mortal aspect<br>
the theurgist became the recipient of this beauty,<br>
while in his mediation of the gods,<br>
he became his own demiurge.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Throughout the theurgist’s lifelong labor (see <em>DM</em> 92, 8–10; 131, 9–10) of building a divine body,<br>
matter was the mirror that reflected the condition of his soul. It was, as Iamblichus says, the “index” ( <em>deigma</em>; <em>DM</em> 80, 15) of divine presence,<br>
and the intensity of the soul’s contact with the gods<br>
was in direct proportion to its receptive capacity.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><br>
In his explanation of appearances ( <em>phasmata</em>) in divination<br>
Iamblichus explains that the higher the divinity,<br>
the more completely it consumes matter:</p>
<p>[[62]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take the immediate consumption of matter by the Gods as no small indication for you;<br>
with Archangels it is consumed in a short time;<br>
with Angels there is a dissolution and elevation from matter;<br>
by <em>Daimones</em> matter is beautifully organized;<br>
Heroes bear a proportionate adaptation to matter in fitting measures and give a skillful attention to it” ( <em>DM</em> 80, 15–81, 4).</p></blockquote>
<p>The rank of a divinity was indicated by its relation to, and command over, matter.<br>
Matter was the index<br>
that measured the degrees of divinity,<br>
and for particular souls<br>
their relation to matter also determined the kind of theurgy they were to practice.<br>
The <em>materia</em> of the rites<br>
varied from stones and plants<br>
to the visionary matter given directly by the gods,<br>
but in all stages matter was not something reluctantly accepted in the rites,<br>
it was the necessary vehicle through which souls were divinized.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>In the <em>De Mysteriis</em> Iamblichus portrays the soul’s experience of matter<br>
through the Egyptian hieroglyph of a young god seated on a lotus.<br>
The material principle, represented by “mud” ( <em>ilus</em>) under the lotus,<br>
serves as the “foundation” ( <em>puthmen</em>) to nourish the lotus<br>
until it develops a circular throne for the god.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><br>
Just so, each embodied soul, rooted in the “mud” of embodiment and the waters of psychic change,<br>
is nourished by this very condition until it is capable of receiving the god.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>The matter of the <em>Phaedo</em> with all its negative effects<br>
was revealed progressively to the theurgist as the matter of the <em>Timaeus</em>,<br>
but only by virtue of the theurgist himself becoming demiurgic<br>
and ritually enacting the “eternal measures” ( <em>metra aidia</em>; <em>DM</em> 65, 4) established in creation.<br>
His perfection, as soul,<br>
was realized only by first assimilating himself to the world,<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup><br>
co-ordinating his “particular” attractions, somatic or intellectual,<br>
with their causal principles.<br>
As the “lowest” divinity,<br>
the human soul achieved its highest condition<br>
only when it was conscious of being lowest,<br>
for only then did it realize its place in the divine hierarchy.+++(5)+++<br>
When the soul’s “receptacles” were cleansed of the accretions added in embodiment<br>
it could become a proper receptacle of the gods<br>
and, like the pure matter of the <em>Timaeus</em>,<br>
transfer this order to the phenomenal world.</p>
<p>63</p>
<h3 id="siddhi">Siddhi</h3>
<p>The perfect theurgist became an embodied Demiurge<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup><br>
whose presence was enough to create harmony out of discord<br>
and drive away evil.+++(5)+++ Iamblichus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[E]very vice and every passion<br>
is entirely removed by theurgists,<br>
for a pure participation of the good is present with the pure,<br>
and they are filled from on high with the fire of truth.<br>
For theurgists there is no impediment from evil spirits,<br>
nor are there hindrances to the goodness of the soul.<br>
Nor does any affectation, or flattery, or the enjoyment of vapors or violent force annoy them.<br>
But, all these, as if struck by lightning,<br>
yield and recede without touching the theurgists,<br>
nor can they even approach them. ( <em>DM</em> 178, 8–16)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having situated his particularity into the circle of the whole,<br>
the theurgist was immune from particular threats in precisely the same way as the gods (cf. <em>DM</em> 201, 16–202, 2).</p></blockquote>
<p>In imitation of divine beings, the body of the theurgist became a vehicle through which the gods appeared to the physical world and through which he received their communion.</p>

<p>Cf. <em>DM</em> 118, 17–119, 5. Iamblichus’s theurgic interpretation of the possession through music or rhythmic speech (cf. Plato’s <em>Ion</em> 536c; <em>Symp</em>. 215e) might be considered by historians of religions<br>
as a viable alternative to the theory that such occurrences are the effect of “anxiety states.”<br>
See, for example, E.R. Dodds, <em>The</em> <em>Greeks and the Irrational</em> (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1951), 79 n.108.&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Each level on the chain of continuity became the “receptacle” of its superior.</p>
<p>Thus, the role of any level would be alternately “formal” or “material,” depending on whether the movement was up or down the chain.</p>
<p>This “functional” view of matter had been outlined by Aristotle in the <em>De Anima</em> (430a, 10–13), where he says that the soul’s cognitive powers are “matter” for the forms which they receive, i.e., insofar as anything is receptive to an informing principle, it is matter/ <em>hule</em> with respect to that principle.+++(4)+++&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Cf. <em>DM</em> 44, 11–45, 1 where the “necessity” of the gods is mingled with their beneficent will; cf. 141, 6–13 where god is said to create all forms of divination with one beneficent will, and 209, 14–17 where natural life forms are said to preserve the will of their maker.&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Ibid., frag. 49, lines 27–29.</p>
<p>Iamblichus refers to this same principle:<br>
the unity that contains multiplicity at <em>DM</em> 59, 9–15. Fragment 49 of Iamblichus’s commentary on the <em>Timaeus</em> (33b) is called by Dillon, “an elaborate encomium of sphericity” (ibid., 326).</p>
<p>The sphere, revered by Platonists and Pythagoreans as the most simple and inclusive of all forms, deserves a more detailed study.</p>
<p>Note also Iamblichus’s description of the priestess of Delphi being divinely possessed by a rotating fire ( <em>DM</em> 126, 13). For an interesting study of the “sphere” and circularity in the Platonic tradition, see Lynne Ballew, <em>Straight and Circular: A Study of Imagery in Greek</em> <em>Philosophy</em> (Assen, The Netherlands: Van Gorcum, 1979), 79–128; 131–33.&#160;<a href="#fnref:16" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Interesting parallels exist between the praxis of later Platonists and the methods of yoga.</p>
<p>Compare the theurgists’ goal of identifying with the order of the cosmos with Eliade’s description of the goal of the yogi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“all these [yogic] exercises pursue the same goal, which is to abolish multiplicity and fragmentation, to reintegrate, to unify, to make whole. . . .<br>
Indeed one can speak of the first yogic stages as an effort toward the ‘cosmicization’ of man.<br>
<em>To transform the chaos of biomental life</em> <em>into a cosmos</em> . . . .” (my emphasis). Mircea Eliade, <em>Yoga: Immortality and Freedom</em>, trans. Willard Trask (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), 97.</p></blockquote>

<p>Iamblichus refers to the ability of souls to intensify this presence when he says that continual prayer “renders the receptacle(s) of the soul far greater [for the communion] of the Gods” ( <em>DM</em> 238, 15–239, 1).+++(5)+++&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Though this point shall be pursued later in arithmogonic terms, a suggestive ritual parallel existed in the example of the pharaoh (and his priest functionaries) in ancient Egyptian cult.
