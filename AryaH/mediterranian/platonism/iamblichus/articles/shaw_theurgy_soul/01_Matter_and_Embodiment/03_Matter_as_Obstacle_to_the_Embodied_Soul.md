*What good . . . can be generated*

*from matter? *

t is precisely in the turn to composite lives that the perspective on matter changes from that of the World Soul to that of particular Iembodied souls; in turn, the portrayal of matter becomes pessimistic. Even the “optimistic” *Timaeus* touched briefly on the cause for this pessimism in its description of the confusion that attends the embodiment of the soul \( *Tim. * 44\). In this regard, the pessimistic language of the *Phaedo* should be understood within the context of the soul’s entire incarnational itinerary. The perception of the body as a “prison” would be an important and necessary step in the soul’s progress toward a complete incarnation. The negative imagery functioned as a catalyst to purge the soul of an identity anchored in the sensible world; in light of Iamblichus’s itinerary for the study of the Platonic dialogues, where the *Phaedo* is read early on,1 its negative view of embodiment should be seen as a medicinal shock, intended to disturb the soul’s complacency and later to be ameliorated with a more complete understanding.2

1. Iamblichus’s itinerary for the reading of the Platonic dialogues and their relation to the development of the virtues is explained in *Anonymous Prolegomena to* *Platonic Philosophy*, intro., text, and trans. L.G. Westerink \(Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1962\), xxxvii–xl.

2. In support of this interpretation I refer the reader to Iamblichus’s definition of *katharsis* in *De Anima* where he contrasts the “lesser” perfections of catharsis, which are simply purgative and remove the soul from somatic attachments, with the complete catharsis that follows purgation and withdrawal with a reinvestment into particulars in a divine manner \( *Stob*. I, 455, 25–456, 8\).

That matter and embodiment were described both negatively and positively by Plato suggests that his writings were not to be taken as univocal truths but—as Iamblichus believed—spiritual exercises employed by students at different stages of development and under the careful guidance of teachers.3 While one student would be encouraged to dwell on the ascetic themes of the *Phaedo*, another would be directed to the *Symposium* to contemplate erotic connections that would be impossible unless the soul had already practiced the asceticism and withdrawal encouraged by the *Phaedo*.

The Platonic worldview was hierarchical, and in Iamblichus’s Syrian school each dialogue had a specific purpose \( *skopos*\), the realization of which was dependent upon the student fulfilling its precedents.4

They were not simply intellectual exercises but demanded profound transformations in the students who practiced them as part of their spiritual discipline.

Without taking into consideration Iamblichus’s hierarchical understanding of Platonic education and its relation to the cosmos, his negative descriptions of matter in the *De Mysteriis* would appear inconsistent with his position on matter outlined above. For example, in book III, chapter 28, Iamblichus condemned the makers of magical talismans and idols on the grounds that their work was artificial \( *technikos*\) and not theurgic \( *theourgikos*\) \( *DM*, 170, 9–10\).

Iamblichus dissociated theurgy from such artifice with a twofold critique, expressing concern for \(a\) the character of the idol maker, and \(b\) the material of his work. Iamblichus argued that while theurgy revealed the creative powers of the Demiurge and was 3. Pierre Hadot recaptures this important, yet often unnoticed, aspect of philosophy in antiquity, “Exercices spirituels,” in *Annuaire: Ecole Pratique des Hautes* *Etudes* \(Paris: 1976–77\), 63–70; republished in Hadot, *Exercices Spirituels et Philosophie Antique* \(Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1981\), 13–58.

4. For a discussion of Iamblichus’s organization of Platonic dialogues according to the “central theme” or *skopos* of each, and the influence of this method on this history of literary criticism, see James Coulter, *The Literary Microcosm: Theories of* *Interpretation of the Later Neoplatonists* \(Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1976\), 73–94. For an explanation of the *skopos* as a central hermeneutic tool in Iamblichus’s exegeses of the Platonic dialogues see B.D. Larsen, *Jamblique de Chalcis: Exégète et philosophe* \(Aarhus: Universitetsforlaget, 1972\), 429–46. Iamblichus’s notion of the *skopos* as a hermeneutic tool became the central principle for all Neoplatonic exegesis.

*Matter as Obstacle to the Embodied Soul* rooted in uniform essences, the art of the idol maker concerned merely the last efflux of nature and attempted to manipulate the material world with sympathetic attractions. The creator of the stars and planets, true images of the gods, was *theos*, but of artificial idols Iamblichus says: “God is not their maker, but man. Nor are they produced out of uniform and intelligible essences, but from matter which has been acquired. What good, therefore, can be generated from matter and from the corporeal powers around matter and in bodies?” \( *DM* 168, 3–8\). Iamblichus no doubt meant to refute Porphyry’s depiction of theurgy as a *material* manipulation of the gods, and therefore emphasized the indigence of material things as compared to divine beings; nevertheless he does ask:

“What good can be generated from matter?” \( *DM* 168, 6\), which seems to contradict his remarks in the *Theology of Numbers* and *On* *General Mathematical Science*. It is clear that the context of Iamblichus’s discourse has changed significantly; here his description of matter was unquestionably negative.

Throughout his exposition of theurgic sacrifice in book V, Iamblichus referred to matter as a pollution from which souls must be cleansed. For example, he says: “the contamination from material things falls upon those who are held in a material body; and as many souls as are subject to defilement by matter should necessarily be purified” \( *DM* 204, 4–7\). Matter was the obstacle that kept souls from communion with the gods. Since the gods were free from the pollution of matter, to reach them souls had to break free from material bonds. Iamblichus says:

Just as the Gods split matter with lightning and separate from it from things which are essentially immaterial but have been dominated and bound by matter, and from being passive render them impassive, so also our \[sacrificial\] fire, imitating the activity of the divine fire, destroys everything material in the sacrifices, purifies the offerings by fire, and *frees them from the bonds of matter*. It makes them suitable for communion with the Gods through the purity of nature and in the same manner it frees us from the bonds of generation, assimilates us to the Gods, makes us fit for their friendship \( *philia*\), and leads our material nature up to the immaterial. \( *DM* 215, 15–216, 8\)

In these passages matter is opposed to the gods and the body is seen as the prison from which souls are freed. Yet Iamblichus also said that matter was an impediment only for individual souls, not for the World Soul or celestial souls \(stars\). For these, embodiment produced no “injury” nor “obstacle” \( *DM* 200, 7–8\), but “to a particular soul the communion with the body is demeaning in both these respects” \( *DM* 200, 8–10\). What determined whether or not matter impeded souls was the kind of body they inhabited and the perspective this allowed them. While human souls were particular and had a partial perspective, the World Soul and celestial souls were “wholes,” complete worlds with a global perspective—a critical difference to which we will return.

The “bonds of generation” from which souls had to be cleansed were personified by Iamblichus as *daimones*, mediating entities that tied souls to their bodies.5 In the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus says: “One must assign to daimones the jurisdiction over generative powers, as well as the responsibility over nature and of binding souls to bodies” \( *DM* 67, 15–68, 1\). To free the soul from the bonds of generation theurgic sacrifice had to overcome the daimonic powers of nature.

For, Iamblichus says, “*Daimones* lead souls down into nature” \( *DM*

79, 9–10\), not up to the gods. Yet, these same daimons followed divine will. “\[They\] bring into manifest activity the invisible good of the Gods . . . reveal what is ineffable in the Gods, shape what is formless into forms, and render what is beyond all measure into visible ratios” \( *DM* 16, 16–17, 4\). In the *De Mysteriis* daimons were portrayed both as agents of the Demiurge and as powers that defiled the soul by tying it to matter. This ambivalence was due to their centrifugal activity: in being agents of the Demiurge in the “procession” of the gods, it was their task to exteriorize specific aspects of the divine, and in disseminating the divine presence into matter daimons also led the attention of particular souls into a centrifugal 5. The locus classicus of the doctrine of daimons for Neoplatonists was Plato’s *Symposium* 202e–203a. For a development of the doctrine after Plato among the Stoics see A.D. Nock, “Posidonius,” *Journal of Roman Studies* 49 \(1959\): 1–15. For a comparison between the daimons of Iamblichus and their portrayal in the Chaldean Oracles, see Friedrich W. Cremer, *Die Chaldaïschen Orakel und Jamblich* *de Mysteriis* \(Meisenheim am Glan: Anton Hain, 1969\), 68–86.

*Matter as Obstacle to the Embodied Soul* and extroverted attitude. This was what bound them to their bodies and caused them to suffer.

In his opening remarks to Porphyry in the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus said that he would reply to his questions theologically, philosophically, or theurgically \( *DM* 7, 2–6\). Iamblichus’s description of daimons surely was drawn from his theurgic vocabulary: daimons were the personified powers of matter, entities whose centrifugal influence on souls was encountered and turned around in theurgic rituals. Iamblichus, therefore, allowed for a functional dualism within his monism. In the imagery of theurgic rites he pitted spiritual gods against material daimons, but as the soul was gradually freed from the bonds of generation it began to participate in the fundamental unity of the cosmos. By fulfilling the commands of a theurgic rite, the soul began to share in the continuity that extended from the gods to matter and in which the materializing daimons played an important and beneficial role.6

The dualistic language of the *De Mysteriis* was even more evident in the Chaldean Oracles. Based on the extant fragments, the Oracles seem to have been more “hieratic” than the *De Mysteriis* and less

“philosophical”; they pertain strictly to ritual phenomena and are in no way an apology for ritual practices as was the *De Mysteriis*.

Hans Lewy and Frederick Cremer have proven that these oracles,

“recorded” by second-century Platonists, had a significant influence on Iamblichean theurgy.7 Their negative portrayal of the material world is evident in the following *logia*:

Fragment 88: \[Nature\] persuades us to believe that *daimones* are pure, and that the offspring of evil matter are good and useful.8

6. “Continuity” was the sine qua non for all theurgy. See *DM* 31, 18–32, 7. For the role of daimons in this continuity see *DM* 16, 6–20, 19.

Fragment 90: from the hollows of the earth leap chthonian dogs \(i.e., daimons\), who never show a true sign to a mortal.9

Fragment 135: they \[ *daimones*\] enchant souls, forever turning them away from the \[holy\] rites.10

Yet, as in the *De Mysteriis*, the Oracles also said that matter was derived from the highest divinity, the “source of sources” \( *pege* *pegon*\).11 Faced with this ambiguity, Cremer asks: “Wenn die Materie von Gott kommt, wodurch ist sie ein *kakon*?”12 and answered that Iamblichus attempted to resolve this problem by recourse to the notion of “unsympathetic sympathy,”13 of a “matter alien to the gods” \( *he hule allotria ton theon*; *DM* 233, 17\). Lewy said that the development of an “evil matter” represented the attempt by late antique thinkers, under Gnostic influence, to correct the portrayal of matter in Plato’s *Timaeus*. This resulted in a conflation of monist and dualist themes whose precise origin, he says, “can no longer be known.”14 Nevertheless, in his study of the Chaldean goddess Hecate, Lewy provides the key for understanding the role of matter in the *De Mysteriis* as well as in the Oracles.15

According to the Oracles, Hecate was queen of the daimons, and as such she personified all the powers of nature and matter. Lewy explains: “The Chaldean Hecate encountered the human souls in forms *always adequate to their internal condition*: for those sunk in the body she was necessity; for the erring, demonic temptation; for the renegade, a curse; for those who recalled their divine nature, a guide; and for those who returned home, grace.”16 Hecate was a mirror of the embodied soul, reflecting the soul’s experience of 9.

*Matter as Obstacle to the Embodied Soul* matter and its own internal condition. In this sense, matter \(Hecate\) functioned as an index of the soul’s spiritual condition and was evil only in proportion to the soul’s attachment to its material existence. From a theurgic perspective, therefore, matter could not be considered apart from the soul’s existential situation.

In the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus used the terms *hule*, *phusis*, *soma*, and *genesis* nearly synonymously to define the “place” of the soul’s extension.17 They made up the field in which the soul’s faculties were developed and tested, and its use of power in a corporeal existence determined its evaluation of matter. Embodied life could be experienced as a bondage to fate or as an opportunity to live under divine providence, depending on how the soul used its powers. For Iamblichus, providence \( *pronoia*\) and fate \( *heimarmene*\) were functional terms describing the soul’s experience of one divine law: salvific for those who obeyed and embodied it, oppressive to those who resisted it.18

In a letter to his student Macedonius, Iamblichus explained the nature of the soul and its relation to fate and providence. He says: The essence of the soul, in itself, is immaterial and incorporeal, entirely ungenerated and indestructible, possessing in itself Being and Life; it is completely self-moved and yet is the principle of nature and of all movements \[Cf. *DM* 35, 9–11\]. The soul, therefore, to the degree that it is itself, contains in itself self-authority, freedom, and life. But, to the degree that it gives itself to generated things, it is put under the sway of the cosmos, and to that degree it is led by fate and serves the necessities of nature. \( *Stob*. II, 173, 5–

13\)

Fate ruled only those whose attention had been given over to generated things, not those who participated in their guiding principle.

Iamblichus continued:

17. See Cremer’s remarks, *Die Chaldaïschen Orakel*, 91.

18. The term *pronoia* is inadequately translated by “providence.” For Neoplatonists it suggested the unknowable/\(pre\)knowable presence of the divine in the world. See J. Trouillard, “Note sur *PROOUSIOS* et *PRONOIA* chez Proclos,” *Revue* *des Etudes Grecques* 72 \(1960\): 80–87.

To be brief, the movements of fate around the world may be likened to immaterial and noetic activities and revolutions, and the order of fate resembles this intelligible and pristine order. Secondary powers \[encosmic gods\] are joined with primary causes

\[hypercosmic gods\] and the multitude in generation, and thus all things under fate are joined with undivided essence and with providence as a guiding principle. In accord with this same essence, then, fate is interwoven with providence and, in reality, *fate is providence*, is established from it and around it.

This being the case, the principle of human actions moves in concert with both these principles of the cosmos \[fate and providence\]. But there is also a principle of action liberated from nature and free from the movement of the cosmos. On account of this it is not contained in the motion of the world. Thus, it is not introduced from nature nor from any motion but is pre-established as more ancient, not having been derived from anything.19

Wherefore, since the soul is allotted certain parts from all the parts and elements of the cosmos and uses these, it is contained in the order of fate, takes its place in this order, fulfills its conditions, and makes proper use of it. And to the degree that the soul combines in itself pure reason, self-substantiated and self-moved, acting from itself and perfect, it is liberated from all external things.

But to the degree that the soul extends into different modes of life, falls into generation, and identifies with the body, it is sewn into the order of the world. \( *Stob*. II, 173, 26–174, 27\) The “parts” given to each soul from the totality of the cosmos made up its astrological portrait, and it was this confluence of elements at a particular juncture in time and space that made up the 19. Iamblichus referred to this “more ancient” and “pre-existent” principle to distinguish theurgical divination from human divination \( *DM* 165, 14–166, 1\). In the *De Mysteriis* Iamblichus often referred to astrology, one of the important forms of divination in late antiquity, and this passage on “fate” should be understood in an astrological context. One’s fate was commonly believed to be determined by one’s astral nativity—a point Iamblichus denies \( *DM* 270, 9–11\). Note also in this passage that Iamblichus mentions repeatedly that the soul is free from astral determinism; the soul is *apolutos* \( *Stob*. 174, 12\), *aphetos* \(173, 14\), and *authairetos* \(173, 15\). Iamblichus’s argument draws, in large part, from the Stoics’ accommodation of

“fate” and “providence.” Cf. Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, *Astrologie grecque* \(Brussels: Culture et Civilisation, 1963\), 31–32.

*Matter as Obstacle to the Embodied Soul* soul’s localized self, the somatic testing ground that measured the soul’s ability to integrate corporeal existence into a divine pattern.

Failure to fulfill the conditions of the body resulted in fixations, unfulfilled conditions, and the subsequent suffering of “fate.” The proper care of the body and somatic life, however, freed the soul from these bonds and allowed it, as Iamblichus says, to see “the turnings of fate to be like the perfect revolutions of the stars” \( *Stob*.

II, 173, 26–28\).
