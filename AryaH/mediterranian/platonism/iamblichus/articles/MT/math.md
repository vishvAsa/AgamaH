A nice article on aspects of the great Syrian sage Iamblichos' philosophy. The numbers of Iamblichos:
1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 24, 25, 49, 51, 75, 76, 99, 125, 249, 251...
Do you see their logic?+++(=??)+++  
Their pattern is a centerpiece in his philosophy here. 

There is also lot of material for comparative philosophy with H tradition.  
Comparisons could be made with the core of mImAMsA;  
the idea of the altar of syllables.  
The saiddhAntika shaiva theory of Atman-s etc.  
Encircling the sphere has a somewhat distinct yet comparable expression in early H thought  
in a mantra of maitrAvaruNi agastya:

> pra yad itthA mahinA nR^ibhyo asty  
araM rodasI kakShye nAsmai |  
saM vivya indro vR^ijanaM na bhUmA  
bharti svadhAvAM opasham iva dyAm ||  

Indra encircling the worlds in the primary metaphor here


Iamblichos on mathematics: one of the reasons I have felt an intellectual kinship with him -

> The primary study of every mathematician, including the private individual,  
> in each matter, whatsoever it be, is the theological,  
> by harmonizing it in rank and activities with the being and the power of the gods by some fitting analogy.  
> This, indeed, is thought to deserve the greatest concern from men,  
> as for example, in the case of numbers,  
> which sorts of numbers are akin to which sorts of gods and of like nature with them,  
> and in the cases of other branches of mathematics  
> they are accustomed to have the same conception.
