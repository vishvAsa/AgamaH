      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;spirits-with-no-rigid-shape&#34;&gt;Spirits with no rigid shape&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sentona97&#34;&gt;sentona97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;System of beliefs centered around family and life after death was called “the religion of Numa”. In its essence it’s animism – spirits (numina) were connected with all things, beings and acts of people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In Roman animism every being, thing, activity or idea had their divine character and meaning. The forces of nature, therefore, weren’t personified in human or any other physical shape. Roman king Numa ordered that gods shouldn’t be represented as statues. That means that genius of the house, penates, lares, manes and lemures are forces not personified and the well-being of the family depends on them. Things that happen in nature are also divine because they are unseen, made by the gods or are gods themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Romans had a practical and animistic view on religion which was shown through many deities who would change themselves or their attributes depending on the situation. This is something we see also with, for example, the Etruscans whose deities change attributes very often, depending on the situation they are in. That’s how they can change genders and their meanings, because in the early stages they didn’t have a human form.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Romans would also deify different human feelings and acts. For example loyalty (Fides) or fear (Pavor/Pallor). With the development of the state and political life abstract things like hope, victory and the state itself became deified.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So, old Roman deities were abstract and not personified. That’s why in the early stages there weren’t temples or statues of gods and the rituals were made with such accuracy to make the forces work in their benefit. The religion of this time was much more strict.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancestor-cult&#34;&gt;Ancestor cult&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When we talk about animism the phenomenon of death has to be mentioned, too. In the consciousness of our ancestors, death wasn’t considered as something devastating because the spirit of the deceased stayed around the living centered around hearth, their grave or nature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The concept of death is different than in Abrahamic religions were the souls go in another world – in Roman religion, and other pagan religions, dead stay in this world. Living would give things to the dead such as food and drink, a custom which is present even today.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The spirits of the ancestors would also care about their living descendants and their community. That’s why the living were obliged to ensure the continuation of the family line, so the ancestors can be revived. Therefore, the fear of dying was almost unknown.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;heroes&#34;&gt;Heroes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is something very much common in the ancient world and is seen very well among the warriors who would go in the battle with honor and bravery. Warriors were celebrated and almost deified, there were the ones in the close contact with death itself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Romans awarded their warriors with triumph where men would become close to the aspect of kings and gods. The man who celebrated it would be called “vir triumphalis” for the rest of his life, alongside with many honors in the community.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the death of the men who celebrated the triumphs, on every funeral of his descendants there would be an actor dressed in triumphal toga who also wore his postmortal mask. That is the clear representation of deified ancestors who were remembered because of their honor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roman animism was mostly preserved in the ancestral cult and sometimes in abstract points concerning state and human behaviour. Because it was so deeply connected to the ancestors, it remained mostly pure and unchanged unlike the paganism of Roman state and their officials.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Foreign influences</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sentona97&#34;&gt;sentona97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivations&#34;&gt;Motivations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openness&lt;/strong&gt;: For Romans, deities were ones who had to serve their purpose. If the purpose wasn’t served even if you gave sacrifices, they would try their luck from another deity or the manifestation of the same deity. This is one of the reasons why many foreign deities and cults were popular.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Romans would also implement deities of people they were in war with. This was done in order to attract deities on their side, so they can leave their enemies and be victorious. Good example from this is accepting the Juno from the Etruscan city of Veii when they were in war.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-adaptions&#34;&gt;Early adaptions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With the foreign influence, Roman religion slowly changed from animism to the anthropomorphized version of deities which prevailed in the Mediterranean world. Romans had a view on religion which can be explained as animism, for every action there was an attribute of deities for it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the early stages of the Roman world, in the “religion of Numa”, different deities would start being implemented in the pantheon. This process happened first when deities from surrounding italic tribes were accepted and later on it was from Greeks and other cultures. Because of this, some deities that are interpreted as purely Roman, were actually implemented in the pantheon in the early stages of the religion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;etruscan-influence&#34;&gt;Etruscan influence&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It’s believed that the Etruscan kings were the first ones to build the temples and statues of gods. Building of the temple of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva on the Capitoline Hill marked a big change in the Roman religion – from that time the gods are slowly anthropomorphized.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the early stages, Roman religion was animistic but with interpretatio romana, foreign influences started being implemented and it changed their religion. Under the influence of the Etruscans, Romans had triads of gods. Relatively early it was Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus…&#xA;&amp;hellip;and later on arose triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Until the Etruscan domination Romans didn’t build temples – deities were represented only symbolically. So the stone was the place of Jupiter, where spear was thrown was the place of Mars, fire was Vesta and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;greek-influence&#34;&gt;Greek influence&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From the early stages of the Roman world, Greeks had an influence on Roman religion. Greek deities, rituals and religious views were taken from the Greek cities in Campania and south Italy. Many Roman gods were identified with Greek gods, which then was a common practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roman pantheon was, in the end, practically identified with the Greek pantheon so the Greek legends and myths had a Roman variant. The most important influence of the Greeks was the anthropomorphization of the Roman gods and the change in religious perspective. With time, Greek influence dominated, especially in the Hellenistic era, when the temples and sculptures started being very much alike the ones from the Greek world. Romans brought in Rome, after the conquest of Greek cities, Greek sculptures of gods which were placed in temples.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cult of Cybele entered Rome during the war with Hannibal, becoming an official cult. During the war with Cimbri, a priest of Cybele from Pesinunt was staying in Rome which made Cybele extremely popular with people. Even Gaius Marius visited Pesinunt after ending the “revolt”.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;egyptian-influence&#34;&gt;Egyptian influence&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From Sulla’s time the Egyptian cults of Isis and Osiris, Serapis, Harpocrates and Anubis started being popular. In this time astrology and fortune telling started being popular – Lucius Tarutius calculated the date of birth of Romulus and building of Rome using Egyptian astrology.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resistance&#34;&gt;Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There were opponents to all of this, people who thought that accepting foreign influences is degrading the Roman religion. One of them was Lucius Paullus, consul in 50 BCE, who said the temple of Isis inside of pomerium has to be destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But, the cult of Isis was so strong in Rome that no worker dared to desecrate the temple of Isis. Lucius Paullus took the axe himself and started destroying the temple while people around him looked in horror.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Vesta</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sentona97&#34;&gt;sentona97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cult-origins&#34;&gt;Cult origins&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The collegium of Vestal virgins was fundamental for the security of the Roman state. Even though the origin of the Vestals is said to be made by the legendary king Numa Pompilius, their origin is probably much older. Originally, the temple of Vesta was in the shape of a round hut made out of straw and clay with a pointed roof where the girls took care of the fire. The fire was necessary for the survival of the small communities. In religious context it’s the sacred flame, the spark of life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;temple-and-virgins&#34;&gt;Temple and virgins&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the temple of goddess Vesta a sacred fire always had to burn which represented a symbolical flame of the Roman state. That fire could only have been burned by the hands of virgin Vestal priestesses. Vestals had a great reputation and were chosen from chaste families.&#xA;-The number of Vestal virgins got bigger as time went on and in the end it was 18 women and girls of whom only the oldest 6 were considered real Vestals and the other 12 were apprentices and helpers. Vestal girls shouldn’t have been younger than 6 or older than 10. Vestals had to be without any physical anomalies and with an unblemished reputation. They would spend 10 years in learning of their duties, 10 years in performing those duties and 10 more years in the training of new Vestal virgins.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every 5 years new 3 girls would be chosen instead of 3 Vestals and when the Vestal virgin would die the new one would have been chosen instead. When a girl entered the Vestal collegium she automatically stopped being under the potestas of a man. In early times, Vestals were the only women with such privilege. This allowed them to be powerful and privileged and their words held a lot of power.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;virginity&#34;&gt;Virginity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vestals had to hold a vow of virginity for the time of their duty and breaking of this vow was considered as a direct insult to the interests of Roman state which called for severe punishments. Breaking of the vow was seen as breaking of the pact Romans made with gods (pax deorum) and was typically accompanied with the observation of bad signs. In the turbulent times of late Republic there were, of course, false accusation on Vestal virgins breaking their vows.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The punishment was severe, they would be either stoned to death or buried alive. She would be placed alive in a coffin and taken through the Forum which resembled a real funeral. Then she would be locked alive in a small room underground where she would die.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;retirement&#34;&gt;Retirement&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the Vestal virgins fulfilled their duties they would get some sort of retirement money and could get married. Marrying the Vestal virgin was considered to be a great honor and good luck because her duty was the most important in the state.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;end&#34;&gt;End&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The collegium of Vesta was prohibited in 394 by the order of the emperor Theodosius. The sacred flame of Vesta, that was burning for over a millennium, has been put out and the Vestal virgins were disbanded. Serena, cousin of Theodosius, came into the temple of Vesta and took the necklace from the statue of Vesta and put it on her neck. Then, one of the last Vestals appeared and cursed her because of the sacrilege and disrespect. It seems as if she really was cursed because her husband Stilicho and her son died – her family was destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
