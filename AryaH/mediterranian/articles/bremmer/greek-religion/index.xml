      <description>&lt;p&gt;I. INTRODUCTION: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was there ever such a thing as ‘Greek religion’? It may be an odd quetion to start this Survey with, but it should be absolutely clear from the start that Greek religion as a monolithic entity never existed. When archaic Greece emerged from the Dark Ages around 800 BC, religious unity and diversity had evolved together with the unity and diversity of the Greek world as a whole, as it came into existence with the emergence of the polis. Every city had its own pantheon in which some gods were more important than others and some gods not even worshipped at all. Every city also had its own mythology, its own religious calendar, and its own festivals (Chapter IV, §3). No Greek city, then, was a religious clone.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>
