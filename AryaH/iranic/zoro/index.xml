      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yazata-s&#34;&gt;yazata-s&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the amesha spenta-s+++(=yazata-s)+++ we find an invention of new devatA-s, in part to conceal the old ones. Thus, the abstractions of vohu-manaH, asha vahishta, and khshathra-vairiya are raised to devatA-s. The abstractions haurvatAt and amaratAt are used to conceal the old demonized twin devatA-s (i.e. the ashvinau).&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ishmin-and-the-raudra-devata-s/&#34;&gt;MT-iShmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The old devatA-s mithra (=mitra), baga (=bhaga), airiyaman(=aryaman), vAyu (same), aredvI surA anAhitA (=sarasvatI), haoma (=soma), thworashtar (=tvaShTar), thrita (=trita), apAm-napAt (same), spentA Armaiti (=aramati), yima vivanghat (=yama vaivasvata), and nairyosangha (=narAshaMsa) were, in large part, maintained as is but reconfigured as partisans of the ahuric force directed against the daeva-s.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ishmin-and-the-raudra-devata-s/&#34;&gt;MT-iShmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some devatA-s were retained as is, but they were given a new preferred named, and in some cases their old preferred name might being demonized as a daeva. Thus, the old varuNA received a new preferred appellation of ahura mazdA; viShNu received a new name raShnu, suggesting that the old ‘vi-‘ prefix was interpreted as a negative ‘vi-‘ prefix and replaced by a “right” “ra-” prefix; indra received the preferred name verethraghna, even as the name indra (andra) was demonized as indra-daeva; agni also received a new preferred name in the form of Atar.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ishmin-and-the-raudra-devata-s/&#34;&gt;MT-iShmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;the most drastic change, i.e. the attenuation of the “raudra” class of deities &amp;hellip; In the avesta only vAyu is retained and the rest of this class is apparently nullified or transmogrified. This is rather dramatic relative to what happened in the Indo-Aryan sister group. Here, the old raudra class underwent major changes but was never attenuated as in the avestan world. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;demonized-deva-s&#34;&gt;Demonized deva-s&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;he innovates to create a new “head daeva” for his pandemonium:Angra manyu who is described as: daevAnAm daevotamA. Angra manyu is followed by the following series: indra daeva; saurva daeva; nAnghaithya daeva; taurvi; zairi; aeshma. Of this series the first three are transparent demonizations of indra, sharva and the nAsatyA. &amp;hellip; &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;taurvi has no counterpart in the veda, though its cognate tUrvi used in a positive sense to described deva-s.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;we cannot rule out the possibility that a demonized viShNu equivalent underlies the zairi of the Iranians.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Iranian tradition recorded during the Sassanian rule we have one more demon coming after nAnghaithya daeva named tarOmaiti (tarOmat in Pahlavi) who is battled by the goddess spentA Armaiti (or just Armaiti). We posit that tarOmaiti corresponds to an inversion of Armaiti who is the daughter of ahura mazdA in the Iranian world. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;aeshma is one of the most feared entities of the avestan tradition.&amp;rdquo; Cognate with vedic ishmin. rudra/marut-class.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;rituals&#34;&gt;Rituals&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;icons&#34;&gt;Icons&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;In fact the cult of zarathuShTra was a vigorously iconoclastic one which appears to have been imbibed by the Judaistic stream of the Semitic world. But on the other hand other Middle Eastern Semites and Elamites appear to have influenced the Iranians towards iconic worship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;the Elephantine papyri mention that the Iranians demolished several temples of Egyptian gods while apparently sparing that of Yahweh built by their Judean proteges.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivations&#34;&gt;Motivations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The old IE system, like many heathen systems, has deities who as actions relative to humans or their domesticated animals is ambivalent. The raudra class of deities are epitomes of this ambivalence of action. Why the Hindu system revels in the various shades of grey, zarathuShtra was driven by black and white binary thought. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
