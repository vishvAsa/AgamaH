The first duty should be fulfilled within a day, the second should last at least thirty years–a contrast which marks the difference in value between dead body and living soul, the one belonging to Ahriman, the other to Ohrmazd. Both sets of rites, of the one day and the many years, include immensely ancient elements representing different historic layers of belief.

  <p>WHEN death comes, Zoroastrians have two pressing duties: to dispose of the polluting corpse with care and celerity, according to strict rules, and to do everything possible to help the disembodied soul to reach heaven and be blessed. The first duty should be fulfilled within a day, the second should last at least thirty years&ndash;a contrast which marks the difference in value between dead body and living soul, the one belonging to Ahriman, the other to Ohrmazd. Both sets of rites, of the one day and the many years, include immensely ancient elements representing different historic layers of belief. Some of the beliefs themselves were discarded millennia ago, but the observances have long outlasted them.</p>
<p>Some of the most singular of the traditional rites of death, with regard to both body and soul, required the presence of a dog; and these one cannot hope to understand, even imperfectly, without considering in historical terms the part played by the dog in Zoro astrian life. In distant days the remote forebears of the Iranians must have had a close working partnership with dogs when they lived as nomads on the Asian steppes; for the custom of riding horses was then unknown, and they must have herded their cattle on foot, and so have depended greatly on dogs to drive and guard them. These two animals, the cow and dog, were presumably the chief ones with whom the proto-Iranians had sustained contact; and they both came, not only to share their ordinary lives, but also to have part in their religious beliefs and practices&ndash;beliefs and practices which in due course became part of the heritage of Zoro astrianism.</p>
<p>In recent times the Zoroastrians of the Yazdi plain have had only a limited need for dogs, since they could not hunt or become herdsmen,&rsquo; and cattle in the oasis villages were kept in stalls. So the</p>
<p>It was customary in the villages of the plain for most of the sheep, stalled through the winter, to be put in charge of a shepherd in May and seot in a flock</p>
<p>140 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG practical use for a dog was chiefly as a guard against thieves and brigands, and to drive off wolves, hyenas, and jackals. The brigands have now gone, together with the wolves and hyenas, and even the thieves and jackals are less plentiful. Nevertheless, in 1964 there was still in every Zoroastrian village an abundance of dogs. Each oasis village had its own predominant type of animal, and Sharifabad and its two neighbours were therefore distinct from one another in this respect. Prosperous Hasanabad had huge, tawny, mastiff-like beasts, descended presumably from guard-dogs brought there for protection by the first Zoroastrian settlers at the beginning of this century, when the village was repeatedly plundered by robbers coming up from Fars. Most of these impressive creatures had owners, and were well fed and on acquaintance overwhelmingly friendly.2 The dogs of Mazra Kalantar were smaller and mostly sandy yellow, but there was a striking group of long-haired white ones which were very handsome when cared for. Shehriar Zohrabi, in whose house I stayed, owned a beautiful animal of this strain, called Lali, to whom his children were devoted; but most of the Mazra dogs were masterless, with the lanes for their only home. This was the case also in Sharifabad, for these two villages lacked the big gardens of Hasanabad, and the old houses were too cramped for it to be easy to keep dogs in them. The Sharifabadi dogs were mostly black and rather plain, though there was a strain of golden-brown, retriever-like animals. A few of the black dogs bad the markings which are held to represent the &lsquo;four eyes&rsquo; of the dogs of the Vendidad, that is, they had a light-brown fleck over each eye; but the villagers in no way singled these out or held them in especial respect.: White dogs were unknown in Sharifabad; but D. Khodadad himself owned a snow-white animal which he used for preference in rites and ceremonies, since white is the Zoroastrian colour. By a touch of irony</p>
<p>to the bills to graze the spring herbage there; but the shepherd was always a Moslem, and Zoroastrians were often reluctant to entrust their animals to him, sayiog that it was remarkable how often when an animal died &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; (for the benefit, they thought, of the shepherd&rsquo;s stomach), it chanced to be one of theirs.</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 141 this dog, probably one of the last of the many thousands that have been kept by the Zoroastrian priests of Iran, was a pure-bred terrier imported from Europe and answering to the name of Jacky. He had been owned by an English family in Yazd, who gave him to the Dastur when they left, because he had admired him. He was much smaller than any of the lane-dogs, which even in Sharifabad and Mazras were all large animals from working strains.</p>
<p>Most of the lane-dogs, however formidable they might look, were of touchingly meek and affable dispositions, and if not too frightened to let one approach would respond eagerly to a caress. Many, however, had learnt a desperate wariness, because of the increase in the Moslem population. In Sharifabad the dogs dis tinguished clearly between Moslem and Zoroastrian, and were prepared to go, with a diffident politeness but full of hope, into a crowded Zoroastrian assembly, or to fall asleep trustfully in a Zoroastrian lane, but would flee as before Satan from a group of Moslem boys. Moslems are not, of course, invariably unkind to dogs. Some themselves own herd- or watch-dogs, and apart from this there are naturally many Moslems who would not deliberately harm any creature. But undeniably there are others who are savagely and wantonly cruel to dogs, on the pretext that Muhammad called them unclean; but there seems no factual basis for this, and the evidence points rather to Moslem hostility to these animals having been deliberately fostered in the first place in Iran, as a point of opposition to the old faith there. Certainly in the Yazdi area na najib Moslems found a double satisfaction in tormenting dogs, since they were thereby both aflicting an unclean creature and causing distress to the infidel who cherished him. There are grim old stories from the time when the annual poll-tax was exacted, of the tax gatherer tying a Zoroastrian and a dog together, and flogging both alternately until the money was somehow forthcoming, or death released them. I myself was spared any worse sight than that of a young Moslem girl in Mazra Kalantar standing over a litter of two week-old puppies, and suddenly kicking one as hard as she could with her shod foot. The puppy screamed with pain, but at my angry intervention she merely said, blankly, ‘But it&rsquo;s unclean&rsquo;. In Sharifabad I was told by distressed Zoroastrian children of worse things—a litter of puppies cut to pieces with a spade-edge, and a dog&rsquo;s head laid open with the same implement; and occasionally the air was made hideous with the cries of some tormented142 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG animal. Such wanton cruelties on the Moslems&rsquo; part added not a little to the tension between the two communities.</p>
<p>Zoroastrian children for their part would cuff and pull dogs about, and men would kick the lane-dogs casually out of the way, but not hard enough to hurt; and in all their dealings with dogs there was an essential kindness and sense of responsibility. It is doctrine that in the good creation the dog ranks next below man; and if there is a ritual act to be performed that requires two persons, and only one is available, he may make paivand or connection&rsquo; with a dog, by holding the animal on à cord, and so do what is needful.</p>
<p>faithfulness and courage and obedience, that he is felt to be able thus to partner man himself, even in the rites of religion.</p>
<p>It accordingly behoves man, as the stronger of the two, to look after this faithful friend, a duty which is enjoined on him in the Avesta.5 In Sharifabad the lane-dogs were fed regularly, and the scriptural injunction was obeyed, that a bitch in whelp has a special claim to be cared for. Wherever a masterless bitch has her puppies, it is the duty of the owner of the land to feed her and them, and according to the Avesta, he should do so until the puppies are grown. When I was in Sharifabad there was a gentle brown bitch in whelp who showed considerable intelligence in presenting herself wherever there was food, either on ceremonial occasions or in the fields, where she would let the children pet her and maul her about while she waited. She was very near her time at the Jašn-e Tir-Mah, when there is a communal observance at the dakhma; and she patiently plodded her way there, heavy as she was, over the desert track. She was exhausted by the heat when she arrived, and flopped weakly down in the shade of the adjacent buildings, lying on her side as if dead. Murvarid Belivani, Paridun&rsquo;s wife, filled the bottom of a broken pitcher with water and held it by her nose. At the smell of water the poor animal managed to struggle over on to her front and lapped the whole bowlful as she lay. By the time a second bowlful was brought she was able to get on her legs to drink it; and soon after she was moving about among the gathering in her usual gentle way, swinging her tail and receiving generous doles of food. She</p>

<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 143 whelped at the dakhma that night, and its guardian, Paridun, took her food when he went there daily to tend the fire.</p>
<p>Such conduct seems understandable, if unusually kind-the working out, according to scriptural injunctions, of the ancient tradition of a people who had once lived by their herds, and had never forgotten their debt to the herd-dog and watch-dog. Yet when one looks into the matter more closely, very unusual features appear in the relationship between Zoroastrians and dogs. Thus it is required, in strict orthodoxy, not merely that one should feed a hungry dog, but that every household should give food to a dog at least once a day. Moreover, the dog should be fed before the family themselves begin to eat. This rule was still observed, in 1964, by D. Khodadad, who had the advantage of owning a house-dog, and was followed, more or less strictly, by most of the villagers. The standard portion for a dog was bread broken into three pieces; and whenever a group of Zoroastrians ate in the fields—as at harvest time, or the end of the cotton-sowing-a dog would join them, and receive this dole before they themselves ate. Moreover, many families fed one of the lane-dogs regularly once a day, before the evening meal; and at least one woman whom I knew set aside for this purpose a little of everything which she had cooked during the day.?</p>
<p>The most remarkable feature of this custom is that precedence was yielded to the dog. It was not at all a matter of giving a dog scraps and left-overs. It was to be fed first, with clean food untouched by anyone. For a poor rural community thus handsomely to support unproductive animals is remarkable; and the practice at religious ceremonies was even more striking, for then a complete &lsquo;meal for the dog&rsquo; (com-e $wa) was prepared from the consecrated food, either by the priest or by one of the family concerned, and this had to be given to a dog before the worshippers received their share of food and partook together of the communion meal. The manner of preparing the com-e šwa was as follows: three pieces of consecrated bread were dipped into the consecrated water, and laid at the bottom of a ritually pure metal bowl. Then a bit of every kind of food that had been blessed during the service was put into this bowl, together with other bits of bread which had been dipped into the liquid offerings</p>
<p>? Namely Shirin, the wife of Erdeshir Qudusi.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>144 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG (the wine, milk, and sir-o-sedow). A roasted egg, shell and all, was added, and the bowl was topped off with more bread. One of the family, being in a state of ritual purity, and shod, then took the bowl to a dog. If the service had been attended by a large con gregation, this had usually alerted at least one of the lane-dogs, who would be waiting hopefully at the house-door; but sometimes, especially at high festivals, when there were observances in many families, one had to go in search of a dog. There was a standard village call, Gudü, gudū, biyū, biyū &lsquo;Doggy, doggy, come, come!&rsquo;, which nearly always resulted in some hungry animal bounding eagerly up. The food was then placed on the ground before him, and while he ate, its bearer prayed in Avestan, uttering one Ahunvar and one Ašəm vohu. The village dogs were not in the least fussy over food, and happily crunched down the egg-shell, and swallowed the highly seasoned sir-0-sedow, with anything else which might be offered them.</p>
<p>The villagers were sometimes at a loss to explain a traditional observance, but in this case there was no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind. All were clear that the food thus offered to a dog was for the bene fit of a soul—the soul of the founder or beneficiary of the religious ceremony. And this was why the com-e šwa was set aside before the congregation received its share of the consecrated food, the dead being thus given due precedence over the living. This was also the explanation of why food should always be given to a dog before one ate anything oneself, for this act was for the general benefit of the dead of one&rsquo;s own family—though sometimes it too was linked with care for a particular soul. Thus Piruza Sami of Mazrat Kalantar gave six pieces of bread to a dog each evening before sunset: three pieces, she explained to me, were on behalf of her dead husband, and three on behalf of her dead daughter. She and others who gave a daily dole to a dog did so at sunset because it is the time just after the sun has gone down which belongs particularly to the fravašis the souls of the dead.10</p>
<p>Thus in traditional Zoroastrianism a dog was regarded as being able to act somehow as intermediary between the living and the</p>

<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 145 dead. That this belief was once generally held throughout the com munity is shown by the fact that exactly the same usages prevailed&mdash; and in a measure still prevail-among the Parsis.&rdquo; Plainly such a belief, originating presumably in the remotest past, is not suscep tible of any easy explanation; and in seeking to understand it one has to take account also of the doctrine that a dog can by his gaze drive off demons and put pollution to flight. (We have already met a dog being used for this purpose in the barašnom purification) How this doctrine itself arose must be a matter for surmise; but the ancient Iranians tended to group together the evils that afiicted them, seeing them all as created by Ahriman for their vexation, and since the_dog, man&rsquo;s faithful ally, could defend him against visible dangers, such as wild beasts, it may have been thought, on analogy, that he could also help him by warding off the invisible attacks of hostile spirits. A factor in encouraging this belief may well have been a dog&rsquo;s habit of gazing unwaveringly at times into what seems empty space, as if seeing things invisible to his human con panions; and indeed the Moslem villagers of Iran, however hostile to the dog, still say that this creature can see little shaitāns lurking in the corners of rooms.I2</p>
<p>Further, there are Indo-Iranian-possibly even Indo-European myths which connect spirit-dogs with death. The Vedas know two hounds, the messengers of Yama, who hunt out those who are to die, and accompany their spirits into the hereafter; and according to the Avesta two dogs await the spirits of the dead at the Cinvat Bridge, which all must try to cross. 13 Here, Zoroastrians believe, both good and evil powers gather, each hoping to gain the soul; and whatever the original myth may have been, they naturally regard the spirit dogs as beneficent, there to protect the soul, before judgement, from the prowling powers of darkness. This may well have been another factor in fostering the belief that a mortal dog could in the same</p>
<p>146 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG way protect the soul from evil forces while it still dwelt on earth.14</p>
<p>There is thus an ancient link between dogs and death. There is also the fact that the Indo-Iranians regularly made food-offerings to the dead, a practice maintained by both Zoroastrians and Brah mans to this day. This usage is clearly connected with the age-old belief, probably once common to all the Indo-European peoples, that the general fate in the hereafter was to pass to a kingdom of the dead beneath the earth, where the departed lived as shades, ex periencing neither grief nor joy, and dependent on the bounty of their descendants for what little comfort they could know.1s Food offerings for the dead were laid on the ground, as the gateway to their abode. The spirits were duly summoned to receive them; and in Indian ritual texts it is said that, as these spirits perceive and enjoy the odours of the hot food, they absorb its essence, so that it gradually grows cold.16 Thereafter it would be perilous for men to eat this food, the leavings of the potentially dangerous dead, and so the sacrificer is bidden to cast it away. In living Brahman usage it is thrown to the crows;17 but evidently in Iran the custom developed of giving it to dogs to eat, for they, with their power over demons and the dead, could come to no harm thereby. This usage may well be purely Zoroastrian, for not only is there no parallel to it among the Brahmans, but it has a practical aspect which accords well with the admonitions of the Good Religion against waste, for herd-dogs and watch-dogs must be fed, and so piety and thrift could be conjoined. What thus developed presumably as one safe and sensible means of disposing of the hazardous offerings to the dead came in time to be regarded as the only permissible way of doing so.</p>
<p>Already, however, in Indo-Iranian times a hope, it seems, had been born that the strong and powerful in the community, that is,</p>
<p>Is For the evidence for this belief among the ancient Iranians see Boyce, History, i. 108 ff.</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 147 the warriors and priests, could attain to a different place in the hereafter, namely to paradise on high, which was not only bright with sunshine but full of all imaginable delights; and Zoroaster taught that this Paradise was within the reach of all—even of women and the poor 8—if only they had lived the good life. In his revelation the dark underworld was transformed partly into a limbo for those who had been neither greatly good nor greatly bad, partly into a hell of torments, ruled over by Ahriman. Zoroastrians naturally always hope that the dear departed will attain to paradise, where they will taste bliss and have no need of any comfort that the living can bestow. Nevertheless, the immemorial custom prevails, with them as with the Brahmans, of providing food for the dead as if all had still gone down to the drear kingdom of shades beneath the earth, there to experience only nothingness.19</p>
<p>Although men shrank from touching food that had been enjoyed by the dead, they were accustomed to sharing devoutly in offerings consecrated to the gods, feeling themselves to be thus in communion with their divine guests. But it is the practice in Zoroastrianism (a practice which is at least as old as the oldest liturgical texts) to summon the fravasis of the dead to be present with the yazads at all religious ceremonies. Hence it came about that on every sacred occasion some of the consecrated food had to be set aside as the portion of the dead, to be given therefore to a dog. This portion always contained such dishes as were specially prepared for the fravašis, notably the symbolic egg; and these dishes must be freshly cooked, so that the spirits could enjoy their savour while the service was in progress. So it was that whenever Zoroastrians solemnized religious rites according to ancient orthodoxy, a dog had to be near at hand. These observances were not in the least mechanical or meaningless for the Yazdi Zoroastrians, who were vividly conscious of the unseen presence at their ceremonies of both divinities and the departed.</p>

<p>sic:</p>
<p>148 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG</p>
<p>The custom of giving food for the dead to a dog is thus likely to have been in origin practical, but with an element in it of the un canny also, because of the beliefs in spirit-dogs, and in the mortal dog&rsquo;s powers over the unseen; and given this uncanny element, and the nature of the usage, it is hardly surprising that the dog should have come in time to be regarded as capable, not merely of consum ing these offerings safely, but also of mysteriously representing the invisible dead-hence the Zoroastrian insistence on &lsquo;respect for the dog&rsquo;. This aspect of the dog&rsquo;s role, though ever-present, appears most clearly in the rites which take place immediately at death and during the first year thereafter. These are in general well known,20 and here it is proposed to touch only on their salient points, mainly in order to describe the beliefs concerning the departed spirit, and to indicate the part played in connection with them by the dog.</p>
<p>If a person was seen to be at the point of death, then the priest was sent for, and he recited a patet or formal confession on behalf of the dying man, and gave him nirang in three ritual administra tions.21 If death came suddenly, the patet was said thereafter; and the nirang was then poured on to bits of bread in a bowl and given to a dog, in the hope that the benefit would reach the departed spirit. When breath was extinct, relatives lifted the body and placed it on a stone slab somewhere within the house, with sand strewn around it, so that the good earth was thoroughly protected; and after this the corpse-demon, in Dari the dröj-nesā, was held to settle on it with all her pollution, and no one touched it again except those professionally appointed to do such work.</p>
<p>Meantime one of the family had gone to the priest with the mes sage &lsquo;The soul of so-and-so is taking the road&rsquo; (vrün pārsang å görən). He carried with him an egg, the symbol of immortality, and the priest roasted this in the embers of a fire while he consecrated a short dron</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 149 service in the name of Sroš, to invoke this yazad&rsquo;s protection for the departed soul. Thereafter the egg, blessed by this service, was given to a dog to eat.</p>
<p>In the old days, when there were many priests, a priest would then come to the house of death, leading a dog; but in the 1960s, of necessity, it was a layman who came, one of known probity, who had done no-swa; and in Sharifabad the family then quit the house, abandoning the area of pollution to those better equipped to deal with it. The priest&rsquo;s proxy administered nirang once more to the newly lifeless body, as a last purification, and performed sagdid, the act whereby the corpse was ritually &lsquo;seen by the dog&rsquo;, so that the pollution became less for those who must handle it. The Irani custom was that three pieces of bread, the basic and traditional portion for the dog, were placed on the breast of the corpse, and by this means the animal was induced to go right up to the body and so exercise its beneficent power against the droj-nesa.22 The dog was then kept close to where the body lay, so that it could continue to act as guardian and protector of the soul, which was held to linger by the corpse&rsquo;s head. For added protection a fire was kept burning within three paces of the body (nearer would be a pollution for the fire); and on it was burnt the root of a plant called bud-e nākoš, whose pungent smell was thought to have special properties against the evil powers, being (so D. Khodadad said) like a bullet fired against demon-foes.23</p>
<p>la Sharifabad one of the salars joined the pakšu, if the deceased were a male, to lay out the body, and while they were at work they made paivand, that is, they were joined by a košti tied round their right wrists, so that the contact might strengthen them against evil. As the woman pakšu had to work alone, she usually made paivand with the dog. (If a woman relative helped in this way, she had to undergo no-šwa thereafter.) The corpse was washed three times with pajow,24 and then clothed from head to foot in white cotton gar ments, which must be clean but used—it is forbidden, as sinful</p>
<p>Unless death had occurred late in the day, or at night, the funeral followed in a few hours. Any adult who wished night attend, man or woman; and with the mourners there gathered at the house those who were to carry the bier. Traditional Zoroastrian funerals are conducted on foot, and since the dakhma was out in the desert, teams of men (four, six, twelve, or even eighteen) were needed for this task. These bearers were drawn from among friends and neigh bours, and it was thought meritorious to help in this way. Like the salars, they dressed wholly in white, with white cloths over their hands; but since they did not touch the shrouded corpse, but only the bier, they did not become seriously unclean, and a simple ablution after the funeral sufficed to purify them again. The white clothes, provided by the Anjoman, were washed after every time of use. (This was done at the Zād-o-Marg Khāna, ‘House of Birth and Death&rsquo;, where too the iron biers were kept, and the salars made their regular ablutions.)</p>
<p>26 Because of the crossing of the legs, the shrouded corpse presented a tri angular shape. This way of laying out the dead is enjoined in the Rivayats (see Unvala, i. 141.8; Dhabhar, 158, with discussion, n. 3). The Parsis tradition ally lay out the corpse with straight legs, and great controversy arose. when the Irani custom was introduced among them in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 151 In Sharifabad the priest recited the funeral service at the house. This consisted, essentially, of the longest group of Zoroaster&rsquo;s own hymns, the Ahunavad Gah, recited in two parts, with a pause after Y. 31.4. When this pause was made, the salars lifted the shrouded body from the stone slab on to an iron bier, to which they tied it with a košti. At the end of the service all who intended to follow the bier said the Avestan prayer to Sroš, and then formed pairs, linked protectively with one another by a košti or a piece of cloth. The bearers too made paivand by a košti. The procession then set off, led by the priest with the dog, the bier being carried several paces behind these two. It was followed by the relief bearers, and then, at a respectful distance, by the double line of mourners. When the bearers changed over, they shifted the bier from shoulder to shoulder without setting it down on the good earth; and they must never glance behind them, but must keep their eyes steadily on the way ahead. They and the mourners walked in complete silence, for they had said the Avestan prayer to Sroš, and to speak would break its power,</p>
<p>The procession made its way slowly along the field-paths and over the desert track which led to the dakhma. Once there, the bearers set the bier down and withdrew thirty paces. The salars placed the body on a stone slab, and the priest recited yet again a confession on behalf of the soul, and said some other prayers. The salars then transferred the body to a lighter iron bier, which was kept inside the tower. The dog performed the third and last sagdid, and the priest recited the ancient formula of authorization for committing the body to the dakhma. The mourners uttered a last prayer together (which being in Avestan did not break the power of the Sroš Baj), and then the salars carried the body through the high, small door into the tower, and those outside saw no more.</p>
<p>Within the tower the salars laid the body down on the stones, and used the scissors set in the shroud to slit the cloth open a little way;27 and they said words to comfort the soul,28 which was believed</p>
<p>27 Parsi usage is that the corpse-bearers strip the body, casting the torn clothes into the central pit of the tower (see Modi, CC, 66). To expose the dead naked is undoubtedly the ancient custom, which was presumably abandoned in Iran some time after the ninth century, because of the impossibility of preventing Moslems breaking into the places of exposure. (Jackson, Persia past and present, 392–3, writes of the removal of the clothes; but his informant, who had been in Bombay, was undoubtedly in this respect describing Parsi usage.)</p>
<p>28 See Jackson, op. cit. 393.</p>
<p>152 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG during the three days after death to linger near both where the body lies and where it has lain&ndash;that is, at the dakhma and at its old home: &lsquo;Fear not and tremble not, O such an one&rsquo; (they said) ‘it is the place of your ancestors, and of cour] fathers and mothers and of the pure and good, for a thousand years.&rsquo; And they committed it to the special care of the divinities who would judge it at the end of the three days: &lsquo;O Mihr Ized, Sroš Ized, Rašn Ized, the pure and just! We have withdrawn our hands from him, do you take him by the hand &hellip;&rsquo;. These utterances were said in archaic Persian; and after some brief Avestan prayers the salars then withdrew respect fully backwards from the presence of the unseen spirit, and closed the dakhma door upon it.</p>
<p>When the funeral was over, the family returned again to the house which they had left; and for the next three days, while the soul was thought to linger on earth, they did everything which they could to comfort and help it. A little oil lamp was kept burning continuously near the place where the corpse&rsquo;s head had rested. This was sheltered in a tiny open-sided ‘house&rsquo; made of four mud-bricks; and just in front of it a pair of open scissors was thrust, points downward, into the earthen floor, and something made of iron or steel was put on the stone slab (a metal chain or the long-handled metal bara). The villagers said that this was done so that &rsquo;the soul might not be lonely&rsquo;; but the practice presumably represents the age-old belief in the power of iron and steel to ward off evil. Human vigil was also kept continually at the place, by a man for a man, a woman for a woman, and the watcher maintained a quiet murmur of Avestan prayers. Religious services were solemnized elsewhere each day by the priest, and he came to the house each afternoon to celebrate an Afrinagan and to say a confession for the soul&rsquo;s sake. The family moreover said a prayer—the Sroš Yašt sar-e šabeach evening at the beginning of the fourth watch, just as the stars began to show, since this time belongs especially to the spirits of the dead, who may help to protect the lonely, newly departed soul. This and all other prayers uttered during the first year after death ended with the words az jāde-ye ašā ravān &hellip; be-rasād &lsquo;May it reach the path of the blessed soul. Further, each night during the fifth watch, from midnight until dawn, the priest solemnized the long night-office of the Vendidad, to help drive away the powers of evil, this being, D. Khodadad said, a strong aid to the soul, like clothes to a naked man.29</p>
<p>29 It was impossible for D. Khodadad, placed as he was, to solemnize the</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 153 As well as praying, and procuring prayers to be said, the family also offered the departed soul all the material comfort that they could. Thus during this period ordinary food, such as the dead per son enjoyed, was prepared with ritual cleanliness three times a day, and given, with Avestan prayers, to a dog. Any dog would do; but one of the lane-dogs was often brought in and chained in the yard for the three days, an alteration in its life which an old dog accepted gratefully, an inexperienced youngster with a touch of anxiety.30 It was desirable that whoever gave the food to the dog should be closely connected with the deceased, by blood or marriage, and he or she must be in a state of ritual purity, and must always be shod, for the old religious rules (usually ignored through the habit of poverty) forbade Zoroastrians to set bare foot upon the ground. If it was a baby that had died, then bread soaked in warm milk was given. In no case did the dog receive meat during this time, for none was eaten during the three days of mourning. (Such particular abstinence is the nearest that Zoroastrians come to fasting, which they disapprove of as an activity that weakens the good body created by Obrmazd, and saps the power and will to contend with evil.) Meanwhile, out at the dakhma the dakhmaban would be keeping the fire there blazing brightly all through the three nights, and would put bud-e nakoš on it, to comfort and aid the soul.</p>
<p>On the third day after death, preparations began for receiving the divinities who would be concerned with the soul&rsquo;s fate as it left the earth. House and lane were swept with the greatest care, and incense was carried through the rooms; and in the late afternoon priest and mourners gathered at the house to solemnize the Yašt-e sevvom or &lsquo;Service of the third day&rsquo; 3! At this the priest led the company in Vendidad service in its entirety, but he read portions of the book in the course of an abbreviated Yasna ceremony, celebrated necessarily without the help of a serving priest.</p>
<p>30 Similarly in Navsari it was still the custom in the 1970s to tie up a dog (brought for the purpose by one of the nasa-salars) on the house-veranda during the three days after death, to receive this food (information from Dr. Firoze M. Kotwal).</p>
<p>31 The Parsis call the seyyom service uthamna, the &rsquo;last&rsquo; ceremony, i.e. of the daylight ceremonies of the three days. They also, however, use the same term for the service held at dawn of the fourth day, which the Iranis call cărom. Tradi tionally for the Parsis it is the uthamna of the third day which is of the greater importance, and in Kerman similarly more weight is laid on seyvom than on čarom, whereas in the Yazdi region it is the other way about. This may be one of the several ways in which the Parsis and Kermanis preserve an eastern (Khorasani?) tradition against the western one of Pars.</p>
<p>154 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG. praying for the soul. The prayers said were, essentially, those proper to the afternoon watch, but each one was spoken twice, once on the mourner&rsquo;s own behalf, and once for the departed soul; and they were followed by a confessional. The last prayer was said as the sun was setting, and the dahmobed then distributed to all those present consecrated food, consisting of small flat rounds of bread (luwok) with chopped-up eggs and herbs, which were eaten in communion. As the mourners left they expressed their grief and sympathy with the family; but as far as possible the bereaved held tears in check even a young mother or widow-for since sorrow belongs to the devil, Zoroastrians try to bridle it as much as possible.</p>
<p>During the last watch of the third day, usually at about one or two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, another service was celebrated at the house, namely the Yašt-e savgire or Service of the night-watch&rsquo;. During this a length of cloth, called in Sharifabad the &lsquo;sedra&rsquo;, 32 was blessed to provide a spirit-garment for the soul in the hereafter. The provision of clothes, like that of food, for the departed is a custom which evidently goes back to the remotest past, being similarly linked with the belief in a deprived and comfortless hereafter.53 The cloth was of undyed cotton, spun and woven at home, and an old woman would often weave enough for her own and her husband&rsquo;s sedra, and keep the roll by her ready for use.34 The cloth was sent to the priest to be washed by him before the ceremony in running water. 35</p>
<p>32 Elsewhere in Iran it was called šavgire (by transference from the name of the service), and the Parsis know it as shiav (see Modi, CC, 81). The Sharifabadis in daily life usually referred to the sacred shirt as šiv-košti (i.e. &lsquo;[the garment worn) under the sacred girdle&rsquo;).</p>
<p>33 There is a reference to it in Yt. 13.50, in a passage which stems evidently from pre-Zoroastrian times.</p>
<p>34 Thus in the house of Tahmina Khanom&rsquo;s parents the cloth for their sedra, woven by her mother Sultan, hung over a beam in the room behind the pesgam-e mas. The amount of cloth required was 184 zár for a man, 16 for a woman, and 34 for a child (the zar being a rough measure from nose to outstretched finger tips). The custom in the 1960s was for the cloth to be shared between the priest and family. The priest should make a sedra for himself from his share, and part of the merit of the prayers which he said while wearing it then accrued to the departed soul. Or he might give the cloth to the poor, the soul then benefitting from this act of charity. The family used their share for some devout purpose, such as for a cloth (sopra) for setting out food on holy days, or for sedras for themselves.</p>
<p>35 In Tehran tap water was adjudged sufficiently clean for this purpose (although this was one of the things, like eating bought bread, which made the strictly orthodox of the villages uneasy about going to live there). Once when I visited the Ataš Bahram in Tehran cloth for a sedra, dewly washed by the priests, was drying across chairs in the main hall.</p>

<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 135 It was then blessed during the service together with a newly woven košti, and a piece of silver, either a coin or ring. This last item is known only in the Zoroastrian usage of Iran, not of India, and i: seems possible that it derives (perhaps since the Seleucid period) from the Greek custom of burying the dead with a coin for Charon. 36 The family also provided for the service not the one egg usually blessed for a departing soul, but thirty-three, said to be for the ancestors, up to thirty-three generations back, who would come that night to support their descendant before his hour of trial.37</p>
<p>The service itself, which lasts about an hour, consisted of four short Yašt-e dron, solemnized one after the other, and dedicated first to Sroš, who cares for the spirit during the three days on earth; then to Rašn, who will hold the scales of justice at its trial, together with Aštad, the hypostasis of justice itself; then to the great company of the righteous dead, the fravašis; and finally to the yazad of the wind and spaces of the sky, Vāy, through whose realm the spirit must mouat up at the next dawn.</p>
<p>Just before the sun rose on the fourth day the mourners assembled again at the house for the Yašt-e čārom, &lsquo;Service of the fourth day&rsquo;. They each said the košti-prayers twice, once for themselves and once for the departing soul, and were led in other prayers by the priest. The atašband then asked each person present to declare how many prayers he was prepared to say privately for the soul&rsquo;s sake during the next ten days, and the grand total of these was announced to the gathering. 38 It was at this moment too that, if the dead man</p>

<p>33 An alternative explanation proferred was that they were for the thirty-three major yazads (who are in fact thirty in number, since four of the thirty days of the month are dedicated to Ohrmazd, but which are accounted as thirty three, as if these four days were devoted to four distinct divinities). Formerly eggs from the little local hens were plentiful, even in poor houses, but if enough eggs could not be bad, the number might be made up with walnuts. As with the cloth, the eggs were divided after the service between the priest and family, and the family used theirs for the food that was distributed among the mourners.</p>
<p>38 This is another task which elsewhere in the Yazdi region would be performed rather by the dahmobed (see above, p. 28). As well as the prayers, charitable acts were sometimes announced to be undertaken for the soul&rsquo;s sake; and in India, as the Parsis grew wealthy, immense benefactions were at times promised</p>
<p>156 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG had left no son and heir, one was formally appointed, so that he might perform all the soul-ceremonies for him in the months and years to come. This appointed heir was called the pol-gozâr, the &lsquo;bringer over the Bridge&rsquo;, for the ceremonies which he was to perform were thought to help the soul to cross the Bridge to heaven. It was held that to name the pol-gozar before sunrise on the fourth day was to satisfy the soul on this vital matter just before it quitted the earth.39</p>
<p>None of these activities can be logically reconciled with Zoroaster&rsquo;s fundamental teaching that each man must achieve his own salva tion, and that the only way to do so is through good thoughts, words, and acts. However, among good acts the prophet clearly included the rites of worship, and it was natural human weakness which led his followers to extend this to acts of worship performed after death-that is to say, they reverted in this to age-old pious practices, while holding firmly to the essential doctrines of their new faith. Parallel developments can be traced in the history of all the higher religions. Attempts were made in due course by theologians to reconcile doctrine with practice, in that they said that rites per formed after death only helped the soul if they had been wanted and intended by the departed while he lived, so that they represented, as it were, a working-out of his own good thought;40 but naturally, regardless of this, the ceremonies were performed for all alike, in by the family at the uthamna. For a more detailed account of the Irani ceremony see Khodayar D. Sheriar, &lsquo;The funeral ceremonies of the Zoroastrians in Persia&rsquo;,</p>
<p>Sir J. J. Madressa Jubilee Vol., ed. Modi, 312–14.</p>
<p>39 Among the Irani Zoroastrians the pol-gozar, following ancient custom, inherits all the dead man&rsquo;s property, with the obligation to provide from it for his widow, if she survives him. He also takes his name in place of that of his natural father. Thus, for example, D. Khodadad&rsquo;s father Shehriar was the second Son of D. Hamavand, a poor, hard-working priest. A well-to-do but childless priest, D. Namdar, died suddenly in an accident, leaving no kin, and so the Dastur dasturan appointed Shehriar to be his pol-gozar, and henceforth he was known as Shehriar-e Namdar, and inherited all the property. D. Khodadad in his tum made his own second son, Shehriar, the pol-gozar of his eldest son Rashid, when the latter died at the age of twenty, so that thereafter he was called Shehriar e Rashid. The Parsis have similar customs, but they abandoned some time ago the right of the pol-gozar (or pălak, as they call him in Gujarati) to inherit the property, and among them he is now simply responsible for the ceremonies. The old custom could be very irksome for a spirited and capable woman who survived her husband; and after the death, in 1960, of Rustam Khodayar Boland of Yazd, his widow, Khorshed-Banu Kayanian, pamed as pol-gozar a myrtle tree at his family home, which thereafter was tended with special care. It was suggested to me by others that this unusual step might have been made on analogy with planting a tree as vagfor yād-būd (a memorial).</p>

<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 157 a spirit of hope and piety-even, that is, for acknowledged sinners, such as suicides (although in their case there was a sorrowfui feeling that the benefit of the rites was unlikely to reach them). The elaborate observances for the dead were yet another way in which Zoroastrianism was deeply satisfying to normal human instincts, in that they provided abundant means for the bereaved to be active and to feel that they were helping their dead, instead of being wholly cut off from them,</p>
<p>The belief was that it was while the mourners were praying to gether before the dawn of the fourth day that the soul began its ascent; and it was held to reach the Bridge, which is also the place of judgement, just as the sun&rsquo;s rays touched the earth. There was a solemn, silent pause therefore at this moment, as the mourners accompanied it in their thoughts to the tribunal of Mihr Ized, the Judge over all. Then as the light increased they turned back to the everyday world, conscious of having given the departed all the aid in their power. The period of ritualized mourning was then over, and this fact was marked by the eating of meat for the first time since the hour of death. One of the undoubtedly ancient rites performed for the dead in traditional Zoroastrianism was the offering of blood sacrifice. Since Zoroastrians do everything which they can in threes, three such sacrifices were made for every adult who died, a practice which in 1964 was still strictly observed in the Yazdi area. The first sacrifice was made on the morning of the third day after death, and the flesh was roasted during the night. The former custom in Sharifabad was that fat from the sacrificial beast, together with a paring from its horn and a scrap of the wool, was pounded up with garlic, rue and bud-e nakoš, and offered by the priest at dawn to the sacred fire as an oblation on the soul&rsquo;s behalf; but Parsi influence was exerted to stop such practices, 41 and what was then done instead was that a candle was made from the rendered fat, with a wick of pure, homespun cotton, and this was set to burn before the Ataš Varahram just before dawn on the fourth day. The meat of the sacrifice was consecrated by the Yašt-e čārom, and was shared between the family and other mourners, the priest, his helpers, and the poor of the village. Formerly the Yašt-e čārom was held at the</p>
<p>41 Yet the first at least of the three sacrifices was made still by Parsis down to the early nineteenth century; and instructions from Navsari to Bombay in 1823 were that the fat from it was to be offered at dawn on the fourth day to a temple fire, together with frankincense or aloe-wood (see &ldquo;Haoma&rsquo;, 77-8).</p>
<p>158 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG dakhma itself, and after sunrise the gathering there became a convi vial one, the food being washed down by an abundance of full-bodied wine-a custom whose passing D. Khodadad recorded with under standable regret. The dog naturally received his ritually appointed share of the sacrificial meat. This included some of the andom, which must also be partaken of by the priest. The andom consisted of pieces of seven inward parts of the animal, representing what in Avestan is called ižā, in Sanskrit idā, that is, the essence of the sacrifice. 42 The dog was also given a hind-foot, but never one of the fore-feet, which are regarded as ritually unclean (as are the head and the blood).</p>
<p>These things were given to the dog on behalf of the soul, in the usual way; but there was a complication in that he also received that portion of every blood-sacrifice wbich is set aside for the yazad Hôm, the Vedic Soma, who was regarded in the common Indo Iranian tradition as priest of the gods, and who was therefore assigned a share of every sacrifice, like a mortal priest. In recent usage his share was only the tongue of the animal, and this the priest roasted while consecrating a Yašt-e dron in honour of Hom Ized, and then gave to a dog.43 In ancient pagan usage the yazad&rsquo;s share was perhaps burnt in the fire, which the Brahmans called the mouth of the gods&rsquo;; but the Zoroastrians&rsquo; reverence for fire prevented them putting anything on it except what was offered to it itself-fuel, in cense, and the zohr of fat. So, it seems, the dog&rsquo;s role was extended, and from representing the invisible dead it came in this single instance to act as proxy also for one of the divine beings themselves.</p>
<p>The dawn of the fourth day saw the end of the regular feeding of a dog three times a day as the dead man&rsquo;s immediate representative; but this usage was continued in modified form for forty days-a favoured length of time for extended observances. During this period three pieces of newly baked bread (or at least unbroken &lsquo;clean&rsquo; bread), together with a roasted egg, salted, were given to a dog each day at the hour of death. One of the lane-dogs quickly learnt what hour this was, and presented itself regularly at the house-door. For a dead child warm milk was substituted for the egg. Agha Rustam bad himself lost a son in infancy, and for forty days his wife Tahmina continued thus giving bread soaked in warm milk to a dog.</p>
<p>42 See in more detail, &lsquo;Ālas-zöhr and Ab-zöhr&rdquo;, 107-8; Boyce, History, i. 163-4. The andom was prepared from the death-sacrifices and at Mihragan, but pot at the gabambars, though even then bits from all the seven parts were in cluded in the com-e swa,</p>

<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 159 If a child were born dead, the Sharifabadi custom was that if it was premature, the mother would herself wash the infant&rsquo;s body in pajow and stitch it into a clean white cloth steeped in the same liquid, for a shroud, leaving a loop of cotton. An iron rod was passed through this loop, and two young boys, if the infant were a boy, or two young girls for a girl, would carry the tiny body to the roof of the lard, and leave it there for the crows. If the child were still-born at the due nine months, then they bad to carry the body all the way to the Kub-e Surkh, the &lsquo;Red Hill&rsquo;, near the mountain shrine of Hrist, three farsakhs from the village. Paridun Rashidi told me how his third son had been still-born in midwinter, and he had had to force his eldest son Rashid and another reluctant boy, both about ten years old, to struggle with the body through snow to the mountain. The youngsters, chilled and unhappy, were ex hausted by the time they reached its foot, and in the end Paridun had himself to carry their small burden up the hillside. This custom seemed exceptionally harsh, since it forced children and grieving relatives to add to their natural distress. Yet though the bodies of the still-born were thus disposed of apart, religious rites were performed for them as for other children, in order (D. Khodadad said) to give strength to the unfledged soul. Naturally there were three sets of rites, with consecration of a sedra, but no blood sacrifice. The first set, with the priest reciting the Dron-e Barsom, the Dron-e Sroš, the Yašt-e Sroš, and such other Avesta as seemed to him appropriate, were solemnized nine months after conception, and the other two as rapidly as possible thereafter, to give the soul their benefit as soon as might be. It was believed that, lacking these rites, the infant&rsquo;s soul must go to hell, whereas, if they were performed, Sroš would care for it. (One can compare the similar Christian beliefs with regard to baptism.) Simplified rites, the concern only of the immediate family, were performed for all who died before reaching maturity, reckoned in traditional manner as fifteen years of age; but for children who had lived, these included the basic observances of the three days, with čarom, siroza, and sal. No Vendidad would be solemnized, however, there was no blood-sacrifice, and the consecrated food was shared among other children—it was held to be wrong to give any to an adult. The ritual portion was always, naturally, prepared for the dog.</p>
<p>The prolongations and elaborations of observances for the dead are evidently ancient, and they had their origins presumably in natural emotions of grief and caring, though one may suspect that</p>

<p>-160 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG they were fostered also by priests not wholly lacking in self-interest. In general an elaborate cult of the dead has been prominent in Zoroastrianism since very early times, and as the Zoroastrian community dwindled in numbers in Iran, the survivors seem to have grown ever more conscious of the great army of their dead, who alone cared for them amid a hostile world. Living as they did where their forefathers had dwelt, the Yazdis were constantly aware of the invisible presence of their ancestors, and were eager to cherish them as much as possible. Since they were Zoroastrians, this was no gloomy matter; rather they tried to create occasions of joy which they and the dead could share, an activity which they called šād ravāni, &lsquo;gladdening the soul. This endeavour extended to feasts held on funerary occasions, so that a stranger, plunged into a village gathering, would have been hard put to it to distinguish between a festival and a funerary feast.44 Indeed one of the merriest assemblies which I was privileged to take part in was held on an occasion of double mourning in the hill-village of Taft. This com bined the sal or first anniversary of the death of the head of a house hold (who had died comparatively young, leaving a youthful second wife with growing children), and the siroza or thirtieth day after the sudden death of one of his sons by his first marriage (who had been only six months wed himself, and who left a girl-widow expecting his child). The grief of the family was deep, and because of the sorrow of the double blow relatives and friends from all over the Yazdi plain exerted themselves to be present and give comfort.45 So a great company gathered and condolences were offered by all to both widows during the day-time ceremonies; but an assembly held in the evening was as gay as possible, with singing, dancing, jesting, story-telling, and the drinking of toasts,46 This may at first sight seem heartless; but in fact this part of the proceedings was felt to be</p>
<p># There is no expression corresponding to sad-ravani in use among the Parsis, who tend to look aşkance at the robustness of the traditional Irani funerary feasts.</p>
<p>+5 I myself attended in company with Shehriar Zohrabi of Mazrar Kalantar and his friend Isfandiar, our host being Agha Dinyar Arghavani, to whom I remain indebted for his kindness in extending warm and gracious hospitality to a stranger on this sad occasion. It was in his house, and thanks to the kindness also of the hušt-mobed, D. Sorush, and his fellow priest, D. Mihraban Rashid Khorsandi, that I was able to be present at a Yašte šavgīre, and also to see for the first time the preparation of the andom.</p>
<p>+6 So large was the company that there were three sittings. Naturally the dignitaries—the two priests, the village school-teacher, and leading elders were at the first, and most of them then withdrew, leaving it to the rest of the company to make merry when the meal was over,</p>
<p>Zh</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 161 for the souls of the dead themselves, who would (it was thought) be distressed to see those whom they had left behind indulging in grief for them, but would be gladdened to see them happy.47 Neither of the widows was obliged to share in the actual merry-making, since both bad much to occupy them in caring for their guests.</p>
<p>It was in general considered meritorious, and a sign of respect for the dead, to attend funerary feasts, and especially these particular ones of şiroza and sal. On these important occasions the two further blood-sacrifices were made, and the religious services of the third night were performed again, with the consecration once more of clothing for the dead. More modest observances, called róza, were maintained at the end of each of the ten months between the siroza and sal. The essential rite on these occasions was the recital, at the house of the deceased, of the Farvardia Yašt, the hymn to All Souls. This, which took from half an hour to a full hour, according to tempo, might be done at any time between sunrise and sunset. By reciting the Avestan text the priest consecrated whatever food had been prepared, which might be quite simple, or consist of all such dishes as the dead person had particularly enjoyed.48 It must always, however, include those items which were essential to the &lsquo;meal for the dog&rsquo;, namely sirog, sir-o-sedow, and an egg.</p>
<p>After the first year, it was thought, the soul was no longer lonely and in need of so many special rites to help and comfort it; but an anniversary ceremony should be held in its honour for thirty. years, roughly the length of a generation, or the time that son or grandson might be expected to live to maintain this observance. By then, it was believed, the soul had become fully one of the frava šis, the great company of the righteous dead; and so it was sufficient thereafter to observe the rites of Farvardigan, the feast of All</p>
<p>47 Quarrelling or disorder of any kind were also held to distress the departed; and Murvarid, Agha Rustan&rsquo;s sister, told me how once Namir Mizanian of Taft (not at the time of the incident a particularly devout man) had been riding home from Yazd when he met two white-clad figures. They declared themselves to be two souls (vpun), driven away from their respective sals (anniversary cere monies) by the quarrelling and undue smoke which filled the houses. So they had &lsquo;flown up on to the roof&rsquo; and away.(Vrun, Murvarid interpolated, are winged, like the fravašis.) The two turned down the track leading to the dakhma of Yazd, and after three paces vanished. A little further along the road Namit met men returning from the sals, who listened to his strange story and agreed that there had been much smoke and wrangling there. (On the subtleties of distioction between &lsquo;fravaši&rsquo; and &lsquo;ravān/vrun* see Boyce, History, i. 117–29.)</p>
<p>48 Unless the deceased had been unusually distinguished, or beloved, the observances naturally tended to become simpler with the passing of the years.</p>

<p>162 DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG Souls, to set aside the &lsquo;meal for the dog&rsquo; after all religious services, and to give clean food daily to a dog.</p>
<p>This daily giving of unconsecrated food to a dog on behalf of the dead is plainly an extension of the original observance, and it is not hard to see how it would have come about. Once the practice was established of giving the consecrated food-offerings for the dead to a dog, then this act, being very frequently performed, must gradually have merged with the ordinary daily feeding of herdand house-dog, and so have led to this being itself regarded as a rite which served the departed. The development was probably a slow one, but may well be very old. It must certainly have been firmly established before the downfall of the Sasanians, in order for it to be maintained by both branches of the Zoroastrian community down into modern times.</p>
<p>Apart from the unique contribution of the dog, the Zoroastrian funerary observances are paralleled with startling closeness by those of ancient India, 49 and so must be supposed to have their origin in the remote past of the Indo-Iranians. The two peoples, it is thought, began to drift apart in the third millennium B.C.; and so these sites, inherited. by Zoroastrians from the pagan past, must have a history of at least five thousand years, and probably immeasurably longer.</p>
<p>One factor which helped to fit the dog for its unusual part in the rituals of the Zoroastrian faith was that, as we have seen, it was regarded as a moral creature, as standing exceptionally high ia the scale of creation. In death, therefore, its body, like that of a righteous man, was regarded as highly polluting, and even to see a dead dog damaged ritual purity, and obliged the orthodox to bathe at once. (Hence it was an easy form of harassment by na-najib Moslems to toss the bodies of dead dogs into Zoroastrian lages.) Ordinarily when a masterless lane-dog died, its death went unnoticed, but this was not so with a house-dog. He, having spent his days in company with the family, was known to be very clean&rsquo;, in addition to his other virtues; and so his death, like that of a person, repre sented a special triumph for the powers of evil, and due rites were necessary in this case also, both to limit the contagion and to help the spirit of the dog itself. The traditional Zoroastrian doctrine was that all creatures which were brought into being by Ohrmazd have a spirit or soul, which endures after death, hence the importance of taking the life of a creature of the good creation only ritually (that is,</p>
<p>19 See Boyce, History, i. 120-1.</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE DOG 163 in sacrifice), whereby the consecrated spirit was not harmed; but it was only for the faithful house-dog that further efforts were made to help his spirit to reach heaven. When he died, it was as when a human dies: one of the family went to the priest carrying an egg, with the traditional message &lsquo;The soul is taking the road&rsquo;, and the priest solemnized the Dron-e Šroš as for a human soul, but with only thiee twigs of barsom in his hand, instead of the five required for a layman and seven for a priest.50 The body was carried away to a barren place, with an old sedra or sacred shirt for shroud, tied with a košti; and brief rituals were performed thereafter on the fourth day at dawn, and on the thirtieth day and the first anniversary. The Zoroastrian thus rewarded his dog&rsquo;s faithfulness with an equal loyalty, even after death. Loyalty is one of the greatest virtues for Zoroastrians, and it is partly because the dog is haqq-šenās, ac knowledging obligations towards those who feed him, that they esteemed him so highly (contrasting him in this with the cat, which they regarded as a typically Moslem animal, treacherous and selfish, now all blandishments and now suddenly scratching and biting the hand that caressed it) 51 So we return to the fact that the Zoroastrian regard for the dog is in part rational, being in fact shared by large sections of humanity. But this rational regard is blended with a large element also of the mysterious, connected with im mensely ancient beliefs about the nature of evil and the fate of the soul in the hereafter.</p>
<p>50 There was firm agreement on these observances both among the priests of Yazd (all of whom had kept dogs in their time), and among the older generation of laymen in both Sharifabad and Mazrar Kalantar.</p>
<p>51 The two animals, dog and cat, having been championed by the two com munities, it was natural that the Zoroastrians should contrast the dog&rsquo;s virtues with the cat&rsquo;s failings. They firmly declared, moreover, that it was the cat, a creature of darkness, which was unclean. If one of a cat&rsquo;s whiskers touched food, D. Khodadad stated, anyone who ate that food would waste away; and a bowl from which a cat had eaten remained unclean after seven washings. Especial care was taken not to let a cat into the room where a dead person lay, for its glance would, in contrast to the sagdid, allow demons to enter the body. No Zoroastrians kept cats in Sharifabad, but &lsquo;Moslem&rsquo; cats sometimes slipped into Zoroastrian houses after dark in search of food, and if they were seen something would be flung at them. This was the only active wokindness shown to them. There was never any question of seeking them out to tormeat them, Orthodox Parsis share the Irani dislike of cats, and have as a rule do dealings with them. Yet such traditions are sometimes broken, and just as a Moslem family will sometimes keep a pet dog, so, accompanying the servants of Arbab Faridun Kayapian when they took yad-bud to the poor in Yazd, I met an old, bedridden Zoroastrian who lived alone, and had for his constant companion a magnificent long-haired cat, which sat sedately on the floor by his pillow.</p>
