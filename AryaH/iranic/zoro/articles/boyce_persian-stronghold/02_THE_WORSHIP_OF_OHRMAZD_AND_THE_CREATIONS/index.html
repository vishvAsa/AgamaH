ZOROASTER is the only founder of a great revealed religion who was a priest; and as such he clearly knew the value of observance, and therefore provided his followers with firm guidance for their devo tional lives. He himself, so the tradition says, was the author of the greatest of the Zoroastrian prayers, the Ahuna vairyo or Ahunvar, a brief utterance in honour of Ahura Mazda which is for the Zoro astrian what the Lord’s Prayer is for the Christian. It is the first prayer that is taught to a child. It is uttered at every act of worship, public or private, and because of its sanctity it can be used in all vicissitudes, and (if repeated a prescribed number of times) may at need replace all other devotions. Thus some of the older Sharifabadi women could not read and knew little Avestan by heart; and for certain religious exercises they made themselves rosaries on which they could tell the number of Ahunvars as they recited them.">

<p>ZOROASTER is the only founder of a great revealed religion who was a priest; and as such he clearly knew the value of observance, and therefore provided his followers with firm guidance for their devo tional lives. He himself, so the tradition says, was the author of the greatest of the Zoroastrian prayers, the Ahuna vairyo or Ahunvar, a brief utterance in honour of Ahura Mazda which is for the Zoro astrian what the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer is for the Christian. It is the first prayer that is taught to a child. It is uttered at every act of worship, public or private, and because of its sanctity it can be used in all vicissitudes, and (if repeated a prescribed number of times) may at need replace all other devotions. Thus some of the older Sharifabadi women could not read and knew little Avestan by heart; and for certain religious exercises they made themselves rosaries on which they could tell the number of Ahunvars as they recited them.</p>
<p>As for times of private prayer, it was ordained that the Zoroastrian should pray once during each of the five watches of the twenty four-hour day-an invaluable religious exercise which Muhammad adopted from Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians pray standing, and, as en joined by their prophet, in the presence of fire-that is, either facing the sun, or before a hearth-fire or temple-fire, or a lighted lamp so that this may help them to fix their thoughts on righteousness. Every time that a Zoroastrian prays, he unties and reties the sacred cord, the ‘košti&rsquo;, which he wears round his waist, so that the Iranis call this basic act of worship &lsquo;making new the sacred cord&rsquo; (košti no kartwun). The words spoken then are addressed to Ohrmazd the Lord, and include an execration of Ahriman.</p>
<p>The essential prayers for each watch take only some five minutes or so to say, once thoroughly learnt. Nevertheless, to say them</p>
<p>TE</p>
<p>30 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS regularly five times a day is an exacting discipline, although it is not necessary for the laity to break the night&rsquo;s sleep to do so. The usual custom (followed also by Moslems) is to recite the prayers of the third watch just before sunset, make a pause as the sun goes down, and then say those of the fourth watch, which has then just begun. The devout get up before dawn to say the prayers of the fifth watch, and when the sun has risen they welcome the new day with the prayers of its first watch. The five obligatory prayers can thus be said in three groups, the third time of prayer being during the noontide watch. The custom of the twofold dawn and sunrise prayers conflicts, however, with another religious duty, for Zoro astrians hold that each new day should be welcomed, not only with godly thoughts and words, but also with cleanliness and order. So another custom, strictly observed in Sharifabad, was that the women got up at first light to sweep and dust and tidy; and they finished their work, as the sun came up, by carrying round the house a small panful of embers from the hearth-fire on which they scat tered dried marjoram leaves to give out a pleasant fragrance. Finally, the pan was set outside the house-door, so that the lanes of the Zoroastrian quarter were full of sweet scents to greet the rising sun.If all this was done, it was believed, the yazad Sroš would visit the house with his benign presence, and the day begin auspiciously,</p>
<p>Women could not do all this work between dawn and sunrise and also say two sets of prayers; but the priests of old declared that, although a man has the duty to pray, a woman&rsquo;s best act of devotion is the work of her hands, as she serves father, husband, or son. In the Belivani household in 1964 the boys were still too young to have put on the sacred cord, and so Agha Rustam prayed alone on behalf of the whole household each morning, his deep voice filling the small courtyard with sonorous Avestan as he stood facing east, where the sun came up over the mountains. In general, even in devout Sharifabad, the full number of five daily prayers was said only on holy days and during pilgrimages, and otherwise most men were content, on working days, to say either the morning or evening prayers; but in this duty I never knew Agha Rustam to fail, whether he slept under his own or another&rsquo;s roof.</p>
<p>The other regular act of devotion incumbent on Zoroastrians was keeping seven annual feasts of obligation. Tradition has it that these</p>

<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 31 feasts were founded by the prophet himself, and they are therefore of the greatest holiness, so that to neglect them is a sin which &lsquo;goes to the Bridge which weighs, that is, among one&rsquo;s evil deeds at the day of judgement. Records (beginning from Sasanian times) show that these seven feasts have been kept devoutly and generally by rich and poor, in good times and in bad, down the centuries, and 1964 in Sharifabad saw no slackening in the ancient observances. Despite the tradition that these holy days were founded by Zoroaster, their Avestan names suggest a remote pagan origin: they appear to have begun, that is, as festivals to celebrate the seasons of mid spring, mid summer, and mid winter, harvest, and the return of cattle from summer pastures, the annual visitation of All Souls, and New Year&rsquo;s Day. But Zoroaster, it seems, drew together this diversity of feasts to form a uniform chain of six, which he refounded to celebrate the six creations, with the seventh, New Year&rsquo;s Day, held to honour the seventh creation of fire. The six were called collectively in Avestan the &rsquo;times of the year (yāirya ratavo), and were known in Middle Persian as &lsquo;gāhānbār&rsquo;, reduced in current speech to &lsquo;gahāmbār&rsquo;, &lsquo;ga&rsquo;āmbār&rsquo;, or &lsquo;gāmbār&rsquo;. The first of them, Mid-Spring (Maidhyõi.zarama), celebrated the first creation, sky; and so on through the year, with homage paid to water, earth, plants, and cattle successively, until the sixth feast, that of Hamaspathmaēdaya, kept originally on the last day of the year, commemorated the crea tion of man. The correspondences in this way of the six gahambars and the six creations are set out in detail and with great clarity ia the Pahlavi books. The seventh feast, No Rūz, which honours fire, celebrated the creation which brought life and energy to all the rest. The first five gahambars were kept with uniform observances, but the sixth one and No Ruz both had their special rites. At all gahambars the religious services are devoted to Ohrmazd himself, as the Supreme Creator.</p>
<p>Originally each of the gahambars, like No Ruz, lasted for a single day; but at the beginning of the Sasanian period a major calendar change, imposed, it seems, by the power of the Persian throne, brought confusion to the Zoroastrian community, which resulted in the keeping of what were thought to be the old and new feast days, four days apart. After a generation or two had lived with this state of affairs, the difficulty was solved by linking each pair of days together, thus forming continuous six-day festivals. This practice</p>

<p>32 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS lasted for several hundred years; but eventually, some time after the tenth century, a day was lopped off each (to bring them all into accord with the festival of the five intercalary days, instituted at the calendar change); and since then they have been kept in this way.</p>
<p>The six gahambars, it was enjoined, were to be times of worship and joy; and only necessary work should be done then. This in junction would obviously have been easier to keep when each feast lasted for only a day; and in a farming community a good deal of necessary work had to go on during the extended festivals, such as ploughing, sowing, and irrigating, hay-making and harvest, as well as caring for stock. To do work which was not essential was regarded, however, as a sin; and so boys enjoyed a happy break from such irksome tasks as weeding in the fields, and women and girls aban doned spindle and loom, which otherwise were seldom idle. The Zoroastrian calendar does not know the Semitic division into weeks, and provides no regularly recurrent rest-day. The five-day festivals thus provided welcome and well-eamed breaks in routine. (It is a major factor in the weakening of traditional Zoroastrianism in the towas that there, as a minority, the Zoroastrians have to accept the Moslem pattern of a Friday holiday, and cannot, if they work for others, get time off to keep their own holy days.)</p>
<p>There are a number of other five-day festivals in the Zoroastrian year whose observance is meritorious, but not obligatory; but the gahambars were sharply distinguished from them, not only because of their greater sanctity, but also because, on account of this, they alone were regularly endowed. Since to keep them was of the greatest merit, it was held to benefit the soul if a man set aside a piece of property—a house, or a field, or rights over water-to found an annual celebration on one of the gahambar days; and so piously was this carried out that in an old and orthodox village like Sharif abad not a single one of the thirty gahambar days lacked its endowed observances. This custom of making pious foundations is un</p>
<p>times, if not earlier, although the first clear evidence of it comes from the Sasanian period. Zoroastrian usages of this kind, it is held, provided the model for the Islamic institution of vagf or charitable bequests;4 and the Zoroastrian practice itself continues with regard to gabambars down to the present day. It even received an added</p>

<p>N-RE</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 33 impetus in Moslem times because of a particularly harsh law, which provided that if one member of a Zoroastrian family embraced Islam, then he inherited everything and his brethren were left penni less. This was undoubtedly a powerful incentive to adopt Islam; but by one of the odd anomalies which characterized the dealings of the authorities with Zoroastrians, if a pious bequest by one of the old religion were duly set down and registered, then this was respected, and the endowment could not be alienated even in favour of a convert. Plainly where Zoroastrian communities dwindled and grew weak, such trusts were ignored and swallowed up; but where they remained in reasonable strength, as in the Yazdi area, it was possible to maintain these bequests. Piety and prudence united, therefore, to encourage their foundation. The local Moslems claim indeed that, on the scale in which it was done, the practice was unfair to the children, depriving them of their inheritance; but the way it worked was that a member of the family was nominated as trustee of the en dowment, and he cultivated the fields or lived in the house, setting aside a portion of the crops or a certain sum of money, as if ia rent, for the annual celebration of the gabambar. Admittedly his livelihood was thus diminished to a fixed extent, but at least it was assured. Endowments were distributed as far as possible among different branches of a family, in the interests of fairness; and since all the extended family joined together in preparing for and celebrating the gahambar itself, this was an excellent means of furthering soli darity among them. Hence it is said, in a Zoroastrian text; &lsquo;Everyone who has founded a gahambar has rejoiced the souls of his ancestors for seventy generations.&rsquo;s The direct forebears of Agha Rustam Belivani, back to seven generations, all founded gahambars, whose trusts are distributed among seven branches of the extended family. Until recently members of all seven lived in Sharifabad, but three are no longer represented there (their members having all removed to</p>
<p>Tehran).</p>
<p>There is no longer any need to found gahanbars to secure in heritances; indeed, such efforts have been made under the present dynasty to treat Zoroastrians fairly that it is now possible, if the local Anjoman acts energetically, to maintain an endowment even if the heirs have become Moslems and wish to alienate it. Thus the Sharifabadi Anjoman administers one gahambar fund on behalf of a Moslem family in the village, the celebration itself being carried</p>

<p>34 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS out, as a pious duty, in Agha Rustam&rsquo;s house. In this case the endow ment was made three generations ago. The founder&rsquo;s son was a reluctant convert to Islam, and was glad to have the observances continued, but the grandson was a Moslem by upbringing and con viction, and would willingly have made an end of them, had the law permitted. Although the founding of gahambars thus no longer served a worldly purpose, piety ensured the continuance of the practice. A new one was inaugurated in Sharifabad in 1963 by Rashid Shirmardi, who worked in the Yazdi administration, and who endowed this gahambar for the souls of his father and mother, who had died in poverty some twenty and ten years earlier re spectively; and in 1970 Agha Rustam himself endowed one jointly with his wife Tahmina, thus adding an eighth generation to the family chain.</p>
<p>At each gahambar ceremony the names of the founder and his forebears were remembered both at the religious services and at the social gatherings, and this again was a strong aid to family tradition. When a new foundation was instituted, the first religious service was solemnized at the fire-temple; but thereafter it was customary to hold the service at the founder&rsquo;s house, both during his life and after his death—for it was believed that his soul would return to share in the observance and enjoy the offerings together with the divine beings. Hence there was a great reluctance among the orthodox to sell a family house, especially to non-Zoroastrians, though economic pressure sometimes made this necessary; and about ten houses in Sharifabad stood empty in 1964, with the owners either themselves returning annually to celebrate the family festivals there, or entrusting relatives still living in the village to do so. Simi larly D. Khodadad owned a fine bouse in the priest&rsquo;s quarter of Yazd, which was deserted except for the annual celebration there of a</p>
<p>gahambar,</p>
<p>The purposes of a gahambar endowment are to provide both for religious services and for social gatherings, where people would come together in loving kindness and share the food which had been blessed at these services. The technical term for this food was čāšni, &rsquo;that which is tasted&rsquo;; and to partake of it, it was believed, was to receive spiritual and physical strengthening. It is also called yād-būd, i.e. that which is eaten in remembrance (yad) of the de parted. Some of this food was always sent to members of the family who could not be present at the service, and to the sick and bedridden</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 35 in the village, but all who were able were expected to come to share with their fellows in the rites of the festival. If a gahambar were given by a man with whom one had quarrelled, it was one&rsquo;s religious duty to forget the bitterness and accept his hospitality. It was further said that every member of the community ought to found a gahambar; and if he had not the means to establish an annual observance, then he should endow one to be celebrated every second, fourth, or even eighth year. If he could not do even this much, then he should give his services to help at another&rsquo;s gahambar; and above all he must not fail in attendance, so that he could contribute his good will and prayers. As it is said in the Rivayats: &lsquo;If one who is poor does not resort to the place where the gahambar is celebrated, this is so great a sin that it is not proper for those who tie the košti to associate with him, or to enter his house, or to bring him to their homes, or to aid him, or to accept his testimony'6 Agha Rustam said further that if work kept one unavoidably away (as at lambing time or when crops must be irrigated), then one should take pains to go past the gahambar house and put a stone on its roof, as a sign that one partici pated in spirit. It was characteristic of Sharifabad that still in 1964 the villagers not only accepted this duty of communal observance, but carried it out eagerly and joyously, whereas in other places an indiffer ence was even then often shown to all but a family&rsquo;s own ceremonies.</p>
<p>Since Sasanian times, the chief religious ceremony proper to the gahambars has been the Yašt-e Visperad, this is, the &lsquo;Service of All the Masters&rsquo;, which is dedicated above all to Ohrmazd, the supreme Master. This is a long, intricate act of worship, which should be performed within a ritual precinct by at least two priests, between sunrise and noon. In 1964 it was still so celebrated six times a year at the chief fire-temple of Yazd, on the first day of each gahambar festival, on behalf of the whole community;? but in Sharifabad itself, as in other villages, the only services which could then be performed were the short Yašt-e dron consecrated early in the morn ing by the priest, usually in his own house, and the Afrīdagan-e Gahāmbār with associated short acts of praise and thanksgiving, 8</p>

<p>Afrin-e Gaharnbar. In the Rivayat of Kamdin Shapur it is said that the liturgy should consist of two Afrinagan-e Gahambar and one of Do Dahman, but the present Yazdi practice accords with that of the Shenshai Parsis, see Dhabhar, Riv., intro. xlviii.36 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS which was solemnized at the house of the founder of the observance for this is an &ldquo;outer service, which may be performed in any clean place, during any of the three daylight watches by a single priest. All the lesser gabambar services are, like the Visperad, devoted to Ohrmazd.</p>
<p>The custom of celebrating these services at the house of the founder of the gahambar meant that on a day when there were several en dowments the priest and congregation moved steadily around the village. If there were only a moderate number of observances, the priest began to solemnize them early in the afternoon, which allowed the men to attend first to their field-work; but on some days there were so many that he began at about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and continued, with a midday break, until dusk. The most popular gahambars were the fifth and sixth, both celebrated in high summer, when the long days allowed time for this pause at noon. On shorter winter days the celebrations, though fewer, followed one another almost continuously. Seen from the roof of one of the village houses, the procession which formed on these occasions was curiously moving, partly from the sense which it gave of something age-old and loyally maintained. First came the priest himself, dressed in white, and with him the village elders, also often in white or light coloured garments, walking gravely. Then there was the inevitable jostle and push of boys, penned in by the house-walls which ilanked the narrow lane. Then other men, mostly elderly, but with a sprink ling of younger ones, some returned for the occasion from Tebran; and finally a group of matrons and little girls, gay in their bright traditional clothes, predominantly red and green. Black was never seen in any garment, among men or women, for this was the Moslem colour; nor yellow, which was held to be unlucky. There were no young women or older girls in the procession, for they by custom attend only the celebration of gahambars in their family homes.&rsquo; According to the teachings of Zoroaster, men and women are equal in the spiritual life, with an equal hope of attaining heaven, and compared with their Moslem sisters of the Yazdi region, the Zoro astrian women enjoyed an enviable degree of dignity and freedom. But girls were carefully restricted, for social reasons, and at all gatherings men and women were seated separately, the women having always the worse position.</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 37</p>
<p>For every act of worship, whether private observance, family rite, or one involving the whole community, Zoroastrians insist on complete physical and ritual cleanliness. For them, as a Parsi has remarked, cleanliness is not next to godliness, but a part of it; and among the things which are held to drive away the divine beings and prevent them receiving men&rsquo;s prayers are both moral failings, such as hatred, anger and spite, and the physical ones of dirt-and disorder. To preserve cleanliness in an oasis village such as Sharif abad was not easy. Water was in short supply; and everything was kept inside the houses animals, poultry, corn, hay. Moreover, at intervals sudden fierce winds would spring up across the plain, bringing stinging clouds of sand into the open courtyards of the houses, and thence into all the rooms. Nevertheless, even on ordinary days, by dint of hard work, the Zoroastrian houses were kept clean and neat, and for a festival they were swept and garnished with even greater zeai. It was also the custom on the morning of a gaham bar to splash the mud-brick walls around the house-door with whitewash, or to set white marks around it, such as the imprints of an open hand, a good luck sign. White is the colour of purity; and the fresh marks were partly a welcome to divine visitants, partly to show everyone that a gahambar was to be celebrated there to which they should come, for no invitations were ever issued for a gahambar service. This holy occasion was open to everyone. As well as prepar ing the house thoroughly, each individual washed from head to foot-usually by the simple means of sluicing with buckets of water in the cattle-byre-and put on fresh clothes. Thus physical cleanli ness was achieved. Ritual cleanliness was also demanded, however, which meant that no one might take part in the observance, or in the preparations for it, who had been in contact with impurity and had not yet been ritually cleansed, or who was suffering from any uncleanness himself.</p>
<p>The heaviest part of the preparations was in providing the food to be consecrated, so that all who came might have their share. In general Sharifabad had maintained a traditional plainness in diet, and the villagers did not strive, as sometimes happened else where, to outdo one another in the range and delicacy of festival foods. They preferred rather to keep these simple, so that they might provide amply. The endowment of individual gahambars naturally varied in value, and sometimes originally substantial bequests had dwindled in worth down the years; but depending on</p>
<p>38 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS the endowment, there were three essential foods which were con secrated and distributed to the gabambar congregation. Firstly, there was lurk, a festival delicacy made up of seven kinds of fruits and nuts, which perhaps originally belonged especially to the celebra tion of the seven obligatory feasts, but which is now distributed on other holy days also. According to D. Khodadad, lurk should consist of such things as the following: senjed (the fruit of the oleaster), dates, raisins, walnuts, almonds, dried apricots, plums, and mulberries. Of these senjed, he said, was the most important, and indeed these rather dry and uninteresting fruits were always present in lurk, no doubt for the practical reason that oleasters grew along every irrigation ditch (adding greatly to the beauty of the fields), and their fruits kept indefinitely. All the other ingredients which he named could also readily be had locally, but often in 1964 a white sweetmeat was included, a modern luxury. The second food distributed was bread, freshly baked in rounds like thick griddle cakes, called in Dari luwok. Up to the last century the luwok would have been made of rye, but now the bread was always wheaten. For the gahambars the Sharifabadis baked little rounds, the same size as the ritual bread, called dron, which was consecrated in religious rites. (The custom of using unleavened dough for the dron was no longer observed in the Yazdi region, so that the small Juwok and dron were indistinguishable.) Finally, when the endow ment was sufficient, there was meat, provided by sacrificing a sheep or goat. At a gahambar there might be a distribution of lurk only, or of bread only; but at the best-endowed observances there was provision of all three, Iurk, bread, and meat.</p>
<p>Whenever bread was provided, there was much work to be done the night before. All food to be blessed had to be prepared in ritual purity (for it is a sin to consecrate anything unclean); and in the houses of wealthy merchants in Yazd it was usual to have a second kitchen which was kept solely for cooking food for religious purposes. Every fire-temple too had a place with earthen oven and hearths for preparing ceremonial foods. In a village home, however, all that could be done was to dust and sweep and scour the one kitchen, which though thus clean, invariably had its mud-brick walls blackened by wood-smoke, which escaped only through a bole in</p>
<p>the roof.</p>
<p>The bread-baking for a gahambar was shared by family and friends, and although hard work it was thoroughly enjoyed, as</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 39 a happy, convivial part of the festivities. The leaven was sought especially from a house where some dough had been kept from a secent baking for a religious observance; and there were so many family rites in Sharifabad (and also so many elderly women who lived alone and strictly kept the rules of purity) that there was never any difficulty about this. Mixing and kneading the dough, in great round pans, was men&rsquo;s work, and was done in the early evening. The men, who later did the baking also, were paid for their labours in corn, the usual village currency; but the women who came to help did so for nothing, as an act of piety—their personal contribu tion to the gahambar. At nightfall the boys of the family would go to relatives and friends to ask them in the name of the master of the house to give their aid; and later—sometimes, if it was to be a big baking, at ten o&rsquo;clock, sometimes at two or three in the morning &ndash;they went round again to say that the oven-fire was lit, and that the helpers should come. The bakers swathed their heads and necks in cotton cloths, and wore heavy cotton gauntlets to protect their hands and arms from the heat of the fire. The women helpers broke bits off the dough and shaped them into little flat rounds, which the bakers put four at a time on a wooden platter and clapped against the hot earthen sides of the oven. As the baked loaves were taken out a few minutes later, other women gathered them up and put them in baskets to cool. The kitchen would grow very hot, even by night, and much tea was drunk. Girls enlivened the time with music, usually singing to a big tambourine, and small boys dozed in corners, and woke up to eat hot bread and enjoy the scene. When the baking was done, if there had been an animal sacrifice the carcass was put into the hot oven to roast; and then a clean cloth would be laid on the floor and all the helpers would sit down to share a convivial meal, with more tea to wash away the heat of the work.</p>
<p>The weary workers then separated, perhaps at four or five in the morning, to snatch a little sleep. (Often their number included women in their late seventies, who took their full share in the night&rsquo;s work.) The women of the house might well do without any sleep, however, so many were the tasks ahead of them. After the dawn sweeping and dusting, one of the household went to the priest with a bowlful of wheat or flour (which was his recompense for the cere mony that he was to perform), and varderin, that is, fruits and herbs to be blessed by him as he solemnized the Yašt-e dron at his own</p>

Meanwhile the house of the gahambar filled gradually with relatives from other villages, or from the city of Yazd, come by bicycle, donkey, or the morning bus to join in the celebration; and they had to be fed, and all made ready for the celebration of the gabambar itself.</p>
<p>The first gahambar which I was privileged to attend in Sharifabad was in the fourth festival, Ayāthrim, popularly called the &lsquo;Gămbar-e Isfand&rsquo;, which then fell in February according to the traditional calendar. This celebration, on the first day of the festival, was held by Erdeshir Khodadadi, who lived in Tehran but had returned to an empty house to celebrate his grandfather&rsquo;s gahambar. After the night&rsquo;s convivial baking, first the men of the extended family, and then the women, were entertained to a morning meal. Then the courtyard and the surrounding rooms were sprinkled with water and swept once more, and at about noon the general company began to gather, until the courtyard was full of men and boys, with female relatives joining the women of the house in the kitchen. There was also a group of little girls of about five or six from some of the poorer village families, too young to be bothered by rules of propriety, who pushed their way sturdily through the throng in the yard and also disappeared into the dark kitchen.</p>
<p>This was in fact the first gahambar outside her own family circle which my young companion Piruza, then seventeen, Agha Rustam&rsquo;s second daughter, had ever attended, though her ten-year-old brother Gushtasp was a veteran of all such occasions. She and I retreated to the flat roof, from where we could also see the lane outside. A band of small boys were waiting at the house-door to go in with their school-teacher; and an old Moslem woman was there in her black veil, and a large patient dog, both hoping for doles of food. (Moslem beggars came regularly from Ardekan to seek charity from the Zoroastrians, but they made their way as unobtrusively as possible, to avoid the taunts of their co-religionists in Sharifabad.) A Moslem youth, instantly distinguishable by his blue shirt and black trousers, came down the lane driving a cow; and on seeing the Zoroastrian boys he picked up some large stones and Aung them over the cow&rsquo;s</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 41 head in their direction, but without hitting any of them. They stood their ground, and as he came level he hurled another stone directly at the dog, which yelped with pain and fled inside the house.</p>
<p>Inside the courtyard every man as he entered greeted the host, who was at the inner door to welcome his guests; and then each man, standing wherever there was room&ndash;knee-deep in boys if necessary said the košti-prayers, facing the sun. When he had finished, he sat down on the cobble-stones of the courtyard, facing the pesgam-e mas or &lsquo;great portico&rsquo;. The traditional Zoroastrian houses have two or four small porticoes opening on to the central courtyard, and one of these, called the great one, regardless of its size, was kept especially for religious services, that is, although it might be used for most everyday purposes, efforts were made to keep it free from any ritual impurity.&rdquo; For the act of worship a carpet was spread in this great pesgam, and D. Khodadad took his seat on it, cross-legged, with the village elders at his side. For the recital of an Afrinagan service certain things were always set before him to be consecrated: fire in a metal vase and pure water in a bowl; sprays of evergreen (myrtle or cypress); milk and wine (or vinegar), bread and fruits, preferably pomegranate and quince. For this particular Afrinagan-e gahambar there was also a great mound of lurk on a striped cotton cloth, and big metal basins full of bread and meat, the latter shredded into small pieces. Other food was being cooked, and was brought to the carpet by the mistress of the house while the service was in progress, to provide what the Sharifabadis called böy-o-brang &lsquo;odour and roasting&rsquo;;12 for Zoroastrians, like the Hebrews of old, traditionally believe that the divine beings &lsquo;inhale the pleasant fragrance&rsquo; of offerings, and are content. So the priest sliced in half the fruits which were set before him, to release their scent, and newly cooked foods were brought hot to the carpet. These might include any &lsquo;pure&rsquo; foods such as were normally eaten. (There were a few things which were eaten but were regarded as ritually impure, and so never to be consecrated. These included the head, forelegs, and blood of the sacrificial animal.) There were, however, three essential dishes which were always prepared, and efforts were made to have these cooked if possible by a woman who</p>

<p>All</p>
<p>When D. Khodadad was ready to begin the service, the atašband of the fire-temple, standing at the side of the pesgam-e mas, raised his voice and addressed the congregation, using a fixed formula: &lsquo;Behdins i.e. those of the Good Religion), know that today a gahambar is to be recited in the name of so-and-so, son of so-and-so. Ask that God should have mercy upon him, and upon those who have had a share in this pious work, and upon those who have entered here.&rsquo; D. Khodadad then began the service, reciting steadily and with concentration, his eyes upon the fire and the objects to be blessed. The Avestan words were incomprehensible to all; but while the boys merely chattered and fidgeted unheedingly, the men con</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 43 tinued softly reciting, either the liturgy of the service itself, if they knew it (but not in unison with the priest), or their own Avestan prayers, thus creating a murmurous undercurrent of sound to the priest&rsquo;s louder intoning. It was recognized in Sharifabad that every member of the congregation who wore the košti had a duty to join in the recital of Avestan, and only visitors from Tehran sat silent through the services, sometimes not even saying the koští prayers, There were, moreover, fixed points in every Afrinagan service where the congregation was required to make responses; and these points were signalled to them by the-atašband as he stood watching the priest.14 A moment is reached when the latter, as he utters the Avestan word afrīnāmi, picks up one of the myrtle sprigs lying before him, and then the atašband turns to the congregation, right hand uplifted with the forefinger raised, and they repeat this word in full-throated response, also raising their right hands in the same way. Almost immediately, at the word vīspo.khvāthram, the priest takes up two sprigs of myrtle, the atašband raises his first and middle fingers, and the congregation follows him, repeating this word also. This ritual occurred four times in each gahambar service, and the explanation given for it was that one finger raised meant &lsquo;God is one&rsquo;, two fingers &lsquo;He is not two&rsquo;. Whether or not this represents the original meaning of the ritual, it seems likely that such a deliberate affirmation of Zoroastrian monotheism developed under pressure from those Moslem polemicists who wilfully misinterpreted Zoroast rian dualism as meaning that Zoroastrians acknowledged two gods, rather than one beneficent and one malignant power. It is not easy to find a direct connection between the ritual and the text of the liturgy; but there is no doubt that the shared actions and responses united priest and congregation in a strong sense of corporate wor ship. For an observer the brief, sonorous responses were very impressive, and even the boys became momentarily alert. (It was in theory the duty of the atašband to act as srõšāvarz or discipliner, and he should, Agha Rustam said, carry a whip-chain with him, and brandish it over unruly boys; but the days of such firm measures seemed to be past, even in Sharifabad.)</p>
<p>At the end of the service was recited the brief Afrīn-e Dahmān, also called the Hamāzör-e Dahmän, because after it the worshippers make hamazor. This ritual, which seems to symbolize brotherly unity, was performed in the following way: the priest turned to the</p>

<p>e</p>
<p>d</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Then the master of the house prepared the com-e šwa &lsquo;meal for the dog&rsquo; (an essential rite which must be considered more fully later). The Sharifabadis also prepared a com-e māhi &lsquo;meal for the fishes&rsquo;, by pouring some of the consecrated water into a glass, and adding broken bits of &lsquo;clean&rsquo; bread and dried fruits. This was then poured, with recitation of Avesta, into a running stream-being evi dently in origin a libation to the waters. The rest of the consecrated water was poured out on the ground, a libation to Spendarmad, earth; and the remains of the consecrated wine were sometimes dashed against the side of the courtyard, to release its fragrance as it touched the sun-warmed wall.</p>
<p>While such things were being prepared or done, the dahmobed and two helpers tied round their waists big striped cotton cloths, and filled these with the food to be shared among the congregation. (Since Erdeshir&rsquo;s gahambar was endowed for bread, meat, and lurk, three men were needed for this work.) The portion of bread was regularly two rounds for a man, and one for each woman and child, with meat and lurk in proportion. Especially large shares of every thing, with larger rounds of bread, were given to the servants of the community, that is, the priest himself, the atašband, the dahmobeds, the guardians of the dakhma and the village shrines, the salars and the pakšus. Some of the food distributed was eaten sociably on the spot, and the rest was wrapped in clean napkins to be carried home, together with portions for the bedridden and those unavoidably absent. The host then stood again by the house-door, to bid his guests farewell, and they took their leave with a fixed formula: &ldquo;May gāh and gahămbar protect thee! Such leave-takings were</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 45 carried out with a grace and grave courtesy worthy of the courts of princes.</p>
<p>At the lane-door a little group of hopeful dogs had gathered by then, and they pleaded for a share of the food in the napkins, and got doles of bread, broken into three, the sacred number. Two Moslem beggars who were waiting by this time also received some thing from the master of the house, with a hearty Khôš āmadid &ldquo;You are welcome!&rsquo;; but food thus given in charity to unbelievers was never consecrated, but was taken to them direct from the kitchen. (Similarly at the gahambar celebrated on behalf of a family now turned Moslem, unconsecrated lurk was regularly sent to them.).</p>
<p>Since there were other gahambars to be celebrated on that day, the priest and elders, having left first, led the way, in the manner described above, to the next house, where the same observances were repeated. Sometimes there would be two endowed ceremonies at one house, solemnized in succession, and then every man present would make new the košti&rsquo; again between the services, because this observance must precede every separate act of worship. The atašband carried the metal fire-vase with him from house to house, adding to the fire in it a few embers from each hearth-fire which had cooked food for a gahambar; and at the end of the day he took the vase to the fire-temple and set it in the presence of the sacred fire, for it was said that if a fire grew cold alone it went to the divs, but if it grew cold within sight of a sacred fire it went to the Amahraspands.</p>
<p>These were the basic rites of a gahambar, which might be shared in, without invitation, by any Zoroastrian who was in a state of purity, whether from the village or coming from outside. The other hospitalities of the five-day festivals were private matters, decided on by individual families, and for these invitations were given by word of mouth. These invitations, carried by boys, were again couched in set terms, as follows: So-and-so, son of so-and-so, sends his greetings and invitation to you, that you should come at noon and share the gahambar-salt with a mouthful of food.&rsquo; These words were usually called out at the open house-door, and the formal answer of acceptance would come back from the depths of the house: &ldquo;We shall give you this trouble. Such noonday gatherings were sometimes big affairs, and were conducted with a characteristic Sharifabadi mixture of simplicity and courtly good manners. A typical one, given by Turk Jamshidi, Agha Rustam&rsquo;s great-uncle, followed the celebration at his house of a gahambar with bread and</p>
<p>CTTTTTTTTSTUPYMTWTFRITIDIR.46 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS meat. Long strips of cloth were laid on the ground in the pesgam-e mas, and the men and boys took their places at them. Turk himself being away in Tebran, his brother Jehangir did the honours for him, receiving the guests and waiting on them throughout the meal, while Turk&rsquo;s young son Rustam acted as water-pourer, filling and refilling glasses with courteous attentiveness. There was merry talk and laughter, with only two people following the ancient custom of eating with bāj—that is, in strict silence, between an initial and a concluding Avestan prayer. 16 (This custom was held to show respect to the Amahraspands Hordad and Amurdad, who protect the creations of water and plants.) One of the two was the priest, who sat flanked by loquacious laymen, but never then or on any other occasion when I was present broke his discipline of silence. I myself several times forgot, when sitting by him, that he ate and drank under this rule, and spoke to him during a meal; and he would then simply shake his head, and wait until he had finished and had &rsquo;left the baj&rsquo; before answering. Even on the hottest summer days I never knew him to drink a sip of water without first &rsquo;taking the baj&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The other persons who still ate &lsquo;with baj&rsquo; were the salars, the corpse-bearers, who in their professional impurity followed almost as strict a rule of life as the priest in his purity. One of them, Khos row, being a nephew of Turk&rsquo;s, was present by invitation at this gabambar feast. He had brought his own small square cloth, so as not to make contact (paivand) with others as he ate, and his own plate and glass. He spread the cloth in a corner of the pesgam, said the initial baj, and ate in silence. Jehangir waited on him with the same warm courtesy and attentiveness which he showed his other guests, serving him lavishly, while Khosrow indicated his wishes by signs of the hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the men and boys had eaten, the women and girls, who had been talking gaily in a side-room, rose in a colourful flock and came to take their places; and Jebangir waited on them as he had waited on the men, though a girl-cousin took over young Rustam&rsquo;s part. Lastly, when all their guests had been served, the family ate, while the others sat about the courtyard and entertained one another with talk and song.</p>
<p>There were still two or three houses in Sharifabad which offered a general hospitality, in princely style. At one, when the people had all gathered to hear the recital of the Afrinagan-e Gahambar, the master of the house had the outer door shut and barred, and kept the whole company captive to be his guests at the noonday meal. At two other houses the old custom was kept up of entertaining after dark. (This used to be the general practice, until a certain dahmobed persuaded most of the village to change to midday for their con vivial gatherings, as more convenient.) At one of these houses, belonging to Rashid Rashidi, the whole Zoroastrian community of several hundred souls was invited to an evening meal. There was a big endowment here, with a gahambar of bread and meat at midday; and after dark there was noise and confusion in the narrow lanes as throngs of people came and went in merry family groups. With so many guests there were innumerable sittings, and as each finished they rose and made room for others. Their host was an old and sick man who could not move from his place, but his sons and a . brother dispensed the usual gracious hospitality on his behalf; and despite the bustle and coming and going there was a sense of deep underlying piety, and of warm-heartedness towards one&rsquo;s fellow men. Another generous act of hospitality was performed by one Mihraban, who invited all the children from the two village schools, boys and girls (some sixty to seventy in all), to breakfast at his house before the recital there of the Afrinagan-e Gahambar. The boys were fed, naturally, before the girls.)</p>
<p>The food on these festive occasions usually included meat dishes (since in the hard times of the not so distant past holy days were often the only times in the year when the villagers tasted meat). A dish frequently offered to those who helped with the night-baking was khin-e jusunda, &lsquo;boiled blood&rsquo;. For this wheat-flour and salt</p>

<p>48 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS were added to the blood of the sacrifice, and when this mixture had</p>
<p>the boil, making a rich gravy which was sprinkled over other dishes often over the fried liver. But since liver is ritually pure, while blood is not, the portion of liver for the dog had to be set aside before this was done. Another regular festival dish was gīpa. This consisted of a mixture of chopped meat with rice, herbs, fat, and seasoning, which was simmered in little bags made from the sheep&rsquo;s stomach. A tiny gipa, made from the end of the stomach, which formed a neat natural bag, was prepared especially for the dog, and was called a bāybāzūk. Other main dishes were šurvā-ye beryānī, a gravy-soup cooked in a pot at the bottom of the oven, under the roasting sheep; šurva-nakhod, meat-soup with dried peas; meat fried with onions; other fries of marrow, onions, and eggs; and various thick pottages, with or without meat. In addition there was always freshly baked bread and usually white cheese, and in season garden-stuff such as lettuce, mint, or radishes.</p>
<p>In the intervals between the religious services and the family feasts, everyone spent the five festival days as he chose. Most went at some time to the fire-temple, to pray before the Ataš Bahram. For older people there was much visiting between houses, to meet relatives who had come from elsewhere, and plenty of talk went on; while young people met-girls and youths separately, of course—to sing and dance and amuse themselves. Often too they went in small groups round the village shrines, offering prayers and lighting candles at each; and the children played everywhere, and enjoyed the bustle of the preparations in different houses. Since the girls could not share with their young brothers the pleasure of going to a succession of gahambar celebrations, they made their own amusements, meeting at each other&rsquo;s homes to play games such as blind man&rsquo;s buff, tag, and skipping.</p>
<p>The first five gahambars were identical in observances, and were distinguished from one another only by the number of endowed ceremonies, and by the characteristics of the changing seasons. The sixth and last, at the year&rsquo;s end, had, however, some special usages, because it celebrated the achievement of all creation, ex cept for pervading fire; and this was signalized by modelling all sorts of different things in diverse materials. Since these were to be consecrated, all the work was done with the greatest care for cleanli ness and purity. The women and girls made a sweet dough, with</p>

The boys, having washed face and hands, fetched fine clay from a bank just outside the village, mixed it with ‘pure&rsquo; water, and kneaded it into a smooth mass; and the next day, when this had begun to harden, the family joined in modelling it into free-standing figures. Among the favourites were domestic animals, cows, donkeys, sheep, and often a camel with panniers and a rider. A nightingale was often fashioned, and, oddly enough, another favourite was a peacock, its spread tail made with little clay-tipped sticks, which quivered if it was touched. Little sticks were also used for the legs of standing animals, and were then covered with clay. Household objects were modelled in clay too, such as a sugar Ioaf, bowls, or a three-legged stool. When the clay was quite dry it was whitewashed, and the little pure white models were set in a group in the pesgam-e mas, to bear witness to the triumphant con clusion of all the works of creation. This custom was once general in Yazd itself and all the villages, but by 1964 it had been so long dis continued, except in Sharifabad and Mazras, that only old people remembered it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The sixth gahambar merged partly with the feast of All Souls, Farvardigan or Panjī, which had originally been kept on the last night of the old year, but which, as a result of the Sasanian calendar changes, was prolonged for ten additional days, the last five coincid ing with the gahambar. Both festivals were accordingly followed directly by New Year&rsquo;s Day, No Ruz, the seventh feast of obligation. This was a very joyful holy day, which in ancient pagan times had presumably been simply a celebration of spring, held to welcome the resurgence of life in field and byre; but when Zoroaster refounded it, he made it more complex, a Janus-faced feast of great theological significance. On the one hand, as a spring feast it now not only celebrated the renewal of life here on earth, but served to remind his followers that one day, when evil had been overcome and the Last Judgement was at hand, men would break out of their graves, as leaf and blossom now break out of earth and branch, and would be raised up again in the flesh (for Zoroaster was the first to teach the conjoined doctrines of the resurrection of the body, the Last Judge ment, and life everlasting). So, as a feast of hope and renewal, No Ruz was celebrated with symbols of newness and freshness, with a giving of gifts and a donning of new garments. Yet, on the other</p>

<p>MY TYTANTTI</p>
<p>50 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS hand, it was the seventh feast of obligation, devoted to Ardvahišt and his creation of fire, and so it looked backward also to the old year, whose chain of festivals it triumphantly completed. Hence it was celebrated also with many and varied rites containing the number seven,</p>
<p>The dedication of this great boly day to Ardvabišt was marked chiefly in this way, that from midday of No Ruz the noontide watch, called &lsquo;Rapithwin&rsquo;, was restored, and all prayers said during its three hours contained an invocation of Ardvabišt.I$ Rapithwin, the spirit of noon, is a helper of Ardvahist, as an embodiment of fiery heat. All through the summer, the beneficent season, his watch was kept, but with the onset of winter at Ayathrim, the fourth gahambar, Rapithwin was held to depart beneath the earth, there to keep the springs of water and roots of plants warm, and so prevent them dying from frost; and his watch was annexed to the first one, &ldquo;Hāvan&rsquo;, which was under the protection of Mihr, and he, therefore, was invoked then in all its prayers. But when No Ruz came to usher in spring and summer, then Rapithwin returned to earth, and the noontide prayers were addressed once more to Ardvahišt. His return offered not only an annual joy, but a yearly reminder of the doctrine that one day a perfect time, perennial summer, would be established again for ever upon earth. The ob servance of his watch, marking so vividly Ardvahišt&rsquo;s annual triumph over devilish winter, was plainly intended to bring this doctrine home, through recurrent devotional practice, to every worshipper;19 and one could indeed bear the joy in the voices of village elders as they reminded their fellows in the early days of the new year that &lsquo;We have Rapithwin!</p>
<p>Yet even in Sharifabad the doctrinal significance of what should have been the linked celebration of No Ruz and the six gahambars had been lost sight of; and the likelihood is that it had already been obscured for Zoroastrians before the coming of Islam through the confusions which followed the Sasanian calendar reform. These affected No Ruz more drastically than any other festival, and led in the end to its celebration being split between three days of the year, so that there came to be a secular No Ruz in the spring (which, being secular, survived under Islam), and two separate days for the</p>
<p>18 On this and what follows see in detail ‘Rapithwin&hellip;, 201-15.</p>
<p>19 For the strong likelihood, therefore, that the watch of Rapithwin was instituted by Zoroaster himself see Boyce, History, i. 258-9.</p>
<p>THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS 51 religious No Ruz in Farvardin Mah (at whatever time of year that happened to be). So important were all three feasts that their celebration must be described in separate chapters hereafter. This multiplying of observances shattered the old, simple structure of the Zoroastrian devotional year, so that the fundamental link was lost between No Ruz and the gahambars. In consequence, the latter came to be celebrated as feasts simply in honour of Ohrmazd the Creator, rather than in honour of Ohrmazd and the six Amahraspands; and the little figures modelled at the sixth gahambar were thought of, not as celebrating the achievement of the six creations, but as being part of the rites of All Souls—as playthings, that is, for the souls of children. In this respect, therefore, what one must assume to have been one purpose of Zoroaster&rsquo;s foundation of the seven great feasts to imprint his basic doctrines firmly in the minds of all his followers, simple as well as learned—was thwarted. What was presumably another purpose, namely to foster solidarity among them by bringing them together for worship, continued to be fulfilled; and there is no doubt that endowing and celebrating so many gahambars was one of the factors which helped to keep the Sharifabadis a close-knit community, united through the practice of their faith.</p>
<p>There was, moreover, another means by which their prophet&rsquo;s teaching about the seven Amahraspands and the seven creations was brought home almost daily even to the unlettered, and that was through the symbolism of the religious services. This symbolism was expounded to me in exactly the same terms by an old farmer in Mazra Kalantar, by Agha Rustam, and by a Yazdi priest serving the</p>
<p>Amahraspands, they each independently explained, were physically represented at every religious service through their own creations, in the following way: to Ohrmazd belonged the priest himself and the Avestan which he recited, to Vahman the milk, to Ardvahist the fire, to Shahtevar the metal utensils, to Spendarmad the earth upon which the rite was enacted (the priest sitting always cross legged upon the ground), to Hordad the water, and to Amurdad the bread, herbs, and fruits. This symbolism was generally under stood by the Sharifabadis (for they and the villagers in Mazrat Kalantar were well instructed, from father to son, in the basic tenets of their faith); and so the link between the Amahraspands and their creations was continually presented to them in visual terms, as they took part in Afrinagans and other acts of worship.</p>
<p>52 THE WORSHIP OF OHRMAZD AND THE CREATIONS</p>
<p>Apprehending the doctrine, the villagers were conscious of serving the Amahraspands through their creations in their daily lives also, and this was yet another way in which their faith worked with the grain of human nature, adding an extra sense of purpose to the neces sary tasks of every day. It was the religious element in their care of water and earth, plants and animals, which made Zoroastrians re nowned even beyond the regions of Yazd and Kerman as good husbandmen, stockmen, and gardeners. Care for the creation of Shahrevar made them thrifty and yet charitable, and respect for that of man showed itself in hopesty and uprightness. In the case of several of the creations their service also took special devotional forms. Thus there were mighty trees which were venerated indivi dually as representatives of the creation of Amurdad; and in general evergreen trees—cypress, myrtle, and pine—were especially rever enced as symbols of immortality, as was the pomegranate, because of its many-seeded fruit. Such trees were regularly planted around fire-temples. The pomegranate was also cultivated in orchards, but even so to destroy a pomegranate with sweet fruits was regarded as a sin, and when in 1960 one died in the courtyard of Agha Rustam&rsquo;s house, he sent for a Moslem labourer to dig out the roots.</p>
<p>Water too was much reverenced, at springs and streams, and its cult was parallel in some respects to that of fire. These two were the most venerated of the creations, and so many and important were the rites connected with them that these must be considered separately in later chapters. A final point to be made in concluding this one is that the Zoroastrian veneration for the seven creations never stops at the physical world, or even with their own especial divine guardians, but has always for its fipal object the Creator of all things good, Ohrmazd himself.</p>
