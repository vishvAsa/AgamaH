subAhu-pari-pR^ichCha is a kriyAtantra of the saugata-nAstika-s,  
whose Skt original has been lost  
but a translation into Tibetan survives.  
It has the following anti-V1 message that would warm the cockles of the nIladrApin types.  
Translated from the Tibetan it goes :

> “They should live near a pleasant town,  
not too close or too far,  
Where food and drink are available,  
and shUdras predominate.  
It should be hospitable to guests,  
And without brAhmaNa-s of other traditions."+++(5)+++

Evidently, it accepts the fact that some v1s had converted to the nAstika fold and having them was probably OK.+++(5)+++

> brahmaNa-s overcome with pride  
Are arrogant about their lineage and lack compassion.  
They create problems whenever they see  
People worshiping at shrines to the sugata.

In the second verse, it is more explicit in apparently condemning all v1s.

After mentioning some things about the dangers of women,  
the text goes on to condemn some other things:

> “Wherever there are calves and young cows,  
Wherever people are drinking alcohol,  
Wherever young women serve and play,  
Wherever young men sport,  
> 
> “At any feast where dog meat is served,  
Wherever many people gather,  
And wherever music is played,  
There a person should never go"

The tAthagatan concerns in some ways paralleled an Abrahamistic counter-religion.+++(4)+++

Further the text mounts an attack on H worship thus:

> "Not even in fear  
> should they pay homage to
brahmA, shakra, viShNu, rudra, vAyu, and the rest.  
They should not follow the teachings they propound,  
Practice their austerities, or worship their symbols.  
They should not harbor animosity to their doctrines,  
But should never delight in their practice either.  
They should never praise them or recite their mantras."
