+++

Mantras require the proper energization for them to work in the best possible manner. How to awaken and empower the mantra is one of the most important considerations in the usage of any mantra. In the following chapter, we will explore the main methods and approaches for doing this. One must bring life to the mantra, which is to make the mantra not only part of your personal life but of the universal life around you. Energization of mantra in turn requires some guidance and connection with the greater tradition of Mantra Yoga.

The term mantra traditionally suggests a mantra guru. A guru or spiritual guide is often defined as one who gives us a mantra and makes it work. The special word or instruction of the guru can itself be called mantra and can function as a mantra for us. The guru is usually part of a yogic tradition that has its own mantras, through which the tradition is sustained, linking us back to previous gurus and a line of teachers and teachings.

An important factor to consider before taking up any mantra is the source the mantra has come from. Who is giving you the mantra and according to what authority or sanction? What kind of teacher or therapist is necessary to provide a mantra that really works for your particular issues in life? What constitutes a real mantra guru and what types of mantra teachers can be helpful to consult?

We have already discussed the importance of first knowing what we are seeking from a mantra and how we are applying it. A mantra by itself is a mere sound. Unless we have some means to bring it to life, the mantra may not become effective, even if we have a good mantra to begin with.

If we are looking to choose our own mantras, there is the danger that we may not have enough inner knowledge to determine the best mantra in the first place. It is better to consult a mantra guru or mantra teacher before taking up a mantra, even if we have carefully considered different mantras and how to use them. Just as in any other Yoga practice, like asana, pranayama or meditation, a teacher is an important aid and in many instances indispensable.

Generally, for a mantra to grant moksha or liberation,’ it requires the energization of a Self-realized guru or a tradition going back to Self-realized gurus. Mantras for the outer goals of life are not as stringent in their rules of choice or application.

Some spiritual groups hold that only mantras given by a great guru will work. While this reflects the concerns of moksha or liberation mantras, it is not true of all mantras, though any mantra given by a great master will naturally have a greater efficacy. In India, there are mantras for everything, and mantras are passed on by a variety of sources. Parents teach mantras to their children from family traditions relative to family gurus and family deities. School teachers teach mantras to aid students in the learning process, like chants to Sarasvati and Ganesha, the main deities who govern the learning process. India’s traditional music contains mantras and sacred chants as part of common songs. Clearly one doesn’t have to go to an enlightened guru for any mantra, but for the higher mantras we need if not an outer connection with a great guru, at least a profound inner connection with a guru, deity or tradition.

Traditional mantras connect us with the energy and aspiration of the many people that have used the mantras over time, putting us in touch with special currents and rivers of spiritual energy so generated. Of course, we should make sure to choose a mantra from a tradition that we resonate with, and that directs us to the goal that we are really seeking. A traditional guru can empower the mantra for us or instruct us how to do so. There are also traditional rules of receiving mantras, times for taking up mantras, and rituals for using mantras that make them more effective.

## Rules of Mantric Applications

Each application of mantra has particular rules of usage. If you are using a mantra for healing purposes, the mantra should be correctly prescribed and applied just like herbs, diet or any other healing therapy. A good Ayurvedic practitioner – particularly one trained in traditional Yoga and Ayurveda – should be able to recommend suitable healing mantras for you. If you are seeking a mantra for astrological purposes, for removing negative planetary energies and their resultant karmas, you need to consult a good astrologer trained in the astrological application of mantra. If you want to use mantras for Vastu or purposes of protecting your dwelling, you need someone who knows the rules of Vastu and the mantras that go along with these.

*However, such mantra teachers or therapists need to practice the mantras in order to be really able to pass them on to others, preferably having the siddhi or power of the mantra that arises from deep and long term practice.* For example, if an astrologer recommends a traditional mantra for an afflicted Saturn in your chart, the mantra can help. But if the astrologer has practiced these Saturn mantras for years and has gained the grace of Saturn as a cosmic power, then the same mantras will be much more effective.

If you are looking for a mantra for ritualistic purposes – such as to aid in achieving the outer goals of home, family or career – a Hindu priest can help you and recommend both mantras and rituals that will aid in your actions. The work of Hindu priests and pandits largely consists of performing mantras and rituals for the benefit of others, and they are carefully trained how to do this.

Besides mantras that require special prescriptions, there are ‘universal mantras’ that can be recommended for everyone. Certain spiritual mantras like *Oæ *or peace chants \(Shanti mantras\) are general in their application and are often widely prescribed. Many traditions pass on certain mantras to their followers like the Gayatri mantra by the Arya Samaj or Gayatri Pariwar.1

There are certain ‘personal mantras’ that we can choose for ourselves. Each person can develop his or her own personal mantra favorites according to the form of the Divine they worship \(their Ishta Devata mantra\), their own inclination, or what simply resonates best with them. You don’t have to get an approval to chant a mantra to the Divine as you best relate to it, though certainly the mantra will have more power if given by a teacher in the tradition.2

However, if one wants a powerful moksha or liberation mantra, it is best to seek a Self-realized guru, or a teacher in the tradition of Self-realized masters, to initiate you. Yet even here one has to exercise a great deal of discrimination. Of the many who may claim to be Self-realized teachers, only a few may be so, particularly those who stand outside of any formal tradition.

## Mantra and Shakti

For a mantra to be really effective, it must be electrified as it were. There must be prana in it, along with a power of deeper feeling and a concentration of mind and heart. Repeating such an energized mantra can be compared with the effect of saying the name of one’s beloved as opposed to saying the name of a person that one does not know.

There is an inner Mantra Shakti that must be brought into function for a mantra to become really effective. This empowerment of the mantra can come through the guru, through tradition, through intense practice, deep devotion, or even by grace – or may require all of these. When the Mantra Shakti is awakened, the mantra will resonate with dynamic energy and repeat itself by its own power. It will connect you to the deity in a form or relationship that communicates to you. It will follow an internal light and sound vibration, stimulating a higher form of contemplation and meditation within you. Its inner meaning and broader associations will become clear as the mantra begins to speak to you and teach you. You will see the mantra vibrating in the world around you and resonating through your entire being.

Once the Mantra Shakti is awakened with a single mantra, any number of mantras can be energized by transferring its power to them. One can compare this Mantra Shakti to poetic inspiration, through which the power and beauty of any number of words can be developed. We must learn how to bring life to the mantra, which requires making our own lives and thoughts into mantras. Mantra can bring a cosmic energy into all the sounds that we hear, whether it is the beating of our hearts, the howling of the wind, or even the barking of a dog.

Awakening the mantra Shakti is the foundation of effective mantra practice. Mantras cannot be made to work mechanically or merely according to our personal wishes. To enliven a mantra requires a sense of the sacred, particularly an honoring of the Goddess, who holds the power of sacred sound. However, there is no outer formula according to which this inner mantric power can be awakened, though a frequent and dedicated repetition of a mantra is helpful. We must remain receptive to the Mantra Shakti, allowing its grace to flow. This entails repeating the mantra as a prayer and a meditation with a receptive mind and heart. Those who have the Mantra Shakti fully developed within themselves become true mantra gurus. They know intuitively the different powers of sounds and intentions and can recommend what an individual may need at any stage of life.

Each mantra has a consciousness of its own that is connected to the universal consciousness. Unless we link to that mantra consciousness \(Mantra Chaitanya\) and work with it, then the mantra is likely to remain without vitality or direction. Once we have awakened the Mantra Shakti, it will then bring to life the Mantra Chaitanya. The mantra will become a repository of wisdom, perception and insight.

## Mantra and the Deity

Mantras relate to the Divine in various names, forms and functions, from the outer forces of nature to the Absolute transcending all time and space. These forms and aspects of the Divine, called Devatas in Hindu thought, are usually referred to as Gods and Goddesses in the West, though these terms, we should note can be misleading, as they are not separate deities but different Divine qualities and functions.

Such deities provide us with an intimate and personal connection with the Divine and our higher Self. Whether for spiritual or mundane purposes, a mantra is usually connected to the propitiation of the appropriate deity or aspect of the Divine for the purpose involved, like Lakshmi for wealth, Sarasvati for learning, Kali for strength, or Shiva for peace.

Mantras are usually addressed to the deity in order to bring a Divine power and grace into our lives. The Devatas have their own special mantras through which we can call upon them and gain their grace: Lakshmi mantras like *Írãæ*, Sarasvati mantras like *Aiæ *and so on. The mantra is said to be the subtle body of the deity, the mental counterpart to its representational form. The mantra is often a name of the deity we seek to connect with. Divine names are among the most powerful mantras. They represent Divine attributes and powers and can bring these into our lives.

It is best to look at the mantra as a vehicle for communion with the Deity – as a kind prayer – not as a power to manipulate for personal ends. Mantras are usually performed along with devotional practices and dedicated to the deity. This is one of the most important ways for empowering a mantra and awakening its inner energy. The deity can be defined according to one’s Ishta Devata or the form of the Divine that one personally worships, or to God in a relationship sense as Divine Father or Divine Mother. Your primary, root or mula mantra is usually that of your Ishta Devata or form of the Divine that you worship.

The inner honoring of the deity helps us approach the mantra with the proper respect, so that it can yield the blessings it is endowed with. It is the grace of the deity that grants the fruit of the mantra, not just the mantra as our personal expression. Naturally, if we are calling upon the Divine with mantra, we must do so with the right attitude, intention and action. You don’t expect God to answer your prayers and mantras if you approach the deity carelessly or thoughtlessly\! Treat any mantra with devotion and it will give you back the rewards of Divine love.

## Mantra and Ritual

What is done in a sacramental manner has more power, a greater karmic effect and leaves a stronger samskara or residual effect in order to guide our actions for the future. Rituals and sacraments are an important way to make our lives more meaningful by connecting us with the greater universe. Healing also works best if done as a ritual or in a sacred manner, which aids in the flow of healing energies.

Mantras are commonly part of rituals. Mantra, we could say, is ‘sacred thought’ and ritual is ‘sacred action’. Sacred thought naturally embodies and expresses itself in sacred action. Generally, it is best to perform some ritual before or along with reciting a mantra.

One can look at a ritual as a kind of mantric gesture or expression of mantra in action. There is a whole science of ritual in Vedic thought that involves special fire offerings called yajnas and ritual worship of images called pujas. Yoga is meant to be such an inner ritual, sacrifice or sacred action.

## Empowering Mantras with Substances

An important way to energize mantras is through the five elements of nature, particularly through water and fire. Mantras chanted in water gain more power, for example, while bathing or while standing in a river or in the ocean. Mantras can be used to purify or energize water. You can chant mantras over water before drinking it or using it to make herbal beverages or foods. It is good to have such mantrically energized water in your home, in your kitchen and in your meditation room. Water is a vehicle for prana and for emotion. We should make sure to use mantras to create water that can really nourish our souls.

Mantras chanted while meditating in the presence of a sacred fire are also more powerful. The fire magnifies and carries their influence into the greater universe. It is best to use mantras along with specially performed Vedic fire rituals, sanctified by special offerings. You can write mantras down and burn them in a sacred fire to purify and energize them and to convey your intentions to the cosmic powers.

Relative to the force of air, you can use mantras along with prayer flags placed on your house, nearby trees or in a temple environment. Another way to use the air element is to chant mantras along with special forms of incense. Or we can recite a mantra to clear the air of negative energies. Relative to the forces of ether, one can chant mantras around flowers or to define sacred spaces, or around the space that you wish to sanctify or protect. You can use mantras to consecrate your house, healing room or meditation room.

Mantras gain more power if they are recited relative to a statue or form of a deity that you worship regularly and feel a divine presence in. In fact, you can use mantras to empower all the material forces around you. This includes using mantras to energize sacred stones, crystals or other forms of the earth element.Mantras can be used to energize, sanctify or spiritualize whatever we do. Once we have brought energy to the mantra, the mantra can pass that energy wherever we direct it, empowering both the objects and actions around us.

In the practice of Yoga, mantras can be used to sanctify our asana or meditation seat. They can be used to spiritualize our Yoga room or Yoga class. In regard to Ayurveda, mantras can be used to empower herbs, foods, or therapies. Relative to Vedic astrology, mantras can be used to bring in the sacred energy of the planets and the forces of time. Relative to Vastu, mantras can be used to sanctify the forces of space and directional influences. In the appendix of the book, more specific guidelines on the use of mantra have been provided.
