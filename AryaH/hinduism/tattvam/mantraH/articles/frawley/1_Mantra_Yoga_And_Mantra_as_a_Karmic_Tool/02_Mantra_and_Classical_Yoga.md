title = "02 Mantra and Classical Yoga"

+++

Classical Yoga is one of the world’s most important approaches to Self-realization, to understanding our true nature beyond time and space, birth and death, suffering and limitation. Mantra in Sanskrit means the tool ‘tra’ of the mind ‘manas’. It is the primary tool of Yoga for calming the mind, which is necessary to allow us access to the higher Self. While classical Yoga through the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali does not make mantra specifically into one of Yoga’s eight limbs, it does regard mantra as a key practice relative to all aspects of Yoga.1

Mantra creates the orientation of mind necessary for the yamas and niyamas, the prime yogic observances, attitudes and life-style measures, to work. Such yogic observances as non-violence \(ahimsa\) and truthfulness \(satya\) are mantras themselves as it were, prime principles to repeat in our minds and hearts in order to guide our lives.

+ 
Asanas performed while repeating the appropriate mantras bring a greater energy and awareness into the bones, muscles, joints and nerves, and help us transcend body consciousness.

+ 
Pranayama practiced along with special ‘prana mantras’ can connect us to the cosmic prana and draw it into our deeper mind and heart for greater vitality and awareness.

+ 
Mantra, by its ability to internalize the mind, is a prime tool of pratyahara, the yogic internalization of the senses necessary to bring our awareness to our deeper mind and heart. There are special ‘pratyahara mantras’ for this purpose.

+ 
Concentration on a mantra is an important method for developing the power of attention that is the basis of dharana or concentration practices. There are special ‘dharana mantras’, which are connected to holding the gaze at various outer or inner locations like the chakras.

+ 
Meditating on the sound or meaning of a mantra is one of the best and simplest meditations to perform, and one of the main approaches to dhyana. There are special ‘dhyana mantras’ for this purpose.

+ 
The use of sacred sound and music is one of the best means to bring the mind into the state of samadhi or yogic oneness, absorption and bliss.


There are many mantras that can go along with asana practice. Many Yoga students chant the names of the Sun while doing the Sun salutation, for example. Most importantly, certain bija mantras can be used to direct or alter the power of the asana and make it more effective. However, we must remember that mantra is a sacred practice, not just an adjunct to a physical exercise, and treat it with respect. To do this requires making our asanas into mantras, prayers or rituals, not simply adding mantras as ornaments to physical movements.

Repeating special mantras along with the breath increases the energy of prana, helping to revitalize not only the body but also the mind. Mantra adds a sacred dimension and higher vibration to the practice and can transform pranayama into meditation.

Mantra is an important method of pratyahara or internalization of our energy. The mind and senses can follow the mantra to turn within, leaving all distractions aside. For this to occur, we must be able to energize the mantra, not only with prana, but with the power of the senses. We must learn to sense the mantra as resonance behind all of our senses.

Focusing on a particular mantra – particularly holding to a bija mantra – is one of the main methods of dharana or yogic concentration. Continuously directing the mantra to a particular location like the tip of the nose or to a particular chakra turns it into a dharana practice. Very helpful in this regard is ‘Mantra Drishti’ or the gaze of the mantra, in which one concentrates one’s gaze along with the mantra, particularly on sites in the body like the heart, the third eye, the navel or the base of the spine. As asana controls the body and pranayama controls the breath, so mantra controls the mind, not artificially but through a natural development of energy and attention. Mantra maintains the strength and integrity of our mental field, so that the mind no longer wanders off or loses its composure. Mantra sustains the proper circulation of energies in the sphere of the mind, so that we are no longer vulnerable to external conditioning which, after all, is based largely on reactive patterns of words and names.

Just as asanas place the body in a calm and relaxed state, so mantras puts the mind into a steady and relaxed state for meditation. For example, repeating the mantra *Oṁ *has the same calming and uplifting affect upon the mind and heart that the lotus pose does for the body.

## Mantra Meditation

Mantra is not only an important preparation for meditation, ‘Mantra Meditation’ is one of the main types of meditation, with many variations. After all, our main mental fixation is with words. Mantra allows us to turn this negative attachment into a positive inspiration, as we replace our ordinary words and phrases with mantras.

Mantra practice gradually calms and integrates the mind. The mind becomes silent, concentrated and reflective, allowing our awareness to vibrate with the mantra. This naturally leads to deeper meditation, in which the mantra may fall away. Formless meditation is hard to achieve directly but becomes easily accessible once one builds the power of mantra in the mind. When we repeat a mantra, or do various forms of chanting, a more refined vibration develops and begins to assume the background pattern of our minds, down to a subconscious level. If we continually return to the mantra each time our mind becomes agitated, then the mantra’s power to calm the mind will increase.

It should be beneath our dignity as a Divine soul to allow our minds to dwell on negative thoughts and emotions, fears, desires, jealousy and hatred, or to be controlled and distracted by external influences. With the mantra, we have a tool for redirecting the energy of the mind within so that we can reclaim our inner composure. Mantra can help us break up deep-seated mental and emotional patterns, conditioning and traumas even from childhood.

**Traditional Yoga practice consists of two primary stages:**

1. 
To develop sattva guna or ‘purity of body and mind’.

2. 
To still the mind and go beyond it to the higher Self or Purusha.


The first stage of Yoga requires promoting sattva guna to create the proper balance in the mind, removing toxins and doshas from the body, and neutralizing the residual energies of rajas and tamas or agitation and inertia from the subconscious. The second stage consists of going beyond the mind-body complex and all of its conditioning, even that of sattva guna, to pure awareness.

Generally, we cannot succeed at the second step, if we have not first accomplished the first, which is its prerequisite. Many problems in Yoga practice arise from attempting the second step when the first has not been accomplished \(in some cases it may not have even been attempted\!\). People may try to meditate in stillness, or enter into the oneness, while their minds remain outwardly oriented and caught in the disturbances of the body and senses. The proper practice of mantra helps neutralize such difficulties, developing sattva or harmony in the deeper mental field. If our minds are noisy, disturbed, hypersensitive, reactive, opinionated, critical, or just constantly busy, we cannot silence them. If we are addicted to sensory sources of stimulation and entertainment, we are not even in control of our minds and so cannot focus them in any consistent manner for meditation. First, we must set in motion forces to take the mind from its disturbed \(rajasic\) or dull \(tamasic\) state to its natural clear quality \(sattva\). Mantra is the main practice for changing the nature of the mind from tamas and rajas to sattva. At the same time, it provides us the focus and energy for going beyond the mind.

## Mantra and the Main Branches of Yoga

Mantra is probably the main practice that characterizes Yoga as a whole and its many different branches. All yogic paths use mantras and have special mantras of their own. Special mantras and chants pervade the primary Yogas of knowledge \(Jnana\), devotion \(Bhakti\) and service \(Karma\) in which asana does not have an important role. Yet even in Hatha Yoga, where asana can be very important, mantra remains significant and is the main method employed to prepare the mind for deeper Yoga practices.

*The Yoga Sutras* and its tradition of Raja Yoga emphasizes the role of the Pranava,2 which literally refers to ‘primal sound’, and specifically to the mantra *Oṁ*, as the main means of connecting with the Divine or Cosmic Lord, Ishvara, the primordial guru of gurus in the Yoga tradition.3 Just like the Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras stresses the importance of chanting and meditating upon *Oṁ*, which is the essence of all the mantras. This means that mantra is the guiding power of Yoga, not just one of its many practices\!

*Bhakti Yoga*, the Yoga of devotion, centers on chanting, singing and the internal repetition of Divine names like *Namaâ Śivàya *or the *Hare Kêṣça *mantra are the best means of developing deep devotion and Divine love. In fact, the word of the heart is always mantra\!

*Jnana Yoga*, the Yoga of knowledge, focuses on prime Atmic or Self-revealing mantras like *So**’**haṁ*, ‘He am I” or the great sayings \(Mahavakyas\) of Vedantic philosophy. *Oṁ *is also important as the sound of the Self.4 Such mantras are the foundation for the meditation and Self-inquiry practices that characterize Jnana Yoga practice.

*Karma Yoga* involves an extensive performance of rituals, like pujas and yajnas, all of which have their accompanying mantras to empower and sanctify them. It includes various forms of service \(seva\) to others, which are best performed while repeating a mantra. Unless the mind is engaged inwardly in mantra, one may not be effectively practicing Karma Yoga even when performing service.

*Hatha Yoga* and Tantric Yoga use pranic mantras like *Hïṁ *to arouse the Kundalini and open the chakras. The fifty main Sanskrit letters form the petals of the chakras and serve to energize them. The Kundalini Shakti or inner power of Yoga is said to be composed of the letters or sounds of the Sanskrit alphabet and is primarily a higher mantric force.5 Kundalini is an electrical energy of speech at a deeper level of consciousness.

The practice of Yoga usually begins with the chanting of mantras, which may be mantras to the guru, to the aspect of the Divine one worships, or to the higher Self in order to create the proper atmosphere for teaching, or mantras to sanctify the ground on which one sits. Mantra grants sanctity and concentration to Yoga, which otherwise easily descends into another form of physical exercise or a seeking of personal empowerment.

## Mantra Yoga, Nada and the Yoga of Sound

Mantra Yoga reflects an entire ‘Yoga of Sound’ \(Shabda Yoga\). The Yoga of Sound formulates the supreme reality as Shabda Brahman or transcendent sound. This tradition goes back to the Vedas, where the entire universe is said to rest in a single imperishable sound. Aspects of this teaching continue in all the different branches of Yoga.6

The main insight behind the Yoga of Sound is that reality consists of vibration, which in essence is sound. Even the formless silent Absolute has its own vibration or Shabda but remains contained in itself, a kind of breathing without the breath as it were. This sound of consciousness is called the ‘non-elemental sound’7 as distinguished from the elemental sound that arises through the ether element. By going back to the reality of primal sound, we can return to the very heart of creation and reach the Absolute beyond time and space from which all creation arises. We can reach the state of silence or pure stillness that is total communication and complete unity.

The profound study of scriptures, which are manifestations of Divine sound, is included in the Yoga of Sound. True scripture is not the literal word of God in human language, but rather the expression of primal sound as mantra. The Sanskrit word for scripture or Veda is Shruti, which means what has been heard at the level of the spiritual heart. The true revelation is not mere words that one can read in a book. It is the mantra revealed in the state of awakened listening, which reveals the essence of truth.

The state of awakened listening serves to open the head or crown chakra, whose organ of reception is the ears. True mantra is not just about speaking but about listening. Unless one can listen to the spirit of the mantra, the mantra cannot reveal its secrets to us. To truly study the Divine Word is to dwell in the state of revelation, in which each object in the universe proclaims the highest reality. This is to be receptive to the aspect of the Divine Word that each thing symbolizes and expresses in its vibration.

A related yogic science in the Yoga of Sound is called Laya Yoga, the ‘Yoga of mergence’. This involves meditation on the inner sound current called nada, which arises when the mind becomes pure and clear. We can hear this vibratory sound if we close our ears and listen deeply with attentive awareness. Several types of nada exist. These are said to be like the sounds of a bell, a drum, a flute, the ocean or other sounds. Nada is the celestial music within us. We hear these sounds with our inner ear, the subtle counterpart of our gross organ of hearing. They reflect the sound of the cosmic intelligence inherent in space, which is the source of all knowledge.

Nada is the inner power behind the mantra. The outer mantra works to awaken the inner nada. Then the nada repeats the mantra, which is held in our inner sound current. The nada itself can assume the form of the mantra. This indicates that the mantra is resonating with our inner being. Several Tantric texts indicate that the real One method of Yoga is to concentrate on the sound current and allow it to take us into the Divine, as this is its natural movement, drawing our energy up the spine and out through the top of the head. Other systems of Yoga use a meditation on the sound current but reinforce it through the use of mantras, pranayama, asanas, devotional or knowledge oriented meditations. The sound current is emphasized in traditional Hatha Yoga, where it is an important means to enter into samadhi or the yogic experience of bliss.

To meditate upon the nada is not just to listen to or to repeat a sound. It is also to inquire into the origin of sound, to follow the sound current back to its origin. This is to inquire into the origin of our own consciousness, which itself is a manifestation of sound. It is to contact our inner Self in the spiritual heart from which the sound current arises.

All forms of spiritual music come under the Yoga of Sound if we follow their vibrations back to the Divine Word within us. This includes vocal and instrumental music in all their beauty and diversity. Music in turn may be allied with poetry, drama and dance. Poetry is a kind of verbal music. Drama is the enactment of poetry. Dance is its expression. The internal usage of music can energize the various chakras that reflect the music of our soul. Music therapy and now poetry therapy have entered into alternative medicine in the West. The Yoga of Sound shows how they can be integrated as a sadhana or spiritual practice bringing us to the state of Self-realization.

## Vedic Mantra Yoga

Yoga historically likely began with Mantra Yoga as its original form. The oldest yogic text and spiritual teaching coming out of India, the *Rigveda*, is primarily a teaching of Mantra Yoga. The *Rigveda* is composed of sacred chants like the Gayatri mantra to the Sun God designed to invoke the cosmic powers within us for their blessings and guidance. The Vedic ritual is based upon Agni or the ‘sacred fire’, which is regarded first of all as a power of Divine speech and mantra. This sacred fire, which is inwardly the power of speech, serves to invoke and manifest all the deeper powers of the psyche and the greater cosmos.

This Vedic Mantra Yoga is still accessible to us through learning Vedic chanting. Yet we should learn to use Vedic mantras along with the breath and meditate upon their profound meanings, if we want the deeper aspects of the Vedic Yoga to become clear to us.

## Tantric Mantra Yoga

Mantra is the prime practice of Tantric Yoga, particularly the use of bija mantras or single syllables like *Oṁ*, *Hrãṁ *or *Śrãṁ*. As Tantra consists of devotional worship of various Gods and Goddesses, particularly Shiva and the Devi, the name mantras and bijas of these deities have an important role within it. In Tantra, the mantra is the sound form of the deity that reveals its inner truths. Tantric texts contain many teachings on mantra and reveal many powerful mantras for all aspects of life.

Mantra is the Shakti, the Yogini or inner power of Tantric Yoga. Indeed Tantra is largely synonymous with mantra. Mantra is the teaching of Tantra, which is the inner technology of mantra. Most of the teaching in this book will be based upon Tantric Mantra Yoga approaches.

1 Mantra and mantra japa are commonly mentioned in many yogic texts as an integral part of Yoga. Many yogic texts like the Yogi Yajnavalkya and Vasistha Samhita contain explications of mantras, particularly the Gayatri mantra.

2 While Pranava, which means primal sound or vibration, usually refers to Oṁ, there are other Pranavas or prime mantras for different traditions like Huṁ for Shiva or Hrãṁ for Shakti.

3 Patanjali, Yoga Sutras, I.25-28.

4 As the famous Mandukya Upanishad which is based upon an explication of Oṁ.

5 Note the Garland of Letters of Sir John Woodroofe.

6 The most important figure in the Shabda Yoga tradition was the great poet and yogi, Bhartrihari, who lived more than 1500 years ago, and his important text on Sound Yoga, Vakyapadiya. He explained how learning the Sanskrit language itself could be a powerful form of Yoga practice.

7 "Abhautika shabda", Ganapati Muni refers to this type of sound that is inherent in pure consciousness beyond the sound produced in the element of space or ether.
