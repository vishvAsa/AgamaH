## The Powers of Manifestation

Consonants are the main powers through which sound is diversified and a variety of words, statements and expressions of ideas becomes possible. The twenty five consonants have their particular energetics as described in Sanskrit texts. However, there is less agreement on their overall correspondences than there is with the vowels.1 Consonants, owing to their diversity, allow for a broad range of meaning, which is also modified according to the vowels and other consonants they are conjoined with.

Each of the five sets of Sanskrit consonants \(guttural, palatal, cerebral, dental and labial\) consists of a hard sound \(*k, c, î, t, p*\) and its aspirated or h-form \(*kh, ch, tḥa, th, ph*\), a soft sound \(*g, j, á, d, b*\) and its aspirated or h-form \(*gh, jh, ḍh, dh, bh*\), as well as the corresponding n/m sound \(*è, é, ç, n, m*\). The aspirated forms are secondary sounds that are not commonly found in Sanskrit words \(with the exceptions of bh and dh\). They usually have a stronger or harsher energy, like ga meaning ‘to go’ versus gha meaning ‘to strike’. The n/m sounds are softer and more stabilizing in effect.

## Guttural Consonants

Guttural sounds made with the back of the throat have a strong contact in their production and a pointed energy in their expression. Relative to the guttural consonants, the Ka-sound serves to stimulate, originate, or set in motion, representing the initial point or impetus behind things. As the vowel-A is the first of the vowels and indicates unmanifest existence, the consonant-Ka as the first of the consonants indicates manifest existence, the prime energy of life. It relates to the primal forces of time, space, action, desire, motivation and identity and has a wide range of meanings.

Ka is sometimes identified with Prakriti or primal matter, other times with the Purusha or pure consciousness, though more often in its manifest form as the individual Self. It is connected to Lord Brahma, the Creator, and Prajapati, the lord of creatures. It represents origins, prime nature and the causative force. The letter-Ka often relates to the heart and sets in motion the prana of the heart.2 Other times it is related to water as the element of life.

Not surprisingly the letter-Ka is the most important consonant in Shakti mantras. Ka*ṁ *itself is the seed sound of desire \(Kama\), which is often related to the subtle or the causal body. The Ka-sound occurs in *Krīṁ* and *Klīṁ*, the basic Shakti powers of energization and attraction, the electric and magnetic energies behind the universe. In the variant of *Kuṁ*, it indicates the Earth, the Goddess, the altar, Kundalini, the fire in the Earth, the Divine child of Fire \(the deity Skanda\), even the planet Mars, the war God. It has a stimulating, deepening and sometimes agitating effect.

Kha is an intensification of Ka which relates to space but more in the manifest or circumscribed form. It occurs in the Upanishads as *Oṁ Khaṁ Brahma*, ‘*Oṁ *Space Absolute’3, which probably refers to the small space within the heart.

The Ga-sound indicates movement, expression, achievement, accomplishment, structure and order, much like the deity Ganesha to which it commonly relates. Ga in Sanskrit indicates to go, to get, to achieve, to express, to count and to control. It increases our level of skill, functionality, dexterity and expertise.

Chanting *Oṁ Gaṁ Ganeśāya Namaḥ *allows our work and action to move forward and to become properly applied in order to reach their goal. The letter-Ga also has its place in *Guṁ*, the mantra for the Guru, giving guidance and motivation but also granting weight, authority and preeminence. As the Sanskrit root Gi or Gay, it indicates singing, resonance, and the transformational movement of sound.4

Gha is an intensification of that energy which can be forceful or even violent. It is connected to the fierce forms of Shiva like Bhairava. The *Èa* \(ng\) letter occurs rarely and is mainly used to vibrate the energies of other guttural letters, drawing them deeper into the throat.

## Palatal Consonants

Palatal sounds have a soft and yet airy quality about them. Relative to the palatal consonants, the Ca-sound indicates motion, vibration, speed and emotional response. It is a feminine counter part of Ka, serving as a field to hold the forces of time, space and causation. We can contrast Ka as action with Ca as reaction or emotion. Ca is often connected to fierce Goddesses like Chandi, owing to the passion and emotion it can hold. It is also the seed sound of the Moon as Chandra. The Cha- sound adds more prana and rhythm, force and vibration to this movement, as in the word Chandas, the Vedic term for meter or prosody.

The Ja-sound indicates birth, production, speed and generation. Its most common mantric variation is *Jūṁ* \(pronounced Joom\), which grants a quick, vitalizing energy. The living soul is called Jiva, deriving from this consonant. The Jha-sound intensifies the meaning, creating a rush of energy like a waterfall \(jhara\). The *Éa* -sound is rare and serves mainly to hold the vibration of other palatal sounds.

## Cerebral and Dental Consonants

Cerebral and dental sounds are made by striking the tongue to the roof of the mouth or to the back of the teeth. The Ta and Da sounds of both cerebral and dental types represent the basic structural forces or building blocks of all things. Ta-sounds indicate movement along a horizontal plane, while Da-sounds indicate upholding a vertical energy. Ta-sounds carry such root meanings as to extend, to level, to cross, to strike, to propel, to flatten, lay down or to resist. Da-sounds carry such root meanings as to give, to control, to hold, to cut, to stand, to support, to divide, to apportion, even to bite. The Na-sound relates to bowing, moving, resonating, to a range, sphere or realm of expression.

The dental series \(*ta, tha, da, dha, na*\) provides more stability to this structuralizing expression, the cerebral series \(*îa, tḥa, áa, ḍha, ça*\) provides more energy to it but can be heavier and cruder in effect. In the Sanskrit language the dental series predominates, with the cerebral series rarely used except in the middle of words or as a modification of the dental series. The ta and da sounds reflect the beating of a drum and are used to mark, measure or create rhythm in Indian classical music.

Ta occurs in Tat, a mantric sound which means ‘That’, referring to the extension of the infinite space of consciousness. *Tḥa* as a sound or mantra relates to the Moon, Shakti and to the Goddess, as does sometimes Tha.

*Daṁ* is a seed syllable for self-control and for the guru Dattatreya, who combines the energies of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. In the form *Duṁ*, it relates to the Goddess Durga who has control of all the forces of nature as the great world Mother. Dha is the basis of words like *Dhāma* or Dharma that provide support and indicate the natural law or domain. Na is important for indicating negation, much like the word ‘no’ in English, but also relates to vibration and resonance as in the root *Nu*.

## Labial Consonants

Labials develop the expansive energy of the U-vowel vibration. They project force and energy and can be the strongest of the consonants. The Pa-sound indicates protection and power, both pushing out and drawing in. It is the sound of the male, the father, protector and provider. It is connected to the Purusha or higher Self. It holds such additional Sanskrit meanings as to drink and refers to water, perhaps connecting to the movement of the lips. Pha intensifies that energy, creating energy, assertion or even an explosive effect, becoming a weapon as it were.

The Ba-sound indicates circular expansion and development outward, being softer and rounder in its effect than Pa. The Bha-sound intensifies this with prana and indicates creation and manifestation in the broadest sense, being the basic sound of the world spheres \(lokas\) and their development. It projects a field of light. Mantras for the three worlds like *Bhu* and *Bhuvaḥ* are based on this letter.

The Ma-sound indicates the mother, the measure, the source, the origin and the end. As the last of the twenty-five consonants, it indicates dissolution. It draws things back to ourselves and helps us return to the source. Like the mother, it is softening, nourishing, cooling and calming to the body, mind and nervous system. It also refers to Self, mind and our internal nature.

Ma is very common in mantric formulas, not just as connected to the final or Anusvara but as indicating the mind, Self, heart and center. Sometimes the two consonants Ka and Ma are used to represent all the consonants, which fall between them in the order of the alphabet.

## Consonants in Combination

Consonants can be combined with vowels, semi-vowels or sibilants. Generally the A-vowel sustains the basic meaning of the consonant. Its value is mainly indicative. The I-vowel directs the meaning of a consonant along a particular line. The U-vowel gives the consonant more force and sustenance, setting it in motion in an expansive manner. For example, Ha refers to cast out, Hi to throw or cast in a specific direction, and Hu to ignite, expand and explode.

The semi-vowel La adds a stabilizing effect to consonants, while Ra adds a fiery energy. The sibilant Sa gives stability, while *Śa* and *Ṣa* have a softening or muting effect. Stha or Sta is a common Sanskrit and English root meaning to stand or be stable. Consonants can also combine and share their energies with each other in various ways.

## Consonant Mantras

Tantric Yoga practices use several consonant based mantras that are very powerful for stimulating our internal energies. These usually predominate in the semi-vowels and sibilants, rather than pure consonants with the exception of Ka and Ma. They create friction and heat. For example, the Bhairavi \(fire Goddess\) mantras, *Hsraiṁ Hsklrīṁ Hsrauḥ*\! Another example is *Árlkshaiṁ*, a powerful Dakini mantra. The Dakinis represent the specific Shaktis of the chakras, necessary for their individual activation.5 Such potentially harsh mantras require specific guidance in their application.

1 Shaivite texts correspond the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet to the prime principles or tattvas of existence. However, there is some variation in how these are presented and a good deal of complexity, so we will not take up the topic in this book. Notably, Kashmiri Shaivism and the Nandikesha Kashika \(and Mantra Yoga Samhita\) correlate them differently.

2 In some texts like the Yogini Hridaya Tantra, Mantra Samketa II.29, kaṁ is the bija mantra of the heart, not yaṁ.

3 Brihadaranayaka Upanishad V.1.

4 Oṁ in the Upanishads is called Ud-githa, the high chant or upward movement, as Sri Aurobindo explains in his commentary on the Upanishads.

5 Dakini, Lakini, Rakini, Kakini, Shakini, Hakini and Yakini are usually the Dakinis of the chakras from the root chakra up. Sometimes they are counted in a different manner, starting with Dakini in the throat chakra down to Shakini in the root chakra and up to Hakini and Yakini in the third eye and crown chakras. They are also correlated with the seven tissues of the body.
