title = "08 Semivowels and Sibilants: Powers of the Elements and the Pranas"

+++

The semivowels and sibilants are extremely important sounds in Yoga and Ayurveda. They connect to the primal forces of prana and the five elements, which in turn relate to the sensory qualities \(tanmatras\) sense organs, motor organs, and tissues of the body. In pranayama practices and in Kundalini Yoga, the sounds of the semi-vowels and sibilants are central. They help awaken our inner prana and dissolve the elements back into their seed powers allowing us to return to pure unity.

## The Four Semivowels

The semivowels represent a greater density of expression than the vowels from which they develop. The semivowels as intermediate sounds between vowels and consonants stand between spirit or consciousness \(vowels\) and matter or perceived objects \(consonants\). As such, the semivowels represent the five elements, which are the means through which spirit becomes matter and matter returns to the spirit. In this capacity, the semivowels govern the chakras, the energy centers through which consciousness takes form. The semi-vowels allow us to work on the corresponding faculties, powers and qualities that the chakras rule over. The sibilant Ha is added to the four semi-vowels to indicate the ether element.

+ 
The semivowel-Ya develops the movement, energy, direction, velocity and motivation, the Shakti of the vowel-I. This connects it to the air element.

+ 
The semivowel-Ra, like the vowel-Ŗ, reflects light and heat but on a level of greater density, indicating friction, combustion, conversion and transformation. This connects it to the fire element.

+ 
The semivowel-Va develops the vibration, flow, adaptability, receptivity and pervasive power of the vowel-U. This connects it to the water element.

+ 
The semivowel-La, like the vowel-Ļ, reflects form and creation but at a grosser level, giving density, shape and substance. This connects it to the earth element.


*Raṁ* and *Laṁ* retain the basic division of their vowel equivalents as male and female, right and left side, heaven \(fire\) and earth, intellect and emotion, mind and body. Yet sometimes *Vaṁ* takes this role opposite *Raṁ* as water and fire, left and right, female and male.

## Table of the Semi-Vowels in their mantric forms


1. Laṁ **–** v0   Energetic Inertia, density, formation, joy, grace Chakra Root – Muladhara   Deity Brahma, Creator Element Earth   Symbol Yellow square Tanmatra Smell   Sense Organ Nose Motor Organ Elimination/ Reproduction   Tissue Muscle Body Part Heart to palate/ lower abdomen   Organs Colon, reproductive\* and excretory systems Dosha Kapha   

\* The origin or root of the reproductive urge resides in the earth or root chakra while its expression or manifestation occurs in the water or sex chakra.




2. Vaṁ **–** w0   Energetic Vibration, flow, permeation, pervasion Chakra Sex – Svadhishthana   Deity Vishnu, preserver Element Water   Symbol White crescent moon Tanmatra Taste   Sense Organ Tongue Motor Organ Urination/ Reproduction   Tissue Fat Body Part Left side of chest   Organs Kidney, reproductive, pancreas, water metabolism Dosha\* Kapha   

\* The doshas are those of the respective elements ruling the chakras. However, diseases manifest through the weakness of the chakra mainly. So high Vata or air, for example, is usually reflected in disorders or weaknesses of the earth and water chakras.


3. Raṁ - u0   Energetic Heat, friction, coloring, digestion, ripening Chakra Navel – Manipura   Deity Rudra, Destroyer/transformer Element Fire   Symbol Red upward pointing Triangle Tanmatra Sight   Sense Organ Eyes Motor Organ Feet   Tissue Blood Body Part Right side of chest   Organs Liver, small intestine, digestive system Dosha Pitta   



4. Yaṁ - t0   Energetic Motion, direction, velocity, motivation Chakra Heart – Anahata   Deity Maheshvara, Cosmic Lord Element Air   Symbol Grey six pointed star Tanmatra Touch   Sense Organ Skin Motor Organ Hands   Tissue Plasma Body Part Heart   Organs Heart, circulatory system Dosha Vata   



5. Haṁ - y0   Energetic Expressive, expansive, diffusive, pervasive Chakra Throat – Vishuddha   Deity Sadashiva, transcendent form of Shiva Element Ether   Symbol Dark blue dot Tanmatra Sound   Sense Organ Ears Motor Organ Vocal cords   Tissue Prana Body Part Throat   Organs Lungs, respiratory system Dosha Vata   


The semivowels strengthen their respective element and chakra correspondences shown in this table. For example, the mantra *Yaṁ* can be used to strengthen the heart, skin, hands, plasma and air element. We will explore these connections relative to the Mantra Purusha.

## Other Indications of the Semivowels

*The semivowels have other indications and applications than their correspondences to the elements and chakras, and should not just be considered to be ‘the sounds of the chakras’.* We should be aware of their broader implications.

*Laṁ* is a sound of bliss or Ananda, which is the basis of creation. It indicates love, sweetness and play as in forms of the Goddess like Lalita \(She who plays\). As the sound made directly with the tongue, it indicates the tongue and the power of speech in general, particularly relating to singing and dancing. In this regard, the sound La can help set the Kundalini force in motion, drawing it into its upward dance. It can cause the earth within us to shake, move and release its hidden energy of consciousness through our entire being. It can also help awaken the bliss potential in the crown chakra.

*Laṁ* is prominent in many important Tantric mantras. It has the power to stop, hold or stabilize things opposite *Raṁ* which sets things in motion. It connects to watery and earthy qualities and to soft and feminine qualities. It is curious to note that there are sometimes two La sounds. The first is the ordinary dental sound La made with the tongue placed behind the teeth, which relates more to the earth element. The second is a cerebral sound, made with the tongue placed at the roof of the mouth, and is connected more to the higher power of speech. It is sometimes used instead of *Kṣaṁ* as the bija along with *Haṁ* for the third eye. However, these two aspects of the La sound are not always differentiated.

*Vaṁ* is a sound of vibration in general and can also be connected to the air element \(Vayu, Vata\). It has the power to pervade and permeate, and can relate to Vishnu as the Pervader. It holds the power of manifestation and the matrix of life. Like *Laṁ* it can increase bliss, beauty and happiness.

*Raṁ* is not only fire but also light and color. It occurs in many mantras in this context. It can create passion, energy, and delight.

*Yaṁ* is not only air but also direction, motivation, work and application, as in the terms Yama and Ni-yama of yogic thought. It serves to connect, regulate and control. *Haṁ* is not only ether but also prana and the Sun, projecting force and power. It is not a semivowel but a sibilant \(Sanskrit ushma\) but works along with the semivowels relative to the elements. Note its additional indications under the sibilants below.

## The Five S and H Sounds or Sibilants

The Vedas tell us that the Sa and Ha sounds govern the breath and relate to prana in general.1 We can observe this in ourselves; our breath has a natural hissing type sound and is released with a Ha-sound. Such pranic forces are the mythical serpents and dragons, which symbolize lightning and electrical energy. Through pranic mantras we can bring greater electrical energies into our minds and bodies.

According to Sanskrit etymology, the root Sa means to take in, to inhale, to energize, to hold, to take power, to sit, to rule, to endure, and to set in motion. The sound-Sa, therefore, is the natural sound of inhalation. Ha as a root means to give out, to exhale, to leave, to abandon, to negate, to ridicule, to cast out, to throw, and to ward off. The sound Ha, conversely, is the natural sound of exhalation. Quietly listen to your breath and you will discover that this is the case.

S*aṁ *in Sanskrit means to unite, concentrate or focus. It refers to being \(Sat\), stability and endurance. It represents the power of time, the eternal and sattva guna, the quality of balance and harmony. It creates unity, cohesion and concentration. It is often related to the Moon or even to the water element at an outer level.2 *Haṁ* on a broader level means to expand, invigorate and to shine. It refers to space and the infinite. It is prana in the higher sense of the term. It is often related to the Sun. We have already noted the existence of two Sha sounds in Sanskrit. *Śaṁ* is the more important of the two sounds. It is the seed sound or bija of peace, which is Shanti. It relates of Shankara, a main name of Shiva Mahadeva who is the giver or maker \(kara\) of peace \(sham\). *Śaṁ* is calming, harmonizing and balancing. It is generally cooling, slows us down and provides a sense of contentment. It means to quiet, stop, or dissolve, and also to beautify, shine, or diffuse. In this regard, we can relate *Śa* generally to the retention of the breath, just as Sa and Ha relate to inhalation and exhalation. *Śaṁ* is used in the Vedas to grant the blessings of the deities, particularly in Shanti mantras or Vedic peace chants.3 *Śaṁ* is also the seed sound of Shakti and not only quiets things, but does so with a degree of force. It can indicate to put to rest and so can mean to destroy. It can reflect the fullness of power.

S*aṁ *is like *Ṣaṁ* in meaning but has more energy and air in its production, making it is more stimulating and harsher, causing effort and resistance. It indicates the gathering of force and energy in a state prior to any manifestation or eruption. Like *Śaṁ*, it can be related to retention of the breath, but more in its later phase. In some Tantric teachings,4 the three sibilants are the sounds of the three gunas with *Saṁ* as sattva guna, *Śaṁ* as rajas and *Ṣaṁ* as tamas.

There is a fifth sibilant in some alphabet sequences, *Ksaṁ*, which is other times regarded as a compound of two letters K and *Ṣa*. It has a curious duality to its meaning. On one hand, it indicates patience, the ground, the Earth, forgiveness and endurance, which gives it some connection to Apana, the downward moving prana connected to the Earth. On the opposite side, it represents Shakti, turbulence, activity, setting things in motion. This second meaning comes out more when it combines with the vowel-U as in the root ‘*Kṣu*’.

These five sibilants energize our prana, directing the force of Shakti through the nervous system and the spine. Many Shakti mantras arise from them, particularly from the letters Ha and Sa. These sounds create heat and electrical energy, stimulating not only the breath but also the Kundalini Shakti. Ha and Sa together as in *Hsauâ* create a powerful sound for energizing the serpent power. The Sa-sound has a special combination with the Ta and Tha consonants, particularly in the root ‘Stha’ meaning ‘to stand’. Sa and Ta sounds connote stability and extension and are important in various mantras for this purpose.

At the highest level, the sibilants govern pure being, the Self or Brahman. This is their role as representing the immortal prana, which is the inner experience of ‘I am all’. Through contemplating them at a deep level, one can enter into pure consciousness, much like through an understanding of the vowels.

Below is a table of some of the common yogic correspondences, applications and meanings of the sibilants. They reflect a number of systems, considerations and correlations, including to the five Pranas, an important consideration in Ayurvedic medicine.
