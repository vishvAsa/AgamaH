title = "06 Mantra and Sanskrit, the Language of the Gods"

+++

When Sanskrit is called the ‘universal language’ or the ‘language of the Gods’, it is no mere exaggeration.1 Sanskrit reflects the primal sounds through which the entire universe is created, by which it is sustained, and into which it is eventually dissolved. These primal sounds of the universe are embodied in the Sanskrit letters.

Sanskrit is not just another human language invented for purposes of social convenience, but a cosmic language. The letters of the Sanskrit alphabet allow the human mind to interface with the primal energies of cosmic intelligence and receive its deeper insights. Sanskrit, as it were, allows us to think with the Gods as one of the Gods ourselves\! Through a right understanding of the Sanskrit alphabet, we can unite our individual Self with the universal Self, and regain our inner voice in the world of eternity.

Truly learning Sanskrit is not just a matter of learning another conventional language but of learning the very language of mantra. It is not a mere academic study or a means of improving communication, but an inner practice to create the foundation for Mantra Yoga.

Without a clear knowledge of the Sanskrit alphabet, the use of mantras becomes problematical and mispronunciations are likely to occur. We can compare the importance of knowing the Sanskrit alphabet in Mantra Yoga with the importance of knowing anatomy and physiology in asana practices. The Sanskrit alphabet helps us learn the ‘anatomy and physiology of sound’, through which we can move our subtle body with flexibility and grace.

The letters of the Sanskrit alphabet hold the primary sounds behind all other mantras. They are said to be the Matrikas, which means ‘prime measures’ or ‘mothers’. The Sanskrit letters are the mothers of our inner spiritual being, we could say\! The letters are the root forms of Shakti and bring her energy into our minds, hearts and bodies. Reciting the alphabet constitute a complete ‘mantric workout’ for all aspects of our mind, prana and senses. If we chant the Sanskrit alphabet with concentration and awareness, its letters can awaken the Kundalini force within us and transform our entire being.

The fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet form a list of important mantras that provide the keys to the sequence and layering of cosmic evolution. Once we know how these letters are created and their inner significations, we can use them to unravel the deeper meanings of all other mantras.

## Learning Sanskrit

Unfortunately, there seems to be a common idea that Sanskrit is an incredibly difficult language to learn. This is not at all the case, as a simple examination of the matter can quickly reveal. Sanskrit is a scientific and phonetic language that is logical and consistent in its pronunciation, spelling and grammar. It is easier to pronounce than English. Its script is much easier to learn than the Chinese characters and no more difficult than the Greek alphabet. Sanskrit grammar may be daunting, but it is not much more difficult than Russian grammar, and a knowledge of Sanskrit grammar is not required to use most mantras.

Learning the Sanskrit alphabet itself is not a difficult task and can be done in a weekend class if one is really serious. The Sanskrit alphabet is phonetic with one letter having one sound. English is much more variable in pronunciation, particularly in regard to vowels, with different letters sometimes pronounced in very different ways. Learning its fifty letters or fifty sounds is something anyone can do with a little effort and guidance.

Reciting the Sanskrit alphabet is not just an exercise in phonetics. Mantric recitation of the Sanskrit alphabet is an important method of balancing the mind. The Sanskrit letters can stimulate all the powers of the brain and the nervous system, improving our concentration, memory and perception on all levels. Chanting the Sanskrit alphabet is one of the main practices of Mantra Yoga and great depth can be brought into it. It is important not only for beginning but for advanced students of mantra.

However, to really use the Sanskrit alphabet as mantras, one needs to learn the inner power of the sounds, not just their outer pronunciation. We could say that anything that vibrates in the universe is chanting mantra and speaking Sanskrit, whether it is an atom, a human being or a star. Mantra is the very life blood behind all forms and processes in the world around and within us. The Sanskrit alphabet emulates these cosmic sound vibrations that we can connect to through a proper understanding and recitation of its letters.

## The Three Basic Types of Sounds

The Sanskrit language is based upon a clear understanding of the science of sound, which forms the basis for mantra practice. Sounds contain many secrets in how they are pronounced and impact our vocal cords and nervous system. Each sound strikes a different chord within us, we could say. There are three basic types of sounds that occur in all languages and are recognized in Sanskrit.2

1. 
The vowels, which are open sounds like the A-E-I-O-U of English. These are called svara in Sanskrit or ‘that which resonates’, as they are open sounds that can be drawn out.

2. 
The consonants, which contact based sounds like B, P or K in English. These are called *vyaéjana* in Sanskrit or ‘that which colors or articulates’. Consonants are closed sounds that are used to project the energy of the vowels in different directions.

3. 
The ‘intermediate principle’ of the semi-vowels \(Y, R, L, V\) and sibilants \(S, SH, H-sounds\) that partake of the qualities of both vowels and consonants. They can be lengthened like vowels or combined with consonants in their pronunciation.


Semi-vowels are called antahstha in Sanskrit or ‘what stands in between’, reflecting their meditating role between vowels and consonants. Sibilants are called ushma, meaning ‘what creates heat’, reflecting their connection with the sounds of the breath.

The Sanskrit alphabet is phonetically based, with each letter corresponding to a single sound. Sanskrit letters, therefore, are always specific sounds. Sanskrit letters are named after the letter plus the short-A vowel like Pa for what in English we would call the letter-P. They are regarded as syllables, of which there are fifty,3 which are divided into these three groups:
**1. Sixteen Vowels - Svara**   A, À, I, Ã, U, Ï, Ê, Ë, Ä, Å, E, Ai, O, Au, Aṁ, Aâ   
e‰ P‰ f‰ Q‰ g‰ R‰ W‰ Ø‰ X‰ v¦‰ h‰ :‰ i‰ ;‰ e8‰ e7   **2. Four Semivowels and Five Sibilants or Nine Intermediate Sounds – Antahstha/ Ushma**   Ya, Ra, La, Va; Śa, Ṣa, Sa, Kṣa, Ha   
t‰ u‰ v‰ w‰ 5‰ 6‰ x‰ â‰ y   **3. Twenty Five Consonants or Five Groups of Five**   **Five Guttural Consonants – **Ka-varga   Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Ça   
j ‰ <‰ k‰ =‰ Y   **Five Palatal Consonants – **Ca-varga   Ca, Cha, Ja, Jha, Éa  
l‰ >‰ m‰ ?‰ Z   **Five Cerebral Consonants – **Îa-varga   Îa, Tâa, Áa, Dâa, Ça   
2‰ ṁ ‰ 3‰ A‰ 4   **Five Dental Consonants – **Ta-varga   Ta, Tha, Da, Dha, Na   
n‰ @‰ o‰ A‰ p   **Five Labial Consonants – **Pa-varga   Pa, Pha, Ba, Bha, Ma   
q‰ BÈ‰ r‰ C‰ s   


Each type of sound has spiritual and yogic implications. Vowels represent consciousness, Spirit, the Shiva principle in Tantric thought, and the Indra principle in Vedic thought.4 Vowels are the essence of sound and vibration, continuous, independent and enduring in their resonance. You can take any vowel and intone it indefinitely. Many powerful Sanskrit seed mantras like *Oṁ* and *Aiṁ* are vowel predominant for this reason. They allow our energy to open, expand and ascend to higher levels.

Opposite in nature to vowels, consonants represent matter or nature, Prakriti or the Shakti principle through which all manifestation arises.5 Consonants serve to focus the pure sound quality of the vowels into particular forms or directions. Consonants are contact based and require a vowel in order to express them. Try pronouncing a word that consists of consonants only. It is not possible. While consonants allow for a definitive expression, they also create illusion as sound becomes limited. While vowels represent eternal powers, consonants are the forms which manifest in the limited field of time, though they can reflect higher qualities.

There are not many consonant dominant bija or seed mantras in Sanskrit but many begin with consonants like the mantra *Klãṁ*. Consonants help focus our thought and energy. Most words are consonant based as they allow for a greater structure, complexity and intricacy of sound and meaning. Longer mantras, prayers and hymns are more consonant based and bring in a greater diversity and specificity of meanings, while vowel mantras hold a more primal and general affect.

The sibilants and semi-vowels are said to represent the five elements and the pranas in Tantric thought, and Prajapati or the creative principle in Vedic thought.6

They stand between vowels and consonants in their properties and between consciousness and form, or Spirit and Nature, at a cosmic level. They are widely used in bija mantras.

## Pronunciation of Sanskrit Vowels

Sanskrit has both short and long vowels. Long vowels are an extension of the short vowels and are counted as twice as long in terms of their metrical value. They usually expand the energy of the sound outwardly.

The Sanskrit A-vowel is pronounced deep in the back of the throat, like the English sound ‘a’ in as ‘another’. It vibrates the neck, lungs, heart and body, drawing the energy down and in. The long Sanskrit À-vowel is pronounced like the ‘a’ sound in ‘father’ and requires a much more significant opening of the throat.

The Sanskrit I-vowel is pronounced in the middle of the mouth, like the vowel sound in the word ‘pin’, and vibrates the head, brain, senses and mind, holding the energy in the center and allowing it to move upward from there. The long Sanskrit Ã-vowel is like the ‘ee’ sound in ‘need’.

The Sanskrit U-vowel is pronounced with the lips and vibrates the face or the outer manifestation, like the u-sound in the world ‘flute’, directing the energy outward in an implosive manner. The long Sanskrit Ï-vowel is like the ‘oo’ sound in ‘mood’, literally shooting our energy outward.

Sanskrit recognizes four compound vowels brought about by the combinations of the basic A, I, U sounds. A \+ I equals E at the first level and Ai at the second level. A \+ U equals O at the first level and Au at the second level. The two sounds Ai and Au, therefore, represent the final result of all the Sanskrit vowel sounds.

For compound vowels, the Sanskrit E-vowel is pronounced like the English sound in ‘came’. The Sanskrit Ai-vowel is made like the English sound in the word ‘aisle’. These longer vowels serve to open the mouth more, particularly in its middle part of the palate. The Sanskrit O-vowel is much like the English in ‘yoke’. The Sanskrit Au-vowel is much like the English in ‘ouch’. These grant the largest opening of the mouth and lips of all the vowels.

Sanskrit Ê is a soft-R as in the English word ‘macabre’. Its long form Ë is the same but held longer. In chanting the alphabet, however, the vowel-R sounds are usually rendered by the sounds ri and rã, though with the soft r–sound. In Sanskrit pronunciation in South India, ê is more commonly pronounced ru and in North India, it is commonly pronounced re.

The Sanskrit Ä is a soft-L as in the English word ‘table’. The long vowel-Å is the same sound held longer. In chanting the alphabet, however, they are usually rendered by the sounds lri and lrã , though rendered with a soft and liquid pronunciation. These long forms are rarely found in actual words but do serve to fill out some mantric correspondences. They do not occur in many Sanskrit and Hindi fonts for this reason. Sanskrit recognizes two special sounds in the field of the vowels that are actually the seeds of other sounds. They represent two distinct manners of vibrating or closing the vowels and the throat. The aṁ and aâ vowels are seeds of the M and H-sounds. They can follow after any vowel but as letters of the alphabet are written with an antecedent short-A vowel and classified among the vowels.

Aṁ, called Anusvara or the ‘means of resonance’, consists of drawing the vowel sound down into the throat, then nasalizing the vowel sound, and finalizing closing it with a lip sound of ‘mmm’. This is the sound that we find at the end of mantras like Oṁ. It is generally transliterated as an ṁ with a dot on top \(sometimes at the bottom\).

Anusvara is often represented as the English letter-M, though it is more complex. It is like the seed of the M-sound, and as M is the last of all the Sanskrit consonants, Anusvara carries the power of all the consonants with it. Sometimes it is represented as the letter ‘ng’ in English, owing to its vibration in the throat, though this is not strictly correct either. It can actually stand for any of the Sanskrit Na or Ma sounds in consonant combinations.

Aâ, called Visarga or the ‘means of release’, is an aspirated repetition of a final vowel created by adding a short or quick h-sound to it, as in ‘namaha’. Often it is not marked in the transliteration of words. Sometimes it is marked by an H-sound, though it is a soft H that repeats the vowel, not a hard aspirated H-sound. We can understand it as the seed of the H-sound.

Visarga pushes the energy out or opens it and is connected to expression, expansion and realization. It is opposite the Anusvara in its effects, which is connected to dissolution and mergence. It is generally translated as an H with a dot below it *Â*.

## Pronunciation of Consonants

The Sanskrit language contains twenty-five consonants, organized in five groups relative to the location in the mouth where they are produced.
1\) The Ka-series is the gutturals, pronounced in the throat   2\) The Ca-series is the palatals, pronounced in the palate   3\) The Îa-series is the cerebrals, pronounced at the roof of the mouth   4\) The Ta-series is the dentals, pronounced behind the teeth   5\) The Pa-series is the labials, pronounced with the lips   


Each series of five consonants contains a hard sound \(*ka, ca, îa, ta, pa*\) and a soft sound \(*ga, ja, áa, da, ba*\) both of which can come in additional aspirated \(H-sound\) forms \(*kha, cha, îha, tha, pha*\) and \(*gha, jha, dâa, dha, bha*\). Each series also each have a corresponding N or M sound \(*èa, éa, ça, na, ma*\). The cerebral and dental are originally one series, the dental being the primary. That is why dentals change into cerebrals in certain sound combinations, while cerebrals rarely start any words.

Guttural letters like Ka and Ga are pronounced much like their English equivalents. They are made in the back of the throat and represent a deep or primal level of thought, feeling and sensation, affecting the vital nature, prana, the senses, and the subconscious mind. The gutturals show our pranic urges and impulses in life.

Palatal sounds use the back palate of the mouth. Of the palatal sounds, Ca is pronounced like the ‘ch’ in ‘church’, while the Sanskrit Cha is pronounced like the sound in the English word ‘itch’. Ja is pronounced like the English equivalent. They are made in the upper middle of the mouth with the help of the tongue. They are softer sounds than the gutturals and have more motion to them. This often gives them an emotional force and creative or generative power.

Cerebrals \(*îa, tâa, áa, dâa, ça*\) are made at the roof of the mouth, like the T in ‘true’. They have a denser and more interiorized sound than their corresponding dentals. Dentals \(*ta, tha, da, dha, na*\) are made by the striking action of the tongue on the back of the teeth, like the T in ‘tip’. They are hard contact sounds and project a certain force. They resemble the beats of a drum, *ta-ta-ta, da-da-da*. Cerebrals and dentals give stability and form.

Labials \(*pa, pha, ba, bha, ma*\) require the movement of the lips. They are the most outward sounds made at the front of the mouth. They have a bursting or explosive effect like the blowing of bubbles. They allow us to express our energies into the external world, having a productive action to bring things into form. They are generally equivalent to our English sounds like P, B and M.

The aspirated forms of the consonants are the hardest for English speaking people to pronounce \(*kha, gha, cha, jha, tâa, dâa, tha, dha, pha, bha*\). The simplest way to do this is to first pronounce the unaspirated letter followed by a short–a sound and then the ‘ha’ sound. For example, first pronounce ‘kaha’. Then try to shorten and remove the first vowel sound ‘kha’.

## Pronunciation of Semi-Vowels and Sibilants

Sanskrit semi-vowels are equivalent to the English letter, Y, R, L, V. Ya derives from the vowel-I and is palatal in nature. Ra is cerebral and is a hard rolled r-sound, a bit like the Spanish-r, as opposed to the soft unrolled r-vowel. La is dental, made with the tongue hitting the back of the teeth. Va is labial or made with the lips \(usually pronounced like an English-w when it occurs after another consonant\).

In the Tantras, the semivowel mantras of *Laṁ, Vaṁ, Raṁ *and* Yaṁ *relate to the four cosmic elements of Earth, Water, Fire and Air. The rule is that the semi-vowels govern the elements because the elements mediate between the formless realm of Spirit \(vowels\) and the formed realm of matter \(consonants\).

You will notice that you can hold the sibilant sounds H, S or Sh almost indefinitely like a vowel. You can hold the S-sound, like a hissing sound, longer than other consonants. Sibilants are usually placed in the same intermediate series of sounds as the semi-vowels, though sometimes they form a separate fourth category.

The sibilants are of the same nature as the breath and can be equated with Prana and its manifestations. They have more versatility in their combinations than other consonants. Sa is a dental sound, made by the tongue behind the teeth. *Ṣa* is a cerebral sound \(like Vishnu\) or the English word ‘ship’. *Śa* is a palatal sound \(like Shiva\) or the English word ‘shut’. *Kṣa* is a guttural sound combining Ka and *Ṣa*. Ha is as in the English letter-H. Though a sibilant, *Haṁ* is also said to govern the element of Ether and is used along with the semi-vowels for the chakras, though elsewhere it is connected to prana.

## Turning the Alphabet into Mantras

A final *ṁ*-sound, the Anusvara, is added to each of these letters to make the Sanskrit letters into seed mantras like *Aiṁ*. In the case of consonants, semi-vowels and sibilants, the short a-vowel is added as well, like *Kaṁ, Yaṁ *or* Saṁ*. It is possible to recite the letters without the final Anusvara, but it is less common in the case of mantric usage. That is why in the following chapters the letters will usually be represented with the Anusvara. The Anusvara helps to draw the sound of the letter deeper into the head and into the mind.

1 Note Judith Tyberg's, Language of the Gods.

2 Sometimes only two typeyauns of sounds are recognized in Sanskrit, the vowels and consonants, in which case semi-vowels and sibilants are also classified as consonants.

3 The Sanskrit vowels are 16 in number, which is the number four squared. The semivowels and sibilants are 9, which is the number three squared. The constants are 25, which is the number five squared. If we add up these numbers, we get the number 50, which contains the key laws of manifestation. These are a few of the many mathematical connections which the Sanskrit letters have.

4 As discussed in Chandogya Upanishad II.22.

5 The principle of death, Mrityu or limitation in the Upanishads and Vedas \(Chandogya Upanishad II.22\). However, in some Tantric traditions, vowels are made into the Shakti principle and consonants into the Shiva principle as the Shiva principle cannot express itself without Shakti and is inert without her.
