title = "12 How to Use the Mantra Purusha"

+++

The Mantra Purusha has many important applications relative to meditation, Yoga therapy, and Ayurvedic medicine. Like the human body overall, it can serve as a blueprint for the forces of the greater universe. This chapter will explore a number of the most important usages.

## Reciting the Alphabet through the Mantra Purusha

The simplest way to use the Mantra Purusha is to recite the entire Sanskrit alphabet starting with the letter-A at the top of the head, directing our prana and attention to each mantra location along the way. This serves as a complete mantric workout of the entire body and its pranic field. You can touch the respective bodily locations as well.

## To Strengthen Particular Locations in the Body

Mantra Purusha sounds work on their respective organs and body parts. If we wish to strengthen any of these sites, we should repeat their respective mantras while focusing on bringing prana to the location.

We can use the mantra points on the head to improve their related functions through the mind and senses. We can use the Mantra points on the arms and legs to treat their respective joints. We can use the Mantra points on the abdomen and chest to strengthen the corresponding internal organs.

For example, the Mantra *Aṁ* can be repeated while focusing on the point at the top of the head in order to strengthen our primary prana, sense of Self and power of deeper awareness. The mantra *Iṁ* can be used to strengthen the eyes, the sense of sight and our power of perception, judgment and discrimination. The mantra *Uṁ* can be used to improve our inner and outer sense of hearing, receptivity and overall comprehension. We can use the long form of the vowels to target the left side of the body. We can also use them to address the powers of the mantra location overall because *the long forms of the vowels create stronger resonance*. For example, we can use the long vowel *Ãṁ* to strengthen the sense of vision overall.

The mantra *Kaṁ* can be used to strengthen the right shoulder, arm, overall strength of the body and power of action. The mantra *Caṁ* can be used to strengthen the left shoulder, arm, overall responsiveness of the body and power of emotion. The same logic can be extended to all the bodily parts, organs and tissues represented by the Mantra Purusha sounds.

## Mantra Purusha and Asana Practice

We can use Mantra Purusha mantras during asana practice to focus our attention on the particular joints or body parts that they indicate. One can use the Mantra Purusha sounds for the arms while extending the arms in order to increase the attention and pranic flow through the arms, for example.

+ 
*Oṁ Kaṁ, Khaṁ, Gaṁ, Ghaṁ, Èaṁ *for the right arm to hands.

+ 
*Oṁ Caṁ, Chaṁ, Jaṁ, Jhaṁ, Éaṁ *for the left arm to hands.


Similarly, one can use the Mantra Purusha sounds for the legs while extending the legs or while holding a standing pose in order to increase the pranic flow through the legs.

+ 
*Oṁ Îaṁ, Tâaṁ, Áaṁ, Dâaṁ, Çaṁ *for the right hip to the right foot.

+ 
*Oṁ Taṁ, Thaṁ, Áaṁ, Dhaṁ, Naṁ *for the left hip to the left foot.


Another powerful method is to go through all the sixteen mantra points on the head while in a sitting pose, doing pranayama and meditation to clear the energy of the head one point at a time. One can press or touch these mantra locations during the process.
Oṁ Aṁ Top of head Oṁ Àṁ Middle of forehead   Oṁ Iṁ Right eye Oṁ Ãṁ Left eye   Oṁ Uṁ Right ear Oṁ Ïṁ Left ear   Oṁ Êṁ Right nostril Oṁ Ëṁ Left nostril   Oṁ Äṁ Right cheek Oṁ Åṁ Left cheek   Oṁ Eṁ Upper lip Oṁ Aiṁ Lower lip   Oṁ Oṁ Upper teeth Oṁ Auṁ Lower teeth   Oṁ Aṁ Upper palate Oṁ Aâ Lower palate   


## Mantra Purusha and Pranayama

We can use the Mantra Purusha sounds to hold the prana at their respective locations. For example, one can repeat the mantra *Ãṁ* along with the breath in order to bring the prana into the eyes. Or, one can repeat the mantra *Kaṁ* along with the breath, while focusing on the right shoulder, to bring more energy into that location. The same principle can be extended to all Mantra Purusha sounds and their respective locations. In addition, we will examine mantra and pranayama in a separate chapter, and show how to use the sibilants and semivowels relative to the breath in order to modify its energies.

## Mantra Purusha and Pratyahara

We can use the Mantra Purusha sounds to withdraw the mind and prana to the locations indicated by the sounds.* In fact, the recitation of the Mantra Purusha overall is mainly regarded as a pratyahara method.* It helps us draw our awareness and prana into the body and through these points into the chakras. It helps us withdraw from body consciousness and consecrate our body as a vehicle of Divine consciousness. To do this is a matter of releasing any tension that may have accumulated at any of the Mantra Purusha locations, which can be done on exhalation. By relaxing all these mantra points, we can relax the body, prana, senses and mind.

## Mantra Purusha and Dharana

We can use the Mantra Purusha sounds to hold the mind at their respective locations. This requires that we have developed a power of attention already. If we have done this, the Mantra Purusha sounds can be very important dharana locations. Holding our attention will stabilize the prana at the locations we focus on. This can be more easily done if we use the gaze to direct our attention, directing the vision to these points inwardly \(not necessarily looking at them outwardly\!\).

For example, one can use the sound *Aṁ* to hold one’s attention at the top of the head, to link and stabilize our body and awareness in the Absolute. Or one can hold the attention at any point that one wants to improve, like using a dharana of the mantra *Kaṁ* to strengthen the right shoulder. Dharana of any Mantra Purusha point will bring healing energy to that location. For example, Dharana of the ears along with the mantra *Ïṁ* will help heal the ears and open up higher powers of hearing. Pranayama, pratyahara and dharana of these mantra points can go together for a stronger effect.

**Mantra Purusha with *Namaâ*, and *Svàhà***

We can add other mantras to the Mantra Purusha sounds to give them more power or to vary their effects. We can chant the Mantra Purusha mantras after *Oṁ* in order to clear and energize them. After the Mantra Purusha mantras, we can chant *Namaâ*, the mantra of consecration, in order to stabilize their energy or *Svàhà*, the mantra of energization, in order to stimulate it further. Examples:

• *Oṁ Aṁ Namaâ*, to stabilize the energy at the top of the head.  
• *Oṁ Aṁ Svàhà*, to increase the energy at the top of the head.  
• *Oṁ Ãṁ Namaâ *to stabilize the energy in the eyes.  
• *Oṁ Ãṁ Svàhà*, to stimulate the energy in the eyes.

## With Shakti Mantras

We can combine the Mantra Purusha sounds with Shakti mantras to bring about different effects at particular locations in the body and brain. This is probably the most important approach to use.

One method is to use a single Shakti mantra while reciting the entire Mantra Purusha, focusing on the respective parts of the body. This allows us to bring the power of the Shakti mantra and its specific energies to the entire body and pranic field. Note the following example:

• *Hrãṁ Aṁ *\(top of head\), *Hrãṁ Àṁ *\(front of head\), *Hrãṁ Iṁ *\(right eye\), *Hrãm Ãṁ *\(left eye\), *Hrãṁ Uṁ *\(right ear\), *Hrãṁ Ïṁ *\(left ear\), *Hrãṁ Êṁ *\(right nostril\), *Hrãṁ Ëṁ *\(left nostril\), *Hrãṁ Äṁ *\(right cheek\), *Hrãṁ Åṁ *\(left cheek\), *Hrãṁ Eṁ *\(upper lip\), *Hrãṁ Aiṁ *\(lower lip\), *Hrãṁ Oṁ *\(upper teeth\), *Hrãṁ Auṁ *\(lower teeth\), *Hrãṁ Aṁ*, \(upper palate\) *Hrãṁ Aâ *\(lower palate\)

• *Hrãṁ Kaṁ *\(right shoulder\), *Hrãṁ Khaṁ *\(right elbow\), *Hrãṁ Gaṁ *\(right wrist\), *Hrãṁ Ghaṁ *\(right base of fingers\), *Hrãṁ Èaṁ *\(right fingertips\)

• *Hrãṁ Caṁ *\(left shoulder\), *Hrãṁ Chaṁ *\(left elbow\), *Hrãṁ Jaṁ *\(left wrist\),* Hrãṁ Jhaṁ *\(left base of fingers\), *Hrãṁ Éaṁ *\(left fingertips\)

• *Hrãṁ Îaṁ *\(right leg\), *Hrãṁ Tâaṁ *\(right knee\), *Hrãṁ Áaṁ *\(right ankle\),* Hrãṁ Dâaṁ *\(right base of toes\), *Hrãṁ Çaṁ *\(right tips of toes\)

• *Hrãṁ Taṁ *\(left leg\), *Hrãṁ Thaṁ *\(left knee\), *Hrãṁ Daṁ *\(left ankle\), *Hrãṁ Dhaṁ *\(left base of toes\), *Hrãṁ Naṁ *\(left tip of toes\)

• *Hrãṁ Paṁ *\(right abdomen\), *Hrãṁ Phaṁ *\(left abdomen\), *Hrãṁ Baṁ *\(lower back\), *Hrãṁ Bhaṁ *\(navel\),* Hrãṁ Maṁ *\(lower abdomen\)

• *Hrãṁ Yaṁ *\(plasma\),* Hrãṁ Raṁ *\(blood\),* Hrãṁ Laṁ *\(muscle\),* Hrãṁ Vaṁ *\(fat\),* Hrãṁ Śaṁ *\(bone\),* Hrãṁ Ṣam *\(nerve\),* Hrãṁ Saṁ *\(reproductive\),* Hrãṁ Haṁ *\(prana\),* Hrãṁ Kṣaṁ *\(mind\)

In this practice, one brings the power of *Hrãṁ*, the Divine light and prana of the heart, to the entire body, filling the body with light. It is also possible to repeat each mantra more than once, for example, three times: *Hrãṁ Aṁ*, *Hrãṁ Aṁ*, *Hrãṁ Aṁ*; *Hrãṁ Àṁ*, *Hrãṁ Àṁ*, *Hrãṁ Àṁ*; *Hrãṁ Iṁ*, *Hrãṁ Iṁ*, *Hrãṁ Iṁ*, and so on through the entire alphabet and Mantra Purusha. This creates a stronger practice.

Another method is to focus on a single Shakti mantra relative to a particular point in the body and its Mantra Purusha sound. This provides many options to explore. A few examples:

• *Hrãṁ Aṁ *– to stimulate the flow of prana at the top of the head

• *Hrãṁ Yaṁ *- to stimulate the flow of prana to the heart

• *Klãṁ Yaṁ *– to promote contentment and happiness, the inner energy of water and Ojas, in the heart

• *Śrãṁ Aṁ *– to cool and nurture the energy of consciousness at the top of the head.

• *Krãṁ Kaṁ *– to stimulate the energy, work capacity and pranic flow at in the right arm.

• *Hïṁ Bhaṁ *– to increase the energy of fire and stimulate the region of the navel.

• *Strãṁ Maṁ *- to bring the feminine energy to the lower abdomen.

## Mantra Purusha Kavacha

A Kavacha is a special protective field created by the mantra, of which there is a great variety in yogic texts. The most common Shakti mantra for this purpose is *Hïṁ* because it reflects the power of protection and wards off negativity.

One can use the *Hïṁ* mantra with each letter of the Mantra Purusha in order to create a protective shield around the body, strengthen the immune system and ward off negative emotions. This Mantra Purusha Kavacha is one of the longest and most powerful. For this, one focuses the mind or touches the particular bodily part while reciting the mantra.

*Oṁ Aṁ Hïṁ, Oṁ Àṁ Hïṁ, Oṁ Iṁ Hïṁ, Oṁ Ãṁ Hïṁ *and so on through the alphabet.

## Combinations of Shakti Mantras with the Mantra Purusha

Combinations of Shakti mantras bring about yet more powerful effects to the Mantra Purusha. These are a more complex and deeper level of practice. Examples:

• *Hrãṁ Śrãṁ Klãṁ Aṁ Aṁ Aṁ Aṁ *– to increase the flow of grace, contentment and healing power at the top of the head.

• *Hrãṁ Krãṁ Hïṁ Aṁ Aṁ Aṁ Aṁ *– for purification, cleansing, heating and protection at the top of the head.

The Mantra Purusha sounds for the tissues, elements and chakras are particularly useful and can be modified in the same ways. Note the following examples:

• *Oṁ Yaṁ Śrãṁ Namaâ *- to bring the lunar, water or Kapha energy into the plasma and heart chakra.

• *Oṁ Yaṁ Krãṁ Namaâ *- to stimulate the flow of prana through the plasma and the heart chakra.

• *Oṁ Yaṁ Hïṁ Namaâ *- to stimulate heat, fire and the Agni of the plasma and to promote sweating.

• *Oṁ Yaṁ Hrãṁ Namaâ *– to stimulate the circulation from the heart through the plasma and lymphatic system.

## The Mantra Purusha with Your Primary Mantra

Whatever your primary or personal mantra may be, you can recite it relative to the Mantra Purusha. For example, if *Namaâ Śivàya *is your main mantra, you can chant it with every letter of the alphabet and location of the Mantra Purusha:

*Oṁ Aṁ Namaâ Śivàya, Oṁ Àṁ Namaâ Śivàya, Oṁ Iṁ Namaâ Śivàya*, *Oṁ Ãṁ Namaâ Śivàya*, and so on throughout the Sanskrit alphabet and the Mantra Purusha locations.

In this way, you can use the power of your personal mantra to consecrate your entire being. Or you can direct your primary mantra specifically to certain locations in the body that you want to emphasize or that may be sites of pain or disease.

The recitation of the alphabet is most commonly connected with the deities Ganesha, Sarasvati and Matangi, the Tantric form of Sarasvati, who is sometimes regarded as a female counterpart of Ganesha. For example, relative to Ganesha, one can chant his bija *Gaṁ* and his name relative to each letter and its Mantra Purusha correspondences.

*Gaṁ Aṁ Gaçeíàya Namaâ, Gaṁ Àṁ Gaçeíàya Namaâ, Gaṁ Iṁ Gaçeíàya Namaâ,* and so on throughout the alphabet.

This ‘Ganesha Mantra Purusha’ will help remove obstacles and obstructions, including physical and psychological diseases in every part of the body and mind. It can cause Ganesha to appear in the form of your own body\!

## Mantra Nyasa – The Mantra Purusha  
as a Consecration of the Entire Body**

Nyasa is a common practice in Hindu devotional rituals. Nyasa mainly consists of mantras, but rituals, gestures and mudras are often combined with them. Nyasa can also be a kind of Prana-pratishta or ‘installing the prana’ or spirit of the deity into the body. Through it, we make the prana of the deity our own prana. Nyasas relate mainly to Bhakti Yoga, in which we consecrate ourselves to a particular deity.

The Mantra Purusha in Yoga is most commonly used as a Nyasa, which is a means of consecrating the body to the deity or the higher Self. In this procedure, one recites the Mantra Purusha while dedicating each corresponding part of the body to the deity or the higher Self. It is a process of spiritualizing one’s body and taking us beyond body consciousness.

The Mantra Purusha is the main form of Nyasa for the entire body. It is also called the Matrika Nyasa or the consecration of the letters of the alphabet. There are shorter Nyasas for only the five fingers or the six main parts of the body, as well as Nyasas for the planets, directions, Nakshatras, and other factors that are performed regularly as part of Hindu pujas. Even if we are using the Mantra Purusha for health purposes, we should remember its sacred nature as a Nyasa.

To get these mantras to really work requires that we have developed concentration of mind and prana. Just knowing the right mantras for particular body parts is not itself enough. However, we can also use these mantras to help develop such concentration.
