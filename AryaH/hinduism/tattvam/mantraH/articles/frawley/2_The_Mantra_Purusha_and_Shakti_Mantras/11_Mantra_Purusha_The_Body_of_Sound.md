title = "11 Mantra Purusha: The Body of Sound"

+++

Besides our gross, form-based physical body, we have another subtle energy body made up of sound. Our higher Self or inner being, the Purusha of yogic thought, is connected to the physical body through this body of sound. Mantra Yoga contains a very important teaching through which we can harmonize this body of sound to insure the right flow of energy into the physical body. Each of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet corresponds to a certain portion of the physical body called the Mantra Purusha, the Cosmic Being or Person \(Purusha\) made of mantra.

This subtle body of sound vibration relates to the mental body1 and to the subtle or astral body in general, the site of the seven chakras. It creates and sustains the physical body, supporting health and well-being within it. Through changing the frequencies of the subtle body of sound, we can bring healing into the physical body and remove negativities from the mind. For this reason, the Mantra Purusha is an important method of Mantra Therapy as well as a means of opening our higher awareness. It is perhaps the best mantric tool for Ayurvedic medicine.

## Structure of the Mantra Purusha

The Mantra Purusha relates the primary groups of sounds as vowels, consonants, semi-vowels and sibilants to particular regions of the body. First, we will present the most simple and direct set of correspondences. Then we will present the details in a second set of tables.

+ 
The sixteen vowels relate to the sixteen main regions and faculties in the head, including the senses.

+ 
The twenty five consonants relate to the main joints on the arms and legs \(five per arm and leg\) and the five regions of the abdomen.

+ 
The nine semivowels and sibilants relate to the tissues and primary constituents of the body, from the plasma to the mind.

## Mantra Regions and Marma Points

In the Mantra Purusha, each letter of the Sanskrit alphabet functions as a ‘locational indicator’ for a particular part of the body. These ‘mantra regions’ often reflect special marma or ‘energy regions’ used in Yoga and Ayurveda. Marmas are not simply points, like acupuncture points, but zones that can extend from half an inch to four inches \(finger units\) in size. Marmas are discussed in many Ayurvedic texts, so we ask the reader to consult these for more details on their names, locations and usage.2

Many Mantra Purusha regions correspond to classical marmas. In other instances, they relate to secondary or less commonly used marmas. In some instances, Mantra Purusha sounds cover a larger region than marmas and can be correlated with more than one set of marmas. This ‘mantra-marma’ connection is very important for healing purposes and one of the most significant applications of mantra, particularly at a physiological level.

Mantra Purusha regions also relate to certain nadis or subtle channels, which have their openings or apertures at their locations, like the right eye and the Pusha Nadi, which ends there. They reflect the psychological and spiritual faculties and energies associated with their bodily locations. Similarly, the Mantra Purusha sounds correlate with the qualities of their respective letters in the Sanskrit alphabet, as already described.

In the more elaborate version of the Mantra Purusha below, I have added specific marma regions for each sound, as well as psychological effects, nadi and organ correspondences. In the case of the sibilants and semivowels, I have added their energy flows along the body. The semi-vowels govern the regions around the heart, while the sibilants govern energy flows from the heart to the extremities of the body. Note the appendix for more detail on how the Mantra Purusha sounds connect with classical marmas.
