title = "10 Shakti Bija Mantras"

+++

Besides the mantric power of letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, there is another series of powerful bija or single-syllable mantras, which consist of several vowels or consonants. These come under the term ‘Shakti mantras’, as they are commonly used in the worship of Shakti, projecting various Shaktis or types of cosmic energies. *Oṁ* is usually the foremost of these Shakti bija mantras. With it there are said to be eight total such primary bija mantras, with *Aiṁ*,* Hrãṁ, Klãṁ, Krãṁ, Śrãṁ, Trãṁ, *and* Strãṁ*, as mentioned in the Mantra Yoga Samhita.1 They are several more such mantras that are commonly found in bija mantras, particularly to the Goddess. We have examined most of these below.

*Shakti bija* mantras are probably the most important of all mantras, whether for meditation, worship of deities, energizing prana or for healing purposes. They carry the great forces of Nature such as the energies of the Sun and Moon, Fire and Water, electricity and magnetism, not simply as outer factors but as inner potentials of Divine Light. They project various aspects of force and radiance for body, mind and consciousness. They hold, resonate, and propel the Kundalini force in specific and transformative ways. Below is a simple table of the main energies \(Shaktis\) of the Shakti mantras.

## Prime Shakti Mantras
Pranic energy Oṁ Energy of sound Aiṁ   Solar energy Hrãṁ Lunar energy Śrãṁ   Electric energy Krãṁ Magnetic energy Klãṁ   Power of fire Hïṁ Power to stop Hlãṁ   Power to stabilize Strãṁ Power to transcend Trãṁ   


Shakti mantras relate to the primary forms of the Goddess or Divine Mother and are commonly used in her worship. There are special Shakti mantras for each of the great Goddesses, through which we can commune with them and gain their grace. Shakti mantras are prime mantras used in Tantric Yoga, in which they are combined in various ways to bring about different results. They have a great capacity for transformation that can extend to the deepest layers of our consciousness and prana. They should be approached with deep concentration, reverence and respect as the very life blood of the Goddess.

Most Shakti mantras contain the vowel-Ã, the vibratory ee-sound, which is the main primal sound of Shakti. Most contain the consonant-R, which is the seed of fire, heaven, light, order and dharma and has a stimulating and energizing effect. Some contain the consonant-L, which is the seed of earth, water, joy and bliss and has a calming and stabilizing effect. Many begin with either the letter-H, which indicates prana, light and the Sun, or the letters S or Sh, which indicate the Moon, the mind and water. Some like *Auṁ*,* Aiṁ *or* Ãṁ *consist of vowels only.

## Application of Shakti Mantras

Shakti mantras can be used to create, sustain or dissolve various forms, patterns and forces within us. They have particular affinities with certain locations in the body or with specific chakras – like *Hrãṁ* and the heart – but also have a broader effect to promote certain types of forces, like *Hrãṁ* as solar energy that can be applied on many different levels.

The application of Shakti mantras, like other mantras, depends upon the goals of life that we are using them for \(dharma, artha, kama, moksha\), which gunas we are energizing them with \(sattva, rajas, tamas\), or their application through Yoga, Ayurveda, Vedic astrology or Vastu. In this way, the same Shakti mantra can be used in many different applications. Yet at the deepest level, Shakti mantras are meant to arouse and support the Yoga Shakti or inner power of Yoga within us.

For example, the mantra *Śrãṁ* at an outer level connects us to the abundance of our dharma and artha, our career and financial gains, and the fulfillment of our kama or desires. For Yoga practice, it grants devotion to guru and deity. In Ayurveda, it promotes healing, growth, and nourishment. In Vedic astrology, it is the mantra of the Moon and can be used for strengthening benefic Venus and Jupiter as well. In Vastu, it promotes well-being, prosperity and happiness in the dwelling.

Used with a sattvic intention, *Śrãṁ* has a nourishing and harmonizing force; with a rajasic intention, it has a power to promote outer development and achievement; and with a tamasic intention, it can gain a destructive or crushing capacity. At an outer Lakshmi \(Goddess of Prosperity\) level, *Śrãṁ* can grant us the abundance of the material world; while at an inner Lakshmi level, it can grant us the abundance of the spiritual life, which is devotion, bliss and the beauty of perception.

***Oṁ**** *and *Auṁ**** *– i0** **/ ;0**

*Oṁ* is the prime mantra of the Purusha, the Cosmic Being, the Atman or higher Self. As such, it attunes us with our true nature and higher reality. *Oṁ* is the sound of Ishvara, the cosmic lord, the creator, preserver and destroyer of the universe, who is also the inner guru and prime teacher of Yoga. It reflects both the manifest and the unmanifest Brahman, sustaining the vibration of being, life and consciousness in all worlds and all creatures.

Generally, *Oṁ* is divided threefold as A, U and M, with A referring to creation, the waking state and Brahma, the creator; U as sustenance, the dream state and Vishnu the preserver; and M as dissolution, the deep sleep state and Shiva the transformer. More specifically, *Oṁ* relates to Shiva, the cosmic masculine force.

*Oṁ* serves to open and clear the mind for meditation. It brings about an ascension and expansion of our energy. It promotes the higher prana and inner light and takes us into the formless realm. It draws the sound current up the spine, through the chakras and out the top of the head. *Oṁ* also means ‘yes’ and is said to be the sound of assent. It allows us to harmonize with the forces of the universe externally and with our own nature internally. It attunes us to the cosmic reality and the sacred vibratory patterns that arise from it.

*Auṁ* has the same general effects as *Oṁ* but with a greater force and prana, particularly for drawing our energy upwards. *Oṁ* extended becomes *Auṁ*, which has greater power to expand and pervade, allowing the Divine consciousness to permeate all things.

Relative to Ayurvedic medicine, *Oṁ* helps harmonize the body, prana, mind, and senses with the higher Self, Atman or Divine presence within. It connects us with the cosmic healing prana. It brings a deep healing energy into the subconscious mind to remove negative emotions, addictions and compulsions. Relative to Vedic astrology, *Oṁ* is the sound of the Sun and of the higher light behind all the stars and planets. In Vastu, *Oṁ* can clear the energy in the home or dwelling and bring in Divine light, grace, and knowledge.

Relative to other mantras, *Oṁ* is often used to begin them. It clears the mind for other mantras to work, opens us up to the higher consciousness, and brings a deeper prana into the mantra. Without first chanting *Oṁ*, it is said that other mantras may not be effective. Whole Upanishads and entire books have been written about it.

***Aiṁ**** *– :0**

After *Oṁ*,* Aiṁ *\(pronounced ‘aym’\) is the next most common bija mantra. *Aiṁ* is the feminine counterpart of *Oṁ* and often follows *Oṁ* in various chants. *Oṁ* and *Aiṁ* are the two main compound vowel mantras, A plus U making *Oṁ* \(and *Auṁ*\) and A plus I making *Aiṁ*. As such, together they comprehend all sounds.

As *Oṁ* is the unmanifest or expansive aspect of primal sound, *Aiṁ* is the manifest or directed form. As *Oṁ* serves to clear the mental field, *Aiṁ* helps us focus the mind and heart in a particular manner. As *Oṁ* is the word that is heard, *Aiṁ* is the word that is seen. As *Oṁ* is the supreme Purusha or cosmic masculine force, *Aiṁ* is Adya Shakti, the supreme Shakti or cosmic feminine force. That is why we find the mantra *Aiṁ* in so many different mantras to the Goddess or Divine Mother.2

More specifically, *Aiṁ* is the seed mantra of Sarasvati, the Goddess of knowledge and speech, the consort of Lord Brahma, the Creator in the Hindu trinity of great Gods. As such, *Aiṁ* aids us in learning, art, expression and communication and is good for promoting learning and education generally.

*Aiṁ* is also the mantra of the guru and helps us access all higher knowledge. It can be used to call or to invoke wisdom and understanding. It indicates motivation, direction and will-power. It can orient us toward whatever we are seeking. It increases concentration of mind and awakens our higher intelligence \(Buddhi\). Relative to other mantras, *Aiṁ* is often used to direct our awareness or intention to the deity, to function as our call to draw in the higher knowledge so the mantra can work.

In terms of Ayurveda, *Aiṁ* strengthens the voice and the vocal chords. It helps open the lungs and clear the senses. Astrologically, *Aiṁ* connects to the planet Mercury and to some extent the Moon, both planets that govern speech and expression. For Vastu, *Aiṁ* will bring creativity and learning into the dwelling, particularly for studies, libraries and classrooms.

***Hrãṁ**** *– .¢ 0**

After *Oṁ* and *Aiṁ*,* Hrãṁ *\(pronounced ‘hreem’\) is probably the most commonly used bija mantra. It is composed of the sound-Ha, which indicates prana, space and light, with the sound-Ra, which indicates fire, light and dharma, and the sound-*Ã*, which indicates energy, focus and motivation.

*Hrãṁ* is the prime mantra of the Goddess in all of her three main powers of creation, preservation and destruction, and so is the main Shakti mantra, with a more specific application than *Aiṁ*. It is said to be the Shakti bija and to be equivalent to *Oṁ* for the Goddess. More specifically, it relates to Parvati or Shakti, the consort of Shiva, who is the destroyer/transformer among the great trinity of deities.

*Hrãṁ* is a mantra of magical force, captivation and empowerment. It can be used relative to any deity or object whose presence we wish to access at the level of the heart. It brings about joy, ecstasy and bliss. *Hrãṁ* both purifies and exalts us in our inner quest, humbling us before the Divine power so that it can enter into our hearts. *Hrãṁ* is a specific mantra for the heart \(hridaya in Sanskrit\) on all levels, whether the spiritual heart, the heart chakra, the emotional heart or the heart as a physical organ. It energizes the heart, provides warmth, and allows for both deep feeling and deep thought.

In terms of Ayurveda, *Hrãṁ* can be used to counter heart disease of all types, aiding in longevity and rejuvenation. More specifically, it helps promote the pranic and functional aspect of the heart and with it the power of circulation of the blood, the lungs and the nervous system. It has generally Pitta \(fiery\) energy but some Vata \(air\) energy as well, stimulating the higher pranas and emotions. In terms of Vedic astrology, *Hrãṁ* relates to the Sun, the planet of the heart, and helps promotes solar energy, expression and charisma.

*Hrãṁ* is usually a soft mantra but can also be harsh. As a soft mantra, it increases the finer energies of the heart. As a harsh mantra, it can be used to hypnotize or captivate, to dissolve or carry away.

***Śrãṁ**** *– è¢ 0**

*Śrãṁ* \(pronounced ‘shreem’\) is one of the most commonly used mantras because it is probably the most benefic of all sounds, drawing to us all that is good, helpful and promoting of positive growth and development. More specifically, *Śrãṁ* is the seed mantra of Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and abundance, and the consort of Lord Vishnu, the preserver in the Hindu trinity of great Gods, and brings Lakshmi’s many blessings. *Śrãṁ* is also called ‘Rama bija’ and is used in the worship of Lord Rama, the avatar of dharma.

*Śrãṁ* is the mantra of faith, devotion, refuge and surrender. It can be used to take refuge in or express devotion to any deity, helping us to gain its favor and grace. *Śrãṁ* relates to the heart in its feeling aspect, whereas *Hrãṁ* relates to the pranic or functional aspect of the heart.

*Śrã* means splendor in Sanskrit, like the beautiful light of the Moon. *Śrãṁ* is often used along with *Hrãṁ*. As *Hrãṁ* is solar, *Śrãṁ* is lunar. *Śrãṁ* relates to the Moon in Vedic astrology and promotes a kind of lunar energy, Soma and beauty overall. Yet it is also used for other benefic planets like Venus and Jupiter, promoting their positive energies.

Relative to Ayurveda, *Śrãṁ* is mainly a Kapha \(watery and earthy\) mantra for improving health, happiness, fertility, love and calmness of mind. Yet it does have some secondary Pitta \(fire\) qualities and improves our glow, luster and light. It is particularly important for women’s health and brings proper function and circulation to the female reproductive system. *Śrãṁ* has a soothing effect on the mind and emotions, allowing us to surrender to Divine grace and take refuge in the higher powers.

***Halãṁ and Halrãṁ* - yv¢ 0 /** **yÿ¹u¢0**

*Halãṁ* \(pronounced ‘hleem’\) is a derivative of *Hrãṁ* which replaces the fiery and stimulating Ra-sound, with the watery and stabilizing La-sound, bringing the seed sounds of space \(Ha\) and earth \(La\) together. As *Hrãṁ* serves to energize and direct the power of prana, *Halãṁ* serves to hold and stabilize it.

Applied at a soft level, *Halãṁ* is a mantra of ecstasy and joy, a sound of Ananda \(bliss and ecstasy\). Applied at a harsh level, which is its most common usage, *Halãṁ* serves to neutralize or destroy. *Halãṁ* holds the Sthambhana Shakti or the power to stop things, particularly to stop subtle energies that have already been set in motion. In this regard, *Halãṁ* relates to the Goddess Bagalamuki among the ‘Ten Wisdom Goddesses’ \(Dasha Mahavidya\), who helps us restrain any negative speech that is directed against us. It is also called Raksha bija or the ‘seed sound of protection’ and can be used to seal off our energy from negative influences.

*Halãṁ* grants control of the body, senses, mind and prana, which it brings to a state of stillness. As such, it is an important mantra for the practice of Yoga. It helps us to stop the prana from its ordinary agitation and so aids in pranayama. It helps us to stop the mind and so is called Brahmastra, the ‘weapon of Brahman’ that puts all thought to rest. However, *Halãṁ* can be strong and should be used with care. Yet it is often better to slow down one’s energies with Shanti or peace mantras before trying to bring them to an immediate halt, which this mantra can do.

Relative to Ayurveda, *Halãṁ* can be used to slow down and stop excess speech or pranic movement. In astrology, it has primarily a Saturn and Rahu influence to stop things but also a Mars influence to neutralize negativity.

*Halrãṁ* combines the Ha, La and Ra sounds: the sounds of space, earth and fire. It has yet more energy to remove negativity than *Halãṁ*, though it is not as effective in slowing things down. It projects the Kundalini force as a weapon to protect us from unspiritual influences.

***Krãṁ*** **- OÈ¢ 0**

*Krãṁ* \(pronounced ‘kreem’\) is the first and most important of the consonant mantras, the mantras that begin with a hard consonant rather than a vowel or sibilant. *Krãṁ* begins with Ka, the first of the Sanskrit consonants that indicates manifest prana and the initial phase of energy. To this it adds the Ra-sound or seed of fire, the *Ã*-sound or focusing power as in the other Shakti mantras. It creates light and intention like *Hrãṁ* and *Śrãṁ* but of a more specific, stimulating, and manifesting nature.

*Krãṁ* relates to Vidyut Shakti or the basic electrical energy behind all things in the universe – the Kriya Shakti or power of action on all levels. *Krãṁ* rules over all manifestation including time, space and action \(causation\). Through it, we can gain control of our karmas and also move beyond them.

*Krãṁ* is the seed mantra of Kali, the Goddess of time and transformation, the consort of Lord Shiva, the Destroyer/Transformer in the Hindu trinity of great deities. Through it, we set Kali’s power in motion within us. It serves to energize things to the highest level, which is to raise their level of vibration to the point where we can return to the source.

*Krãṁ* is a mantra of work, yoga and transformative energy, and is said to be Yoga bija or the ‘seed syllable of Yoga practice’. Its inner application is to awaken the Kundalini Shakti to merge our outer nature back into the higher Self. *Krãṁ* stimulates higher perception and higher prana, promoting the yogic process of pratyahara \(internalization of mind\) and giving greater power to concentration, meditation and Samadhi. The mantra can connect us with the inner power of any deity we wish to connect to.

In terms of Ayurveda, *Krãṁ* combines Vata \(wind, electrical\) energy with Pitta \(fire\) for an adrenaline type effect. It has a powerful electrical force and stimulates all the pranas and Agnis \(biological fires\), the circulatory and nervous systems, particularly the heart and the liver. In Vedic astrology, *Krãṁ* relates primarily to the planet Mars, which is the planet of work and effort. *Krãṁ* is generally a harsh or strong mantra, particularly as used with *Hrãṁ*, and so should be recited with care.

***Klãṁ**** *– Dyha**

*Klãṁ* \(pronounced ‘kleem’\) is the softer, watery or more feminine aspect of *Krãṁ*. As *Krãṁ* is electrical or projective, *Klãṁ* has a magnetic quality that draws things to us. It can also be used to hold or fix things in place.

*Klãṁ* carries the Akarshana Shakti or the ‘power of attraction’. It relates to Krishna, who grants bliss \(Ananda\) as a deity, and to Sundari, the Goddess of love and beauty. *Klãṁ* is the seed mantra of desire \(Kama Bija\) and helps us to achieve our true wishes in life. *Klãṁ* can be used relative to any deity we would like to access to fulfill our wishes. *Klãṁ* is the mantra of love and devotion, increasing the love energy within our hearts. For this reason, it is one of the most benefic mantras, and one of the safest and most widely used.

Relative to Ayurveda, *Klãṁ* is mainly a Kapha \(water\)-promoting mantra and is particularly good for the reproductive system and for the plasma and skin. It promotes Kledaka Kapha \(the digestive fluids of the stomach\), increasing our capacity for nourishment. Most importantly, it is specific for Tarpaka Kapha, the Soma of the brain that promotes well-being, soothing the nerves and calming the heart. It strengthens the immune system and brings contentment to the entire being. *Klãṁ* is not specifically an astrological mantra, but is sometimes used for Venus or the Moon. For Vastu, it can bring the energy of Divine love and beauty into the dwelling. *Klãṁ* can have a harsh side as well. It can be used to fix, to stop or to nail down, or to hold things under the power of wishes, though such usage is not as common as its benefic application.3

***Strãṁ** and **Trãṁ*** **– ¼G\{ 0 /** **G¢ 0**

*Strãṁ* \(pronounced ‘streem’\) contains the Sa-sound of stability, the Ta-sound which gives extension, and the Ã-vowel that provides energy, direction and motivation. It is connected to root meanings such as to stand, to spread, to take a step, to rise or traverse from one level to another. It brings about an expansion and spreading of energy that can follow a horizontal expansion, a vertical ascent, or a spiral movement. *Strãṁ* is said to be Shanti bija or the ‘seed syllable of peace’ and carries the Shakti of Sat or Pure being. *Strã* in Sanskrit also means a woman. The mantra *Strãṁ* provides the power of the Divine feminine \(Stri-Shakti\) to give birth, to nourish, to protect and to guide. It is similar to *Śrãṁ* in sound qualities but stronger and more stabilizing in its effects. It can be used to increase Shakti or feminine energy in oneself or in one’s outer activity.

*Strãṁ* is another general mantra of the Goddess, particularly in her higher knowledge form. *Strãṁ* can be used relative to any deity whose energy we wish to expand or project in a creative manner. It grants poetic and artistic powers, as well as powers of argument, debate and law.

*Strãṁ* is the seed mantra of the Hindu Goddess Tara \(not the Buddhist Tara, who is a different deity approached with different mantras\). Hindu Tara is connected to Durga, who is often called Durga-Tara, as a protective and fiery form of the Goddess. She is the high priestess and represents the inner knowledge and the insight of the guru, particularly the power of the Word. Tara controls the weapons of the Gods, particularly the Trishula or trident of Lord Shiva. Tara also relates to the mantra *Oṁ*, and *Strãṁ* is the means through which *Oṁ* takes us across all difficulties.

Tara in astrological symbolism is the wife or feminine form of Brihaspati, the planet Jupiter. She is the great star Goddess associated with the star Aldeberan \(the Vedic star Rohini\), the bright red star of the constellation Taurus. As Brihaspati/Jupiter is the high priest or guru of the Gods, Tara is the high priestess of the heavens. *Strãṁ* as the mantra of the Star Goddess attunes us to the benefic powers of the stars and Nakshatras and gives us astrological knowledge.

In terms of Ayurveda, *Strãṁ* is important as a healing and empowering mantra for women, and can aid in childbirth and can promote women’s health generally, strengthening the heart, reproductive system, circulatory system and bones.

*Trãṁ* \(pronounced ‘treem’\) is another version of the Tara mantra, but more specifically a mantra of Tejas or fire. Without the Sa-sound, it has more an energy of crossing over and ascending. Tri relates to the number three in Sanskrit and to the bridging of dualities. *Trãṁ* is also the seed mantra of the Trishula, the trident of Lord Shiva, which is his most powerful weapon.

The mantra *Trãṁ* is good for taking us across difficulties and overcoming inimical forces. It has a strong Pitta \(fire\) energy and also allows us to ascend in awareness. It is said to be the sound of Tejas, or the subtle essence of Pitta, which relates to valor, courage, daring and fearlessness. Otherwise, its indications are similar to that of *Strãṁ*.

***Huṁ** and **Hïṁ**** *– y£0** **/ y¤0**

*Hïṁ* \(pronounced ‘hoom’\) is one of the most important Sanskrit mantras along with *Oṁ*,* Aiṁ *and* Hrãṁ*. It is said to be the Pranava or primal sound of Lord Shiva, the transformative aspect of the Divine Trinity.

*Huṁ* \(short vowel as in fl*u*te\) is the main Agni or fire mantra and can help enkindle fire in all of its forms from the digestive fire to the Pranic fire to the fire of the consciousness. It refers to a gaseous type of fire and so can be connected with lightning and to the power of prana and the breath. *Huṁ* is also a weapon and protection mantra and can be used to destroy negativity with its lightning fire. It can used to direct a fiery explosive energy with other mantras. It is also called Krodha bija or the ‘seed sound of wrath’. It is the mantra that Lord Shiva uses to project the fire from his third eye that destroys all negativity and burns up all desires.

*Hïṁ* with a long vowel sound has a similar meaning but a more feminine and Shakti quality. It relates to fierce forms of the Goddess like Kali, Chandi and Chhinnamasta. It has the power to cut off and indicates the sword. However, *Hïṁ* has a soft potential as well. It is said to be the Dhenu bija, the ‘seed sound of the Mother cow’, calling its calf back to it. It calls out and invokes, while at the same time challenging and warding off. Both the long and short versions of this mantra *Huṁ* and *Hïṁ* are used for raising the Kundalini, particularly combining the mantra with the breath, and the fixing of the gaze at the navel, the seat of the digestive fire.

Relative to Ayurveda, both *Huṁ* and *Hïṁ* increase Prana, Tejas and Pitta, setting all our fiery energies in motion from the digestive fire to the fire of the mind. Both strengthen the immune system particularly against any active pathogenic attacks, but as harsh mantras require some care in application.

Astrologically, *Huṁ* and *Hïṁ* relate to fiery planets like the Sun, Mars or Ketu and increase their fiery properties. They are particularly good for bringing in the higher perceptive power of Ketu, which is a great aid in astrological research, spiritual healing and Yoga. Relative to Vastu, they can be used to create a protective energy shield around one’s dwelling.

***Hauṁ** and **Hoṁ**** *– yª 0 /** **y© 0**

*Hauṁ* combines the *Auṁ* sound with the Ha-sound, which gives strength and prana to the Divine Word. *Hauṁ* is an important mantra for Shiva and for the highest prana. *Hauṁ* can be regarded as an expansion of *Hïṁ* and carries similar powers. *Hauṁ* develops and expands our energy and awareness and has a revitalizing effect. It is one of the most powerful mantras for reviving a person’s prana or mind, helpful even when the life is in danger.

*Hoṁ* is a related bija mantra with a similar meaning, but not quite as expansive in energy. It gives strength, both prana and Ojas \(vital essence of Kapha\) and so is a powerful healing sound.

***Sauṁ** and **Sauâ**** *– xª 0 /** **xª7**

*Sauṁ* combines the *Auṁ* sound with the Sa-sound, which gives stability and strength to it. *Sauṁ* indicates Shakti, particularly as the original power of existence, Sat-Shakti. *Sauṁ* relates to Soma and the Moon, the mind and the principle of bliss or Ananda. In fact, it means ‘what relates to the Moon’ \(Soma\) and strengthens the lunar flow of energy within us.

The form *Sauâ* has more an expressive energy. It is the prime heart mantra in the tradition of Kashmiri Shaivism, where it refers to the highest reality and can be as important as *Oṁ*.* Sauâ *allows the nectar of Soma from the crown chakra to flow into the heart. It promotes contentment and happiness in the brain and nervous system. In this function, it is widely used in Shakti mantras, particularly those of a lunar nature, like that of the Goddess Sundari, *Aiṁ Klãṁ Sauâ*, opening up the region of the Moon and the descent of the Soma. It is sometimes called Shakti bija or the sound of Shakti because of its power to get Shakti to move.

***Hasauâ**** *– yxª7**

This mantra combines the sounds *Hau* and *Sau* into a single mantra. It is very powerful for energizing the inner prana and electrifying the nervous system, stimulating the Kundalini Shakti. *Hsauâ* is like the hiss of a serpent, stimulating the prana of the senses, mind and nervous system. It is strongly revitalizing but can be disturbing, if not applied in a calm state of mind.

***Duṁ** and **Dïṁ**** *– o£0** **/ o¤0**

*Duṁ* \(pronounced short as in fl*u*te\) is a Durga mantra, projecting the energy of the protective form of the Divine Mother who saves us from difficulties. It is another powerful Agni or fire mantra like *Huṁ* with a weapon like effect. Whereas *Huṁ* creates an airy or pranic type of fire, *Duṁ* creates an earthy type of fire, like burning wood. It can be used to eliminate sorrow, obstacles or barriers. It has a martial energy to overcome opposition and grants self-control and self-discipline as well. Durga is the head of the Divine army, one should note, riding a lion, whose power this mantra sets in motion.

*Dïṁ* with the long vowel sound has a similar meaning and usage but a more feminine quality. It is more commonly used in Shakti mantras. These mantras can neutralize any negative force projected at us. Relative to Ayurveda, they strengthen the digestive fire and can be used to burn away toxins or Ama, working more at a tissue level. In astrology, Durga holds a solar energy, particularly as directed to the earth, and her bija can help bring out the feminine aspect of solar energy.

***Ãṁ**** *– Q0**

*Ãṁ* is the prime bija mantra of the older Vedic tradition in the *Rigveda*, said to be the Vedic Pranava or primal sound before *Oṁ* became predominant in that role. *Ãṁ* indicates the power of seeing, ruling and directing power. It illumines, indicates, energizes and transforms. It represents the eyes in the Mantra Purusha, but extends to inner powers of vision, discrimination, visualization, creation and imagination.

In terms of Shakti mantras, *Ãṁ* is the mantra of the central point or bindu of the famous Sri Yantra diagram, where it is repeated twice as *Oṁ Ãṁ, Ãṁ Namaâ*, which is said to be like a streak of lightning.4 It grants all the special powers of Sri Yantra, which extend to the crown chakra and the entire cosmic structure. We will discuss this mantra more under Vedic mantras.

## Special Single Letter Shakti Mantras

There are instances in which mantras include a series of letters, without the closing Anusvara or *ṁ*-sound. Most common in this regard is the famous Panchadashi Mantra, said to be the most powerful of all the Shakti mantras and existing in several variations.5 It relates to the Goddess as Tripura Sundari, to the crown chakra and the full scope of the Sri Yantra and Sri Chakra worship of the Goddess, which is one of the most important Tantric Yoga practices.6 Entire sadhanas are built around it and its variant forms.

*Ka E Ã La Hrãṁ, Ha Sa Ka Ha La Hrãṁ, Sa Ka La Hrãṁ*

## Other Important Bija Mantras

***Glauṁ**** *– ¯vª 0**

*Glauṁ* is a special bija mantra for Ganesha. It takes the sacred *Auṁ* bija and adds the Ga-sound, the power of movement and accomplishment, along with the stabilizing and harmonizing energy of the La-sound. As such, *Glauṁ* holds and deepens the *Auṁ* vibration, allowing it to expand our being without a loss of focus. It helps remove obstacles and clear our path so that we can move forward with the mantra *Gaṁ*, the other prime Ganesha mantra.

***Kṣrauṁ**** *– Áuª 0**

*Kṣrauṁ* relates to Narasimha, the Man Lion that is the main fierce or protective form of Lord Vishnu, who is usually worshipped in benefic forms like Rama or Krishna. The sound has the power to twist, crush and uproot negativity. It is usually used in a harsh sense to purify the ego and reduce the animal desires within us.

***Ràṁ**** *– uŸ0**

*Ràṁ* \(pronounced with the long a-sound as in father\) is the mantra of Lord Rama, God in his protective, saving and compassionate form. The mantra provides warmth, rest, relaxation, comfort, happiness and joy. It relieves fear, agitation, pain and suffering. It is particularly good for calming children and helping them sleep, reducing Vata dosha and its nervous energy. It opens the higher light and power within us but in a way that is gentle, kind and compassionate.

Note that this is a different mantra than *Raṁ* \(short-a\) indicating the fire element as *Ràṁ* has a long-Ā vowel, which softens its fiery energy.

***Mà**** *– sŸ**

*Mà*, which means mother, is an important Shakti mantra for invoking the Devi or Divine Mother, *Śrã Mà *or* Śrã Màtaji*. The sound *Mà* has a soothing, softening and nurturing effect upon us, drawing the Divine Feminine grace into our lives. It helps us let go of anger and aggression, conflict and hatred. It allows us to surrender to the Mother and her love. Yet it can also help improve our emotions, calm the mind and give greater mental powers. Some devotees simply chant *Mà Mà Mà Mà *to energize their devotion and open the heart. It has a Kapha, mothering energy on our physiology, increasing growth and nourishment within us.

## Additional Sounds to Bija Mantras

Several special mantric sounds are often used along with bija and Name mantras for greater power or for certain effects.

**Astra or Weapon Mantra:* **Huṁ Phaî Svàhà* -** **y0 £ B È2 ÿ ¼wŸyŸ**

Astra means a weapon, particularly something that is thrown, like a spear. This Astra mantra uses the short vowel form of *Huṁ*, which is specifically an Agni or fire mantra. The bija *Phaî* takes this mantric fire energy and directs it, like a strike to remove negative forces. *Svàhà* gives additional fire energy. Often the longer vowel form *Hïṁ* is used instead of *Huṁ*, particularly relative to Shakti Mantras. In Yoga practice relative to the chakras, the Astra mantra serves to dissolve the gross elements into the subtle, taking us back to pure unity. It purifies and removes the ego and all of its weaknesses.

On a health level, the astra mantra creates a weapon for destroying negative forces in body and mind. In the body, it can be used to counter pathogens, toxins or excess doshas. It stimulates the immune system to cleanse the body, much like an elevation of body temperature helps burn away toxins. In the mind, it wards off negative emotions, particularly those directed to us by others on a subconscious level, including the forces of anger, jealousy and envy.

The Astra mantra is added to the mantras for Tara \(*Oṁ Hrãṁ Strãṁ Hïṁ Phaî Svàhà*\) and other Goddesses. It can be added to any mantra to turn it into a weapon or a purifying force. It has mainly a fire \(Pitta\) energy but some air \(Vata\) as well. It increases Tejas and Prana, the inner energies of fire and air, in their purifying role. It breaks down resistance, dissolve barriers and remove deep-seated tamas.

However, one should not use such weapon mantras to attack others, or the destructive energy may reverberate back upon us. Use them only for protection or for removing negativity within yourself, particularly that of your own ego. Sometimes other mantras like *Hrãṁ* are used with *Phaî Svàhà*. Or *Phaî* may be used by itself to strike or remove negative energies.

***Haṁsaâ** So’**haṁ* –** **y8x7 x©zy8**

The mantras *Haṁsaâ* and So’*haṁ*, the natural sound of the breath, are often combined with Shakti mantras like *Hïṁ* or *Hrãṁ*. They affirm our unity with the higher Self or *Ahaṁ*. They both set in motion the higher solar and lunar energies and keep them in a state of balance. They unite the dualities within us, particularly at a pranic level. We will discuss them in detail later in the book under Pranayama.

***Namaâ**** *– ps7**

*Namaâ* is the mantra of reverence and surrender as in *Namas-te*, ‘reverence to you’. It is used with name mantras to honor and surrender to the deity, like *Oṁ Namaâ Śivàya*. It may also follow a name mantra like *Oṁ Gaṁ Ganeíàya Namaâ. *It is very common in all layers of Sanskrit mantras from the earliest Vedic texts. It is the term that most characterizes not only Hindu chanting but also the Buddhist and Jain.

***Svàhà**** *– ¼wŸyŸ**

*Svàhà* is said to be the wife or feminine counterpart of Agni or fire. She further energizes mantras with fire, adding more Shakti to them. *Svàhà* is repeated after mantras at Yajnas \(fire sacrifices\) while one is offering grains or anything else into the fire. Yet it is also used after mantras that one wants to project more fire energies with, like Kali and Tara mantras.

***Jai** and **Jaya**** *– m ¨ /** **mt**

*Jai* is a particle that means ‘victory to’ or ‘glory to’. It is often used with name mantras to the deity like Jai Ma Kali\! or to the guru like Jai Gurudeva\! *Jaya* is the longer version of the same.

***Hari Oṁ* –** **y¡u i 0**

*Hari* is a term that derives from the root *Hri* and is connected to the mantra *Hrãṁ*. It indicates light, particularly golden light, devotion, exaltation, vitality and preeminence. It is particularly associated with Lord Vishnu and Sri Krishna.

## The Language of Shakti Mantras

A single Shakti mantra can be used as a meditation mantra in order to draw the mind into deep awareness. One repeats the mantra prior to meditation to bring the mind into a meditative state. Then one keeps the mantra going in the back of the mind as long as the meditation proceeds, to help sustain the process. Several Shakti bija mantras can be also used together as meditation mantras, often in groups of three to seven bijas.

Shakti mantras can function as names of deities to invoke them, like *Oṁ* and Shiva, or *Aiṁ* and Sarasvati. But they are more commonly used in conjunction with Divine names, like *Oṁ Aiṁ Sarasvatyai Namaâ*\!

Shakti mantras reflect various types of invocation. For example, *Oṁ Aiṁ Hrãṁ Śrãṁ*, means *Oṁ*; I invoke \(*Aiṁ*\); open my heart to \(*Hrãṁ*\); and take refuge in \(*Śrãṁ*\). Or *Oṁ Krãṁ Hïṁ Hrãṁ *means* Oṁ*; I energize \(*Krãṁ*\); enkindle \(*Hïṁ*\); and open my heart \(*Hrãṁ*\). Shakti mantras allow us to energize our thoughts and feelings at a deeper level with the force of higher awareness. They can be used with chakra mantras or with the Mantra Purusha sounds, bringing in their particular energies, as we will discuss under those topics.
