title = "2 Mantra Purusha and Marma Points"

+++

Mantra Purusha sounds relate to specific marma points and regions of the body. We can call these "Marma Mantras". It is not possible in this context to present a detailed account of the location or description of all the marmas mentioned. The reader is requested to refer to the book Ayurveda and Marma Therapy or other books on marmas for that particular information.1

The sixteen vowels for the head have important marma correlations. The short A-vowel that is the root of and prime tone behind all sounds, is only generally correlated to the head in most presentations of the Mantra Purusha. However, in the Mantra Yoga Samhita, it relates to the top of the head and would best correspond to Adhipati marma at the top center of the head. It connects to the crown chakra, our root prana and inner consciousness and helps balance our mental and energy fields. The long *À*-vowel in most Mantra Purusha presentations relates generally to the face. However, in the *Mantra Yoga Samhita*, it relates specifically to the forehead, which makes more sense relative to marmas. I would relate it to the center of the forehead \(Lalata marma\) or to the third eye \(middle of the brows\), as governing the outer mind and senses, as opposed to Adhipati governing the inner mind beyond the senses. It may connect to the temples as well.

The *I*-vowels for the right and left eye probably best relate to the Apanga marmas at the outside corner of the eyes. However, they can be related to other marmas around the eyes. The U-sounds for the right and left ears probably best correspond to Vidhura marmas at the outside corner of the ears, though other ear marmas are relevant.

The vowel-*Ê *sounds relate to the Phana marmas at the outside corner of the nostrils. The vowel-*Ä *sounds seem best to relate to the Shringataka marmas on central cheek bones, which are the main marma in their region of the cheeks.

The *E* and *Ai* vowels relate to the points above and below the center of the lips. The *O* and *Au*-vowels relate to the points above and below the center of the front teeth. These are not classical marmas but are points that we can easily identify.

The *Aṁ* and *Aâ*-vowels are often related to the short and long A-vowels in terms of their locations and indications. In the Mantra Yoga Samhita, they relate to the upper and lower region of the palate at the back of the mouth, which would make more sense in the sequence.

The twenty consonants for the arms and legs have clear marma correspondences, as they relate primarily to the joints. The mantras on the arms correspond to the joints of the arm, elbow and wrist. The shoulder mantras can be related to various shoulder marmas, mainly Kakshadhara, the main shoulder marma. The elbows and wrist have their own specific marmas, Kurpara and Manibandha.

The points at the root of the fingers correspond to the Kshipra marma, which though usually given for the joint between the thumb and index finger, has counterparts on the roots of the other fingers as well. The tip of the fingers can be corresponded to marma points on the inside of each fingernail, though these also are not among the main classical marmas.

The mantras on the legs correspond in the same way as those of the arms, first to the joints of the hip \(Katikataruna mainly\), knee \(Janu\) and ankle \(Gulpha\). The roots of the toes relate to the foot Kshipra marmas, and the tips of the toes to the points on the inside of the toenails, just as the points on the inside of the fingernails. The five labial sounds cover the lower abdomen. Some relate to specific marmas like the navel \(for *Bhaṁ*\). For others, we can determine a location, though it may not be a classical marma. There are points on the middle abdomen to the right side of the navel that can correspond to the sound *Paṁ*, and points on the middle abdomen to the left side of the navel that can correspond to the sound *Phaṁ*. For *Baṁ*, which relates to the lower back, we could probably use the point of the spine opposite the navel, the point of the navel chakra. For the mantra *Maṁ*, the Basti \(bladder\) marma on the lower abdomen appears to be the best correlate.

The semivowels have three levels of relationships to our physiology. The first is relative to the tissues \(dhatus\). The second is relative the chakras. The third is relative the region of the chest around the heart. These can be related to different marma points.

For the chakras, we can use the respective chakra mantras for the points of the chakras along the spine: *Laṁ* for the base of the spine, *Vaṁ* for the region of the spine opposite the root of the reproductive organs, *Raṁ* for the region of the spine opposite the navel, *Yaṁ* for the region of the spine opposite the heart. We can also use these spinal points for the respective tissues that these sounds relate to \(*Yaṁ *and plasma etc.\).

Relative to the region around the heart in the front of the body, *Yaṁ* corresponds to the heart itself, *Raṁ* to the region to the right of the heart and the right nipple, and *Vaṁ* to the left of the heart and the left nipple. *Laṁ* may correspond to the region below the heart, perhaps to the base of the sternum, though it is usually connected to the energy flow from the heart to the top of the soft palate of the mouth.

The sibilants have several levels of correspondence. Like the semi-vowels, they correspond to the tissues and to the heart, but they relate more to energy flows or channels from the heart than to single locations. We can relate them to the marmas in the palms of the hand and soles of the feet where their respective energy flows end.

For *Śaṁ* from the heart to the right hand, we can use the right Talahridaya marma on the center of the right hand. For *Ṣaṁ* that relates to the heart to the left hand, we can use the left Talahridaya marma on the center of the left hand. For *Saṁ* that relates to the flow from the heart to the right foot, we can use the right Talahridaya marma on the center of the sole of the right foot. For *Haṁ* that relates to the flow from the heart to the left foot, we can use the left Talahridaya marma on the center of the soul of the left foot.

Some of the sibilants have additional correspondences to the chakras, *Haṁ* for the region of the spine opposite the neck, if not for the front base of the neck itself, and *Kṣaṁ* for the region of the spine opposite the third eye.

Relative to usage, one can chant the appropriate Mantra Purusha sound relative to the respective marma. This can be combined along with touching the point, directing one's prana there and holding one's attention there \(dharana\). The Marma Mantras serve to activate the mind or spirit of the marma and link prana, mind, marma and body. Their effects will reflect the general qualities and energetics of the particular marmas and mantras used.

For example, I-vowels for the right and left eye, can be used along with their marmas to strengthen vision and direct various healing energies to the eyes. On a yogic level, they can help open higher powers of vision and perception beyond the ordinary senses. All the indications provided relative the Mantra Purusha and how to use it can be brought in here.
