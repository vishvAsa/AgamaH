title = "1 Guidelines on the Chanting of Mantras"

+++

If you wish to use any of the mantras in the book, please make sure to keep the following factors in mind.

**1. **Chant the mantra with a sattvic or pure mind, which implies a peaceful intention and a calm frame of mind. Follow a sattvic or pure life-style while doing the mantra, including a vegetarian diet, refrain from negative emotions, take time in solitude and make your life into a form of service.

**2. **Honor the Divine power connected to the mantra before starting your practice, whether through mental acknowledgment, some form of ritual, or through a representative form like a statue or picture.

**3. **Seek further empowerment with the mantra from a guru, a holy site connected to its deity, or through the forces of nature like fire or water.

**4. **Make sure to pronounce the mantra properly. For this you may need to learn the basic rules of pronouncing the Sanskrit alphabet, starting with the Sanskrit pronunciation key in the book.

**5. **Initially chant the mantra out loud to gain a sense of its sound pattern. Then chant it softly on the breath to connect it to the prana. But most chanting will be mental while one is silent outwardly.

**6. **Chant the mantra in a regular manner at a certain time of day for a certain number of times. Generally, single syllable bija mantras like *Krãæ *or *Hrãæ *require at least 100,000 repetitions to energize, while longer syllable or extended mantras require at least 10,000, done in a series of regular sessions every day or week for a period of at least one month \(often forty days is used\). More repetition is generally better than less. Best is to repeat the mantra so often that the mantra starts to repeat itself continually and spontaneously in your deeper mind, even when you are not consciously trying to do so. That is a good sign you have really connected to the power of the mantra.

**7. **For counting mantras, it is best to use a mala or rosary of 108 beads. For single syllable bija mantras you can count 8, 16 or 32 repetitions of the mantra per bead to make it easier. 60 rounds are necessary for 100,000 repetitions at 16 per bead, 30 rounds at 32 per bead. For longer mantras, you can count one recitation of the mantra per bead. Chanting the mantra in a fast mode helps energize the prana. Chanting it slowly helps calm the mind.

**8. **Once the mantra has been energized, you can repeat it at will or follow its movement as it naturally arises within you. You need not continue to count it, though this can still be helpful.

**9. **It is best not to give to others mantras that you yourself have not already practiced or worked with for some period of time. Usually a year is a good minimum. It is better yet to only pass on mantras that you have been taught by a teacher or empowered by a tradition to teach.

## Yantras and Colors

Mantras can be energized with yantras, which are geometrical designs. The mantra is the sound body of the deity; the yantra is its energy body. In this regard there are special yantras for all major Hindu deities, particularly the Goddess, and also for planetary deities. Yantra is an entire study in its own right. For higher Mantra sadhana, particularly Mantra Dharana or concentration on a mantra, the yantra is an important, if not indispensible tool. The chakras themselves are yantras or energy patterns that one can so meditate upon. The Shri Yantra, also called Shri Chakra, is the most important of the yantras and contains an extensive mantra sadhana of the Goddess.

Another way to energize mantras is through different colors. One visualizes the mantra in a certain color like golden for *Hrãæ *or dark blue for *Huæ*. One can use the colors of the elements in the case of mantras for the five elements,1 or the colors of the planets for planetary mantras.2

## Rituals

It is important to include some ritual or at least sacred attitude in the practice of Mantra Yoga. One can begin by offering the mantra to the deity with the folded hands of Namaste, or by offering a flower, candle, ghee lamp or incense to the guru, a sacred text or a sacred image before beginning the mantra practice. One can begin mantra practice with a simple fivefold offering. One can use the bija mantras to the elements for this purpose. These are:

**1. **A fragrant oil or sandalwood paste for the Earth element and the sensory quality of smell. *Oæ Laæ Namaâ*.

**2. **Some sweet liquid food like milk for the Water element and the sensory quality of taste. *Oæ Vaæ Namaâ*.

**3. **A ghee lamp for the Fire element and the sensory quality of sight. *Oæ Raæ Namaâ*.

**4. **Some incense for the Air element and the sensory quality of touch. *Oæ Yaæ Namaâ*.

**5. **A flower for the Ether element and the sensory quality of sound. *Oæ Haæ Namaâ*.3

There are many traditional rituals or pujas that consist mainly of mantras and can be quite complex. These include gestures or mudras and a variety of offerings. Mudras are another important way to energize mantra and mantras are an important way to empower mudras, but also require a separate study.

## Use of Different Kinds of Malas

Malas are important tools of both worship and healing. They relate to different deities and have their specific powers that can be used to hold the energies of mantras in different ways. When we use a mala with our mantra recitation, the power of the mantra enters into the beads of the mala, which become energized at a subtle level. The more often we use them, the greater their power becomes. The mala gathers and magnifies the power of the mantra forming a sphere of energy and protection around us.

*Rudraksha *is the most commonly used bead for malas. It is the seed of a special tropical tree. It comes in different forms, but overall it is heating and sacred to Lord Shiva, increasing Tejas and Agni. It also helps arouse the Kundalini. There are several types of Rudrakshas, with the smaller beads generally regarded as more powerful. However, the five-faced beads, though large, are also very powerful. They relate to the five faces of Lord Shiva. One faced beads relate to the Supreme Shiva and pure unity. Two face beads are Shiva-Shakti. Rudrakshas can be found with faces up to fourteen, which all have their special powers. Rudraksha, however, can be too hot for some people. One may need to combine it with sandalwood or crystal to make it suitable.

*Sandalwood malas* are cooling and soothing to the mind and heart. They are sacred to Vishnu. Those who find the Rudraksha to be heating can wear a sandalwood mala as well to help balance the energy of the Rudraksha.

*Tulsi or holy basil* *malas* are stimulating and help open the mind and heart and are often used relative to Vishnu, Krishna or Dhanvantari. They are made of the wood from the bush.

*Crystal malas* are cooling and clearing. They are often sacred to the Goddess, but can relate to Shiva as well. Combined crystal and Rudraksha malas are Shiva-Shakti. 

*Coral malas* are warming and strengthening. They are often used to promote the Shiva energy as well. Astrologically, they relate to the planet Mars.

*Malas* can also be made of gems that reflect planetary energies. Garnet malas have a solar energy, pearl malas a lunar energy, coral malas relate to Mars, green gemstones like peridot to Mercury, citrine to Jupiter, clear crystal to Venus, amethyst to Saturn, hessonite garnet to Rahu and cat's eye to Ketu.

Malas can be stranded in gold, silver, copper or other types of threads. Gold is probably the most powerful. Wearing a mala, one should note, is not a matter for public display or a fashion statement. While one can wear a protective mala at all times, one usually keeps special sadhana malas away from public contact, viewing or touch. Remember the mala is a sacred implement that itself needs to be honored.

## Mantra for purifying Rudraksha

*Rïæ Írãæ Hrãæ Rïæ Svàhà\!*

Repeat the mantra at least 108 times while first using the mala or whenever you feel a need to purify it \(at least once a year\).

1 Yellow color for earth mantras, white for water, red for fire, smoky grey for air and dark blue for ether.

2 Red for Sun and Mars, white for Venus and Moon, yellow for Jupiter, green for Mercury, dark blue for Saturn.

3 One can use more complete mantras, for example: Oæ Laæ pêthivitattvàtmane namaâ, reverence to the soul of the Earth element.
