title = "18 Vastu and Directional Mantras"

+++

Mantra is not only connected to movement in time but also to location in space. The different directions of space convey various influences from nature, from other people, from technology, and from the greater universe that can be either helpful or harmful to us. We can use mantras to improve these "directional influences" in our lives that we otherwise have little protection against. There are universal directional influences, as well as those relative to the nature of the topography in which we live, and the orientation of our buildings, houses and rooms.

Most of us do not know how to create a sacred space around us. We may build a house to protect our bodies, but we don't know how to build a house to protect our minds. Nor do we know how to make our house not just a physical refuge, but a refuge for our inner being, a temple as it were. Our minds are vulnerable to directional influences, which carry negative thoughts, negative electrical energies or disturbances in our psychic environment. Many cultures speak of the danger of the "evil eye" or the jealousy of others. This is but one example of how negative forces can come to us like invisible arrows.

At all moments, there are influences coming to us through our environment as well as the thoughts that people are projecting towards us which, given human nature, are often negative in their orientation. We need to close our doors and windows to these negative influences, as it were, both outwardly and inwardly. Directional mantras help us to do that. Otherwise, we are making ourselves unnecessarily vulnerable to negative influences which, like bacteria and viruses, are there for everyone. It is like going outside without the necessary clothing to withstand the elements. Directional mantras can protect not only our dwellings but ourselves and our bodies, wherever we may be. They also serve to bring in positive energies from the Divine and cosmic powers.

Traditional cultures have special methods of honoring the directions, recognizing the type of forces that each direction brings to us. The cosmic quality of each direction can symbolically be regarded as a deity, a special power of consciousness and natural intelligence. The Vedic system presents one of the most comprehensive directional sciences available, and one that is closely linked with the power of mantra. Direction and sound are connected, as sound is the quality that relates to space as an element in yogic thought. Through mantra we can change the energy of our space and through that change the quality of our lives.

## Vastu Mantras

*Vastu* is the Vedic science of architecture and directional influences. It has its own special "Vastu mantras", which are an important method for improving the directional influences in our dwellings. Vastu mantras can help promote positive energies and remove negative energies in the locations we live in, travel through or perform our work. Mantras are applied in Vastu to purify and energize the dwelling in which one is residing. They create a mind and a soul for the structure that we reside in. They are particularly important for sacred spaces, meditation rooms, temples and clinics.

Mantras are an important remedial measure in Vastu. They help clear the psychic and pranic energy in our dwellings and counter any negative effects brought about by improper orientation or "bad Vastu": inappropriate placement of buildings or of rooms within it. It is important to do mantras around the house, just as it is important to clean the floor or open the windows\! Even mantras we otherwise may be doing can be performed in the eight directions to protect our Vastu.

Mantras for the directions are important not only in Vastu but also in Yoga. It is essential to have good directional energies relative to your meditation seat or the room where you perform your rituals. Generally, one sits for meditation facing the auspicious east or northeast directions. Mantras to directional deities are an integral part of traditional Yoga practices. Many spiritual traditions consider such directional influences and have mantras, prayers and offerings for them. Astrology and Vastu also correlate, with planetary influences corresponding to specific directions.

Directional influences primarily reflect the influences of the atmosphere or sphere of Vayu \(Vayu mandala\), which mainly affect Vata dosha, the biological air humor, through the forces of the wind and the weather. Our houses are built to protect us from the negative influences of the air and the seasons.

Each direction has a "Directional Deity" \(Dig Devata\), which protects us from the negative energies and promotes the positive energies through their respective directions. The central direction is not counted in the sequence as it represents the place that we are seeking to protect.

Directional deities grant control of both the external and the internal elements and aspects of the psyche that they relate to: the five elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether, mind \(manas\), ego \(ahamkara\), and intelligence \(buddhi\).1 These relate to the causal body or the prime energies governing our existence, which impact us through the directions. The directions are usually counted off starting in the east.

**1\)** East – *Indra*, the deity of light and the Sun, who relates to the earth as an element and cosmic principle. His seed mantra *Laṁ* stands for the earth element, which he controls. His weapon is the thunderbolt or *Vajra*, which is the Divine light that protects us from the eastern direction. Its bija mantra is *Vaṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

**2\)** Southeast – *Agni*, the deity of fire and relates to fire as an element and cosmic principle. His mantra *Raṁ* is the seed sound for the Fire element. His weapon is the spear or *Śakti*, which is the Divine fiery energy that protects us from the Southeast.

Its bija mantra is *Śaṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

**3\)** South – *Yama*, the deity of restraint and death, who relates to ego as a cosmic principle. His seed sound *Màṁ* is that of the ego and grants control over it. His weapon is the *Daçáa* or rod, which grants restraint and counters evil influences from the South. Its bija mantra is *Daṁ*, which represents its first syllable and also gives self-control.

**4\)** Southwest – *Nirêiti*, the deity of dissolution, similar to Kali in qualities, who relates to intelligence \(buddhi\) as a cosmic principle. Her seed sound is *Kṣaṁ* which gives protection and support and also gives power to the intelligence. Her weapon is the *Khaèga* or sword, which grants us protection and discrimination from the Southwest. Its bija mantra is *Khaṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

**5\)** West – *Varuça*, the deity of the ocean and the rains, relates to the water element as a cosmic principle, including both earthly and heavenly waters. His mantra *Vaṁ* is the seed sound of water. His weapon is the *Pàía* or noose, which grants us protection from the West. Its bija mantra is *Paṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

**6\)** Northwest – *Vàyu* or the wind God relates to the air element as a cosmic principle. His mantra *Yaṁ* is the seed sound of the air element. His weapon is the *A èkuía*, the prod or goad, which grants us protection from the Northwest. Its bija mantra is *Aṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

**7\)** North – *Soma*, the deity of the Moon, who relates to the mind as a cosmic principle. His mantra *Sauṁ* grants blessings, lunar energy and contentment to the mind, of which it is also the seed mantra. His weapon is the Gada or mace, which grants us protection from the North. Its bija mantra is *Gaṁ*, which reflects its first syllable. Sometimes Kubera, the deity of wealth and abundance, is placed here instead of Soma.

**8\)** Northeast – *Ãíàna* or the supreme Lord, who relates to the element of ether or space as a cosmic principle. His mantra *Haṁ* is also the seed sound of the Ether element. His weapon is the *Triíïla*, the trident of Lord Shiva, which protects us from the sacred Northeast direction. Its bija mantra is *Trãṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

## Two other important directional inf luences are also recognized:

**9\)** Upward direction or above. This corresponds on a horizontal plane with ENE, the intermediate point between East and North East. It is the place of *Brahmà* or the Divine Creator, who represents the ruling spiritual energy coming from above. His mantra *Àṁ* grants expansion to one's being. His weapon or instrument is the Padma or lotus, which showers down blessings on us from above. Its bija mantra is *Paṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

**10\)** Downward direction or below. This corresponds on a horizontal plane with WSW, the intermediate point between W and SW. It is the place of Ananta, the serpent that upholds the worlds, who represents the support energy coming from below. His mantra *Hrãṁ* gives light and strength at the foundation of the world. His weapon in the Cakra or discus of Lord Vishnu, which protects us from below. Its bija mantra is *Caṁ*, which reflects its first syllable.

## Mantras for Directional Deities

We can sanctify each direction through the mantras of its respective deity and its bija. Then we can protect each direction through the weapon of the deity, which has its bija mantra as well.

## Use of Directional Mantras

The simplest way to use these mantras is to recite the mantras of the directional deities in order, starting with Indra in the East, moving on to Agni in the Southeast and then clockwise through the remainder of the deities to Brahma above and Ananta below. This should be followed by their weapon mantras in the same sequence starting in the East. These mantras can be recited on a regular basis to sanctify the energy in your house; at least once a week is a good idea.

Relative to Yoga, one should recite these mantras before one does any serious ritual, practice or meditation. They can also be used to clear the energy from Yoga classrooms. One should face the appropriate direction while repeating the mantras for it. These mantras also protect us from the harmful effects of the elements that they rule over.

## Bhuvaneshvari

The form of the Goddess governing space in general is *Bhuvaneshvari*, the Queen of the universe, whose mantra is *Hrãṁ*, the sound of the Divine light. This mantra can be used to consecrate all the directions of space along with honoring her as the deity.2

## Planets and the Directions
NW – Moon N – Mercury NE – Jupiter   W – Saturn  E – Sun   SW – Rahu S – Mars SE – Venus   


The planets correspond to the directions from which they cast their influences. These correspondences are a little different than those between the planets and the elements, reflecting more subtle qualities.

The Northeast direction has a positive or benefic Jupiterian energy and is good for spiritual and religious practices and influences. North has a positive Mercury energy and is good for learning, study and education. East is the direction of the Sun and is good for work, action, healing and spiritual practices. Southeast has a Venus energy and is a place of power, connection and expression. South has a Mars energy and inclines us to work, action, assertion and conflict. Southwest has a negative Rahu energy and is a place of rest and control. West has a Saturn energy and brings about decay and decline, but also maturity and detachment. Northwest has a lunar energy, but one that tends to be sensitive, vulnerable, changeable and unstable.

One can recite the planetary mantras relative to the directions around your dwelling to clear out any negative astrological energies, starting with *Oṁ Sïṁ Sïryàya Namaâ*, the mantra for the Sun, in the eastern direction. People with planetary afflictions in their birth chart become vulnerable relative to the direction ruled by the planet. One can recite planetary mantras relative to the direction ruled by any negative planetary influences in one's birth chart for additional protection. Or if there is a very negative transit going on that may be affecting many people, one can chant the mantras of the planets involved with a directional orientation. This requires some knowledge of astrology or the help of an astrologer.

1 These are called the Ashta Prakriti or the eightfold nature in Vedic thought and relate to the causal body and first eight of the 24 tattvas of Samkhya philosophy.

2 There are also special Tantric directional deities. One group is a set of Shaktis or Goddesses. The other set is a set of great deities, forms Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. These are also used in directional Nyasas.
