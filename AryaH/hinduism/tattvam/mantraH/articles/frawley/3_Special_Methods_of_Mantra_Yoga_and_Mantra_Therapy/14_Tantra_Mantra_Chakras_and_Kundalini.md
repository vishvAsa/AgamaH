title = "14 Tantra, Mantra, Chakras and Kundalini"

+++

Traditional Tantric Yoga consists of the use of mantras, deities, rituals, and meditation for achieving all the goals of life, particularly the ultimate goal of liberation. Tantra recognizes that we live in a universe full of Divine powers that we can communicate with in order to improve our lives. While these forces are present for everyone, only those who know how to contact their energies can fully benefit by them. Tantra teaches us this art of cosmic communication through the language of mantra.

Mantra is the central pillar of traditional Tantric Yoga. The mantra represents the "sound form" of the deity that is the key to the deity's energy and its grace. The mantra is allied to the yantra or "energy form" of the deity, the geometrical pattern that sets its energy in motion. The chakras themselves are internal yantras or energy forms. The term Tantra itself refers to the "teaching" about the deity and its worship, both externally and internally, which centers on the mantra.

Tantra gives much importance to Shakti mantras for the worship of different Goddesses. Kundalini Yoga and the use of chakra mantras is another important aspect of Tantra.

Tantric Yoga follows an integral approach, employing all eight limbs of Yoga from asana to samadhi, adding to it a sophisticated external ritualism. As a way of knowledge based on Vedantic philosophy, Tantra emphasizes Self-realization and the realization of Brahman as the ultimate goal of life. As connected to Vedic science in general, Tantra includes Ayurveda, Vedic Astrology, and Vastu in its own Tantric forms or "Tantric sciences".

## The Sounds of the Petals of the Chakras

The Kundalini Shakti itself is the inner power of mantra, whereas the chakras are the energy fields created by its unfoldment. Mantra is the best means of arousing the Kundalini and energizing the chakras, which like the Kundalini remain dormant and asleep in the ordinary human state. Kundalini is defined according to the Sanskrit alphabet: "starting with the letter–A and ending with the letter-*Kìa*, so is called the Kundalini.”1

We have noted that it is not possible for the Kundalini to rise or the chakras to be opened unless the prana first enters the Sushumna, which requires the balancing of solar and lunar energies and the development of higher Agni and Soma forces. This process is aided by bringing the sound current downward to the root chakra through the power of mantra. Both of these practices rest upon the development of a higher consciousness and power of attention within us.

The petals of the chakras represent an unfoldment of primal sound through the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. The six lower chakras contain a total of fifty petals, each of which relates to one of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. This is the "garland of letters" that shows the vibratory frequencies of the chakras. The thousand petal lotus or crown chakra indicates all possible sound combinations of these fifty letters. The letters can be recited as mantras along with the Anusvara-*æ *as chakra mantras.

## The Sounds of the Chakra Petals and Mantra Purusha

While this sequence at first looks different than that of the Mantra Purusha, a deeper examination reveals many connections.

• The throat chakra governs the element of ether, which in terms of bodily structure is represented by the head. The sixteen vowels of the Mantra Purusha are the sounds of the head.

• The heart chakra governs the element of air and to the arms/hands as a motor organ. The Mantra Purusha letters of the guttural and palatal consonants relating to the right and left arms dominate the sounds of the heart chakra.

• The navel chakra governs the element of fire and to the feet as a motor organ. The majority letters for this chakra are those in the Mantra Purusha that relate to the right and left legs/feet.

• The sex or water chakra relates to the three last labial sounds \(*Baæ, Bhaæ, Maæ*\), which relate to the lower abdomen \(a region of water\) and to the first three semi-vowels \(*Yaæ, Raæ, Laæ*\) that govern the tissues of plasma, blood and muscle that are mainly watery in nature.

• The root chakra, which governs the earth element, relates to the last semivowel- Va and the first three sibilants \(*Vaæ, Íaæ, Ìaæ, Saæ*\). These govern the tissues of fat, bone, marrow and reproductive, which are connected to the root and earth energies within us.

• The Third eye relates to the last sibilants of *Haæ *and *Kìaæ*, which reflect prana and mind.

## Recitation of the Sanskrit Alphabet through the Chakras

The process of recitation of the Sanskrit alphabet through the chakras consists of first drawing the energy of speech from the throat down to the base of the spine with the forty eight sounds of the Sanskrit alphabet. Then one draws the energy of speech up to the third eye where resides the two additional sounds *Haæ *and *Kìaæ *that represent the powers of prana and mind. This recitation draws the sound current downward to the base of the spine in order to arouse the Kundalini and stimulate it to ascend. In this process, our speech is internalized and brought to the level of primal sound.

To practice this method, recite each of the letters of the alphabet while meditating upon the petals of the chakra where they occur, starting with the throat. In this process, one traces the energy of speech through the four levels.

• One begins with the sixteen vowels in the throat chakra that relate to the Vaikhari, the outer or audible form of speech.

• One continues with the first twelve consonants in the heart chakra as the Madhyama or middle, pranic level of speech.

• One continues with the ten consonants in the navel chakra as the Pashyanti or illumined level of speech.

• One continues with the ten remaining consonants, semivowels and sibilants in the sex and root chakras as the Para or transcendent form of speech, through which the Kundalini or higher sound energy awakens.

• Then the Kundalini Shakti rises up to the third eye carrying all the letters of the alphabet along with the two remaining letters *Haæ *and *Kìaæ*, connecting the power of speech with that of prana and mind.

• This awakens all possible mantric powers and sounds in the crown chakra.

One can bring in additional Shakti mantras as taught for the Mantra Purusha, like adding the mantra *Hrãæ *to each chakra petal sound for opening up its energy. One can also use a Devata \(deity\) mantra for the letter of each petal like *Oæ Aæ Namaâ Íivàya*. This is a very powerful devotional practice.

## Kundalini Chakra Mantra Yoga

This powerful method of Mantra Yoga emphasizes the central sounds of the chakras \(the bijas of their respective elements\) along with Shakti mantras. It does not consider the sounds of the petals of the chakras.

The Kundalini is aroused with the fiery mantra - *Hïæ *- along with the mantra for the chakra. The awakened Kundalini fire purifies and dissolves the elemental powers of each chakra, allowing our awareness to ascend to the next chakra. It also purifies the corresponding sense and motor organs, dissolving our ego attachment to them. In this process, one goes through the chakras from below to above starting with the root chakra. However, one must be ready for such a process by purification of one's life style and emotional nature as a foundation for the practice to really work. Otherwise, such strong mantras can be disturbing.2
Oæ Laæ Hïæ Purifies the earth element in the root chakra   Oæ Vaæ Hïæ Purifies the water element in the sex chakra   Oæ Raæ Hïæ Purifies the fire element in the navel chakra   Oæ Yaæ Hïæ Purifies the air element in the heart chakra   Oæ Haæ Hïæ Purifies the ether element in the throat chakra   Oæ Kìaæ Hïæ Purifies the mind in the third eye   Oæ Oæ Hïæ Purifies consciousness in the head chakra   


One can also repeat the bija mantras silently along with the breath for greater effect, for example: *Oæ Laæ Laæ Laæ Hïæ Hïæ Hïæ Hïæ*\!

After this procedure is completed, one can bring the consciousness of the Divine Self into each of the chakras, starting from above with the chakra mantra plus *Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà*, the great Purusha mantra. This draws the Soma or lunar nectar down to balance the Kundalini fire's ascent. It also requires that one has placed one's sense of happiness, love and devotion in the Divine presence within.
Oæ Oæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the crown chakra and pure consciousness   Oæ Kìaæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the third eye and mind   Oæ Haæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the throat chakra and ether element   Oæ Yaæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the heart chakra and air element   Oæ Raæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the fire chakra and the fire element   Oæ Vaæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the water chakra and the water element   Oæ Laæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà Energizes the consciousness of the Divine Self or Atman in the earth chakra and the earth element   


One can add the lunar mantra *Írãæ *for greater effect as: *Oæ Oæ Írãæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà, Oæ Kìaæ Írãæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà*, and so on down the chakras. This aids in the descent of Soma, which is a lunar power.

Deity mantras can be added to these chakra mantras \(here counting from the root chakra up\) like *Oæ Laæ Namaâ Íivàya *or *Oæ Vaæ Namaâ Íivàya*. Shakti bijas can be added like *Oæ Oæ Aiæ Klãæ Sauâ*, *Oæ Kìaæ Aiæ Klãæ Sauâ *\(here counting from the crown chakra down\). These are but a few examples.

Such chakra mantras work better combined with the breath, for example, with one breath per mental recitation of the overall mantra. The number of mantra pranayama recitations per chakra can be gradually increased, with seven as a good number to begin with.3 These secrets are passed on in individualized sadhana. This twofold process is similar to the energy balancing of the Fire below and the Moon above taught already, but occurs at a more internal level of practice, aiming at the Sushumna or central channel itself.

## The Spiritual Heart \(Hridaya\), the Chakras and the Power of Sound

*All six lower chakras and their various petals are contained in and comprehended by the thousand petalled lotus of the crown chakra. The thousand petalled lotus, in turn, is contained in and comprehended by the hridaya or spiritual heart. The hridaya or spiritual heart is not the heart chakra \(Anahata\) but the core of our being, the seat of the Atman or Purusha, in which all chakras, all worlds and all beings are comprehended.*

The spiritual heart is sometimes visualized as a small space or cavern in the heart.4 Sometimes it is seen as a flame, in the center of which is the lightning power of consciousness. Sometimes the entire body is visualized in that flame. It is often figured as a lotus of eight petals in the region of the heart in which either the Atman or the Ishta Devata, our chosen form of the Divine for worship, is meditated upon. These eight petals correspond to the eight directions of space \(four cardinal and four intermediate directions\) and to the eight causal powers of the five elements, ego, intelligence and great Nature.5

Certain approaches of Jnana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge, and Bhakti Yoga, the Yoga of Devotion, focus directly on the heart and may not regard the Kundalini or the chakras in a separate light.6 They speak of opening the knots of the heart as the key to liberation.7 They emphasize dwelling in the heart, not any ascent or descent of energies. However, this dwelling in the spiritual heart can bring about the proper harmonization, ascent and descent of energies, without a specific effort to do so.

The small space within the spiritual heart is the ultimate source of sound and mantra, of prana and mind, of Agni and Soma, Shiva and Shakti. In it dwell all beings, all worlds, all time and all space, but it is not in any way tainted or affected by these. One can also practice the "Mantra Yoga of the spiritual heart" or "Hridaya Mantra Yoga". One focuses on the mantra, the deity and the Self in the heart.

There are specific mantras for the spiritual heart, the most important of which is *Hrãæ*. The heart is the location of the higher Self that is the supreme aspect of Prana, the hamsa. A good mantra for the heart is the mantra to the Supreme Light \(Paramjyoti Mantra\), which is also an important mantra for the Sun, with which the spiritual heart is connected:

*Oæ Hrãæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà*

The mantra has a power similar to the Gayatri mantra to awaken our higher perception. It liberates the hamsa or bird of the soul, connecting us with the Divine prana in the heart. It is a universal mantra that can be recommended to anyone.8 It does not have the potential complications of Kundalini mantras.

We can chant this mantra in all the chakras along with their respective chakra mantras in order to bring the light of the spiritual heart into all the chakras. For example relative to the root chakra, one can chant:

*Oæ Laæ Hrãæ Haæsaâ So'haæ Svàhà*

## Shakti Mantras and the Chakras

Shakti mantras have general actions in all the chakras according to their energies, though they may be more helpful in certain chakras than in others. I have given a few of these possibilities below that can be combined with various practices. Combinations of these mantras can be used, particularly relative to deities, like the the Kali mantra *Krãæ Hïæ Hrãæ *to bring energy and light to all the chakras or the Sundari mantra *Hrãæ Írãæ Klãæ *to bring bliss and contentment.

• The mantra *Hïæ *brings a fire energy to all the chakras in which it is used, projecting its power. It is usually connected to the root chakra, the navel and the third eye, the seats of fire within us, and is probably most powerful in the navel. It is used to draw the fire energy up the chakras.

• The mantra *Írãæ *provides a nurturing and cooling lunar energy to all the chakras we direct its energy towards. It is usually connected to the heart and to the lunar aspect of the head. It is used to draw the Soma energy down the chakras from above.

• The mantra *Hrãæ *brings a solar light and space to all the chakras in which it is used, deepening the experience of the chakra. It is usually connected to the heart but can bring light to all the chakras. It connects the chakras with the spiritual heart.

• The mantra *Krãæ *with its electrical force helps open all chakras in which it is used. It is like an electrical charge that activates the chakras. It is often connected to the root chakra, the navel chakra and the third eye.

• The mantra *Klãæ *brings magnetic or devotional energy to all the chakras in which it is used, helping to consolidate its energy. It also serves to draw the energy of water into the chakras. It is usually connected with the heart but also with the lunar region of the head.

• The mantra *Aiæ *brings space and attention to all the chakras in which it is used. It brings guidance and knowledge into the chakra. It is usually connected to the throat, third eye and head, the seats of knowledge.

• The mantras *Strãæ *or *Trãæ *allow us to move up from one chakra to another. It also allows us to spread out the energy of the chakra to different parts of the body. It is most commonly connected to the navel chakra.

• Pranic mantras like *Hsauâ *stimulate the Kundalini in the root chakra in a powerful way.

2 Sometimes instead of Hïæ, the astra mantra - Huæ Phaî Svàhà - is used instead. This is a more powerful practice, requiring yet greater caution.

3 Generally repeated in numbers like 11, 27, 54 and 108.

4 Note the famous Dahara vidya in the Chandogya Upanishad VIII.

5 These eight are the five elements, ahamkara, buddhi and Prakriti.

6 This is also the teaching of Ramana Maharshi.

7 Tantra speaks of the knots of the root, navel and third eye centers. These are all part of the knots of the spiritual heart \(hridaya\) that the Upanishads speak of.

8 There are variations on this mantra that can be used to develop its energies in more specific directions.
