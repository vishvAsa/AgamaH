title = "15 Mantra Deity and the Chanting of Divine Names"

+++



After the primal sounds or bija mantras, probably the next most important are special "name mantras". These consist of names, epithets, qualities or functions of the Divine in different forms, manifestations, or personalities. They are centered on one word, the name, which may have several syllables.

There is a tremendous power in the name, as we all know. In our ordinary communication, we use names in order to draw the attention of a person to us. If I know your name, for example, and call you by it you respond personally. If I address you by someone else's name, you will not respond at all. The same is true of the Divine and higher consciousness. If we know the Divine names, we can commune more readily with the Divine being. Our minds revolve around various names. When we repeat such Divine Names, our minds and hearts become purified and we begin to see the Divine in others.

A human name is an indication of a being, a person, a conscious Self. It is because we are endowed with being ourselves that we can recognize our own name and respond to its call. Similarly, it is because of the presence of the universal Being that we can name other objects and endow them with their own particular being. Ultimately, it is only because of eternal Being of the Divine that we can name anything. This means that the naming process contains a recognition of the universality of Being, which is the basis of the sacred or mantric name.

Unfortunately, our society does not honor the name as sacred but uses it for exploitation. We do not honor the person or the inner being but only the outer identity, face, label or credit card number. It is important that we bring back the sanctity of the Name back into our lives. This is one of the most important applications of mantra. Through the Mantra Yoga of Divine Names we can reclaim the sacred universe and make sacred all beings.

Reciting Divine names is a way of awakening Divine qualities within ourselves. Ultimately, Being is One and all names are Divine names. Sanskrit is a language of Divine names. It shows how all sounds manifest from the Divine Word as a Self- revelation. Through Divine Names we can reclaim our own Divine Being as the Self of all, taking us beyond separate ego identities of body and mind.

***Namaâ,***** the Great Chant of Devotion**

Throughout the Hindu tradition since Vedic times, there has been the commonly reverberating chant of *Namaâ *or *Namo *to various deities. We find the same *Namaâ *chants in the Buddhist, Jain and other traditions from India. Perhaps no other term in the history of the world has served to promote so much devotion and honoring of higher consciousness.

Namaste is a greeting that has the same basis, honoring that Divine presence, which is then invoked with a Divine Name. It is important to chant our *Namaâ *every day in order to honor the Divine within and without.

## Divine Names and Bhakti Yoga

The Yoga of Devotion or Bhakti Yoga is perhaps the most important and foundational of all the Yogas. It provides the feeling, passion or motivation that carries us along our spiritual path, however we may define it for ourselves. In addition, Bhakti is the most accessible of all Yoga approaches because it relies more on internal feeling than external forms, techniques or mental powers.

Bhakti Yoga emphasizes chanting as its main method, with the repetition of mantras, particularly Divine Names, along with ritual worship, prayer, and devotional meditation. It uses the chakras, particularly the heart, as sites of internal worship and a shrine or temple as part of external worship. Divine names and mantras are part of both internal and external worship.

Names of important forms of divinity can be used like *Oṁ Namaâ Śivàya *for Lord Shiva, the transcendent Being, or *Oṁ Namo Bhagavate Vàsudevàya *for Krishna, the avatar of Divine love. Divine names may be combined with seed mantras to the deities like *Oṁ Hauṁ Namaâ Śivàya*, or *Oṁ Klãṁ K êṣçàya Namaâ *for yet other effects.

There are many collections of the names of Hindu Gods and Goddesses like the Thousand Names of Shiva \(Shiva Sahasranama\), the Thousand Names of Vishnu or the Thousand Names of Lalita \(the Goddess\). Reciting such thousand names helps stimulate the thousand petalled lotus of the head, which contains all possible sounds and meanings. There are also many hundred name chants and yet smaller numbers of names.

## Stotras and Chants

*Stotras* are longer mantras, prayers, songs or hymns in Sanskrit, the verses of which form the basis of many Sanskrit chants. The term Stotra refers to a hymn of praise or affirmation. Such hymns of praise, propitiation or seeking favor of the deity are common in many spiritual and religious traditions. There are many famous Sanskrit Stotras chanted today and good recordings of them can be commonly found in India. In fact, Stotras are more common in the devotional context of India than are Kirtans. There are special books that one can buy that contain collections of Stotras. Most of these are in Sanskrit or in the regional languages of India, but a few are in English.

*Stotras* are generally aimed at specific deities as one of the main practices of Bhakti Yoga. There are formless or philosophical Stotras as well, though these do not always have the same devotional power. The idea is that the Stotra can gain the favor of the deity which rules over the particular issue involved and so resolve it at a level of higher consciousness. Stotras can be chanted for all the goals of life, including health and liberation. It usually depends upon the intentionality with which the Stotra is recited. One can chant a Stotra to seek Divine blessings and grace for whatever one truly needs in life. However, there are Stotras specific to particular aims or goals in life, like certain Lakshmi Stotras that give wealth.

There are many famous *Stotras* to Shiva, Devi, Vishnu, Krishna, Rama, Ganesha and other deities that can be used in their worship and as part of Yoga practice.1 Certain Stotras to the Goddess as *Tripurasundari* reveal secrets of Yoga, mantra and the chakras that are otherwise hard to find. The alliteration and the cadence of the Mahishasura-Mardini Stotra can aid in the awakening of the Kundalini Shakti. The alliteration and the cadence of the Shiva Tandava Stotra can awaken the presence of Shiva within us. I personally chant many Stotras on a regular basis. It is one of the best ways of developing devotion and a mantric healing power.2

## Prayer \(Prarthana\)

The propitiation of the deity to help us in our lives is called Prarthana in Sanskrit and prayer in English. There are many Sanskrit mantric prayers or Prarthanas. Sometimes these are part of Stotras.

According to the Vedic view, we live in a user friendly conscious universe. We can get anything that we truly desire, but we have to know how to ask. Prayer teaches us how to ask the Divine for the help that we truly need in life. All mantras are prayers of a kind. Mantra itself is a kind of "language of prayer" in which the sounds of the prayer reflect the Divine language, the language of mantra. Yet we must be careful what we are seeking in our prayers, aiming at what is best for ourselves and for all beings.

## Forms of the Gods and Goddesses

Bhakti Yoga rests upon a personal connection with the Deity. This is not the external God of an institutionalized belief but the internal divinity within our own hearts, our inner Self. For the practice of Bhakti Yoga, we must create a personal relationship with the deity. This takes two main approaches, either as a type of relationship or as a particular representational form, which usually go together.

As a type of relationship, we can worship God as the Divine father, mother, brother, sister, friend, beloved, master or teacher - or in any other type of relationship that we are inclined to. Generally, father, mother or beloved are the main approaches preferred. In this way, we assume a deep personal connection with the Divine that can be the basis for meditation. Such a divine connection can also help us heal our human relationships and the psychological problems these may have caused for us. As a particular form, there are many depictions of the Deity, usually in one of these relationship aspects, particularly as the Divine Father and Divine Mother, which become various Gods and Goddesses. We may choose to worship the Divine in a human form, in some natural form as a sacred animal, plant or mountain, or in symbolic forms like Shiva lingas or the geometrical Sri Yantra. It is a matter of our deeper yearning and natural inclinations.

Since our main attachment is to the human form, looking at the Divine in a human form can be a good way to focus our attention. Yet worshipping the Divine in the world of nature helps us to understand how consciousness pervades the entire universe. Ultimately, we must see the Divine in all beings.

Some people prefer to worship God, who is an infinite and eternal being, as formless. Yet they usually still look upon God in relationship terms as the father or mother, or as having some sort of personality, son or representative whom they honor. Others may worship God through Divine qualities like Divine love, compassion, fearlessness, strength and so on. These qualities can also be worshipped symbolically through different Gods and Goddesses that represent them, like worshipping the power of Divine love through Lord Krishna, the avatar of Divine love, joy and devotion. One must remember that the deeper mind and soul communicates more through symbols, images and mantras, than through literal words or abstract ideas.

At the highest level, we can use mantras to invoke our inner being or higher Self, the Atman or Purusha within us. We can use mantra to invoke the Absolute or the cosmic being into our lives. The true Divinity is not apart from us. And our true being is not apart from the Divinity. To find this, we need to surrender our ego self and discover our true nature as pure consciousness.

## Ishta Devata

The form of God or manifestation of Divinity that one personally chooses to worship is called an Ishta Devata or "chosen deity" in Sanskrit. In the Yoga tradition, it is important to worship the Divine according to the form or approach that most appeals to one's heart. Yoga emphasizes having such an Ishta Devata as an inner guide, goal or aspiration. According to the Yoga Sutras, the power of concentration on God or surrender to Ishvara \(Ishvara-pranidhana\) is the best means to bring about samadhi.3 For this, one should chose the form or approach that most appeals to one's inner being and deeper aspirations.4

An Ishta Devata mantra is our main personal devotional mantra or means of calling on the Divine. Whether we worship God as father or mother or as various deities or avatars, there are special mantras that we can take up in each case. The Ishta Devata is a matter of personal choice, but its mantra becomes more powerful if given by a guru or by tradition. One can always feel free to use the mantra of one’s Ishta Devata or chosen divinity for any life-purpose, including healing. This is another reason why it is good to have such a deity.

Ishta Devata mantras consist of names of deities or gurus, generally given in the dative \(to\) case grammatically and with the term *Namaâ *or reverence. Some include bija mantras as well.

**Examples:**

*Oṁ Namaâ Śivàya *\(for Shiva\)  
*Oṁ Namo Bhagavate Vasudevàya *\(for Krishna\)  
*Oṁ Gaṁ Ganeíàya Namaâ *- Reverence to Ganesha

## Guru Mantras

There are special "guru mantras" used to contact various great teachers. One can use guru mantras for all life-purposes including healing. The inner guidance and influence of the guru helps calm the mind and control the senses. One repeats the mantra as a means of communicating with and developing devotion for the guru. Example:

*Oṁ Namo Bhagavate Śrã Ramaçàya *\(for Guru Ramana Maharshi\)

## Speech and the Forms of the Gods and Goddesses

The Yoga tradition abounds with an abundance of names, forms and approaches to Divinity, which all have their counterparts in Divine sound and mantra. There is a great trinity of deities that governs the cosmic processes of creation, preservation and dissolution \(reabsorption of the universe back into the absolute\). The three have masculine and feminine forms as Brahma/Sarasvati, Vishnu/Lakshmi, and Shiva/Kali. It is the feminine forms that are most connected to speech and mantra.

Generally, the Goddess Sarasvati, who relates to knowledge and to creative power, is the main Goddess of speech, communication, poetry and music. But the other two forms of the Goddess also relate to speech in different aspects. Lakshmi is the loving or nurturing form of speech, speech at a devotional level. Kali is the energetic or transformative form of speech, speech at a pranic level. As indicating the power of Shakti overall, Kali reflects higher forms of speech in which the Divine Word awakens within us and withdraws us back into the Absolute, revealing the beauty and bliss beyond time and space.

## The Five Deity Lines

Hindu devotional worship recognizes five main sects or divisions relative to five great deities, each with its own special mantras.

1\) Shiva and the Shaivite tradition

2\) Vishnu and the Vaishnava tradition, including Rama and Krishna

3\) The Goddess and the Shakta tradition

4\) Ganesha or Ganapati tradition

5\) The Sun \(Saura\) tradition and planetary deities

Much overlap exists between these five groups. Goddesses have their place in the Vaishnava and Shaivite lines, as well as the Shakta approach. Shakti is also worshipped along with Lord Shiva as part of the Shaivite approach. Lakshmi is also worshipped along with Lord Vishnu as well being part of the Goddess or Shakta line. Skanda or Subrahmanya \(Murugan in South India\) is sometimes added as another line. Buddha is sometimes added, along with various Bodhisattvas and Buddhist deities. Mahavira, the main teacher of ancient Jainism, is sometimes added as another line along with other Jain deities.

Some complexity can exist among these lines. Relative to the Goddess, for example, there are ten great wisdom Goddesses \(Dasha Mahavidya\), nine forms of Durga \(Nava Durga\), eight aspects of Lakshmi \(Ashta Lakshmi\), and so on. We will examine the mantras for some of the most important deities below, but it is by no means a complete list. Note that the Sun and planetary deities will be included in the chapter on Vedic astrology.

In Tantric thought, all deities have Agni and Soma,5 fiery and watery, solar and lunar forms. The fiery forms are generally regarded as harsh, destructive, protective or purifying in energy. The watery or lunar forms are soft, creative, nurturing or rejuvenating. For Lord Shiva, for example, Shiva or Shankara is the benefic or lunar form, while Rudra or Bhairava is the fierce or solar form. For the Goddess, Parvati or Sundari is the benefic or lunar form, while Durga or Chandi is the fierce or solar form. Below are indicated some of the most important Hindu deities and a few of their many mantras, emphasizing the seed sounds or bija mantras.6

## Shiva/ Rudra

Shiva is the deity of the universal life force and of the Supreme Being. He has control of Vayu and of Vata dosha, which he calms and harmonizes. His is the light of pure awareness. His energy controls the mind and helps counter emotional and psychological disturbances. His main bija mantras are *Oṁ *or *Hauṁ*. His main name mantra, which is probably the most famous of all name mantras, is: *Oṁ Namaâ Śivàya*\! Sometimes additional bijas are added to this like *Oṁ Hrãṁ Hauṁ Namaâ Śivàya*\!

Rudra is the fierce form of Shiva. He relates to Agni and to fire. He is the deity ruling over fevers and grants recovery from them, including all manner of infectious and contagious diseases. He is also the deity governing over Ayus or longevity. He helps us overcome death-threatening diseases, accidents or circumstances. His Vedic mantra is the Mrityunjaya \(Tryambakam\) mantra and the famous Rudram, a long set of chants from the Yajurveda.

Other important forms of Shiva include Yogeshvara, the Lord of Yoga, and Dakshinamurti, the great teacher of Self-knowledge. A shorter set of mantras can be used for these forms of Shiva as well: *Oṁ Hauṁ Jïṁ Saâ\!*

## Ganesha

Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity, is an important deity in Yoga and in Vedic sciences in general. Ganesha rules over the forces of time and dispenses the fruits of karma. As such, he is specifically a deity for Vedic astrology, and his image is found on Vedic astrology charts. He works to destroy all obstacles and is propitiated before any major endeavor. This extends to healing as he destroys all obstacles to health or well-being. In addition he grants wisdom and skill, the two main qualities needed for any endeavor to succeed.

Ganesha is the first son of Shiva and Parvati, and is especially close to Parvati. He carries the grace of the Goddess. Through him the power of Shakti is dispensed to us, just as electricity is channeled into various currents and circuits. Ganesha is worshipped in the root chakra to stabilize the Kundalini force, which he turns into a force of knowledge. His Tantric bija mantra is *Glauṁ*. His main name mantra is:

*Oṁ Gaṁ Gaçeíàya Namaâ**\! or **Oṁ Gaṁ Gaçapataye Namaâ**\!*

## Skanda

Skanda is the second son of Shiva and Parvati. He relates more to Shiva as Ganesha does to Parvati. He is the Divine youth that destroys all negativity. He reflects Agni or fire as a cosmic principle and as our own inner fire or indwelling soul. He brings us the deepest Self-knowledge and the most direct Self-realization. His main mantra is:* **Oṁ Śaravaça Bhava**\!*

## Krishna

Krishna is the form of Vishnu that holds all yogic powers, including all healing energies for our emotional nature. He is the incarnation of Divine love, bliss and all higher Yoga teachings. Krishna represents the magnetic energy of Divine love to take us back to the source of life. Astrologically, he is connected to the Moon. Those seeking the unfoldment of Raja Yoga should worship him. The *Hare Kêṣça *mantra for him is well known. An important mantra for him is: *Oṁ Klãṁ Kêṣçàya Namaâ\! *Also used is the name mantra *Om namo bhagavate vasudevaya**.*

## Rama

Rama is the incarnation of Vishnu as the ideal king and protector, the representative of dharma. Worshipping him protects us from all negativity externally and purifies our minds and hearts internally. His energy is of a solar nature, but its gentle and nurturing side, not its destructive heat. His energy is particularly good for children and for countering Vata disorders \(disturbances of the nervous system\). His seed mantra is simply *Ràṁ *or*: Jai Śrã Ràṁ**\!*

## Vishnu

Vishnu is most worshipped through his incarnations as Krishna and Rama. Perhaps his most common mantra is the Narayana name mantra: *Oṁ Namo Naràyaçàya*\! Another important Vishnu mantra is *Oṁ Hrãṁ Hrãṁ Oṁ Viṣçave Namaâ*\!

## Hanuman

Hanuman, the monkey-faced God, is the son of Vayu, the wind God. He represents the higher force of prana behind Vata dosha. He promotes healing, rejuvenation and longevity. He also has the knowledge of and represents the power of all the healing forces of nature.

Hanuman is the ideal Yogi who grants skill in asana and pranayama as well as the supreme power of devotion. While he is devoted to Sita and Rama, he is often regarded as an aspect of Shiva. His main seed mantra is the prana mantra *Haṁ *or*: Oṁ Haṁ Hanumate Namaâ*\! *Hauṁ *is also used for him as Hanuman is regarded as an incarnation of Lord Shiva.

## Dhanvantari

Ayurveda uses the form of Dhanvantari, an incarnation of the cosmic power of healing, as its main deity. His image is the most common image found in Ayurvedic schools and clinics everywhere. Dhanvantari is a form of Vishnu, who rules over the forces of preservation in the universe, which include healing. Stotras to him are commonly chanted before Ayurvedic classes and programs. Dhanvantari's mantra is: *Oṁ Dhaṁ Dhanvantaraye Namaâ*\!

## Lakshmi

Lakshmi is the wife of Lord Vishnu, the cosmic preserver and protector. She grants health, wealth, beauty, fertility, happiness and abundance – all the good things of life that the great majority of people are ever seeking. She is a special deity for women and helps with women's health problems, gynecological disorders, fertility issues, menopause, and so on. She relates primarily to the water element but to some extent to earth as well \(particularly as the Goddess Sita, the wife of Rama\). Her Tantric form is Kamalatmika, who unfolds the higher grace of Divine bliss. Her main seed mantra is *Śrãṁ *or three syllabled as: *Śrãṁ Hrãṁ Klãṁ*\!

## Sarasvati

Sarasvati is the wife of Lord Brahma, the cosmic creator, and the Goddess of knowledge. She gives wisdom, intelligence and good memory along with skill in the fine arts, music, dance and literature. She is worshipped for learning and education. Her Tantric form is Matangi, who dispenses all the inner and secret knowledge of mantras, plants, and all the forces of nature. Her main mantra is the guru bija *Aiṁ*. Another good set of bijas for her is: *Hrãṁ Aiṁ Dhãṁ*\!

## Sundari

Sundari is a Goddess of love, beauty, delight and Soma. She is the deity of the mystic Moon which is also the energy of the crown chakra. Her grace is most sought after in the higher Yoga practices. She allows the immortal Soma nectar to flow from the thousand-petal lotus above, granting all higher powers of speech and mantra. Generally called Tripura Sundari or the "Beauty of the Three Worlds", she represents the benign aspect of Shiva's consort, whose fierce form is Kali.

Somewhat like Krishna, Sundari holds the magnetic power of attraction but more from the knowledge side. Other blissful forms of the Goddess relate to her including Lalita and Rajarajeshvari and even Lakshmi. Mantra Siddhi or perfection in mantra in the broadest sense is given by her. Her mantras are: *Aiṁ Klãṁ Sauâ *as three syllabled, or *Hrãṁ Śrãṁ Klãṁ Aiṁ Sauâ *as five syllabled.

## Durga

Durga represents the Great Mother in her protective role. She rides a lion and carries the weapons of the Gods and leads the army of the Gods to destroy all negativity. Worshipping her is one of the best places to begin to honor the Mother. Kali is often regarded as her fiercer manifestation.

Durga rules over the universe and directs each soul to its real purpose, awakening the higher intelligence of nature within us. At a deeper level of Yoga practice, fiery

Durga represents the awakened Kundalini fire, controlled by the power of tapas or self-discipline, which turns it into a force of splendor and majesty. The Kundalini once purified, awakened and seated on the throne of the heart becomes Durga. If we honor Durga, she will guide our sadhana and transform us in the inner light. Durga's prime mantra is: *Oṁ Duṁ Durgàyai Namaâ*\! Another good mantra for her protection is: *Oṁ Hrãṁ Krãṁ Duṁ Durgàyai Svàhà*\!

## Kali

The Goddess Kali is one of the main deities of the practice of Yoga. She represents the reabsorption of the time bound universe back into its eternal source. She governs over the process of mergence. She is the power through which earth is dissolved into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into ether, ether into mind and mind into pure consciousness. She represents the movement back through the Tattvas to the Purusha beyond them. She grants the highest strength, energy and vitality, but one must be strong oneself in order to carry her indomitable force.

Kali relates to the great prana mantra *Krãṁ*. It also occurs as three syllables -*Krãṁ Hïṁ Hrãṁ *– or as seven syllables: *Krãṁ Krãṁ Krãṁ Hïṁ Hïṁ Hrãṁ Hrãṁ*. Another set of three syllables for Kali is: *Hrãṁ Śrãṁ Krãṁ*\! Kali grants the prana of eternity that can overcome all the negative energies born of time.

## Dattatreya

Dattatreya is a combined form of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, as well as a great ancient sage and yogi who was taught by nature. His mantra is very important because in the absence of a guru, one can pray to Dattatreya for guidance and for empowerment of mantras: *Oṁ Dràṁ Dattatreyàya Namaâ*\!

## Other Deities

There are detailed teachings in the Puranas and Tantras about various deities, their worship and their corresponding mantras, names and rituals. The Buddhist and Jain traditions have similar teachings about Sanskrit mantras. Other spiritual and religious traditions have their own sets of Divine Names, including not only Biblical traditions but pagan and Native traditions of all types. We should always remember the connection between mantra, devotion and Divine names. Even bija mantras should be approached with reverence as representing Divine powers, as the seeds of Divine names.
