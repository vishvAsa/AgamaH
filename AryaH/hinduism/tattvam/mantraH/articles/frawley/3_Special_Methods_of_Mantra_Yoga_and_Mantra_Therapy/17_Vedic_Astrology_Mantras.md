Vedic astrology is the main Vedic science connected to Mantra Yoga. There are two reasons for this. First, Vedic astrology provides us with the keys to choose mantras and correctly time their usage. Traditionally in India, mantras and even the names of children are chosen based upon astrological considerations. Second, mantras work on a subtle level that reflects the same forces as the planets and stars. While astrological positions are patterns of cosmic light, mantras are patterns of cosmic sound. Most mantras are astrological in nature or application, and all mantras can be looked at from an astrological angle.

Specific astrological mantras, like those for the nine planets, are extremely helpful because the astrological chart covers all our karmas in life. Astrological mantras can be used for all the four goals of life of dharma, artha, kama and moksha. Astrological mantras, like Ayurvedic mantras, can also be used for healing body and mind. As spiritual, liberation or moksha mantras, astrological mantras can help us improve our Yoga practice or sadhana. *In this regard, planetary mantras are perhaps the most important and easiest to use of all mantras in any mantra therapy.*

Vedic astrology contains a well defined Mantra therapy, probably more so than any other Vedic science. Mantra therapy is an important remedial measure \(upaya\) in Vedic astrology. Vedic astrology has special mantras for the planets, the signs of the zodiac and the 27 Nakshatras \(lunar constellations\) to help us harmonize the astrological influences in our lives. Vedic astrologers commonly prescribe these for their clients and use them for themselves.

Vedic astrology can be called the "Vedic science of karma". It tells us what our karmas are likely to be and when they are likely to unfold during the course of our lives. Yet Vedic astrology does not simply leave us helpless before karma, it teaches us how to optimize, modify and transcend our karma. For improving our karmas, the main inner method used in Vedic astrology is the use of mantra. The main outer method used is planetary gemstones, but even these can only be effective if first empowered by mantras.

## Timing of Mantras

Astrological timing is an important means of energizing and empowering mantras and making them more efficacious. Vedic astrology can tell us the best times to begin or change our mantra practice. All mantras are usually first given according to an auspicious time defined by the astrology. They are usually repeated with some regularity defined according to the rules of astrology relative to the time of the day, the phases of the Moon, the seasons of the year, or according to special timing factors relative to the birth chart of the individual.

Certain moments in time are what we could call "mantras in time". These are special junctures in time that determine the nature of what happens afterwards. At such key moments, time and mantra can unite to bring about great transformation. Such "mantric junctures in time" include sunrise, noon and sunset during the day, new and full moons during the month, equinoxes, solstices and eclipses during the year, and powerful planetary combinations at a yet broader level.

Relative to the individual birth chart, such key moments begin with the birth itself, and include beginnings of planetary periods and important planetary transits. Relative to life events, such special times include marriage, birth of children, starting of new ventures, entering a home and all the main events that color our existence. There are special ways to use mantras to improve our karmas at such moments.

Timing in Vedic astrology is part of "Horary astrology" or Muhurta. Muhurta considers the planetary energies operating on a daily basis, particularly those of the Moon. These factors are presented in a Vedic calendar or Panchanga, which emphasizes five main considerations. These are the 1\) day of the week based upon which planet rules the day; 2\) Nakshatra - Lunar constellation in which the moon is located; 3\) Tithi - lunar phase or lunar day; 4\) Karana - half of the tithi; 5\) Yoga - specific distances of the Sun and Moon.

For choosing a mantra, a good Vedic astrologer will additionally consider the birth chart of the person, their relevant *Dashas* or planetary periods, transits to the birth chart, and the annual chart \(Varshaphala\). This can take some time and effort to examine correctly. One's astrological birth chart has its own resonances in cosmic sound that can be uncovered through the sounds of the planets, signs and Nakshatras. We will examine these below.

## Name Mantras for the Planets

Vedic planetary mantras address the deity or power of consciousness behind the material energy of the planet and are not just an honoring of the planet in the outer sense. Vedic astrology has special mantras for the planets based upon their names. In addition to the main name mantras for the planets, each planet has its broader hundred names, its Stotra or hymn of praise and its Kavacha or hymn of protection. There are also special Vedic verses to the planetary deities and to the Nakshatras that are often used in rituals.1 Most important are the following names of the nine planets and their seed syllables.2
**Planet Sanskrit Name** **Mantra**   Sun Sïr ya Oṁ Sïṁ Sïr yàya Namaâ   Moon Candra Oṁ Caṁ Candràya Namaâ   Mars Kuja Oṁ Kuṁ Kujàya Namaâ   Mercury Budha Oṁ Buṁ Budhàya Namaâ   Jupiter Bêhaspati Oṁ Bêṁ Bêhaspataye Namaâ   Venus Śukra Oṁ Śuṁ Śukràya Namaâ   Saturn Śani Oṁ Śaṁ Śanaye Namaâ   North Node of Moon Ràhu Oṁ Ràṁ Ràhave Namaâ   South Node of Moon Ketu Oṁ Keṁ Ketave Namaâ   


Below is a special set of Tantric bija mantras for the planets that is often used as well.3 Each set of mantras consists of a set of variations on one primary bija mantra that reflect the planet itself.
**Planet Seed Mantra** **Extended Mantra**   Sun Hrãṁ Oṁ Hràm Hrãṁ Hrauṁ Saâ Sïr yàya Namaâ   Moon Śrãm Oṁ Śràṁ Śrãm Śrauṁ Saâ Candràya Namaâ   Mars Krãṁ Oṁ Kràṁ Krãṁ Krauṁ Saâ Kujàya Namaâ   Mercury Brãṁ Oṁ Bràṁ Brãṁ Brauṁ Saâ Budhàya Namaâ   Jupiter\* Grãṁ Oṁ Gràṁ Grãṁ Grauṁ Saâ Gurave Namaâ   Venus Drãṁ Oṁ Dràṁ Drãṁ Drauṁ Saâ Śukràya Namaâ   Saturn Prãṁ Oṁ Pràṁ Prãṁ Prauṁ Saâ Śanaye Namaâ   Rahu Bhrãṁ Oṁ Bhràṁ Bhrãṁ Bhrauṁ Saâ Ràhave Namaâ   Ketu Strãṁ Oṁ Stràṁ Strãṁ Strauṁ Saâ Ketave Namaâ   

\* Planets often have several names. Here Guru, the teacher, is the name used for Jupiter, which is also called Brihaspati.

Such mantras are usually recited at least 108 times on the days that belong to the planets: Sunday for the Sun, Monday for the Moon, Tuesday for Mars, Wednesday for Mercury, Thursday for Jupiter, Friday for Venus and Saturday for Saturn. For Rahu one can use Saturday, as Rahu is like Saturn in nature. For Ketu one can use Tuesday, as Ketu is like Mars in nature.

Instead of the bija mantras for the names of the planets, the Shakti mantras can be used instead, like *Oṁ Hrãṁ Sïryàya Namaâ*\! Or more than one bija can be used like *Oṁ Aiṁ Hrãṁ Śrãṁ Candràya Namaâ*. Such combinations should be learned and practiced with the appropriate guidance.4

Relative to Ayurveda, one should remember that most Vata disorders and most diseases in general are caused by Saturn and Rahu. Most Pitta disorders are owing to Mars and Ketu. Most Kapha disorders are owing to the Moon. Mantras for the planets can be used to counter diseases owing to the planets, as well as to strengthen the parts of the body that the planets rule over.5 Besides planetary name mantras, there many other astrological mantras and mantra formulas used in Vedic and yogic practices. There are ways of correlating the Sanskrit alphabet with the planets, Nakshatras and signs of the zodiac. These are found in books on Vedic astrology and are too complex to bring in here.

1 These include the Navagraha Sukta and the Nakshatra Sukta, as well as special Vedic mantras for the deity, over deity and supreme deity of each planet, examined in author's book Ayurvedic Astrology.

2 It is best to do some mantras for Ganesha before starting any planetary mantras, as Ganesha is the great Lord of Karma.

3 Some variations on these mantras exist particularly for Saturn, Rahu and Ketu.

4 The same Shakti mantras can be used as relative to the mantra to the Supreme Light \(Paramjyoti Mantra\) combined with or used apart from the usual bija Hrim, depending upon circumstances.
