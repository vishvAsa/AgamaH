Hindu self-cultivation gives one joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various goals of life(puruShArtha), including [dharma](../../social-cultivation/dharma/). This includes attainment of mystic "highs" as a matter of course. With spiritual practices and saMskAra-s, a hindu gets both intellectual and emotional appreciation for his place in the world-tree.

## Anti-self-pity
Contrary to some memetic epidemics which focus on grievance studies and victimhood, the hindu way focuses on positivity - always encouraging the urge to pull oneself up.

> A tamasic, indolent, self-pitying nature (Krsna chides the weeping Arjuna's newfound 'unmanliness/impurity' as being *anarya-juShTam*; unbefitting an Aryan, or even more, befitting a non-Aryan!) won't do!
