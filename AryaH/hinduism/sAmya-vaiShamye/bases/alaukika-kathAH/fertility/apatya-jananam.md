one first hand tale someone I know did not beget children given his secular outlook he went to doctors and specialists upon all the tests & wait for 4 yrs was told it's unexplained infertality nothing can be done hence recommended IUI/ IVF. 

however he had learned rudra as child. so was recommended to do rudra abhisheka starting with sadyojata to Ishana mantras. because of his ego he made a challenge with me & others that he will do this for 48 days & only if get pregnant within 3 months will ascribe this to these actions other wise coincidence. they did get pregnant within 3 weeks since 48th day. It took me by surprise as well!
