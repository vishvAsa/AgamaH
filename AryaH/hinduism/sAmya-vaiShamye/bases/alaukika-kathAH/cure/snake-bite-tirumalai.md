My father-in-law's father (PVK/Shabdam?-Vangipuram/Bharadvaja settled in Tirumalai and traditionally sishyas of a Tirupati-Swamy) apparently had some similar siddhi in snakebite-venom removal. My FIL had observed him do it a few times in his childhood. Unfortunately he had passed away by the time my FIL was 10 or so. So other than witnessing the event, my FIL didn't know much about it.
