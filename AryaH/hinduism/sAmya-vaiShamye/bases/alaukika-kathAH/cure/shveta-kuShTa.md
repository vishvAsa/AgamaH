There was this vaidika and a vidvān. He had a set of students learning śruti from him. All of a sudden, one of his student went incommunicado. The vaidika paid him a visit. It turned out the student developed white kuṣṭha and became depressed. Medications weren't working.. It was so worse that he quit his job and rarely came out of his room. The student asked "Guruji, you often say śruti has solutions for laukika problems. Is there no remedy for me?"

The vaidika remembered a prayoga given in vidhāna of indra specifically for this issue. The procedure itself is simple (relatively speaking). It involves doing the japa. It turned out the śveta kuṣṭha started clearing and was completely gone even before he completed the count as per text. Still he finished the japa and homa as per saṅkalpa. Narrating this incident, the vaidika gave me the copy of vidhāna of indra.

The vaidika mentioned that this incident reinforced his shraddhā on śruti. We discussed other prayogas in the aindra text and our conversation veered towards abhichāra and pratikriya. 

We discussed the somayāga where the entire affair is within a single day - upasads, soma pressing, all on same day. We discussed simpler vidhāna style homa. I asked about the mantras of pratīchīna angirasa, popularly used as mantras of atharvaṇabhadrakāli. He made a curious remark that he'd personally first use apratiratham if it were him. And this leads into second story involving apratiratham. 

Of "purifier of angiras" 1 crore times. It goes as "swan stationed in purity..." +++(hamsasshuchiShad)+++.
