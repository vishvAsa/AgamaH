A friend once contacted us regarding a problem his friend was facing. The problem was an acute abhichāra that was on-going. The guy already had close brush with death twice in that week. He was so shaken up that he practically locked himself in that room.

His vaiṣṇava guru was traveling and uncontactable. He should have listened to his guru and performed the puraścharaṇa of +++(hayagrIva)+++ mantras given to him a year back. He was lax. 

His contact, an adept at dūradṛśṭi was able to confirm that the attacker was his former girlfriend. Apparently the breakup was messy. The contact gave a deadline of upcoming full-moon. If nothing was done, the guy is looking at prospects if severe injury if not death.

Options were discussed and bunch of suggestions were proposed. Suddenly, I asked whether the boy had learned veda. Turns out he indeed had learned large portions taittiriya. Probably the kid can save himself! Now we were in business. He indeed had learned apratiratham which was the key. He was unmarried. Hence an aupāsana fire based ritual is out of question. We were able to put together a simple homa for deployment of apratiratham, sent it across and wished good luck.

I completely forgot about the incident and months rolled by. One day I casually asked about the guy - whatever happened to him. My friend responded, "He's fine. The former girlfriend slipped and fell from stairs on the following full-moon. She had a prolonged stay at the hospital". I said to myself- "interesting...". Fell and broke her head....
