Source: vAhana, 1st hand

A relative a govt official was being harassed by goons. From a distance people from the siddheshvarI-pIThaM(?)noticed this and remarked: Dont you need weapons to defend against such? They did not give any mantra but a dhyAna shloka &chitra paTa with yantra. Results were very good. This was narrated to me when I noticed a bagalA chitra paTa in their pUja room and asked about it during a visit.
