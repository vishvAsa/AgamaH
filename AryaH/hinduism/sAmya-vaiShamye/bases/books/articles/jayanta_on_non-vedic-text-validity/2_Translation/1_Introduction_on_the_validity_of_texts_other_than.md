title = "1 Introduction on the validity of texts other than the Veda"

+++
He \(a pupil raising a question\) says:

Is this validity already explained \( *ittham*\) established only in regard to the Vedas |

or can the same way of reasoning \[be applied\] to all other sacred texts? ||

\[R.:\] And what follows from that? 

\[Obj.:\] In the former view, what is the reply \( *uttara*\) to the others who say so \(i.e., that the other texts are also valid\)? |37

in the latter \[view\], by contrast, they \(sacred texts other than the Veda\) would all end up being false, since they contradict each other ||38

My dear pupil, which texts do you have in mind, when you aski \[these questions\]? Purāṇas, Itihāsas \[and\] Dharmaśāstras, or Śaiva, Pāśupata, Pañcarātra, Buddhist and Jaina \[texts\]? 

Among them, to begin with, \[let us say that\] we shall explain the Śaiva and the other \[texts belonging to the second group\] later.
