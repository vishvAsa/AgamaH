title = "1 2 Introductory study: Jayanta between Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā"

+++

Bhaṭṭa Jayanta was a Kaśmīri philosopher active during the reign of Śaṅkaravarman \(reg. 883-902 AD2\). Three works of him are extant, the short compendium *Nyāyakalikā*, the philosophical drama *Āgamaḍambara *\(henceforth ĀḌ\) and his opus magnum, the *Nyāyamañjarī* \(henceforth NM\). Throughout his works, Jayanta displays a thorough knowledge of Nyāya, but also of Mīmāṃsā, and is especially precious as a source for the thought of Kumārila, whose works rarely achieve the same clarity of expression of those by Jayanta \(on this topic, see also section II.3\). 

The NM is divided in twelve books \( *āhnika*\), which discuss the definitions \( *lakṣaṇasūtra*\) found in the *Nyāyasūtra *\(henceforth NS\). Alone NS 1.1.7, i.e. “Language \[as an instrument of knowledge\] is the teaching of a reliable \[speaker\]” \( *āptopadeśaḥ śabdaḥ*\) is discussed for four out of the twelve books, i.e., NM 3-6. The passage we examine and translate here \(henceforth called SĀP3\) is located within NM 4. Table 1 illustrates the contents of NM 4:4

Thus, the SĀP follows the establishment of God as author of the Veda. The demonstration that God is the author of the Veda relies on the fact that God can perceive dharma, 1Namely, Kataoka 2005, Kataoka 2007a, Kataoka 2008, Kataoka 2009, Kataoka 2010, Kataoka 2011a.

[^3]: As explained in Kataoka 2007b, p. 77, fn. 11, the designation *Sarvāgamaprāmāṇya * derives from the appellative *sarvāgamaprāmāṇyavādin * attributed to Saṅkarṣaṇa in the ĀḌ \(Dezső 2005, p. 196\).

and, therefore, overtly contradicts the Mīmāṃsā tenet that the Veda is the *only * instrument to know dharma \(see below, section II.4.1\). Nonetheless, Jayanta accommodates both Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā approaches in his SĀP, turning the Mīmāṃsā criterion into the need for a connection with the Veda, insofar as this is the exemplary text on dharma \(although no longer the only possible source for the knowledge of dharma\). The usage of Nyāya arguments along with Mīmāṃsā ones also in regard to the Veda, which could be considered as the specific field of Mīmāṃsā, harmonises with Jayanta’s general point that the Nyāya is the only system which can establish the Veda’s *validity*, since the Mīmāṃsā rather focuses on its exegesis \(see SĀP section 5.2.2.4; on this topic see also Halbfass 1986-92 and Kataoka 2007a\). The joint usage of Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya arguments is a fixed pattern in the NM, see, e.g., NM 9, Vijñānadvaita section, where the differences between the two systems are ignored in order for them to fight against their common enemy, the Buddhists.5 Also in the ĀḌ, Mīmāṃsakas and Naiyāyikas join forces against the “haters of the Veda” \(Dezső 2005, p. 186\). 

As for the immediately preceding section, the Vedic status of the Atharvaveda was very controversial \(it is, for instance, not accepted by our earliest witnesses, such as Kauṭilya’s *Arthaśāstra*, which only speaks of the Veda as *trayī*, nor has it ever been accepted by Mīmāṃsakas\). 

In order to establish its position as part of the Vedic canon, Jayanta demonstrates that it is a valid sacred text insofar as it has been uttered by God. Consequently, the SĀP opens with a disciple asking whether this procedure can be repeated also for *all * the texts which claim to be sacred texts. 

In the SĀP \(see Table of Contents\), Jayanta presents Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā views on the topic of the validity of sacred texts, dividing them into two or three sub-topics, namely: 1. 

validity, \(2. invalidity\) and 3. conflict among different sacred texts or between one of them and the Veda. 

## 1.2.1 Survey of Research

After Paul Hacker has driven the scholars’ attention on the SĀP in his essay on *Religious* *Tolerance and Intolerance in Hinduism *\(Hacker 1957\), the SĀP has been closely examined only in Wezler 1976 and, much later, in the critical edition and Japanese translation by Kei Kataoka \(Kataoka 2004a and Kataoka 2007b\). 

As for more general works, Janaki Vallabha Bhattacharyya has translated into English the first six books of the NM \(Bhattacharyya 1978\), including the SĀP. The translation is a good introduction to the text, but does not aim at carefully reflecting the Sanskrit original and is of very difficult consultation, due to the lack of any index and of any further textual partition \(even verses and quotes are not signalled at all\), apart from the one into *āhnika* s and of random headings, not numbered nor reported in the summary. Moreover, due to the fact that it does not distinguish the translation of the text from additional comments, it might be misleading if one consults it independently of the Sanskrit text. Last, it lacks any annotation, and this makes passages such as the one about the Śyena sacrifice \(sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3.2\) unintelligible, nor does it attempt to explain the logic of difficult passages \(see for instance fn. 45\). We indicated the cases of important dissent from this translation. 

Nagin J. Shah, the editor of the only extant early commentary on the NM, Cakradhara’s *Granthibhaṅga *\(henceforth NMGBh, Shah 1972\), has published a Gujarātī translation of the NM \(Shah 1975-1992\) and a synopsis of its contents \(Shah 1992-97\). The translation is overall reliable \(even more than Bhattacharyya 1978\); it immediately follows each portion of the Sanskrit text and the short glosses are indicated as such. However, it does not solve all the problems of the text, also because Shah may rely on Gujarātī equivalents of complicated 5“Enough of this talk\! Why at present do we \[have to\] attack a Brahmin \[colleague\], letting a Buddhist off the hook?” \( *tad alam anayā kathayā. kim iti śākyam utsṛjya śrotriyam idānīm abhiyuñjmahe*, Kataoka 2003a, p. 284; translated in Watson and Kataoka 2010, p. 338\).

Sanskrit terms. As above, we indicated only cases of important dissent. 

The present translation improves on the preceding ones also because of its sounder basis, i.e., the critical edition presented in Kataoka 2004a and because its narrower focus made it possible to focus on a careful study of sources and parallel passages and, through that, to acquire a deeper understanding of some complex passages. 

## 1.2.2 The SĀP and the ĀḌ

The passage under examination is closely linked to the topic of the ĀḌ and many parallel passages have indeed been located in Kataoka 2004a. The general point of both texts is the same, insofar as both indicate that all sacred texts can be regarded as valid, with a few exceptions. Their validity is in both texts argued for from both a Mīmāṃsāka and a Naiyāyika point of view. 

This similarity of approach and content lets the rare points of divergence appear in a striking way. These are:

1. The validity of Pāñcarātra texts, which are admitted among the valid sacred texts together with the Śaiva ones in the SĀP \(although only with a negative formulation, i.e., as “not invalid”\), whereas the ĀḌ is much more cautious \(SĀP section 5.1.1; ĀḌ prelude to act four, Dezső 2005, pp. 194-196\). 

2. The status of several Śaiva cults, which are seen with more suspicion in the ĀḌ, whereas the SĀP states that Śaivas do not contradict the Veda and does not deal extensively with more “problematic” Śaiva and Śākta sects \(SĀP section 5.1.1; see also section 6.2.2.2; ĀḌ prelude to act four, Dezső 2005, p. 194, ll.11-12\). 

One could try to solve the problem by considering the fact that the Pāñcarātrins are only mentioned in passing in the SĀP, whereas they are a main topic of the ĀḌ, since the queen seems to favour them. Moreover, one might add that the ĀḌ could reflect a later stage of Jayanta’s thought.6

A different tentative explanation is to consider the distinct purpose of the two texts. The ĀḌ tells the story of Saṅkarṣaṇa who is appointed by king Śaṅkaravarman as a sort of “Minister of religious affairs”. Thus, his position is not so far from that of the historical Jayanta, who was also a minister of Śaṅkaravarman. Due to his political role, Saṅkarṣaṇa needs to look at religions also from the point of view of their social impact. Consequently, he needs to take care of antisocial religious practices, such as the ones of some Śaiva ascetics. He also needs to take care of the disturbing behaviour of the Pāñcarātrins, who claim to be brahmans, and thus intervene in the brahmans’ assemblies.7 Thus, it is understandable that Saṅkarṣaṇa needs to clean out the religious horizon. Since Jayanta himself is mentioned negatively by some Śaiva ascetics in the ĀḌ \( *taśśa amacce dulāālajayaṃte*, \* *tasyāmātyo durācārajayan-taḥ *“Jayanta, his \(Śaṅkaravarman’s\) minister who acted wrongly”, Dezső 2005, p. 130, l.7\), one might imagine that he also took part to similar campaigns.8 To sum up, the ĀḌ is occa-6About the relative chronology of ĀḌ and NM we have only an indirect evidence, namely: “Since a verse that is quoted in the play \(Act Four, verse 53\) as Jayanta’s wise saying \( *sūkta*\) is also found in the NM \(NM, p. 640 \[SĀP, 6.1.1.2\]\), it seems probable that Jayanta wrote the ĀḌ following his major work on Nyāya” \(Dezső 2005, p. 16\). The same piece of evidence had already been mentioned in Raghavan 1964, p. xxvi. \(Here and wherever Dezső 2005 has been quoted, its transcriptions have been adapted to the Kyoto-Harvard standard\). 

[^7]: This is a standard allegation against Pāñcarātrins, see Yāmunācārya’s Āgamaprāmāṇya \(Narasimhachary 1976, pp. 11-16; 141-2, quoted in Dezső 2004, pp. 92-94. 

[^8]: The whole passage reads as follows: “King Śaṅkaravarman’s cruelty is public knowledge. That brahmin, his adviser, the wicked Jayanta is even rougher than he. They nabbed the mendicants black-blankets \[the Nīlāmbaras\], beat them to jelly, and expelled them from the kingdom, on the ground that they were outside Vedic religion. And if any other mendicant is caught who is outside Vedic religion, he’ll be beaten up, killed, thrown in jail, or slain”. 

\(Dezső 2005, p. 131\)

sioned also by a concrete problem, that of the coexistence of various religious observances, and particularly of some extreme practices \(see Kataoka 2007b, p. 45\). 

By contrast, the SĀP has chiefly theoretical aims as shown already by the fact that it focuses on texts rather than on practices. Therefore, it can deal with the abstract problem of the validity of other sacred texts and only mentions the issue of deviant religious practice insofar as it has an impact on the criterion of the acceptance by exemplary people \(see section 5.2\). 

Accordingly, it can be more open towards the other religions, seen as sets of sacred texts rather than as social practices. The historical “occasion” of the SĀP is in fact the intellectual interest on the validity of sacred texts which originated around the middle of the first millennium AD

and had become much stronger by the time of Jayanta \(suffice here to mention Yāmunācārya’s *Āgamaprāmāṇya*, on the validity of Pāñcarātra9\). This interest focused on the problem of the validity of sacred texts other than the Veda and was probably linked with the raise of beliefs external to the Veda, which needed an intellectual discussion and/or an apologetics. Apart from Buddhist and Jaina discussions about the validity of the Buddha’s and the Jina’s word, even “Hindū” authors had to loosen their criteria in order to make room for new beliefs. As noted in Kataoka 2007b, p. 47, already Kumārila feels the need to address the problem of non-Vedic beliefs and concludes that from a certain point of view one can speak of validity in regard to them all \( *sarveṣāṃ prāmāṇyam*, TV ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 168, l.20\), since the non-Vedic elements entailed in, e.g., Buddhist texts, can be read in an instrumental way, e.g., as encouraging one to give up one’s attachment to worldly things. By contrast, Kumārila is much less tolerant when it comes to the acceptance of other religious *practices*.10

The practical concern re-emerges, within the SĀP, in the last section, where the king Śaṅkaravarman’s campaigns against the Nīlāmbaras are mentioned and, accordingly, the restrictions listed for texts to be admitted as valid are stricter than what had been established until that point. For instance, although section 6.1.2 already showed that one’s inner hesitation is not a criterion, section 6.3 lists it among the preconditions for the validity of a sacred text. 

## 1.2.3 Jayanta’s sources

As shown in detail in the apparatus of Kataoka 2004a, the main source of Jayanta within the SĀP is Kumārila, especially ŚV codanā and TV ad 1.3.1–4. Kumārila’s text influences both form and content of the SĀP \(for more details see also section II.4.6.1\). That Jayanta was a close reader of Kumārila is evident also in the rest of the NM \(for a critical assessment of the value of Jayanta as often the first available commentator on Kumārila, see Kataoka 2008, pp. 210-209\). 

A direct acquaintance with Śabara, independently of Kumārila’s interpretation of the ŚBh, can be detected in some formal agreements \(e.g., in the opposition of *kḷpta * and *kalpya * in section 2.1.2, which repeats ŚBh ad 1.3.3, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 184, l.1\), and also in some theoretical matters, for instance in the view about the connection of Veda and recollected tradition mentioned in section 2.1.1.2.1 and in Jayanta’s way of solving the Śyena-dilemma \(see below, section II.4.5\). Furthermore, in section 2.1.3 Jayanta follows Śabara’s way of interpreting JS 1.3.2, with *anumāna * meaning ‘recollected tradition’ rather than Kumārila’s way of understanding *anumāna * as the instrument of knowledge through which one infers that the 9A longer list is discussed in Kataoka 2007b, pp. 46–47. That the topic was at the center of the intellectual debate is proved also by its inclusion in various Śaiva texts, such as the end of Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s commentary on Sadyojyotis’

*Mokṣakārikā * and Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka*, chapter XXXV. On Abhinavagupta’s approach to the authority of sacred texts see Torella 2012. 

[^10]: On this topic, see Eltschinger’s remark that Kumārila’s critique of Buddhist *philosophy * may be tough, but remains fair, whereas the same author can pay gall when it comes to the social impact of Buddhism, Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Pāñcarātra, Pāśupata, etc. \(Eltschinger 2007, pp. 39-40, especially fn.38\). Eltschinger focuses on the distinction between the approach of the ŚV and that of the TV, whereas the quote above shows that even the TV is in this regard less monolithic than one could think. 

7

recollected tradition is based on the Veda.11 That Jayanta follows Śabara is also established by the last sentence of the same section, which echoes JS 1.3.2 as understood by Śabara: *tasmān* *manvādismṛtaya eva pramāṇam*. 

As for Prabhākara, we could not locate a precise passage of his *Bṛhatī * which could have been the source for Jayanta in the SĀP,12 and the chronology of Prabhākara’s main commentator, Śālikanātha Miśra, is not yet fixed. Prabhākara is mentioned as a source in the NMGBh, for instance in the commentary on *viṣayavibhāgena*, section 2.2.2. 

## 1.2.4 Establishing the validity of sacred texts

### 1.2.4.1 Validity of the Veda

Jayanta’s approach to the problem of the validity of sacred texts depends on two main sources, Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya. In synthesis, Mīmāṃsā authors argue in favour of the validity of the Veda due to the fact that it is the only instrument of knowledge through which one can know dharma. Mīmāṃsakas divide in fact what can be known into two precincts, on the one hand common experience, which encompasses what can be known through sense-perception and the other instruments of knowledge \(inference, analogy and cogent evidence, to which Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā authors add absence\), which ultimately depend on perceptual data. On the other hand there is dharma, which cannot be known through sense-perception and for which, therefore, the Veda is the only instrument of knowledge. Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā authors also claim that all cognitions, *qua * cognitions, are in themselves valid, unless and until a subsequent cognition invalidates them \(the theory is called *svataḥ prāmāṇya*, see Taber 1992 and Kataoka 2011b, pp. 60-98\). However, since the Veda cannot be invalidated by data of different origin, given that it is the only instrument of knowledge regarding dharma, it remains valid. 

The Nyāya approach, by contrast, considers the Veda an instance of testimony. Just like testimony is an instrument of knowledge if the speaker is reliable, similarly the Veda is reliable since it has been uttered by a reliable speaker. The characteristic marks of a reliable speaker are, according to Pakṣilasvāmin’s commentary on NS 1.1.7:

1. He must have perceived the things about which he speaks \( *sākṣātkṛtadharma*\) 2. He must undertake the action of speaking out of the desire to communicate the things as he has seen them \( *yathādṛṣṭasyārthasya cikhyāpayiṣayā prayukta*\) The second criterion entails two requisites, as explicit in NBh on 2.1.68: 2. He must not have any other reason to speak, i.e., he must be honest in reporting the truth of what he has seen \( *yathābhūtārthacikhyāpayiṣā*\)

3. He must desire to speak, i.e., he must be moved by compassion towards the living beings \(who do not know what he knows\) \( *bhūtadāyā*\)

Accordingly, the reliable speaker knows the topic and desires to communicate what he knows. 

He is epistemically and morally competent. This reliable speaker of sacred texts can, according to Jayanta, only be God. 

Consequently, Mīmāṃsā authors need to demonstrate that dharma is really unattainable by other instruments of knowledge, whereas Nyāya ones need to show that the author of 11Kumārila’s interpretation is that a sort of deduction \(namely, cogent evidence\) can prove that the recollected tradition is based on the Veda \( *yas tu kartṛsāmānyāt svatantram eva prāmāṇyaṃ vedamūlatvaṃ vānumānena sādhayati*

*\[…\] tasmād arthāpattir evātrāvyabhicārād upacārāt paścān mānād anumānatvenoktā*, TV ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 165, l.14\). 

[^12]: By contrast, Prabhākara’s *Bṛhatī * is most probably the source of other passages of the NM, see Watson 2010, p. 306, fn. 27.

the Veda is indeed reliable. Bhāṭṭa authors say that the dharma cannot be known through other instruments of knowledge because it is future and sense-perception only grasps present items \(see ŚV codanā 115, translated in Kataoka 2011b\). The Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā solution is probably briefly discussed at the beginning of the passage here translated \(section 2.1.1.2\), where Jayanta says that the dharma is *trikālānavacchinna *‘not delimited by the three times’.13

This means that the dharma does not belong to the usual temporality, which is the characteristic of common experience. It rather belongs to a different dimension, that of what has to be done, which cannot be apprehended by sense-perception, which only grasps what is present, or grasped what was present and is now past, or will grasp what will be present. The NMGBh also relates dharma with the character of being beyond the three times: For in cases such as “One should sacrifice” the prescription conveys the fact that the action \( *bhāvanā*\) must be done, and through this nature of being to be done the action itself is dharma and this is its nature which is “not touched by the three times”.14

Bhattacharyya explains the SĀP’s passage about the three times as follows: “they \[the authors of the Dharmaśāstras\] cannot perceive dharma which is transcendental, being itself potential, but not actual” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 544\). And, some pages later: “Dharma cannot be perceived since it has only a potential being but is not an event in time. \[…\] This view has been refuted. As God perceives the Agnihotra sacrifice and such other sacrifices as virtuous acts so the sages like Manu and others will be able to apprehend directly rites like Aṣṭakās etc., as virtuous acts. It is superfluous to know whether or not virtue has an actual being or a potential being” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, pp. 547–8\). 

Nyāya authors of an earlier time \(namely Gautama, Vātsyāyana and Uddyotakara\) have attempted to prove the reliability of the Veda author out of partial tests, through which the general reliability of an author can be inferred. But how to test the Veda, which deals with imperceptible things, such as dharma? Gautama, Vātsyāyana and Uddyotakara inferred the validity of the Veda out of the fact that the same ṛṣis \(said to be their *draṣṭṛ * and *pravaktṛ *‘seers and transmitters’ in NBh ad 2.1.68\) uttered the Veda and Vedic texts whose validity one can check through other instruments of knowledge, such as mantras against snakes’ poison, and the Āyurveda. The inference is, nonetheless, open to objections, since it could be claimed that the fact that an author X is reliable in regard to Y does not prove that he is reliable in regard to anything else. In order to strengthen the claim, Naiyāyikas tend to equate reliability with omniscience, so that the test through the Āyurveda does not amount just to a test of the reliability of its utterer\(s\), but also of his \(their\) extraordinary knowledge. One\(s\) who can know about medicine, can know about everything else, seems to be the implicit claim, and is hence reliable in all other fields of knowledge as well, including dharma. But even after such changes, the argument continued to be attacked by Mīmāṃsakas.15

Jayanta claims that the Āyurveda is well-known as the work of certain human authors \(such as Caraka, see NM 4, NM, p. 607, ll.19-20\), whereas the Veda has been authored by God himself. Accordingly, for Jayanta the Āyurveda is not the *probans * for the reliability of the author of the Veda, but rather only an example which establishes the invariable concomitance 13The definition of dharma as being different from what belongs to the three times is mentioned also in NM 2

\(NM, p. 271\), and it is well-known in Prābhākara literature \(see, for instance, TR IV section 9.10.1, Freschi 2012\). 

The reference to the three times then became popular also among Bhāṭṭas \(see for instance Appayya Dīkṣita 1890, p. 1\), although it contradicts a statement by Kumārila, namely that the dharma is future \(bhaviṣyat\), cf. ŚV codanā

115. 

14 *yajetetyādau hi vidhir bhāvanāyāḥ kāryatvam avagamayati, tena ca kāryātmanā rūpeṇa saiva bhāvanā dharmaḥ,* *tac cāsyāḥ kālatrayāsaṃspṛṣṭaṃ rūpam *\(Shah 1972, p. 57\). 

[^15]: For a history of the Mīmāṃsā vs. Nyāya debate on the validity of the Veda, see Freschi and Graheli 2005, where the Āyurveda-Veda argument is discussed and analysed at length. For the Mīmāṃsā criticism of this argument see Kataoka 2011b, pp. 343-345.

Table 3: Naiyāyika ways to establish that the author is reliable between reliable speakers and validity of the text uttered by them. He can interpret in this way Gautama’s and Vātsyāyana’s statements on the Āyurveda, also thanks to the vagueness of the *sūtra * and of Vātsyāyana’s initial comments on it, which allows for such an understanding \(this first, vaguer interpretation of NBh ad 2.1.68 is discussed in the first paragraph of Freschi and Graheli 2005, p. 304\). Moreover, instead of focusing on the validity of the Āyurveda, Jayanta makes room for the argument of the consensus of the great people \( *mahājanaparigraha*\): the Veda must be reliable, since exemplary people agree on its validity.16

On this argument George Chemparathy \(Chemparathy 1983\) notes the ambiguity of *mahā*-

in the compound: is the argument based on the consensus of many people or of great people? 

Kataoka \(Kataoka 2011b, p. 305\) quotes an early instance of the usage of *mahājana *\(without *parigraha*\) in the *Mahābhārata * and suggests that it only meant a “great mass of people without a connotation of greatness in quality”. This is supported by Kumārila’s contrastive usage of *kaiścid eva parigraha *‘agreement of a few only’ in ŚV codanā 133d. 

As for Jayanta, he tends to favour the qualitative option, as is made clear in section 6, but he also mentions the great number of people, see sections 5.2.2.3, 6.2.1.2 and 6.3. Section II.4.6.1

discusses the possibility that the criterion was in fact split into two already in Kumārila’s understanding of it, and consequently also in Jayanta’s one. 

Table 2 summarises the criteria for establishing the validity of the Veda current among Mīmāṃsakas and Naiyāyikas. Being free of doubt, etc. is a requirement for every kind of cognition, see section II.4.2.1. Table 3 summarises the way Naiyāyika authors establish that an author is reliable. 

### 1.2.4.2 Validity of sacred texts other than the Veda

Indian authors are generally aware that being transmitted traditionally is not enough for being a reliable text \(for Kumārila’s denial of unbroken transmission as a criterion of reliability see section II.4.6.1\). The standard example of an unreliable transmission is the *jātyandhaparam-parā *‘transmission \[of notions about colour\] by people born blind’, discussed already in ŚBh 16See Chemparathy 1983 for a detailed analysis of the history of Nyāya-arguments for the validity of the Veda. 

Chemparathy states that the argument of the consensus of great people has been introduced in the Nyāya system as a criterion for the validity of the Veda by either Jayanta or Vācaspati Miśra. Like with the argument of the always inferable Veda \(see section II.4.2\) the fact that the argument is already mentioned by Kumārila —together with other Naiyāyika criteria— means that it must have existed in some form long before Jayanta \(see ŚV codanā v. 98b, TV

ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 164, Harikai 2008, pp. 27-28; see also Kataoka 2011b, p. 305\). 

10

ad 1.3.1 \(see also SĀP, section 2.1.1.2\). The example hints at the case of an unbroken transmission of notions about colour handed down from one blind person to the next. Although the transmission is unbroken, it remains unreliable. Consequently, even transmitted texts need to have their validity established, either through a Mīmāṃsā or through a Nyāya approach. 

According to Mīmāṃsā authors, texts different than the Veda are reliable insofar as they are based on the Veda. But how can one demonstrate it? The demonstration as it is described in the SĀP \(section 2.1.1.2\), is based on the application of cogent evidence \( *arthāpatti*\): The Dharmaśāstras have no other root than the Veda, hence they are based on the Veda. The background of this argument is JS 1.3.4 *hetudarśanāc ca* 17, which denies the validity of texts for which a different reason, such as greed or delusion, can be detected. 

Thus, other texts are valid insofar as they are based on the Veda. This Veda-root may be, following Kumārila \(TV ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, pp. 164, 187 et passim\), either a branch of the Veda which is currently lost, or a compendium of Vedic elements which today’s readers cannot recognise because they are scattered in various Vedic texts. Alternatively, the Vedic root might be the “always inferred” \( *nityānumeya*\) Veda, i.e., a Vedic text which has always been inferable, and has never existed as a directly perceivable text. This claim is based on the idea that there have always been, without beginning, two sorts of Veda, one which is intrinsically available to direct perception \(i.e., which can be heard\) and one which is intrinsically only inferable. The theory is not fully developed in the extant portions of Prabhākara’s *Bṛhatī*.18 Śālikanātha explains in his commentary: To begin with, a \[Vedic\] word, though inferred, does communicate \[what has to be done\]. \[…\] It is not the case that an inferred \[word\] is not Veda, for the Veda is a collection of words independent of a human \[author\] \[and thus the fact of existing in an uttered form is not essential for its definition\]. Nor is it impossible that this inferred \[text\] is a \[Vedic\] word, because it has not been grasped by one’s hearing organ in the past. For, just like a written text is fit \[for being heard\], so

\[the inferred Vedic word\] \[can be\] grasped by a hearing organ, since it is also made of the various phonemes, *ka * and so on. \[…\] A text is not perceived because it is non-manifest, nonetheless the inference of it is not contradictory. 19

And, in his independent treatise, the *Prakaraṇapañcikā*: The teaching \( *śāstra*\) is that through which one teaches, i.e., the \[Vedic\] word. 

This \(Vedic word\) is of two kinds: perceivable and inferable. \[Obj.\] What is the *probans * to infer a \[Vedic\] word? \[R.:\] A statement of the recollected tradition

\[such as\] “One must perform the Aṣṭakā ceremony”. \[Obj.\] How \[can this be a *probans*\]? \[R.:\] To begin with, this recollected tradition is accepted by people belonging to the three \[upper\] classes without disagreement \( *vigāna*\). And an agreement would not be possible in the case of something with no base. And 17“\[Other texts are not valid\] also in case one sees a reason \[which could have lead someone to make them up, such as personal interest”. For further details, see section II.4.2.1. 

[^18]: The text of the *Bṛhatī * is rather obscure: “As for what has to be done, to begin with, the recollected tradition is able \[to convey it\]. \[If\] you now say that the recollected tradition is not a cause \[able to convey what has to be done\], 

\[then\] the fact that it is not a cause \[must\] be ascertained. Nor is it possible to ascertain that the recollected tradition is not a cause for that \(i.e, teaching of what has to be done\), because it is in contact \( *saṃyoga*\) with the Veda and there is no other cause in regard to this duty” \( *kāryatas tāvat smaraṇe śaktir asti. smaraṇam idānīm akāraṇam ity* *akāraṇatā smaraṇe ’dhyavasīyate. na ca tadakāraṇatvaṃ smaraṇe ’dhyavasātuṃ śakyate saṃbhavād vedasaṃyogasya,* *kāraṇāntarasya cāsaṃbhavāt asmin kārye *\( *Bṛhatī * ad 1.3.2, Subrahmanya Sastri 1962, p. 78\). 

[^19]: anumito *’pi tāvac chabdo bodhaka eva \[…\] na cānumeyatvād avedatvam, vedo hi nāma apauruṣeyaḥ śab-dasaṅghātaḥ. na cānumīyamānasya tadānīm aśrotragrahaṇatayā śabdatvam evānupapannam. lipyavagatasyeva yo-gyatayā hi śrotragrahaṇatā tasya vidyate tasyāpi kakārādivarṇamayatvāt. \[…\] * anabhivyaktatayā *grantho nopalab-hyate tathāpi tasyānumānam aviruddham*. \( *Ṛjuvimalā * ad *Bṛhatī * 1.3.2, Subrahmanya Sastri 1962, pp. 79–80\). Note the \(emphasised\) similarities with Jayanta’s exposition. In the same passage, Śālikanātha also quotes *Mānavadharmaśāstra *\(henceforth MDhŚā\) 2.7, like Jayanta in SĀP, section 6.2.2.2\). 

11

the base cannot be perception, since this does not have what has to be done as its content. Since in the case of the recollected tradition one learns a non-precedented thing to be done, \[only\] the \[Vedic\] teaching can be the base. \[Obj.:\] But even this base is not fit, because it is not grasped, even if one looks carefully. And a

\[Vedic\] word which is not perceived does not convey a meaning. \[…\] \[R.:\] It is true, also people like Manu, like us, do not grasp the teaching \[which is the base of the MDhŚā, etc.\] in a directly perceivable form. But the inference is possible also for them, like for us. For, having seen another recollected tradition, accepted by the exemplary people, they can also infer a \[Vedic\] teaching as its base. This, \[in turn\] had been inferred out of another recollected tradition by their authors…In this way, there is no obstacle to the inference because it is possible that a succession of recollected traditions is the *probans*, since \[this succession\]

has no beginning.20

The following statement provides a late summary of the theory as it became current: “It is established that the Teaching \( *śāstra*\) is only the Vedic sentence. And that \(Teaching\) is twofold, directly perceivable and inferable. Out of those, the former is the heap of the Vedas, which is composed of the \[Saṃhitās\] one has to recite \( *svādhyāya*\) \[…\]. The second, on the other hand, is the always inferable \( *nityānumeya*\) \[Veda\]. In that case, the inferential mark \[for its existence\] are recollected tradition \( *smṛti*\) and practices \[of the good people\] \( *ācāra*\)”.21

The view is generally supported by Prābhākara authors, but it is already mentioned by Kumārila in his TV \(TV ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 164, ll.7-8\). Further passages by Kumārila might be read as polemical replies to this theory, for instance the following one, stressing the fact that the Veda is manifest \(vs. the idea of a non-manifest, always inferable Veda, see also SĀP, section 2.1.2.2\) “For the Vedic sentences which are scattered in other Vedic branches are perceived by some people \[…\] \[and\] they, which though not seen

\[by us\] are manifest, are assembled and recollected” \( *śākhāntaraviprakīrṇāni hi puruṣāntara-pratyakṣāṇy eva vedavākyāni \[…\] parokṣāṇy api * vyajyamānāni *piṇḍīkṛtya smaryante*, TV ad 1.3.3, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 186, my emphasis\). Therefore, given that Prabhākara was most probably a younger contemporary of Kumārila, and that it is thus hardly the case that Kumārila referred to him already in his TV \(see Yoshimizu 1997, p. 49\), the *nityānumeya*-

tenet must have already been formulated by Mīmāṃsakas which later came to be identified as Prābhākaras. 

In harmony with the Mīmāṃsā focus on what is currently the case,22 Prābhākaras do not postulate that the always inferable Veda was previously perceptible and has then at a certain point been lost. Rather, an always inferable Veda must exist, since the existing recollected traditions, such as the MDhŚā, must have a Vedic base, and this must be a previous recollected tradition, which inspired Manu. This previous recollected tradition, in turn, must have had a Vedic base, and so on for ever, since the world has no beginning \(according to the general 20śāstram —śiṣyate ’neneti tu śabdaḥ. sa ca *dvividhaḥ —pratyakṣo ’numeyaś * ca. kiṃ punaś śabdānumāne liṅgam.

[^22]: The *Tattvasaṅgraha * quotes, probably from Kumārila’s *Bṛhaṭṭīkā*, the following statement: “\[…\] The whole world has never been different from how it is now” \( *jagat sarvaṃ na kadācid anīdṛśam*, Śāstrī 1981, 1982 vv. 2274, 3113\). 

Jayanta reproduces it, with minor variations several times, as a sort of Mīmāṃsā-motto \(see Dezső 2005, p. 244, l.7-8; NM 3, Kataoka 2005, p. 337; NM 8, NM, p. 424, ll.3-4, vol. II\).

**Mīmāṃsaka criteria**

being based on the Veda and on no other source

being performed by the same people who perform Vedic rituals

being free of doubt and defects in the causes, 

and not being subsequently invalidated

**Naiyāyika criteria**

having a reliable author

having a partial agreement with actual state of affairs

being accepted by the exemplary people

Table 4: Principal criteria for texts other than the Veda

Mīmāṃsā principle of “sticking at what is currently the case”, without imagining different state of affairs which cannot be demonstrated\). By contrast, there is nothing which leads one to postulate that this Veda has ever existed in a directly perceptible form and has then been lost. This view is described in section 2.1.2. By contrast, in section 2.1.1.2.1 a different view is hinted at, insofar as it is said that a Vedic injunction functioning as base for the prescriptions of the recollected tradition is inferred out of the observable mantras and *arthavāda* s. This is probably Śabara’s opinion, or an evolution of it \(cf. “And in the Veda some mantras are found, which are the inferential marks for inferring the Aṣṭakā \[ritual\]”, *aṣṭakādiliṅgāś ca* *mantrā vede dṛśyante*, ŚBh ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 165, ll.9-10\). Prābhākaras rather consider the two Vedas as being on the same level and say that the always inferable one is inferred out of the proper conduct of good people or out of the Dharmaśāstras. 

According to Nyāya authors the texts different than the Veda may be valid if their author is reliable. Jayanta discusses two kinds of candidates: first a reliable human being and then God himself. Since directly testing the author’s reliability is impossible, one needs to establish it through indirect evidences, like in the case of the Veda \(see section II.4.1\), i.e., partial agreements with actual states of affairs, and the consensus of exemplary people. In the first case, the reliability of the author can be tested through the accord of what he says, with state of affairs one can verify. Since sacred texts by definition regard dharma, which cannot be known by normal people, one can only test the reliability of their author through partial agreements with verifiable items \( *ekadeśasaṃvāda*, see section 5.1.1\). The idea is that if I can prove that X is reliable while saying Y —a topic which I can know through another instrument of knowledge, thus testing X’s words—, I can infer out of this instance his general reliability. As typical instances of topic which can be tested count remedies against snakes’ poison, medicine in general and magic \(see TV ad 1.3.4, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 194, l.11 for a complete list of the cases of concordance with actual states of affairs\). The principal criterion for Jayanta, however, is the consensus of the exemplary people. 

#### 1.2.4.2.1 Historical evolution of the criteria
As for the hierarchy of these arguments \(see table 4\), Jaimini explicitly upholds the fact of having common performers \( *kartṛsāmānya*\) in JS 1.3.2. Within the JS, it is clear out of JS 1.3.1 that dharma is only known through the Veda. The argument about the common performers found in JS 1.3.2 aims at showing that also the recollected tradition can count as an instrument for knowing dharma, insofar as the same people follow the injunctions of Vedic and Smārta texts. 

Kumārila makes explicit the inference of the validity of the recollected tradition out of the fact that it is based on the Veda, and proposes it as a favoured alternative to the criterion of having common performers , which consequently remains relegated in a subordinate role 13

The Dharmaśāstras of Manu, etc., teach about dharma they could either be

*↙*

*↘*

valid

invalid:

if so

*↓*

they would be based on personal interest, etc. 

*↓*

but no personal interest, etc. is seen in their case

*⇓*

hence they are valid

Table 5: Cogent evidence to prove the validity of Manu’s text, etc. 

valid cognition \( *pramāṇa*\)

invalid cognition \( *apramāṇa*\)

lack of knowledge \( *ajñāna*\(= *jñānānutpatti*\)\)

invalidating cognition \( *arthānyathātvajñāna*\)

defects of the cause \( *kāraṇadoṣajñāna*\)

Table 6: Mīmāṃsā sources of invalidity

also in the SĀP.23 But how can one establish that a text is based on the Veda? Kumārila elaborates on Śabara’s mention \(in ŚBh ad 1.3.2\) of cogent evidence \( *arthāpatti*\) and first excludes the existence of other causes \(such as personal interest or delusion\), mentioned in JS

1.3.4 *hetudarśanāc ca *“An in case one can see a reason \[a text is invalid\]”, and then concludes that the most economical solution is to assume that their teachings are based on the Veda, see table 5. 

The last three criteria regard all sorts of cognitions \(see the Mīmāṃsā definition of instrument of knowledge as discussed in Kataoka 2003b\). Kumārila lists the cases of invalidity as lack of knowledge \( *ajñāna*\), doubt \( *saṃśaya*\) and error \( *mithyāpratyaya * or *bhrānti*\), which in turn can depend on defects of the cause originating the cognition \( *kāraṇadoṣa*\) or be revealed by a subsequent invalidating cognition \( *bādhaka*\) \(see table 6, adapted from Kataoka 2011b, p. 119\). 

This set of invalidating cognitions is referred to by Jayanta in at least two other cases \(NM

3, v. 208, NM, p. 526, mentioning the 3 together; and NM 9, NM, p. 484, where *kāraṇa *‘\[faulty\]

origin’ and *bādha * are analysed and dismissed as causes of invalidity\). Therefore, it seems plausible to say that Jayanta adopted for himself these three criteria, which he borrowed from his Mīmāṃsā sources, as shown also by their presence in the thesis stated in section 6, where Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya elements coexist \(see below, section II.4.6\). 

Among Naiyāyikas, the criterion of the reliability of the author is the principal one. The other two are only meant to make one infer the reliability of the author in case one cannot directly test him. Earlier Naiyāyikas tend to favour partial tests, out of which the general reliability of an author can be inferred, but Jayanta refutes this inductive argument and favours 23 *kartṛsāmānyāt svatantram eva prāmāṇyaṃ vedamūlatvaṃ vānumānena sādhayati*, TV ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 165.

Table 7: Jayanta’s criteria for establishing that an author is reliable Nyāya: agreement of the exemplary people

*→ * validity of the text

Table 8: Refuted criteria for establishing that a text is valid instead the one based on the consensus of exemplary people \(see section II.4.1\), plus the additional element of the demonstration of God, which already included the fact that he was the only candidate as author of the Veda \(the demonstration of God is discussed in NM 3, see Kataoka 2005, particularly p. 352, fn. 4, where the connection of the two topics is made clear\). 

It is however important to note that the author’s reliability remains the determining criterion \(see table 7\). Jayanta refutes the idea that the agreement of the exemplary people could by itself work as a criterion in section 5.2.2.4. Similarly, the Mīmāṃsā thinkers whose views are reproduced in the SĀP refute the idea that the commonness of performers in itself leads to the validity of a text, as suggested in section 2.1.1.1, see table 8. By contrast, *kartṛsāmānya* can be used as a criterion to prove the *invalidity * of other texts, see section 2.1.3. Hence, it is a negative precondition, rather than the *probans * of an inference. And it will eventually be excluded by Jayanta even as precondition, in sections 6.2.2.1–6.2.2.2. 

#### 1.2.4.2.2 The term smṛti ‘recollected tradition’ 
Traditionally, the Veda is said to be *śruti*

‘directly heard \[text\]’, whereas Dharmaśāstras and other similar texts are said to be *smṛti* literally ‘recollection’, in the sense of ‘recollected tradition’. How can one justify this terminology? Jayanta in section 2.1.1.3 justifies it on the background of the link between experience \( *anubhava*\) and memory \(also called *smṛti*\). Just like memory depends on experience, so the

‘recollected tradition’ depends on its basis, the Veda:

experience *→ smṛti*

Veda *→ smṛti*

### 1.2.4.3 Conflict between *śruti* and *smṛti*

Once one has established that both Veda and recollected traditions are valid, what happens if they contradict each other? Jayanta states that contradictions are indeed hardly found, and then suggests various solutions for them:

1. The Veda overcomes the recollected tradition

2. One can opt for the one or the other

3. There is no real contradiction, since the seeming contradictory prescriptions in fact apply to different types or groups of people

15

The first solution seems to be the one favoured by Śabara, who tends to exclude the possibility of choosing between Veda and recollected tradition \(as will be shown later in this section\). 

The second solution \(in sections 2.2.2, 5, 5.1.1 and section 6.1.3.1\) is that one can choose between the two contradictory statements. This optional choice between two elements is called *vikalpa*, which is a technical term in Mīmāṃsā. The standard example of *vikalpa * is the choice between rice and barley as ritual substances in the Full- and New–Moon Sacrifices. Since both are enjoined as ritual substances, one can choose whether to use the one or the other. It is interesting to note that option is only admissible if:

• The items among which one chooses serve the same purpose \(e.g., rice and barley both serve the purpose of baking a cake\), 

• Their result can be achieved by only one of them alone \(barley alone or rice alone is enough to bake a cake\). 

Thus, admitting that one can choose between a certain Vedic prescription and a Dharmaśāstric prescription conflicting with it is tantamount to admit that the same purpose can be achieved by either the one or the other. The *vikalpa * solution is not universally agreed upon, probably because Mīmāṃsakas are extremely cautious in admitting it. This caution is due to the fact that, according to Mīmāṃsakas, option in itself involves eight faults \(since, while choosing among alternatives, one rejects what is prescribed by a previous statement and accepts what one had previously abandoned\). 

In Garge’s words:

As a rule, Vikalpa, is not permissible except under strict necessity, because its acceptance gives rise to eight undesirable contingencies. To quote the typical instance of Vikalpa, from later Mīmāṃsakas: Yava \[barley\] and Vrīhi \[rice\] are prescribed as optional alternatives so far as the corn to be used for the offering is concerned. Accepting this option, \(i\) if we use Vrīhi and not use Yava, we reject the authority of the Vedic text enjoining the use of Yava, \(ii\) we assume the untrustworthy character of this text, \(iii\) if on the other hand, we use Yava, and not use Vrīhi, we reject the authority of the text prescribing Vrīhi, \(iv\) and assume the untrustworthy character of this text, \(v\) in the latter case –use of Yava– again, we accept the authority of the Yava text which we had rejected before, \(vi\) and thereby reject the previously assumed untrustworthiness of the Yava text, \(vii\) in using the Vrīhi again, we accept the authority of the Vrīhi text which we had rejected before, \(viii\) and we also reject the previously assumed untrustworthiness of that text \(Garge 1952, pp. 287-288\).24

From a historical point of view, Śabara accepted option between Vedic prescriptions, but refuted option between prescriptions enjoined by the Veda and prescriptions of the recollected traditions:

Nor is it the case that a content understood through a \[Vedic\] prescription is \[later\]

refused. Therefore, the option between rice and barley and between the Bṛhad and the Rathantara \[tunes\] is appropriate. 

For this reason, it has been said that a recollected tradition which contradicts the Veda is not an instrument of knowledge. Therefore \[ritual practices\] such as that of covering \[with a cloth\] the whole post must not be observed.25

[^24]: On the topic of option, see also Kataoka 2011b, p. 282 and Kataoka 2004b, p. 141. 

25 *na ca vākyenāvagato ’rtho ’pahnūyate. tasmād vrīhiyavayor upapanno vikalpo bṛhadrathantarayoś ca. tasmād* *uktaṃ śrutiviruddhā smṛtir apramāṇam iti. ataś ca sarvaveṣṭanādi nādaraṇīyam *\(ŚBh ad 1.3.3\). On the Bṛhat and Rathantara tunes see also SĀP, section 2.2.2. 

16

In other words, in case of conflict, the Veda overcomes the recollected tradition. By contrast, Kumārila accepts option also in the latter case, but only after a long discussion \(see fn. 

49\): “In fact, option is correct since the instrument of knowledge \[upon which two seemingly contradictory statements are based\] is of an equal rank” \( *vikalpa eva hi nyāyyas tulyakakṣyapramāṇataḥ*, TV ad 1.3.4, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 188, l.14\). 

The third solution consists in claiming that there is no direct conflict, because different prescriptions regard different kind of people. If one is a brahman, for instance, he will probably have to follow rather the Vedic injunctions, whereas other injunctions found in the recollected tradition might have been tailored for members of other classes. Consequently, there is option between Veda and recollected tradition, but the choice is not left to one’s whims and is instead regulated. In Kumārila’s terminology, this is a *vyavasthitavikalpa *‘ordered option’

\(TV ad 1.3.4, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 192\).26 This solution is probably favoured by Jayanta himself, who repeatedly proposes it also in later sections \(especially in 6.1.2.2, which deals with the problem of extreme religious practices, see also section II.4.5\). 

### 1.2.4.4 Validity of texts which are far away from the Veda or overtly contradict it
One is lead to think that Jayanta favours the view that God is the author of all sacred texts, due to the fact that it is presented after the view that they have a reliable human author in the present text, and due to the arguments in favour of the validity of the Veda and aiming at proving the existence of God elaborated in the rest of the NM. 

However, given that God is the author of all sacred texts, how can they contradict each other? In order to solve this problem, Jayanta first states that the contradictions are minor, since all texts agree as for what has to be achieved \(liberation\), the means to achieve it \(a salvific knowledge\) and the content of such knowledge \(the self, *ātman*\) —and this notwithstanding what they claim about themselves. 

Next, Jayanta elaborates on the last solution to the problem of the contradictions between Veda and recollected tradition mentioned above. Accordingly, the various sacred texts do not contradict each other, they just differ insofar as people are different and hence need different paths. To sum up, 

**How can the differences between the Veda**

**and the other sacred texts be explained? **

1. The differences do not really count, since all texts agree about what has to be achieved and the means to achieve it. 

2. The differences regard only the procedures, because different people need different paths. 

Table 9: Explanation of the differences among sacred texts

The next step regards the way Jayanta deals with religious practices which seem to oppose the general sense of what is right. This emotional answer to some religious practices, argues Jayanta, is not a valid reason to proclaim their invalidity \(see table 10\). Philosophically speaking, this is a very interesting issue. The role of emotions as guides for moral behaviour 26As examples of the usage of *vyavasthitavikalpa * in order to solve contradictions within the Veda, see the commentaries on MS 12.4.5 and 12.4.7, e.g. the *Mīmāṃsānyāyasaṅgraha * thereon \(Mahādeva Vedāntin 2010\). 

17

**objections**

**replies**

They contradict the Veda

contradictions are inessential

They contradict each other

They teach outrageous practices

this is not an invalidating criterion

Table 10: Principal attempts to invalidate the texts other than the Veda is, in fact, a disputed issues among philosophers and ethical theorists.27 Jayanta’s solution, as unfolded in sections 6.1.2 and 6.3 is that only extreme emotions, such as dread, may be used as guide. The hesitation, suspicion or light disgust one might feel when confronted with a religious practice one is not used to is only due to one’s being accustomed to a different view \(section 6.1.2\), and hence does not count as a separate piece of evidence. By contrast, what people overtly abhor cannot be considered a valid text \(on this differences, see also above, section II.2\). 

From a historical point of view, the usage of one’s inner hesitation \( *hṛdayakrośana*\) as a criterion for judging about the invalidity of a religious practice is a typically Buddhist move \(already in the Pāli Canon many passages condemn the Vedic sacrifices, which imply the slaughter of animals, as bloody and immoral\). Later, Kumārila reinterpreted this criterion \(see ŚV codanā 244cd-248ab and TV ad 1.3.7, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 207, ll.1-2\) but with the important restriction that only the inner hesitation of cultivated people \( *śiṣṭa*\) can be a criterion, insofar as their emotions are in harmony with what the Veda teaches: This “inner consent” \[ *ātmatuṣṭi*\] or its negative counterpart, the “outcry of the heart” \( *hṛdayakrośana*\), the warning and censuring voice of conscience, is *de facto* and *de jure * based upon the Veda. \[…\] The *mleccha*, by the way, who has never had any access to the Veda or the Vedic tradition, is not credited with any “voice of conscience” or inner “affliction” at all \(Halbfass 1992, p. 96\). 

Halbfass refers to ŚV codanā 247: “A barbarian ignorant of \[Vedic\] teachings does not fear \( *udvij*-\) \[to do\] any of these kinds \[of actions\]” \( *aśāstrajño mleccho nodvijate kvacit*, text and translation from Kataoka 2011b\). Pārthasārathi’s comment directly highlights the connection between *udvega * and *hṛdayakrośana*.28

### 1.2.4.5 The problem of violent practices

Connected with the above discussion on emotions is the one on whether violent practices can be accepted \(section 6.1.3.1\). 

Jayanta can rely on the Mīmāṃsā distinction of violence into violence performed for the sake of the ritual and for the sake of the person \(the former only is accepted\), and concludes with Kumārila \(see fn. 108\) that ritual violence is not in itself a motivation for excluding a religious practice. Within Mīmāṃsā, the discussion originated because of the Vedic injunctions regarding the Śyena sacrifice, in which black magic is used in order to harm one’s enemy. 

Mīmāṃsā authors agree that the Śyena sacrifice has not to be performed \(although their ways to reach this result highly diverge\). But why must it not be performed, given that another violent act, the slaughter of animal offerings to Agni and Soma \(the Agnīṣomīya rite\) must, instead, be performed? The Mīmāṃsā solution relies on the distinction of three elements of 27See the very well-known and much disputed paper by Leon Kass *The Wisdom of Repugnance*. Kass is a bioethi-cist at the university of Chicago, Illinois, and chaired President Bush’s Council on Bioethics from 2002 to 2005. 

In an article appeared on *Nature * in 2007, Dan Jones questions Kass’ approach by asking whether disgust “plays a constructive, or viscerally reactionary role” \(Jones 2007\). 

[^28]: Many insightful remarks on this topic can be found also in Kataoka 2011b, pp. 494-6.

the sacrifice, i.e., result \( *phala*\), instrument \( *karaṇa*, the sacrificial act\) and procedure \( *itikar-tavyatā*, the sequence of acts in which the sacrifice consists\). The Agnīṣomīya violence is for the sake of the ritual \( *kratvartha*\) and it is part of the procedure, and is, hence, unavoidable. 

By contrast, argues Kumārila, the Śyena is not in itself violent. In the Śyena the result alone is violent and, consequently, the violence regards the performer \( *puruṣārtha*\) and his desire to produce a violent result, and not the sacrifice itself. In fact, the Veda does not prescribe desires, which are given by one’s natural inclination, and hence it cannot be held responsible for the violence of the Śyena. 

Prior to Kumārila, Śabara \(see ŚBh ad 1.1.2, Frauwallner 1968, p. 20\) had stated that the Śyena-sacrificial act \(i.e., the instrument\) was itself violent, but had argued that the Veda does not *generally * prescribe to perform the Śyena. The prescription only regards a specific person \(its *adhikārin*\), i.e., ‘the one who desires to harm his enemy’. Jayanta seems to follow this interpretation, since he distinguishes the Śyena and the Agnīṣomīya according to the fact that in the former violence regards the instrument, whereas in the latter it regards the procedure. 

Since violence is prohibited by another Vedic passage \( *na hiṃsyāt sarvā bhūtāni*\), the status of being ‘one who desires to harm his or her enemy’ is itself forbidden. Consequently, the fact that one is in the condition of being entitled to perform the Śyena is already the result of having transgressed a previous prescription \(see SĀP, section 6.1.3.1\). One who desires to harm his enemy experiences, in sum, something which seems a moral dilemma: he could either choose to perform the Śyena and violate a Vedic prohibition; or choose not to perform it, thus disregarding a Vedic prescription which explicitly regards him. However, this condition is only possible as the consequence of the former transgression of another forbidden act. In other words, the former is not a genuine moral dilemma \(which should regard the fact that an innocent one is caught between two forbidden alternatives, like the hermit Kauśika\).29

#### 1.2.4.5.1 The origin of prohibitions 
Given that violence is not enough to condemn a religious practice, one would expect at least forbidden practices to be declared invalid \(as with Kumārila, see fn. 108\). Instead, Jayanta proposes a thought-provoking argument against the claim that forbidden \( *niṣiddha*\) practices are enough to condemn a religious system: One cannot claim that these practices are forbidden, he explains, because they are not condemned in the texts of their practitioners \(section 6.1.3.1\). Hence, the reader is lead to think, one can only judge the moral value of a practice through the value-system in which it is embedded. 

This statement has two consequences, not explicit in Jayanta:

1. Moral can only be judged within a certain system, it has therefore no absolute value. 

2. Morality is not based on sense-perception and the other instruments of knowledge which could lead to a system of values shared by all human beings. The source of moral injunctions can only be an authority. 

But given that this authority is a sacred text, how can its author be reliable, i.e. “have perceived the things about which he speaks”, when it comes to the unperceivable realm of morality or dharma? The Nyāya answer is to postulate the existence of an extra-ordinary kind of perception, called *yogipratyakṣa *‘perception of the yogins’, through which one can grasp non-sensory things, such as dharma. In this way, this sort of non-sensory perception \(akin to the intellectual intuition which Kant reserved to God alone\) can fulfil the role which, for Mīmāṃsākas, only the Veda fulfils, i.e., being a reliable source for knowing about dharma, see table 11. However, this *yogipratyakṣa * is so extra-ordinary that no one can claim to have had a direct access to dharma through it, apart from God \(or, for earlier Naiyāyikas, the Vedic 29In the terminology of St. Thomas the Aquinas, one cannot be *perplexus sempliciter*, one can only be *perplexus* *secundum quid *\(see Freschi 2012, section 6.3\). On the Śyena see also Kataoka 2011b, pp. 516-518; on the topic of ritual killing see Kataoka 2012. On moral dilemmas, see Matilal 2002, pp. 19-35.

### 1.2.4.6 Jayanta’s “pluralism”

A further problem linked to the validity of sacred texts other than the Veda is where to set the boundary of valid texts. Mīmāṃsakas tend to be stricter than Naiyāyikas, but Jayanta shows that also the Mīmāṃsā criterion “only texts based on the Veda” can be loosened enough to embrace almost all sorts of texts. Similarly, through the Nyāya criterion “only texts having a reliable author” many texts can be regarded as valid, especially the ones which proclaim to be authored by God himself, such as the Śaiva sacred texts and the Pāñcarātra ones. 

Consequently, Jayanta first sets the boundary to the traditionally recognised “fourteen branches of knowledge”, then includes also the sacred texts which do not openly contradict the Veda. Last, he proposes another view, which, coming as the last one may be thought to be Jayanta’s own one, according to which all sacred texts are valid, provided some minimal requirements \(see section 6.3 and section II.4.6.1\). 

This gradual enlargement of the scope of what counts as an authoritative sacred text has some turning points:

1. section 1: Instead of talking of “other texts” in general, Jayanta lists them by dividing them into two sub-groups and thus suggesting that one of the two could be easily admitted as a whole,31

2. section 5: Instead of “being based on the Veda”, the minimal criterion of “not contradicting the Veda” is proposed, 

3. section 6: The criterion of being based on the Veda is loosened into that of having some Vedic antecedent, 

4. section 6.2.1.1: Instead of “having reliable authors”, God is introduced as the author of all sacred texts, 

[^30]: On *yogipratyakṣa * see in particular Franco 2009 and Torella 2008. 

[^31]: On the import of this move, see the following remark: “\[…\] he here begins by posing the question as to whether he is interested in vindicating the validity of Vedas alone or also that of the non-Vedic scriptural texts, a question he first answers by asking a counter-question as follows: ‘Which non-Vedic scriptural texts do you mean? Do you mean texts of the form of Purāṇas, Itihāsas, Dharmaśāstras or texts of the form of the sectarian writings of Śaivas, Pāśupatas, Pāñcarātras, Buddhists, Jainas etc.?’ Jayanta’s counter-question is revealing inasmuch as it implies some sort of gradation among the non-Vedic scriptural texts. \[…\] Then there was the Mīmāṃsaka who must be having misgivings about Purāṇas so much permeated by a theistic outlook he so much abhorred; but even he would as a general rule endorse an injunction laid down in a Dharmaśāstra-text \[…\].” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 13\). And, referring to a later passage, in section 3.2: “Being a Purāṇist Jayanta must have been interested in ensuring that Purāṇic theology

—in fact so markedly different from Vedic ritual— is somehow rooted in Vedas themselves. So he decides to take advantage of the Mīmāṃsaka’s insistence that Smṛti-ritual \[…\] is somehow rooted in Vedas themselves. \[…\] The point is confirmed by recalling the list of fourteen *vidyāsthāna* s which include four Vedas, Dharmaśāstras, Purāṇas on the one hand and six Vedāṅgas, Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā on the other; Jayanta emphasises that the first six *vidyāsthāna* s are of theological use in a direct fashion, the remaining eight in an indirect fashion” \(Shah 1992-97, pp. 15-16\). For a partial criticism of this view, see section II.5.

5. section 6: The contradictions among the various texts are explained to be minimal \(section 6.1.1.2\) and due to their different audiences \(section 6.2.1.2\), therefore God can guarantee them all. 

Furthermore, the introductory paragraph of the last section \(section 6\) analyses the criteria for invalidity examined above \(see table 6\) and answers to them through a combination of Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya approaches:

In table 13 one can count the fourteen recognised branches of knowledge, next the texts to which validity can be recognised without much problem insofar as they do not explicitly contradict the Veda, and last the texts which seemingly contradict the Veda and which are only recognised as valid in the concluding section of the SĀP. Some texts, by contrast, remain intrinsically invalid. The texts of the Saṃsāramocakas are not mentioned in any category in section 6, and are only referred to in section 5. However, section 5.2.2.3 makes clear that their status is lower than that of Buddhists. On the Saṃsāramocakas see also section II.4.7. 

#### 1.2.4.6.1 Criteria for the validity of sacred texts
Finally, in section 6.3 all texts are said to be valid, if they

1. reach the general opinion without objections \( *avigīta*\) 2. have been embraced by cultivated people

3. have been embraced by many cultivated people

4. do not appear totally unprecedented

5. are not based on greed, etc. 

6. people do not fear them

A similar list is found also at the end of the ĀḌ \(Dezső 2005, p. 246\): A sacred text is valid, provided it

\(a\) has a widely acknowledged tradition

\(b\) has a widely acknowledged, unbroken tradition

\(c\) the Aryas are not repulsed by associating with it

\(d\) its accepted practice is not antisocial

\(e\) its accepted practice is nor dangerous

\(f\) it has not just recently sprung into being

22

\(g\) it is not based on the ramblings of a madman \(h\) it is not based on something outlandish \( *alaukika*\) \(i\) it is not based on something like greed32

To sum up both sets, a sacred text seems to be valid if:

I it is not a fresh addition, with no precedent in the sacred texts: 4; \(b\) and \(f\) II it cannot be demonstrated to be based on a private interest, or on ignorance on the part of its author: 5; \(i\)

III it is embraced by exemplary people: 2; \(c\)

IV it is not accepted only by very few people: 3; \(a\)

V it is not abhorred by people: 6; \(d\) and \(e\)

VI its content is not overtly inconsistent: 1?; \(g\) and \(h\)

However, the correspondence between the two schemes is not completely smooth, since the first criterion in the SĀP could either be interpreted as hinting at the fact that the text under analysis is accepted because it is not overtly inconsistent, or as partially overlapping with the second one. In the latter case, the second criterion of SĀP could specify the first insofar as the first criterion \( *avigīta*\) would just denote a general agreement, whereas the second \( *parigraha*\) would denote the fact that people practically embrace the practices enjoined in the text \(see *vedapathapravṛtta * in section 5.2.2.2\). According to this interpretation, the later criterion \(“people do not fear them”\) would be a specification of the type of agreement needed, possibly included in ĀḌ and in the last section of SĀP because of their specific agenda \(about which see introductory study, section II.2\). The additional criteria mentioned only in the ĀḌ

could also be explained because of their social significance. 

Furthermore, the scheme becomes less problematic if we compare it with the criteria brought up by Kumārila, see table 14, although it ought to be kept in mind that two of the criteria mentioned by Kumārila \(no. 1 and no. 5\) are mentioned only in order to be refuted, whereas Jayanta actually implements them. The interruption of the tradition is in fact for Kumārila purely a negative criterion, insofar as the mere continuity of tradition is no guarantee, as shown by the case of the *andhaparamparā *‘recollection of blind people \[about colour\]’

\(see introductory study, section II.4.2\). Moreover, in Kumārila some criteria are used in order to show the validity of a text and others in order to establish its invalidity. The table 14

is, hence, the result of the comparison of various texts by Kumārila, rather than reflecting a systematic treatment by Kumārila, which is never found in its entirety in his works.33

Table 15 shows how the criteria mentioned in the SĀP can be understood as related to the ones mentioned by Kumārila. 

Table 16 shows how also the criteria mentioned in the ĀḌ can be understood in the same way.

Table 15: SĀP criteria as derived from Kumārila’s ones

As for the problems mentioned above, *vigāna * might refer to the quantitative aspect of the agreement, whereas *parigraha * would refer to its qualitative counterpart. The criterion labelled above as “inconsistency” \( *alaukikatva*, *pramattagītatva * in the ĀḌ\) could be part of the *lobhādi * one. In fact, the *ādi * refers also to delusion \( *vyāmoha * or *moha*, see SĀP, section 6.2.2\), *ajñāna * is mentioned as an additional reason in the SĀP, section 5.2.2. Furthermore, the ĀḌ \(v. 101ab\) seems to imply that *pramattagītatva*, *alaukikatva * and *lobhādi * are alternative on the same level as sources of invalid texts. If this analysis is right, *pramattagītatva * would refer to a mad author, whereas *alaukikatva * would refer to an author who violates common sense \(rather than to an outlandish *content*\). 

To sum up, the criteria would amount to the ones mentioned in table 17. 

It is noteworthy that, within the Prābhākara school, also Śālikanātha’s passage quoted above \(section II.4.2\) presupposes the three criteria endorsed by Kumārila: being accepted by people of the three upper classes \(=exemplary people in great number\), being accepted without disagreement \( *avigānena*\), not having another base than the Veda. 

### 1.2.4.7 Who cannot be accepted in any case?

The SĀP and the ĀḌ are among the few sources on a number of obscure religious groups. 

The Nīlāmbaras are described at the end of the second act of the ĀḌ in a way which overtly points at their being a risk for the social order. 

The Saṃsāramocakas are not much better known \(for a survey of references and a careful analysis of them, see Halbfass 1992, pp. 87–129\), but our sources agree in describing them intent in killing other creatures \(mostly insects, for obvious reasons\) in order to lib-erate them from saṃsāra and, hence, benefit them. Whereas the Nīlāmbaras were probably *prāmāṇya*

Table 17: Validity and invalidity criteria in the SĀP

a concrete danger for the Kaśmīrian society of Jayanta’s time, as proved by the ĀḌ and by the conclusive verses of the SĀP, where they are said to have been banned by the king, the Saṃsāramocakas were probably only a straw-man kind of opponent, one which everyone agrees to condemn. In other words, nothing in the SĀP leads one to infer the existence of a specific group of heretics bearing this name in Jayanta’s time and place. Rather, in the SĀP \(as in other philosophical texts, see again Halbfass’ essay mentioned above\) they cover the role of an ideal opponent, since their existence enables one to question a purely rational founda-tion of dharma. As shown in Kumārila’s dealing with them \(ŚV codanā 201ff, and especially 243\), since the Saṃsāramocakas kill other creatures for these creatures’ sake, “not harming others” or “helping others” are not sufficient criteria for recognising a valid religious belief. 

\(After all, the Saṃsāramocakas kill locusts, etc., \(and would kill human beings, if possible\) in order to save them from the bondage of saṃsāra. From a subjective point of view, they are benefitting their victims and, unless one accepts an objective standpoint —such as the Veda—

to judge about morality, there would be no reason to blame them.\) According to these premisses, Jayanta does not even care to explicitly locate the Saṃsāramocakas in the last group, along with the Lokāyatas. This omission can be explained through the fact that the exclusion of the Saṃsāramocakas from the precinct of validity was obvious to everyone, and also through the additional remark that they were not \(or no longer\) a real group about which a judgement needed to be pronounced. 

By contrast, J. Bronkhorst \(see Bronkhorst 2008, pp. 297-298\) shows that materialists were still active in Kaśmīr around Jayanta’s time. Interesting, in this connection, is Jayanta’s mention of “cultivated Cārvākas” \( *suśikṣitacārvākā*, NM I, NM, p. 94\). Such materialists might have been appealing due to their education. Consequently, they needed to be overtly condemned. 

## 1.2.5 What is Jayanta’s final view? 

The NM programmatically aims at systematising rather than adding anything new to the Nyāya system \(see Kataoka 2007a, p. 204\). Accordingly, it is often difficult to distinguish Jayanta’s final opinion among the many views reported. The same difficulty applies to the SĀP. As already hinted at, Jayanta oscillates between the Nyāya and the Mīmāṃsā view-point. As a general rule, one can suggest that the last view on an argument is the favoured one. Table 18 illustrates such oscillations and shows how in most sections the conclusive view \( *siddhānta*\) is the one which emerges out of a combined usage of Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā

arguments. For instance, section 5.1.1 notes that the Śaiva sacred texts have been authored by a reliable author \(the Naiyāyika source of the validity of a text\), because it is impossible to postulate a different root, such as greed or delusion as their basis. This argument is an application of cogent evidence which closely resembles the one applied by Kumārila to the MDhŚā \(see section 2.1.1.2 in the SĀP, and section II.4.2.1\). For a detailed analysis of another instance of combined usage, see above, section II.4.6. 

N.J. Shah argues that Jayanta’s main point in writing the SĀP is to secure to the Purāṇas a Vedic status \(see the quotations of Shah 1992-97 in fn. 76 and fn. 31\). According to Shah, the true novelty of this text is the way it guarantees to the Purāṇas a validity akin to the one 25

of the recollected tradition, and achieves it in a tricky way, since Jayanta lets this statement creep in without really discussing it \(cf. section 3.2\). Within the SĀP, Shah deduces Jayanta’s preference for the Purāṇas out of the very fact that he speaks less about them34 and out of other indirect elements, such as section 5.1.2: “He actually here submits that the same God is called Brahman, Viṣṇu or Rudra \(=Śiva\) in so far as He creates, sustains or destroys the world, a typical Purāṇist position and one in virtue of which the Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas \(=Pāñcarātras\) etc. are proved to be Purāṇic sub-sects” \(Shah 1992-97, pp. 16-7\). Śaiva and Pāñcarātra texts, explains Shah, are on a lower level. Shah is then at odds when, in section 5.1.2 Jayanta states that these texts have been authored by God:

However, in terms of his own mode of argumentation Jayanta should somehow show that these texts are composed by somebody less authoritative than Manu etc.; but curiously, on this point Jayanta rather says that both the received tradition and inference go to establish that these texts are a composition by God. \[…\] Jayanta should have explained how God could compose texts that were less authentic than those of Manu etc. \(Shah 1992-97, p. 16\). 

Furthermore, Shah considers section 6 as reporting a view Jayanta does not share: The above is how Jayanta presents before us a Purāṇist’s typical attitude towards the three group of non-Vedic scriptural texts, viz. Purāṇas-cum-Dharmaśāstras, the scriptures of Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas etc., the scriptures of Buddhists, Jainas etc. But then he reports about three rather liberal attitudes which could have been adopted by certain circles in this connection —one according to which all scriptures are authentic for some reason or other, another according to which all scriptures are authentic owing to their origination from God, a third according to which all scriptures are valid owing to their being based on Vedas \(Shah 1992-97, p. 18\). 

Notwithstanding the intrinsic interest of Shah’s view, we favour the idea that Jayanta, being a philosopher \(see Freschi forthcoming a\), pauses more on issues which are more philosophically stimulating, and that within the SĀP preliminary views are gradually superseded until the last one, which is Jayanta’s own one. In this sense, the fact that the Śaiva and Pāñcarātra texts are initially granted a lower level and then said to be authored by God is not problematic, insofar as the latter view is meant to supersede the former. 

That the final position about the validity of all sacred texts is Jayanta’s own conclusion is indirectly proved also through the fact that it is the most original part, the one where Jayanta’s voice seems to be more distinctly perceived, for instance insofar as he makes clear that the reliable author of all sacred texts is God Himself. Similarly, the claim that contradictions among sacred texts only regard secondary elements, whereas all sacred texts aim at liberation \(a claim found also in the ĀḌ, fourth act, Dezső 2005, p. 228\) seems to be a distinctive contribution of Jayanta. 

Does this final position amount to inclusivism35 or pluralism? In other words, does Jayanta embed different religious beliefs within an over-arching one or accept their ultimate diversity? 

The latter seems to be the case, since all sacred texts are said to be valid and to differ from each 34“Jayanta discreetly kept silent about the Purāṇic ritual as such because that was practised by the Purāṇist camp as a whole; but he could say about the sub-sects like Śaiva etc. that they practiced a ritual of their own” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 16\). “On his part, a Purāṇist would be much interested in defending the efficacy of the cult of Purāṇic ritual and in defending the validity of each single Purāṇic utterance, but these two tasks Jayanta has evaded even when an occasion was due. And the evasion must have been tactical. For Jayanta has been emphasising that the central aim of Nyāya philosophy is to vindicate the validity of Vedic testimony and he could not but note that to vindicate the validity of Vedic testimony and to vindicate the validity of Purāṇic testimony are two different propositions altogether” \(Shah 1992-97, pp. 20–21\). 

[^35]: On inclusivism as the standard “Hindū” approach, see Oberhammer and Hacker 1983, which includes a paper by Hacker \(who was possibly the first author to deal with the SĀP, see above, section II.1\).

Table 18: Oscillations between the Mīmāṃsā and the Nyāya approach other because of their different target-listeners. The impact of this approach on the general topic of religious coexistence has been explored in Wezler 1976. That Jayanta’s approach does not result into a relativistic position is due to its being anchored to the Veda as a fixed parameter, and especially to Kumārila’s interpretation of it.36

It is noteworthy that Jayanta’s innovative approach lies in the combination of criteria which, on their own, had already been found in previous authors. The idea that Buddhist teachings are in fact instrumental to something else \(section 6.1.1.2\), for instance, has a clear antecedent in Kumārila’s reading of Buddhist texts as aiming at a purpose different than what they declare —i.e., at making one’s attachment to worldly things loosen, rather than at proclaiming the actual non-existence of a self or of continuity through times \(TV ad 1.3.2, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 168; see section II.2\). Similarly, the idea that emotions are not a good guide for moral judgement \(see section II.4.4\) is already present in Kumārila’s refusal to ground one’s judgement on one’s instinctive emotions \(cf. section 6.1.2 of the SĀP\) —whereas the cultivated emotions of educated people might well play an auxiliary role. 

[^36]: Kumārila’s defence of tradition and of the necessity of relying on an authority is very far from the acceptance of *any * authority just insofar as it is an authority. See, for instance, his denial of the idea that an exemplary people could come from a different country: *mahājanagṛhītatvaṃ pitrādyanugamādi ca | te ’pi dvīpāntarāpekṣaṃ vadanty* *eva svadarśane || *\(TV ad 1.3.4 \(Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 194, ll.27–28\). For a detailed examination of this point, see Halbfass’ reply to Taber in Franco and Preisendanz 1997: “Kumārila does not simply represent a special kind of traditionalism; he is a fundamentalist. For him, traditionalism \(which is characterized by the acceptance of ancestral habits, commonly recognized standards, etc.\) is nothing more than conventionalism. To be sure, Kumārila did not have to face the modern specter of relativism. Yet he was familiar with numerous incompatible religious traditions and moral codes; and he faced these traditions as well as his own tradition from the outside. He did not simply advocate what he had received from and through his tradition, but he set himself the task of identifying an underlying principle for his tradition, and of defending it in an open arena of philosophical debate” \(Halbfass 1997, p. 480\).
