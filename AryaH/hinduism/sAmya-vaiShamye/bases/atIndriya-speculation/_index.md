Observation-based shAstra-s (eg. खगोलम्, भूगोलम् अधि) are excluded from this section. Topics such as deva-s, brahma, (to some extant) dharma are beyond direct observation and inference.

Some such speculation is intended to broadly teach us about how to think about particular groups of devatA-s at a gross level, without necessarily insisting on accuracy of each detail.

## Exaggeration
- Taking punishments and rewards described by shAstra-s literally can be quite risible.

इति भर्तृहरिः।  प्रत्यवायः = पापम् / अनिष्टम् / दुःखम्॥
