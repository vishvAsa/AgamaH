- Hindus have sacred books (aka shAstra-s -  Veda-s, epics including itihAsa-s, purANa-s, dharma-shAstra-s). Not one, but many. Some would call it "religion of the library" to contrast with "religions of the book". But, these holy books are not absolute; and their injunctions are **not binding regardless of context.**
