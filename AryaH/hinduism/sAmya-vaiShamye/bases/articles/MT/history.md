I do think history is important, and the failures at writing an objective history for yourself will result in others writing it & robbing you of your past.+++(5)+++ What is meant by objective: when you write for yourself you have to eschew the impulse to fall prey to contrafactual accounts just because they feel good.+++(5)+++ Now this can be difficult for a nation which has an undistinguished past; however, it is not an issue for the H to tell their own history factually as surviving ancient nation, when many of their cousins have been wiped out by the same forces that seek to eradicate them today.+++(5)+++
