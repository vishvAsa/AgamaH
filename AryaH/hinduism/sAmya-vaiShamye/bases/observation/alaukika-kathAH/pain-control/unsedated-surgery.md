ramaNamaharShi underwent unsedated surgery.

## Thembirai Andavan
The current pontiff (2021) of Andavan Ashramam is the 12th. The 7th pontiff known as Thembirai Andavan in his old age had was advise to undergo a surgical procedure to remove a growth on his chest that was the size of a fist. It was present for a long time but had recently become painful. He refused surgery because he didn't want to take anesthesia (since anything that induces sleep is tamasic by nature) but was open to the surgery without anesthesia. Eventually he had the surgery without anesthesia. When asked about how he managed to tolerate the pain, he said that he simply started thinking about the story of Rama. Due to intense Rama bhakti, he was able to be distracted away from the pain.
