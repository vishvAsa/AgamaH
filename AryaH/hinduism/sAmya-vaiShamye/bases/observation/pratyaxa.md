title: प्रत्यक्षम् Direct witness

## Scope, power
- Direct observation (extensible to experimental science) is a valuable source of knowledge in some cases (mokSha according to some), but not in others (dharma).
- It may augment the overall validity of texts in some cases (see "holy books") or refute literal or non-contextual understanding of specific portions. See [books/non-absoluteness]() page. 
  - Examples for literal understanding refutation:
    - Ancient mathematical approximations for planetary positions prove inadequate when we directly observe these positions.
- The pratyaxa of one person is always of questionable utility to another - Depends on the reliability and relatability of the experiencer vis-a-vis the other.

## Biology
Lessons from biology are very important for superior understanding of a lot of issues in human society (ranging from mate selection, family dynamics, social structure, child rearing, memetic epidemics like Abe's diseases, sexual orientation, police brutality, violence, carnivorism etc..). Indeed, in our past we see savants like viShNusharman and vyAsa teach us nIti with reference to animal behavior. One of the reasons why natural religions like ours are superior to counter religions like buddhism, Abe's diseases and their successors like SJWism and communism stems from the fact that they are better adapted to our true "nature" (which is largely grounded in biology). The mAnasatarangiNIkAra is a rare savant who sees this clearly.

- Eg. One can argue that the mUNDaka way towards brahma/ Ananda addiction of other sorts is inimical to (pravRtti) dharma.
