title: प्रत्यक्षम् Direct witness
---


प्रत्यक्ष is given high regard, even with regard to subjective experience. As is said:

> ‘‘न हि दृष्टे ऽनुपपन्नं नाम’’

- The pratyaxa of one person is always of questionable utility to another - Depends on the reliability and relatability of the experiencer vis-a-vis the other.


## Biology
Lessons from biology are very important for superior understanding of a lot of issues in human society (ranging from mate selection, family dynamics, social structure, child rearing, memetic epidemics like Abe's diseases, sexual orientation, police brutality, violence, carnivorism etc..). Indeed, in our past we see savants like viShNusharman and vyAsa teach us nIti with reference to animal behavior. One of the reasons why natural religions like ours are superior to counter religions like buddhism, Abe's diseases and their successors like SJWism and communism stems from the fact that they are better adapted to our true "nature" (which is largely grounded in biology). The mAnasatarangiNIkAra is a rare savant who sees this clearly.

- Eg. One can argue that the mUNDaka way towards brahma/ Ananda addiction of other sorts is inimical to (pravRtti) dharma.

## ग्रन्थवत्
प्रत्यक्षम् ब्रह्माण्डम् अपि ब्रह्म-रचित-ग्रन्थवद् गृह्यताम्।  
यथा ग्रन्थयोर् विवादे सत्य् एकस्य गौणता ग्राह्या,  
तथा ऽत्रापि समाधेयम् आपतति। 

अनेन केषाञ्चन ग्रन्थानुगानां  
"मद्-इष्ट-ग्रन्थे प्रत्यक्ष-विरुद्धं यद् उक्तं,  
तत् कथं समाधेयम्"  
इति विचिकित्सा परिह्रियेततराम् -  
तस्यापीश्वर-प्रणीतत्व-स्मारणेन।
