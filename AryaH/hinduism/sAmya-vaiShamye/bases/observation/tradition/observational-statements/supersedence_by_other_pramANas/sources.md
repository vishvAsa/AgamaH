Textual authority is not absolute.

## Implausibility
The AchArya-s knew some things better than we ever will - in domains like theology, sanskrit/ maNipravALa/ drAviDa composition, religious practice.  However, in some other areas, our understanding surpasses them, eg. the physical universe, biology, history, foreign cultures and religions etc.. They occupied the same physical universe as we do; the physical laws of nature were the same.

Due to this, where the latter domains are concerned, some of their suppositions (and resultant practices) were wrong (If one honestly understood their words, as they intended them, and not make them confess strange meanings by torturing their texts). They would have expected nothing less than such honesty from us.


- The validity of pratyakSha and pratyakSha-like anumAna evidence in cases where they are available. In such cases, texts are not to be taken literally.
- See the "न हि श्रुतिशतमपि" quote by shankara above.

> "अप्रत्यक्षाणि शास्त्राणि  
> विवादस्तेषु केवलम्।  
> प्रत्यक्षं ज्योतिषं शास्त्रं  
> चन्द्रार्कौ यत्र साक्षिणौ।।"

- The texts (esp. veda-s) are about matters that are not easily graspable by pratyakSha. No one can see a "puNya" particle when one does a dhArmika act. Only obliquely can one ascribe the benefits of many observances to the "Lindy effect".
    - परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः प्रत्यक्षद्विषः।। शतपथ०।। 
    - परोक्षविषया वेदाः परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः ऐ.उ.1।14बृ.उ.4।2।2


## Incompleteness
- One reason for the incompleteness is the sheer impossibility of anticipating and correctly weighing in on circumstances far outside one's (the sage's) spatio-temporal context.
- Vedic self-declaration of incompleteness is [listed elsewhere](/vedAH/meta/incompleteness/).

## Errors
- The most sacred texts can contain stray errors (even in dharma instruction). Eg. रजस्वलो **रक्तदन्** सत्यवादी स्याद् इति हि ब्राह्मणम् ११

### dharma from observation and deduction
- With regards to dharma, given its laxaNa (prosperity and victory): pratyaxa and anumAna can have decisive role in rejecting/ pruning shruti contradictions/ misinstructions. 
- मेधातिथिः "अन्त्याद् अपि परं धर्मं स्त्रीरत्नं दुष्कुलाद् अपि" इत्यत्र - **अन्त्यश्** चाण्डालस् तस्माद् अपि +++(आददीत)+++ यः **परो धर्मः** श्रुति-स्मृत्य्-अपेक्षया परो ऽन्यो लौकिकः ।


## Corruption
- Likelihood of "corruption" (ie later additions, deletions and editing) of the details of nearly all works has been acknowledged (see "Authority contests and pedigree", and the case of veda-s) in many places.

## Allowance for Context
- The acknowledged need to consider the context of their composition and need for later mutation.
- Hindu behavioral (../social/ legal/ personal) system is **not at all static**. More [here](../../social-cultivation/dharma-fluid/).
- The acknowledged need to interpret (an unspecified number of) statements rather than take them literally.

## Moral ought?
- According to some: Hindu traditions do **not have the moral "ought"** -rather they intend the word "should" - a statement of opinion that may require discussion and justification.
- (The distinction is explained [in this article](http://www.hipkapi.com/2011/03/18/ought-vs-should/) by a follower of shrI-bAlagangAdhara.) Summary: (a) " You should not play with fire if you do not want to get burnt." vs (b) "You ought not to torture fellow-human beings (if you want to remain a moral human being)." : Regarding (a): Is the statement valid if I wear a fire-proof suit, or I use a long non-conductive stick, or move a robot to do that using remote control? Of course not.

## Stories as allegories in the shAstra-s
- Hindu holy texts sometimes describe events and phenomena, which may be sometimes taken as (or mistaken as) historical or scientific fact.
- The stories pertaining to the deva-s are explicitly admitted to be "illusory" in the veda itself.
