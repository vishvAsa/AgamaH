title = "1 1 Remarks concerning the critical edition"

+++

The present text has been critically edited by Kei Kataoka \(Kataoka 2004a\). While working on this translation, some minor changes to the edition have been proposed and discussed in the endnotes. On the basis of such emendations, Kei Kataoka plans to publish on-line a revised critical edition of the text at this address:

http://www2.lit.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kkataoka/Kataoka/NMaprR.pdf

In general, many changes consist in preferring the readings offered by the manuscript identified in Kataoka 2004a as K1, i.e., “A manuscript preserved in the Malayalam Department of the University of Calicut, No. 2602. Malayalam Script, Palm leaf, 177 folios” \(Kataoka 2004a, p. 218\). This preference is due to K1’s higher reliability, as ascertained throughout the 3

critical editions of other sections of the NM prepared by Kataoka on the basis also of K1.1

The copyist who wrote K1 \(or its model\) was probably a learned person, who was able to understand what he was copying \(unlike, for instance, the copyist responsible of the Allahabad manuscript A1, also used in Kataoka 2004a\). Given the Indian context, however, this also means that the copyist probably felt it legitimate to add clarifications to the text. Accordingly, one happens to find additional particles such as *hi * or *tu * only in K1. Whenever such particles make the text clearer, but are not absolutely necessary and are only present in K1, we assumed that they were additions of K1, made for the sake of clarity \(e.g., *ca *\(to be interpreted as an adversative\) changed into *tu * in section 2.1.1.2.1; *śrutismṛtivirodhe * instead of *smṛtivirodhe * in section 2.1.2; *manvādīnāṃ ca pratyakṣo * instead of *manvādīnāṃ pratyakṣo * in section 2.2.1.1\). 

Consequently, they have not been included in the critically reconstructed text.
