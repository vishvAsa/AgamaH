Some "modern" deshI-s were making fun of kauTilya's upaniShat methods. Had to remind them the allure of such was not passed by even the mahAmlechCha & the soviet rUs. The former had a program for a dUrdR^iShTi-prayoga. 

I encountered a peculiar American woman who did dUradR^iShTi-prayoga. While one could pin down a lot of the vaguer descriptions she provided to confirmation bias, she was able to correctly visualize and draw a couple of unusual objects that were in the dUrakShetra-s. I don't know of an exact way of estimating the probability by chance of such hits, but, given that one would hardly have expected those specific objects in those dUrakShetra-s, the probability would be low. While having imperfect success she did correctly do a book-reading: Open page so and so of book n on mth row of the shelf & you'll find words x,y..
