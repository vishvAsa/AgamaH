## 2.1 Mīmāṃsā point of view: Veda-basis

### 2.1.1 Validity

#### 2.1.1.1 Minority argument about the common performers 
\[Jaimini-type of Mīmāṃsaka:\]

The Dharmaśāstras such as the one by Manu are certainly an instrument of knowledge like the Veda, because they teach specific actions which pertain to what the Veda teaches \(i.e., to the content of the Veda\).39 What is the \[purpose of an\] inquiry about them? 

#### 2.1.1.2 The Vedic base 
By contrast, in regard to them \(MDhŚā etc.\), some \(the Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsakas\) say that they are validii because they are based on the Veda.40 To elaborate: 37A different text \(reading *tantrāgamāntarāṇām * instead of *utāgamāntarāṇām * is presupposed by J.V. Bhattacharyya, who translates as follows: “If the first question is answered in the affirmative then the framer of the question has got nothing to say” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 544. We could not really understand this translation\). N.G. Shah, though reading in the same way, translates in a way which is quite close to ours \(Shah 1975-1992, p. 65\). 

[^38]: This argument is exemplified by a well-known verse of Kumārila, which will be quoted below, section 6.1.1.4. 

[^39]: The argument hinted at here is that Veda and recollected tradition have the same performers, see JS 1.3.2, quoted below, section 2.1.3. N.J. Shah seems to interpret in a more doctrinal way, at least insofar as he does not hint at the connection of Vedic and Dharmaśāstric prescription within the ritual \(see section 2.1.3\): “ ‘They are as much authentic as Vedas themselves, for they enjoin certain such acts as stand connected with what Vedas teach.’ Jayanta does not pause to consider as to how the acts in question are connected with what Vedas preach, for on the face of it these acts are something new altogether” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 13\). 

[^40]: The contrast is due to the fact that the MDhŚā, etc., are according to this view not on the same level of the Veda. 

Furthermore, this discussant adduces reasons in favour of their validity, whereas before the inquiry was avoided altogether. 

28

1. To begin with, one cannot imagine that the teachings of Manu etc., are based on an error, since there is no subsequent invalidating cognition, \[and\]41 since their contents \( *artha*\) are performed by people who know the Vedas, people who have never ceased to respect

\[the Vedas\] until today. 

2. Nor are they based on experience, since sense-perception is not able to determine a duty which has the form of something to be done and is not determined by the three times.42

3. Nor are they based on someone else’s teachings. Since even another person would have lacked an instrument of knowledge for understanding it \(duty\). If \[this other person\] had it \(an instrument of knowledge for knowing duty, e.g., yogic perception\), what would have Manu done wrong \( *aparāddha*\) \[for not having the same capacity\]?43

\[Nor can they be based on a sourceless teaching by someone else\] because, given that there is no instrument of knowledge at the root, even if one were to assume \( *kḷp*-\) an unbroken succession of human utterances, it would be impossible to avoid that it resembles a recollection \[about colour\] handed down by blind people.44

4. Nor is the assumption correct that the revered \( *bhagavān*\) Manu etc. taught in this way as deceivers, because there is no subsequent invalidating cognition \[regarding what they teach\] and because of the acceptance \[of their teachings\] by the righteous \( *sādhu*\) people —this has been said already \(immediately before, point 1\). 

Therefore, out of lack of other options, the teachings of Manu, etc., must have as their root a cause called the Veda, since this cause is consistent \[with what one sees\] and able \[to produce a result such as the MDhŚā\]. The Bhaṭṭa \(Kumārila\) has said the \[same\] thing: The \[Vedic\] injunction is more economical than error \(1\) or experience \(2\), human utterance \(3\) \[and\] fraud \(4\) \[as base of the MDhŚā, etc.\], due to the consistence with what we see and the capability \[of producing a result such as the MDhŚā\] ||45

**2.1.1.2.1 Types of Vedic bases **In regard to the \[MDhŚā, etc.\], some \(following Śabara\)46

think that they are based on \[Vedic\] prescriptions inferred \( *unnī *-\) through observable mantras and commendatory statements. Others \(some Bhāṭṭas\) \[think that they\] are based on scattered branches \[of the Veda\]. Still others \(other Bhāṭṭas\) \[think that they\] are based on extinguished 41These must be two reasons, as pointed out by the *ca * in the parallel list *bādhakābhāvāt sādhujanaparigrahāc ca*, a few lines below \(Kataoka 2004a, p. 212, ll.4–5\). 

[^42]: See Introductory Study, section II.4.1. 

[^43]: This elliptic sentence allows more than one interpretation. We favoured this one interpreting it as a short insertion within the flow of the argument. Alternatively, one could read “…what would have Manu done wrong \[in following him\]?”, with the *hi * in the next sentence answering directly to it. A similar rhetorical question, with no answer is found in NM 4, NM, p. 608, in the context of discussing the validity of Āyurveda: *vedamūlatvam api …ayuktaṃ*

*kalpayitum…puruṣāntaropadeśapūrvakatve carakeṇaiva kim aparāddham? *

[^44]: The topos of the untrustworthy recollection concerning colour handed down from one blind person to the other \(about which see the introductory study, section II.4.2\) is already in ŚBh ad 1.3.1, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, pp. 162-163. 

[^45]: Bhattacharyya translates all ablatives as reasons for the statement that the Veda is the base of the recollected tradition: “No person is known to be infallible. The words of a person are sure to deceive us by their misdirection. 

An assumption must be based upon the solid rock of facts. If it is far away from facts then it is not convincing. 

Again, we shall have to make a minimum number of assumptions if we hold that Smṛti is based upon the Vedas” 

\(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 545\). Shah interprets *dṛṣṭa * as meaning *dṛṣṭānuṣṭhāna *‘the performance of rituals which we actually see’ and understands *anuguṇa * as an adjective of *sāmarthya*: “\[…\] because it it is able to lead to \[ritual\]

performances which we actually see” \( *\[…\] kāraṇ ke \[…\] dṛṣṭ anuṣṭhānonuṃ samarthan karavānuṃ sāmarthy*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 67\). 

[^46]: On the identification of these Mīmāṃsakas see the introductory study, section II.4.2.

branches \[of the Veda\]. Butiii we do not need this detailed specification.47 In all cases, according to the argument \[upheld\],48 the Veda only must be assumed as the root in regard to them \(MDhŚā etc.\), no other root, since there is no instrument of knowledge \[supporting any other root. Hence, by means of cogent evidence \( *arthāpatti*\), we can conclude that the Veda is the only root\]. 

#### 2.1.1.3 Distinction between Veda and recollected tradition 
And according to the view that \[the MDhŚā etc.\] have the Veda as their root, this appellation of \[the Dharmaśāstra-corpus\] as *smṛti *\(‘recollection’\), known by the entire world, will be supported \[by our argument\]. For if \[they\] were based on perception, like in the case of the Veda \[which is not called

‘recollection’\], in their case too, what would be the object of the word ‘recollection’? 

### 2.1.2 Conflict with the Veda

#### 2.1.2.1 Invalidation 
Moreover, if the \[recollected tradition\] is based on the Veda, when the recollected tradition contradicts the directly heard sacred texts \(i.e., the Veda\) it is easy to say that \[the recollected tradition\] must be invalidated because the two are not of equal rank.49

In one case \(the Veda\) the root is already formed \(i.e., present\), in the other \(the recollected tradition\) it has to be postulated. As soon as50 you resolve to postulate a sacred text out of the recollected tradition, the directly heard sacred text which contradicts the \[recollected tradition\], will come \( *avatṛ*-\) to your mind. Hence, how could then the recollected tradition be capable to postulate a \[different\] root? This has been said \[by Kumārila\]: There is a common proverb: How could the \(much slower\) ass, later, obtain that which was previously taken away by the horse? || \(TV ad 3.1.14, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 712\)51

#### 2.1.2.2 Option 
Another \(Mīmāṃsaka\)52 says: “In this case \(of conflict\) the option is appropriate. As reported \( *kila*\) \[in the Prābhākara school\], the Veda is of two kinds, directly heard and inferred. The directly heard one is called ‘sacred text’ \( *śruti*\), and the inferred one 47It is Mīmāṃsā’s business to discuss further. 

48“\[…\]if we are true to our reasoning power” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 545\). Shah translates “in the appropriate way” \( *je rīte ghaṭe te rīte*, Shah 1975-1992, p. 67\)

[^49]: Although Kumārila’s final position will be different \(see introductory study, section II.4.3\), this view is probably inspired by his words: “To begin with, the recollected tradition is not recognised as an instrument for knowing dharma in itself, so that —sharing an equal rank \[with the Veda\]— it would reach the chance of being opted for

\[instead of the Veda, in case of conflicts\]” \( *smṛter dharmapramāṇatvaṃ na tāvat svata iṣyate | tulyakakṣatayā yena* *vikalpapadavīṃ vrajet ||*, TV ad 1.3.3, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 175\). 

[^50]: The temporal intepretation of *yāvad…tāvad * is justified by the source passage, i.e., TV ad 1.3.3: *smṛtyā cārthaṃ*

*parāmṛśya yāvat tadviṣayāṃ śrutim | anumātuṃ pravarteta tāvat so ’rtho ’nyato gataḥ || *\(Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 177, ll.9–10\)

[^51]: We interpret the passage as stating that the Veda overcomes the recollected tradition because a directly perceived statement overcomes an inferred one, insofar as if there is a perceived statement, the inference just does not take place. This is in harmony with the Mīmāṃsā tenet \(for which, see Kataoka 2003b\) that an instrument of knowledge must yield fresh information \(against the Nyāya claim that more than one instrument of knowledge can know the same thing, or *pramāṇasamplava*\). By contrast, Bhattacharyya excludes the possibility of contradictions between Vedic passages and translates accordingly: “Whenever one exerts his mind to recollect a passage from the Vedas which constitutes the basis of the Smṛti text the Vedic passage which contradicts the conclusion of the Smṛti text flashes before his mind. How can one assume that the said Smṛti text has a corresponding Vedic passage as its basis? 

In other words, as there is no contradiction in the Vedas so the two conflicting Vedic passages do not exist. Kumārila says to this effect. A proverb runs thus: — “How can an ass carry a load which was carried before by a horse?” 

\(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 546\). Shah translates: “ How could the recollected tradition invalidate or obstruct \[…\] the directly perceived Veda?” \(Shah 1975-1992, pp. 67-68\)

52 *vikalpa * is described as a solution of the conflict between Veda and recollected tradition in Kumārila’s TV \(see TV ad 1.3.4, quoted in Kataoka 2004a, p. 209\), but here it is justified through a Prābhākara tenet \(that of the two Vedas\), brought to the extreme result that the recollected tradition itself is a Veda. See introductory study, II.4.2. 

30

is \[called\] ‘recollected tradition’. And both of them are beginningless, therefore how could the one invalidate the other? For they are just the Veda, either manifest or non-manifest.53

For this very reason, \[Śabara’s\] assumption that \[the Dharmaśāstras\] are based on mantras, commendatory statements etc. is wrong, since the recollected Veda is beginningless \[just like the directly heard Veda\].”54

### 2.1.3 Invalidity of other texts

\[Obj.:\] Once the validity \[of the Dharmaśāstras\] has been so described as being based on the Veda, how can one reply to the ones who claim that also recollected traditions external \[to the Veda\] are valid? 

\[Mī.:\] It must be replied: These miserable people have already been refuted, because the revered Jaimini has said: “Rather, \[the established conclusion is as follows:\] Because the performers are common, the inferential cause \(i.e. the recollected tradition, insofar as it lets one infer a Vedic text\) is an instrument of knowledge” \(JS 1.3.2\). What does it mean that they have the same performers? It means that the same entitlement \( *adhikāra*\) is understood \[for both the Vedic duties and the ones enjoined by the Dharmaśāstras\]. The same agents who are entitled to perform the content of the Vedas \[are entitled\] to perform the content of the recollected tradition, as it is shown by the fact that \[people\] perform Vedic elements —such as spreading \[kuśa grass\] on the altar— which are mixed55 with elements \[learnt\] through the recollected tradition, such as sipping water from one’s palm.56

By contrast, no similar single entitlement is understood in regard to the recollected traditions outside \[the Veda\]. Therefore, only the recollected traditions of Manu, etc. are an instrument of knowledge, not the recollected traditions outside \[the Veda\]. 

## 2.2 Nyāya point of view: author’s reliability

\[Mī.:\] Surely, also the recollected traditions by Manu, etc. \[like the Veda\], are an instrument of knowledge insofar as they are based on the Veda, and not out of any other \[reason, such as the fact of having been uttered by a reliable speaker\]

### 2.2.1 Validity: yogic perception

\[Nai:\] To this it must be replied: You, as I learnt, \( *kila*\), announce this validity through the fact that \[the recollected tradition\] is based on the Veda because you cannot endure \( *mṛṣ*-\) the yogic perception, which grasps the dharma. But this is wrong. Like in fact the revered Lord, author of everything, ruler of everything, who sees everything and who is compassionate towards everyone, is justified as the author of the Vedas, in the same way the yogic perception also, which is capable of grasping dharma and is different from the common perception of people like us, has indeed been justified \[by us\] within the definition of perception. 

Therefore, the teachings of Manu, etc., should be based on it \(yogic perception\). 

53“So Śruti and Smṛti are nothing but the Vedas living and dead in our memory” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 546\). 

[^54]: And hence it does not need to be inferred from the directly heard Veda, it is there ab initio, see Introductory Study, section II.4.2. 

[^55]: NMGBh glosses *saṃvalita * with *miśra*, and Jayanta himself speaks of *miśrānuṣṭhāna * in section 6.2.2.1. 

[^56]: The reference is to a passage in the ŚBh, where the opponent claims that no sipping has to be performed, since it is not mentioned in the Vedic texts, which —instead— just say that “after having made the broom, he should make the altar” \( *vedaṃ kṛtvā vediṃ kurvīta*, ŚBh ad 1.3.6, Subbāśāstrī 1929-1934, p. 197\). As with section 2.1, Shah underplays the role of performers and interprets the passage as referring to doctrinal contents rather than ritual practices: “That is impossible because our Smṛtis say new things in conjunction with what Vedas say, which is not the case with non-Vedic scriptural texts; e.g. Smṛtis enjoin sipping water, which is something new to them and they enjoin furnishing the sacrificial ground, which is something said in Vedas” \(Shah 1992-97, p. 14\). 

31

You \(Mīmāṃsaka\) say that only the \[Vedic\] injunction is the instrument of knowledge in regard to it \(dharma\), intending: “How can the dharma, which is not determined by the three times be understandable through sense-perception?” \(cf. above, section 2.1.1.2\).57. This is refuted exactly by the establishment of the Lord’s perception. Like the Lord’s perception grasps the connection of what has to be realised and the instrument to realise it, related to heaven \(as what has to be realised\) and the Agnihotra, etc. \(as the instruments to realise it\), in the same way the perception of Manu, etc., will grasp \[the same connection\] related to sacrifices like the Aṣṭakā \(as instruments to realise heaven, etc.\). Thus, in regard to the

\[dharma\] it does not matter if it is not determined through the three times or not.iv **2.2.1.1 Distinction between Veda and recollected tradition **\[Mī.:\] If so, the Lord is not omniscient, since \[He\] did not grasp that the acts such as the Aṣṭakā are dharmas. Or, if, having known \[it\], He did not teach it, He is not compassionate. 

\[Nai.:\] This is not a mistake. The Lord really knows everything. Something He teaches by Himself, something He lets others teach \[on His behalf\]. Because, these \[people like Manu\]

have been favoured by the mercy of this Lord, and they obtained such knowledge \(i.e., the knowledge that the Aṣṭakā etc. are dharmas\) just out of His mercy. 

Also in the Veda it is recited that the dharma is perceptible for Manu, etc.: “The ṛṣis directly experienced the dharma. They transmitted by teaching the mantras to others who had not directly experienced dharma”.58

### 2.2.2 Conflict with the Veda

\[Obj.:\] But since in this way there would be no distinction \[between the two\] insofar as they are

\[both\] based on perception, in case of conflict between sacred texts and recollected traditions there would be option, like between the prescriptions concerning the Bṛhat\[- *sāman*\] and the Rathantara\[- *sāman*\].59 The one \(the sacred texts\) would not be able to invalidate the other \(the recollected tradition\). For there is no distinction at all as for the validity of God’s perception and of a yogin’s perception. \[UP.:\] But there will be one \[distinction\] made of the natural \( *naisargika*\) condition \[of God’s perception\] and the brought-about \( *āhārya*\) condition \[of Manu’s etc. perception\].60 \[Obj:\] What is \[accomplished\] through this \[minor difference\]? 

\[Obviously, nothing significant\]. 

\[Nai.:\] It must be replied: There might well be option. What is wrong \[with it\]? Also the ones \(the Mīmāṃsakas\)61 who claim that \[the Dharmaśāstras\] are based on the Veda explain some \[cases of\] option. Otherwise, the option will be explained through the distinction of content \[between Vedic and Dharmaśāstric prescriptions\].62 And the ones who are expert in 57Cf. the sequence MS 1.1.2 \( *codanālakṣaṇo ’rtho dharmaḥ *“the dharma is that good thing which is known by a Vedic injunction”\) and MS 1.1.4 \(\[…\] *pratyakṣam animittaṃ vidyamānopalambhanatvāt *“\[…\] sense perception is not a cause \[for grasping dharma\] because it grasps only present things”\), following from it. 

[^58]: We could find as source only Nirukta 1.20 \(in Sarup 1984\). The same passages is quoted in the *vṛtti * ad *Vākyapadīya * I, v.5 \(Bhartrhari 1965, p. 24\). 

[^59]: NMGBh explains that each of the two tunes is said to occur as the last one by a different prescription. Bhattacharyya adds the following explanation: “Let us take an example from the Sāma Veda. It has been enjoined that a Vedic song is to be sung loudly \(the song is to be set to the tune Bṛhat Sāman\). It has also been enjoined that the same song is to be sung lowly \(the song is to be set to the tune Rathantara Sāman\). \[…\] Therefore in such cases the performer is permitted to exercise his discretion” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, pp. 548–9\). 

[^60]: Shah explains that it is brought about by their powers: *prabhāvathī upalabdh *\(Shah 1975-1992, p. 70\). Bhattacharyya explains: “God’s perception is eternal whereas the perception of the sages is an event of time” \(Bhattacharyya 1978, p. 549\). 

[^61]: Cf. “In fact, option is correct since the instrument of knowledge \[upon which two seemingly contradictory statements are based\] is of an equal rank” \( *vikalpa eva hi nyāyyas tulyakakṣyapramāṇataḥ*, TV ad 1.3.4, Subbāśāstrī

1929-1934, p. 188, l.14\). See also the introductory study, section II.4.3. 

[^62]: I.e., according to one’s qualifications, one will use the Veda or a Dharmaśāstra, hence there is a role-division among them \(see introductory study, section II.4.3\). Shah uses *viṣay * also in the Gujarātī translation and does not 32

the recitation of the Veda say that there is no example \( *udāharaṇa*\) of conflict between sacred texts and recollected tradition.63 Therefore, the validity of the Dharmaśāstras, like that of the Vedas, is due to the fact that they are based on the perception of a reliable person.
