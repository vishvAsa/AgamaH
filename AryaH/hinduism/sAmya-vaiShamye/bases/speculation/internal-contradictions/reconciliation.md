 A classification of statements of veda-s is:

- vidhi-vAkya (command/ injunction)
- arthavAda (laudatory or denunciatory statement).

Subdivisions of arthavAda:

- gunavada - opposed to what is known through other pramanas, and thus has to be interpreted in a different way.
- anuvada - "merely repeats what is known through other pramana-s, and cannot thus be the main import of the Vedas, which are supposed to reveal what cannot be known from other sources."
- bhutArthavada - "neither opposed to what is known by other pranianas, nor can they be confirmed by other pramana-s.".
  - vedAntin-s consider them authoritative.
  - pUrva-mImAmsaka-s don't consider them authoritative.

## Multi-level understanding
Multiple appropriate meanings

- upaniShad-s provide a framework for understanding a sagely statement in AdyAtmika, Adi-daivika and Adi-bhautika terms.
- yAska's nirukta explains the same mantra from different perspectives.
  - " सोमं॑ मन्यते पपि॒वान् यत् स॑म्पिं॒षन्त्योष॑धिम्। सोमं॒ यं ब्र॒ह्माणो॑ वि॒दुर्न तस्या॑श्नाति॒ कश्च॒न ॥ " इत्य् ऋचो व्याख्या यास्केन द्वेधा दत्ता  \- अधियज्ञरीत्या, अधिदैवरीत्या च \[[मूलम्](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.282289/2015.282289.The-Niruktam#page/n471/mode/1up)\]।
- patanjali in mahAbhAShya provides such an example while elucidating P I.3.14 - 29 R I.16 - 18 {2/29}  "catvari śṛṅgā trayaḥ asya padā dve śīrṣe sapta hastāsaḥ asya tridhā baddhaḥ vṛṣabhaḥ roravīti mahaḥ devaḥ martyān a viveśa " \[[ITX](http://www.intratext.com/ixt/san0011/_P4.HTM#VS)\], while sAyaNa acknowledges different multiple meanings \[[RV4.58.3](https://archive.org/stream/RgVedaWithSayanasCommentaryPart2/rv_sayanabhasya_part2#page/n768/mode/1up)\].


## एक-वाक्यता
shruti statements which support reconciliation include: " सर्वे वेदाः/ सर्वे घोषाः एकैव व्याहृतिः " , "नामानि सर्वाणि यमाविशन्ति "

The way to correctly derive valid knowledge out of the sacred books is to :

- apply proper mImAMsA analysis encompassing all valid texts (thereby applying a sort of averaging),
- One doesn't use isolated quotes to make cases about what a text does or does not stand for - that is considered childish and stupid within hindu tradition. Instead one needs to consider and reconcile a whole mass of contradictory statements within all "prAmANika" texts -- this is the main purpose of a branch of analysis called miimaamsa . That is exactly what old commentators claimed to have done, and that is what modern interpreters and critics must do if they are honest.
- For example see this series of ongoing classes on rAmAnuja-s commentary on bhagavadgItA - shrIbhAShyam [http://ramanuja.org/sri/SribhashyaClass/Topics](http://ramanuja.org/sri/SribhashyaClass/Topics) \- the instructor went on and on with preliminaries for well over 10 hours before finally deciding to get to the central text and bring up background/ context as required.

### Examples
madhva in Rigbhashya reportedly relies on the एकवाक्यता of the veda-s to show  that all of the statements in veda-s (including Indra killing Vrtra, or a description of river or any other geographical or physical matters) are descriptions of hari
- Later thinkers like aravinda-ghoSha and dayAnanda sarasvatI did something similar.        

## Comparative mythology
- vena = venus in RV hymn 10.123 etc.. ([TW1](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/869392725682122752)) Not intelligeible with bhAShya ([S_RV](https://archive.org/stream/RgVedaWithSayanasCommentaryPart4/rv_sayanabhasya_part4#page/n865/mode/2up)).
- In somayaga, there's subrahmanya vachana. "gaurāvaskandin ahalyāyai jāra" - meaning for indra obscure.
  - "One atrocious Ramayana story or explaining away with solar interpretation by kumarila."
