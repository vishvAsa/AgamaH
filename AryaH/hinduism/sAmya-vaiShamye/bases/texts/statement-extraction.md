## Classification 
Some of the statements within these texts are observational, while others are speculative. They are each considered in separate pages.

Statements -

- Supra-sensory/ non-observational speculation
  - deva-s, brahma, consequences of AchAra etc..
- observational/ inferential 
  - natural world, wellbeing of self, society ...
  - Proper behavior / AchAra to a good extant (as experiements which worked).

One classification of statements of veda-s is:

- vidhi-vAkya (command/ injunction)
- arthavAda (laudatory or denunciatory statement).

Subdivisions of arthavAda:

- gunavada - opposed to what is known through other pramanas, and thus has to be interpreted in a different way.
- anuvada - "merely repeats what is known through other pramana-s, and cannot thus be the main import of the Vedas, which are supposed to reveal what cannot be known from other sources."
- bhutArthavada - "neither opposed to what is known by other pranianas, nor can they be confirmed by other pramana-s.".
  - vedAntin-s consider them authoritative.
  - pUrva-mImAmsaka-s don't consider them authoritative.

## Multi-level understanding
Multiple appropriate meanings

- upaniShad-s provide a framework for understanding a sagely statement in AdyAtmika, Adi-daivika and Adi-bhautika terms.
- yAska's nirukta explains the same mantra from different perspectives.
  - " सोमं॑ मन्यते पपि॒वान् यत् स॑म्पिं॒षन्त्योष॑धिम्। सोमं॒ यं ब्र॒ह्माणो॑ वि॒दुर्न तस्या॑श्नाति॒ कश्च॒न ॥ " इत्य् ऋचो व्याख्या यास्केन द्वेधा दत्ता  \- अधियज्ञरीत्या, अधिदैवरीत्या च \[[मूलम्](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.282289/2015.282289.The-Niruktam#page/n471/mode/1up)\]।
- patanjali in mahAbhAShya provides such an example while elucidating P I.3.14 - 29 R I.16 - 18 {2/29}  "catvari śṛṅgā trayaḥ asya padā dve śīrṣe sapta hastāsaḥ asya tridhā baddhaḥ vṛṣabhaḥ roravīti mahaḥ devaḥ martyān a viveśa " \[[ITX](http://www.intratext.com/ixt/san0011/_P4.HTM#VS)\], while sAyaNa acknowledges different multiple meanings \[[RV4.58.3](https://archive.org/stream/RgVedaWithSayanasCommentaryPart2/rv_sayanabhasya_part2#page/n768/mode/1up)\].
- madhva in Rigbhashya reportedly relies on the एकवाक्यता of the veda-s to show  that all of the statements in veda-s (including Indra killing Vrutra, or a description of river or any other geographical or physical matters) are descriptions of hari
  - shruti statements which support this include: " सर्वे वेदाः/ सर्वे घोषाः एकैव व्याहृतिः " , "नामानि सर्वाणि यमाविशन्ति "
  - Later thinkers like aravinda-ghoSha and dayAnanda sarasvatI did something similar.
