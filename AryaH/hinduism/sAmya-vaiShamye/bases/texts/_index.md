Hindus have sacred books (aka shAstra-s -  Veda-s, epics including itihAsa-s, purANa-s, dharma-shAstra-s). Not one, but many. Some would call it "religion of the library" to contrast with "religions of the book". 

These too are not absolute; and their injunctions are **not binding regardless of context.**

 ## Classification 
Some of the statements within texts are observational, while others are speculative. 

From the perspective of mutability -

- Supra-sensory/ non-observational speculation
  - deva-s, brahma, consequences of AchAra etc..
- observational/ inferential 
  - natural world, wellbeing of self, society ...
  - Proper behavior / AchAra to a good extant (as experiements which worked).

The former is considered in the speculation page. 

The latter is considered in the tradition page.

Here we consider general issues affecting texts.
