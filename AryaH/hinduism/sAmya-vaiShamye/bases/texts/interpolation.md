## Detection
Words present in some recensions but not in others are likely interpolated or elided.

A verse or statement that should have been cited by an ancient commentator, but begins appearing in later works, is likely interpolated.


## History

### Acknowledgement
- A position adopted by the likes of madhvAcArya is that many works (especially itihAsa-s and purANa-s) contains interpolations, deletions and corruptions. \[[MTN](http://mahabharata-resources.org/mbtntrans/chapter_2_gururajahrao.pdf)  2.3\]
- vedAntadeshika pointed out that some use fabricated texts, ascribing them to vyAsa.

## Motivation

Sometimes, marginal comments may come to be inserted into the main text when the manuscript is copied.

>  "Many parts of Bhavishya purana are original. Some chapters were added in time of Akbar to show him reincarnation of Prithviraj Chauhan. 2 chapters were added by either William Jones or Eric Pargiter to show that British are descendants of Hanuman who were blessed by Bhagvan Ram to rule India. William Jones also removed some key verses of puranas." - bhaviShyapurANa
