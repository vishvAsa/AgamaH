## Detection
Words present in some recensions but not in others are likely interpolated or elided.

A verse or statement that should have been cited by an ancient commentator, but begins appearing in later works, is likely interpolated.

## Motivation

- Sometimes, marginal comments may come to be inserted into the main text when the manuscript is copied.
- Deliberate intent to misrepresent ancient thought.

## History
### Acknowledgement
- A position adopted by the likes of madhvAcArya is that many works (especially itihAsa-s and purANa-s) contains interpolations, deletions and corruptions. \[[MTN](http://mahabharata-resources.org/mbtntrans/chapter_2_gururajahrao.pdf)  2.3\]
- vedAntadeshika pointed out that some use fabricated texts, ascribing them to vyAsa.

### Famous cases
mahopaniShad, quoted by mAdhvas and rAmAnujIya-s (but not by shankara), currently has an inperpolation providing the "finger in front of the eye leading to two moons being seen" example -

> द्विचन्द्रशुक्तिकारूप्यमृगतृष्णादिभेदतः ।  
अभ्यासं प्राप्य जाग्रत्तत्स्वप्नो नानाविधो भवेत् ॥ १५॥

shAnkaras invented  shukarahasya "upanishad". Quoted by none in defense before, but suddenly in recent times - justifying their interpretation of tattvamasi using lakshana against the argument of ramanuja that mukhyartha itself is possible using some interpolated upanishad where it is claimed tattvamasi should interpreted with lakshana only.

>  "Many parts of Bhavishya purana are original. Some chapters were added in time of Akbar to show him reincarnation of Prithviraj Chauhan. 2 chapters were added by either William Jones or Eric Pargiter to show that British are descendants of Hanuman who were blessed by Bhagvan Ram to rule India. William Jones also removed some key verses of puranas." - bhaviShyapurANa
