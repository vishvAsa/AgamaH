title = "Statement-classification"
+++
Some of the statements within these texts are observational, while others are speculative. They are each considered in separate pages.

One classification of statements of veda-s is:

- vidhi-vAkya (command/ injunction)
- arthavAda (laudatory or denunciatory statement).

Subdivisions of arthavAda:

- gunavada - opposed to what is known through other pramanas, and thus has to be interpreted in a different way.
- anuvada - "merely repeats what is known through other pramana-s, and cannot thus be the main import of the Vedas, which are supposed to reveal what cannot be known from other sources."
- bhutArthavada - "neither opposed to what is known by other pranianas, nor can they be confirmed by other pramana-s.".
  - vedAntin-s consider them authoritative.
  - pUrva-mImAmsaka-s don't consider them authoritative.
