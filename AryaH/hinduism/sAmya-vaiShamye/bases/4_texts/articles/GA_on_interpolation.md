title = "GA on interpolation"
+++

When someone raises the question of interpolations in a sacred text, there are two kinds of responses one can take--one of them looks faithful to tradition but rightly causes ridicule, while the other is respectable and broadens our conceptions:

1. This text was composed as a whole by one author within a short period of time (few months, few years) within his lifetime. This will not hold up to be the case and you have essentially bought into the "one-text, one author" conception of canonicity.+++(4)+++ This text was received as a whole, therefore what was added into this 'whole' later can alone constitute an interpolation. Now, it becomes easy for the other person to go: "This small core of the text is the original 'whole'. Everything else was added to it".

2. A text can be composed by multiple authors over multiple generations. Its being attributed to a single author pertains to a higher plane and what it teaches us is that the received text (despite being composed over centuries) is to be treated as a unity and perceived as having a single intent (as embodied through the ahistorical, but nonetheless 'true', single author). What ratifies its completed and canonical status is the consensus of the lineages associated with, and inheriting, the text.

It will be seen that the skilful theologian who takes the 2nd approach outlined above is the genuine exemplar of faith. He can take the Veda and Agama, for instance, appreciate that they may have been composed across centuries by hundreds of minds and yet see the unity in them because he actually and fully believes in a single, guiding hand (Ishvara) that shapes and controls those hundreds of minds across history.
