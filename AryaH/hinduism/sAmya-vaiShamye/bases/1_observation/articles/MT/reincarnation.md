People who seek to find empirical evidence for reincarnation have collected case studies of two types. One of those types is much better known and quite popular among believers:

1. It primarily involves a memory of the previous incarnation in early childhood. It often vanishes or becomes muted at the junction of childhood amnesia -- around 6-7 years when early childhood memories are lost and more lasting memories of later childhood continuing into adolescence and adulthood are laid down.+++(4)+++ These early memories or behaviors, believed to be from the prior incarnation, appear quite spontaneously in that early window from 1-7 years.

2. The less discussed type of case study (though some people have gathered over a hundred of them) is where the individual suddenly has that experience, usually as an adult. Here, they briefly slip into a vision lasting a few minutes to an hour, into a "different life" and experience it. Usually, the experience is clear enough for them to realize that they were participants in what they take to be a prior existence. Sometimes it is triggered as a "deja vu" like experience when they go to some place or meet someone. For some reason, this second type, despite being very vivid and potentially verifiable in cases like the first type, is largely neglected.
