People over-estimate how seriously Kalivarjya lists were taken to be. For example, some texts say it is Kalivarjya to give higher share to elder sons, but the Laghu-Dharmaprakasika states that it is one of the anachara-s (Here the an- is not used to imply prohibition, but restriction to a region) of Keralavasi-s that only the eldest must inherit. [This is clearly targeted at Nambudiri-s]. Same text lists another anachara that the Ksatriya-s are enjoined to practice marumakkathayam [Targeting Nairs].

Although the specific usage of "anachara" implies that the author did perceive this as deviance to a higher transcendent norm (but still a Dharma). But this is usually not the case, other texts mentioning lokachara-s don't necessarily state it is "deviant" or "regional".
