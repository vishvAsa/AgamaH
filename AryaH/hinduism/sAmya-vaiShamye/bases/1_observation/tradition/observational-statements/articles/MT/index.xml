      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1529692262954946562.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQiv5QP0Vys&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Olivelle mentions the idea of anumita-shruti or the inferred shruti to account for aspects of dharma that aren&amp;rsquo;t directly found in the shruti. Several seem to take this as a fictitious thing invented by the later authors to account for a vaidika pramANa. However, we believe we should take the same attitude towards it as we take in biological or linguistic evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In cellular organisms, there is a strong conserved core set of genes that is v.small with respect to the entire complement of genes. This core was definitely there in the common ancestor of all living organisms. It relates to some essential information transmission functions of the cell.+++(5)+++ However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the common ancestor did not have other functions. A subset of them existed even in the common ancestory but were not as well-conserved as the core and prone to lateral transfer, loss &amp;amp; displacement by new innovations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
