Pasting below a peculiar tale of premonition experienced by a woman in Ireland in the late 1800s, with the death of a steerage passenger from a fire on a boat from fatty pig meat. Copied from a British psychical journal:

The following account was sent to Professor Barrett in August, 1895, by Mrs. Lincoln, of 91, South Circular-road, Dublin.

On the night of October 15th, 1884, I was preparing for bed at 10.30, and suddenly a great fear overcame me, a sense of horror and fright about the steamship the "Nevada," which was homeward bound from New York, and in which my elder niece Emily was a passenger.

I was so vividly impressed with some calamity to the vessel that I earnestly prayed for the safety of the " Nevada" and all on board. I was in a miserable frame of mind, and wrote a few lines then and there. This was on a Wednesday night. 

On the following Friday, the 17th, the telegraph boys were calling out, "Arrival of the Nevada at Queenstown; on fire for three days previously; all safe." We got the paper, and I need scarcely say we were thankful for the good news of arrival in port. My niece and another lady had smelt fire on the 15th and mentioned it to the steward, who (though he knew it), to prevent panic said, "Oh, ladies are always fancying all sorts of things;" but it was soon made known, and as the cargo was partly sides of bacon, men had to go down into the hold and take up all the burning things and throw them overboard, whilst water was poured down the hold. These proceedings kept the fire under, but the steam from the water and the smoke was terrible; the ladies' clothes were saturated with the steam; the cabin floors were hot, so much so that when the ladies, to refresh themselves, changed their damp clothes, as they fell on the floor of the cabin, they dried almost immediately. 

My niece helped the people with hot coffee, etc., and no one lay down during the time from the discovery of the fire. One woman, a steerage passenger, went mad and jumped overboard. 

The poor sailors who went into the hold were much burned; two lost their sight and are now in the Seamen's Home (or hospital) in Liverpool. The Captain visited my niece afterwards in Egremont, and complimented her, as did the doctor, on her coolness and firmness, upholding the frightened women in the cabin. She was very poorly after this terrible experience.
