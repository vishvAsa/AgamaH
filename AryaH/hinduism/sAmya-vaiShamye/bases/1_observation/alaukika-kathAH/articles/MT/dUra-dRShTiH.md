Some "modern" deshI-s were making fun of kauTilya's upaniShat methods. Had to remind them the allure of such was not passed by even the mahAmlechCha & the soviet rUs. The former had a program for a dUrdR^iShTi-prayoga. 

I encountered a peculiar American woman who did dUradR^iShTi-prayoga. While one could pin down a lot of the vaguer descriptions she provided to confirmation bias, she was able to correctly visualize and draw a couple of unusual objects that were in the dUrakShetra-s. I don't know of an exact way of estimating the probability by chance of such hits, but, given that one would hardly have expected those specific objects in those dUrakShetra-s, the probability would be low. While having imperfect success she did correctly do a book-reading: Open page so and so of book n on mth row of the shelf & you'll find words x,y..

## Basis
> 1. The mere existence of duradrsti-type phenomena calls into question the entire model of neuroscience, which still forms the basis of McGilchrist’s work. What is your hunch about what really is happening, is the brain essentially an antenna that can resonate with and download  certain things from the “akashic cloud”, so to speak, depending on its architecture and training?

Q1: The short answer is I don't know. From what I've observed, I'm convinced there is something real here but it is thus far outside the realm for science; hence, it is difficult for me to convince others that something like this exists.  

As I noted in the essay, I do think the cases I've seen clearly have a "neural correlate". Hence, it is not entirely outside the realm of the neural architecture. This also accounts for the variability and rarity of the capacity. 

However, the explanation gap is in the receptor mechanism: similar to how homing of pigeons is incompletely understood.
