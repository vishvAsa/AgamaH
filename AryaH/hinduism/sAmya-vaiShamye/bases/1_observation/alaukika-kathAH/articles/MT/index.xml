      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1950057324912975910&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People who seek to find empirical evidence for reincarnation have collected case studies of two types. One of those types is much better known and quite popular among believers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It primarily involves a memory of the previous incarnation in early childhood. It often vanishes or becomes muted at the junction of childhood amnesia &amp;ndash; around 6-7 years when early childhood memories are lost and more lasting memories of later childhood continuing into adolescence and adulthood are laid down.+++(4)+++ These early memories or behaviors, believed to be from the prior incarnation, appear quite spontaneously in that early window from 1-7 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1735911649427488797&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; deshI-s were making fun of kauTilya&amp;rsquo;s upaniShat methods. Had to remind them the allure of such was not passed by even the mahAmlechCha &amp;amp; the soviet rUs. The former had a program for a dUrdR^iShTi-prayoga.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encountered a peculiar American woman who did dUradR^iShTi-prayoga. While one could pin down a lot of the vaguer descriptions she provided to confirmation bias, she was able to correctly visualize and draw a couple of unusual objects that were in the dUrakShetra-s. I don&amp;rsquo;t know of an exact way of estimating the probability by chance of such hits, but, given that one would hardly have expected those specific objects in those dUrakShetra-s, the probability would be low. While having imperfect success she did correctly do a book-reading: Open page so and so of book n on mth row of the shelf &amp;amp; you&amp;rsquo;ll find words x,y..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
