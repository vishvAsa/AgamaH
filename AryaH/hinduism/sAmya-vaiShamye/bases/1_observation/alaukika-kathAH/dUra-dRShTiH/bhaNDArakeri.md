The previous bhaNDArakeri maThAdhipati helped my parents track my run-away elder brother to tirupati. He spun a coconut and later guessed right.  
Parents received a letter from a tirupati postmaster asking him to come and collect his son.  
After the letter was received, the yati told parents - they should have received news by then. (which was true).
