      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: nAgarAj pATUri 2026&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The previous bhaNDArakeri maThAdhipati helped my parents track my run-away elder brother to tirupati. He spun a coconut and later guessed right.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Parents received a letter from a tirupati postmaster asking him to come and collect his son.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;After the letter was received, the yati told parents - they should have received news by then. (which was true).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source - kastUriH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An incident i personally witnessed. Situation was about missing jewelry in a household. A member of the household, say X, &amp;ldquo;slept on it&amp;rdquo; and when out of the &amp;ldquo;trance&amp;rdquo; confidently said, she not only knows who did it but also how to retrieve it. Apparently a V1 in the vision even taught the line of questioning to make the thief acknowledge the theft. The thief was a youth who frequent the household as a friend. The exact line of questioning was played out for real and the thief was accepted the deed. Then the parent of the thief was summoned. After hearing the confession and an acknowledgement that the jewelry is in the pawn shop, the parent agreed to either retrieve the jewels or refund cash equivalent. Family looked decent. The kid was just a kleptomaniac.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
