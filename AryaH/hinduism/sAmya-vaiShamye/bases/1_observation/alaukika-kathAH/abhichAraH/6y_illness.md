Was afflicted for almost 6 years of illnesses & bad luck, which stymied progress & could not be attributed to anything but malice from some quarter. My mother later found out that one of my cousins had done black magic against me and had divulged the fact to a mutual relative. So that’s black magic. 

As for plain evil eye, I’ve experienced it first hand when I brought a girl I intended to marry to India for a wedding. Our relationship went to total shit after that. Many incidents during that period made my grandmother declare it was evil eye and I believed it too due to how unusual the incidents were.
