      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: vigh / uttamasimha&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was afflicted for almost 6 years of illnesses &amp;amp; bad luck, which stymied progress &amp;amp; could not be attributed to anything but malice from some quarter. My mother later found out that one of my cousins had done black magic against me and had divulged the fact to a mutual relative. So that’s black magic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for plain evil eye, I’ve experienced it first hand when I brought a girl I intended to marry to India for a wedding. Our relationship went to total shit after that. Many incidents during that period made my grandmother declare it was evil eye and I believed it too due to how unusual the incidents were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;from: kw841&lt;br&gt;&#xA;provenance: first hand account&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend once contacted us regarding a problem his friend was facing. The problem was an acute abhichāra that was on-going. The guy already had close brush with death twice in that week. He was so shaken up that he practically locked himself in that room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His vaiṣṇava guru was traveling and uncontactable. He should have listened to his guru and performed the puraścharaṇa of +++(hayagrIva)+++ mantras given to him a year back. He was lax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: vAhana, 1st hand&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A relative a govt official was being harassed by goons. From a distance people from the siddheshvarI-pIThaM(?)noticed this and remarked: Dont you need weapons to defend against such? They did not give any mantra but a dhyAna shloka &amp;amp;chitra paTa with yantra. Results were very good. This was narrated to me when I noticed a bagalA chitra paTa in their pUja room and asked about it during a visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
