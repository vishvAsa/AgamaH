"Hinduism bad because i can't sleep in the afternoon and other petty rules".

Thread: It is bardic exaggeration to scare the masses into leading a disciplined life. 

Recently there have been many discussions on Hindu-X regarding rules in Hinduism, where it is claimed that "Hinduism sends you to hell for petty things", "Our ancestors are not that smart". 

We must keep in mind memeplexes like religions don't survive for thousands of years unless they have an element of 'lindy-ness' to them. 

First let's take a look at the "shouldn't sleep in afternoon". In Adi parva the story of Jaratkaru is mentioned. He is a great sage with lot of ascetic power. He's not someone who doesn't know the sastras. He's highly knowledgeable. And he is sleeping in the afternoon. SLEEPING IN THE AFTERNOON!! Then his wife wakes him up. Interestingly, she doesn't say that "if you sleep in the afternoon you will go to hell". She wakes him up by saying "you are going to miss out on sandhyavandana". This is also confirmed by Manu smriti which says, "If you sleep during sunrise and sunset (there by missing sandhyavandana) you must keep fast". 

"Then Ainz-sama what is the point of adding 'hell' for petty things?" It's not just this sleeping during day-time rule but many rules that place a lot of restrictions on pretty much every aspect of life. For example, cleaning your house, cooking. Which means simply leading a householder's life is a sin. 

Let me give another example. Agriculture is a sin. 

If you take above verses in their literal sense then you must ban household life and agriculture. (Note: these verses are not advocating nomadism/asceticism. They are addressed to Grhastas/householders only). 

Then what is the point of verses like above which ascribe sin to petty things like "using a broom"?

Before I answer that question, I need to establish something - Nature of masses. I remember an incident that happened in my school days. My English teacher gave us homework, but he said it is not compulsory i.e., he would not punish us if we didn't do it. He said we should it anyway because it is in our interest. The next day except me and 3 others nobody did it. I learned an important lesson that day. You cannot propel the masses to do anything unless you impose it on them by force and fear. 

> Only a minority of people move self-propelled. Jose Ortega.

It is not just western philosophers like Jose Ortega who said this. Long ago Chanakya also said the same thing.

Even before that Vyasa also said the same thing. Masses are not innately virtuous. If people are pious and moral on their own, then we would be in Krita-yuga. It is fear of state that keeps some in check. Fear of hell some others. Fear of society some others. Fear. Fear. Fear. Without fear there is no sacrifice. Without fear no charity. Without fear nothing. Fear.

Now that we established the nature of masses and how to propel them, lets return to the question. Why Hinduism says pretty much everything is a sin. The purpose of the verses which ascribe sin to inevitable but petty things (like using a broom, agriculture etc, the list is pretty long) is 'not to ban' them but to establish "sin is unavoidable". By establishing 'sin is inevitable', these verses terrorise the masses. First these verses put the masses in a cage of fear. Then they would give them the key to the door. The key being 'Nitya puja, sraddha/Bhakti, prayaschit, etc.' That is why Manu smriti immediatly gives Pancha Maha Yagnas as expiation for the sin of killing germs. Its purpose is not to ban brooming your house or cooking but to make the masses do Pancha Maha Yagnas.

Note: When I say masses and elite, I'm not referring to v1 and v4 etc. There are plenty of v1s with mass-mindset. There are plenty of v4s who are self-propelled. 

These verses are necessary to put the masses into fear. Which is pretty much only way to guide them towards virtue. 


A step-by-step breakdown

- Masses exist in a state of inertia
- We need fear to propell them (26/n) 
- These verses make it a sin for every petty/tiny action
- By doing so they establish "Sinless life is impossible"
- By doing so they put fear in masses
- Masses propelled by fear start moving toward virtue

For the masses which tasted the stick of "sleeping during day gets you hell", the carrot of "Sraddha/faith purifies all sins" tastes like divine nectar. For the masses terrified with hell, "Reading a single line of Mahabharata clears all sins" provides enormous comfort. 

This is why you should not read the verses literally. If you take literal meaning of "reading a single line of Mahabharata removes all sins" then you would do all kinds of sins throughout day, read a single line and think you are safe. These puranas and ithihasas are written in a tone of bardic exaggeration to appeal to masses. You must carefully think about purpose of the verses and what they are trying to say. What those verses are saying is 

> 'Sinless life is impossible. You should try to live sinless life as much as possible within your power. To the extent that you could not you should do prayaschit/expiation.' 

That is why Acharyas like Sri Abhinava Vidyateertha Mahaswamigal say "follow to the utmost extent possible" but never "You must follow 100%" 

I'm going to end by saying - Instead of constantly worrying about whether you are going to hell or not, focus on doing your dharma to the best of your ability. Do karma without bothering with Karma-Phala.
