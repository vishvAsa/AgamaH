## Topics
Observation-based shAstra-s (eg. खगोलम्, भूगोलम् अधि) are excluded from this section. Topics such as deva-s, brahma, (to some extant) dharma are beyond direct observation and inference.

Some such speculation is intended to broadly teach us about how to think about particular groups of devatA-s at a gross level, without necessarily insisting on accuracy of each detail.

### Towards non-speculation
Some topics have moved from the realm of speculation to that of observation and inference. Examples:

- Shape of earth
- Orbits of the planets
- Age of the universe
- Evolution of life
- Origin of elements in the universe.
