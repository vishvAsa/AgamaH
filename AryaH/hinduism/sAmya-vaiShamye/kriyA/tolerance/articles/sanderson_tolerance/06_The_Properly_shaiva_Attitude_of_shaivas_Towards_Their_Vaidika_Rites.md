title = "06 The Properly Śaiva Attitude of Śaivas Towards Their Vaidika Rites"

+++
Now this extension from the purely Śaiva domain of the ascetic in the Atimārga  into the Vaidika domain of the Śaiva householder added in the Mantramārga  opened the door to a process of Śaiva-Vaidika hybridization, in which rites of  both kinds were maintained and co-ordinated without a proper sense of their  distinctness. The Śaivas’ theoreticians, aware that this development had the  potential to produce a blurring of the boundary between the two domains  that would undermine the faith of Śaivas in the independence and supremacy  of Śaivism, ruled that while initiated Śaiva householders were thus subject to  two bodies of injunction – both the Śaiva and the Vaidika – their attitude  towards adherence to the latter was to differ fundamentally from that of the  Vaidikas. 

Two passages of early Saiddhāntika Śaiva scripture much cited by the commentators clarify this attitude. The first of these is in the Sarvajñānottara. In the  context of its prescription that only persons in two of the four Vaidika disciplines,  those of the unmarried scholar and the married householder, may be consecrated  as Śaiva officiants, it tells us that the Śaiva should maintain his Vaidika observances after initiation but without believing that they are fully real. He is to do  them but without subjective commitment. He should not think that by accommodating Vaidika rites beside the Śaiva he brings about a doubling of the benefit  that he will derive or that if he were to omit them he would damage that benefit.  

He is to see himself as acting in this regard not for his own advantage but so as  not to undermine through a pointless non-conformity the Vaidika order within  which Śaivism is embedded.44

The second passage is in the Mataṅgapārameśvara. This clarifies the matter  
in the language of the Mīmāṁsā by saying that though the initiate should maintain his Vaidika duties, here called ‘the mundane observance’ (laukikācāraḥ), he  must not conceive of them as ancillary elements (aṅgam) of his Śaiva observances,  which is to say, as elements without which those observances would be incomplete and therefore inefficacious.+++(5)+++ 45
