What does Gurukula mean:

- Kula is already referring to a lineage. While all lineages have their own validity, not all lineages are the same.
- It is an academic institution where you learn real Shastras but this real learning is not separated from sādhanā.
- Vimarsha as it stands now is both a movement and a school. My old approach to just a school did not work. Why? That means I have to rely on resourceful people and at the end, the agenda gets derailed and everything in the world is sucked up into the belly of the monster called politics.

## Ideal guru
My ideal Guru for envisioning Vimarsha is Khaptad Baba. I have never witnessed so many siddhis in a single person other than Khaptad Baba, but he was trained as a medical doctor, a scientist by heart, and he always taught me to explore empirically. Even for something so impossible, like explaining his supernatural powers.
