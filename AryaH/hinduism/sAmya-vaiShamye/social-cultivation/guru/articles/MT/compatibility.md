Arya tradition places importance on the right coupling of teacher and student -- not every student is right for every teacher & vice versa. This is a custom-made pair. For exoteric matters, this might not matter that much -- as long as there is sufficient compatibilty & competence on both sides, one can learn procedures from the teacher. 

However, behind the procedures is a "meaning" that might be termed "esoteric". For the transmission of this esoteric aspect of the teaching one needs that match to be nearly perfect & it has to proceed for most part in secret for as we have partly explained [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/01/16/subjective-and-objective-insight/). This knowledge can only be grasped when a special switch is turned on. Without that being the case, the teaching will seem like gibberish; hence, it would be inappropriate to put it out in public. 

Where such a transmission differs from the West Asian unmAda-s is that it accepts that the switch cannot be turned on in everyone by the same devices. This secret teaching is an important part of the transmission particularly in scriptural matters, but it could also be in other matters like warfare, math & philosophy. Hence, tradition tends to use the doubly semantic word upa-ni-Shat for such teaching (e.g., chANakya in the context of war). 

Those who don't acquire such esoteric knowledge tend to conflate it with the necessary apparatus inside which it is embedded. Thus, they become like the legendary donkeys carrying the sandalwood unaware of the scent or value of their load. Thus, they might know the bhujA-koTi-karNa-nyAya & be able to solve all manner of problems with it but fail to see its implications for the foundations of geometry. 

The match between the teacher and student is a critical issue. What guNa-s are considered great in a student might not work with every teacher. Consider a teacher who likes to teach Euclidean geometry starting with the axioms. He says, 1. A point is that which has no part; 2. A line is a breadthless length. Imagine a student whose guNa is hypercuriousity & need to understand everything. He might get caught up right there asking what the hell those axioms mean & never get past it. Such a pair might be incompatible though they might work OK with others.
