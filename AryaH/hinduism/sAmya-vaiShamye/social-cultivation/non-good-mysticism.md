Mysticism does not imply goodness

It must be noted that mysticism and ability to achieve mystic highs do not necessarily imply goodness:

- muhammad was a mystic, so were sufis of the type described [here](http://www.chakranews.com/beauty-and-the-beast-of-sufism/2454). 
- mahAyAna rebellion of 515 China \[[IMG](https://i.imgur.com/Ps9LX8J.png)\], where the doctrine seemed to include: "kill 10 enemies and become a 10th stage bodhisattva; kill all monks in captured monasteries" etc..
- Many villains in hindu mythology - rAvaNa to narakAsura - were accomplished [sAdhaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhaka)-s.

All sAdhaka-s (mystics) don't necessarily follow the same dharma shAstra (moral code); and they don't necessarily "transcend" the moral codes of their culture. Rather, their sAdhana gives them the strength to pursue what they consider "good and proper behavior" with an unusually great zeal. So, just as it is possible for the vAmAchArin who has discarded social rules to steal and eat parts of burning corpses, it is possible for the sufi to have great mystical experiences, and be a temple destroying zealot.
