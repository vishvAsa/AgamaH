title = "King and pratiloma-s"
+++

In Bṛhaspatismṛti, the king is told to protect the dharmas of those born of pratilomas, those residing in forts, and the dharmas of specific deśa & jāti. Even though, elsewhere they may be punishable, but for them they shouldn't be so, or else they would develop aversion for the king, which'll lead to destruction of his power and treasury. Following are some examples of dharmas given:

1. Dākṣiṇātya dvijas marry the sibling of their mothers, etc.
2. In the Madhyadeśa, hired workers & artisans eat cow meat.
3. Those in the east eat fish and the eastern women indulge in adultery.
4. In the north, women drink intoxicating drinks, men touch women undergoing menstruation, and the twin brother marries (?) the widow of his brother.

For these acts, no punishment and prāyaścitta is required.

Vīramitrodaya's author cites Madanaratnākara on this, which says that in the specific deśa, performing actions which are against śruti and smṛti, does produce sin, but it cannot hinder the vyavahāra. Though, it says, it certainly will cause the attainment of naraka.
