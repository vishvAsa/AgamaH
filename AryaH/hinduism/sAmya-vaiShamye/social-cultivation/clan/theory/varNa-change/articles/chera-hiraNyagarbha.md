Came across very interesting details about the royal Hiranyagarbha ceremony performed by Travancore Maharajas from the records of Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple. The ritual includes the king entering a large golden jar which had filled with panchagavya (5 cow products) and coming out of it after Brahmins chanting Veda Mantras. Originally, the ritual included construction of large image of Golden Cow , which was later replaced by a Golden Jar. The ritual also included presence of Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, the head of Kerala Brahmins. The most interesting detail however is, after the ritual is performed, the priests would perform Jatakarma and Namakarana of the Maharaja symbolically. The king would then go to a royal cradle and crawl on the floor like a baby.

Only then the Travancore kings were worthy to wear Chera crown and hold the title Kulashekhara Perumal with royal sword in hand. The crown is placed on the head of the Maharaja by Tharanallur Tantri, the chief priest of Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple.

These details leaves no doubt to the fact that the ritual emphasized on ritual rebirth of the King, as twice born Dwija, giving an entirely new birth.
