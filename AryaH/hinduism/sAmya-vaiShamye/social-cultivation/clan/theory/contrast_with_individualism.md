Via MT:

> The moderns have a certain separation from society, and even family. This is why the less thoughtful and less educated among them cannot see from the eyes of the first dharmaśāstrakāra-s in India.
>
> Many moderns, especially those inspired by the western Abrahamosphere, invert the arrow making the individual privilege greater than that of the group. Thus, as that Portuguese thinker noted recently they keep making new laws to safeguard every specialized classes of individuals. The result is a certain paralysis through litigation, agitation and rioting for individual safeguards without concern for the social bonds. This makes the “neo-East India companies” and the super-powerful government even more of a father-figure for them than any Hindu thinker ever conceived the rājan as a father to the prajā. 
>
> Other dimensions of individual privilege manifest in loss of sexual strictures and intemperate recreational substance use (mechanism of shame). The former destabilizes society through depressing fertility and deincentivizing producers, eventually leading high levels of male frustration. These effects are culminating in instability in the Occident that will advantage groups that reject these tendencies for those that promote group stability and growth. In effect it is creating the feared scenario of people without any crafts to train in and produce. These people then provide the ideal cannon fodder for counter-religions, especially those with a culture of keeping longstanding grudges.
>
> This should not be read as a call for Gandhian Ludditism. In fact the break in social organization indicated above is what leads to break in the capacity to produce. A generation trained in rioting and agitation will take over a city but not have any clue of how human waste draining out from the commode is disposed.
