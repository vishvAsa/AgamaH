title: Occupation differences
---


## Intro
- The dvija-s had to compulsorily have appropriate saMskAra-s, and pursue study of sacred lore (adhyayana), yajJNa (sacrifice) and dAna (giving).
- Initially, the professions for livelihood were these:
    - teaching and scholarship in sacred lore, accepting gifts, conducting sacrifices (brAhmaNa-s) 
    - governance and defence (kShatriya-s) 
    - commerce, agriculture, etc.. (vaiShya-s) 
    - service, agriculture etc.. (shUdra-s).
- Effectively partly through later Apaddharmas: Most occupations were open to all jAti-s or varNa-s.
- Consequently, there is difference in AchAra-s.
- The brAhmaNa-s were barred from overt pursuit of wealth. (This was not a mere ideal, but was actually practiced -- as observed by many people, including PV kANe.)
- In contrast with early Arya society, shUdra-s of later times were recognized to have the avocation of service and agriculture.

## Major prohibitions of dvija-s
- Crossing the seas and visiting/ inhabiting kalinga vanga etc.. - See [seas](../seas/) page.
