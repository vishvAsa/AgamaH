## General
- - Division of labor has been observed in nature - most famously in case of insects such as wasps, ants, bees etc.., whose colonies have led to group selection. So, it is plausible that specialization since childhood, and subsequent limitations on social mobility may have provided a competitive edge to early human societies.


## Chimpanzee
- Chimps greet alpha males with this distinctive call, the pat grunt. As a formal signal of submission everybody is going up to greet the big guy... "You are dominant than me, you are tougher than me, I am saying this to you so you won't beat me up... Chimpanzees tell u who is on top&who is on the bottom. Not only do I know that whether I am lower or higher ranking than this guy,I know whether that guy is higher or lower ranking than that guy. So they have a picture in their head of the whole hierarchy"
