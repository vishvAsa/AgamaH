title: Occupation
---

-   He was encouraged to serve a dvija for livelihood; but this was not a compulsion.
    -   Attenuation: There was always the widely used āpad-dharma loophole that enabled him to do something else (essentially the occupation of a vaiśya or a kṣatriya) if he thought that the former occupation cannot meet his needs, or if the country was in disarray.
-   So, ultimately only the occupations of a vedic brāhmaṇa were barred to him.
-   Though he could accumulate wealth, the smṛti-s dissuaded this, on account of pride of wealth and presumed ignorance of the class which might lead to harrassment of brāhmaṇa-s. This dissuasion was by no means a compulsion, and such dissuasion occurs in smṛti-s composed at a time (prior to first century CE) when śūdra-s threatened ārya society [See note by MT [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)]. They were encouraged to spend such wealth for the welfare of all people, and dvija-s in particular (for example through various pūrta activities like constructing waterworks, parks, temples etc.).


## क्षत्रियवृत्तिः
- A śūdra was dissuaded from becoming the ruler of a kingdom in normal times, though broad sections of the śūdra society were considered to have fallen from kṣatriya status.
- Nārada and bhIShma does allow the śūdra to take up the role of a kṣatriya in times of distress.
- Some purāṇa-s declare that in the kali age, śūdra-s will reign.
