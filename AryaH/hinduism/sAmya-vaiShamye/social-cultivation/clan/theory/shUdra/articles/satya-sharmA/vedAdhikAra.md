The well known daṇḍa (punishment) for a Śūdra who learns Veda, mentioned in Gautama Dharmasūtra is instead taken to be a prāyaścitta as per Govindānanda and Ānandagiri in their sub-commentaries on Brahmasūtraśāṅkarabhāṣya (1.3.38). 

Nandapaṇḍita says that it's about hearing Veda directly via 'darpa'. If one keeps a Brāhmaṇa in the middle, there's no fault. He also seems to extend this beyond Śūdras.
