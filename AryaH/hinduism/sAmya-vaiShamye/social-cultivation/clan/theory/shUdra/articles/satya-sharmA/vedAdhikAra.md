## वेद-शब्दः
The well known daṇḍa (punishment) for a Śūdra who learns Veda, mentioned in Gautama Dharmasūtra is instead taken to be a prāyaścitta as per Govindānanda and Ānandagiri in their sub-commentaries on Brahmasūtraśāṅkarabhāṣya (1.3.38). 

Nandapaṇḍita says that it's about hearing Veda directly via 'darpa'. If one keeps a Brāhmaṇa in the middle, there's no fault. He also seems to extend this beyond Śūdras.
Ref: Commentary on Viṣṇusmṛti, 5.23-25


## वेदार्थः
From a manuscript titled 'शिवताण्डवटीका': It says that even the translated versions of Vaidika mantras have power because they convey Vedārtha. Also, the sequence of letters in them is the result of tapasyā of Maharṣi Vyāsa & such others. So they have equal power. Because of differences in sequence of letters, all humans can access them as per their adhikāra.

It seems that the author considers two things as the basis of power of mantras:
1. The meaning of it.
2. The one who expressed it.
