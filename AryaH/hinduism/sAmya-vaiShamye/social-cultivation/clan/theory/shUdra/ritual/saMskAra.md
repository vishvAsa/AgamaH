-   Only non-vedic rites of passage (saṃskāra-s) were permitted by most sūtrakāra-s.
-   As a consequence of not studying the veda-s, there were śūdra-s acquired only one formal āśrama - gṛhastha. So, no upanayana according to most thinkers.
    -   However,  the Baudhayana gṛhyasūtra (2.5.8 and 2.5.9) states the teacher to "[l]et him initiate [to school through Upanayana] a Brahmin in spring, a Kshatriya in summer, a Vaishya in autumn, a Sudra in the rainy season; or all of them in the spring." and clearly allows initiation of shūdra-s.
-   No saṃskāra-s could be performed with vaidika mantra-s. One had to use mantra-s from the purāṇa-s or tantra-s. This was observed in practice (eg. in rites of śivāji's later successors).
-   Furthermore, several śūdra jāti-s had their own rites of passage, which never conflicted with the vedic stream.

## Speacial saMskAra-s
### छुरिकाबन्धनम्
As per some texts, Śūdras underwent a ceremony called Churikābandhana. Śūdrakamalākara mentions a verse which ordains this ceremony in the absence of mauñjī thread in Śūdra Rājaputras. Muhūrtamārtaṇḍa mentions it generally for Śūdras. As per this they were to wear a dagger around the waist.
