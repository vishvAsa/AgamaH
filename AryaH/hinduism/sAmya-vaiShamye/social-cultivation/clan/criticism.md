## Counters to western criticism of the caste system

([FB15](https://www.facebook.com/gregor.maehle/posts/1134184173262307),) There is a fundamental problem here. The assumption that the "caste system" (not as you imagine it, but as it actually existed), was an inferior and immoral social system. This is a claim no one here seems to challenge, by which I presume that they've bought into it.

  

- "Caste system" was not a fair system (in many meanings of the word "fair"). For example, my ancestors were just ineligible to rule a country, or focus on making money. But so is \*your\* current system, and the systems of \*your\* ancestors - they are and were unfair. In the current system, people want to sweep inequalities and hierarchies under the rug - sort of like saying: "there's no prostitution in our country". "My" system, acknowledged what exists naturally, and attempted to regulate and harmonize it.
- Your forefathers' pagan pietas did not survive the onslaught of Abrahamisms (just like the buddhists of Afghanistan and central asia). Mine did very well in comparison. They preserved wonderful practices that everyone enjoys today such as Yoga, meditation, tantra, chanting, dances etc.; while Apollo and Jupiter lie in Roman and Greek ruins.
- Newly encountered tribes were harmoniously brought into the system, while preserving their internal practices and autonomy (not made victims of a vicious genocide).
- There is more than enough points there to argue that, in terms of gross happiness, overall accomplishment and sheer survival, our "caste system" was in no way inferior or wholly immoral.

Furthermore, when circumstances changed and the age turned, we happily changed due to our internal motivation (just as in Japan) - "High" caste people were at the very forefront of this remodeling. Now, they've gradually mechanized the unclean occupations, ridding us of untouchability as well. With mass education and printing, education and literate occupations are more widespread. I now do a shUdra's job for a living ( as a computer programmer).

The fundamental problem here is that you don't seem to have the concept of a harmonious divine order (called Rta), which motivates a sort of refined behavior (called dharma), which seeks to extract order and harmony out of chaos. As time changes, the dharma changes. I am not whitewashing anything here, but am questioning your presumption that the caste system was something disgusting on the whole.
