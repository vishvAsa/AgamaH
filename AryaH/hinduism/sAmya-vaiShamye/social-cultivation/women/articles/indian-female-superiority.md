> Indian Hindu women are still better than most women in world.

Reality is India is a society caught half way between modernity and the old world right now. As of today, a huge percentage of socially conservative young women exist. 20 years ago most if not all Indian women were socially conservative. Now a large percent are not and don't give a ****, in Gen Z. 

My question is - why dont you focus on getting one of the good women and then who cares about the rest of society? You or me cannot change the Zeitgeist, we can just decide our own personal lives
