- Consider shatAvadhAnI-gaNesha's [commentary on the role of women](../http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmlvavD3LSg) in ancient India (esp. compared with contempraneous societies elsewhere). Also see examples [here](../history/persons/).  

## Lower from ritual and mokSha perspective
- Womanhood as a lower status birth (hindu society was patriarchal, as in other contemporary societies)  
- At a ritual and social (rather than family) level, there is no doubt that status of women was lower.  
    - women and shUdra-s are considered by some, barring exempt pUja-s, to be ineligible for saying paurANika mantra-s - japa-s and homa-s are to be conducted through a brAhmaNa \[[DS78](http://imgur.com/a/9bPwr)\].  Agama-s widen this adhikAra.
    
### pApayoni verse
- the bhagavadgItA pApayoni (lowly birth / birth resulting \[ultimately\] from paapa-s/ sins) trope
- Restricted reference to strI shUdra vaishya pApayonis in contrast with brAhmaNas and rAjarShi-s is for rhetorical effect when talking to kShatriya arjuna. \[[YT](https://youtu.be/2XKPJXOvZ_g?t=944)\]
- taittIriya-shAkhA says: "even women with superior knowledge are in effect males, and vice versa." \[[YT](https://youtu.be/2XKPJXOvZ_g?t=1021)\].
- madhva did not say that all strI-s are pApa-yonis - shankara did, as we see below - rAmAnuja did. \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/sB8uCPm.png)\] Though madhva did not comment on the shloka in question, the mAdhva tradition \[[nAgendrAchAryaYT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_fpvtpt90)\] seems to be clear who pApayoni-s are - unfortunate beings who suffer daily - for example those being born in the wrong gendered body.      
- The shloka and commentary by rAmAnuja more or less literally states: "strI-s, shUdras and vaishyas, even (if they are) pApayoni-s can reach me". Some take it to mean that all strI-s, shUdra-s and vaishya-s are pApayoni-s. (But note: ANDAl the incarnation of lakShmI in rAmAnuja's tradition was a woman.) \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/sB8uCPm.png)\]
- The late Dr. N.S. Anantharangachar commenting on rAmAnuja's shrIbhAShya takes it to mean that all strI-s are refererred to as pApayoni-s \[[IMG1](http://imgur.com/a/Bg576) [IMG2](https://i.imgur.com/9NUYa1c.jpg) [IMG3](https://i.imgur.com/Da21zjB.jpg) \].
