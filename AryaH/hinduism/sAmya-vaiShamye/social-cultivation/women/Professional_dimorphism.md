- Female participation in the army.
    - In the era of large armies/ warring class: Sparing participation makes great sense given the importance of wombs. \[[IMG](http://i.imgsafe.org/bb34718889.jpg), \]
        - "Loss of females is a real loss of fitness for the social group, while loss of even a fraction of the males will not change seriously change fitness as long as the number of females are intact. Thus, inter-group conflict is likely to eventually evolve a strong bias towards male only participation, which will be further exacerbated in favor of males when there is strong sexual dimorphism in mean size, speed and strength between the two sexes. ... in mammals, the females bearing small number of live young after prolonged gestation and a clear sexual dimorphism in mean size means soldier-formation will be male-biased. However, in insects of the cockroach clade, wherein termites evolved, the sexual dimorphism generally manifests in the form of bigger females. Thus, the soldier caste in termites shows a clear bias towards females. Similarly, the gene dosage from diploidy, underlying size dimorphism, and relationship bias from haplo-diploidy (sisters being more related than brothers) makes the soldier caste of hymenopterans predominantly female only. There are only rare exceptions where both sexes might participate in soldiering like embryonic soldiers of the the encyrtid wasp Copidosoma and we can explain that." \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-iii/)\]
    - Females are weaker in general than men.
    - Mixed combat units have been shown to be less effective.

## Domains of female dominance

- deva-dAsI-s. Temple dancers with sexual freedom, who produced proud cultural luminaries like singer MS [Subbulakshmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subbulakshmi) and [dancer bAlasarasvatI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasaraswati).
    
    - The old status of deva-dAsI-s is generally not comparable to the modern yellamma cult.
