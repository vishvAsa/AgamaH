## Intro
An incomplete understanding of the spectrum of Hindu ideals leads to many errors. 

## Social level failures
### Poverty
- "Years ago I visited old agraharas in Mysore it was really bad in 1-2 bedroom small house, built during maharaja's time entire family of purohitas lived. One thing I am glad my mother forced me away from full time vedapathashala to secular education early on."

## Individual level failures
### Health loss
- This could be caused by fanatical ritual strictness. This has led to the death of many ritualists.
- rAmAnujan devanAthan died on 7 January 2017 even as he fasted in preparation for shrAddha.
- PV Kane records an incident where jAtakarma was being performed and the child died.
- sAvarkar: "On that particular day, the Hindu prisoners, dead tired with their work, their bodies full of perspiration, and their faces and hands besmeared with coal dust, returned to the spot where these things were being served to them. It was 12 noon and they were very hungry. And what did they find? They found that the Muslim prisoners who had preceded them had already opened the sacks reserved for Hindus and had been making a full meal out of them! These Hindu prisoners belonged to the Thakur caste in Hindusthan, who would not eat the food touched by the Mussulmans. Here were sacks full of grams and parched rice. But they would not touch a particle because the Mohomedans had touched them. The officer in charge of them all was a Mohomedan. And when he saw the Hindu prisoners so starving themselves he burst into a fit of laughter. He did not attend to them, he made no arrangement for their food, and the Mohomedan goondas had their full feast and fun out of it. For they ate their own ration all right, and finished that which the Hindus would not touch. So these had to toil and starve for the whole day without a particle out of the sacks meant for them. The same thing happened to them on the following day. The Muslims had touched two sacks of gram reserved for the Hindus, and the Hindus had to go without food in consequence. The European officers did not bother to know what was happening near them. They would not care and pitied the starving Hindus for such ludicrous nonsense and folly."

### Food
Some southern V1-s give their gurukula brahmachAris left-over rice from the day before for breakfast and pontificate about tAmasik paneer.

### Marriage
- "One of my relatives who continued in vedapthashala later could not find a bride so married a V3 cuz of which being excommunicated from all karmangas by family/friends now working as bus driver!"
- Certain V1-s violate sApiNDya rules by uncle marriages etc. and turn their noses at sagotra vivAha, prefering instead to remain Incels.
