+++

## Practice
- Gazetteer of the Ambala District: 1883 "As regards remarriages of widows the only classes that remarry are Jats Lohárs Jhínwars Tarkháns Mehtams who are allowed by their custom to go through the ceremony of Karewa Among Musalmans with the exception of Saiyads Moghals Pathans Shekhs and Rájpúts all women remarry. Among a the inferior castes who are in short Shúdras when one brother dies the widow is not allowed to go out of the family but is claimed by one of the other of the brothers who look upon her as belonging to the family money having been spent upon her and litigation in the courts both on Civil and Criminal sides to enforce these supposed rights froquently takes place I mention the Criminal as well as Civil Courts since it is not an uncommon matter for a brother to prosecute his sister in law and any second husband she may take for Bigamy because she has failed to transfer her affections to the surviving brother..." 

## Theory
### Generally prohibitted
- manusmRti
  - न दत्त्वा कस्य चित् कन्यां पुनर्दद्याद् विचक्षणः । दत्त्वा पुनः प्रयच्छन् हि प्राप्नोति पुरुषानृतम् ॥ Manusmriti 9.71
  - नान्योत्पन्ना प्रजाऽस्तीह न चाप्यन्यपरिग्रहे। न द्वितीयश्च साध्वीनां क्वचिद भर्तोपदिश्यते ॥ Manusmriti 5.160
  - कामं तु क्षपयेद् देहं पुष्पमूलफलैः शुभैः । न तु नामापि गृह्णीयात् पत्यौ प्रेते परस्य तु ॥ Manusmriti 5.155

### Exceptions
- नष्टे मृते प्रव्रजिते क्लीबे च पतिते पतौ। पञ्चापत्सुचनारीणां पतिरन्यो विधीयते ॥ 
  - When the husband is absconding, dead, has renounced family life, has fallen (morally), or is eunuch, in these five unfortunate circumstances it is prescribed that a woman can choose another husband. (Parasara Smriti 4.30, Also occurs in Narada Smriti 12.97)
- सा चेदक्षतयोनिः स्याद गतप्रत्यागताऽपि वा। पौनर्भवेन भा सा पुनः संस्कारमर्हति ॥ Manusmriti 9.176
  - In case she be still a virgin, or having gone away comes back, she is fit to undergo re-marriage with her second husband.
- उद्वाहितापि या कन्या न चेत्सम्प्राप्तमैथुना। पुनःसंस्कारमर्हेत यथा कन्या तथैव सा॥ Narada Smriti 12.22
  - In case she be a virgin though married, re-marriage is allowed. She is as good as a virgin. (Translation is mine and is not literal. I could not find a good translation of Narada Smriti).
- अद्भिर्वाचा च दत्तायां म्रियेताथो वरो यदि। न च मन्त्रोपनीता स्यात् कुमारी पितुरेव सा॥ यावच्चोदाहृता कन्या मन्त्रैर्यदि न संस्कृता। अन्यस्मै विधिवद्देया यथा कन्या तथैव सा ॥ Vasishtha Smriti 15.64-65
  - If the betrothed of a maiden dies after she has been given away to him by words and water but before she was married with Mantras, she belongs to her father alone. If a maiden has been carried away by force and not married with Mantras, she may be lawfully given away to another man. She is like a maiden.
