- Child marriage is referred to in the distant past, but very rarely.
- Consummation ritual ought to happen on the fourth day of marriage - this indicates that adult marriage was intended. But later practice changed this and introduced a delay. \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/849856736110362624)\]
- Common ages of marriage, classically, were: 20 for men (having completed 12 years of education starting at 8) and about 16 for women.
- Note: It should not be considered inferior to adult marriage out of hand.
