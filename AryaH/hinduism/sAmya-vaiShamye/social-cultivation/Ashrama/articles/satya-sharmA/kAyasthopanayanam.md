In Gāgābhaṭṭa's Kāyasthapaddhati, there's a mention of 3 kinds of Upanayana.

1. For Brāhmaṇa + 2 varṇas, for Dvijatva, Vedādhyayana & Śaucācāraśikṣā.
2. For Anulomas like Mūrdhāvasikta, for Vedādhyayana & Śaucācāraśikṣā.
3. For Cāndrasenīya Kāyasthas, for Śaucācāraśikṣā.

As per this, it is only for the Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya & Vaiśya that the upanayana bestows Dvijatva. For  Cāndrasenīya Kāyasthas and Anulomas like Mūrdhāvasikta etc. &, it doesn't seem to bestow Dvijatva.

Hence, the term 'ekajāti' may not necessarily mean 'anupanīta'.
