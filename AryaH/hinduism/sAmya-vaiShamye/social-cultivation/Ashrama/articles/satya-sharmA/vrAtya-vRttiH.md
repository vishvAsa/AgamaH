Professions suggested for the sons of Vrātya Brāhmaṇas

Kamalākara Bhaṭṭa, Śeṣakṛṣṇa and others tell that the sons of those Brāhmaṇas who haven't received Upanayana should perform Pūjā of Viṣṇu & other deities as a profession. Nṛtya, gīta, playing musical instruments, conch, vīṇā, etc., are also stated as optional professions. 

Along with this, they could compose hymns and legendary stories of Hari & Hara, and sing in Deśabhāṣās as a profession. A screenshot of Bālambhaṭṭi commentary on Mitākṣarā (commentary on Yājñavalkyasmṛti).
