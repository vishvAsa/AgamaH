> While human social structure has slightly diverged in details from that of the chimpanzees, most of its basic features including the **territoriality and territorial defense** with active male role appear to have been inherited from the common ancestor with the troglodyte +++(=chimp)+++. Further, the emergence of **cooperation between males** is likely to be a strong factor in the defense of territories and as Morin et al suggested the data supports that such cooperation is likely to involve a **strong kin-selection** component. Ethnological studies, including philological evidence from texts like the Manusmá¹›ti, point to a role for **group-selection on top of the basic kin-selection** in humans, especially given the subsequent social developments relative to the troglodyte.
