## Reproduction

> It is also well-known that across anthropoid primates there is a ranking of males per social dominance status. This male rank has been shown to be positively correlated to different degrees with reproductive success across the tree of anthropoid primates including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, Hanuman langurs and rhesus macaques. Hence, this would be expected of humans too. Analysis of one of our closest relatives the troglodyte generally supports this (e.g. Male dominance rank and reproductive success in chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii by Wroblewski, Murray, Keele, Schumacher-Stankey, Hahn and Pusey). However, such studies on the chimp also points to some interesting details that might have relevance to Homo. The high-ranked chimp males and their female relatives strongly avoid inbreeding, which might suggest that even in Homo societies some high-ranked males might have sired offspring over a wider range of unrelated females than the average males.

## Male variance and social structure
From [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/the-giants-among-the-lilliputs/):

> Finally, we may go as far as to posit that these features of anthropoid primate societies have gone hand in hand with wide variance in male abilities rather than channeling all males into a tight normal distribution. The wide variance might allow better social structuring, division of labor, and stability within a group to survive in competition with other such groups.

> Moreover, cooperation between males might have gone along with their relatedness which allows for included fitness which lies at the heart of kin-selection. Thus, we might have some convergence towards insect societies with similar social hierarchies, where there is a single or few dominant reproductive members.

> With the dawn of the metal age, technological developments and ability for rapid long-range movements might have actually favored groups with hierarchical social structures with organization of the group around high-ranked males to compete against other such groups. This taken together, with the above considerations, including the possibility of the high-ranked males deliberately avoid matings with close female relatives, might have yielded the super-males whose impact we see on the Y-chromosomal landscape. On the other side this might have also been a factor in origin of our lores concerning the great father and the emergence of a varṇa system constituting a super-organismal puruṣa.
