- Story of uparichara vasu falling from heaven for siding with the deities on animal sacrifice \[[Mbh 12.37](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c037.htm), [Mbh 14.91](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14091.htm)\].
- "Although animal sacrifices were prevalent in the Vedic period, there were already some attempts to reduce this. They came up with the idea that instead of killing an animal, one could offer heartfelt praise to the gods or a fuel-stick or cooked food (see RVS 8.19.5 and 8.24.20 for example). In later times, they even developed an ingenious theory that a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.6.1.3)." \[[SG15](http://indiafacts.org/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/)\]
