‘*Prāptāparādhāḥ*,’—those who have fallen upon, committed, a fault.
‘*Fault*’ means *transgression of morality*; when any such has been
committed by them, they should he beaten.

As a matter of fact, beating is a form of *hurt*, and as such is
forbidden by the general law—‘no living beings shall be injured’; but an
exception to this is made in the case of transgressions by the wife and
other persons.

All these are relative terms; hence the meaning is that the wife is to
be chastised by him whose wife she is, the slave is to be chastised by
him who is his master, and so forth.

What is enjoined here is the method of keeping the persons on the right
path, and not actual beating; so that chastisement may be administered
verbally; and in cases where the fault is serious, there may also be
beating.

In the place of ‘*uterine*’ we should read ‘*younger*,’ and the right
reading would thus be ‘*bhrātā tathānujaḥ*’; since it is the younger
brother that may be chastised by his elder brother, like a child. The
half-brother also is under the tutelage of the elder brother, if the
latter is a duly qualified person; hence he also, if he takes to the
wrong path, should be prevented by all the methods, ending with
*beating*,

‘*Split bamboo*’—the bark of the bamboo. This has been mentioned only as
illustrative of the lotus-fibre and other such objects which cause only
slight pain.—(299)

[*Cf*.
4.164.]

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 271), which explains that
the *younger* ‘brother’ is meant;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
514);—in *Aparārka* (p. 610, and also p. 817);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 572 and 919);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
52);—in *Samskāraratnamālā* (p. 314), which says that the specific
mention of the ‘uterine’ brother indicates that the half-brother shall
not be beaten;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 142), which says
that this beating should be done only when the boy proves intractable to
chiding and other means;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 76).

**(verses 8.299-301)  
**

*Gautama* (2.42-44).—‘As a rule, a pupil shall not be punished
corporally,—if no other course is possible, he may be corrected with a
thin rope or a thin cane; if the teacher strikes him with any other
thing, he should be punished by the King.’

*Āpastamba* (1.8.28-29).—‘If the pupil commits faults, the teacher shall
always reprove him;—frightening, fasting, bathing in cold water and
expulsion from the teacher’s presence are the punishments to be
employed, according to the seriousness of the fault, until the pupil
leaves off the mischief.’

*Yama* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 2.).—‘Wife, son, slave, slave-girl and
pupil,—when these commit a fault, they should be chastised with a rope
or with split bamboo; but in the lower, never in the higher, parts of
the body:—if one strikes them otherwise, he should be punished.’

*Nārada* (*Do*.).—‘If the pupil does not obey the teacher, he should be
chastised, without hurting him, either with a thin rope or with split
bamboo; the teacher shall not beat him much, nor in the head or on the
chest. Behaving otherwise than this, the teacher should be punished by
the King.’
