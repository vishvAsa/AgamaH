- Collection of a skull for chayana during a yAga, described [here](../violence/), could involve killing.
- (Almost) sacrifice of Śunaśśepha by ambarISha.
- shunaskarNa+agniShToma where the yajamAna/patnI sacrifice themselves


## Non-vedic human sacrifice
- For better harvest (Assam 2015) [here](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/india-man-beheaded-suspected-sacrifice-better-harvest-1504156).
- For spiritual and other reasons : \[[TC](http://i.imgur.com/Y3wLB0B.png)\].
