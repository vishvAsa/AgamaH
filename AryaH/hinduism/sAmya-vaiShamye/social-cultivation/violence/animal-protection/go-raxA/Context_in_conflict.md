## Hindu vs Muslim
- The context of hindu-muslim conflict (with the latter using cow slaughter to stick it to the hindus - Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi,  Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer  \[[NG15-B](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-origins-of-beef-consumption-in-india/)\]) makes cow protection a particularly important issue.

## hindu-european conflict
- Dharampal writes in his book “The British Origin of Cow-Slaughter in India”: “‘It can be reasonably assumed that there was very little cow killing after about 1700 AD since the domination of Islam waned and converts to Islam did not take to eating of cow flesh.”
- "This steep increase in the British population (especially of those in the military) in India resulted in many fold increase in cow-slaughtering and beef consumption. Lodha report notes that, in some places, the increase was as high as fourfold. The report further notes that as against 20,000 cows per year that were killed during Islamic rule, around 30,000 cows were killed every year at the height of the British period."  \[[NG15-B](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-origins-of-beef-consumption-in-india/)\]
