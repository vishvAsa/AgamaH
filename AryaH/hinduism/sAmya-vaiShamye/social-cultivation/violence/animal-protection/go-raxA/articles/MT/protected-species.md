> do you think foreign breed cows are also vandanIya to a Hindu?

This is a question of phylogenetic radius akin to that faced in defining biological categories likes species or genus. If the center is an Indian cow then how far does the radius go? Are serially bison, yak, gaur and buffalo fine? What are the rules to resolve it? 

IMO we first go with biology. The buffalo (not what Americans think a buffalo is) & the rest of the bovid TMK don't hybridize. Hence, the buffalo can be placed outside this radius. 

Then we come human social function.

- The saola, the gaur are typically wild & don't perform the same Homo-centric function; likewise with the wild bison. Hence, they might be excluded. 
- However, the yak closer to bison & banteng closer to gaur might still be valid because they are functionally equivalent to the cow.
- Hence, I think the Indian or the non-Indian cows should be considered equivalent in religious contexts.
- In some part of the world that could be extended to yaks, mithuns & bantengs by this criteria if H were to have their place there.
