There is exactly one reality, however there are many mata-s (opinions) and darshana-s (views) about it. Any two darshanas agree in some matters, and disagree on others. 

## Some darshanas
### vaishEShika-s
- The supremely analytical [vaishEShika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisheshika)s of yore, whose system (despite not needing a creator God other than the impersonal "sound"/ energy of the praNava) upheld the [vEda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veda)s as illuminators of dharma (not vice-versa), and who considered [karman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) to be ultimately based on simple physical force acting on paramANus (atoms), are close.

### pUrva-mImAmsa 
- Refs: [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mim%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81). \[[AL06](http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2006-January/015679.html), [Idx](http://www.mimamsa.org/articles/brief_introduction.html)\]

#### Likes:
- their regard for the "eternal" veda-s fits in nicely with viewing them as dharma-manuals for human beings to abide by Rta (the divine order). they reconcile respectability of the smRti-s as being derived from lost veda-s.
- their arthavAda concept, which reduces the tales the ("eternal") veda-s spin (and unrealistic injunctions) to praises or condemnation of dhArmika action. This is important and more widely applicable.
- they appeal to unconscious apurva-s (rather than Ishvara) to deliver fruits of dhArmika actions (esp. yajJNa). since it does not need a creator God.

#### Dislikes
- Text centrism

### Generic vEdAnta 
People might admire particularly the non-ascetic karmayOga part (योगः कर्मसु कौशलं॥, [sAttvika tyAga](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sattvika_tyaga) of karmas).
- shaiva-siddhAnta
    - As presented by abhinavagupta ([LJ14](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/tantra-and-the-teachings-of-abhinavagupta)):

### Religious humanism
An integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that center on human needs, interests, and abilities.

- One might admire parts of it, but dislike cases where it deifies humanity (and not the rest of the universe).
  - On religious atheism, [the Positivist church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_Humanity) and the deification of humanity.
