The way the yantra is integrated into the tAntrika tradition & it origins indeed have a mysterious element to them. Of course prayoga-s can be learnt only from an expert teacher but the self realization comes from a contemplation on the geometry.

I believe the synesthetic linkage of different sensory stimuli is key to perceiving the "Platonic" state of the deity. What I mean by "Platonic" is the idea that there is an "ideal world" which manifests in many copies in the physical world. The god & the various deities of that god are in that ideal realm & their apprehension might need things that are closest reflections of that. We believe the yantra to be one such. 

And siddha's probably seen new yantra-s & bring them into the world by tapping into the ideal world teeming with pure geometric structure from which the laws of the universe are emergent at each level. Like [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/03/13/phantom-impressions-1/) is a geometric structure emerging from simple multiplication tables & integer division, which to the mind prepared by saMskAra might give a religious experience tinged with synesthesia.
