THIS volume contains seventy-one Upanisads, that are not included in the well-known one hundred and eight Upanisads. The Adyar Library has already published all the ninety-eight Minor Upanisads with the com- mentary of Upanisad Brahmayogin. It was felt advisable that these works, which have come down under the name of Upanisads, should be published in the same series. Manuscripts of many of these Upanisads are rare, and very few of them have been printed till now. This edition is based upon the manuscripts that are collected in the Adyar Library. Manuscripts that are collected in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras, have also been consulted wherever possible; I take this opportunity to thank the Curator of that Library for the facilities afforded for such consulta- tion. The manuscripts of the Adyar Library which have beep utilised for this edition are described in the Descriptive Catalogue of the Library prepared by Dr. F. O. Schrader. As this edition has no pretence to being a "critical edition," I do not enter into any minute discussion about the manuscripts and other details. I must confess that some of the Upanisads that

are included in this edition are so very corrupt in the form in which it is presented that they are quite un- intelligible; perhaps some may say that they should not have been printed at all. Since other manuscripts. are not available, I thought I may as well include them in this edition in this form, so that scholars may know that there is such an Upanisad. In printing the Upanisads, the same plan of division has been adopted as in the case of the well-known Minor Upanisads, i.c., the division into Yoga, Samanyavedanta, Vaisnava, Saiva and Sakta. It is hoped that this edition, in spite of all its defects, will be of some interest and use for scholars and students of the history of Hindu religion and thought.
