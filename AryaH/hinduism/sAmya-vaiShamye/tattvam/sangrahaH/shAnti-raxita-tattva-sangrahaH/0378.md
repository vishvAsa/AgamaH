> Things are in ‘perpetual flux then recognition also is impossible; because what has been seen by one person cannot be ‘recognised’ by others.”—(493)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to show the impossibility of ‘Recognition’:—[*see verse 493 above*]

‘Recognition’ consists of the notion that—‘that same object which was seen by me previously is seen by me now’—which includes within itself the two perceptions as pertaining to the same object and the same perceiver—and such ‘Recognition’ cannot be possible if all things were in a ‘perpetual flux’; as under that view, neither one ‘perceiver’ nor one ‘object’ would be there (to be related to both perceptions); for instance, *Viṣṇumitra* does not ‘recognise’ what has been seen by *Devadatta*.

The mention of ‘*one person*’ is only by way of illustration; it is also to be understood that the *object* also which has been seen by one person cannot be ‘recognised’ by another person.—(493)
