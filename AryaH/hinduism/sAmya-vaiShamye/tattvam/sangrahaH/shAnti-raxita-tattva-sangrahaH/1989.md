> “The good points of what is reliable, and the bad points of what is unreliable,—both being beginningless,—are equal only in so far as they are beginningless. for instance, real gold has been in use since time without beginning and end,—so has been unreal gold also; but do the two become equal?”—(3183-3184)

‘*Pramāṇa*, *etc*.’—The compound is to be expounded as—‘the good and bad points of what is Reliable and what is Unreliable’.—(3183-3184)
