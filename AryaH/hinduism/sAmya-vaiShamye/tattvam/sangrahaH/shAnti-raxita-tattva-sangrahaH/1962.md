## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Thus it has been explained that the attempt to prove the *Omniscient* Person on the basis of the knowledge of the epitomised form of things, is superfluous. The *Mīmāṃsaka* now proceeds to point out objections against the idea of the ‘Omniscient Person’, on the basis of his knowing the whole world in detail:—[*see verse 3136 above*]

‘*Mudhā*’—Futile, useless; because it is not conducive to the fulfilment of any purpose of man.

‘*False*’—not true, as envisaging an impossibility.—(3136)
