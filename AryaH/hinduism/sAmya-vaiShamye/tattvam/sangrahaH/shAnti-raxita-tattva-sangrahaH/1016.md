> As a matter of fact, the proving is accomplished by the force of the statement of the three-featured probans; consequently, there can be no suspicion regarding the contrary conclusion; hence the statement of the final conclusion is useless.—(1440)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Nigamana*’, ‘Final Conclusion’ (the fifth member of the five-membered syllogism) has been defined as ‘the Re-statement of the Proposition on the basis of the Statement- of the Probans’ (*Nyāyasūtra* 1.1. 39). What is meant is that when it is re-asserted that “Therefore Sound is non-eternal’,—the word ‘therefore’ implies the potency of the Probans as shown in the Corroborative Instance, and then on the basis thereof, there is reassertion of what had been stated in the *Proposition*;—this re-assertion is called the ‘Final Conclusion’, ‘*Nigamana*’,—the exact connotation of the term ‘*nigamana*’ being *that whereby the Proposition, the Premiss* (*statement of the Probans*), *the Corroborative Instance and the Re-affirmation* are connected, strung together, as serving the same purpose (*Nyāya-bhāṣya*).

As a matter of fact however, when (as shown before) the statement of the *Proposition* itself is not there, how can there be any statement of the *Final Conclusion*, which is only a reiteration of the *Proposition*? Hence the Final Conclusion cannot form part of the Reasoning to prove the conclusion.—On this subject, the Revered Diṅnāga has made the declaration that ‘Inasmuch as the Final Conclusion is a mere repetition, it cannot be the means of proving anything—Against this, *Uddyotakara* and others, under the above *Sūtra*, have argued thus:—“There is no repetition here, because the Proposition states the Probandum as *to be proved*, while the Final Conclusion states it as *proved*; and without the Final Conclusion there can be no *proving*; because until that is stated, the suspicion regarding the truth of the other Factors of the Reasoning does not entirely cease as to whether or not Sound is really non-eternal (for instance); hence for the removal of this suspicion, the Final Conclusion has to be stated separately”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1440 above*]

When it has been definitely ascertained that *in Sound* there is present the character of ‘being a product’, which has been shown to be invariably concomitant with ‘non-eternality’,—how can there be any suspicion of its contrary, ‘Eternality’? When the fact of a certain substance being surrounded by flaming fire has been duly ascertained, no sane man can ever suspect the presence of *coolness* in that substance, [Even if there were any such suspicion ] it could not be set aside merely by the statement of the Final Conclusion, without any reasons.—(1440)
