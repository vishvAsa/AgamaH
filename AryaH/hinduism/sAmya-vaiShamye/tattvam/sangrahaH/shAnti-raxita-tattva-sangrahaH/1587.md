> It has been explained before that even though there is diversity among things, yet they have the inherent capacity of being conceived as one, with certain restrictions.—But even with such conception, there can be one-ness, etc. of the word. What the common man thinks is that there is repeated use of one and the same word.—The relationship also is possible when subsisting in several individuals. Consequently in all cases, there is a multiplicity of words, but they come to be conceived of as one.—(2467-2469)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2133, that—“If the relationship in question were artificial, etc. etc.”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verses 2467-2468 above*]

The meaning of this is easily understood.—(2467-2469)

*Question*:—“Why is it said that it is the *common man* that thinks so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2470-2471 next*]
