> “The ‘cogniser’ who formed the object of ‘I-consciousness’ in the past must be regarded as continuing to exist to-day,—because he is the object of ‘I-consciousness’,—like the cogniser in the present.—Or, he (the present cogniser) must be regarded as haying been the cogniser of yesterday,—because he is the cogniser;—or because of the same reason (of being the object of ‘I-consciousness’),—like the cogniser of yesterday; and all these fulfill the conditions of the probandum.”—(238-239)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“How is it proved that the Soul is eternal?”

The answer is as follows:—[*see verses 238-239 above*]

*He who formed the object of* ‘*I-consciousness*’ *in the past* continues to exist to-day; just like the Cogniser in the present;—and the Cogniser in the present is the object of ‘I-consciousness’;—this is the Reason based up the real state of things.

‘*Or, he*’—i.e. the present Cogniser.—‘*Because of the same reason*’—i.e. because of being the object of ‘I-consciousness’.

This argument has been formulated in reference to the *Cogniser* as the Subject. The Author next proceeds to set forth another argument on the basis of the present *I-notions* as appertaining to the Probandum—*All these, etc*.—‘*all these*’—*I-notions*, of the past and of the present—*fulfil the conditions of the Probandum*,—i.e. come to appertain to the Probandum.—(238-239)

The following *Text* proceeds to show how this is so:—[*see verse 240 next*]
