> As a matter of fact, all cognitions produced by words are expressive of what is unreal; because of the fact that there can be no denotation of the ‘universal’ or of the ‘specific individuality’ and such things; but even though in reality, there is diversity, people, through illusion, come to treat and speak of the word—‘cow’ for instance,—as one only,—regarding all as the same.—This much of what has been said by the great brāhmaṇa (mīmāṃsaka) on the basis of the diversity of words is entirely baseless.—(2614-2616)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *texts* explain the possibility of ‘Denotation’ on the basis of Illusion:—[*see verses 2614-2616 above*]:

That idea is called ‘*Samvṛti*’ (Illusqry) which, by its appearance, *conceals*—‘*samvṛṇoti*’—the real character of another—through not manifesting the real character of the thing; and it is purely ‘fanciful’; hence the form of things that is presented by such an idea is called ‘*Samvṛta*,’ ‘illusory,’ ‘fanciful’.

This is what is meant by ‘*illusory* existence’; it is not *real*; in reality, it does not exist; and all ‘illusory cognition’ is devoid of objective basis.—(2614-2616)
