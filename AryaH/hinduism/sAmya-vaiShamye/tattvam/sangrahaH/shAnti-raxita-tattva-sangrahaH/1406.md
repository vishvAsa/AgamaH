> The objections that have been urged against each of the other two views are applicable to the view that there is embellishment of both. thus it is not possible in any way that there should be any manifester of the sound.—(2168)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* puts forward the objection against the view that ‘there is embellishment of both, Sound and Sense-organ’ (the third alternative view set forth under *Text* 2157):—[*see verse 2168 above*]

‘*To each of the two views*’—that there is embellishment of the Sound and there is embellishment of the Sense-organ. The objections that have been urged against these are applicable to the view that there is embellishment of both.

‘*Thus*, *etc. etc*.’—This sums up the whole criticism (against the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* view).

The following texts set forth the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to the above criticism (set forth in *Texts* 2156 to 2168):—[*see verse 2169 next*]
