> In the case of such things as fire and the like, their powers are dependent upon the efficiency of their own causes, and hence restricted in their operations, and consequently not effective at all times. if it were not so, all effects would come into existence simultaneously,—if in their case also there were no such restriction.—(166-167)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“If this is so, then how is it that the effects of Fire and other things do not come about simultaneously?”

The answer is provided in the following Text:—[*see verses 166-167 above*]

‘*Teṣām*’—of Fire and such things.—The particle ‘*api*’, ‘also’, implies that what is urged is applicable not to the case of ‘God’ *only*,—‘*If there were no such restriction*’,—that is, the restriction due *to the efficiency of their own causes*.—(166-167)
