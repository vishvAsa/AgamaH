> It cannot be so; because, as regards the conception that is beset with afflictions, no such is possible in his case, as all ‘obscuration’ has disappeared from him. while that conception which is favourable to the world’s welfare and hence ‘healthy’,—who would prevent that?—(3598)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Conceptual Content is of two kinds—(I) that which is favourable to troubles, and hence ‘beset with Afflictions’, and (2) that which is favourable to the appearance of ‘freedom from greed’ and such qualities, and hence ‘Healthy’,—Of these that which is ‘beset with Afflictions’ can never be present in persons who have got rid of all obscurations in the shape of the Afflictions,—because the cause of this is not present there; while that which is ‘Healthy’, that is not incompatible with the man who has got rid of the obscurations; hence if this ‘healthy’ Conceptual Content does appear, through the mercy of the Blessed Lord,—as it would be favourable to the welfare of the world and hence ‘healthy’, why should any one object to its appearance?—(3598)
