> Then again, why should he make himself dependent upon that destiny, which is conducive to suffering and pain? in fact, pull of mercy as he is, the right course for him would be to ignore that destiny.—(160)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It may be granted that he is dependent upon the ‘Unseen Force’ (of Destiny). Even so, it is not right for the merciful Being to make himself dependent upon such Destiny—in the form of Merit and Demerit,—as leads to pain and suffering; on the contrary, he should totally disregard such Destiny, if he is influenced (in his activity) by Mercy and Compassion. merciful persons do not seek for such causes as bring about suffering; because the sole motive behind their actions consists in the desire to remove the sufferings of others.—(160)
