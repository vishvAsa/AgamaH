> The validity of the cognition is always asserted in reference to the thing apprehended by it; and this validity being apprehended by another cognition, the former cognition does become ‘cognised’;—and there is no incongruity in this, as the notions of ‘cognition and cognised’ are based upon relativity,—as in the case of ‘cause and effect’ and the like.—(2984-2985)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

When a certain thing is apprehended by a Cognition, this Cognition itself does not become the ‘cognised’ in relation to itself; but in relation to the other Cognition that asserts its validity, it becomes the ‘cognised’,—and is not a ‘Cognition’; hence there is no incongruity or ‘admixture’; just as one and the same thing, spoken of as ‘cause’ and ‘eSect’, in relation to different things, does not make an undue ‘admixture—(2984-2985)
