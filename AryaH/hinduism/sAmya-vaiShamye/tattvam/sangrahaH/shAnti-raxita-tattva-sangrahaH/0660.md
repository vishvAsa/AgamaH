## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The next three *Texts* state the fact of the Buddhist’s Proposition being contrary to experience,—in accordance with the opinion of *Bhāmaha*:—[*see verse 912 above*]

“If the word ‘Cow’ only serves the purpose of denoting the ‘exclusion of others’, then,—as it would be taken up in that,—that term ‘Cow’ could not bring about the idea of the *animal with the dewlap*; hence it would be necessary to seek for some other word which could bring about the notion of ‘Cow’ in regard to the said *animal with the dewlap*.”—(912)
