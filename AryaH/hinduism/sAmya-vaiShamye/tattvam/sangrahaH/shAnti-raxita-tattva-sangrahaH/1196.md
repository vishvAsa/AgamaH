## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As a matter of fact, in the case of everything whether its ‘General’ and ‘Particular’ aspects are emphasised, one after the other or simultaneously, depends upon the wish of the Speaker; so that when one wishes to speak of the ‘existence’ and the ‘non-existence’ aspects of a thing,—or the ‘General’ and ‘Particular’ aspects of it,—simultaneously, he emphasises its form in that way. If he wishes to speak successively, one after the other, of the ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’ aspects, or the ‘General’ and ‘Particular’ aspects—then he emphasises that form. In fact, all its forms are emphasised successively and simultaneously (as one wishes),—just like the Emerald and other gems in a Mass of jewels.

It may be asked—‘Why cannot it be indicated in a way other than successively or simultaneously?’

The answer to that is—‘*There can be no other way*, *etc. etc*.’.—i.e. no way other than ‘successively or simultaneously’.

‘*Vidhi*’—is *way, method*.—(1747)

The following *Text* answers the above arguments (of *Kumārila*):—[*see verse 1748-1749 next*]
