> Then again, in this way what would be proved would be only beginninglessness, not freedom from personal authorship. under the circumstances, if the Veda were regarded as not the work of any person, then the same may be said in regard to other revelations also.—(2796)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The ‘Inconclusiveness’ of the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* reasoning has been shown. The Author now proceeds to show that it is ‘Contradictory’ also, inasmuch as it demolishes what is desired by him—[*see verse 2796 above*]

What the *Mīmāṃsaka* desires to prove is the fact that the Veda is not the work of man; but what is proved by his reason is not this,—but, merely the fact of its being *without beginning*.

It might be argued that—“when it has been proved that it is without beginning, then, by implication it also becomes proved that it is not the work of man; because what is the work of a person cannot be without beginning”.

The answer to this is—“*Under the circumstances*, *etc, etc*.”—That is, on the ground of there being no beginning, if a Revelation were proved to be not the work of man, then the same may be said regarding the customs of the *Pārasīkas* and others (in whose case also, there has been no beginning).—(2796)

The same idea is further explained—[*see verse 2797 next*]
