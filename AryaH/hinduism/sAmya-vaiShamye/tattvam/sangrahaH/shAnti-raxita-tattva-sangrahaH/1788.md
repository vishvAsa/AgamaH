## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“If you have no dispute with us, then, why have you accepted the view that the validity of *Pramāṇas* is *extraneous*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2833 above*]

‘*Apprehended*’—with certainty.

‘*By itself*’—i.e. by the mere presence of the Cognition—by the mere apprehension of things,—irrespectively of the subsequent conformity of its effects.—(2833)
