> “Why should any question or objection be raised against the capacity of things, which is always inferable from its effects? And the only proof for it lies in the fact that the particular effect appears only when the particular capacity is there”.—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 44].—(2172)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—If the *Capacity* is beyond the reach of the Sense-organs,—how then can it be admitted?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2172 above*]

Whether it be the *capacity to manifest*, or the *capacity to embellish*—in all cases, whatever capacity is there can always be inferred from its effects; hence no question or objection can be raised against it.

*Question*:—What is that *effect* which leads to the inference of the *Capacity*?

*Answer*:—‘*And the only proof, etc*. *etc*.’—‘*Tadhhāve*’—when the Articulation is there,—then alone is ‘*tadbhāvitā*’—i.e. the appearance of the effect, in the shape of the cognition of the Sound; this is the only proof for the existence, in the Articulation, of the capacity to manifest the Word-Sound;—that is, from the effect, in the shape of the cognition of Sound, there is inference of the said *capacity*.

‘*Only*’—this is meant to preclude the idea of *production*.—(2172)
