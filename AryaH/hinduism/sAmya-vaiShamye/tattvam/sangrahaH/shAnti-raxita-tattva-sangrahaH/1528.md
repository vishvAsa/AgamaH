> When pulled up by the explanations, the Veda might fall into the wrong path; and in that case, it would not be right to regard the Veda as the ‘eye’ (illuminating things) like the light.—(2375)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Sa*’—stands for the *Veda*.

‘*Tayā*’—stands for the Explanations by men.

‘*Might fall into the wrong path*’—by providing a wrong knowledge of things, expressing things as they are not.

Thus, it cannot be right to say, as has been said (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*)—‘The Veda, like Light, is the one eye for all men, and there should be no objections raised against it’, (*Text* 2351).—(2375)
