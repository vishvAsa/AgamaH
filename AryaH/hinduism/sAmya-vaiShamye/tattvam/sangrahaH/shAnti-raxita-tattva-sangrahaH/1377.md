> “There is a degree of simplicity in the validity of verbal cognition—due to the fact of its not needing a corroborative instance, and to the absence of defects,—which is not found in inference. Consequently, whenever there should be any doubt between verbal cognition and inference, it is verbal cognition that should be regarded as stronger, and the matter determined accordingly.”—(2109-2110).



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Pramāṇatve*’—the Locative is to be construed with ‘*lāghavam*’,

‘*Which is not found, in Inference*’;—because it needs a Corroborative Instance and because defects are possible in it; the defect being that it is annulled by Cognition derived from the *Veda* which is equal in authority to Perception.—(2109-2110)

The other party raises an objection—As a rule that alone is regarded as a ‘Defect’ in argument which is admitted by both parties; in the case in question, Revelation is not a means of valid Cognition, for the Buddhist, who posits only two Means of Cognition (Perception and Inference); then how can there be an ‘annulment’ of Inference by what is not accepted as a Means of Cognition,—so far as the Buddhist is concerned?

The answer to this (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*) is as follows:—[*see verses 2111-2116 next*]
