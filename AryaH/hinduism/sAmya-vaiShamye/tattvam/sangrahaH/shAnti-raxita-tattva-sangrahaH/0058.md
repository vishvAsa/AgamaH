> When a certain thing is definitely recognised, through affirmative and negative concomitance, as the effect of a certain cause, then, the perception of that effect must prove that cause;—such is the standing law.—the ‘peculiar arrangement of parts’ in such diverse things as the body, the mountain and the like however is not an effect of this kind; there is a mere assertion to that effect.—such a reason, when put forward, renders the conclusion open to doubt and denial, as it does when put forward for proving that ‘the anthill is the work of the potter—(63-65)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*The Effect*,—e.g. smoke;—*of a certain came*,—e.g. Fire;—*definitely recognised*,—in regard to Fire, etc.;—*the perception of that effect*—when the effect in the shape of *Smoke* is seen.

“If that is so, then the same may be the case with the matter under dispute also.”

The answer is—*The peculiar arrangement however*, etc.

“If the *peculiar arrangement* is proved by the general assertion, then, it can very well be put forward as the Reason.”

*Answer*—*Such* *a reason*, etc.—*Such*—i.e. based on mere assertion.—*Work* *of the Potter*, etc.;—the reason being ‘the fact of its being a product of Clay’,

Thus then, the conclusion arrived at is that the ‘*peculiar* arrangement’ in question is ‘unproven’, and as for mere ‘arrangement’, that is ‘inconclusive—(63-65)
