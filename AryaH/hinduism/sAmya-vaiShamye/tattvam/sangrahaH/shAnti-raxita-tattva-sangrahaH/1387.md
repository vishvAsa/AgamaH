## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been declared (under *Text* 2131, above) as follows:—‘If the oneness of the Jar, that is urged as an undesirable contingency, is in reference to the Universal aspect, then the argument is superfluous.—If however, one were to urge the contingency of the *Individual* Jars being one, on the strength of the above arguments, then it can be pointed out that such an idea would be contrary to all Forms of Bight Cognition’.—What has been said there is equally applicable to the present case: For instance—If the one-ness urged is in regard to the ‘Universal’ aspect of the ‘ga’ and other letters (composing the word ‘*Gavḥ* then it is superfluous, and so forth, all the rest of it may be repeated. Because in view of the diversity of Place, Time and Speaker, the Individual Letters—*Ga* and the rest are *many*; and it is in these that the ‘Universal’ *Cow* subsists; and in the same way, the *Universal* aspect of the letter ‘*ga*’ is held to subsist in the individual letter; so the two cases are exactly similar in all aspects [and on the same grounds that the individual *jars* cannot all be the same the individual word ‘Cow’, or the individual letter ‘*ga*’, cannot all be the same].

Anticipating this argument, the *Mīmāṃsaka* offers the following answer:—[*see verse 2141 above*]

From Perception, in the shape of *Recognition*, it is proved that the Individuals (letters) are one;—Inference can have no validity, as against Perception; Perception being the highest of all Means of Right Cognition. Such is the sense of the text.—(2141)
