> It is called ‘cognition’ only by virtue of the presence of the nature of ‘consciousness’; and this ‘consciousness’ also consists in the cognition being not-dark which is deduced from its being luminous.—(1849)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“The presence of the nature of Consciousness also is not possible without cognition”;—in answer to this it is added—‘*And this Consciousness*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Sā*’ stands for the presence of the nature of Consciousness;—‘*asya*’—i.e. of the Cognition.—“What is it?”—It consists in the Cognition being *not-dark*; only, on account of there being nothing else to be illumined by it, and also of the absence of any other source of illumination, the Cognition is of the nature of Light itself,—like the Light diffused in the atmosphere and it is by virtue of this *luminosity* that it is called ‘Cognition’.—(1849)
