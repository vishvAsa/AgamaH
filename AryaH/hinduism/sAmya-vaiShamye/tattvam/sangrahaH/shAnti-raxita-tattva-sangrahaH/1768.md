> Because it is dependent upon the teaching of men, and because it has been proved to be the product of effort,—therefore ‘freedom from the speaker’ does not reside in the ‘subject’, nor in the corroborative instance.—(2801)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2346, that—“Please understand that the Vedic word is not false, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2801 above*]

‘*In the Subject or in the Corroborative Instance*,’—i.e. in that which has been mentioned as the ‘Minor Term’, or that which has been cited as the Corroborative Instance—(in the argument put forward by the *Mīmāṃsaka*).—(2801)
