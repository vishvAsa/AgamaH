> The universal and the connection having been already rejected in detail,—the other three kinds of ‘import of words’ no longer remain possible.—(883)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus explained, the impossibility of Convention regarding Specific Individualities, the Author proceeds to explain its impossibility regarding the other three—Universal, Connection of the Universal and That Which is Endowed with the Universal (as mentioned under 871):—[*see verse 883 above*]

‘*The other*’,—i.e. barring ‘Specific Individuality’, the three—(1) the Universal, (2) the Contact of the Universal, and (3) the One Endowed with the Universal.—As regards the Universal and its Connection, these simply do not exist; and hence in regard to *what is endowed with the Universal*, also no Convention can be possible; as all naming is done only in reference to Universals; and that which is so endowed can only exist in the form of Specific Individuality; so that the objections urged against this last are equally applicable to the other also.

The *Universal* forms the denotation of words—says *Kātyāyana*. *Substance* forms the denotation of words,—says *Vyāḍi*.—Both (Universal and Substance) form the denotation of words,—says *Pāṇini*.—All these views become discarded by what has been said above; because the ‘Universal’ can have no connection,—‘Substance’ is of the nature of ‘Specific Individuality’; and hence the objections urged against this latter remain applicable to it.—(883)
