> If the universal ‘blue’, or the quality blue, is denoted by the word ‘blue’, then the word ‘lotus’ (pronounced with that word) should denote another universal ‘lotus’;—such being the case, there would be difference between the two words, just as there is between the words ‘*bakula*’ (a kind of flower) and ‘*utpala*’ (lotus); so that any co-ordination, etc. between them will be all the more impossible.—(1107-1108)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged by the other party:—“The word ‘blue’ does not denote a particular *substance*; it denotes either the *quality* called ‘Blue’ or the Universal ‘Blue’ inhering in that quality; the word ‘lotus’ also denotes the Universal ‘Lotus’, not any particular substance; hence, as the two words denote two different things, it is only right that there should be a need for the word ‘lotus’ (after the utterance of the word ‘blue’).”

The answer to this is as follows—[*see verses 1107-1108 above*]

The compound ‘*anyendīvarajāti*’ is to be taken as a *Karmādhāraya*,—‘*anyā*’ qualifying ‘*indīvarajātiḥ*’.

‘*Vyavaseyā*’—i.e. should be denoted.

‘*Utpalaśruteḥ*’—has the Ablative ending.

Thus under this theory co-ordination would be all the more impossible; since, like the words ‘*bakula*’ and ‘*utpala*’, the words ‘blue’ and ‘lotus’ would not be applicable to the same thing. There can be no such expression as ‘*bakulam utpalam*—(1107-1108)
