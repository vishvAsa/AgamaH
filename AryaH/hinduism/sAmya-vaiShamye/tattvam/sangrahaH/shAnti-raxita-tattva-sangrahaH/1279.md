> In the states of paralysis, etc.,—even though there is change in the body, there is no change in the subjective consciousness; hence this latter cannot be regarded as subsisting in the body.—(1934)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be argued that—“as the Cognition would subsist in the Body, it could not be regarded as *without cause*”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1934 above*]

When the body is struck with diseases like Paralysis, there is modification in it; but that does not make any change in the Subjective Consciousness; hence this Subjective Consciousness cannot be regarded as subsisting in the Body; when one thing does not become directly modified upon the modification of another thing, it cannot be regarded as subsisting in this latter;—e.g. the Horse, which is not modified by the modification of the Cow (does not subsist in the Cow);—on the modification of the Body, Subjective Consciousness does not always and directly become modified, in the state of Paralysis, etc.;—hence there is non-apprehension of the wider character (which implies the absence of the less wide).—(1934)
