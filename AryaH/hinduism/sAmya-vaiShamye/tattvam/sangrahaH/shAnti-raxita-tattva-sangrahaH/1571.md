> Both cases are equally independent of the need of a corroborative instance,—and both are equally free from defects,—because both relate to something- imperceptible.—It might be urged that—‘in the case of the human assertion, its sublation or denial would be suspected, on the ground of its proceeding from a human being’.—If that be so, then in the case of the Vedic assertion also, the said suspicion cannot be entirely absent; it would be considered only natural that it should be the source of false notions.—(2441-2442)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“It is possible that at the time that the human assertion is made, no defect may be found in it; but, as it arises from a human source, the suspicion is always there that it may be false”.

The same may be said of the Veda also. Because *truthfulness* is as natural to it as *falsity*.

Hence there is no difference between the two cases.—(2441-2442)
