> When a thing is neither the one nor the other, its absence does not conclusively preclude the other thing; because there is no connection.—(121)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be argued that—“Even though not invariably concomitant, the Proof (being absent) may yet preclude the existence of the Thing—The answer to this is provided by the following Text:—[*see verse 121 above*]

*Neither the one nor the other*,—i.e. neither the *Cause*, nor *pervasive*;—the absence of what is not invariably concomitant cannot rightly be taken as necessarily precluding the other thing; for if it did, it would lead to an absurdity: the absence of the *Horse* might, in that case, imply the absence of the *Cow* also.—(121)
