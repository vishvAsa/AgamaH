> As regards odour and other qualities (appearing in the jar), the fact of their being causes of each other, as forming factors of the same ‘chain’, is actually admitted (by us); and this idea is not annulled by the alleged anomaly of their being such causes.—(530)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above by the Opponent (under *Text* 486) that—“the Odour and other qualities that appear when the colour of the Jar has been destroyed, etc. etc.”;—but this is not incompatible with the Buddhist’s argument;—this is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 530 above*]

As regards Colour, Taste and other qualities, it is already admitted by us that as forming part of the same ‘chain’ they are auxiliary causes of each other; as has been thus declared—‘Without the action of Potency, there is no Cause of Taste; this is the only explanation of all past qualities that have existed at the same time, which is derived from the indications of their Effects’,—(530)
