> “When a man returns from bright light into an inner room, things do not manifest themselves to him immediately upon his entrance; but that does not mean that later on he does not perceive those things by his sense-organs.”—(Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 126).—(1290)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged (against *Kumārila*):—If, at the first operation of the Sense-organ concerned, the Thing does not appear as equipped with all its properties in the shape of the Universal and the rest,—then, it should not so appear even subsequently; as the circumstances are the same in both cases.

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 1290 above*]

‘*Uṣṇāt*’—i.e. from bright light.

The construction is ‘*uṣṇāt praviṣṭamnātrāṇām*’, ‘who have just come in from bright light’.

‘He *does not perceive*, *etc. etc*.’—The particular intonation implies that things are actually apprehended by the sense-organs.—(1290)

Having thus cited the Example, he applies the same idea to the case in question:—[*see verse 1291 next*]
