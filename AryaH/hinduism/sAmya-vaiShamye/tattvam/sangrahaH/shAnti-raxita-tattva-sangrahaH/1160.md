> The idea of ‘negation’ being an entity having been previously accepted, why is it described to be featureless?—(1678)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *text* points out defects in the third definition of ‘Negation’ put forward—that it consists merely in the *absence of Means of Cognition*:—[*see verse 1678 above*]

‘*Previously accepted*’—in the assertion that ‘Negation consists in the non-modification of the Soul or in the cognition of something else’ (*Text* 1649).

‘*Featureless*’,—It has been asserted (by *Kumārila*, see under Text 1657) that—“Just as the cognisable Object is negative, so should the Means of cognition also be understood to be”; from which it is clear that the Means or Form of Cognition consists in the apprehension of the Object; hence it cannot be right to attribute the character of ‘Means or Form of Cognition’ to what is entirely featureless; this is what is meant; and this same idea is going to be put forward again (in the following *Text*).—(1678)

This same idea is further explained—[*see verse 1679 next*]
