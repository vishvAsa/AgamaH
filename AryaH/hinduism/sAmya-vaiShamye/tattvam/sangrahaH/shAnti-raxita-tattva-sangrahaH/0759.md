> The said ‘exclusions’ of things, created by mere assumption, cannot really differ, through difference in the ‘excluded things’, or through that in the substratum.—(1046)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In regard to what has been asserted (under *Text* 928, as coming from the *Bauddha*), the Author says:—[*see verse 1046 above*]

If the diversity in the *Apoha* were held (by us) to be real and based upon the diversity of ‘excluded things’, or upon the diversity of the ‘substratum’,—then the objection urged would have been applicable. As a matter of fact, however, the ‘Exclusions’ are *not real*, but assumed on the basis of the diversity among like and unlike things.—(1046)
