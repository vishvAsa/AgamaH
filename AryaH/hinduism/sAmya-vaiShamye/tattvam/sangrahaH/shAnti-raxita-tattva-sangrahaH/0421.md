> The followers of Akṣapāda (Gautama, *naiyāyikas*) and of Kaṇāda (*vaiśeṣikas*) have asserted, solely on the strength of verbal authority, that—“the theory of the universal and such things being formless, set forth previously—cannot be right; because the six categories of ‘sub stance’ and the rest do really exist”.—Hence the refutation of these, substance and the rest, is briefly set forth here.—(547-548)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Introductory verses have spoken of the Doctrine of ‘Intervolved Chain of Causation’ as ‘free from such limiting conditions as those of *Quality*, *Substance*, *Action*, *Universal*, *Inherence* and so forth In support of this the Author proceeds to examine the ‘six categories’ (of the *Vaiśeṣikas*); tills examination is what is introduced in the following:—[*see verses 547-548 above*]

“In one of the earlier chapters, that on the ‘Permanence of Things’ (Chapter VIII), it has been asserted (by the Buddhist) that ‘the Universal and such concepts being *formless*, the momentary character is not attributed to them’ (*Text* 740).—This cannot be right; because the six categories of *Substance*, *Quality*, *Action*, *Universal*, *Ultimate Individuality* and *Inherence* do really exist”;—so say *the followers of Akṣapāda* and others. *Naiyāyikas* have been called ‘*Ākṣapāda*’ because they are the disciples, followers, of *Akṣapāda*; and similarly the *followers of Kaṇāda*, the *Vaiśeṣikas*, have been called ‘*Kāṇāda*’.

‘*Solely on the strength of verbal authority*’;—i.e. they are dependent upon Verbal Authority only, totally devoid of reason.—(547-548)
