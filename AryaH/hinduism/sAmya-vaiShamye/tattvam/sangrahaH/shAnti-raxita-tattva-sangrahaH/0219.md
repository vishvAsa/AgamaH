> As a matter of fact, when there is transference of one form to something, there can be no transference of another form. so that if the states became transferred (merged into the soul) in their own form, then the soul also would be something liable to origination.—(271)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, the transference (mergence) of Happiness and other States into the Soul could be possible only in their own forms; and in that case, like Unhappiness and the other States, the Soul also, being non-different from them, would be something *liable to origination*,—capable of being produced.—(271)
