> That the said idea (of the simultaneity or the other conceptual content and the cognition) [cannot] be wrong has just been made clear. and this same simultaneity between the object and the cognition is also quite clear for that same reason.—(1249)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that the idea of the simultaneous appearance of the two cognitions is entirely mistaken:—[*see verse 1249 above*]

‘It *cannot* be wrong’—such is to be the construction along with what has gone before.

*Its idea*—i.e. the idea of the two appearing at one and the same time.

As a matter of fact, an idea is regarded as *wrong* when it is annulled by a valid cognition to the contrary; in the present case there is no such cognition to the contrary, by virtue of which the idea in question could be regarded as *wrong*.

“How do you know that there is no such cognition to the contrary?”

*Answer:—This has just been made clear*;—that the cognition of the object before the man’s eyes appears at the same time as the mind is attracted by something else—is clearly perceived; and it is this cognition that is called ‘Sense-perception’;—wherefore then is there anything wrong in this?—(1249)

It is not only that there is nothing to prove that the idea of the said simultaneity *is wrong,—in* fact, there is proof to the contrary (to show that it is *not wrong*). This is what is shown in the following—[*see verses 1250-1253 next*]
