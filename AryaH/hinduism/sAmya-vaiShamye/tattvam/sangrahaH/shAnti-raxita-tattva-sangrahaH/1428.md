> “Just as, in connection with the visual organ, it is asserted ‘may his eye revert to the sun’,—which conveys the idea that the visual organ has its origin in light,—so, in the same manner, the auditory organ consists in space.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 151-152].—(2200)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Just as in the ease of the sentence ‘May his Eye revert to the Sun’ what is asserted is the idea that the Visual Organ has its origin in Light—the term ‘*cakṣuṣaḥ*’ has to be supplied;—in the same manner, what the sentence ‘may the Ear revert to Space’ asserts is the idea of the Auditory Organ having its origin in, and consisting in, Space.—The words are to be construed in this way.

‘The idea of Light being the origin’—i.e. the idea of the Visual Organ consisting of Light.—(2200)

*Question*:—What is this ‘Space’ like?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2201 next*]
