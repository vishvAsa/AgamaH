> It has been already explained that the idea of falsity of the cognition being ‘due to the presence of sublating cognitions and to the cognition of its source being defective’ involves infinite regress. Hence the falsity (invalidity) cannot be recognised merely on the basis of the said cognitions.—(3101)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 2914, that—“It is only when there appears the Cognition of the truth being otherwise that the falsity of a Cognition becomes recognised”.
