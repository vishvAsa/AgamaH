> Those things that are qualified by the exclusion of other things,—either as their cause or their instruments—are definitely cognised as not mixed up with things of other kinds. The word expresses these things. and, because it brings about the cognition apprehending those things, there is denial of the ‘universal’ and such other commonalities.—(1069-1070)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Things are of two kinds—*external* and *imposed upon the Cognition*; in regard to the external thing, there is no denotation by words; and it is only on account of words bringing about the conceptual content pertaining to them that it is said, figuratively, that ‘the word denotes things’; and the purpose served by such figurative expression is the denial of the denotation of the Universal\* Such is the meaning of the Texts as a whole.

The meaning of the words is explained:—‘*By the exclusion of other things*’;—i.e. by differentiation from other things;—this differentiation being either the Cause or the Instrument,—the *Tree* and other things are definitely Cognised as qualified; that is they are definitely differentiated from other things. This shows that in the compound ‘*arthāntaranivṛttiviśiṣṭān*’, the term ‘*nivṛtti*’ is to be construed as with the Instrumental Ending.

‘*Dhvāna*’ is *Word*.—(1069-1070)
