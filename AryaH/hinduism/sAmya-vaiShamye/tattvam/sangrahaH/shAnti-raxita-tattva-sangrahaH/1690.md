## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus summed up the ‘Inconclusiveness’ of Presumption, the Author now sums up the argument to the contrary, annulling that Presumption:—[*see verse 2667* *above*]

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.

‘*Nityasambandhayoginaḥ*’—to be construed with ‘*na*’.

The formulation of this argument has been presented before.—(2667)
