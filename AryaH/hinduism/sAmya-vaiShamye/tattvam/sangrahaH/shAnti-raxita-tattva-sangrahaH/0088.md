> The theistic Sāṃkhya may argue as follows:—“it is a well-established pact that primordial matter is triple in its essence;—when the supreme lord comes into contact with the manifested *rajas*-aspect (energy), he becomes the cause of creation;—when again, he has recourse to the manifested *sattva*-aspect (harmony), then he becomes the cause of the subsistence of the world;—when he comes into contact with the manifestly operative *tamas*-aspect (inertia), then he brings about the dissolution of the entire world. thus the attributes of harmony, energy and the rest are his auxiliaries, and these become operative only consecutively; that is why there is no absence of consecutiveness (i.e. simultaneity) of products.”—(97-100)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

With the following Text, the Author proceeds to point out, from the standpoint of the Opponent, the inadmissibility (*unproven*character) of the Reason put forward above (under 87), to the effect that ‘when the Cause is present in its complete form, the Effect must appear as a matter of course, just as it is found in the case of the Sprout, etc. etc.’:—[*see verse 97-100 above*]

“Even though these two Causes (Primordial Matter and God) are constantly present together, yet the various products will come into existence only consecutively, one after the other; because the three Attributes of Primordial Matter,—*Sattva*and the rest,—are the auxiliaries of God; and as these Attributes function only consecutively, there is bound to be consecutiveness in the Products also. For instance, when God becomes affected by the operative*Rajas-attribute*, He becomes the Creator of creatures, as the*Rajas*-*attribute*is conducive to*production*;—when however, He has recourse to the operative*Sattva-attribute*, then He becomes the Cause of the continued existence of the worlds, because the*Sattva-attribute*is conducive to*subsistence*when He comes into contact with the operative*Tamos-attribute*, then He brings about the*dissolution*—destruction—of*the entire World*; as the*Tamas-attribute*is conducive to*mergence*(dissolution).—This process has been thus described (by Bāṇa-Bhaṭṭa in the opening verse of his*Kādambarī*):—‘He who has recourse to*Rajas*at the birth of creatures, to*Sattva*during their existence, and to*Tamas*at their dissolution,—who is unborn, and controls the birth, existence and destruction, who consists of the*Three Vedas*, the very essence of the Three Attributes,—to Him obeisance!’

“The particle ‘*Kila*’ (in Text 99) is meant to indicate*improbability*(of any complete Dissolution).”—(97-100)

The answer to the above is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 101-102 next*]
