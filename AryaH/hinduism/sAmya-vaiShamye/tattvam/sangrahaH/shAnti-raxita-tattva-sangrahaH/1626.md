> Even though in some cases, there may be illusion of simultaneity due to quickness of appearance,—yet that has nothing to do with the present context; because here the air is not cognised at all.—(2533)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been explained already that the idea of simultaneous cognitions is due to the illusion caused by the quickness with which the cognitions appear. It may be that in the case of Cognitions appearing in succession there may be an illusion of simultaneity due to the quickness with which they appear; but in the present discussion, the said explanation is of no use; hence it is nothing.—This is what is asserted in the following:—[*see verse 2533 above*]

It may be that, on account of the quickness in the appearance of the Cognitions, there is an illusion of simultaneity. But this cannot apply to the case where there is no perception of a thing which is quite perceptible. For instance, in the present context, there is absolutely no cognition—either successive or simultaneous—of the Air that has reached the regions of the Auditory Organ. Hence the explanation that “the illusion of simultaneity of Cognitions is due to the quickness with which they appear” can have no bearing on the present discussion; i.e. it should be ignored.—(2533)
