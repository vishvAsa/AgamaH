> The perceptibility (or potency) being thus established,—all that has been said (by the other party) regarding its not being cognisable by inference, does not affect us. because in this case we do not regard the cognition to be of the nature of inference.—(1615)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, it has been declared (by *Kumārila*, see above under *Text* 1589) that “Potencies of all Things become cognised through Presumption” and so forth; where it has been shown that Potencies cannot be *inferred*. That does not affect our position at all.—“Why?”—Because *in this case*—of Potency being *perceptible*—*we do not regard the cognition to be of the nature of Inference*; for the simple reason that Inference consists of the cognition of only such things as are not cognisable by Perception.

This shows that the arguments adduced are superfluous.—(1615)
