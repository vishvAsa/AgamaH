> “even though the substratum is not-eternal, its non-eternality would not be of the nature of momentariness”;—if this is urged, then (the answer is that), inasmuch as no additional properties could be produced in it, deafness, etc. would not be possible.—(2549)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[Says the other party]—“If such is the case, then the substratum being not-eternal, the embellishment could be of that, and through that the Auditory Organ also, though eternal, would come to be influenced”.

This is the idea set forth and answered in the following:—[*see verse 2549 above*]

‘*If it is non-eternal*’—as its destruction would be sure to come in course of time,—till that time, it would continue to have one and the same form; and hence, as in the eternal thing, so here also no additional properties would appear in it; how then, could there be any ‘embellishment’ of it?—(2549)
