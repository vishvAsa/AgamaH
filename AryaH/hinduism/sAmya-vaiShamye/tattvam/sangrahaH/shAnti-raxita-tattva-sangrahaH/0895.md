> Or, the term ‘*viśeṣaṇa*’ [‘qualifying adjunct’, as occurring in the passage quoted from the Nyāyamukha, on p. 372, bottom] may be taken as standing for ‘differentiation’, ‘exclusion—by virtue of which words bring about the ‘Apoha, exclusion, of others’; [it is called ‘differentiation’] because it does the differentiating (or excluding) of the universal, etc.—(1238)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the compound ‘*viśeṣaṇābhidhāyakābhedopacāra*’ (in the passage quoted from the *Nyāyamukha*, in the commentary of Text 1237), the term ‘*viśeṣaṇa*’ stands for *differentiation*, i.e. *exclusion*;—and the Word is the ‘*abhidhāyaka*’, denoter, of this *Exclusion*, not of *Universal*, etc.; and there is ‘imposition of the identity’ of this; in this way is the compound to be explained.—(1238)
