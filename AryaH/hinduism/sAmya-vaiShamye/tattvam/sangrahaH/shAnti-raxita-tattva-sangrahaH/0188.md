> “The notion of ‘I’ involved in the conception ‘I know’ envisages the cogniser; this cogniser may be either the ‘soul’ or the absolutely evanescent ‘cognition’ (idea). If it is the ‘soul’ that is the objective of that notion, then all is square; on the other hand, if the momentary ‘cognition’ (idea) is held to be so, then all becomes inexplicably confounded. For instance, the notion that appears in the form ‘it was I who cognised this thing on a previous occasion, and it is I who am cognising it now’,—of this notion, what ‘cognitive moment’ is assumed to be the objective? would such a ‘moment’ be (a) past, or (b) present, or (c) in the form of a continued series? if it be the first (a), the moment could well be the objective of the notion ‘I cognised it (in the past)’; but it could not be the objective of the notion ‘I am cognising it (now)’, because the cogniser is not cognising the thing at the moment of speaking; it is only when the object is present at the time (of cognition) that it can be spoken of as ‘I am cognising it but (in regard to such a present object) it would not be true to say ‘I cognised it’, because the object did not exist in the past.—From this it follows that both of these (past and present) cannot form the objective of the said notion. Nor did both ‘cognitive moments’ cognise the thing in the past; nor do they both cognise it in the present.—(c) Nor can the ‘series’ be regarded as the ‘cognised object’, as both are impossible; the ‘series’ could not cognise it in the past; and as it is not an entity, it cannot cognise in the present.—For all these reasons, it is established that that wherein ‘I-consciousness’ subsists,—which must be something distinct from the said cognition,—is the ‘soul’ of the eternal form.”—(229-237)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—How do these two conclusions follow from the fact of Recognition?

The answer is as follows:—[*see verses 229-237 above*]

*That the conception* ‘*I know*’ *envisages the Cogniser*,—is beyond all dispute; as the verb ‘I know’ connotes the notion of the person who does the *cognising*. Now in regard to this *Cogniser*, there are two theories possible: (1) that it is the ‘Soul’, or (2) the absolutely evanescent Cognition (Idea) as postulated by you (Buddhists).—If the theory that ‘it is the Soul’ be accepted *then all becomes square*, as it accomplishes what is desired. If, on the other hand, the other view is accepted—that it is the *Idea*, then all becomes extremely inexplicable. Because, the conception appears in the form ‘I cognised this in the past and I am cognising it in the present’, and herein there is a clear conception, the notion of ‘I’ being the Cogniser in both cases;—of this conception of ‘I’, if the ‘Cognitive Moment’ be assumed to be the object, would this ‘moment’ be (*a*) past, or (*b*) present, or (*c*) both present and past, or (*d*) in the form of a continued series? There are these four possible alternatives.—Now as regards (*a*), the *past* ‘moment’ being assumed as the object of the notion of ‘I’, the idea that ‘I cognised’ might be all right, as the thing had been cognised in the past; but the idea that ‘I am cognising it now’ could not be true, because the *past* ‘Cognitive Moment’ does not cognise the thing at the present time,—as *ex-hypothesi* it has already disappeared.—(*b*) If the second alternative is accepted that the *present* ‘Cognitive Moment’ is the object of the notion of ‘I’, then the idea that ‘I am cognising’ would be all right, as it is really the Cogniser at the present moment; but the idea that ‘I knew it in the past’ would not be true,—why?—because it did not exist at the previous time. The word ‘*idam*’ (in the Text) stands for the *present* Cognition. Thus then, inasmuch as the conception operates both ways, it becomes established that the present and the past, both, Cognitive Moments cannot form the object of the notion of ‘I’; as both these ‘Cognitive Moments’ did not cognise the thing in the past, nor do they cognise it in the present; as a matter of fact, one ‘Moment’ cognised it in the past, and another ‘Moment’ is cognising it in the present.

For the same reason the ‘Series’ also cannot form the object of the notion of ‘I’; as both—the past and the present acts of cognition—are impossible. Because this ‘Series’ did not cognise the thing in the past, nor does it cognise it in the present; because being only ‘conceptual’, it is not a *thing*, an entity; and what is not an *entity* cannot be the *Cogniser*, as *being a Cogniser* is a property that can belong only to an entity.

From all this it follows that, that thing wherein the notion of ‘I’ (I-conscionsness) subsists,—and as shown above, it must be something distinct from the said Cognition,—is the *Soul*.—(229-237)
