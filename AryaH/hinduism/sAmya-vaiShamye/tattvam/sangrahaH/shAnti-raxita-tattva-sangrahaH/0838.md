> ‘The exclusion of others’ is clearly understood in the case of the meaning of a sentence. it is only the denotations of certain words construed together that is spoken of as ‘the meaning of the sentence’; what would be ‘excluded’ by these words would clearly be the things different from those denoted by these words; so that the same would be ‘excluded’ by the meaning of the sentence also. Because the meaning of the sentence is nothing apart from the meanings of the words (composing it).—(1160-1161)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under Text 978, by *Kumārila*) that—“In the case of the meaning of the Sentence, ‘exclusion of other things’ cannot be indicated”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1160-1161 above*]

‘*Construed together*’—Related, as cause and effect.

‘*Things excluded*’—by the words.

*Objection*:—“The *denotation of words* is one thing, and totally different from that is the *meaning of the Sentence*; why then is it said that what are ‘excluded’ by the denotation of the words would also be ‘excluded’ by the meaning of the sentence?”

*Answer*:—‘*It is nothing apart from that*’;—the *meaning of the sentence* is not anything different from the denotations of the words,—in the shape of something of a mixed character, like the colour of the *Kalmāṣa*; because such a thing, if it existed, would be perceived, and yet it is not perceived.—(1160-1161)

This same idea is made clearer by means of an Example:—[*see verse 1162 next*]
