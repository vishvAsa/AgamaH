> If, the idea of what is expressed by the sentence is admitted as emanating from the other person, or as brought about by another means of cognition,—then the cognition of what is expressed by the later sentence may be regarded as following from that.—(1622)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In order to avoid the incongruity urged above, it might be said that the dependence of what is expressed by the first sentence is also admitted,—as emanating from the other person (who has asserted that ‘the fat Devadatta does not eat during the day’) who is known to be reliable;—or as brought about by another Means of Cognition—Perception, etc.—whereby it is known that the fat Devadatta does not eat during the day.

The answer to this is—‘*Then the cognition*, *etc. etc*.’—That is, the cognition of the fact itself (expressed by the second sentence) might follow from that fact (expressed by the first sentence)—i.e, from *fatness along with not eating in the day*; and there need be no indication of the *sentence* in the mind. And in that case, the cognition would become included under *Inference*, and hence Presumption need not be a separate means of Cognition.—(1622)
