> “In fact, cognition is the fruit of words; and no single word can have two fruits. how too could both affirmation and negation be the fruit of any one word?”—(913)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be said (by the other party) that—“one and the same word ‘Cow’ would bring about both the notions, and hence the second word need not be sought after”—To this, *Bhāmaha* makes the following reply:—[*see verse 913 above*]

“Words have for their fruit the cognition of affirmation and of negation.—‘What then?—*No single word can have two fruits*; of any one word,—be it affirmative or negative,—there cannot be two fruits appearing at one and the same time; that is, no such is ever found.—Nor again is it possible for mutually contradictory cognitions of affirmation and negation to be the fruit of a single word.”—(913)
