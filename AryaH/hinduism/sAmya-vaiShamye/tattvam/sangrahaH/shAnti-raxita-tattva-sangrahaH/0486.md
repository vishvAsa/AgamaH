> If in a large substance, the blue colour is held to be one only,—then how is it that there is no manifestation and perception of it when it is seen in light coming through an aperture?—(636)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Qualities are perceptible only when they subsist in a large substance; that is why the *Text* has added the epithet ‘*large*’.

If it is held that the *Blue Colour*,—in all its four forms,—that subsists in a Large Substance is one only and without parts,—then, at the time that there is manifestation of the Blue Colour as subsisting in a large substance like the Jar placed in a small room, through lamp-light coming through an aperture in the split bamboo or some such thing,—the whole of the Blue Colour subsisting in the whole Jar should be manifested and perceived because it has no parts; as a single entity cannot have parts, by virtue of which there would be manifestation of one part only.

‘*Light coming through an aperture*’ has been, mentioned only by way of illustration.

Similarly when odour in a part of the Earth is manifested by Water, the odour in other parts of it also should become manifested and perceived.

Similarly in the case of Flames and the Mango and other fruits,—the Touching and Tasting of one part should lead to the perception of the Touch and Taste subsisting in the whole of those substances.—(636)
