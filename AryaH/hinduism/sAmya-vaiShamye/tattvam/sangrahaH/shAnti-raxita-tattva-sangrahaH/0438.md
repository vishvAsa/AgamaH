> As a matter of fact, such things as the red dye and the saffron produce a new colour in the cloth, on the destruction of the previous colour; because the cloth itself is momentary (and its previous colour has perished along with it).—(568)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Another example cited (by the Opponent) is the notion of the ‘cloth’ in reference to the *Bed Cloth*.—The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 568 above*]

What happens in the case cited is that the Cloth itself being momentary, its previous White Colour is destroyed, and a new Colour comes into existence through other causal conditions; and when this new Colour is perceived, there appears, on the wake of that Perception, the reflective notion pertaining to the aggregate—as ‘the Cloth, the Cloth’—with appropriate distinction; and this notion (of the ‘Cloth’) is purely illusory, without a real object. Thus the Cognition cited is not of the nature of *Perception* at all.

Nor is it *Inference*; as its object is one that has been already apprehended by a previous Perception, and also because it is not a Cognition brought about by means of an Inferential Indicative.

Thus in the case cited there is no Colour that has been suppressed.—(568)
