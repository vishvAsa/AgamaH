> “If an entity were not-equal to (entirely different from) other entities, then it would not differ from the ‘sky-flower’. On the other hand, if it were entirely devoid of non-equality (difference), then it could not be regarded as anything different from those things—(1710)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

For proving the *General* and *Particular* character of things, *Āhrīka* has formulated the following arguments in due order:—[*see verse 1710 above*]

“If a certain thing spoken of—the Jar, for instance,—were *not-equal to* (i.e. different from) all other things,—such as the Cloth and the like,—i.e. if it were always excluded (differentiated) from these,—then there would be no difference between the Jar and the ‘Sky-flower’; as it would be always differentiated from all other things; and a thing that is always differentiated from all other things can have no other state save that of the ‘sky-flower’, Consequently, one who is not willing to admit the equality of that thing to the ‘sky-flower’, must admit that it is equal (similar) to other entities, in *being an entity*; hence this general character (commonalty), in the shape of the universal ‘entity’, has to be admitted.

It may be asked—“In what way then is there the *Particular*?”

The answer is—‘*If it were entirely devoid of non-equality*, *then it could not be regarded as different from those things*.—If that same entity, Jar, were devoid of non-equality to other things like the Cloth,—i.e. if it were not *non-equal* to them,—then the Jar could not be regarded as any thing different from the Cloth, etc., in the form—‘This is *Jar*, that is Cloth’; just like the specific individuality of things;—and yet, as a matter of fact, it does differ from other things; hence it becomes established that it has the *Particular* character also.—(1710)
