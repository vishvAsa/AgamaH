> “There should not be any such question as to the form in which the embellishment is made; as that question can be similarly raised in the case of the production (of the word, in the ear); as in that case also, the capacity (of the things concerned) is beyond sense-perception.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 43].—(2171)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent:—It has to be explained in what, way the Articulation brings about the embellishment of the Auditory Organ, which is an accomplished entity.

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2171 above*]

‘*That question can be, etc*. *etc*.’—The said question can be raised, with equal reason, in regard to the view that ‘there is production of Sound in the Ear’, Under the view that Sound is *produced* (not *manifested*) by its causes, the said question could be raised,—‘in what form does the *Articulation*, which consists in Conjunctions and Disjunctions of Air,—or any other cause—*produce* the Sound?’—Because in that case also,—i.e. in the case of the *production* of Sounds being brought about,—the capacity of the causes of the Sounds would be beyond the reach of Sense-perception; and so it is in the case of the view that Sounds are *manifested* (not *produced*), So the question can be raised, with equal reason, in regard to both the views.—(2171)
