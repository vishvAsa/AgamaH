> “As a matter of fact, no scriptural text to this effect can be found; but if such an assertion were eternal, then it could be only commendatory; and if it really spoke of a person, then it would be not-eternal.”—(3517)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*To this effect*’—i.e. speaking of the Omniscient Person.

*Question*:—“Why cannot it be found?”

*Answer*:—‘*If* *it is eternal, etc. etc*.’—If the scriptural text speaking of the Omniscient Person is *eternal*, then it must be purely commendatory,—so that it must be taken as really having an entirely different meaning. If it is not held to be merely commendatory, then it must be *non-eternal*.—(3517)

*Question*:—Why should it be *commendatory*, if eternal?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3518 next*]
