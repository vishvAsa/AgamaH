> “In the matter of one matter, of arithmetic for instance.—all beings—Jina, Buddha and others,—are found to be truthful; and no distinction is found among them.”—(3150)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—Whan the Word of any one has been found to be true to facts,—it is that same person in regard to whom it is inferred that his words relating to all things would be in keeping with reality.

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3150 above*]

The words of all men,—*Jina*, *Buddha*, and others,—are found, in the one matter of Arithmetic,—to be true, quite in keeping with the real state of things; in fact, when people speak of a lot of things, it is not possible that not one should be true; as has been declared in the following words—‘When a man talks a lot, it cannot be that not a single word is true’,—Thus then, the reason being equally present, in all cases, no difference can be recognised among men, and all should be regarded as omniscient.—This however cannot be true, because they have propounded mutually contradictory teachings,—as already pointed out above.—(3150)
