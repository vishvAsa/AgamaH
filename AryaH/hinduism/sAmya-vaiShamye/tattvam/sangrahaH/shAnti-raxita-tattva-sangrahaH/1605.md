> This word-sound being of the nature of what is apprehended by its cognition,—in. Whatsoever form it continues to exist [and it exists for all time, ex-hypothesi] as ‘word-sound’,—the said cognition also will have to continue along with it,—under your theory [by which apprehensibility by that cognition forms the very nature of the word-sound];—otherwise it could not be continuing along with the cognition. And by that same cognition would that word-sound be apprehended;—this would certainly involve the worst incongruity for you. One is of the nature of the cognition, and the other is of the nature of the cognised; and the two are therefore tied up together as by a chain; consequently whenever the one is there the other must be there also, without fail.—(2502-2504)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even if the Word-Sound is not the cause of the Cognition of it, there are incongruities. For instance, there are two alternatives possible—Is the Word-Sound endowed with the nature of being apprehended by its Cognition or not?—If it is, then there is the following discrepancy:—[*see verses 2502-2504 above*]

If the Word-Sound is of the nature of *being apprehended by its Cognition*, then, like the Word, its Cognition also should be eternal, existing at all times; because the nature of apprehensibility by it continues for all time (in the Word). For example, when the character of *holding the stick* belongs to Devadatta, it is not possible that the stick should not continue as long as Devadatta is there.

‘*Tied*, *up together as by a chain*’—‘*Hi*’ stands for *because*. The sense thus is as follows:—*Because* the nature of being *cognised* and the nature of being *Cognition* are tied together as by a chain,—therefore it becomes established that whenever the one is present, the other also has to be present,—without fail.—(2502-2504)

*Question*:—“Let that be so; what is the harm?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2505 next*]
