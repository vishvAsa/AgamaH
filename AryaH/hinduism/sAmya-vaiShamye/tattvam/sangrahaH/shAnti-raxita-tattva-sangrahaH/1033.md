> If it be urged that—“what is ordinarily known as the inferential indicative is accepted by us, but not what has been set up by others”,—then (the answer is that) even the ordinary man understands what is the ‘cause etc. of the effect, etc.’; and in reality, this is all that the masters of the science of reasoning also have declared. So that when the ordinary (popular) idea is accepted, what is it that becomes excluded?—(1482-1483)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Purandara* has argued as follows:—“What is known as *Inference*, in the ordinary world, is admitted by the *Cārvākas* also; what they deny is that form of Inference which people have set up, beyond that known in common experience”.

This is anticipated and answered in the following—[*see verses 1482-1483 above*]

The construction is—‘the ordinary man understands, etc. etc.’.

‘*Effect, etc*.’;—‘Etc.’ is meant to include the ‘nature’ of the thing.—

Similarly in ‘*Cause*, *etc*.’, the ‘nature’ is meant to be included. In both cases the Plural number has been used in view of individual things.

Thus then, the Inferential Indicative which is understood by ordinary men to be related through the relationship of ‘Nature’ and ‘Effect’,—is just what has been spoken of by us as the ‘Probans’;—and when you accept this, what is it that you discard, for which you are denying the Character of ‘Inference’?—(1482-1483)
