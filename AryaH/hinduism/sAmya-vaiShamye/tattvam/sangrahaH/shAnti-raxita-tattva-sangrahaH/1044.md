> “It does not exist at the place (where the word is); nor at the time.—If it he urged that the required concomitance would be there in view of the eternality and the all-pervasive character (of the word)”,—then [the answer is that] that would be so with all words; and for that same reason the concomitance being perceived in all cases, there would be no idea of the negative concomitance at all; and it would thus be possible for all words to provide the cognition of all things.”—(1496-1497)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“The *Thing* (spoken of) does not exist at the place that is occupied by the *Word*; for instance, the word ‘Dates’ is heard in one place—the city of *Pāṭaliputra* for instance,—and yet the thing,—the dates themselves—do not exist there. Nor again is the *Thing* necessarily present at the time that the word is present; for instance, the word ‘*Dilīpa*’ is present (uttered) now, while the person of that name lived long ago; and while the word ‘*Mahāsammata*’ is present now, what it denotes is to come in future.—Under the circumstances, how can there be *concomitance* between words and the things denoted by them?

“The following might be urged—‘Words are eternal and as such exist at all times; so that things denoted by them cannot exist at a *time* other than that of the Word; nor can they exist at a *place* other than that occupied by the words, as being all-pervading in character, words are present at all places. Thus, by reason of their *eternality* and *all-pervasive character*, there would be concomitance between the Words and the Things denoted by them’.

“If that be so, then, such *eternality* and *all-pervasiveness* belong to all words equally; and hence it should not be the case that particular words should denote particular things only; in fact, any single word should denote all things, as all things would be present at the place and at the time at which the Word is present.

‘*The negative concomitance*—i.e. *the absence of the Probans* wherever there is *absence of the Probandum*.

‘*There would be no idea*’—no apprehension; for the same reason that words are *eternal* and *all-pervading*.—(1496-1497)
