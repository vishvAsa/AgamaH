> Some people have regarded the conceptual content to be that which is capable of being connected with the universal and the rest;—that view cannot be right, as the universal, etc. have all been rejected, and they are never perceived.—(1219)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“Other people describe the Conceptual Content not only as ‘the idea associated with words’, but also as that which is capable of being connected with the Universal, Quality, Action and so forth. Why do not you accept these?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1219 above*]

‘*They are never perceived*’—i.e. the Universal, etc. are never actually perceived.

This answer has been given on the assumption (for the sake of argument) that the Universal, etc. do exist.—(1219)
