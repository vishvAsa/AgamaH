## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author next points out objections against the Qualities of ‘Merit and Demerit’:—[*see verse 691 above*]

“The *Unseen Force* (Destiny) is what brings the fruits of an act to its Doer,—it is a Quality of the Soul,—is produced by the contact of the Soul and Mind,—and is destroyed by its own effect; it is of two kinds—the two kinds being *Merit* and *Dement*; of these *Merit* becomes the cause of the Doer’s happiness, welfare and liberation; and *Demerit* becomes the cause of his unhappiness, calamities and sin.”

Such is the account of the *Unseen Force* provided by the other party.

Inasmuch as the Soul, the Mind, and the contact of these—which have been regarded as the cause of the said Force,—have been already rejected before,—there can be no Cause for the said Force; and hence it is concluded that it cannot be existent.

As regards *Sound*, that has been held to be the Quality of *Ākāśa*,—it has been already rejected above, when it came under review, apart from its proper place. Hence objections against it are not repeated here.—(691)

*End of Chapter XI*.
