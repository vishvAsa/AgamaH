> If it were not so, then all cognitions would have one and the same object; there would be incongruity also as regards their appearing in succession, when their efficient cause is there all the time.—(2466)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that neither of the Reasons just adduced by the Buddhist is ‘Inconclusive’:—[*see verse 2466 above*]

‘*Of all cognitions*’—i.e. of the cognitions of Taste, Colour and so forth.—The possibility of all having the same object, though appearing diversely—is the argument that annuls the Reason in question.

‘*Incongruity as regards appearing in succession*’—would annul the reason ‘because they appear in succession—(2466)
