> “[For instance, in the case of the well-known inference of fire from smoke] though the place is perceived by sense-perception, and the fire (in the kitchen) is remembered,—yet the cognition of the two together (i.e. the fire and the place in the hill), does not cease to be inferential—(1537)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

For instance, when the Place,—the Minor Term—is directly *perceived*,—and the Fire is cognised by *Remembrance*,—yet, when the resultant Inference of the place as *qualified by Fire* appears,—it does not lose its character of the *Means of Cognition*; in fact it remains a Means of Right Cognition. The same should be the case with Analogical Cognition also.—(1537)
