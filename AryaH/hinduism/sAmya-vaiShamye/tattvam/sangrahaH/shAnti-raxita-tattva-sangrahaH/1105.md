> “In the case of proving the potency of the ear, etc., whatever probans might be put forward, would all be found to be ‘of unknown substratum’; as the substratum would consist of the potencies themselves, and these are still unknown.”—(1591)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, in a case where the Potencies of the Ear, etc. are made the Subject of the Inference, whatever Probans (Reason) might be put forward, for the proving of the said Potencies, would all be ‘of unknown substratum’; because the Potencies would be their substratum, and these are *not known* (as yet).

From all this it follows that all Potencies are cognisable through *Presumption*, not through *Inference*.—(1591)
