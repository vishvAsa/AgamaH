> Thus, it is established that the idea of validity, being ascertained through the cognition of effective action, does not involve infinite regress; as all further need has ceased.—(2986)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* sums up the argument:—[*see verse 2986 above*]

‘*As all further need has ceased*’;—‘*Parākāṅkṣā*’ is to be treated as a *Karmadhāraya* compound; ‘*parā*’—‘another’, ‘further’—being a qualification for ‘*ākāṅkṣā*’—‘need’,—Or it may be taken as *Tatpuruṣa*—‘need for *another*’—i.e. anything other than *conformity* to the reality;—because all such need has ceased.

Further, when it is said that ‘Cognition in conformity with reality is valid’,—it provides the definition (peculiar characteristic) of that Cognition which brings about the result in the shape of the Cognition of effective action. This definition is not applicable to the Cognition of the result itself; under the circumstances, how could there be any room for the objection that this Cognition also should be regarded as valid? For instance, when the *Seed* is defined as the *cause of the Sprout*,—do the wise ones raise the question that the Sprout also should be regarded as the *Seed*? What happens in this case is that the fact of the *Seed* being the ‘cause of the Sprout’ is cognised only when one sees the *Sprout* (rising from it); in the same manner, the Cognition is cognised as ‘valid’ only when its result in the shape of effective action is perceived; and this result is not apprehended by another Cognition; only if it did, would there be an Infinite Regress. Because the Cognition of the result, which is in the shape of Cognition, is cognised by itself (not by another Cognition); and there can be no mistake or illusion in the Cognition in regard to itself; because if there were any uncertainty regarding it, the Cognition of itself could not come about at all. Thus there is nothing in what has been urged by the other party.—(2986)
