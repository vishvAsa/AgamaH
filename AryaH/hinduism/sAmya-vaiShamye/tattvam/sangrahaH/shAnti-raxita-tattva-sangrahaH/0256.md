> As a matter of fact, there is no perception of ‘substance’, which should be perceptible, as something permeating through (and comprehensive of) the ‘successive factors’,—hence it cannot be regarded as existing,—like the ‘sky-lotus’.—(322)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

This shows that the statement that “The Soul, in the form of Substance, is permeating through the ‘Successive Factors’, is apprehended by perception itself” is not true; because as a matter of fact, no such substance as ‘Soul’ is perceived to appear, in that comprehensive (all-embracing) form, in any such Cognition as is admitted (by all parties) to be ‘Sense-perception’.—(322)
