> “If it be urged that—‘the validity of the auditory cognition would be due to its connection with another auditory cognition’,—then of the Veda also, the validity may be due to the corroboration of another cognition brought about by the Veda. In both oases, the (corroborative) cognition is not produced by other means; hence they do not need corroboration by cognitions produced by other causes.”—(2901-2902)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Texts*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* anticipates and answers the objection that the Corroborative Instance cited is devoid of the Probandum:—[*see verses 2901-2902 above*]

When the same sound is heard by several men,—another auditory cognition does become operative (upon the same object); hence it is through the corroboration of this other auditory organ that the validity of the first cognition is ascertained.

The answer to this is provided by the words—‘*Of the Veda also, etc*. *etc*.’—‘*Due to corroboration by another cognition brought about by the Veda*’;—i.e. due to the connection of another cognition produced by the Veda.

‘*In both cases*’—i.e. in the case of the auditory cognition and that of the cognition of what is said in the Veda.

What is meant is as follows:—In the phrase ‘it does not need the corroboration of other cognitions’, what is meant by ‘other cognitions’ is *cognitions produced by other Means of Cognition*,—not the cognition produced by the same Means as the Cognition in question. Consequently, the Reason being a qualified one, the Corroborative Instance in our argument is *not* ‘devoid of the Probandum’?

‘*Corroboration of cognitions produced by other causes*’;—the compound is to be expounded as—the ‘*Saṃvāda*’—corroboration—of such ‘*Jñāna*’—cognition—as is ‘*Kṛta*’—produced—by—‘*hetvantara*’—other causes.—(2901-2902)
