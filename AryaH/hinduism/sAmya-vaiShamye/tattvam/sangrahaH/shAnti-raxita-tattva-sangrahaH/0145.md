> If the functioning (of the spirit) be ‘somehow’ (unintentional),—then what sort of ‘intelligence’ is his?—since even the fisherman does not act without thinking over the effect of his action.—(169)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged;—“The Spirit may not act through *Compassion*, or through *Amusement*; but somehow it acts unintentionally (automatically)”.

The answer to this is given in the following Text:—[*see verse 169 above*]

How could such a Person be listened to by intelligent men,—being more ignorant and stupid than even such common people as the fisherman and the like.—‘*Buddhimattā*’ stands for *intelligence*.—‘*Śanaka*’ is the *fisherman*.—(169)
