> Even when the child is born of a certain person, there is always a likelihood of diversity in its features, by reason of the peculiarities of such causes as the ‘destiny’ (of the child) and food (of the parents) and so forth.—Further, (*a*) what is cited as the probans does not constitute the nature (of the probandum); (*b*) nor is that its effect; (*c*) nor is it of the nature of ‘the non-perception of the perceptible’;—and apart from these (three) there is nothing that can make the probans ‘infallible’ (true).—(1417-1418)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“Certainly there is *incompatibility*; even when there is no difference in the cause, if there were difference in the effect,—then the effect would be causeless”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1417-1418 above*]

Through such causes as *the peculiarity of past good deeds* (Destiny) and eating of hot food and other diverse circumstances, diversity in the features of the child—such as *fairness* and the like—are possible; wherefore then can there be any incompatibility where a diversity in the causes is well known?

Then again, the Premiss—‘Because he is the son of so and so’—is not a ‘natural’ Reason,—as ‘being a product’ is (in the proving of *non-eternality*); in the latter case, ‘being a product’ can have no other character save that of *non-eternality*; while in the case in question it is not that there is no other character for ‘being his son’; because the appellation of ‘his son’ is applied,—not on the ground of the son being *dark*, but—on the basis of the aggregate of five ingredients (of which the body of the child consists).—Nor is the *Probans* one based on ‘effect’; as there is no causal relation known to subsist (between *Being his son* and *Darkness*).—Nor (lastly), is it of the nature of the ‘*non-perception* of the perceptible’, as what is cited is in the positive form; also because there being no incongruity between the two, the Probans cannot prove the *negation of complexions other than the Dark*.

Apart from these three there can be no Inferential Indicative,—because of the absence of ‘Invariable Concomitance’ (in all other cases); without Invariable Concomitance, there can be no proper ‘indicative’ character; for, if there were, it would lead to absurdities.

Thus then, what has been cited is neither a ‘Probans’, nor is it ‘three-featured How then could there be ‘Infallibility’ in it?

‘*Non-perception of the perceptible*’—is the non-apprehension of something which fulfils all the conditions of apprehensibility,—(1417-1418)
