> The reason is found to be false also; when, for instance, names, such as ‘kāraka’ (active agent), and the like, are applied to things like the ‘sky-lotus—(205)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text proceeds to show that even with the said qualification, the Reason remains ‘inconclusive’:—[*see verse 205 above*]

When a name, such as ‘*Kāraka*’, is applied to such *non-entities* as the ‘Sky-lotus’ (in such expressions as ‘the Skylotus is a non-entity’, where the ‘Sky-lotus’ may be spoken of as the ‘Nominative’,,—then, according to both parties, the term is *one* only and also distinct from terms denoting the Body, etc.;—and yet the denotation of the term does not consist of *a thing* distinct from the Body, etc. Hence the Reason, as urged, is ‘Inconclusive’,—(205)
