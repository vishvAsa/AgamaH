> If the author of these story-books is inferred from the fact of their being expressive of distinctly clear meanings,—then why cannot the same be done in regard to the Veda also?—(2414)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* points out the ‘inadmissibility’ and hence ‘Inconclusiveness’ of the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* Probans:—[*see verse 2413 above*]

‘*Teṣām*’—stands for the story-books, etc.

‘*Why* *cannot, etc*. *etc*.’—That is, why is not the Author of the Veda also inferred from its being expressive of distinctly clear meanings?—there being no difference between the two cases. Thus the Reason—‘because there is no means of knowing such an Author’ becomes ‘inadmissible’, ‘untrue’.—(2414)
