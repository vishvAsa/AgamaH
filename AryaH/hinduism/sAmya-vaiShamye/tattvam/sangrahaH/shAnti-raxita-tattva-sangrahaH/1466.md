> “The connection is only an indicator; hence (for its functioning) it stands in need of being cognised itself; it is for this reason that, though present, it does not do the indicating until it is itself cognised.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra*, 32].—(2266)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—‘Even if the Connection is not known (to some persons), why should it not bring about its own effects? Even though hidden in the holes of the Threshing Yard, the seed does not relinquish its own function of producing the sprout’.

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2266 above*]

The nature of the *Indicator* is different from that of the *Producer*; the Word, like the Smoke, is only an *Indicator*, not a *producer*, like the seed. Hence the objection raised is not applicable.—(2266)
