> That same ‘form of the cognition’ called the ‘Apoha’, is the ‘denotation of the word’,—also (regarded as) a ‘positive entity in the form of the ‘commonalty’; on account of its being apprehended as such, through mistake.—(1024)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to show that our view is not open to the charge of ‘futility’—of having a Probandum that is already proved;—[*see verse 1024 above*]

The ‘form of the Cognition’ described above, as imposed upon it as something external, is called ‘*Apoha*’,—which is the ‘denotation of the word’; and it is spoken of as an external thing, in the shape of the *Commonalty* (or Universal).

The reason for this is stated—‘*On account*, *etc. etc*.’;—i.e. because it is apprehended in the form of the Commonalty, and in the form of a positive entity.

The reason for its being called ‘the denotation of the word’ and the ‘Apoha’ has already been explained above, under *Texts* 1017 and 1007.—(1024)

*Question*—“Wherefore is not that a real *Commonalty* (Universal)?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1025 next*]
