> “As a matter of fact, the order of sequence is not a product; because it is always accepted as an already established entity; the speaker does not adopt any order independently by his own choice; in fact, he always desires to utter the word in the same form in which it has been uttered by others in the past; and other persons coming later also utter it in that same form;—thus it is that this also is without beginning,—like the connection (of the meaning).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 287-289].—(2286-2287)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Two arguments have been urged (by the Opponent, under *Text* 2280) to the effect—(1) that the Letters are the products of Articulation, and (2) that they are dependent upon the whim of the Speaker.—It is pointed out by the *Mīmāṃsaka* in the following *texts* that both these Reasons are ‘inadmissible’:—[*see verses 2286-2287 above*]

‘*Because it is always, etc. etc*.’—i.e. the Speaker adopts the already existing order.

This is further clarified—‘*The Speaker does not*, *etc. etc*.’.

Like the *Connection*, the *Order* also is without beginning.—(2286-2287)
