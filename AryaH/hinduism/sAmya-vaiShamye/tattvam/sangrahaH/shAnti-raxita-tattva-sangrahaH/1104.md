> “The relation of these potencies has not been previously cognised;—nor is it cognised now; and it is only on the basis of such cognitions that there could be the two premisses.”—(1590)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Prior to the time of Inference, the relation of the Potencies to the effects has not been cognised,—in the way in which the relation of Fire and Smoke is previously recognised in the kitchen; because the Potencies are *not perceptible*. This shows that there can be no Major Premiss (asserting the Invariable Concomitance).

‘*Nor is it cognised now*’—at the time of Inference; for the same reason that they are *not perceptible*. This shows that there can be no Minor Premiss.

The *effect* cannot be regarded as a property of the Potencies residing in the Cause, as there can be no ground for this idea.—(1590)
