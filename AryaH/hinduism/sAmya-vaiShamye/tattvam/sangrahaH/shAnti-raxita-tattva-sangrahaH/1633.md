> How could the auditory organ come within the range of one’s experience, through the influence of charms and medicines, etc.? Being eternal, it cannot derive any peculiarities from these.—(2548)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent:—“It is found that even what is not an effect is influenced by things: for instance, the Auditory Organ, which was not within range of one’s experience before (in the case of the deaf) comes within its range, through the influence of medicines and charms. Thus your Reason becomes Inconclusive”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2548 above*]

‘*Medicines*, *etc*.’—‘*etc?* includes scratchings, operations.

‘*How could it*, *etc*.’—i.e. if, even so, it did not have the character of an *effect*.

“Even if it is not an Effect, there would be *influencing* by the mere production of peculiarities.”

*Answer*:—‘*Being eternal*, *etc. etc*.’—(2548)
