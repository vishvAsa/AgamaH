> ‘Diversity’ (difference) and ‘sameness’ (non-difference), etc. are resident in entities; while the ‘denotation of words’ is entirely featureless; hence the said characters have no place here.—(1191)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Diversity and sameness, etc*.’—i.e. Difference and Non-difference, etc.—the ‘etc.’ including ‘being subsistent’ and ‘non-subsistent’ and so forth.

All these are properties residing in *Entities* only; how could they reside in the *Apoha* which has its body created only by the artist of Conceptual Thought?

It has been argued that—“*Apoha* being of the nature of *Action*, its objective has to be pointed out”.

The reason put forward is not admitted; because the *Apoha* denoted by the Word is of the nature of a ‘Reflected Image’; and this Reflected Image, being in the form of the apprehended external object, cannot be a mere *negation*,

For the same reason there is no room for the optional alternatives set forth (by *Uddyotakara*)—as to whether it has, for its objective, the *Cow*, or the *Non-Cow*; as it is always apprehended as something positive, appertaining to the *Cow* [hence the question of its pertaining to the *Non-Cow* does not arise’,—(1191)
