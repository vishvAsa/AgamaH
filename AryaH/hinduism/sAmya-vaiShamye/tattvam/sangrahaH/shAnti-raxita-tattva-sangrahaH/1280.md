> In cases of affections of the eye, whenever there is the slightest defect in the eye, the cognition based upon the eye appears in a defective form.—Thus, even when the body has perished, the subjective consciousness, which does not subsist in it, continues to exist through the force of its own cause;—there can be no incongruity in this.—(1935-1936)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *text* proceeds to show that the *character of subsisting in something* is invariably concomitant with the *character of becoming directly modified* on the modification of the latter thing:—[*see verses 1935-1936 above*]

As the wider character is absent, it is proved that the Subjective Consciousness does not subsist in the Body.

‘*Thus*’—therefore—even on the cessation of the Body,—the Subjective Consciousness shall not cease. There is no incongruity in this.—When one thing does not subsist in another, it does not necessarily cease upon the cessation of the latter; e.g. the cessation of the *Cow* does not lead to the cessation of the *Gavaya*;—and the Body is not the substratum of Subjective Consciousness; hence there is non-apprehension of the wider character.—(1935-1936)
