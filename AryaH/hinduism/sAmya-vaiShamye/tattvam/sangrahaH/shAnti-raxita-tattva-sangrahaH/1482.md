> “The idea in the mind, of every speaker is always that ‘i am uttering words that have been used by other persons’; this in itself makes them eternal; and there is nothing for you that would be indicative (of a contrary conclusion).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 294].—(2291)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, if Letters were not eternal, in the sense of being *unchangeable*,—then, in the mind of every user of words, the idea could not be there that ‘I am uttering only those words that have been used by others’; and yet as a matter of fact, this idea *is* there; hence it follows that this could not be possible if the Letters were not eternal.

This is what is explained in the following:—[*see verse 2291 above*]

Says the Opponent—If the *Order* of the Letters, *Ga* and the rest, is not eternal *in reality*,—nor are the *articulations* manifesting them, nor those Conjunctions and Disjunctions of the Palate, etc.,—then one cannot bring about these prompters of the articulations [as they are past and gone immediately on coming]; and the new ones that one does bring about have never before been found to be such *prompters*;—under the circumstances, how can the Letters, manifested in a certain order, become the means of comprehending the meaning?—(2291)

In view of all these arguments, the *Mīmāṃsaka* says:—[*see verse 2292 next*]
