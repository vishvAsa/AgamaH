> In the case of cognition, its coming into existence itself has been described as constituting its character of ‘means of right cognition’; why then should not the causal character in the case of all things be held to be the same?—(528)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the case of Cognition there is no other operation apart from its *being born*, *coming into existence*; for instance under *Mīmāṃsā-sūtra* 1. 1.4, defining ‘Sense-perception’,—while explaining the purpose served by the term ‘*janma*’, ‘birth’, in the *Sūtra*, *Kumārila* has declared as follows—“What the term ‘*birth* of Cognition’ connotes is the fact of the Cognition being a Means of Right Cognition *as soon as it is born*; in the case of other agencies, a certain Operation is found, which is something distinct from their *birth*; in order to preclude the same in the case of the *Means of Right Cognition*, it is necessary to use the term ‘birth’,”—(*Ślokavārtika*; *Sūtra* 1. 1. 4, 53-54).

‘*The causal character, etc*.’;—i.e. why cannot all things be regarded as produced by the ‘birth ‘coming into existence’, of the Cause?—(528)
