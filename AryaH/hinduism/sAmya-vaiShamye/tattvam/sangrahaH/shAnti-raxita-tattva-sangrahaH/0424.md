> Among these, the non-existence of the eternal (permanent) atoms has already been proved, by establishing the fact of all things being in a state of ‘perpetual flux’.—(551)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Among these, what have been described as Earth and the rest in the form of *Permanent Atoms*,—the non-existence of these in the form of anything permanent has been proved by the establishing of the ‘Perpetual Flux’ of things which pervades over all things; the Universal proposition having been established in the form—‘Whatever exists must be momentary,—because what is not-momentary cannot have any fruitful action either successive or simultaneous; hence what is not-momentary cannot exist’.—(551)
