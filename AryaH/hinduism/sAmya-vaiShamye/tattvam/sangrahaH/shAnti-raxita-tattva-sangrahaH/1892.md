> Thus, even where the suspicion (of sublation) is due to stupidity, there is always some ground for it; when there is cognition of the perfectness of the cause and that of conformity to reality, there arises no suspicion in the mind of the wise. so that he does not become beset with doubt in all his dealings: as his mind has become free from doubt, on the cognition of the said perfectness and conformity.—If even after this, a foolish, man entertains suspicions,—it is in reference to such a person that the suspicious character seems to have been deprecated by the unborn one (in the bhagavadgītā).—(3019-3021)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 2872, that—“If the man, through stupidity, should imagine the existence of the sublating Cognition, even when none has come about, he would be beset with doubts in all his dealings, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3019-3021 above*]

It has been explained that all doubt and suspicion cease when the perfect character of the cause, and conformity with reality have become perceived.

It has been asserted by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2873, that—“Suspiciousness has been deprecated by *Vāsudeva*, etc. etc.”.—What the person making this assertion has shown by this is only his own devotion to the *Bhakti-cult*, not the real state of things. A mere assertion, without reasons, does not carry conviction regarding the real state of things, to any intelligent person whose mind has risen above the normal.

The words of *Vāsudeva* (that have been quoted) were pronounced in an entirely different context, and are not incompatible with our view of things.—This is what is shown by the words—‘*If, even after this, etc*, *etc*.’—‘*After this*’—i.e. after having perceived the *perfectness of the cause* and also *conformity to reality*,—one,—like yourself,—entertains suspicions,—as asserted (under *Text* 2834) that—‘the corroboration of the corroboration also has to be sought for’,—such suspicious character is what appears to have been deprecated by the ‘Unborn One’—*Viṣṇu*.—(3019-3021)
