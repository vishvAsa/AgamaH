> It behoves you to prove beyond doubt that the text in question is not ‘Veda’; as otherwise, the reason that you have put forward (against the omniscient person) that he is not mentioned in the ‘Veda’ becomes doubtful.—(3521)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Otherwise*’—i.e. if you do not establish the fact that it is not *Veda*; in that case, what you have asserted regarding the Omniscient Person being not mentioned in the ‘Veda’, becomes open to doubt and hence ‘Inadmissible’ (as Reason).—(3521)
