> Under the view that the perception (op sound) is through contact (with the sense-organ), the cognition of the sound of thunder could not be in the interrupted form,—like that of the feather in the ear.—(2525)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*;—“What proof then is there *against* the idea that the Word-Sound is apprehended only *on contact* with the Auditory Organ,—and *in support of* the idea that it is apprehended *without such contact*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2525 above*]

‘*Like the feather in the Ear*’,—this is an instance *per dissimilarity*; and the ‘*rati*’-affix is added to the word ending in the Genitive ending. The meaning thus is—when a man is engaged in tickling the Ear with a feather, the Sound made by the feather is heard as continuous, without interruption; in the same manner, when there is Sound of Thunder spreading all round like the filaments of the *Kadamba* flower, and it is heard on reaching the Ear,—then this hearing also should be continuous, not interrupted.—It cannot be right to say that there is illusion of *break* on account of the peculiarity of the substratum wherein the conjunction of its Cause subsists. Because there is no perception of such place, etc.; and no Cognition ever appears which imposes forms which have never been cognised; e.g. the Visual Perception does not impose the form of Taste.—(2525)
