> “The six that have been postulated are things with properties, and the properties are certainly admitted by us to be distinct from them.”—If this is said (by the other party), then (we ask)—what is the relation that is held to subsist between the categories and the properties? This relation cannot be that of ‘conjunction’, as this is restricted to substances alone (under the *nyāya*-view); nor is the other relation, that of ‘inherence’, possible; and no other relation is accepted by the other party.—(574-575)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the other party—“This is what we readily admit; hence it does not vitiate our argument.”

How is it then that you have declared the Categories to be *six* only?

The answer to this question is anticipated and answered in the following—[*see verse 574-575 above*]

“The ‘Six Categories’ that have been postulated are only *those that have Properties*; while the ‘Six Categories’ in the shape of the *Properties* are held to be quite distinct; as is found in the following words of the *Padārthapraveśaka*—‘This mention has been made of only the *things with properties*, without any mention of the *Properties*’.”

The answer to this explanation of the other party is provided by the words—‘*Then what is the relation, etc., etc*.’;—*Relation*—of the Property in the shape of *Existence*, etc.—with ‘*those*’—i.e. the Categories what is that relation by virtue of which *Existence* becomes the ‘property’ of the Categories? Without some sort of relation the character of ‘*Property* and *With Properly*’ would not be possible; otherwise it would lead to the absurdity of everything being the Property of everything. As a matter of fact, there is no relation between the Property of *Existence* and the Categories. Because there are only two kinds of Relation—Conjunction and Inherence. The relation of Conjunction is not possible in the case in question, because being of the nature of *Quality*, Conjunction is restricted to Substances only [and Substance is only one of the Six Categories; all these latter, therefore, cannot have *Conjunction* with the Property of *Existence*].—Nor can the relation be one of the nature of Inherence, because it is held to be one only, like ‘Existence’ itself; while if the relation of ‘Inherence’ subsisted between Inherence and the Categories, then the former ‘Inherence’ should have to be regarded as different from the latter [and this would involve self-contradiction].—(574-575)
