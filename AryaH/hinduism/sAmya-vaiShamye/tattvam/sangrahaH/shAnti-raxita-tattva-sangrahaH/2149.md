> [He is described as] one who, having shown himself in a dream as a six-tusked white elephant, was born as one going to be a Bodhisattva, the ocean of fine qualities, his fame proclaimed, omniscient, full of mercy, attaining the state of immortality, pure, the father of the whole world.—(3513-3514)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*His fame proclaimed*’—i.e his fame well-known to the whole world.

‘*Attaining the state of Immortality*’—i.e. on reaching the state of *Nirvana*, which consists in the cessation of all Afflictions along with the Dispositions.

‘*Pure*’—consisting of constituents free from all impurities. This indicates that superiority of the Blessed Lord which is conducive to his own welfare and which consists in the destruction of all Ignorance; the phrase, ‘*The Father of all*’ indicates that superiority which is conducive to the welfare of others.—‘*Father*’, Teacher and Controller,—*of the world*;—because He establishes the Three forms of Right Knowledge.—(3513-3514)

The following *Texts* anticipate and answer the rejoinder of the other party, to the above:—[*see verses 3515-3516 next*]
