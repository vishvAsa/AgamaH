> When a certain thing that comes out of its cause is without parts,—the ‘destruction’ that would be imposed upon it by other causes must be of the same nature.—(359)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“When the thing is born out of its cause, it is not in its complete form; hence what it obtains from another cause is another character in the shape of ‘Destruction’,”

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 359 above*]

A single thing cannot have two *natures*, by virtue of which it could be produced in parts; on the contrary, the thing is *without parts*; and when a thing is produced from its Cause, it must be produced in its entire form; how then can another nature be imposed upon it, later on, by other Causes? In fact, what is not produced at the time that a thing is produced, cannot form the *nature* of that thing; because ‘non-difference’, ‘sameness’, implies complete identity of condition. Hence that which comes about at a later time, in the form of ‘Destruction’, must be a different ‘nature’ (character); and how can this, which is thus *different*, belong to the thing itself? Hence there is nothing in this theory.—(359)

If the other alternative be accepted that ‘the Destruction produced is something *different* from the thing’, even so, the cause of the destruction of the thing would be useless. This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 360 next*]
