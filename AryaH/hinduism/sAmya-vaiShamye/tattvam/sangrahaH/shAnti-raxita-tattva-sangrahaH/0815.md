> Of things,—‘appearance’ is birth; ‘destruction’ is perishing; and ‘continuance’ is the thing in its own form. now in birth there is no perishing; why then is it spoken of as ‘*utpattiḥ*’ (feminine)? Nor is there existence in its own form; why then is it spoken of as ‘*janma*’ (neuter)? In destruction also, the other two states are not there; why then is it spoken of as ‘*tirobhāvaḥ*’ (masculine), ‘*nāśaḥ*’ (masculine) and ‘*tirobhavanam*’ (neuter)? As regards continuance also, on what ground is it spoken of as ‘*sthitiḥ*’ (feminine) and ‘*svabhāvaḥ*’ (masculine)?—If the form of these is not differentiated, then they should always be in one and the same gender.—(1127-1130)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

For the following reason, the explanation provided is too narrow.—Because in connection with the same said states of Continuance and the rest, it is found that to each of these, words of all the three genders are applied. For instance, *Appearance* is spoken of as ‘*utpādaḥ*’ (Birth, Masculine); *Destruction* is spoken of as ‘*nāśaḥ*’ (Perishing, Masculine); *Continuance* is spoken of as ‘*ātmasvarūpam*’ (its own form, Neuter).—Now as regards *Appearance*, there can be no ‘continuance’ or ‘destruction’ in it; how then could such words as ‘*utpattiḥ*’ (Feminine) and ‘*janma*’ (Neuter) foe applied to it? Similarly as regards *Destruction*, there can foe no ‘continuance’ or ‘appearance’ in it; how then could it foe spoken of by such terms as ‘*tirobhāvaḥ*’ (Masculine), ‘*vināśaḥ*’ (Masculine) and ‘*tirobhavanam*’ (Neuter)?—The particle ‘*api*’ in the *Text* serves to show that Destruction itself could not foe spoken of by that same word.—Similarly, as regards *Continuance*, Destruction and Appearance being impossible therein,—it has to foe explained on what grounds it is spoken of as ‘*sthitiḥ*’ (Feminine) and ‘*Svabhāvaḥ*’ (Masculine).

It might be said that—“inasmuch as these, *Continuance* and the rest, are not differentiated among themselves, each of them may be capable of taking all the three Genders”.

The answer to this is stated in the words—‘*If the form of these*, *etc. etc*.’;—that is, if the form of these is not differentiated from each other, then there should, in reality, foe only one, not *three*, Genders.—(1127-1130)

The other party says:—“The Feminine, Masculine and Neuter are so many different Universals, like the Universal ‘Cow’, and the like.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1131 next*]
