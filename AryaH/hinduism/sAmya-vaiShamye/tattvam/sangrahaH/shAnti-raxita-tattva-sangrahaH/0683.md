> “It might be argued that—Even in the absence of similarity of form, there could be assumption of Apoha;—then why is the Apoha of the ‘non-cow’ not assumed in the case of the cow and the horse?”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 76]—(937)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under 932, above) that—“no one can conceive of any shnilarity of Cow, etc. etc.—The following *Text* anticipates the Buddhist’s answer to that argument:—[*see verse 937 above*]

If, even in the absence of similarity, the *apoha of the non-Cow* be assumed in the case of the Variegated and other Cows,—then why can it not be assumed in the case of the *Cow and the Horse* also? The *absence of similarity* would be common to both cases.

The Author has used the form ‘*gavāśvayoḥ*’, evidently forgetting the rule embodied in the *Sutra* ‘*Gavāśvaprabhṛtīni ca saṃjñāyām*—(937)

The said presence of common conditions in the two cases is further explained:—[*see verse 938 next*]
