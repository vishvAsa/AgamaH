> For instance, the shaking of the hand and such gestures are not regarded as one and the same (and yet they indicate affirmation and denial). The cognitions of the word-sound that are produced have the varying characteristics of length, shortness, etc.—[which also shows that the word is not one];—the idea that the one word is variously ‘manifested’ has been discarded. There is no ‘commonalty’ (common character) perceptible in the several appearances of the word; and it is only through convention that they become aids to the cognition of denial, affirmation and the rest.—(2617-2618)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“If the one-ness of the Word is not *real*,—then how is it that words accomplish the purpose of affirming and denying things,—through mere (illusory) imposition?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2617-2618 above*]:

‘*Suck gestures*’—such as *winking of the eyes, etc*.

‘*With such varying characteristics as length, etc*.’—this has to be construed with ‘*huddhibhedataḥ*,’ ‘*the cognitions, etc*.’.

Nor can these characteristics be due to variations in the ‘manifester’; as the very idea of such ‘manifestation’ has been discarded.—‘*Tadvyaktiḥ*’—manifestation of the eternal thing (Word-Sound).

Nor can the Word serve as the basis of usage through a *commonalty*; as no such ‘commonalty’ is known; and a ‘commonalty’ that is not known cannot form the basis of usage; as in that case, the usage would go on for all time.

‘*Aids to the cognition of denial, etc*. *etc*.’—The ‘etc.’ includes affirmation, permission, request and so forth.—The ‘*gati*’ of these is their cognition, comprehension;—the ‘*aid*’ to this is its *cause*.—It is the *shaking of the hand, etc*. that become such aids.—What is meant is that the same would be the case with words also.—(2617-2618)
