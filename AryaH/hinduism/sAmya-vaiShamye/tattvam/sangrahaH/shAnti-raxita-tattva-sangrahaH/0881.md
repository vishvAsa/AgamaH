> The universal and the rest being never perceived,—and their connection being never manifested,—how can their association with things be possible,—as between milk and water, etc.?—(1220)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The said ‘non-perception’ of the Universal, etc. is further emphasised in the following—[*see verse 1220 above*]

‘*Like Milk and Water, etc*.’—When Milk and Water are mixed up, they do not appear separately,—and hence it is no longer possible to connect the two; in the same manner, even if the Universal and the rest do exist, they never appear as distinguished from their substratum; and hence it is not possible to connect them with their substratum.—(1220)
