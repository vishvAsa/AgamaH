> Because they appear in the sequential form in which they become manifested,—like dramas and stories,—the Vedas must be the work of an author; thus the author is cognised by means of inference also.—(2421)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 2088 above that—“The *Author of the Veda* has not had his relationship perceived previously, etc. etc.—hence he cannot be *inferred*”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2421 above*]

The reasoning may be formulated as follows:—What appears in the sequential order of the manifestation must be the work of an author;—like Dramas and Stories;—the Veda appears in the sequential order of its manifestation;—hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.

The Reason here adduced cannot be regarded as ‘Inadmissible’; because Letters are actually always cognised in a sequential order.—(2421)
