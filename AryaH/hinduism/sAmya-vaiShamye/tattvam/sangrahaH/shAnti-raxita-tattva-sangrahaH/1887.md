> For instance, you assert ‘validity’ on the ground of the absence of sublating cognition; and ‘absence of sublation’ also is held to be a distinct form of cognition, named ‘non-apprehension’;—so that the validity of this latter also is asserted on the ground of the absence of sublating cognition; and this process proceeding on and on, there can be no resting ground (stability).—(3004-3005) 
>
> Because the fact of the validity of the sublating cognition being self-sufficient has not been proved, therefore it cannot set aside the preceding cognition.—(3006)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verses 3004-3005*]:

It has been argued (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*), under *Text* 2866, that—“The sublating Cognition consists in the conviction that the thing cognised is otherwise than as cognised; and this conviction, being self-sufficient, sets aside the preceding Cognition”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3006 above*]

[*verse 3006*]:

As the form of Cognition called ‘Non-apprehension’ is always dependent upon something else, its validity cannot be regarded as proved.—(3006)
