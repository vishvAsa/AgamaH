## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above under *Text* 1591, that “whatever Reasons are adduced in regard to the Potency of the Ear, etc. would all be such as have their substratum *unknown*”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1616 above*]

*Objection* It has been said previously that *their existence is proved*; why then is it said now that *their existence is indicated*?”

*Reply*:—[*see verse 1617 next*]
