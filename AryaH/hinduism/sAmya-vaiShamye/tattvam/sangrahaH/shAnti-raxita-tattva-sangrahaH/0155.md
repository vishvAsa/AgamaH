> “Earth and the rest, even though existing at a place remote from me, are yet connected with my soul,—because they have a material form, etc.,—just like my own body.”—(186)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In proof of the *omnipresence* of the Soul, the same writer sets forth the following argument:—“The Earth, Water, Air and Mind which are things under dispute, are at a distance from my Soul, and yet they are in contact with that Soul,—(*a*) because they have material form,—(*b*) because they have velocity,—(*c*) because they have priority and posteriority,—(*d*) because they are associated with, and dissociated from, each other,—just like my own body”.

This argument is set forth in the following Text:—[*see verse 186 above*]
