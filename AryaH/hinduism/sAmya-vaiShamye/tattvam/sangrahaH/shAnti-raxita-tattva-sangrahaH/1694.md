> The order of sequence, is not accepted by all men as fixed for all; in pact, people adopt the order of words and sentences and letters according to their own wish. If that were not so, then, for you, like the Veda, there would be no book written by men; so that the composing of all meaningless (or wicked) works is rendered impossible at one stroke! Because there could be no certainty that this man is uttering words exactly as they had been used previously by others,—therefore like the relationship, they also could not be regarded as beginningless.—(2676-2678)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 2286, that—“The Order of sequence is not a product; it is always accepted as an established entity, etc. etc.”,—where certain objections have been answered.

The rejoinder to that is as follows:—[*see verses 2676-2678 above*]

The compound ‘*padavākya, etc*.’ is to be expounded as—‘*pada*’—words—‘*vākya*’—sentences—‘*akṣara*’—letters;—the ‘*krama*’—order of sequence—of these.

‘*Anarthagrantha, etc. etc*.’—construe as ‘*Kṛtiḥ dhvastā*’, ‘composing has been rendered impossible’.

‘*Anarthagrantha*’—is a work which has no ‘*artha*’—sense; i.e. such meaningless sentences as ‘ten pomegranates’ and the like.—Or ‘*anartha*’ maybe ‘works contrary to the Veda’, *wicked*,—like those formulating the Buddhist doctrines, for instance.—The term ‘*mātra*’ denotes *universality*.—‘*kṛti*’, doing, composing.—‘*tathā*’—like the *Veda*.—

‘*Aniyati*’—no certainty; i.e. there would be no certainty on the point.

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.—(2676-2678)
