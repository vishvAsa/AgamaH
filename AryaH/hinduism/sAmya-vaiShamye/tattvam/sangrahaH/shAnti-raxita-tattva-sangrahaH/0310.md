> Even when there is no difference between two things, there is nothing to prevent the notion of ‘this belonging to that’; as every expressive word is applied in accordance with an arbitrary whim.—(389)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In such expressions as ‘one’s own nature’, ‘the body of the stone-image’, and so forth,—even though there is no actual difference between the two things spoken of, the Possessive ending implying difference is used on the basis of an assumed difference; so would it be in the case in question also. Verbal expressions are used, not always in accordance with the real state of things, but in accordance with the whim of the speaker.—(389)
