> The two ‘*nirodhas*’ are not regarded as being of the nature of ‘destruction’; because ‘*pratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’ is regarded as ‘dissociation from impurities brought about by wisdom one after the other’; while ‘*apratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’ is that which serves as an absolute bar to the appearance of the impurities.—Thus people, not knowing the true doctrines, and depending upon the wrong notions of things, continue to wobble.—(2748-2749)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the ‘Inconclusiveness’ urged is from the standpoint of the *Vaibhāṣikas*,—even so, these people do not regard ‘*Pratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’ and the rest as of the nature of ‘Destruction’, as you have represented them to be.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 2748-2749 above*]

‘*The two nirodhas*’—i.e. *Pratisaṅkhyā-nirodha* and *Apratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’.

*Question*:—“In what form then are they regarded?”

*Answer*:—‘*Sāśrayaiḥ, etc. etc*.’—There is ‘*nirodha*’—‘dissociation’—from Impurities—which is attained by ‘*pratisaṇkhyā*’, *wisdom*; hence this is called ‘*Pratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’, And this varies with each associated object; hence the text has added the phrase ‘one *after the other*’, The idea is that as many of ‘associated’ factors there are, so many are the ‘dissociated’ factors also.—As regards the ‘*apratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’,—this is the name given to that Dissociation which serves as an absolute bar against future impurities.—This is due, not to wisdom, but, to the inefficiency of the causal factors; that is the reason why it is called ‘*Apratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*’.

This has been thus declared—‘*Pratisaṅkhyā-nirodha* consists in dissociation one after the other; the other, *Apratisaṅkhyā-nirodha*, consists in the absolute bar to the birth of the impurities—(2748-2749)

Even if these were of the nature of ‘Destruction’,—there is no ‘falsity’ or ‘Inconclusiveness’ in our Reason.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2750 next*]
