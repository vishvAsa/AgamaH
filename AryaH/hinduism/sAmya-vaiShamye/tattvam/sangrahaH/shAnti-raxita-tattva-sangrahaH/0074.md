## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted (by the Theist, above, under Text 49) that “The material Cause of the Tree and other things is controlled by an Intelligent Being, etc. etc.”

The answer to these arguments is given in the following Text:—[*see verse 82 above*]

As against the reason ‘*Because they have colour*, *etc*.’, this same criticism may be urged: *This same*,—as follows:—(*a*) It is *Unproven*; (*b*) as there is no Invariable Concomitance, it is *Inconclusive*; (c) if there is Invariable Concomitance, it is *Contradictory*; (*d*) the Instance is devoid of the Probandum; (e) if the Conclusion is meant to be genera’, it is *futile*, and so forth.—For instance, *that presence of Colour*, etc. which is controlled by an Intelligent Controller is not admitted as being present in the Tree, etc.;—mere ‘presence of Colour’ by itself is not invariably concomitant (with the Probandum); hence the Probans is *Inconclusive*; if there is invariable concomitance, then, it becomes *contradictory*, as proving a conclusion contrary to the one desired;—the *Corroborative Instance per similarity* is devoid of the Probandum, as no concomitance is admitted with the character of ‘being controlled by an eternal and one Intelligent Being’;—if the conclusion is meant to be in the *general* form, then the argument is *futile*; if it is meant to be *specific*, then it is *inconclusive* (Doubtful), the contrary being found to be the case with such things as the Jar and the like.—In this same manner, the criticism may be applied to the other reasonings also.—(82)
