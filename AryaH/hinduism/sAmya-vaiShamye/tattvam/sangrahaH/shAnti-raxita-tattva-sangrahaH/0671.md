> “In the case of a cognition, no ‘exclusion of another cognition’ is apprehended; in fact, apart from the coming about of its own form, the cognition carries with it no other factor.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 41]—(924)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—In the case of Intuitions also, there is always exclusion of one Intuition by another; hence *Apoha* is postulated. The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 924 above*]

It might be said that—“even though it is not apprehended, it may be there all the same”; hence it is added—‘*In fact, etc. etc*.’;—even though there may be exclusion of one Cognition from another, yet the Word has got nothing to do with it. Because as a matter of fact, when the Cognition is brought about by the Word, it does not bear within itself any factor expressed by the word, apart from its own appearance, in the shape of the exclusion of other Cognitions; on the contrary, it is always found to appear in the positive form. And the factor of an entity which is not expressed by the word cannot form the Import of that word; otherwise we would be landed in an absurdity.

The sense of all this is that the Proposition (of the Buddhist regarding *Apoha*) is annulled by actual experience.—(924)
