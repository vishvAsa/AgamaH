> The only evidence that is suggested is that of the mental cognition of omniscience as brought about by the repeated practice of the ‘truth’ relating to all things;—and not the ordinary visual and other cognitions. Under the circumstances, how can it be asserted that the said person should cognise taste, etc. through the eye?—As regards mental cognition of things like colour and the rest, it has been accepted, without dispute, even by the other party; in fact, it is on the basis of this mental cognition that the remembrance of colour and other things has been said to be produced.—During dreams also, there is mental cognition in the shape of the apprehension of all things.—Thus then, the omniscient person being postulated on the basis of mental cognition, the scope of which is not restricted,—how could he cognise taste, etc, through the eye? This objection might apply, if he were held to know all things through the eye itself. As a matter of fact however, he does cognise taste and other things collectively, through the mind.—Even in cases where some superior peculiarity is found (in the cognitions of the omniscient person), in regard to the perception of subtle and remote things,—it is all within the scope of the said mind and mental concepts; and it is not due to the functioning of the auditory organ on colour; all these undesirable contingencies that other people have urged against us are not applicable to us at all; because all the superiority and peculiarity lies in the mental cognition itself, and it does not lie beyond the scope of this cognition. Thus then for us, the things that were cognised in the past by certain means of cognition are precisely the same that are cognised now by the same means of cognition.—(3381-3389)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If it had been held (by us) that the Visual and other Sense -perceptions apprehend all things, then there might have been room for the objection that has been urged. As a matter of fact, however, when we postulate the Omniscient Person we do so on the basis of the fact that at one and the same time He knows all things through *Mental Cognition*,—which apprehends all entities, and which is as good as *Perception*, on account of its distinctness and its being in agreement with the real state of things,—real *Mental Cognition* having been brought about by the Practice of Meditation upon the Truth relating to the impermanent and other characters of all things; and we do not hold that He apprehends all things through the Visual or other Sense-perceptions.

It cannot be right to assert that—“Mental Cognition is not known to apprehend all things”. Because you have yourself explained that there is Remembrance of Colour, Sound and other things; and Remembrance is certainly a *Mental Cognition*—Then again, it is a well-known fact that in dreams, there is cognition of Colour and other things; so that the denial of *Mental Cognition* is impossible. Consequently, the peculiarities in the cognition of the Omniscient Person falling well within the scope of Mental Cognition, what you have urged does not affect our position at all.—(3381-3389)
