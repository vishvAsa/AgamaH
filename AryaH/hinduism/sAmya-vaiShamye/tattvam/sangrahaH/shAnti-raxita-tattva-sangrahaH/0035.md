## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following argument might be urged (by the *Sāṃkhya*):—“As a matter of fact, though Consciousness (or Cognition) by itself is devoid of the Blue or any other colour, yet it *appears* to be of that colour, by reason of the proximity of the Blue Object outside; and in the same manner, the Consciousness, which by itself is devoid of the form of Happiness and the rest, *appears* in these forms by reason of the imposition of the external Happiness, etc. upon it; so that, even though the Feeling is of the nature of Happiness, etc., these latter cannot be regarded as constituting *Consciousness*; and thus our principal Reason is not ‘too wide’ or Inconclusive.”

The answer to this is provided by the following:—[*see verse 37 above*]

‘*Bhāvanājātibhedataḥ*’;—‘*Bhāvanā*’ stands for *Habit*;—‘*jāti*’, ‘nature’, for one’s own *character*;—on account of the diversity—peculiarity—of these two;—*attachment and the rest*;—‘attachment’ stands for *Longing*; the phrase ‘*and the rest*’ includes such feelings as *Love* and the like, due to the *Harmony*–Attribute, *Hate, Agitation*, etc. due to the *Energy*–Attribute, and *Dejection*, Illusion, etc. due to the *Inertia*–Attribute; thus the effects of all the Three Attributes become included—all these are found to be *restricted*,—i.e. of one form;—for instance, on account of their peculiar *habits*, the *Lover* and other persons have one or the other of the said feelings in regard to Wine, Woman and other things, according as they have been found to be conducive to good or evil;—similarly on account of the peculiar nature, one or the other of the said feelings appear in some of the animals, like the Deer (who are attracted by Sound), the Elephant (who are attracted by Odour) and the like.—All these feelings (of Love, Hate and the rest) are always *restricted* (to the Lover, or the Deer, etc.),—and do not appear in all persons or animals. This would not be right if Sound and other objects were of the nature of (consisted of) Pleasure and the rest.—(37)

*Question*—“Why?”

The answer is given in the following:—
