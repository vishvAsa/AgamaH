> “When a proof is adduced in support of the affirmative view,—if that is refuted, the negative view (to the contrary) becomes rightly proved by itself. thus it is that, when the other party adduce proofs in support of the two ends of the Veda, the upholders of the Veda have. their purpose accomplished by the refutation of those proofs.”—(2100-2101)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Affirmative view*’—that the Veda is the work of an Author; and the denial of that is the ‘*Negative view*’. These two views are so related that the truth of the one involves the falsity of the other and vice versa;—hence the *denial* of one is concomitant with the *affirmation* of the other; so that the *Negative* view becomes proved by itself. For instance, for the purpose of proving the ‘two ends’—beginning and end—of the Veda, the Buddhists adduce certain proofs,—the mere refutation of these proofs proves the contrary view that the Veda has no beginning or end, and as such, is *not* the work of an Author; and when this has become proved, the Upholders of the Veda become satisfied on the accomplishment of what is desired by them.—(2100-2101)
