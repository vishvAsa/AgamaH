> The ‘embellishment’ of a thing, being not-different from the thing itself, must be eternal; consequently there would be cognition of things at all times.—(2514)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Like the form of the thing itself, the Embellishment also should be eternal, as it is non-different from it. So that this is an additional objection to which the said view is open.—(2514)
