> It is through perception that the readers of the Veda are recognised as the ‘makers’. It cannot be right to regard them as ‘manifesters’; because the ‘manifestation’ of eternal things is impossible.—(2418)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2088, that “the Author of the Veda is not *perceived*”.

The following *Text* shows that this Reason is ‘inadmissible’:—[*see verse 2418 above*]

If the opinion held is that ‘no *maker* of the Veda is ever perceived’,—then, in as much as *readers* of the Veda are always seen, what is asserted is clearly ‘inadmissible’.

If the idea held is that the *first* ‘maker’ of the Veda has not been seen,—even so the fact remains *doubtful—hence*—*inadmissible*; it being possible that he might have been seen by some one at some time.

If the idea is that the ‘Readers’ cannot be regarded as ‘Makers’ or ‘Authors’,—they are only the ‘manifesters’ of the Veda,—then the answer to that is that—‘*It cannot be right, etc. etc*.’—‘*Te*’ stands for the *Readers*.

That the ‘Manifestation’ of eternal things is not possible is going to be explained later on.

*Question*:—“How then can there be a ‘Manifester’ of the *non-eternal* Jar?”

*Answer*:—True; there can be no ‘Manifester’ for *non-eternal* things also.

*Question*:—“How then are things like the *Lamp* regarded as ‘Manifesters’?”

*Answer*:—No; in the cases cited, the Lamp is really the *producer* of the Jar, inasmuch as it produces the jar capable of bringing about its cognition; and it is spoken of as ‘Manifester’, in order to indicate the exact nature of the ‘producing’ done by it.

Such a ‘Manifester’ is not possible in the case of the Veda; because its nature is such that its successive stages of production are not clearly perceptible.—(2418)

Even granting that there can be a ‘Manifester’ of the eternal thing;—such a ‘Manifester’ does not differ from the ‘maker’,—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2419 next*]
