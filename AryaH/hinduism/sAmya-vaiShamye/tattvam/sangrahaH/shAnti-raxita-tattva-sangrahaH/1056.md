> “In the case of the man under an illusion, a verbal statement is found which is quite different from what the man ‘desired to say’; so also in the case of the ‘desire to speak’ in general; hence the verbal statement cannot function (towards bringing about the cognition of any desire to speak)”;—if this is urged,—(then the answer is that) there is clear distinction between words used by the man under an illusion and those used by one who is not under an illusion. Clever men are quite able to discern this difference through the context and such other circumstances.—(1516-1517)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It must be admitted that there is difference between words used by the deluded person and those used by the person not so deluded; otherwise, a difference in the causes would make no difference in their effects. This difference clever men are quite able to discern, through the Context and other circumstances.

‘*Prakṛta*’ stands for the Context in which the words are used.

‘*And other circumstances*’;—this includes the *freedom from confusion*, *happy facial expression* and so forth.—(1516-1517)

*Question*:—“Why should there be a distinction among the words at all?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1518-1519 next*]
