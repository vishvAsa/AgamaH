> The notions of ‘tree’ and such things cannot be based upon the ‘universals’ postulated by the other party;—because things appear in succession, and because they are comprehensive,—like the notions of the ‘cook’ and such things.—the fact that what is eternal cannot be productive (of effects) also serves to annul the opponent’s proposition.—All the objections that were urged against ‘conjunction’ also serve to annul the opponent’s conclusion.—(810-811)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Thus having discredited the whole conception of the ‘Universal’, the Author proceeds to formulate the arguments against it:—[*see verses 810-811 above*]

Notions that are endowed with the properties—of appearing in succession, being comprehensive, being entities, being produced, and so forth—cannot proceed from the eternal, one all-pervading ‘Universal’, as conceived by the other party;—like the notions of the ‘Cook’;—the notions of the ‘Tree’, etc. are of the said character; hence there is perception of a character concomitant with the contrary of the Opponent’s conclusion. As *being in succession* and the rest are all concomitant with *non-eternality*, which is contrary to *eternality* (postulated by the Opponent). What is eternal cannot have any effective action, either successive or simultaneous,—as both are incompatible; hence the Reason adduced by us cannot be regarded as ‘Inconclusive’. As regards the fallacy of our Corroborative Instance being ‘devoid of the Probandum’, that has been already disposed of by us in detail; hence the Instance also cannot be said to be ‘unproven

The Author states another argument in annulment of the Opponent’s conclusion—*All the objections*, *etc*. *etc*.;—these objections were set forth under *Text* 674, above, where it has been shown that oneng cannot subsist in several things; similarly in the section dealing with the *Composite*, under *Text* 607.—(810-811)
