> Because both the facts that have been assumed (and put forward) are such as are not actually apprehended; and for the same reason the corroborative instance also that has been cited has no connection with the probans cited.—(57)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In brief, the Author for the present states his reason only in the form of ‘Non-apprehension’, which annuls the *Naiyāyika’s* argument,—a detailed objection to these two arguments will be provided under the Chapters (10-15) dealing with the Six Categories.

*Both the facts*,—i.e. that have been put forward as the ‘Arrangement’ and the ‘Composite’,—[Both of these are not apprehended] because the ‘Arrangement’ has been regarded as something *visible*, in such statements (by the *Naiyāyika*) as ‘Number, Dimension, Separateness, Conjunction, Disjunction, Higher Universal, the Lower Universal and Action are *visible*, as inhering in coloured substances’,—The ‘Composite’ also has been regarded as *visible*, in the statement—‘There is perception of it because it is large, is made up of several component substances and is coloured—As a matter of fact however, apart from Colour, etc., no other ‘Conjunction’ or ‘Composite’—such as is accepted by the *Naiyāyika*,—ever appears in Consciousness, Thus, while fulfilling the conditions of ‘perceptibility’, if it is not perceived, it must be regarded as non-existent, like the ‘Hare’s Horns’,—It will not be right to argue that—“inasmuch as Atoms are beyond the reach of the Senses, [if there were no suchng as the *Composite* composed of the Atoms], the perception of Colour and other qualities would be impossible”;—because it is admitted that qualified Atoms are apprehensible by the Senses, and hence they are not ‘beyond the reach of the Senses—Thus then, both ‘Conjunction’ and ‘Composite’ being non-existent, the *Jar* that has been cited as the Corroborative Instance *per similarity* is found to be devoid of that character which has been set up as the Probans; this is what is meant by the Text in the words ‘*has no connection with the Probans*, etc,’—(57)
