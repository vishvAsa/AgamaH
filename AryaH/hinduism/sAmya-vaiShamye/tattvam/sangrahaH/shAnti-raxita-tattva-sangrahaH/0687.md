> How could one apprehend the fact of something not being denoted by the word ‘cow’—‘It could be learnt from the fact that the word cow was not found to be applied to it at the moment of the apprehension of the connection of that word’. [This is what the Bauddha may say.]”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 81]—(941)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following text again proceeds to show that there can be no Convention in regard to the *Apoha*:—[*see verse 941 above*]

It behoves you to explain this:—How do you know that the *Horse and other non-Cows* are denoted by the word ‘non-Cow’—i.e. they are *not denoted* by the word ‘Cow’?

The *Bauddha* answers—‘*It could be learnt*, *etc. etc*.’—‘at the *moment*, *etc. etc*.’,—i.e. at the time of the comprehension of the Convention.—(941)

The Opponent (*Kumārila*) rejects this explanation (provided by the Bauddha):—[*see verse 942 next*]
