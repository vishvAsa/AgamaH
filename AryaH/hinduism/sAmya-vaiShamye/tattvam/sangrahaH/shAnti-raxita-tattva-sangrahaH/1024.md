> “Inference for one’s own sake cannot be right,—because it is brought about by the three-featured indicative, which is subversive of what is desirable,—like wrong cognition.—nor can the presence of the ‘three features’ in the indicative be regarded as the means of inference; as they are present also where there is no inference,—just like the ‘two features’.—Further, the contradiction of inference is possible in every reasoning; so also there is possibility in every case of the inferring of mutually contradictory conclusions; and there is possibility of finding a reason which is concomitant (not-separable) with the contrary of the desired conclusion (deduced from an inference).”—(1457-1459)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The *Cārvākas* urge the following arguments (against Inference, as a Means of Right Cognition):—[*see verses 1457-1459 above*]

*Inference for one’s own sake* cannot be right,—because it is brought about by the three-featured Indicative,—like the Wrong Cognition. [Here is a Wrong Cognition based upon a three-featured Indicative]—‘The eye and other organs are for the purpose of other persons, because they are composite things; like the Couch, the Seat and such things’; this is a wrong cognition, being subversive of a desirable idea, but brought about by a three-featured Indicative; and like this the Inference in question also is brought about by a three-featured Indicative, and hence it must be wrong.

*Nor can the presence of the Three Features in the Indicative be the means of Inference*; because, like the *Two Features*, they are present also where there is no Inference.

Further, in every reasoning, *contradiction of Inference* would be possible; for example, it would always be possible to put forward the Inference that ‘The intended Probandum cannot reside in the Subject (Minor Term), because it is a part of the aggregate of all these several factors, like the form of the Minor Term itself’;—and this would put an end to all Inferences.

Then again, in all cases, when an Inference has been put forward, there is always a possibility of several undesirable contingencies being put forward; for instance, when the Inference has been put forward that ‘Sound is non-eternal, because it is a product, like the Jar’,—some one might set up the argument to the contrary, that ‘just as the reason asserted proves the *non-eternality* of Bound, so does it also prove the fact of its not being the quality of *Ākāśa*’, and so forth.

Lastly, in every case, it is possible *to find a Reason that is concomitant with the contrary of the desired Conclusion*; for instance, the inference having been put forward, that ‘Sound is non-eternal, because it is a product, like the Jar’, some one may put forward the following reasoning which is concomitant with (and proves) the contrary of this conclusion—‘Sound is *eternal*, because it is perceptible by the Ear, like the universal *Sound*’. Several such examples may be found in the *Tattvaṭīkā*.—(1457-1459)
