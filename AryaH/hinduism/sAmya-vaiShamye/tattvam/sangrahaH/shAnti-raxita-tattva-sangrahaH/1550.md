> The absence of the means of cognition does not necessarily mean the absence of the object of cognition; because the latter are not causes with which the former is invariably concomitant.—(2412)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mimāṃsaka* under 2095, above, that ‘the author of the Veda’ is not cognisable by any of the five Means of Knowledge, etc. etc.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2412 above*]

What is meant by this the most important argument (of the *Mīmāṃsaka*) is ‘inadmissible’,

It is only what is all-pervading, e.g. the *Cause*, which, being absent, indicates the absence of the less pervasive, e.g. the *Effect*; because these two are related to each other—the all-pervasive to the less pervasive, by the relation of co-essentiality, and the Cause to the Effect by the relation of the one being produced by the other;—and for you, the *effect* and the *less-pervasive factor* cannot be present when their correlatives are not there.—As regards the Means of Cognition, they cannot be *pervasive over*, and the Cause of, all things. For instance, it is quite possible for a thing far removed in time and place and nature, to exist even without the Means of Cognition applying to it; hence the said Means of Cognition cannot be pervasive over all things. Nor can the Means of Cognition be regarded as the *Cause* of all things, for the same reason; specially as it is the other way about, the *Means* of Cognition itself being the effect or product of the *Objects* of Cognition. And yet when the Effect is absent, it does not imply the Absence of the Cause; as such a premiss is found to be false. And what is neither the Cause nor all-pervasive cannot indicate the absence of its correlatives; as, if it did, there would be incongruities.

Thus it is established that in the proving of the absence of the *Object* of Cognition only, the absence of the Means of Cognition only, if cited as a Reason, is clearly ‘inconclusive’ and wrong.—(2412)

The same ‘Inconclusiveness’ is further confirmed by the possibility of the Reason in the Contrary of the Probandum:—[*see verse 2413 next*]
