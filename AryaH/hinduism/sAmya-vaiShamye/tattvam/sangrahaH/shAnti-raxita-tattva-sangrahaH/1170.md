> The relation of ‘cause and effect’ is nothing other than that one thing is produced only when the other is there; nor is non-existence known to be any thing other than the ‘non-perception’ of what is perceptible.—(1697)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the case of ‘Ratiocination’, there is no difference between the *Probam and the Probandum*; because the *reason* (Probans) is the *fact of one thing being produced only when the other is there*,—the *relation of Cause and Effect* is the Probandum; and we find no difference between these two; the two are synonymous, like the terms ‘*taru*’ and ‘*pādapa*’ (both meaning *Tree*).

*In* the case of ‘Non-apprehension’ also, there is no difference between the Cause and the Effect. For instance, if mere *absence of apprehension* is meant (by ‘Non-apprehension’), then as nothing like it is known, it would be open to the Infinite Regress and other objections urged above. If, on the other hand, the ‘Non-apprehension’ of a thing is only the ‘apprehension of something else’, then it becomes included under ‘the Non-apprehension of what should have been apprehended’; and this does not prove the *non-existence*, which is cognised by Perception itself. It is for this reason that the text has declared—‘*Nor is non-existence*, *etc. etc*.’—(1697)
