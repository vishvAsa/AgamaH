> The direct form (of Apoha) having been explained as above, absolute negation also is apprehended by implication,—in the form that the nature of this thing is not the nature of the other thing.—When there is connection (of the word) with certain things, there comes about, by implication, the apprehension of ‘excluded’ things also.—Hence this also is figuratively spoken of as the ‘denotation’ of the word,—these two kinds of verbal Apoha are not directly spoken of as such.—(1013-1015)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been shown that *Apoha*, in the form of ‘Reflection’, being brought about directly by words, forms the *primary* denotation of words. The Author now proceeds to show that there would be nothing incongruous in describing the other two kinds of *Apoha* (described under 1007-1008) as forming the *secondary* (indirect) ‘denotation of words’:—[*see verse 1013-1015 above*]

‘*As above*’,—as something brought about.

*Question*:—“How is Absolute Negation apprehended by implication?”

*Answer*;—*That the nature, etc*. *etc*.—That is, on the basis of the fact that the nature of *this thing*—the reflection of the Cow—is not the nature of *the other thing*—the reflection of the Horse and other things.

Having thus shown that the notion of the *Apoha* in the shape of Absolute Negation forms, on the ground of invariable concomitance, the secondary denotation of words, the Author proceeds to assert the same in regard to ‘Specific Individuality’ also:—‘*When there is connection*, *etc. etc?*;—the ‘connection’ of the Word with the object meant here is the indirect one of invariable concomitance in the shape of that of *Cause and Effect*; in the following way:—First of all there is the apprehension of the object as it stands; then the speaker’s desire to speak of it; then the movement of his palate and other organs of Speech; then the utterance of the word; in this way when there is this indirect connection between the word and the objects spoken of—such as Fire and the like,—then there follows the cognition, through Presumption, of the object as ‘excluded from unlike things

Thus both these kinds of *Apoha*,—Absolute Negation and that in the form *excluded* *from others*,—are figuratively spoken of as *denoted*, by the word.
