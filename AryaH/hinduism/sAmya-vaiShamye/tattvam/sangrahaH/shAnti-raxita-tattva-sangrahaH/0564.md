## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Śaṅkara-svāmin* argues as follows:—“The comprehensive idea of the *Cook* is based upon the presence of that particular *Action* which is related to the ‘Universal’ (or Genus) ‘Action’; hence, even after the actual act of *cooking* has ceased, the permanent basis of it (in the shape of the Universal) is always there, and from that there arises the idea of the *Cook*”,—This view is anticipated in the following—[*see verses 755 above*]
