> In some cases, there is absolute deterioration of things that obstruct the perception of truth, as is found in the case of the external as well as internal darkness. when there is deterioration of this, true knowledge appears untrammelled and proceeds to apply to the whole circle of knowable things.—(3419-3420)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Or, things that serve as obstacles to the Perception of Truth are liable to absolute deterioration,—e.g. the external and nocturnal darkness,—and Afflictions and Wrong notions of things, etc, are obstacles to the perception of Truth; so that this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.

That this Reason is not ‘Inconclusive’ is pointed out by the words—‘*when there is deterioration of this*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*of this*’—of the internal darkness (of Ignorance).—(3419-3420)
