## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* points out that this view, being in due accord with reason, deserves to be accepted:—[*see verse 2723 above*]

If all Remembrances appeared only in a certain order of sequence,—then, in connection with things seen one after the other, there could be no such conception of them at one and the same time as is involved in the idea of ‘a hundred’ and so forth; nor would there be any difference in the conceptions of the ‘hundred’ and the ‘million’ and so forth,—at the time of their appearance.—(2723)
