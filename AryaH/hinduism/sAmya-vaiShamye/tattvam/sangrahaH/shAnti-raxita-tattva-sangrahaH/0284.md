> When a certain thing does not need any other cause for the bringing about op a certain condition, that condition should be regarded as attaching to it permanently,—because, out op its own causes, that thing appears in that condition;—just as the causal conditions are independently, by themselves, capable of producing their effect;—and all the things that are produced are independent op all else in the matter op their destruction.—(354-355)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The argument is to be formulated as follows:—When certain things are independent in regard to a certain condition, they should be regarded as permanently attached to that condition:—as for example, the causal conditions that produce their effect immediately, are permanently restricted to those effects;—*all things that are produced*,—i.e. all created things—are independent in regard to their destruction; hence this is a natural reason (for concluding that they are permanently attached to this destruction).—‘*Any other Cause*’,—i.e. any cause other than that which has produced the thing itself.—The reason for this statement is added—*because out of its own causes, it appears in that form*;—i.e. because it is produced in a form so permanently attached to the said condition.'—When certain things are not permanently attached to a certain condition, they are not independent in regard to that condition; as for instance, the *unbaked* jar in reference to the *Baking*. This forms the corroborative instance *per dissimilarity*.—(354-355)
