> “(A) Colour and other qualities are entirely different from the lotus and other things,—because they are distinguished by these (latter)—just as the horse is distinguished by caitra (the rider).—(B) Or, the earth and other substances are entirely different from colour, odour and other qualities because they are differently spoken of by means of words in the singular and plural numbers (respectively),—just as the ‘moon’ (singular) and the ‘stars’ (plural) are different.”—(559-560)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been explained above that the distinction between the Substance and its Quality is vouched for by Perception itself; in the following *Texts*, they proceed to show that it is proved by Inference also:—[*see verses 559-560 above*]

The Quality is different from the Lotus, because they are spoken of as ‘the Qualities of the Lotus’, where the Qualities are *distinguished* by the *Lotus*; just as in the expression ‘Caitra’s horse’, the Horse is distinguished—i.e. differentiated—from other riders, by *Caitra*, and is therefore different from him.

Each of the Substances,—Earth, Water, Fire and Air,—are different from (the Qualities) Colour, Taste, Odour and Touch,—because they are spoken of by means of words in the Singular and Plural numbers (respectively),—just as the *Moon* and the *Stars*; just as ‘Moon’ being in the Singular number and the ‘Stars’ in the Plural number form the basis of difference between them, so also ‘Earth’ is in the Singular number, and the compound ‘Colour-Taste-Odour-Touch’ is in the Plural number; similarly ‘Water’, - Air’ and ‘Fire’ also.

The several ‘Stars’ meant are *Puṣya* and the rest.—(559-560)
