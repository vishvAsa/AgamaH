> “The terms ‘horse’ and the rest do not bring about the cognition of the Apoha; and the idea of the qualified that is held in this connection cannot be one in which the qualification is not cognised.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 88]—(948)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As a matter of fact, the cognition of the *Horse* and other *non-cows* does not apprehend the *Apoha*; it apprehends a positive *entity*; and thus there being no possibility of the *Apoha* being cognised, it cannot colour the Horse, etc. with its own cognition.

It might be urged that—“Even without being itself cognised, the *Apoha* could be the qualification”.

The answer to this is that ‘*the Idea of the qualified*, *etc. etc*.’;—there can never be a cognition of the *qualified* thing of which the *qualification* is not apprehended.—(948)
