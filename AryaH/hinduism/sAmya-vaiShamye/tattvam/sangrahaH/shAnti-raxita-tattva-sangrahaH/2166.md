> His knowledge does not consist in the direct perception of his pure self; because that is devoid of the characteristics of the ‘cognisable’, as has been proved in detail.—If the soul (self) is held to be of the nature of cognition (consciousness),—there can be no apprehension of it as such; because of the difference between the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing’,—if then the said cognition is held to be self-illumined, then it comes to be ‘self-cognition’, and as such it would mean that the cognition is amenable to direct perception.—(3544-3546)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 3207, that—“His knowledge consists in the direct perception of His pure Self, and when the source of that knowledge is not pure, the knowledge itself is called *Ignorance*”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3544-3546 above*]

If the Soul is held to be *unconscious* in its essence, then the Cognition that apprehends it must be regarded as *impure*; as it has been proved under the chapter on the ‘External World’ that by their very nature, all Cognitions are devoid of the *apprehended* and the *apprehended*

If, on the other hand, the Soul is held to be of the nature of Consciousness itself, then there would be non-difference between what is *seen* (cognised, i.e. the *soul*) and the *seeing* (Cognition, Consciousness); so that they could not be related to each other as the *apprehended* and the *apprehender*; which would mean that the Cognition could not be regarded as apprehending the Soul. Because it is only when there is some difference between the subject and the object that they can bear to each other the relation of the *apprehender* and the *apprehended*.

If, lastly, the idea is that, being luminous, like the lamp, the Cognition apprehends and envisages itself,—then there would be ‘self-Cognition’, which you do not admit; and it would set aside your idea that Cognition cannot be *perceived*. This is what is shown by the words—*It would mean that Cognition is amenable to direct Perception*’.—(3544-3546)
