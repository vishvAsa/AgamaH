> “Having seen the cow, when the man goes to the forest and sees the *gavaya*, bearing a manifold commonalty (similitude, to the cow) in several parts of the body, but with rounded neck (not with the dewlap);—the first cognition that he has of the *gavaya* is one that apprehends only its shape; and this cognition is purely perceptional. the cognition that follows is in the more determinate form—“the shape of this animal is similar to the cow’s”; and this also comes about only when the operation of the senses is there; so that this also is regarded to be perceptional.”—(1528-1530)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having seen the Cow previously, the man, later on, goes to the forest and sees the *Gavaya*,—of what sort?—*bearing a manifold commonalty in several parts of the body*,—i.e. he thinks that many parts of its body are similar,—*but with a rounded neck*,—i.e. without the *dewlap* (which is the distinctive feature of the Cow),—then the first cognition that appears is of the non-conceptual (non-determinate) kind, which apprehends only the general shape of the *Gavaya*; and this Cognition is pure Perception.—That cognition also which appears later on,—in the form ‘this animal is similar to the Cow’—which is more specifically conceptual,—is also pure Perception; as it is brought about by the operation of the senses.—(1528-1530)

The following might be urged against the above—‘The cognition that appears is through Remembrance, as envisaging the *similarity*,—and not through the operation of the senses’.—

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1531 next*]
