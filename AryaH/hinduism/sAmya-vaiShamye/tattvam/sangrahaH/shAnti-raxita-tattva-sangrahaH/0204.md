> Even fire is not always a ‘burner’ of all combustible things; otherwise the whole (world) would be instantly reduced to ashes.—(255)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text is going to show that the instance of Fire that has been cited (in *Text* 243) is itself ‘unproven’ (not admitted by all parties):—[*see verse 255 above*]

The Fire, in the form of the burner of all combustible things, is not always existent; if it were, then all combustiblengs would be reduced to ashes,—because they would always have their burner in contact with them,—like that combustible thing which is in actual contact with the fixe-flame.

‘*Even*’, ‘*api*’, is meant to indicate that it is not only Cognition that cannot be of the nature of the apprehension of all things.—(255)

*Objection*—“If that is so, then Fire is *not always* of the nature of the *Burner* (possessed of the power to burn); how then could it burn even the thing that is presented to it?”

The answer is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 256 next*]
