That is to say, even a barbarian who knows nothing of the distinction of ‘*Sapakṣa*’ etc., when it is stated to him that ‘where there is smoke, there is

Fire,—and there is smoke at this place’,—he grasps the positive and negative concomitance between *Smoke* and *Fire*, and hence comes to recognise that ‘Fire is there’,—without knowing anything about the ‘*Sapakṣa*’ and other details.—Hence it follows that at the time of the actual proving, there need he no distinction as regards the ‘*Sapakṣa*’ and the rest.
