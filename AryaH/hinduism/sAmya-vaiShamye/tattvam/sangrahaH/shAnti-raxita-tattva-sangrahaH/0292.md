> The view that ‘negation’ is brought by an ‘affirmation’ has been sought to be supported by haying recourse to ‘preclusion’ (as the form of the negation so brought about);—but the argument based upon the alternatives possible regarding difference or non-difference, all become applicable to this view.—(365)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘How is Negation brought about by Affirmation?’ In answer to this question the other party has recourse to ‘Preclusion’, i.e. the assertion that it is Negation in the form of ‘Preclusion’ that is so brought about; that is to say, through the speaker’s choice sometimes even an *entity* is spoken of as a different *form* (negation) of some other entity. With this explanation also the view is open to all those arguments that have been urged above as based upon the alternatives of ‘difference’ or ‘non-difference’ etc.—(365)
