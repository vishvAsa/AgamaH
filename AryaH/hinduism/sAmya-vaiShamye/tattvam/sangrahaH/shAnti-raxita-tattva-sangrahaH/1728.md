> In all cases, positive and negative concomitances are definitely known to be the ground for regarding one thing as the effect of another; and it is thus that the invariable concomitance is recognised in the case in question.—(2733)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Kāryatā, etc. etc*.’—Being regarded as the cause, or basis, of being regarded as the *effect*.

“What is that basis?”

It is *positive and negative concomitance*.—This is co-ordinated with ‘*aṅgam*—The only basis for one thing being regarded as the *effect* of another lies in following the positive and negative concomitance between the two things. Hence the impossibility of there being any other basis for regarding the ‘cognition of the meaning’ as the effect of anything else (other than the Cognition of Letters) provides the proof for the annulment of a contrary conclusion. Hence the necessary Invariable Concomitance between the two becomes established.—(2733)
