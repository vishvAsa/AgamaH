> “Thus, like light, the Veda being the ‘eye’ for all men,—the hostility that arises against it among some people, is like the hostility of the owl (to light),—and is the effect of their demerit”.—(2351)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

When the Sun, which is the common Eye of all, has dispelled all darkness by its mass of effulgent rays and shines all round,—colour does not become visible to the owl which has its Eye inefficient in the performing of its functions; in the same way, people like the Buddhists, whose Eyes of Intelligence have become disabled by Demerit, have their vision obstructed,—even when the one common Eye of all people, in the shape of the *Veda*, is there.

The particle ‘*Kila*’ is meant to indicate *displeasure*.

[Here ends the case for the Reliability of the Veda, the Revealed Word.—Next follow the arguments against the Reliability of the Revealed Word, Veda.]
