> Thus, inasmuch as there can be no cognition of the meaning (of the Veda),—how can there be any ‘unshake ability’ in that cognition? it could be possible only on the basis of conventions; and in this, it would not be different from the words of human beings. in fact, persons well-versed in the science of reasoning do not recognise any difference between these two.—It can be ‘unshakeable’ only for the śrotriyas who are ignorant of the ways of reasoning.—(1508-1509)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus proved that the first definition (provided under 1489) of *Verbal Cognition* is impossible,—the Author proceeds to sum up his argument and show the ‘inadmissibility’ of the Probans put up by the Opponent (under 1499) to the effect that ‘it brings about unshakeable cognitions’:—[*see verses 1508-1509 above*]

If the Veda is not the work of a human author, then, as shown above, there can be no comprehension of its meaning; how then could the cognition brought about by it be ‘unshakeable’? The meaning that is actually found to be comprehended from the words of the Veda must be one based upon Conventions, as has been shown above, under *Text* 1504. Hence it can only be through Conventions. Specially because the words of the Veda do not differ from the words of human beings; that is, they do not differ from human assertions.

Why this is so is explained in the words—‘*In fact*, *persons well-versed*, *etc. etc*.’

‘*Between these two*’,—i.e. between words in the Veda and words emanating from men.—In every way the words can be brought about by men, and hence the Vedic words cannot differ from the words of men.

‘*It can be, etc, etc*.’.—In this the Author ridicules the *Śrotriyas (Mīmāṃsakas*).—(1508-1509)
