> ‘Being an entity’ is said to consist in ‘capacity for effective, action’; if this were all-pervasive, then every thing would be capable of doing every thing. Generally, one thing is held to be productive of another, only by reason of the, presence, in it, of the capacity for that action; if then, that capacity is equally present in another thing, why should not this be productive of the same?—If the ‘blue’ and other objects themselves are held to constitute the all-embracing character of ‘entity’, then the white and yellow things also would do what is done by the blue one; and in that case, the whole universe would become a single ‘entity devoid of a second; and thus it would not be true that a single thing has several aspects.—If the blue, etc. themselves do not constitute ‘entity’,—and this is like the ‘being’ (*sattva*) posited by ‘Kaṇāda’,—then it cannot be as you hold, that one thing cannot have several aspects; as there would be clear difference—Further, what constitutes ‘difference’ among things is the presence of contrary properties, and no other kind of ‘difference’ is held to lie between ‘blue’ and ‘yellow this same condition is present between the ‘general’ and the ‘particular’; because while the former is ‘inclusive’, the latter is otherwise. Why then should not ‘difference’ be admitted as clearly lying between them?—(1738-1744)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (by the *Jaina* writer, under *Text* 1716) that—“in the form of entities all things are not-different from one another.”—This is answered in the following—[*see verses 1738-1744 above*]

The ‘Entity’ is said to be that which is capable of effective action,—nothing else.—If this capacity is present in all things, then every thing would be capable of doing every thing, It is only in this sense that things are held to be *productive*. This *capacity* then being equally present in all cases, anything might be produced out of anything.

Further, is the ‘Entity’ the same as the *Blue*, the *Yellow* and other things? Or is it something different?—If it is the same, then, as it would be all-pervasive, even the *white* and *yellow* could bring about the colouring in the cloth that is brought about by the *Blue*.—Then again, there being no other character or nature possible, the entire Universe would become a single conglomeration of things; and this would upset the proposition that a single entity has several aspects.—If on the other hand, the ‘entity’ is something different, from the *Blue*, etc.,—like the ‘Being’ posited by *Kaṇāda*,—i.e. just as *Kaṇāda* has postulated the ‘Entity’, called ‘Being’,—as something different (from the particular things),—then it becomes all the more unreasonable to attribute ‘Plurality’ to any single thing; as in this case there would be clear absolute difference.

Then again, any two things are ‘different’ only when they have contrary poperties,—e.g. *Hot* and *Cold*;—the General and the Particular are found to have contrary properties; *because while the former is* ‘*inclusive*’, *the latter is otherwise*; ‘*otherwise*’—i.e. *not-Inclusive*, ‘exclusive’.—If, even on the presence of contrary properties, difference were not admitted, then there would be no difference even between the *Blue* and the *Yellow*, which is admitted in some way, by the other party;—*Kumārila* himself having declared (in *Ślokavārtika*—Sense Perception, 158) that—“as their cognitions are different, Colour, etc., cannot be one and the same”;—where it has been declared that there is difference among the *Blue* and other things.—(1738-1744)
