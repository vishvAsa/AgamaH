> Thus, Manu and other teachers, not knowing who were real Brāhmaṇas, could not have imparted the teachings to Brāhmaṇas alone: because they could not be sure of it.—(3581)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, it is not only for yourselves that it is not right to indulge in arrogance due to your Brāhmaṇa-hood, which is open to doubt; as regards Manu and other teachers also,—as they could not know who were real Brāhmaṇas, the Teachings, if imparted to Brāhmaṇas alone, must have been imparted under a delusion.—This is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3581 above*]

‘*Avijñāta*’—Those who could not bo sure of the *Brāhmaṇa-hood* of any one.

‘*Tadaniścayāt*’—Because they could not be sure of people being *Brāhmaṇas*.—(3581)
