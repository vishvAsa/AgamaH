> “As a matter of fact, the existence of the thing at the present time (of recognition) has not been included under the previous cognition; this is a peculiar feature in recognition, which is not present in remembrance. Remembrance is in the form of ‘that’ and appertains only to that which has been already cognised before; recognition however is in the form ‘this is that same’, which is something totally different (from the previous cognition).”—(452-453)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* urge—from Kumārila’s standpoint [*vide Ślokavārtika*—Perception, Ślo. 234]—the argument that “Recognition does not apprehend what has been already apprehended”:—[*see verses 452-453 above*]

*Kumārila* has argued as follows:—“The previous Cognition has not apprehended *the existence of the Thing at the present time* (of Recognition); as it could not appear in the form ‘this is the same as that’; hence there is a difference between Recognition and Remembrance.—“How?”—Remembrance always appears in the form of ‘That’ which takes in only that much of the Thing as has been cognised before; while Recognition takes in the idea of ‘This’ also (being in the form ‘*This* is the same as *that*’), which is an additional feature of theng concerned. To this extent, Recognition is something different from *Remembrance*. Thus Recognition acquires the character of a real ‘Means of Right Cognition’, after having shaken off the Doubt and Mistake in regard to it.”—(452-453)

He proceeds to show in what way it shakes off the Doubt and Mistake:—[*see verse 454 next*]
