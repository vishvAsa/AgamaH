> This reason is not admissible against the doctrine that ‘cognition (consciousness) alone exists’; as (under that view) what is cognised (by the cognition) is the appearance of itself; as in the case of the man with defective vision.—Further, cognition is always found to be destroyed immediately after appearance; if then, the body with the cognition is of the same nature as the cognition,—why is it not regarded as momentary?—(1911-1912)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—“If this is so, then nothing can prevent the doctrine of Pure Idealism—(that there is Cognition or Consciousness alone)—also being rejected on these same grounds”.

The Answer to that is as follows:—[*see verses 1911-1912 above*]

‘*This Reason is not admissible*’;—i.e. the Reason, if so applied, becomes subject to the objection of being ‘inadmissible’. For instance, the fact of ‘being cognised by both’ cannot be admitted by the Idealist; as for him what is cognised by the Cognition is always its own appearance; as in the case of the man of defective vision seeing *two moons*.

Then again, when a particular object is cognised, the Cognition is clearly found to disappear immediately after its appearance; hence, if the Body were held to be of the same nature as the Cognition, it should have to be regarded as *momentary* (like the Cognition).—(1911-1912)
