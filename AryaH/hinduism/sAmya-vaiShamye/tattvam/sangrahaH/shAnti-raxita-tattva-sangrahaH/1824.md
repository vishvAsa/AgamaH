> “Such corroboration (by other means of cognition) does not form the basis of the validity of other cognitions also; because among cognitions envisaging the same thing, there can be only option,—which means that validity can belong to only one of them.”—(2898)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Other Means of Cognitions*’,—i.e. the Means of Cognition other than the Veda,—i.e. Sense-perception and the rest.

‘*Tulyārthānām*’—bearing upon one and the same thing.

‘*To only one*’—the one appearing first of all; the other being only reiterative.

The validity of this first Cognition cannot be due to the other subsequent cognitions; because these latter are themselves invalid, inasmuch as they apprehend what has been already apprehended.—(2898)
