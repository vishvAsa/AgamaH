> If, on the other hand, the objects were, by their nature, of the nature of the ‘immobile entity’,—then absence of going should be there always, and there would be no movement of any kind even for a moment. because, even when going might be there, the object would still be of the nature of the ‘immobile entity’,—because it will not have renounced its previous nature,—just as at the time when it was not moving.—(701-702)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If, from fear of the above criticism, it be held that the object, by its nature, is *immobile*,—then the *absence of going*, etc. should be there always; because the object is of the same form always,—like *Ākāśa*.

The particle ‘*ādi*’, ‘etc.’; is meant to include the actions of *Throwing up* and the rest.

Under such circumstances, even when there would be actual *going*, etc., the object would be *immobile*; because it has not renounced its *Immobile nature*,—exactly as in the unmoving condition.

‘*Praspanda*’ is Action.

In the term ‘*niścalātmakakālavat*’, the ‘*Vati*’—affix has been added to the compound with the Locative ending—[the meaning being ‘as *at* the time, etc. etc.’]—(701-702)
