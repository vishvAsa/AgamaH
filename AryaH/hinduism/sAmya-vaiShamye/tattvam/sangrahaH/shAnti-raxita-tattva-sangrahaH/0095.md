## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“How do you prove that there is ‘self-contradiction’ (incongruity) in a thing operating upon itself?”

The answer is given in the following Text:—[*see verse 108 above*]

When the ‘nature’ or ‘essence’ of the Effect produces itself,—is it itself an established entity or not? It cannot be an established entity; because*under the circumstances*, the said ‘essence’ is nothing apart from the established form; so that the recognition is as established as the ‘essence’ itself. Hence, as there would be nothing*to be produced*, whereupon could the Entity operate?—(108)
