## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus proved that the ‘External Object’ is devoid of the nature of ‘many’, the *Text* proceeds to show that it cannot have the nature of ‘one’:—[*see verse 1998 above*]

Those people who admit of the Gross Object, even though not composed of Atoms,—for them, like the Atom, the Gross Object also could not be regarded as one, because of ‘the diversity of its facings’; because if it were *one* entity, then the shaking of the hand or the limbs would lead to the shaking of the whole body.—As this is quite clear, and was threshed out on several occasions, the Author has not pointed out here any objections to this view.

Thus the Reason—*that which is devoid of the nature of one and many*, etc. etc.’—which has been put forward by us, for proving that there can be no activity in regard to ‘external objects’,—is one that cannot be regarded as' ‘inadmissible’, And when that is ‘admissible’, the Earth and other external things apprehended should be treated as *non-existent*. And when the Earth, etc. cannot be ‘apprehended’, the fact of the Cognition being the ‘*apprehender*’, assumed on the basis of the apprehension of those things, also, becomes proved to be inadmissible. Thus it becomes established that all this is mere ‘Idea’ (has a purely subjective existence).—(1998)
