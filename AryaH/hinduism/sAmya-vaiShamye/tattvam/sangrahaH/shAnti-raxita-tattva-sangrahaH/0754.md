> For instance, colour is spoken of as an ‘obstacle’ and also as ‘visible’;—and sound is spoken of as ‘cognised after effort’, and also as ‘auditory’ or ‘audible—(1040)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Colour is spoken of as an ‘obstacle’ when it prevents the appearance of another colour in its own place; and it is also spoken of as ‘visible’,—because it serves to bring about visual perception.

A second example is cited ‘*And Sound, etc*. *etc?*;—even though sound is a single entity, yet, on being the resultant of the cognition following upon effort (of the speaker), it is spoken of as ‘Cognised’; and as the resultant of auditory perception, it is spoken of as ‘auditory’; ‘*śravaṇa*’ stands for ‘*śruti*’, audition, i.e. Auditory Perception; and what appears therein is ‘auditory’, Or the term ‘*śrāvaṇa*’ may be explained as ‘perceived by the auditory organ’,—(1040)
