> “If the effect were non-existent, potentially, in the form of the cause,—then it could not be produced; because it would have no form at all, being like the sky-lotus.”—(8)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“How is it known that the Effect (Product) exists even before-it is produced?”

*Answer*—For proving the existence of the Effect (even prior to its production), the other Philosophers (*Sāṃkhyas*) have put forward the following five reasons (as stated in *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, 9)—“(1) Because what is non-existent cannot be produced,—(2) because there is always recourse to the Cause,—(3) because all things are not possible,—(4) because the efficient can produce only that for which it is efficient,—and (5) because the Effect is of the essence of the Cause,—therefore the Effect must be existent (even before it is produced).” (I) In support of the *first* reason, the following explanation has been provided (by the Text) in the words—*If the Effect were non-existent*, *etc*.—That is to say, if the Effect did not already exist in the form of the Cause, even prior to its production, then it could not be produced; as it would be like the *Sky-lotus* (a non-entity). This reasoning is formulated as follows What is non-existent cannot be produced,—as for instance, the *Sky-lotus,*.—prior to its production, the Effect is non-existent, according to the other party,—hence the acceptance of the other party’s view would lead to a contingency contrary to the universal proposition (set forth above as the Major Premiss);—as a matter of fact, no such contingency does arise;—hence it becomes established that whatever effect is produced in the shape of such Effects as *Oil* and the like, by such causes as *Sesamum* and the like, did exist even before the said production.”

*Potentially*—i.e. in the form of the latent potency; as regards actual appearance (manifestation), even the followers of Kapila do not regard the Effect to have existed prior (to the actual production).

*Because it would have no form at all*,—which means that, if the Effect had no existence, then it could not have any form at all.—(8)
