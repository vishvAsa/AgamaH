> If primordial matter operates towards bringing about the diversified creation, in accordance with the (spirit’s) ‘desire to see’ and the rest,—then how can it be insentient?—(299)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, if Primordial Matter *knew* of the Spirit’s ‘desire to see’ etc,—then it might be resonable to regard its activity to be for the sake of the Spirit, and to be in accordance with his ‘desire to see’ etc.;—as a matter of fact, however, the said Matter is itself *insentient*,—even when in contact with the Sentient Spirit;—it cannot then be right to regard its activity as brought about as by the contact of the Lame and the Blind. Because even though the Blind man does not see the road, yet he knows of the Lame man’s desire, because he is himself *sentient*. Primordial Matter however cannot *know* the Spirit’s ‘desire to see’ etc., because being insentient by its very nature, it is *unconscious*.—Nor is it possible for these two—Spirit and Primordial Matter—to be related like the Lame and the Blind,—as there can be no mutual benefit in their case.—(299)
