> It is through these that the instrumental ending becomes useful; so that the meaning comes to be that the conceptual content becomes connected with the name, through the instrumentality of the universal, etc.—(1225)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The particular thing spoken as ‘Cow’ is that which is connected with that Name through the Instrumentality of the Universal; similarly, through the instrumentality of the Quality, etc. It is in this sense that the Universal, etc. become the *Instrument* (of Connection), and thus the Instrumental Ending becomes useful.

*Question*:—“If that is so, then how are the words (of Diṅnāga)—‘*nāmajātyādiyojanā*’—to be construed?”

*Answer*:—‘*It is through these*, *etc. etc*.’, That is the words are to be construed as ‘*nāmnaḥ jātyādibhiḥ yojanā*’, [‘connection *with the Universal*, *etc,, of* the Name’].

‘*Seyam*’—This stands for the *Conceptual Content* itself, which is implied by the force of the compound, which is to be explained as follows:—‘*Jātyādiyojanā*’ means ‘*jātyādibhiḥ yojanā*’, ‘connection with the Universal, etc.’; ‘*nāmajātyādiyojanā*’ means ‘*nāmnaḥ jātyadiyojanā*’, ‘connection *with* the Universal, etc., *of* the Name—(1225)

*Objection*:—“If that is so, then in the case of Proper Names, there would be nothing to denote the Universal, etc., and hence the said explanation cannot apply to their case.”

In anticipation of this objection, the Author provides the following answer:—[*see verse 1226 next*]
