> If it be argued that—“in this case there is the relation of qualification—and—qualified”,—then the answer is that such a relation is assumed only when some other relation is already there; for instance, the relation of qualification and qualified is assumed on the basis of the close proximity (contact) between the two factors concerned; in the absence of such contact, the relation in question cannot be possible, as there would be no basis for it.—(783-784)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Uddyotakara* has argued as follows:—“The relation between the Universal ‘Jar’ with the particular Jar is of the nature of *Inherence*, while the relation of Negations is of the nature of *Qualification and Qualified*; so in both cases the ‘*relation* of the same thing’ is the basis for the common name”.

The answer to this is that ‘*Such a relation*, *etc., etc*.’; that is, the relation of *Qualification and Qualified* among Entities is always brought about by some other relation; e.g. the relation of *Qualification and Qualified* between *Devadatta* and his *stick* is due to *conjunction* (contact) between them, and the same between the *King* and his *officer* is due to the relation of *Master and Servant*. In the case of Negations however, there is no such other Relation which could form the basis of the relation of *Qualification and Qualified*; how then could any such relation be possible? If it were possible, then there would be an absurdity; everything could be the qualification of everything’,—(783-784)

The question then arising as to—“how, in the absence of any other relation, such notions are current among people as ‘the Prior Negation of the Jar’? the following *Texts* supply the answer—[*see verses 785-786 next*]
