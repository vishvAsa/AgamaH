> In reality, it does not exist in the form in which it is apprehended; hence it cannot be positive. nor is it negative, as it is apprehended as an entity.—(1190)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

By deluded people it is apprehended as something *external*, and yet it does not exist in that form; and as having no external form, it is not Positive.

*Question*:—“Why cannot it be *negative*?”

*Answer*:—‘*Nor is it negative*, *became it is apprehended as an entity*’; and yet, as it presents itself as something *external*, it cannot be said to be entirely *negative*.—(1190)

*Question*:—“Why cannot *Apoha* be of the nature of ‘diversity’ or of ‘sameness’?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1191 next*]
