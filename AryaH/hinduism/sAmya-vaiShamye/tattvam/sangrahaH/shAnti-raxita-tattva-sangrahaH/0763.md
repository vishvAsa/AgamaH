> It would be only a few things which, while being diverse by themselves, would bring about a single determinate judgment; as already explained by us.—(1051)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“In the absence of some one *Commonalty*, how can the things that bring about a single determinate judgment become diverse?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1051 above*]

It has been explained in course of our examination of the ‘Universal’ that the *Dhātrī* (Āmalakī and other fruits), without commonalty, come to perform a single fruitful action; in the same way, it would be only a few things that would bring about the single determinate judgment and yet be many and diverse.—(1051)
