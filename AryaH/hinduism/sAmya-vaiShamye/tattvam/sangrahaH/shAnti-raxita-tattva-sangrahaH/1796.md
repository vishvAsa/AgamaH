> “When the validity of the *pramāṇas* is described as ‘inherent’,—what is meant is that what is ‘inherent’ (self-sufficient) is their activity towards the bringing about of their effect, after they have themselves come into existence.”—(2847)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* continues the discussion on the real meaning of the Proposition of the *Mīmāṃsaka*:—[*see verse 2847 above*]

What is meant is as follows:—“By the phrase ‘self-validity’ it is meant that after the *Pramāṇas* (Cognitions) have become born (come about), their subsequent activity towards the producing of their own effects is independent of other causes,—that is, their causal efficiency, after they have been born, rests in themselves; so that there is no room for the objections urged above”;—this is what is meant by the other party.—The effect of the *Pramāṇas* themselves consists in either the certainty regarding their own validity, or the definite cognition of the object cognised. In the bringing about of this effect, the *Pramāṇas* do not need any other cause.—(2847)

*Question*.—Wherefore then is their need for other causes?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2848 next*]
