> “If a certain fact, cognised through the six means of cognition. is found to be otherwise inexplicable, and thence leads to the assumption of some other fact,—this is called ‘*arthāpatti*’ ‘presumption’”.—[Kumārila: *Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti*, 1.]—(1587)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following has been urged in regard to ‘Presumption’ (which has been regarded as an independent Means or Form of Cognition, by *Mīmāṃsakas*):—[*see verse 1587 above*]

In regard to Time, Place, etc., when a certain fact has been duly cognised through the six Means of Cognition,—in the shape of Perception, Inference, Analogy, Word, Presumption and Negation,—and it *is found to be otherwise inexplicable*,—if a certain other fact were not. there,—then the assumption of this other fact is made pertaining to what is not perceptible;—this assumption is the Means of Cognition called ‘Presumption’.

‘*Called*’—i.e. by *Śabarasvāmin*; who says (under Sū. 1. 1. 5)—‘*Presumption* consists in the presuming of something not seen, on the ground that a fact already perceived or heard of would not be possible without that presumption; for instance, it is found that *Devadatta*, who is alive, is not in the house,—and this *non-existence in the house* (which is seen) leads to the presumption that he is somewhere outside the house’.

In this passage, the term ‘*seen*’ stands for ‘cognised through the five means of Cognitions other than *Word*’; and ‘*heard of*’ stands for ‘cognised by means of the Word—(1587)
