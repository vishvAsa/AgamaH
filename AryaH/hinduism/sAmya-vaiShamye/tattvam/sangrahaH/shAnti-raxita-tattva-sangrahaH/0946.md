> The idea of the illusion being there when the sense-organ is there cannot be said to be ‘inadmissible’, in its direct sense. Because there is no intervention by any unmistaken (right) notion; as no such intervening right notion is ever apprehended.—Even when the man has his mind not turned to other things, he has the continuous perception of ‘two moons’; which shows that the production (of the illusion, by the sense-organ) is not indirect—as regards the ideas of ‘entity’, ‘universal’ and so forth,—where there is the possibility of their being retracted,—cessation is quite possible, if the person so wishes. So also in the case of the idea relating to god.—(1321-1323)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Cannot be Inadmissible*’,—i.e. it must be admissible.—Why?—Because there is no intervention by any unmistaken notion—of the *One Moon*—because while it would be cognisable if it were there, no such notion is cognised at all.

This same idea is made clear in the sentence—‘*Even when the man*, *etc, etc*.’.—‘*Continuous*’—is to be construed with ‘*perception of the Two Moons*’.

For this same reason the Premiss, that ‘illusion is an aberration produced by the aberration of the Sense-organ’, also is not ‘Inconclusive As this also is not interrupted,—in view of which the case of the *Mule* would render it false, inconclusive.

As regards the notions of ‘Entity’, ‘Universal’ and so forth,—when the person retracts them by bis own wish, there is cessation of these also.

But in the case of the Illusions like that of the ‘Hair-tuft’, there can be no retraction at will; hence our premiss is not Inconclusive.

It might be argued that—“even in the case of Perception through the Senses, there can be cessation at will, by closing one’s eyes for instance”.

The Visual Perception does not cease immediately on the appearance of the wish; in fact what is brought about by the man’s wish is only the closing of the eyes; and it is only when the Eyes have ceased to function that the Visual Perception ceases. In the case of *mental* Illusion, on the other hand, it ceases directly after the wash of the man; hence the two cases are not analogous, It has to be borne in mind that, when the Eyes are fixed upon a thing, even though the man may not wish to look at the thing, the thing *is* actually seen; so that the *wish* has no direct influence upon the Visual or other Perceptions.—(1321-1323)
