> As a matter of fact, wherever the rules laid down by him relating to incantations and communion and such things, are properly followed in practice, one becomes endowed with even such perceptible qualities as wisdom, health, power and so forth.—(3487)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[Says the Opponent]—“It may be that *Dharma* is the means of accomplishing Prosperity and the Highest Good; but how is the Word of *Buddha* the means of knowing *Dharma*,—by virtue of which He should be recognised as ‘cognisant with *Dharma*’?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3487 above*]

The compound is to be expounded as—‘The rules relating to Incantations and Communion’ which ‘have been laid down by the Blessed Lord’.

The term ‘*yoga*’ stands for Communion.

‘*And such things*’ is meant to include Gestures, Magic Circles and so forth.

‘*Even perceptible qualities*’—i.e. during the present life itself,—and not only in the other regions, after death. This is what is indicated by the word ‘*even*’.—(3487)
