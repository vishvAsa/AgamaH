> The question that is being considered now is the idea of the Veda being the source of right knowledge; and it has been proved that it cannot be so, even if it be not the work of a person.—What little is said in this connection (by the other party) in sheer vanity,—all that vanishes in this same way, for all men of keen intellectual vision.—(2410-2411)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Āhopuruṣikā*’—vanity.—The nominal affix ‘*vuñ*’ being due to the term being included under the ‘*Manojña*’ group.

‘*Men of keen intelligence*’,—whose vision, in the shape of Intelligence, is very keen.—(2410-2411).
