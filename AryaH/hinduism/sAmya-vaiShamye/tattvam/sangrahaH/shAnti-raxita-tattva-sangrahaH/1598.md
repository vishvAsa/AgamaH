> Just as the notion of ‘bitterness’ with regard to what is ‘sweet’, and of ‘yellow’ with regard to what is ‘white’, is without an objective basis,—of the same kind would the notion of the word-sound also be.—(2488)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2150, that—“Those who have their minds perverted by the disorders of Bile perceive the *Sweet* as *Bitter*, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2488 above*]

This also sets aside the idea that ‘the cognition of the Word-Sound is due to that’. Because the Cognition which has no shape cannot have anything else for its object; otherwise there would be incongruities.—(2488)
