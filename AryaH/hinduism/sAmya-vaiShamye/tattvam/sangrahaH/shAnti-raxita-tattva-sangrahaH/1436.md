> “Sound is heard in only a particular place, because it is dependent (for its cognition) upon the articulation that manifests it; and articulations have not the capacity to pervade the entire space; consequently, the word-sound is not heard continuously all over the world; and because the articulations appear in different places, the hearing is restricted to those places; and as the intervening spaces (between the articulations) are not filled up (by the articulation), there is the cognition of a break (in the continuity of the sound). And, as these articulations appear only in limited places, there arises the notion that sound is not all-pervading. Further, as these articulations have movement and a certain velocity,—from whatever place these articulations proceed, the hearer thinks that the sound that he hears also comes from that same place.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words—172-176].—(2211-2214)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—In the case of the Sun, there are grounds for the illusion. of *multiplicity*, in the shape of the diverse receptacles in the form of Water and the other reflecting surfaces; in the case in question however, there is no ground for such illusion; while what we have put forward as the Reason is accompanied by the qualification ‘there being no grounds for illusion’; how then can our Reason be regarded as being ‘False and Inconclusive’?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2211-2214 above*]:

What is meant is that in the case in question also, there is ground for illusion, in the shape of the diversity of the manifesting articulations, so that the two cases stand on the same footing.

‘*Because it is dependent upon the manifesting articulations*’;—i.e. the *Cognition of Sound* is so dependent.

‘*That place*’—the place where the articulation has appeared.

‘*That*’—Sound.

In what way the manifesting articulation becomes the cause of the illusion of *interception* is explained by the words—‘*and articulations do not have the capacity*, *etc. etc*.’;—‘*asau*’ stands for the *Sound*;—‘*the hearing*’—of the Sound;—‘*tatra*’—in that part of *Ākāśa*,

‘*As the intervening spaces are not filled up*’;—what is meant is that they are not filled up by the articulations.

‘*Teṣām*’—stands for the *articulations*.

‘*Te ca āyānti*’—this also stands for the *articulations*.—(2211-2214)
