> The connection of action, time, etc. has been already rejected before. Hence all these also are purely conventional, and do not really subsist in individuals also.—(1142)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 973, by *Kumārila*) that—“the *Apoha* can have no connection with Gender and Number, etc.”; where the ‘*etcetera*’ is meant to include the connection of Action, Time and so forth.

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 1142 above*]

‘*Before*’,—i.e. in course of the rejection of such concepts as Action, Time and so forth, the connection also of Action, etc. has been discarded; hence these also cannot belong to things.

‘*Conventional*’—created by Convention.—(1142)
