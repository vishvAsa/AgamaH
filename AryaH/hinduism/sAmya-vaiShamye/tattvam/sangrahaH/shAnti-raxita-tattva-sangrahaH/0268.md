## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author proceeds to refute the doctrine of ‘*Pudgala*’ (Soul) set up by the *Vātsīputrīyas*.[*see verse 336 above*]

‘Some people’,—the *Vātsīputrīyas*.—Though these people regard themselves as ‘*Saugatas*’,—sons of *Sugata*, Buddha,—yet, under the pretended name of ‘*Pudgala*’, they postulate the ‘Soul’, which cannot be said to be either the ‘same as’, or ‘different from’, the ‘thought-phases The question arising as to how persons, who admit their being ‘Sons’ of the Blessed Buddha who has taught the doctirne of ‘No-Soul’, have wedded themselves to a false view of ‘Soul’,—the Author answers it in a joking spirit, by the term ‘*who regard themselves as Bauddhas*’.

The character of the ‘Soul Vis held to be as follows:—(*a*) He who is the doer of the diverse good and bad deeds, (*b*) the enjoyer of the agreeable and disagreeable fruits of his deeds, and (c) who moves from the point of the abandonment of the preceding Thought-phase to the point of the assuming of another Thought-phase, and is also the Experience,—is the *Soul*.—All this is held to be true (by the *Vātsīputrīyas*) of their ‘*Pudgala*’ also; the only difference is in regard to the name.—(336)
