## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 462, above) that—“if there were no gross Substance, the perception of the *Tree* and such things would not be possible; etc., etc.”—This is answered in the following—[*see verse 584 above*]

The fact of Atoms being beyond the reach of the senses is not admitted; because such Atoms as have attained a certain condition are actually perceptible by the senses.—In fact, it is for people who regard Atoms as eternal, that the appearance of peculiar features in the Atoms being impossible, they would be always beyond the reach of the senses;—not so for us.

‘*Anyonyābhisarāḥ*’—‘*as mutually helpful*’,—i.e. as helping each other.—(584)
