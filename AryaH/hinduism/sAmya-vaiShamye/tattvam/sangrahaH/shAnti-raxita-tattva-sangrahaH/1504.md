> “Thus as this destruction, perceived after the effort involved in the stroke of the bludgeon, is found to be uncaused,—your probans becomes ‘false’, ‘inconclusive’.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 29-30].—(2329)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* points out that the Probans in question is present in the contrary of the Probandum:—[*see verse 2329 above*]

‘*This*’—the two kinds of Destruction.

The compound ‘*Prayatnā, etc*.’ stands for ‘invariably concomitant with effort involved in the stroke of the Bludgeon—(2329)
