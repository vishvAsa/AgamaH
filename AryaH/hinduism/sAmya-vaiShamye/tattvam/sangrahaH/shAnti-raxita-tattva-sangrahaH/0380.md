> “What is bound up with chains of attachment, etc. in the prison-house of the world is one ‘moment’, while the ‘moment’ that is liberated is another, who has not been in bondage;—this is incomprehensible.”—(496)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to show that ‘Bondage’ and ‘Liberation’ also would not be possible (under the doctrine of Perpetual Flux):—[*see verse 496 above*]

One ‘Moment’ is *bound up* with Attachment while another is *liberated*,—*this is incomprehensible*; i.e. impossible.

‘*Bhava*’ is world, Cycle of Birth and Rebirth,—which is the ‘*prison-house*’, the place where persons are kept in bondage.—(496)
