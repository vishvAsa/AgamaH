> The character in question as attributed to the ‘sky-lotus’ is entirely baseless; its idea is there only as the result of one’s eagerness for wrangling.—(426)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As a matter of fact, *the capacity for fruitful activity* is not admitted in the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things. The idea of it is merely an outcome of the opponent’s imagination and is utterly baseless.—(426)
