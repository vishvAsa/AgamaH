> In regard to all these, there would be the two possibilities—is the cognition of these valid or invalid? how then what is itself invalid be a factor in the ascertainment of validity?—(3052)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The *Cognition* of the said three factors, which is regarded as a factor in Validity,—is it valid or invalid?—These are the two alternatives possible.—If it is *invalid*, then it cannot form part of the certainty regarding *validity*,——as it is itself invalid; if the witness (evidence) has been regarded as untrustworthy, he cannot help in the decision regarding the matter under dispute.—(3052)
