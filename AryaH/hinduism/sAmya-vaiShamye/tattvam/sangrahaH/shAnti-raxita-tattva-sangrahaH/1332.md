> The eye is regarded as ‘illuminative’ of colour, because it brings about the cognition of colour,—not because it is its apprehension; what similarity then can the eye have to cognition?—(2029)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above—under *Text* 2015, that—“Even though it be illuminative, the illuminativeness would be restricted”.—The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2029 above*]

As a matter of fact, the Eye is spoken of as ‘illuminative’ of Colour, because it brings about the Cognition of Colour:—As regards Cognition, it does not do anything to the Colour; as what it does bring about is entirely *Colourless* (formless); and what does not do anything to a certain Object cannot be regarded as ‘illuminative’ of it; otherwise there would be incongruities.

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.

‘*Upamā*’—Similarity.—(2029)
