> Thus then, when a proof has been adduced in support of the two ends of the Veda,—by the refutation of that proof, the upholders of the Veda do not have their purpose accomplished.—(2430)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above—under *Text* 2101, that—“when the other party adduce proofs in support of the two ends of the Veda, the upholders of the Veda have their purpose accomplished by the refutation of those proofs”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2430 above*]

‘*Tat*’—Therefore, thus.

‘*They do not have their purpose accomplished*’—i.e. their opinion does not become established.—(2430)
