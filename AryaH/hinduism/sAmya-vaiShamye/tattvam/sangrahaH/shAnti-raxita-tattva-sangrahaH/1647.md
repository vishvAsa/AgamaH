> If the embellished organ and letter-sounds were capable of hearing by a few limited persons, then there would be no hearing for other persons who would be going to hear the same letter-sounds.—(2574)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“It is of only a few limited number of persons whose Organ and Letter-Sounds would be embellished and fit for audition, and hence the Sound could not be heard by all men”.

But in that case, there would be no hearing by those men who were going to hear other Letter-Sounds.

This is what is pointed out in the following:—[see *verse 2574 above*]:

The compound ‘*niyataśrutiyogyau*’ is to be explained as ‘*śrutiyogyau*’—capable of hearing—‘*niyatānām puṃsām*’—by a few limited persons.

‘*Anyavarṇa, etc*.’—This may be taken as ‘other persons who would be going to hear that same sound’,—or as ‘persons who would be going to hear other sounds’.—(2574)
