## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 3261—“Thus, no omniscient Person of any kind is conceivable; consequently no human assertion could be the means of providing the knowledge of *Dharma*”.

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verse 3645 above*]

‘An *Omniscient Person*’—i.e. *Buddha* Himself alone; not *Kapila*, or any one else; as already established before.

As regards the objection that has been urged regarding Cognition being *formless* or *with form*,—that has been answered by us already.—(3645)
