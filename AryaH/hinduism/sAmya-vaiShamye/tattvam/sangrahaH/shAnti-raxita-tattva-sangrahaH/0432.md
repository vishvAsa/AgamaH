> “Similarly, the yarns and the cloth must be regarded as different,—because they have different makers and different potencies,—just as the pillar and the jar are regarded as different because of the presence of contradictory properties.”—(561)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus proved the difference between the Quality and the Substance possessing the Quality, the Opponents proceed to prove the difference between the *Composite* and its *Components*:—[*see verse 561 above*]

This argument is formulated as follows:—Things having different makers, different effects, different times, different sizes must be regarded as different,—just like the Pillar, the Jar and such things;—the things under discussion do have different makers, different effects, different times and different sizes.—This Reason cannot be said to be ‘unproven’ (‘not admitted’), or ‘inconclusive’, In fact, the difference among things is always based upon the presence of contradictory properties,—as is found in the case of the Pillar, the Jar and so forth such contradictory properties are found in the *Composite* and the *Component*; for instance, of the *Yarn*, the maker is the (spinning) woman, while of the *Cloth*, the maker is the Weaver; the Cloth—and not the Yam,—has the capacity to remove cold; the Yarns are found there before the Cloth; hence it is prior in time, while the Cloth appears later, after the operation of the Weaver; the length and breadth of the Cloth are different from those of each of the Yarns; thus the sizes of the two are different. Thus the Reasons adduced are not ‘inconclusive’, Such is the sense of the argument.—(561)
