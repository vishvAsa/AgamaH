> When the cognition is held to apprehend the qualified thing,—it is by reason of its apprehending the thing as differentiated from other homogeneous and heterogeneous things,—and not of the connection of qualifications.—(1271)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If what is meant by *Sumati’s* Reason—‘because it apprehends the qualified thing’ is the presence of a qualification which is something distinct from itself,—then it is ‘inadmissible’; because for the Buddhist, there is no such thing as the ‘qualification’, through connection, with which the cognition would apprehend things along with qualifications; according to the Buddhist, what is apprehended is only the Thing itself as differentiated from homogeneous and heterogeneous things; and it is by reason of this latter apprehension that the Cognition is said to apprehend the ‘qualified’ thing.—(1271)
