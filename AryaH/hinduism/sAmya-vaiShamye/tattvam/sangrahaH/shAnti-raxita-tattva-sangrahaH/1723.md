> Such continuance, however, has been already rejected; if there were such continuance, then the remembrance should appear at the time of the cognition of the apprehension of the letters; because the two would have one and the same cause.—(2728)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, if it were possible for what is *past* to continue to exist, then what is asserted might be true; as a matter of fact however, what is past does not continue to exist; hence the said appearance of the Letters in the Cumulative Cognition cannot be right.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2728 above*]

‘*Already*’—i.e. under the Chapter on the ‘Three Points of Time In support of this he adduces an argument annulling the Opponent’s idea—‘*If there were such continuance*, *etc. etc*.’;—at the very time when there is cognition of the apprehension of the Letters, there would be the likelihood of the Remembrance appearing. This is the argument that sets aside the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* view.

‘*Having the same cause*’—Their causes are not different.—(2728)
