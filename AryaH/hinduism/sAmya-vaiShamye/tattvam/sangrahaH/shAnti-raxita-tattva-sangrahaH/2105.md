> Or, the jumping also is something that is capable of reaching the highest stage of perfection,—which would proceed from its own causes, through concentrated effort and strength: this capacity is named ‘*manojava*’ (mind-force). It is in connection with such capacity that we hear (and read) of such facts as that the lord reaches remote places by merely thinking of it.—The mere fact that such power is not seen cannot prove that it does not exist; nor can the opponent put forward any reason that could annul such an idea.—(3425-3427)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Or, the Jumping also being dependent upon particular causes, there can be no fixity in its degree of excellence, and hence this case could not invalidate our Reason.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 3425-3427 above*]

For instance, we also admit that, through Concentration of Mind and the use of great strength, Jumping reaches the highest degree of perfection; as for instance, we read of the Lord having the power called ‘Mind-Force’, by means of which one becomes as swift in his movement as the Mind; that is why it has been named ‘Mind-Force’.

Nor is there any reason annulling the possibility of this Power.

Nor can mere non-perception of it justify its denial; as in that case, great incongruities would result.—(3425-3427)
