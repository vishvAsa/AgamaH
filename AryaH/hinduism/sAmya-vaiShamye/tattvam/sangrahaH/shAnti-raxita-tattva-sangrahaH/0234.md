> The ‘desire to see’ and the rest are not anything distinct prom ‘sentience’; and if this latter were liable to ‘appearance and disappearance’, then the same could not be denied of the soul.—(290)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*The same*’,—i.e. the attributing of ‘appearance and disappearance’.

This argument may be formulated as follows:—When there is no basis for any restriction regarding the existence of a thing, that thing should not be so restricted by any intelligent person,—e.g. *Ākāśa* as having a material shape;—in the case of the Spirit there is no basis, in the shape of ‘Desire to see’ and the rest for restricting the character of ‘being the experiencer’ to it; so that no reason is perceived for such restriction.—This Reason cannot be said to be ‘unproven’; as has been explained already.—(290)
