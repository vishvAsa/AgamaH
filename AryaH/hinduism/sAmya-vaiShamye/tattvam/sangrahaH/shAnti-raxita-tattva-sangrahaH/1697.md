> The idea that ‘in the case of the jar, etc. their use is characterised and indicated by the “universal”’ has already been discarded; because the universal does not exist, and because it can have no connection with the individual thing.—(2682)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2292, that—“Just as in the ease of the Jar and such things, etc. etc.”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 2682 above*]

‘*Already*’—under the chapter dealing with the ‘Universal ‘*Because it does not exist*’—i.e. because the Universal has no existence.

Even if it exists, it can have no connection with the Individual thing, in the shape of the Jar; because it cannot be benefited by this latter. Hence its use cannot be regarded as characterised or indicated by the ‘Universal’.—(2682)

The following *text* points out that, as a consequence of what has gone above, it follows that all that has been alleged by the other party on the basis of the ‘Universal’ is entirely irrelevant.—[*see verse 2683 next*]
