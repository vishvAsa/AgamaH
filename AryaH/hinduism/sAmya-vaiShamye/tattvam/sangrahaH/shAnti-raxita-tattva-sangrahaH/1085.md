> Because that cognition which apprehends ‘the presence of several similar parts’ would also fall under ‘mutual negation’; (otherwise) if it were the ‘presence of all similar parts’ that is cognised, then there would ee identity.—(1562)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Yena*’—indicates the reason for what has been asserted above. What is meant is that—because, in the case of the Cognition of *Similarity*, what is cognised is the ‘presence of *several* similar parts’,—and not the ‘presence of *all* similar parts’,—therefore this is a case of ‘Mutual Negation’.—Otherwise, if *all parts* were similar, then there would be *identity*,—i.e. the *Gavaya* would be the *same* as the *Cow*.—(1562)
