> The cognition of the meaning must be regarded as arising from the letters; because it appears after the cognition of these; what is like it arises from that,—like the cognition of fire arising from smoke.—(2731)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The formulation of the argument is as follows:—When one Cognition appears after another cognition, it must be regarded as arising from this latter, indirectly,—e.g. the cognition of the ‘subject’, *Fire*, proceeding from the cognition of the ‘Indicative’, *Smoke*;—the cognition of the Meaning appears after the cognition of the Letters; hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.

What is meant to be proved here is the fact of its being *regarded* as the effect of that other cognition; this is what constitutes the difference between the Probans and the Probandum.—(2731)

The following *Text* shows that the Reason adduced in the preceding *text* is not ‘inadmissible’;—[*see verse 2732 next*]
