> Even when the ‘absence of contact’ is equally present in all cases, the cognition of all things does not come about, because the capacity of things is always restricted; as is found in the case of the iron being attracted by the magnet.—(2519)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2174, that—“There are some people according to whom the Word-Sound is apprehended by the Auditory Organ, when it is produced but not in actual contact with that Organ, etc. etc.”

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 2519 above*]

Though there is ‘absence of contact’ in all things, yet there is no possibility of the apprehension of the antecedent object, because the capacity of things is always restricted; for instance, the piece of substance called ‘Magnet’ draws to itself the piece of Iron (which is not in contact with it); and yet it does not draw all other things which also are not in contact with it.—(2519)
