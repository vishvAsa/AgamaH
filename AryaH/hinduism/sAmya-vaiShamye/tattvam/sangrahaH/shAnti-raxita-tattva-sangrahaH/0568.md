## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Uddyotakara* has argued as follows (in *Nyāyavārtika*, Sū. 2. 2. 8, page 320)—“It is through ignorance of our Reason that our Opponent has urged that—‘just as the term *Cook* is comprehensive in its connotation, and yet there is no such Universal as *Cook*,—so also is the comprehensive character of the connotation of the term *Cow*—Because what is meant by our Reason is that ‘Particular Cognition cannot be accidental (without cause)’; and what this means is that the Idea which is different from the idea of the individual object must be due to a different cause;—and not that all comprehensive ideas are based upon ‘Universal Such being the case, that which is the principal cause of the action of *cooking* is what is spoken of by the name ‘Cook’; and this principal character is present in other persons also; hence the objection urged against us has no force.”
