> “And if the subject has already been cognised, prior to the recognition of the probans in the subject (i.e. the minor premiss)—then what is the use of knowing that the probans subsists in it and so forth, by virtue of which the cognition could be regarded as inference?”—(1493)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“Then again, if the Subject has been cognised before the recognition of the Minor Premiss, then all attempt to obtain the recognition of this latter would be futile; because the purpose of the whole attempt is to secure the cognition of the Subject; hence, if that has been cognised, what would be the use in trying to know of the presence of the Probans in the Subject?”

What has been stated is on the basis of taking it for granted that what the opponent has asserted is true. As a matter of fact, the Word is not a property of any Such Subject as the *Tree*; as it is always found in the place where the Speaker is.—(1493)
