## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Kumārila* has in his *Ślokavārtika* (Sense-perception, 78), in the words “The Cognition can be the Means as bringing about the apprehension, etc. etc.”—based the distinction between the *Means* and *Fruit* on the relation of *Producer and Produced*. And in this there is nothing incompatible with our view. As our Teacher has declared as follows:—‘The attributing of the name *Pratyakṣa* to the Eye and other *causes* is not incompatible’,—All that we say is as follows:—It is essential that in the beginning the relation of *Cause and Effect* can be based only upon the distinction previously made; until the difference in the *Cognitions* has been distinctly recognised, nothing can proceed on the basis of the difference in *objectives*; and for the recognition of the difference among Cognitions there can be no basis other than the *sameness of form*; and from this it follows by implication that the *sameness of form* is the *most efficient instrument*; and it is on the basis of *this sameness of form* that the Cognition proceeds to prompt people to activity; and the fact of the prompter being the Means of Bight Cognition can be determined only by one who is seeking to engage in the activity concerned; and not merely as a whim.. It has been thus declared—‘Every wise person seeks to determine what is the proper means of cognition and what is not so, only for the purpose of some fruitful activity It is for this reason that that factor alone in the Cognition has to be brought out by which it serves to prompt men to activity. But in drawing the distinction between the Means of Cognition and its *fruit* on the basis of the relation of *Producer and Produced*, there is no recognition of that *sameness of form* which is the only prompting factor; consequently the said distinction between the Means of Cognition and its fruit on the said basis would be absolutely useless. This is the reason why the Teacher had recourse to a figurative (indirect) interpretation, as he felt that the determining of the character of the Means of Cognition on the said basis cannot take any part in the prompting to activity.

Thus when the distinction has once been made, it may subsequently be explained on the basis of the relation of *Producer and Produced*;—and there would be nothing objectionable in that—[only the initial distinction has to-be made *first*, and hence it cannot be due to that relation].—(1349)
