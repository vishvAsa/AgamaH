> “Cognitions, and the soul also, are held to be eternal and one, on the ground of their being of the nature of ‘intelligence’; if there is diversity, it is due to the object.”—(242)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Not perceiving all these incongruities and self-contradiction, Kumārila declares as follows:—[*see verse 242 above*]

[This is a quotation, from *Ślokavārtika*, Chapter on Eternality of Sound, 401].

Cognitions and the Soul also are regarded as *eternal* and *one*;—why?—*because they are of the nature of Intelligence*; that is, because, under our view Spirit is of the nature of Intelligence in the form of Cognitions.

*Question*—How then is it that such diversity (in Cognitions) is recognised as ‘Colour-Cognition’, ‘Taste-Cognition’ and so forth?

*Answer*—“*If there is diversity, it is due to the object*; the term ‘if’, has been used as admitting (for the sake of argument) the opinion of the other party; the sense being—‘If—*in* case—diversity be assumed”.—(242)

*Objection* (to Kumārila’s position)—If Cognition is *eternal* and *one*, then, how is it that it apprehends Colour and other things consecutively? It should apprehend all at once, there being no distinction (to which the successiveness would be due).

The answer to this (from Kumārila’s point of view) is given in the following Text:—[*see verse 243 next*]
