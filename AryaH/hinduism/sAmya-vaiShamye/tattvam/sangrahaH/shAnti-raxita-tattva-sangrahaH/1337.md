> [Says the other party]—“the cognition endowed with similarity of form may be the apprehender of the external object”.—That also being impossible, it cannot have the position of the apprehender.—(2036)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has thus been proved that there can be no apprehension of Objects by a Cognition that does not bear any imprint (objective). The other view—that there can be none even by the Cognition that does bear such an imprint,—is now taken up and expounded:—[*see verse 2036 above*]

There can be no real form in the Cognition, on the basis of which the exact nature of things could be determined; and a Cognition with an unreal form could not apprehend the Object; as such form is present in wrong Cognition also.—(2036)
