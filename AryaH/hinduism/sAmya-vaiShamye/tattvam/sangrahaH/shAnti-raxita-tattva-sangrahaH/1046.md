## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—‘Not having the Three-features, Verbal Cognition may not be *Inference*; but how can it be regarded as Valid or Right Cognition’?

The answer is as follows:—[*see verse 1499 above*]

The cognition is ‘unshakeable’ by reason of its being free from doubt and error; that is, it is *Eight Cognition* because there is no Right Cognition sublating it; just in the same way as Sense-perception is Right Cognition.

Says *Śabarasvāmin* (in his *Bhāṣya* on Sū. 1. 1. 5)—“The cognition derived from the statement ‘Desiring Heaven one should offer the *Agnihotra*’ is not a doubtful one,—it leaves us in no doubt as to whether Heaven is to be attained or not;—and when this is cognised with certainty, it cannot be *wrong*; it is only when the cognition, after having come about, becomes subîated by the subsequent idea that ‘it is not so’, that it can be called *wrong cognition*;—the cognition in question however is never, at any time or at any place, found to be otherwise;—hence it must be *true*. As regards the assertion of the common people,—if it comes from a trusted person, or if it pertains to what is actually perceived by the Senses, then it is certainly true; if, on the other hand, it emanates from an untrustworthy person, or it relates to something beyond the reach of the Senses,—then having its source in a human being, it cannot be regarded as *right*; because such a thing cannot be rightly known by human beings by themselves”.—(1499)
