## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[Under the view that the Connection of the Word with its meaning was created, set up at a certain time, by a certain person] it has to be explained, who the Person was who created the Connection and to whom he communicated it.—It cannot be right to say that the man learns it by himself; as the same might be said regarding others also.—If it was communicated to the present man by some one else,—then it should have been communicated to that man also by some one else,—then, in that case, there being no beginning, the Connection must be regarded as eternal.

This is shown by the *Mīmāṃsaka* in the following:—[*see verse 2273 above*]

The argument may be formulated as follows:—The Connection between the Word and its meaning must be regarded as preceded by the usage of elderly people,—because it is a *Connection*,—like Connections of the present time,—the Connection under dispute is also a *Connection*; hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—(2273)
