> “The non-conceptual cannot bring about the conceptual content,—(*a*) because their objects are different,—as in the case of the cognition of colour, etc.,—and also because it is non-conceptual—like the eye, etc.”—(1307)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Bhāvivikta* and others, who take exception to the idea that ‘the non-conceptual Perception leads to activity through bringing about the Conceptual Content’, bring forward certain arguments;—these are set forth in the following—[*see verse 1307 above*]

The cognition produced by the Senses (which is non-conceptual) cannot bring about the *conceptual* cognition, which is mental,—(a) because their objects are different, as in the case of the cognitions of Colour, Touch, etc.;—and also (b) because it is *non-conceptual*,—like the Eye and other organs.

In support of the Reason ‘Because their objects are different’, the instance cited is ‘*as in the case of the cognitions of colour*, *etc*.’; and in support of the Reason ‘Because it is non-conceptual’, the instance cited is ‘*like the eye*, *etc*.’—(1307)

The following Text points out the defects in the above reasoning:—[*see verse 1308 next*]
