## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the Author himself (under *Text* 2928)—‘How can there be Doubt and the rest, when the self-validity of the Cognition has become cognised?’—The following *Text* proceeds to show what is meant by the term ‘and the rest’ in that sentence:—[*see verse 2944 above*]

If the validity of all cognitions were inherent in themselves, then there could not be a difference of opinion among the various parties, regarding this validity.—(2944)

*Question*:—“How do yon know that there is this difference of opinion?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2945 next*]
