> “What happens is that the articulation plants the seed in consciousness, and it becomes developed by the last articulation,—and therefore the word appears in the consciousness”.—This assumption also is made without reason. Because even so, the word is not perceived to appear as anything different (from the letters).—(2711-2712)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“It cannot be admitted that the thing *appears* and is yet *not perceived*; and it is an actual fact that the *Word as an indivisible whole* does *appear* in consciousness, in which there has been a development of the impressions of each preceding Letter (composing the Word)”.

This is what is anticipated and answered in the following:—[*see verses 2711-2712 above*]

‘*Āvṛttaḥ*’—become; the impressions produced by the cognitions of all the Letters *become* developed in Consciousness.

‘*Without reason*’.—What is meant is that what happens is that the Letters themselves, after the cognition of each, become subsequently included under the compounded cognition appearing in the form of Remembrance. Because as a matter of fact, *we* do not perceive,—nor does the Speaker perceive,—any *Word as an indivisible whole*, after the last letter has been cognised.—It is a mere dream on the part of the Grammarian, arising from the bewildered feeling that the idea of such word as a whole appearing in Consciousness would make things nice for him.—(2711-2712)
