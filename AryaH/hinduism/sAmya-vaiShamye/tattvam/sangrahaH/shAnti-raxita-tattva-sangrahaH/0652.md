> Under the view that what is denoted is the ‘aggregate’, there is clear conception of ‘universals’ and ‘particulars as what are denoted are austerity, caste, conduct and the rest collectively.—(897)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *text* sets forth the objections against the theory of the ‘Aggregate’ being denoted by Words (as expounded under *Text* 888):—[*see verse 897 above*]

Even under the view that what is denoted is the ‘Aggregate’, a much clearer conception of ‘Universals’ and ‘Particulars’,—in the shape of Austerity and the rest,—is admitted; hence all the objections that have been urged against the denotation of each of these singly, are all applicable to the view in question.—(897)
