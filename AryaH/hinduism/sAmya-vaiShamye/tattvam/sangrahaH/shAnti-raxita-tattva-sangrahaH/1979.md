## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, even when the superiority transcends the limitations of its subject, it does not reach its highest point; it is found to proceed only up to a certain point.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3168 above*]

For example, it may so happen that men who, by reason of the accumulation of fat, are unable to jump to the height of even two feet, succeed in reducing their fat by means of exercise and become capable of jumping to the height of 15 feet; but even so, though they may carry on the exercise hundreds of times, they can never jump to the height of 8 miles in the sky.—(3168)
