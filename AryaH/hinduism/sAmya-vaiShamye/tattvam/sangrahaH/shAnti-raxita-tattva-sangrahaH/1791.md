> Hence what is needed is the cognition of ‘effective action’ or some other factor,—for the purpose of bringing about certainty,—not for infusion of the capacity; as in the case of poison, etc.—(2836)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Some other factor*’—such as the knowledge of the purity of its source.

‘*Not for the infusion, etc*. *etc*.’;—this has to be construed with ‘*anyat apekṣyate*’.

‘*Asyāḥ*’—of the Capacity.

Because *certain cognition* subsists in the Cognising Person, it is only right that for the bringing about of such cognition other causes should be needed;—not so, for the purpose of infusing the Capacity; as this ‘infusion’ subsists in the Capacity,—and the Capacity having come about along with the Cognition, the ‘infusion’ also becomes accomplished on that.—(2836)
