> Inasmuch as the appearance of six cognitions out of a single preceding cognition is clearly recognised simultaneously,—what your argument proves is admitted (by us).—(198)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, if what is meant to prove is merely the fact of the cognitions being ‘preceded by a Cause’, then the effort is futile;—this is what is shown in the following *Text*:—[*see verse 198 above*]

*From a single preceding Cognition*,—out of a single Cognition immediately preceding them,—there is an appearance of Six Cognitions, through the Eye and other organs,—which ‘appearance’ is clearly recognised. For instance, at the time that a man *sees* the complexion of the dancing girl, he also *hears* the Sound of the drum and other musical accompaniments, *smells* the odour of the Lotus and other fragrant things, *tastes* the Camphor and other things, *feels* also the wind emanating from the fans, and *thinks* of taking up his clothes.—It cannot be right to say that his vision appears to be such because it moves quickly, like the whirling fire-brand. For if it were so, then the appearances would be vague and dim. To explain;—it is on the basis of the ‘recalling’ of all these perceptions (through the several Sense-organs) that you explain the feeling that the whole lot of the perceptions appears in a single Cognition; the Recalling too is done through Remembrance;—and Remembrance, appertaining, as it does, to the past, is always indistinct;—while the single Cognition of Colour and the rest is found to be quite distinct.—Further, in the case of such expressions as ‘*saro-rasa*’, there is an appearance of the cognitions quickly apprehending the ‘*sa*’ and other letter-sounds; so that in this case also there might be the notion of a single Cognition; and there would, therefore, be no idea of any order of sequence among them.—All this is going to be explained later on; in the present context the Text has merely indicated the lines of the refutation (of the Opponent’s doctrine).—(198)
