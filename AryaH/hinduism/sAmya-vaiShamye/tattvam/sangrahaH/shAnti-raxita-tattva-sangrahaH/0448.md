> If it is the difference of the cloth from the very first yarns that is sought to be proved,—then there is the irresistible defect of ‘futility’. those other yarns also that appear later on, in another state (form), capable of a particular kind of useful action,—are not entirely different in character from those first yarns.—(579-580)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the other party (under *Text* 561, above) that “the Yarns and the Cloth are distinct things, because their makers and potencies are different, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 579-580 above*]

If what you are seeking to establish is the difference of the Cloth from those first yams which have not yet acquired the name of ‘Cloth’,—then you are proving what is already admitted. In fact, all things being momentary, it is admitted by us that the later yams which subsequently come to be called ‘Cloth’ are actually produced from those first yarns,—though (as a matter of fact) it is not possible for one thing to be produced out of another totally different from it.—(579-580)

If, on the other hand, what is sought to be proved is the difference of the *Cloth* from those yarns that have come into existence at the same time as the Cloth,—then, the Reasons adduced are such as are *not admitted*, ‘Unproven’.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verses 581-583 next*]
