> “As a matter of fact, any thing uncommon (unique, specific) is never cognised as qualified by the Apoha. how too could any relationship be assumed between an entity and a non-entity?—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 86]—(946)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged (by the *Bauddha*):—‘It is not meant by us that in the case of the expression *Blue Lotus*, the *negation of the non-lotus* is qualified by *the negation of the non-blue*; hence the said objection cannot apply to us. What we mean is that there is an entity which is excluded from the *non-blue and the non-lotus*: and what is denoted by the word is that entity as qualified by the exclusion of otherngs

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 946 above*]

That is, because the Specific Individuality cannot be expressed by words, and also because all the objections urged against that view are applicable in the present case also.

Even if the uncommon entity be apprehended—even so, it cannot be *qualified* by the *exclusion of other things*; this is what is shown by the words—‘*How too, etc*. *etc*.’;—the ‘*non-entity*’ is the *Apoha*, the ‘Entity’ is the uncommon thing; and there can be no connection between the entity and the non-entity; because connection always rests upon two *entities*.—(946)

“Further, the connection may be there; even so, the *Apoha* cannot be regarded as the qualifying factor”;—this is shown in the following—[*see verse 947 next*]
