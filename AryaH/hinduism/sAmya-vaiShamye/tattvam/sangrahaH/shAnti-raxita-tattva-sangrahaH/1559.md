## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 2089 that—“there is no Verbal authority,—either *eternal* or *artificial*,—which declares an Author of the Veda”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2423 above*]

‘*It has been shown*’—under the chapter on the *Means of Eight Cognition*.

‘*Tāsām*’—of Verbal Authority, Analogy and Presumption.—(2423)
