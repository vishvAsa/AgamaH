> It is not possible that there should be absence of notions based upon the universal ‘substance’,—when the basis is there. for the same reason there cannot be restriction of it.—(849)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (by *Praśastamati*, under *Text* 843, above) that—“From seeing the absence of such basis as the Universal of ‘Substance’, etc. it is concluded that the scope of these Universals is restricted.”—

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 849 above*]

So long as the cause is there in its perfect condition, there cannot be absence of the effect; if it were there, then, it would not be the effect of that cause. Thus then the absence of the said notion being impossible, the restriction regarding the relation of *container and contained* also cannot be right.—(849)
