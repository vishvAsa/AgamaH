> Your assertion that “the cooking remains un-negatived in its own form” involves self-contradiction; because the words ‘in its own form’ can only mean that ‘there is negativing of the form of other acts’; otherwise the emphasising would be meaningless.—(1148-1149)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted (in *Text* 975, by *Kumārila*) that—“the ‘cooking’ remains un-negatived in its own form”.

The following *Text* shows that this assertion involves self-contradiction on the part of *Kumārila*:—[*see verses 1148-1149 above*]

*Question*:—“In what way is there self-contradiction?”

*Answer*:—‘*Because what the words*, *etc. etc*.’,—That is, when it is asserted that ‘the Cooking remains un-negatived *in its own form*’, the emphasis laid upon the last phrase indicates that.the *Cooking* remains itself by *negativing the forms of other acts*. If that were not the meaning, then the emphasis that you have laid upon the phrase ‘in its own form’ would be meaningless, as there would be nothing that would be precluded by that emphasis.—(1148-1149)
