## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even though the Similarity has not been previously apprehended *under that* name,—i.e. as ‘Similarity *to the Gavaya*’,—i.e. the *animal Cow as similar to the Gavaya* may not have been apprehended prior to the seeing of the *Gavaya*;—yet *in its own form*, it has been already apprehended; that is, that which forms its *very self*—its essence, nature,—has been previously apprehended.

*Question*—“What is that *own form* in which it has been apprehended?”

*Answer*:—‘*Which is called its* *very* *self*’;—i.e. that which is called the *very self* of the *Cow*,—in that form, which constitutes its nature,—it has been already apprehended.—(1554)

*Question*:—“What if it has been already apprehended?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1555 next*]
