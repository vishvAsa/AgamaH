> “Name (universal) and the rest may not be the distinguishing properties perceived, in the object (op sense-perception);—even so, the reason put forward does not cease to be inadmissible; because if there is no apprehension of the thing as distinguished from other things, then, there would either be an apprehension of the thing by itself only, or no apprehension at all; as in the case of the jar,—if there is no apprehension of the jar as distinguished from other jars, then there is either apprehension of the jar by itself alone, or no apprehension of the jar at all.”—(1265-1267)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *texts*, the Author sets forth the ‘inadmissible character’ of the Reason put forward by himself (under Texts 1257-1260),—this criticism being urged from the standpoint of the *Digambara* (Jaina) philosopher, *Sumati*:—[*see verses 1265-1267 above*]

*Sumati* describes all things as existing in two forms—the Universal and the Particular; the Universal again is of two kinds—one determined by the Particular, e.g. the ‘Cow’, and that not so determined (conceptual), e.g.

‘Being’, ‘Entity’, That Universal which exists only in the *undetermined* (non-conceptual) form is of only one form and is amenable to *non-conceptual* Perception (Perception free from Conceptual Content), in the form of mere *observation*, purely *subjective Ideation*; while the other—i.e. the Universal determined by particulars—is amenable to *Conceptual* Perception.—Such is *Sumati’s* scheme of Perception.

*Kumārila* however describes the Non-Conceptual Perception, purely subjective Ideation, as apprehending the ‘Specific Individuality’ of the particular (or Individual); and the Conceptual Perception as apprehending the ‘Universal

*Sumati*, in examining the nature of Perception in the form of purely *subjective Ideation* as posited by *Kumārila* and others, has argued thus—“One who holds this view should be asked the following question.—In this Perception, is the Thing before the eyes of the observer apprehended purely by itself, as characterised by its own form which is impossible anywhere else? Or is it not so apprehended?—If he says it is not so perceived, then our answer to him is as follows:—If there is *non-apprehension of the Thing in a form distinguished* from other things;—that is, in a form distinguished from a thing other than the intended thing,—i.e. the form or character of the intended thing which is not present in the other thing;—if there is nonapprehension of the Thing as qualified by such a form,—then, either *there would be apprehension of the Thing itself only*,—i.e. the said Thing even without the character impossible in other things;—or, if even this is not apprehended, then there would be no perception of the Thing at all.—‘*As* *in* *the case* *of* *the* *Jar*’;—this cites an example.

This example is explained in the next text (1267):—“In the case of the perception of the Jar, if there is no apprehension of the Jar in the form that is impossible in another Jar, to which it may be compared,—then either there would be apprehension of the Jar by itself alone,—without any qualification as that of being of silver or of copper and so forth;—or, if there is no apprehension of the Jar by itself, then there would be no apprehension of any Jar at all,—not even of the one intended; so that there would be no apprehension of the Jar at all.—In the same manner, in the case in question if the distinguishing character is not apprehended, there would either he apprehension of the thing alone by itself,—or there would be no apprehension at all; there could be no escape from these alternatives—(1265-1267)

[*Sumati’s*] *Pūrvapakṣa* (Criticism) against us thus would be as follows:—[*see verse 1268 next*]
