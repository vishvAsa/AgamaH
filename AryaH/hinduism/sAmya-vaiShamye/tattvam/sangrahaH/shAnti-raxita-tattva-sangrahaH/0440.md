> If the colour had remained in the same condition, then there could be no suppression of it; as the previous unsuppressed colour would continue to exist.—(570)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“How do you know that a fresh White Colour is produced,—and not that the previous White Colour itself, which could not be perceived by reason of being suppressed, becomes perceptible later on, by the removal of the suppression?”

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 570 above*]

This argument may be formulated as follows:—That which has not abandoned its unsuppressed character cannot be suppressed by anything else,—just as the same in its previous condition;—and under the suppressed condition also, the original Colour has not abandoned its unsuppressed character; hence this would be a proposition which is contrary to a larger proposition.

On the other hand, if it be held that, the Colour *has* abandoned its unsuppressed character,—then it becomes established that the Colour subsequently produced is different from the original Colour.—(570)
