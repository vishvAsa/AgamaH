## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—It cannot be admitted that the single Sun is perceived as diverse because of the separateness of space (between the reflecting Media); because what are actually apprehended by the Eye are so many diverse reflected images of the Sun; and it is not the Sun that is apprehended. For you, who do not regard the reflected image to be different from the object reflected,—there can be no cause for the apprehension of several reflected images

This argument of the Opponent is what is referred to in the following;—[*see verse 2215 above*]:

‘*Āha*’—‘says’—the Opponent.

‘*Simultaneously*’—at one and the same time.—(2215)

The answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verses 2216-2217 next*]
