> “If the one-ness of the jar, that is urged as an undesirable contingency, is in reference to the ‘universal aspect’,—then the argument is superfluous.—If however, one were to urge the contingency of the individual jars being one, on the strength of the above arguments,—then it can be pointed out that such an idea would be contrary to all forms of right cognition; because the multiplicity of individuals has been definitely established by all means of right cognition, sense-perception and the rest.”—(2131-2132)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If it is in reference to the ‘Universal’—the ‘genius’, ‘Jar’—that *one-ness* is sought to be proved by the above *Reductio ad, Absurdum*, then, it is superfluous; as it has been declared—‘That aspect of the object which is *Universal*, Common, is eternal, the other aspect is held to be perishable’.

On the other hand, if the *Reductio ad Absurdum* is meant to prove the *one-ness* of the *Individual* Jars,—even so, that does not falsify our premisses. Because such a Proposition is directly annulled by Sense-perception and other Means of Cognition; specially as all the Reasons adduced in this connection have to be regarded as qualified by the condition that ‘what they assert is *not annulled*’; how then could there be any falsity in our Reasons?—Such is the sense of the passage.

‘*Would be contrary*, etc. etc.’—That is, the Proposition in question is so contrary.

The rest is easily understood.—(2131-2132)
