> Thus, those objections that the Buddhists, without anger, urge against the assertion of the omniscience of Jina,—the Jainas are not in a position to urge (against the Buddhist).—(3351)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the other party, under *Text* 3152, that—“The objections that the Buddhists forcibly urge against the arguments in support of the Omniscience of *Jina*, are also urged by the *Jainas* against the other party, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3351 above*]

‘*Without anger*’—Free from anger. In fact the Buddhists proceed to put forward those arguments only through pity for you, not, through anger or arrogance, like yourselves.

‘*This*’—Because it has been shown that the *Syādvāda* and other teachings propounded by him are defective.—(3351)
