> There could be ‘modification’ only if there were disappearance of one form followed by the appearance of another form,—as is found to be the case with ölay and other things;—it could not be possible however if all appeared without sequence (simultaneously).—(139)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“Even if things are accomplished simultaneously, why should not they be *modifications*?”

The Answer is supplied by the following Text:—[*see verse 139 above*]

In a thing in regard to which there was no ‘Sequence’, however, ‘modification’ would not be possible; the term ‘*tu*’, ‘however’, is to be construed with ‘*akrame*—From this it follows that it cannot be right to regard Things as ‘consisting of Sound’, through ‘modification’,—(139)

The following Text proceeds to show that the other alternative cannot be maintained:—[*see verse 140 next*]
