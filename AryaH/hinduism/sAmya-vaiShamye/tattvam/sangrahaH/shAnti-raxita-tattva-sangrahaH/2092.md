> Or, all cognition, when pure, would, as a rule, apprehend all things; though in a certain case, there may be some peculiarity in the resultant of the cognition, due to particular causes. For instance, the āmalakī is found to yield a smaller fruit; because the āmalakī growing in the desert has been found to yield a small fruit, it does not necessarily follow that it will always, in other places also, produce fruits of the same small size.—Similarly, there is the assertion that serpents hear through their eyes.—In fact, the capacities of, action belonging to all things are wonderful and anything might be possible for them.—(3390-3392)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If there is an Idealist who holds the view that the Omniscient Person apprehends all things by Perception through the Eye and other sense-organs themselves,—even, under his view, all notions and impressions of disability having been removed, all cognitions become applicable to all things and consequently all-pervading; as it is only the said Disability that goes to restrict the scope of cognitions. When, therefore, that Disability has been removed, how could there be any restriction upon the scope of Cognitions? With this opinion in view, the Author makes the following statement:—[*see verses 3390-3392 above*]

The nature of things is found to vary and become restricted under the influence of a variety of causes; it is not right therefore to deduce that a certain thing will always retain the same character that has been, perceived in it once; e.g. on seeing that the *Āmalakī* fruits growing in deserts are very small in size, no sane man can conclude that in all places,—even though there may be diverse causes operating,—they would be the same.—Hence it is quite possible that even through the *Eye*,—as improved by the practice of Yoga,—a man may become able to *see* all things. Hence there can be nothing incongruous in this possibility.—(3390-3392)
