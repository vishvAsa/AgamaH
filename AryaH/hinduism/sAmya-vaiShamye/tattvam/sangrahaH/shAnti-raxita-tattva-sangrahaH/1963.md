## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows in what way it is an impossibility—[*see verse 3137 above*]

As a matter of fact, it is impossible for men to know in detail all the atoms contained even in a single body; what to say of the knowledge of all the little details that go to make up the entire Universe?—(3137)
