> \(1\) Because it appears as ‘excluded’ (distinguished) from other ‘appearances’,—(2) because it is the basis (cause) of the cognition of a thing as ‘excluded’ from others,—(3) because it is cognised through an entity ‘excluded’ (from others),—and (4) because it is apprehended in the form of the ‘specific individuality’ consisting in the ‘exclusion’ of unlike things, by persons confounded by its sameness—the name ‘Apoha, exclusion, of others’ has been given to it, on the said basis.—(1007-1009½)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The name ‘*Apoha*’ has been applied to it on four grounds:—(1) Firstly and chiefly, because it itself appears as ‘excluded’ (distinguished) from the appearances imposed by other conceptions,—the name ‘*Apoha of others*’ has been applied, in the sense of *what is excluded*—‘*apohyate*’—*from others*—‘*anyasmāt*’.—On the other three grounds the name rests only indirectly (figuratively). (2) For instance, through imposing the character of the *Effect* upon the *Cause*; as when the name is applied because it is the cause of the cognition of a thing as ‘excluded’ from others;—(3) it is applied through imposing the character of the *Cause* upon the *Effect*; as when the name is applied ‘*aśliṣṭavastu-dvārā*’; i.e. ‘*through*’—by means of—*an* ‘*entity*’ which is ‘*aśliṣṭa*’—i.e. ‘*excluded from others*’; i.e, it proceeds from the apprehension of the said conception;—(4) the fourth ground lies in the fact that it is apprehended by persons confounded by its sameness with the ‘exclusion of unlike things

‘*Its sameness*’;—i.e. the sameness of the reflection of the object in the conceptual thought.

‘*On the said basis*’;—i.e. on the basis of the four facts, in the shape of its *appearing as excluded from other appearances* and so forth.—(1007-1008)
