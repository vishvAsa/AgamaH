> It was in view of all this that the assertion of ‘name, universal and the rest’ was made; and herein the teacher made mention of his own view as also the view of others; without indicating the difference by actually saying that ‘my own view is so and so’, it was for this reason that he subsequently added the statement that ‘others have held, etc.’.—(1235-1236)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* explains what *Diṅnāga* really means by asserting the Conceptual Content in two forms.—[*see verses 1235-1236 above*]

As to which of the two views is to be accepted and which rejected has been already indicated by us when we showed that even ‘association with Universal, etc.’ is invariably concomitant with ‘association with Name’,

‘*The assertion of Name*, *etc*.’—this is to be construed with ‘*akarot*’, ‘made’ (in the second line).

The assertion of his own view as also the view of others has been made for the purpose of showing which is to be accepted and which to be rejected.—(1235-1236)

*Question*:—“How then are the words of *Diṅnāga* in his *Nyāyamukha* to be construed?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1237 next*]
