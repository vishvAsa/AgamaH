> As regards the contention (under text 1659) that “negation must be cognised by a means which is of the same nature as itself”,—this is entirely superfluous; as even in what we assert there is that sameness of nature.—(1691)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*There is that sameness of nature*’,—the ‘non-apprehension’, in the shape of the apprehension of something else, being *negative* in character.

In this connection, some people urge the following objection;—“The cognition that envisages merely the absence of things cannot be included under Perception and the rest,—because it envisages only the *absence* (negation) of things, while Perception and the rest envisage positive things;—nor can it be regarded as invalid,—as it is in conformity with the real state of things. When you (Buddhists) postulate the absolute destruction of things, you cannot deny the *absence of things*

What has been explained above disposes of tins objection also. In the case in question, what the particular Conceptual Thought envisages is *not pure* negation devoid of all specifications of time, place, etc.,—it envisages the qualified Negation in the form that at a certain place ‘the Jar is not’; and that it is so is due to the fact that the Place, etc. have the capacity of being perceived. Thus it is that Negation is not regarded as a distinct Means or Form of Cognition; because what is conceived is only such empty place as has been apprehended by Perception.—Even if there were apprehension of *pure*, unqualified, Negation, the cognition apprehending it could not be regarded as valid, because it would be envisaging a *non-entity*; and all consideration of the validity of cognitions, by men seeking for effective action, relates to *entities* only.—What has been urged therefore is beneath notice.—(1691)

*End of Negation*.
