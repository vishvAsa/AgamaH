> The identity (of sound) with blue and other things being not figurative (but real),—why should not there be cognition of sound at the time that the blue and other things are cognised?—(133)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“What if the World remains primarily of the essence of Sound?”

The Answer is provided by the following Text:—[*see verse 133 above*]

*Identity of Blue*, *etc*.—i.e. with *Sound*.

*At the time that the Blue and other things are cognised*;—that is, under the circumstances when Blue, etc. are cognised;—*why should not there be cognition of Sound*?—that is to say, Sound also fulfilling all the conditions of perceptibility, it is only right that there should he perception of it, just as there is of Blue and other things.—(133)
