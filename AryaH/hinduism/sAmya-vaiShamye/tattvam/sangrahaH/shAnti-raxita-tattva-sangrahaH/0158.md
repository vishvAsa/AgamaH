> Whenever consciousness appears, it appears in its own form, independently of any other ‘illuminator’; so also the ‘cognition of other persons’;—hence your instance is devoid of the probandum.—(189)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As regards the *instance per similarity* cited in the same argument—“like the cognitions of other persons”,—it is one that is ‘devoid of the Probandum’ (i.e. the character meant to be proved is not present in it).—This is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 189 above*]

Inasmuch as the ‘cognition of other persons’ also appears in its own form, independently of any other ‘illuminator’,—this instance that you have cited is *devoid of the Probandum*,—*i.e*. devoid of the character that is sought to be proved,—viz. that of ‘being apprehended by a Cogniser distinct from the Body and the rest’,—(189)
