## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

On the subject of the *Means of Bight Cognition*, there are four kinds of difference of opinion bearing upon (1) their Nature, (2) their Resultant,

\(3\) their Object, and (4) their Number. And by setting aside these diverse opinions, the clear idea of the Means of Right Cognition can be obtained. In order to show this and to support the idea that ‘the Truth is ascertained by means of Two Means of Right Cognition which are endowed with the true characteristics of the Means of Right Cognition’ (as asserted under *Text* 3, of the Introduction),—the Author proceeds with the following—[*see verse 1213 above*]

‘*In proof of their concepts*’—i.e. such concepts as—Quality, Substance, Action, Universal, Inherence and so forth.

‘*Others*’—The *Vaiśeṣika* and others,

‘*Evam*’—as going to be described.—(1213)
