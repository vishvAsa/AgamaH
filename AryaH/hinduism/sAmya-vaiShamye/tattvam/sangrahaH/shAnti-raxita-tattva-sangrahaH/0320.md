> If the relation between the two (the permanent thing and the conditions) were held to be that of ‘inherence’ (subsistence), then also the following has got to be considered:—Is the ‘inherent’ thing so regarded because it is helpful? Or not so? If the former alternative is accepted, then it comes to be the same as the relation of ‘being produced from it’, and this has just been rejected.—(404-405)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be argued that—“the relation between the *condition* and the Permanent Entity is not that of *being produced from it*, but that of *inhering*

*in it*, the condition being inherent (subsisting) in the Permanent Thing”,—This cannot be right; this is shown in the Text with the words—‘*Then also, etc*.’—‘*Or not* *so*’;—the construction being—‘it is held to be inherent without being helpful’,—Under the first alternative, the *help* rendered being non-different from the Thing *helped*, it would come to be the same relation which has been spoken of above as that of *being, produced from* it; and this has been just rejected.—(404-405)

If the second alternative is accepted, then there being no distinction, everything would be ‘inherent’ in everything. This is what is explained in the following—[*see verse 406 next*]
