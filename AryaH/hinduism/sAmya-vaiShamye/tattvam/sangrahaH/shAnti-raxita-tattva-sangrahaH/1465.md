> “At the time that the connection is asserted, if the word ‘cow’ is uttered, some people, being cognisant of the connection, comprehend the meaning,—while others do not do so, consequently, if, at any time, the connection were non-existent, no one would comprehend its meaning,—it may be argued that—‘if the connection were there, all men would comprehend it’.—But that is not possible; because (even though there) the connection may not be known to certain persons.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra*, 30-31].—(2264-2265)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *texts* proceed to show that for the following reason also the notion of the Connection being made cannot be right, and consequently, the Connection must be eternal:—[*see verses 2264-2265 above*]

When some one says ‘This *Cow* should not be touched with the foot’, some people, having been cognisant of the Connection of *Denoted and Denoter* between the word and the particular animal, comprehend the object, through that Connection; while others who are not cognisant of the Connection comprehend only the verbal form, not its meaning. Such being the case, if the Connection were not a real entity, then all men, experienced in usage, would be unable to comprehend the meaning. Because the same thing cannot have the two mutually contradictory characters of being *existent* and *nonexistent*. From this it follows that the Connection must be there permanently.

Says the Opponent—‘If the Connection is always there, then how is it that all men do not have the comprehension of the meaning at all times?’

The *Mīmāṃsaka* anticipates this objection and supplies the detailed answer to it, in the words—‘*If the Connection were there*, *etc. etc*.’.—‘*That is not possible*, *etc*.’ sets aside the objection.

Why so?

‘*Because the Connection may not be known to certain persons*.’—(2264-2265)
