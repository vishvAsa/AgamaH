> Thus we conclude that it is at the second moment that the effect comes into existence out of an efficient cause which came into existence at the first moment and has not yet been destroyed.—If it had been held that the effect comes into existence at the third moment, then it would come out of the destroyed cause; as the cause of the development will have been destroyed, like the effect itself,—as is going to be explained later on.—There would be simultaneity only if the effect had come at the first moment. but this cannot be right,—being just like the doctrine of the effects coming into existence along with the cause.—(512-514)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text* the author sums up his position and shows that there is no flaw in the view that the Effect is produced from the Cause while the latter is still in existence:—[*see verses 512-514 above*]

As regards the alternative of the Effect coming out of the *destroyed* Cause, that is improper, as it is not held by us. As that alternative would mean that the Effect comes at the third and subsequent moments,—as has been held by the *Vaibhāṣikas*, in such assertions as—‘the one presents (the effect) when it is past’; if this view were held, then it would mean the admission of the view that the Effect comes from the *destroyed* Cause;—but such is not the view held by us; because it is devoid of reason.—

There might have been some chance of the anomaly of the Cause and Effect being simultaneous if the view were that the Effect comes at the *first* moment; as these same *Vaibhāṣikas* regard the Cause as ‘born along with the Effect This is entirely unreasonable.—(512-514)

Why this is unreasonable is shown in the following—[*see verse 515 next*]
