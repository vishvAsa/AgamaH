> “All subsequent cognitions are apprehended by that same cogniser who apprehended the first cognition immediately on birth,—because they are my cognitions,—like that first forerunner of those cognitions.”—(185)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As regards the question as to how the *eternality* and *omnipresence* of the Soul are to be proved,—*Aviddhakarṇa* has propounded the following argument:—“The cognitions that I have had since my birth must have had the same *cogniser* who had the first cognition immediately after my coming out of my mother’s womb,—because they are *my* cognitions,—like my *first* cognition.—The same reasoning may be stated in regard to Pain and other experiences also.—This is the inferential reasoning that proves the *eternality* of the Soul.”

This argument is set forth in the following Text:—[*see verse 185 above*]

*Like the first forerunner*, *etc*.—i.e. the first forerunner of all subsequent cognitions.—(185)
