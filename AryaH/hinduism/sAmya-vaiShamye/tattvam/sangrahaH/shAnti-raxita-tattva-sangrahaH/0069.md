> For us, eternal things cannot produce any effects, because ‘consecutive’ and ‘concurrent’ action are mutually contradictory; and if objects are consecutive, there must be the same consecutiveness in their cognitions also.—(76)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Any such *eternal things* as God and the like *cannot produce any effects*; because in any productive activity of an Eternal Thing, there is incompatibility between ‘Consecutiveness’ and ‘Concurrence’; hence only non-eternal things can be productive causes; as it is these alone which go on unceasingly changing their sequential character—of being *present* now and *past* at the next moment. Thus it is proved that an Intelligent Maker must be evanescent and many.

As regards' the assertion (of the *Naiyāyika*) that “God is endowed with eternal and one Consciousness”,—this is contrary to all reason; this is what is indicated by the words ‘*If objects are consecutive*, etc.’ [Objects being fleeting, evanescent, according to the *Naiyāyika* also, their cognitions also must be evanescent; hence there can be no eternal cognition or consciousness ].—(76)
