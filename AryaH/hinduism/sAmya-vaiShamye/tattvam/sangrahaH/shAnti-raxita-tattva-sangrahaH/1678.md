> If it is held that—“the connection (or relationship) is only a kind of potency, and there can be no diversity in potency”,—then the potency of the word and its meaning would be one and the same, as there would be no distinction.—Even if there were some distinction, there could be no connection between the potency and those two.—If it were something produced, then it could not be eternal; and there is no other possibility for anything.—(2640-2641)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2262, that—“the Connection is only a kind of Potency, etc, etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2640-2641 above*]:

‘*There is no other, etc. etc*.’—There being objections—as explained before—to the Potency being or not being of the nature of both.—(2640-2641)
