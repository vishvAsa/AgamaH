> If things consisted of eternal ‘sound’, they also would be eternal; and hence as things would be accomplished simultaneously with the sound, no ‘modification’ would be compatible.—(138)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author states another objection (to the *Sound-theory*)—in the following Text:—[*see verse 138 above*]

*If Things consisted of eternal Sound*,—i.e. if they were of the same nature as eternal Sound,—i.e. if Sound constitutes the very essence of the World,—then Things also should be held to be eternal; and hence as at all times *the Things would be accomplished simultaneously with Sound*,—on account of their being so accomplished,—it is not possible for them to be of the nature of ‘modifications’,—‘*Tat*’ stands for ‘*tasmāt*’, *Hence*.

Or the ‘simultaneity’ meant may be that of all such things as the *Blue* and the like.—(138)
