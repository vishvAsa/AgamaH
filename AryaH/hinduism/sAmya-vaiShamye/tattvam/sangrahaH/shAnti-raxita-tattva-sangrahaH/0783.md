> Thus, individuals being denoted by words, they are also capable of being ‘excluded’. As regards the universal, there can be no ‘exclusion even if there were ‘exclusion’ of it, it could not have the character of the ‘entity’.—(1080)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* reasserts the fact of the Opponent’s Reason being ‘not-admitted’:—[*see verse 1080 above*]

It has been asserted (under 955) that—“in that case what would be *excluded* would be the Universal; and as subject to Exclusion, this Universal would be an entity”;—and the author now shows that the Reason—‘Because Individualities cannot be excluded’ is ‘not admitted’ and it is also ‘Inconclusive’—by the words ‘*As regards the Universal* *etc. etc*.’—there can be no exclusion of it; because it has been shown that there can be *exclusion* of Individuals only.

‘*Even if there were*, *etc*.’—that is to say, if the said Reason is put forward in support of the conclusion contrary to the Opponent’s, there would be nothing to set aside such a conclusion.—(1080)
