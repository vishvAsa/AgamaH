> The fact of the deities being called ‘*trisatya*’ cannot lead to any certainty (regarding validity); in fact, if this certainty does not follow from the very first (statement), it cannot follow from others.—(3027)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted under *Text* 2884, that—“it is for this same reason that Deities are called *Tri-satya* (Three-truth)”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3027 above*]

‘*From the first*’—i.e. from the first statement;—if the certainty does not follow,—then that certainty cannot follow *from, others*—i.e. from the two statements coming later on.—(3027)

The same idea is further elucidated:—[*see verse 3028 next*]
