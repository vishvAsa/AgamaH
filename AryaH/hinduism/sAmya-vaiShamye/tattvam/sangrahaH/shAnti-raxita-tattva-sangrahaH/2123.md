> When a man is seated in a hut, the sense-perception that he has has its range restricted within that hut, it does not extend to another hut;—all this you could be in a position to assert with certainty only when you had the direct apprehension of the capacity of all things; otherwise, on what could such certainty be based?—(3463-3464)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 3170, that—“While the man is seated in a hut, the Sense-perception that he has has its range restricted within that hut, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3463-3464 above*]

When you made this statement you made it entirely on the basis of that assertion itself; for people of limited vision, mere non-apprehension cannot justify any certainty regarding the incapacity of *all* men to cognise super-sensuous things.—(3463-3464)
