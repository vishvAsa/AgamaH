> “The only means (of comprehending the meaning) consists in the perceiving of its repeated comprehension by experienced people. and certainly the failure of such means cannot be admitted, in regard to the bringing about of the comprehension”.—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandha-kṣepaparihāra*, 138-139].—(2779)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* shows how the said Reason would be Inadmissible:—[*see verse 2779 above*]

The comprehension of the Relationship by experienced persons—perceived again and again—is the only way of asserting that Relationship: unless one knows the Relationship himself, he cannot speak of it to another person.

‘*The failure of such means*,’—i.e. the said means being ineffective.

‘*The comprehension*’—of the Relationship.—(2779)
