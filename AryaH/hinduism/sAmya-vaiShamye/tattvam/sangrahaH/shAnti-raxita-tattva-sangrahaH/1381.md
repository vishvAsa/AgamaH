> “If it be urged that—‘in the case of such things as the flame, it is found that though it exists for one moment only, yet there is recognition’,—the answer is that it is not so; what is recognised in these cases is the universal, and that is eternal, for us. In cases where there is notion of difference in regard to any aspect of the thing, on account of certain circumstantial conditions,—there is no recognition, as is clear from the notion of difference.”—(2119-2120).



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* anticipate and answer the objection that Recognition is not infallible (not always true):—[*see verses 2119-2120 above*]

‘*Such things*’—this includes the cases of Hail, nails and grass, etc.—which are cut and grow again,—as also that of water-falls; as in these cases also there is Recognition that these are the same Hairs and Nails, the same grasses, the water-fall, the same river-water and so forth.

This is not right. In all these case what is *recognised* is the *Universal*,—the commonalty—such as ‘Fire’ (in the case of the Lamp) and so forth; and this Universal is held to he eternal; where then is there any *falsity* in our Premiss? The individual form of these things, which is evanescent, that certainly is not *recognised* (as being the *same*); where then is there any falsity in our Premiss?

‘*In regard to any aspect*’—as in regard to the greater or less degree.

‘*On account of certain circumstantial conditions*’—the lesser degree being due to going upward.

*Question*:—How do you know that there is no Recognition in such cases?

*Answer*:—‘*As is clear from the notion of difference*’,—it is deduced from the presence of the notion of difference that there is in such cases.—(2119-2120)
