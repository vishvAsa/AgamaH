> If validity is admitted in some cases, even when there is no absence of the sublating cognition,—then why should there be hostility against the initial cognition?—(3007)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to confirm the view that the Opponent’s view involves an Infinite Regress:—[*see verse 3007 above*]

If, in order to avoid Infinite Regress, it be held that in some cases there is validity, even though the sublating Cognition is not absent,—then, in the case of the initial Cognition also, there need be no dependence upon *the* *absence* *of* *sublation*; and in this way, all Cognitions would be equally valid.—(3007)
