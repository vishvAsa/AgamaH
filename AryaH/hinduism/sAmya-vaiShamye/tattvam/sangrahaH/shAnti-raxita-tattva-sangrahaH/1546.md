> Does the ‘character of being a product’ make things the source of wrong cognitions? In that case, smoke would not be the correct indicator of fire.—(2405)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That alone can be a qualification of the Reason (Probans) which serves to differentiate the Probans from the contrary of the Probandum;—otherwise, if any and every qualification could make the Reason *conclusive*, then no Reason could ever be *Inconclusive*; because qualifications would easily be available by the mere wish for it;—the character of *not being a Product* does not set aside its *capacity to bring about wrong notions*; because if *being a product were* known to be the cause of *being a source of wrong notions*, then the absence of the former might mean the absence of the latter also.

The Opponent might say—“It *is* so known”.

The answer to that is—‘*In that case, etc*. *etc*.’—If the *character of being a Product* were the reason for *being the source of wrong notions*,—then *the character of not being a Product* would be the reason for *being the source of right notions*;—because Right and Wrong Cognitions being mutually contradictory, both could not proceed from one and the same cause; e.g. Fire, which is the source of *Heat*, cannot be the source of *gold*; consequently, as *Smoke* is a *product*, it could not be the means of the *Right Notion* of Fire.—(2405)
