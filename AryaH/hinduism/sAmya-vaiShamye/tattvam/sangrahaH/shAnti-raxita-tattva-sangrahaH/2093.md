## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the other party, under *Text* 3159, that—“The perception of certain things through certain causes in the past was exactly as it is found to appear at the present time”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3393 above*]

‘*With their capacities restricted*’—construe thus—‘to whom all things appear as restricted in the desired manner’.—(3393)

*Question*:—“What is the assertion that sounds well?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3394-3396 next*]
