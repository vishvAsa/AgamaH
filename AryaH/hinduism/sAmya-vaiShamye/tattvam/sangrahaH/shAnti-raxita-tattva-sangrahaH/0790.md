> Just as we have explained the fact of ‘the exclusion of other things’ being denoted by words,—exactly in the same manner should be understood the ‘exclusion of other words’ also.—(1088)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under 961, by *Kumārila*) that—“you cannot secure diversity among words also, on the basis of Impressions”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1088 above*]

‘*Just as, etc. etc*.’:—i.e. as being in the form of Reflection; of which the difference from other Reflections is clearly perceived.

Hence what has been discussed in detail (by the Opponent) is entirely irrelevant.—Such is the sense of the *Text*.—(1088)
