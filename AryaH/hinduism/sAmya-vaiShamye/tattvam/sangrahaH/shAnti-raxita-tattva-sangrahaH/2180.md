> Those teachers who were under the influence of greed, fear, hatred, jealousy, etc. and were devoid of mercy,—it is the teaching of such persons which could be partial and local.—(3570) 
>
> Those teachers, on the other hand, who were led by mercy alone,—who had a clear perception of the truth,—who had no fear of any contradiction,—imparted their teachings to all. As a man, through ignorance, goes on being affected by defects, so there grows in the lords, mercy towards him.—They do not desire to establish any such connection with men as that of *vivāha* (marriage) or *āvāha* (home-coming of the bride) and so forth; the only thought in their mind is that of doing good to others. That is what has been so well sung of.—(3571-3573) 
>
> ‘The wise ones view with equal regard—the Brāhmaṇa equipped with learning and character, the bull, the elephant, the dog and the dog-eater.’—[Bhagavadgītā].—(3574)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 3570*]:

The following *text* shows that it is in the case of *Manu* and other teachers, who imparted the teaching to Vedic scholars alone, that it is possible for the teachings to have been propounded for the purpose of deluding those people:—[*see verse 3570 above*]

On the other hand, the Teaching of the Blessed Lord was imparted to all men down to the veriest child;—and such Teaching only bears testimony to their high-souled character.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 3571-3573 above*]

[*verses 3571-3573*]

‘*Āvāha*’—is the coming of the Bride to the house of the Bridegroom.—(3571-3573)

*Question*;—“What has been so well sung of?”

*Answer*;—[*see verse 3574 above*]
