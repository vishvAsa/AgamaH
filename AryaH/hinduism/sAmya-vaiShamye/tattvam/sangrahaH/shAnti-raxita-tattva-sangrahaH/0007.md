> “How is it that people have recourse to only specific causes, in the shape of such diverse things as the paddy-seed and the like, and not any other,—even though the nonexistence (of the desired effect or product) is equal (everywhere)?”



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In support of the second reason set forth [as above, in *Sāṃkhyakārikā*. 9, “Because there is always recourse to the Cause”], the following argument has been put forward (by the *Sāṃkhya*):—[*see verse 9 above*]

“If the Effect were non-existent, then people would not have had recourse to only specific causes (productive of particular Products). For instance, when a man wants paddy-grains, he takes up *paddy-seeds*, not *Kodrava-*seeds; when a man, thinking of feeding Brāhmaṇas the next day, wishes to have curds ready for the purpose, he secures a supply of *milk*, not *water*. As regards the ‘non-existence’ of the Paddy-grain or the Curd, this ‘non-existence’ (according to the Opponent) is there as much in the Paddy-seed as in the *Kodrava-*seed (and as much in milk as in water); then how is it, that though the ‘non-existence’ of the Paddy-grain and other products is *equal everywhere* (in the Paddy-seed as well as in other seeds), yet it is only the specific seeds that are secured; the persons wanting the paddy-grain could secure the *Kodrava* and other seeds also,—inasmuch as the Paddy-grain would be as ‘non-existent’ in these latter as in the Paddy-seeds.—If it be urged that those other seeds are not secured by people because the desired grain is not there in them,—then, in that case, the person wanting paddy-grain also should not secure the Paddy-seed, as the desired grain *is not* there also (according to the Opponent),—exactly as in the *Kodrava-*seed. But this is what never happens. Hence it follows that the particular Effect (Paddy-grain) is actually present in the particular Cause (Paddy-seed).”—(9)
