> The teaching of the Buddhas is certainly not based upon the Veda; because it has been described as ‘flawless’, while the Veda is full of flaws.—(3567)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued, under *Text* 3226, that—“If it were based upon the Veda, then they should have imparted it to the expounders of the Veda itself, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verse 3567 above*]

It cannot be possible for the *flawless* Teaching to be based upon what is *full of flaws*.—(3567)
