> From that same reasoning of yours it might follow that the invalidity is inherent in cognitions; as the same arguments apply clearly to, and can be asserted in regard to, that view also;—hence it is the absence of excellence that follows from the defects; and from that absence follows the absence of validity; hence the general law stands undenied.—Inasmuch as this general law is the creation of mere whim, it can be asserted quite clearly in regard to invalidity, just as well as in regard to validity.—Because it is in the nature of apprehension that cognition is regarded as invalid,—and it is discarded only by the knowledge that it is right, in accordance with the reality of things, and by the cognition of the excellence of its sources;—and the invalidity is not set aside by the excellences, as these have not been cognised; hence being not-denied, the invalidity remains established as being inherent in the cognition.—(3066-3070)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to show the ‘Inconclusive’ character of the reasoning set forth in the assertion that—“From Excellences follows the absence of defects, etc.”.—(*Ślokavārtika* 1. 1. 2; 65):—[*see verses 3066-3070 above*]

‘*Adaḥ*’—This.

*Question*:—“What is it that can be asserted?”

*Answer*:—It is this:—‘*Hence it is the absence, etc. etc.'*

‘*Mānavat*’—the ‘*vati*’-affix is added after the Locative, the meaning being—‘*as in regard to validity*’.

‘*Tadapi*’—Invalidity.

The rest is easily understood.—(3066-3070)
