> As a matter of fact, pleasure, etc. are felt immediately after the perception of the external object; why is it that they are always felt at that same time?—It is regarded as cognised by mental perception; but this perception is not there at the time; as cognitions have been described as appearing in succession (not at the same time).—If it be urged that “it is only simultaneous birth of cognitions that is not admitted, not their simultaneous existence”,—then the answer is that there can be no (continued) existence of anything; as all things have been proved to be momentary.—If it be urged that “there is an illusion of simultaneity, due to the quick succession of the cognitions”,—this also has been rejected already.—If the pleasure, etc., were amenable only to remembrance, then the feeling could not be vivid (as it is).—If it be assumed that the said illusion is in the form of ‘agreeable’ and ‘disagreeable’,—then it comes to this that the existence of pleasure and pain rests in themselves (and they are thus self-cognised).—When the mystics cognise, by sense-perception, the pleasure, etc. of other persons,—then, on account of the similarity of experience, they would themselves be unhappy (at the unhappiness of other people). For you, the feeling of pain consists, not in the existence of the pain itself, but in the cognition of which that pain is the object; and that is another ‘chain’.—The same applies to the inference of another person’s pain also, as inference has been described (by others) as objective (with object), and not purely subjective (not touching objects).—(1332-1339)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It is meant to show that the Proposition (of the *Vaiśeṣika*) is contrary to perceived facts.

When, as a matter of fact, Pleasure, etc., are apprehended at the same time as the Cognition of the external object upon which they rest,—then by which particular cognition subsisting in the same substratum as themselves would they be apprehended?—Certainly not by that Visual Cognition of the external object; as this rests upon the external object, while Pleasure, etc. are felt within and as such they are held to be cognisable by mental Cognition only. And yet at the time concerned there can be no mental Cognition; because the theory held is that Cognitions appear in succession, one after the other.

It might be held that—“it is only the *birth* of Cognitions that has been held to be *in succession*, not their *existence*”.

That cannot be right; as it has been established that all that is born has only a momentary existence.

As regards the explanation that “there is only an illusion of simultaneity, due to the quickness of the succession”,—this has been already refuted.

Then again, under the view suggested, the clear perception of Pleasure and Pain, in the form of *joy* and *grief*, would not be possible; because the view held is that Pleasure and Pain, envisaging Conceptual Contents, are apprehended only by Mental Perception; and Mental Perception is Conceptual; and what is conceptual cannot make the appearance of things quite clear. Under our view on the other hand, what is regarded as *Sense-perception* is that which is brought about by the Cognition brought about by the Sense-organs, which is,aided by the object coming into existence immediately after the object of the said Sense-perception.

Further, if Pleasure and Pain were actually apprehensible, their manifestation would be as something separate, as in the case of the *Blue* and other things; and yet if they were separated from the cognition, they could not be felt as *agreeable* and *disagreeable*.

It might be argued that—“as there is no difference from the Cognition, the idea of *agreeableness* and *disagreeableness* must be wrong”.

In that case it becomes established that the existence of Pleasure and Pain rests in their own cognition; because Pleasure and Pain have no other form apart from what is *agreeable* and *disagreeable*; and if it is admitted that the Cognition has this form, then it also becomes admitted that Pleasure and Pain also are of the nature of Cognition itself. Any other form not being admitted, it cannot be admitted that they are mere illusions.

‘*Agreeable*’ is that which is favourable, and the opposite of this is ‘disagreeable’,

The term ‘and the rest’ (after ‘Pleasure’) includes *Indifference*.

If then the existence of Pleasure, etc., consists only in the appearance of their own ‘Chain’,—and it is not accepted that the same constitutes their *apprehension* also,—but it is held that their apprehension must consist in the appearance of the cognition regarding themselves,—then, in that case? when Mystics apprehend the Pleasure, etc., of other persons, they should be just as unhappy as the persons actually experiencing the Pain, etc., and it is not open to you to say that “it cannot be so, as they belong to separate *chains*”; because you do not admit that their continuance consists in the fact of their appearance in the same ‘chain’; what you accept is only the appearance of the Cognition of the Pain; and the cognition is present in the ‘chain’ of other people also; so that the incongruity remains.

If, as the cause of Pleasure, etc. you accept both,—then, inasmuch as the Pleasure, etc. would be present in their own ‘chains’, it becomes proved that they are *self-cognised*. In this way, ‘presence in one’s own *chain*’ serves to distinguish them from those ‘present in other *chains*’.

*Question*:—“If Pleasure, etc. are of the nature of their own cognition, then, how can the said incongruity of mystic perception be urged against those—*Mīmāṃsakas* for instance,—who do not admit of any *mystics*?”

*Answer*:—‘*The same applies, etc*. *etc*.’—Except Buddhists, there are no philosophers for whom Inference is, in reality, devoid of *objectivity*; hence, for one who *infers* the Pain of other persons (just as the Mystic who perceives it), there would be the same experiencing of pain—[so that the said incongruity would be there all the same].—(1332-1339)
