> But the existence of a being who is eternal, one, and the substratum of eternal all-embracing consciousness,—can never be proved; as the invariable concomitance (premiss) that may be cited would be devoid of the probandum.—(72)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

What you (*Navyāyika*) desire to prove is, not only that the World has been created by an Intelligent Maker, but that it is preceded (produced) by the intelligent Entity known as God, who is the Cause of the whole World, being himself one, *eternal and the substratum of an eternal all-embracing Consciousness*. In fact, it is this entity that forms the subject of dispute. The existence of such a Being cannot be proved;—why?—because the Invariable Concomitance (that might be put forward to prove Its existence) will be *devoid of the Probandum* (the character to be proved); for the simple reason that any positive Corroborative Instance that might be cited in the form of the Jar and such things would be lacking in the element of similarity that is essential [the maker of the Jar not having all the character that is predicated of God], and this would make it impossible to prove the necessary Invariable Concomitance between the Probans and the Probandum; as in no particular Instance (of any Product) is there any invariable concomitance between the Pro bans and the character of the Probandum as postulated (by the *Naiyāyika*).—(72)

With a view to showing the same, the following Text proceeds to add the following:—[*see verse 73 next*]
