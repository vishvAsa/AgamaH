> In fact, the Apoha is denoted as apprehended in the form of the individual; and the Apoha therefore is connected with gender, etc. through that individual.—(1143)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even granting that these (Gender, Number, Action, etc.) belong to things,—inasmuch as the *Apoha* in the form of the ‘Reflected Image’ is apprehended by deluded persons as something external,—through this apprehension, connection with Gender, Number and the rest would be there through the Individual,—Hence what has been asserted (by *Kumārila*, under 973) to the effect that—“the Individual being something that cannot be spoken of by words, the connection cannot be through that either”,—is ‘Inconclusive’.

It is also ‘unproven’, ‘unadmitted’, under the theory that all this is purely ‘illusory’; tins latter fact is shown in the following—[*see verse 1143 above*]

‘*Apoha is denoted*’—by the Word.

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.

‘*Asya*’—of the *Apoha*.—(1143)
