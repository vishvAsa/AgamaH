> When letters are expressive, with distinct meanings, and appear in a particular order of sequence,—they come to be known as ‘word’, ‘sentence’ and such groups; it is these that have been so spoken of as ‘aggregates—and it has been shown that all this—expressiveness, distinct meanings and order of sequence—is impossible in the case of words not emanating from personalities.—Hence the invariable concomitance (premiss, put forward by the buddhist) remains unshaken.—(2782-2783)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *text* points out the all-embracing character of the said Reason (Premiss):—[*see verses 2782-2783 above*]

‘*So spoken of,*’—i.e. as ‘aggregates

If Letters do not emanate from Personalities, then all this—expressiveness and the rest—is impossible; this has been proved by us already. And thus our Invariable Concomitance (i.e. the Premiss) becomes fully established.—(2782-2783)
