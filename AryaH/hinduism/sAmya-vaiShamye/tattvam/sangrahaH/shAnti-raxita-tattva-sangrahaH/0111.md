> Thus it is really the ‘productive’ cause which is spoken of as ‘indicative’; it is because it does not actually produce (bring into existence) what is desired to be accomplished that it is not called ‘productive’.—(126)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“If this is so, then how do the Teachers make the distinction between the *Indicative* and the *Productive*?”

The answer given in the following text is that the ‘Indicative’ is so called because it *makes the thing known*, and what is called ‘productive’ is that which actually brings into existence the thing concerned:—[*see verse 126 above*]

It is called ‘Indicative’,—and not ‘Productive—because it does not actually produce what is desired to be accomplished; while that which actually produces what is desired to be accomplished,—such as the *Sprout* and the like,—is called ‘Productive Hence there is nothing wrong in the distinction that has been made.

This answers all the objections that may be urged against the declaration of *Ācārya Sūri*. For instance, the following is an objection that may be raised—“Even when asserting with Reason that *there is no Cause*, why should one demolish his own conclusion? As what he asserts is an *Indicative* Reason, while what he denies is the *Productive* Cause”.—The answer to this is as follows:—The *Indicative* Reason also is a *Productive* Cause, because it *produces* the cognition of the thing.—This urges against the other party the fact of his assertions being self-contradictory. In fact, there can be no Reason that could prove the absence of all Cause,—because such a proposition would be clearly one that is contrary to, and set aside by, sense-perception and the rest.—(126)
