> “The reflection cannot be an entity, because two things cannot exist together at the same place; then how can it be regarded as an effect, which must be something real”,—if this is urged [then the answer is as in the following text].—(1427)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following Text the author sets forth the objection from the Opponent’s standpoint:—[*see verse 1427 above*]

For the idea that the Reflection cannot be an entity, the Reason is—*two things cannot exist together*; the Reflection is perceived as occupying the same place as the reflecting surface of the Mirror, and it is not possible for the forms of two things to be seen at the same place; as there would always be an obstacle; hence it cannot be possible for any two things to exist at the same place. Hence the idea must be regarded as illusory.

Or [there may be another explanation of the Text]—*Two things cannot exist together at the same place*;—which *two things*?—The surface of the reflecting mirror and the Reflection of the Moon; the surface of the Mirror occupies one point in space, and the Reflection of the Moon occupies a different point in space, inside the Mirror; like the water at the bottom of the well, When a thing is produced in one place, how can it be perceived in another place? Hence it follows that there is no such Entity as the Reflection; and the perception is due to the force of the attendant circumstances:—unthinkable indeed are the diverse forces of things!—(1427)

The above objection is answered as follows:—[*see verses 1428-1429 next*]
