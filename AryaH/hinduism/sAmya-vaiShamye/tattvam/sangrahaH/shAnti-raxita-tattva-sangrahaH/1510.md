> “As regards the argument based upon the fact of the Veda being an aggregate, the counter-argument should be stated as follows:—All Vedic study (by any person) is always preceded by previous ‘study’ by his teacher,—because it is called ‘Vedic study’—like the ‘study’ carried on at the present time—[*Ślokavārtika*—on sentence, 365-366].—(2341b-2342)

> “The argument might be urged in regard to the Mahābhārata also; but it is blocked by the distinct ‘remembrance’ (mention) of its writer. though there are such ‘remembrances’ in regard to the Veda also,—yet, they are all based upon ‘commendatory’ description”.—[*Ślokavārtika*—on sentence, 367].—(2343)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2341a*]:

‘It’—stands for the *Veda*.—(2341)

The Opponent has urged (under *Text* 2338 the fact of the Veda being on ‘aggregate’ as a reason for its unreliability. By means of a counterreason, the *Mīmāṃsaka* shows that the said reason is ‘Inconclusive’:—[*see verses 2341b-2342 above*]

[*verses 2341b-2342*]:

Says the Opponent—The same can be said in regard to the ‘study’ of the *Mahābhārata* also: all ‘study’ of the *Mahābhārata* is always preceded by the previous study by the Teacher,—like the ‘study’ at the present time; but it will not be right to argue thus; hence the counter-argument put forward is ‘inconclusive’.

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2343 above*]

[*verse 2343*]:

The same argument might be urged in regard to the *Mahābhārata* also; but the Author, Vyāsa, is clearly ‘remembered’ (mentioned); hence such an assertion is rendered impossible by this mention of the author, and hence cannot be made. There is no such *mention* of the ‘Author’ in the case of the Veda.

Says the Opponent—In regard to the Veda also, the Author is mentioned, in such passages as—‘*Agnirāvaścakruḥ sāmāni*... *atharvānāṅgirasaḥ*’.

The answer to this is—‘*Though there are such*, *etc, etc*.’—As regards the mention of ‘authors’ in the Veda, *that is based upon commendatory description*; ‘*arthuvāda*’ is the ‘*vāda*’, description, of ‘*artha*’, ‘facts’; this description is the basis of the said mention (of Authors in the Veda); hence the word ‘*cakruḥ*’ in the passage quoted does not stand for *creating* or *producing*, but for *remembering*; so the meaning is that the persons named ‘*remembered*’ the *Sāman*, etc.—(2343)

*Question*:—How has this meaning been determined?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2344-2345 next*]
