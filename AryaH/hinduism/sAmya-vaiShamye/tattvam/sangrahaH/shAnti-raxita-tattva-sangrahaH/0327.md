> If the thing possessed of the causal potency disappears, after having brought about all its effects simultaneously,—then its momentariness becomes established.—(414)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That is, does the *nature* of the thing consisting in its capacity for effective action disappear, after having brought about all the effects simultaneously? Or does it continue to exist?—These are the only two alternatives possible.—If it is held that it disappears, then that establishes its momentary character; as at each moment fresh natures would be appearing, one after the other, each preceding nature becoming destroyed by itself.—(414)
