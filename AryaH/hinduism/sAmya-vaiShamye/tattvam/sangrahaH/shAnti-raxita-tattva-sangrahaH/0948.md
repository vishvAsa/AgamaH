> This cannot be right the effective action available is not in keeping with the form apprehended. otherwise there would be incongruities; as in the cognition where there is appearance of the hair and such things, there is compatibility, though only with the light (which is not apprehended) and other details; hence the validity of this would be irresistible (under the opponent’s view).—(1325-1326)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The validity of a cognition is of two kinds—(1) when there is compatibility with the *appearance*, and (2) when there is compatibility with the *Apprehension*.—In the case in question (of the idea of the ‘yellow conch-shell’), the ‘absence of incongruence’—(i.e. compatibility)—is not in accordance with the *appearance*, as what appears—what is apparent—is the *yellow* conch-shell; and yet what is found (on touching) is not the yellow thing;—nor is its compatibility in accordance with the *apprehension*, because it is the *yellow thing* itself that is apprehended as capable of a particular fruitful activity; and yet no fruitful activity in that form is actually found.—Nor can there be validity even when there is compatibility with what is not apprehended at all; as that would lead to absurdity; as in the case of the cognition of the Hair-tuft also, what is actually got at is only the light (whose reflections create the impression of the Hair-tuft).—(1325-1326)
