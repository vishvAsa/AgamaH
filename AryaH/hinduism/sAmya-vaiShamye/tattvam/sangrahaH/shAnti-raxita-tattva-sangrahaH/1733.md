> If the reason put forward is only amenability to sense-organs, it is certainly not recognised as fallacious,—in view of the fact that the ‘universal’ has already been discarded.—(2744)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2744, that—“If the Reason that is put forward is only *amenability to sense-organs*, then it is clearly fallacious, etc. etc.”.

‘*Already*’—under the chapter dealing with the ‘Universal—(2744)
