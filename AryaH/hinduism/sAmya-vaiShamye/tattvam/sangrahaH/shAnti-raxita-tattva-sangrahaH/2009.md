> “If any person similar to the omniscient person were seen at the present time, then alone could the existence of the omniscient person be cognised on the strength of analogy.”—(3215)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that the Omniscient Person cannot be vouched for by ‘Analogy’:—[*see verse 3215 above*]

Analogy, as a Means of Cognition—based upon similarity and its adjuncts,—envisages the far off things, and is invariably concomitant with the Cognition of a *similar* thing; for example, there is remembrance of the Cow through the perception of the *Gavaya*;—it is not possible for any one to perceive at the present time any person *similar* to the Omniscient Person;—hence, on account of the *similar thing* not being perceptible, Analogy cannot be operative in the case in question.

This argument may be formulated as follows:—When any object similar to an object is not perceptible, the latter cannot be amenable to Analogy,—e.g, the Son of the Barren Woman;—any person similar to the Omniscient Person is not perceptible;—so there is non-apprehension of the wider character.—(3215)
