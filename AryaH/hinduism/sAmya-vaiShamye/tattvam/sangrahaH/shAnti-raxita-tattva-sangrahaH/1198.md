> If a certain thing were excluded from one ‘entity’, it would be devoid of sameness only with that entity; it would not become like the ‘sky-flower’;—as it would still be capable of efficient action.—(1750)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 1712, above)—“For that which has been excluded from ‘Entity’, where could there be any other position?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1750 above*]

If what is cited as the Reason is ‘exclusion of *all* entities’,—and similarity to the ‘sky-flower’ is meant to be proved by it,—then the Reason is ‘inadmissible’; because the exclusion of the Jar from *all entities*, cannot be admitted; all that can be admitted is that it is excluded or differentiated from things other than itself.

If, on the other hand, the Reason meant to be adduced is exclusion from *some things*, then it is ‘Inconclusive’.

For instance, the Jar, excluded or differentiated from the *Cloth* and other things, could be recognised only as devoid of sameness with the Cloth, and it could not be recognised as absolutely devoid of essence (existence), as even as thus excluded, it would be *capable of efficient action*,—(1750)
