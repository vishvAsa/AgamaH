## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been urged (under *Text* 136) that “all things would occupy the same point in space and would be cognised in one and the same form”;—the following Text raises an objection from the point of view of the other party:—[*see verse 144 above*]

The following view might be urged by the Opponent:—“The one Principle of *Brahman remains always undifferentiated*,—essentially unmodified in reality, there is no *modification* of It; what happens is that people having their minds and eyes clouded by the darkness of Ignorance, regard It as *diverse*, in such forms as the *Blue* and the like. This has been thus declared:—‘Even though *Ākāśa* (Space) is pure, yet obsessed by darkness, people come to regard it as limited and made up of diversified parts; in the same manner, though *Brahman* is immortal and unmodifiable, yet It appears to be sullied by Nescience and hence diversely modified’,—Under the circumstances, there would be no such absurdity as all things occupying the same point in Space; because in reality all things are non-entities, therefore there would be diversity in their cognitions also,—the diversity being due to the oscillations of Nescience”.—(144)

The above argument is answered by the following Texts:—[*see verse 145 next*]
