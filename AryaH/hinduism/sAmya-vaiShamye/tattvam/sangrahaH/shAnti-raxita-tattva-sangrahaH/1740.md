> “The perishability (non-eternality) of the lamp-flame is not admitted. What happens in its case is that very subtle portions of it pass on to another place very quickly; a large mass of light remains at the point of the wick; that portion which goes upward is called the ‘flame’; that which passes even beyond that consists of mere light (diffused); that which passes still further is too subtle to be perceived.”—(2753-2755)

*Question*:—Why do not they all move along at one and the same time? *Answer*:—[*see verse 2756 next*]
