> “For instance, one who has knowledge of the six ‘objects of cognition’, through the six ‘means of cognition’, would be ‘knowing all’ in an epitomised form; who is there who would not admit such an omniscient person?”—(3135)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be urged that—‘If a man, through the six Means of Cognition—Perception, Inference, Analogy, Word, Presumption and Non-apprehension—cognises the six kinds of objects, he would be regarded as *omniscient*’;—but this also would be futile, proving what is already admitted. Because—(*a*) Perception being restricted in its scope to the five objects, in the shape of Colour, etc. cannot apply to *Dharma and Adharma*; (6) Inference also, envisaging the *subject* as related to the *Probans* which has been cognised by Perception, cannot appertain to *Dharma and Adharma*; because *Dharma*, etc.—are beyond the reach of the senses; hence no relationship of these with anything can be apprehended by Perception;—(c) as regards the Word, even though it appertains wholly to imperceptible things, yet through verbal cognition one cannot be regarded as ‘perceiving supersensuous things’; because verbal cognition, envisaging imperceptible things, cannot be of the nature of *Perception*; and the man who is wholly addicted to non-perceptional cognition can never be one ‘perceiving supersensuous things’;—(*d*) as regards Analogy, envisaging Similarity and its adjuncts, can never apply to *Dharma and Adharma*; as has been thus declared—‘Hence what is remembered would be qualified by *similarity*,—and this would be the object of Analogical Cognition; or the similarity as resting in that thing’ (*Ślokavārtika*—Analogy, 37);—(e) as regards Presumption, it envisages only a thing different from the one in question, which, as heard of or seen, would be inexplicable without that other thing; hence, it cannot appertain to *Dharma and Adharma*; as there is nothing either seen or hoard of, which cannot be explained without the presumption of *Dharma and Adharma*, Even if Presumption does envisage *Dharma and Adharma*—it cannot be of the nature of *Perception*; hence one who rests upon it cannot be said to be ‘directly *perceiving* Dharma and Adharma’;—(*f*) as regards *Non-apprehension*, as it envisages only the *absence of cognisable things*, it can never envisage *Dharma and Adharma*.—(3135)
