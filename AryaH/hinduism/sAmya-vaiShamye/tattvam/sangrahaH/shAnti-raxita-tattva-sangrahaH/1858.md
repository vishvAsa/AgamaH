> Dispute always arises from misconception,—and such misconception is rendered impossible by the certainty of conviction; hence when the various parties would have ascertained the truth (regarding the self-validity of cognitions), they would never quarrel among themselves.—(2946)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“There may be difference of opinion; but why should not this difference be there, if the validity of cognitions is self-sufficient?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2946 above*]

What is meant by this is that Dispute is always the effect of Misconception, which is always contrary to firm Conviction,—so that when there is Dispute, on any point, it follows that there is no firm Conviction; consequently, the Proposition that “the validity of Cognitions is self-sufficient” is contrary to Inference.—(2946)
