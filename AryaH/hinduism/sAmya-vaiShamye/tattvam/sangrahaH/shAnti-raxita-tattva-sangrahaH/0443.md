> If it be said that—“the existence of the six categories is held to be the property subsisting in what is an object made known by a means of right cognition”,—then, in that case, this would have to be distinct from the six that you postulate.—(573)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following text, the Author anticipates the answer of the Opponent:—[*see verse 573 above*]

“What is meant is that the ‘existence’ of the Six Categories is a distinct property consisting in their being cognisable of such Means of Right Cognition as apprehend existing things:—so that there is no discrepancy in our Premiss”;—this is the sense of the Opponent’s answer.

The answer to this is—‘*In that case*, *etc., etc*.’;—‘*Distinct*’—i.e. a distinct *Category*; i.e. it becomes a *seventh* ‘Category’; and this would militate against the doctrine of the ‘Six Categories’.—(573)
