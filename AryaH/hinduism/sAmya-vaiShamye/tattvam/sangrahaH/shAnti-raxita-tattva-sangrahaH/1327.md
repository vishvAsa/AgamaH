## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been assorted (under *Text* 2014) that—“the *illuminativeness* of Cognition consists in its being of the nature of Apprehension”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2021 above*]

If Cognition, being unconscious, does not apprehend itself,—then the Cognition itself being imperceptible, the apprehension of the Object also would have to be regarded as *imperceptible*.—(2021)
