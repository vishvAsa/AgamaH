> “The author of the Bhāṣya has expounded the answer to the above,—on the basis of the idea that the embellishment pertains to the auditory organ. The diversity in the hearing by different persons is also due to the diversity of the organ.”—(2169)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*The Author of the Bhāṣya*’.—This is what has been said by him (in *Śabara-Bhāṣya* on 1. 1. 13)—‘For one who holds that the Conjunctions and Disjunctions *manifest* (not produce) the Word, the said incongruity (of the Word uttered in *Srughna* being heard in *Pāṭaliputra*) does not arise, because the Conjunctions and Disjunctions operating in one place do not affect the Ear-drum at a distance; so that the Auditory Organ at a distance does not catch the Word-Sound that, is manifested’—(*Translation*, pp. 34-35).

‘*Due to the diversity*’—in the Ear-drum,

‘*Diversity in hearing*’—diversity in the cognition (of Sound).—(2169)
