> The first argument (propounded by the naiyāyika) is open to the fallacy of being ‘unproven, inadmissible’; because the existence of any such ‘arrangement’ as ‘conjunction’ is not proven, nor that of the ‘composite—(56)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

\(B\) *Refutation of the Doctrine of ‘God’ (Theism)*.

The text now proceeds to supply the answer to the above arguments—[*see verse 56 above*]

In the arguments set forth (under Text 47) in the form ‘What is insentient cannot produce its effect without a controller’,—the *Probans* (‘because it is characterised by a peculiar arrangement of component parts’) is one which, without any valid objection, could be cited as proving the contrary of the Probandum (for proving which it has been put forward); and thus its presence in the contrary of the Probandum being suspected, it becomes ‘inconclusive’;—this is what the Text means.

Then again, the Probans that has been put forward in the first argument—‘Because it is characterised by a peculiar arrangement of its component parts’,—is ‘unproven’ and Inadmissible also. How this is so is explained in the next sentence—*Because*, *etc*.;—what is meant by the expression ‘arrangement of component parts’ is a particular kind of *Conjunction*; and the character of being characterised by this Conjunction is attributed to the substance called ‘Composite’; now both these,—the said *Conjunction* and also the Composite that it characterises,—are yet ‘unproven’, ‘unknown’ (to at least one of party to the Discussion, the *Buddhist*, who denies:both); hence the Probans cited is doubly ‘unproven Inadmissible—(56)

*Question*—“In what way are the two *unproven*?”

The *Answer* is supplied by the following Text:—[*see verse 57 next*]
