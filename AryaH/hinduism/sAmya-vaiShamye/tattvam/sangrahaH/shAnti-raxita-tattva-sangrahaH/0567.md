> If the particular object be not permanent, it might acquire additional characters; but even so, the defective nature of the ‘universal’ would never cease.—(761)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It may be that the Particular Object, being impermanent, will acquire additional qualities later on; but the ‘Universal’, being permanent, will always retain its character of being averse to Inherence; hence how could it be ‘inherent’ even at a later stage?—Nor can it be right to assert that—“the ‘Universal’ remains for ever in a state which is not averse to subsequent Inherence”;—because in that case, the Particular Object also would have to be regarded as eternal; as the ‘Universal’ related to it would be eternal; because in the absence of one relative, the other relative cannot be said to be devoid of the defect preventing its related nature.—(761)
