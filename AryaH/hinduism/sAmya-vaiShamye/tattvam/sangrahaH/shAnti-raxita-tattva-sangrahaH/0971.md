> “The character of the valid probans is round in what is ‘impossible otherwise’,—and not when this condition is not fulfilled, even when the ‘three features’ are present. hence the ‘three-featured’ probans are impotent (infruc-tuous).”—(1364)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the Author sets forth the objection urged by *Pātrasvāmin*:—[*see verses 1364 above*]

*Pātrasvāmin* argues as follows:—“The Probans is valid only when it is found to be ‘otherwise impossible’; and not when it has the ‘three features Because it is found that even when the Probans has the said three features, it is not valid, when it does not fulfil the condition that it is ‘otherwise impossible’; e.g. in the case where the Probans is cited in the form ‘Because hé is the Son of so and so’ [therefore he must be dark] Consequently the ‘three-featured’ Probans are infructuous, inefficient”.

In the term ‘*otherwise impossible*’, the term ‘otherwise’ stands for ‘without the Probandum’; that is to say, the valid Probans is that which exists in the Probandum only.—(1364)
