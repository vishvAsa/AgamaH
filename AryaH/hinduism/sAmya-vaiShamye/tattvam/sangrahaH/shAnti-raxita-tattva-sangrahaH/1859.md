> If there were a firm conviction regarding the self-validity of all cognitions,—then, by virtue of this same conviction, no one could hold a different opinion.—when a man accepts the invalid as valid, he becomes deceived. when, however, there is conviction regarding self-validity, no one can be opposed to it.—(2947-2948)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* point out the perception of another fact which is contrary to firm Conviction:—[*see verse 2947-2948 above*]

*Disagreement* or diversity of opinion is always found to be the effect of a Misconception, which is always contrary to well-ascertained Conviction; therefore such diversity of opinion should not be there, in face of the opinion that all cognitions are inherently valid; because such a Conviction should have removed the misconception that could lead to the said diversity of opinion.

‘*Opposed to it*’—i.e. holding a different opinion.—(2947-2948)
