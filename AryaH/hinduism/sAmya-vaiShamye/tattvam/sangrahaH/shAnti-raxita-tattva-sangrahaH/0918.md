> “A thing is called ‘universal’ when it is apprehended without distinction; hence it is not right to regard the universal as something distinguished from the particular.”—(1276)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The said *Sumati* himself, anticipating the objection that his own Reason becomes ‘Inconclusive’ by the case of the Universal, has answered it. This answer is shown in the following—[*see verse 1276 above*]

There is no ‘Universal’ apart from the *Particulars*, by virtue of which on being apprehended it would be amenable to Conceptual Perception; in fact, it is only when the Particulars are apprehended without distinction that they are called ‘Universal’; that is to say, when they are not cognised, each in its own distinctive form, they are called ‘Universal Consequently, how could the Universal be ‘distinguished’ from the Particulars, by virtue of which its apprehension would become ‘conceptual’,—(1276)

*Question*:—How then can there be a clear division between the Universal and the Particular?

*Answer* (provided by *Sumati*):—[*see verse 1277 next*]
