> Being beyond the ‘metempsychic cycle’ consisting of the ‘five states’, the Buddhas are not held by us to be ‘mortal’, what has been regarded as their ‘birth’ is only the creation of themselves by themselves—(3550)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The answer to this is that the ‘mortality’ of the Lord has not been proved.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3550 above*]

‘Hell’, ‘Regions of the Dead’, ‘Regions of Beasts’, ‘Region of Celestials’ and ‘the Human Regions’—are the ‘five states’ that make up the ‘Metempsychic Cycle’;—the Blessed Lords all lie beyond this five-fold Cycle; so that their ‘mortality’ cannot be admitted.

*Question*:—“How is it then they are heard of as having been born in the family of *Śuddhodana* and others?”

*Answer:—‘What has been regarded*, *etc. etc*.’—(3550)

The following *Text* supports this same idea by scriptures:—[*see verse 3551 next*]
