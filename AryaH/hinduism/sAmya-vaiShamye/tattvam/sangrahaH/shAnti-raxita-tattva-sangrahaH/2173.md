> In fact, the eternality of all such things as quality, action, god, as also of the Vedas, has been totally rejected. Consequently we do not admit of any eternal ‘scripture’.—(3557)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 3210, that—“the three Deities, Brahmā and the rest, are mentioned in the eternal scripture of the Veda; and the eternality of these does not militate against the eternality of the Vedas”. The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3557 above*]

By establishing the ‘Perpetual Flux’ as affecting all things, it has been proved that nothing can be *eternal*. Hence all this (about *eternality*) is wholly irrelevant.—(3557)
