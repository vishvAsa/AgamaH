> “Even when *na-na* would be uttered, there would be negation of negation only; so that the *pacati* (action of cooking) would remain there in its own (positive) form.—similarly in the case of verbs there is the idea of being in course of accomplishment, as also that of the past, etc.; and as Apoha is something well-established, these ideas would be baseless (if Apoha were all that is denoted by words).”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 140-141]—(975-976)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—‘There may be nothing to be negatived actually figuring in the *exclusion*, even so, there may be a probable counter-entity (*na-pacati*) of which there could be negation in the form *na-na-pacati*.’ [So that the denotation of the verb *pacati* would be *na-na-pacati*]:

This is answered in the following—[*see verses 975-976 above*]

Even when the expression ‘*na-na-pacati*’ is uttered, what is expressed is only the negation of a probable negation.

‘What is the harm in that?’

*Answer*:—*So that the* ‘*pacati etc. etc*.; that is to say, two negatives always denote an *affirmation*; so that on the use of the said expression, the action of ‘*pacati*’ remains there in its *positive* form; hence the denotation of the word would be *positive* (*not negative*, in the shape of *Apoha*).

Then again, the verb ‘*pacati*’ signifies an *act in the course of being accomplished*; and that action is regarded as *in the course of being accomplished* of which some portions have been accomplished while some are still unaccomplished, and of which therefore the portions happen to be in a certain order of sequence.—Similarly in the case of such verbs as ‘*abhūt*’ (Past Tense) and ‘*bhaviṣyati*’ (Future Tense), there are ideas of *past* and *future* points of time.

—In regard to the *Apoha* however, no such ideas of *being in course of accomplishment*, etc. is possible; because it is a fully accomplished thing consisting entirely of Negation. Consequently, under the view that *Apoha* is denoted by words, the idea of *being in course of accomplishment* and also the idea of ‘past’, ‘future’ and the like can have no basis at all; hence it is contrary to experience.

‘*Bhūtādirūpaṇam*’,—the conception, idea, of the Past, etc.—(975-976)
