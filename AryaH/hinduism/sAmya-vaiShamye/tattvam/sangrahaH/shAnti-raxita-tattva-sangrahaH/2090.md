> Why should not then there be recognition of the form and of the effects of fire in water also?—The only other alternative is that the nature of the two things being distinct, the difference among things must be real.—(3380)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the view is that Fire is really present in Water,—then why is there no recognition of the form of the Fire in Water,—or the recognition of its effects, in the shape of Burning, Cooking and the like?

If it is said that some sort of difference is also accepted,—then the answer is that ‘*the only other, etc. etc*.’—This has been discussed in detail, under the chapter on *Syādvāda*. So it may be allowed to rest here.—(3380)
