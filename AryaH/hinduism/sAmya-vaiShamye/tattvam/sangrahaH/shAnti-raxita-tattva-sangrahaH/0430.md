> “As a matter of fact, the rock-crystal is actually perceived when in contact with another thing, even though its quality is not perceived;—similarly the line of cranes and such things are also seen;—when the man is covered by a long cloak, even though his complexion, etc. are not perceived, there is perception of him as a ‘man’;—in the case of the red cloth, there is perception of it as ‘cloth’.”—(557-558)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following Texts, the Author sets forth the arguments put forward by *Uddyotakara*, *Bhāvivikta* and others,—to show that the Reason that ‘the Composite Substance is never perceived as distinct from its Qualities; and Components’, adduced in the above argument, is ‘not admitted’, ‘unproven’:—[*see verses 557-558 above*]

The said writers argue as follows:—“The Substance is really apprehended as apart from its Qualities; in fact, even when its Colour and other Qualities are not perceived, the Substance itself is perceived. For instance, (a) when the Rock-crystal is placed near another thing, even though the colour of the white Rock-crystal itself is not perceived, the Crystal itself is perceived.—(b) Similarly things like the Line of Cranes flying in the sky at night when the light is dim, are actually perceived, even though their white colour is not perceived.—(c) Similarly when a man is covered by a long cloak reaching to his feet, even though his dark complexion and other details are not seen, the perception that it is a ‘man’ is there all right.—(d) In the case of pieces of cloth coloured with saffron, etc., even though the natural colour of the cloth itself is suppressed, yet the Cognition of the ‘Cloth’ itself is there.”—(557-558)
