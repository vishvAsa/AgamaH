> “This destruction of the thing is not present at the time that the thing is in existence; nor is it present before (the thing has come into existence); nor very long after (the thing has come into existence), in fact, it comes immediately after (the thing has come into existence); thus, inasmuch as it comes into existence only at a particular time, it must have a cause. If it were independent (of all causes), then this occasional character would be impossible, as shown before—(367-368)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That is to say, the Destruction of a thing cannot be present at the time that the thing is in existence, as if it did, then the momentarily existent thing could never exist. Nor can it be present before the thing has been produced, as what has not been born cannot be destroyed; e.g. the ‘son of the Barren Woman’ and such non-entities are not destroyed while unborn.—Even when coming *after* the thing has come into existence, it cannot come *very long* after it; because all things (*ex hypothesi*) being destroyed at the third moment (of existence), there cannot be another destruction very long afterwards, as is found in the case of Eire that has become reduced to ashes. The destruction of the thing, therefore, must come immediately after it has come into existence, i.e, at the second moment. Thus it is established that, as it has the time of its coming definitely fixed, the Destruction must have a Cause, just as the sprout has—‘*as it has the time, etc*. *etc*.’; i.e. because it appears only occasionally. The invariable concomitance of this reason is next shown—‘*If it were independent etc. etc*.’;—if it were independent of all Cause, then its *occasional character* could not be possible; as in that case its existence would be there at all times. Hence, from its *occasional character*, it is deduced that it must have a Cause.—(367-368)

Another reason for the same conclusion is set forth in the following—[*see verses 369 next*]
