## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the Author proceeds to point out ‘self-contradiction’ on the part of the *Mīmāṃsaka*, by showing that his view involves the incongruity of a character concomitant with the contrary:—[*see verse 2939 above*]

Doubt and Misconception are contrary to Certainty; and when the thing has become subject to the former two,—and is concomitant with it—then there is no room for Certainty regarding it.—(2939)
