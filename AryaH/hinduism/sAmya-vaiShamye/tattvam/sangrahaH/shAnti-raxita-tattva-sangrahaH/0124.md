> If the world be regarded as ‘consisting of sound’ in the form of ‘product’ (not eternal),—even so, as sound would be unmodifiable, there could be no sequential appearance.—(140)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even so, as Sound is eternal (*ex hypothesi*), and hence *unmodifiable*,—it is not possible for the Products to appear sequentially; in fact, all things should appear simultaneously, as being the effects of equally perfect cause of unobstructed potency. In fact, the appearance of effects is delayed only when there is some imperfection in the Cause; if the Cause is perfect, therefore, for what would the effect wait, and hence not appear simultaneously?—(140)
