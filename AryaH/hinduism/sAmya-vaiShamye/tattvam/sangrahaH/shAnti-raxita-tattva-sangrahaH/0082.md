> By the refutation of god’s creatorship, his omniscience also is understood to be set aside by the same; as it is on the strength of ‘creatorship’ that the argument for ‘omniscience’ has been based.—(91)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (in Text 54) that “the fact of His being the creator of all things having been established, His omniscience is proved without effort—The answer to this is provided by the following Text:—[*see verse 91 above*]
