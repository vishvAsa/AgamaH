> “The eternality of the Veda consists in the fact that it is not produced in the beginning and does not perish in the end.—If it be urged that ‘even so, this eternality is something cognisable’,—then [the answer is that] eternality is what is meant by the two characters of ‘being not produced’ and ‘being not destroyed’; and both these being of the nature of negation do not require any proof for themselves.”—(2104-2105)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The other party urges—If the ‘negation of the two ends’ constitutes *Eternality*, then it comes to this that *Eternality* is not a positive quality of things.

The answer to this (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*) is as follows:—[*see verses 2104-2105 above*]

What is meant by this is that *eternality* forms part of the very nature of the *Veda*, which is an entity.

‘*If it be urged*, *etc. etc*.’—This anticipates the following objection from the Opponent—If it is as stated, then *Eternality* is an entity and as such it is something that has to be cognised by a Means of Cognition, to be proved.

The answer to this is—‘*What is meant, etc. etc*.’

‘*Both these*’—i.e. the characters of *not being produced* and *not being destroyed*.

‘*Proof for themselves*’—i.e. any means of cognising their own forms. What is meant is that there need be nothing incongruous in Negation being an *entity*; so that even though *Eternality* consists in the two characters of ‘not being produced’ and ‘not being destroyed’, it need not be a nonentity.—(2104-2105)
