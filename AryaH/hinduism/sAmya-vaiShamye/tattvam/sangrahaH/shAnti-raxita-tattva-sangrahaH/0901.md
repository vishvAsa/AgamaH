> If it be held that “cognitions appear in succession (never simultaneously), and the idea of simultaneous appearance is due to the quickness of the succession; as in the case of the whirling fire-brand”—[then the answer is as stated in the following text].—(1247)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Opponent might urge that the fact of the ‘determining factor’ appearing along with the Cognition cannot be accepted. This is the argument put forward in the following—[*see verse 1247 above*]

The question being raised as to why the Cognitions are perceived as appearing simultaneously, if, in reality, they appear in succession,—the answer given is that ‘*the idea of simultaneous*, *etc. etc*.’; as in the case of the *whirling fire-brand*. That is, in the case of the whirling fire-brand, it is found that when the whirling is done very quickly, the idea produced is that of a single flaming circle; all the several perceptions being mixed up as *one*; in the same manner, cognitions appearing very quickly one after the other, there is the idea of their appearing together as *one*.

Or, the term ‘*alāta*’ may be taken as standing for the perceptions of the fire-brand,—the *cognition* being spoken of figuratively as the *object*; the sense of the affix ‘*vati*’ remains the same as before, in this interpretation also.—(1247)

The above argument of the Opponent is answered in the following—[*see verse 1248 next*]
