> Such, qualities as wisdom, gentleness, compassion and the like,—which are not habitually practised in the world,—do not proceed by themselves, like pride, etc.—(1959)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It must be admitted that the feelings of Love, etc. appear by themselves, as the effect of habitual experience in the past;—because such qualities as wisdom, gentleness and the rest,—which are not habitually practised in the world,—are *not* found to appear by themselves like *Pride*, *etc*.;—this is an instance of dissimilarity. ‘Pride’ is *haughtiness*.—Otherwise, like Pride, etc., Wisdom and the rest also would appear by themselves.—(1959)
