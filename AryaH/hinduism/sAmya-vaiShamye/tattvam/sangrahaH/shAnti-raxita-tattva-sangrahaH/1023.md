> Some short-sighted people have asserted that “inference is not a means of right cognition”, though, by these very words, they offer up their own ‘desire to speak’ (intention, idea in the mind, as something to be inferred from those words).—(1456)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Some people*’—the followers of *Bṛhaspati* and others.

‘*Through these same words*’,—i.e. by the words ‘Inference is not a means of Right Cognition’.

This shows that the assertion of these people involves self-contradiction. For instance, when a man makes a statement to another person, it is on the basis of the understanding that ‘the idea present in one’s mind is understood from the words he uses, which are *indicative* of that idea’; so that when the people denying Inference make the statement,—by this statement itself—they admit the fact of Inference being a Means of Right Cognition;—and yet this same he denies by the statement that ‘Inference is *not a* Means of Right Cognition’;—and this is self-contradiction.

This objection is going to be further explained later on.—(1456)
