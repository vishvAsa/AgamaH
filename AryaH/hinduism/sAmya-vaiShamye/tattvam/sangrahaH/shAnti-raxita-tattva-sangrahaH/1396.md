> “The distinction in the letter itself into short, etc. would be contrary to the doctrine of eternality (of words); for, how can the letter, which is ever present, be said to be measured by duration? Consequently, it is the articulation of the letter that should be regarded as measured by duration, for one or two moments; the letter itself cannot be measured by duration.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa*, 50-51 ].—(2154-2155)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—How do you know that the idea of Larger and Smaller intensity that appears in connection with Sound is due to extraneous circumstances, and the Sound itself has no such diversity?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verses 2154-2155 above*]

‘*Short, long*, *etc*.’, The ‘*etcetera*’ includes the *Long*, the *ultra-long*, the High Pitch, the Low Pitch, the Middling Pitch, and the ‘*Ṣaḍja*’ and other musical notes.

‘*Would be contrary*, *etc. etc*.’—That is, because the *Eternality* of the Letter has been established by *Recognition*.—(2154-2155)

In the following text, the Opposite view is put forward—that the said ‘manifestation’ cannot be admitted—[*see verses 2156-2157 next*]
