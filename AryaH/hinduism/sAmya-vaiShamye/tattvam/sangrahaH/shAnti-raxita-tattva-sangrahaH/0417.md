> Ignorance and the rest, in the form of ‘cause and effect’, are held to constitute ‘bondage’, and the cessation of these, as consisting in the purity of the mind, is held to constitute ‘liberation’.—(544)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 496) that “what is bound up with the chains of Attachment, etc. is *one* Moment, etc. etc.; and hence there can be no idea of Bondage and Liberation under the theory of ‘Perpetual Flux’”,—The answer to this is provided in the following:—[*see verse 544 above*]

For us no ‘Bondage’ and ‘Liberation’ have been admitted as belonging to any one entity; as no one is held to be either ‘bound’ or ‘liberated’; all that is admitted by us is that ‘Impressions’ in the form of *Ignorance* and the rest ending with decay and death are spoken of as ‘Bondage’ on the ground of their being the cause of pain. This has been thus declared:—‘All this is merely an aggregate of the Thought-phase that causes pain’,—When the said Ignorance and the rest cease, by virtue of True Knowledge, there comes about *purity of the Mind*; and it is this purity that is spoken of as ‘Liberation’; as thus declared—‘When the Mind is beset with the troubles of Attachment and the rest, it constitutes the *Cycle of Birth and Death*, and when the same is freed from them, it is called the *End of Birth*—(544)
