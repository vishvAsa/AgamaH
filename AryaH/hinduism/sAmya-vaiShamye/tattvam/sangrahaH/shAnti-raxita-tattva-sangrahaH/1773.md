## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Inner darkness*’—Ignorance, ‘Painful and Unpainful’;—who has dispelled this by the light of knowledge.

‘*Clear*’—correct; pure, free from impurities like animal-slaughter, wrongful sexual acts and so forth.

‘*Seek for a teacher*’;—i.e. it is only then that your idea of the Veda having no personal author would be of any use; otherwise the meaning being not cognisable, the said idea would be futile.

What is meant by this is as follows:—

The notion of yours, that the Veda is self-sufficient in its authority, cannot be right unless there is an omniscient Person;—hence such a Person has got to be admitted;—otherwise the authority and reliability of the Veda would be impossible; as explained above. Under the circumstances, it is far better to rely upon the word of this Person himself, for the knowledge of *Dharma* and such matters; what is the use of assuming the Word not proceeding from a Person,—the reliability of which Word must always remain doubtful?

It has been argued that matters like *Dharma* are not amenable to the direct meditative Perception of the Mystics.—This assertion also is defective; because it is going to be proved later on, by means of Inference, that there can be such perception in the case of Mystics.—(2810)
