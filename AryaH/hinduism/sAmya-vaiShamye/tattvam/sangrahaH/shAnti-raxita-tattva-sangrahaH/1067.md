## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows the real form of Analogical Cognition (according to *Śabara*)—[*see verse 1534 above*]

‘The Cow is similar to this animal that is now seen by me’,—this cognition appears in regard, to the *Cow* which is not before the observer (not within reach of his senses);—and this cognition is what is called ‘Analogical Cognition’, which thus is a Means or Form of Cognition.

The following *Text* shows the object that is apprehended by the said *Analogical Cognition*:—[*see verse 1535 next*]
