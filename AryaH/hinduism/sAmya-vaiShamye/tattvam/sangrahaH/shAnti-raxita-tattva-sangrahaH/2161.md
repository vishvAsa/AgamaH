## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 3532*]:

It has been further argued, under the same *Text* 3200, that—“the ‘untrammelled knowledge’ spoken of may be taken as referring to certain particular things only, not to all things”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3532 above*]

*Question*:—“How have the Buddhists won their case?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3533 above*]

[*verse 3533*]:

It has been proved before that the Lord’s knowledge of the Highest Good is ‘untrammelled’. Hence it must, be known to all men, down to the veriest piper, that He possesses the knowledge of *Dharma* and allied matters; so that, by his own words, the opponent admits the “Omniscience’ of the Lord, (after admitting His knowledge of *Dharma* and such matters).—(3533)
