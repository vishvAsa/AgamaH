## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows how the capacity of the Ear, etc. is improved by exercise:—[*see verse 3405 above*]

The words—‘*People are enabled*, *etc*.’—point out the improvement caused by medication.

‘*Unguents*, *etc*. *with magical powers*’ is construed with ‘*is seen*’ of the previous sentence;—the Instrumental Ending connoting *cause or instrumentality*.—(3405)
