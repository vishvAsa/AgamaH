> For these reasons, we are not denying the fact of the soul being spoken of by the term ‘eternal’; but on account of its form being subject to modification, there mest be destrection of it.—(273)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The revered *Diṅnāga* having declared that—‘if the fact of the Soul being modified on the appearance of Cognition meant the non-eternity of that Soul, then, there can be no *0ogniser* in the shape of the *Soul* not modified’;—in answer to this declaration, *Kumārila* has argued as follows:—“We are not denying the fact of the Soul being expressed (spoken of) by the term ‘non-eternal’; but if the term meant mere modification, then that alone would not imply the *destruction* of the Soul.”—(*Ślokavārtika*, *Ātmavāda*, 22).

Against this the Author states the following objection, which also serves to sum up his own conclusion:—[*see verse 273 above*]

For these reasons, we are not denying the fact of the Soul being spoken of as ‘eternal’,—on the ground that *Sentience*, which is in a State of perpetual flux, continues undestroyed, along with its Cause, as long as the world lasts. But its *form*,—nature—being *subject to modification*, as there is always the abandoning of the preceding and the appearance of the succeeding form,—its liability to destruction is clearly indicated.—(273)
