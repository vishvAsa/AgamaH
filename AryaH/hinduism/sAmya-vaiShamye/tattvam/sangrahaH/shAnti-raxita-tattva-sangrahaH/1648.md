> If it be said that—“the organ and the letter-sound are embellished again, and are pit for the purpose of the cognition of that sound by other persons”,—then also there would be continuation of the same organ and sound, and hence of the hearing also of the same sound and by the same person.—(2575)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“For the benefit of those other persons who would be going to hear the same sound, there would be another embellishment of the Auditory Organ and the Letter-Sound”.

The following *Text* anticipates and answers this argument:—[see *verse 2575 above*]:

The compound ‘*tadvarṇa*, *etc*.’ is to be expounded as—fit for the *vijñāna*—cognition—of those Sounds by those persons;—“which Letter-Sounds?”—those that are heard by the other hearers;—and the ‘persons’ are the ‘hearers of those sounds’.

‘*Tayoreva*’—i.e. the Organ and Letter-Sound embellished previously.

‘*Tayorapi*’—of the previous Person and Letter-Sound.

What is meant is that, when the Letters—*ka* and the rest—are heard later on by other persons, they should be heard exactly as they had been heard by the previous persons;—because their previous character would still continue.—(2575)
