> The notion of ‘going’ is an illusion,—as in the lamp-flame,—due to the appearance of different but similar things being found consecutively in diverse places.—(707)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“If this is so, then how is it that people speak of *Going*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 707 above*]

‘*Different but similar things*’;—‘different’ and ‘similar’ are compounded first,—then that compound is compounded with ‘tilings—Of these different and similar things,—there is *appearance* (birth)—which is *consecutive*,—i.e. in a place other than that of its own Cause,—when such *appearance* is seen, there arises, from it, the notion that it is ‘going’;—just as in the case of the *Lamp-flame*, when it is being carried by someone, there appears the notion that ‘the Lamp-flame is moving’; while certainly the same Lamp-flame does not move from one place to another; because it has been held (even by the *Vaiśeṣika*) to last for *six moments* only. Further, what is called the ‘birth’ (appearance) of a thing consists in mere *Being*, entirely devoid of any preceding or succeeding end; and the apprehension of such ‘birth’ or ‘appearance’ is only natural.

Or ‘*janmanaḥ*’ may be construed as *Ablative*;—the sense being—‘*because* things are born consecutively, therefore different and similar things are perceived in different places’.—(707)

*End of Chapter on* ‘*Action*’.
