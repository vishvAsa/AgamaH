## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 3349*]:

It has been argued by the other party, under *Text* 3150, that—“In regard to one matter, of Arithmetic for instance, all beings are found to be truthful and no distinction is found among them, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3349 above*]

It has been argued by the other party, under *Texts* 3151 *et seq*., that—“The Reason that the Buddhist adduces in support of the Omniscience of one Person will be available in the case of other Persons also, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3350 above*]

[*verse 3350*]:

‘*Tat*’—Therefore; thus.

‘*The essence of that Reason*’;—though the mere verbal expression of the Reason may be applicable,—in the form ‘Because they are Teachers of the *Syādvāda* and other doctrines which are true and all-pervading [therefore *Jina* and others should be regarded as *Omniscient*]’;—yet the essential factor of that Reason which is concomitant with the reality of things, is absent in such reasonings,—which therefore cannot be available for the case of *Kapila* and others. It is only when one real thing is concomitant with another real thing,—and not merely a verbal expression—that brings about the right apprehension of things.—(3350)
