> “Thus then, when the Buddhists, like pseudo-Mīmāṃsakas, assert the similarity of Buddha and other persons to Vedic scholars, on the ground of all these being without beginning,—this is only a form of ignorance, and does not make them equal; because even so, what would be without beginning would be only the unreliability and reliability of these two sets of persons (Buddha, etc. and Vedic scholars) respectively.”—(3181-3182)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the *similarity* that is pointed out between *Buddha* and others on the one hand and the Vedic Scholars on the other, is in regard to both being *beginningless*,—then our answer is that mere *beginninglessness* does not establish their *reliability*; because neither, *reliability* nor *unreliability* is incompatible with *beginninglessness*; all that would happen would be that *beginninglessness* would belong to the Reliability of Vedic Scholars, while it would belong to the Unreliability of Buddha and others; and neither Reliability nor Unreliability would belong to both, on the ground of *beginninglessness*.—This is the upshot of the whole argument.—(3181-3182)

This same idea is further clarified by means of an example:—[*see verses 3181-3182 above*]
