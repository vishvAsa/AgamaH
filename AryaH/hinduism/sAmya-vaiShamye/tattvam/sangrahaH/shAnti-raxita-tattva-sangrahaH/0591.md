> When the contact of its substratum with the sense-organ and such other conditions would be present and bring about the cognition of the universal,—that universal would become perceived everywhere; because there can be no division in its form.—(808)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* sets forth the objection against the second alternative view (mentioned in *Text* 805, that the Universals ‘Jar’ and the like are all-pervading, subsisting in all things):—[*see verse 808 above*]

‘*The contact, etc*. *etc*.’—i.e. the causes of Perception.

‘*Such other conditions*’;—this is meant to include the contact of the Mind and Soul and so forth.

What is meant is that the Universal being perceived in one particular individual, it should be perceived in other and heterogeneous individuals also, as also in the interval between two individuals; because it is of one uniform character which cannot differ from the one that is actually perceived.—(808)

This same argument is further elucidated in the following *Text*—[*see verse 809 next*]
