> The fact of the notions in question being different from the notions of the body, shape, etc. is not admitted (or proved); hence the reason put forward is also open to the charge of being ‘un-proven’,—(738)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As a matter of fact, the notions of the *Cow* and such things do not have for their objective anything other than the Body, etc. (of the animals); by virtue of which they could be held to be distinct from these latter.—(738)

The Conclusion also (of the Opponent’s Argument) is annulled by Inference:—[*see verse 739 next*]
