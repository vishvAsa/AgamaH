> If it is the illusory relation of denoter and denoted that is denied; on the basis of the real fact of the two exclusions being non-entities,—even so, ‘falsity’ becomes unavoidable; in view of such words and things denoted by them as are the creation of imagination.—(1091-1092)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged by the other party:—“We are not denying the *real* relation of *Denoted and Denoter*; what we are denying is the *illusory* relation of *Denoted and Denoter* which is based upon the *real* fact of the two *Apohas* being non-entities; so that our Reason is not *not*-*admitted*; nor is our conclusion open to the defect of being superfluous”.

The following *Texts* proceed to show that, if both are regarded to be illusory and real, then the two objections do become applicable:—[*see verses 1091-1092 above*]

Under the circumstances, the Reason would be Inconclusive; as in the ease of such creatures of imagination as *Mahāśvetā* and the like, and also words denoting these,—even though they are non-entities *in reality*, yet the *illusory* Relation of Denoter and Denoted is actually present.—(1091-1092)
