> Time, as something one, all-pervading and eternal, has already been rejected; nor is it manifested in all things, like the letters, by anything; and if it is manifested in the letters, it cannot form a factor in the expression of the meaning of words;—as it is not different from other things,—and as it does not exist elsewhere, it cannot be eternal.—Thus then, the order of the letters,—as also their shortness, length, etc.—are all adjuncts of the articulation, and are not so many phases of time.—Thus for you, there is no property in words which is eternal; hence it becomes established that the word is not-eternal,—for those who regard the letter as non-eternal.—Nor could it form part of the property of anything else,—like tee fleetness of the horse,—if it were assumed that the manifesting cognitions bring about the manifestation of the words.—(2694-2698)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Already*’—under the chapter on the ‘Six Categories’.

‘*It is not manifested by anything*’—simply because it does not exist;—even if it existed, the manifestation of the eternal thing would also be eternal.

‘*Not different from other things*’—i.e. it is non-different from other things. Because the nature of the Time that is manifested in the phenomenon consisting of the seed-sprout-creeper does not in any way differ from that which is manifested in the Letters.\*\*\*\*\* (Lacune in Text).

‘*Not phases of time*’—because there is no such thing as Time. Even if it exists, its divisibility is not admitted.

The rest is easily intelligible.—(2694-2698)
