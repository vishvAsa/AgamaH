> “While the Apoha itself has not become accomplished,—where could the concomitance be asserted (which is necessary for the proper functioning of all indicatives)? And if the concomitance is not perceived,—there would be no validity in these (word and indicative).”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 74]—(935)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“Even if there be operation of Word and Indicative,—the authority or validity attached to these (by the Apohist) becomes shaken.”

This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 935 above*]

As a matter of fact, Word and Indicative can be valid only when there is no absence of concomitance of what is to be affirmed;—in the case in question, *Apoha* is what is meant to be affirmed;—now, as it is of the form of mere Negation, and hence devoid of any (positive) character, it cannot be an accomplished entity; under the circumstances, wherein could the ‘concomitance’, or ‘absence of non-concomitance’ of the Word and Indicative be asserted *7* What would be the use of asserting the concomitance?

*Answer*:—*If the concomitance is not perceived*, *etc*. *etc*.

‘*In these*’—in Word and Indicative. Because validity consists in *absence of non-conco?nitance*.—(935)
