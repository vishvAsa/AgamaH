> The answer to the above is as follows:—as a matter of fact, there is no real basis for these expressions and notions; the only basis for them consists in the seed located in the purely subjective consciousness.—(869)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If what the Realist desires to prove is the fact that the notions and expressions in question have a real basis in the external world, then the Reason adduced is Inconclusive; as there is nothing to annul the contrary conclusion. If what is meant to be proved is only that they have some sort of basis, then the argument is futile; because we also hold that they have their basis in the awakening of the Tendencies and Impressions embedded in the inner consciousness; though not in the external object; because the first cognition being always verbal, is wrong, and it cannot have any real basis.

‘*Located, etc*.’,—i.e. embedded in consciousness; i.e. in the form of Tendencies and Impressions.—(869)

This same line of thought is further supported by reference to the scriptures:—[*see verse 870 next*]
