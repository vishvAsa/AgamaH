> The conception being there that ‘that also is capable of effective action’,—there would be this idea that ‘it is an entity’ thus there would be subjective similarity consisting in ‘differentiation from what is incapable’. Thus, even though there is absolute difference, there is a subjective similarity; and thus an ‘entity’ being ‘equal’ to other entities, becomes distinguished from the ‘sky-flower’.—(1753-1754)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Objection*:—“If there is absolute difference among entities,—how can there be such all-embracing notions as ‘this is entity’, ‘this is entity’ (in regard to all things)?—how too can there be any difference between the Entity and the ‘sky-flower’, etc.—if there were no similarity?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1753-1754 above*]

‘*Differentiation from the Incapable*’;—‘the incapables’ meant are such non-entities as ‘the son of the Barren Woman’,—there is ‘differentiation’ from these,—i.e. the entity is not the *same* as these.

Because the subjective *Similarity* is there, therefore it cannot be admitted that “If an entity were not equal to other entities, it would not differ from the sky-flower”—(as asserted by the Opponent under *Text* (1710).
