> “As the fact is capable of another explanation, the presumption (put forward) has no efficacy (in proving the existence of the omniscient person). For the same reason, the inference that has been put forward is not valid. for instance, the fact of Buddha and others having taught dharma, etc. can be explained in another way—For instance, as being due to dreams, or to delusion, or to the Veda itself, or to wrong teaching.”—(3222-3223)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Teaching by people may be due to delusion and other causes also hence both, the Presumption and the Inference cited, are *Inconclusive*.

*Question*:—How can it be otherwise explained?

*Answer*:—‘*To dreams*, *etc. etc*.’—as declared in *Śabara’s Bhāṣya* (I. 1. 2.)—‘Teaching proceeds from delusion also; and when there is no Delusion it proceeds from the Veda also’.—Teaching proceeding from *Delusion* is found in cases where things dreamt of are taught; and that proceeding from the *Veda* is found in the case of the teachings of *Manu* and others.—(3222-3223)
