> How can a sentence be cognised, which is devoid of all relationship? otherwise all things would be cognised through a single thing.—(1625)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

How can a sentence he cognised, which is devoid of relationship—such as that of *sameness* and *origination*? It can never be cognised. *Otherwise*—if a sentence devoid of all relationship were cognised,—from any single thing—in the shape of the Jar for instance,—*all* jars would become cognised. This however does not happen. Hence the cognition must be held to follow from a definite relationship (of concomitance).—(1625)

The following text further elucidates the incongruities involved:—[*see verse 1626 next*]
