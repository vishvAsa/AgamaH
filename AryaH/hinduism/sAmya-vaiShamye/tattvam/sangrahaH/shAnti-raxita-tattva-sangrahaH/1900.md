> Under the theory of ‘self-validity’, the certainty comes about from the birth of the cognition itself; hence there can be no ‘mutilation’; what then is there to be prevented?—(3035)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted by the other party, under *Text* 2887, that—“Teachers and Fellow-students help to prevent mutilations in the Eternal Word, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3035 above*]

‘*Niścayajātitaḥ*’—on account of certainty having come about.—Otherwise, if the certainty did not come about from the Cognition itself,—then the doctrine of ‘self-validity’ would be done away with.—(3035)
