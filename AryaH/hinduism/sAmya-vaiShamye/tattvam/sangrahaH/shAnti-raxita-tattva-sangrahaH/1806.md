> “It may be that there too there may be need for another sublating cognition in certain cases, where suspicion might be aroused in the mind of the person by the previous cognition; but that suspicion ceases after very little effort.”—(2867)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—Even when the sublating Cognition is there, it is possible that there may be another Cognition sublating it,—just as there is one for the initial Cognition; how then can there be a cessation of the dependence upon another sublating Cognition,—by virtue of which the sublation of that Cognition would be accepted with certainty?

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2867 above*]

‘*There*, *in some cases*’—i.e. in regard to the sublating Cognition in the form of the ‘Cognition of the thing as different from that envisaged in the previous Cognition’.

‘*Jātāśāṅkasya*’—the man whose suspicion has been aroused.

‘*Pūrveṇa*’—by the initial Cognition.

‘*Sāpi*’—i.e. the dependence upon sublation.

‘*Alpena*’—i.e. by very slight *effort*—(2867)

*Question*:—How does it cease?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2868-2871 next*]
