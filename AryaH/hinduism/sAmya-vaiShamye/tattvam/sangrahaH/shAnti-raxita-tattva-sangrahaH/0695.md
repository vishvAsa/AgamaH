> “If a qualification be regarded as such even in regard to the qualified thing which is totally different, then, everything can serve as the qualification (of everything).”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 90]—(950)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If, for you, there were an assumption of something being a qualification, even in regard to a Qualified thing, which is unlike, and not like,—in accordance with the form of,—that Qualification,—then everything,—*Blue* and the rest,—could be the Qualification of everything; and there would be no restriction at all.—(950)
