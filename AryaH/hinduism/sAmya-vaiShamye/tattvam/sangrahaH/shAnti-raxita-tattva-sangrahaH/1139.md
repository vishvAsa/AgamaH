> “The certainty regarding his being alive being obtained through the word or other means of cognition,—certainty regarding his absence in the house being obtained through negation,—due validity would belong to the presumption based upon the negation.”—(1644)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“Even though the man with ordinary powers of vision could not have any means of perceiving the fact of *Caitra* being alive, yet Inference and the other means of cognition would be always available for him”.—This is what is urged in the following—[*see verse 1644 above*]

‘*Through the Word*’—i.e. when a word uttered by him is heard, or when an ascetic engaged in austerities behind the wall says that ‘*Caitra* is alive’.

‘*Through Negation*’—as a Means of Cognition,—in the shape of the absence of Perception and the other Means of Cognition,—the certainty of Caitra’s absence in the house being obtained,—it becomes known that the absence in the house is of the *living* Ghaitra;—then due validity would belong to this Presumption as based upon Negation,—(1644)
