> This same conceptual content does not apprehend the said object; because if it did, it would abandon the expressing of the ‘past’, etc. and there would be the incongruity of its being connected with the name of that object.—(1244)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be urged that—“It is the Conceptual Content itself attracted by other things, which perceives the Blue Colour and other things”.

*Answer*;—[*see verse 1244 above*]

If that same Conceptual Content apprehended the said object (Blue Colour, etc.), then it would abandon the signifying of past and other things, and would contain within itself the name of the ‘Blue’ itself.

The ‘abandoning of the signifying of the past and other things’ has been asserted, because the Conceptual Content cannot be associated with two sets of words.

The Compound ‘*tannāma, etc*.’ is to be explained as—‘There would the incongruity of the connection of the name of the object before the perceiver’.—(1244)
