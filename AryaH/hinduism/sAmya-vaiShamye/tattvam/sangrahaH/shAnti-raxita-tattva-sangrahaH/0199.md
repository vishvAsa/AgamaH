## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“The idea that a Cognition may be devoid of a real object is not true; as has been declared by Kumārila—‘It is not admitted that even in the case of Dreams and other such Cognitions, a real external object is entirely absent; in every case there is an external background, only conceived of in connection with a wrong place and time’, [ *Ślokavārtika, Nirālambanavāda*, 107-108].”

This is the view presented in the following Text:—[*see verse 250 above*]

‘*Basis*’,—i.e. the cause of the notion of diversity among Cognitions.—The compound ‘*deśakālānyathātmakam*’ is to be analysed as—‘that of which the time and place are otherwise’,—or as ‘that of which the differentiation is done by time and place’.—(250)

The answer to this is given in the following Text:— [*see verse 251 next*]
