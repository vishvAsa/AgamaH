> When the verb ‘*pacati*’ (‘cooks’) is uttered, what is understood is that ‘he is not doing nothing,—nor is he eating or gambling’—where the ‘exclusion of other acts’ is clearly apprehended. Thus, whatever is intended (to be spoken), there is always something ‘excluded’ by the ‘relative negation’,—this something being ‘doing nothing’ and also other acts (than the one meant to be spoken of by the verb used).—(1146-1147)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* also proceed to show how the said ‘exclusion of the unintended’ is expressed by implication:—[*see verses 1146-1147 above*]

From the above it is clear that the verb ‘*pacati*’ (cooks) excludes ‘doing nothing’, and also other acts like *Eating*, *Gambling* and the like,—which thus are the ‘excluded’, through ‘Relative Negation’, Hence the assertion that “there is nothing that is denied in the form of Relative Negation” (Text 974) is not true.

In the compound ‘*Paryudāsātmakāpohyam*’,—‘*paryadāsatmakam*’ is to be taken as qualifying ‘*apohyam*’.

‘*Whatever is intended to be spoken of*’,—by that, there is something to be ‘excluded’ through Relative Negation, in the shape of ‘doing nothing’ and the rest.—(1146-1147)
