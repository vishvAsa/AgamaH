> As regards his being not cognised by all beings,—that is always doubtful; as it is possible that at some time by some means of cognition, he might become cognised by some one. Because that he is so uncognisable cannot be clearly ascertained by all living beings of all the three worlds coming together without exception.—As regards his being not cognised by the Mīmāṃsaka himself, it is clearly ‘inconclusive’, because that does not prove with certainty that there is no cognition by other persons.—(2415-2417)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, the Reason as adduced by the *Mīmāṃsaka* can have two meanings—(1) that the Author is not cognised *by any one* through the Five Means of Cognition, and (2) that he is not so cognised *by the Mīmāṃsaka himself*;—in the former sense, it is *Doubtful-hence-Inadmissible*; and in the latter, it is *Inconclusive*.—This is shown in the following:—[*see verses 2415-2417 above*]

‘*Imam*’—i.e. the fact that the Author of the Veda is not cognised *by anyone*.

‘*Tathā hi*, *etc. etc*.’—confirms the said ‘Inconclusiveness’—through the convictions of other people and also the cogitations of students.—(2415-2417)
