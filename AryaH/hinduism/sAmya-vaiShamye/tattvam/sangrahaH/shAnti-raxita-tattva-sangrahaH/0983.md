## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that there is no incompatibility with the opinion of our Great Teacher:—[*see verse 1385 above*]

‘*Grāhyadharmaḥ*’,—i.e. existing in the *cognisable object*,—i.e. the object in which the Probandum is sought to be proved; i.e. in the Minor Term.—(1385)
