> Primordial matter knows how to produce the soup and other things, and yet does not know how to eat (enjoy) them,—what can be more incongruous than this?—(300)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If it be held that Primordial Matter actually *knows* of the Spirit’s ‘desire to see’ and the rest of it.—then it must have to be regarded as being the ‘Enjoyer’ also. How can one who knows how to produce a thing not know how to enjoy it? Hence what can be more incongruous than that Primordial Matter knows how to produce things, but does not know how to enjoy them? The meaning is that nothing can be more incongruous. The Cook who prepares the soup and other things cannot be regarded as not knowing how to eat (enjoy) them. The particle ‘*iti*’ should be taken as understood after ‘*vijā āti*’.—(300)
