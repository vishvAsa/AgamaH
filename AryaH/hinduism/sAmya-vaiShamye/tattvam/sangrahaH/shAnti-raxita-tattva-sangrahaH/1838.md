> “The ignorant men who, on the basis of mere similarity to invalid cognitions, seek to prove the invalidity of all cognitions,—for them such an argument is conducive to their own ruin. Because for the other party also, there comes about an argument which is the reflection of the Buddhist argument; and thus being refuted by this, the argument (of the Buddhist) turns out to be the means of proving what is not true; and as such, it is not capable of setting aside the Vedic injunction which is inherently valid.”—(2917-2919)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If a Cognition were invalid simply because it is similar (to another Cognition which is invalid),—then all Cognitions would have to be regarded as invalid; because some sort of similarity—such as *being an entity*—can be asserted in all cases.—Such is the meaning of the *Text* in brief.

*Question*:—How is it conducive to their own ruin?

*Answer*:—‘*For the other party also*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Other party*’—i.e. the

*Mīmāṃsaka*.—‘*Reflection*, *etc*.’—just as the reflection appears after the reflected object, so, after the argument of the Buddhist, there appears the counter-argument of the *Mīmāṃsaka*.

For instance, it is open to the *Mīmāṃsaka* to argue as follows:—The words of the Veda are *not false*,—because they are *Words*, etc. etc.;—like such human assertions as ‘Fire is hot, bright and so forth

Thus being refuted—negatived—by such counter-arguments,—the argument that had been adduced by the Buddhist and others to prove the idea of Vedic Injunction being false is quite incapable of rejecting the Vedic Injunction.—Why?—Because of the *inherent validity* of the Vedic

Injunction;—that is to say, the validity of the Vedic Injunction is such as belongs to it by its very nature.—(2917-2919)
