> What sort of ‘destruction’ is it (the causelessness of) which the other people object to? (a) Is it the ‘momentary existence’ of things, as explained by us? Or the ‘cessation of the form of the entity’, called ‘disruption’ (*dhvaṃsa*, annihilation)?—If it is the former, then there is no quarrel.—(373-374)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Destruction* is of two sorts—*positive* and *negative*. For instance when, on account of the thing being mobile and having only a momentary existence, it becomes ‘destroyed’, this is called ‘Destruction’ (of the Positive kind); and there is the other kind of Destruction which consists in the thing losing its positive character and becoming what is called ‘disruption’, ‘annihilation’, If it is in reference to the former kind of ‘Destruction⁵ to whose ‘causelessness’ objection has been taken (by other people) on the ground of the reasons adduced above,—then it is entirely futile (as what is objected to is denied by us also).—(373-374)

The futility of the arguments is further explained:—[*see verse 375 next*]
