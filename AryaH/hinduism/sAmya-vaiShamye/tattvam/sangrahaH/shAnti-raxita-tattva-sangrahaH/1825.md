> “Even in a case where the thing is definitely apprehended by the later cognitions,—the thing has not been clearly and definitely apprehended by the first cognition.”—(2899)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—In places where there is dense darkness, it is actually seen that a thing that has been apprehended (vaguely) by the first cognition is again apprehended (and defined) by later cognitions appearing after the appearance of light.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2899 above*]

What is meant is that the first cognition, being uncertain and vague, cannot be valid.—(2899)
