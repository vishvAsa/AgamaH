> It having been proved that the Veda is the work of a human being, our argument is not proving what is already proved (and hence futile). Mere random teaching of what is not known cannot be always true.—(3451)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“It is possible that the Teachers have taught *Dharma*, etc. after learning it from the Veda; hence your argument is futile”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3451 above*]

Under the chapter on the ‘Revealed Word’, it has been proved that the Veda is the work of a human being; hence our present argument is not ‘futile’.

It might be argued that—“Teachings can be imparted at random, without knowing the things taught; so that your Reason is ‘Inconclusive’.”

The answer to this is—‘*Mere random teaching*, *etc. etc*.’—It is not possible that anyone, without knowledge, should go on talking, and that too against all forms of Right Cognition.—(3451)
