> “From the perception of the fact that the notion of ‘subsisting in this’, which arises out of ‘inherence’, is present in all cases, it is concluded that ‘inherence’ is one only; at the same time, from the perception of the fact that such bases as the universals ‘substance’ and the rest are absent in certain cases, it is concluded that the notions of these universals ‘substance’ and the rest are restricted in their scope.”—(842-843)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In anticipation of the objection that—‘in that case, Inherence would vary with each object’,—*Praśastapati* offers the following explanation:—[*see verses 842-843 above*]

“The notion of ‘subsistence in this’, which is based upon Inherence, is found to appear in all cases in one and the same form, from which it follows that Inherence is one only. However, even though Inherence is one, the notions based upon the Universals ‘Substance’, etc. are found to appear in distinct forms as resting in distinct substrata; and thus they are found to be absent,—not present—in all cases; from this it is concluded that these Universals are distinct and diverse; so that there can be no admixture of the five Categories.”—(842-843)
