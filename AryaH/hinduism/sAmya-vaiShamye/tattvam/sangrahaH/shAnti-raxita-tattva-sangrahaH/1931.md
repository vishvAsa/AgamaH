> As a matter of fact, the cognition brought about by any one sentence is never found to be the same at all times and places, and in all men; as in all cases there arises doubt. It is true that the same words—“heaven is attained by the performance of *agnihotra* and other rites”—are heard by all men; but it is devoid of all elements of certainty,—resembling the mere croaking of frogs.—(3086-3087)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 2904, that—“when the Cognition brought about by any one sentence is the same at all times and places, and in all men,—then no other basis need be sought for its validity”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3086-3087 above*]

This shows that the corroboration by facts cannot be admitted. Because when the Sentence—‘From the performance of Agnihotra, follows Heaven’—is heard, the intelligent man derives no certain Cognition from it; hence it cannot be admitted that it is the same at all times and places.—(3086-3087)

The following *Text* proceeds to show that the Cognition is not the same in all men:—[*see verse 3088 next*]
