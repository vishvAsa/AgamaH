> Even though by itself, the Veda may be able to bring about cognitions,—yet its validity (reliability) cannot be quite clear; as it is dependent upon personalities.—(2376)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* sums up the discussion:—[*see verse 2376 above*]

It has been already explained that what is efficient cannot bring about cognitions through the help of Personalities.—Even granting that the Veda is efficient and yet it is productive of Cognitions through the help of Personalities,—even so, though it may be able to bring about cognitions through the help of Personalities, yet its validity and reliability would not be clearly possible.—Such is the construction of the sentence.

The particle ‘*api*’ is misplaced; it should be construed after ‘*sati*’.—(2376)

The following *Text* further clarifies this same idea:—[*see verse 2377 next*]
