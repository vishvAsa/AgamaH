> Of particles like ‘*ca*’ the meaning intended is something like ‘combination’; and thus there would be ‘exclusion’ by that, of things other than that, in the shape of ‘option’ and the like.—(1159)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 978, by *Kumārila*) that—“in the case of the particles *ca* and the rest, there can be no connection with the negative”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1159 above*]

The term ‘*ādi*’ is meant to include such terms as ‘*vā*’, which denote *option*,—the term ‘*api*’, which denotes *probability*, *connection*, etc.,—the term. ‘*tu*’ which denotes *qualification*,—and the term ‘*eva*’ which denotes *emphasis*.

‘*Other than that*’,—i.e. other than *Combination*, etc.

‘*By that*’—i.e. by the term ‘*ca*’.—(1159)
