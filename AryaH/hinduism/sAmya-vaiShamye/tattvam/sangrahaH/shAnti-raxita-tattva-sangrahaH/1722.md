> If it is argued that—“the previously cognised letters have only their appearance concealed, but when remembered, they are there all right”,—then, the answer is that—it cannot be so; as, if it were so, then there would be a clear idea of them.—(2727)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent:—“It is true according to the *Mīmāṃsakas* also; because under their view, the Letters are *not* destroyed; hence there is nothing to prevent their figuring in the cognition; it is only that their appearance has become concealed; they are there all the same”.

This is what is anticipated in the first part of the following *Text*, and answered by the last part beginning with ‘It cannot be so’:—[*see verse 2727 above*]

If the same Letters that had been heard before are lying with their appearance concealed, and are subsequently apprehended by the cumulative cognition, then like their own cognition, the cumulative cognition also should apprehend them quite distinctly; as the form is exterior to the cognition and it is of one and the same form.—Further, if they have their appearance concealed, how can they appear? Because ‘appearance’ is of the nature of *apprehension*.—(2727)
