> The word ‘cognisable’ is used when there are such doubts as—(*a*) ‘are all things cognisable as momentary, or not?—(*b*) are all things cognisable by the cognition of an all-knowing person? (*c*) are negations, which do not bring about any cognition, cognisable?—(1173-1174)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

(*a*) ‘Are all things cognisable as *momentary*, or not?’—(*b*) ‘Are all things cognisable by the Cognition of an Omniscient Person?’—(c) ‘Are *Negations*,—which are of the nature of the absence of all determining features, and which do not even bring about a cognition—cognisable?’—When such doubts appear, then, it is said—‘all things are *cognisable* as momentary;—and they are *cognisable* by an Omniscient Person;—and Negations also are *cognisable*—And in all these what is ‘excluded’ (negatived) is the supposition that ‘things are *cognisable* as non-momentary’ and so forth.—(1173-1174)

*Question* “Is all this supposition negatived by the mere assertion (of *cognisabūity* in a certain form)?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1175 next*]
