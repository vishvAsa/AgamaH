## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the Author further reiterates the ‘inconclusive’ character of the Reason adduced by the other party:—[*see verse 572 above*]

There are such expressions used as ‘*ṣaṇṇām padārthānām astitvam*’, ‘the existence *of the Six Categories*’, ‘*ṣaṇṇām vargaḥ*’, ‘the group *of six*’,—where the Genitive forms are used, even though there is no real difference between the two factors (the *Categories* and their *existence*, or the *Categories* and their *group*). You do not admit any such thing as ‘existence’, apart from the Six ‘Categories’ themselves.

This is only by way of illustration. In fact, in such words as ‘*dārāḥ*’, ‘*sikatāḥ*’ and the like, even though the Plural number is used, we do not perceive a multiplicity of the things (*wife* or *sand*).

As a matter of fact, the ‘*svatva*’, ‘self-hood’, of a thing is not regarded as a distinct category.—(572)
