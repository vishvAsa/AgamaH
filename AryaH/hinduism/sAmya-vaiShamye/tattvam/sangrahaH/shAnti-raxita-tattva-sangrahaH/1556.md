> The Veda is recognised as capable of being, treated as the effect produced by the ‘manifester’,—because it appears only when this latter is present;—like the sprout in the presence of the seed.—(2420)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The argument may be formulated as follows:—When one thing is found to appear when there is functioning of another thing, the former is capable of being treated as the effect produced by the latter,—for instance, the sprout, appearing when the seed functions, is regarded as its effect;—the Veda is found to appear only when the functioning of the Reader (Manifester) is there; hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.

‘*Being treated*’ consists in abandoning or securing the thing.—‘*Ādi*’ stands for *being cognised, being spoken of* and so forth.

The Reason here adduced is not ‘inadmissible’; if it were, then the Veda would be perceived even before (its manifestation by the Reader).

Nor is the Reason ‘Inconclusive’; as there can be no other reason for its being treated as a *product*.—(2420)
