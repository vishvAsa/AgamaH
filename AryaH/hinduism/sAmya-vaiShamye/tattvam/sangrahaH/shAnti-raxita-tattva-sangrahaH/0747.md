> Just as, even in the absence of form, there is imaginary unity (uniformity),—in the same manner, difference also could be imaginary; whence then could the words be synonymous?—(1032)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“If among formless things, there cannot be *presence of the same form*, in reality,—even so it would be there in imaginary form; and on the basis of that the incongruity of all words being synonymous can be rightly urged”.

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1032 above*]

‘*In the absence of form*’—i.e. in the absence of any characteristic features.—(1032)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then how is there any such notion among people that these words are synonymous, and those others are not synonymous?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1033 next*]
