> Inasmuch as no argument has been adduced as negativing the contrary,—there is an uncertainty regarding the negative concomitance (of the probans with the probandum); so that, there being a suspicion regarding the presence (of the probans) in the contrary of the pobandum,—the probans remains ‘inconclusive’.—(1919)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having pointed out the defect in the Corroborative Instance, the Author proceeds to show that the Probans also is open to the charge of being ‘Inconclusive’:—[*see verse 1919 above*]

‘*Inasmuch as, etc*. *etc*.’;—this is the reason for the uncertainty regarding the Negative Concomitance [i.e. there is no certainty as to the Probans being *absent* whenever the Probandum is *absent*].

‘*There being a suspicion, etc. etc*.’.—This is the reason for ‘Inconclusiveness’.

‘*Vijātīyasadbhāva*’—is *presence in the contrary*.—“Whose presence?”—of the Probans.

The compound ‘*Śaṅkyamāna, etc*. *etc*.’ is to be expounded as ‘whose presence in the contrary is suspected.’

Nor could the contingency of the idea (of Death-Cognition producing another Cognition) being taken to imply the *absence of death* be taken as serving the purpose of the argument negativing the contrary. Because in reality there is no ‘death’ of anything in the shape of the ‘Soul’ and other things; what really happens is that a dissimilar Chain becomes set up, which brings about the cessation of the condition which gave the name to the particular body; and it is this that is spoken of as ‘Death’ in common parlance and also in scientific treatises.—(1919)
