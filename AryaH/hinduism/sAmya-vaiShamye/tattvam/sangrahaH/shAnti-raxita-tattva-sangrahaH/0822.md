> There can be no number in the universal at all.—Even if the number were there in the universal, how could the individuals be qualified by that number?—“[They could be so qualified] through the connection of what is connected (indirectly), or through direct connection itself”.—[If this be held then the answer would be as in the following text]—(1138)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted (by *Kumārila*, quoted under Text 1136) that—“the word ‘*vana*’ denotes the Individuals as qualified by the Number of the Universal”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1138 above*]

There can be no Number in the Universal; as it subsists in *substance* only.

This has been said in accordance with the doctrine of the *Vaiśeṣikas*. In case that doctrine is not accepted, and it is held that Number does belong to the Universal,—then, in what way could it be established that the Individuals, *Dhava* and other trees, are qualified by that Number (of the Universal)?

The following explanation might be offered:—“It could be so established *either* (*indirectly*) *through the connection of the connected*, *or through direct Connection itself*; that is, if the Number is something different from the Universal, then the Universal would be *connected* with the Singular Number,—and without Universal there would be *connection* of the Individuals, trees, *Dhava* and the rest; thus the qualifying of the *Dhava* and other Individual Trees would be done indirectly;—if, on the other hand, the Number is not something different from the Universal, then that would be *directly* connected with the Individual Trees, which would thus become qualified by that Number. In this way it would be established that the Individuals are ‘qualified by the Number of the Universal—(1138)

The following *Text* supplies the answer to the explanation given (in the latter part of the preceding *Text*):—[*see verse 1139 next*]
