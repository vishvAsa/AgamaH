> The composite substance made up of atoms,—as distinct from qualities and components,—is never apprehended; hence, there being no evidence for it, it cannot be admitted.—(556)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus denied the Substance in the form of *Cause* (Atoms), the Author next proceeds to deny it in the form of *Products* (Things composed of Atoms):—[*see verse 556 above*]

‘*Qualities*’—Colour, etc.;—‘*Components*’—Yarns, etc.;—that which is something different from these;—such a *Composite*, distinct from Qualities and Components, is never apprehended. As a matter of fact, any such composite substance as the ‘Cloth’, complete in itself, and entirely different from qualities like *Whiteness*, and from components, in the shape of the Yarns (composing it)—never appears in any visual or other kinds of Cognition.—From this non-perception of the Substance as distinct from Qualities, it also follows that there is no basis for the idea that Substance and Quality are distinct categories;—and from the non-perception of the *Composite* as distinct from the *Components*, it follows that the idea of Component and Composite (Part and Whole) is groundless.—This argument may be formulated as follow:—When a perceptible thing is not perceived, it does not exist,—just as the Jar, not being perceived at a certain place, is regarded as non-existent;—and no ‘Qualified Substance’, apart from the Qualities and Components,—which is held to be perceptible,—is ever perceived as occupying the same place;—nor is any ‘Composite’ ever perceived apart from the Components;—hence this is a natural reason (for regarding such Composite Substance as *non-existent*).—The Reason adduced here cannot be said to be ‘not admitted’; because there is the distinct declaration of *Kaṇāda* to the effect that ‘In a gross substance, there is perception due to its containing several substances and to qualities’ (*Vaiśeṣika-sūtra*), which clearly shows that the. Quality and the Components are regarded as perceptible.—(556)
