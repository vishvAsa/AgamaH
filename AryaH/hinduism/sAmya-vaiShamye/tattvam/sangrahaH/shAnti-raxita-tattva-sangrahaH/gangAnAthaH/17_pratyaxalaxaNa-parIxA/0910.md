> “If perception is regarded as apprehending the thing as distinguished from other apprehensible things,—then this cognition would be conceptual (determinate), just like the cognition of the tree and other things.”—(1268)



## Kamalaśīla

“If Sense-perception is intended to be apprehensive of the Thing as characterised (distinguished) by a character not found anywhere else,—then it becomes *Conceptual*; because it apprehends the thing as *characterised or* qualified by some character; just like the Perception in the form ‘This is a tree’.”—(1268)
