> As a matter of fact, the cognition that is capable of connecting the thing and the word always appears as associated with verbal expression (words),—even when the words-like ‘tree’ and the like—are not actually used.—(1215)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*—“How is it known that there is such an *Idea* (or Cognition)?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1215 above*]

The construction may be as—‘even when the words like *tree*, etc. are not used’,—*or* as ‘which is capable of connecting the thing and the word, in the shape of *tree*, etc.’.

This indicates the Conceptual Content as something directly perceived; the said Idea being recognised by the experience of all living beings.—(1215)
