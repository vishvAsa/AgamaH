> Of the particular things there is no other characteristic except that of being ‘particular’ (or ‘distinct’); how then can there be any apprehension of them which does not envisage the ‘distinct’ form? Even if their forms are envisaged, they are apprehended only as distinct from other particulars; so that their perception would be ‘conceptual’.—(1280-1283)



## Kamalaśīla

There is no ‘Particular’ apart from the various Things. If then, the Particular were not envisaged in the apprehension of the Uni versa’, how could the various Things be apprehended? That is to say, being non-different from the nature of what is not apprehended, the Particulars also would be not -apprehended.

If it be held that the various Things *are* apprehended,—then, if these forms are envisaged,—and are apprehended,—the *Particular* also would be apprehended, being, as it is, non-different from what has been apprehended. So that, in regard to these various things, the Cognition that is held to be apprehensive of the *Universal* turns out to be *conceptual*.—(1280-1281)
