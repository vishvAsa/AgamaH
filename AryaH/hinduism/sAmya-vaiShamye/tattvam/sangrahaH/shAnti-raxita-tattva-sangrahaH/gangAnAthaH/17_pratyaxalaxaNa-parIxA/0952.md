> “They (pleasure, etc.) are non-apprehensive of another thing; how then can they carry their own cognisance with them? In fact, they become cognisable only by the cognition which subsists in the same substratum as themselves”.—If this is urged—[then the answer is as in the following texts].—(1331)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* sets forth the *Vaiśeṣika* view (regarding the exact nature of the sensations of Pleasure, etc.):—[*see verses 1331 above*]

“It is not only that they are not self-cognised; they are not apprehensive of any external thing either; that is, they are of the nature of Cognition, In fact Pleasure, etc, become cognised only by that Cognition which subsists in the same substratum as themselves—i.e. the Soul”.

Such is the doctrine of the *Vaiśeṣikas*.—(1331)

The above view is answered in the following—[*see verses 1332-1339 next*]
