> At the particular time, there is no other conceptual content which is associated with the name of that object; because there is no recognition of any such perceptible conceptual content, and the simultaneous presence of both cannot be desirable.—(1245)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—“In that case, there may be some other Conceptual Content that would apprehend the object;—why is not this view accepted?”

*Answer*;—[*see verse 1245 above*]

There are two answers pointed out in due sequence—(1) the opponent’s idea being contrary to perceived facts, and (2) its being contrary to his own doctrines; inasmuch as it involves the presence of two Conceptual Contents at the same time.

‘*Both*’—i.e. the two Conceptual Contents.—(1245)
