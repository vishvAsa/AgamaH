> “At first there is only a pre-cognition, which is non-conceptual, like the cognition of the infant and the dumb and the like;—it is born purely of the thing (cognised); at that moment, neither the universal nor the particular character is apprehended; all that is apprehended is only a certain individual which is the substratum of both those characters.—(Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 112-113).—Subsequently, the thing becomes apprehended along with the properties of the ‘class-character’ and the rest; and the cognition also by which it is thus apprehended is regarded as ‘sense-perception’.—(Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 120).”—(1286-1288).



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Texts*, the Author proceeds to present the view of *Kumārila*; and thereby indicates the charge against his own Reason (Premiss)—put forward (under *Text* 1257 above), to the effect that ‘when there is no basis for the existence of a thing in a certain form, that thing, in that form, cannot be admitted as real’,—that it is partly ‘inadmissible’ as not present in a part of the Subject of the Reasoning:—[*see verses 1286-1288 above*]

All sense-perceptions are made here the Subject (of the Argument); and the sense is that the Premiss (of the Buddhist)—that ‘the basis of *conceptuality*, in the shape of the apprehension of the thing qualified by qualifications, cannot be there’—is not admissible. Because, as a matter of fact, except in the *initial Pre-cognition*, in all other Sense-perceptions, ‘the apprehension of the thing as qualified by qualifications’ is present.—If the Buddhist puts forward his Premiss in reference to the *Pre-cognition*, then the argument is superfluous.

Such is the view of the Opponent (*Kumārila*).

‘*Like the cognition of the infant and the dumb*’;—i.e. like the infant’s cognition, and like the dumb person’s cognition.—‘*And the rest*’ is meant to include the man in a swoon. The only point of similarity in all these cases is *the absence of association with words*

‘*Purely*’;—what is meant by this ‘purity’ is freedom from the two Universals.

This same idea is made clearer in the second text (1287)—‘*Neither the Universal nor the Particular, etc. etc*.’—The term ‘*Particular*’ stands for the intermediate Universal, ‘Cow’ and the like; and ‘*Universal*’ for the Summum Genus, ‘Entity’ and the like,—‘*The substratum of both these*’;—this indicates the *pure* thing.

‘*Subsequently*, *etc*.’—This makes clear the partial ‘inadmissibility’ of the same Premiss. ‘*Subsequently*’—i.e after the apprehension of the apprehension of the pure thing,—that cognition, by which the thing is apprehended along with the qualifications of the class-character and the rest, is also regarded as ‘Sense-perception

‘*By the class-character*, *etc*.’—This indicates the apprehension of the Thing as qualified by qualifications.

This shows that the said cognition apprehends what has not been already apprehended:—and also that the Premiss (of the Buddhist) is inadmissible.—(1286-1288)
