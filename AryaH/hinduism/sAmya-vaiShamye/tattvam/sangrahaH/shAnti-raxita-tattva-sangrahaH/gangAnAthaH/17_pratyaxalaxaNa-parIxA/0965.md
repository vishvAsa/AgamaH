> The argument is futile; as a different ‘fruit’ has been admitted; and in accordance with reasons already explained (under text 1348), there is no ‘different’ fruit at all.—As regards the means of cognition being an ‘active agent’,—that is not admissible by us, if what is meant by it is that it is productive; if what is meant is that it is the regulator, then there can be no objection to it; and in that case the reason becomes ‘inconclusive’, as it indicates no incongruity.—(1353-1355)



## Kamalaśīla

*Śaṅkarasvāmin* urges the following argument:—[*see verses 1353 above*]

“The Means of Cognition must be one that brings about an effect different from itself,—because it is an active agent,—like the Hatchet, etc.”—(1353)

The answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verses 1353-1355 above*]

‘*Futile*’,—because it seeks to prove what is already proved; inasmuch as *different* ‘fruit’ or ‘effect’ has been already admitted in the form of ‘characterisation’ (specification).—The particle ‘*hi*’ connotes *reason* (for what is said).

The corroborative instance cited—‘*like the Hatchet*’,—is one that is ‘devoid of the Probandum’; because it has been already shown that the *Hatchet* is the same as the *Cut* (vide *Text*, 1348).

The premise—‘*because it is an active agent*’—is ‘inadmissible’ if what is meant is that it is *prodtictive* of its effect; if it is meant that it is the *Regulator*,—then that is accepted by us.

But even if it is meant that it is the *Regulator*, the Reason is Inconclusive, as there is no incongruity (indicated).

If ‘activity’ *in general* be what is meant, then also the Reason is Inconclusive, as there is no incongruity indicated.—(1353-1355)
