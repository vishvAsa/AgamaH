> The reasoning that is used in proving the non-conceptual character of the cognitions produced by the mental sense-organ, also serves to prove the non-conceptual character of the sensations of pleasure, etc.—(1330)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author now proceeds to show how the character of ‘Sense-perception’ belongs to the Sensation of Pleasure, etc.:—[*see verses 1330 above*]

‘*The Reasoning, etc*.’—that is, the argument based upon the impossibility of Conventions and so forth.

Even though this Reasoning has nowhere been urged specifically in regard to mental cognition, yet the Reasoning that has been urged in regard to Cognitions through other Sense-organs,—in the shape of the impossibility of Conventions,—is equally applicable to Mental Cognitions also.

Or, the ‘mental’ cognition meant here may be the cognition of the Mystic, which is going to be referred to later on. The Mental Perception has not been defined here, as its character is well-known to Buddhists.

What the *Text* means is that the fact of the Buddhist view of the sensations in question being not annulled by any means of right cognition, has been fully explained by the Teacher; hence we do not seek to prove it here.—(1330)
