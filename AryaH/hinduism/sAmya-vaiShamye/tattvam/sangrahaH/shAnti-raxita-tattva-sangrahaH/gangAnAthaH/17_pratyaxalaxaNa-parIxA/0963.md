> The ‘fruit’ consisting in the apprehension of the object, the character of the ‘means of cognition’ must belong to what goes immediately before it. Hence if the cognition be held to be the ‘means then the ‘fruit’ must be something else.—It cannot be right to attribute the character of the ‘fruit’ to the self-recognition (by the cognition), as this is going to be refuted later on. Nor can it be right to assert that the ‘means’ consists in the form of the object (cognised); as in that case there would be a diversity of objectives”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 78-79],—(1350-1351)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* sets forth the character of the ‘Fruit’ as proposed by *Kumārila*:—[*see verses 1350-1351 above*]

‘*What goes*, *etc*. *etc*.’—i.e. the Eye and the other sense-organs.

‘*The Fruit must be something else*’;—in the form of *rejecting* or *acquiring* or *ignoring* the thing cognised;—this also has been declared by *Kumārila* himself.

As regards ‘self-recognition’ (by the Cognition), that has been refuted; hence that cannot be regarded as the ‘Fruit’ of Right Cognition.

If the *form of the object* be held to be the Means of Cognition, then the objectives of the Means and the Fruit would be different; for instance, the *form of the object* would be something external (*objective*), while the self-recognition of the Cognition would have the form of the Cognition itself (which is purely *subjective*).—(1350-1351)

The above argument is answered in the following—[*see verse 1352 next*]
