## Kamalaśīla

It might be urged that—“The Reason is Inadmissible, as it pertains to the Universal only”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1295 above*]

‘*The qualification would be something absolutely distinct*’—from the Thing qualified.

‘*This is not acceptable to the other party*’,—i.e. this absolute distinction between the qualification and the qualified.

“How do you know that it is not acceptable?”

*Answer*:—‘As has been asserted’—i.e. by himself.—(1295)

*Question*:—“What is it that has been asserted by him?” *Answer*:—[*Kumārila* says as below]—[*see verse 1296 next*]
