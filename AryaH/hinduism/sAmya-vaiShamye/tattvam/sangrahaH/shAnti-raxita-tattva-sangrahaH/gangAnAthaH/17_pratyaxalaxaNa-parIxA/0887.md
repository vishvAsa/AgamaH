## Kamalaśīla

What is meant is as follows:—Such words as ‘*Dittha*’ which are known as *Proper Names*, also take up a ‘Universal’ as their denotation, which

Universal subsists in an entity restricted within a limited period of time; they denote such a Universal because they are incapable of denoting any object marked by a momentarily fluctuating character, while each of these (Proper Names) continues to remain attached to one entity from birth to death. If the Proper Name did not denote such a Universal, then,—having been applied to the individual in his childhood, how could it denote that same individual in his old age, who would have become a different individuality?—Even for those persons who hold the view that the body is not momentary, but lasts for some time,—it- is admitted that in course of time, the component parts of the body go on deteriorating, by reason of which deterioration,—or by reason of its connection with such deterioration of the components,—the body in a later age is different from that in the earlier age.—Even under the view that it remains the same body undergoing developments and changes,—the Name that has been associated with a certain thing at one stage of its development, could not denote the same thing when it has reached a further stage of development; e.g. the name ‘milk’ which has been associated with the Milk in the first stage, is not applicable to the *Curd*, which is only a later stage in the development of milk. In the same way in the case of the Body also, the name applied to it in childhood could not be applied to it in youth or old age. For these reasons, the Universal must be admitted (even in the case of the Denotation of Proper Names).

Or, even if there be no such entity as the Universal (in this case),—even so, our explanation does not cease to apply to the case of Proper Names. Because it is only the diverse Individuals that are conceived of as common—when their distinct individualities are not meant to be emphasised,—when they become included under Common names denotative of the ‘Universal Consequently the Teacher propounding the definition under question has mentioned the Proper Names separately from Common names. This is what is explained by the words—‘*It has been mentioned separately, etc. etc*.’. In common parlance, the word ‘Cow’ is known as a *Common* name (denoting a Universal) while the word ‘*Citrāṅgada*’ is known as a *Proper* Name (applied to a single Individual); that is why the two have been mentioned separately.—(1226)
