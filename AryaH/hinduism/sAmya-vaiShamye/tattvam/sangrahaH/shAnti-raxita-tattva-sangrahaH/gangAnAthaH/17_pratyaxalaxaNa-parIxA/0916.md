## Kamalaśīla

In case the Reason adduced by the Opponent—‘because it apprehends -a qualified thing’—is based on the idea that through ‘negation’ (differentiation) itself the thing becomes *qualified*,—even though it be not *qualified* in the sense of being connected with a qualification in the shape of some other thing,—even so our Reason cannot become ‘Inconclusive’,—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1274 above*]

The Universal has been held to be of two kinds—(1) distinguished by qualifications, and (2) not distinguished by qualifications. That which is not distinguished by qualifications has been held to be apprehended by Non-conceptual Perception.

‘*To that*’—i.e. to the Universal.—Hence the charge of being apprehended by Conceptual Perception would apply to these also.—(1274)

*Question*:—“How so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1275 next*]
