> The cognition of the object is held to be the ‘fruit’ of the means of cognition,—when the ‘means of cognition’ consists in the ‘sameness of form’ (between the cognition and the cognised);—or apprehension of itself is the fruit, and the means, in this case, consists in ‘capability’.—(1344)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author next proceeds to set aside the diversity of opinion regarding the ‘Fruit’ (ultimate effect) of ‘Sense-perception’ as a means of Cognition:—[*see verse 1344 above*]

(*a*) When the external object is what is *cognised*,—then the cognition of that object is the *Fruit*, and *Sameness of form* the *Means*, of the Cognition; as even in the case of the self-cognition, the Cognition is of the same form as what is cognised.—(*b*) When what is *cognised* is of the nature of *Cognition*, then the ‘apprehension of itself’ is the *fruit*, and *capability* the *Means*, of the Cognition. The said *capability* belongs to the Cognition only which carries with it the cognisability of its own function; by virtue of which *capability*, it is Cognition alone—and not the Jar and such things,—that apprehends itself;—hence it is by the instrumentality of this *capability* that Cognition is found to be *self-manifested*; hence *Capability* is said to be the ‘Means’, the Instrument, of the Cognition of the Cognition itself. This has been thus declared—‘The Cognitions of Cognitions themselves, being neither the one nor the other, are *capable* of such self-apprehension; hence their capability is the *Instrument* (Means) and they themselves are the *cognised*, and their own apprehension is the *fruit*’,—(1344)
