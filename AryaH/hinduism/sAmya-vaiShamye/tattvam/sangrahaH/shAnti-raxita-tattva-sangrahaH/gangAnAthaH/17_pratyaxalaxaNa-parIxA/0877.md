> Through the continuance of the impression left by the constant associating of the thing and its name during past lives,—even the new-born infant becomes capable of activity, by reason of the said conceptual content.—(1216)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that the said Conceptual Content is well known as the source of all activities of persons from infancy onwards:—[*see verse 1216 above*]

‘*Atīta-bhava*’ is *past lives*;—during these there has been ‘*nāmārthabhāvanā*’, constant associating of things with their names;—this constant associating leaves its ‘*Vāsanā*’, Impressions, or capacity in the mind;—through the ‘*anvaya*’, continuance of this capacity, even the infant has ideas associated with words; and it is through the presence of this Conceptual Content (Idea associated with words), that the infant becomes capable of activity,—such as smiling, crying, sucking the breast, becoming pleased and so forth.—From this effect its cause in the -shape of the said Conceptual Content is assumed in the infant. This has been thus declared—‘All activity in the world is based upon words, which even the infant has recourse to, through the impressions left by past lives’.

This Conceptual Content, presenting the object, as associated with vague verbal expressions and existing only in the subjective form,—as if it were something external,—appears in the mind of Infants also, by virtue of which in their later life, they become capable of comprehending the relevant Conventions.—(1216)
