> On account of there being no absolute distinction (between the universal and the specific individuality),—if the universal and other properties have become already apprehended by the initial cognition,—then the subsequent cognition would be apprehending only what has been already apprehended,—and it would thus be like remembrance.—(1298)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been proved that if the subsequent Cognitions apprehend the Specific Individuality, they must be ‘Non-conceptual’.—The Author now proceeds to show that—even granting that the said cognitions are ‘Conceptual’, as they would be apprehending only what has been already apprehended (by the previous *Non-conceptual* Cognition), no *validity* could attach to those Cognitions:—[*see verse 1298 above*]

The Universal and the rest are not regarded as absolutely distinct from the Individual; as has been declared by *Kumārila* (in *Ślokavārtika*, Sense-perception, 141) that—“The Universal and the rest are not anything other than the Individual Under the circumstances, as the Universal and the rest will have been already apprehended by the initial (non-conceptual) Pre-cognition, the subsequent definite (conceptual) cognition of the same Universal and the rest would be apprehending only what has been already apprehended,—and thus being like Remembrance,—it must have to be regarded as *invalid*.

This argument may be formulated as follows:—The Cognition apprehending what has been already apprehended cannot be valid,—e.g. Remembrance;—the Conceptual Cognition following on the wake of Perception apprehends what has been already apprehended;—hence there is perception of a character contrary to the wider notion (of validity).—(1298)
