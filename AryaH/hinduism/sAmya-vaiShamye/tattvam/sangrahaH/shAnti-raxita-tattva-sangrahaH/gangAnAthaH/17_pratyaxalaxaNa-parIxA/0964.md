> ‘self-recognition’ cannot be denied; as that would involve the incongruity of there being no cognition at all.—Nor can the objectives be different; as ‘self-recognition’ aslo is held to be the cognition of the object.—(1352)



## Kamalaśīla

In accordance with the maxim—‘He who has no apprehension of Sense-perception can have no perception of anything’—there would be incongruity of there being no perception of anything, if the cognition of the cognition itself were denied; hence this ‘self-recognition’ cannot be denied.

Nor can it be right to hold that the two cognitions have two different objectives; because ‘self-recognition’ also is held to be the cognition of the *object*, because it is the effect of that, not because it consists entirely of that; as it has been explained that the self-recognition has the same form. Hence there is no incongruity at all.—(1352)
