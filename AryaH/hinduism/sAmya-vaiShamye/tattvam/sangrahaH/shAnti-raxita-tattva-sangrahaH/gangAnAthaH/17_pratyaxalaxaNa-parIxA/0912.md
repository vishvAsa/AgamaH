> “The assertion that the cognition apprehends a qualified thing, and yet it is not conceptual implies great temerity indeed! certainly, no ‘qualification’ is possible except through connection with qualifications.”—(1270)



## Kamalaśīla

“From all this it follows that your assertion—that the Cognition apprehends a *qualified* object, and yet there is in it no Conceptual Content implies great temerity on your part, in making an assertion opposed to all canons of Right Cognition.”

This sums up the criticism against the Buddhist doctrine.

“The Reason for this is provided, in the words—‘*Certainly no qualification, etc. etc*.’—that is to say, just as a man does not become a *stick-holder*, without the *stick*,—so a thing cannot be *qualified* without connection with *qualifications*.—Hence that cognition which apprehends the qualifications is ‘*Conceptual*’ (with Conceptual Content).

“The argument may be formulated as follows:—The Apprehension of the qualified thing, which is under dispute, *is Conceptual*,—because it apprehends a qualified thing,—like the cognition ‘This is a piece of Cloth’.”—(1270)

The following *Text* proceeds to answer the above criticisms of *Sumati*:—[*see verse 1271 next*]
