> There is no incompatibility between the conceptual content and the said reasons; nor is there difference in their objects; as the object apprehended by the one is the same as that apprehended by the other.—(1308)



## Kamalaśīla

Both the Reasons adduced (in the preceding *Text*) are ‘Inconclusive’; as no incompatibility has been indicated between the Reasons and the contrary of the conclusion sought to be proved by them.

‘*Anayoḥ*’—of the two Reasons.

‘*Nor is there difference*, *etc*. *etc*.’;—that is to say, even though the Conceptual Content is objective (has an object), yet the assertion that ‘their objects are different’ is ‘inadmissible’.—(1308)
