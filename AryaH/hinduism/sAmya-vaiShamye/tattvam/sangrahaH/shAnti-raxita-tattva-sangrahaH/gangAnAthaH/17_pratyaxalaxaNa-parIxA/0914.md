> What is meant by ‘being qualified’ (distinguished) is ‘difference”—not the connection of qualifications. but the idea also that ‘this is different’ is not cognised as associated with words.—(1272)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“Then are all such expressions as ‘qualified’, ‘being, distinguished’, ‘qualified character’, and so forth purely *negative*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1272 above*]

‘*Difference*’—i.e. Differentiation (Preclusion) from homogeneous and heterogeneous things;—and this is not anything different from the thing differentiated; it is the thing itself which is spoken of in that form, through, the exclusion of other things, when this exclusion is meant to be emphasised.

The following might be urged—“If there is always the apprehension of the Thing as distinguished from homogeneous and heterogeneous things,, then the Apprehension becomes ‘*determinate*’ (Conceptual); because it appears in the Verbal form ‘This is different Otherwise how could it apprehend the ‘difference’, if it appeared in any other form? When a certain apprehension appears in one form, it cannot be said to apprehend another; if it did so, it would lead to an absurdity.”

The answer to this is—‘*But the idea also, etc*. *etc*.’—(1272)
