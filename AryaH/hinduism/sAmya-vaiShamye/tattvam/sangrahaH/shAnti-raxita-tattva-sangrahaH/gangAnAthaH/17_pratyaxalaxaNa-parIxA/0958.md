> “Just as, when the cutting weapon strikes at the Khadira-tree, the resultant cut does not appear in the Palāśa-tree,—in the same way nowhere in the world is the (cutting) axe found to be the same as the cut itself”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 75).—(1345)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following the Author sets forth the objection urged by *Kumārila*—[*see verse 1345 above*]

The *Bauddha* has addressed the following argument to the person who asserted that the *Means* of Cognition was different from its *Fruit*:—If there is difference between the Means of Cognition and its Fruit, then the objective of these two—the *Means* of Cognition and the *Fruit* of Cognition—also must be different; and yet this cannot be right; when, for instance, the cutting weapon, the Axe, is struck at the *Khadira-*tree, the *Cut* does not appear in the *Palāśa-*tree; hence it must be admitted that the objective of both is the same and hence there is no difference between them.

It is in answer to this that *Kumārila* says—“If one who desires the objective to be the same should declare the Means of Cognition to be the same as its Fruit, then he would be setting aside the well-known distinction between Cause and Effect; just as, when the cutting weapon strikes at the *Khadira-*tree, the *Cut* does not appear in the *Palāsha-tree*, so also nowhere in the world is the Axe found to be the same as the Cut itself” (*Śloka*-*vārtika*—Sense-perception, 74-75).

The word ‘*Chedana*’, ‘Cutting weapon’, stands for *that by which something is cut*.—(1345)
