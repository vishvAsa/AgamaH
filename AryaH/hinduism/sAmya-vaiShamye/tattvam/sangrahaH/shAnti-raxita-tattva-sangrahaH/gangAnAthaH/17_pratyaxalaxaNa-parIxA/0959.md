> The distinction of ‘cause and effect’ does not rest upon the substratum of that distinction; cognition being formless, the said distinction cannot be possible.—(1346)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* supplies the answer to this argument of *Kumārila’s*:—[*see verse 1346 above*]

The apprehension of *Blue* is not the apprehension of *Yellow*,—this distinction in the cognition of things is based upon the *sameness of form*, nothing else; so that the distinction of Cause and Effect is made through the relation of *what is distinguished* and *what distinguishes*, not through the relation of the *Produced* and *Producer*; because the relation of the *Acting Agent*, the *Instrument* and the rest is not real; because all things being momentary, they cannot have any action. When the Cognition is produced in the form of the Object, it appears to be characterising the object and hence active. Herein lies the action of the Cognition in presenting the object,—not in mere invariable concomitance. For instance, the sprout does not cease to be invariably concomitant with the seed. Thus the Cognition itself cannot be the *Means* of Cognition.—It is for this reason that the nature of the *Means of Cognitio7i* is stated through the distinction that it is the Cognition *with a form*,—not the *formless* Cognition—which is the Means of Cognition. This distinction too should be understood to be made through the Conception that follows in the wake of the Cognition.—(1346)
