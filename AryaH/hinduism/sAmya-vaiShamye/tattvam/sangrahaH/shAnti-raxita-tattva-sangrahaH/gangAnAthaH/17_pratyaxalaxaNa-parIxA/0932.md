> One and the same cognition cannot comprehend both the specific individuality and the universal; because, if such a cognition were ‘conceptual’, there could be no comprehension of the former,—on the other hand, if it were otherwise, there could be no comprehension of the latter.—(1297)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“As a matter of fact, the subsequent cognitions envisage both (the Universal as well as the Particular), inasmuch as what they apprehend is the *Particular as characterised by the Universal*; so that they cannot be said to apprehend the Specific Individuality only”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1297 above*]

It is not right that one and the same Cognition should apprehend the Specific Individuality as well as the Universal.—Because, would that Cognition be *Conceptual* or *Non-conceptual*? If it were *Conceptual*,—Determinate,—then there could be no apprehension of the ‘*former*’,—i.e. the Specific Individuality.—If ‘*otherwise*’,—i.e. if it is *Non-conceptual*,—then there could be no apprehension of the ‘*latter*’—i.e. of the Universal.—(1297)
