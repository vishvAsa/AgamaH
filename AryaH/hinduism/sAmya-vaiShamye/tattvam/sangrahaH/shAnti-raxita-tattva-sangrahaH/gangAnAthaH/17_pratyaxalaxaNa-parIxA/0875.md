## Kamalaśīla

‘Sense-perception’ as a Means of Cognition consists of the Eye and the rest and is (*a) conceptual* (determinate), or (*b*) of the nature of ‘Non-cognition Such is the diversity of opinion regarding the nature of Sense-perception.—By rejecting this, the Author propounds his own definition of it:—[*see verse 1214 above*]

The character of being ‘Sense-perception’ is what is predicated of that Cognition which has been described as ‘free from conceptual content and not erroneous’; as in every case, it is the defined thing (distinguishing feature) that is predicated. [The meaning therefore is—‘That Cognition which is free from conceptual content and is not erroneous is Sense-perception’];—as is found in the case of such expressions as ‘That which shakes is the *Aśvattha*—The thing defined here is Sense-perception; as it is the definition of tins that forms the subject-matter of the present Context. It is not the definition of ‘freedom from conceptual content and non-erroneous-ness’ that is the subject-matter of the Context; by virtue of which this latter could be taken as predicated in the sentence.

The ‘Cognition’ has not been mentioned, because it is already implied in the negation of ‘Conceptual Content’; just as in the case of the sentence ‘Bring the milch one without the calf’, where the *cow* is not mentioned, as it is already implied by the negation of the *calf*.

*Question*:—“What is it that is meant by the term ‘Conceptual Content’ (‘*Kalpanā*’), freedom from which serves as the differentia of Sense-perception?”

*Answer*:—‘*Conceptual Content is idea associated with verbal expression*’.

*Question*:—“Is that *Kalpanā* also to be admitted, against which, in the character of being the *basis of verbal expression*, Śaṅkarasvāmin and others have urged objections in great detail?”

*Answer*:—No; *it is not the basis of verbal expression*;—‘regarded as’—this has to be taken as understood. Hence the objections that have been urged on that score are not applicable to our view; because we do not accept that view.

‘*Klṛpti*’ is *verbal expression* (‘being spoken, of’, ‘being named’); and the basis for such expression consists of the *Universal*, the *Name* and so forth; since there can be no *speaking of* things without such distinguishing features as consist of the Universal, etc.

The term ‘*ādi*’ (*etcetera*)—in the *text* is meant to include such characteristics as Doubt and Deliberation, as leading to association with words etc., and also the assumption of the apprehender and the apprehended and so forth.

‘*Abhilāpa*’—is *expressive word*; and it is in a generic form; that Idea which appears as associated with that word is called ‘*abhilāpinī*’—(1214)
