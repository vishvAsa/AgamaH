> What has been asserted is that there is no perceptible conceptual content which is associated with the name of the object before the man’s eyes.—(?)—(1248)



## Kamalaśīla

What is meant is as follows:—What is being dealt with is not the fact of the two appearing together, but the absence of Conceptual Content in the Perception; and this absence is proved by the fact that even when a man has his mind elsewhere at the time of the apprehension of the object before bis eyes, he does not apprehend the otherwise apprehensible Conceptual Content associated with the name of that object. And the Opponent has urged no criticism against this. Because, even if the two cognitions are actually apprehended in succession,—the Conceptual Content is not apprehended; so that the attack does not affect our main position.—(1248)
