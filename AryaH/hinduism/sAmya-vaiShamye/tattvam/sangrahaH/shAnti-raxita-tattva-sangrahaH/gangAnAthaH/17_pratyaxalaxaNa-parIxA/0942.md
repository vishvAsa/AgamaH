## Kamalaśīla

Again, the Text is going to show that the reason “Because their objects are different” (cited by *Bhāvivikta* in *Text* 1307) is Inconclusive, by reason of its presence in a thing where the Probandum is definitely known to be absent:—[*see verse 1311 above*]

‘*Etasmin*’ stands for the Reason cited—“Because their objects are different The Cognition of the Middle Term ‘Smoke’ is the cause of the cognition of the Major Term ‘Fire’,—even though the objects of the two cognitions are different. The same may be the case here (with the non-conceptual and the conceptual). So that the Reason adduced is Inconclusive.—(1311)
