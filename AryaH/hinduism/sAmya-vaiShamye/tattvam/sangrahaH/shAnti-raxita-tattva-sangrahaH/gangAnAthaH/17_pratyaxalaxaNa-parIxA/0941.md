> Among the cognitions of colour, sound, etc., mutual causal relation is actually present; hence the instance that has been cited is one in which the probandum is not known to exist.—(1310)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that the Corroborative Instance (cited by *Bhāvivikta*, in 1307 above) “as in the case of the cognition of Colour, etc.”, is devoid of the Probandum (the character sought to be proved):—[*see verse 1310 above*]

As among the Cognitions of Colour, Sound, etc., mental causal relation is actually present,—consisting in the fact of their following in the wake of one another.—(1310)
