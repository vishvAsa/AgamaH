> If the category named ‘annihilation’ were affirmed in reference to a thing, there being nothing actually produced in the thing,—how is it that the thing ceases (to exist)?—(381)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text asserts that it must be understood that when ‘annihilation’ is spoken of in regard to ang, it is only the *negation* of the nature of theng itself, and there is no *affirmation* of anything—[*see verse 381 above*]

If it were not as declared by us, and if the category of ‘annihilation’ were regarded as *affirmed* in reference to theng,—then, as there is nothing actually produced in the thing concerned,—why should that thing cease to exist?—(381)
