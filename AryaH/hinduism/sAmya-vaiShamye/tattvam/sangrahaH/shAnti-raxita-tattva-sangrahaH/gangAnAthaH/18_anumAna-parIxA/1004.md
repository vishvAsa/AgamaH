> The blooming and the rest, when produced, are produced at the same time as, and from the same particular causes as, the said (moon-rise, etc.).

## Kamalaśīla

That this is so has to be admitted; because if the Probans were to lead to the inference of things without some such relationship, then they might lead to the inference of anything and everything; because the *absence of relationship* would be equally present in all things. Hence in the cases in question also, some sort of relationship has to be pointed out; and this relationship can only be one of Cause and Effect as just explained.—(1422-1423)
