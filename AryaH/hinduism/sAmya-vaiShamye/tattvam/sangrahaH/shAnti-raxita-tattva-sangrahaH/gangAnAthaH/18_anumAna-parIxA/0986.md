## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Text*, the author proceeds to point out defects in the examples cited (by *Pātrasvāmin*, in Texts 1371 to 1378):—[*see verse 1390 above*]

As regards the Probans that has been put forward, in the form—‘Because it is somehow apprehended’,—this is absolutely futile; as its object is not open to doubt; that is, it asserts what is already known; and what is already known cannot bo the objective of the Probans; it is only a doubtful matter that, is dealt with by the Probans; because ‘a Reason is stated only in reference to what is doubtful’.—What too is known only in an isolated form cannot be the substratum of the Probans; as the Probandum would be already known (under the definition propounded by *Pātrasvāmm*).—(1390)
