> Here also, there is a clear corroborative instance per dissimilarity; that same form of the things becomes the thing where the probandum is known to be absent,—in the proving of the character of ‘being somehow existent’ in regard to non-entities,—there would be ‘proving of what is already admitted’; also ‘inadmissibility’, and the concomitance of the contrary character in that way.—(1404-1405)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued that—“there being nothing *where the Probandum is known to be absent*, there can be no Corroborative Instance *per dissimilarity*”.—The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verses 1404-1405 above*]

That form in which the Jar, etc. are apprehended,—if their existence in that form is accepted by them, then, in that case, that same character would also serve as the *Instance per dissimilarity*; because in that character, the Probans—‘being unapprehended’—will have ceased to exist.

Similarly in the case of the argument regarding things being ‘somehow existent’, the defect of ‘futility’ would be present.

‘*Nirātmasu*’—i.e. in non-entities.

‘*Concomitance of the contrary character*’;—i.e. the ‘contrary character’,—in the shape of the *cessation of the Probandum*—would be pervaded by (concomitant with) the *absence of the Probans*.

‘*In that way*’—i.e. by the possibility of the Instance *per dissimilarity*.—(1404-1405)
