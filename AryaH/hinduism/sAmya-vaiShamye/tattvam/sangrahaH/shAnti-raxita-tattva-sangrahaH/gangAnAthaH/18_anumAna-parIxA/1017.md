> As a matter of fact, it is only by connected assertions that an idea is expressed; hence for the purpose of bringing about this connection, it is not necessary to state the final conclusion separately.—(1441)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Aviddhakarṇa* has argued as follows:—“A single idea cannot be expressed by diverse isolated assertions; hence for bringing about the connection between these assertions it is necessary to state the Final Conclusion”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1441 above*]

When the fact of the Probans being connected with the Probandum by the relation of *sameness* or by that of *Cause and Effect* has been established,—then the statement of its presence in the Subject and its invariable concomitance (with the Probandum) as connected together, bring about, by implication, the single Idea, in the shape of the desired Conclusion. Even though the statements are isolated, yet they are connected, and as such together lead to the desired end. Consequently it is not necessary to state the Final Conclusion for the purpose of bringing about the said connection.—(1441)
