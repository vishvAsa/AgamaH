> The inference for the sake of others has been described by others as ‘the statement of the proposition and the rest’.—But, not being an integral part of proof (‘proving’), the proposition is of no use.—(1430)



## Kamalaśīla

*Objection*:—“It has been asserted under *Text* 1363 that—‘*Inference for the sake of others* consists in the statement of the three-featured Probans’.—Why has this been so asserted, when other people have described *the Inference for the sake of others* as consisting of the statement of the ‘Proposition’, ‘Final Conclusion’ and ‘Re-affirmation’ also?”

This is what is anticipated and answered in the following—[*see verse 1430 above*]

The author rejects the said view of other people, in the words—‘*But, not*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Sādhana*’, ‘*Proof*’, (here) stands for the *proving*; i.e. the cognition of the object to be cognised the Proposition is not an ‘*integral part*’—i.e. the cause—of the *proving*; this is what is meant by the compound ‘*asādhanāṅgabhūtam*’.

*Not being an integral part of the proving*, the Proposition is of no use, and hence need not be stated.

‘*Of no use*’ may he explained as *not a cause*; in which case, the phrase would form part of the conclusion set forth here (which would be that the Proposition is *not a cause* of the proving).—(1430)
