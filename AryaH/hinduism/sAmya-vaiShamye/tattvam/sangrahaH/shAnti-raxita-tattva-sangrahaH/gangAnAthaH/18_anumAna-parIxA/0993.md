> If what is meant to be proved (asserted in the conclusion) is that between the two (the pain and the insect) there is the relation of cause and effect,—which has been forgotten,—then the probans would be ‘three-featured’, as there would be a corroborative instance provided by previous experience.—(1399)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged “If the epithet *falling* is not introduced, and the Probans (Premiss) is stated in the general form ‘because its appearance is felt’,—then the Premiss cannot be a part of the Conclusion.”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1398-1399 above*]

The qualification must be there; otherwise the Premiss would be falsified by reference to the Pain caused by other insects.—(1398)

It might be urged that “what is meant to be proved is the relation of Cause and Effect—for the benefit of one who has forgotten it,—then, in that case, the Probans would become ‘three-featured’, as the Corroborative Instance would be provided by such well-known cases as that of *Smoke and Fire*.—(1399)
