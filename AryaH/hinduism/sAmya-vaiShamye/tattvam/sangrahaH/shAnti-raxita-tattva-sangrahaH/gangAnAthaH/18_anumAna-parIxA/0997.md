> In proving that the jar and other things are “somehow nonexistent”,—the probans is found as, in a previous case, to be ‘futile’ and also ‘inadmissible’.—(1403)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Text* now takes up the argument put forward (by *Pātrasvāmin*) under *Text* 1375, to the effect that “the Soul and the Jar are somehow nonexistent, etc. etc”.:—[*see verse 1403 above*]

Here also, there would be proving what is already admitted; as the fact of the Jar, etc. being ‘somehow non-existent’ is already admitted.

In case it is not admitted, then the Probans also, in the form ‘because it is not apprehended’, cannot be admitted; so that the Probans becomes ‘Inadmissible’.

In this way, the defect in the Probans may be pointed out,—just as it was in connection with the argument seeking to prove that the things in question are *existent*.—(1403)
