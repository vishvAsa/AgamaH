> If it were understood to be general, then, what would be indicated would be the existence of the probans in the object where the probandum is present; and it would not accomplish what is sought to be accomplished.—(1381)



## Kamalaśīla

The mere fact of its *not existing apart from the Probandum*,—without the other fact of its existing wherever the Probandum is known to exist,—does not make ‘visibility’—[which *does not exist apart from the Probandum, Non-eternality*; but is not present in *all* cases where Non-eternality is present],—does not prove the *Non-eternality* of *Sound,*.—Hence the first alternative cannot be right.

‘*It would not accomplish, etc*. *etc*.’—that is, it could not establish the desired conclusion regarding the presence of the Probandum in the object.—(1381)

*Question*:—“Why so?”

*Answer*;—[*see verses 1382-1383 next*]
