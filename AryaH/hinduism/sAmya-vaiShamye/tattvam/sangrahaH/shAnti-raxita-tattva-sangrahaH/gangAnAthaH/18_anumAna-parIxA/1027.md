> When the inference is spoken of as ‘brought about by the three-featured indicative’, what is meant to be indicated is that it is compatible (with the real state of things); and this same (compatibility) is what characterises the valid cognition; why then is it denied?—(1468)



## Kamalaśīla

First of all, the author points out the ‘contradictory’ character of the Probans in the first argument propounded in *Text* 1457—viz.: “Because it is brought about by the three-featured Indicative”,—‘*What is meant is that it is compatible*, *etc. etc*.’;—that is, what is meant to be indicated is that it is compatible; the sense being that, because the cognition that proceeds from the Three-featured Indicative is indirectly appurtenant to the thing concerned, it is not *incompatible*, just like Sense-perception, as has been asserted in the following statement—‘Inasmuch as the Probans and the Probandum are indirectly appurtenant to the Thing, and are entirely free from any wrong notions regarding it, there can be nothing deceitful about it.’

‘*This same*’;—i.e. *compatibility*; as has been thus declared—The cognition that is *not* *incompatible* is right (or valid) In the case of Sense-perception also,—even for one who admits its validity—there is nothing that can be pointed out as determining its *validity*,—except this *absence of incompatibility*; and this same condition is present in the case of the cognition proceeding from the *three-featured Indicative*; why then is the validity of the cognition brought about by the Three-featured Indicative sought to be denied, on the ground of its being brought about by the Three-featured Indicative?

What is indicated by this is the incongruity between the Probandum and the Probans (as put forward by the Opponent (in 1457), For instance, where there is the character of *being brought about by the three-featured Indicative*, there is *absence of incompatibility*;—and where there is *absence of incompatibility*, there is *validity*; *and’validity* and *invalidity* are mutually exclusive,—the incompatibility consisting in the fact that where the one is present the other cannot be present and where the one is absent, the other is present; so that by implication the Probans put forward by the Opponent is ‘*Contradictory*—(1468)
