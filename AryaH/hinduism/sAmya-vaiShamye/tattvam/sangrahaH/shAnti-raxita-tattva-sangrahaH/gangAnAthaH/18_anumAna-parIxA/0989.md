> Otherwise, it cannot be admitted that ‘it is somehow apprehended’.—If it is usage that is sought to be proved,—then something well known should form the corroborative instance.—(1394)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Otherwise*’,—i.e. if what has been just said is not admitted, then—the Probans—in the form ‘because it is somehow apprehended’—cannot be admitted.

Previous to this the defect pointed out in the statement of the other party was that it was *futile*; it is now pointed out that it is *inadmissible*.

If it is Usage that is meant to be proved,—then the Corroborative Instance could be found in the case where the use had been made; and in this case, the Probans would become ‘three-featured’. Otherwise, if there were no Corroborative Instance, the Usage also could not be known.—(1394)
