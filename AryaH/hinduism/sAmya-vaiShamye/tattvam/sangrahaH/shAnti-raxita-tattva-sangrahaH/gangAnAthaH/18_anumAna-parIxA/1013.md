## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Though the statement of the Proposition is not made at the time that one actually propounds the Premiss, yet if the said distinction is made in regard to the matter under dispute,—i.e. the Subject—there is nothing incongruous in it.—Nor can it be urged that “at the time of the propounding of the Premiss (Reason, Probans), there is *no matter under dispute*”;—because, even *for the other party*,—i.e. for one who makes the statement of the Proposition,—the disputant does not put forward his Premiss, *all of a sudden*,—without reference to some subject under consideration.—(1436)
