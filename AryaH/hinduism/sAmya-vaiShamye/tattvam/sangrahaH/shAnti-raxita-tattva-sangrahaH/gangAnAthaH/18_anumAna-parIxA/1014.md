> The character of residing in the minor term (subject) follows its presence in the subject whose character is meant to be ascertained; and the ‘*sapakṣa*’ is that which is similar to that subject; and the ‘*vipakṣa*’ is that where the said character is absent.—(1437)

The question arises still—“The object whose particular character one wishes to ascertain may be the subject under consideration; even so how can the said distinction be made in reference to that subject under consideration?”

The answer is provided in the following—[*see verse 1438 above*]

This is easily understood.—(1437)

The ‘*Upanaya*’, ‘Reaffirmation’ (as one of the five Members of the Syllogism) has been defined as that which, on the strength of the Corroborative Instance, reasserts the Subject as being so, or as being *not so*’—(*Nyāya*-*sūtra* 1. l. 38).—‘This Re-affirmation is not the *means of proving* the conclusion, as it only serves to make clear the sense of the Probans adduced, being, as it is, like a second affirmation of the Probans’—such is the authoritative statement of *Diṅnāga* in regard to this Re-affirmation.—But *Bhāvivikta* and others have argued as follows, in order to show that (without this Reaffirmation) the function of the Probans itself would remain unfulfilled:—“The fact of the Probans subsisting in the thing where the Probandum is known to be present is not made clear by the *statement of the Probans*, which comes just-after the statement of the Proposition; because the former only mentions the Reason—‘Sound is non-eternal, *because it is a product*’;—and whether this character of ‘being a product’ subsists, or does not subsist, in Sound, this is learnt only from the *Reaffirmation*.—Or the *Reaffirmation* may be regarded as serving the purpose of providing *Re-presentment*; when the Probans is stated at firsts it points out the presence of the Probans—e.g. ‘being a product’—in a general, unqualified, form;—then the Corroborative Instance is cited, where it is shown that the said Probans is invariably concomitant with the Probandum;—so that when, after these, the *Reaffirmation* is stated, it brings about the *Representment* of the Probans with the qualification that it is *invariably concomitant with the Probandum*,—‘Bo is Sound a product’, Thus inasmuch as it indicates a particular feature, it is not a mere repetition”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1438-1439 next*]
