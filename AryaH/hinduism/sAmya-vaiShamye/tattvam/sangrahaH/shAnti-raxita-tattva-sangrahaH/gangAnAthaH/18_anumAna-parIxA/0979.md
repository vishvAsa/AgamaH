## Kamalaśīla

The proposed definition of the Probans is that (it is ‘otherwise impossible’, which means that) *it should not exist apart from the Probandum*;—(1) now is this meant to be general (applicable to *all* Probans)? Or is it meant to be applicable to any particular object? and in the latter case, (2) is it meant to be in reference to a particular object in which the existence or otherwise of the Probandum is sought to he known? Or (3) in reference to that object which forms the Corroborative Instance.—These are the alternatives possible.—(1380)
