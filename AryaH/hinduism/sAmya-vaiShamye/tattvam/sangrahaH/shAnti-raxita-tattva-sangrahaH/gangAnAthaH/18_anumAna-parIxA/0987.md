> That the positive entity is essentially existent is known to all persons; then how is it said that it is known ‘somehow’?—(1391)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be urged that—“here also what forms the object of the Probans is what is open to doubt”.—The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1391 above*]

When all persons somehow know it for certain that the Positive Entity is existent, why do you state your Proposition in the form ‘The Positive Entity is *somehow existent*’?—

‘*Tadātmatvam*’—being essentially existent.

The mention of the ‘Positive Entity’ is only by way of illustration; the *Negative Entity* is also meant.

‘*Somehow*’—i.e. in the form of ‘being cognisable’,—it is known for certain that all this is *existent*; hence the Probans is absolutely futile.—(1391)
