> “That alone is the true probans which has the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’; as for corroborative instances, they may be there, or they may not; as they are not the means. if the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is not there, what is the use of the ‘three features? And if the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is there, what is the use of the ‘three features’?”—(1368-1369)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Corroborative Instances*’,—in the form *similarity* and *dissimilarity*.

‘*They are not the Means*’—of proving the Probandum.

It would be better to read the second line of 1369 before the first line.—(1368-1369).
