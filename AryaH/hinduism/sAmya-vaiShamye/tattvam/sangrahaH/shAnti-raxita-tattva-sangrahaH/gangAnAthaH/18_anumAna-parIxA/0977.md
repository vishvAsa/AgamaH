## Kamalaśīla

In the following Texts, it is shown, by a number of examples, that it is only the ‘one-featured’ Probans that has the requisite capacity (of leading to a valid conclusion):—[*see verse 1371 above*]

The Reasoning is in the form ‘Positive and Negative entities are somehow *existent*, because they are apprehensible somehow’,—In this case there are no external corroborative Instances, either of similarity or dissimilarity, either in the form of a statement or in the form of actual things; because all things have been included under the Subject (Minor Term) ‘Positive and Negative entities’; and there is nothing apart from these. As regards the character of ‘being present in the Minor Term’, this is ‘otherwise impossible’, and is nothing apart from this latter; hence the Probans here is ‘one-featured

‘*Somehow*’,—under some such term as ‘Cognisable’ or its synonyms.

‘*Are essentially existent*’,—‘somehow’ has to be construed with this also.—Hence the full Reasoning is—‘Because they are *somehow apprehensible*, therefore they are somehow existent’.—(1371)
