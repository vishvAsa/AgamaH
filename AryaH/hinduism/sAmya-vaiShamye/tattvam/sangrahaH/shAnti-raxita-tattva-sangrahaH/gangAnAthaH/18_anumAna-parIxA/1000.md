> In that house wherein the father had been found before,—and also in that wherein he had not been found before,—there is the concomitance, positive and negative, clearly perceived,—as regards the word, it does not make known any external object at all; because in this case, the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is not present; the word can only be the indicator of the ‘speaker’s wish’ (to speak of a certain thing). If this (speaker’s wish) were meant to be what is expressed by the word, then its difference is quite clear. Because when the ‘speaker’s wish’ is not there, the word cannot be used.—As regards the lamp, it does not make the blue and other things known by becoming the indicative (inferential); all that it does is to make things capable of being cognised; and it is only in this sense that it is called a ‘means of cognition only in case the word were an inferential indicative, would it be necessary to consider if it fulfils the conditions of being present in the subject (minor term.) and so forth. Otherwise, why cannot the same be urged in connection with the eye and other organs (as means of cognition)?—Even through the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’, visibility cannot prove anything, unless it is present in the subject (minor term).—Thus ‘one-featured’ probans are all impotent.—In those that have been cited as ‘one-featured’ probans, the presence of two features becomes clearly indicated; and in those that have been cited as ‘two-featured’, the presence of three features becomes clearly indicated; because every probans must reside in the subject (which therefore is an additional condition that must be fulfilled).—If it be argued that “this feature is implied by the character of being otherwise impossible”,—that cannot be so; because in the case of sound, though visibility may be otherwise desired, it is not present in sound (which is the subject).—(1408-1415)



## Kamalaśīla

In the case of Words, the *character of being otherwise impossible* cannot be admissible,—in reference to *external things*; because it cannot serve as an Inferential Indicative of these latter,—being, as it is, dependent entirely upon the Speaker’s wish.—If the said character is asserted in the case of words, in reference to the object that figures in the cognition (brought about by the words),—then, there are all the *three* features present, as in the case of *Smoke* (indicating the Fire). Because, if the Speaker’s wish is not there, words cannot be used, the use must be regarded as the effect of that wish; and as such it is *indicative* of the thing spoken of, just as the Smoke is of Fire; and this is accepted by us; but not as being *expressive* of the thing.

As regards the *Lamp*, it is not admitted to be even the *Indicator* like Smoke; all that is admitted is that it has come to be popularly regarded as the Indicator (making things known) by reason of its making the Jar, etc. (objects cognised) capable of bringing about the cognition; but the words are not inferential Indicatives; hence any discussion as to the Indicative subsisting in the Subject cannot arise in this case. If it did arise in this case, then why could not the same discussion arise in the case of the Eye and the rest (which are the means of Sense-perception, not *Inferential* Indicatives)?

‘*Otherwise, etc. etc*.’;—this sums up the subject-matter under consideration. The sense is that, even though *Visibility* is invariably concomitant with *non-eternality*, it does not prove this *non-eternality* in *Sound*.

Thus then, inasmuch as in all cases, the condition of *subsisting in the Subject* must be present,—by admitting this as a necessary condition, those Probans that have been cited as ‘one-featured’, must, necessarily, become ‘two-featured’,—and those cited as ‘two-featured’ must become ‘three-featured Thus, on account of the necessity of *subsistence in the Subject*, it is the *one-featured* Probans that are really impotent.

It cannot be right to argue that—“such characters as *subsisting in the Subject* are all implied by that of ‘being otherwise impossible’, and hence they cannot form so many different independent characteristics of the Probans”—because the other party has himself asserted that there is the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’, even when *subsistence in the Subject* is not there, in the following passage—“Through the character of *being otherwise impossible* the Lamp and other things are actually indicative of things, *even though they do not reside in the subject (Text* 1378, above)”.

In the case of *Visibility*,—even though ‘non-eternality’ is ‘otherwise impossible’,—visibility does not subsist in the Subject. So that in every way what has been asserted is entirely doubtful.—(1408-1415)
