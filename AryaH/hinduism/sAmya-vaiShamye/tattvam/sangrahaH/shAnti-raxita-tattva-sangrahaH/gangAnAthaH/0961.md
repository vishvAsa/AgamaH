> When the compact fibre of the wood is rent asunder by the cut of the axe, the axe is (popularly) called the ‘cut’ only when it enters into the fibre; and it is in this way that there is sameness (between the axe and the cut).—(1348)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

When the cutting of the Trees with the Axe comes to be examined, it is found that the *cut* consists in the entering of the Axe into the wood-fibre; and this *entrance* is a property belonging to the Axe itself; so that in tins sense there is sameness between the Axe and the Out; and there is no incongruity in this.—(1348)

The same idea is further elucidated:—[*see verse 1349 next*]
