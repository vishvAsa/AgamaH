> The great sage is like the *kalpa*-tree, unshaken by the winds of desires; and yet he brings about the welfare of men. Even though he has no cognitions, all men regard the blessed Jina (Buddha) to be omniscient; because by reason of the absence of limitations, he knows all things, without exception,—as is clear from what he does (for the welfare of people).—(2049-2050)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“If the Blessed Lord does not apprehend anything, how can He be omniscient?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2049-2050 above*]

‘*Adarśanam*’—He who has no cognition.

By the force of his previous Meditations, the Lord has no limitations;

He is like the *Kalpa-tree*, bringing about the welfare of the entire Universe; that is why people regard Him as ‘Omniscient,’—not because He has cognitions; in fact, no other character can be attributed to Him.—(2049-2050)
