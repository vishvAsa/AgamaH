> If the said cognition of the apprehension is not cognised, then the preceding one remains uncognised. If of that also, yet another cognition were postulated, then there would be an infinite regress.—(2025)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be granted that it does become cognised,—only if there were no infinite regress; as it is however, the idea involves an unavoidable infinite regress.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 2025 above*]

‘*Tasya*’—stands for the second cognition of the apprehension of the Object,.

‘*Preceding one*’—i.e. the apprehension of the Object.

‘*Remains uncognised*’—i.e. remains as something of which there has been no cognition.—(2025)
