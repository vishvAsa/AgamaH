> The apprehension of the object is called ‘cognition’ itself; if then, there is no perception of the cognition, how can there be perception of the other?—(2022)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“If the Cognition is not perceptible, why should the apprehension of the Object also cease to be perceptible? Certainly the imperceptibility of Colour does not make Sound also imperceptible”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2022 above*]

We cannot find any other form (or character) of the Cognition, apart from Apprehension. And so long as we cannot find any such, if we were to carry on any business, we would be deceiving ourselves and also others.

If the *Cognition* is uncognised, what other cognition could there be of the *apprehension of the object*? None whatsoever.—(2022)
