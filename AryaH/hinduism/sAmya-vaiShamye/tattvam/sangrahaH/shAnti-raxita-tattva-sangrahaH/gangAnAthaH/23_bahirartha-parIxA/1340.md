> How can the cognition envisaging (having the form of) one object apprehend another object? If it did so, everything would be apprehended by every cognition; and there would be no basis for restriction.—(2040)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* proceeds to deal with the third alternative view (suggested in *Text* 1999)—that “Cognition envisages something else”:—[*see verse 2040 above*]

It might be urged that—“when a Cognition is produced by a certain Object, it apprehends only that Object, and thus every Object could not be apprehended by every Cognition

The answer to this is—‘*There would be no basis for restriction*’; that is, even the Eye, etc. would become ‘apprehended’.—(2040)

The following *Text* presents *Bhadanta-Śubhagupta’s* answer to the above—[*see verse 2041 next*]
