## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Another defect in the Opponent’s view is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 2039 above*]

‘*Character of Non-cognition*’—i.e. being of the nature of the unconscious.

‘*Etcetera*’—is meant to include *negation of attachment*, *negation of hatred* and so forth.—(2039)
