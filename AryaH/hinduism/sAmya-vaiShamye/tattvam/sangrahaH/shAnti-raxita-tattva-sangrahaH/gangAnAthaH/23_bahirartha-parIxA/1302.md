> If the perception, entirely by its own function, did not bring about the recognition (of the impartite atoms),—then, how could these be regarded as ‘amenable to perception’?—That things are momentary is ascertained by means of proofs; but how are the atoms cognised as ‘white’, ‘yellow’ and the rest?—It might be said that—“the first visible thing must be an aggregate of minute (invisible) things,—because it is gross,—like the hill and such things;—there is this inference (which proves our assertion)”.—The answer to this is that grossness is not admitted to be present in the two things; the composite is not gross, nor are the atoms so.—If what has been spoken of as such (gross) is the well-known form that is found extended in space,—even so, as such form appears in illusory cognition also, there would always be doubt.—If the answer be that—“illusory cognition is wrong, hence what is cognised is not admitted to be so”,—then the answer is that, unless a distinction is established, what would be the difference between this and that?—If it is compatibility with effective action,—and this is said to consist in compatibility with the cognition envisaging that effective action,—then such compatibility is possible. Otherwise also; on account of the capacity for action being restricted,—(1973-1979)



## Kamalaśīla

What is meant by the emphasising particle ‘*eva*’, ‘entirely is the fact of there being no dependence upon the Inferential Indicative or the Reliable Word. What is meant is that, even though Perception comes about, it does so, in an unspecified (indeterminate) form; and yet that factor alone is regarded as ‘Perceived’ for practical purposes in regard to which it produces a *Re-cognition* of the form actually apprehended; while that factor with regard to which it does not produce this *Re-cognition* is as good as not-apprehended, even though it might be apprehended. Hence our Reason cannot be regarded as ‘inadmissible Specially because what is meant by the clause ‘*Pratyayāprativedanāt*’ (in *Text* 1968) is that ‘it does not figure in that cognition which is meant to be Perception, and which is put forward as the Reason in the Minor Premiss.’

It has been argued (in *Text* 1972) that—“the idea of *grossness* is a mental illusion”.—That is not right; because if the Atom, had been established by suitable proof, then alone could the idea of *grossness* be regarded as *wrong* or illusory;—as it is only when the momentary character of things has been established by suitable proof, that the idea of *permanence* is regarded as *wrong*. As a matter of fact however, the Atoms have not yet been established; as they form the subject of the present investigation.

Further, this ‘illusion of grossness’ cannot be said to be ‘mental’,—as it appears quite clearly; while what is confined to mere Conceptual Thought can never be clear; because the generic form is always *indistinct*; and without the generic form, there can be no Conceptual Thought.

The following might be urged:—“Like the *non-eternality* of things, Atoms also are actually established by suitable proofs. For instance, whatever is *gross* is only of the nature of the aggregate of minute things,—as for example, the Hill and other things;—and the first visually perceived object is *gross*;—hence this is a Reason based on the nature of things. The qualification ‘visually’ has been added for the purpose of excluding the ‘Atomic Diad’ (which is not *visually* perceived).”

The answer to this is as follows:—In the premiss ‘because it is gross’,—if it is *real* ‘grossness’, as a property of the thing, that is put forward as the Probans (Reason),—then such ‘grossness’ is *not admitted* by your disputant (the Buddhist) either in the *Probandum* or in the Corroborative Instance; and in that case the Probans is ‘inadmissible’ and the Corroborative Instance is ‘devoid of the Probandum’.

If, on the other hand, the ‘grossness’ meant is that which appears as extended in space, which cannot stand the test of investigation, and which is well-known to all common people, down to the veriest cowherd,—then, even in the ease of illusory cognition like Dream, such ‘gross form’ actually figures in Consciousness, even though there is no ‘aggregate of Atoms’ at the time; and hence your Probans becomes ‘Inconclusive’.

If, in order to avoid tins difficulty, you add the qualification ‘there being no illusion’,—then, so far as the Idealist is concerned, so long as the difference, between the visual cognition produced under normal conditions on the one hand and the cognition produced during dreams on the other, is not established,—there is no Cognition that can be accepted as being ‘free from illusion’; hence the qualification also becomes ‘inadmissible

The following might be urged:—“Between the normal healthy visual cognition and the Dream-cognition, the difference is quite clear—in that while the former is compatible with effective action, the latter is not”.

The answer to this is—What is this ‘compatibility with effective action?’—If it is *the reaching of the external object*,—then, that is not yet established; in fact, it is for the establishing of the *external* *object* that the Reason has been put forward.—If, on the? other hand, ‘compatibility with effective action’ be held to consist in *the Cognition envisaging* *the* *desired* *effective* *action*,—then, *otherwise also*,—i.e. even without the *external* *object*,—such compatibility would be possible; so that the Reason adduced is clearly ‘Inconclusive’.

*Question*:—“How would it be possible *otherwise*?”

*Answer*:—‘*On account of the capacity for action being restricted*,’;—i.e. because the capacity of the cause, consisting in the immediately preceding Cognition, is restricted; that is, a certain preceding Cognition is capable of bringing about only a particular Cognition; all are not able to produce all; for example, your own ‘External Object’; which also proves that there is restriction in the capacity of things.—(1973-1979)
