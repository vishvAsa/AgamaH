> “As a matter of fact, people have such notions as ‘I do not remember if any object was apprehended by me at the time’, which shows that they remember the appearance of the apprehending cognition, without any idea of the apprehended object. If the two were non-different, there would be remembrance of the apprehended object also, when there is remembrance of the apprehending cognition;—as a matter of fact however, there is idea of the apprehending cognition only. Thus the difference between the two becomes proved by positive and negative concomitance.—thus all these reasons become established as residing in the minor term.”—[*Ślokavārtika-śūnyavāda*, 83-85].—(2071-2073)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—How are the second and subsequent Reasons (urged under *Texts* 2065 *et*. *seq*.) proved and *admissible*?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2071-2073 above*]

The Remembrance of the Apprehending Cognition is found to appear even without the remembrance of the Apprehended Object;—if there were absolute non-difference between the two, then there would be remembrance of the Apprehended Object also,—just as there is, of the Apprehending Cognition;—hence as they do not share the same fate, the Apprehended Object and the Apprehending Cognition must be different from one another.

It might be urged that—‘there *is* remembrance of the Apprehended Object also’,—The answer to that is—‘*As a matter of fact, however, etc*. *etc*.’.

‘*Tatra*’—At the time that there is Remembrance of the Apprehending Cognition.—‘*Eṣa eva*’,—i.e. the Apprehending Cognition alone,—not the Apprehended Object. The particle ‘*eva*’ is misplaced.

‘*By positive and negative concomitance*’—as between the presence and absence of the Remembrances of the Apprehended Object and the Apprehending Cognition; as there is *absence* of the Remembrance of the Apprehended Object even when there is *presence* of the Remembrance of the Apprehending Cognition.—(2071-2073)
