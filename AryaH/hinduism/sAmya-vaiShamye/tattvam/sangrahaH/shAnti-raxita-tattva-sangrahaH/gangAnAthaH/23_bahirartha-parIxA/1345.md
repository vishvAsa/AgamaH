> If he had the cognition of the love and hate, etc. in other persons,—this could arise only from similarity to such love, etc.; and this would imply the presence of ‘obscuration’,—under the view of the ‘apprehensionist’.—(2048)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent:—“Even though the External Object does not exist, which could be apprehended,—yet another Cognition is there, in another ‘Chain’; why cannot this be apprehended by the Cognition of the Blessed Lord?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2048 above*]

If there is apprehension of the Love, etc. occurring in other ‘Chains’,—that could be due only to similarity, not otherwise; as if it were otherwise, there would be incongruities.—As regards this Similarity (between the Lord’s Cognition and the Love, etc. in another person), if it is similarity on all points, then the Lord’s Cognition should be tainted with the same Love, etc.;—and in that case, the Afflictions and Obscurations would not have ceased in Him; and there could be possibility of Obscuration.

‘*Aupalambhika-darśane*’—under the view—opinion—of those who proceed on the basis of Cognitions alone,—i.e. the Apprehensionists, the Idealists.—Or it may be interpreted as ‘under the Apprehensionist or Idealistic, view of the Lord’.

If, on the other hand, the said *similarity* is only *partial*,—even so, as the two forms would not have ceased, the obscuration of the apprehended object would be there; as it would be tainted with the form of what is apprehended. Because a duality of form in any single object cannot be *real*; so that the said Cognition would have to be regarded as *wrong*, mistaken; and thus, as the seed of wrong-cognition, in the shape of Defect, would not have entirely ceased, the Blessed Lord would come to be one whose obscuration has not ceased *entirely*.—(2048)
