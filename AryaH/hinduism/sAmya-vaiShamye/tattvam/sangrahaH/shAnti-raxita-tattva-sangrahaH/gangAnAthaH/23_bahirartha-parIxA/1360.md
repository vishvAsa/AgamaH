## Kamalaśīla

Having set forth the original formal argument above (in the Commentary introducing *Text* 1965 on p. 550, *Line* 13) in the words—‘Every Cognition is devoid of both, *apprehended* and *apprehender*, because it is Cognition,—like the Cognition of the Reflection’;—and having so far established the invariable concomitance between the Probans and the Probandum in this reasoning, the Author sums up the whole position in the following:—[*see verse 2079 above*]

What is meant by the epithet ‘under dispute’ is that the subject of the Reasoning is the Cognition of persons with healthy eyes, etc.,—not *all* Cognitions;—while what is put forward as fche Probans—‘because it is Cognition’,—is Cognition *in general*; thus it is bhat the Probans is not part of the Proposition. ‘*Being devoid of Objective and Active Agent*’ qualifies ‘*without a second*’; that is, what is meant by its being ‘without a second’ is that it is ‘without Objective and Active Agent’; and not that no ‘second’ exists at all.

‘*Like the Reflection*’—The *Object* being spoken of as the *Cognition*, the term ‘Reflection’ stands for the *Cognition of the Reflection*,—Or the ‘Vati’ affix, in ‘*pratibimbavat*’ may be taken as coming after the Locative ending; then, as the Receptacle (denoted by the Locative), the *Cognition* itself becomes indicated.

The Probans cannot be regarded as ‘inadmissible’; because what is put forward is that character of the Cognition which consists in the ‘exclusion of other things’,—and not the very nature of ‘Cognition’.

Nor is the Probans ‘Contradictory’; because it is present wherever the Probandum is known to be present.—(2079)
