> “The fact of the appearance of the blue and other forms being produced by something of the same kind is sought to be proved by its being the form of the cognition which is in conformity with the reality,—like the consciousness.”—(2052)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be said—“In that case, it could be proved by *Inference*”, And in support of this idea, *Bhadanta -Śubhagupta* has formulated the argument as follows:—“The form in which the Cognition appears,—if it is in conformity with the real state of things,—must be produced by some other Object of that same form,—like the apprehending form;—and the ‘form of Cognition’ in question envisaging the Blue and other forms, appearing in the man with underanged sense-organs, is compatible with the real state of things; hence this is a Reason in accordance with the real state of the thing concerned.”

This is the argument presented in the following:—[*see verse 2052 above*]

‘*Samvāditvena*’;—The Instrumental ending indicates the characteristic feature of the Cognition; the sense being—that *form of the cognition* which is in conformity with reality,—by *that* is proved the fact of the form of the Cognition being produced by some other thing of the same kind;—like Consciousness; i.e. like the form of the *Apprehender*.—(2052)

The following texts point out the defects in this argument:—[*see verses 2053-2054 next*]
