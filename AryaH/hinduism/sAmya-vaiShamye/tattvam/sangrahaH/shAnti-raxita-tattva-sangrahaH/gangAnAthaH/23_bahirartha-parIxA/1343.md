> Or, it may be that the cognition is spoken of as ‘apprehending the non-objective form’,—through mistake, because in reality it does not apprehend it at all, for the simple reason that it has no object. If you also speak through illusion of the cognition apprehending such a thing,—then it becomes clearly non-objective.—(2045-2046)



## Kamalaśīla

The opponent says—“That same false cognition would be the basis of the figurative use of the name to the Apprehension of the unreal form”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verses 2045-2046 above*]

‘*Tat*’—i.e. the Cognition that is spoken of as envisaging the *non-objective* form.

In reality, there is no *non-objective form* at all which could be apprehended; because if it were admitted to be apprehensible in the positive form, then it would have to be regarded as *objective*.—(2045-2046)
