> There can be no such complaint as—“whose apprehension would it be?”—in fact, apprehension is the very nature of the cognition; just as ‘satisfaction’ is of pleasure.—(2011)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be asked:—“If there were no Object to be *apprehended*, whose apprehension would be there?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2011 above*]

It is the nature or essence of the Cognition itself that is called ‘apprehension’,—by reason of its being of the nature of Light;—just as—‘Satisfaction’ is of Pleasure; when one speaks of ‘the *satisfaction* of Pleasure’, the mere fact of the two being mentioned separately does not make the *Satisfaction* something different from *Pleasure*.—Similarly, though there are such expressions as ‘apprehension of Blue’, ‘apprehension of Yellow’, and so forth,—where the two appear to be different,—yet, it is the very nature of the Cognition that it appears in the form of *Blue*, etc., and hence it is spoken of in the said manner; and the reason for this lies in the fact that Cognition is by its nature *self-cognisant*.—(2011)

*Question*:—“What is this ‘Self-cognition’ that is spoken of?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2012 next*]
