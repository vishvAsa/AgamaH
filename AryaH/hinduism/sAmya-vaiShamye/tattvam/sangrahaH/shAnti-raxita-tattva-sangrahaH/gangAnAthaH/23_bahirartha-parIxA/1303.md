> “Atoms having two forms, similar (common) and dissimilar (uncommon),—when the common form is the thing apprehended, then the uncommon form is not apprehended; such being the case, what is it that is not possible?—In fact, all things exist in two forms, the ‘universal’ and the ‘particular’; hence atoms are declared to have two forms—the common and the uncommon. Of these, it is the common form that is amenable to sense-cognition, hence it is only in reference to atoms that there can be cognition of only one form. That form of the atoms which is uncommon is held to be amenable to mystic perception—such are the confounded assumptions of some dull-witted persons.—(1980-1983)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *texts* urge the defect of ‘inadmissibility’ in the Probans adduced by the Buddhist,—‘because it is not recognised in consciousness’,—from the view-point of *Sumati*, the *Digambara* (Jaina):—[*see verses 1980-1983 above*]

*Sumati* has argued as follows:—All things have two aspects—the Universal and. the Particular; consequently Atoms exist in two forms—the *common* and the *uncommon*; of these, it is the Common form that is apprehended by the Senses, not the uncommon form. In this way there is nothing incongruous in there being one uniform Cognition apprehending all Atoms; and thus it is by Perception that Atoms become established.

‘*Confounded*’—indefinite; in as much as it implies no one definite form.—(1980-1983)
