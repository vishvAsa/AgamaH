> Whether with form or formless, it does not apprehend anything else; hence in regard to the Buddha’s cognition, the questions do not arise.—(2047)



## Kamalaśīla

The same writer (*Bhadanta-Śubhagupta*) says again:—“With reference to the Buddha’s Cognition also, the same questions arise—Is it *with form* or *formless*? Is it produced at the same time or at different times? That is to say, just as the point is discussed that the Cognition *with form* cannot apprehend the Object,—why is not a similar point raised in regard to the apprehension of the Object of the Blessed Lord’s Cognition?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2047 above*]

The Cognition of the Blessed Lord is not regarded as the apprehender of the Object; hence the question is not raised in regard to that. As a matter of fact, in His case, all obscuration having disappeared,—that there should be no question regarding the Apprehender and Apprehended, is exactly what is right.—(2047)
