> “The cognition of the form of the apprehended (object) is spoken of as ‘connected with external space’, and as appearing without the cognition of the apprehender (cognition).”—(2070)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Text*, the Opponent urges that the Reasons are well-known and ‘admissible’:—[*see verse 2070 above*]

“As a matter of fact, ‘the External Object is directly perceived as having a shape and as connected with external space’—as asserted by *Śabara*, the author of the *Bhāṣya* (on Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra 1.1.5),—where it has been explained that there is Cognition of the Apprehended Object, even when there is no Cognition of the Apprehending Cognition. Hence the Reason ‘Because it is not apprehended on the apprehension of the other’ becomes established and hence ‘admissible’.”—(2070)
