> “(*a*) That which is the apprehender of colour must be different from what is apprehended,—because the cognition of the one does not appear on the cognition of the other as in the case of the apprehender of taste, etc.—(*b*) What is apprehended must be different from the apprehender; because one who thinks of the one does not necessarily think of the other;—as in the case of the apprehender of taste, etc.,—(*c*) For the same reason the two must, thus, be concluded to be different from one another, like taste, etc.,—(*d*) The two must be different, because they are never cognised as being of the same form,—like the cognition occurring in another ‘chain’.—(*e*) the cognition cannot apprehend any portion of itself; because it proceeds from the cognition;—like its own potency.—(*f*) There should be denial also of ‘apprehensibility’ (of the cognition by itself);—because the impression is devoid of the duplicate character.—(*g*) Caitra’s cognition cannot bring about the apprehension of the apprehensible part of the cognition arising out of his cognition;—because it is cognition;—just as the cognition appearing in another person.”—[*Ślokavārtika-śūnyavāda*, 172-177]—(2064-2068)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *texts* set forth a series of arguments put forward by *Kumārila*:—[*see verses 2064-2068 above*]

“(*a*) The Cognition that apprehends Colour must be different in form from what is *apprehended*;—because when there is Cognition of the Colour, there is no Cognition of the Cognition; just as the Apprehender of Taste.—Or (*b*) what is apprehended,—i.e. Colour, etc.,—must be different from its Apprehender; because when a man thinks of the one, he does not think of the other;—just as in the case of the apprehender of taste, etc.—Or (*c*) the two—the Colour and its Apprehender—must be different from one another, because there is no thought of the one while the other is thought of,—just like Taste and Colour, etc.—Or (*d*) the two must be regarded as different, because they are never recognised as being of the same form,—like the Cognition appearing in another ‘Chain’.—Or (*e*) the Cognition cannot apprehend a portion of itself,—because it is produced from the Cognition itself; like its own Potency;—this ‘Potency’ is what is known as ‘Impression’.—(*f*) Similarly, there should be denial of the ‘apprehensibility’ of Cognition, which is done in this form:—The portion of Cognition cannot be apprehended by the Cognition itself, because it has come out of the Cognition”.

*Question*:—In between these two arguments where is the Corroborative Instance endowed with the character of the Probandum?

*Answer* “*Because the Impression is devoid of the duplicate character*;—*i.e*. the character of the *Apprehended* and the character of the *Apprehender*.

(*g*) Or, there is another argument—This Cognition in question cannot bring about the apprehension of the portion of Cognition produced in one’s Cognition,—because it is Cognition,—just as the Cognition appearing in other persons—*Maitra* and the rest,—does not apprehend the portion arising out of *Caitra’s* Cognition.—(2064-2068)

The refutation of the above is set forth in the following:—[*see verse 2069 next*]
