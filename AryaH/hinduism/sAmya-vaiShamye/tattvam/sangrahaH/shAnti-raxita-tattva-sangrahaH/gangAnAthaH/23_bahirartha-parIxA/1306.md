> This cannot be right; because there is cognition of the nonentity also;—e.g. that of the yellowness of the conch-shell. of ‘difference’ too there is no other characteristic except the presence of contradictory properties.—(1988)



## Kamalaśīla

If it be as asserted, then no Cognition could be wrong; and there would be an end to all notions of ‘difference’.

It might be possible to characterise that Cognition as ‘wrong’ which is subsequently sublated. But even so, when the idea of ‘many’ in reference to what is *one* is sublated, how could it be *not-wrong*?

Thus it is found that the existence of Atoms cannot be proved either by Perception or by Inference; consequently the proposition denying the external world does not involve the contradiction of any fact of perception. Nor is the Reason adduced by us ‘inadmissible’.—(1988)
