> It means that for the cognition of its own form, the cognition does not need any other thing; and yet it is not uncognised;—this is what is meant by ‘self-cognition—(2012)

## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2012*]:

The following text raises an objection to the statement just made—from the view-point of kumārila:—[*see verse 2013 above*]

[*verse 2013*]:

This is how *Kumārila* argues—“Though Cognition is of the nature of Light, yet for its own manifestation, it needs something else; and it does not *touch*—apprehend—itself; as it is wholly taken up in the manifesting (apprehending) of the object; and when it is engaged in one thing, it cannot operate over another thing, without abandoning the former.”—(2013)
