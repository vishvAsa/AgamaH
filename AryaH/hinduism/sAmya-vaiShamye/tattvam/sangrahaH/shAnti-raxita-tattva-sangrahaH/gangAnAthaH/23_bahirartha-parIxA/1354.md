> Because the two are never cognised separately, as explained before,—therefore all the reasons adduced (by Kumārila); down to the ‘non-cognition of sameness’, should be rejected as ‘inadmissible’.—(2069)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Because the two are never cognised separately*’;—i.e. because the *Blue* and its *Cognition* are always found together; because for the man who has no apprehension of Cognition, there can be no perception of the Object;—all this has been explained before in course of the proof of Cognition being self-cognised;—where the non-difference between the Blue and its Cognition has been established;—because of this, all the Reasons adduced above (by *Kumārila*) down to the ‘non-cognition of sameness’ cannot be ‘admissible’.—(2069)
