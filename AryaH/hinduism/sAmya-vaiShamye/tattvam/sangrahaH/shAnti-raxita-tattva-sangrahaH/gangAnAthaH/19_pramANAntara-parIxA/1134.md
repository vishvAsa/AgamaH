Though the Specific Individualities being all momentary, there can be concomitance or continuity of them, yet there are some Specific Individualities which are so constituted that, either directly or indirectly, they become the cause of an illusory conception of *sameness*; and hence becoming conceived as the *same*, they become *expressive*, through Convention;—‘*Like Shaking*’—i.e. just as *Shaking* ‘is expressive’,—(1636)
