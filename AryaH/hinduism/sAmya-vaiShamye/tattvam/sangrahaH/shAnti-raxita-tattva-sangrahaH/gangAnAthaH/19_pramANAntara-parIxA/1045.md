> Thus the verbal cognition is not-inference—because it is devoid of the three features;—like sense-perception;—as is shown by the absence of an object like that.”—(1498)



## Kamalaśīla

Recapitulating the arguments, the Opponent formulates his case as follows:—[*see verse 1498 above*]

“The Proposition of his Reasoning is—‘The Verbal Cognition is *not-Inference*;’—‘because it is devoid of the three features’ is the *statement of the Probans* (Minor Premiss);—‘*like Sense-perception*’ is the Corroborative Instance.—And ‘as is shown by the absence of an object like that’ is said in support of the Minor Premiss; what is meant by this is that the object of the Inference brought about by the Inferential Indicative like *Smoke* is the *Subject* as endowed with the particular property (Probandum),—and any such object is absent in the case of Verbal Cognition.”—(1498)
