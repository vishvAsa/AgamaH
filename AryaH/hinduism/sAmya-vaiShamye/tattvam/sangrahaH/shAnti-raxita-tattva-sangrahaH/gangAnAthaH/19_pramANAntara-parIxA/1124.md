> That there is fatness when there is eating is known with certainty through positive and negative concomitance; and hence the cognition of one thing follows from the other which is thus related to it.—(1624)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The relation of *Cause* and *Effect* between *Fatness* and *Eating*—as between *Fire* and *Smoke*,—is known with certainty; whereby it is right that there should be cognition of one thing—i.e. *the* *Eating*—(which is the Cause) from another thing—i.e. the Fatness, which is related to the former as its effect. But it cannot be right that the cognition of one sentence should proceed from another sentence which is not so related to it; as if there were such cognition, then there would be incongruities.—(1624)
