> Thus then, in cases where the other party have denied the presence of the three features,—we do not regard the verbal statement to be a means of cognition.—In cases, however, where the presence of the three features is admitted by them, the fact of its being ‘three-featured’ is quite clear.—Where the ‘desire to speak’ is to be proved, it has been shown that the three features are present.—Such being the case, the word is as good a means of inference as the smoke,—because it is equipped with the three features, and because its objective is of that same kind.—(1523-1525)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Thus then, in cases*, *etc*. etc.’—This means that, when the other party puts forward the reason ‘because it is devoid of the Three Features’ as against the idea of Verbal Cognition being inferential, in the sense of being something external,—his argument is superfluous; (as we also do not admit that).

‘*In cases however, etc. etc*.’—This shows that the reason put forward by the other party *is inadmissible*, if it is urged against the inference of the *Desire to Speak*; because in regard to that, it has been shown, that all the *three* features are clearly present.—(1523-1525)
