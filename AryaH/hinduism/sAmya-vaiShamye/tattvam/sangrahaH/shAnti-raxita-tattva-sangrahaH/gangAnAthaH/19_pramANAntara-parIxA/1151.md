> If what is meant by ‘non-modification’ is only the absence of modification,—then, as the entity concerned is eternal, this should be understood to be there at all times, as it never ceases.—(1661)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“*Non-modification* is not of the nature of ‘something contrary to *modification*’, it is only of the nature of the ‘absence of modification’; so that the definition cannot *he impossible*”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1661 above*]

‘*Tatpratikṣepamātrātmā*’—‘*Tat*’ is *modification*;—‘*Pratikṣepa*’ is denial, absence;—‘*mātra*’ is *only*;—that which has this absence of modification for its essence.

‘*This*’—i.e. the ‘non-modification’ in the form of ‘absence of modifications’—should be always of one and the same form; as there can be no modification of the Soul.—(1661)
