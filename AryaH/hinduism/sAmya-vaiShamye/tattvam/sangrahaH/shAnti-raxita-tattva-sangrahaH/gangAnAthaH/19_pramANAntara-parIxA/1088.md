## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“There has been no previous idea of the relation of the *Name* at all; hence the Reason ‘because it apprehends what is already apprehended’ is *not admissible*”.

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1566 above*]

If the cognition of the relation of the Name had not been there, then there could have been no such cognition, later on, as that ‘this is the *Gavaya* whose *name* I had heard before’.—(1566)

A further argument to the same effect is stated:—[*see verse 1567 next*]
