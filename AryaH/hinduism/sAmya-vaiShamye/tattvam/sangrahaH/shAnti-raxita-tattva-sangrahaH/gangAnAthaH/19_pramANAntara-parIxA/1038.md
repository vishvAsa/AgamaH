> The reply to this is as follows:—in fact, there cannot be any form of cognition except the two (already described); because all the others that have been postulated either do not possess the character of the ‘form of right cognition’, or are included in these two.—(1488)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Included in these*’,—i.e. in the two Forms of Cognition already described.

What is meant is as follows:—The characteristic of *Valid Knowledge* is that it should be in conformity with the real state of things; and this is not present at all in any of the others that have been postulated; every case where this characteristic is present, is included in the said two, and hence the others have not been described separately.—(1488)
