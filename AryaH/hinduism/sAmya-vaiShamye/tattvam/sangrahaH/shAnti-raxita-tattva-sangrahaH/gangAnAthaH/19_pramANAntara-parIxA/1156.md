> The ‘negation of the effect’ consists in the presence of the cause; and this latter is of a nature distinct from the other, and is apprehended by perception itself.—(1671)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* supports the same idea of Negation being included under Perception:—[*see verse 1671 above*]

It has been declared (by *Kumārila* himself, see *Text* 1655 above) that ‘The Negation of the effect consists in the presence of the Cause’; and this ‘presence of the Cause’ is of a nature—character—distinct from the Effect; and it is apprehended by Perception itself; so that what other aspect of ‘Negation’ is left to be cognised, for the sake of which Negation would be a distinct Means of Cognition

This argument may be formulated as follows:—When one Means of Cognition has no cognisable object other than that of another Means of Cognition, then it cannot be a distinct Means of Cognition;—e.g. a *seventh* Means of Cognition,—‘Negation’ has no cognisable object apart from what is cognised by Perception; hence the assumption of such a distinct Means of Cognition would be failing in the fulfilment of the wider condition.—(1671.)

The Opponent urges the ‘inadmissibility’ of the Reason adduced in this argument—[*see verses 1672-1673 next*]
