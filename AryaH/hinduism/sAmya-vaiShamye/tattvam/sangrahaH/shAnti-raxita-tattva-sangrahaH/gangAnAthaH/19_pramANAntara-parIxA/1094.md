## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“What would be the incongruity if the Word (Name) were applied to the Specific Individuality?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1574 above*]

In course of our examination of the Denotation of Words, the idea that Words and Conceptual Contents envisage Specific Individualities, has been rejected in detail. Hence what is expressed by the name must be the conceptually imposed thing.—(1574)
