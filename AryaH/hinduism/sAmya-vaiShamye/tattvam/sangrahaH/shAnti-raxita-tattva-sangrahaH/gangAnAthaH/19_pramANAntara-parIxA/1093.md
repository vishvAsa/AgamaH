> When a man has recognised a certain name as applying to the man with the wonderful armlet, he does not, at another time, recognise it as applying to the man with the beautiful diadem.—For these reasons, when a man has come to know of a name as applying to a certain conceptual image recognised as something external, and called the ‘universal’,—then, even if he comes to perceive the oavaya, he must recognise it as applying to the gavaya itself; and it is only one who is ignorant of the distinction between the ‘perceptible’ and the ‘conceptual’ that regards it as ‘external—(1571-1573)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Aṅgada*’ is an ornament called ‘*Kaṭaka*’, Armlet.

‘*Cītrāṅgada*’—is the man who is wearing a ‘*citra*’—wonderful—‘*aṅgada*’—armlet.

When the man with the wonderful armlet has been once spoken of as ‘Devadatta’ (by name)—in the statement ‘*The man with the wonderful armlet* is Devadatta’,—and one, on hearing this, has cognised the name as belonging to that person,—he does not, at any future time, recognise that *expression* ‘man with the wonderful bracelet’ as applying to *Yajñadatta*, who is a ‘man with the beautiful *diadem*’.

‘*Kirīṭa*’ is *diadem*;—‘*Cārukirīṭa*’ is the man with the beautiful diadem. For the above reasons, in order to avoid the likelihood of the incongruity, when a Name has been recognised by a determinate cognition envisaging an external object, as applicable to a conceptually imposed object,—then, if he comes to perceive the *Gavaya*, he recognises that name as applied to that same conceptually imposed object,—and not to the external Specific Individuality of the name of ‘*Gavaya*’; and the same conceptual Image is what is spoken of as the ‘Universal—And this is purely imaginary, as it has been discarded above.

*Question*:—“How then is there the idea of the external Specific Individuality?”

*Answer*:—‘*It is only one*, *etc. etc*.’—(1571-1573)
