> As a matter of fact, the apprehension of cognition through something else is not possible in anyway,—either (a) through the inferential indicative,—or (b) through another cognition (perception),—or (c) through presumption.—There being a possibility of objections being raised against all these three, there would be several infinite regresses creeping in for you.—[It must be admitted therefore that] as among things equally capable of being apprehended, the apprehension of one leads to the definite cognition that the others are non-existent.—(1684-1686)

> “What is that one, thing on the cognition whereof the sky is cognised as moon-less? How too is the absence of all sound cognised anywhere?”—(1687)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verses 1684-1686*]:

\(1\) Some people hold that Cognition is cognisable through the Inferential Indicative;—this Inferential Indicative being either in the form of the idea of a thing, or in that of an Action, or in that of a thing perceptible by the senses, or some manifest object, and so forth.

\(2\) Others hold that Cognition is *perceived* through another Cognition,—and not self-cognised,—because the operation of anything upon itself involves an incongruity.

\(3\) Others again hold that it is cognised through Presumption based upon the inexplicability (otherwise) of what is duly known; i.e. the idea of a thing being *known* would be inexplicable if the Cognition of the thing were not there, the Cognition itself being by its nature *dull* (non-intelligent, dark).

Thus these three theories have been put forward.

Now there being a possibility of objections being brought up against each of these three theories—relating to the Inferential Indicative and the rest,—such as—‘How is the Inferential Indicative itself known?’, and so forth, —*there will be several Infinite Regresses creeping in*:—For instance, the Inferential Indicative and the rest could not be cognised until Cognition is cognised; hence its cognition should be sought for from somewhere else;—and for that also, it would be necessary to have *recourse* to another Inferential Indicative and so forth. This same process being urged against each of the three theories,—there would be an endless Infinite Regress.

From all this, the right conclusion would be that the apprehension of one tiring brings about the Cognition of the non-existence of other things.—When one has to deny the time and place of things, the negation (denial) is made of the perceptible *things* themselves, as it is these latter that stand on the same footing as the *thing* that has been apprehended; it being impossible to deny anything else. If *sameness* were denied, then all would be denied,—as has been seen before; because all things become included under ‘what is not—that thing—which is apprehended’,—according to the principle that ‘what is not the same as one thing is another thing—(1684—1686)

[*verse 1687*]:

*Question*:—

[Says the Opponent]—“When a man notices the absence of the Moon in the *Ākāśa*, there is no apprehension of any *one* thing, by virtue of which it could be said that from the apprehension of that one thing follows the apprehension of *the non-existence of other things*; specially as there is no such real thing as *Ākāśa* which could he apprehended as devoid of the Moon. Even that *Ākāśa* which others have postulated as something *real* is beyond the reach of the senses.—Then again, when at a certain place the *absence of sound* is noticed,—from the apprehension of what *one* thing does that follow?—It cannot be urged that it follows from the apprehension of the spot on the ground concerned; because the ground is not equal to the Sound as regards its perceptibility,—because the ground is visible, while the Sound is *audible*; and what are meant to be mutually related in the present context are things that stand on the same footing regarding their perceptibility.—This is clear from the assertion that ‘one thing is *other* than the other when both are related to the same cognition and yet are not dependent upon one another—Nor can the cognition in question be said to proceed from the apprehension of *Time*; because there is no such category as ‘Time’ apart from the other categories, whose apprehension could be there. The *Time* that is accepted by the other party is also something beyond the senses—(1687)

The answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verses 1688-1989 next*]
