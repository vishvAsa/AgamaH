> ‘What sort of an animal is the *gavaya*?’—on being thus questioned by people living in the city, the forester makes the statement ‘as the cow so is the *gavaya*’; it is this that is known as *upamāna* (analogy).—according to Śabara’s view however, this is not outside the scope of ‘word’ (verbal statement), hence it has been described in another way.—[*Ślokavārtika-Upamāna*, 1-2.]—(1526-1527)



## Kamalaśīla

With regard to Analogical Cognition, the Author declares as follows:—[*see verses 1526-1527 above*]

On being asked—‘What sort of an animal is the *Gavaya*?’—The man makes the statement—‘the *Gavaya* is like the Cow’; it is this Verbal Statement that is known as ‘*Upamāna*’, ‘Analogy’, among the older *Naiyāyīkas* [e.g. *Vātsyāyana*, in his *Nyāyabhāṣya* on Sū. 1. 1. 6].

According to *Śabara’s* view, as stated in his Bhāṣya (on ML Sū. 1. 1. 5), the cognition brought about by the said statement would be included under ‘Verbal Cognition’, and hence the Means of such a Cognition could not be regarded as a distinct Means of Cognition (apart from the *Word*); with this in view Analogy has been described by him in a different manner; he says—‘*Upamāna*—that is, Similitude,—also brings about the cognition of things not in contact with the senses; for instance, the sight of the *Gavaya* brings about the remembrance of the Cow’.[^1]—(1526-1527)

[^1]:  On the exact meaning of this passage in the Śabarabhāṣya, there is a difference of opinion among the Mīmāṃsakas themselves. According to the Ṛjuvimalā, the meaning of the words of the Bhāṣya is that “the sight of the Gavaya brings about the Analogical Cognition, that the animal seen is called ‘Gavaya’, to the man who, on seeing the Gavaya, has remembered the Cow”.—This is the same as the view of Vātsyāyana, which has been controverted in the Ślokavārtika, the meaning according to which has been adopted in the translation above.

This (Śabara’s) view the author proceeds to expound in the following—[*see verses 1528-1530 next*]
