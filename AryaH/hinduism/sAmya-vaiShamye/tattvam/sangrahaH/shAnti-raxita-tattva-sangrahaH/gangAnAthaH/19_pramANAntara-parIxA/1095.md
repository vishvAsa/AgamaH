> Even if they were envisaged by words and conceptual contents,—the resultant cognition would only be inference. that it proceeds from the ‘three-featured indicative’ is thus deduced—‘this animal, which is similar to the cow, is one to which the name *gavaya* is applicable,—just like the *gavaya* which was present in the mind at the time when the relevant convention became known’.—(1575-1576)



## Kamalaśīla

We grant—for the sake of argument—that Words and Conceptual Contents envisage Specific Individualities. Even so, the Cognition in question becomes included under *Inference*; and Analogical Cognition cannot be a distinct form of Cognition.

*Question*:—“How can it be included under Inference when it is not brought about by the three-featured Indicative?”

*Answer*—‘*That it proceeds, etc. etc*.’:—‘Similarity to the Cow’ is the Probans; ‘being one to which the name *Gavaya* is applicable’ is the Probandum; and ‘the *Gavaya* present in the Mind, in the shape of the Reflected Conceptual Content, at the time that the Convention became known’ is the Corroborative Instance;—and the *Gavaya* perceived at the time is the Subject, the Minor Term.—(1575-1576)
