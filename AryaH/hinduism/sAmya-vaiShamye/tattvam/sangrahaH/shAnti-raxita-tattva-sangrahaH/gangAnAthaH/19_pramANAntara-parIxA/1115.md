> If it be urged that—“the potency is not something absolutely different (from the thing),—it is of a dual character, being both (different and non-different)”,—then (the answer is that) it cannot be so, because of self-contradiction. and further, its non-difference (from the thing) would be cognised by perception.—(1614)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 1613*]:

Fire, as apart from Water and other things, is clearly perceived as capable of *burning*; what then is the use of the said ‘Potency’?—(1613)

[*verse 1614*]:

The following might be urged:—“The objection urged would apply if we held that the Potency is something absolutely different from the Thing; as a matter of fact, however, we regard it to be of a dual character, being both different and non-different”.

This cannot be right.—“Why?”—*Because of self-contradiction*;—if it, is *different*, how could it be *non-different* at the same time? If it is *non-different*, how could it be *different*? There is clear self-contradiction if two mutually exclusive properties—the presence of one of which must mean the absence of the other and *vice versa*,—are attributed to the same thing.—In fact, *being another* consists in *not being the same*, as is found in the case of ‘another self’,

Granting that the Potency has the dual character,—even so, that Potency of the dual character is cognisable by Perception itself; because the *non*-*difference* of the Potency from the Thing is also cognised by Perception,—and not *absolute difference* only; whereby it would not be perceptible. Under the circumstances, the statement that ‘Potency is always cognisable from the effect’ would become set aside.—(1614)
