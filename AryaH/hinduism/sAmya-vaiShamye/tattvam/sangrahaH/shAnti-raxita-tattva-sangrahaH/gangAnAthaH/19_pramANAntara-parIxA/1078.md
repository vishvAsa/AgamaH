> Or, similarity may be an entity, residing in the cow, like the commonalty (or universal); even so, it will have been perceived in the cow standing before the person before he sees the co-relative (*gavaya*); and as such the cognition of the said similarity following upon the seeing of the *gavaya* cannot escape from being of the nature of remembrance.—[says the other party]—“What has been previously seen in the cow is similarity merely existing there, and it has not been definitely ascertained that it is similarity to the *gavaya*; while this latter is what is apprehended by analogical cognition, which, thus, is different from remembrance.”—(1551-1553)



## Kamalaśīla

Taking for granted that *Similarity* is an entity, the Author proceeds to show that, even according to the view of the *Mīmāṃsaka*, Analogical Cognition cannot be valid:—[*see verses 1551-1553 above*]

There may be a real entity in the shape of *Similarity*; and it may be residing in everything in its entirety.—But even so, when, before seeing the *Gavaya*, the man sees the Cow standing before him, he naturally sees the Similarity which is inseparable from the Cow; otherwise the inseparability of the two could not be there.—And thus, as the subsequent Analogical Cognition would be apprehending only what has been already apprehended, it would not be a form of valid Cognition.

The following argument might be urged:—“The Similarity seen previously was merely as *existing*, it was not seen in the form that ‘this is the similarity between this *Gavaya* and the Cow’; while this is the form in which the Similarity is apprehended by Analogical Cognition; so that it cannot be regarded as being of the nature of Remembrance”.—(1551-1553)

The answer to this last argument is provided in the following:—[*see verse 1554 next*]
