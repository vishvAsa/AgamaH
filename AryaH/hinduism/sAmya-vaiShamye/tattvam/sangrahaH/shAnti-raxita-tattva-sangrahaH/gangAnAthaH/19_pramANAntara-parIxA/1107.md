> “As a matter of fact, the idea of the night (and the man eating at night) cannot be derived from the sentence speaking of the day (and the man not eating); because what is expressed by the words of the latter has no connection with eating at night. Nor is there any contradistinction whereby the latter could indicate the eating at night.—Nor can a second (and totally different) meaning be attributed to the words (speaking of the day); because these are already taken up in expressing another idea.—From all this it follows that the idea in question (of eating at night) is derived from a totally different sentence present only in the mind of the person.—Thus then, this sentence (in the mind), though it is not actually verbally expressed, is yet duly cognised,—and it has to be pointed out which one among the means of cognition, perception and the rest, it is which brings about the cognition of the said (unspoken) sentence.—As the sentence is not actually spoken, it could not be perception; nor could it be inference, because the sentence has never been found to be concomitant with the other factor; and if, even when this relation (of concomitance) has never been perceived, the factor concerned were regarded as an inferential indicative,—then the utterance of any one sentence might bring about the cognition of all sentences; because on the point of being unrelated, there would be no distinction between one sentence and another.”—(1593-1598)—[*Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti*, 56-61.]



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—‘The idea that the Man eats at night is derived from the said words—*He is corpulent and eats not during the day* themselves [so that it is only a case of *Verbal Cognition*].’

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1593-1598 above*]

There are two kinds of meaning possible in a sentence—in the form of (*a*) Connection and (*b*) Contradistinction; of these ‘Connection’ consists in the unification or commingling of things expressed by the words like *Milk and Water*, and ‘Contradistinction’ consists in these things expressed standing in the relation of *excluder* and *excluded*;—or ‘Connection’ consists in the well-known relation of *cause and affect*,—and ‘Contradistinction’ in the *exclusion of the unlike*.—In neither of these two forms could the (unspoken) sentence ‘He eats at night’ be the meaning of the (spoken) sentence ‘He eats not in the day For instance, the words of the sentence ‘He eats not in the day’ denote the *Day* and so forth; and these have no ‘Connection’ with *eating at night*; as the two are entirely different. Nor is there ‘Contradistinction’ between them; because the word ‘day’ is never used in the sense of the *negation of non-night*.

It might be argued that—“*That he eats at night* is another meaning of the same sentence ‘He eats not in the day’.”

The answer to this is—‘*Nor can a second meaning*, *etc. etc*.’—There can be no assumption of another meaning for the same sentence,—as it is entirely taken up in expressing the idea of the *man not eating in the day* and hence cannot express the other idea that *he eats at night*, Consequently the idea of *the man eating at night* must be expressed by another sentence.

‘*Present in the mind*’—This shows that the cognition is not *Verbal*.

‘*Though it is not verbally expressed*’,—i.e. even though it is not *Verbal*, due to words; as in the manner shown above, it cannot be *verbal cognition*.

For the cognition, then, of the sentence—‘He eats at night’—which is understood (in the Mind), some ‘Means’ will have to be pointed out; which could only be one out of Perception and the rest.—And yet it cannot be any of these. Hence it must be an entirely distinct Means of Cognition,—This is what is meant.

The idea of the required Means being one from among Perception and the rest is next refuted—‘*As the sentence*, *etc. etc*.’—The sentence expressing the idea of the man *eating at night*, not being actually spoken, cannot be of the nature of Perception, because it is not *heard*. Nor can it be of the nature of Inference, because there is no relation (of concomitance). For instance, the sentence expressing the fact of *eating at night* has never been perceived in association with the sentence speaking of *not-eating in the day*,—which fact alone could constitute the relation of concomitance between the two. Nor is there any other Inferential Indicative available.

It might be argued that, “even without the perception of any relation, it could be regarded as an Inferential Indicative”.

The answer to that is—‘*And if, even when. etc. etc*.’—That is to say, if it could be an Inferential Indicative even when it is not known to be related, then from the utterance of the sentence speaking of the man *not-eating in the day*, there should follow the cognition of *all* sentences,—not only of the sentence speaking of *eating at night*.—Why?—Because, as regards *being devoid of relation*, the sentence speaking of *eating at night* does not differ from any other sentence; that is, in the point of being *not-related*, all sentences stand on the same footing,—(1593-1598)
