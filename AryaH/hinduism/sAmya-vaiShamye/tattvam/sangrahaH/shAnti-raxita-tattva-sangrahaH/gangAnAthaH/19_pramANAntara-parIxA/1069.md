> “Similarity having been apprehended by sense-perception,—and the cow haying been remembered,—the two together (i.e. the cow qualified by similarity) are not cognisable by any other means of cognition; hence herein lies the functioning of analogy as a means of cognition.”—(1536)



## Kamalaśīla

*Objection*:—‘*Similarity* is cognised by Sense-perception,—the Cow also becomes the object of Remembrance;—what then is left to be known,—apprehending which, Analogy would become the Means of Cognition’?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1536 above*]

Though the similarity has become cognised by Sense-perception, and the Cow also has been *remembered*, yet, the cognition of *the Cow as qualified by the Similarity* has not been cognised by any other Sense-perception or Remembrance. Hence in the bringing about of this Cognition lies the operation of Analogy as a *Means of Cognition*.—(1536)

An example is cited, to illustrate this:—[*see verse 1537 next*]
