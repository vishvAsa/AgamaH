> “The fact of similarity being an entity cannot be denied; because it actually exists in the form of the presence in a thing of one kind of several parts similar to those in that of another kind.”—[*Ślokavārtika-upamāna*, 18.]—(1533)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“If *similarity* were an entity by itself, then it could be perceived; as a matter of fact, however, it is not admitted that it is an entity by itself”.

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1533 above*]

As a matter of fact, *Similarity* is a relationship in the shape of the Inherence, in a particular individual, of many parts—in the shape of the Homs and others, as existing in the Cow,—in the particular Individual, the *Gavaya*;—and a Relationship is not something entirely different from the Relatives; for, if it were, then there might be the possibility of there being no cognition of the Relationship at all.

The qualifying term is ‘in a thing of another kind’, because the presence of all common features in things of the same kind is not regarded as *similarity*.—(1533)
