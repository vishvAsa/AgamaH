> [Under the circumstances] the ‘non-existence’ should be said to be of only that perception which envisages the perceptible object,—not of others; as that would be false.—How too is it known that the cognition of the other thing has come about, when cognitions themselves are not perceptible? If it is known through presumption, that too is of the nature of cognition,—how then is it itself cognised? If another presumption is suggested, then there is an infinite regress.—If the ‘negation of cognition’ is an entity, the ‘negation of the cognised object’ also should be the same. under the circumstances why do you not include ‘negation’ under ‘perception’ itself?—(1667-1670)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Śakyadarśana*’ is that thing the Perception of which is possible, i.e. what is *perceptible*. ‘*Ābhā*’ is form, figure;—hence what is meant is that Perception which envisages the perceptible thing.

‘*Not of others*’—i.e. of Inference and the rest; because what is cognised through these is *imperceptible*; and the absence of these is not followed by the absence or negation of things removed in time, place and nature; so that the absence or negation of these would be false (if brought forward as bringing about the *Negation* of these things). Hence there would be no sense in adding the term ‘and the rest’ in the phrase ‘negation of Perception *and the rest*

Further, if ‘the cognition of a thing other than that’ were definite and certain,—then it must be admitted that it proves the absence of the counter-entity. Otherwise, if the Negation were proved as merely *existing*, then it would mean that the negation in question has become cognised by all men, through the said ‘cognition of the other thing’ appearing in any one person only. In that case, how could the *Mīmāṃsaka*, who regards Cognition as imperceptible, become cognisant of that ‘Cognition of another thing’?—He would never be able to cognise it.

‘*If through Presumption*’;—‘if it is cognised’—this has to be construed here, from the Context;—as has been asserted in the statement—‘As there can be no idea of the object that is not cognised, the cognition of the thing is inferred from the inferential indicative in the shape of the Idea of the thing’;—here the term ‘inferential indicative’ stands for *Presumption*;—and ‘*cognition of the thing*’ means that cognition which can be explained otherwise than on the basis of the said Presumption;—‘*inferred*’ stands for *definitely cognised*.

In that case, as this Presumption also would be a Cognition,—it has to be explained how it is itself cognised.

If the answer be that “it is cognised through another Presumption”,—then, there would be an infinite regress.

Then again, if the idea of Negation being an *entity* is admitted, then, just as the ‘negation of the Means of Cognition’ is an entity, the ‘negation of the object cognised’ also should be an entity; and in that ease, being an *entity*, why cannot Negation be regarded as cognised through Perception itself? In that case there would be no need for postulating a distinct Means of Cognition for the Cognition of Negation.—(1667-1670)
