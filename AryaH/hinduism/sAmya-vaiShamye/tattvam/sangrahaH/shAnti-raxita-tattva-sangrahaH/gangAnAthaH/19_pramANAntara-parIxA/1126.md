> When there is no relationship—or when, even though existent, the relationship is not definitely known,—if the other sentence were indicated, it would be unreliable (invalid),—(1626)



## Kamalaśīla

The idea really is that there *is* a relationship between the two sentences.—But if, at any time, there is no relationship between one sentence and another, or if existent, it is not definitely known, and hence is as good as non-existent,—if, when the relationship is not definitely known, if the second sentence were indicated,—such indication would be invalid; that is, it would be a baseless cognition; and if baseless cognitions were admitted, then the incongruity of everything being indicated by everything would be inevitable.—(1626)
