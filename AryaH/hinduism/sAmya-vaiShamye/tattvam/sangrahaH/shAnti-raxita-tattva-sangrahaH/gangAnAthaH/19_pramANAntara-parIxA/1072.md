> “The similarity residing in the cow cannot serve as the probans, as it forms a part of the proposition itself. the *gavaya* also cannot serve as the probans indicative of the cow, as it has no connection with the cow.”—(1541)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the *Opponent*:—After the *Gavaya* has been perceived, the similarity residing in the Cow becomes apprehended, and then that *similarity* will serve as the required Probans.

The Answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1541 above*]

Inasmuch as Similarity is the object Inferred, it cannot serve as the Probans.

“In that case, the *Gavaya* would be the Probans”.

Here also, the *Gavaya* cannot serve as the Probans, for want of coordination.—(1541)
