> If it be urged that—“that person is regarded as trustworthy in regard to imperceptible things, whose assertions are found to be true in most cases”,—then (the answer is that) the mere fact of one’s assertion being not true in some individual case, cannot prove that his assertions are never true; nor can the fact of its being true in one case prove that all his assertions are true.—(1511-1512)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“Even though a man may not be entirely free from defects, yet if it has been found that in most cases his assertions are true, then such a person is regarded by us as ‘trustworthy’,—and not any person ‘free from defects’;—and it is the assertion of such a ‘trust-worthy’ person that is meant in the definition of *Verbal Cognition* (provided by us). Hence the definition is not open to the charge of being ‘Impossible’.”.

This cannot be right; because one assertion of the man has been found to be not incompatible with the real state of things, it does not necessarily follow that *all* his assertions are true; because it is always possible that some assertion may be untrue. If it were not so, then the definition would be false.—(1511-1512)
