## Kamalaśīla

Though it is true that the said cognition apprehending the *similarity* follows after the Remembrance (of the Cow), yet, because as residing in the

*Gavaya*, it would be in proximity (to the senses), the similarity would be within reach of the senses.

‘*Sannidhi*’ stands for *the character of being in proximity*.

‘*Gavayasthatvāt*’—is the reason for its being regarded as *in proximity*; the sense being that—*because* the similarity resides in the *Gavaya*, therefore it is in proximity to the senses.—(1531)
