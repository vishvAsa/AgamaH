> “These several kinds (of negation) could not appertain to a non-entity; hence negation must be regarded as an entity; for instance, the ‘negation’ of the effect consists in the ‘presence’ of the cause—[*Ślokavārtika*-negation, 8].—(1655)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—‘Even if there is this fourfold division, how does that make Negation an *entity*?’

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1655 above*]

There can be no division of a *Non-entity*; as division always rests in entities.—Hence *Negation* must be an *entity*.

“What sort of an *entity* can it be?”

*Answer*:—‘*The Negation of the Effect*, *etc. etc*.’—The *Presence* of the Cause—Milk, for instance—is what constitutes the *Negation* of the Effect—Curd; and the Presence of the Effect—Curd—is what constitutes the Negation of the Cause—Milk, It is in this way that Negation is an *entity*.—(1655)
