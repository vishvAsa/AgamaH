> If the second kind of ‘negation’ were admitted, then, when the ‘cognition of some other thing’ would come about, there would be ‘negation’ of everything else,—even that which is not perceptible.—(1665)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* points out the defect in the second definition of *Negation* (put forward under *Text* 1649);—[*see verse 1665 above*]

‘*Even that, etc. etc*.’—i.e. things removed in time, place and nature.

‘*Second kind of Negation*’—i.e. that in the form of ‘the cognition of something else’.—(1665)
