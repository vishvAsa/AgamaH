> When the ‘desire to speak’ is the thing to be inferred, the presence of the three features is quite clear;—the man is the minor term, wherein the presence of the desire is the probandum, which is proved by its effect in the shape of the verbal statement (probans). For example (the form of the inference would be)—this man is cognised as having had the desire to speak of the tree,—because he has uttered the word ‘tree’,—just as i had done under previous circumstances.—(1521-1522)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—“We grant that words can serve as the means of cognising the ‘Desire to Speak’; but what is the *Minor* Term, what the *Probandum*,—what too the well-known relation between them,—by virtue of which the Verbal Statement can be regarded as a full-fledged *Three-featured* Inference,—and not a distinct Means of Cognition by itself?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1521-1522 above*]

The Man is the Minor Term,—where he is actually seen;—the *desire to speak* is the Probandum;—the relation consists of occurring in the same ‘chain’, as shown before.—Where, however, the speaker is not visible, the *Place* would be the Minor Term,—and *the man with the said desire* would be the Probandum; because the place also is one of the causes of the Word; as is clear from the fact that the Word that is heard in places like the mountain-cave is different from that heard elsewhere.—(1521-1522)
