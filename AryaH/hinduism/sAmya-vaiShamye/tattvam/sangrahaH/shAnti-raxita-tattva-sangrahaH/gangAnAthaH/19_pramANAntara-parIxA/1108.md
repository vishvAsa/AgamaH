## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* describes the Presumption based upon Analogical Cognition:—[*see verse 1599 above*]

\(5\) When the object, Cow, is likened to the Gavaya, there is in the Cow the capacity to be apprehended by the Analogical Cognition; and this capacity is derived from the *strength*—Presumption—based upon that Analogical Cognition.—(1599)
