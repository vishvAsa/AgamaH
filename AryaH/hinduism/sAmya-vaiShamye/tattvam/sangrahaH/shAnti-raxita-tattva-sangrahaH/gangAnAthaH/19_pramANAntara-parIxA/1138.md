> It cannot be right to deduce the fact of *caitra* being outside the house from the fact of his absence in the house, because, there being a chance of his having died, the latter fact is capable of another explanation also.—If it is the absence of the living man in the house that is meant to be the basis of the presumption bringing about the idea of his being outside,—this also cannot be right; as the element of certainty would be lacking. When a man with ordinary powers of vision does not see *caitra* in the house, he can have no certain cognition regarding his being alive.—(1641-1643)
