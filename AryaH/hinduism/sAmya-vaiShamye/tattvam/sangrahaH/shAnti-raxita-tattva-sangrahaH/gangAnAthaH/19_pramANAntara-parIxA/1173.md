> As a matter of fact, the members of the aggregate are the causes of the idea of the aggregate; hence the cognition of the probability (*sambhava*) of ‘a hundred’ (*śata*) proceeding from that of ‘a thousand’ (*sahasra*) is only produced by the inferential indicative.—(1699)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“‘*Sambhava*’, (Probability) serves to bring about the cognition of the *components of the Aggregate* after the Aggregate itself has become cognised. For instance, the idea of ‘a hundred’ follows after the existence of ‘a thousand’ has been cognised. This cannot be Inference, as there is no Corroborative Instance available.”

The objection against this is set forth in the following—[*see verse 1699 above*]

Because the Aggregate is not something apart from the *components of the Aggregate*,—and these components are the cause (basis) of the very notion of the ‘Aggregate’,—therefore the cognition of ‘a hundred’ that proceeds from ‘a thousand’ is only a case of cognition produced by the Inferential Indicative, in the shape of *Effect*.—(1699)
