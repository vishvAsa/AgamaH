> If the other characteristic of ‘potency’ were held to be cognisable through presumption based upon the fact of the effect being otherwise impossible,—this cannot be right, as the effect is actually produced otherwise,—as it proceeds from the object itself.—(1612)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“There is another characteristic of *Potency*—that is, *Potency* which is always cognisable through the fact of the effect not being otherwise possible; so that—‘being inferred from the effect’ would be the characteristic of *Potency*

This definition of *Potency* cannot be right.—“Why?”—Because *the effect is actually produced otherwise*,—that is, the effect is produced even without such a distinct thing as ‘Potency’.—“How so?”—*It proceeds from the Object itself*—Because this effect proceeds from the Object—the Thing—therefore the existence of the effect is possible even without the Potency; so that what is the use of assuming the Potency as something apart from the Thing itself?—(1612)
