> As regards these arguments—the ‘modification’ of the eternal entity (soul) has been rejected already; the existence of the contrary of such a ‘modification’ cannot be occasional.—(1660)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The above arguments (of *Kumārila*, in support of ‘Negation’ as a distinct *Means of Cognition*) are answered in the following—[*see verse 1660 above*]

This shows the ‘impossibility’ of the first definition of *Negation* as ‘the non-modification of the Soul’ (see Text 1649). What is meant is as follows:—By the process of Preclusion, ‘non-modification’ is something ‘contrary to modification’; it is this, as appearing at certain times, that is meant to be the characteristic feature of ‘Negation If it were not this *occasional* ‘non-modification’ that is meant by the process of Preclusion, then the thing defined would be there at all times.—Such ‘non-modification’ is not possible in the case of the Soul; as the possibility of any *modification* of an eternal entity has been already rejected. Under the circumstances, how could there be any basis for what is only the. contrary of that Modification by the process of Preclusion?

The ‘*sattva*’, ‘entity’, meant here is the *Soul*, which is qualified by the adjective ‘*nitya*’, ‘eternal—Or, the compound ‘*nityasattva*’ may be expounded as ‘that of which, the *sattva*, existence, is *nitya* eternal’; that is, *eternal*.

‘*The existence of the contrary of such modification*’;—‘*the contrary of modification*’ is *non-modification*;—this cannot be *occasional*; it must be eternal; as being always of one and the same form, the Soul is one only.—(1660)
