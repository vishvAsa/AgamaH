> What happens in this case is that there are some parts in the *gavaya’s* body which bring about cognitions similar to those brought about by the parts of the cow’s body;—hence when the *gavaya* is seen, there follows the remembrance of the parts of the cow’s body that have been seen before repeatedly. It is for this reason that, there does not arise any idea of the horse and other animals, through that similarity,—but it does arise when the *gavaya* is seen. otherwise, if there were no such remembrance, what would be the difference (between the case of the cow and that of the horse)?—(1547-1549)



## Kamalaśīla

Further, because it is of the nature of Remembrance, therefore, being like any other Remembrance, *Analogical Cognition* cannot be a valid form of Cognition. The following *Texts* explain how Analogical Cognition is of the nature of Remembrance:—[*see verses 1547-1549 above*]

In its essence, there is no such thing as *Similarity*; all that is there is that there are some parts in the *Gavaya’s* body which bring about the same conceptual notions as certain parts of the *cow’s* body; and *similarity* is not any distinct entity, apart, from the said parts which give rise to the same conceptions; that this is so is clear from the fact that nothing apart from these figures in the conception at all. Hence what happens is that on the perception of the *Gavaya*, there arises a cognition in regard to the parts of the *Cow’s* body, on account of the repeated perception of these latter in the past; and this cognition that arises is of the nature of *Remembrance*,—and it is not a distinct cognition apprehending a distinct entity in the shape of *Similarity*.—If it were not so, then, in regard to the Horse and other animals also,—as the presence of the manifold commonalty of component parts is there,—why should not the idea of these other animals appear on the seeing of the *Gavaya*, in the way as it does in regard to the *Cow*? There is no difference between the two cases, some degree of *similarity* being present in both cases.

‘*Otherwise*’,—i.e. if the parts of the *cow’s body* had not been seen repeatedly.

In the case of the resultant cognition being of the nature of *Remembrance*, this difficulty does not arise; as the Remembrance appears in regard to that same thing which has been repeatedly seen before; as the causes that bring about Remembrance are restricted in their scope.—(1547-1519)
