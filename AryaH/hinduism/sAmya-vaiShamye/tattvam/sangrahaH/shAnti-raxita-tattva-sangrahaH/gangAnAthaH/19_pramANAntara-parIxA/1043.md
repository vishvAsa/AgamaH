> “It is only when the eire exists whenever there is smoke that its concomitance is clearly perceived. in the case in question however, there is no such certain idea as that ‘the thing spoken of exists wherever the word exists’.”—(1495)



## Kamalaśīla

“It is because of the well-recognised fact that ‘wherever there is smoke there must be Fire’ that Fire is said to be *concomitant* with smoke; there is however no such concomitance between the *Word* and the *Thing* (spoken of).”—(1495)

*Question*:—Why is there no such *concomitance*?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1496 next*]
