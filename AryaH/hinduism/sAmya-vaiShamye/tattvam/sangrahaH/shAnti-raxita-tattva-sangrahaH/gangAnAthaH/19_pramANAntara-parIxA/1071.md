> “(*a*) Analogical cognition cannot be regarded as sense-perception,—because it is entirely devoid of the functioning of the senses. (*b*) Nor can it be regarded as inference, because the ‘three-features’ are not there; for instance, there is no probans here (which subsists in the subject); and the similarity of the cow (to the *gavaya*) has not been previously cognised as subsisting in the subject; and the similarity that is perceived in the *gavaya* cannot bring about the inference of the cow.”—(1538-1540)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be asked—Even if Analogy be a Means of Cognition,—in what way is it distinct from Sense -perception and the rest?

The Answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1538-1540 above*]

It cannot be right to regard the cognition in. question as *Perception*, because it is not brought about by the contact of the senses.

Nor can it be regarded as *Inference*; as the ‘Three Features’ are absent. For instance, what would be the ‘property of the Subject’, i.e. the Probans?—the *similarity*?—or the *Gavaya* that is seen? If the *similarity* were taken to be the Probans, would it be the *similarity* in the *Cow*?—or that in the *Gavaya*? These are the only two alternatives possible.—Now the *similarity* residing in such cognisable things as the *Cow* and the like cannot serve as the Probans, because, prior to the perception of the *Gavaya*, that *similarity* has not been apprehended; and what has not been apprehended cannot serve as the Probans; if it did, it would lead to absurdities.—‘Then it is the *Similarity* residing in the *Gavaya* that could serve as the Probans, because this similarity is apprehended when the *Gavaya* is seen—The answer to that is that *what is perceived in the Gavaya cannot bring about the Inference of the Cow*; as there is no co-ordination between them; just as there is none between the *Cow* and the *blackness* (perceived elsewhere).—(1539-1540)
