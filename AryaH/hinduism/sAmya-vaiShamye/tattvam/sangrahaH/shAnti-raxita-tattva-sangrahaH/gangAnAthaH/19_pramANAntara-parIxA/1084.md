> Just as distinction from ‘similarity’ is cognised in that case, so also is distinction from ‘all common parts’ cognised in the other case also.—(1561)



## Kamalaśīla

In the case of the idea of ‘dissimilarity’, there is perception of difference from (i.e. negation of) ‘Similarity’; in the same way, in the case of the idea of ‘Similarity’ also, there is perception of difference from (i.e. negation of) the *presence of all Common Parts*; so that this also can be included under *Negation*, just like the notion of *Dissimilarity*.—(1561)

In support of the same, an argument is put forward:—[*see verse 1562 next*]
