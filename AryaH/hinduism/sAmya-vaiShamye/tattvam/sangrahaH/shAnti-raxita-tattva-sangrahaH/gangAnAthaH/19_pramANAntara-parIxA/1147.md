## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* seeks to prove, by means of Inference, that Negation is an entity:—[*see verse 1656 above*]

There can be no division of a *Non-entity*; as division always rests in entities.—Hence *Negation* must be an *entity*.

‘Negation is an entity’,—this the statement of the Proposition; in support of this there are two Reasons: (1) ‘*because it is apprehended by exclusive and inclusive notions*’, and (2) ‘*because it is cognisable*’;—‘*like the Cow, etc*.’ is the Corroborative Instance.

Of these, the ‘inclusive Notion’ is the idea, in regard to all the four kinds of Negation, that ‘it is Negation’;—the ‘exclusive notion’ is in the form of the differentiating idea as ‘*Previous Negation* is not *Destruction*’,—(1656)
