> ‘That person is the king who is protected from the rays of the sun by the white umbrella’,—having been told thus, the man, later on, sees such a person,—and through the said advice, comes to have the notion that ‘this is the person bearing the name king’.—Now this would have to be regarded as a distinct form of valid cognition, as it has not been brought about by similarity or any such conditions (as bring about other forms of cognition).—(1582-1583)



## Kamalaśīla

An example is cited of the manner in which notions of Names are brought about by endless means:—[*see verses 1581 above*]

Someone says to another man—‘Brother, please go for this business, and see the King passing along with many persons riding elephants and horses’,—The other man says—‘Which one among them is the *King?*’ The first man replies—‘Among them, that person is the *King* who is protected from the Sun’s rays by the white Umbrella’.—Bearing this instruction in his mind, the man goes forward, and when he sees such a person as described to him, there appears in his mind the idea that ‘this is the person named *King*’.—Now, according to you (*Naiyāyika*)—this also would have to be regarded as a distinct form of valid Cognition—why?—*Because* *it* *has* *not been brought about by similarity or any such conditions*. This shows that the said notion is not included under the six well-known forms of Valid Cognition.—(1582-1583)
