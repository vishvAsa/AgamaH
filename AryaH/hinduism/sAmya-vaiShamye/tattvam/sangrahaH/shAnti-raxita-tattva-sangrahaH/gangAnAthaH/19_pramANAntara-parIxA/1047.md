> As regards the ‘eternal sentence’, its possibility and expressiveness (usefulness) are both improbable; hence the first definition of ‘verbal cognition’ is an ‘impossible’ one.—(1500)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Text*, the author proceeds to show that the definition of Verbal Cognition propounded in Text 1489, as ‘that Cognition which is derived from the eternal sentence’,—is open to the charge of being ‘impossible’:—[*see verse 1500 above*]

There is no *possibility* of there being an ‘eternal sentence’, because it has been established that all things are in *perpetual flux*; also because of the reasons that are going to be adduced.

Even if such ‘eternal Sentence’ were possible, it could not convey a meaning (and serve any useful purpose).

Hence the statement that—“Through the eternal Sentence imperceptible things become known”—is impossible; hence the proposed definition is an ‘impossible’ one.—(1500)
