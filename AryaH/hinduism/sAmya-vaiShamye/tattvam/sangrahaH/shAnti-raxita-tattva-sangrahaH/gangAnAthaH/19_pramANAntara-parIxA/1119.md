> When the sun reaches another place, what happens always is that it is born (again) in a place different from its original place; this is as it is found in the case of the fire-flame; a thing that remains permanent is of a totally different kind; otherwise such reaching of another place would not be possible.—As regards potency, it has already been shown that it is nothing apart from the thing.—(1618-1619)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under Text 1588) that—“From the *inferred* mobility of the Sun, the Potency is cognised by Presumption”:—[*see verses 1618-1619 above*]

This shows that Presumption is included under Inference.

For instance, whenever anything is found to reach another place, it is a case of the thing being born in a place other than its original one;—as is found to be the case when the fire-flame moves from one place to the other;—the Sun is found to be reaching another place; hence this is an Inferential Reason based upon the nature of things.

This Reason cannot be regarded as ‘Inconclusive’; because *a thing that remaim permanent*—i.e. an object that always remains in one and the same form—cannot reach another place; as it can never renounce its original position; if it does renoimce it, it must be in a new- form born again. This is the Reasoning sublating any conclusions to the contrary.

It might be argued that—“This Presumption has been cited as proving the existence of the *Potency*, not the *birth* of the thing; how then is it that the Presumption is said to he included under this Inference?”

The answer to this is—‘*As regards Potency, etc. etc*.’—(1618-1619)
