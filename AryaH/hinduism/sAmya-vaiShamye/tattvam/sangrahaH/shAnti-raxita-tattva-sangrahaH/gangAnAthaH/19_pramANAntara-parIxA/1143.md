> “What is regarded to be ‘negation, a means of cognition’, is the non-functioning of perception and the other means of cognition; this may consist either in ‘the non-modification of the soul’, or in the cognition of another object.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-negation, 11],—(1649)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

What is regarded to be ‘Negation, a Means of Cognition’ is the non-functioning of Perception and the other Means of Cognition.

The term ‘*pramāṇabhāva*’ may be taken either as the Genitive—*Tatpuruṣa* Compound, or as the *Kārmadhāraya*.

In some places the reading is ‘*pramāṇe-abhavaḥ*’, in which the meaning of the Locative ending would be ‘among Pramāṇas’,—the singular number in ‘*pramāṇe*’ being due to all *Pramāṇas* being referred to as a *class*.

Thus has *Śabarasvāmin* declared (under Sū. 1. 1. 5)—‘Negation consists in the absence of the Means of Cognition and it gives rise to the notion of a certain unseen object *not existing*’.

*Question*—“What is this non-functioning (of the Means of Cognition)?”

*Answer*:—‘*This may consist, etc*. *etc*.’—*This*—i.e. the non-functioning of Perception and the rest,—may be said to consist in the Soul in a state of rest, not becoming modified into the form of the cognition of the Jar or any such thing which may be meant to be denied;—or it may consist in the cognition of the spot on the ground as devoid of the said Jar, etc.—”(1649)
