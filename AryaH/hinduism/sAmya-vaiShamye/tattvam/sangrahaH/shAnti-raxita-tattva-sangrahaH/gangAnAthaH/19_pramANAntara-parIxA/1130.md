> Or, it may be that what is inferred is the speaker’s ‘desire to speak’ relating to the second statement; by this there is cognition of negation following from the affirmative assertion.—(1631)



## Kamalaśīla

“*By tills*”—i.e. by the Inference of the character of the cause,—not directly; because it is from the affirmative sentence that the said ‘desire to speak’ is apprehended,—in which ‘desire’, the negative sentence also figures. Otherwise, if the *eating at night* did not figure in the said ‘desire to speak’, and mere *denial of eating* were meant, then the statement would have been in the form ‘Devadatta does not eat’ and the terms ‘fat’ and ‘during the day’ would not be there.

*Vyatirekagatiḥ*’—the cognition of the contrary sentence.—(1631)
