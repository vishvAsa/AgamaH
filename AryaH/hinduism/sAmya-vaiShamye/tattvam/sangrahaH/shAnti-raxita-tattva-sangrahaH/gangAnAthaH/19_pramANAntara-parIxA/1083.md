> When one sees the *gavaya*, there appears the notion of its ‘dissimilarity’ to the horse and other animals; why cannot this be a distinct form of cognition?—If it be urged that “it cannot be so regarded because it is included under negation”,—then, the same might be said in regard to the notions of ‘similarity’ which also are included under ‘mutual negation’.—(1559-1560)



## Kamalaśīla

Then, again, on seeing the *Gavaya*, there appears the idea of its similarity in the Cow,—and this is regarded as a distinct Form of Cognition; in the same way, when on seeing the *Gavaya*, there follows the notion of its *dissimilarity* in the *Horse*,—why cannot this also be regarded as a distinct Form of Cognition?

“It cannot be regarded as a distinct Form of Cognition, as it is included under *Negation*.”

That cannot be right.

“Why?”

Because it envisages a positive entity; while *Negation* envisages a non-entity.

“*Dissimilarity* is only *negation of similarity*; and hence the notion of dissimilarity is really included under Negation.”

‘*The same might be said*, *etc. etc*.’—That is to say, if the *negative* character of a certain object is sought to be based upon its being subject to Mutual Negation,—then the same sort of object is found in the case of the notions of *Similarity* also,—which are regarded as ‘Analogical Cognition—(1559-1560)

*Question*:—“How so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1561 next*]
