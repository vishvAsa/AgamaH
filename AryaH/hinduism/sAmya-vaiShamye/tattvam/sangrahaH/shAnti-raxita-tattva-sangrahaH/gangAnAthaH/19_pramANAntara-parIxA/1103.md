> “For example—(1) the assumption of the burning power of fire, based upon the perceived pact of its haying burnt a certain thing;—(2) the assumption of the mobility of the sun based upon the inferred fact of its going from place to place.—[*Ślokavārtika*—presumption, 3];—(3) the potencies of all things are presumed on the basis of the inexplicability of the effects produced by them; [*Ślokavārtika—śūnya*, 254]; and all such potencies that become cognised are such as have not been known already,—and these are cognised without any idea of the relation (of concomitance).”—(1588-1589)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Texts*, examples are set forth, in order, of Presumption based upon the six Means of Cognition:—[*see verses 1588-1589 above*]

\(1\) An example of Presumption based upon *Perception* is the following—Having *perceived* the fact of *burning* by Fire, there is Presumption of the presence of Burning Power of Fire.

\(2\) An example of Presumption based upon *Inference* is the following—When the fact of the Sun’s moving from place to place has been *inferred*, this leads to the Presumption of the presence of *mobility* in the Sun.

\(3\) The potencies of all things are always *presumed* on the basis of the inexplicability otherwise of the effects produced by them. This Presumption (of Potencies) itself is based sometimes on Perception; e.g. when *one perceives* the effect and thence *presumes* the potency in the Cause;—when however the effect is known through Inference or some other means of Cognition, and thence the Potency of the Cause is *presumedl*, then the Presumption is based upon Inference or some other Means of Cognition.

The compound ‘*Kāryārthāpatti*, *etc*.’ is to be expounded as ‘those whose cognition is brought about by the *otherwise inexplicability of the effect*;—(he. the fact that the effect cannot be explained except on the basis of the Potencies)’.

It cannot be said that the Potency of the Cause is already known; because the said Potencies that are cognised are always such as are not already known; so that the cognition does not apprehend what has been already apprehended; and hence this must be regarded as a Form of Valid Cognition.

It might be argued that—‘Potencies are always *inferred* from the effects,—they are not *presumed*’.

The answer to this is that the cognitions in question *are brought about without any idea of the relation* (of Concomitance, necessary in all Inference); hence they cannot be regarded as *Inference*.—(1588-1589)

The following text proceeds to show the said absence of any idea of the *Relation*:—[*see verse 1590 next*]
