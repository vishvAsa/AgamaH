## Kamalaśīla

The compound ‘*Kāryakāraṇatā*, *etc*,’ is to be expounded as the ‘*prati*-*patti*’, cognition, of ‘*Kāryakāraṇatā*’, the relation of Cause and Effect, and of ‘*abhāva*’, ‘non-existence’; the cognition of the relation of Cause and Effect is said to be by means of ‘Ratiocination’, and the cognition of ‘nonexistence by means of Non-apprehension’.

‘*Asyām*’—in the two cases cited—of ‘Ratiocination’ and ‘Non-apprehension’,—there is no difference between the Probans and the Probandum.—(1696)

How there is no difference is shown in the following—[*see verse 1696 next*]
