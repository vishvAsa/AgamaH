> “In the case of an object where the five means of cognition do not function for the comprehension of the existence of that object,—negation is the only means of cognition,”—Kumārila: *Ślokavārtika*-negation, 1].—(1648)



## Kamalaśīla

In regard to ‘Negation’—*Abhāva*—the Author sets forth the following views:—[*see verse 1648 above*]

According to *Mīmāṃsakas*, entities are of two kinds—Positive and Negative,—the former being characterised by *existence* and the latter by *non-existence*;—and they hold that every object has two aspects—the *existent* and the *non-existent*; thus it being acknowledged that the Object has these two aspects,—the *existent* and the *non-existent*,—in the case of *an object*—Le. the non-existent aspect of the object,—*the five Means of Cognition*, ending with ‘Presumption’, *do not function*,—for what?—*for the comprehension of the existence of that object*,—d.e. for apprehending the *existent* aspect of the object,—in the case of such cognisable object, in the shape of its *non-existent* aspect,—‘Negation’ is the only Means of Cognition.

This shows only the *object* cognisable by this Means of Cognition, not the *form* of the Cognition itself.—(1648)

*Question*:—What then is the *form* of this Cognition?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1649 next*]
