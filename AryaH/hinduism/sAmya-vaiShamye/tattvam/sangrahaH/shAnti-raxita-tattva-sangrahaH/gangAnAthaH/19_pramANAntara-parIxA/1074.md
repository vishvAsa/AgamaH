> As there is no object that could be cognised by this means, it cannot be regarded as a means of cognition.—It might be urged that—“there is the connection of the manifold commonalty of component parts, which is what is cognised”.—But commonalty itself haying been rejected, how could there be any manifoldness in regard to it? How too could there be any ‘connection’ with such manifold ‘commonalty’? [says the opponent]—“There is a means of cognition which brings about the cognition of such commonalty, in the form of the inference that—commonalty is an entity and is apprehended by sense-perception, because it is cognisable as something other than negation,—like the unique entity”.—[the answer to this follows in the following text 1545.]—(1543-1545)



## Kamalaśīla

Analogy cannot be a Means of Cognition, because there is nothing that is *cognised* by means of it,—and hence it is like any Means other than the *six* (that are accepted by the *Mīmāṃsaka*).

“But there is *similarity*, consisting in the presence of the manifold commonalty of component parts, which is *cognised* by its means; lienee the Reason adduced (by the Buddhist) is ‘inadmissible’.”

It is not so; in course of our examination of *Commonalty* (Universal), all commonalties have been rejected; how then can there be any ‘manifoldness of Commonalties’? Nor is connection of Commonalties possible. Hence our Reason cannot be said to be ‘Inadmissible’.

The following might be urged:—“There *is* a Means of Cognition which establishes the existence of the Commonalty. Hence your Reason remains inadmissible. The said Means of Gognition is as follows—‘The Commonalty is an entity’,—and ‘it is apprehensible by Sense-perception’,—these are the two *Propositions*; the Reason (Premiss) is, ‘because it is something cognisable, other than Negation’; that is to say, it is cognisable as something which has a character other than ‘non-existence’;—‘the unique entity’ is the Corroborative Instance; the *specific Individuality of things* is the ‘unique entity’,”—(1543-1545)

The answer to the above argument is provided in the following—[*see verse 1546 next*]
