> “As a matter of fact, in the case of everything which is always existent in its own form, and non-existent in the form of other things,—it is only a certain aspect that is cognised through certain means at certain times; and it is only when the existent (positive) aspect is to be cognised that perception and the rest come in; and when the non-existent (negative) aspect is to be apprehended, the operation of the ‘non-appearance of perception and the rest’ (*i.e.* ‘negation’) comes in.”—(1672-1673)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* supports the same idea of Negation being included under Perception:—[*see verse 1671 above*]

“There would have been no object left to be cognised by *Negation* if objects had only one aspect; as a matter of fact, however, objects have two aspects—they are *existent* (positive) in their own form, and *non-existent* (negative) in the form of other things; there thus being two aspects of every object, there is only a certain aspect of it that is cognised through a certain Means,—all aspects are not cognised by all Means of Cognition.

“This same idea is further explained—‘*It is only when the Positive aspect*, *etc*. *etc*.’—When the Positive aspect of the Object is apprehended, then there is the operation of the five Means of Cognition, Perception and the rest,—and not of Negation; when however it is the Negative aspect that is meant to be apprehended, then there is operation of the ‘non-appearance of Perception, etc.’,—i.e. of ‘Negation’.”—(1672-1673)
