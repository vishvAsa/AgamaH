> If the perfect idea of the relation to the name is there at the time of the hearing of the analogical statement,—then the resultant analogical cognition apprehends what has been already apprehended; and as such, it cannot have the character of a means of valid cognition; because, like remembrance, this analogy also is devoid of the true character of the ‘instrument’ (and *pramāṇa* is an instrument, a means, of cognition).—(1564-1565)



## Kamalaśīla

At the time that the statement of analogy is heard, the idea of the relation of *Name and Named* is already there;—if the same idea appears again subsequently, it apprehends what has been already apprehended before, and hence—like Remembrance—cannot be a *valid cognition*.

It might be urged that—“It may apprehend what is already apprehended, and yet it may be a Means of valid cognition; what would be the incongruity in that?”

The answer to this is—‘*It is devoid of, etc. etc*.’—That is, the ‘true character of Instrument’ consists in being the *most effective cause*,—and a cause is *most effective* only when it tends to bring about what has not been already brought about.—(1564-1565)
