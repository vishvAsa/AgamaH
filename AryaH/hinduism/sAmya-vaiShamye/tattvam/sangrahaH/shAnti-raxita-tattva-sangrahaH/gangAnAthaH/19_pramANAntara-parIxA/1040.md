> “In the case in question (i.e. in verbal cognition) that which would be regarded as the subject forms the object cognised itself; and unless this is cognised, there can be no idea of any character (probans) belonging to it.”—(1492)



## Kamalaśīla

“In the case of Verbal Cognition, anything, in the shape of the *Tree* and such things,—that may be assumed to be the *Subject*,—forms the *object cognised* itself; as that is what is expressed by the word. That is to say, in this ease, the *Subject* itself—and not the *Subject as qualified by the Probandun*,—is the *object cognised*; and so long as the said *Subject* has not been definitely cognised, how can there be any definite cognition of any character as belonging to it?”—(1492)
