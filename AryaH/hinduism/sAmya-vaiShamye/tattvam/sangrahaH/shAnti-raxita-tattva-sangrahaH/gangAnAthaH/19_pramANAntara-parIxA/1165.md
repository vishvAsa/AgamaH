> Thus, it being established that negation is essentially a positive entity, the fact of its being spoken of by the name negation is not incompatible with its being included (under other means or forms of cognition).—(1690)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* proceeds to show the ‘Inconclusive’ character of the Reason—‘because it is spoken of by the name *Negation* [therefore Negation should be regarded as different from Perception and the rest’; see *Text* 1658]:—[*see verse 1690 above*]

‘*Thus*’,—i.e. under the principle that ‘the perception of one thing is what is called the non-perception of other things’ and so forth.

‘*The fact, etc. etc*.’—Even when ‘Negation’ is included under ‘Perception’, the fact of its being spoken of by the name ‘Negation’ does not become incompatible.

This shows that the Probans put forward by the Opponent is not absent where the contrary of the Probandum is present.—(1690)
