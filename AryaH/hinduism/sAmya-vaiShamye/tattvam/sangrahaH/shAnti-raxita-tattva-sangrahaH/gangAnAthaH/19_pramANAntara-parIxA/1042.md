## Kamalaśīla

It has been shown that (in the case of Verbal Cognition), there can be no *subsistence in the Subject* (i.e. the Minor Premiss); the following Text shows that there is no possibility of *concomitance* (between the Probans and the Probandum, as expressed in the Major Premiss):—[*see verse 1494 above*]

‘*Ascertained*’‘—recognised with certainty.

‘*By* *their functioning*’,—i.e. by *existence*, by being present.

What is meant is that it is only what *exists* that can be *concomitant*, not what does not exist.—(1494)

The same idea is further elucidated:—[*see verse 1495 next*]
