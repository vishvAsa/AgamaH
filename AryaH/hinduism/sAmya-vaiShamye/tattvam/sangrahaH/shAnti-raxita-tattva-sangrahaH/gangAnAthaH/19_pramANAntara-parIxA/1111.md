> Apart from the potent object, there is no such thing as ‘potency’, which could be cognised by means of presumption; and as for the potent object, it is cognised through perception itself.—(1607)



## Kamalaśīla

Inasmuch as Potency is nothing apart from the Potent object,—and the Potent object is cognisable by Perception,—Presumption would be apprehending what is already apprehended; and on that ground alone, it could not be regarded as a Means of Valid Cognition.

The mention of ‘Perception’ in this connection, is only by way of illustration.—(1607)
