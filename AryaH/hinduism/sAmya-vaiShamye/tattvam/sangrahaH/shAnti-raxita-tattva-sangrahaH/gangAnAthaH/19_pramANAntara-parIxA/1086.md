> Some people have held the view that—“after having heard the analogical statement, when one sees the similar object, he has the cognition of connection with the name,—and it is this that is called analogical cognition.”—(1563)

‘*Some people*’—i.e. the *Naiyāyikas*.

They have provided the following definition of Analogy—“*Analogy is that which accomplishes its purpose through similarity to a known object*.— (Nyāyasūtra 1. 1. 6)—The term ‘*prasiddhasādharmya*’ may mean either ‘through similarity to a known object’, or ‘through well-known similarity’;—the ‘object’ of which this ‘similarity’ is known is the *Gavaya*;—‘*through this*—i.e. on the basis of this,—there is ‘accomplishment’—fulfilment—of the ‘purpose’—i.e. of the relation of *Name and Named*; and this is *Analogical Cognition*.”

Other people have expressed the same idea in other words, as follows:—“Certain impressions having been left on the mind by a previous Verbal Cognition,—those impressions bring about a Remembrance,—this Remembrance leads to the Cognition of *Similarity*,—from which there follows the cognition of the relation to a Name,—this last cognition is Analogical Cognition.—The ‘Verbal Cognition’ meant here is that derived from the analogical statement—e.g. ‘the *Gavaya* is like the *Cow*’,—this produces an Impression, a faculty in the Mind,—this Impression brings about the remembrance of the said analogical statement, on the occasion of seeing the *Gavaya* in the present;—on the basis of this Remembrance, there follows a notion of Similarity.—‘*Samākhyā*’ is *Name*, i.e. the word;—this Name is related to the object;—and the cognition of this Relation is what constitutes *Analogical* Cognition.”

This is exactly the same idea (that has been set forth in the *Nyāyasūtra* quoted above).—(1563)

The above view of Analogical Cognition is refuted in the following—[*see verses 1564-1565 next*]
