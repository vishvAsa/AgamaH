> Mere name does not constitute the ‘essence’ of things; by virtue of which, when it (the name) has not been apprehended, the things could be regarded as ‘not known’, by people who know the true nature of the self.—(1555)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Name* does not form the ‘essence’ of things; so that, even if the Name has not been previously known,—if the thing happens to become known,—it cannot be said to be ‘not known’. Specially for the philosopher who holds the view that Sense-perception is of the nature of definitely certain Cognition,—it cannot be right to say that the thing, thus known, is not known.—(1555)
