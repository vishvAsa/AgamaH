> The reason (premise) here put forward is ‘not admissible’ for those who declare that anything cognisable in the form of ‘commonalty’ (or universal) falls tinder the category of the ‘non-existent and in the case of the former of the two probanda (put forth), the premiss becomes part of the proposition itself.—(1546)



## Kamalaśīla

The term ‘*artha*’ in the compound ‘*Sāmānyārtha*’, stands for ‘what is cognisable’.

As regards both the Propositions put forward,—the Buddhists hold that any such thing as ‘Commonalty’ (Universal) can have no character (existence); hence they cannot admit the statement that Commonalty is anything other than purely *non-existent*; so that to that extent, the Probans cited is ‘inadmissible

As regards the first Proposition,—that ‘Commonalty is an entity’,—in that connection, the Reason cited forms part of the Proposition itself; for instance, it is only an *entity* that can be ‘other than *non-existent*’; because the *entity* is only the ‘negation of the non-existent’; and it is this same that has been put forward, in other words, in the Premiss (Reason); and that same is the Probandum also; thus the Premiss forms part of the Proposition.—(1516)
