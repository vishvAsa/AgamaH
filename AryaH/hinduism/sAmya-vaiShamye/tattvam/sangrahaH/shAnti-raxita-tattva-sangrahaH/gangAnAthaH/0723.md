> “Further, one-ness, eternality and subsistence in every individual,—ore who would attribute these to Apohas which are peatureless, would be making cloth without yarns.—From all this it follows that the element of ‘exclusion of others’ could be present only in the denotation of those words wherein the negative term is present; in all other cases the thing itself is what is denoted.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 163-164]—(1001-1002)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*In those words alone where the negative term is present*’,—e.g. in such expressions as ‘*abhakṣyo grāmasūkaraḥ*’, ‘the tame hog is *not-to-be-eaten* ‘*The thing itself*’—in the positive form.

‘*In all other cases*’—where the negative term is not present.—(1001-1002)
