## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even though there be an apprehension of the Thing,—as there can be no one entity who would comprehend the preceding and succeeding Moments,—there can be no relation between these two.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 492 above*]

The term ‘*gati*’ stands for *apprehension*.—‘*Kramamdgatim*’,—the ‘*gati*’, apprehension, which is ‘*kramavati*’, successive.—‘Who would *correlate*’—have a comprehensive notion of.—That is, no one.'—If there were any one who would conceive of such a comprehensive notion as—‘The smoke has become cognised through the cognition of the Fire, and without the cognition of the latter the former is not cognised’—which appears in succession,—as apprehended by a single Perceiver, then it might be possible to establish the relation of ‘Cause and Effect’.—There can however be no such correlator, under your view,—hence the relation of Cause and Effect cannot he established.—(492)
