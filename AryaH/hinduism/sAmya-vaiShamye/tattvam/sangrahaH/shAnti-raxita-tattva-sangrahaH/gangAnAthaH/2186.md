> [They have declared that]—“The Purāṇa, the dharmaśāstra propounded by Manu, the Veda with its subsidiaries, and the science of medicine,—these four are self-sufficient commandments, and should never be attacked with reasonings”,—this threat, in regard to the self-sufficiency of their authority, we think, was pronounced by them to the dull-witted people for the same reason. Or else, how could a mere verbal statement make anything self-sufficient in its authority?—(3584-3585)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It was for this reason that *Manu* and others, realising the irrationality of the Veda, etc., declared, in reference to their own words, that they were to be regarded as so many ‘commandments’ (to be obeyed without question).—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verses 3584-3585 above*]

‘*Purāṇa*’—the literary works known under that name;—‘*mānavo dharmaḥ*’—the code composed by *Manu*;—‘*the Veda with its subsidiaries*’—i.e. with its six subsidiaries, Grammar and the rest.—‘*Cikitsitam*’—the science of Medicine.

‘*For the same reason*’,—i.e. on account of having found that the teaching of the *Purāṇa, etc*. was irrational and that your *Brāhmaṇas* were dull-witted.—(3584-3585)
