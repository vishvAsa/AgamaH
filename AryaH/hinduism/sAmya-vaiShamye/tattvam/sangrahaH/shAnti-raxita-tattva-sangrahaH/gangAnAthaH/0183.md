## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author next proceeds to refute the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* Conception of the ‘Soul’:—[*see verse 222 above*]

‘*Exclusive*’ *in character*;—the states of Pleasure, Pain, etc. (wherein the Soul is perceived) are mutually exclusive;—‘inclusive’ in character,—such character as ‘Intelligence’, ‘Substance’, and ‘Being’ are ‘inclusive’ or ‘comprehensive’ (inasmuch as they serve the purpose of ‘comprehending’ or *including*, not *excluding*);—these two, ‘exclusion’ and ‘inclusion’ form the ‘character’,—characteristic feature—of the Soul.—What is meant is that the followers of Jaimini declare the ‘Soul’ to be of the nature of ‘Sentience’ (Consciousness), and to be ‘exclusive’ in the form of the states of Pleasure, Pain, etc., and ‘inclusive’ or ‘comprehensive’ in the form of ‘Being’ and the rest.—This *Caitanya*, ‘Sentience’, is not anything different from *Buddhi*, ‘Intelligence’,—as held by the *Sāṃkhyas* (according to whom Buddhi is Cosmic Intellect, a product of Primordial Matter, while *Caitanya* belongs to the Spirit];—it is in fact *Buddhi*, ‘Intelligence’, itself. This is what is shown in the text—‘*Sentience*’ *being the same as* ‘*Intelligence*’; that is, it is only a form of Intelligence; the sense is that apart from Intelligence, no other form of ‘Sentience’ is recognised.—(222)
