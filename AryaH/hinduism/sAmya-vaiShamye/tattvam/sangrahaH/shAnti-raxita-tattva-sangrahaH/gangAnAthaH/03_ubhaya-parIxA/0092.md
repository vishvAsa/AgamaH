## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“Even though all the Potencies are present in Primordial Matter, yet a particular effect is produced only by that particular Potency which becomes manifestly operative and thereby becomes the Cause of that effect; thus it is that there is no simultaneity in the appearance of effects.”

The answer to this is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 105 above*]

The ‘manifested form’ of*Sattva*and other Attributes that you speak of,—cannot be said to be eternal; because these are found to appear at only certain times; then, in regard to the coming into existence of this ‘manifested form’, there are only three alternatives: they could be either (*a*) produced by the same Cause,—Primordial Matter and God—, or (b) produced by some other Cause,—or (c) they would be self-sufficient.—(*a*) Under the first of these alternatives, the said ‘manifested form’ would always be there, because its Cause, in the shape of Primordial Matter and God, is eternal and hence always present close at hand.—(105)

As regards to second alternative, the objection is stated in the following Text:—[*see verse 106 next*]
