> If there were disappearance of any particular potency, then the cause could never be productive of its particular effect;—because it is devoid of that potency at some other time; just like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such other things.—(104)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“Though it does not serve as the Cause in any other form, yet at the time that it is producing one effect, the capacity necessary for the producing of other effects is not present in it for the time being; that is why the other two effects do not appear at that time.”

The answer to this is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 104 above*]

*At some other time*,—i.e. at the time of the producing of the particular effect meant by the*Sāṃkhya*.—(104)
