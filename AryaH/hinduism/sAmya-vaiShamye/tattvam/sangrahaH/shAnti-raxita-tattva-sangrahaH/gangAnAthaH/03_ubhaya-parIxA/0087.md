> As for their ‘association’ assumed on the basis op their acting jointly,—this could be due either (*a*) to the creation op some peculiarity, or (*b*) to their serving a common purpose. (*a*) The former op these assumptions cannot be right, as both are ‘unmodifiable’; (*b*) nor is the latter acceptable; as that would lead to the absurdity op all products coming into existence simultaneously.—(95-96)



## Kamalaśīla

‘Association’ implies*joint action*; this can be of two kinds—either (*a*) by the creation of some peculiarity in one another, or (*b*) by serving a common purpose. The assumption of the ‘association’ of the former kind,—that consisting in the creating of some peculiarities—cannot be right;—why?—because both God and Primordial Matter are eternal and hence*unmodifiable*(unchangeable).—Nor is the assumption of the second kind of association right:—such is the construction of the words of the Text;—why?—because that would lead to the absurdity of all products coming into existence simultaneously. The potency of the Joint Cause—in the shape of God-Primordial-Matter—being absolute and untrammelled, and they being constantly associated,—its causal activity (towards the making of all things) would always be there.

In this connection, the arguments already urged before (in Commentary on Text 87)—in the words ‘That Cause is present in its complete form, etc.’—may also be brought forward.—(95-96)
