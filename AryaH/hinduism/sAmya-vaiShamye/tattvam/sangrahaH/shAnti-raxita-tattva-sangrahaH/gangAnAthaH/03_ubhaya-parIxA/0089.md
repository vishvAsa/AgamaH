> The answer to this is as follows at the time that the two are performing one act (of creating or maintaining or dissolving),—is their capacity to perform the other acts present? or is it not present?—If it is present, then at the time of creation, the other two acts also should come about;—thus whenever any one of the acts would be there, the other two would have to be there!—(101-102)



## Kamalaśīla

The term ‘*tayoḥ*’, ‘the two’, stands for Primordial Matter and God;—*at the time of performing one act*;—i.e. from among the three acts of*creating, maintaining*and*dissolving*,—at the time that any one is being done, is their capacity to do the other two acts present in them or not?—These are the two alternatives. If the capacity*is*there, then, inasmuch as at the time of*creating*, their Cause would be present in its untrammelled form, the other two acts—of*maintaining*and*dissolving*—should also come about, just like the act of*creating*; so that at the time that a thing would be*maintained in existence*—*its creation*and*dissolution*also should be there! And at the time of*dissolution*, there should be its*maintained existence*and*creation*! This certainly cannot be right. Because when the three conditions are mutually nugatory (and incompatible) it is not possible that they should co-exist in the same object.—(101-102)
