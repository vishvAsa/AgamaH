> If its own ‘essence’ is still unestablished, it cannot be operated upon by anything;—because it is bereft of all potency,—like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things.—(109)



## Kamalaśīla

The following Text proceeds to show that the ‘Essence’ cannot be something not-established:—[*see verse 109 above*]

‘*Upon anything*’;—this is a general statement; the meaning is that it cannot operate either upon itself or upon any other thing. If it did operate, then it would itself be an*established entity*; as such operation is the only characteristic of an*established entity*.—(109)

*End of Chapter*(3)*—dealing with the Doctrine of Primordial Matter and God, both being the Joint Cause of the World*.
