> As a matter of fact, the two (primordial matter and god) are the cause of the other two acts also, not in any other form than the one that brings about the one act; the form of the cause remains the same; why then should there be any cessation of the functioning of any act at all?—(103)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“At the time that Primordial Matter and God are bringing about one effect in the shape of the*Creation*(Birth) of one thing, there is not present in them that particular form of theirs which would be productive of the other two effects (*Maintenance*and*Dissolution*); that is why there is no possibility of the absurdity that has been urged.”

The answer to this is provided in the following Text.—[*see verse 103 above*]

The Pronoun ‘*Tat*’ stands for the Cause, that is, Primordial Matter and God,—*of the other*,—i.e. of the two subsequent acts.—*Not in any other form*,—what then?—it is always in its own form that the Two operate as*Cause*.—(103)
