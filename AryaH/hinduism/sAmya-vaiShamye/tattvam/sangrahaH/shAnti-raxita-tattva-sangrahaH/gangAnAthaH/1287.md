> That speech is hot there is due to the fact that the development (of the impressions) becomes hampered by powerful impediments,—just as in the state of highly complicated fever.—(1946)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the author points out that the Reason put forward iṇ this *Reductio ad absurdum* is ‘Inconclusive’ (Doubtful);—[*see verse 1946 above*]

As a matter of fact, Repeated Cognition is not invariably concomitant with Remembrance, etc.;—by virtue of which concomitance it should always produce the said Remembrance; or should cease on the cessation of the same. Because it is quite possible that there may be continuance of the previous habit, and yet there may be no Remembrance.

The mention of the ‘high complicated fever’ is only by way of illustration.

‘*Powerful impediments*’—due to existence in the mother’s womb.

‘*The development becomes hampered*’—That is the full development of the Impressions becomes hampered; i.e. it does not proceed in exact accordance with the peculiarities of the particular place, time and character of things as previously cognised.

This answers the following argument of the Materialist:—“Remembrance of previous birth cannot be admitted; because there is Remembrance of all men coming from the same village”.—The fact of the matter is that even those coming from the same village do not have the Remembrance; as among them there are some who are dull-witted who lose their memory.

‘*Tāsām*’—stands for the words, speech.—(1946)
