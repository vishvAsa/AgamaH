## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2074*]:

The above arguments (of *Kumārila*) are answered in the following:—[*see verses 2074-2075 above*]

The following *Text* points out the ‘Inconclusive’ character of the Reason adduced (by *Kumārila*, under *Text* 2070, above) that—‘the Object is clearly perceived as connected with outside space’:—[*see verse 2075 above*]

[*verse 2075*]:

There should be a stop at ‘*niṣkṛṣtam*’.

‘*Also*’;—i.e. just as the *real* ‘yellow’ is clearly perceived as connected with outside space, so also is the ‘yellow’ clearly perceived by the man with the jaundiced eyes.

*Question*:—“What if it is so perceived?”

*Answer*;—‘*And yet it is, etc*. *etc*.’—There should be a stop after ‘*saṃvedyaṃ na*’; and ‘*niṣkṛṣṭam*’ has to be construed here; and after ‘*na*’, ‘*bhavati*’ is to be understood.—Thus the meaning comes to be this:—The *yellow* that is perceived by the man with the diseased eyes does not become apprehended separately, differentiated from the *apprehending factor*; and yet it is perceived as ‘connected with outside space Hence the Reason in question is ‘Inconclusive’.

‘*It should be the same*, *etc. etc*.’—i.e. also in the case of the real ‘yellow’,—What is meant to be shown by this is that the two cases stand on the same footing only so far as ‘being clearly perceived’ is concerned.—(2075)
