> In the case of the *dhātrī*, *harītakī*, etc., it is pound that there is present in them, either singly or collectively, the potency to remove various diseases; and yet there is no ‘universal’ (community) in them which has that potency; because the cure op the diseases is found to be quick and delayed.—Nor can any diverse peculiar properties be produced in the ‘universal’, through the diversities op the soil, etc. because it remains always in one and the same form; the said diverse properties, however, are present in the *dhātrī*, etc.—Thus though, as a rule, things are entirely different, yet some of them having well-defined potencies are conceived of as similar, and hence these things become the basis of the conception of similarity, etc.,—not other things.—(723-726)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be urged—“without a comprehensive *something*, how can mutually distinct entities become the basis, directly or indirectly, of the notion of identity or unity?”

In anticipation of this question, the Author supplies the following explanation:—[*see verses 723-726 above*]

*Dhātrī* and some other fruits, though of entirely different forms, are yet, severally or jointly, endowed with the capacity to remove various diseases,—even without any comprehensive entity embracing them all.—It cannot be right to urge that—“even in this case it is only a comprehensive ‘Universal’ that does the effective act”; for the simple reason that there is no such common ‘Universal’ over them capable of performing the various fruitful acts. If there were such a common ‘Universal’, there could he no possibility of the notion that people have, of the capacity of removing diseases quickly or slowly that is found in only some *Dhātrī*, etc. and that at only certain times; as the ‘Universal’ would he of only one uniform character.—Nor can it be right to assert that—“the said *Universal* itself performs the diverse fruitful acts, when it acquires certain peculiar properties due to the soil as watered by milk and such things—because the ‘Universal’ is, *ex hypothesi*, eternal, and hence incapable of having any peculiar properties produced by anything else; and hence no such properties could be produced in it by the diversities of Soil and such things; because the ‘Universal’ is always of one and the same form. As for the *Dhātrī*, etc.; on the other hand, they are evanescent things and hence diverse properties are produced in them by the diversities of Soil, etc.; and hence they become endowed with the diverse potencies of curing diseases.—In the same manner, other things also, like the Jar, are produced out of their Causal Ideas in such forms that by their very nature they come to be conceived of as of one and the same form. Hence there is no difficulty in this case.

The term ‘*etc*.’ in the expression ‘*the basis of the conception of similarity*, *etc*.’, is meant to include the capacity to perform such fruitful acts as the holding of water and the like.—(723-726)
