## Kamalaśīla

In support of the third reason (set forth in *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, 9, ‘*because all things are not possible*’), the following explanation is provided:—[*see verse 10 above*]

“If it is your view that the Effect that is produced has been non-existent (before production), then, under that view, every product, in the shape of gold, silver and the rest, would be produced from all things, such as grass, dust, clods and the rest;—why *?—because the negation of co-essentiality is equally present in everything*; that is, the negation or absence of the character of being co-essential with,—of the same essence as—the Grass and the rest is equally present in everything that is likely to be produced. In the preceding text, the incongruity was indicated through the Cause, and in the present text, it is indicated through the Effect; such is the difference between the two.—And yet, as a matter of fact, everything is not produced from everything. Hence it follows that the natural law is that one effect is produced from one cause because it is only in that cause that that effect already exists (in a latent form).”—(10)
