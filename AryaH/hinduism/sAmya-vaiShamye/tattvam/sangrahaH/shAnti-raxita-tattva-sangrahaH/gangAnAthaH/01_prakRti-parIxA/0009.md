## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged (against the *Sāṃkhya* view):—“The potency of Causes is such as is restricted to specific Effects; hence, even though the Effect has been non-existent, yet it is only some one effect, an actual Product, that is produced,—and not an absolute non-entity, like the *Sky-lotus*; this is the reason why only a specific cause is secured (for the production of a particular effect), that one which is efficient for the purpose, not anything at random; so that particular effects are produced from particular causes, and not every effect from every cause”.

Having this objection in view, the *Sāṃkhya*, under the pretext of answering it, puts forward the following arguments in support of the fourth reason set forth [in the *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, 9: ‘*Because the efficient can do that only for which it is efficient*’].

*Of these things*,—i.e. of things that are held to be causes.*—It is not as has been urged*;—*i.e*. the objection urged does not affect the *Sāṃkhya* position; hence it is not a suitable answer to our argument made by the *Bauddha* and others,—Why?—Because even potent Causes, when producing their effects, produce only such effects as are amenable to their action, and not what is not so amenable.—(11)
