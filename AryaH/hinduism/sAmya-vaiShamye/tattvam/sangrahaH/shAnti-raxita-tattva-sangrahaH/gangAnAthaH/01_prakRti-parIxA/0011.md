## Kamalaśīla

In support of the *fifth* reason [stated in the *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, 9—*Because I he effect is of the essence of the Cause*]—we have the following—[*see verse 13 above*]

*Thus*,—i.e. in accordance with the reason explained in the preceding text; or on account of the four Reasons stated above (by the *Sāṃkhya*),—*the Effect being* absolutely *impossible*, under the theory that ‘the Effect is non-existent (prior to its production)’,—*what would that be by producing which*, the Seed and other things *would be a Cause*? Hence it would be possible to assert that the Seed and other such things cannot be ‘Causes’, because their effect is non-existent, like the *Sky-lotus*. And yet such an assertion is impossible, Hence it becomes established that the contrary view is the right one, that the Effect exists even prior to its actual production,—(13)
