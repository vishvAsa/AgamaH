> It has been held that the curd and other effects subsist in the milk and other causes, in the form of latent potency; now what is this ‘potency’? if it is the same as the curd and other effects,—then this also would be perceived like the milk itself.—(34)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following Text, the Author proceeds to point out further defects in the doctrine of the ‘Existent Effect’:—[*see verse 34 above*]

It is asserted (by the *Sāṅkhya*) that the Effect subsists in the Cause; what do you really mean by this? Do you mean that the Effect exists there in the actually *manifested* form? If so, then that cannot be; for if it were so, then while the Milk is still in the form of Milk, the Curd would be perceived, just as it is after the production of the Curd.—Or, is it meant that it subsists there in the form of *Latent Potency*?—Is this ‘Potency’ something different from the *Curd* and other Effects as manifested in the perceptible form? Or is it the same as these?—If it is the same, then, as before, it should be perceptible (which it is not).—(34)
