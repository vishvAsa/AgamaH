> All Means (of Cognition), when operative, serve to set aside Wrong Cognition and to produce Definitely Certain Cognition; this would not be compatible with reason (under the *Sāṃkhya* theory).—(23)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *text* the Author proceeds to criticise the theory of the Effect being existent, from another point of view—[*see verse 23 above*]

‘*Operative*’—active.—‘*Wrong Cognition*’ includes also *Doubtful Cognition*, as it partakes of both the contraries (affirmation and denial), and hence is as much an ‘imposition’ (as Wrong Cognition).—As a matter of fact, every Means (of Cognition), when operating on its objective, does two things: it sets aside Misconception and Doubt relating to the object of Cognition, and produces a definitely Certain Cognition relating to it. This fact cannot be compatible with reason, under the *Sāṃkhya* theory of the ‘Existent Effect’.—(23)
