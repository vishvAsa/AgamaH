> If this (peculiar feature) existed previously, then the objection is not answered; if, however, it did not exist previously, then, being- non-existent, how could it be produced out of the causes?—(20)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author answers the above arguments in the following—[*see verse 20 above*]

There can be only two alternatives: (1) This ‘peculiar feature’ that has been spoken of, existed already, in its pristine state of Primordial Matter, prior to the condition of ‘manifestation’ and the rest,—or (2) it did not so exist. If it did exist, then you have not succeeded in showing the invalidity (inadmissibility) of the two Reasons put forward by us, and thus answering them. If, on the other hand, it did not exist previously,—then, even so, how could that ‘peculiar feature secure its production from the said ‘Causes’? As your argument is that what is *non-existent* cannot be produced,—such production cannot be right;—such is the sense of the Text.—(20)
