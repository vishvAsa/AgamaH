> Being in keeping with one and the same object, the consciousness would be variegated in character.—if it be urged that “it is not so because of destiny and such other forces”,—then the consciousness would not be in keeping with the object at all.—(38)



## Kamalaśīla

All the said Feelings being in keeping with one and the same object, the Consciousness of each *person would be variegated in character*,—just like the cognition of such objects as the Blue and the like.

It might be urged that—“Even though every Object is tripartite in character (as made up of the Three Attributes), yet under the influence of such auxiliary unseen forces as those of Destiny and the like, in the form of Merit and Demerit, it is only some aspect of it that figures in the consciousness of any one person,—and not all its aspects to all persons.—The term ‘*ādi*’, ‘*such other forces*’, includes Habit, Nature, Desire to hold and the like.”

If that were so, then *the* *Consciousness would, not* *be in keeping with the object*; *i.e*. such Consciousness would not rest upon the object; as it would be devoid of the form of the Object itself.—(38)
