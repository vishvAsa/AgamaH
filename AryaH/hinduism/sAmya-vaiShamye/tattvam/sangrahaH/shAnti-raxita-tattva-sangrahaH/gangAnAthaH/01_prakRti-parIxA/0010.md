> “That to which no peculiarity can be attributed, which is eormless and unmodipiable,—how could such a thing be produced by causes,—when any modification would involve the loss of its very essence?”—(12)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[Says the Opponent to the *Sāṃkhya*]—“Who has said that causes produce effects which they are not efficient to produce,—that you are denying it here? All that is said is that they also produce such effects as have been non-existent; and that such previously non-existent effect is quite amenable to the potency of the cause”.

To this the *Sāṃkhya* makes the following reply:—[*see verse 12 above*]

The *Sāṃkhya* reasons as follows:—“The acceptance of the view that the Effect produced has been non-existent implies that causes produce an effect which is incapable of being produced by them. For instance, that which is non-existent is *formless*—i.e. characterless;—that which is formless is, like the *Hare’s Horn*, something *to which no peculiarity can be attributed*,—i.e. which cannot be. regarded as having any characteristics;—and that *to which no peculiarity can be attributed* must be *unmodifiable*, immutable,—like *Ākāśa*;—how can such a thing, which has not acquired a specific form, be produced by any cause?—It might be argued that ‘from the fact of its being perceived in its existing state (after being produced) it follows that it does become *modified*—The answer to that is that *any modification would involve the loss of its very essence*. If *modification* is admitted, then *its very essence*,—essential character, which is described as consisting of *formlessness*,—would become *lost*. As a matter of fact, unless the *non-existent* thing has relinquished its essential character (of formlessness), it cannot become *existent*; and if it does relinquish the essential character, then it would not be true that the *non-existent* (formless) thing has become *existent* (with form); the form of the *Existent* is entirely different from the form of the *non-existent*,—the two being mutual contradictories. Hence what is *non-existent* cannot be produced. If it be admitted that a Cause can produce such ang—then It would be admitted that Causes actually produce only suchngs as are incapable of *being produced*! Certainly what is incapable of being produced can never be produced; as we find in the case of the *Sky-lotus*. From all this it follows that the *Sāṃkhya* argument (the *fourth* in the *Kārikā*) is unanswerable.”—(12)
