## Kamalaśīla

The argument ‘because what is already *existent* cannot be produced’ as stated by the Author himself (against the *Sāṃkkya* theory on p. 24,1. 20, parodying *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, 9) has been duly supported; now he proceeds to argue in support of the other four arguments,—‘*became there is recourse to the Cause*’ and the rest,—in the following—[*see verse 21 above*]

As in accordance with the said reasoning, the Effect to be brought about would (according to the *Sāṃhhya*) be already in existence [read ‘*Sādhyasya bhāvāt*’], ‘recourse to Cause’ would not be possible; as intelligent persons have recourse to a cause only for the purpose of something that could be brought about by that Cause. Nor would it be necessary that particular Effects, like Curd and the rest, must proceed only from particular causes; simply because there would be nothing *to be produced* out of any cause. This supports the (parodied) argument ‘*Because all things are not possible*’, What is meant is that when the *Sāṅkhya* asserts that ‘an Effect cannot be produced from all causes’, what he means is that ‘a particular Effect can be produced only from a particular Cause This is not possible under the *Sāṃkhya* theory of the Effect being already existent; as, under this theory, there would be nothing *to be produced*,—Similarly as regards the argument that ‘an efficient Cause can produce only that for which it is effiicent’, neither ‘efficiency’ nor ‘the production of that for which it is efficient’ is possible under the *Sāṃkhya* theory; for the very same reason that there is nothing *to be produced* (under the theory). If anything were produced by another thing, then alone could one admit the ‘efficiency’ of the latterng, which could then be accepted as the ‘Cause’ of that which would be produced;—not otherwise.—This is what is meant by the words—*Nor* *would there be* ‘*efficiency*’, *nor any* ‘*operation of the Cause*’,—(21)
