> It is not so; it may be that, on account of the absence of ‘limits’, there can be no such subsequent assertion as held by us. but there is no harm done to the nature of the thing itself which is entirely free from all restrictive adjuncts.—(30)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following Text, the Author points out the invalidity of the reason (set forth by the *Sāṃkhya*, in the preceding Text):—[*see verse 30 above*]

[It cannot be as urged by the Opponent]—because, *on account of the* *absence* *of* ‘*Limits*’, it may be that there can be no such subsequent assertion as that ‘the potency to produce Curd is present in the Milk’; that may be so; but there is that Entity *which is entirely free from all restrictive adjuncts*—which is not a mere imposition (or assumption), subsequent to which there appears another Entity, which has not been previously perceived; and there can be no denial of such an Entity (as of the former one).—(30)
