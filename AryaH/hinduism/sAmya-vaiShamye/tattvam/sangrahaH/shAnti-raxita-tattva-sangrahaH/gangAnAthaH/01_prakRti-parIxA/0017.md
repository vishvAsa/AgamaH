## Kamalaśīla

The Author, in the following text, indicates (on behalf of the *Sāṃkhya*) the fallacy of ‘Inadmissibility’ in the argument just put up by himself—[*see verse 19 above*]

[The *Sāṃkhya* may argue as follows:—]—“If, in your first argument, you mean your premiss to be in the fully qualified form ‘because it already exists in its entirety, *even along with such features as being manifest and the rest*’,—then the premiss is ‘Untrue’, ‘Inadmissible’; because we do not regard the Effect as *existing* along with all such features as *being manifested* and the like; we regard it as *existing* only in the form of *a potency* (in the Cause).—If, on the other hand, you mean your premiss to be in general form, without the said qualification,—then it is ‘Inconclusive’; because such peculiar features as *manifestation* and the like *are* actually produced (even under our theory).—Nor does our theory involve the absurdity of all things being Effects (produced).—For the same reason, the second reason put forward by you is also ‘not true’, ‘Inadmissible’, as there *is* something to be brought about, produced.

This is what is meant by the phrase ‘*Something in the shape of Manifestation and the like*’; the expression ‘and the like’ is meant to include such peculiar conditions as *Growth*, etc.—‘*Which*’ (in the Text) stands for the ‘peculiar feature’,—‘*To be defamed*’,—blamed. What is meant is that our theory is not open to the fallacies that have been urged against our Reason as being ‘Inadmissible’, ‘Untrue’ and the like.—(19)
