## Kamalaśīla

*Question*—“How is it known that the *Manifest* is not imbued with any single generic character?”

The *answer* is supplied in the following:—[*see verse 42 above*]

Just as bars made of Iron stand apart from each other,—so these ‘Manifested Entities’, as they appear in their own forms, are found to be diverse and separate, due to diversities of place, time, potencies, appearances and so forth; and they do not enter into each other’s essence (or constitution). This proves the *multiplicity* (of Manifested Entities).

In order to prove their *non-eternality*, it is added—*Having their forms*, etc. etc.;—the compound is to be analysed as—‘*have their forms associated with*—embraced, affected by—*an order of sequence*’.

*Question*—“If this is so, then how is it that Entities are conceived of *as units*,—in the form of ‘Earth’ and the like,—and also *as lasting*,—in such notions as ‘this is that same thing’?”

*Answer*—*Their essence mixed, up with fancies*; that is to say, the conception of ‘unity’ in regard to things is a ‘*fancy*’, a wrong assumption. This is going to be established later on, under the sections dealing with the doctrine of the ‘Perpetual Flux’,—(42)
