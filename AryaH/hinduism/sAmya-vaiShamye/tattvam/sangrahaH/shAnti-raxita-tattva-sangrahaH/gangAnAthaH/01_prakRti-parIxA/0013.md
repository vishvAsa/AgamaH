> “Thus, the whole (manifest) must be taken as having emanated from something made up of the said (pleasure, etc,),—because the said generic character is found present in it,—just as in the case of the jar and other things; and this something is primordial *matter*”,—so say the followers of *Kapila*.—(15)



## Kamalaśīla

Having established the validity of the reason ‘*On account of homogeneity*’, the Text sets forth (on behalf of the *Sāṅkhya*) the full argument in support of their doctrine.—[*see verse 15 above*]

‘*The whole must, etc*.’;—i.e. emanated from a Cause which is made up of Pleasure and the restthis sentence states the Conclusion to be proved.—The Probans (Reason) in support of the conclusion is stated in the words—‘*Because the said generic character is found present in it*;—that is, it is all permeated by the generic character of *being made up of the Three Attributes;—just as in the case of the Jar and other things*;—i.e. such diverse products as the Jar and the rest.—And this Cause *made up of the Three Attributes* is Primordial Matter;—*so say the followers of Kapila*,—i.e. the *Sāṃkhyas* offer the said explanation.—(15)
