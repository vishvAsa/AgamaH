> In reality, the ‘production’ (or a thing) consists in its becoming a thing; this ‘production’ cannot be related to what is existent, or with what is non-existent; it is related only to a conceptual idea which is purely nonexistent—(32)



## Kamalaśīla

[Says the *Sāṃkhya*]—“If it is your view that what is produced has been *non-existent*, then how is it that in the *Sutra* (of the Buddhists), the production of both, the *Existent* as well as the *Non-existent*, has been denied?

This is the declaration—‘O high-minded one, all Things are un-produced, as neither the *Existent* nor the *Non-existent* is ever produced The answer to this is provided by the following:—[*see verse 32 above*]

The particle ‘*tu*’ (*in reality*) serves to emphasise what is going to be said.—When we come to examine in what manner a particular thing may be distinguished from other things, we find that what is called the ‘production’ (appearance, coming into existence, of a Thing) is only its own *Essence*, *becoming itself*, which exists merely for a *moment*, free from all connection with all elements of the Past and the Future. It is not a ‘Universal’ with particular features, as assumed by the *Vaibhāṣika*; such a ‘Universal’ is going to be refuted (under *Chapter* 13). Nor does it consist in ‘inherence in Being’ or ‘inherence in its own Cause’, as postulated by the *Vaiśeṣika*; as both these also are going to be refuted (under *Chapter* 13); and because, under the theory of the other party (the *Vaiśeṣika*), both these (Inherences) are constant, and what is already constant cannot be *produced*. To this effect there is the following declaration:—‘*Being* (Existence) consists in being in contact with the Cause; the Cause is a cause by virtue of producing the Effect; the Being and the Contact both being constant, what is there that could be produced?’

*This*—the said Production—*cannot be related to what is non-existent*,—by the relation of ‘co-essentiality’ (being of the same essence); as ‘existent’ and ‘non-existent’ are mutually contradictory, what is *nonexistent* cannot come about. Nor can the ‘production’ be related to what is *existent* already from before; because before Production, the *existent* cannot be there.

*Question*—“Then how is it that you (Buddhists) are upholders of the doctrine that ‘the Effect is non-existent’?”

*Answer*—*Only to a conceptual idea*, *etc*.;—it is only *to a conceptual idea*,—which is of the nature of either the Active Agent or the Instrument,—(*Cause*)—it is led into relationship. As a matter of fact, there is nothing called ‘non-existent’ which could enter into ‘production’; the idea therefore that ‘the non-existent is produced’ is purely conceptual.—(32)
