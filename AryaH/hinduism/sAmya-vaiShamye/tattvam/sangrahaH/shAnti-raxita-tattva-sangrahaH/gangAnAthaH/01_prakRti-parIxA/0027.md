> “Inasmuch as the presence of limits would re impossible for you, the potencies cannot be restricted. on the view of their being existent, on the other hand, their restriction would be right and proper as pertaining to the limits.”—(29)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following Text, the Opponent raises an objection on the basis of the Restriction of Potencies (of Causes):—[*see verse 29 above*]

*For you*—i.e. for the Buddhist who holds the Effect to he *non-existent*.—it is not possible for the (causal) Potencies to be restricted.—Why?—Because *the presence of limits*,—in the shape of *Effects—would be impossible*; [as the Effects would be non-existent, there would be nothing *with reference to* which there could be restriction];—for the simple reason, that when the limit is non-existent, *that which is limited* cannot be there. This argument may be formulated as follows:—Tilings devoid of limits in the shape of existent Effects cannot have their potencies restricted,—e.g. such things as Hare’s Horns,—and (according to you) things like the Paddy-seed are devoid of limits in the shape of existent Effects; hence they do not fall within range of the Major term [i.e. they cannot have their Potencies restricted]’,—With a view to show the soundness of his own view, the *Sāṃkhya* adds—*On the view of their being existent, etc*.—i.e. if Effects are held to be *existent*;—‘*their*’—i.e. of the Potencies.—(29)
