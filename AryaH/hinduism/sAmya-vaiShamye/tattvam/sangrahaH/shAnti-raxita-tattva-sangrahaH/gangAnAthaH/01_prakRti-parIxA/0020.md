> Inasmuch as every effect, is already there in its entirety, there can be nothing ‘to be produced’ (an effect); consequently, the very name ‘cause’ cannot be logical.—(22)



## Kamalaśīla

The following Text proceeds to show that it is not right that things should be regarded as ‘Cause’, for the simple reason that what is regarded as to be *produced* already exists (according to the *Sāṃkhya*)—[*see verse 22 above*]

This is said in support of the argument (the last one in the parodied *Sāṃkhyakārikā*)—‘*Because the Effect is of the same essence as the Cause*’.—But it is not (i.e. the name ‘Cause’ is not illogical). *Hence the Effect cannot be regarded as existent*;—this conclusion has to be construed with all the (five) arguments set forth above.—(22)
