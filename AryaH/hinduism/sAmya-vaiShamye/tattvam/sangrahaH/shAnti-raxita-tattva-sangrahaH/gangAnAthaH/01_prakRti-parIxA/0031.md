## Kamalaśīla

*Question*—“What is the basis of tins ‘conception’ on which the said Idea is supposed to rest?”

The answer is supplied by the following:—[*see verse 33 above*]

When the previously unperceived form of a particularng is perceived in immediate sequence to another thing,—the said form is one that *did not exist before*—i.e. prior to its own ‘middlemost state’[^1]—for the simple reason that it is not apprehended as fulfilling the conditions of being perceived. Hence this forms the *basis* for the conception that the thing that is produced is one that did not exist before.—“How so?”—*If the said thing, etc*.;—i.e. prior to its ‘middlemost state’, if the form of the thing, this middlemost state, had existed, there could be no room for the said ‘basis’ of the Conception that ‘what was non-existent has become produced Because the term ‘becomes produced’ connotes that particular state of the thing which appears in its ‘middlemost state’; and if this were present even previously (to that state), then this would set aside the notion that the ‘form’ of the thing consists in that particular form of it which appears during the ‘middlemost state’ *only*. As (*ex hypothesi*), it would be as all-pervading as *Ākāśa*, and as such it could not have any ‘previous’ or ‘middlemost’ or ‘subsequent’ states at all. Under the circumstances, it would be possible to assert that ‘allngs are produced at all times’, as there would be no grounds for differentiation.—(33)

[^1]:  Each object has three momentary ‘States’: (1) moment of non-existence, prior to coming into existence, (2) moment of existence, and (3) moment of non-existence, cessation, destruction.
