> “The states, in their own forms, are mutually incompatible; as for the common character, however, it is not incompatible with any state, and it is actually recognised, in its common form, in all states.” Ślokavārtika, page 696—(267)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The States of ‘Happiness’ and the rest are incompatible among themselves; hence it is not reasonable that they should become merged into each other;—on the other hand, if any one State became merged into the common character, where would there be any incongruity, which would go against the acceptance of its mergence therein? As a matter of fact, the said common character is actually seen to be compatibly permeating through all the States; as is clear from the fact that ‘Sentience’ and the other common characters are found to be present in all the States.—(267)
