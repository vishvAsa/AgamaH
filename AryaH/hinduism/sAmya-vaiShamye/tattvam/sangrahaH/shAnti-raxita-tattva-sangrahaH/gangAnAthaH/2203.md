> The person who apprehends all things in their own undiversified form, knows the very forms of all things.—(3632) 
>
> It is the ‘specific individuality’ itself, as differentiated from heterogeneous and non-momentary things, which is spoken of here as ‘universal’, on the ground of its leading to calmness and dispassion.—The cognition that apprehends this and is brought about by the force of medication, and appears only in great mystics, envisages the specific individuality itself.—(3633-3634)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 3632*]:

It has been argued under *Text* 3251, that—“Even if the Person by his own undiversified nature, apprehends all things, he cannot apprehend the specific individualities of all things”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3632 above*]

Says the Opponent:—“In the scriptures it is said that the Cognition of the Mystics, free from all impurities, appertains to *Universal* only,—not to *Specific Individualities*; how do you say that the Consciousness of the mystics, which envisages *Universals*, apprehends the very forms of all things?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3633-3634 above*]

[*verses 3633-3634*]:

That same ‘Specific Individuality’, which, differentiated from things of other kinds, becomes the basis of the notion of ‘Uniformity’, and is then called the ‘Universal’, Hence the consciousness of the Mystic which apprehends it and which becomes clearly manifested by the force of his Meditation, envisages the Specific Individuality itself; hence there is nothing incongruous in the same Cognition apprehending the *Universal* as well as the *Specific Individuality*.

It has been argued under *Text* 3253, that—“the said uniform cognition would be either true or false; if it is true, it goes against perceptible facts, as it makes all things one”.

All this also has been answered by what has been just explained; because what the mystic consciousness apprehends is the *Specific* *Individuality*.—(3633-3634)
