> He cannot assert even the infallibility of the concomitance between smoke and fire; because, under his view, smoke exists elsewhere also; in fact, being of the one uniform nature of ‘entity’, it exists in the ocean also; and if fire exists there also, then where would the absence (of the probans) lie?—(3378-3379)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That the birth of Smoke is related to Fire, and that it is invariably concomitant with Fire is known even to the veriest cowherd; and yet you, by describing the whole world as really one and uniform in the shape of ‘Entity’, are unable to say that Smoke is infallible in its concomitance with Fire; because under your view, in the form of ‘Entity’, it is present in water also.

“Even so there would be concomitance with Fire.”

*Answer*:—‘*If Fire exists*, *etc. etc*.’—If it is admitted that, under the principle of all things being one and the same, the Ocean is of the same nature as *Fire*,—then, in the proving of *Fire*, *Water* could not be regarded as *that where the Probandam (Fire) is known to be absent*; and thus there being nothing where the Probandum is absent, on what basis would the Probans, Smoke, be non-existent where the Probandum is absent?—(3378-3379)
