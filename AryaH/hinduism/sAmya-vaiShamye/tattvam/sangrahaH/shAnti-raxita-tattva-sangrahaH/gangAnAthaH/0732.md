> When the word brings about the exclusion of other things, it is said to ‘denote its own meaning’; and there is no incongruity in this.—(1016)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As against the Revered *Diṅnāga*, *Uddyotakara* has urged the following (in *Nyāyavārtika*, 2. 2. 63, pages 333-334):—“If the *Apoha* is not denoted by the word (‘*Apoha*’), then you have to explain what the word can signify apart from what is denotable by it? If that same (*Apoha* itself) forms the denotation of the word, then, this would be incompatible with your declaration that ‘a word is said to denote something when it is found that it brings about, in its denotation, the exclusion of what is denoted by other words’; as the only meaning that this declaration could have (under the theory that *Apoha* is *not denoted*) would be that the non-denotative word denotes something—(which is absurd)

The following *Text* proceeds to explain that this assertion has been made through ignorance of the meaning of the words (of the Teacher), and to show that there is no incongruity in those words:—[*see verse 1016 above*]

The Specific Individuality also is the word’s ‘own meaning’, by implication,—as explained before;—and when in its ‘own meaning’ in the shape of the Specific Individuality, the Word brings about—produces—the ‘exclusion of other things’—i.e. the *Apoha* in the form of Reflection, as excluded (distinguished) from other Reflections,—then it is said to ‘denote’ it. And there is nothing incongruous in the words of our Teacher.—(1016)
