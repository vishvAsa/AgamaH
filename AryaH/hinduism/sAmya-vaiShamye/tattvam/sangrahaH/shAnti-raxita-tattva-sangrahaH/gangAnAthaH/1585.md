> All these cognitions of the ‘cow-word’, which appeared yesterday and to-day, cannot all envisage the same object,—like the successively appearing cognitions of colour and odour, etc.—(2465)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author supplies the proof for the statement just made (in 2462) regarding the fact that ‘the diversity among Cognitions is proved by their appearing in succession, as in the case of the Virgin’:—[*see verse 2465 above*]

The argument may be thus formulated:—Those Cognitions that appear in succession do not envisage the same object,—e.g. the Cognitions of Taste, Colour, etc. appearing one after the other;—all these cognitions of the ‘Cow-words’ that appeared yesterday and to-day have appeared in succession hence there is apprehension of the wider contrary.—(2465)
