> In fact, the beginninglessness of the expounders and of the eternal sentences that is asserted by you for the purpose of proving their reliability, is denied by us as a sheer counterblast.—(3480)



## Kamalaśīla

Then again, it is you yourselves who assert the *beginninglessness* of the Vedas and their Expounders as a reason for the reliabilty of the Veda; so that all the objections that you have urged are clearly applicable to you.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3480 above*]

The compound is to be expounded as—‘The expounders’ *and* ‘the eternal sentences’, ‘Expounder’ stands for those who expound the meaning of the Vedas.—(3480)

*Question*:—“How is the Beginninglessness denied?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3481 next*]
