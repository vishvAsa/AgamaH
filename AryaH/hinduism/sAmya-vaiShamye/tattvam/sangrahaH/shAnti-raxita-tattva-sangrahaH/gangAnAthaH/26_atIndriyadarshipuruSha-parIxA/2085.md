> Even if you deny the capacity to know all things, your reason still remains open to the charge of its presence in the contrary of the probandum being doubtful.—Even if you wish your reason to consist in the capacity to use, the same defect, of the possibility of its presence in the contrary of the probandum, persists.—(3366-3367)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“If we had wanted to prove only that the knowledge of all things is not always present before Him, then perhaps our argument might have been superfluous, seeking to prove what is already admitted. As a matter of fact however, what we mean to prove is the fact that He does not possess the capacity to know in detail the truth relating to all things; hence our reasoning is not superfluous; nor is our Reason ‘Inadmissible’; because what our Reason means is the *capacity to use*.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3366-3367 above*]

In both cases there is nothing to set aside the possibility of the presence of the Reason in the contrary of the Probandum; and this doubt renders the Reason ‘Inconclusive’.—(3366-3367)
