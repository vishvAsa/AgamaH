> “The omniscience of one person cannot establish the truthfulness of the word of another person. It is only when the two are co-substrate—that they support one another.”—(3234)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—When is there invariable concomitance between the two (Omniscience and Truthfulness)?

*Answer*:—‘*It is only*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Co-substrates*’—subsisting in the same Person.—‘*Tayoḥ*’—between ‘omniscience’ and ‘truthfulness of word’,—‘*Support*’—signifies causal relation.

What is meant is as follows:—It is only when the two reside in the same Person that Omniscience can be the reason for *truthfulness*; not otherwise. If it were not so, there would be incongruities,—(3234)
