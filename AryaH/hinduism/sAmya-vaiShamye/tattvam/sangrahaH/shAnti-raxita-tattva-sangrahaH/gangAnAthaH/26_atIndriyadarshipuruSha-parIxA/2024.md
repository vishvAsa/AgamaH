> “thus then, there is no room for the omniscience of men. We now proceed to consider why the omniscient person has been postulated?—Your omniscient person—does he apprehend all things by a single cognition? Or by several cognitions? And then, does he apprehend them all at once? Or in succession—noticing only the more important things? In no case has it been seen that a single cognition apprehends such contradictory things as pure and impure and so forth; nor have several divergent cognitions been found to appear at one and the same time.—Who too is there who could apprehend, even in hundreds of years, each of the endless number of things, past, present and future?—Even if the person, by his own undiversified nature, apprehends all things,—he cannot apprehend the specific individualities of all things. Under the circumstances, what would be the use of the omniscient person who knows the things only in their general form? Specially as in no other form is the thing apprehended.—Then again, this uniform cognition could be either true or false.—If it be held to be true, then this would be contrary to perceived facts; as it would mean that all is one, without a second; and the result of this would be that there would be no such diverse entities as the disciple, the omniscient person, *dharma*, *adharma*, and the teachings of the said person; as the distinctive features of these would not be cognised.—If the one uniform cognition be held to be false, the omniscient person turns out to be a deluded person; so that no confidence should be reposed in his words, which are like the words of demented and intoxicated men.—If then the omniscient person is held to be that person who apprehends all things and their causes, through a single abnormal cognition brought about by communion,—then there can be no means of cognition to vouch for his existence,—in the shape of perception or inference or word, that is not produced by that person himself. Hence the conclusion would be that such a person does not exist.—Whether simultaneously or successively, how could there be any inference without an effect?—As a matter of fact, a certain person can either have no potency at all, or if he has, then he would have all potencies; so that all beings would be able to have the cognition of all things. And yet as a matter of fact, wanting in the necessary means, people do not cognise all things.—The idea that ‘there is one person who has acquired special powers not common among men, and he knows all things’—is entirely baseless.—Thus then, no omniscient person of any kind is conceivable. Consequently no human assertion could be the means of providing the knowledge of dharma.”—(3247-3261) 
>
> Thus have the Mīmāṃsakas argued, being firm believers in the self-sufficiency of the Veda.—But we have already proved in detail that the Veda is the work of a person.—Hence the conclusion is irresistible that there is a person who has the direct knowledge of all things; and no one can know things by means of the eternal word, which is an impossibility.—(3262-3263)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verses 3247-3261*]:

So far the Author has set forth arguments, from *Kumārila’s* point of view, against the Buddhist view that there are Omniscient Persons.—He now sets forth arguments adduced by the two writers, *Sāmaṭa* and, *Yajñaṭa*, against the idea of the Omniscient Person:—[*see verses 3247-3261 above*]

Does the man regarded as ‘omniscient’ know all things at one and the same time? Or in succession, one after the other?—Or, does He apprehend the whole world as *one*, in one form, such as *eternal* and the like? Or only the more important things—those for instance that are useful to men, such as the effects following from Acts and so forth?—Or is He called ‘omniscient’ because He possesses the capacity to know all things,—like Fire, which, though not actually devouring all things, either simultaneously or in succession, is yet called ‘all-devourer’?

Under the first alternative, two alternative views are possible, Does He know all things simultaneously through a single Cognition? Or through several Cognitions?—He could not know them through a single Cognition; because never has it been seen that several mutually contradictory things,—such as the *pure* and the *impure*—are apprehended by a single Cognition.

It might be argued that—what happens is that at one and the same time there exist in Him several Cognitions envisaging the various mutually contradictory things.

The answer to this is—‘*Nor have several divergent*, *etc. etc*.’—This has to be construed with ‘*na dṛṣṭaḥ*’, changed from the ‘*dṛṣṭam*’, of the previous clause. As a matter of fact, several Cognitions in the same ‘Chain’ of a Cognition have never been found to appear.

[Several lines of the text are missing here.]

[The Buddhist’s answer to the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* arguments against the Omniscient Person,—embodied in *Texts* 3128-3261.]

[*verses 3262-3263*]:

Thus the conclusion is that there is a Person who perceives things directly by Himself, not through the ‘Eternal Word’; because the ‘Eternal Word’ is an impossibility.

The ‘*eva*’ after ‘*draṣṭā*’ should be construed after ‘*sākṣāt*—(3262-3263)
