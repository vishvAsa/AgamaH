> The simultaneous apprehension by one and the same cognition of mutually contradictory things,—like the pure and the impure and so forth,—has actually been found. because they are not incompatible with cognition.—(3622)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued, under *Text* 3249, that—“One and the same cognition has never been found to apprehend such mutually contradictory things as the pure and the impure and so on”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3622* *above*]

Even though there are some things that are mutually incompatible, yet, they are quite compatible with the *Cognition*; as is clear from the fact that several mutually incompatible things are actually perceived at one and the same time.—(3622)

The same idea is further clarified:—[*see verses 3623-3624 next*]
