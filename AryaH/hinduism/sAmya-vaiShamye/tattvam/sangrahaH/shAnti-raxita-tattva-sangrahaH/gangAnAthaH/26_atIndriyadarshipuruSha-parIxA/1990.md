## Kamalaśīla

Now the Vedic Scholar proceeds—(1) to refute the objection that “the Reason, in the shape of *being amenable to non-apprehension*, *is inadmissible*”,—(2) to prove the non-existence of the omniscient Person,—and (3) to prove that the case of the Veda is different;—[*see verse 3185 above*]

‘*Declare as standing on the* *same* *footing*.’—Some people hold the opinion that—“Both—Buddha, etc. and the Veda—are equal sources of right knowledge, hence the knowledge of supersensuous things can be obtained from the words of Omniscient Persons, as also from the Veda”.—To these people it is now pointed out wherein the ease of the *Veda* differs from that of the said Persons.—(3185)
