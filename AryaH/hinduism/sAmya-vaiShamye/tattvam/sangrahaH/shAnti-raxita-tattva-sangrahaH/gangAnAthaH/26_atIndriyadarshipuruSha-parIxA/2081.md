> Being featureless and uncognised even by itself, it can never come into existence. thus it would mean that before its appearance, the omniscience actually existed (and was not brought into existence by any cause).—(3357)



## Kamalaśīla

If yon hold the view that “Omniscience disappears on the appearance of the character of ‘being an entity’ and ‘cognisability’,”—then, in that case, it would mean that, before the appearance of the character of ‘being an entity’, etc. the Omniscience was ‘not an entity’ and was not ‘cognisable’ even by itself; and thus, (*a*) being a *non-entity*, it would be *featureless*, and (b) being *incognisable*, there would be no *self-cognition* of it; which means that the *Omniscience* is never brought about, and does not exist at all; how then can it be said to have appeared *previously* and then ceased? Certainly there can be no appearance, coming into existence, of what is *featureless*. Nor can there be any basis for the existence of what is *not cognised*; as all notions of the existence of things are dependent upon their being *cognised*. What is meant by all this is that the reasoning of the Opponent involves self-contradiction.

Then again, if its previous appearance is admitted, then this *appearance* itself, without any effort on our part, establishes the existence of Omniscience; hence it cannot be right to deny it; otherwise there would be self-contradiction.—This is what is pointed out in the Text, by the words—‘*Before its appearance*, *etc. etc*.’;—i.e. if it is admitted that the *Omniscience* existed before the *appearance*.—(3357)
