## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“How is it known that the Lord Himself expounded the *Dharma*?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3486 above*]

‘*The Highest Good*’—‘follows from which’—such is the construction.

‘*Prosperity*’ is Happiness, and ‘*Highest Good*’ is Final Liberation.

‘*This is what is described as Dharma*’—as is clear from the assertion (in the *Vaiśeṣika-Sūtra*) that ‘Dharma is that from which follows the fulfilment of Prosperity and the Highest Good’.—(3486)
