## Kamalaśīla

It has been declared in the Introductory Verses (*Texts* 5-0) that—‘The great Teacher, the best of Expounders, has expounded the doctrine of the *Intervolved Wheel of Causation*,—having abounding Mercy acquired, during vast eons of time; after bowing to this same Teacher, this, *Compendium of True Doctrines* is being composed’.—Herein it has been asserted that the Doctrine of the ‘Intervolved Wheel of Causation’ is qualified as having been taught by an Omniscient Person.

In support of this notion, the Author proceeds with the mere introduction of this subject:—[*see verse 3124 above*]

*Thus*,—i.e. by the reasonings just set forth,—it is established that the Validity of all Cognitions is *not inherent* in themselves;—hence the existence of a Person knowing all things, even those beyond the reach of the Senses, becomes established without any effort; consequently, for the purpose of proving this no further effort is being made.—(3124)

*Question*:—“How does it become established without effort?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3125-3127 next*]
