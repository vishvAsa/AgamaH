> As a matter of fact, any ‘non-apprehension’—in the case of things of the nature of the ‘pervader’, the ‘cause’ and the ‘nature’ of the omniscient person—would not be operative, because by his very nature, he is imperceptible.—(3277)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“The Omniscient Person may not be *apprehensible* by us; even so, why should the said negative arguments not be urged in proof of his *non-existence*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3277 above*]

Because the Omniscient Person is not apprehensible by you, therefore the ‘pervader’, the ‘cause’ and the ‘nature’ of the Omniscient Person, if not apprehended, cannot be regarded as the ‘non-apprehension of what is apprehensible’. That is to say, the arguments based upon the non-apprehension of the ‘pervader’, of the ‘nature’, or, of the ‘cause’,—which are the first three arguments urged above,—are not applicable.—(3277)
