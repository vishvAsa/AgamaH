> “If proofs were adduced to prove that ‘there is some one who is omniscient’, or that ‘there is omniscience in some man’,—then that would fall short of your proposition. In fact these assertions do not represent what is meant to be proved. There is no purpose in proving what is asserted in the above form,”—(3230-3231)

## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verses 3230-3231*]:

Some people have held the following opinion:—We do not seek to single out any particular person as being *omniscient*; all that we seek to prove is the possibility of there being such a Person; our idea being that there is some one who is omniscient,—or that omniscience does exist in some person—as can be deduced from the fact that there are ascending grades of wisdom.

The answer to these is as follows:—[*see verses 3230-3231 above*]

It has been explained before that the Reason adduced by the Buddhist is Inconclusive; the *Mīmāṃsaka* therefore proceeds to point out the defects in his ‘subject’ (Proposition).

What the Buddhist wishes to prove is the omniscience of his own Teacher,—not merely Omniscience in general. Because, when the Omniscient Person is sought for by the intelligent man,—it cannot be for mere fun. The man seeking for Him does so with the idea that—‘Prom His words I shall find out what *Dharma and Adharma* are and regulate my activity or inactivity accordingly’. Even if the existence of the Omniscient Person in general were proved, it could have no effect upon the activity of the man; because there can be no conviction regarding the words of such a Person until a particular person had been found to be really such. Hence it is the particular Omniscient Person whose existence should be proved by one who wishes to regulate his activity. Thus therefore the general assertion would be far short of the Proposition.

‘*What is meant to he proved*’—i.e. the fact that one wishes to establish.

‘*Saḥ*’—i.e. the particular Omniscient Person, in the person of your own Teacher.

‘*Anayā*’—the Proposition now put forward.

‘*What is asserted*,’—i.e. the vague statement that ‘some Omniscient Person exists’ or ‘omniscience belongs to some one’,—without reference to any particular person. By the proving of such a Proposition, no useful purpose would be served.—(3230-3231)

*Question*:—How so?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3232 next*]

[*verse 3232*]:

*Question*:—Why cannot such a Person be got at?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3233 next*]

[*verse 3233*]:

Because so long as the Omniscience of *Buddha himself* is not proved, there can be no certainty regarding the truthfulness of His Word.—On the proving of *some* Omniscient Person in general, the truthfulness of *Buddha’s* words does not become established. Because the requisite Invariable Concomitance is not there.—(3233)

The same idea is further elucidated:—[*see verse 3234 next*]
