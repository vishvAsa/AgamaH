## Kamalaśīla

Not accepting this view (that the Lord has the direct *Perception* of all things), the Author asserts the following, in answer to what the other party has asserted under *Text* 3175 to the effect that—“He alone sees things who sees them through the eternal Word”.—[*see verse 3477 above*]

The wise men—i.e. the Buddhists—have declared that the knowledge of supersensuous things, belonging to the Blessed Lord, which directly envisages all things, is brought about by the force of his meditations,—through the aforementioned Inference, independently of the Revealed Word;—and that it does not proceed from any scriptures compiled by men. Hence as this view is not accepted by us, the objection does not affect us.—(3477)
