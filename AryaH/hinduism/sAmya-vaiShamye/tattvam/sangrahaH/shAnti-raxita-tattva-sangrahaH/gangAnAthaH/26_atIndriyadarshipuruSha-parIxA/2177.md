> It is indeed a great delusion that has been brought about by Buddha in his disciples who, during the present life itself, have attained, through it, prosperity, as also the highest stage of the alleviation of all afflictions of the mind!—(3566)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued, under *Text* 3225, that—“The teaching of Buddha, etc. might have been for the purpose of deluding their disciples, etc, etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3566 above*]

‘*Dṛṣṭe*’—during the present life.

‘*Prosperity*’—in the shape of lasting health, vigour and so forth;—these ‘*they have attained*’—such is the construction.

‘*Alleviation of all afflictions of the Mind*’—i.e. the cessation of Love, Hatred and other defects.

‘*Through it*’—Through the proper following of the Teachings of the Lord, regarding Mantras, Meditations, etc.

‘*A great delusion has been brought about*’—This is figurative; the sense is—if you regard this as ‘delusion’, then it is you yourself who are deluded,—inasmuch as you regard what is *not delusion*, as *delusion*.—(3566)
