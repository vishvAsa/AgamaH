> We are not affirming the existence of the omniscient person on the basis of scriptural declarations. When the inferential reason is available, who would make an assertion on the basis of verbal authority?—(3510)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 3187, that—‘There is no scriptural declaration affirming an eternal Omniscient Person, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3510 above*]

So long as Inference on the basis of the capacity of things is available, who would seek to establish the existence of things on the basis of mere verbal assertion which is entirely dependent upon the whim of man? It is for this reason that we are not proving the existence of the Omniscient Person on the basis of scriptural declarations;—in fact, we are doing it on the basis of *Inference*; and this has been already explained before.—(3510)
