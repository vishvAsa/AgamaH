> Who else except the fool can regard the teaching of the Buddhas as having its source in delusion,—when it has been proved to be the flawless exposition of the path to heaven and the final goal?—(3565)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued, under *Text* 3217, that—“the teaching of *Buddha* and others is capable of another explanation also, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3565 above*]

It cannot bo admitted that the Teaching is capable of another explanation. Because the flawless exposition of the Path to Heaven and Final Liberation cannot have its source in Delusion;—and that the Teaching of the Blessed Lord is flawless has been proved by all the investigations and tests herein made.

‘*Fool*’—i.e. *Kumārila*. He is a fool if he entertains the idea referred to.—(3565)
