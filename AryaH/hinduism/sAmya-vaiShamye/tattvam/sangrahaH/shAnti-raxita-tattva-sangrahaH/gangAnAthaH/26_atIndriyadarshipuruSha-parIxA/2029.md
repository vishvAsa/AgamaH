> When there is absence of (*a*) the ‘cause’ and (*b*) the ‘pervader’, it is only right and proper that there should be absence of (*a*) the ‘caused’ and (*b*) the ‘pervaded’; (*a*) because the birth of the one proceeds from the other, and (*b*) because one is of the same nature as the other;—for example, when there is absence of (*a*) the fire and (*b*) the tree, there is absence of (*a*) the smoke and (*b*) the ‘mango-tree, etc.’—If it were not so, (*a*) the one could not be the cause of the other, and (*b*) there would be diversity.—(3271-3272)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“Even when there is absence of the ‘Cause’ and the ‘Pervader’, why should that imply the absence of something else?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3271-3272 above*]

‘*Caused*’—that which has a cause; i.e. the effect;—the *Dvandva* compound is between ‘caused’ and ‘pervaded’;—these two are construed with the foregoing ‘*nivṛttiryujyate*’,—the meaning being that ‘it is only right and proper that there should be absence of the *Caused* and the *Pervaded*.

The reason for this is supplied—‘*Because the birth of the one*, *etc. etc*.’—(*a*) When there is absence of, *Cause*, there is absence of *Effect*, because the *Effect* derives its existence from the *Cause; e.g*. when there is absence of Fire, there is absence of Smoke. (b) Similarly when there is absence of the *Pervader*, there is absence of the *Pervaded*; because the Pervaded is of the same essence as the Pervader,—both being of the same nature; *e.g*. when there is absence of the *Tree*, there is absence of the *Mango*, *Khadira* and other particular Trees; because it is only a particular *Tree* that is known as the ‘mango’.

If it were not so,—i.e. if on the absence of the Cause, the Effect were not absent,—then the Cause would not be a true cause at all. Because when one thing can be present even when the other is absent, the latter cannot be the cause of the former; otherwise, there would be absurdities. Similarly when one thing is not absent when the other is absent, they cannot be of the same nature, e.g. the *Cow* and the *Gavaya*. Hence it follows that when the Pervader is absent, the Pervaded must be absent,—and where the Cause is absent, the Effect must be absent; it would not imply the absence of anything else; as that would lead to incongruities.

This has been thus declared—‘Thus when a certain nature is related to a thing, its absence would imply the absence of that thing; and the absence of the cause would imply the absence of the effect; because of the infallibility of their relationship. If it were not so, why should the absence of the one mean the absence of the other? Because a man has no *horse*, does it mean that he should have no *Cow* either?’—(3271-3272)
