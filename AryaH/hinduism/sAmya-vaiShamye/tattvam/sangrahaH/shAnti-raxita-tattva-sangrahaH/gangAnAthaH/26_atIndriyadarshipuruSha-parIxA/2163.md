## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3535*]:

Bays the Opponent—“The *knowledge of self* there mentioned is that consisting in self-Cognition, not that of the Spirit functioning within. How then can our argument be futile (proving what is already admitted)?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3535 above*]

*Question*:—“How is it known that there is knowledge of pure Consciousness only?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3536-3537 above*]

‘*Before*’—Under the chapter (23) on the ‘External World’.

‘*Saṃsāra*, *etc*.’—i.e. whose knowledge is not conducive to Births and Rebirths.—(3536-3537)

*Question*:—“What are those Teachings that were promulgated under Their guidance?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3538-3540 next*]
