> As regards the argument that “what is asserted by one who knows only a part cannot be regarded as the assertion of the omniscient person”,—the answer to this has already been given, that it would be due to the actual presence of the knowledge of all things.—(3593)

## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3593*]:

It has been argued under *Text* 3240, that—“What has been asserted by one who knows only a part cannot be the assertion of the Omniscient Person”.

The following *Text* points out that this also has been already answered:—[*see verse 3593 above*]

The same explanation is reiterated in the following—[*see verses 3594-3595 above*]

[*verses 3594-3595*]:

‘*The man of limited vision*’—i.e. one who is not omniscient.

‘*Proceed from his knowledge*, *etc. etc*.’—the knowledge of those things—Heart, etc.—from which proceeds the assertion. The two negatives ‘*na-na*’ indicate that the words *do* proceed from the said knowledge of the things.

‘*The same, etc. etc*.’—That also would be reliable as proceeding from the said actual knowledge.

*Question*:—“If this is so, then what would be the difference between the words of the man who knows little and the words of Buddha, the Omniscient?”

*Answer:—‘The difference would lie, etc. etc*.’—(3594-3595)

The same idea is further clarified:—[*see verse 3596 above*]

‘*Asya*’—of the words of *Buddha*.

‘*Tasya*’—of the words of the man who knows only a part of things.—(3596)
