> “For the proving of the existence of one omniscient person, it would be necessary to assume several omniscient persons; and if a single one of these happen to be not-omniscient, he would not be able to recognise the omniscient person.”—(3191)



## Kamalaśīla

The following view might be held—There have been innumerable *Tathāgatas* (Enlightened Ones) in the past and they are going to appear in the future; and it is from the words of one of these that we derive the knowledge of the omniscience of the other; and that of the omniscience of the former from the words of a third, and so forth.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3191 above*]

If for the purpose of proving the existence of one Omniscient Person, one goes on following up a series of Omniscient Persons, no man with limited vision could ever get at certainty regarding the Omniscient Person,—even at the end of his whole life; hence several Omniscient Persons would have to be assumed. [*See Ślokavārtika* 1. 1. 2, 135.]—(3191)
