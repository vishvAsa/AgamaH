> “They are equipped with eternal qualities and eternal functions; hence there is no incongruity in these being mentioned in the eternal Veda.—On the other hand, Buddha, etc. are perishable beings, hence it is not possible for them to be mentioned in the eternal scripture. And when the scripture is held to be eternal, the assuming of the omniscient person is entirely futile.”—(3211-3212)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*To be mentioned in the eternal scripture*’—Because, if they were so capable, the relationship between the Word and its meaning would have to be regarded as ephemera; not-eternal; because the other party does not admit of an eternal scripture;—and because, if they did admit of it, the postulating of the Omniscient Person would be entirely futile.—(3211-3212)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verses 3213-3214 next*]
