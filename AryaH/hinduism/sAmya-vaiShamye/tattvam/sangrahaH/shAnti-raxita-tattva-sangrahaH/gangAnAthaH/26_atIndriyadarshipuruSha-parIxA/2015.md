## Kamalaśīla

As regards *Manu* and others, these were learned in the Veda; hence their teachings regarding *Dharma*, *etc*. are all based upon the Veda,—they are not independent of it.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3228 above*]

The tree Vedas,—*Ṛk*, *Yajuṣ* and *Sāman*—are called ‘*Trayī*’, ‘Triad’; those who know these are ‘*Trayīvid*’, ‘Vedic scholars’—*Brāhmaṇas*.

These Teachers are such as have their compilations accepted by Vedic scholars.

The reason for this acceptance is stated—‘*Their assertions proceed from the Veda*’. They are persons whose assertions have their source in the Veda.—(3228)

*Question*:—How is this also known?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3229 next*]
