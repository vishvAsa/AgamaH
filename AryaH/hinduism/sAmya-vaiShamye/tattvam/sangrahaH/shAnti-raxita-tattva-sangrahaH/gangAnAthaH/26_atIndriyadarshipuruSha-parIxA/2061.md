> It is not known to the worldly man; when known, it sets aside all evil; for those who are devoted to its practice, it is a veritable mine of valuable qualities. If the poets know this highest truth, then who is there who would not regard them, knowing the primordial matter, the spirit and other things, as omniscient?—(3323-3324)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* point out that the True Doctrine has never been known before by people at the stage of the common man:—[*see verses 3323-3324 above*]

‘*Not known to*’—not practised by—‘*worldly man*’—common people.

*Question*:—“In what way does it benefit people—that it has been taught by the Lord?”

*Answer*:—‘*When known*, *etc*. *etc*—when it becomes ‘*known*’—directly and realised,—it sets aside the whole lot of evils, such as the Afflictions, Birth and so forth. Even subsequently, when it is *practised*, it brings about excellent qualities.

If such a truth, leading as it does to the fulfilment of the Highest Good, is known to the Poets,—they may very well be ‘omniscient’; we do not for a moment think that omniscience is confined to a single Person; in fact, whoever is cognisant of the said Truth, he alone, no one else, is held by us to be omniscient. Such knowledge, however, does not belong to the Poets; hence the contingency that has been urged does not arise.—(3323-3324)
