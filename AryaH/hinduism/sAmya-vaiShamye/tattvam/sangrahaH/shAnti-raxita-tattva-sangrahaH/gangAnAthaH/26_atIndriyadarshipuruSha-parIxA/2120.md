> Nor is the teaching the assertion of demented people with disordered minds; because it is found to be in a regular sequence and is an excellent fulfiller of its purpose.—(3458)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—“it is possible that the Teaching might have proceeded from Delusion; and hence the Reason put forward is Inconclusive”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3458 above*]

Demented persons with disordered minds cannot make any such long assertions as appear in well-ordered sequence, as a connected whole accomplishing the purposes of man.

Thus it becomes established that there has been some one who possessed the direct knowledge of *Dharma* and allied matters.—(3458)
