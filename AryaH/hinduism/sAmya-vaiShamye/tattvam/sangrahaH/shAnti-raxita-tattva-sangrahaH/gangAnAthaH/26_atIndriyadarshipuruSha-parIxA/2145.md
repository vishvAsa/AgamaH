> It is quite possible that what existed in the past is not there in the present because the whole set of its causes is not present. Why should it not be that such a person existed in the past,—like Rāma and others?—(3508)



## Kamalaśīla

Granting that the Corroborative Instance is admissible (and the Omniscient Person does not exist at the present time),—even so, mere apprehension cannot rightly prove the existence of what is desired.—This is pointed out in the following.—[*see verse 3508 above*]

What truth can there be in any such premiss as that ‘what does not exist in the Present could not have existed in the Past’, For instance, the mere fact that *Rāma*, *Bharata* and others do not exist at the *present* time cannot justify the inference that they did not exist in the *past*. Thus, in view of the ease of *Rāma* and others, the Reason put forward by the other party is ‘Inconclusive’.—(3508)
