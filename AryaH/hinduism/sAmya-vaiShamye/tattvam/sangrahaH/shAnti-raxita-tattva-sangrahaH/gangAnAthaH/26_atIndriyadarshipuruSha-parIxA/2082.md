## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—“It may be that *Incognisability* and the rest are not incompatible with *Omniscience*: even so they indicate the nonexistence of the Omniscient Person.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3358 above*]

Some people argue as follows Even though ‘Cognisability’, etc. are not incompatible with ‘Omniscience’, yet the character of ‘being a speaker’ is certainly incompatible with it; because Omniscience cannot co-exist along with ‘Speakership’, of which ‘Conceptual Content’ is the indirect Cause; because on the principle that ‘one cannot utter words without previous cogitation and thinking’. Conceptual Content is the cause of *Speaking*; and as all Conceptual Content is associated with verbal expression, it cannot apprehend the forms of things,—this latter being amenable to only such cognition as is free from Conceptual Content; thus during the conceptual stage, there being no apprehension of the form of things, there can be no *Omniscience*. Thus Omniscience being contrary to (incompatible with) *Speakership*, the presence of one would mean the absence of the other, due to the non-apprehension of its Cause. So that our Reason is not ‘Inconclusive—This Reason, ‘Speakership’ is implied by the term ‘*ādi*’ in the sentence ‘one who has the characters of being knowable, cognisable, etc. etc.’ (under *Text* 3157).”

This is the view anticipated in *Texts* 3359-3360, and answered in *Texts* 3361-3362, as follows:—[*see verses 3359-3362 next*]
