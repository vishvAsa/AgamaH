> Whatever things are conceived become clearly manifest, at the completion of the conception; as is found in the case of the objects of desire;—all things are conceived by great sages, for a long time and several times, in their real form, as ‘void’, ‘no-soul’ and so forth. That the ‘void’, ‘no-soul’ and the rest are the real forms has been proved before. Hence as arising out of the conception of really existent things, the said conception has been rightly regarded as right and valid.—(3441—3443)



## Kamalaśīla

Or again, the character of ‘being an entity’ and so forth, which you have put forward (under *Text* 3167 *et seq*.) as reasons for denying the existence of the Omniscient Person,—are themselves enough to prove His existence. In order to show this, the Author proceeds to point out the Invariable Concomitance of the said characters (with *Omniscience*):—[*see verses 3441-3443 above*]

The principal argument to be expounded later on, may be formulated thus:—Things that are possessed of the characters of ‘being entity’, ‘being cognisable’ and so forth are those that become clearly manifest in a single cognition which forms the highest stage of conception;—e.g. the loved woman, the son and the thief who are conceived of by men who are obsessed by the feelings of love, etc.,—all things are possessed of the said characters of ‘being entity’ and the rest;—hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—The Reason adduced here cannot be said to be ‘Inconclusive’; because whatever thing, real or unreal, is conceived of, is always found to bring about, at the culmination of the conception, the clear cognition of that thing; e.g. the man in love has the clear cognition of the woman he loves;—all things are conceived of in their real form, for a long time, by persons who are absorbed in mercy;—hence this is a Reason based on the nature of things.

This shows that *Conception* is invariably concomitant with the resultant *dear cognition*.

*Question*:—The clear cognition of things is independent of other things; how is it known that the ‘Void’, ‘No-Soul’ and the rest constitute the *real* form of things?”

*Answer*:—‘*That the Void*, *No-Soul and the rest*, *etc*. *etc*.’—(3441-3443)
