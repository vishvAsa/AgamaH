> His knowledge could not have been derived through inference, as there had been no previous perception; and hence no relationship with the inferential indicative could be recognised.—(3454)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“It may be that they have spoken of these things after having come to know them through *Inference*.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3454 above*]

Nothing can form the object of Inference of which the relationship to the Indicative has not been recognised; and it is not possible to have any definite notion of the relationship of any Inferential Indicative to a thing which is entirely beyond perception.—(3454)
