> Other people recognise the ‘soul’ as something permanent, resembling the pure rock-crystal; this idea of these people is clearly wrong, as the existence of the permanent ‘soul’ has been rejected. If the cognition envisaging the soul proceeds from one’s own soul, then there should be the cognition of all souls at one and the same time.—If it does not proceed from one’s own soul,—or if it is regarded as eternal,—then it could not envisage the soul at all:—being, in this respect like the cognitions of other persons.—(3541-3543)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Other people’—Keśava* and others.

Under the Chapter on the ‘Soul’, the existence of the Soul has been rejected: any Cognition of it must be wrong and hence impure.

Further, the knowledge of these people relating to the eternal Soul that is spoken of,—does this knowledge or Cognition proceed from the person’s own Soul or not? These are the only two alternatives possible. In the former case, all his Cognitions should appear simultaneously, as their efficient cause would be there.—In the latter case, is the Cognition eternal or not-eternal? In both cases, that Soul would only be a replica of his own Soul, and hence, like the Cognition of other people, it could not envisage that Soul.—(3541-3543)
