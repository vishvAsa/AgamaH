## Kamalaśīla

Though the definition of the Omniscient Person is stated in the general form that—‘That Person is *Omniscient* who knows the whole world in its real form of being *without Soul* and the rest’,—it follows by implication that the particular person who fulfills the conditions of this definition is meant to be Omniscient; and hence it is not necessary to specify that Person. As a matter of fact, it is only our Blessed Lord—and none else—who fulfills all the conditions of the said definition of the ‘Omniscient Person’; as it is only He who has expounded in various ways the truth regarding what should be sought for and what rejected,—along with the means of the same, in the shape of the ‘Four Truths’ in their perfect form. If a man does not know a thing, he cannot expound teachings that are perfect and true as regards the real state of that thing.—This has been thus declared—‘The expounding of the imperceptible to be secured and the means thereof is an extremely difficult task’,—(3337)
