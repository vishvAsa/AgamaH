> Whatever he wishes to know he comes to know it without fail;—such is his power, as he has shaken off all evil. He knows things either simultaneously or in succession, just as he wishes; and having secured the knowledge of all things, he becomes the lord.—(3628-3629) 
>
> Or, he knows all that is knowable, in the shape of the ‘four truths’, by means of his sixteen ‘cognitions’, in succession, and on that account he is omniscient. When this cognition of the lord thus appears in succession—not even a single moment has to be awaited; what to say, my friend, of a hundred years!—(3630-3631)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verses 3628-3629*]:

There are some people who hold that there are Persons who become omniscient at will; under their opinion also, there is no incongruity in what has been said above.—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verses 3628-3629 above*]

The following *Texts* point out that there is no incongruity even under the view that the Lord’s Cognition of things is *successive*:—[*see verses 3630-3631 above*]

[*3630-3631*]:

‘*By means of Sixteen Cognitions*’—i.e. by Forgivenesses’ and ‘Cognitions’: There are *eight* ‘Forgivenesses’,—in the shape of the Forgiveness of Pain, *Dharma*, Knowledge and so forth;—and there are *eight* ‘Cognitions’, in the shape of the cognition of Pain, *Dharma*, Knowledge and so forth;—all this is clear from the declaration that—‘The Truth is divided sixteen -fold’,

‘*Even a single moment*’.—The lowest measure of time is called ‘*Kalā* 120 *Kalās* make one *Kṣaṇa*; 60 *Kṣaṇas* make one *Lava*.

‘*My friend*’—is a form of address.

‘*Abda’—is year*.’—(3630-3631)
