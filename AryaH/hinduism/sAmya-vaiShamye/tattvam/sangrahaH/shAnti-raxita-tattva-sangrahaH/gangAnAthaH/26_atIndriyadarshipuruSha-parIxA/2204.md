> What is apprehended by the mystic consciousness is not that universal which is incapable of being spoken of as ‘that’ or ‘not-that’ and so forth, and which other people have regarded as real’.—(3635)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If what is meant by Mystic Consciousness envisaging *Specific Individuality* is that it apprehends that Universal which we have declared to be ‘illusory’, not capable of being described as *that* or *not*-*that*,—and which other philosophers have regarded as *real*,—then the said idea cannot be accepted.

This is what the Author points out in the following:—[*see verse 3635 above*]

‘*And so forth*’ is meant to include ‘eternal’ or ‘non-eternal’, etc. etc.—(3635)

*Question*:—“Why cannot there be apprehension of that Universal?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3636 next*]
