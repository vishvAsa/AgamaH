> ‘Wisdom’ and the rest hate been made the ‘subject’, and then the inferential indicative has been set forth; hence it is not true that ‘no indicative is recognised’,—and yet we are not seeking to prove the existence (of the person).—(3509)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 3180, that—“no Indicative is recognised as part of the Subject which could lead to His inference”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3509 above*]

Under *Text* 3414 above, *Wisdom*, etc. have been made the ‘subject’ of the Reasoning, and the necessary Inferential Indicative has been asserted; hence it is not right to assert that “no Indicative is recognised”.
