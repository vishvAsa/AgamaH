> When there is a defect in the eye, there is no cognition, even though the thing is there; and even when the eye is free from defects, there is no cognition, because the thing is not there;—as in the case of things like the jar.—Thus, inasmuch as mere non-apprehension (absence of cognition) is found in both cases, it is far better to hold that it is doubt that arises from the non-apprehension of the omniscient person.—(3301-3302)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“In no case is it found that the Means of Cognition are not applicable to both *existence* and *non-existence of* a thing”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3301-3302 above*]

Even when the object, Jar for instance, is there, if the man is without the Eye, he has no cognition of it;—so also, even when the Eye is perfect, if the object is not there,—in the sense that it is not close *by*,—*there is no cognition of it*; this clause has to be construed here also;—this is just what happens in the case of the Jar which is not there in a suitable place.

‘*Mere* Non-apprehension’—i.e. non-apprehension without the qualification of ‘perceptibility’ of the thing concerned.

‘*Found in both cases*’—i.e. in the case of *existence* and in the case of *non-existence*.

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.

‘*It* *is* *far belter*, *etc. etc*.’—better than searching for a perfect source. For instance, when things have had the idea of their being due to a perfect source cut off by wrong cognition,—there may be a desire to look out for the perfect source; as has been declared in the words—‘Two perceptions describe the junction, and two perceptions give rise to the desire’ (?)—It is for this reason that our Teachers affirm the presence of Doubt in such cases, in the words—‘If it is asked what is the proof for His existence?—the answer is that, for this same reason, let the matter remain in Doubt’,—(3301-3302)
