> Then again, the grains that originally grew out of the seeds of the same kind, turn out gradually to be vastly superior, through the superior treatment that they receive. And as in the case of the vrīhi and other grains, so in the case of mercy, wisdom and other qualities also, it is quite possible that when these latter, endowed with the said character, reach their higher stages, there results omniscience.—(3414-3415)



## Kamalaśīla

Or, the grains that originally grew out of the same kind of seeds are found, on undergoing special treatment, to become vastly superior; and just as this happens in the case of grains, so it does in the case of the qualities of Mercy, Wisdom, etc. also. So this is a Reason based on the nature of things. As before, here also the Reason is not ‘Inconclusive’ or ‘Inadmissible’. ‘*Mali*’—wisdom.

‘*Endowed with the said character*’—i.e. originally growing out of the same kind of cause.—(3414-3415)
