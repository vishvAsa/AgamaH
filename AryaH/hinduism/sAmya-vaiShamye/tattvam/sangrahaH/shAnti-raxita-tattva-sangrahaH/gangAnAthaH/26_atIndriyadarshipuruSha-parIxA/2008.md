> “Rather than admit the idea of the scripture indicating the omniscient person, it is far better to accept the idea that it indicates dharma. Because the clear knowledge of dharma (directly from the Veda) is superior to the unclear knowledge derived indirectly through the knowledge of the omniscient person mentioned in the Veda.—Thus it cannot be maintained that the omniscient person is spoken of in the scriptures.”—(3213-3214)



## Kamalaśīla

Rather than entertain the idea that the Eternal Scripture mentions the Omniscient Person, it is better to accept the idea that Dharma is taught by that Scripture.

On the other hand, the Dharma learnt through the knowledge of the Omniscient Person mentioned in the Scripture is indirect and indistinct; because the said Person has retired into *Nirvāṇa* and cannot be clearly perceptible. Even when He had not retired into *Nirvāṇa*, He would have no desires, and hence could not impart any teachings. Even if He did impart teachings, these could not be heard by all men at all times and places,—(3213-3214)
