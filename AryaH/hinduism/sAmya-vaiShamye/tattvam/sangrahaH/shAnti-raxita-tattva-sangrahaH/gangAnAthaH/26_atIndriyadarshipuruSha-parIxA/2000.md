> “The description that we meet with in *itihāsas* and *purāṇas* of Brahmā being omniscient and of his knowledge and dispassion as untrammelled,—all this should be understood in the figurative sense,—like the commendatory declarations relating to *mantras*.—Or, the ‘untrammelled knowledge’ that is spoken may be taken as referring to the knowledge of *dharma* and other matters relating to the particular context;—what is meant is that his knowledge of such things as ‘ditty’, ‘property’, ‘pleasure’ and ‘liberation’, is ‘untrammelled’; it cannot refer to all things.”—(3199-3201)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—In the *Itihāsas* and *Purāṇas*, Brahmā and other Beings have been described as *omniscient*; as we read there of Brahma’s knowledge and dispassion being ‘unobstructed’. How then can it be said that the existence of the Omniscient Person is not vouched for by the Scriptural Word?

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3199-3201 above*]

Just as, in regard to Vedic *Mantras* there are Commendatory Declarations, so in the *Itihāsa* and *Purāṇa*, the assertion of the omniscience of *Brahmā* and other Beings, should be taken as Commendatory Declarations. When a set of words directly expressing one thing is taken as expressing something else, it is called ‘*arthavāda*’, ‘Figurative or Commendatory Declaration’.

Or the meaning may be that the knowledge of *Brahmā* is untrammelled so far as the things spoken of in the *Itihāsa* and *Purāṇa* are concerned,—such as Duty, Property, Pleasure and Liberation; and it does not refer to the knowledge of *all* *things*.—(3199-3201)
