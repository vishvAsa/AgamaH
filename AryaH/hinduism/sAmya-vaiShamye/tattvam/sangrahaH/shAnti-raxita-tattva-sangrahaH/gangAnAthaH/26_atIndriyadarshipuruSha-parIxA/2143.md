> As regards the argument that the omniscient person is not seen at the present time—by you or by all men,—this has been already answered in detail. As regards non-perception by you, that, by itself, is ‘fallible’, ‘inconclusive’, as regards non-perception by all other men, that must remain always doubtful.—(3503-3504) 
>
> “His existence in the past cannot be presumed in the way in which his non-existence has been presumed”—This assertion in regard even to the past cannot be right; because such denial is impossible.—(3505)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verses 3503-3504*]:

It has been argued under *Text* 3186 that,—“The Omniscient Person is not seen by us at the present time, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3503-3504 above*]

[*verse 3505*]:

It has been argued further by Kumārila (*Ślokavārtika*) that—“That *He existed in the past* cannot be presumed in the way in which it is presumed that He *did not* exist in the past”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3505 above*]

The assertion that—“The denial can be made to the effect that the Omniscient Person *did not* exist in the past,—in the same way, it cannot be presumed that He *did* exist in the past”;—Such an assertion is most improper; because even in reference to the *past*, the denial of the said Person is not possible.—The term ‘even’ implies that it is not possible in reference to the *Present* and the *Future* also. It has been already pointed out that the mere fact that a certain thing is not seen cannot justify the conclusion that it does not exist.—(3505)
