> All things must be regarded as clearly manifested by the one cognition that represents the highest stage of the conception,—because of such reasons as ‘being entities’, ‘being existent’ and the like,—like the beloved woman and others.—Similarly, when the certainty regarding a thing is capable of being proved by such reasons as ‘being an entity’, ‘being existent’, ‘being produced’ and the like,——who is there who will not regard it as well-established?



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus established the Invariable Concomitance by pointing out that the *capacity of being clearly manifested* is connected with mere *conception*, the author now proceeds to point out the main purport of his argument:—[*see verses 3447-3449 above*]

The highest stage of the development of the Conception is represented by the cognition in question. Even in the absence of co-ordination, the *Bahuvrīhi* compound is based upon the sense of the words. The meaning thus is that—all things are such as are clearly manifested in the single cognition that represents the highest stage of the Conception.—And the Person in whose one cognition all things become clearly manifested in this way is one ‘*whose single cognition comprehends all that is knowahle*’, and who is ‘*the crest-jewel of all Suras and Asuras*’;—and this Person is thus proved to be ‘omniscient’.—(3447-3449)
