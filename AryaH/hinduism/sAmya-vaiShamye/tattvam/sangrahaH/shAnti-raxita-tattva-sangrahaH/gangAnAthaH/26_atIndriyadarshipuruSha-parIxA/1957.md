>
> “There are certain effects (spoken of) which, if found impossible in relation to the object denoted by the word, are applied to the word itself; hence the man who knows the word ‘all’, may be called ‘all-knowing’ in name.”—(3130)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3129*]:

“Further, if you Buddhists also urge, against us, the possibility of regarding, as ‘all-knowing’, the man who knows all things except *Dharma and A dharma*,—then that is entirely superfluous.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3129 above*]

*Question*:—What is that ‘all’ that relates to the present context?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3130 above*]

[*verse 3130*]:

“For example, in Grammar, we find such assertions as ‘*agnerdṛk*’ and so forth which lay own such effects as the addition, of certain affixes; now this effect cannot be brought about in the thing denoted by the words concerned; consequently, by implication, they are applied to the words themselves, by Grammarians.—In the same manner, if you also, finding that it is impossible for any one to know *all things*, explain the term ‘all’ appearing in the statement of your doctrine, as standing for the *word* ‘all’,—so that the man knowing the *word* ‘all’ would be ‘*all*-knowing’,—then this may be so *in name*,—i.e. in *name* only; for no one can prevent a man applying to words any meaning he likes; as the *naming* of things depends upon the mere whim of man—(3130)
