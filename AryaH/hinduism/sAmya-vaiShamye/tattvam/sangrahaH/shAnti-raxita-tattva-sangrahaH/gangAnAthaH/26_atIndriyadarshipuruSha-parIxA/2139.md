> Thus then, under other systems, there is just a little ‘welfare’ (prosperity) secured through the destruction of the ‘ten sins’;—the attainment of the highest good there is none in the least: and the reason for this lies in the fact that all these are associated with the notion of the ‘real existence’ (of the soul) and hence the root of the ‘afflictions’ is not removed.—(3496-3497)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* sum up the Author’s position:—[*see verses 3496-3497 above*]

‘*Through the destruction of the Ten Sins*’—These sins are—(1) Killing of life, (2) Taking what has not been given, (3) Indulgence in (sexual) desire, (4) Dishonest Behaviour, (5) Lying, (6) Backbiting, (7) Cruelty, (8) Incoherent Talking, (9) Malice or Deceitfulness, and (10) Wrong knowledge,—Or they may be the following:—(1) Not saving others, (2) Not giving, (3) Not serving, (4) Lying, (5) Harsh words, (6) Injuring others, (7) Neglect of study, (8) Faithlessness, (9) Mercilessness, and (10) Undue Desire.—The ‘opposites’ of these are the ‘Ten noble Paths’.—When these said ‘Ten sins’ are destroyed, there follows *Dispassion* and thenee the ‘Ten Noble Paths’.

‘*Just a little*’—Inasmuch as it is preceded by the aforesaid ‘*volte face*’—the man lapses away very quickly.

The ‘root of the Afflictions’ is the notion of the existence (of the Soul).—(3496-3497)
