> If the assertion of these teachers regarding the ‘*syādvāda*’ and other doctrines be said to have been made with some (other) motive,—then (we ask)—what is that form of things which they hold to be real and true?—(3331)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“If these Teachers have taught false doctrines,—even so, it cannot be deduced from this that they are addicted to the false notions of things; because it is open to men to act contrary to their convictions,—the tendencies of men being peculiarly divergent; consequently, your Reason is ‘doubtful—hence—inadmissible’.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3331 above*]

If it be said that—“it is with some other motive that these Teachers have asserted the doctrines of *Syādvāda*, etc., which are against all canons of truth”;—then (our answer is that) let them assert the doctrines; we do not wish to prove that *Vardhamāna*, etc. are, by themselves, *non-omniscient*; all that we have done is to put forward the diversity of opinion among these Teachers, as a proof in answer to the question that you, taking your stand upon the mutually contradictory doctrines taught by Kapila and others, have asked—“If *Buddha* is omniscient, what is the proof that *Kapila* is not so?” Hence our Reason cannot be ‘inadmissible’.

Then again, if what has been asserted by them has some other motive behind it, then it behoves you to explain what, according to them, is the *real* nature of things.—(3331)
