> In the case of things that are mutually exclusive by their nature, or in those that can never coexist,—there may be incompatibility; but there is no incompatibility in both figuring in the one and the same cognition; because there is perception through the eye of such contraries as (*a*) the pure and the impure things, (*b*) the serpent and the peacock and so forth.—(3623-3624)



## Kamalaśīla

Incompatibility among things is of two kinds—(1) mutual exclusiveness, and (2) non-coexistence. Those things that are *mutually exclusive*,—their unification is clearly incompatible; those again that are *non-coexistent*, their *coexistence* is incompatible. But by figuring in the same cognition, things do not become either *unified* or *coexistent*. Hence there is no incompatibility in their figuring in the same cognition. In fact, it is actually seen that even incompatible things figure in the same cognition; for instance, the Pure and the Impure things, which are mutually exclusive,—and the Serpent and the Peacock, which can never live together,—are perceived, through the Eye, at one and the same time.—‘*And so forth*’ includes such pair of opposites as *Light and Shade* and the rest.—(3623-3624)
