## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued, under *Text* 3174, that—“The capacity of Perception has never been found applicable to the future, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3473 above*]

‘*As has been pointed out in the chapter*, *etc. etc*.’—This is what has been said under that chapter:—All things, directly or indirectly, bear to each other the relation of cause and effect; the *Present* thing is always, directly or indirectly, the *effect* of the Past, and the *cause* of the Future thing. What the Mystics do is to apprehend all things by direct Perception, and thereby determine the Past and the Future entity also, on the basis of the ‘chain of entities’, past and future, which are related as cause and effect respectively,—by means of conceptions that are object-less and hence not entirely in conformity with reality, or purely worldly,—which follow on the wake of the said Perception.

This is what has been declared in Texts 1853-1855 under the chapter on the ‘Three points of Time’—[For *translation* see, *in loco*, above].—(3473)

The above is not accepted by the *Sautrāntika* (section of Buddhists), who hold that the Blessed Lord has the direct perception of *all things*. Hence the Author sets forth the view of the *Sautrāntika* in the following—[*see verse 3474 next*]
