Then again, the fact that *Manu* and others imparted their teachings to you alone does not redound to your credit; in fact, it only indicates the dullness of your intelligence.—This is pointed out in the following;—[*see verses 3582-3583 above*]

‘*Vedādhītijaḍa*’—Those who have become ‘*jaḍa*’—dull-witted—by the ‘*adhiti*’—reading—of the Veda; i.e. those whose powers of discriminating things had been set aside by the reading of the Veda.

‘*For some reason*’.—Somehow.—(3582-3583)
