> In regard to the luminous consciousness, not marred by the two forms,—who could entertain any wrong notions, if his mind is not deluded by the two forms?—As soon as there is recognition of the ‘soul-less-ness’ of both,—all those defects of love, hate and the like which have their source in the thoughts of women and such things, disappear without effort.—This is the highest truth which the ‘expounder of unity’ propounded,—which brings all kinds of prosperity, far beyond the reach’ of Keśava and others.—(3538-3540)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*If his mind is not deluded*, *etc*.’—i.e. who has got rid of all obsession of the *apprehender* and the *apprehended*.

‘*As soon as there is recognition, etc*. *etc*.’—i.e. the recognition of the fact that the (1) Body and (2) All other things are *without soul*;—or it may mean the recognition of the ‘*nairātmya*’—unreality—‘*of both*’—i.e. of the *apprehended* as well as the *Apprehender*.

‘*Far beyond the reach of, etc. etc*.’—‘*Keśava*’ stands for *Hari* (*Viṣṇu*).—‘*And others*’ includes ‘*Īśvara'* and the rest.—(3538-3540)

*Question*:—“Why is not the *self-Cognition of Keśava* and others also regarded as pure?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3541-3543 next*]
