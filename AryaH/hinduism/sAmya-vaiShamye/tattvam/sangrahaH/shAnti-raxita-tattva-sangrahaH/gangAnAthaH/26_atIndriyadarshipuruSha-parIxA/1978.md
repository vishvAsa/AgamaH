> “Similarly great superiority is often found in men, in the matter of scientific discussions; but that alone does not prove that the man is an expert in all sciences.”—(3164) 
>
> “When one has learnt grammar, his intelligence goes very ear in the matter of correct and incorrect forms of words; but not in the matter of the determination of stars, dates, eclipses and such subjects.—Similarly, the astronomer, though superior in the matter of the knowledge of the moon, the sun, eclipses and so forth, is incapable of determining the correctness of such words as ‘*bhavati*’ and the like.—Again a man, very superior in his knowledge of the Veda, history and such subjects, is unable to visualise such matters as creation, deity, and *apūrva*”.—(3165-3167)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 3164*]:

Hitherto it has been shown that Sense-perception cannot transcend its limitations; it is now going to be shown that in the case of Mental Cognition also, the superiority that is perceptible does not go beyond the range of the subject of repeated experience:—[*see verse 3164 above*]

The same idea is further clarified:—[*see verses 3165-3167 above*]

[*verses 3165-3167*]:

‘*Astronomer*’—one who knows the science of the stars.

‘*Vedetihāsa*, *etc*.’—The compound is to be expounded as meaning—‘one who has the superiority relating to his knowledge of the Veda, etc.’

‘*Apūrva*’—stands for *Dharma and Adharma* (Merit and Demerit).—(3165-3167)
