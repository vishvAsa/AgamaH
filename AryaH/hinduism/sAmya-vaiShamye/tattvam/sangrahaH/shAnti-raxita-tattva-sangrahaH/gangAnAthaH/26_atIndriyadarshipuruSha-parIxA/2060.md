> The doctrine of ‘no-soul’ has been clearly taught by him for the benefit of his disciples—the doctrine which is the unique gateway to the highest good, and the fright of all upholders of wrong doctrines.—(3322)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 3147, that—“If things not mentioned in one’s own books were held to be known to him, then, by merely composing one’s own poems, poets would be omniscient”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3322 above*]

‘*Unique*’.—because not understood by other philosophers; all these being enmeshed in the false doctrines of the Soul. All these qualifications apply to the ‘*doctrine of No-soul*’.

‘*Gateway to the Highest Good*’;—it is so called because it is the means of entering *Nirvāṇa*; it is *Nirvāṇa* that is meant by the term ‘*śiva*’, ‘Highest Good’.

‘*Kudṛṣṭīnām*’—Those upholding wrong doctrines, regarding the Soul and other things.—The Path taught by Buddha is the ‘fright’—inspires fear in those childish people who have their faith fixed in false doctrines.—This has been thus declared—‘The childish man is always beset with such fears as—*I am not*, *I may cease to exist*, *naught is mine, nothing shall be mine*; the wise one is without fear

What is meant by this is that men who are obsessed with false doctrines cannot even speak of the True Doctrine, how can they understand it?—(3322)
