> Or, there may be no such assertion (regarding the existence of the omniscient person); nor may such assertion be reliable; even so, you have come to the certainty that “the omniscient person is not apprehended by any man”; and such certainty could be possible only if the souls of all men were known to you; and if all these were known to you, then you yourself would be omniscient,—as has been pointed out above.—(3287-3288)



## Kamalaśīla

So far it has been explained that the absence of one’s own apprehension of the Omniscient Person cannot serve as a proof of His non-existence;—because, without a qualification, it is inconclusive, and with a qualification, it has no substratum;—now the Author proceeds to explain that the *absence of the apprehension of all men* also cannot serve as proof of the non-existence of the Omniscient Person; because such non-apprehension by all men cannot be proven:—[*see verses 3287-3288 above*]

‘*Assertion*’—i.e. the one declaring the existence of the Omniscient Person.

‘*Asya*’—reliability of the said assertion.

‘*If the Souls of all men were known*’—i.e. if you knew the nature of all men.

It might be said—“We do have the knowledge of the nature of all men”.—The answer to this is—‘*If all these were*, *etc. etc*.’—i.e. if the souls of all men were known to you.—(3287-3288)
