> The consciousness of the mystic is free from conceptual content and is not erroneous; and if it apprehended the said universal, it would be something beset with conceptual content and error.—(3636)



## Kamalaśīla

The Mystic Consciousness has been held to be *valid Perception*, because it is free from Conceptual Content and is not erroneous. If however, it envisaged the Universal as described above, then it would apprehend an illusory thing and thus become beset with *Conceptual Content*; and as apprehending the *unreal* thing in the shape of the Universal as assumed by other people, it would become beset with *Error* also.

Or both being taken as referring to both, there are two objectionable features.—(3636)
