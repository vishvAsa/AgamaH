## Kamalaśīla

Further, there may be repudiation of it either as being the source of suffering or as something else; even so there could he no cessation of the *I-notion* whose sole root lies in the notion of the ‘Soul’.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3495 above*]

‘*I am not*’—This idea that ‘I am not’ cannot be right;—‘*if the I really exists*’,—i.e. if the Soul exists.

Hence that your ‘knower of Truth’ attains *Nirvāṇa* cannot be true; because Liberation has been held to follow from the cessation of the ‘I-notion’, and so long as the ‘Soul’ is there as the object of that notion, there can be no cessation of the ‘I-notion’; how then could there be Liberation?—(3495)
