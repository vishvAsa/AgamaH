> It has been proved by us that any eternal beings, being devoid of all capacity, must be formless. Hence it follows that the ‘three-eyed deity’ and other such beings, who are held by others to be omniscient, do not exist at all.—(3554)



## Kamalaśīla

The other party holds *Śaṅkara* and others to be Eternal Beings;—and it has been proved by us that eternal entities cannot have any capacity at all; as any effective action on their part,—either successively or simultaneously—would be incompatible;—‘being devoid of all capacity’ again is what characterises *non-existence*; hence it follows that *Śiva* and other eternal beings posited by the other party are *non-existent*. Thus it is that it is known that they are ‘like sky-flowers’,

‘*Tryambaka*’, ‘Three-Eyed Deity’, is *Śaṅkara*, *Śiva*.—(3554)
