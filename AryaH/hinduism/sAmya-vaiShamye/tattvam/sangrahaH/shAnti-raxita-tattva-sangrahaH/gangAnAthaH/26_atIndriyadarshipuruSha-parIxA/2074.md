> The jewel-like word of Buddha, whose appearance is conducive to the destruction of the entire mass of the darkness of wrong notions, is never got at by men beset with sins. That is why wise men declared Buddha alone to be omniscient,—cognisant of all such things as primordial matter and spirits; he has been called the ‘great physician—thus there is the definitely certain cognition that Buddha is omniscient, not Kapila. Though this cognition has been clearly spoken of, it has not been understood by dull-witted men.—(3345-3347)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* point out the similarity of the Lord’s Word to jewels:—[*see verses 3345-3347 above*]

‘*Wrong ideas*’ are the ‘darkness’; conducive to the destruction of that is the appearance of the Lord’s Word.

‘*By men beset with sins*’—i.e. by men who have no piety.

‘*Spoken of*’—as brought about by the Inferential Indicative in the shape of the True Word.—(3345-3347)
