> How too do you ascertain, independently, the said ‘mortality’? Certainly not on the basis of the ‘scripture’ of other people; as what that scripture says has just been pointed out.—Nor do we postulate our ‘omniscient persons’ as rivals to the ‘omniscient persons’ postulated by others; who could ever conceive of any rivalry between real entities and ‘sky-flowers’?—(3552-3553)



## Kamalaśīla

If you hold to the ‘mortality’ independently, then your Reason is doubtful—hence—Inadmissible’, In fact, you have no proof in support of the idea of the Blessed Lord being *mortal*,—by virtue of which the said mortality could be regarded as independently ascertained. Hence the ‘mortality’ has to be asserted by you on the basis of the scripture of the other party; and what the scripture of the other party has to say on the point has just been shown.—Thus the ‘mortality’ of the Blessed Lords remains ‘unproven’,—(3552-3553)

*Question*:—“How is it known that these other Omniscient Persons are like *sky-flowers*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3554 next*]
