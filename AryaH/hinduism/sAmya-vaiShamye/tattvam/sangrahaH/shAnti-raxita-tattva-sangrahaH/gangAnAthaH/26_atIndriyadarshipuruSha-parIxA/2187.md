> Those great teachers ox the other hand who were quite sure of the reasonableness of their own teachings and who were confident also of their own powers to expound those teachings,—having shaken off all fear, and bringing about the lowering of the arrogance of the maddened elephants in the shape of the false philosophers—always roar like lions, as follows.—(3586-3587)

> Those who are Brāhmaṇas in reality, by reason of having removed all their sins, and who have practised the teaching of ‘no-soul’,—are all within the purview of the great sage himself; it is for this reason that it has been declared that ‘herein is the śramaṇa’ who has been described under four classes; and the teachings of others are entirely devoid of the śramaṇa-brāhmaṇas.—(3589-3590)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verses 3586-3587*]:

The ‘false Philosophers’ are likened to the ‘maddened elephants’; and the Roaring has the capacity to bring about the lowering of the arrogance of these elephants.

‘*Thus*’—i.e. as described below.—(3586-3587)

*Question*:—“What is that lion-like roar?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3588 above*]

[*verse 3588*]:

Further, even the Blessed Lords have imparted their teachings to *real Brāhmaṇas*;—this was not done by *Manu* and others.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 3589-3590 above*]

[*verses 3589-3590*]:

The connotation of the term. ‘*Brāhrmṇa*’ is ‘one who has removed all sins’; and such *Brāhmaṇas* are possible only under the teaching of the Great Sage, where they are taught the practice of ‘Soul-less-ness’, this is not possible under any other teachings, as these latter do not provide any means for the destroying of sins.—It is for this reason that the Blessed Lord has declared that ‘It is here that there is *Śramaṇa*’,—the *Brāhmaṇa*—and the teachings of others are devoid of real *Brāhmaṇas* in the shape of *Śramaṇas*.—Of these *Śramaṇas*, there are four classes—‘*Srotāpanna*’ (joined the stream) and the rest; and Brāhmaṇas also, with the same characteristics, are of the same four kinds.—(3589-3590)
