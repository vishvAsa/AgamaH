## Kamalaśīla

It might be that there are some people who have come to the conclusion in their own systems that so many are *all* the things that exist, and have postulated them to be as such;—e.g. the *Bauddhas* have postulated the ‘Five Thought-phases’;—the *Vaiśeṣikas* have postulated the ‘Six Categories’;—the *Naiyāyikas* have postulated the ‘Sixteen Categories’,—‘Means of Cognition’, ‘Objects of Cognition’ and so forth;—the *Sāṃkhyas* have postulated the twenty-five Principles—‘Primordial Matter’, the ‘Great Principle’ and so forth.—And one who knows these is held to be ‘all-knowing’.—In this way, it leads to absurdities; such as people who read the works written by these people also become ‘all-knowing’.—(3134)
