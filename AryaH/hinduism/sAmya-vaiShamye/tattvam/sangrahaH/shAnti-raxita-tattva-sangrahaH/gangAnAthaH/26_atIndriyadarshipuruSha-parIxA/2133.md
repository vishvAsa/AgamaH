> In this way, the Vedic sentences, being dependent upon other things, cannot be reliable.—As regards the expounders, as they do not themselves perceive dharma, these also can never be reliable. Of such expounders, even though beginninglessness may be postulated, it would be in a position that is not reliable; and hence it would not be different in character from the beginninglessness of the unbelievers and others. Thus there being no difference discernible, all this comes to be on the same footing; so that neither reliability nor unreliability would be beginningless.—(3482-3484)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Can never be reliable*’—That is Reliability can never be theirs.

When, in this way, the Vedic Sentences themselves, being dependent upon other things, cannot be reliable,—their Expounders would be like a group of blind people, having no knowledge of *dharma*; and as such these also would be unreliable.

Thus what has been asserted by the other party, to the effect, that—“Reliability (Validity) and Unreliability (Invalidity) would thus be beginningless”,—cannot be right.—This is what is pointed out by the words—‘*Na māmtvāpramāṇatve*, *etc. etc*.’—Only if the reliability of the Expounders and the Veda had been established, could the said Reliability be beginningless; as a matter of fact, however, that itself has not been established; hence it is not right to assert that both these are *beginningless*.—(3482-3484)
