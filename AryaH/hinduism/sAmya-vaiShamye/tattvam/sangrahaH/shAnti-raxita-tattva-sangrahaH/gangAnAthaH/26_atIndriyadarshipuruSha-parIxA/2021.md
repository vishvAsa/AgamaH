## Kamalaśīla

It might be said that “He would impart the teaching on waking from Meditation”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 3240 above*]

As a matter of fact, Speaking can never proceed without some Cognition; hence when He would teach *Dharma*, He could do so only when His mind would, be in the *conceptual state*; and in this state there is no difference between the child and the wise man; so that He would be *not—omniscient*, and His assertion would not be the assertion of the Omniscient Person.—(3240)
