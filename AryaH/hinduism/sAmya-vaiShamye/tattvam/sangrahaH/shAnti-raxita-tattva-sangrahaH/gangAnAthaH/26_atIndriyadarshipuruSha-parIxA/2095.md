> It is found that on account of the capacity to perceive supersensuous things also, the presence of intelligence and other qualities is perceived as arising from the force of their learning, etc. for instance, there is the art of ‘*īkṣaṇika*’ (thought reading?) which, properly practised, brings about, even during the present life, the knowledge of what is passing in another man’s mind: and (with its help) people come to know and describe things past, present and future, that have not been either inferred or heard of during the present life. Similarly, people are distinctly and truly found to be possessed of the capacities of curious incantations, nāgas, demons and spirits of all kinds.—all this may not be seen, and yet there is no proof for denying it. Hence it cannot be said that he does not exist,—(3397-3401)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the other party, in *Text* 3160, that—“Those persons who have been found to be superior to others are so only on account of intelligence, memory and strength, which vary slightly with varying persons,—and not on account of the capacity to perceive supersensuous things”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[see verses 3397-3401]

The assertion made in 3160 to the effect that—“it is not on account of the capacity to perceive supersensuous things that some people are found to be superior to others”,—is not true. Because through such arts as that of Telepathy, witches and others are found to be able to read the thoughts of others, and also to have the knowledge of past, present and future things.

The term ‘*ādi*’ ‘others’, is meant to include the *Gāndhāri* and others.

People have also been found to have the knowledge of supersensuous things through the obsession of various elemental, planets, etc.;—all which cannot be denied.

Granting that there is no supernormal vision anywhere,—even so, the mere fact that the Omniscient Person is not seen cannot prove His non-existence. Hence it cannot be true that He—the knower of super-sensuous things—does not exist.—(3397-3401)
