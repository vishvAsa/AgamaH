## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3625*]:

Says the Opponent—“If then, there is nothing incompatible in contraries figuring in the same cognition, then it should be possible for *Pleasure and Pain*, or *Love and Hate*, to figure in the same cognition”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3625 above*]

‘*Should be understood*’;—That Pleasure and Pain are not cognised at one and the same time is due to the fact that they do not appear at one and the same time, on account of the causes of both not being present,—not on account of any *incompatibility*.—This is what should be understood to be the case.—What is meant is that the cause of the non-cognition of both lies in the absence of their causes, not in their mutual incompatibility.—(3625) In the case of those things also where the Incompatibility is real,—and not merely conceptual, as in the case of Pure and Impure,—there is figuring in the same cognition.—

This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 3626 above*]

[*verse 3626*]:

The construction is—‘*incompatible*, *on account of the differences of place, origin*, *etc*.’—‘*Difference of place*’ consists in both not occupying the same point in space;—‘*difference of origin or nature*’—‘nature’ in the shape of the *Blue*, etc. and ‘origin’ in the shape of the *blue components*.—(3626)
