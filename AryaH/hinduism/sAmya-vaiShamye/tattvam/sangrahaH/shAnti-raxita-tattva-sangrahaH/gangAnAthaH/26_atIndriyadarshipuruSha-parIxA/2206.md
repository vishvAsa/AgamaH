> Because it has been already explained that the universal which consists of the conceptual content and is incapable of being spoken of, and is in the form of permanent contiguity,—is formless (featureless).—(3637)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been shown that the Cognition in question, as apprehending an unreal and purely fanciful thing, becomes beset with Conceptual Content and Error. It is next shown in another way, that it becomes beset with Error for the following reason also:—[*see verse 3637 above*]

It has just been said that the Universal, which is incapable of being spoken of’—that is, the Universal which cannot be spoken of as either ‘this’ or ‘not-this’,—forms the very essence of *Conceptual Content*;—‘*because*"—inasmuch as—this has been already explained under the section on ‘*Apoha*’,—‘*therefore the said Consciousness becomes beset with Conceptual Content*—such is the connection with what has gone before (in the preceding *text*).

The reason for this is as follows;—As the Universal is of the nature of Conceptual Content, the Mystic Consciousness that envisaged it would also be of the nature of Conceptual Content; because it is apprehended as of that nature. As regards the Conceptual Content, wherever it appears, it presents as *good* and *desirable*, what is *not-good* and *not-desirable*; hence it is always *wrong*; hence the said Apprehension becomes beset with *Error*.

As regards the *Universal* postulated by other people, in the form *perpetual contiguity*,—that also has been shown, under the chapter on ‘the Universal’, as being entirely feature-less, characterless. So that if the Apprehension envisages this Universal it becomes all the more clearly ‘beset with Conceptual Content and Error’.—(3637)
