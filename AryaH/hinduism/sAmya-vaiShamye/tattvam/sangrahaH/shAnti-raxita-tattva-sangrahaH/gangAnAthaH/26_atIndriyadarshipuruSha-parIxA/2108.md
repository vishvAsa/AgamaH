## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3432*]:

The following *Text* proceeds to show that the Author’s Reason is not falsified by the case of the ‘Heating of Water’; because of the qualifying phrase ‘having a lasting substratum’ (in *Text* 3421):—[*see verse 3432 above*]

*Question*:—“How is it known that Wisdom and other qualities have a *lasting substratum*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3433 above*]

[*verse 3433*]:

‘*This*’—i.e. The Chain of Consciousness.

‘*Function through, etc. etc*.’—i.e. from functioning through its connection with its receptacle, in the shape of the *Bodhisattva*; because what is meant is a particular ‘Receptacle’.

What is meant is as follows:—It has been proved that there is another ‘Region’ (Plane);—the *Bodhisattvas* are persons thoroughly imbued with great Mercy, and they live for the sole purpose of saving all beings from the meshes of Birth and Rebirth; the ‘Chain of Consciousness’, therefore, that subsists in them is all the more ‘lasting’. That ‘Chain of Consciousness’, on the other hand, which subsists in the Disciples is not so ‘lasting’; because these latter enter into *Nirvāṇa* sooner, and hence their Mercy is not so intense; which fact leads them to make no effort to continue to live on (for the benefit of living Beings).—(3433)
