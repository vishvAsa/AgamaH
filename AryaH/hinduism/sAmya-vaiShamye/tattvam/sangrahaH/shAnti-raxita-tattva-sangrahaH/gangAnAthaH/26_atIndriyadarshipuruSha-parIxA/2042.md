> By the exclusion of that one person alone, what connection could there be (of this with the non-existence of the omniscient person)? One’s own illness does not cease merely because other people do not know of it.—(3292)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“What are meant by the term ‘all’ are only men with limited vision, not the Omniscient Person; hence there can be no suspicion regarding His existence”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3292 above*]

If what is meant by the exclusion of the Omniscient Person is that the Reason for the non-existence of the Omniscient Person consists in the fact of his not being apprehended by other people who have limited vision,—then this Reason is Inconclusive; because, like your own ‘Non-apprehension’, the said Non-apprehension by other men of limited vision would have no ‘connection’,—in the shape of invariable concomitance—with ‘the nonexistence of the Omniscient Person’.

The second sentence—‘*One’s own illness*, *etc. etc*.’—is meant to support the said *absence of connection*.—(3292)
