> Or, it may be that the statement made by ṛtuparṇa was with reference to common dull-witted persons like himself, whose minds have not been purified.—In support of the possibility of there being an omniscient person, we have already stated the proof in detail;—arguments to the contrary brought forward by other parties have also been refuted.—In fact, even if the proof in support of his existence had not been put forward, the mere annulment of the arguments to the contrary would have established the probability of his existence. Because where nothing against a certain idea is perceived, nor anything in support of it,—there arises a doubt regarding it; which indicates its probability. In fact, it is only when this probability is there, that there can be such an assertion to the contrary (made by the mīmāṃsaka) as that—“it is by means of the Veda alone that dharma can be known”.—(3468-3472)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3467*]:

As regards *Ṛtuparṇa’s* assertion, quoted under *Texts* 3172-3173—to the effect that—“All men do not know all things, etc. etc.”,—that also is a mere assertion made without reasons.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3467 above*]

Or, it may be that the statement made by *Ṛtuparṇa* is in regard to men like ourselves; in that case, there being no incompatibility between this view and our doctrine of the Omniscient Person,—it has no bearing on the present discussion.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verses 3468-3472 above*]

[*verses 3468-3472*]:

‘*Svasamān*’—People like—similar to—himself.—(3468-3472)
