> Why should words issuing from the walls not be accepted as taught by a reliable person,—when they are prompted by his over-lordship?—(3611)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued, under *Text* 3244, that—“Teachings issuing from walls could not be accepted as taught by a Reliable Person”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3611* *above*]

If the teachings had not been prompted by the over-lordship of the Omniscient Person, then they might not be accepted as those of a Reliable Person. When, however, it has been admitted that they do proceed under His supervision, then why should not they be regarded as taught by Him?—(3611)
