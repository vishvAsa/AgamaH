> “In the case of a thing that has been apprehended at some time or the other, it is possible that there may be doubt; as for instance, in the case of the post, which partakes of the nature of both factors (of the doubt); because the post and the man have both been seen somewhere, therefore it is possible that there should be doubt as to its being this or that. The omniscient person, however, has never been thus perceived.”—(3297-3298)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Texts*, the other Party shows that in the case of the hot Iron-ball, the root of the Doubt lies in Apprehension, while in the case of the Omniscient Person, there is no Apprehension at all,—hence there can be no reason for any doubt; and thus the Reason put forward by the Buddhist is Inconclusive:—[*see verses 3297-3298 above*]

When a certain thing has been seen somewhere previously,—in regard to that alone, there may be doubtr—e.g. in regard to the. Post,—and not in regard to anything else; because it is the Post which partakes of the nature of both (Man and Post).—If it were not so, then Doubts may arise in regard to even those things that have never been seen; so that the condition necessary for all Doubt—viz, the partaking of the nature of both factors,—would not be present.—Thus it is only right that there should be doubt in regard to the existence of Fire in the Iron-ball;—not so in regard to the Omniscient Person; as such a person has never been perceived.—(3297-3298)

The Author’s answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verse 3299 next*]
