## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3310*]:

Thus then, there being no proof against the existence of the Omniscient Person,—and clear proof of His existence going to be set forth later on,—the definite denial that you make of the Omniscient Person, whose recognition is certain, can be due only to delusion.

This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3310 above*]

The following might be urged—“We deny the Omniscient Person because we think that there is no proof in support of the existence of such a Person; and we do not deny Him through delusion”.

[*verse 3311*]:

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3311 above*]

What is said here is on granting the position of the Opponent for the sake of argument; in reality, there is definite proof in support, as is going to be shown later on.

‘*This certainty*’—i.e. the certainty of the *Mīmāṃsakas* that “the Omniscient Person does not exist”.—(3311)
