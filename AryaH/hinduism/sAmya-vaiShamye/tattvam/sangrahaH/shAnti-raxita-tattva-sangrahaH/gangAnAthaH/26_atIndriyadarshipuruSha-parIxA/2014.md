> “If the teaching of Buddha had been based upon the Veda, it would have been imparted to only such persons as were Vedic scholars,—just like the teachings of Manu and others, as a matter of fact, however, Buddha’s teachings are found to have been imparted to ignorant persons and Śūdras; hence it must be defective and illusory, like the making of counterfeit coins.”—(3226-3227)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*;—How is it known that the teaching of *Buddha* does not proceed on the basis of the Veda?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3226-3227 above*]

If Buddha’s teachings regarding *Dharma* had been based upon the Veda, then, He would have imparted them,—like *Manu* and other teachers—to learned *Brāhmaṇas*; as a matter of fact, however they were imparted—not to *Brāhmaṇas*, but to the ignorant *Śūdras*; hence we conclude that the teaching must be ‘*illusory*’—false, just like the making of counterfeit coins.—(3226-3227)
