> It is because ho word of tāyin are found to provide knowledge of things mentioned in the Veda, that he is ‘omniscient it is quite possible too that he had knowledge of all false philosophical doctrines also; as he does make the declaration that what is asserted in the Veda regarding the soul and other things is wrong.—(3320-3321)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 3146, that—“The words of Buddha and others are not found to provide any knowledge of what is contained in the Vedas, etc.;—how then can such persons be regarded as omniscient, without reason?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3320-3321 above*]

A man becomes ‘omniscient’ by knowing everything exactly as it exists, in its true or other forms; and things that are spoken of in the Veda do not exist exactly as described there; as they are found to be annulled by proofs. How then could man be a ‘knower of truth’ by expounding things exactly as they are taught in the Veda?—It cannot be asserted that the *Buddha* did not know these things at all—not even as *false*; because they were actually known to Him as such. For instance, it has been pointed out by Him that Animal-sacrifice and other evil paths of action lead to damnation; He says—‘There is no such thing as the *Soul*, all those things that are there are the effects of causes’; where He has declared that the Soul and other things are *non-existent*. Thus it is not true that the Blessed Lord had no knowledge of the things taught in the Veda.—(3320-3321)
