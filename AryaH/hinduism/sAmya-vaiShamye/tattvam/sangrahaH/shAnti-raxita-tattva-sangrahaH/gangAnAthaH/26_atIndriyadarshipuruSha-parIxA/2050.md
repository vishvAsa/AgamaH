> Thus, then, there is nothing that can set aside the existence of the omniscient person; the proof in support of his existence is going to be adduced later on.—(3307)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus shown in detail that there is no possibility of any proof in support of the non-existence of the Omniscient Person,—the author sums up his view;—[*see verse 3307 above*]

It might be argued that—“as there is no proof for setting aside the Person, so you have none in support of His existence”.

The answer to this is that—‘*The proof in support*, *etc. etc*.’—(3307)
