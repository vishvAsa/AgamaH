> If that is so, then, the principle accepted by all relationalists is that a reductio ad absurdum (in this case) can be urged only on the basis of a character that is accepted on mere faith; if it were based upon well-known reasons, there would be independent (direct) arguments in support. As a matter of fact, the scripture that is postulated by the other party (the Buddhist) as composed by the omniscient person, is as thus described—‘without any appurtenances, the teachings of that person proceed freely even from the walls,—as if they were coming out of the cintāmaṇi gem’.—Thus then it is purely through supervision that he is regarded as the ‘composer’ of the teachings; hence his speakership need not be associated with any conceptual content.—Thus then, when you assert that—“we are wanting in that faith and hence ask for reasons”—you do so without knowing what is meant by reductio ad absurdum.—(3606-3610)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus supported the idea of the *Reductio ad Absurdum*, the Author now proceeds to show how the putting forward of this *Reductio ad Absurdum* is not pertinent to the subject under consideration;—[*see verses 3606-3610 above*]

That character which the other party admits on the basis of the Scripture alone,—that alone should be urged in the *Reductio ad Absurdum*;—such is the well-recognised principle. Now, if the other party (Buddhist) had held the fact of the Scripture being composed by the Person on the ground of His *speakership*,—then there could be some point in urging that—“if He is not the *speaker*, then the Scripture could not have been composed by Him”. As a matter of fact, however, when *Buddha* is regarded as the composer (Author) of the Scripture, it is only as a *Supervisor*, an over-lord,—not as the actual *speaker*.—Consequently, the argument that you have urged in the form of the *Reductio ad Absurdum*,—that “if He is the *composer* of the Scripture, He must be the *speaker*”,—is one that has been urged by you without knowing what is meant by ‘*Reductio ad Absurdum*’.—(3606-3610)
