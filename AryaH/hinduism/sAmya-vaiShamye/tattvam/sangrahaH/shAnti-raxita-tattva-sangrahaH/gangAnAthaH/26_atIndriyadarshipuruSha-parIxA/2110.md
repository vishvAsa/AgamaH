> If consciousness were restricted to the cognition of something apart from itself, then, as it itself would not be cognised, there could be no cognition of things. Consequently consciousness has to be regarded as essentially ‘self-cognised’, specially because it is illuminative. Hence this consciousness remains as something free from all imposition.—(3436-3437)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“How is it known that the second qualification, ‘which is of the same essence as the Perception of Truth’, belongs to Consciousness?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3436-3437 above*]

Primarily, the most important form of Consciousness consists in *self-cognition*;—this has to be admitted by all parties. Otherwise, if Consciousness were cognised by another cognition, then, as its own apprehension would be impossible, there could be no cognition of things. Consequently ‘self-illumination’ is the most important character of Consciousness. This‘self’ of the Consciousness is something entirely ephemeral; hence, by implication, it follows that Consciousness is of the nature of the ‘Perception of Truth’.—(3436-3437)
