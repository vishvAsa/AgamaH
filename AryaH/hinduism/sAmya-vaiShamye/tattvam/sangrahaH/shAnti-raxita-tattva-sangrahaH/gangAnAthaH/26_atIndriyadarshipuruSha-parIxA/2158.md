> As regards the words of the Veda, as they are self-sufficient, their meaning could not be ascertained from the Veda itself;—nor from the learner by himself,—or from some other person,—who might be under the influence of delusion and other disabilities. Under the circumstances, how could there be any certainty regarding the assertion that—‘what is meant by the Vedic words—agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmaḥ—is not that Jina is omniscient?—(3526-3527)



## Kamalaśīla

Then again, if you do not accept the Rescensional text called ‘*Nimitta*’ as *Veda*,—yet, even so, your assertion, that “the Omniscient Person is not mentioned in the Veda”, becomes doubtful at any rate.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3526-3527 above*]

The words of the Veda, on account of their *eternality*, must be self-sufficient, independent; hence what these words mean cannot be ascertained from the Veda itself; because the Veda nowhere says ‘My meaning is *this*—not *that*’;—nor could it be ascertained from the *learner* by himself;—or from some other person, in the shape of an expounder; because all these men, according to you, might be under the influence of Delusion and other disabilities.—Under the circumstances, it is quite possible to take the words relating to the *Agnihotra* as meaning that ‘the Blessed Lord is omniscient’,

‘*Any certainty*, *etc. etc*.’—i.e. no certainty at all.—(3526-3527)
