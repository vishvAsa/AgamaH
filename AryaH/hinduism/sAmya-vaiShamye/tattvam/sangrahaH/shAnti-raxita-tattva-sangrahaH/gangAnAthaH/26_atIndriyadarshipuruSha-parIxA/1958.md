> “If the thing related to the context is some such thing as oil, water or clarified butter,—and if a person knowing all about such a thing is called ‘all-knowing’,—then he may be so; we do not deny that.”—(3131)



## Kamalaśīla

“If what is meant by the term ‘all’ are things other than *Dharma and Adharma*,—such as Oil, Water, Clarified Butter, etc.—and the Person is regarded as ‘all-knowing’ on account of his knowledge of these things,——then your argument is superfluous”.—(3131)
