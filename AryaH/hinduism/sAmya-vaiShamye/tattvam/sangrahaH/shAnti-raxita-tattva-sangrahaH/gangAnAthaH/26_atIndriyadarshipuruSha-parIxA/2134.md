Then again, when we asserted that the Vedas and their expounders stand on the same footing as Buddha and His Teachings,—it was merely as a counterblast; as a matter of fact, there can be no equality between the Blessed Lord and His Teachings on the one hand and the Vedas and their expounders on the other; there is really a great difference between them.—This is what is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 3485 next*]

It has been already proved that the Blessed Lord had the direct perception of *Dharma* and taught it. Hence what the opponent has asserted (under *Text* 3179) regarding the unreliability of one who has never himself perceived *Dharma*, is ‘inadmissible’.—(3485)
