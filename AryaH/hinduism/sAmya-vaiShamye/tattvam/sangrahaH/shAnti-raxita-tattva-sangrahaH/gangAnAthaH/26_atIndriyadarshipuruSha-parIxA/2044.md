> Even if there be no inference, that alone cannot bring, about certainty regarding non-existence (of the omniscient person); as in the case of the existence of the fire which has not yet begun to emit its effect in the shape of smoke.—(3296)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been explained before that Proof (Means of Cognition) cannot be the *cause* of things; nor can it be their *Pervader*; how then can the absence of Proof mean the absence of the Thing? For instance, in the case of the *Fire* in the heated Iron-ball,—while its effect in the shape of *Smoke* has not begun to appear, and it is still hidden inside a hut,—there is no Inference of it, because the Inferential Indicative (in the shape of *Smoke*) is not there; and yet its *existence* does not cease (on that account),—and there can be no certainty regarding its *non-existence*; in the same manner, in the proving of the Existence of the Omniscient Person, if there is no Inference, that makes the matter only doubtful.

‘*That alone*’—that is, mere *absence of Inference*.

‘*Asamārabdha*, *etc. etc*.’—That Fire which has not begun to bring about its effect in the shape of smoke; in regard to the existence of this fire, there can be no certainty.—(3296)
