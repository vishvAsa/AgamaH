> If it is said that—“the non-existence of the marriage is not cognised, because other people know of it then (the answer is) how do you know that other people know of it?—(3284)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Anyopālambha*’—The knowledge that other people have.

‘*Tasya*’—of the mother’s marriage.

‘*Non-existence*’—i.e. what is cognised is not *non-existence*, but *existence*.

The answer to this is that it cannot be known what the knowledge of other people is.—(3284)

The Opponent having been asked—‘How do you know?’—supplies the answer,—which is then refuted:—[*see verses 3285-3286 next*]
