> As a matter of fact, he does not recognise the conceptual content as beneficial (useful); he knows it to be baseless; he is like the magic-performer. The magic-performer knows that the idea that he has produced envisaging the real horse is really without an objective basis; and hence he himself does not become mistaken or misled by it.—(3599-3600)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“As a matter of fact, all Conceptual Content, by its nature, appears in the form of the conception of a thing as *beneficial*, when it is *not beneficial*,—and hence it is wrong, mistaken; consequently any appearance of it would be incompatible with the character of the man who has got rid of his obscurations”.

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verses 3599-3600 above*]

If He had apprehended the Conceptual Content, which is devoid of objective basis, as having an objective basis, then alone He would be regarded as *mistaken*. As a matter of fact, however, He is like the magic-performer, and regards the Conceptual Content only in the form of the conception itself; how then can He be regarded as ‘mistaken’?—(3599-3600)
