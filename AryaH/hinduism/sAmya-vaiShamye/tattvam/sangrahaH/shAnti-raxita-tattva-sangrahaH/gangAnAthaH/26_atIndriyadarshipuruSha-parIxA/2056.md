## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3315*]:

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 3142, that—“Perception and the other Means of Cognition regarding the Omniscient Person having been discarded, it would follow that Morality and Immorality are cognisable through the reliable Word only”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3315 above*]

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 3143, that—“this alone being sufficient to establish the doctrine of the *Mīmāṃsaka*, if an attempt is made to refute the existence of the Omniscient Person, it is like an attempt to kill what is already dead”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3316 above*]

[*verse 3316*]:

‘*Demolished*’—By the existence of the Omniscient Person being established.

‘*Other party*’—the *Mīmāṃsakas*.—(3316)
