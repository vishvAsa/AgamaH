> That person who has propounded this teaching—which is pure and wherein the dharma of ‘no-soul’ has been reiterated,—and which has been supported by the whole of this work and not traversed by any form or means of valid cognition,—which is not known to worldly men,—which is beyond the ken of Keśava and others,—which is highly borne on the head by all wise men,—which destroys the entire host of enemies in the shape of evils,—and is the cause of various kinds op prosperity as also of the attainment of *nirvāṇa*,—such a person acquired special powers not common among men, which distinguishes him from all other men, and he alone is omniscient;—this is entirely vouched for by means and forms of right cognition.—(3641-3644)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 3260, that—“The idea that there is one Person who has acquired special powers not common among men and He knows all things,—is entirely baseless”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3641-3644 above*]

‘*Samaśāstreṇa*’—by the whole of this work, the *Tattvasaṅgraha*.

‘*Which is not known to worldly men*’—i.e., the Teaching which envisages knowledge that is not easily attained by worldly men.

‘*Beyond the ken of Keśava*, *etc. etc*.’—Though this word is in the Masculine Gender, yet it qualifies the word ‘*Deśana*’ (Feminine).

‘*Which destroys*, *etc. etc*.’—The evils themselves are the *enemies*;—and their hosts are destroyed by it.

‘*Is the cause of various kinds*, *etc. etc*.’—the word ‘*Kāraṇa*’ is to be construed with each of the two members of the compound.—(1) It is the cause of the various kinds of Prosperity, and also (2) it is the cause of the attainment of *Nirvāṇa*.—(3641-3644)
