> In this matter, the ‘speakership’ of the lord being implied by the first word uttered by him, a certain party thinks that there is an incompatibility between such ‘speakership’ and ‘omniscience’, and hence concludes that there can be no ‘omniscience’; because there can be ‘speakership’ only when there is ‘conceptual content’, while one could be ‘omniscient’ only if there were no ‘conceptual content’; as a matter of fact, (he urges) an entity is never apprehended by a cognition associated with verbal expression.—As regards this reasoning also, those who think that the ‘speakership’ of the omniscient person follows from cogitation and thinking, do not admit the omniscient person on the ground of his being a ‘speaker’; nor on the ground of his conceptual knowledge; in case, however, there is no ‘conceptual content’, there can be no ‘speakership’.—(3359-3362)



## Kamalaśīla

This is the view anticipated in *Texts* 3359-3360, and answered in *Texts* 3361-3362, as follows:—[*see verses 3359-3362 above*]

Some people hold that the ‘Speakership’ of the Lord is due to the appearance of the ‘Conceptual Content’; while others are of the opinion that, on account of previous impetus, the Lord proceeds to speak even without any conceptual idea.

Under the former view, if what is meant to be proved is that ‘there can be no Omniscience during the conceptual state’, then the argument is superfluous; because these people themselves admit that in the conceptual state, the Lord is *not* omniscient.—If, on the other hand, what is meant to be proved is the absence of Omniscience in the non-conceptual state, then, the Reason adduced is ‘inadmissible’; because in that state, there is no *speaking* at all; for the simple reason that in that state there is no Conceptual Content that could prompt the *Speaking*.—(3359-3362)
