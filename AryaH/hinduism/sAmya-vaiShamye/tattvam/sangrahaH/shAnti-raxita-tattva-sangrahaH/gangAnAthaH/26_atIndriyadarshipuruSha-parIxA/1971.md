## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If it be said that—*Buddha* is the only one to be accepted as such—then the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3149 above*]

It might be said that both are omniscient;—in view of this, it is added—

‘*If both*, *etc*. etc.’—(3149)
