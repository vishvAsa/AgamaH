> What is primarily and directly understood by us is that there is a person who knows the means of attaining heaven and liberation;—but not this alone; it is also believed that there is a person who also knows all things.—(3309)



## Kamalaśīla

What we are primarily concerned with proving is the fact that the Blessed Lord knows the means of attaining Heaven and Liberation; as for the proving of the fact of His knowing *all* things, without exception, that is done only incidentally; what we mean is that in matters other than Heaven and Liberation also, the knowledge of the Blessed Lord is not hampered by obstacles, and hence knowing *all* things, if He becomes Omniscient, there is nothing to prevent it. Hence it is not right for the wise to deny such omniscience; but for those who seek to be sure of the omniscience, it is only right that they should try to secure that certainty. This is what is meant by us.—(3309)
