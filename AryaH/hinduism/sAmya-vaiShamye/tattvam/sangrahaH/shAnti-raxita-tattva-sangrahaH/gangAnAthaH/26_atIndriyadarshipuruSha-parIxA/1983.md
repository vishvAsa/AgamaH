## Kamalaśīla

Further, if a man is omniscient, he must know the past and future things also; otherwise, if he knew only what came up at the moment, then he would be only a *partial knower*, not *all-knowing* (omniscient); and yet it is not possible for any one to know future things.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3174 above*]

As a matter of fact, Sense-perception is brought about by the capacity of things; and as what is still in the future cannot be an entity, a thing,—Sense-perception cannot apply to it.

Nor can Inference apply to it; because there can be no Inferential Indicative; there can be no Indicative which is known to be concomitant with what is in the future; because what has not yet appeared is non-existent.

‘*Other factors*’ include the Corroborative Instance.

The mention of the *Future* is. only by way of illustration; what has been said should be taken as applicable to the *Past* also; because, the past thing also being a non-entity, there can be no functioning of Sense-perception over it.

Thus the invariable concomitance (Premiss) relating to the Reasons—‘being cognisable’ and the rest (put forward under *Text* 3157)—becomes established; and this implies the establishment of the Invariable Concomitance of the previously-mentioned Reason—‘being envisaged by the only Means of Cognition, *Non-apprehension*’.—(3174)
