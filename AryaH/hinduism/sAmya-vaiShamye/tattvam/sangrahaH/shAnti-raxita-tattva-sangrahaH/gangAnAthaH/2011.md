> “‘(*b*) or, this argument in support of the existence of the omniscient person may be stated in the form of the following inference of the *sāmānyatodṛṣṭa* kind (difference from the universal to the particular):—in every other case teaching is found to be preceded by the knowledge of the thing taught, and wherever there is teaching, it is always preceded by the knowledge of the subject taught; as in the case of the potencies of *harītakī* and such things;—the teaching of *dharma* and a *dharma*, has been given by Buddha;—hence it is inferred that the teaching must have been preceded by a knowledge of those matters.”—(3219-3221)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* show that the argument put forward just now may be regarded as *Inference*; it need not be taken as *Presumption*:—[*see verses 3219-3221 above*]

The special mention of the ‘*Sāmanyatodṛṣṭa*’ Inference (from the Universal Premiss) implies the impossibility of the Particular Premiss; as a matter of fact, it is only when the relation between the particular Probans and the particular Subject has been perceived, that, at a later time, the same Probans is made to yield an Inference that sets aside all doubts on the point; and it is this Inference that is called ‘*Viśeṣatodṛṣṭa*’ (based on a particular Premiss). As a matter of fact, no relationship has been perceived between the Omniscient Person and the Teaching of *Dharma*, etc.; hence this can be an instance of Inference from a Universal Premiss only. For instance, it has been found as a universal truth that in any one ‘chain’, the *Teaching* is always preceded by *knowledge*; hence just as in the case of Devadatta, it having been found that his change of place is preceded by movement, so in the case of the sun, the change of place leads to the inference of its movement;—in the same manner, from the fact that Buddha imparted teachings relating to *Dharma*, it is inferred that He possessed the knowledge of *Dharma*.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—Every Teaching is preceded by the Teacher’s knowledge of what is taught;—e.g. the teachings relating to the potencies of the *Harītakī*;—Buddha’s teaching of *Dharma* is Teaching; hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—(3219-3221)

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verses 3222-3223 next*]
