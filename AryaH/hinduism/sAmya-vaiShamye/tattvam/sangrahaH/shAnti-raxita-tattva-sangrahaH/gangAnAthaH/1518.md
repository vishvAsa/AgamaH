> Thus, inasmuch as the causes of truthfulness and falsity,—in the share (*a*) of wisdom and mercy and (*b*) of absence of mercy, etc.,—are not there, the said two qualities cannot belong to the Veda.—(2355)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Summing up the argument, the Author proceeds to show that when we do not find the causes (of truthfulness and falsity), there cannot be any possibility of the Veda being either *true* or *false*:—[*see verse 2355 above*]

Wisdom, etc. are the causes of *truthfulness*, while the absence of mercy, etc. are the causes of *falsity*,—respectively,

‘*The two*’—i.e. Truthfulness and Falsity.—(2355)
