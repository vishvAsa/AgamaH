> How is it that, entirely from dispositions,—such diverse illusions come about as those that devotees have in regard to god and other beings as being the cause of things and so forth?



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued that “Disposition cannot be the cause of Illusion”; this reason is ‘Inconclusive’;—this is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 282 above*]

If Disposition were not the cause of Illusion, then how could such Illusions appear, purely out of Dispositions, as ‘God is the cause of all products, omniscient, the receptacle of eternal cognition’ and so forth? In fact, *Kumārila* himself has denied a creator of the world, like God and other Beings.

In the phrase ‘*proceeding entirely from Disposition*’, the term ‘entirely’ is for the purpose of excluding a *real* background.—(282)
