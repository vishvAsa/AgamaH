> The ‘*pudgala*’ cannot be spoken of as ‘different’ from the thought-phases,—as in that case this doctrine would be the same as those of the ‘tairthika philosophers’;—nor can it be spoken of as the ‘same’ (non-different); as, in that case, it would have to be regarded as ‘more than one’ (many) and so forth;—hence it is best to regard it as ‘incapable of being spoken of’ (as either the one or the other).—(337)

*Question*:—What is the reason for regarding the *Pudgala* as ‘incapable of being spoken of’ (either as the same as, or as different from, the *Thought-phases*)?

The answer is given in the following:—[*see verse 337 above*]

If the *Pudgala* were held to be different from the *Thought-phases*,—then it would come to be the view of the ‘Soul’ propounded by the *Tairthika Philosophers*,—which would mean the acceptance of the doctrine of the *Eternal* ‘Soul and it is not possible (as shown above) for the Eternal Soul to be the *doer* and the *enjoyer*, because it is always undifferentiated, like *Ākāśa*; and the Blessed Lord also has denied the *Eternal* Soul; whose words—‘all entities are devoid of the Soul’—would thus become contradicted.

“In that case, the *Pudgala* may be regarded as *non-different* from the Thought-phases

*Nor* *can it be spoken of as* ‘*non-different*’ *from the Thought-phases*.—If the *Thought-phases*, Colour and the rest, were the *Pudgala*, then, as it would be non-different from many *Thought-phases*, the *Pudgala* itself would have to be regarded as *many*,—like the various forms of the *Thought-phases*; and the *Pudgala* is held to be *one*; as has been asserted in the sentence—‘The *Pudgala* is one, and is born in the world as one; and so also the *Tgthāgata*’.—The phrase ‘*and so forth*’ is meant to include ‘non-enternality’ and such other characters.—Under the circumstances, the *Pudgala* would be something liable to destruction, like the *Thought-phases*; which would mean that there is ‘destruction of what has been done’ [i.e. there would be no accruing of the fruit of one’s deeds to the man, who would be disappearing every moment]; and the Blessed Lord has rejected the doctrine of the absolute destruction of things.—From all this it follows that the *Pudgala* is ‘incapable of being spoken of’ (either as the same as, or as different from, the Thought-phases).—(337)
