> The ‘recalling’ of such notions as ‘by me (seen, heard)’, etc. must be due to perturbations of ignorance; as such notions of the one-ness of the agent (perceiver) are found to appear also in connection with all momentary things. from this false assumption, it cannot be right to deduce any conclusion regarding the true state of things; specially as even things that are diverse by reason of the diversity of their powers become the basis of an effect conceived of as one.—(195-196)



## Kamalaśīla

As against the argument put forward by the Opponent under Text 180 above, to the effect that ‘the cognitions of Colour, etc. have one and several causes, etc. etc.’,—the Author urges as follows:—[*see verses 195-196 above*]

‘*Seen by me and heard by me, etc. etc*.’,—the ‘recalling’, in the ‘associating’ of several such cognitions, has been put forward as the reason for their having a single Cause (in the shape of the ‘Soul’).—But this reason is ‘inconclusive’;—as even in regard to momentary things, such ‘recalling’ is possible through the false assumption of their being due to a single Cogniser. Hence it cannot be right to deduce any conclusion regarding the true nature of things from the fact of such ‘recalling’,

*Question*—“In what way do your *Moments* (Momentary entities) come to be the cause of the said *Recalling* (of Cognitions)?”

*Answer*—*By reason of the diversity of their powers, etc*.;—i.e. by reason of the peculiarity of its powers,—the thing which is *many* (diverse) becomes the ‘*basis*’—cause—of such *single* effects being *recalled* in one form; as is found in the case of such medicines of fever as *Guḍūci* and the rest; all which is going to be explained in detail later on.—(195-196)
