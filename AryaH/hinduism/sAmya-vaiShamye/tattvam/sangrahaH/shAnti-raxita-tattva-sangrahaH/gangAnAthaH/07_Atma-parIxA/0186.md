> “The soul’s characters of ‘doer’ and ‘experiencer’ are not dependent upon the state; hence, as it is the soul itself that remains the same through the various states, it is the doer of the act that always obtains (experiences) the fruit of that act.”—(227)



## Kamalaśīla

*Objection*—If the Spirit (Soul) is of the nature of both states, the state that *does* the act would not be the same that experiences its effects; so that this doctrine also would involve the anomaly of the ‘destruction of what is done and the befalling of what is not done’,

The answer to this is as follows—[*see verse 227 above*]

The character of being the *Doer*—and that of being the *Experiencer*—are not dependent upon the state of the Soul; they are dependent upon the Soul itself; as it is the Soul itself,—not its condition or state—which *does* the Act and *experiences* its effects. Hence, for this reason, inasmuch as the Soul to whom the states belong remains the same and does not abandon its previous form, it is the *Doer* himself who secures the fruit of that Act.—So that this doctrine is not open to the said objection.—(227)
