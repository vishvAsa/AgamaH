> Persons standing on the two sides of it perceive only the purely white rock-crystal; hence it follows that this also does not become transformed into the reflection.—(260)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Rock-crystal also does not become transformed into the reflected image of the object placed by it; this is what is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 260 above*]

For instance, the man standing in front of the Rock-crystal placed in contact with the Hibiscus Flower, perceives it as *red*; while persons who may he standing on two sides of it would perceive it as *purely white*,—not even as partly red and partly white.—Now if the Rock-crystal had become transformed into the reflection (of the Flower), then, just like the man standing in front, the persons standing on the two sides of it also would perceive it as *red*.

This objection is applicable under both views—of things being *momentary* and *not-momentary*.—(260)
