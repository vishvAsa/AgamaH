> “The permanent soul having been absolutely established as devoid of diversity due to the diversity of states,—what people assume to be the states of happiness and unhappiness and the rest,—even when undergoing all these states, my person (soul) does not renounce his character of being sentient, being a substance, being an entity and so forth.” [Ślokavārtika, page 695]—(265)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Undergoing*’—passing through;—‘*Person*’—Soul. The term ‘*and so forth*’ includes such generic characters as *being knowable*, *being rightly cognisable*, *being the active agent*, and the like.—(265)
