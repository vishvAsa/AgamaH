> The opponent’s theory would also entail the incongruity of the rock-crystal becoming different with each object placed before it,—if there were a real transformation of it into the reflection.—(261)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Text*, the Author proceeds to point out the objection that would be applicable only under the view that things are *not-momentary*:—[*see verse 261 above*]

If the Rock-crystal and such things were really transformed into the reflection of the object placed before them, then,—just as the reflections of the various things placed before the reflector appearing one after the other, are different in character, and hence there is no identity among them,—in the same manner, in the *Soul*, and in the Rock-crystal and such things also, there would be differences due to the character of each thing presented to it (and reflected therein).—If the perception of the Reflection, however, be admitted to be an illusion, then there can be no objection to it,—this is what is meant by the epithet ‘*real*—(261)
