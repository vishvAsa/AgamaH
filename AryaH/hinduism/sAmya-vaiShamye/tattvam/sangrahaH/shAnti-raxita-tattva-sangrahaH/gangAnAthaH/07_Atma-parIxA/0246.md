> There is no harm done to us by the mere application of the term ‘spirit’ to sentience; what we assert is that its eternality is difficult to prove; because the eye and other things serve a fruitful purpose. if sentience were everlasting, then all such things as the eye and the rest would be useless; e.g. there would be no use for the fuel if fire were everlasting.—(305-306)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—“There may be non-difference between *Cosmic Intellect* and *Sentience*; even so the fact of its being Spirit remains undenied”—The answer to this is given in the following:—[*see verses 305-306 above*]

What we deny is not merely the applying of the same ‘Spirit’ to *Sentience*; what we do deny is the property of ‘eternality’ that is imposed upon it.—‘Why?’—Because such things as the Eye, the Light, the Mind and the like serve a fruitful purpose. Otherwise, if *Sentience* were everlasting—eternal—then the Eye and the rest would be entirely useless; as the only purpose served by these is the bringing about of *Sentience* (Cognition); and there can be no bringing about of what is eternal.—An example is cited.—*There would be etc*.;—i.e. if fire were everlasting, then people would not fetch fuel for the lighting of fire.

From all this it follows that *Sentience* cannot be Eternal. (305-306)
