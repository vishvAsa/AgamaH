> But as a matter of fact, the cognitions in question have no such connection with that particular place; why then should they appear in that form at that place?—(251)



## Kamalaśīla

When at a certain place, a number of individual objects actually appear as ‘imposed’ upon Cognitions in a certain order of sequence,—there is no connection between the Cognition and those individual objects existing at other times and places,—in the same order of sequence. Under the circumstances, how is. it that they appear in the form that is imposed upon them arbitrarily? Certainly it cannot be right for one thing to appear in the form of another thing; if it were, then this would lead to incongruities; and in this way all Cognitions would come to have all things for their objects; and there would be an end to all ordered usage regarding things.—(251)
