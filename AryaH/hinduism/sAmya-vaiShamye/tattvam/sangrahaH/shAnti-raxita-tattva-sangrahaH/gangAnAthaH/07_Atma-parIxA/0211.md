## Kamalaśīla

It is not right that there should be Illusion in the case of Cognition. What is implied by the term ‘*even*’ is that it is not only ‘transformation into Reflection’ that is not right;—why?—*as there is absence of difference*; i.e. because there is no difference. In the case of the Rock-Crystal and otherngs, it is right that there should be Illusion, as it is possible for the illusory cognition to he different from those things; in the case of Cognition, however, there cannot be another Cognition in the form of an Illusion; as all Cognition is held (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*) to be *one*. Nor can it be said that the Cognition itself appears in the form of an Illusion; as Cognition has been held to be eternal (which Illusion can never be).—(262b)
