> What could the mystic set aside or accomplish by the practice of yoga? What too is there that could be rejected? As wrong cognition also is of the nature of the same (eternal cognition).—The knowledge of truth also cannot be something to be brought about; as, being of the nature of cognition, it is always there.—So that the entire practice of yoga also is entirely fruitless.—(334-335)



## Kamalaśīla

If it be held that ‘Bondage and Liberation are only *assumed*, *not real*’;—then it becomes necessary to explain the basis of this *assumption*. What this basis is under the doctrine of ‘Cognitions being non-eternal’ has been shown above. Thus the Effort—in the form of the contemplation of Truth,—that you put forth for the attaining of the ‘Ultimate Aim’ and for passing beyond the cycle of Birth and Death, can only lead to futile fatigue.—This is shown in the following—[*see verses 334-335 above*]

If, by the contemplation of Truth, the Mystic could set aside, or bring about, anything, then his Effort would be fruitful. As it is however, he can never set aside Wrong Cognition, because *it is of the nature of* *the* *same*,—i.e. of the nature of *Eternal Cognition*.—*For the same reason it cannot be rejected*; because what is eternal cannot be destructible and hence its rejection is impossible.—How can the *Yogin* accomplish—bring about—the *Knowledge of Truth*? Being of the nature of *Eternal Cognition*, the *Knowledge of Truth* would be always there.—Thus the doctrine in question cannot be right.—(334-335)
