> The ‘one-ness’ thus between ‘substance’ and the ‘successive factors’ being not-figurative (i.e. real), the ‘substance’ also should be distributive (exclusive), like the forms of the ‘successive factors’; or those ‘successive factors’ themselves should be comprehensive in their character, like the ‘substance because the one-ness of these with ‘substance’ is duly established.—(317-318)



## Kamalaśīla

When a thing is *non-different* from another thing which is ‘exclusive’ in its nature, the former also must be *exclusive*; as for example, the forms of the Successive Factors themselves;—and Substance is non-different from the Successive Factors, which are *exclusive*; so that there is a natural reason (for the Substance also being *exclusive*).—Or (the argument may be stated in another form)—When a thing is non-different from another which is *inclusive* in character, the former also must be *inclusive*; e.g. the form of the ‘Substance and the ‘Successive Factors’ in the form of Pleasure, etc. are non-different from the ‘Substance’ which is *inclusive*; hence this is a natural reason (for regarding these as *inclusive*). If this were not so, then as the fate befalling them would be different, the two would have to be regarded as *different*.

There is also an argument which annuls the contrary of the conclusion, in the form that—“if things possessed of contradictory properties would be regarded as one, there would be an end to all business.”—(317-318)
