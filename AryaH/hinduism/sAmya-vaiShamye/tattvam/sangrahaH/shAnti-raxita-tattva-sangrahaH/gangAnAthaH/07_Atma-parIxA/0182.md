> Thus the ‘soul’ being something ‘not-proyed’, the entire fabric (of conceptions) that has been adopted in regard to it, becomes baseless like ‘the son of the barren woman’.—(221)



## Kamalaśīla

Thus, any such thing as the ‘Soul’ being found to be precluded by all means of Right Cognition, and hence ‘not proved’, ‘not admissible’—the ‘*entire* fabric (of Conceptions)’,—such as its being the *doer*, the *experiencer* and the like,—that has been set up by you, turns out to be like ‘the Son of the Barren Woman’,—entirely baseless. Hence no criticism is made of all this fabric; as it becomes demolished by the demolition of its very basis (in the shape of the *Soul*).—In what manner our view is not open to the criticism that it involves ‘the destruction of what has been done and the appearance of what has not been done’ [i.e. the contingency of the Person not experiencing the effects of his own deeds, *Karma*, and experiencing those of the deeds not done by him]—is going to be explained under the Chapter dealing with the ‘connection between Action and its Effects’ (i.e. Chapter 9).

*End of the Examination of the ‘Nyāya’ Doctrine of the ‘Self’.*
