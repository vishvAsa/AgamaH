> That cognition on which sound has been imposed must be the same that apprehends taste, colour and other things. if this is not admitted by you, then you have, by your own words, admitted that there is difference among cognitions.—(254)



## Kamalaśīla

*That Cognition on which Sound has been imposed*,—i.e. the Cognition of Sound,—is the same that apprehends Taste, Colour and other things,—and it cannot be different; so that at the time of the apprehension of one thing, there should be apprehension of all things,—as the Cognition apprehending all these would be there always. This has been thus declared:—‘Many things being apprehended by a single Cognition, all these would be apprehended once for alb without any distinction; nor could it appear in any order of sequence, as no distinction is possible’.

*If this is not admitted*; if you do not admit that the Cognition of Sound is the same that apprehends Taste and other things, then you would be admitting that there is diversity among Cognitions.—(254)
