> This Jainas, like the Mīmāṃsakas, assert that the person (soul) is characterised by ‘sentience’; that, in the form of ‘substance’, it is inclusive, and in the form of ‘successive factors’, it is exclusive.—(311)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author now proceeds to refute the ‘soul’ postulated by the *Digambara* (Jaina):—[*see verse 311 above*]

‘*Jainas*’, i.e., the *Digambaras*.—They assert as follows The Soul is characterised by *Sentience* only; and in the form of *Substance*, it remains the same under all states, and as such is ‘inclusive’ (comprehensive) in its nature; while in the form of *successive* factors, being distinct with each state, it is ‘exclusive’ in its nature. This two-fold character of the Soul is cognised by direct Perception, and hence does not stand in need of being proved by other proofs. Thus that ‘Sentience’ which is found to continue to exist through all the states, even though these states are diverse, in the forms of Pleasure and the rest,—is ‘substance’; while the ‘successive factors’ consist of the diverse states which appear one after the other; and all these are distinctly perceived”.

Such is the view of the other party (the *Digambara Jainas*).—(311)

The refutation of this view proceeds with the following—[*see verse 312 next*]
