> “What the disposition can do is to bring about the recognition of the cogniser; it cannot bring about the cognition of a thing as what it is not; because it cannot be the cause of illusion (wrong cognition).—Thus the ‘I-notion’ cannot be regarded as an illusion; as there is nothing to annul it (and hence prove it to be wrong)”;—[Ślokavārtika, page 720]—if this is urged [then the answer is as given in the following text].—(280-281a)

## Kamalaśīla

What the Disposition can do is to bring about the Recognition of the Cogniser, and not the Cognition of a thing—*Cogniser*—as what it is not,—i.e. as *not-Cogniser*; the construction is that Disposition cannot bring about this latter Cognition.—“why?”—*because it cannot be the cause of Illusion*; in fact it always brings about the Cognition of a thing exactly as it had been cognised on the previous occasion, and not a wrong Cognition.—Thus then, because this I-notion is produced from Dispositions, and because there is no valid reason for annulling it, it cannot be regarded as an Illusion.

The term ‘*chet*’, ‘if this be urged should be construed away from its place,—after the end of the sentence.—(280-281)

The following Text answers this argument:—[*see verse 281b above*]

‘*Adduced above*’—under *Text* 278.—(281b)
