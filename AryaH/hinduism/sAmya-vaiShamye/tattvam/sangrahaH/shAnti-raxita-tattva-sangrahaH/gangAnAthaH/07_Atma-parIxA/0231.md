> As regards this doctrine, if ‘sentience’ is held to be one only, then how is it that, in the cognitions of colour, sound and other objects, what is clearly perceived is a form beset with diversity?—(287).



## Kamalaśīla

With the following Text proceeds the refutation of the said doctrine (of the *Sāṃkhyas*):—[*see verse 287 above*]

To explain—When the *Sāṃkhya* says that “Sentience is the Soul’s own form”, what becomes postulated is that sentience is eternal and of one form,—inasmuch as it is non-different from the Soul who is eternal and of one form,—This however is contrary to facts of perception; inasmuch as in the Cognitions of Colour, Sound and other things, what is clearly—distinctly—perceived, through their own Cognition itself—is a *form beset with diversity*,—i.e. a diverse character is perceived;—and this could not be possible if *Sentience* were only one.—(287)
