> Others hold *caitanya* ‘sentience’ to be distinct from the form of *buddhi*, intellect (cognition). They postulate ‘sentience’ as the ‘spirit’s’ own form; he only enjoys the fruits presented to him by primordial matter; he is not the ‘doer’; the character of ‘doer’ is held to belong to primordial matter alone.—(285-286)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Others*’—the Sāṃkhyas. They postulate the Spirit’s own form as consisting of *Caitanya*, ‘sentience’,—which is something different from *Buddhi* (of the *Sāṃkhyas*, which is Cosmic Intellect); as their doctrine is that *Buddhi* is of the nature of Primordial Matter, while *Caitanya* is the form of the Spirit alone.—This ‘Spirit’ is the *enjoyer* of the fruit of good and bad deeds, presented by Primordial Matter,—but he is not the *doer* of the deeds; as the character of the *doer* is held to belong to Primordial Matter alone, which contains within itself the evolution of the whole world. In support of this doctrine they adduce the following proof:—Whatever is of the nature of an aggregate is found to be for another’s purpose,—e.g. Beds and such things;—the eye and the rest are of the nature of aggregates; hence this is a reason based on the nature of things;—and this ‘another’ is, by implication, the Spirit (or Soul): This is what the other party means.—(285-286)
