> The pit and other things can be the ‘receptacle’ of the jujube fruit and other things, because they serve to obstruct their movement, or because they bring about specific changes.—(193)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Because they serve to obstruct their movement*’;—this is in accordance with the view that things are *not* momentary;—‘*because they bring about specific changes*’,—this is in accordance with the view that things are momentary; as the ‘changes’ meant here are those that are brought about on the same spot where the constituent cause existed.—Both these kinds of ‘receptacle’ are impossible in the case of Desire and the rest; hence there can be no ‘receptacle’ for these.—(193)
