## Kamalaśīla

With the following Text, the Author proceeds to answer the above arguments of the *Mīmāṃsaka*:—[*see verse 268 above*]

If the States are not held to be entirely different from the Soul, then, on the destruction and origination of the States, there should be destruction and origination of the Soul also. The term ‘entirely’ is meant to show that, if there were even the slightest degree of *non-difference*, the said ‘destraction and origination’ would be irrepressible. The argument is to be formulated as follows --When one thing is noil-different from another, its destruction and origination must follow on the destruction and origination of the latter, just like the specific forms of those same States of Happiness and the rest,—and the Soul has been held to be non-different in nature from the States of Happiness and the rest; hence this is a reason based upon the nature of things.—(268)
