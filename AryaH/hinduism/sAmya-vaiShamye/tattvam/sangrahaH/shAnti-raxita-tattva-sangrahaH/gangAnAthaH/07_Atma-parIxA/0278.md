## Kamalaśīla

Says the *Jaina*:—“If it is so, and if the *Pudgala* dbes not exist at all,—then how is it that the Blessed Lord (*Buddha*) when asked—as to whether the Living Entity is *this* and the Body is *that*,—the *Living Entity* being different from the *Body*,—said ‘this has not been explained’?—Why did he not say straight away that *there is no stick thing* as the *Living Entity* (Soul)?”

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 348 above*]

If there were such an *object* as the ‘*Pudgala*’, then alone could it have deserved an explanation as to whether it is different or non-different (like other things); as a matter of fact, however, the *object* itself has not been proved; how then could its character be explained î An absolute non-entity, as the ‘Hare’s horn’ can have no *sharpness* or other properties, which could be explained. Hence while propounding the notion that the *Pudgala* has only a*n ideal* (imaginary) *existence*, the Blessed Lord said ‘it has not been ex“plained’.

He did not declare straight away that ‘it does not exist’, because the question had not been asked about the nature of the *object* itself [the question having been only about its difference or non-difference from the Body].

Or it may be that, even though the tiring had a merely ‘ideal’ existence, He wished to avoid the extreme view that ‘it does not exist’;—in consideration of the welfare of such disciples as were not yet ñt for receving the extreme Doctrine of the ‘Void’ (Nihilism), He did not say that ‘the *Soul* or *Pudgala* does not exist.’—It has been thus declared:—‘Noting the difference between the *Tusker* and the *Tusk*, and the destruction of Actions, the *Jinas* propound the *Dharma*,—on the analogy of the Tigress’ Cub (?).’—In this way have *Vasubandhu* and other teachers succeeded in disclosing the real import of the teachings in such works as the *Kośaparamārthasaptati* and the rest; hence it should be learnt from those works. In the present context the details are not written down for fear of becoming too prolix.

“If that is so”—says the opponent—“how do you construe the assertion that ‘there is *existence* which proves it’?”

The answer is—‘*For the purpose of rebutting unbelief etc*, *etc*.’—There are divine teachings of the Merciful One which speak of ‘*sattva*’ and ‘*astitva*’ (Existence),—*which are not incompatible* (with the Buddhist doctrine);—this has to be taken as understood. The ‘mental series’ in which the ‘idea of existence’ appears,—it is with reference to the non-cessation (continuity) of *that* series, that the Blessed Lord has said ‘there is existence’, If he had not done so, then there would be an idea that even those ‘Impressions’ do not exist in the cause-effect-chain of whose ‘moments’ there has been no break,—which would mean that things of the ‘other world’ do not exist,—and this would demolish the whole idea of the ‘other world’, and the disciples would become inclined to ‘unbelief’, [The form ‘*Nāstikya*’ here is used in the old sense of the idea that there is no such thing as the ‘Soul’ or the ‘other world.’]—(348)
