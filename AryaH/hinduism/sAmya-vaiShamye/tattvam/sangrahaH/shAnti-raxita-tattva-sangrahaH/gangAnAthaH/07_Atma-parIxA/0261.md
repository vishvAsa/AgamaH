> Narasiṃha also cannot be one and also of ‘dual nature’; as he is perceived as such because he is an aggregate of many atoms.—(327)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As regards *Narasiṃha*, he is one only and is not regarded as of ‘dual form’,—this is pointed out in the following—[*see verse 327 above*]

What is meant by ‘*also*’ is that it is not only the thing under dispute that cannot be ‘of dual form’, ‘*He*’—i.e. *Narasiṃha*—‘*as such*’, through the diverse character of the parts of his body, and also through His occupying larger space; otherwise He would not appear as He does. If even a small part—of the size of the fly’s leg—of His body were concealed, He would be hidden to that extent.

This same argument also sets aside the fact of His being of the Colour of the Emerald.

All this we are going to explain in detail under the chapter on ‘The *Refutation* of the Composite Whole’,

*End of Chapter on the Jaina ‘Doctrine of the Soul’*.
