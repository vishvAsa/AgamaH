## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been explained that it is not right to regard the ‘Soul’ as forming the object of ‘I-consciousness’, because this latter is devoid of the form of the ‘Soul’, The following Text proceeds to show that the same cannot be right also because in that case there would be no dispute (between us and the *Naiyāyika*):—[*see verse 215 above*]

‘*Existence and other things*’—i.e. regarding its *Existence*, *Eternality, Omnipresence* and so forth.—(215)
