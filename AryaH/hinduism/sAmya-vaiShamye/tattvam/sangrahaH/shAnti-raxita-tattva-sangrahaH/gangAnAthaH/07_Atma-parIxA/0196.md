> “Cognition is always recognised as being of the nature of ‘intelligence’; as regards the cognitions of the jar, the elephant and so forth, their diversity is held by people to be due to the diversity among those things.”—(247)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—How do you know that Cognition is eternal?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 247 above*]

The term ‘*tatra*’ is a meaningless term used as introducing the sentence—‘*Being* *of* *the nature* *of* *Intelligence*’;—because it is always recognised as ‘Cognition’, it is eternal, like the Word-Sound.

“If that be so, then how is it that in common parlance, we find such distinction among Cognitions accepted by observers as ‘this is the Cognition of the Jar’, ‘that is the Cognition of the Cloth’ and so forth?”

*Answer—As regards the Cognitions of the Jar, etc. etc*.;—‘*due to the diversity among those things*’,—i.e. the diversity among the Jar, the Elephant and the rest.—(247)

The same idea is further clarified by the following *Text*:—[*see verse 248 next*]
