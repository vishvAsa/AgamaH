## Kamalaśīla

The following Text proceeds to show that there is no disappearance of the specific properties:—[*see verse 266 above*]

‘*Preceding state*’,—of *happiness*.

“If that is so, then why is not *Unhappiness* also not felt during the state of *Happiness*?”

The answer is—*It becomes merged*, *etc. etc*.—While the state of ‘Happiness’ remains in its own form, the other state, of ‘Unhappiness’, does not appear; it remains merged in the *common character*, which permeates through all states,—such as *being sentient*, *being substance* and so on; and thereby renders possible the appearance of the succeeding state of ‘Unhappiness’; it is for this purpose that it becomes merged in the common character.—(266)
