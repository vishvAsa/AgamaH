> “All (I-notions) of yesterday and of to-day must have the same object,—because they are i-notions belonging to the cogniser connected with one and the same ‘chain’,—like any single cognition.”—(240)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*All I motions of yesterday and of to-day*’,—this states the Subject in regard to which the Probandum is to be predicated;—‘*must have the same object*’,—this states the Probandum;—the meaning is that they should have one and the same object.—The Probans is stated thus:—*Being such I-notions as belong to a Cogniser who is connected with one and the same Chain*,—such as that of a single person like *Devadatta*. The mere character of being *I-notion* is present in the *ī-notions* of other persons also; hence if the Probans had been stated in that form, it would be ‘Inconclusive’; hence in order to avoid that contingency, the Probans has been stated as qualified by the qualification of ‘pertaining to a cogniser connected with one and the same *Chain*’. ‘*Like any single Cognition*’,—this is the Corroborative Instance; it means ‘like any single intended Cognition among these same *I-notions*’.—(240)
