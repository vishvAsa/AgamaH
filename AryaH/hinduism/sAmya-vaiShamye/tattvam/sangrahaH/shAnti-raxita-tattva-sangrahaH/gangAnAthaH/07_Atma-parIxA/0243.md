> If it be argued that—“inasmuch as primordial matter is equipped with cosmic intellect, all this cannot be incompatible with its nature”,—then, on the ground of its being equipped with intellect, it would have to be possessed of sentience also,—like the sentience in spirits. because ‘intellect’, ‘volition’, ‘consciousness’, ‘feeling’, ‘knowing’,—all this is expressive of sentience.—(301-302)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*All this*’—i.e. acting in accordance with the Spirit’s ‘desire to see’ and the rest;—‘*its nature*’—its character of Primordial Matter.—What is meant is this—“Even though Primordial Matter is not of the nature of Sentience, yet it is equipped with Cosmic Intellect which is of the nature of ‘determination’,—and thus it can know of the Spirit’s ‘desire to know’ etc., and act accordingly; so that there is no incongruity at all”.

The answer to this is that *on the ground of its being equipped with Intellect*, etc. etc. That is to say, if it is admitted that Primordial Matter is equipped with Intellect, then it should have to be regarded as endowed with *Sentience* also, like the Spirit; as ‘*Buddhi*’ (Intellect) etc. are only so many synonyms of ‘*Sentience*’, For instance, that which is of the nature of *light* and has its form known by itself and shines independently of all else, is ‘Sentience and this character is present in *Buddhi* (Intellect) also; why then should this latter not be the same as *Sentience*? specially as apart from Intellect, we do not perceive any other form of *Sentience*, by virtue of which this distinct nature could be attributed to Spirit.—(301-302)
