> If it be held that—“it is primordial matter that bestows the fruits, in accordance with the desires of the soul; and this relationship between the two stands like that between the lame and the blind persons”,—[then the answer is as given in the following text].—(292)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Though the Soul is not the *doer* of deeds, yet it is Primordial Matter that presents to him things, in accordance with his desires, and then he enjoys these things.—So that there is none of the incongruity that has been urged.

*Question*:—“Primordial Matter being insentient, how can it be the *Doer* of good and bad deeds, by virtue of which it brings about the fruits of deeds for the Soul according to his desires?”

*Answer*:—*This relationship*, *etc*.; just as the Blind man acts towards things, through his connecti on with the man with eyes,—so do the *Cosmic Intellect* and other ‘divergent’ngs perform the functions of ‘determining’ and the rest towards such effects as Merit, etc,, through their contact with the Soul, which is *sentient*.—This has been thus asserted—“The Soul serves the purpose of bringing about *Perception* (of Matter), and Primordial Matter serves to bring about *Liberation* (of the Soul); the connection between these two thus is like that between the Lame and the Blind; and creation (evolution) proceeds from this connection” (*Sāṃkhyakārikā*, 21’,—(292)

The above argument is answered in the following—[*see verse 293 next*]
