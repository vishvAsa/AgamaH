> If the characters of doer and experiencer are not dependent upon the state,—then the said characters cannot belong to the soul,—as they can belong to only one who has that state.—(272)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been asserted (under *Text* 227) that “the Soul’s characters of *Doer* and *Experiencer* are not dependent upon the State.” The answer to this is provided in the following:—[*see verse 272 above*]

If the character of ‘Doer’, etc. rested in the Souls themselves,—then these could never belong to the Soul, which never abandons its previous charactor. This argument may be formulated thus:—One who has not abandoned his previous States of *non-doer* and *non-experiencer* can never *do* or *experience*,—e.g. the *Ākāśa*,—and the Soul never abandons its State of *nondoer* and *non-experiencer*; hence we find (in the assertion concerned) conditions contrary to the more extensive character.—(272)
