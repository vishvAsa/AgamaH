> If ‘sentience’ is of one form and continues to exist for all time, then, how is it possible for the sentient soul to be the enjoyer of things of many kinds?—(288)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text shows that the said doctrine is open to the charge op being contrary to doctrines of the *Sāṃkhya* himself:—[*see verse 288 above*]

The Soul is of one form, and yet the enjoyer of many kinds of things,—this involves self-contradiction; specially as it cannot be distinguished from the state in which one is not the enjoyer.—(288)
