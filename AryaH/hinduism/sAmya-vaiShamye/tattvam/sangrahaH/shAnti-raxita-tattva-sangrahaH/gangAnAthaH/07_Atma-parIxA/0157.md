## Kamalaśīla

The following Text proceeds to answer the above arguments (of the upholders of the Soul):—[*see verse 188 above*]

*The first argument*,—i.e. the one set forth in Text 177—“My cognitions are apprehended by a Cogniser, etc.”.—This is futile; inasmuch as we already admit the fact that your cognitions are apprehended by a Cogniser other than your body, etc.,—in the person of the Omniscient Being, as also by the *Śrāvakas* and *Pratyekabuddhas* and other thought-readers.—(188)
