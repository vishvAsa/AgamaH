> That things appearing consecutively, one after the other, cannot have one and the same cause, has just been pointed out. for this reason, herein the (opponent’s) premiss asserting the invariable concomitance is found to be clearly annulled by inference.—(199)



## Kamalaśīla

If what you seek to prove is the fact of the Cognitions having a single Cause, by the fact of their having for their Cause a Single Eternal and Uniform Entity,—then your premiss is one that is annulled by Inference.—This is what is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 199 above*]

‘*Just been pointed out*,’—in Text 197.

The ‘annulment’ is in the following manner:—Things whose causes—efficient and untrammelled,—are present, must he produced simultaneously;—e.g. Sprouts and such other effects, whose causal paraphernalia is complete, appear at one and the same time;—Devadatta’s cognitions of Colour and such objects have their Causes—efficient and untrammelled,—present; this is a reason based upon the nature of things.—As a matter of fact however they never appear simultaneously; hence the conclusion is wrong.—(199)
