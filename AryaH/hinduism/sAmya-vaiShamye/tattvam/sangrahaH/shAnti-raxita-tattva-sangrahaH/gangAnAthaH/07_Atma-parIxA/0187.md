## Kamalaśīla

*Question*—What is the Proof (Means of Cognition) that establishes the existence of the Soul?

The answer is supplied by the following Text:—[*see verse 228 above*]

*By the presence of Recognition*,—involved in such notions as ‘*I* cognised it’, ‘*I* am cognising it’ and so forth, where there is ‘recognition’ of the same ‘doer’ (cogniser)—is proved—the existence of the Soul.—*By this same*—Recognition—also *is disproved* the doctrine of ‘No Soul’, as propounded by the *Buddhist* and others; as has been thus declared—‘Thus from this fact Recognition which is admitted by all men, follows the refutation of the doctrine of *No-Soul*’—(*Ślokavārtika*, *Ātmavāda*, 136).—(228)
