> Others again postulate the ‘self’ (soul) as the substratum of desire and the rest,—which, by itself, is not of the nature of consciousness, but is eternal and all-pervasive;—it is the doer of good and bad acts and the enjoyer of the fruit of these; it is ‘conscious’, not by itself, but through the presence of consciousness;—the presence of cognition, effort, etc. as also the character of being the ‘doer’ is attributed to it. its being the ‘enjoyer’ (experiencer) consists in the subsistence in it of the feelings of pleasure, pain and the like;—contact with physical body and with special unprecedented cognitions and feelings is called its ‘birth’; and dissociation from these same as taken up before is called its ‘death’; its ‘rebirth’ consists in becoming equipped with a body and mind, under the influence of merit and demerit. it is assumed to be ‘hurt’ by the hurting of its body, eyes and the rest; so that though it is eternal, the said process (of birth and rebirth) has been held to be unobjectionable.—(171-176).



## Kamalaśīla

\(A\) *According to the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika School.*

[*There is a large lacuna here in Śāntarakṣita’s Text tiself; as is clear from the following portions of Kamalaśīla’s Commentary*, *of which latter also, the earlier portions are wanting*.]

The existence of the *Soul* as the cogniser has been asserted in the following words:—“All particular cognitions of such cognisables as Substance, Quality and Action, which are comprised under ‘Being’, etc.,—and also of Generality, Specific Individuality and Inherence, which are not comprised under ‘Being, etc.’—all which cognitions are perceptional or inferential or analogical or verbal or occult (astrological, etc.) or intuitional (e.g. ‘my brother will come to-morrow’) or doubtful or wrong or dreamy or dream-cognition,—are apprehended by a cogniser distinct from my body, etc.,—(*a*) because their origination is dependent upon their own causes,—(*b*) because they are ‘general’ and ‘particular’,—(*c*) because they are of the nature of Consciousness,—(*d*) because they are very quickly destructible,—(*e*) because they leave impressions,—(*f*) because they are cognitions,—just like the cognition of other persons;—the Jar and other things serving as. the Corroborative Instance *per dissimilarity*.”

The import of this comprehensive argument the Author sets forth (from the Nyāya-standpoint) in the following Text:—[*see verse 177 next*]
