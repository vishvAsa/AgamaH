Others, upholding the *Advaita* (Monistic) system of Philosophy, who are followers of the *Upaniṣads*, postulate the ‘Soul’ to be *Eternal*, *One* and of the nature of Consciousness, which appears in the form of the illusory modifications of Earth etc.—This is the view set forth in the following Texts.—[*see verse 328 above*]

*This is what constitutes the Soul*—That is, the Soul is of the nature of one Eternal Consciousness of which Earth etc. are illusory modifications.—‘*Others*’—i.e. the followers of the *Upaniṣads*.—(328)
