## Kamalaśīla

If what is meant is that Primordial Matter brings to the Soul the desired fruit of even such acts as he has not done, then how is it that, at all times, on the desire appearing for anything, the desires of all men do not become fulfilled?

It might be argued that—“It does not become fulfilled because its cause, in the form of Merit, is not present”.

The answer to that is that *Primordial Matter cannot stand in need of anything else*.—Merit is a product of Primordial Matter, and as such non-different from it; consequently it must be always present; and the desired fruit must therefore always appear. For instance, all things (for the *Sāṃkhya*) are included under the two categories of ‘Primordial Matter’ and ‘Soul’, and these are always close to one another; so that the fruit should be always there.

Then again, if it is the desired fruit that Primordial Matter brings to the Soul, why then does it present to him what is undesirable? For certainly no one desires what is undesirable.—(293)
