> The assertion that ‘a certain thing is of dual form’ can be based on the existence of several things,—because the term ‘form’ connotes nature.—(326)



## Kamalaśīla

If theng is ‘impartite’, then, to speak of it as ‘of dual form’ is a contradiction in terms; because such an assertion can be based only upon the existence of several things; because when a thing is spoken of as ‘*dvi-rupa*’, ‘of dual form’, what is meant is that ‘it has two forms—two natures’; and one and the same thing cannot have ‘two natures’; as that would deprive it of its *one-ness*. What you have proved is only that there are two *forms* or *characters*, and not that there is a *single* entity *with two forms*; and that for the simple reason that the characters of *being one* and *being many* are mutually contradictory and preclusive.—(326)
