## Kamalaśīla

With the next *Text*, the Author proceeds with the Answer to the above-stated doctrine of the *Mīmāṃsaka*:—[*see verse 241 above*]

If *Intelligence* is held to be eternal and one, then Cognition also—which has no form other than that of Intelligence,—*should have to be regarded* as eternal and one. This however cannot be desirable for you; as it would be contrary to your doctrine. For instance, the author of your *Bhāṣya* (Śabara) has declared [under *Sūtra* 1.1.5, page 9, line 17, *Bib. Indica* Edition] that ‘Cognition, being momentary, cannot be present at the time of another Cognition’, *Jaimini* also has asserted (under Sū. 1. 1. 5) that ‘Perception is that Cognition of man which is produced on the contact of an existing thing’; and if Cognition were *eternal*, there could be no ‘production’ of it.

It would also involve self-contradiction on the part of *Kumārila* himself: He has declared for instance that—‘It does not remain for a single moment, nor does it even appear in the form of wrong cognition whereby it could operate later on towards the apprehending of its object, like the Sense-organs and the like’—(*Ślokavārtika*, *Pratyakṣa-Sūtra*, 55).

Further, if Cognition were held to be only one, this would be contrary to the doctrine of ‘Six Means and Forms of Cognition’,—It would also be contrary to Perception also; as Cognitions are clearly perceived to be liable to appearance and disappearance in the course of the thinking of things with constant imposition of variations.—(241)
