> As a matter of fact, the ‘notion of I’ comes about without a real basis, through the force of the beginningless seed of the vision of being; and that also only in some places.—(275)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 229) that “The conception of *I* in the notion *I know* apprehends the *Cogniser*”;—the following Text proceeds to show that this is ‘unproven’ (not admitted by all parties):—[*see verse 275 above*]

The said ‘I-notion’ has no real background, by virtue of which the ‘Cogniser’ could form its object.

“If that is so, then what is the cause of its origin?”

The answer is that—*It proceeds from the beginningless*, *etc. etc*. ‘*Vision of Being*’ is the vision of the existing body;—the ‘seed’ of this vision is the Potency of Dispositions; and this ‘seed’ is beginningless;—and it is *through the force* of this that ‘I-consciousness’ is brought about;—*and that also only in some places*,—i.e. only in the internal economy of the Sextuple Body.—(275)
