> “Or, the clean mirror, or the rock-crystal, reflects the image of only what is placed before it in the same manner, souls, though possessed of eternal sentience, apprehend colour and other things only when they are themselves in the body and the things are presented to them by the organs. and it is this sentience that we call ‘intelligence’.”—(244-245)



## Kamalaśīla

The epithet ‘*clean*’ has been added because the dirty mirror is not capable of reflecting images.—‘*Placed before it*’,—carried to it,—*In the same manner*;—this introduces what has to be illustrated. Though, in reality, the Souls are all-pervading, yet, it is only when, under the influence of the Unseen Force (of destiny), they subsist in the Body, that they apprehend things that are presented to them by the Eye and other organs,—not while they are away from the Body.—This eternal Sentience is what we call ‘Buddhi’ (Intelligence), and it is not different from it,—like the ‘Buddhi’ (Cosmic Intellect) of the *Sāṃkhyas*.—(244-245)

*Question*—If that is so, how is it that this Cognition is known as. *evanescent*?

In answer to this, the next Text proceeds to show the reason, already indicated before, why Cognition is regarded as evanescent, and thereby explains that evanescence:—[*see verse 246 next*]
