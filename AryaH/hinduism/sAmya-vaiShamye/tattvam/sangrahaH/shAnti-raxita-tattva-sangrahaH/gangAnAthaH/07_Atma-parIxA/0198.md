> If such is the case, then, on the occasion when there appear. cognitions imposing the concepts of ‘elephant’ and the rest in reference to spots where these animals do not exist,—to what is the diversity in such cognitions due?—(249)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the diversity of the Cognition is due to the diversity in the objects cognised,—then, what is the basis for the diversity that appears in the ease of those Cognitions which successively impose the concepts of the ‘elephant’, ‘horse’ and the rest upon a place where the elephants do not really exist? The meaning is that in such cases there is no basis at all for the notion of such diversity. Because, there is no difference in the Cognitions *per se*; as all Cognition is held to be *one* (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*). Nor can the diversity be due to the multiplicity of the objects imposed; as there is no object that does the *imposing*.—(249)
