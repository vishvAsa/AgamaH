> “The term ‘Ātman’ (soul) must be expressive of something distinct from the aggregate of intellect, sense-organs and the rest,—because it is held to be a single term, while being different from the well-known synonyms of those terms;—whatever is definitely known as fulfilling these conditions is always qualified by the said property; as is found in the case of the term ‘cloth’.”—(182-183)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following is another argument put forward by the same writer (*Uddyotakara*):—[This argument is found set forth, in different words, in the *Nyāyavārtika*, under 3.1.19, page 368, Bib. Ind. Edition; see also page 340]—“The term ‘Soul’ must be expressive of something different from the aggregate of Body, Sense-organs, Mind, Intellect and Feelings,—because it is a single term, while being distinct from the well-known synonyms of these latter,—like such terms as ‘Jar’ and the like.”

This argument is set forth in the following Text:—[*see verses 182-183 above*]

*Being different from the well-known synonyms*;—i.e. such terms as ‘*dhī*’ (which is a synonym of ‘*buddhi*’) and the rest, which are well-known synonyms of the term ‘*Buddhi*’; the term ‘Soul’ is distinct from all these syonyms.—*Whatever is definitely known*, *etc*.—i.e. which is different from well-known synonyms and is yet a single word,—*is always qualified by the said properly*,—i.e. is always characterised by the quality of being expressive of something distinct from Intellect and the rest.—(182-183)

The same writer has also adduced a negative Reasoning in proof of the *Soul*—“This living body is not Soul-less, because if it were so, it would have to be regarded as devoid of the functions of Breathing, etc.,—like the Jar and such things”.
