> ‘One-ness’ (sameness, identity) consists in non-difference of nature were there if this ‘one-ness’ (between two things), then ‘difference’ (between them) world be hard to prove in any way; as in the case of the forms of the successive factors themselves.—(316) commentary.



## Kamalaśīla

Even admitting that there is *non-difference* between the ‘*Substance*’ and the ‘*Successive Factors*’,—such being the case, the ‘non-difference’ should be *absolute*; how then could there be ‘difference’ between them, which is the contradictory of ‘non-difference’? It cannot be right to *affirm* and *deny* a thing,—affirmation and denial being mutually contradictory. For instance, when two things are spoken of as ‘one’, what is meant is that there is ‘nondifference in their nature (character)’,—this ‘non-difference’ being inseparable from ‘negation of difference’; and when there is such ‘non-difference of character'’ (between the ‘substance’ and the ‘successive factors’), how could there be, at the same time, ‘difference’, which is the negation of ‘non-difference’? This argument may be formulated as follows:—In a case where there is *non-difference* between two things, there can be no room for *difference*, which is the contradictory of ‘non-difference’; e.g. as is found in the case of the same ‘successive factors’ and the ‘substance’, in regard to the specific individuality of each, where there is *non-difference of character*; and between ‘substance’ and ‘successive factors’, non-differencel is clearly present (hence there is perception of what is contrary to the Probandum, i.e. difference).—(316)

Thus in reality, there being *non-difference* between ‘Substance’ and the ‘Successive Factors’, there cannot be any difference between them as regards their ‘characteristics’ also; this is what is shown in the following—[*see verses 317-318 next*]
