> As a matter of fact, the mirror-surface can never contain the reflection (of anything),—because it is lasting, because it is indivisible, and because several things with material shape cannot subsist together.—(259)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author now proceeds to refute the possibility of the perception of all Reflections,—under both theories—that things are momentary and that things are not-momentary:—[*see verse 259 above*]

*Because it is lasting*,—i.e. not momentary,—therefore the Mirror-surface cannot contain the reflection.

Even if it is momentary, it cannot contain the reflection *because it is indivisible*; when the reflection is perceived it is perceived as if it were inside the mirror, just as the Water is perceived inside the well; and yet the Mirror-surface has no *parts*—i.e. vacant space;—because its component particles are closely packed. Hence the perception of the Reflection must be an illusion.

Or the term ‘*nīrvibhāgatva*’, ‘indivisibility’, may stand for *absence of difference between the previous and succeeding states*; and the reason for this absence is ‘*because it is lasting*’; so that the meaning comes to be—‘because on account of its lasting character it is devoid of difference between its previous and succeeding states’; that is, *because it has no previous or succeeding states*.

Further, *because several things with material shape cannot subsist together*,—‘the Mirror-surface cannot contain the reflection’,—this has to be construed here. Because what are perceived in the Mirror-surface are only *reflections* occupying the same space; material things with forms can never occupy the same points in space; as if they did, they would become one and the same.

This objection is applicable under both views—of things being momentary or non-momentary.—(259)
