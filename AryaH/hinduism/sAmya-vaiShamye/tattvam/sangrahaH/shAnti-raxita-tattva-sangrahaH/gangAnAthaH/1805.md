> “The sublating cognition is always in the form of the cognition of the thing concerned as different from what is envisaged in the previous cognition; and as in this form, it is not dependent for its validity upon anything else, it sets aside that previous cognition.”—(2866)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—Though the sublating or annulling cognition may not have its validity dependent on something else,—yet it is only when that Cognition is recognised as itself unsublated that it can stamp invalidity upon another Cognition; not otherwise.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2866 above*]

‘*Sets aside*’—discards; i.e. rejects as *invalid*.—(2866)
