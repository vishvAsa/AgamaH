> If the action of going and the rest constituted the very essence of the ‘moving entity’,—then, this latter could not stay immobile for even a single moment; because even when the going, etc. are not there, they should certainly be there,—inasmuch as the object has not renounced its previous form, and is exactly as it was at the time of the appearance of the going, etc.—(699-700)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“Even if the non-momentary object is always the same,—inasmuch as, by its very nature, it has the form of the ‘moving entity’,—it could have Action; hence our Reason is not Inconclusive”.

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verses 699-700 above*]

If such objects as *Devadatta* and the like, which are held to be *non*-*momentary*, were, by their very nature, connected with the Actions of *Going*, *Throwing up* and the rest,—then, they should never stand unmoving; as the *Going nature* would always be there. Hence in the case of these, Devadatta, etc., who are endowed with the action of *Going*,—even when there is no *Going*—i.e. even when they are standing immobile,—the said actions of *Going*, etc. should be there,—just as at the time of the appearance of those acts; because the objects will not have abandoned their previous form or nature.—(699-700)
