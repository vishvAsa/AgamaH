## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* shows that the Reason set forth (by the Buddhist, in the Inference just cited) is not ‘Fallible’ (or Inconclusive):—[*see verse 693 above*]

Some things are admitted to be fleeting in their character;—e.g. the Lamp-flame is admitted to be something which ceases very quickly; and even in these, Action appears only *after* they are born,—i.e. come into existence; and have been held to last only for ‘six moments’, and only to that extent, *not-momentary* (lasting).—(693)

The following *Text* shows how this is so.—[*see verses 694-695 next*]
