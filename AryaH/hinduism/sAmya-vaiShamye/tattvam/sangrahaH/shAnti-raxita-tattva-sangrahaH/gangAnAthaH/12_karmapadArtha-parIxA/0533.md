> If the object were mobile at one time and immobile at another then, inasmuch as two mutually different characters would be there, it would be two different objects.—(703)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be argued that—“it is not of the same form; it is of both forms, *going* (mobile) and *not-going* (immobile); hence the criticism urged is not applicable; and the Reason too is ‘unproven’.”

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 703 above*]

The ‘*ca*’ after ‘*ekadā*’ should be construed after ‘*punaḥ*’,

What is meant is that, in the manner suggested, as the mutually contradictory characters of *mobility* and *immobility* would be imposed upon it, the object would cease to be one.—(703)

The following *Text* shows that for the above reason, it becomes established that the object is *momentary*:—[*see verse 704 next*]
