## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that for the above reason, it becomes established that the object is *momentary*:—[*see verse 704 above*]

‘*The two*’—i.e. things in the *mobile* and *immobile* states.

‘*Like two things, etc*, *etc*.’,—i.e. such things as the Creeper (moving) and the Mountain (not moving).—(704)
