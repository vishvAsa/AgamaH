> Notions of connection with names are produced by endless means, even apart from similarity; as is found in the case of such names as ‘*nampa*’ (king) and the like.—(1581)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“The connection of the Name is nowhere created through similarity; what happens is that when the thing named is perceived, it is pointed out that ‘this is the Cow’, which is the form given to the Convention; nothing like this happens when the thing concerned is not perceived at all”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1581 above*]

‘*Notions, etc. etc*.’—i.e. notions of the relation of Names.

‘*As in the case, etc. etc*.’—i.e. of ‘King’ and such names.—(1581)

An example is cited of the manner in which notions of Names are brought about by endless means:—[*see verse 1581 next*]
