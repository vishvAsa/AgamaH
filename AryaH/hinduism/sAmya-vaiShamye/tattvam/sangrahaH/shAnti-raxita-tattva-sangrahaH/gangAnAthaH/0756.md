> In some cases, the word is applied on the basis of the exclusion of the effect and cause of the thing; as for example, colour is spoken of as ‘inaudible’, or lightning is spoken of as ‘not produced by effort’.—(1042)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Thus it, has been shown that diverse words are applied to the same thing, on the basis of the multiplicity of effects (function) and causes. The following *Text* is going to show that diverse words are applied to the same thing, even without a commonalty, where there is desire to express only the exclusion of its effect and cause:—[*see verse 1042 above*]

The term ‘*Kāryahetu*’ stands for the things of which the previously-mentioned factors are the *Effect and Cause*;—the ‘*Viśleṣa*’ of these is their *exclusion* (denial).

“What are the words like this?”

‘*Inaudible, etc*. *etc*.’;—Colour is spoken of as ‘inaudible’, when what is meant is the exclusion of Sound which is the effect of Auditory Perception;—similarly, for the purpose of excluding things produced by effort, the term ‘not produced by effort’ is applied to Lightning.—(1042)
