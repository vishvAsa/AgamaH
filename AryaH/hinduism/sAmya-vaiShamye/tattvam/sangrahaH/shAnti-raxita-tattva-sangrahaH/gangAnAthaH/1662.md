> Further, as in the case of the word-sound, so in the case of ākāśa also, there can be no ‘manifestation’; such ‘manifestation’ would mean cognition; and this would be everlasting, as its cause would be always there.—Just as, in the case of the word, there can be no manifester,—so it cannot be in the present case also; and in reality, it is an illusion appearing, through extraneous circumstances, in regard to the cognition of the word-sound. Hence the conclusion is that length, shortness and the rest are not properties of the articulation. They could be so only if the articulations were the manifesters of the word-sound; and this idea has been rejected.—(2609-2611)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *texts* point out that—even if *Ākāśa* is a positive entity, there can be no *manifestation* of it—[*see verses 2609-2611 above*]:

‘*They could be so*’—i.e. Length, etc. could be properties of Articulation. ‘*This*’—the idea that the Articulations are manifesters of the Word-Sound.—(2609-2611)
