## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the inner room, the Man apprehends the mere semblance of the thing; later on he apprehends the thing more specifically as ‘blue’ and so forth;—in the same manner in the case in question, having, at first apprehended the thing in its mere outline, one would subsequently come to have the Perception of the thing equipped with the Class-character and other properties. So that there is no incongruity at all.—(1291)

If such be the case,—and all the cognitions that appear after the initial Pre-cognition are valid,—then, in a case where the man has had the precognition of the thing, and then closing his eyes, conceives of the thing as connected with the Class-character and other properties (as the Conceptual Content), then, inasmuch as this latter apprehends things not apprehended before, this also would have to be regarded as *Sense-perception*.
