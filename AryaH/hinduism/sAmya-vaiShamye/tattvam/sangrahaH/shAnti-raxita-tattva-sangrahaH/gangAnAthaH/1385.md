> “Inasmuch as the word, heard but once, envisages several ‘universals’ in an indefinite form, it cannot definitely point to its own specific denotation, as distinguished from the other ‘universals’—(until it has been used several times).—As a matter of fact, the word ‘cow’ would get at the specific denotation of the particular ‘universal’ ‘cow’ only after a long time when it has been heard several times, and has thereby excluded the other universals—‘living beings’, ‘the quality of whiteness’, the action of ‘moving’, the universals ‘dewlap’, ‘tail’, and also the individuals, the ‘cow of variegated colour’, the ‘hornless cow’ and the like,—which are diverse by reason of their individual peculiarities.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words—364-366]—(2136-2138)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

This has been thus explained in the *Bhāṣya* (of *Śabara*, on Sū. 1. I. 19)—“If the word ‘Cow’ is eternal, it is the same word that is uttered many times and has been previously heard also several times, as applied to other individual Cows; and thus by a process of positive and negative concomitance the Word comes to he recognised as denoting the particular *Universal*; for this reason also, the Word must be eternal.”

‘*Individuals which are diverse, etc. etc*.’—i.e. distinguished by their respective peculiarities; their diversity is based upon their being cognised as different from one another. Hence the compound ‘*svasvanibandhanāḥ*’ is to be expounded to mean ‘which have their diversity based upon the cognition of their respective peculiarities’.

‘*Having excluded*’ has to be construed with all these.—(2136-2138)
