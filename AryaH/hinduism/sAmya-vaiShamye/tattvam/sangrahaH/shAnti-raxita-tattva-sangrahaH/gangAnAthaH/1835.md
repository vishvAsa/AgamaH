> “Like valid cognition, invalid cognition also operates upon its object, by itself (independently); but the fact of its being false cannot be apprehended without another means of cognition.”—(2913)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Invalid Cognition also has the semblance of the Valid Cognition, and hence it does apprehend [the ‘*na*’ is wrongly put in] the object, by its mere existence; consequently, ‘*falsity*’—i.e. the fact of its envisaging an unreal thing—cannot be apprehended without another means of Cognition; we are going to show later on that this falsity is *extraneous*.—(2913)
