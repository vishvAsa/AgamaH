> “The said ‘infallibility’ is seen in other cases also: for instance, (1) the blooming of the lily and the rise in the sea have the rise of the moon for their ‘indicative’. (2) From the presence of sun-light, the presence of shade on the other side is inferred.—(3) When the half-burnt wood-piece is seen in the dark from a distance, it brings up the idea of smoke.—(4) From the rise of the *kṛttikā* (asterism) is inferred the proximity of the *rohiṇī* (asterism).”—(1419-1421)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Texts*, the author sets forth certain objections against the ‘infallibility’ put forward as constituting the character of the true Inferential Indicative:—[*see verses 1419-1421 above*]

\(1\) From the Rise of the Moon—follows the inference of the Blooming of the Lily and the Rise in the Sea.

The term ‘*ādi*’ is meant to include such cases as the Blooming of the Lotus inferred from the Rise of the Sun.

\(2\) From the presence of sun-light, there follows the inference of the shadow on the other side.

\(3\) When from a distance one sees in the darkness a half burnt piece of wood, he infers the presence of smoke,

\(4\) From the rise of the asterism *Kṛttikā*, one infers the proximity of the asterism *Rohiṇī*; since it is well known that the asterisms rise in the same order in which they are enumerated in the list beginning with *Aśvinī*.

All these are not included among the three kinds of Probans (mentioned in Texts 1417-1418). Why then should it be asserted that there can be no ‘*Infallibility*’ in any Probans other than those of the said three kinds?—(1419-1421)

The answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verses 1422-1423 next*]
