> “The subsequent cognition of the sun and other things must appertain to the same sun and other things that exist at the time of the cognition that appears in connection with the sun and moon, etc.,—because while it is not a cognition of anything related to the earth and other things, it is spoken of as the cognition of those things (sun, etc,),—just like the previous cognition of the sun at that time.”—(462-463)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“What is that Inference?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 462-463 above*]

“The Cognitions—in dispute—of *the Sun*, *the Moon*, *the Planets*, *the Stars and such objects* must appertain to *the Sun*, *the Moon*, *the Planets*, *the Stars and the rest* as associated with the time at which appeared the cognition of these Sun and the rest in Devadatta and other persons,—because while not apprehended as related to the Earth, they are spoken of by means of the term ‘*the Cognition of the Sun*, *the Moon*, *the Planets*, *the Stars and the rest*’,—like Devadatta’s Cognition of these things on the first occasion.”

‘*Must appertain to, etc*.’—i.e. to luminous substances.

‘*While not apprehended as related to the Earth*’;—this qualification has been added in order to avoid the invalidity that might apply to it on the basis of the Cognition of the Sun, etc. as painted in pictures.

‘*Subsequent*’,—i.e. a Cognition other than Devadatta’s; i.e. appearing at a different time.—(462-463)
