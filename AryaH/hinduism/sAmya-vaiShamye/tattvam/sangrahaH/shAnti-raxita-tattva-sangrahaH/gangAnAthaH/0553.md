## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been already pointed out that the ‘Specific Peculiarity’ of Things which forms the root-cause of the Idea of the ‘Goad’ and such things, is not touched by an ‘imposition’ (or qualification). As regards the ‘Illusory’ form of things, it is a mere product of the art of Imagination; it consists in mere ‘Idea’, and is not an *external* object. People regard it as an ‘*external* thing’, because they are unable to distinguish between what they see and what they imagine, and hence they regard the form cognised as ‘external’; so that the external existence of the Goad and such things cannot be admitted.

‘*Avalambya*’ is to be construed with ‘*aṅkuśādikam*’.
