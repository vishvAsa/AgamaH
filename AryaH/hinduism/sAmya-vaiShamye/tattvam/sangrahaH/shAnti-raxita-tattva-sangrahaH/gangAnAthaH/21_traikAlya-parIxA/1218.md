> If, on the other hand, the ‘activity’ is not different from the entity, then, being inseparable from the entity, it would be there at all times, just like the nature of the entity; and in that case, the division among the states could not be made on the basis of this activity; as there could be no such distinction as that between cessation, and non-attainment, of the said activity.—(1799-1800)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the Activity is held to be non-different from the Entity, then like the nature of things, it would be inseparable from the Entity; the Activity also would be something existing at all times; and in that case there could be no such distinction among states as that—that winch has ceased from activity is ‘Past’, that which is still active is ‘Present’, and that which has not yet attained Activity is ‘Future Because if the Activity were distinguishable into ‘attained’ and ‘not attained’,—then alone could the said distinction be possible; the said distinguishing however is not possible; because there can be no such distinction in the case of what is always present in the same form—(1799-1800)
