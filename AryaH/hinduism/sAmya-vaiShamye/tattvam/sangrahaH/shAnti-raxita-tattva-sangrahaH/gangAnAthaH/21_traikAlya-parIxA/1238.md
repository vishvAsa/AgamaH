> In the case of the cognitions of ‘eternal things’, ‘god’ and so forth,—there is no objective background; as words and names are devoid of the forms of those.—(1848)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*And so forth*’, includes such other assumed things as Primordial Matter, Time, etc.

No such idea should be entertained as that these cognitions have their objective background in the words; this is what is meant by the words—

‘As *Words arid Names*, *etc, etc*.’—What is meant is that the ‘form’ of God-such as Eternality, Being the Cause of all things and so forth,—that is envisaged in the said cognitions,—of that form, the Word or the Name is entirely devoid,—which Word or Name does not undergo any modification.

The term ‘*ādi*’ in ‘*śabdanāmādi*’, is meant to include the contingent cause (of Cognition), postulated by other people, in the shape of the Reflected Image of things.—(1848)

*Question*:—“If then there is Cognition *without object* also, then how is it called ‘Cognition’? Because ‘Cognition’ stands for *that which apprehends things*; and when there is nothing *to be apprehended*, how could the *cognition* be there?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1849 next*]
