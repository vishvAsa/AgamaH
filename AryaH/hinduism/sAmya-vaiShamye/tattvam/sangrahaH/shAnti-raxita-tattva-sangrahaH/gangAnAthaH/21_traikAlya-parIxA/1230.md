## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 1833*]:

If the other alternative is accepted—that the Past and the rest are not momentary—then it goes against your doctrine.—The term ‘*Kṛtānta*’ stands for *Siddhānta*, accepted doctrine.—The doctrine referred to is that ‘all modifications are momentary’,—(1833)

[*verse 1834*]:

Further, the view in question does not go against your own doctrine only, it is opposed to Reason also. For instance, whatever is existent must be momentary,—like the Present thing,—the Past and the Future are existent—hence they must be momentary. Previously—under the treatment of the Momentary Character of things (under Chapter VIII) the Invariable Concomitance of this Probans (*Being existent*, with the Probandum, *Being momentary*) has been established. Hence it cannot be said to be ‘Inconclusive’ (Doubtful). Further, ‘existence’ is characterised by *capacity for effective action*:—what is not*-momentary* is not compatible with effective action, either successive or simultaneous;—and when there is no *effective action*, there must be cessation of *existence* also, which is characterised by *effective action*. Thus *Existence* becomes excluded from where the Probandum (momentariness) is absent.—(1834)
