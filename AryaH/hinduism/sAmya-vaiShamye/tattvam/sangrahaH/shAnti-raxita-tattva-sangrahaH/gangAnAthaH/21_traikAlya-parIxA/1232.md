## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, for the man for whom the Past and Future are actually present,—the fruit of acts also would be there at all times; hence any effort to attain Heaven or Final Beatitude would be futile; as there would be no fruit that could be attained by effort,—what would be the efficiency of the Austerities and Penances that constitute ‘effort’?—It might be said that “they would have the efficiency to produce the desired results”.—That would mean that the said ‘Production’ of Results is something that was not there before and has come about now.—But even so, what is it that would be efficient? And wherein would it be efficient?—“The efficiency would lie in making the results ‘present’”.—What do you mean by ‘making them *present*’?—If it means ‘bringing them to another place’, then the thing becomes eternal, as it would remain for all time.—How too could there be any such ‘bringing’ in the case of Sensations, etc., which are immobile? Even so, this ‘bringing’ would be something that did not exist before, but has now come into existence.

‘*Heaven*’ stands for the place on the summits of mount *Meru*.—‘*Apavarga*’, ‘Final Beatitude’, stands for Deliverance;—the ‘*Saṃsarga*’ of these is their *attainment*.—The ‘*effort*’ for this consists in Observances and Austerities.—(1841)
