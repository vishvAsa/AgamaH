> As a matter of fact, that entity alone is real which is capable of action; hence from that which is not so in the two states,—no effect can proceed.—(1821)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“It is true that the Entity, not being capable of action before it becomes capable of action, and having become capable of action, it ceases to be so; but even so, in these Past and Future states also the Entity is there all the same, though not capable of action; so that our theory is not incompatible with the idea of the Entity being there at all times”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1821 above*]

‘*That alone*’—which is capable of action.

‘*In the two states*’—in the Past and Future states.

‘*That which is not so*’—i.e. not capable of action.—(1821)
