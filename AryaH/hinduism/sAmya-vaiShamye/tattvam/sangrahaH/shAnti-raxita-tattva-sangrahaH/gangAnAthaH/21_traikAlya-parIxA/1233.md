> If, on the other hand, the past and future things are held to be without the capacity for effective action,—then, on that ground alone, they would be non-existent,—like the ‘sky-flower’,—(1842)



## Kamalaśīla

If then the second alternative view (proposed under *Text* 1835) is accepted—that the Past and Future things are devoid of capacity for effective action,—then, in that case, for that very reason,—of being devoid of *capacity* *for* *effective activity*,—they would have to be regarded as ‘non-existent’, like ‘sky-flowers’; as the only characteristic of ‘non-existence’ consists in the *absence* *of* *all capacity*.—(1842)
