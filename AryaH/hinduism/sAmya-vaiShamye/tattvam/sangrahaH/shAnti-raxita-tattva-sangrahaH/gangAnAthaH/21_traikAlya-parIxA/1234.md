> As regards the reasons that have been adduced, they must reside in things; and until these things are established, the reasons cannot be admitted.—Or else, on account of the ‘present’ character being established, the said reasons are ‘contradictory’,—as going against the nature of the subject.—(1843)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus adduced arguments in favour of the view that the ‘Past’ and the ‘Future’ do not exist, the author proceeds to refute the arguments that have been put forward in support of the view that they do exist;—[*see verse 1843 above*]

The ‘Reasons’ meant here are those adduced by the other party, under the *Text* 1790; these are ‘Inadmissible in regard to their substratum’; because the things in which they are said to reside are the Past and Future things, and it has been shown that these do not exist; as has been said—‘if the thing is not there, its property cannot be there’.

Even if the said things existed, as they have been proved to have the ‘Present’ character, the Reasons in question would be proving something contrary to the very nature of the *Subject*; and as such, they would be ‘Contradictory’,—(1843)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then how is it that Buddhist writers have declared the Past and Future Forms, etc. to be included among the ‘states’? The Past and Future character of non-entities like the Hare’s Horns is never tried to be determined”.

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1844-1845 next*]
