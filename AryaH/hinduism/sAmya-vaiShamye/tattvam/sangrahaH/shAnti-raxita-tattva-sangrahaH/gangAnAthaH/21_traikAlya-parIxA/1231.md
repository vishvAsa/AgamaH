> Are these ‘past’ and ‘future’ things capable of effective action? Or not?—If they have that capacity, then they must be regarded as ‘present’, like other ‘present’ things.—If the ‘past’ and the ‘future’ are not regarded as ‘present’, then they must be devoid of all capacities,—just like the ‘sky-lotus’,—the *ākāśa* and other ‘non-produced’ (eternal) things are open to the same objection; hence these cannot serve to make our reason ‘inconclusive’,—in the case of all entities, their restricted capacity for effective action must be due to some cause; if it were without a cause, everything would be used for everything. In fact, the restricted capacity for effective action must be brought about by a cause; and there is no other characteristic feature of the ‘present’ thing. In the case of the ‘past’ and ‘future’ also, the said capacity is there fully complete, according to your view; wherefore then should not the character of the ‘present’ be attributed to them?—(1835-1840)

Further, there are the two alternatives—these Past and Future things are capable of effective action—or not capable.—If they are capable, then, the capacity being there, the things must be regarded as ‘Present’,—like those things whose ‘present’ character is not disputed. The argument may be thus formulated—Things that are capable of effective action must be regarded as Present,—as those things whose ‘present’ character is not disputed,—and the Past and Future things are capable of effective action; hence there is this Reason based upon the nature of things, which provides the *Reductio ad absurdum*.—The Probans cannot be said to be ‘Inconclusive’; because the absence of the ‘Present’ character in the Past and Future things would imply the absence of all capacities,—just as in the ‘sky-lotus’,—The argument may be thus formulated:—Things that are not-‘Present’ are also *not-efficient* for any action,—e.g. the ‘sky-lotus’,—and the Past and Future things are not ‘Present’; hence there is perceived in them the absence of the wider character.

Nor can this argument be said to be ‘Inconclusive’, in view of the three ‘eternal verities’—*Ākāśa*, *Pratisaṅkhyā-nirodha* and *Apratisaṅkhyā*-*nirodha*,—which do not undergo modifications;—because these also are included under the Minor Term (Subject of the Syllogism).

Thus there is no ground for the Reason being regarded as ‘Inconclusive’ (or Doubtful).

Then again, the restricted capacity for effective action that there is in entities, must be admitted to be due to some cause; otherwise, if it were without cause, them there could be nothing to restrict it; and the capacity of things would, in that case, not be restricted (or limited); with the result that each and every thing would be utilised in bringing about each and every effect. Thus it cannot be right to restrict the efficiency of the eternal verities, *Ākāśa* and the rest. Consequently they do not supply the ground for regarding the Reason as ‘Inconclusive’.

Nor can it be urged that the former Reason is one whose presence in the contrary of the Probandum is open to suspicion; because the efficiency that pertains to a particular efficient activity,—the birth of which is due to causal factors,—is what characterises the ‘Present’; and this characteristic of the ‘Present’ is present intact in the Past and Future things also; hence, there being no other basis for this, why should these be not regarded as ‘Present’?—(1835-1840)
