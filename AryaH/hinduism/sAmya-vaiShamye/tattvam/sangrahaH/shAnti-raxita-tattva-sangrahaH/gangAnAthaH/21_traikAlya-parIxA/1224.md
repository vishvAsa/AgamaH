> Firstly, the activity in question consists in ‘the capacity to throw out results’ and is capable of being spoken of; how can it be said to have an imaginary existence, when the capacity op things is an entity?—Secondly, the form that is admitted to be bringing about such effects as burning, cooking and the like,—is this same form held to be in the ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ states?—If it is the same, how can activity, inactivity and cessation of activity belong to the entity that has a single form?—How can these mutually contradictory modes be present in what is only one and undifferentiated?—If it is argued that—“because it abandons one ‘state’ and then takes up another, that entity cannot be undifferentiated, which passes through the states”,—then the question arises—are these ‘states’ different from the entity?—[The other party answers]—“no; as in that case, the entity would not be an active agent. because it is only through the existence of the ‘states’ that the existence of the effects is apprehended.”—(1810-1815)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the other party—“It may be that the Activity has a purely *imaginary* existence; and hence the distinction of the *states* based thereupon may also be only *imaginary*;—what is the harm in that?”—This is the view taken up in the following—[*see verses 1810-1815 above*]

You (Sahantabhadra) have explained that the capacity of entities to throw up their effects is what is meant by ‘Activity’;—now, how can *this capacity to throw up effects* have a merely imaginary existence? That is, it can never be so. Consequently the distinction of the ‘states’ based thereupon should also be accepted as *real*.

Further, the Form of Fire is found to be one that is capable of such efficient actions as those of Burning, Cooking, etc.;—is this the same that continues in the ‘Past’ and other states? Or is it different-? If it remains the same,—then how can such contradictory properties as ‘activity’, ‘inactivity’ and ‘cessation from activity’ belong to the said form winch is one and the same, totally undifferentiated?—And it is only through the presence of these properties that the Entity could have such states as the ‘Future’, ‘Present’ and ‘Past’ respectively. If, even in the presence of contradictory properties, the entity remained the same, then all ideas of Difference would become uprooted, and the entire universe would have to be regarded as *one* only. And such *one-ness* would mean that all things should be produced together at one and the same time.

It might be argued that—“By virtue of the variations undergone in the process of abandoning one state and taking up another,—the Entity in the three states is *not* entirely *undifferentiated*”.

But even so, are these states different or non-different (from the Entity)? This has got to be explained.

Bays the other Party—“They are not different;—i.e. they do not differ from the Entities.—‘Why?’—Because, in that case the Entity could not be an active agent; i.e. it would be inactive; as through positive and negative concomitance, it has been ascertained that efficient activity (causal efficiency) to produce effects belongs to the *states* only. [Hence by being different from the States, the Entity could not be an active agent]”.—(1810-1815)

The objections against this last view [that “the States are *not different* from the Entity”] are pointed out in the following—[*see verses 1816-1820 next*]
