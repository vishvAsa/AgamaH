> “Having admitted the capacity of words to express their meaning, if the opponent proceeds to establish his case, he clearly sets aside the ‘non-eternality’ (of words), by his own accepted doctrine”.—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 315.—(2306)

> “For all parties, the perishability (non-eternality, of words) becomes annulled by ‘scripture’ (verbal authority), through the potencies of words in the bringing about of the cognition of their meanings,—which potencies form the basis of each and every scripture—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 316].—(2307)

> “In the manner shown before, the opponent’s proposition is annulled by common experience also.—There is annulment by inference also, for reasons stated before.—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 317].—Annulment by perception also has been pointed out before—on the ground of the oneness of word-sound being definitely proved by recognition brought about by the auditory organ”.—(2308-2309)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2306*]:

The following *Texts* point out that the Opponent’s assertion implies the rejection of his own accepted doctrine:—[*see verse 2306 above*]

The *Mīmāṃsaka* shows that the Opponent’s Proposition goes against all scriptures—[*see verse 2307 above*]

[*verse 2307*]:

The *Mīmāṃsaka* next points out that the Opponent’s Proposition is annulled by common experience—[*see verses 2308-2309 above*]

[*verses 2308-2309*]:

‘*In the manner shown above*’,—in the preceding text. But it should be read as follows—‘For all parties the perishability of words becomes annulled by the potencies of words to bring about the comprehension of their meanings,—which potencies are definitely recognised by all men—and also by common experience

The words ‘There is annulment by Inference, etc. etc.’ serve to remind the reader of what has been said before regarding the Buddhist’s Proposition being opposed to Inference, etc. The ‘*reasons stated before*’ have been of several kinds—those detailed in the *Texts* 2121 *et seq*.

‘*Has* *been pointed out before*’—under *Text* 2117.—(2308-2309)
