> As a matter of fact, the very existence of the eye,—which is the subject—is still uncertain; and the proving of this (existence) cannot be right,—as it would be open to the defects of ‘inadmissibility’ and the rest.—(1400)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* supplies the answer to the argument stated (by *Pātrasvāmin*, in Text 1374) regarding “the Eyes having the peculiar potency for bringing about the effect in the shape of Col our-perception.”—[*see verse 1340 above*]

There is a stop after ‘*na*’ (in the second line).

‘*Inadmissibility and the* *rest*—The term ‘and the rest’ includes ‘falsity’ and ‘contradiction’.

What is meant is that if *Existence* is to be proved, then the Probans put forward is open to all the three defects of the Probans. For instance, if the character cited as the Probans is something *positive*, then it is ‘inadmissible’;—if it is both (positive and negative), then it is ‘Inconclusive’;—if it is *negative*, then it is ‘contradictory—This has been thus declared—‘The positive property is not admitted; both positive and negative would be Inconclusive; and the negative one would be contradictory; how then can *Existence* be proved?’

If what is sought to be proved is *the potency in the Eye, the Subject*, *to bring about visual perception*,—even so, inasmuch as ‘potency’, ‘existence’, etc. are synonymous, the proving of *Potency* would involve the proving of *Existence*.—On the negative aspect also, inasmuch as the Potency, being beyond the reach of the senses, would not be well-known, the Probans would become fallacious, as having no *well-known* substratum.

Similarly, the Probans, in the form ‘because of the perception of Colour’, would be something not present in the Subject, and hence it should be understood to be *Inadmissible*.—(1400)

*Question*:—“How then can you also prove the existence of the Eyes and the other sense-organs?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1401 next*]
