> “As a matter of fact, in the matter of the auditory perception of sounds, superiority among men is found in the apprehending of distant and subtle sounds,—not in the apprehending of colour and other things. Similarly in the matter of visual perception, what is brought about by the attainment of superiority is the perception of remote and subtle colour,—not the perception of sound and other things.”—(3162-3163)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Granting that all Intelligences become superior by practice and exercise—even so, they become superior without transcending their inherent limitations.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3162-3163 above*]

‘The apprehensions’—Cognitions—‘of distant and subtle sounds’ the Instrumental ending connotes ‘Indication In some places, the reading is ‘*upalabdhitaḥ*’, in the Ablative; connoting ‘reason’; the ‘*tasi*’ at the end coming under the rule ‘*Vidhāyādi*, etc.’

‘*The apprehension of sound*, *etc*.’—is not brought about by the Eyes.—(3162-3163)
