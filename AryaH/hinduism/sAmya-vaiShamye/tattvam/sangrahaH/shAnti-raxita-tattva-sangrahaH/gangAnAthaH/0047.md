> “(B) the material cause of the body and other things is controlled by an intelligent being,—because they are endowed with colour and other qualities,—like the yarn and such things which have been seen to bring about their effects (only when controlled by the intelligent weaver).”—(49)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The second argument propounded (by *Aviddhakarṇa*) is next explained:—[*see verse 49 above*]

*Of the Body and other things,—the material Came*,—in the shape of Atoms and such things—can bring about their effects only when controlled by an Intelligent Cause;—such is the construction of the Text.—The Reason (Probans) stated is ‘*because they are endowed with Colour, etc*.’.—The ‘*Yarn*, etc.’ are cited as the Corroborative Instance. This has been thus declared—‘The material causes of the Body, the World and other things produce their effects only when controlled by an Intelligent Being,—this is what we assert, on the ground that they are endowed with Colour, etc.,—like suchngs as the *yarn* and the like’.—(49)
