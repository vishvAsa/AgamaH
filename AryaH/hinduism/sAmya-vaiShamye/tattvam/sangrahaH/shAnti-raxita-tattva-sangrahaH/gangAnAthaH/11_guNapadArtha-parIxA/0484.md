> By the rejection of ‘substance’, ‘quality ‘action’ and the rest, which are held to be subsistent in substance, all become discarded.—(634)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author now proceeds to discard the categories of ‘Quality’ and the rest:—[*see verse 634 above*]

‘Quality’, ‘Action’, ending with ‘Specific Individuality’, become rejected by the rejection of Substance’; because they subsist in this latter; and when the substratum is not there, the ‘subsistents’, which are dependent upon it, cannot be there.

‘*Held to be, etc*.’—i.e. held to be subsistent, either directly or indirectly, in *Substance*. For instance, *Quality* and *Action* are held to be directly subsistent in *Substance*; as declared in the *Sūtra* (*Vaiśeṣika*)—“*Quality* is subsistent in *Substance*, devoid of qualities, not the cause of Conjunction or Disjunction, independent”;—which is the definition provided of *Quality*; similarly the definition of *Action* provided is—“It subsists in one *Substance*, is devoid of Qualities, the independent cause of Conjunctions and Disjunctions The term ‘*ekadravyam*’ in this last *Sūtra* means ‘subsisting in one Substance —*Qualities*, on the other hand subsist, some of them, in several *Substances*; e.g. Conjunction, Disjunction and the rest. The Genus and the Specific Individuality subsist, some of them, in *Substances* only; e.g. such *genuses*, as ‘Earth’ and the like; while such genuses as ‘Quality’, ‘Action’ and so forth subsist in *Qualities* and *Actions* related to *Substances*.—The *Summum genus*—which is ‘Being’—subsists in the three categories beginning with ‘Substance’ [i.e. in *Substance*, *Quality* and *Action*].

Thus, when *Substance* has been rejected, *Quality* and the rest become rejected without any effort. What is meant by this is that the final upshot of the examination of the other Categories has been achieved under the examination of *Substance* itself.—(634)

*Opponent*:—“If that is so, then the Denial of *Subsistence* should be proceeded with separately.”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 635 next*]
