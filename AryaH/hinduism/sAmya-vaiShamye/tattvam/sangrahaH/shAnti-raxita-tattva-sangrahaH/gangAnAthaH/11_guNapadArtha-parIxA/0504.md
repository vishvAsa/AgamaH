> “Then again, on what basis is the notion of ‘the man with earrings’ produced? It could not proceed from the mere presence of the man and the ear-ring; for in that case, the said notion would be there always.—Further, it is only something that has been perceived to be present in one place that is denied in another place. If conjunction has not been perceived, then how does it come to be denied in such expressions as ‘*caitra* is without ear-rings’? Hence it follows that there is some such real thing in the shape of conjunction, whose affirmation and denial proceed with due distinction.”—(661-663)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“Then again, when there appears the notion that ‘Devadatta is wearing Ear-rings’,—on what basis does it appear? This needs to be explained. The said notion cannot be due to the mere presence of the Man and the Ear-ring; as Devadatta and the Ear-ring being lasting entities, the notion should appear constantly (even when Devadatta would not be wearing the Ear-ring).

“Further, it is only when a certain thing has been perceived to be present in a certain place that the notion of the negation of its presence is found to appear in reference to another place; under the circumstances, if you have never perceived Conjunction to be present, then how could you have the distinct notions of *Caitra* being ‘with Ear-rings’ and ‘without Ear-rings’? What is denied by the expression ‘Caitra is without Earrings’ is not the *Ear-ring*, because it having been assumed to be existent in another place and at another time, it could not be denied entirely. Nor can it be the denial of *Caitra*, the man; as he stands on the same footing as the Ear-ring. Hence what is denied must be Caitra’s *contact* (Conjunction) with the Ear-ring.—Similarly by the affirmative expression ‘Caitra with the Ear-ring’, what is *affirmed* is neither the Ear-ring, nor Caitra,—as both these are well-established entities;—hence, by elimination, all that can be affirmed is the Conjunction between these two, which has not been cognised by any other means.—From all this it follows that, there is such a real thing as Conjunction (and Disjunction), by virtue of which there appear such distinct affirmative and negative notions as ‘*Caitra* with Ear-rings’ and ‘*Caitra* without Ear-rings

“The term ‘*ādi*’ is meant to include the notion of ‘qualification’, as pointed out before.”—(661-663)
