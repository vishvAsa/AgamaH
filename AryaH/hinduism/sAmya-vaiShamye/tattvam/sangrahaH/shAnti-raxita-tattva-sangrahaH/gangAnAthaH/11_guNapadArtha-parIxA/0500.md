> Conjunction and disjunction as restricted to substances have been postulated by others as causes of the notions of ‘being joined’ and the like; these are entirely useless.—(653)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author next proceeds to criticise the qualities of *Conjunction* and *Disjunction*:—[*see verse 653 above*]

The Opponent’s scheme is that—“*Conjunction* and *Disjunction* are the bases, respectively, of the notions of ‘being joined’ and ‘being disjoined’; they consist in the *contact of what has not been in contact*, and *the ceasing of contact of what has been in contact*;—and that they are brought about by the action of either one or of both, as also by Conjunction and Disjunction”.

All this is a mere scheme; and there is no proof for the idea that these are real entities; hence they have been needlessly postulated by the other philosophers.

This argument may be formulated as follows:—That in support of which there is no proof (no means of Cognition) can never be regarded by intelligent persons as ‘existing e.g. ‘the Son of the Barren Woman’ the other party have no proof in support of ‘Conjunction’ and ‘Disjunction’; hence there is non-perception of the wider condition (which makes the less extensive conclusion impossible).—(653)
