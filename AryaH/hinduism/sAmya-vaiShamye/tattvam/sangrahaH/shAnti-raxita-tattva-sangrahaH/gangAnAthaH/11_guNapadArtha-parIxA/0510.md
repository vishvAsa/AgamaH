> The notion of ‘the man with the ear-ring’ arises only with reference to *caitra* (the man) and the ear-ring, in whom a particular condition has come about; and it only appears as if the cognition were of ‘conjunction’ (between the two).—(670) commentary.



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 661, above) that—“The notion of the *man with the Ear-ring*, *etc. etc*.”—This is answered in the following—[*see verse 670 above*]

Just as what is called ‘Conjunction’ comes into existence only when Caitra and the Ear-ring appear in a certain state,—and not always;—in the same manner, the notion also of ‘the man with the Ear-ring’ is due to a particular state of things, and as such, why should it appear always?

The compound ‘*Jātāvasthāviśeṣayoḥ*’ is to be explained as ‘the two, Caitra and the Ear-ring, in whom a particular state has been produced’.—(670)
