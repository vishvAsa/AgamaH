> The number ‘one’ may subsist in the one cognition; but on what basis does the notion of ‘two’ proceed, in reference to cognitions? Or even in regard to the ‘six categories’ and the rest?—The notion too of its ‘subsisting in the same thing’ can only be figurative, and hence fallible,—like the notion of ‘fire’ in regard to the boy.—(642-643)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the notion of ‘one-ness’ is due to subsistence in the same substance,.—then it may be so in regard to *one Cognition*, as also to *Pleasure* and the rest,—in which case the notion of ‘one’ is due to their subsisting in the same substance ‘Soul’ (which is *one*);—but what would the basis of such notions as ‘*two* cognitions’, ‘*three* Cognitions’ and the like? Certainly *duality, etc*, do not subsist in the *Soul* (in which the Cognition subsists).

The assertion too that is made,—such as ‘*Six* Categories’, ‘the *two*, Pleasure and Pain’, ‘the *two*, Desire and Hatred’, ‘*Five* kinds of Action’, ‘*Two* kinds of Genus, the Higher and the Lower’, ‘*One* Being’, ‘One Subsistence’ and so forth,—what would be the basis for such notions *?* In these cases, there is no Number subsisting in the same thing.—So that this assumption also is not comprehensive enough; hence it cannot be right.

Further, ‘Subsistence in the sameng’ and such other basis, are asserted; and yet the notion of such subsistence, even if it appeared, could be only *figurative*,—because there are no other things; and hence the notions would be fallible; just like the notion of ‘Fire’ in regard to the Boy, where there is no real ground for applying the word to him. And, yet the notion is not fallible. So that the objection urged above still remains in force.—(642-643)
