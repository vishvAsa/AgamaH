> It is the one peculiar condition seen in one place which is denied in another place.—as regards the notion ‘*caitra* is without the ear-ring’, it is not conjunction that is denied; for the simple reason that this conjunction has never been seen.—(671)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 662, above) that—“It is only something that has been perceived to be present in one place that is denied in another place, etc. etc.”.—The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 671 above*]

The notion in question has been explained as being based upon a certain state of things; and when this state of things, which should be perceptible, is not perceived under another state ofngs,—then there is its denial (in regard to this latter state of things);—and what is denied is not the Conjunction that is assumed by you. For the simple reason that the ‘Conjunction’ has never appeared in any Cognition, apart from the things to which it is held to belong.

Thus our Reason is not open to the charge of being ‘Unproven’.—(671)’
