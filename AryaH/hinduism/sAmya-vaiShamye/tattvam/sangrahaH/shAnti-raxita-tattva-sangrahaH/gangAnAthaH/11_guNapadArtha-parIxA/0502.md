> “If conjunction and disjunction were not there, then to what would such distinct notions be due as—‘this thing is attached to it’—‘this is detached from it’?”—(658)



## Kamalaśīla

“Further, even when there is no other difference between two things, one is said to be ‘attached to it’, and another to be ‘detached from it’;—how could there be such diverse notions, if Conjunction and Disjunction did not exist, as something distinct, in the two things? A particular notion in regard to a thing cannot be possible without the presence of something peculiar; otherwise everything would be possible always and everywhere.”—(658)
