> There can be no such quality as ‘elasticity’, because things are in a ‘perpetual flux’, and hence nothing can be lasting (*sthita*); if there were any such thing, it should continue to exist in that same form.—(687)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* points out objections against the third kind of Momentum (i.e. Elasticity);—[*see verse 687 above*]

[The name of this Quality appears throughout in this work in the form ‘*Sthitasthāpaka*’, though the form in which it is known from the *Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika* books is ‘*Sthitisthāpaka*’. That the former form is not an error of the copyist or the printer is clear from this *Text*, where the first term in the compound is clearly stated to be ‘*sthita*’.]

That is to say, the ‘*Sthita*’, ‘lasting’, thing, of which this Quality is said to be the ‘*Sthāpaha*’, ‘re-establisher’,—is that thing by itself *not-lasting*? Or is it by itself *lasting*? Only these two alternatives are possible.—If it is *not-lasting*, then as in a moment it will have ceased to exist, what would be there which the Quality in question would *re-establish*? On the other hand, if it is, by itself, *lasting*,—then, if the thing in question would be existent,—then, as all existing things continue to exist in their own form,—i.e. without deviating from it,—theng would continue in the same form; and in that case, what would be the need for assuming a ‘re-establisher’ of it, which would have nothing to do?—(687)
