> What is desired to be proved could be proved as being due to such causes as an imaginary convention arising from mere whim and so forth. The existence of ‘number’ in cognition and other things also may be due to the same cause.—(645)



## Kamalaśīla

Causes apart from the ‘Elephant, etc.’ are already admitted (by us also) in the shape of *imaginary Convention* and the like; so that the argument adduced is entirely futile (the conclusion being admitted by us).

The term ‘and so forth’ is meant to include the Remembrance of Convention and such other things.

If however what you intend to prove is the fact of the notions in question having causes other than the said Imaginary Convention and the like, then the reason adduced is *inconclusive*. This is shown by means of a *Reductio ad Absurdum*—‘*The existence of Number in Cognition*, *etc., etc*.’;—‘*The same cause*’,—i.e. the fact of being different from the notions (of Elephant, etc.).—What is meant is that the ‘Number’ involved in such notions as ‘*One* Cognition’, ‘*Two* Cognitions’, ‘*Five* Actions’, would be due to the same Cause; as here too ‘the difference from the said notions’ is present:—As a matter of fact the said Number is not due to this circumstance; hence the Reason is *Inconclusive*.—(645)
