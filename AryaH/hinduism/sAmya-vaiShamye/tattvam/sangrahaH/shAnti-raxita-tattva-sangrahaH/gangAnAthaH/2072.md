> [The words of Buddha are] well-knit,—they propound a compatible method,—and set forth what is useful for men; even in regard to perceptible things, they are not, in the least degree, annulled by the two means (and forms) of cognition.—(3343)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be urged that—“The word of *Buddha* also is contrary to all forms of valid Cognition”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3343 above*]

‘*Well-knit*’,—the various sentences form one composite whole comprehending one and the same purpose; they are not disconnected, like such

stray sentences as ‘ten pomegranates’, ‘six cakes’ and so forth.

A ‘*compatible*’—i.e. practicable—‘*method*’—in the shape of meditating upon *soul-less-ness*—is taught in them; and they do not lay down such impracticable methods as the securing of the crest-jewel of the king of serpents.

‘*They set forth what is useful for men*’—in the shape of Prosperity and the Highest good; they do not set forth such useless things as the investigation of the subject of the teeth of crows.

Says the Opponent—“All this is applicable to the words of *Kapila* and other teachers also”.

*Answer*;—‘*Even in regard to, etc., etc*.’—‘*Perceptible*’—i.e. regarded as amenable to Perception and Inference;—‘*not annulled by the two means of Cognition*’—Perception and Inference; because the real state of things is exactly as spoken of in the words.

That is to say, what is regarded as amenable to Perception is the fivefold group of *Thought-phases*—in the shape of the conceptions of (a) the *Blue* and other objects, (*b*) Pleasure, Pain and other Feelings, (c) the causes of these, (*d*) the Apprehension, (*e*) Love and Hate, etc,,—and it cannot be otherwise than what is asserted by *Buddha*; just like the *imperceptibility* of things regarded as imperceptible; so also of what other parties have regarded as perceptible,—such as the various varieties of Colour, Sound and the rest, Pleasure, etc., and Substances, Actions, Universals and Conjunctions;—also such things as functioning through the potencies of things, and the rest are regarded as amenable to Inference,—all these are exactly as asserted (by the words of *Buddha*). Similarly too, the four ‘Noble Paths’, which are not regarded as amenable to Inference, are actually found to be not so amenable; just as the Soul and other things which are regarded by other parties as amenable to Inference functioning through the potency of things.

The particle ‘*api*’, also’, indicates that the words are not otherwise, even in regard to things that are *not perceptible*. For instance, what the words of *Buddha* have taught, for the removal of Love, etc., is the doctrine of ‘No-soul’ as contrary to and counteracting the doctrine of ‘Soul’ which is at the root of that Love and Hate, etc. and the things emanating therefrom;—and they have not taught—like the words of *Kapila* and others—such means as Bathing, performance of the *Agnihotra* and so forth, which are not incompatible with the root cause of Love, Hate, etc.—(3343)
