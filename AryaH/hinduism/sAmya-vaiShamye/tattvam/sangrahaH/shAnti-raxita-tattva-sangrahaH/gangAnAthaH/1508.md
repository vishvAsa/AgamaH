And yet there is no reliable person (known, who could be the author of the Veda);—the Veda therefore must be regarded as unreliable’.”—[see *Ślokavārtika*—on sentence, 108-110].—(2336-2338)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The *Mīmāṃsaka* next sets forth these objections of the opponent against his doctrines:—[*see verses 2336-2338 above*]

The ‘meaning of sentence’ consists in the Injunction or Prohibition of particular acts as associated with particular means of accomplishment; herein too lies the validity or efficiency of the Vedic Injunction as a ‘Means of Right Cognition’; it does not rest in what is expressed by *words*, Consequently when the validity or authority or reliability of the Veda has to be proved,—what has been established regarding the eternality of the Word, its meaning and the connection of these, is of no use in the matter at issue.

Further, whenever there is *cognition of the meaning of a sentence*, it is always found to be *based upon Convention*; e.g. sentences like ‘*ād-guṇaḥ*’ (Pānini’s *Sūtra*, defining what is ‘guṇa’), bring about the cognition of what is meant by the technical terms ‘*guṇa*’, ‘*vṛddhi*’ and the like;—the cognition of the meaning of the Injunctive Sentence is *cognition of the meaning of a sentence*;—hence this is a reason based upon the nature of things.—This is what is shown in the words—‘*In accordance with Conventions*, *etc. etc*.’ ‘*Like the technical terms*, *etc*. *etc*.’—The affix ‘*vati*’ has the sense of the Locative.

In support of the said idea it is added—‘*without any basis*’.—That is, it is just possible that without any reason,—through their unbridled imagination,—for the purpose of making a living—the ‘Sacrificers’ have assumed the meanings of such Vedic sentences as—‘Desiring Heaven, one should offer the *Agnihotra*’.

Then again, as a matter of fact, whatever is a *compilation* is a human product,—e.g. Dramas and Stories,—and the Veda is a compilation of words;—hence this is a reason based on the nature of the thing.

Thus then, as the Veda is a human work, it must be unreliable—like the words of the man by the roadside.

It might be that it is reliable because it is the work of a reliable person. The answer to that is—‘*There is no reliable person known*, *etc. etc*.’—(2336-2338)

To the above, the *Mīmāṃsaka* makes the following answer:—[*see verses 2339-2340 next*]
