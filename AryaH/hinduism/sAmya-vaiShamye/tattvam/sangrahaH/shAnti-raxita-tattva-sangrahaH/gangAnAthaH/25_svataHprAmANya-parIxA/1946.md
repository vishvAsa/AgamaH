> For these reasons ‘self-sufficient validity’ is not possible in the Veda also; consequently please accept the view that the Veda has been composed and expounded by persons who are definitely recognised as free from defects.—(3107)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* sums up the argument—[*see verse 3107 above*]

‘*Kṛtākhyāta*’—composed and expounded.—‘*Expounded*’—Explained.—

‘*By persons free from defects—the* *Veda* *has been composed and expounded*—The compound thus is the ‘Instrumental *Tatpuruṣa*—‘*Niścita*’—‘definitely known’—qualifies the said ‘character of being composed and expounded by persons free from defects’.—This view, please accept,—if you wish to establish the validity (reliability) of the Veda.

What is meant is that,—if this view is accepted, then the validity would be *extraneous*; if this view is not accepted, then there can be no validity at all.—(3107)
