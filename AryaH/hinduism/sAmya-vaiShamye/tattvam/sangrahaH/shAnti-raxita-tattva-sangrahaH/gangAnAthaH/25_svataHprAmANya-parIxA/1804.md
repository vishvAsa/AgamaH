> “Just as validity is not proved by validity cognition,—so invalidity also is not proved by invalidity. In the case of one thing being dependent upon another thing of its own kind, there can be no resting ground; in the case of dependence upon something of another kind, its root is firmly established, because it is due to another cause.”—(2864-2865)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Something of another kind*’—i.e. *Invalidity*;—this is to be construed with—‘the root is firmly established’.—The reason for this is stated in the words—‘*because it is due to another cause*’; i.e. of which the cause consists of something else, in the shape of the Valid Cognition.

‘*Has its root firmly established*’—i.e. whose root is unshakable by reason of its being free from the defects of Infinite Regress, etc.—(2864-2865)
