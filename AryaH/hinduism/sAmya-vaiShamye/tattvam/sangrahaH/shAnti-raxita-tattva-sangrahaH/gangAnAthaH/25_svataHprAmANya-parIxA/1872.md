> It is because of the man having acted on the basis of a doubt, in regard to the ascertainment of validity,—that its being the proper means can be ascertained; so that there is this even when there is doubt.—(2976)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* proceeds to point out that the second kind of activity (that tending to the ascertainment of *validity*) is all the more proper,—where there is Doubt regarding validity:—[*see verse 2976 above*]

Because, in regard to the ascertainment of validity, the man acts through a doubtful idea, and thereby he ascertains the fact of the thing being the proper *Means*,—therefore it is only right that there should be activity in regard to that Means, even when there is Doubt.—(2976)

*Question*:—“How is the fact of its being the *Means* ascertained?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2977-2979 next*]
