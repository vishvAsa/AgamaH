> “Just as, in the case of the validity of sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by another cognition produced by the same sense-organ,—the same should be asserted to be the basis in the case of the Veda also.”—(2903)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If it be argued that—‘even the operation of such other cognitions as are brought about by the same means as the cognition in question makes the validity of this latter *extraneous*’,—the argument *is futile* (superfluous).—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2903 above*]

‘*Definite basis*’—as stated in the first line of *Text* 2901.—(2903)

*Question*:—How can this be said in regard to the Veda?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2904-2905 next*]
