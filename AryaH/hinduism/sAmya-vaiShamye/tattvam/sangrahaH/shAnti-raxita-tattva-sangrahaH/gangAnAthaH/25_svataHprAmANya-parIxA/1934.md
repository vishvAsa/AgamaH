## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 3090*]:

Further, it is a mere assertion of yours that—“the Cognition produced by the Vedic Injunction does not vary at different times and places, etc.”. This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 3090 above*]

It has been argued under *Text* 2906, that—“the validity of verbal and other Cognitions is not to be proved by means of Inference, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3091 above*]

[*verse 3091*]:

That argument is called ‘*Redtuctio ad Absurdum*’ which indicates an undesirable possibility; and it is not undesirable that the validity of Perception should be proved by Inference; hence what has been urged cannot be a *Reductio ad Absurdum*.—How the validity of Perception can be proved by Inference has been shown before; this is what is recalled in the words—‘*For instance*, *etc*. *etc*.’—‘*Like other perceptions*’—i.e. like Perceptions bearing upon things before one’s eyes.—(3091)
