> Who can be capable of definitely apprehending, from the mere nature of the cognition itself, the capacity of the cognised thing, as it stands, to bring about its apprehension and attainment?—(2834)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“Inasmuch as the Capacity is not anything different from the Cognition,—when the Cognition has been apprehended, the Capacity also becomes apprehended as a matter of course; then why cannot it be apprehended?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2834 above*]

‘*Bodha*’ is *apprehension*; ‘*āpti*’ is *attainment*;—‘*of the cognised thing as it stands*’;—the capacity to bring about the said *apprehension* and *attainment*—[who can apprehend?]

‘*Mere*’—independently of the properties of the cause,—such as ‘Relationship’ and the like.—(2834)

*Question* “Why can no one apprehend it?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2835 next*]
