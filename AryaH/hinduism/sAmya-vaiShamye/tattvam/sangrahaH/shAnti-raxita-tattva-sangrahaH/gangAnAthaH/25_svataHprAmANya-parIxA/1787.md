> ‘Difference’ among things has been explained as consisting in their being associated with contrary (divergent) properties; so that, if on the appearance of the cognition, there is non-appearance of the capacity,—the said contrary property is clearly present in the capacity.—(2830)

> With reference to all things, it has been proved that there is ‘perpetual flux’; hence it is not possible for any efficient causal factor to impose a ‘capacity’ upon things.—Such things have no subsequent existence, by virtue of which they could acquire a capacity from other causes, for the bringing about of any effect.—(2831-2832)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2830*]:

The following might be urged—“It may be that no Capacity can be imposed upon an indivisible thing subsequently; why cannot it be imposed upon what is divisible?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2830 above*]

The following *Text* proceeds to point out the objection that is specially applicable when things are impermanent:—[*see verses 2831-2832 above*]

[*verses 2831-2832*]:

‘*For the bringing*, *etc*. *etc*.’—such as the definite cognition of things.

The rest is easily understood.—(2831-2832)
