> When I have recourse to activity on the basis of a doubtful cognition,—if i succeed in obtaining the fruit of that activity, then certainty regarding the validity of that cognition would be automatically apprehended; it cannot be ascertained in any other way.—Nor can it be reasonable to raise the question as to ‘how the man has recourse to the said means for the simple reason that there is no other way available. As a matter of fact, without the means, no one can get at the end.—Thus, even when acting on the basis of a doubtful cognition, the man does not lose his character of being a sane person.—(2977-2979)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Acting on the basis of a doubtful Cognition*’; i.e. having recourse to activity, through a were suspicion that his Cognition *may* be valid and right.

The rest is easily understood; hence it is not explained in detail.—(2977-2979)
