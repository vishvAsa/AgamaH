> No validity could belong to the cognition of a thing that is destroyed immediately on being born,—or to auditory perception,—because these would not be corroborated by the eye and other means of cognition.—(2900)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, if the validity of a Cognition were due to corroboration by other Cognitions,—then no validity could belong to the Cognition of a thing that has been born and immediately destroyed, or to the auditory perception; as no other cognition could operate upon them.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2900 above*]

‘*Not corroborated*, *etc. etc*.’—i.e. not related to one another by the relation based upon the sameness of their object.

The argument may be formulated thus:—That which does not need corroboration by other cognitions must be regarded as self-sufficient in its validity;—e.g. the auditory cognition produced once, and the cognition of what has been destroyed;—the cognition of what is asserted in the Veda does not need corroboration by other cognitions; hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—(2900)
