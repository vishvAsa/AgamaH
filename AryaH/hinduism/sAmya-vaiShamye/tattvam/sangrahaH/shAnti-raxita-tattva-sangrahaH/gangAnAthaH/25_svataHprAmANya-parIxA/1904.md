> Unless people know the sticks they cannot have any idea of the stick-holder. Thus the idea of the ‘self-validity’ being indicated by the absence of defects becomes discarded by self-contradiction.—The absence of defects can qualify the ‘word’ only when ascertained by that means of cognition which consists of nonapprehension; and in this way validity of a cognition would be due to something extraneous to itself.—



## Kamalaśīla

It has been asserted above (2890) that—“the assertion, valid by itself, is indicated by the absence of defects—This is not right; because excellences are beyond the reach of the senses, and when they cannot be cognised, the *absence of defects* also, which consists in the *presence of excellences*, cannot be noticed.—This is what is said in the words—‘*The absence of defects* *cannot serve* *as an indicator*’; that is, it cannot serve the purpose of indicating the validity; because it is itself uncognised.—(3038-3039)

The following *Text* shows that what is itself unknown cannot serve as an indicator:—[*see verses 3040-3041 above*]

Further, *absence of defects* may be a qualification; but even so, the objection remains,—as there is possibility of self-contradiction. For instance, if Validity is indicated and qualified by the *absence of defects*, then it would clearly mean that Validity is *extraneous*; and this would go against and discard the assertion that Validity is *inherent*.

This same idea is further clarified in the words—‘*the absence of defects can qualify*, *etc. etc*.’—If the *absence of defects* is ascertained through the Means of Cognition known as ‘Non-apprehension’, then alone it could serve as a qualification (and an indicator); because what is not ascertained cannot serve as a qualification; and there is no other Means of Cognition that could bring about the certain Cognition of the *absence* (of defects);—consequently it becomes clearly asserted that the Validity of the Cognition follows from Non-apprehension, which is something different from the Cognition itself.—(3040-3041)
