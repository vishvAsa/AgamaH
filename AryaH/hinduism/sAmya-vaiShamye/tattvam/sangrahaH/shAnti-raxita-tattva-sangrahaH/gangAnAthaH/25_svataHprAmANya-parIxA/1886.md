> Similarly, the invalidity of cognition must be taken as following from its being of the nature of apprehension, and is discarded by the cognition of its being in conformity with the real nature of things and by the cognition of efficiency of its source.—If ‘invalidity’ were due to extraneous causes, there would be infinite regress; because it could be dependent upon the valid cognition, and this is itself unstable.—(3002-3003)



## Kamalaśīla

An ‘*a*’ should be read before ‘*pramāṇatā*’.

‘*Yathārthajñāna*’ is Cognition of its being in conformity with the real state of things;—‘*Hetūtthaguṇa-jñāna*’ is Cognition of the efficiency of the cause,—These two terms form a Copulative Compound,

It has been argued (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*) under *Text* 2863, that—“If it is due to extraneous causes, then there is no Infinite Regress, because it would be dependent upon Validity and this is there all right”.—The answer to this is—‘*If Invalidity were due*, *etc*.’—‘*Etat*’ stands for Invalidity,—‘*tat*’, for the Valid Cognition.—(3002-3003)

*Question*:—“Why is it unstable, not firmly established?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 3004-3005 next*]
