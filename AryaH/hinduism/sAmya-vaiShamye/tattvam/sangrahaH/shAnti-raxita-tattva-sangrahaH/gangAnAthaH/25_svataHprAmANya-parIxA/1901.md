> It is true that the assertion is not vitiated by the defects, which are warded off by the excellences; but as there can be no certainty regarding the excellences, there can be no certainty regarding the said fact (of not being vitiated).—(3036)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted, under *Text* 2888 that—“the assertion does not become vitiated by the defects which are warded off by the excellence of the Teacher, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3036 above*]

It may be true that the assertion of highly qualified men is not vitiated by defects, these latter being warded off by the excellences; but even so, inasmuch as the excellences present in the ‘chain’ of other persons is beyond the reach of the senses, there can be no certainty regarding it; and in the absence of such certainty, there can be no certainty regarding the assertion of the qualified person; and what has not been duly ascertained cannot be self-sufficient in its validity.—(3036)
