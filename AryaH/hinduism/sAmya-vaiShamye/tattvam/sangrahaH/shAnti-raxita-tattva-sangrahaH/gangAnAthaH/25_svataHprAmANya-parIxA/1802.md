> “Just as in the case of the initial cognition, so in that of the other also, there would be infinite regress, as before; and seeking for them one after the other, we could not secure a resting ground.—In case the cognition of the perfection is not held to be one that has its validity dependent upon the presence of those perfections in its cause,—then the initial cognition of the object also should not need the valid cognition of perfection in its cause.—Thus then, even going along to a long distance, if one has to admit, at some stage or the other, the self-validity of the cognition,—it is far better to admit it at the very first step.”—(2858-2860)



## Kamalaśīla

What is meant is that—just as in the initial cognition, the validity is dependent upon the perfections apprehended by another cognition,—so should it be in other cognitions also.

‘*As before*’—as in the case of certainty of validity arising from corroboration.

‘*One after the other*’—in each preceding cognition of perfections.

If, through fear of Infinite Regress, it be held that the validity of the cognition of perfection is inherent in it, self-sufficient,—then what hostility should there be against the cognitions of the object itself,—by virtue of which its validity is held to be *extraneous*, not *inherent*? We do not perceive any reason for this.

Thus then the flying bird, not perceiving the end of the other shore, has to return to the place whence it started; consequently, there is no need for the making of baseless assumptions.—This is what is pointed out by the words—‘*In case the cognition of the perfection*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Dependent upon the perfection*’—i.e. that which has its validity dependent upon the certain cognition of the perfection.—(2858-2860)
