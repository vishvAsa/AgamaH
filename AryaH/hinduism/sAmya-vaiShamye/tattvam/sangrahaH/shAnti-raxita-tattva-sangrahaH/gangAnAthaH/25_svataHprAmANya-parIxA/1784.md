> Whether the capacity be different or both (different and non-different),—the *pramāṇa* itself must be eternal,—being associated with the eternal capacity.—(2825)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author now admits the last three alternative views (for the sake of argument), and then points out objections against them:—[*see verse 2825 above*]

‘*Pṛthaktvam*’—i.e. the view that the Capacity is *different*, from the Cognition.—‘*Ubhayātmakam*’, ‘Both’;—this is by way of illustration; it should be taken as including the view that ‘it is neither *different* nor *non-different*’,—Or this last also may be taken as mentioned in the same term ‘*ubhayātmaka*’; as this also consists of *both*—i.e. the denial of *both*.

Under all these three views, the Cognition must be eternal, by reason of its being related to the Capacity, which is eternal.—(2825)

*Question*:—“How so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2826 next*]
