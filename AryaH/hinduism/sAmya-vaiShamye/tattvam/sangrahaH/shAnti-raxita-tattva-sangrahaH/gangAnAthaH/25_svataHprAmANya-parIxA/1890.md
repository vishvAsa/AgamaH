> Under the theory of the self-validity of cognitions, the validity being ascertained by itself, why should an effort be made to prove the existence of a sublating cognition?—Because, when the validity of a cognition is not definitely cognised by itself, its sublating cognition is got at without effort. Thus, why should there be said to be ‘three cognitions’ for the investigator? In fact there is not room for a single one; the conviction regarding it having come about by itself.—If it be held that—“even when no sublating cognition is actually found, there arises suspicion due to doubt; because the non-apprehension of sublating cognition is not always concomitant with its absence”;—then, under the circumstances, why have you become satisfied with only three (cognitions)? Because, as before, even when the sublating cognition is not there, its presence could always be suspected; and this suspicion of sublation could not cease until one met with conformity to effective action; hence the restriction to three only is entirely futile.—Thus then, even in a case where no sublation has actually appeared, its presence can always be suspected; specially as casuistry can never lead to the ascertainment of truth.—Even though a man may have had the unsublated cognition of the conch-shell as yellow, throughout his life,—such cognition can never become valid.—(3010-3017)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*) under *Text* 2869, that—“If, even after due effort at seeking for it, no other sublating Cognition is found,—on account of there being no basis for it,—then no Cognition sublative of the first Cognition would be found, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3010-3017 above*]

If Validity is ascertained by itself, then Validity being invariably concomitant with conviction,—where there is *no* *conviction*, there, by implication, would be Invalidity; so that the presence of its sublating Cognition becomes secured without any effort; hence any effort to prove the existence of the said sublating Cognition would be futile. So that there is no room for even a single Cognition on the part of the investigator; what to say of *three*? Hence when it is said that ‘the Cognition of the investigator does not proceed beyond three’, it is something entirely irrelevant. This is what is pointed out in the *Text* beginning with the word ‘*Ataḥ*’ (*Text* 3012).

The following might be urged—“The absence of the sublating Cognition cannot be ascertained by mere non-apprehension of it; because even when a thing is existent, it is not apprehended if it happens to be remote, or very small, or hidden; so that *non-existence* is not invariably concomitant with *non-apprehension*; hence it is that effort is made for proving that there is no sublating Cognition”.

If that is so, then please give up the idea of any such restriction as that ‘the investigator should have only *three* Cognitions’; because, as in the case of the first Cognition, so in all other Cognitions, the presence of sublation would be suspected; until the Cognition of the fruit (result) of the Cognition has appeared,—how can the suspicion of sublation be prevented, in view of which, there could be the restriction of the number of Cognitions to *three* only? Unless there is proof for it, mere proclamation cannot bring about the cessation of suspicion in the minds of intelligent men. Because the whole investigation regarding Cognitions proceeds on the basis of real things; and what has been started is not mere Casuistry, whereby only a few Cognitions are examined.

If the validity of Cognitions rested upon the limitation of the investigation to *three* Cognitions only,—then in the case of men who have suffered from the jaundiced eye throughout their life, as the conch-shell is always cognised as *yellow*,—that Cognition would be quite valid.—(3010-3017)
