## Kamalaśīla

For instance, the author of the *Nirukta* and other authorities describe ‘Heaven’ as—‘the abode of Personalities superior to human beings,—located in such places as the summit of Mount *Meru*,—the place affording superhuman pleasures,—full of numerous amenities’;—while the *Mīmāṃsakas* describe it as ‘a particular form of happiness found among men’.

In regard to ‘Sacrifices’ also, there is difference of opinion. For example, it is heard that in ancient times it was only animals made of flour that were sacrificed; while other wicked and cruel people have declared that it was the living animal that was sacrificed.—(3088)
