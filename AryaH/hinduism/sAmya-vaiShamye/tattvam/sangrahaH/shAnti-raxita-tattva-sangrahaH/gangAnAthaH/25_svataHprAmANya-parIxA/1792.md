> In the case of poison and wine, it being found that they are similar to other things, and their effects do not appear immediately,—for the purpose of the certainty of the cognition that it is really poison or wine, it is necessary that its effects should be definitely perceived, in the shape of unconsciousness, sweating, incoherent talk and so forth.—In the same manner the existence of the capacity in the cognition can be ascertained only on the appearance of its effects.—(2837-2838)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* proceeds to explain the example of ‘Poison, etc.’ (cited under *Text* 2836):—[*see verses 2837-2838 above*]

‘*Being found, etc. etc*.’—the ‘finding’—perception—of its similarity to ‘*other* things’,—such for instance as the drink called ‘*Nāgara-pāna*’.

‘*And the effects, etc. etc*.’—‘*Effects*’—unconsciousness and the like;—the non-appearance of these immediately; that is, because their effects do not follow immediately.

‘*For the purpose of the certainty, etc. etc*.’—the sure Cognition that it is really Poison or Wine.

‘*The Capacity*’—in the Cognition, of apprehending and attaining (getting at) the cognised thing as it really exists.—(2837-2838)
