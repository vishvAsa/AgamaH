> If no difference is perceived,—then, on account of the suspicion of the thing being otherwise than cognised, there can be no certainty regarding validity, unless there is a cognition envisaging the resultant effect. In such a case even though the validity may be present there, it cannot be ascertained; it is recognised only through the subsequent cognition of its resultant activity. It is for this reason that the first cognition needs its corroboration; and for the same reason it is not necessary to seek for the corroboration of the corroborative cognition also.—(2970-2972)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2854, that—“Just as the first cognition would need corroboration by the second cognition, so should we seek for the corroboration of that corroborative cognition also”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2970-2972 above*]

Even in case where the Validity has been apprehended, there can be no certainty regarding it, because of the presence of the causes of misconception; and in such cases, the Validity is ascertained only extraneously, through the cognition of the resultant activity; and what is desired by the man having been secured by this, there is no need for further corroboration by another corroborative cognition; as there is in the case of the initial cognition.—(2970-2972)
