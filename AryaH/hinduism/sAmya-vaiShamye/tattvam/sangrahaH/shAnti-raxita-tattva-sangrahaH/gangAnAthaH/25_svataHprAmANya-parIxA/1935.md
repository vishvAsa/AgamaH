> The validity of all cognitions is not proved by other means of cognition; as it has been proved that there is no misconception involved in the case where there is cognition of effective action.—(3092)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2907, that—“If the validity of Cognition were proved by another Cognition, then, of this latter also, the validity would be proved by another and so on and on, there would be Infinite Regress”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3092 above*]

That there is no misconception in the case where there is Cognition of effective action has been proved above under *Text* 2959.

Thus validity being dependent upon corroboration by the Cognition of effective action, there can be no Infinite Regress.—(3092)
