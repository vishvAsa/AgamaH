## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Text*, the Author points out that the view of the Opponent is contrary to Inference,—and also asserts the establishment of his own view:—[*see verse 2940 above*]

The argument may be formulated as follows:—Things whose character has become subject to doubt and misconception can have their reality ascertained only by things extraneous to themselves,—e.g. the Post;—the validity of cognitions, for some people, has become the object of Doubt and Misconception; hence this is a Reason based on the nature of the thing concerned.

‘*Balibhuk*’ (Crow)—‘*Dhūma*’ (Smoke)—‘*hetūtthadoṣa*’ (defects in the source)—the ‘*pratyaya*’—notions of these;—these are to be construed, respectively, with the ‘*Sthāṇu*’ (Post)—‘*Teja*’ (Fire) and ‘*Aprāmāṇya*’ (Invalidity). [The presence of the *Crow* indicates that the upright object is the *Post*, not the *Man*.]

This shows the Invariable Concomitance of the Probans (with the Probandum).—(2940)
