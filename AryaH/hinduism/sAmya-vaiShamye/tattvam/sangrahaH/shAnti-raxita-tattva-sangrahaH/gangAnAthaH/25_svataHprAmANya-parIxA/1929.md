> Thus, in the case of the validity of sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by other cognitions produced by several sense-organs; but such is not found to be the case with the veda.—(3084)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2903, that—“just as in the case of the validity of Sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by another Cognition produced by the same sense-organ,—the same should be asserted to be the basis in the case of the *Veda* also”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3084 above*]

‘*Such is, etc. etc*.’—i.e. Corroboration by other Cognitions produced by several Sense-organs.—(3084)

*Question*:—“How is this found to be the basis in the case of Sense-perception?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3085 next*]
