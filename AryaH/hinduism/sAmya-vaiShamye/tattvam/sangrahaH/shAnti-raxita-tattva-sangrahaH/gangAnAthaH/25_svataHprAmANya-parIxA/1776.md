> You have made the assertion that—“the validity of all *pramāṇas*{GL_NOTE::} should be regarded as inherent in them”—[*Ślokavārtika*, *codanā-sūtra* 47].—now what is the meaning that you attach to this assertion?—(2812)

> “[What is meant is that] the capacity to bring about the apprehension of the cognisable thing, etc., belongs to the pramāṇas by their very nature; the capacity that is not inherent in a thing by itself cannot be produced by anything else.”—(2813)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2812*]:

With the following *Text*, the Author proceeds to point out objections against the above view (of the *Mīmāṃsaka*), by showing the insignificant character of his proposition:—[*see verse 2812 above*]

To this question—what is the meaning that you attach to this assertion?—the other party provides the following answer:—[*see verse 2813 above*]

[*verse 2813*]:

If Cognition is what is ‘*Pramāṇa*’ in the sense of the *form of Cognition*, then the capacity to bring about the apprehension of the cognisable,—i.e. the cognition of what is to be cognised,—must be inherent in it; because Cognition is of the nature of the apprehension of things.—If, however, the Eye and the Organs are meant to be ‘*Pramāṇa*’, in the sense of the ‘*means of Cognition*’, then the capacity to bring about the right cognition of things must be inherent in it; and the Vedic Injunction also must have the capacity inherent in it, of bringing about the cognition of things beyond the senses. All this is included under the term ‘*ādi*’, ‘etc.’ (in the compound ‘*meyabodhādike*’).

The argument in support of this idea is added in the words (of the second line)—‘*The capacity that is not, etc, etc*.’.—(2813)

The same idea is further explained by the *Mīmāṃsaka*:—[*see verse 2814 next*]
