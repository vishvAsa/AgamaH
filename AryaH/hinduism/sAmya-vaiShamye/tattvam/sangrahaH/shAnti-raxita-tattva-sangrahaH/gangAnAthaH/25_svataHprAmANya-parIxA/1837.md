## Kamalaśīla

The Buddhists and others have argued that the Words of the Veda must be false,—because they are words,—like such human assertions as ‘Fire is cool’.

The *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to show that this argument is ‘Inconclusive’.—[*see verse 2916 above*]

‘*In cases*’—such as that of the Vedic Injunction.

‘*These two ideas*’—i.e. the idea that the truth is otherwise than what has been said in the Veda, and also that what has been so said has had a defective source.

‘*Mere similarity*’—i.e. the mere fact of being ‘words’ and thereby being similar to human assertions.—(2916)

*Question*:—Why should mere similarity not be urged?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2917-2919 next*]
