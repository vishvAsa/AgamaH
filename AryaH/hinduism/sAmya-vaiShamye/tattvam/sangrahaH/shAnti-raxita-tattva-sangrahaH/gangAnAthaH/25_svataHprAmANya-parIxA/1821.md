> “Because the defects are not cognised, therefore they do not set aside the validity; not being set aside, it becomes established by itself here also.”—(2894)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*The validity is not set aside*’—such is the construction.

*Question*:—Why is it not set aside?

*Answer*:—‘*Because they are not cognised*’; the defects are discarded by the excellences, hence being non-existent, they are naturally ‘not cognised

‘*Not being set aside, etc*.’—established, because not set aside. When there is no exception to a general rule, it becomes automatically established.

‘*Here also*’—i.e. in the case of the words of the Trustworthy Person, not only in that of words not emanating from a Personality.—This is what is indicated by ‘*api*’.—(2894)
