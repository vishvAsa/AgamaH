> “If in the case of some one cognition, the validity is admitted to be inherent and self-sufficient,—then why should there be any hostility towards the self-validity of the first cognition itself?”—(2855)

> “If then the validity of sense-perception and other cognitions were dependent upon the perfect character (of their causes),—these perfections themselves could never be there without cognitions; hence one seeking for this other cognition apprehending the perfection of the cause would require yet another cognition apprehending the perfection of this last, and so on and on.”—(2856-2857)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2855*]:

It might be argued that—in the case of the Cognition which is in conformity with effective action, its validity is held to be inherent, self-sufficient; hence there can be no Infinite Regress.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2855 above*]

Under the second view also [that the extraneous validity is due to the recognition of the perfect character of the Cause] there would be Infinite Regress.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 2856-2857 above*]

[*verses 2856-2857*]:

Under the second view also [that the extraneous validity is due to the recognition of the perfect character of the Cause] there would be Infinite Regress.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 2856-2857 above*]

‘*Dependent upon, etc*.’—i.e. dependent upon the recognition of the perfect character of its cause.

‘*Validity*’—i.e. certainty regarding its validity.

‘*Could never be there*’—i.e. could not become fit for being regarded as being there.

‘*Tasyāpi*’—of the cognition apprehending the perfection.

‘*Anyaparicchinna, etc, etc*.’—i.e. the validity would be dependent upon the certainty of the perfection apprehended by another cognition.—(2856-2857)

An instance is cited in support of the above:—[*see verses 2858-2860 next*]
