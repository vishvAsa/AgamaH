> How validity can be due to excellences has been already explained; and so long as the excellences are not recognised, the absence of defects cannot be perceived.—Thus then, it cannot be right that the assertion, valid by itself, is indicated by the absence of defects; because, not being cognised, the absence of defects cannot serve as an indicator.—(3038-3039)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2889, that—“in the case of the assertion of trustworthy persons, two facts have been perceived—the absence of defects and the presence of excellences; and it has already been shown how validity cannot be due to the excellences”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3038-3039 above*]

‘*Has been explained*’—under *Text* 2988,

It has been asserted above (2890) that—“the assertion, valid by itself, is indicated by the absence of defects—This is not right; because excellences are beyond the reach of the senses, and when they cannot be cognised, the *absence of defects* also, which consists in the *presence of excellences*, cannot be noticed.—This is what is said in the words—‘*The absence of defects* *cannot serve* *as an indicator*’; that is, it cannot serve the purpose of indicating the validity; because it is itself uncognised.—(3038-3039)
