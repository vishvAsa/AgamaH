> The validity, being something indivisible, having been brought about by its own causes,—there would be no destruction of it by its dependence on something else; as such dependence is necessary only for bringing about certainty (regarding the validity).—(2841)

> The other *pramāṇa* is not needed for the bringing about of the validity itself; it is needed in the *pramāṇa* only for the cognition of certainty regarding its exact character.—(2842)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2841*]:

It has been argued (by *the* *Mīmāṃsaka*) under *Text* 2814, that—“the validity itself would be destroyed, if it were held to be dependent on something else”.

The following *Text* points out that this argument is ‘Inconclusive’:—[*see verse 2841 above*]

The same idea is f urther clarified:—[*see verse 2842 above*]

[*verse 2842*]:

The following might be urged:—“If you are seeking to prove the fact of the validity of Cognition being ‘extraneous’ in relation to the *Pramāṇa* itself, then we also admit it, and hence your argument is futile; because the existence of the Cognition itself is held to be proved by Presumption,—what to say of its *validity*, which consists in its Capacity?—In the matter, however, of the bringing about of its effect in the shape of the certain cognition of the object, the Cognition does not need anything else; that is why the validity has been described as ‘self-sufficient’, ‘inherent’”.

This cannot be right; because the certain cognition of the object of the Cognition cannot be got at without certainty regarding its validity. Because how can the object, which is still subject to doubt and uncertainty, be independent and self-sufficient, in the bringing about of its effect? If it were dependent upon apprehensions produced by other Means of Cognition,—how could you avoid Infinite Regress involved in your view? So what has been suggested is nothing.—(2842)
