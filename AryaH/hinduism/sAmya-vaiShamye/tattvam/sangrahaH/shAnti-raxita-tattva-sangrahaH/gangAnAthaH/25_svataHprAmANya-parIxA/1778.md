## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—‘Let the validity be destroyed; what is the harm?’

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows;—[*see verse 2815 above*]

‘*Root of the matter*’—i.e. Validity.—This is ‘*struck at the root*’—done away with—by the idea of ‘dependence on something else’;—because it is contrary to a character more extensive than that. Because ‘validity’ is ‘pervaded by’—less extensive than—‘independence’; how then could this ‘validity’ obtain a footing, if there were the said ‘dependence’, which is contrary to ‘Independence’ which pervades ‘validity’ itself?

‘*When, etc. etc*.’—points out the Invariable Concomitance between ‘Validity’ and ‘Independence’.

‘*Yena*’—Because.—(2815)

*Question*:—In what way does it destroy the means of establishing it?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2816 next*]
