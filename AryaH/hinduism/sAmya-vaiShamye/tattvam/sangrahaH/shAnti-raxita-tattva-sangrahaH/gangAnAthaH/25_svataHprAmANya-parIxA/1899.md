> Even though such a ‘trustworthy person’ may be born,—who could come to know of the host of his good qualities, and thereby have confidence in the words of such a trustworthy person?—If there were some one with supernormal vision who could perceive his excellent qualities,——what use could such a person have for any ‘words of the trustworthy person’? Because he would himself know all things, independently of all assertions. as for any other person, as he could not recognise the ‘trustworthy person’, he could never learn of things from his words.—(3032-3034)



## Kamalaśīla

Then again, granting that there is a ‘trustworthy person’; even so any ‘word’ (assertion) of such a person cannot be said to be known.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 3032-3034 above*]

Unless it has been found who the ‘trustworthy person’ is, it cannot be ascertained what is ‘the word of the trustworthy person’; and it is not possible to find out who is the ‘trustworthy person’; because the man who has got rid of all his ‘Afflictions and defects’ and who is capable of perceiving supersensuous things may be able to recognise the ‘trustworthy person’; but the word of such a trustworthy person can serve no useful purpose for such a man, as he would himself be able to perceive all things and as such would not depend, for his activity, upon the ‘trustworthy person’; hence the recognition of such a person would be of no use to him. As for other ordinary men, whose vision is limited, they cannot recognise the ‘trustworthy person’; and hence they cannot learn anything from the words of such a person; as there could be no certainty about it.—(3032-3034)
