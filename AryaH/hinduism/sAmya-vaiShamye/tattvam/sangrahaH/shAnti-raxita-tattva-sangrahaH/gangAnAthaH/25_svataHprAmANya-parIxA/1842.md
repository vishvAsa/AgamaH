> If the cognition is held to be not-momentary and even eternal, then this goes against what has been accepted elsewhere, and it is also nullified by reasoning.—(2925)



## Kamalaśīla

In another context, *Kumārila* has declared the *unity* and *eternality* of Cognitions, as declared by him in the following words—“For us, Cognitions being of the same nature as the Spirit (Soul), are held to be *eternal* and *one*” *[Ślokavārtika*—Eternality of Words, 404].

Under this view, the Proposition put forward (that Cognitions are *eternal*) would go against what has been accepted elsewhere,—as also against Inference. For instance, it has been held that Cognitions are momentary; as said in the *Bhāṣya* (Śabara)—“It is momentary and does not remain till the time of the appearance of another Cognition” (Sū. 1. 1. 5, page 9, line 17); and it also goes against the words of Kumārila himself, to the effect that—“Cognition does not continue to exist for a single moment” (*Ślokavārtika*—Sense-perception 55).—(2925)
