> That the verbal text has remained the same can be ascertained only by a person to whom all men, and all times and places are visible like the fruit in the hand; if it were not so, then, why should there have been a difference of opinion due to the divergence of time, place, persons and circumstances?—(3116-3117)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even as regards the verbal text, there can be no certainty regarding its being the same at all times and places, merely by seeing no change in it,—except to an omniscient person.—This is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 3116-3117 above*]

The argument in support of the preceding assertion is stated in the words—‘*If* *it* *were not so, etc. etc*.’—If the verbal text had remained the same, then there could be no difference of opinion—doubt—among persons, regarding it, by reason of the divergence of place, time, etc.—(3116-3117)
