> “If the very validity of the initial cognition were dependent upon other cognitions,—then, seeking for such corroborating cognitions at each step, we could get to no resting place; because, just as the first cognition would need corroboration by the second cognition, so should we seek for the corroboration of that corroborative cognition also.”—(2853-2854)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Mauliha*’—pertaining to the initial or first cognition; i.e. the validity inhering in the initial cognition.

Validity, if *extraneous*, could be due either to the corroboration of the resultant activity, or to the recognition of the perfect character of the cause of the cognition. The former, of these cannot be accepted; this is shown by the words—‘*Just as, etc. etc*.’—(2853-2854)
