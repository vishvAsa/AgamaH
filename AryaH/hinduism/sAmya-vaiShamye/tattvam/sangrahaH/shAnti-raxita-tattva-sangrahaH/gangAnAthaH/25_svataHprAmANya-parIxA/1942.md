> Just as repeated cognition is regarded as valid by itself,—so also in some cases wrong cognition is invalid by itself.—(3100)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2913, that—“Like valid Cognition, Invalid Cognition also operates upon its object by itself; but the fact of its being false cannot be apprehended without another means of Cognition”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3100 above*]

‘*Repeated Cognition*’—such Cognition as has been apprehended repeatedly.

Just as in some cases validity is recognised as self-sufficient—as asserted above;—in the same manner, in some cases, *wrongness* or *Invalidity* also is recognised by itself. For instance, it is found that people suffering from deranged vision recognise, through repeated experience, the wrongness of the illusion regarding the ‘Hair-tuft’ immediately after its appearance.—(3100)
