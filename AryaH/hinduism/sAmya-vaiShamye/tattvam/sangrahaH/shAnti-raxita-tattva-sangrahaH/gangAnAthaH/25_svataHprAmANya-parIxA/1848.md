> If it is held that—“the self-sufficiency of the validity of cognitions having been accepted as a fact, the arguments that have been set forth are only for the purpose of refuting the denial of the same”,—even that cannot be right; as there can be no possibility of such denial; there can be a suspicion of such denial, only so long as the firm conviction regarding the validity has not appeared;—as soon as that conviction has appeared, whence could there be any suspicion regarding invalidity,—for the removing of which your attempt could be useful? when a man has been convinced that the tall thing standing before him is a post, he no longer suspects it to be anything else.—(2932-2934)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—“when we put forward our arguments, it is not for proving the validity of the Cognition proceeding from the Veda; it is for refuting the invalidity that has been urged by the other party”.

This also cannot be right.—Why?—Because there can be no possibility of any suspicion of invalidity.—It has been declared that ‘Conviction and Doubt are mutually destructive’ (2930);—so that when Conviction has come about, whence could there be any suspicion of invalidity,—for the removing of which suspicion, your attempt at setting forth arguments could be fruitful?

An example is cited—‘*When a man, etc. etc*.’—i.e. by the observer who has become convinced of its being the *post*.

‘*Any thing else*’—in the shape of *tree* or *man* or some such thing.—(2932-2934)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then how can the suspicion of *invalidity* be removed without setting forth arguments?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2935 next*]
