> If that were not so, then the capacity could not be eternal; as it would not continue in the same form;—being at times associated with the cognition, and not-associated with it at others.—(2826)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*If that were not so*’—i.e. ‘if the Cognition associated with the Capacity were not-eternal,—then, the Capacity itself could not be eternal

“Why?”

‘*Because it would not continue in the same form*’—i.e. because there would not be continuance of the same form.

The said ‘non-continuance of the same form’ is pointed out, by the words—‘*being at times*, *etc. etc*.’;—if the Cognition is not-eternal, then the Capacity would have two forms,—one associated with the Cognition, and the other not-associated with the Cognition; and it is not possible for the same thing to have two mutually contradictory characters; as in that case it would cease to be one; and there would be an end to all notions of difference.—(2826)
