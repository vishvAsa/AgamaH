> Even when the excellences are there, the cognition of the defects of the man do appear. if there is non-cognition of excellences, how can there be any cognition of the absence of defects?—(3042)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the other party, under the *Text* 2893, that—“while the excellences are there, there does not appear any Cognition of the defects of the man”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3042 above*]

If, while the excellences are there, there can be no Cognition of the defects (of the Man), then,—as the excellences, lying within the ‘chain’ of another person, and hence beyond the senses, would not be cognised,—there could be no certainty regarding the *absence* *of* *defects*; as the ‘absence of defects’ consists in the ‘presence of excellences’; and unless there is Cognition of the place devoid of the Jar, there can be no Cognition of the *absence* *of* *the Jar*.—(3042)

The same idea is further clarified—[*see verse 3043 next*]
