## Kamalaśīla

Activity is of two kinds—(*a*) tending to fruitful activity, and (*b*) tending to the ascertainment of validity.—As regards the former, it has been already explained how that activity is possible, even when there is Doubt; and the reason for this lies in the fact that Sense-perception prompts man to activity by the mere Cognition of the thing envisaged by it; and such activity does not detract from the cleverness of the man; because in the case of agriculturists, activity is found, even though the issue in the matter is doubtful. This is what is meant by the Text.—It will not be right to assert that—“agriculturists are regarded as intelligent agents only because they have recourse to activity only when they are *sure* regarding the efficacy of the measures adopted by them—Because the Measures are always dependent upon the nature of what is meant to be obtained through them; and hence, if there is no certainty regarding the *End*, there can be none regarding the *Means* (or Measures).—(2975)
