> In the case of words emanating from personalities, there is always room for doubt whether there are defects or not; and as it has been proved that there must be an author of the Veda, it is not true that we can have no suspicion regarding the presence of defects in it.—(3071)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2895, that—“In the case of words emanating from personalities, there is always room for doubt, whether there are defects or not; in the case of the Veda, however, there being no author, there can be absolutely no suspicion, for us, regarding the presence of defects”.

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verse 3071 above*]

Under the Chapter dealing with the ‘Revealed Word’, it has been proved that there must have been an author of the Veda; hence the statement ‘because there is no author’ cannot be admitted. Hence it is *not* true that, for us, intelligent people, there is no suspicion regarding the presence of defects in the Veda; in fact, the suspicion is actually there.—(3071)
