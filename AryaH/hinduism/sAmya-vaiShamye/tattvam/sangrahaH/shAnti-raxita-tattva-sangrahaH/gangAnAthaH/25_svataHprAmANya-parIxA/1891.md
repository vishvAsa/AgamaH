> It is just possible that the sublating cognition does not appear because the cause of the removal of the defect is not available, or because of some other reason; hence the suspicion regarding the possibility of its being there does not cease.—(3018)



## Kamalaśīla

The following question might be raised:—If the Cognition is *invalid*, how is it that the sublation of it does not appear after the investigation of the *three* Cognitions?—The answer may be that, because it does not appear, therefore it is concluded that it does not exist.—The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3018 above*]

‘*Cause of the removal of the defect*’—such as the dropping of the juice of the *Droṇa-flower* into the eyes (which cures the jaundice);—when no such remedy is available, the Cognition sublating the Cognition of *yellowness* in the conch-shell does not appear.

‘*Or because of some other reason*’;—for instance, when looking at the mass of mirage and mistaking it for water, if one does not move up to it, the corrective Cognition envisaging the sandy desert as distinguished from water does not appear.—(3018)
