> How can such a ‘capacity’ of *pramāṇas*—which is non-eternal, as coming into existence through the efficiency of its cause,—be held by you to be ‘natural’ ‘inherent’?—(2819)

> If the ‘capacity’ (of *pramāṇas*) were ‘natural’ (inherent), the *pramāṇas* themselves would have to be regarded as eternal and without cause. because *pramāṇas* would be of the same nature, they would surely be eternal and without cause.—(2820)

> In the event of the *pramāṇas* being without cause, they would be either permanently existent or permanently non-existent; because they would not be dependent upon anything; under the circumstances, the effect contingent upon those *pramāṇas* could not be occasional;—as a matter of fact, however, the form as well as the effect of *pramāṇas* is found to be occasional;—hence it is clear that for you, the ‘capacity’ in question cannot be ‘natural’ (inherent).—(2821 -2822)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2819*]:

If it is meant that the Capacity is *not-different* (from the thing, the *Pramāṇa*),—then, it could not be ‘natural’, ‘inherent Because things, as coming into existence through the efficiency of their causes, must be non-eternal; so that the Capacity also, if non-different from the thing, would have to be regarded as *non-eternal*, on account of its coming into existence through the efficiency of its cause. Otherwise, not sharing the same fate, the two could not be *non-different*

This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2819 above*]

Further, if the *Pramāṇas* are *non-different* from the said ‘Capacity’, they would themselves, like the Capacity, be *eternal* and *without cause*.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2820 above*]

[*verse 2820*]:

*Question*:—“What is the harm if that is so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2821-2822 above*]

[*verses 2821-2822*]:

If they are without cause, they must either exist for ever, or never exist at all. That in the event of their eternality, they must exist for ever—is well known: hence it has not been mentioned separately.

Another incongruity is pointed out—‘*Under* *the* *circumstances*, *etc. etc*.’

‘*Tadāyattam*’—contingent upon the *Pramāṇas*.

This shows that the Proposition of the other party is contrary to Perception and Inference. For instance, that the form of the Cognitions and their Means is *occasional*, is known by direct Perception,—and is also inferred from the fact of its effects appearing successively, one after the other. Thus these two Means of Cognition clearly set aside the idea of the said Eternality of Cognitions.—(2821-2822)

In the following *Text*, the other party makes an attempt at avoiding the two incongruities just urged:—[*see verse 2823 next*]
