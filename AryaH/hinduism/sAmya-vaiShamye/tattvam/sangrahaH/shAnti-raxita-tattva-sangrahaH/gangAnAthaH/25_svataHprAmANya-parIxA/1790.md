> [The said capacity cannot be apprehended with certainty] because even in the case of such cognitions as that of the ‘hair-tuft’ which clearly envisage the thing cognised—which are admittedly invalid and wrong,—the ‘nature of the cognition’ is present.—(2835)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Keśa, etc. etc*.’—In the case of such illusory perceptions as those of the ‘Hair-tuft’ (perceived on pressing the Eyes).

What is meant by this is as follows:—Even when the Capacity has been apprehended, as the apprehension resembles an invalid cognition, there can be no certainty regarding it; just as in the case of the potency of antidotes to poison. Mere apprehension cannot bring about certainty; as confirmation by actual appearance is needed for that purpose; and there is certainty only in regard to that aspect on which other properties have not been imposed by causes of misconception.—(2835)

*Question*:—“How then can it be known with certainty?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2836 next*]
