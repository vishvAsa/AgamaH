> “For its own production, the jar needs such causes as the lump of clay, the potter’s stick, the wheel and other things; but in the action of containing water, it does not need these causes.—Thus, ultimately, there must be self-sufficiency of the validity; if the validity were due to other causes, then there would be an infinite regress.”—(2851-2852)



## Kamalaśīla

*Answer*:—“*If* *the validity*, *etc. etc*.’—(2851-2852)
