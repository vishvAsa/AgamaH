> For the above reasons, it is absolutely necessary that there should be definite cognition of all the three factors—(1) absence of defects, (2) absence of invalid cognitions and (3) presence of excellences.—(3051)



## Kamalaśīla

So far it has been explained that the *absence of defects* and other conditions do not, by their mere presence, help in the bringing about of the certainty regarding Validity; now the Author proceeds to explain in detail that if the certainty regarding the said *Absence of Defects* were essential, then (*a*) the validity would be extraneons, and (6) there would be an Infinite Regress:—[*see verse 3051 above*]

\(1\) Absence of defects, (2) absence of the two kinds of Invalid Cognition (Doubt and Misconception), and (3) the presence of excellences,—the Cognition—certainty—of all these must be admitted. Otherwise, there could be no certainty regarding *Validity*, as has been explained already,—(3051)

*Question*:—“If the definite Cognition of these three is not admitted, what then?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3052 next*]
