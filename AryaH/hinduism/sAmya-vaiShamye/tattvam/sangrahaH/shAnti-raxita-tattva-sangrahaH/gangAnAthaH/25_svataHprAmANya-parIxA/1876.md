> The following might be urged:—“it being ascertained that its validity is due to extraneous causes, the cognition should be regarded as ‘cognised’”.—There is no in congruity in this.—(2983)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might he urged—“The validity of all Cognitions being equally due to extraneous causes, why should there be this distinction? And under these circumstances, the *Cognition* itself becomes the *object cognised*, which is extremely incongruous”.

This is the objection urged by the Opponent. The answer to this is that—‘*there is no incongruity in this*’;—‘*adaḥ*’, this.—There is no incongruity in this, as ‘cognition’ and ‘cognised’ are relative terms like ‘cause’ and ‘effect’, and ‘Father’ and ‘Son’.—(2983)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verses 2984-2985 next*]
