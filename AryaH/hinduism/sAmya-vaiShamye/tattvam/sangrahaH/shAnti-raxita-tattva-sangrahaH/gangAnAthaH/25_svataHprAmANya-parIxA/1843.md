> (*a*) It has been demonstrated in detail that all things are in ‘perpetual flux’;—(*b*) As for the eternal thing, it is never produced; what need then could it have of a cause?—(2926)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* points out how the assertion of the Eternality of Cognitions is nullified by reasoning:—[*see verse 2926 above*]

If Cognition is eternal, then it cannot be right to hold that it needs a Cause; this is pointed out in the words—‘As *regards the eternal thing*, *etc. etc*.’—It is only what is produced that needs something else as its Cause; what is eternal, however, can never be produced; what need can that have of it?—(2926)
