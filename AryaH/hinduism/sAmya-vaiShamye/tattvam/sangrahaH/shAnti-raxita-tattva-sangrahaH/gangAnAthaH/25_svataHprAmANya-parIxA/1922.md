## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2897 that—“The fact that other Means of Cognition never have any bearing upon what is said in the Veda establishes its validity; otherwise, it would be merely reiterative The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3073 above*]

Confirmatory Cognition of effective action, and the Cognition of perfection of the cause,—supply the source of the certainty regarding Validity; and both these are not admitted (by the other party) in the case of the Veda; consequently there are no means of ascertaining the validity of Cognitions provided by the Veda; hence there can be no certainty regarding such validity; as the effect cannot appear without its cause.—(3073)
