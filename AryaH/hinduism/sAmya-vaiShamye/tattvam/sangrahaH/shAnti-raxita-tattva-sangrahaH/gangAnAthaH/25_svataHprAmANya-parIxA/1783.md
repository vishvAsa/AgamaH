> The whole idea of the ‘manifestation’ of the eternal thing and its being dependent upon other contributory causes has been rejected already; hence the effects producible by the pramāṇas by themselves should be apprehended at all times.—(2824)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Manifestation*—*and*—*dependence upon other causes*’.—Under the chapter on the ‘Revealed Word’, the idea of ‘manifestation’ of the eternal thing has been refuted in detail; and it has also been explained that the thing that cannot be helped cannot be dependent upon other causes.

‘*The effects producible*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Tat*’ stands for the *Pramāṇas*; the effects of these by themselves, etc. etc.

The view that “the Potency may be both (different and non-dîfferent)” cannot be right, because they are mutually contradictory and also because it would be open to all the objections that have been urged against *Difference* as also those urged against *Non-difference*.

Nor can the view that “it is neither different nor non-different” be accepted. Because between two mutually exclusive things, the affirmation of one is inseparable from the denial of the other; hence it can never be right to deny it at the very time that it is affirmed; as the affirmation and denial of the same thing involves an incongruity. This objection is quite clear; hence it has not been stated in the Text.—(2824)
