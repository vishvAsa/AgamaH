## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* shows the presence of the Probans in the ‘subject’ and thereby sets aside the defect of ‘Inadmissibility’ from the Reason:—[*see verse 2941 above*]

‘*Yat*’—Because.

‘*Gatam*’—found.

*Question*;—“What has been so found?”

*Answer*;—*Validity*.

For example, it has been already shown that the cognition produced by the Veda is subject to Doubt and Misconception (i.e. it is found to be doubtful and wrong),

‘*Tathā*,’—as in the case of the Post, the certainty is obtained only extraneously.

‘*Tasya*, *etc*.’—This sets forth the conclusion resulting from the Reasoning.—(2941)
