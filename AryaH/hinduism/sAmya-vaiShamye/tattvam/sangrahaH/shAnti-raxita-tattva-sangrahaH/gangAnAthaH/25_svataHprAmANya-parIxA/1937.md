## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2908, that “If the validity of the Cognition that proves the validity of another Cognition be not proved by any other Cognition,—then the same might be the case with those whose validity is held to be proved by others”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3094 above*]

In some cases, it so happens that there being no means, in the shape of repeated Cognition, of securing certainty, some sort of illusion or mistake comes in; hence the validity cannot rest in the Cognition itself.—(3094)
