> In the case of the validity of other cognitions also, such corroboration is always regarded as the ground (for validity); hence certainty must be based upon that corroboration.—(3074)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2898 that—“such corroboration does not form the basis of the validity of other Cognitions also, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3074 above*]

‘*Such corroboration*’,—in the shape of conformity with reality, and Cognition of perfection.

The objection that this involves Infinite Regress has already been refuted. Hence there is no truth (conclusiveness) in the premiss that “what is valid does not need the corroboration of another Cognition”, Because for the purposes of certainty, such corroboration is always needed.—(3074)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verse 3075 next*]
