> “If there is a wrong perception due to the thing concerned being at a distant place, there would, in some cases, be a suspicion of its really being something else; and the limit of this possibility would extend only till the man has approached near the thing; and in such a case, there is no expectation of any sublation regarding time, man and circumstances; as for example, in the case of the cognition of the mirage, etc.”—(2877-2878)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* proceed to point out that of these diversities of Place, Time, etc.—only some are sublaters of a certain Cognition,—not all of all Cognitions; hence all should not be suspected in regard to all Cognitions:—[*see verses 2877-2878 above*]

‘*Suspicion, etc*.’—of the thing being *Water*;—‘*in some cases*,’—in the case of such things as the Mirage.

‘*Till the man has approached, etc. etc*.’—This has to be construed with ‘*limit of the possibility of sublation*’.

What is meant is as follows:—In a case where remoteness of the place is the only likely cause of misconception,—all that is necessary is to move upto the thing, for the purpose of finding out whether there is, or not, a sublating cognition; and in such a case, the sublation should not be expected or sought for, in regard to Time and the other factors; because these latter could not be the source of misconception.

An instance is cited—‘*As for example, etc. etc*.’—‘*Cognition of the Mirage*’—i.e. the cognition, in regard to the Mirage, that it is *Water*.

‘*Etcetera*’—includes such notions as that of ‘largeness’, in regard to what is *small*, and the notion of ‘smallness’ in regard to what is *large*,—this being due to distance;—and other similar notions. In these cases, there can be no need for investigation of Time and other factors.

Similarly in regard to misconceptions due to Time, etc.—whenever there is possibility of a certain factor being the source of error, the enquiry should proceed in regard to that factor only; and not in regard to any other factor.—This is what is meant to be shown by means of the example cited.—(2877-2878)

The same idea is expressed in regard to particular points of *Time*:—[*see verse 2879 next*]
