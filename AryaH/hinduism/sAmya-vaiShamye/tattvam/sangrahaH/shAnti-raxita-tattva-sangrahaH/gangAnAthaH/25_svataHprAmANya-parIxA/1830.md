> “As a matter of fact, the validity of verbal and other cognitions is not to be proved by means of inference. otherwise the validity of sense-perception also might have to be proved by inference (which is absurd).”—(2906)



## Kamalaśīla

The cognition produced by the *Veda* cannot have its validity confirmed by Sense-perception, because what is said in the Veda is beyond the reach of the senses.—Nor can it be proved or confirmed by Inference; as that would lead to incongruities.

‘*Śabdānām*’;—this includes the cognitions produced by the Veda.

Or, particular details may be learnt from the Context.—(2906)
