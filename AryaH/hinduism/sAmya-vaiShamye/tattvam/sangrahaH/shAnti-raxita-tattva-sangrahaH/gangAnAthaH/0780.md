> As before, the instrumental ending may signify either the cause or the instrument. or it may signify that it is ‘in that form’.—If the thing were not differentiated from unlike things, then it could not be so.—(1074)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text* the author applies the Instrumental ending in the compound ‘*arthāntaraparāvṛttyā*’ in the case in question:—[*see verse 1074 above*]

‘*As before*’;—i.e. just as under Texts 1068-1070,—where it is said that ‘the Word expresses things as qualified by the exclusion of other things’,—so the same may be applied here also.—Or in all cases, the Instrumental Ending may be taken as signifying the idea of being ‘in that form’;—tills is what is mentioned by the words ‘*tena vātmanā*’.

*Question*:—“The *exclusion of other things* is a property belonging to the *Object*; as such, how can it be either the *Cause* or the *Instrument* of the apprehension of the Reflection?”

*Answer*:—‘*If the thing, etc. etc*.’—That is, if the Thing were not excluded (and differentiated) from unlike things, then, in the form of its Reflection, it could not be apprehended as something excluded from unlikengs. That is why the *exclusion from other things* is to be regarded as the Cause and the Instrument.—(1074)
