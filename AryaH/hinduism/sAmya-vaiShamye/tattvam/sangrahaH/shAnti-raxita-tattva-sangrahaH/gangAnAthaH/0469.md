> If the composite essentially related to one component subsisted in some other component occupying a place other than that of the said component,—then it would mean that the two components occupy the same place and are essentially one and the same, because they are not differentiated if, on the other hand, the composite subsisted in the other component in another form,—then as occupying two places, the composite could not be one; specially as difference in form (and character) must constitute difference in the thing itself.—(610-611)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the composite substance, which has its form and character connected with one Component, subsisted in another Component which occupies another point in space,—then the components in question would have to be regarded as occupying the same point in space; which would mean that they are essentially one and the same, being of the same nature.

“Why so?”

*Because they are not differentiated*;—because they exist without being differentiated from one another.—Otherwise,—if they existed in their differentiated forms,—they could not occupy the same point in space.

If the second alternative is accepted,—i.e. the Composite subsists in the second component in a different form,—then it means that *one* thing subsists in several components,—which would be inadmissible; because, as a matter of fact, when oneng differs from another in its nature, it must be different from this latter; as difference in things is always of the nature of difference in their character (and form).—(610-611)
