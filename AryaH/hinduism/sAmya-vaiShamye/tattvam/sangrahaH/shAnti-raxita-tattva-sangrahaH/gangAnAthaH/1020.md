> Inasmuch as it has been proved that ‘perpetual flux’ is all-embracing, there can be no inference of what has gone before,—by itself.—If it be argued that “the sameness is assumed on the basis of the sameness of the chain”—Then (the answer is that) no such sameness can have any real existence; and what is merely assumed cannot be an entity.—(1447-1448)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*All-embracing*’,—i.e. embracing all such, things as Fire, Smoke and the rest.

It might be argued that—“Even though the individual things are momentary, there would be sameness (unity) of the *chain* or *series*.”

The answer to that is—‘*No such sameness*, *etc*.’—That is, this *sameness* would be something *assumed*, not *real*; so that in *reality*, there would be no continuity of existence for anything; under the circumstances, it cannot be right to say ‘by the observer remaining at that place’, or ‘by that same means’ and so forth.—What too is merely *assumed* cannot be an *entity or thing*; hence there would be no sense in the words ‘*because it is a cognition of a thing whose existence was doubted*’ (as used in *Text* 1445, by *Kumārila*).—(1447-1448)
