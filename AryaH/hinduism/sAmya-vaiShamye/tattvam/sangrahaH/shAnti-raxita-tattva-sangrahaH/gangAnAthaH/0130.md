> All consciousness must be consecutive, as it must follow the order of sequence of the objects cognised; if it were not so, its effect in the form of cognition would come about simultaneously.—hence even in the effect in the form of ‘cognition’, there is nothing, apart from the rejecting and acquiring, which could be within the powers of brahman; so that it becomes reduced to the position of the ‘son of the barren woman’.—(149-150)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, you must understand that *Brahman* is not capable of bringing about even mere Cognition; and being so incapable, Its form turns out to be that of mere non-entity. A further elucidation of this is supplied in the following Text:—[*see verses 149-150 above*]

All this has been proved under the section dealing with ‘God’ (in Text 89).

‘*Tataḥ param*’, ‘*apart from that*’;—i.e. other than the Blue and other things which form the basis of the acts of *rejecting* and *acquiring*.—Or the term ‘*tataḥ*’ may be taken as the re-assertion of the Conclusion; the meaning being that ‘it is something apart from the Blue and other things which form the basis of the acts of *Rejecting* and *Acquiring*’,—Or the term ‘*tataḥ*’ may be taken as the re-assertion of the Conclusion, in the form ‘therefore it is true, real’.

*The position of the* ‘*Son of the Barren Woman*’;—for regarding the ‘Son of the Barren Woman’ as a non-entity, there is no reason apart from the fact of his being incapable of effective action.—(149-150)
