## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted (under *Text* 656 above) that—“as Conjunction has a particular characteristic it is regarded as distinct”.—This is answered in the following—[*see verse 666 above*]

As a matter of fact, what falls within the range of the perceiver’s vision is not any distinct thing in the shape of *Conjunction*, by noticing which he brings up the ‘Conjoined things’; what happens is that he notices that the two things, which were previously in the condition in which there was an interval of space between them, have subsequently come into the condition in which they have come into juxtaposition,—these things come to be spoken of as ‘conjoined things’; as it has been already proved that the term ‘Conjunction’ connotes only a particular *condition* of things. So that whenever one finds two things in this particular *condition* in which they become expressible by the term ‘conjoined things’, one brings these, and none others. No intelligent person ever acts on the strength of words, in regard to what is not expressed by those words.—(666)

It has been argued (under *Text* 658, above) that—“To what would such distinct notions be due as ‘this thing is attached to it—this is detached from it’?”

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 667 next*]
