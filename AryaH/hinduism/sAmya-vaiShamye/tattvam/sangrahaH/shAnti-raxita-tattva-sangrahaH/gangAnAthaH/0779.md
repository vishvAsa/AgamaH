> It is spoken of as a portion of the object, because it proceeds on the basis of the perception of the object as ‘excluded from other things’, and because it is superimposed upon the object.—(1073)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Because it comes about through the perception of the object ‘excluded from other things’,—and because it is superimposed upon *it*—i.e. upon the Object excluded from other things—by deluded persons,—therefore that same Reflection is figuratively spoken of as ‘part of the object’,—(1073)
