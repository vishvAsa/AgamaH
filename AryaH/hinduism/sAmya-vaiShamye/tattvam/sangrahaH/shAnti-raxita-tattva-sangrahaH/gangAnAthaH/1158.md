> It is the form (aspect) of the thing itself that is held to be ‘differentiated’; it is in that same form that it exists, and it is in this form that it is perceived.—(1674)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Our Reason would have been ‘inadmissible’ if one and the same thing had both (positive and negative) characters; as a matter of fact however the presence of two characters in the same object is incongruous.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1674 above*]

When the thing is ‘differentiated’ from another thing, it is not in any other form; in fact it is differentiated *in its own form*; hence it is the *form of the thing itself* which is apprehended as differentiated from the other thing; as it remains in its own form. That form in which it is differentiated,—in that form, the Thing is always *existent*, never *non-existent*. This thing is perceived in the form in which it is differentiated from other things; so that there is no apprehension of any second form or aspect of that thing.—(1674)
