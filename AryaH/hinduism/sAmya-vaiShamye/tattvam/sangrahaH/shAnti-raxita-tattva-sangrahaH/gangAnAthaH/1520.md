> Even if there be no defects, truthfulness does not become proved simply because the other alternative must be accepted; because there is a third alternative possible, that of ‘meaninglessness’.—(2358)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, it may be that in the Veda, there is absence, only of the defects conducive to *falsity*, not of the excellences; even so, the ‘inconclusiveness’ of your Probans is irresistible. This is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2358 above*]

If, in connection with Words, there were only two possible alternatives—*falsity* and *truthfulness*,—then, the absence of one alternative would necessarily imply the presence of the other; there is however a third alternative possible—that they are *meaningless*; under the circumstances, the negation of *falsity* does not necessarily imply the assertion of *truthfulness*; as there is no negation of the other alternative of *meaninglessness*.—(2358)
