> Due to the said and other distinctions, ‘exclusions’ are postulated on the basis of differentiated things; and so also are the words as applied to those things. thus words, as denoting distinct things in accordance with convention, are applied with due differentiation; and as such they are not synonymous under our view.—(1043-1044)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus explained that, even in the absence of any positive entity in the shape of a Commonalty, Words are applied with distinction merely on the basis of *exclusion*, the Author proceeds to show that there is no possibility of the incongruity of all words becoming synonymous:—[*see verses 1043-1044 above*]

The term ‘*other*’—includes words expressive of different ages—such as ‘child’ and the like,—and also such words as ‘*nairātmya*’, (‘absence of soul’, or ‘featurelessness’).

‘*On the basis of differentiated things*’;—i.e. exclusions, of which the basis consists in things differentiated from one another.

‘*So*’—associated with ‘exclusion’,

‘*Applied to those things*’;—i.e. applied to the ‘excluded’ (i.e. differentiated) things.—Because, indirectly, they are the cause of the apprehension of the said denotation of the word.

‘*śrutayaḥ*’—Words.—(1043-1044)
