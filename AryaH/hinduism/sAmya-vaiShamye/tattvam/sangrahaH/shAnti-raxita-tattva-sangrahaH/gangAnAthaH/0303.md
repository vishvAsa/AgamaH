> The mere naming of a person as ‘donkey’ does not lead to the attribution of the whole character of the ass to that person.—(380)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“In such expressions as ‘It is Caitra’s Son’, it is the *existence* of the son that is affirmed; so in the expression ‘There is Annihilation of the thing’, it must be the *presence* of the Annihilation that is affirmed.”

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 380 above*]

The *existence* and *non-existence* of things are not dependent upon the use of mere words, as the using of words depends upon the whim of the speaker; if it were not so, then if, through a whim, the name ‘Donkey’ were given to a man, the entire character of the Ass would have to be attributed to that man.

The term ‘*bāleya*’ (in the Text) is a synonym for ‘*rāsabha*’ (Ass).—(380)
