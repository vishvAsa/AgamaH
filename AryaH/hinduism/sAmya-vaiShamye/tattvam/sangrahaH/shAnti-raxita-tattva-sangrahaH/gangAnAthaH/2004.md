> “His knowledge consists only in the direct perception of his pure self; when the source of that knowledge is not pure, the knowledge itself is called ‘ignorance’.”—(3207)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—How is it that, though knowing only a part of things, *Śaṅkara* alone—and no one else—is spoken of as ‘equipped with knowledge’?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3207 above*]

‘*Pure*’ qualifies the ‘*Self*’;—the perception of this.

‘*Its basis*’—the basis of the perception of the pure self.—What is that *basis*?—The Self itself.—When this Self is *not-pure*, then the ‘perception of the Self’ that appears is called ‘no knowledge’, ‘Ignorance’; because it is of a low order.—(3207)
