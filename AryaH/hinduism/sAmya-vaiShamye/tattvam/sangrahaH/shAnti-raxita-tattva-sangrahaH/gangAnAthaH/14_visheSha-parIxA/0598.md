> “Just as the unclean character belongs to the dog’s flesh by itself, and to other things by contact with it,—so in the case in question also—and just as between the jar and the lamp, the lamp, by itself, is always the illuminator of the jar, because it is of the nature of light,—so also in the case in question.”—(817-818)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* anticipate the answer to the above given by *Praśastamati*—[*see verses 817-818 above*]

*Praśastamati* has argued as follows:—“The Dog’s flesh is unclean by its very nature, and other things become unclean by coming into contact with it; in the same manner, the ‘Ultimate Individualities’ by themselves are the basis of exclusive notion—on account of their being of the nature of exclusion,—while Atoms and other things become such basis only through the presence in these of the said Individuality.—Then again, even if a thing may not be of a certain nature, yet its notion may come about through the presence of something else; e.g. the cognition of the Jar is brought about by the Lamp; while the cognition of the Lamp is not brought about by the Jar.—‘*Ayam*’ stands for the *Jar*.—‘*So also in the case in question*’;—that is, the apprehension of distinction among Atoms, etc. is due to the presence of the Ultimate Individualities; while that of the Individualities themselves is due to their very nature.”

This is answered in the following—[*see verses 819-822 next*]
