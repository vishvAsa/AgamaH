> For instance, the *pudgala* is said to be ‘incapable of being spoken of’ as different or non-different from feeling and the rest, while colour, name and other things are said to be ‘capable of being spoken of’ as different from them.—(345)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That is to say, the *Pudgala* is said to be ‘*incapable* of being spoken of’ as different or non-different from Feeling, Name and the rest; while Colour, Name, and the rest are spoken of as quite ‘*capable* of being spoken of’ as *different* from each other; so that our Reason is not ‘unproven’,—(345)
