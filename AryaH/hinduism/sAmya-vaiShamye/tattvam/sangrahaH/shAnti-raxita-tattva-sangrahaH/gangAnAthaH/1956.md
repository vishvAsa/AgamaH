## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* Opponent:—“All that is cognisable is included under the five things. Colour (Taste, Odour, Touch and Speech); and men who know all these are well known; hence the *Mīmāṃsakà’s* Proposition—that ‘there is no one who knows all things—is contrary to ordinary experience”.

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3128 above*]

“In the present context, which deals with the question of the Reliability of the Veda, all that is meant by us is the denial of the existence of any person who knows all things relating to *Dharma*,—not the denial of the person knowing all things that are included under the denotation of the term ‘all Thus if people apply the term ‘omniscient’ (*all-knowing*) to a certain person, in the sense that he knows all things *except Dharma and Adhdrma*,—we do not deny this; hence our Proposition does not run counter to ordinary experience”.—(3128)
