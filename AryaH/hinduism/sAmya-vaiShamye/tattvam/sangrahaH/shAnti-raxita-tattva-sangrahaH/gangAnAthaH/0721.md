> “Is this Apoha one and the same in connection with all things? or is it several?—If one, then, being related to several cows, it would be the same as the universal—‘cow’—if it is several, then it would be endless,—like so many individual objects. consequently, just like the diverse individuals, this also could not be ‘denoted’.—(995-996)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*Uddyotakara* continues]—“You should explain whether this *Apoha* is one and the same in regard to allngs? Or is it different with each individual thing? If it is one and the same, and is related to several cows, then it is the same as the *Universal* ‘Cow’. If on the other hand, it is many (differing with each individual cow), then it is as endless as the individual objects themselves; so that no conception of it would be possible; which means that it cannot be denoted—(995-996)
