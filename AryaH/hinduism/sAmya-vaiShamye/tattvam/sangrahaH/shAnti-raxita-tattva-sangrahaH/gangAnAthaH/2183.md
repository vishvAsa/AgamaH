> A very long time has elapsed and women are very unsteady; hence it cannot be certain if there is Brāhmaṇa-hood in you. For you, there is no one who is cognisant of supersensuous things; nor has even the Veda declared the purity of your genealogy.—(3579-3580)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Because, as a rule..... You do not admit that there is any man capable of perceiving supersensuous things,—through whom certainty on this point could be obtained.
