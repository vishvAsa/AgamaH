> The order of sequence in the ‘manifestation’ cannot constitute the sentence, because it has been shown that there can be no ‘manifestation’ of what is eternal.—For this reason the eternality of the sentence cannot be due to its being related to the universal ‘sentence—(2767)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be argued that—“the Sentence shall consist in the order of sequence in the manifestation (and appearance of the Letters)

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 2767 above*]

The particle ‘*ca*’ implies that the *Sentence* cannot consist of the *Sphoṭa* as something different from the Letters;—the idea being that that idea has been rejected by the *Mīmāṃsakas* themselves.

‘*Nitye vyakti*, *etc. etc*.’—That is, it having been shown that there can be no ‘manifestation’ of what is eternal.—(2767)
