> The auditory organ and the letter-sounds that have been previously embellished by the manifesters cannot become destroyed,—because if they did, they would be non-eternal; and consequently they would be heard at all times.—(2573)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Cyutiprāpteḥ*’—because of liability to become non-eternal. Otherwise, there would be Renunciation of Proposition (on your part).

‘*Sarva-śrutiḥ*’—Hearing *at all times*.—not *of* all; as in the latter case, the compound would fall under the prohibition contained in Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* ‘*Karmaṇi ca*’.—(2573)
