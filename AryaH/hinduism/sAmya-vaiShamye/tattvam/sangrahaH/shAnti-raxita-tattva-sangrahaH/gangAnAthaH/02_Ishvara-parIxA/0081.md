> When you have seen that a certain thing exists only when certain other things exist, and never when these do not exist,—then, if you assume a cause for the former, other than these latter,—how can you avoid falling into an infinite regress?—(90)



## Kamalaśīla

Further, even in the absence of Causes with perceptible efficiency, you postulate the causal character of God, whose efficiency is never perceived;—and this lands you in absurdities; because even after having assumed such a God, you might as well assume even such (absurd) things as the *Ḍheṭkaṣaka* and the like (?), as there would be no difference between such things and God.—This is what is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 90 above*]

A ‘*yat*’ has to be added after ‘*bhavaddṛṣṭam*’, ‘seen by you’. *If you assume a Cause other than these*;—i.e. a Cause other than those whose efficiency has been perceived (by the positive and negative concomitance spoken of).—(90)
