> Visual cognition and tactile cognition always appear differently; they cannot therefore have one and the same substratum,—just like the cognition of odour and other things.—(58)



## Kamalaśīla

It has thus been shown that the Probans is essentially ‘unproven and Inadmissible’, on the ground of the *qualification* and the *qualified* being ‘unknown’; the following Text proceeds to show that it is ‘unproven’ also on the ground of the *unproven (unknown*) character of part of its *substratum*:—[*see verse 58 above*]

In the argument (put forward by the *Naiyāyika*, under verse 48, above) two kinds of things have been mentioned as the ‘Subject’—‘what is perceptible by two Sense-organs’ and ‘what is imperceptible’.—Now as a matter of fact, there is no object that is *known* (accepted by all parties) to be ‘perceptible by two Sense-organs’; for instance, both *Visual Cognition* and *Tactile Cognition*, are known to appear in different forms, respectively as *manifesting the Blue and other Colours* and as *manifesting Hardness*, *Softness*, *etc. of the things touched*; thus both these cognitions cannot have the same objective,—because they appear as different,—like the Cognitions of Odour, Taste and other things. The argument may be formulated thus:—Any two cognitions appearing in different forms cannot have the same objective,—like the Cognitions of Odour and Taste,—the Visual and Tactile Cognitions do appear in different forms;—hence the attributing of both to a single object would be a direct contravention of the said universal proposition.—If, even when appearing in different forms, Cognitions were to have the same objective, then the Cognitions of Colour, Sound and such diverse things also might be regarded as having the same objective; this is the reason that annuls the argument of the *Naiyāyika*.—(58)
