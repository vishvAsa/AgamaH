## Kamalaśīla

There is yet another series of arguments set forth by these persons:—

\(A\) “*That which is the substratum of the variegated and the mobile*, and *that which is not the substratum of these*—which is the thing under dispute,—is cognised through a means of cognition other than the five beginning with the *second*,—just as Colour, etc. are cognised as distinguished from the character of ‘being an entity’ and so forth,—the ‘Hair of the Tortoise’ (a non-entity) being the corroborative instance *per dissimilarity*”.

In the argument as thus worded, the term, ‘*vicitrodaya*’ stands for the category of *Quality*, in the sense that its ‘*udaya*’, *appearance*, is ‘*vicitra*’ *variegated*; the term ‘*prasyanda*’ stands for the category of *Mobility*;—the ‘*āspada*’, *substratum*, of these two is the category of *Substance*;—*that which is not the substratum* of these two (Quality and Mobility) stands for the five categories of *Quality*, *Action*, *Universal*, *Particular* and *Inherence*;—such a thing is cognised through *a Means of Cognition other than the five beginning loith the second*,—i.e. other than Inference, Analogy, Word, Presumption and Non-apprehension; i.e. through *Sense-per caption*. The rest is easily intelligible.

\(B\) The other argument propounded by them is in the following form:—“The Thing under dispute,—which is (1) what is embraced by the *Particulars* of such *Universals* as ‘Being’ and the like, and also (2) what is not so embraced,—is perceptible to some one,—because they exist,—like Colour and the rest”.—In this statement, the term ‘*Being and the like*’ stands for the six non-specific (general) entities,—‘Being’, ‘Evanescent’, ‘Material Product’, ‘Cause’, ‘Universal’, ‘Particular’;—the ‘*particulars*’ of these go to *specify* Substance, Quality and Action;—hence what is ‘embraced’ by these particulars are these three categories of Substance Quality and Action;—‘*what is not so embraced*’ consists of the *Universal* and the rest. The rest is easily intelligible.—[And the Person who has the perception of all thesengs is God.]

This series of arguments is set forth in the following Text:—[*see verse 55 above*]
