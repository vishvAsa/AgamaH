> The mere character of ‘being denoted by the term go’ (as a general character) might prove the ‘presence of horns’ in the quarters and other things (which are all denoted by the term ‘go’),—ip the reasoning were not adopted in a different form.—(70)



## Kamalaśīla

If a general character could bring about the cognition of a thing even without being invariably concomitant with it, then absurdity could result;—this is what is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 70 above*]

As a matter of fact, *Heaven*, *Quarters*, *Speech, Eyes*, *Bays*, *Thunderbolt*, *Earth* and *Water*,—all these things are ‘denoted by the term *Go*’; if, on the basis of this general character of ‘being denoted by the term *Go*’, it were sought to be proved that a particular Cow of variegated colour has horns,—then on the basis of the same character, it would be possible to infer *the presence of Horns* in *Heaven*, etc. also.—(70)
