> If what you seek to prove is the fact that the world is created by a cause who is one and whose consciousness is eternal,—then there is absence of the probandum (in the instance); and it is ‘inconclusive’ also, since such things as the house and the like are found to be made by several makers.—(81)



## Kamalaśīla

If (in order to avoid this) it be held that “the proposition sought to be proved is in a *particular* (not the General) form”,—then the answer is as given in the following Text:—[*see verse 81 above*]

Though this has been already explained under Text 73 above, yet it is asserted again with a view to clinching the argument.—The compound ‘*Nityaikabuddhipūrvatvam*’ may be taken to mean either ‘produced by one who is eternal and has a single Consciousness’, or ‘produced by one whose Consciousness is eternal and one’,—*Absence of the Probandum*;—i.e. in what has been cited as the Corroborative Instance *per similarity*;—also ‘*inconclusiveness*’,—i.e. *of the Probans*—(this has to be supplied).—“How?”—The answer is—*Since such things as the Home*, *etc. etc*.—(81)
