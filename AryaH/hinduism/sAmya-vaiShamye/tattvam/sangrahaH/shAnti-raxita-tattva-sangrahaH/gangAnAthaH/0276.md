> The ‘colour-phase’ and the rest are held to be ‘capable of being spoken of’ as ‘non-eternal’; while the *pudgala* is not so; so that there is a clear difference between the two.—(346)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text shows another reason why the presence of contradictory properties in the two (*Pudgala* and *Colour*, *etc*.) must he admitted:—[*see verse 346 above*]

The assertion that ‘all impressions are non-eternal’ shows that *Colour and the rest* are quite ‘capable of being spoken of’ as ‘non-eternal while the *Pudgala* is not held to be so ‘capable of being spoken of’ as ‘non-eternal on the ground that it is entirely ‘incapable of being spoken of’ (as anything at all).

Nor is our Reason ‘inconclusive because all idea of ‘difference’ is based upon the said fact (of the presence of contradictory properties); if it were not so, then the whole Universe would be a single Entity; which would mean the possibility of all things being produced and destroyed simultaneously.—(346)
