> As for the ‘glance of the dancing girl’, it is not really a single entity; in fact it is made up of several minute particles; and its ‘one-ness’ is only assumed.—(200)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text proceeds to show that the Corroborative Instance also is ‘devoid of the Probandum’—[*see verse 200 above*]

Such things as the ‘glance of the Dancing Girl’ are not single entities; they are, in reality, an aggregate of several minute particles.

*Question*—“If that is so, then how do they come to be spoken of as *one*?”

*Answer—Its one-ness is only assumed*.—(200)
