> As regards ‘annihilation’, as it can have no essence (character), it cannot ‘come into existence immediately after the thing’;—and as regards the presence of the character of ‘coming into existence after having not existed before’, this is precisely like the ‘sky-lotus’ and other things.—(378)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Such characters as ‘coming into existence immediately after theng,’ and the like can exist in *things* only, never in a *non-entity*, like the ‘Hare’s Horns’; and ‘Annihilation’ has no ‘essence’, no character;—how then can it have any such character as ‘coming immediately after theng’ and the like?

*As regards the presence of the character of ‘coming into existence*, *having been not in existence before*’; the particle ‘*ca*’ includes the character of *being occasional*.—(378)

“If that is so, if *Annihilation* has not the character of *coming into existence immediately after the thing*, then what can be the meaning of the assertion that ‘there is Annihilation of the thing’? When something does not belong to a thing, it can never be attributed to it.”

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 379 next*]
