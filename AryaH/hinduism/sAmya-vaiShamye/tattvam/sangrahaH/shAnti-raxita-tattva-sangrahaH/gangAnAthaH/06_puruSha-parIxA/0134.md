> Others, however, postulate the ‘*puruṣa*’ (spirit),—similar in character to ‘god’—as the cause of the world,—their mind being swayed by an ill-conceived doctrine. thus ‘spirit’ has his powers such as do not cease even in regard to the dissolution of all things; he is the cause of all born things, just as the spider is of the cobwebs.—(154)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following Text, the Author introduces the doctrine of the ‘*Vedavādin*’ (Follower of the Veda):—[*see verses 153-154 above*]

These people state their doctrine as follows:—“The *Puruṣa*, *Spirit*, alone is the Cause of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the whole world; *his powers do not cease even in regard to Dissolution*. This has been thus declared—‘As the Spider is the cause of the cobwebs, the Lunar Gem of water, and the Banyan Tree of its offshoots,—so is the Spirit the Cause of all born things’;—and again ‘The Spirit alone is all this, the past, and also the future’,”

*Similar in character to God*;—i.e. He has qualities equal to those of God; inasmuch as both are the ‘efficient cause’ of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the universe; the only difference between these two (*Spirit* and *God*) is that those who regard *God* as the Cause of the World postulate other things also like the Soul and such things, as the ‘constituent’ and other kinds of Cause (God being only the ‘efficient’ cause),—while those who regard ‘Spirit’ as the Cause of the world, posit the *Spirit* alone as the sole cause (*efficient* as well as *constituent*); but the character of being the *efficient* cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution is common to both doctrines.—*They have their mind swayed by an ill-conceived doctrine*; i.e. their mind is under the influence of a doctrine which is wrongly conceived.

The term ‘*Ūrṇanābha*’ stands for the *Spider*.—(153-154)
