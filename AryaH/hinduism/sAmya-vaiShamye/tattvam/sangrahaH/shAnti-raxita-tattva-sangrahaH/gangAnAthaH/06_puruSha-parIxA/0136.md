> If he does it because he is prompted by another being, then he can not be self-sufficient (independent).—if he does it through compassion, then he should make the world absolutely happy. when he is found to have created people beset with misery, poverty, sorrow and other troubles,—where can his compassion be perceived?—(156-157)



## Kamalaśīla

If the Spirit does all this, even though himself unwilling to do so, because he is prompted by another Being in the shape of God and the like,—then the ‘self-sufficiency’ that has been postulated for him disappears.—If it were through compassion that he did it, for the purpose of helping others, then he would not make it full of such dire miseries as those of Hell, etc.,—he would make it entirely happy.—(156-157)
