> The reputation of this also is to be set forth, in the same manner as that of ‘god’: for what purpose does this ‘spirit’ perform such an act (as the creating, etc. of the world)?—(155)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following Text, the Author proceeds to set forth the objections against this doctrine:—[*see verse 155 above*]

‘*Īśvaravat*’—is to be construed as ‘*Īśvarasya iva*’, ‘as in the case of God’, This refutation is to be stated thus ‘The *Spirit* cannot be the Cause of born things,—because He is Himself devoid of birth,—like the sky-lotus; otherwise all things would come into existence simultaneously’,—[This is exactly the same argument that has been put forward against ‘God’, under *Text* 87, above].

If the upholders of the *Spirit* put forward the same arguments that have been put forward by others in proof of ‘God’,—then the same fallacies—of being ‘unproven’ and the rest—that have been shown in the latter should be applied to the former also.

The Text mentions another line of objection also—*For what purpose*, *etc*.—The activity of all intelligent beings is found to be prompted by some purpose; hence it has to be explained for what purpose the Spirit performs such an act as that of creating the world.—(155)
