> If it be held that “the functioning at the beginning of creation is due to his nature,—just like the functioning of fire and such things towards burning and such effects, which is due to their very nature”;—then, under the circumstances, all things should come into existence simultaneously; because of the presence of the cause fully competent to produce them.—(164-165)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author now proceeds to examine *Uddyotakara’s* view that the functioning of God is due to His own nature:—[*see verses 164-165 above*]

*Uddyotakam* argues as follows:—“The action of God cannot be for purposes of amusement; on the other hand, just as in the case of Earth and other Rudimentary Elements, their very nature is such that they operate towards the bringing about of their products, so also in the case of God”.—[This is a clear reference to what is said in the *Nyāyavārtika*, pages 466-467; though the words are slightly different].

This is not right; as the appearance of all things being entirely dependent upon the action of that Being,—when the Cause in its fully efficient and perfect form would he present, all things would be produced simultaneously. It will not be right to introduce the qualification of “intelligence” (in the Cause),—as we have already explained (under the section on *God*).—(164-165)
