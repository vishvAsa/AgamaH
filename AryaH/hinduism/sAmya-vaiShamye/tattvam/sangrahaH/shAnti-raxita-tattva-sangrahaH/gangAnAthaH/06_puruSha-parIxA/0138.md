> Nor should he ever bring about the dissolution op those beings who would be always prosperous. if in so doing, he be regarded as dependent upon the ‘unseen force’ (op destiny), then his ‘self-sufficiency’ ceases.—(159)



## Kamalaśīla

If he created people through compassion, and they were always happy,—then why should he bring about their dissolution? The sense is that if he has to bring about Dissolution, he should bring about the Dissolution of only such Beings as are miserable and imbecile.—It might be urged that—“He makes people happy or unhappy in accordance with their *Destiny*, in the shape of Merit and Demerit—That cannot be right; as in that case his ‘self-sufficiency’—which has been postulated,—*would cease*. One who is himself endowed with power does not depend upon anything else; if one is wanting in power, then the creation of the world itself might be attributed to That on which he is dependent; and in that case He would cease to be the ‘Cause’.—(159)
