> ‘Śauri’ (Viṣṇu), ‘the Self-Born’ (Brahmā), and others who have been assumed to be the creators (of the world)—all become actually rejected by the above reasonings.—(170)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

This objection against the ‘Spirit’ should be taken as rejecting all those ‘creators’—*Śauri* and the rest,—who have been postulated by other people.—

This is what is shown in the following Text:—[*see verse 170 above*]

‘*Śauri*’ is *Viṣṇu*; ‘*Self-born*’ is *Brahmā*;—‘and others’ is meant to include ‘Intelligent Time’, which also is postulated by some people.

[*There is a lacuna in the Text here*.]

*End of the Chapter on ‘Spirit’ as the Creator*.
