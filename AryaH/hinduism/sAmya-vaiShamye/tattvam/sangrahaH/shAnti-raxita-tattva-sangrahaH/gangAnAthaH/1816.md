> “In transactions relating to debt and other heads, when there is a dispute between two disputants, there is one statement by the dependant and two by the plaintiff; and it is for avoiding an infinite regress that no further statements are recorded;—and it is on the basis of the said three statements alone that the master (judge), the witnesses and the assessors should come to a decision.—Thus, in all cases, there is a following up of three cognitions only; and it is for this same reason that the deities are called ‘*trisatya*’ (three-truth).—Thus then, if the validity of cognitions is inherent in them, there is no infinite regress; and the validity and invalidity remain as they happen to be in reality.”—(2882-2885)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* proceed to show that even in ordinary business-transactions, the conclusions of the Enquirer (Judge) require only *three* statements:—[*see verses 2882-2885 above*]

“Then again, if it be proved that the validity of Sense-perception and other *Pramāṇas* is due to extraneous causes,—the same is not the case with Verbal Cognition,—even so our position becomes established. Because the whole of this effort of ours is meant for the purpose of establishing the reliability of the Vedic Injunction; so that when it is proved that the validity of the Verbal Cognition is inherent, self-sufficient,—the reliability of the Vedic Injunction becomes automatically established;—what need there is then for our trying to prove the self-sufficient validity of the other forms *of* Cognition?”

With the above idea in his mind, the *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to prove the self-sufficient validity of Verbal Cognition:—[*see verses 2886-2888 next*]
