> If the word-sound did not possess the capacity to produce cognitions, then it could never be cognised by anyone anywhere; as it could not have any bearing upon its cognition.—If, on the other hand, it did possess the capacity, then it would be cognised by all men, at all times and at all places; as it would continue to be the cause of that cognition.—(2563-2564)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

By its very nature, the Word-Sound should be either *incapable* or *capable* of producing its cognition. These are the only two alternatives possible.—In the former case—i.e. if it is incapable—the Word-Sound would never be cognised by any one. In the latter case, it would be cognised by all men at all times; because it would always be of the same form.

From this it follows that the Embellishment can have no capacity at all.—(2563-2564)
