## Kamalaśīla

[In the Introductory Text, 4.] the *Truth* has been spoken of as ‘without beginning, without end’.—The Author proceeds to set forth arguments in support of this view, starting with the criticism that has been urged against it:—[*see verse 1857 above*]

‘*No* *entity*’—like the Soul, etc.—The ‘Soul’ has been already rejected; hence it cannot be ‘continuous’, simply because it does not exist at ail; as for the Cognition and other entities, they are all momentary, and it has been proved in the Chapter on ‘The Three Points of Time’ that there can be no continuity of these.—(1857)
