> As regards this matter, there are some wise persons who describe the Jinas (Buddhas) as ‘beings’ whose ‘*nirvāṇa*’ is not ‘absolute and final’,—and the two paths as aiming at that same path.—For these people the instance cited cannot be admitted to be endowed with the probandum;—even though it has been cited (by the materialist) on the basis of the doctrine of the other disputant.—(1917-1918)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even though the statement may be made on the basis of the Buddhist doctrine, yet there are some Buddhists who cannot admit the Corroborative Instance (of the *Arhats*) to be endowed with the Probandum (*not bringing about further consciousness*).—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verses 1917-1918 above*]

‘*This matter*’,—the doctrine of the Buddhists.

‘*Some wise persons*’,—the *Mahāyānist-Mādhyamikas*.

These people have declared that the ‘*Nirvāṇa*’ of the *Buddhas* consists in *the absence of absolute finality*; on the ground that both ‘Birth-Cycle’ and ‘cessation of conscious existence’ are neither final nor absolute for them.—As regards the *Neo-phyte* and the Prospective *Buddha*, these also have the same ‘path of the *Buddha*’ as their goal; as is clear from such statements as—‘There is only one Path, that of the *Mahāyāna*’,—(1917-1918)
