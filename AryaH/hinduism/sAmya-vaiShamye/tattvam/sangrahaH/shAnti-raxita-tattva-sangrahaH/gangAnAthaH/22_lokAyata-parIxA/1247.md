> “The names ‘body’, ‘sense-organ’ and so on are applied to particular combinations of earth and other material substances; there is no other reality than these.”—(1860)



## Kamalaśīla

An objection is raised—‘As a matter of fact, Consciousness (or Cognition) is always produced on the basis of such causes as the Eye and other Sense-organs, and Objects, in the shape of Colour (Forms);—this fact is too well known. How then is it said that Cognition proceeds from those material substances?’

The (Materialist’s) answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1860 above*]

Says the *Lokāyata-Sūtra*—“It is to the combination of these that the names ‘Object’ and ‘Sense-organ’ are applied;—the Sense-organ, etc. have no existence apart from the Great Material Substances the idea of those appear only in regard to the combinations of these;—and ‘combination’ has no existence apart from the combining elements;—these four Material Substances are well known by direct Perception.—Apart from these, there is no other Reality, equally well known by direct Perception;—and apart from Perception, there is no other Means of Cognition, which could prove the existence of the ‘other world’ and such things”.—(1860)
