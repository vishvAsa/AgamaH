> For instance, conceptual cognitions are not dependent upon sense-organs and objects,—because they come about even in the absence of the functioning of these latter,—as in the case of the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things.—(1931)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* disposes of the charge of ‘inadmissibility’ against the Reason just stated:—[*see verse 1931 above*]

‘*Tadavyāpāra, etc. etc*.’—Even when there is no functioning of the Sense-organ and the Object. When one thing comes about without the functioning of the other, this latter cannot be the cause of the former. Tf it were, it would lead to absurdity.—(1931)
