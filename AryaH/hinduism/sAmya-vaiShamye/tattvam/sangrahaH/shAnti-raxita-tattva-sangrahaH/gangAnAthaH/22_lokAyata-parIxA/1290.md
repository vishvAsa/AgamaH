> When the objects are present, there appear pleasure, etc.; from this pleasure, etc. proceed the ‘afflictions’ of love, hate and the rest,—being the outcome of the fruition of the impressions left by similar past feelings,—in men who are devoid of wisdom and are subject to evil propensities (?)—In accordance with the potency of things. Directly, the objects are not the cause of the feelings; if they were, a single affliction would be the cause of them all,—in regard to the object,—like the cognition of things.—(1954-1956)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“If Objects are not tile excitants of the feelings, then how is it that feelings of Love, etc. appear only when the Objects are present?”:—[*see verses 1954-1956 above*]

The process is as follows:—When the Object is present, there appears pleasure born of the sense-organ concerned;—from this Pleasure, proceed the ‘Afflictions’ of Love, etc.,—in men devoid of wisdom (and dispassion) and subject to evil propensities and tendencies,—out of the fruition of the Impressions left by the previously experienced feelings of Love, etc.; so that the Objects are not the direct cause of the feelings.

The following might be urged:—“You are only expounding your own doctrine; you state no reasons”.

The answer to this is—‘*A single Affliction*, *etc. etc*.’.—‘Single’—i.e. of a single kind.—‘*Tatra*’—in regard to the object.—‘*Tasya*’—of the object.—‘*Like the Cognition of things*’—i.e. like the Cognition apprehending the form of the *Blue* and other things.—As a matter of fact however, a single ‘Affliction’ is not what actually appears; for instance, in regard to the single object in the shape of the body of the Woman,—while in one man the feeling aroused is that of *Love*, in another it is *Hate*, while in yet another, mere *jealousy*; so that there are several kinds of ‘Afflictions’ (Feelings) that appear.—(1954-1956)
