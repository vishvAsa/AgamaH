> As other causes have been rejected, if the cognition were entirely without cause,—then, it could not have any particular character at all.—(1898)



## Kamalaśīla

All other causes, in the shape of the eternal things—Mind, Time, Space, God and so forth,—have been rejected before; and the view that the Cognition arises out of itself is not accepted; the only alternative left is that it should be *without cause*; but in that case it could not have any such particular (distinguishing) character as *Being Cognition* and the like. Because a character or property that is purely accidental cannot serve as a determinant, and hence there could he no determination on the basis of that.

Thus the *causelessness* of Cognition would be open to rejection by the incongruity of there being no possibility of the appearance of such distinguishing characters as that of *Being Cognition* and the like;—and there would be the further objection that if it were causeless, it would not be possible for the Cognition to appear only occasionally.—(1898)
