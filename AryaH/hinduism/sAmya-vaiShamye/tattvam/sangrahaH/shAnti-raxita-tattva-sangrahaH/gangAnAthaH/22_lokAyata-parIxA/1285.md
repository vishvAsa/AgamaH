## Kamalaśīla

The following *text* describes the upshot of the above arguments:—[*see verse 1944 above*]

‘*Name*’—verbal expression.—‘*Cognition*’—apprehension, knowledge;—‘*abhyāsa*’, repeated appearance.

The compound ‘*yannāma, etc, etc*,’ is to be expounded as ‘that birth during which there has been repeated cognition of the Name’,—this compound being in accordance with a particular rule (of Pāṇini’s)—‘*Saptamī*, etc.’;—the impressions are left by this repeated Cognition;—these Impressions have this ‘fruition’, development, attainment of their full character, by producing their effects;—and it is from this ‘fruition’ that the said Conceptual Cognition is born.

‘*Of the said persons*’—i.e. of new-born infaṇts.—(1944)
