## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been asserted, in *Text* 2885, that—“under the view of self-validity, there is no Infinite Regress, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3029 above*]

‘*The reasoning set forth previously*’—i.e. the one set forth under *Text* 3004 *et seq*.—(3029)
