> “[The opponent continues]—‘as, according to you, the letters are all-pervading, any particular arrangement cannot be inherent in themselves; because the arrangement is the product of articulation which is not-eternal,—It must, on that account, be non-eternal.—further, the said arrangement must be dependent upon the whim of the speaker, as it owes its appearance to his desire to speak. thus the eternality of the letters would be useless for you—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 279-280].—(2280-2281)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*According to you*—*Mīmāṃsakas*—Letters are all-pervading; hence there can be no order or arrangement among them, in relation to *space*; nor can it be in relation to *time*, because they are eternal; hence it could be there only as due to the *articulation* that manifests them;—and as this *articulation* is not eternal, what is due to it must also be non-eternal.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—‘What is due to something non-eternal must be non-eternal,—e.g. the Jar;—the order of the Letters is due to something non-eternal; hence this is a reason based upon the nature of things.’

Then again, what comes about through the man’s ‘desire to speak’ must be treated by the intelligent as of *human origin*,—like the shaking of the hands, the winking of the Eye and so forth;—and the Order of the Letters (in a word) comes about by the desire of man;—hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—(2280-2281)
