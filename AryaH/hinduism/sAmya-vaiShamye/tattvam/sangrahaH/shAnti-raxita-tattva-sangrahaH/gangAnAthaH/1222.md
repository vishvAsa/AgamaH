> It is the entity itself, when it does not indicate ‘difference from other things’, that is spoken of by the words ‘it is of the form’; just as ‘disposition’ is spoken of as ‘of the mind’.—(1806)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*When it does not, etc*. *etc*.’;—that is, when it ignores the difference from, other things.

‘*Spoken of as, etc*.’—i.e. as if it were something different.

‘*It is of the form, etc*.’—‘It’ stands for ‘Resistance’.

‘*By* *the words*’,—i.e. by the expression ‘Resistance *of* the Form’.

An example is cited—‘As *Disposition, etc. etc*.’.

The term ‘*api ca*’ should be understood in the cumulative sense.—(1806)
