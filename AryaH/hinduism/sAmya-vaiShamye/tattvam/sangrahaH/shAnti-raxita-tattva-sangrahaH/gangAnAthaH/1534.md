> The validity and reliability of the Veda may be due merely to eternal connection expressive of true things; even so, there is no one who ever perceives that connection, which is beyond the senses. All that is expressed by the words (of the Veda) is supersensuous; hence its connection also must be supersensuous; while all human beings by themselves are incapable of seeing things beyond the reach of the senses.—(2382-2383)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Satyārtha*’ qualifies ‘*nityasambandha*’.

As a matter of fact, the ‘eternal connection’ is something that has been assumed; and if it did not bring about the cognition of the meaning, its assumption would be futile; certainly it has no other character except that of being productive of the cognition of the meaning;—the operation of the connection consists only in bringing about the cognition of the meaning; how then can there be a Connection which does not bring about such Cognition? It is not by its mere presence that the Connection brings about the cognition; it does so only when it is itself recognised; if it were not so, then the cognition of the meaning w^(r)ould appear also in one who is ignorant of the convention (bearing upon the connection between words and meanings); and yet the connection cannot be recognised by any one; because one member of the connection—in the shape of Heaven, etc.—being beyond the reach of the senses, the connection itself must also be beyond it.

It might be argued that—“People capable of perceiving supersensuous things would recognise the connection”.

The answer to that is—‘*All human beings*, *etc. etc*.’—as has been declared in the following words—‘Thus there is no direct perceiver of things beyond the senses; if people know these things it is only through the Word’.

‘*Anatyakṣadṛśaḥ*’—capable of perceiving supersensuous things.—(2382-2383)
