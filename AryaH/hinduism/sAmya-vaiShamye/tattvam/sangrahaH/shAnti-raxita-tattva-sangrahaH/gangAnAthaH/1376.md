## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2107*]:

*Question*:—How then is Inference annulled by the Verbal Cognition (derived from the Veda)?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2108 above*]

[*verse 2108*]:

This has been thus declared—“The cognition derived from the words of the Veda is Perception, and Inference contrary to Perception cannot be valid”—(2108)

*Question*:—In what way is Verbal Cognition (derived from the Veda) stronger than Inference,—by virtue of which it is regarded as equal to Perception?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2109-2110 next*]
