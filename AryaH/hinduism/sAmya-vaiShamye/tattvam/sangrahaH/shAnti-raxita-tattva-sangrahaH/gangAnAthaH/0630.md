> Of these, ‘specific individuality’ cannot be denoted by words; because it can have no connection with the time of convention and usage.—(872)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to show that ‘Specific Individuality’ cannot form the ‘Import (or Denotation) of Words’ because there can be no Convention in regard to it:—[*see verse 872 above*]

‘*Cannot be denoted by words*’;—that is, because there can be no Convention in regard to it.

*Question*:—“Why can there be no Convention in regard to it?”

*Answer*:—Because there is ‘*viyoga*’, absence,—of connection with the time related to Convention and Usage,—‘*there can be no Convention in regard to the Specific Individuality*’ [this has to be supplied].

What is meant is that Convention is made for the purposes of usage; and not through mere love for it; hence people can rightly make Conventions only with regard to things present at the time related to that Convention and Usage;—not with regard to anything else. As regards ‘Specific Individuality’, it cannot be present at the time of the Convention and Usage; hence there can be no Convention in regard to it.—(872)
