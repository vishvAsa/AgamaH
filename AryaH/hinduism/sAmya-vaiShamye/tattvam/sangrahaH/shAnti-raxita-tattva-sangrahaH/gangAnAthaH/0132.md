> This doctrine of ‘Brahman’ also is similar to the doctrine of the ‘evolution from primordial matter’; and the objections urged against this latter should be understood to be applicable to the former also.—(152)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

With the following Text, the Author applies the previously-detailed objections to this doctrine also:—[*see verse 152 above*]

The objection may be stated thus:—‘The World cannot be the effect of Sound,—because it exists,—like the cognition of the Cause; hence what is meant to be the Cause cannot be the Cause,—because it cannot be so proved,—like the other Self’,—and so on.—(152)

*End of the Chapter on the Doctrine of* ‘*Sound-Brahman*’.
