> These people will have to admit that this ‘activity’ is either different from, or the same as, the object concerned; as there can be no other way in which it can really exist.—If it is something different from the object, then the past and future states of ‘present’ things would have to be regarded as formless,—because they are ‘causes’ and are ‘embellished’, and so forth,—like the activity. otherwise, the things would be everlasting; as the ‘form’ would be there all the time; and apart from this, there is no other characteristic of the ‘everlasting—(1794-1796)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The said Activity will have to be regarded by these people either as different from, or the same as, the Entity; as there can be nothing apart from both ‘difference’ and ‘non-difference’, as these are mutually exclusive; the affirmation of one being invariably concomitant with the denial of the other; and there is no other way in which the thing can exist.

If then the Activity is something *different* from the Entity, then the Past and Future states of Present things would have to be regarded as ‘formless’,—because of their being *causes* and being *embellished*,—like the Activity.—The term ‘*and so forth*’ is meant to include ‘being an entity’ and so forth.—*Otherwise*—that is, if, they were not formless in the Past and in the Future,—then, all ‘embellished’ things would have to be regarded as eternal; as the ‘form’ (or Nature) would be always there; and the ‘eternality’ of a thing is nothing more than *being always there*; as declared in the following words—‘The learned men regard that Form as *eternal* which is never destroyed’.—(1794-1796)
