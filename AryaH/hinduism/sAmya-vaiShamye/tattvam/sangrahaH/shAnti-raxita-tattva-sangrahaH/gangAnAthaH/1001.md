> In the case of such probans as ‘because he is the son of so and so’, the contrary being open to doubt, the three conditions are not present; because what is cited is not incompatible with the contrary.—(1416)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above,—under *Text* 1370—that “in the case of the Reasoning ‘He is dark because he is the son of so and so’, even though the Probans has all the *three* features, yet it is not conducive to certainty of cognition”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1416 above*]

It may be possible that the child may be the son of the man and yet be *not dark*;—there being no incompatibility in this, *the absence of the Probans*

*where the Probandum is known to be absent* is open to doubt [and this is one of the three features]; so that the Probans is not ‘three featured’; hence the example cited (by *Pātrasvāmin*) is not relevant.—(1416)
