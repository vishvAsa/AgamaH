> If there were absolute sameness of form, then cognition would become non-cognition; as for partial sameness of form, that would make every cognition apprehensive of everything.—(1358)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Absolute sameness of form*’ would consist in the fact of the *Cognition* being ‘excluded’ from exactly those homogeneous things from which the

*cognised* object is ‘excluded’,—while ‘partial sameness’ would consist in ‘exclusion’ from only a few of those.—(1358)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then, why has the *validity* of the Cognition been said to consist in its *being of the same form* as the Object?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1359-1361 next*]
