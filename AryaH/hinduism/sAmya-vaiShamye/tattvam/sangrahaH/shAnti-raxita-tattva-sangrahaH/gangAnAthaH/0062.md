> When the invariable concomitance (premiss) is stated in the general form, and the objection urged against it is on the basis of a particular aspect of it,—then this is said to be a futile rejoinder.—(69)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In a case where the invariable concomitance of the Probandum with the Probans is definitely known to be in a *general way*,—specially by means of the right cognition of its absence in the contrary of the ‘Subject’,—and yet the objection that is urged against it is on the basis of a *particular* aspect or character (of the Probans),—then such an objection constitutes a ‘Futile Rejoinder’,—In. the ease of the reasoning (put forward by the *Naiyāyika*) however, the invariable concomitance cited is not known to be in the *general* form; the Probans that has been objected to as being ‘unproven’ is one that has been put forward as being concomitant with a particular ‘arrangement of component parts’; hence this objection is not of the nature of a ‘Futile Rejoinder’,—(69)
