> “Why do you say that the word brings about the ‘exclusion of others’? as a matter of fact mere negation is not apprehended in the idea brought about by the word; on the contrary, in the case of all such words as ‘cow’, ‘*gavaya*’, ‘elephant’, ‘tree’ and so forth,—the verbal cognition that results is always in the positive form.”—(910-911)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

On hearing the term ‘*Apoha*’, the other party, having his mind perturbed, and not knowing the exact nature of this *Apoha*, proceeds to urge against that doctrine the fact of its being contrary to experience:—[*see verses 910-911 above*]

The particle ‘*iti*’ is to be taken as understood after ‘*anyāpohakṛt*’, The meaning is—“Why do you say that what is brought about by the word is the *exclusion of others*?”

Why should not this be asserted?

“Because, *as a matter of fact*, *mere negation*, *etc. etc*.; that is, ‘the exclusion of others’ is intended to be a mere negation; and mere negation does not figure in Verbal Cognition; on the contrary, Verbal Cognition is always found to apprehend the positive form of things; and what does not figure in Verbal Cognition cannot be rightly regarded as the ‘import of words’; as such an idea would lead to absurdities. Thus the Proposition (of the *Apohist*) is contrary to experience.”—(910-911)
