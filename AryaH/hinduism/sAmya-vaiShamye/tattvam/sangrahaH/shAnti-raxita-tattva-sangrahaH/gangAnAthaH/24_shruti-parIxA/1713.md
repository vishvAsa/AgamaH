> When, sir, that same, or something else, is repeated again and again,—is it not the manifestation of it that is repeated,—there being no difference?—(2718)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* sets forth the Author’s rejoinder to the above argument (of the *Sphoṭist*):—[*see verse 2718 above*]

‘*Nanu*’ signifies address—‘Sir’.

When ‘*that same*’—the Letter pronounced for the first time,—or ‘*something else*’, some other Letter contained therein,—is repeated again and again,—is it not the *manifesting* that is done? Certainly the *manifestation* would not fail to be accomplished when done by that. Thus then the only effect that the utterance of the subsequent Letters would have would consist in the repetition of the *manifestations*,—because all of them would be possessed of the same potency; this repetition can be repeated over and over again by the same Letter being repeated; consequently there would be no need for the utterance of the rest of the letters. Nor will it be right to regard the subsequent Letters as possessed of different potencies; because into what is indivisible and without parts, no new features can be introduced; and when no new features can be introduced, the assuming of diverse potencies would be useless.—(2718)

All that is said by the other party might happen, if the Manifestation were there; as a matter of fact, however, this Manifestation itself is not possible.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2719 next*]
