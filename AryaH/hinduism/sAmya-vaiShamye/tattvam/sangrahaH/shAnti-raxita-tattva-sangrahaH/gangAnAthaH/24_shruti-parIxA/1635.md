> Or, the additional property may be produced in the organ; but in no case could it exist in the *ākāśa*; nor could it be due to its connection with its receptacle; because it is eternal and independent. Hence, deafness, etc. could not come about through that either.—Even if *ākāśa* were with parts and divisible, the arguments would apply to it, on the ground of its eternality.—(2550-2551)



## Kamalaśīla

Even granting that additional qualities might appear,—the author points out that even so the theory is open to objection:—[*see verses 2550-2551 above*]

‘*Eṣa*’, ‘*it*’—stands for the *additional property*.

“Even if it does not exist there, it may come to it on account of its connection with its receptacle”.

*It could not be due to its connection with its Receptacle*.

As regards the argument that *Ākāśa* is not without parts,—the answer is that if the *divisible Ākāśa* is held to be eternal, then all the objections that have been urged against the view that ‘*the indivisible* Ākāśa is eternal’, become applicable. This is what is meant by the words—‘*Even if Ākāśa were divisible*, *etc*. *etc*—(2550-2551)
