## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2545*]:

It might be argued that—“there would be differences, by reason of the Auditory Organ being influenced by Merit and Demerit”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 2546 above*]

[*verse 2546*]:

‘Being eternal’ is the reason for ‘being independent’ and also for ‘being not influenced by Merit and Demerit’.—(2546)

*Question*:—“Even though it is independent, why cannot it be influenced (by Merit and Demerit)?”

*Answer*—[see verse 2547 above]

[*verse 2547*]:

‘Being independent’ implies that it is not an *effect*; and what is not an *effect* cannot be influenced or affected by anything; e.g. the Hare’s Horn, or the ‘Unconscious Destruction’ of things;—and the Auditory Organ is not an *effect*;—hence there is apprehension of a character contrary to the wider term.

‘*Being eternal*’ sets aside the ‘inadmissibility’ of the Reason:—‘*not being an effect*, *etc. etc*.’ sets aside its ‘inconclusiveness—(2547)
