> “The eternality of the sentence is to be asserted in the same manner in which the eternality of the connection (between word and meaning) has been asserted.—[*Ślokavārtika*—on sentence, 365].—Even though, in the case of the technical words like ‘*vṛddhi*’, what has been asserted may be possible because these deal with perceptible things; in regard to the Veda however, the idea of ‘conventionality’ is not possible; because by whom has the connection between heaven and the sacrifices (spoken of in the Veda)—which is beyond the reach of the senses,—been perceived?”—(2339-2340)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The reasoning that has been put forward above in support of the view that the Connection between the Word and its Meaning cannot be artificial,—under the *Text* 2257,—on the basis of that same reasoning the eternality of the Vedic Sentence also may be asserted.

The *Mīmāṃsaka* points out the ‘inconclusive’ character of the reasoning put forward by the Opponent, under *Text* 2337—in the words—‘*Because these deal, etc*. etc.’—In the case of the *Sūtras* like ‘*adeṅguṇaḥ*’, as they deal with things that are perceptible, it is possible that the ideas conveyed may be based upon Convention;—this however is not possible in the case of the *Veda*; because *Heaven* and such things—which are spoken of in the *Veda*,—are beyond the reach of the senses, and hence no Convention could be made (by men) regarding them.—(2339-2340)

Says the Opponent—If that is so, then the Veda may be meaningless. The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2341-2342 next*]
