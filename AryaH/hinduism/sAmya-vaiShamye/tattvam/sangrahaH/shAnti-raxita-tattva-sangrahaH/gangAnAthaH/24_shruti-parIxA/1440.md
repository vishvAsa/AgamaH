> “Other people who hold the view that the reflected image is actually produced (as something different from the reflected object) urge the following objection:—‘If the same sun is seen in the several vessels, why is not the same seen as being overhead (over one’s head, like the real sun)? how too could it be seen below, in wells and such other deep water-reservoirs, if the reflected image were not actually produced there? Further, how is it that when a man facing the east looks at the mirror, he perceives himself as facing the west?’”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words—183-185].—(2219-2220)



## Kamalaśīla

It was argued (under *Text* 2210) that ‘just as in the Water, the single Sun is seen as diverse, etc. etc.’; and as invalidating this reason, some people think that the Reflected Image is something entirely different from the Reflected Object; and they argue as follows:—

If what is seen (in the reflection), is the same Sun, and not the Reflected Image,—then, how is it that it is not perceived as being overhead? It could be so seen if the same Sun had been seen in different places (in the reflecting surfaces)—not otherwise; as otherwise there would be incongruities.

Further, in the ease of the Well, how could there be perception of the Sun lying so far deep inside, if its Reflected Image were not produced there?—Certainly the Sun does not actually exist there inside the Well.

Then again, when a man facing the East looks at the mirror, how does he come to face the West? Certainly a face is not seen to have been produced at his back.—(2219-2220)

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verses 2221-2223 next*]
