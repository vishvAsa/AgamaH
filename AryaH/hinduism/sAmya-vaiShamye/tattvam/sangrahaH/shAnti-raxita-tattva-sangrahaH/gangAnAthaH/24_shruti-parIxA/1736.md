> As regards ‘intentional destruction’, etc. these are not admitted to be productive (cause) of the effect in the shape of the cognition following from effort;—because these are all purely ‘illusory—(2747)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2322, that—“*Being perceived as following from effort* has been adduced as a Reason for the Word being a product and non-eternal;—this is Inconclusive, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2747 above*]

‘Cognition following from effort’ is the effect,—of which the producer or cause,—is said to be ‘Intentional Destruction’, etc.; but these are not admitted to be such cause.—Such is the construction of the sentence.

If it is in accordance with the view of the *Sautrāntikas* that the Inconclusiveness of our Reason is urged by the *Mīmāṃsaka*,—then such ‘Inconclusiveness’ cannot be admitted; because, according to those same philosophers, the ‘Intentional Destruction’, etc. have a purely ‘illusory’ existence and what is illusory cannot be productive of any effect; for, if it were, then it would lose that illusory character; because what is capable of effective action must be *real*, and everything other than this must be *illusory*; such are the characteristics of reality and illusoriness (unreality).—(2747)
