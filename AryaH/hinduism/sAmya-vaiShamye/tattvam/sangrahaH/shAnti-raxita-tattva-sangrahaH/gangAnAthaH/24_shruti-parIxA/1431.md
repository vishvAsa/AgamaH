## Kamalaśīla

[*verese 2203*]:

In the following *Text*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* sums up his position and explains the possibility of Deafness, etc.—[*see verse 2203 above*]

The *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to explain that the objections urged do not also affect the view that the embellishment pertains to the *object* (the Word-Sound that is heard).—[*see verse 2204 above*]

[*verse 2204*]:

It has been argued above (under *Text* 2157) that ‘if the Word-Sound were embellished, it should be heard by all men’,—This criticism is not applicable at all.—Why?—Because on account of the difference in the capacities of men; this difference in the capacity is due to the fact that in the case of some men the air embellishing the Organ is in close proximity to them, while in others, it is not so.—(2204)
