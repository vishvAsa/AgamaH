> “The cognition of such relationship of the word (to its meaning) could not be possible if the word were not-eternal; because, if the cognition of that relationship is admitted, it certainly proves the existence of the word at some other time also.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 243-244].—(2235)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—As regards the argument just set forth, there is no dispute at all; hence it is superfluous; as a matter of fact, there is no one who holds that any meaning is expressed by a Word whose connection with such meaning has not been already known. But the question is—In what way does this fact of the relationship of the Word being known prove its *eternality*?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2235 above*]

The relationship between the Word and what is denoted by it can he established only when both are present before the man;—and it is only when thus made that it could be cognised at a later time. All this could not be possible if the Word perished as soon as it was produced.

This is what is meant by the words—‘*It would not be possible if the Word were not-eternal*’.

If then, it is admitted that the Word existed at the time, then the idea of its having existed at other times becomes irresistible; as that would not be incompatible with the facts. This has been thus stated—‘If it exists during that time, who can destroy it later on?’—(*Text* 2139—*Ślokavārtika*—Eternality of Words, 366).—(2235)
