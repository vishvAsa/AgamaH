> “Just as in the case.of moving about and other actions, there is an order of sequence, through the ‘universal’ subsisting in the various factors in the action,—so a similar order of sequence may be there among the palate, etc., the articulation and the letter, through their respective universals.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 299].—(2296)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—When the Order *is* non-eternal by itself, how can its eternality be indicated by the Universal, by virtue of which, it would form part of Usage?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2296 above*]

Just as in the case of the particular Actions of Moving About and the like,—‘and the like’ including Ant-lines, etc.—the presence of the Order of Sequence becomes a part of usage, through the ‘Universal’, etc. subsisting in the various factors,—here also ‘*etcetera*’ includes the Universals in the Ant-lines, etc.,—so, in the same manner, the presence of the Order of Sequence among the Palate, the Articulations and the Letters is adopted in use, as indicated by the Universals subsisting in the Palate, etc.

The compound ‘*tālvādidhvanivarṇabhāk*’ is to be expounded as ‘*tālvādi*’, ‘Palate, etc.’—‘*dhvanayaḥ*’, ‘Articulations’,—and ‘*varṇāḥ*’, ‘Letters’ [a copulative compound]—‘that which bears this’ is ‘*tālvā*... *bhāk*’. Thus what is meant is that—(*a*) the Order of the Conjunctions and Disjunctions of the Palate, indicated by its own ‘Universal’, is the cause of the exhalation of the Articulation,—(2) the Order of the Articulations, due to the Order of the Conjunctions and Disjunctions of the Palate, etc., indicated by its own ‘Universal’, becomes the cause of the Order in the manifestation of the Letters; and this last becomes the cause of the comprehension of the meaning.

In some places, the reading is ‘*bhāgāḥ*’; under which the meaning would be as follows:—Just as the *parts* of the Actions of *Moving About* and the like, which appear in a certain Order of Sequence, become the basis of usage, when they are marked by a ‘Universal’ or by some other property,—similarly the Order of Sequence in the Palate, etc. becomes part of the usage.

Some people read ‘*Kramānusmṛtirevam syāt*’ (in place ‘*Kramānuvṛtti-revam syāt*’); which would be construed as follows:—Just as the parts of the Actions of *Moving About*, etc. are *remembered* as marked by the Universal, etc.,—similarly in the case of the Palate, etc. also there would be remembrance of the Order, as marked by the *Universal*, etc.—(2296)

Or, the Order of the Articulations may not be due to the Order of the Conjunctions and Disjunctions of the Palate, etc.,—it may be due to the Articulations themselves, because they *are* made up of component parts.—This is the view put forward in the following:—[*see verse 2297 next*]
