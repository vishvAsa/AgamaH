> Even as regards the view that there is embellishment of both, the assertion that it is open to both sets of objections is quite true; because deficiency is not in one of the two only; as the previous one continues.—(2572)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* in *Text* 2209, that—“As regards the view that there is embellishment of both, the assertion that it is open to both sets of objections is futile, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[see *verse 2572 above*]:

For those who hold the view that the Word-Sound is *produced*, it is possible that one or the other should be deficient;—it is not possible for those who hold that there is *Embellishment* (not *production*); as for them, the previous embellished form would continue to exist.—(2572)

The said ‘continuity’ is further clarified.—[*see verse 2573 next*]
