> The person who has been spoken of in the Veda as ‘not perishing’,—the denial of such a person through inference has been clearly set forth in the section where ‘the no-soul doctrine’ has been expounded.—The ‘universal’ and other things also have been shown there to have been discarded. The inference based upon well-recognised invariable concomitance, as explained before, is what sets aside the soul.—(2437-2438)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been declared in the Veda—‘This indeed is the Soul’; and in reference to this Soul, it is asserted—‘It is imperishable, it never perishes’;—and again—‘Indestructible indeed is the Soul, characterised by indestructibility—‘*Does not perish*’—i.e. is eternal. ‘*Are*’—is an expletive.

*Universal and other things*’—‘Other things’ stands for Qualities and Substances.—In what way these have been discarded by proofs, has been shown under the chapter on the ‘Six Categories’.—And the Inference that discards the Soul is one based upon well-recognised Premisses, shown under the Chapter on ‘No-Soul’,—(2437-2438)
