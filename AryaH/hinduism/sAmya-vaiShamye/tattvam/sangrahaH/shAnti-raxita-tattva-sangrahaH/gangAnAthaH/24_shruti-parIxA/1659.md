> It may be that the apprehension of the word-sound is dependent upon the manifesting articulations; but even so it could be apprehended only as it really exists; otherwise, the apprehension would not be of that sound at all; as its form would not figure in that apprehension. As a matter of fact, the word-sound is never apprehended as pervading over the whole *ākāśa*. Why then does the word-sound follow the diversity of place of the articulation? When manifested, it would appear by itself, like the jar and other things. All this about the cause has been said only by way of an elaboration of our argument. In reality the inefficiency of the manifesters has already been proved on the basis of the impossibility of manifestation.—As regards the directly perceptional notion that ‘this is the same word-sound’,—that has been already discarded; and it stands unrefuted that appearing in diverse places, the word-sound must be diverse.—(2601-2605)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued above, by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2211, that—“Because it is dependent upon the manifesting articulations, therefore it is apprehended only at the place where they are, etc. etc.”

Though this idea has been already refuted, the author reverts to it, in order to point out that the view is open to objection even if there be a manifester for eternal things:—[*see verses 2601-2605 above*]:

If the apprehension of the Word-Sound is dependent upon *manifesters*, then, how is it that it is not apprehended as pervading the entire *Ākāśa*, wherein it pervades? Its apprehension must be in that form; otherwise there would be incongruities; all this has been explained before. And yet the Word-Sound is not heard throughout the entire *Ākāśa*; hence it cannot be right that the hearing of sound is in accordance with the manifesting articulation; in fact, the apprehension must follow that Word-Sound alone of which it is the apprehension. Thus alone could there be apprehension of the Word-Sound, not otherwise. Consequently like the Jar and other things, the Word-Sound should always appear in its entire form. Such in brief is the sense of the text.

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.—(2601-2605)
