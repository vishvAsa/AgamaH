> “As a matter of fact, a word, whose relation shit to its denotation has not been apprehended, can never be expressive. If it were so expressive, then, each and every new word could express its meaning.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 242-243].—(2234)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Mīmāṃsaka* again proceeds to show that the Proposition that ‘the Word-Sound is not-eternal’ is annulled by the fact that the denotative or expressive potency of the Word cannot be explained otherwise (than by the Presumption of the eternality of the Word):—[*see verse 2234 above*]

The Presumption that is here put forward is itself based upon another Presumption: For instance, the *expressive* Potency of the Word is proved by the Presumption that Verbal Cognition cannot be explained except on that basis;—and this Potency cannot be explained except on the basis of the eternality of the Word; hence this Presumption is based upon the previous Presumption.

This same idea is expounded in detail in the *Text*—where it is shown that the Word by itself cannot be expressive if its relationship with its denotation has not been apprehended.

‘*If it were so expressive, etc*. *etc*.’;—if the word, whose relationship to the denotation has not been already apprehended, were expressive of its meaning,—then even a new word,—never heard before,—could express its meaning; for instance, words like ‘Cow’, etc. in the case of the inhabitants of the *Nārikela-dvīpa* (the Coconut-Isle) (who are not cognisant of such words).—(2234)
