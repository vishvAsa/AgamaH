> “Some people assert that when a word-sound is cognised by the ear as affected by the degree of the pitch,—then it is that there is apprehension of the peculiar degree of pitch, brought about on account of its being mixed up with the word-sound.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa*, 39].—(2148)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Tadupaśleṣa*’—being mixed with the Word-Sound.

‘*Tasya*’—of the Pitch.

‘*Bodhaḥ*’—apprehension.

‘*Some people assert*’.—What these people mean is that, though pure Pitch by itself is not apprehended by the Ear, yet when it is mixed up with Sound, it does become so apprehended; and hence the dual notion comes about.—(2148)
