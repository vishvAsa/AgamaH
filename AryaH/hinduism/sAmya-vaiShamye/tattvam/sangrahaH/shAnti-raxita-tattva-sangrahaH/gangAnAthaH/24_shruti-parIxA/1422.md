> “As a matter of fact, the auditory organ, the sound and its substratum have themselves no parts,—and they do not exist at any one place; even so, our view is not open to objection.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 78-79].—(2193)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—All the three factors—the Auditory Organ, the Sound and *Ākāśa* being without parts and all-pervading,—no *partial* existence is possible for any of them; then how do you get at the distinction into ‘hearing’ and ‘non-hearing’ determined by such partial existence?

Answer (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2193 above*]

The Auditory Organ, the Sound, and the substratum of the Sound—i.e. *Ākāśa*,—these themselves have no parts; yet such parts are attributed to them figuratively through the diversity among objects with which they come into contact;—this is what is meant by the qualifying term ‘themselves

‘*Even so, etc. etc*.’—‘our view’, regarding the partial existence, and restricted apprehension of sound and so forth.—(2193)

*Question*:—How so?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2194 next*]
