> It has been already explained that words do not bring about the cognition of things directly,—because there is no invariable concomitance between words and external things; all that the words do is to indicate the presence (in the speaker) of the desire to speak (of things).—(2619)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2252, that—“For these reasons the relationship between the Word and its meaning is declared to be eternal”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2619 above*]:

As a matter of fact, there is no real connection between the Word and the thing expressed by it,—which could be either eternal or non-eternal. Because it is not the external objects that words denote; as there is no invariable concomitance between them; as has been previously explained under the chapter on ‘Word’. And if words were to denote things without such concomitance, then there would be incongruities.

*Question*:—“If that is so, then what is it that the words express”?

*Answer*:—‘*All that the words do, etc*. *etc*.’—this ‘desire to speak’ also, they point to, not as something *denoted*, by them; they only serve as signs indicative of it. That is why they have been spoken of as ‘indicating’ the *Desire to Speak*. What happens is that when the Word is uttered, there appears a ‘conception’ envisaging the *object*, and not envisaging the *Desire to Speak*; and what is not envisaged by the Word when heard,—how can that be regarded as ‘denoted’ by it?—(2619)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then what is the connection between the words and the said *Desire to Speak*,—by virtue of which they could serve to indicate that Desire?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2620 next*]
