> “Thus the conclusion is that it is by means of the imperceptible capacity alone that these (articulations) impart an imperceptible capacity to the sense-organ concerned, and thereby appear as causes of the manifestation (of the word-sound).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 45].—(2173)

From all this it follows that these articulations, by means of their imperceptible Capacity, produce, in the Auditory Organ, an imperceptible Capacity, and appear as the causes of *manifestation*—i.e. ‘of Words and Sounds’, which has to be added.—(2173)
