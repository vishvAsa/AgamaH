> “And if the word existed for such a long time, who could destroy it after that?—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words—367].—For another reason again it is not possible for the word to be destroyed: in the case of the jar and other things, it is understood that they would become destroyed either through decay or through some weapon; there is no such cause by which the word could be destroyed.”—(2139-2140)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged (against the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—If the Word get at its denotation after a long time,—even so, how does it become proved that the Word exists for all time?

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verses 2139-2140 above*]

‘*For such a long time*’,—i.e. during which time it denotes its own meaning after excluding so many other factors.

Says the Opponent:—In the case of the Jar, etc. it is found that though they continue to exist for a long time, yet they come to be destroyed by the stroke of a stick or some such thing; the same may be the case with *Word* also.

The answer to this is—“*For another reason*, *etc. etc*.”—‘*Bhūyaḥ*’—again.

Things like the Jar undergo destruction either by decay or by the stroke of some weapon; there is no such cause for the destruction of the Word,—Why?—Because the Word is incorporeal, while the Jar and other things are corporeal.—(2139-2140)
