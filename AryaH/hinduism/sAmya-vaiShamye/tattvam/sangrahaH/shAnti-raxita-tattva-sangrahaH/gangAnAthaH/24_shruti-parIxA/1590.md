## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2473*]:

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 2136, that—“Inasmuch as the Word envisages several *Universals*, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2473 above*]

[*verse 2474*]:

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 2140, that—“In the case of the Jar and other things, it is understood that they would become -destroyed either through decay, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2475 next*]

[*verse 2475*]:

‘*This is what will*, *etc. etc*.’—As explained in the chapter on the ‘Permanent Character of Things’; where it has been explained that there can he no cause for the destruction of things. When in the case of the Jar also, there can be no cause for its destruction,—how can there be any for the destruction of the Word?—The term ‘*nāśakāraṇam*’ is to be construed with ‘*Śabde*’,

What is indicated by this is that the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* Reasoning is superfluous, and the Corroborative Instance *per Dissimilarity* is ‘inadmissible’.—(2475)
