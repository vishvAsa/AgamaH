## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2106, that—“One who asserts the falsity of the Vedic Word, on the basis of Inference, has his Proposition annulled by the force of the cognition derived from the Veda”.

The Buddhist’s answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2436 above*]

‘*The Reason that has been adduced*’,—under the Chapter on ‘Inference’; where the three kinds of Reason have been described, as (1) based upon the nature of things, (2) based upon the relation of Cause and Effect, and (3) based on Non-apprehension.

Such a Reason cannot be refuted; because it is inseparable from the real state of things.—No one can alter the real nature of a thing; because that would mean the producing of another state of the thing; and when another state of the thing is brought about, it does not mean anything for the thing itself; as that would lead to incongruities. Consequently when a certain thing has been proved by proofs, it cannot be set aside by any one. Otherwise if there were setting aside of what is established by proof, the proof itself would become vitiated; this would mean that there would be no confidence in any thing; and hence that proof would not be reliable at all.—(2436)

The same idea is further explained in the following:—[*see verse 2437-2438 next*]
