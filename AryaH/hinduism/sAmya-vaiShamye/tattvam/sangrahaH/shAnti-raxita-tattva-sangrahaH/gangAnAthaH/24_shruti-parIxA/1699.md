## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2685*]:

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2295, that—“The order of sequence among the Articulations would be due to the order among: the Conjunctions and Disjunctions of the Palate, etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2685 above*]

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, in *Text* 2296, that—“Just as in the case of Moving About and other actions, there is an order of sequence, through the Universal subsisting in the various factors of the Action,’ etc. etc.”

As against this, it is pointed out in the following *Text* that the Corroborative Instance, ‘Moving About, etc.’ is ‘inadmissible’:—[*see verse 2686 above*]

[*verse 2686*]:

That is, because the very idea of the ‘Universal’ itself has been discarded.—(2686)
