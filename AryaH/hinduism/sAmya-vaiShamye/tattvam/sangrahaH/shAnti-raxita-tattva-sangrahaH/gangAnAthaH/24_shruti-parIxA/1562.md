> For instance, when on the ground of ‘incorporeality’, the other party seeks to prove the eternality (of word-sounds),—and against this it is pointed out that, in view of pleasure, which also is ‘incorporeal’ (and yet not-eternal), the said reason is ‘inconclusive’,—it does not necessarily follow (from this counterargument) that the word-sound is perishable.—(2429)



## Kamalaśīla

For example, the man who holds the Word-Sound to be eternal,—with a view to prove the said eternality, which is one entity,—puts forward the argument that ‘the Word-Sound must be eternal, because it is incorporeal, like *Ākāśa*’;—thereupon his opponent puts forward the counter-argument that—‘The Word-Sound cannot be regarded as eternal, on the ground of its incorporeality, because in view of the case of Pleasure, the said reason is inconclusive’;—in this way, though the Reason for the entity, in the shape of ‘eternality’, has been refuted, yet it does not become proved that the said Word-Sound is *not-eternal*;—*so also in the case in question*—this clause is to be taken as understood.

The term ‘*yathā*’ in the *text* is misplaced; it should be understood as coming after ‘*uktepi*’.

After the word ‘*Śabdaḥ*’, the phrase ‘*nityaḥ siddhyati*’ has to be added. Or, a single use may be taken as serving both purposes,—as in the case of ‘*Bhīmā*’ and others.—(2429)
