> All, this attempt of yours is for the purpose of proving the oneness of the letter ‘*ga*’; and this is clearly and undeniably annulled by perception, as already explained to you.—(2483)



## Kamalaśīla

Further, even when the first party does not state it in so many words, *that* is regarded as to be proved which he has in mind; and as a matter of fact, it is not merely the Universal ‘Ga’ which you have in your mind as to be proved; what you really desire is to prove, through this *Universal*, the one-ness of the letter ‘*Ga*’; and it has been already shown before that such a Proposition as the latter is annulled by Perception and other Means of Cognition.

This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2483 above*]

‘*This attempt*’—at denying the substratum of the Universal ‘Ga’.

‘*Annulled by Perception*’—The particle ‘*ca*’ includes ‘annulment by *Inference*’ also.

‘Explained’—under the *Text* 2462 *et seq*.—(2483)
