> The idea of the air-currents being something different from the conjunctions and disjunctions has been already discarded before; and inasmuch as the air is not-momentary (according to the Mimamsaka), they cannot be the same as the conjunctions and disjunctions. for the same reason, as there are no distinctions in it, there can be no movement of it, specially because it has no velocity, and hence cannot go along as long as the velocity lasts.—(2529-2530)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* supplies the answer to what has been urged by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under the *Text* 2176, to the effect that—“Thus from the point of view of the Vedic Scholar, let us examine the matter, etc. etc.”:—[*see verses 2529-2530 above*]

‘*Before*’—under the examination of the ‘Six Categories’.

Says the Opponent—“If they are not *different*, then they may be *non-different*, same”.

*Answer*:—‘*Inasmuch as the Air, etc. etc*.’—The Air-currents themselves, produced as conjoined and disjoined, are spoken of as the ‘non-different Conjunctions and Disjunctions’; and what are *non-momentary* cannot become conjoined with things, in succession,—as they are all of one and the same form.—(2529-2530)
