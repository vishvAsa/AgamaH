> The manifestation of word-sound by articulation is not possible: that manifestation could be due to the embellishment either of the sound itself, or of the sense-organ concerned, or of both. if it were the sound that was embellished, then it would be cognised by all as so embellished; and it being impartite and all-pervading, there could be no embellishment of it in any parts.—(2156-2157)



## Kamalaśīla

If there were *manifestation* of the Word-Sound by the conjunctions and disjunctions of Air, it could be through the embellishment of the Sound itself, or through the embellishment of the Sense-organ, or through the embellishment of both—of the Sound and also of the Sense-organ.—If there were embellishment of the Sound, then when embellished at one place—at *Pāṭaliputra* for instance,—it would become apprehended by people in all places; as it goes everywhere simultaneously.

It might be said that only a part of the Sound becomes embellished.

The answer to that is that *it is impartite*,—not made up of parts, being incorporeal; hence, even though it is all-pervading, it being without parts, how could there be any embellishment *in part*?—(2156-2157)
