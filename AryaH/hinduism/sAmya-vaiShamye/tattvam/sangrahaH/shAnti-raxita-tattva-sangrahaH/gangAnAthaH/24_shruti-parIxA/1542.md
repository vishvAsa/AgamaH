> Further, if you are really eager to regard the Veda as valid and reliable, then try and prove that it is the work of a person free from defects and so forth. If it is composed by a faultless author and is expounded in the world by faultless expounders, it certainly can be the means of obtaining the cognition of the real truth regarding things.—(2400-2401)



## Kamalaśīla

The following text proceeds to urge that the reason for the validity and reliability of the Veda may be held to lie in the fact of its being the work of a reliable person; why rely upon its not being the work of anyone, which only shows your stupidity?—[*see verses 2400-2401 above*]

‘*And so forth*’—is meant to include the faultless *expounders*—(2400-2401)
