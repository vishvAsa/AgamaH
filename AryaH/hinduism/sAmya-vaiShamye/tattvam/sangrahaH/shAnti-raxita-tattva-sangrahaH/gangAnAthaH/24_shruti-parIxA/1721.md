> All this is quite compatible with the view that cognitions have forms; otherwise, as they would be destroyed, how could they figure in the remembrance?—(2726)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent:—“Even so, as the Letters will have ceased long ago, they do not exist at the time of the comprehension; how then could they enter into the cumulative Cognition?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2726 above*]

*Question*:—“Why is it not compatible with the view that Cognitions have no forms?”

*Answer*;—‘*Otherwise*, *etc. etc*.’.

Thus the cumulative cognition that *Kumārila* has urged against the upholder of the *Sphoṭa*—that “when the last Letter has been cognised, there is a simultaneous Remembrance of all the rest, brought about by the impressions of these” [*Ślokavārtika*, *Sphoṭa*, 112, reproduced here under *Text* 2721, with a slight variation]—is true only in accordance with our view, not in accordance with the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* view, that Cognitions are *formless*. This is what is meant by the *Text*.—(2726)
