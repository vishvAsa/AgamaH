> “Though the sun is one, yet it is seen (by one and the same man) as diverse in water and other surfaces at the same time; and yet it does not make it many; the same should be understood to be the case with sound also.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 178-179, though the reading there is slightly different].—(2210)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—If the Word-Sound is all-pervading, how is it that it is perceived as several—just like the Jar,—when there is diversity of place? As a matter of fact, as it is all-pervading, it should be always perceived in an uninterrupted form. Nor should there be any distinctions of *far* and *near* in the case of what is all-pervading;—nor can it come in from any place, as it is always present everywhere. Further as it is eternal, there can be no such distinctions as *long* and *short*, or of various degrees of loudness and so forth. Nor again is difference of *time* possible.—From all this it follows that—because Sound is actually perceived as affected and diversified in place, time and form, therefore, like the Jar, it must be *diverse* and *evanescent*. How then is it that the assertion has been made above (under *Text* 2207) that)—“Inasmuch as the idea of the production of Sound has been rejected, etc. etc.”?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verse 2210 above*]:

What is meant to be shown by this is that the fact of being perceived as diverse in different places, as a Reason for diversity, is ‘Inconclusive’.—(2210)
