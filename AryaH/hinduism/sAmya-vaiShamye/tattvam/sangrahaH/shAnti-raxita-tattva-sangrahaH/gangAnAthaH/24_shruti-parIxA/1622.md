## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Text*, the Author anticipates the objection that the Corroborative Instance—of the *Mind*—is one that is devoid of the Probandum,—and supplies the answer to it:—[*see verse 2527 above*]

*Uddyotakara*, *Kumārila* and others put forward the following arguments in support of the sense-organs being operative by direct contact:—“(*a*) The Eye and the Ear must be regarded as operative by contact,—because they are external organs,—like the Olfactory Organ. The qualification ‘External’ is added in order to avoid the charge of being ‘false’ in view of the *Mind* (which is *not* operative by contact).—(*b*) The Eye and the Ear must be regarded as operative by contact,—because being organs, they do not apprehend things hidden and far off,—like the Olfactory Organ. The qualification ‘being organs’ has been added for the purpose of excluding the *object*.—(c) Colour and Sound must be regarded as cognisable by means of those external organs that are operative by contact,—because they are objects of external organs,—like Odour and Taste.—(*d*) the Cognitions of Colour and Sound must be regarded as having for their objective basis such objects as are cognisable by means of external organs operative by contact,—like the Cognitions of Odour and Taste”.

The objections against these arguments are set forth in the following:—[*see verse 2528 next*]
