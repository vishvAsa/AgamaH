> The idea of a dual character of any objective entity has been rejected. consequently, in the case of the jar, it is not possible that one aspect of it should be eternal, in the shape of the ‘universal’.—(2751)

## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2751*]:

It has been urged by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2333, that—“If it is *indefinite*, then such a thing cannot be either entirely eternal or entirely non-eternal, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2751 above*]

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2335, that—“In the same manner the exact nature of *non-eternality* also has to be considered, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2752 above*]

[*verse 2752*]:

Wherefore then can our Corroborative Instance be ‘devoid of the Probandum’?—(2752)
