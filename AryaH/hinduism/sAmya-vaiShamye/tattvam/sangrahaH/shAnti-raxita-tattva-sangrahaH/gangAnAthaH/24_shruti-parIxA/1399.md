> If *ākāśa* is the substratum,—even so, *ākāśa* itself being without parts, there could be no embellishment in part, because the word-sound is always cognised as a whole.—(2159)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the other party—As a matter of fact Sound is a quality of *Ākāśa*, and qualities always subsist in the Substance to which they belong; so that *Ākāśa* would be the substratum (or receptacle) of Sound.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2159 above*]

The said *Ākāśa* being without parts, the diversity in the embellishment could not be due to the diversity of the parts of the substratum.

The Opponent argues thus—Though *Ākāśa* is without parts, yet there is diversity among substances coming into contact with *Ākāśa*; e.g. we have ‘the *Ākāśa* in the Jar’ and so forth; so that the *Ākāśa* within the tympanum of one man would be different from that within another man’s.

The answer to that is—‘*Because the Word-Sound*, *etc. etc*.’—this is to be construed with the sentence ‘*there could be no embellishment in part*’; the sense being that Sound itself is always apprehended as being without parts and such an apprehension would not be possible if the embellishment belonged to only one part of the *Ākāśa,*.—(2159)
