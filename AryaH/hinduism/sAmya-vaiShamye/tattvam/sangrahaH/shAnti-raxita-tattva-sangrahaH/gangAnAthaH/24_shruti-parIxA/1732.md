> ‘Eternality’ consists in continuing in the same condition; and the opposite of this is ‘non-eternality’. in the continuing in the same condition ceases, what is left there that could be held to be ‘extant’?—(2743)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2315, that—“If by *non-eternality* is meant amenability to absolute destruction, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2743 above*]

‘*What is left*, *etc*. *etc*.’—The ‘condition’ is not anything different from the entity to which it belongs; hence when the *condition* has ceased, the entity also, as a consequence, ceases. Otherwise, if one thing does not share the fate of another, it cannot be right to say that it is of the same nature as the other.—(2743)
