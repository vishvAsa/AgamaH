> As the understanding is come to by many persons at one and the same time, the convention is not held to be different (with each individual); just as in the case of the one blue-point. It is not that one connection or relationship is present in the mind of the speaker, and an entirely different one in that of the hearer; because it is of one and the same form and is present, as such, in the minds of both. When the speaker proceeds to lay down a connection for the benefit of the hearer, he lays down only that connection which has been known to himself from before. Thus, inasmuch as its recognition always appears in the same form,—even when the word, etc. are different, he comes to cognise the oneness (of the connection).—(2632-2635)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2256, that—“As there would be difference between the ideas of the Speaker and the Hearer, the use of the Word would become vitiated, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2632-2635 above*]:

Just as the Blue-point, even when seen by several people, does not become diverse,—similarly, even when the Convention regarding the connection is made by several people, the connected (Word) will not become diverse; what to say of the case where only two persons are concerned? That is to say, all the persons have the same notion regarding it. Consequently, the connection for the Hearer would not be different from that of the Speaker.—(2632-2635)
