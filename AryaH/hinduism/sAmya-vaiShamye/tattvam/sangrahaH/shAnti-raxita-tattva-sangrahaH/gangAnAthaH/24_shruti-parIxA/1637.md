> Thus then, there is no ‘embellishment’ possible, either in the auditory organ or in the word-sound; because it is not possible for the embellishment to be either different or non-different (from them). For instance, if the embellishment is something different from the auditory organ and the sound, then these two cannot be regarded as ‘embellished’; as these would have no relationship with the embellishment; because between two different things, the only relationship possible is the causal one; and if this relationship were there, then the embellishment would be there at all times, as its cause would be there at all times.—Even under the view that the embellishment is not something different,—it would be eternal, like the auditory organ and the sound; and hence it could not be produced by anything; consequently the cognition (due to the embellishment) would be everlasting.—Because all this is so, therefore any regulation or restriction of the capacity of the air-currents, etc. cannot be possible; and when what is to be accomplished is not present, the capacity to accomplish it can be of no use.—(2554-2558)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2194, that—“The vibrating air-particles, which are the manifesters, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2554-2558 above*]

‘*Yadā’—Because*—‘*Evam*’—‘Thus,—in the manner just described, this ‘*because*’ has to be construed with ‘*tat*’ ‘therefore, etc. etc.’ of *Text* 2558.

How this embellishment is not possible is explained in detaū, in the words—‘*Because it is not possible for the embellishment*, *etc, etc*.’—What is meant is as follows—When the embellishment comes, it could be either *different* or *non-different* (from the thing embellished); these are the only two possibilities, as the matter does not admit of a third alternative.

In the former case,—i.e. if it is *different*,—there could be no ‘embellishment’ of the auditory organ or of the Word-Sound; because what is brought about is different; and when the Jar is brought about, it is not the Cloth that is embellished. Nor can there be any relationship between the Embellishment and the said two (Auditory Organ and the Word-sound); by virtue of which by the bringing about of the Embellishment, which is their relative, those two could become embellished.—Because, as it has been held to be different, the relationship of the Embellishment with the Auditory Organ or the Word-Sound could not be of the nature of ‘identity’; in fact whenever there is a relationship between two different things, it can be only of the nature of *Cause and Effect*; as there could be no help in any other way. If there were this relation of *Cause and Effect* between the Embellishment and the other two (Auditory Organ and Word-Sound),—the Embellishment would be there for all time, as its cause, in the shape of the Auditory Organ and the Word-Sound, would be there all the time (both of these being eternal, *ex hypothesi*).

Under the second alternative (that the Embellishment is *not different* from the Auditory Organ and the Word-Sound), the difficulty is that—

‘*Even under the view, etc. etc*.’—‘*Tadvat*’—Like the Auditory Organ and the Word-Sound.—‘*Asau*’—the Embellishment;—and hence, as it would be eternal, the Embellishment could not be produced or brought about by anything.

Thus, under the view that Cognitions are produced by the Embellishment, every cognition would be eternal. This is the difficulty in the Embellishment being eternal.

The whole argument is summed up in the words—‘*Therefore any regulation or restriction, etc. etc*.’—(2554-2558)
