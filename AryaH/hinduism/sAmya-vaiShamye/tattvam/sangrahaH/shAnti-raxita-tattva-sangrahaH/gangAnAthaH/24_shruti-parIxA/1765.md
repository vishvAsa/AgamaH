## Kamalaśīla

‘*Based upon others*’—propounded through the ideas of other people.

‘*Having their source in, etc. etc*.’—i.e. that which has its source in the notions and impressions of other people.—Or ‘that which is prone to be brought about by the impressions of other people’. The ‘*Ka*’—affix in this case would have the reflexive sense.—It would be so, because even those doctrines that have been propounded on the strength of the propounder’s own intuition,—proceed on the basis of the objective conceptions handed down by other people; hence these also have their source in those same conceptions, just as is the case with the customs of people based entirely upon what is actually visible.—(2797)
