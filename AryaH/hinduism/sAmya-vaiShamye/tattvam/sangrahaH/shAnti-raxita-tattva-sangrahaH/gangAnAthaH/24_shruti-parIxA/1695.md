## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2291, that—“The idea in the mind of every speaker is that ‘I am uttering words that have been used by other persons’; this in itself makes them eternal, etc. etc.”. The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2679 above*]

‘*Karmabhedavat*’—the ‘*vati*’—affix added after the Locative ending. This points out the possibility of the recognition of similarity leading to a conclusion contrary to that desired by the other party, and thereby indicates its ‘inconclusiveness’ as a reason in support of the latter.—(2679)
