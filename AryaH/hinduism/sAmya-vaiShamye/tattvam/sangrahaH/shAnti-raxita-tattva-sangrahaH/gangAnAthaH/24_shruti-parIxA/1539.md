> That Vedic scholars derive unshakable notions from the Veda is due to their minds being influenced by faith; and this is equally present in other people’s minds, in respect of other assertions, for example, quite as unshakable notions are derived by the Buddhists regarding trouble and suffering resulting from sacrifices which involve the killing of animals. Of this latter notion we do not find any sublation till now. If it be said that “there may be sublation of it at some future time and place”,—the same is equally possible in the case of the Vedic sentence also.—(2391-2393).



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—“As a matter of fact intelligent Vedic scholars do actually obtain unshakeable notions from the Veda; hence the Reason cannot be ‘inadmissible’”.

The answer to that is that such notions may be obtained; but even so, if the Reason is not ‘inadmissible’, it certainly is ‘Inconclusive This is shown in the following—[*see verses 2391-2393 above*]

‘*Sā*’—the firm conviction.

‘*Anyeṣām*’—of the Buddhist and other people.

‘*Anyataḥ*’—“from such sentences as ‘From sacrifices, involving the killing of animals, proceed trouble and suffering’.

This is what is shown in the sentence beginning with ‘*For example*, *etc*. *etc*.’—It is easily understood.—(2391-2393)
