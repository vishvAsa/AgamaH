## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2343, that—“what has been said regarding the Veda might be said regarding the Mahābhārata; but it is forestalled by the remembrance of its author, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2790 next*]

A similar Inference may be made, such as—The study of the words of the Buddha must have been preceded by similar study, because it is spoken of as the ‘study of the words of the Buddha’,—like the present study of the same.—(2790)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then how can the words be regarded as those of the Buddha?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2791-2792 next*]
