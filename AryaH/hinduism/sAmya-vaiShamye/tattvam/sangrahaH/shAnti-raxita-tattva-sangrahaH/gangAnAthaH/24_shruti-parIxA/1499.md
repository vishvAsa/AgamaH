> “Just as the reason ceases to be a true reason if it does not reside in the ‘subject’, according to the other party,—so also, if it is devoid of affirmative and negative concomitance”.—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 344-345].—(2318)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—Even though, by reason of the other party (Vaiśeṣika) admitting the *Universal*, the negative concomitance is not available,—yet as the *Bauddha*, who is the main opponent of the *Mīmāṃsaka*, does not admit the *Universal*, the said negative concomitance would be quite available; how then can the Probans be said to be *Inconclusive?*

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2318 above*]

The principle is that ‘that Probans alone is able to prove or disprove which is admitted by both parties’; hence, that Probans which is not admitted by any one of the two parties to reside in the ‘Subject’ becomes ‘fallacious’; in the same manner, it becomes fallacious, if either party does not admit its affirmative and negative concomitance (with the Probandum).

The construction is ‘*anvayavyatirekayoḥ asiddhayoḥ*’, ‘if the affirmative and negative concomitance are not admitted’.—(2318)
