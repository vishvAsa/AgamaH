> “In seeking to prove the non-eternality of words, the other party incurs the odium of contradicting his own words? etc.; as a matter of pact, every proposition is asserted only for the purpose of bringing about the comprehension of what one desires to prove; and it has been explained that the non-eternal word cannot express its own meaning, consequently, as your own assertion expresses its meaning, it follows that it must be eternal; and thus there is rejection of the destructibility (non-eternality, of the word).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 313-314],—(2304-2305)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to point out that in denying the eternality of Words, the Opponent goes against (*a*) his own words, (*b*) against his own doctrine, (c) against scriptures, and (*d*) against common experience:—*see verses 2304-2305 above*]

‘*His own words, etc*.’—‘Etc.’ is meant to include the contradiction of his own *accepted doctrines*.

‘*It has been explained*’—Under the Text—‘A Word is not expressive if its connection with the meaning is not known’, (See *Text* 2234.)

‘*Consequently, it follows, etc. etc*.’—The ‘eternality’ follows from—is proved by—the comprehension of the meaning. That is, the eternality is proved by the fact of the ‘comprehension of meaning’ being otherwise inexplicable.—(2304-2305)
