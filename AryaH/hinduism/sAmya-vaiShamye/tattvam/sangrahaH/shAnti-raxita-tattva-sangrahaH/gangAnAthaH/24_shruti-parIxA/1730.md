> The objection in question has been urged by the other party, through ignorance that his doing so involves self-contradictions on his part; because there are all these (self-contradictions), if you hold to the view of the eternality (of letters and words).—It has been already explained that if words are eternal, they cannot be expressive; because they could not have any connection with the order of sequence (among the component letters) and so forth; also because they are not perceived at all times.—(2735-2736)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* points out that the argument put forward by the other party involves ‘self-contradiction’:—[*see verses 2735-2736 above*]

‘*All these*’—self-contradictions.

‘*With the order of sequence*’,—‘*and so forth*’ is meant to include the fact of their ‘hearing’ and ‘remembrance’ being successive. All this is so, because on account of the eternality (of words) the particular order of sequence cannot be due to *time*; and on account of their all-pervasiveness, it cannot be due to *place*; nor can it be due to *manifestation*; because the idea of such ‘manifestation’ has been already rejected.—Similarly, in the bringing about of cognitions, *eternal* words can serve no useful purpose; as has been explained on several occasions.—(2735-2736)
