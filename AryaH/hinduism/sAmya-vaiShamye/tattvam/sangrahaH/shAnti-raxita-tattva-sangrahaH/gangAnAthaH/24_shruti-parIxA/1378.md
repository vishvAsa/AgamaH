> “While the Veda is clearly bringing about the cognition of things, the assertion that ‘it is not a means of cognition for me’ should not be made by a truthful person, by reason of sheer malice. It cannot cease to be a means of cognition, on the ground that there is malice against it or because it is not popular; nor can anything become a means of cognition, on the ground that one likes it and it is popular. Even those who are hostile to the Veda do not assert any reason why it should not be a means of right cognition;—by virtue of which they could be regarded as truthful people. When people, who have been intent upon the study, the retention and the exposition of the veda and upon the performance of acts enjoined therein, have not been able to detect any grounds of falsity, how can they be detected by persons who have kept themselves aloof from it? It is only persons who are fully conversant with a thing and who have their purpose centred therein that can detect the good and bad points of that thing. Those evil-minded people on the other hand, who are hostile to Vrahman and have been far removed from the Veda,—how can those people bare-facedly speak of the good and bad points in the Veda?”—(2111-2116).



## Kamalaśīla

This is how the *Mīmāṃsaka* argues—“Things do not become established or otherwise merely according to one’s whim; by virtue of which the mere assertion of the opinion would set aside the validity of Verbal Cognition; what is established by reason must be accepted by both parties; it has been explained that the conviction derived from the Vedic declarations regarding *Agnihotra*, etc. is exceptionally strong; how then can it be said that it is *not* a Means of Cognition? It is a mere assertion of yours, wholly devoid of reason”.—Such in brief is what is meant by the *Mīmāṃsaka*.

‘*Because it is not popular*’.—People’s agreement constitutes its popularity.

‘*Aloof from, the Veda*’—*Śākya* and others who keep away from the Veda; because they are excluded from its study, etc.

‘*Who have their purpose centred therein*’—i.e. whose *purpose*—ends of life, in the shape of sacrifice, etc.—is *centred*—expounded—in the Veda.

‘*Hostile to Brahman*’—i.e. Hostile to the Veda. Or ‘Brahman’ may be taken as standing for the knowledge derived from the Veda.—(2111-2116)

“Or, it may be that the Inference is not annulled by Verbal Cognition; even so, the Proposition of the Buddhist is defective; because it is annulled by Perception and other Means of Cognition”.

This is the idea expounded in the following:—[*see verse 2117 next*]
