## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2175, that—“For them, *the absence of contact* being equally present in the case of distant and near sounds, the apprehension and non-apprehension by people far and near would be equally possible, and there could be no order of sequence”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 2522 above*]

‘Successive Apprehension’ is not admitted, because the Cognitions of all men appear simultaneously.—(2522)
