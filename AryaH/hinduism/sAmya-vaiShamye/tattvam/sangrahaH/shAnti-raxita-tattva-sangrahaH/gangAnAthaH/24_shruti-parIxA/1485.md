> “The order of sequence among the articulations would be due to the order among the conjunctions and disjunctions of the palate, etc.; and the eternality of both would be due to their respective universals.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 298].—(2295)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—Though there are distinct Universals of the Articulations, yet, even when these Articulations are marked by those Universals, they cannot bring about the particular order in which the Letters are manifested,—unless the Order is there. Because even though, through their respective Universals, they are distinct from one another, yet there can be no Order inherent in themselves; because they are impartite things. Under the circumstances, how can there be any idea of the Order among Letters, brought about by the Order in their manifester?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2295 above*]

Though there is no Order among the Articulations by themselves, yet the Order among them is brought about by the Conjunctions and Disjunctions.

*The eternality of both*,—i.e. (1) of the Order of the Conjunctions and Disjunctions with the Palate, etc., and (2) of the Order of the Articulations,—is due to the Universals subsisting in them respectively.

Thus everything is all right.—(2295)
