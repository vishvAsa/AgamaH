> It may be that what is perceived by the downward rays is the sun shining above presented mediately; but even so, the perceiver regards the sun shining above as actually down in the water.—If the sun were actually perceived just as it stands, then it would be cognised as such, not otherwise. this has been already explained.—(2584-2585)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* in *Text* 2221, that—“When a man is looking at the Sun and the Water, his eye (rays) proceed in two ways—one upwards and the other downwards, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2584-2585 above*]:

‘*What is perceived*’—by the Soul.

‘*Shining above*’—this qualifies the ‘Sun’, as it exists.

‘*Regards*’—i.e. the perceiving Soul thinks.

What is meant is as follows:—If what the Percipient Soul sees is the Sun shining above, presented to him mediately, through the downward rays,—how is it that he regards the Sun as actually down in the water, and not as shining above? It would be regarded as such, if it were actually apprehended as it exists; otherwise there would be incongruities.—(2584-2585)
