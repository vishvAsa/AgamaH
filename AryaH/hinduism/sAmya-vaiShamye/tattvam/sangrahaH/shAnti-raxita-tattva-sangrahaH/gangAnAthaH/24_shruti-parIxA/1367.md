> “In the case of the assertion of human beings, it is always open to doubt whether or not there are defects (in the speaker); in the case of the revealed word, however, as there is no speaker, we can have no suspicion of there being any defects.”—(2087)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *text*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* shows that his Reason is not open to the charge of being ‘Inadmissible’:—[*see verse 2087 above*]

As a matter of fact, Defects reside in human beings only,—as they are their property; how then could they be there where their substratum is absent? If they could be there, they would be there without a substratum (baseless); in fact it is the very nature of the *subsistent* thing that it should follow in the wake of its substratum;—and Man—the doer, the compiler, the speaker—is the substratum of Defects; and any such author is not there in the case of the Veda; whence then could there be any suspicion of there being Defects?

This same argument has set aside also the charge of the Reason being ‘doubtful—hence inadmissible’.—(2087)
