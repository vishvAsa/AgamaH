> At the time that the word-sound is heard, there is no perception of the air-currents reaching the ear and embellishing the auditory organ. when the sound is cognised through the ear as embellished by the pitch,—there is idea of the pitch as related to that sound; and this idea is clearly annulled by direct perception.—(2486-2487)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2148, that—“When the Word-Sound is cognised by the Ear, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2486-2487 above*]

If it were known by any Means of Right Cognition that ‘there axe Air-currents embellishing the Auditory organ’, then there might be some justification for saying that ‘the Auditory organ is embellished by the Pitch’, As a matter of fact, however, no such Air-currents are known; hence there is the idea of the Pitch only as related to the Sound and that this idea is perceptional is entirely fanciful.—(2486-2487)
