> Otherwise [if the Veda were not the work of a person],—as the Veda would be eternal and all-pervading, there could be no sequential order in it. as a matter of fact, there can be no sequence in what is eternal; as there can be no ‘manifestation’ of it.—(2422)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* shows that the Reason just adduced is not ‘Inconclusive’:—[*see verse 2422 above*]

‘*Otherwise*’—if the Veda were not the work of a Person, and if it were eternal and all-pervading,—then there should be no sequence in regard to it.

Because in the case of the Veda, there cannot be any sequence of *time*, as there is in the case of the Seed and the Sprout; because being eternal, the words must be all synchronous.—Nor can there be sequence of *place*, as there is in the case of the line of ants; because, being all-pervading, they must occupy the same points in space.—Nor can there be sequence of *manifestation*; because what is eternal cannot have any peculiarity imposed upon itself, and hence cannot become *manifested*.—(2422)
