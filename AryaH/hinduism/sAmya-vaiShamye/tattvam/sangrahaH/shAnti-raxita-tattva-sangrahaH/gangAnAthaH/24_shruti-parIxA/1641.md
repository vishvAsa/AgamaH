> If the word-sound is, by its very nature, definitely capable or incapable,—what hostile or helpful force could set it aside?—(2565)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be argued—“Even if the Word-Sound had the capacity to bring about its cognition, it might not bring it about on account of forces to the contrary; similarly, even if it did not have the capacity, it could have the capacity imparted to it by auxiliary forces and thereby bring about the cognition

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2565 above*]

Unless a thing sets aside, or brings about, the nature of a thing, it cannot be regarded as hostile or helpful; otherwise there would he incongruities. And if the said *setting aside* or *bringing about* were admitted, the Word-Sound would lose its eternal character.—(2565)
