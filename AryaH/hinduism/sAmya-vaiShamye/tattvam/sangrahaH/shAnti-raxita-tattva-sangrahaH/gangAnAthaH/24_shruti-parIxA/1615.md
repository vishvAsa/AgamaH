> If it be urged that—“there is attraction by the magnet on account of the contact (of the iron) with the light emanating from the magnet”,—then the answer is that, as no such light is visible, how is it known that it exists?—(2520)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In the following *Text*, the Author anticipates and answers the objection that has been taken by *Śaṅkarasvāmin* against the admissibility of the instance of the ‘Magnet’ just cited:—[*see verse 2520 above*]

*Śaṅkarasvāmin* has argued as follows:—“In the case of the Magnet, the attraction of the Iron is due to its being penetrated by the Light-rays emanating from the Magnet; for, if it were not so, then there would be attraction of all Iron-pieces in the world. Even though the Light emanating from the Magnet is not perceived in the manner of the Light emanating from the Lamp, yet it can be inferred from the fact that there is attraction even where the Iron is at some distance, if there is nothing between the Iron and the Magnet”.

The answer to this is—‘*As no such Light*, *etc*. *etc*.’—The phrase ‘*it is not visible*’ denies the propriety of the Light being existent,—on the ground of its non-apprehension.—(2520)
