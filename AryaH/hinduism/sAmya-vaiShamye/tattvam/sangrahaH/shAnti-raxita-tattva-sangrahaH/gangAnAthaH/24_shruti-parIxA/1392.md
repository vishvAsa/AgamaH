For example, until the Light is seen, there is no perception of the Jar illumined by it.

With the above idea in his mind, the Opponent of the *Mīmāṃsaka* urges the following objection:—[*see verse 2147 above*]

‘*One for whom*’—i.e. the Grammarian and others, according to whom the manifester consists of the letter-Sound in the form of *ghoṣa* (articulation), not of the conjunctions and disjunctions of Air,—for such men both, the *Manifested* (letter-Sound) and the *Manifester* (articulation), are apprehended by auditory perception; for such people, there may be the two notions,—the notion of all as one, and also the notion of the peculiarities of the pitch, etc. But for you, the *Mīmāṃsaka*, how could the Pitch, which is in the form of the conjunctions and disjunctions of Air, bring about the notion of the peculiarities,—as such Pitches, etc. are not perceptible by the Ear?—(2147)
