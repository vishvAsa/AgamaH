> The Vedas being perceptible in their character, there is appearance of them when there is operation of the ‘manifester’: if they existed even before that operation, then they should be perceptible at that time also.—(2419)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even granting that there can be a ‘Manifester’ of the eternal thing;—such a ‘Manifester’ does not differ from the ‘maker’,—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2419 above*]

Nothing can be regarded as ‘Manifester’ unless it *does* something; otherwise there would be incongruities'; and if it *does* something, then it becomes admitt ed that it is the *producer*; because *the production* of a particular thing consists only in the coming about of another character.

‘*Being perceptible in their character*’—This qualifies the *Vedas*.

It might be argued that—“the Vedas were perceptible in their character even before; then how can they be said to appear through the operation of the *Manifester*”?

The answer to this is—‘*If they existed even before*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Teṣām* stands for the Vedas that are perceptible in their character.—(2419)

The same idea is further supported:—[*see verse 2420 next*]
