> “The utterance of the word, the setting up of its connection and its use,—all this process is, by its very nature, successive; how could any one perform all this simultaneously?”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 258-259].—(2246)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be urged that—if the successive utterance, etc. of the nonsequential Word is not possible,—they may be simultaneous.

The answer to this, from the *Mīmāṃsaka*, is as follows:—[*see verse 2246 above*]

\(1\) Utterance of the Word, (2) the setting up of its connection, (3) actual usage,—all these three acts are, by their very nature, such as can be done only one after the other; and it is absolutely impossible to do them all at the same time. And when there is no simultaneity, there can be no setting up of the Connection. If succession were waited for, that would mean that the Word continues to exist for some time (other than the one at which it is produced).—(2246)

The *Mīmāṃsaka* reaffirms his view in the following:—[*see verses 2247-2248 next*]
