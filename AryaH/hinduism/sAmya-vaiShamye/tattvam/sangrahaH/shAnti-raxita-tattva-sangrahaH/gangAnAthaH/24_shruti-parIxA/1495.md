> “It has to be explained what the ‘śabda’, ‘word-sound’, is which is being proved to be perishable.—(*a*) Is it the ‘aggregate of the three attributes’?—Or (*b*) something atomic?—Or (*c*) ‘a qaulity of *ākāśa*’?—Or (*d*) something in the form of mere sound, as apart from the letters? Or (*e*) something in the form of air [*see notes below*], not expressive (of meanings)? Or (*f*) ‘sphoṭa’ in the form of words and sentences? Or (g) mere ‘similarity’? Or (h) the ‘exclusion of others’?—All these may be non-eternal; according to us eternality does not belong to these.—Hence your reasoning is open to the defects of (1) having a ‘subject’ whose exact nature is not known or admitted, and (2) having a ‘probans’ which has no substratum (or basis)”,—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 318-321].—(2310-2312)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to point out the defects in the ‘Subject’ (Minor Term) and in the ‘Reasons’ (Probans) of the Reasoning put forward (by the Opponent)—[*see verses 2310-2312 above*]

The Texts sets forth the several views that have been held by various philosophers regarding the exact nature of ‘*Śabda*’ ‘Word-sound’ (in the present context).

(*a*) According to the *Sāṃkhyas*, ‘*Śabda*’ is held to be something consisting of the ‘Three Attributes’ of Harmony, Energy and Inertia.—(*b*) According to the *Digambara* (*Jainas*), it is something *atomic*;—‘pudgala’ is *Atom*; what pertains to the *pudgala*, is *paudgala*, ‘atomic’; i.e. consisting of the Atom.—(c) The followers of *Kaṇāda* hold it to be a ‘quality of *Ākāśa*—(*d*) According to the common people, it is something of the nature of mere Bound, as apart from the Letters; as has been declared in *Patañjalūs Bhāṣya*—‘Or, *Śabda* among men is known as *sound* whose meaning is well known’.—(*e*) According to the author of the *Śikṣā*, it is of the nature of *Air*, not expressive; as declared by them ‘The Air becomes the *Śabda*—(f) The Grammarians hold *Śabda* to consist of the *Word-sphoṭa* and *Sentence-sphoṭa*; as has been said by them—The sounds sow the seed in the *Buddhi*, along with the last articulation, and when this seed has developed by repetition, the *Śabda* becomes cognised’,—(*g*) According to *Vindhyavāsin*, *Śabda* consists in ‘similarity—(*h*) According to the *Bauddhas* what expresses the meaning consists in the ‘exclusion of others’, called ‘*Āpoha* of others’.

If what the Buddhist seeks to prove is the ‘non-eternality’ of these eight kinds of ‘Śabda’—as postulated by the *Sāṅkhya* and others,—then the ‘Subject’ becomes open to the defect of being futile, which is expressed in its own form; as such ‘Subject’ has been rejected by us. Nor do the *Mīmāṃsakas* wish to prove the eternality of such *Śabda* as these.

Further, any such ‘subject’ as *Śabda* in the particular forms of the Three-Attribute entity’ and the rest is not admitted or known, so far as we are concerned; hence the ‘subject’ becomes open to the charge of having its exact nature unknown. The Probans or Reason also, on that same account, becomes one whose substratum (in the shape of the *Subject* or Minor Term) is not *admitted* or *known*; and any such ‘subject’ is not admitted at all.—(2310-2312)

## Note on verse 2311:

Text 2311 presents what may be regarded as a ‘literary curiosity’. Here we have a quotation from the *Ślokāvartika*—Chapter on *Śabdanityātā, Śloka* 319. *Kamalaśila* says, this represents the view of the *Śikṣā* that ‘the Śabda consists of Air and is *inexpressive*’; the reading in the quotation being ‘*vāyurūpamavācakam*’. The reading in the *Ślokavārtika* itself, however, is ‘*vāyurūpo’rthavācakaḥ*’, which makes the *Śabda*, ‘*arthavācaka*’, *expressive* of meaning. The *Nyāyaratnākara* says this is the view of the *Śikṣā*—One or the other—*Tattvasaṅgraha* and its Commentary on the one hand, and *Ślokavārtika* and its Commentary on the other, must be wrong; both cannot be right, as representing the view of the *Śikṣā* Pāṇini’s *Śikṣā* does not help to solve the riddle,—On the face of it, the reading adopted in the *Tattvasangraha* appears to be wrong; as the subject-matter of the whole discussion is the *expressive Śabda*, not that which is *inexpressive*.
