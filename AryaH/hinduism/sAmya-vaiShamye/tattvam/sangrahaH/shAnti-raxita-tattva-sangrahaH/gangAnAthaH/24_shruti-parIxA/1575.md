> There is nothing strange in the fact that people, whose intelligence has been dulled by the constant contemplation of the Veda, prompted by false attachment, have failed to detect the sources of falsity (in the Veda). The Pārasīka people who are addicted to the practice do not perceive anything wrong in the remarriage of their mothers.—(2446-2447)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under 2114 that—“When people who have been intent upon the study, the retention and the exposition of the Veda and in the performance of acts enjoined therein, have not been able to detect any grounds of falsity, how can they be detected by persons who have kept themselves aloof from it?”—

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2446-2447 above*]

The compound is to be expounded as—‘those who have been *jadākṛta*— dulled—by the contemplation of the Veda which has been prompted by false attachment.’

‘*Ādhyāna*’ is constant contemplation or pondering.

On account of these, false attachment, etc. they do not perceive the defect, even though it is there. As for example, the *Pārasīka* people see nothing wrong in the marriage of their mothers. So there is nothing strange in what has been urged by the *Mīmāṃsaka*—(2446-2447)
