> “‘Words, without some order, have never been, known to be expressive; hence it is the order (or arrangement) which should be regarded as the word. for those people alone, according to whom the word is something different from the letters, and devoid of any order of sequence (or arrangement), can the assumption of the eternality of words have any use—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 282-283].—(2282-2283)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be urged that—the Letters themselves, without any order, as they become heard by the Ear, would express the meaning.

The Opponent’s answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2282-2283 above*]

The Letters themselves, without any order, have never been found to be expressive of meanings; hence a definite order or arrangement of Letters has got to be admitted. Under the circumstances, it is the *order* that comes to be the *Word*, and also *expressive*,—for you, *Mīmāṃsakas*; and all this character cannot belong to the Letters themselves.

This *Order*, however, is something non-eternal; hence what is *expressive* must also be non-eternal; hence the assumption of the eternality of Words is absolutely futile. Because what is desired by you is to prove the eternality of only that Word which is *expressive*,—not of any other; hence the proofs that you adduce in support of the Letters only are of no use in the matter under consideration; because the mere Letters are not *expressive*;—then as regards what is *expressive*, i.e. the order or arrangement of the Letters,—it is not regarded as eternal; hence all your effort is futile.

There are some people,—e.g. the Grammarians,—who regard the *Sphoṭa*, which is an impartite entity as a whole, apart from the Letters, to, be *expressive*;—for these people alone the assumption of the eternality of the Word can have any use; because the said entity ‘*Spoṭa*’ is eternal.—(2282-2283)

To the above arguments of the Opponent’, the *Mīmāṃsaka* offers the following reply:—[*see verse 2284 next*]
