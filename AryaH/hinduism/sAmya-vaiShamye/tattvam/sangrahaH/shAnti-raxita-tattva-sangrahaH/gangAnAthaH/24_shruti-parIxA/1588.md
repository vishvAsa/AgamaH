> In reality, there can be no relationship between the word and its meaning; (*a*) because there is difference between them,—and (*b*) because one is not born from the other. The relationship has only been imposed by people under an illusion.—That this is so has been explained in detail already. In fact, the whole position of the word and its meaning is highly complicated; as there is no invariable concomitance between them.—(2470-2471)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“Why is it said that it is the *common man* that thinks so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2470-2471 above*]

‘*Because there is difference*’;—this precludes the relationship of *Identity*;—‘*became one is not born from the other*’;—this precludes the relationship of Cause and Effect—Apart from these, there is no other relationship possible,—and without such a relationship, there can be no restriction regarding the Word expressing a definite meaning if there were, there would be incongruities.—For these reasons, the connection between the Word and its meaning must be regarded as *imposed* upon them; as has been explained before, in the section dealing with ‘Apoha’, the ‘Exclusion, of others’,—(2470-2471)
