> ‘The requisite capacity does not belong to the denoter (word) and the denoted (meaning), by themselves; the idea that people derive prom words is due to convention;—just as in the case of the winking of the eye.’—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra*, 12].—(2253)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2252*]:

The following *Text* sums up the *Mīmāṃsaka’s* position;—[*see verse 2252 above*]

In the following *Text*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* sets forth the view opposed to his own—[*see verse 2253 above*]

[*verse 2253*]:

As between the Denotative Word and the Denoted meaning, there is no such capacity inherent in their very nature, by virtue of which one is *denotative* and the other *denoted*.

*Question*:—How then is any idea deduced from the Word?

*Answer*:—‘*The idea that people, etc. etc*’—When the causal potency of something is such that it stands in need of Convention, then that cannot be its natural potency or capacity;—for example, some idea is derived from the *winking of the Eye*;—the causal potency of the Word in bringing about the notion of its meaning is dependent upon Convention;—hence here we find something contrary to a wider term.

What the Opponent does here is to refute the objections that have been urged by the *Mīmāṃsaka* against the conclusion that ‘Words are not-eternal’.—(2253)

The answer to the above (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*) is as follows:—[*see verses 2254-2255 next*]
