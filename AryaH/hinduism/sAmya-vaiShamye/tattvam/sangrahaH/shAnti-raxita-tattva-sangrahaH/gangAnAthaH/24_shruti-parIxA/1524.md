> The Veda, as it stands, provides no knowledge to us, until it is illuminated (explained) by persons who act as lamps. Consequently there is no reason for the assumption that what brings about the knowledge of things is something which is not the work of a person; because the knowledge in question does proceed from the explanations provided by persons. Thus the character of not being the work of a person, even though it may be present in the veda, is of no use; because the only result produced by the Veda—i.e. knowledge—is dependent upon persons.—(2366-2368)



## Kamalaśīla

The idea that the Veda is not the work of a Person is postulated for the purpose of showing that the knowledge provided by it must be right;—this assumption also is not independent of personalities in providing that knowledge,—hence the assumption is entirely futile. In fact, the Persons, as authors of the Veda, might very well be the reliable source of right knowledge,—what is the use of assuming this *independence of Personalities*, which, after all, is itself dependent on personalities?—(2365-2368)
