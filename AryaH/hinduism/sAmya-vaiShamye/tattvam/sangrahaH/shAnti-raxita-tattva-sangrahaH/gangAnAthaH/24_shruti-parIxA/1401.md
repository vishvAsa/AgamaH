> Under the view that the auditory organ consists of *ākāśa*, as the organ would be all-pervading, it would be equally in contact with all things; so that even when the sound is produced ear off, it should be heard here.—In this way the auditory organ also would be one only for all living beings; hence at the time that one person hears a sound, all men should hear it.—(2161-2162)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* Opponent now sets forth objections against the view that the embellishment pertains to the Sense-organ [the second alternative view suggested under *Texts* 2156-2157, regarding the variations of Sound being due to embellishments, in the shape of the conjunctions and disjunctions of Sound]—[*see verses 2161-2162 above*]

There are some people who hold that the Auditory Organ consists of *Ākāśa*; under this view, as *Ākāśa* is one and all-pervading, it would be in equal contact with all Sounds, and hence it should be possible to hear Sounds at a distance also.—The Auditory Organ also would be one and the same for all living beings; hence when one of them hears a sound, that sound should be heard by all of them; because the Auditory Organ is one and the same for all. It should be added also that if one man does not hear a Sound, no man should hear it.—(2161-2162)
