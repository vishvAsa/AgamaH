> “The individual letter ‘*ga*’ has no existence apart from the substratum of the universal ‘*ga*’,—because it can never be apprehended by any cognition other than that of ‘*ga*’,—just like the universal ‘*ga*’ postulated by the other party.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa*, 32]—(2143)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—What is *recognised* is only the *Universal aspect* of the Letter ‘*ga*’,—not the individual aspect; how can there be said to be a *recognition* of the Individuals?

The answer (of the *Mīmāṃsaka*) to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2143 above*]

‘*Gānyabudāhyanirūpyatvāt*’—Because it is not apprehended—cognised—by any cognition except that of the letter ‘*Ga*’.

‘*Like the Universal*, *etc. etc*.’—Because the view of the other party is that ‘*Universals* are without universals’.—(2143)
