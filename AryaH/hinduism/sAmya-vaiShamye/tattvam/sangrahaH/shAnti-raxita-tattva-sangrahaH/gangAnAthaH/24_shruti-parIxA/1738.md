> The *ākāśa* and the ‘destruction’ do not ‘follow from effort’,—as they are entirely devoid of character. what form the basis of the idea of these are: (1) the potsherds, (2) the mass of light and so forth.—(2750)



## Kamalaśīla

Even if these were of the nature of ‘Destruction’,—there is no ‘falsity’ or ‘Inconclusiveness’ in our Reason.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verse 2750 above*]

‘*Prayatnā*, *etc*. *etc*.’—This compound is to be construed with ‘*na*’.

“Why?”

‘*Because they are entirely devoid of character*’,—Because ‘Destruction’ consists merely in the *negation of the existence* of things,—and ‘*Ākāśa*’ consists merely in the *negation of Tangibility*; hence both these—*Ākāśa* and Destruction,—are *devoid of character*, featureless. How then can they be *following after effort*? As it is only *character* that can be capable of effective action.

*Question*:—“What then is the basis of the idea of the Destruction, etc.?”

*Answer*:—‘*The pieces*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*mass of light*’; ‘*and so forth*’ includes *mass of darkness* also.—(2750)
