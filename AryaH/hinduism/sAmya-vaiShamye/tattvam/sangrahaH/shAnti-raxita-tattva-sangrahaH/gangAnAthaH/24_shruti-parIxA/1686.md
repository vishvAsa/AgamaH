> When there is need for the convention, why are you seeking to bolster up, without reason, the ‘relationship’ in the shape of the eternal potency?—In the matter of expressing the meaning, there is not found, apart from convention, any operation of such a full-fledged entity as the ‘relationship’.—(2661-2662)



## Kamalaśīla

If the Relationship, by its mere presence, were the cause of the cognition of the meaning, then, there would be such cognition even in a man who is ignorant of the Convention. Hence the need of Convention must be admitted. That being so, it being admitted that Convention is a means of comprehending the meaning,—why is any such thing bolstered up as a full-fledged entity in the shape of the eternal Relationship,—without any reason? Because the function of the Relationship would lie in the bringing about of the comprehension of the meaning; and if this is brought about by Convention, what is the use of assuming an eternal Relationship?—It has also been explained hundreds of times that being eternal, it cannot have any peculiar feature imposed upon it; and hence it cannot need the help of anything else.

If causal efficiency is attributed to a thing which has never been found to be efficient,—then why cannot it be assumed that on obtaining the *Harītakī*, the Celestial Beings would have their bowels moved?—(2661-2662)
