> The idea that there appears in regard to word-sounds is found to be mostly divergent; as it is often cognised in such forms as ‘this is spoken by the parrot’ and ‘this other is spoken by the Śārikā’,—if it is said that “this is due to the diversity of the manifesters of the sounds”,—then, we shall state the reasons for rejecting this idea of the ‘manifestation’ (of sounds). On this ground alone, all this would be one and the same. Hence there can be no manifester, and no manifested. Because when the thing is one and indivisible, that fact precludes all notions of diversity.—Further, there can be no determination, based upon recognition, that ‘these words are human’ and ‘those others are not uttered by men—(2449-2452)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even *Recognition* is not found to be present in the same form in all cases.—This is what is pointed out in the following:—[*see verses 2449-2452 above*]

When certain word-sounds are uttered by birds,—like the Parrot, the *Śārikā* and the like,—there is always the notion of diversity, as that ‘this is uttered by the Parrot’, ‘that by the *Śārikā*’ and so forth; hence Recognition (Word-Sound) does not appear in all cases.

It might be argued that—“this notion of diversity, in regard to the utterances of the Parrot, etc. is due to the diversity among the manifesting agencies”;—that is nothing; because the very idea of the ‘manifesting agency’ is going to be discarded.

This is what is said in the words—‘*Soyam, etc, etc*.’—‘*Soyam*’ stands for the divergent notion.

Then again, even if the diversity in the Word were held to be based upon the diversity in the manifesters,—and not upon the Word itself,—then, there would be no confidence at all. This is the contingency that is indicated in the words—‘*On this ground alone, etc. etc*.’—‘*all this*’—i.e. the entire universe.

“Let that be so; what then?.”

*Answer*—‘*Hence there can be, etc. etc*.’—There could be no ideas of difference, such as ‘this is the *manifester*’ and ‘that the *manifested*’, which is based upon diversity;—as there is no difference at all. For example, ‘these words are human’ and ‘those others, like *Śanno devīḥ, etc*. are not human’,—all such notions would not be possible for you who are so devoted to *Recognition*; as there is no distinction at all.—(2449-2452)
