> “‘Being perceived as following from effort’ has been adduced as a reason for the word being a product and noneternal. This is ‘inconclusive in view of certain things that are not-momentary;—such as the three things: (1) conscious destruction, (2) unconscious destruction, and (3) *ākāśa*: (1) when the destruction of things is brought about intentionally, it is regarded as ‘conscious destruction’;—(2) when destruction is not brought about intentionally, it is ‘unconscious destruction’;—both these, being ‘imperishable’, have been regarded (by the Bauddha) as ‘uncaused’ also.”—[see ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 22-23]—(2322-2324)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Next the *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to point out the ‘Inconclusive’ character of another Probans cited by the Opponent—‘Because it is invariably concomitant with effort’.—[*see verses 2322-2324 above*]

What is meant by ‘*Prayatnānantarīyatva*’ is the character of *being perceived as following after an effort*.—And as this character is present in cases where the Probandum is absent, the said character, adduced as the Probans, for proving that Words are *products* and *non-eternal*, is ‘Inconclusive’, For instance, the Buddhists postulate (1) ‘Conscious Destruction’, (2) ‘Unconscious Destruction’, and (3) ‘*Ākāśa*’ as three entities which are unmodifiable and *not-momentary*, i.e. eternal. And yet, the Probans in question (‘being perceived as following after effort’) is found in these also.

This is what is pointed out by the words—‘*when the destruction, etc*. *etc*.’—that destruction of things like the Jar which is brought about intentionally, is called ‘Conscious Destruction’; while that which is not intentional, is ‘Unconscious Destruction’; such is the scheme of the Buddhists.

‘*Teṣām*’—of things like the Jar.

‘*Tau ca*’—i.e. the Conscious and Unconscious Destructions.

‘*Uncaused also*’;—‘also’ includes ‘non-eternal—(2322-2324)

How these two Destructions are ‘uncaused’ and ‘eternal’ and how they subsist in the Probans,—is pointed out in the following Texts,—from the point of view of the Opponent (*Bauddha*):—[*see verses 2325-2328 next*]
