> “If the relationship in question were artificial (set up for the occasion), then, as the particular use will have become accomplished and come to an end,—it would be applicable to that one particular case only, and would not be universal in its application. In the cow there is a commingling of several factors—such as the ‘earth’, ‘substance’, ‘being’, ‘tail’ and so forth,—there could be no definite idea of the ‘cow’ except through frequent repeated usage.—From this it follows that the word is not-artificial; and it never perishes,—because it has an eternal relationship with an eternal entity—like the ākāśa and the atom,”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 359-361].—(2133-2135)



## Kamalaśīla

Again, the *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to show that the Proposition that ‘Words are non-eternal’ is annulled by Inference and Presumption.—The Inference that he sets forth is—“When the relation between two things is *not-artificial* (eternal), the two things themselves must be regarded as *not-artificial* (eternal) e.g. *Ākāśa* and the *Atom*;—and the relation of *Denoter and Denoted* between the *Word* and its denotation in the form of the ‘Universal’ is not-artificial;—hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.”

In the following *Texts* the *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to show that the Reason here adduced (that the relation between the Word and its Denotation *is eternal*) is not ‘inadmissible’:—[*see verses 2133-2135 above*]

The sense requires the reading ‘*kṛtrimatve ca sambandhasya*’.

If the Relationship were artificial, then,—inasmuch as the particular use will have been accomplished,—come to an end,—the Word would have come to an end; hence the relationship between the Word and its meaning would not be universal—i.e. applicable to all uses of the Word at all times.—Why?—Because it would he applicable to that one particular case only; i.e. it would apply to one particular Cow only. In support of this a Presumption is put forward—When several Cows are there before one. even though the Universal ‘Cow’ may be subsisting in a single individual Cow, what is understood is the universal ‘Cow’ as extracted from the word ‘Cow’; and this would not be possible if the Word were not there.—Why it would not be possible is explained in the Words—‘*There is a commingling of several factors*, *etc. etc*.’—This Presumption is based upon the authority of Words.

‘*For these reasons Word cannot be artificial*’.—This sums up the Inference.

‘*With an eternal entity*’—*i.e*. the object named ‘Universal’, ‘Community—‘*Eternal relationship*’—which lasts for all time; just like the relationship of Atoms with *Ākāśa*, which is eternal.—(2133-2135)

The following *texts* reject the ‘Inconclusiveness’ of the above Presumption:—[*see verses 2136-2138 next*]
