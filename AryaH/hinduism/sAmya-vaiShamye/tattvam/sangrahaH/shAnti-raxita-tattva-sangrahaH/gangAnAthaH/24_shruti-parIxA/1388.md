> “Even when there is diversity in the pronunciation being fast, etc., the individual letter ‘*ga*’ is not clearly cognised as an established entity, distinguished from the other individual letter ‘*ga*’.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa*, 22].—(2142)



## Kamalaśīla

*Objection*:—Diversity of the Letters is proved by such diversities in their pronouncing as *fast, middling*, *slow* and so forth; under the circumstances, how can it be said that their Recognition as being the same is clear and distinct?

The *Answer* to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2142 above*]

‘*Established*’—not merely conceived or fancied.

‘*Distinguished*’—distinct, separate, different.

‘*Ga-vayakti*’—stands for ‘*gakāravyakti*’, the Individual letter-sound ‘*ga*’.

What is meant is that Recognition having established the identity among the individuals, there can be no ‘other’ Individual at all.—(2142)
