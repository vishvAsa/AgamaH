> Further, the auditory organ, once embellished, should bring about the cognition of all sounds; when the eye is opened for seeing the jar, it does not fail to apprehend the cloth.—this same contingency may be urged also in connection with the remembrance of the thing (sound); as the embellishment appertains, without distinction, to the same space in *ākāśa*.—(2164-2165)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, once embellished,—the Auditory Organ should lead to the Cognition of all Sounds,—make them apprehended; as the said Organ would apply in common to all Sounds; and also because the Sounds, being all-pervasive, would be occupying the same perceptible place.

It might be argued that—it is for the purpose of cognition that the Speaker has embellished the auditory organ of the Hearer; consequently the organ would bring about the cognition of that same Sound, not others

The answer to this is—‘*When the eye is opened*, *etc*. *etc*.’—‘It does not fail to apprehend’—i.e. it does apprehend; that is, on account of the perceptibility of the place being equal.

*Question*:—Why has the word ‘all’ been introduced?

*Answer*;—‘As *the embellishment appertains, etc. etc*.’—All Sounds, being all-pervading in character, occupy the same space in *Ākāśa*; hence their embellishment also should be without distinction.

In some places, the reading is ‘*saṃskāro hyaviśeṣataḥ* In that ease the particle ‘*hi*’ stands for ‘because’;—‘*aviśeṣataḥ*’ stands for ‘*aviśeṣeṇa*’; hence the meaning comes to be—Because the embellishment has been produced in Sounds without distinction,—on account of their occupying the same space,—therefore it should be possible for *all* Sounds to be apprehended (at the same time).—(2164-2165)
