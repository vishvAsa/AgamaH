> Because its form was revealed by him, therefore the words are called ‘of the Buddha’. the remembrance of the author that is there may also be regarded as merely commendatory.—It might be said that—“This is not so accepted by the other party”;—but if the reason is equally applicable, why cannot it be accepted?—or, it may not be accepted by the other party; even so, it may be regarded as possible, in accordance with reason.—(2791-2792)



## Kamalaśīla

Its form—character, nature,—has been revealed by *Buddha*.

In this case also, the idea that people have regarding the author of the Buddhist Scripture may be explained as purely commendatory. And here also ‘author’ may be explained as ‘rememberer’.

The following might be urged—“The Buddhists do not accept the view that the idea of the authorship of Buddha is purely commendatory,—hence why should you base your argument on this?”

*Answer*:—‘*The Reason being equally applicable* (to *Mahābhārata* and the Buddhist Scripture), etc. etc.’—If the idea is in accord with Reason, then why should the Buddhist not accept it? It is not right for intelligent men not to accept what is in accordance with reason.

Even if the intelligent Buddhist does not accept this idea,—we still put this to you purely on the ground of reason.—(2791-2792)

This idea is confirmed by the words of the *Mīmāṃsaka* himself.—[*see verses 2793-2795 next*]
