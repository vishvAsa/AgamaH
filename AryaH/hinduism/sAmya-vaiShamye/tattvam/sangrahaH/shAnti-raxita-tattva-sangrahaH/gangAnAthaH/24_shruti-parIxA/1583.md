> If the one-ness of the letters *ga*, etc. that is urged as an; undesirable contingency, is in reference to the ‘universal aspect’, then the argument is superfluous; because the aspect of ‘exclusion of the unlike’ is already postulated by us as one and the same in all individuals.—If the individuals themselves were, urged to be one and the same, then the reason would be ‘inconclusive’; because the multiplicity of the individual letter has been definitely recognised, in every use of them, by means of sense-perception, etc.—(2460-2461)



## Kamalaśīla

Five arguments have been set forth (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*) under *Texts* 2121 *et seq*.;—if what is meant to be proved by these is the one-ness of the ‘Universal’ in the shape of the ‘exclusion of others’, then they are superfluous, as proving what is already admitted by the other party; as a matter of fact, on the basis of the single uniform notion that people have in regard to all Individuals, the one ‘Universal’, in the shape of the ‘exclusion of others’, is admitted (by us).

If, on the other hand, what is meant to be proved is the one-ness of the Individuals themselves, in the form of their *Specific Individualities*; then the Premiss would be one that is contrary to and annulled by Perception and. Inference; and this would make all the Reasons ‘Inconclusive’,

‘*By means of Sense-perception*, *etc. etc*:—‘*Ākṣa*’ is *pertaining to ‘akṣa*’, *sense-organ*. ‘*Etc*.’ includes *Inference*. The Plural number is in view of the large number of individual Perceptions and Inferences.—(2460-2461)
