> “Space is one and all-pervading, and extends as far as ākāśa; when it becomes limited within the cavity of the ear, it forms the auditory organ,—in the same way as *ākāśa* does (for the other party).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 152-153].—(2201)



## Kamalaśīla

The ‘all-pervading character’ is explained by the phrase ‘*it extends as far as Ākāśa*’.

*Objection*:—If this is so, then, there can be no ‘deafness’, etc.

*Answer*:—‘*When it becomes limited*, *etc. etc*.’—The entire Space is not the Auditory Organ; it is only that much of Space as is encased within the ear-cavity.—(2201)
