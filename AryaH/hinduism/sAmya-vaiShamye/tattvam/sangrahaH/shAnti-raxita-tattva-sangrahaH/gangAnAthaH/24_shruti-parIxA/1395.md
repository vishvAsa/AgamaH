> “Those who have their minds perverted by the disorders of bile perceive the sweet as bitter, and white as yellow;—those who are running east, or sailing in a boat, mistake the hill and other objects to be moving; those who have applied the fat of the frog to their eyes mistake the piece of bamboo to be a serpent.—In the same manner, through the higher and lower intensities of the individuals, people have the idea of the universal as being the substratum of those intensities.—Just as, in the cases cited, people have the ideas (of bitterness, etc.) without having any perception of their causes (in the shape of the disordered bile, etc.)—So, in the case in question, without cognising the varying degrees of pitch in the manifester, there would be a mistaken idea of these in connection with the manifested.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa*, 41-44].—(2150-2153)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent:—The varying degrees of Pitch resides according to you, in the *Manifester*, not in the *Manifested* (Sound); these degrees therefore would be unapprehended because the *Manifester* itself is not apprehended; under the circumstances, without apprehending the degrees of Pitch in the *Manifester* how could one attribute it to the Word-Sound? Until the Water has been apprehended, it is not attributed to—imposed upon—the Mirage?

The answer to this (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*) is as follows:—[*see verses 2150-2153 above*]

Through the disorders of Bile, people apprehend the sweet thing as bitter, without having any idea of the character of the Bile;—similarly while running fast or sailing fast on a boat, people are led to the mistaken notion of the Hill and other objects moving along;—similarly when one applies the fat of the frog to his eyes, he perceives bamboo-pieces as serpents;—similarly, through the varying degrees of intensity in the Individuals, people have the idea of the Universal as being the substratum of those degrees; ‘Being’ being the largest, highest, Universal, and the ‘Cow’ and the like being the lesser, smaller, Universal.—If it were not so, then, *being eternal* and *all-pervasive*, all Universal would be equal; and in that case to what could the ‘largeness’ or ‘smallness’ of the Universal be due?—Hence the conclusion is that—just as people have the notion of Bitter in connection with the Sweet thing, without having any notion of the Bile to which the misconception is due,—so also, in the case in question, without apprehending the larger or smaller intensity in the *Manifested*, people would have the misconception of these in connection with the *manifested* Sound.

‘*Abudhvā*’, ‘*without cognising*’;—the sequence of the nominative agent is in reference to the action of ‘misconception’; otherwise the Past participial affix ‘*Ktvā*’ would not be possible.—(2150-2153)
