## Kamalaśīla

*Kumārila* has put forward another argument in support of the eternality of the Connection between Word and its meaning; and it is pointed out in the following *Text* that that argument is invalidated as ‘Inconclusive’, with a view to such works composed by men as Stories, Dramas and the like:—[*see verse 2776 above*]

‘*Original stories*, *etc*.’—those whose subject-matter is entirely new.

‘*Said character*,’—e.g. that of being composed by the mere whim of man.—(2776)

*Question*;—“What is it that has been said by the other party?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2778-2779 next*]
