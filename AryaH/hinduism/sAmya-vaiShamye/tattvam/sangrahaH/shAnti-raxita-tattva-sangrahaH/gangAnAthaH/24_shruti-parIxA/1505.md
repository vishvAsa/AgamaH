> “Ākāśa also, being eternal,—when surrounded by earth and by water,—becomes manifested (rendered perceptible) by the removal of these by means of digging and pumping out; so that here also there is apprehension of ākāśa following after an effort; consequently the probans urged in connection with word becomes ‘inconclusive’.”—(*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 30-32].—(2330-2331)



## Kamalaśīla

It was asserted (under *Text* 2322) that the Probans is shown to be ‘Inconclusive’ in view of three factors. Inconclusiveness due to *two* factors has been shown,—in the shape of the two kinds of Destruction; that due to the third factor of ‘*Ākāśa*’ is next pointed out:—[*see verses 2330-2331 above*]

‘*By the removal of these*’—The removal of the Earth by digging with the ispade, etc.

‘*Tatra*’—in regard to the Word-sound.

‘*Darśanam*’—i.e. apprehension following from effort.—(2330-2331)
