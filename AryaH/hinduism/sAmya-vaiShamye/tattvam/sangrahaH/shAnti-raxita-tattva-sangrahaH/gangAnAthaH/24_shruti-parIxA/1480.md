> “Thus then, even though the order is not something unchangeable (and eternal in that sense), yet it is eternal, in usage. and we have to make an effort to refute the idea of men being independent (in their choice of the order of letters used).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 289-290].—(2288)



## Kamalaśīla

The argument is summed up by the *Mīmāṃsaka* in the following:—[*see verse 2288 above*]

‘*Naḥ*’—the Genitive ending is due to the verbal affix found in ‘*pratiṣedhyā*’,

The objection that has been urged is therefore not applicable.

Thus though the Order is not eternal in the sense of being *unchangeable*, like the Hill,—yet its eternality has to be accepted on the basis of the usage of experienced persons.

What this means is that the Order is eternal for all practical purposes,—and not *unchangeably* eternal, like the Hills.—(2288)

*Question*:—If that is so in the case of the Order, why is not the ‘eternality’ of the Letters also regarded as being for practical purposes only?

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2289-2290 next*]
