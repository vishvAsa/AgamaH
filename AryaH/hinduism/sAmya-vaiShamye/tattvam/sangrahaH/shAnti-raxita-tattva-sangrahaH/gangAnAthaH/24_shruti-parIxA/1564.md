> If ‘eternality’ is what is meant by being not produced and being not destroyed,—then, inasmuch as both would be of the nature of mere negation,—the same may be said regarding the non-entity also. consequently, just as the eternality of the ‘sky-lotus’ is not real, in the same way the reliability of the Veda also does not become established.—(2431-2432)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been urged above by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under the *Text* 2105, that—“*Eternality* is what is meant by the two characters of *being not produced* and *being not destroyed*, and both these being of the nature of Negation, do not require any proof for themselves”.

The Buddhist’s answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2431-2432 above*]

There are two assumptions here—(1) that eternality is asserted on the basis of the two characters of *being not produced* and *being not destroyed*, which are of the nature of *absolute negation*,—and (2) that these latter are of the nature of *Relative Negation*;—under the former view (1) the Reason being ‘inconclusive’ (doubtful) in view of the ‘Sky-lotus’, the ‘eternality’ of the Veda does not become established as a *real* entity; because in the case of the ‘Sky-lotus’, though both the said characters of *being produced* and *being destroyed* are denied,—yet its *eternality* does not become established as a *real* entity; the same happens in the case of the Veda; hence the Reason is ‘Inconclusive’; and from this it would follow that, as in the *Sky lotus*, so in the Veda also, there would he no *reliability*.—(2431-2432)
