> If certain proofs are adduced in support of the view that there is an author of the Vedas,—if these proofs are refuted, it does not necessarily follow that there is no such author. In fact on the refutation of the proof of his existence, what follows is that there is no certainty regarding his existence; similarly the mere setting aside of the idea of his existence is not enough to bring about any certainty at all.—As a matter of fact, even on the cessation of the means of cognition, there is no certainty regarding the nonexistence of the thing concerned; hence all that it can prove is that there is no certainty regarding either of the two views.—(2426-2428)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued under *Text* 2100, that—“when the proofs adduced to prove the existence of such an Author are refuted, the absence of such a one follows as a matter of course”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2426-2428 above*]

When a certain proof is adduced for the purpose of bringing. about certainty regarding a certain thing,—if that proof is refuted,—all that will

follow would be that there would be no certainty relating to it; it would not follow that the thing itself does not exist. Because on the cessation of the *Means* of Cognition, the *object* of Cognition does not cease,—as has been explained above—on the basis of its being the *Means* or the *Pervader*.

‘*Aste*’—on being refuted.

All that can be asserted with reason is that ‘neither of the two views is proved’; the particle ‘*iti*’ has to be added, after ‘*nāsti*—(2426-2428)

The same idea is further strengthened by means of an example:—[*see verse 2429 next*]
