> “The idea of diversity due to diversity of place is inferential; while the idea that ‘it is the same’ is perceptional,—and hence annuls the former.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 197-198].—(2226)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—When the images are actually perceived in diverse places, why should they not be *several*? That is to say, when the *diversity* of images is admitted on the ground of their being perceived in diverse places,—how can this diversity be set aside by the single Cognition (by which they are all apprehended)?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2226 above*]

‘*It annuls the former*’;—because Perception is superior in authority to all means and forms of Cognition.—(2226)
