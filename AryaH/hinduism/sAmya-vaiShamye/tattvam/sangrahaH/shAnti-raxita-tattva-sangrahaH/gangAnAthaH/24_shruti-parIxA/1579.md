> As a matter of fact, the order of sequence in the manifesting agencies, palate and other speech-centres—is something that appertains to men; hence it is possible that it may be otherwise.—(2454)



## Kamalaśīla

That the words always appear in the same order cannot be admitted; because the order in the words is held to be due to the order in the *manifesters*; and tills order in the *manifesters*—i.e. in the Palate and other speech-centres,—is dependent upon the whim of man, and hence cannot be fixed; as there can be no restraint on the whim of man. Consequently, there is no reasonable ground for believing that in any set of words—‘*Śanno devīḥ, etc*.’—the order has been and is going to be always the same; hence it is just possible that the order may he otherwise also.—(2454)
