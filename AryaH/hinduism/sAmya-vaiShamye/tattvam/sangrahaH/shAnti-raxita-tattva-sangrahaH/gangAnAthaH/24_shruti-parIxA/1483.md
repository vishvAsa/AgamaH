> “Just as in the case of the jar and such things, their use is characterised (and indicated) by the ‘universal’;—so in the same manner, the order or arrangement (of the letters) would become characterised and indicated through the ‘universal’.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 295].—(2292)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Just as in the case of the Jar, etc., even though they are non-eternal, yet their use is indicated by the ‘Universal’,—so, in the same way, even though the particular arrangement of the Letters may be non-eternal, their use could be determined and explained.—(2292)

How the *use* could be determined and indicated is next explained:—[*see verses 2293-2294 next*]
