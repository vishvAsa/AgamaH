> “The reasons that the vaiśeṣika can adduce in support of the view that the auditory organ is a part of *ākāśa*, will apply equally well to the idea of its being a part of space; with this difference that the latter idea has the support of the Veda.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words—153-154].—(2202)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—Space being without parts, how do you secure the division of its parts (which the foregoing explanation implies)?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2202 above*]

In the ease of *Ākāśa*, there is an assumption of parts, on the basis of the objects with which it comes into contact; the same would be the case with *Space* also.

*Question*:—What then is the difference between this view and the other one under which the Auditory Organ consists of *Ākāśa*?

*Answer*:—‘*With this difference, etc. etc*.’—(2202)
