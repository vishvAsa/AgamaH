> All these cognitions of the letter ‘*ga*’ which appeared yesterday and today, etc. appearing in succession, cannot envisage one and the same thing,—like the cognitions of taste, colour, etc.—Thus the ‘one letter’ is not something ‘admitted by both parties hence the ‘eternality’ that has been assumed appertains to the postulated ‘exclusion of others’.—(2484-2485)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2145, that—“The entity in the form of the *Letter* is admitted by both parties, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2484-2485 above*]

The term ‘*uditā*’ is construed here also, with the endings changed.

Thus then, on account of the diversity of Words being annulled by Perception and Inference, there is no single entity in the shape of the ‘Letter’; hence the *eternality* that has been assumed can Only belong to the assumed ‘exclusion of others’,—the idea of *one-ness* being due to the similarity of the conception.—(2484-2485)
