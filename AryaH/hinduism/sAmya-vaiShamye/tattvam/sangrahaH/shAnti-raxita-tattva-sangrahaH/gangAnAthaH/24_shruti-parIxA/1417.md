> “Even if the embellishment affects the organ itself,—as it could affect the organ only through its substratum, that organ of which the ear-drum has not been embellished would not catch the sound.”—[*Śokavārtika*—eternality of words, 69-70].—(2186)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* explains that the said objections do not apply even if the embellishment is regarded as affecting the Auditory Organ itself:—[*see verse 2186 above*]

‘*Substratum*’—the Ear-drum; it is through this Ear-drum that there is embellishment of the Auditory Organ,—not by itself. It is for this reason that in the case of persons at a distance, or with mind preoccupied, or asleep or in a swoon,—Sound is not heard, because the substratum of the orgaṇ has not been embellished.

The compound ‘*asaṃshṛta*, *etc. etc*.’ is to be explained as ‘that organ of which the Ear-drum has not been embellished’,

In the word ‘*adhiṣṭhānadeśataḥ*’, the ‘*tasi*’-affix at the end has the sense of the *Locative*.—(2186)
