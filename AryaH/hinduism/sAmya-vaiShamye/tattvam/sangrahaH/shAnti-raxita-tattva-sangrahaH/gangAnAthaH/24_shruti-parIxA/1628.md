> Or, the air in question may be beyond the senses; even so, there would be cognition or the tangible (air),—which is neither hot nor cold,—resting on the various substances that may be in contact with it; just as there is of other airs.—(2535)



## Kamalaśīla

Even granting (for the sake of argument) that Air is beyond the senses, imperceptible,—the Author proceeds to point out defects in the Opponent’s arguments:—[*see verse 2535 above*]

‘*Tadyogaḥ*’—contact with the different air-currents;—that which has this contact is ‘*tattadyogin*’,—i.e. the substances known as ‘Water’, ‘Fire’ and ‘Earth’;—and that which is ‘*gala*’—resting, residing in these, is ‘*tattadyogigata*’;—i.e. the Air resting on Water, Fire and Earth.—The compounding is in accordance with Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* ‘*Dvītīyā-śṛṭā*, etc. etc.’—This compound qualifies ‘*spraṣṭavya*’—the tangible Air;—which is of a nature that is different from *hot* and *cold*.—There should be ‘*vit*’—Cognition—of the said Air.—‘*Just as there is of other Airs*’—i.e. of Air other than that within the body of the Speaker, which Air is held (by the Opponent) to be the *manifester* of the particular Word-Sound.—The ‘*vati*’-affix is added to the word ending in the Locative.

What is meant is that there would be cognition of the Air in question, just as there is of the air during winter, carrying with it the coolness of the snows,—of that during summer, when all the quarters are filled with the burning rays of the sun,—of that during the season which is neither hot nor cold, which is yet felt by the touch to be cool or warm.—(2535)

In the following *Text*, the Author anticipates and refutes the Opponent’s answer:—[*see verses 2536-2537 next*]
