> “Without knowing with certainty (what word expresses what) how could the user make up his mind at the outset as to which word he should use? If, on the other hand, he does know it, then it must have been known to him from before.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 247-248].—(2239)



## Kamalaśīla

The first objection applies to the view that the user does not definitely know (the Word as having a definite meaning). Under the other view, that he does know it at the time of using it,—it necessarily follows that the Word must have been known to him from before (as expressive of that meaning) which establishes its permanence. This is what is meant by the words ‘*If*, *on the other hand*, *etc*. *etc*.’—(2239)
