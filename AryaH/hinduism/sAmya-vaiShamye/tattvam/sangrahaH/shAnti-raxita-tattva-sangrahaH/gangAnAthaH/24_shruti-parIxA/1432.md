> “Just as (under the opponent’s view) the word-sound, though produced and appearing equally with regard to all men, is not heard by all, on account of the diversities of direction, place and so forth,—in the same manner, (under our view also) the sound is heard only by one whose auditory organ is embellished by the articulations made near him,—and not by persons at a distance.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words—84-86].—(2205-2206) 
>
> “Inasmuch as the idea of the production of the word-sound has been rejected,—and as no other explanation of the phenomenon (op the hearing of word-sounds) is possible, it is concluded that what is produced by the articulations is the particular embellishment.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words—126-127].—(2207) commentary.



## Kamalaśīla

[*verses 2205-2206*]:

Says the Opponent—The Sound being *one* and *all-pervading*, it must be equally related to all men; how then could there be apprehension (by some) and non-apprehension (by others) of it?

*Answer* from the *Mīmāṃsaka*:—[*see verses 2205-2206 above*]

*Question*:—How is it known that what proceeds from the Air-vibrations is the *embellishment* of the Object (Sound),—and not the *Object* itself?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2207 above*]:

[*verse 2207*]:

On the ground of *Recognition*, it has been established that Sound is *one* and *all-pervading*; hence there can be no *production* of Sound [there can be only *manifestation* of it]; and from this it is deduced, by implication, that what is produced by the articulations is the *embellishment*, not the *Word-Sound*.—(2207)
