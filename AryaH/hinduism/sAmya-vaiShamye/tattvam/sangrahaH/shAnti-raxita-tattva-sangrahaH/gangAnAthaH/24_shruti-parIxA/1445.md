> “Just as the single person, Devadatta, passing from place to place, one after the other, does not become different,—so the word-sound also does not differ (simply because it is heard in several places).”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 198-199].—(2227) 
>
> “And again, the same devadatta, whose one-ness is well known,—when seen again and again,—does not become diverse, on account of the diversity of time; similarly the word-sound does not become diverse on account of the diversity of place.”—[*Ślokavārtika*, eternality of words, 199-200].—(2228)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2227*]:

The following *text* points out that the idea that ‘it is cognised as appearing at diverse places’ is not concomitant with ‘diversity’, and hence there can be no validity attaching to it:—[*see verse 2227 above*]

‘*So the Word-Sound also does not differ*’—‘either in regard to time or to place’,—this has to be added.

Thus, the non-concomitance between the two (Diversity of Place of Appearance and Diversity of Sound) has been indicated through *spacial* non-comcomitance; next, the *Mīmāṃsaka* proceeds to point out the nonconcomitance of the two cognitions, spacial and chronological,—through chronological non-concomitance:—[*see verse 2228 above*]

[*verse 2228*]:

‘*Jñātaikatvaḥ*’—‘whose unity is well known through Recognition’.

‘*On account of the diversity in place*’;—this is by way of illustration; Sound does not become different on account of diversity of *time* either. By pointing one kind of non-concomitance, the other kinds of non-concomitance also become indicated. [That is why the *Text* has named *place* only. ]—(2228)
