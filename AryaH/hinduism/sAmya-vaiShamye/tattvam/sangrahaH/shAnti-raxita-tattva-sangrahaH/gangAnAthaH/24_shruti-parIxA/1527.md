> The Veda, by itself, without any support, cannot always make known its own meaning; in fact, it stands in need of explanations by persons,—such explanations being like the stick held by the blind man.—(2374)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“The Veda itself would make known to such a person its own meaning, without any action on the part of that Person; so that there is no mutual interdependence”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2374 above*]

When the Vedic sentence is heard by a man for the first time, it does not make known its meaning to that man, if he does not know the conventions (regarding the words and their meanings).

*Question*;—“What then does it do?”

*Answer*:—‘*It needs*, *etc. etc*.’—The compound is to be explained as—‘that which is similar to the stick held by the blind man—(2374)

*Question*:—“It may be in need of it; where is the harm?”

*Ansiver*:—[*see verse 2375 next*]
