> “It is by means of presumption;—the process being as follows:—The man perceives the word-sound, the experienced man (pronouncing the word) and the thing spoken of—through sense-perception;—the fact of the hearer having comprehended the meaning is cognised through inference from his activity; and the dual potency is cognised through the fact of the phenomenon not being capable of any other explanation;—thus it is by presumption that they recognise the relationship vouched for by the three means of cognition”—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra*, 140-141].—(2649-2651)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2649a*]:

Then again, the Potency would be *known* only when the means of knowing it would be there; as a matter of fact, however, this means is not there.—With this idea, the Author puts the following question:—[*see verse 2649a above*]:

In the following *Texts*, the Author sets forth in detail the answer from the view-point of the other party (the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verses 2649b-2651 above*]:

The following *Text* sets forth the objection to the above view:—[*see verse 2652 next*]
