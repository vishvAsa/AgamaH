## Kamalaśīla

From the above it follows that it is not right to assert as has been asserted (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2350, above) that—‘The Veda being reliable, a beginningless line of Pupils and Teachers tends to make it faultless’.

This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2378 above*]

After ‘*māne*’, we should read ‘*a-sthite*’,—(2378)

*Question*:—“Why cannot it make it faultless?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2379 next*]
