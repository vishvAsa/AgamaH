> There is no such certainty of invariable concomitance in regard to ‘the character of being spoken of as vedic study’; hence such a reason is open to the charge of its negative concomitance being doubtful.—(2784)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent:—“The Reason (Premiss) that we have put forward (under 2342),—‘because it is preceded by Vedic study’,—also comprehends all things; as the Author of the Veda has never been found”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2784 above*]

‘*Such certainty*’—as there is regarding the character of ‘being an aggregate’; because in the case of ‘being an aggregate’, its negative concomitance with the contrary of the Probandum is *not* in doubt;—as it is in the case of the other party’s reason—(‘being spoken of as *Vedic study*’).—(2784)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verses 2785-2786 next*]
