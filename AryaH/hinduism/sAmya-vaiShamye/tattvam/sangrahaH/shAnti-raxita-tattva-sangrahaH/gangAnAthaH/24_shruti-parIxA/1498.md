> “If the reason that is put forward is only amenability to the sense-organs,—then it is clearly recognised as fallacious, in view of the universal which has been established”.—[*Ślokavārtika*,—eternality of words, 343-344].—(2317)



## Kamalaśīla

So far the Proposition (of the Buddhist) that ‘Word is non-eternal’ has been criticised in detail. The *Mīmāṃsaka* now proceeds to criticise his Reason—‘Because it is perceptible by the Senses’.—[*see verse 2317 above*]

‘*Only amenability to the sense-organs*’,—without any such qualification as ‘being a *product*’ and so forth.

If the Reason (Probans) is put forward in this unqualified form, then it becomes ‘fallacious’, ‘Inconclusive’, in view of the ‘Universal’ which has been established before; because no ‘negative concomitance’ would be available (to confirm the Premiss),—(2317)
