> The universal ‘*ga*’ is not held to be something real, distinct from the letter ‘*ga*’; hence the charge of ‘futility’ is irresistible, as against the Mīmāṃsaka’s reasoning.—(2479)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2143, that—“The Individual Letter ‘*Ga*’ has no existence apart from the substratum of the-*Universal* ‘Ga’, etc. etc.”.

This argument is open to the charge of being ‘superfluous’:—this is. what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2479 above*]

‘*Iṣyate*’, ‘is held’; this is to be construed with the ‘na’ following, in the second line.—(2479)
