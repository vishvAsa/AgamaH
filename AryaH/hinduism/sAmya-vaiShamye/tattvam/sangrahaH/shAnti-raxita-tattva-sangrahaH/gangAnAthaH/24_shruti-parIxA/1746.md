> Just as the technical words like ‘*vṛddhi*’ have their meanings created by the whim of man,—so may also be regarded to be the case with words like ‘*svarga*’, ‘*yāga*’ and so forth.—In the case of such works of men as stories, dramas and novels, the connection between words and meanings is never meant to be real and eternal.—(2768-2769)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mimāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2339, that—“What is said by the Buddhist may be possible in the case of such technical terms as ‘*Vṛddhi*’ because these deal with perceptible things; but in the case of -the Veda, the idea of *conventionality* cannot be possible, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2768-2769 above*]

‘*Icchāracita*, *etc*.’—Whose meanings have been created by the wish of man.

‘*Utpādya*’—The unheard of story created by the writer,—like that of *Mahāśvetā*;—and the drama, etc. which also have the same character.—In the case of these the connection between words and their meanings is not. meant to be eternal, in the shape of an *inherent potency*. The same may be regarded to be the case with the *Veda* also.—This is the sense of the *Text*.—(2768-2769)
