## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2561*]:

The objections against the view that the Auditory Organ consists of *Space* have been already stated before; hence they are not stated again; the Author only reminds the reader of what has been said before:—[*see verse 2561 above*]

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, in *Text* 2204, that—“Even if the Embellishment pertains to the *Object*, it would affect that one object only, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—

[*verse 2562*]:

‘*Na*’—That is, it *cannot* be right to assert that “if the Embellishment pertains to the Object it would affect that one object only”.

“Why?”

‘*Because it has been discarded*’—i.e. because the Embellishment itself has been rejected.—That is, the Embellishment, as different and as not-different, has been already discarded.

For the following reason also there can be no Embellishment of the Object.

“What reason?”

*Because of the limitations of the capacity of things*.—which are going to be pointed out.

After ‘*Niyateḥ*’ a ‘*Ca*’ is understood; hence the meaning comes to be that—*also* because of the limitations of the capacity of things, there cannot be an Embellishment of the Object.—(2562)

The said ‘limitation on the capacity of things’ is illustrated—[*see verses 2563-2564 next*]
