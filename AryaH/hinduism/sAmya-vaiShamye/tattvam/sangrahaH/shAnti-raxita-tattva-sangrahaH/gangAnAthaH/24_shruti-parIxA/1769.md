> The eternality of the sentence having been rejected, the character of ‘proceeding from the eternal sentence’ is clearly recognised as non-existent in the ‘subject’ and in the corroborative instance.—Thus, then the fact of the Vedic injunction not being the work of a person being uncertain, your subsequent reasons also are open to the charge of being doubtful—hence—inadmissible.—(2802-2803)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2347, that—“The Cognition brought about by the Veda must be correct, because it proceeds from the eternal sentence, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2802-2803 above*]

Here also, as before, the Reason is ‘inadmissible’, and the Corroborative Instance is ‘devoid of the Probandum’.

The Locative ending in the term ‘*Dharmidṛṣṭāntayoḥ*’ is with reference to the ‘character of proceeding from the eternal sentence’.

‘*Vākyasya*’—is to be construed with ‘*nityatve*’; the Genitive ending denoting *relationship*’.

‘*Nityavākyodbhavatvasya*’ goes with ‘*asiddhiḥ*’.

‘*Paścimeṣu*’—the subsequent Reasons—such as ‘being produced by causes free from defects’ and so forth.—(2802-2803)
