> “For these reasons—in the production and manifestation (of word-sounds), the diversity of capacity is equally present, in the effort and the desire to speak,—such diversity being presumed on the basis of certain effects (facts) which cannot be otherwise explained.”—[*Ślokavārtika*— eternality of words, 82-83].—(2197)



## Kamalaśīla

The word ‘*utpattyabhivyaktyoḥ*’ has the Locative ending,—the meaning being—‘in the production and in the manifestation of the Word-Sound’,—there is equal diversity of capacity in the Effort and the Desire to Speak;—why?—because the fact of certain well-known effects not being otherwise explicable indicates such diversity; that is, in both cases, the Presumption based upon the said inexplicability of certain facts is equally operative.—(2197)
