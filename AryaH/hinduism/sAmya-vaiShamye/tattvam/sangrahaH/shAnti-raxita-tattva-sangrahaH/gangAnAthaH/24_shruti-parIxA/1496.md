> “If then, your ‘subject’ or ‘minor term’ consists of the *śabda* as postulated by us, then, both these fallacies become applicable to you (who do not admit of any such śabda as held by us).—If mere *śabda* (in general, without any qualification) were asserted as the ‘subject’ of your reasoning, then, it would mean that for you, the universal ‘*śabda*’ itself is non-eternal; and such a view would be contrary to the view accepted by all men that the universal is always eternal; in one form or the other, the ‘universal’ is regarded by every one as eternal”.—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 321-323].—(2313-2314)



## Kamalaśīla

We, *Mīmāṃsakas*, hold that ‘*Śabda*’ consists only in the Letters ‘Ga’ and the rest, it is not anything apart from these;—and if this is the *Śabda* which the Buddhist and others make the ‘Subject’ of their Proposition, then *both these fallacies*—the Proposition having the exact nature of its Subject unknown and the Reason having no basis—would befall them.

If mere ‘*Śabda*’ *were asserted*—i.e. as the subject of the Proposition,—then for you the universal ‘Śabda’ would itself be *non-eternal*;—the phrase ‘be non-eternal’ is to be supplied. Because the epithet ‘mere’ means the exclusion of all particular features, what else—apart from the *Universal*—could it be that would be ‘*mere Śabda*’? Thus by implication your proposition would be declaring the non-eternality of the *Universal* ‘Śabda’ itself.

‘Be it so, what then?’

That cannot be right; as ‘*such a view would be contrary*, *etc. etc*.—for instance, the Buddhists themselves, who postulate the Exclusion, ‘*Apoha*, of others’, have declared that ‘it is the *Universal* that stands’, So that the view now put forth would involve the contradiction of what has been admitted by them.

This is what is shown in the words—‘*In one form or the other, etc, etc*,’—In whatever form the ‘Universal’ has been postulated by philosophers, in accordance with their respective doctrines, it is held, by all parties, to be *eternal*. If it were not so, then, like the Individuals, each Universal, appearing after the other, would become intermingled; and the very character of the ‘Universal’ would become lost.—(2313-2314)
