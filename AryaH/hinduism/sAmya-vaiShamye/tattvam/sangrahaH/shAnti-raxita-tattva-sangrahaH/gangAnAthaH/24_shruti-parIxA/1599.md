> Under the variations of ‘fast’, ‘middling’ and ‘slow’,—the word-sound itself does not appear as different. under the circumstances, when the cognition envisages something in a form that does not belong to it,—why should not this cognition be objectless?—(2489)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“Even if the Word-sound is not the objective of the Cognition, why should the cognition be baseless (without an object)?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2489 above*]

The Cognition that appears is in the form of ‘fast’, ‘medium’ and ‘slow’;—and the Word-Sound cannot have the ‘fast’ and other forms; because being eternal and all-pervading, it must have only one form;—there is nothing else that could have the ‘fast’ and other forms, and appear in the Cognition;—hence there being no real object of the said exact form, the Cognition is clearly *objectless*.—(2489)
