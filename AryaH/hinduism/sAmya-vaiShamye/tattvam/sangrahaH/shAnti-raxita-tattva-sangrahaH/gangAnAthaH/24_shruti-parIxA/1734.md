> That which serves as the cause (basis) of the sense-perception envisaging it is spoken of as ‘amenable to sense-organ’; but what is eternal can never be a cause; this has been already established.—(2745)



## Kamalaśīla

“If there is no ‘fallaciousness’, in view of the ‘Universal’,—even so, having its negation suspected, the Reason would be Inconclusive”.—Anticipating this argument, the Author proceeds to point out the Invariable Concomitance of the Reason, ‘amenability to sense-organs’:—[*see verse 2745 above*]

That object is spoken of as ‘amenable to the senses’ which serves as the cause of that Sense-perception which envisages that object; in the case of an eternal entity, however, no efficient activity is possible, either successively or Simultaneously. Hence it is only right that there should be invariable concomitance (between *non-eternality* and *amenability to Sense-organs*).—(2745)
