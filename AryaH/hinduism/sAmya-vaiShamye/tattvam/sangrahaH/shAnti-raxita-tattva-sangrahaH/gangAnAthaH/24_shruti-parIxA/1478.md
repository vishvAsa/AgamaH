> “As a matter of fact, the order or arrangement is only a property of the letters; it is not regarded to be a distinct entity by itself. the idea, in fact, is that what are expressive are the letters as cognised in the said order—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of letters, 286-287].—(2285)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Not a distinct entity*’—i.e., as expressive independently by itself. Otherwise, there would be real difference between the Property and the Object to which it belongs,—which difference is not desirable.

*Question*:—What is it then that is expressive?

*Answer*;—‘*The idea in fact, etc. etc*.’—‘*Ittham*’, in a particular order. What is meant is as follows:—It is not merely the *Order* that is expressive;—nor the Order as subsisting in the Letters;—nor merely the *Letters*; what are expressive are the *Letters as arranged in a certain order*; hence in the matter of *expression*, the Order is not the principal factor; because the Letters are cognised as having the *Order*; hence the Order occupies only a secondary position; and it is the Letters that are recognised as the thing possessing that Order as their property. This is what is meant by the *Text*.—(2285)
