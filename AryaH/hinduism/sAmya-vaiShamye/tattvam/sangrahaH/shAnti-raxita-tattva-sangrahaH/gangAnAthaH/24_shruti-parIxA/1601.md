> It cannot be right that there should be a ‘manifester’,—specially for what is eternal,—in accordance with its embellishments (and modifications); consequently there cannot be diverse cognitions in regard to the word-sound.—(2494)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that in the case in question, there is no cause for mistake (wrong Cognition):—[*see verse 2494 above*]

In regard to ‘*Dhvani*’—i.e. Word-Sound,—the diversity of the *manifester* is said to be the cause of the illusion that there is diversity in the sound also. But for anything that is eternal, there can be no ‘manifester’; as in regard to eternal things, there is nothing that the *Manif ester* can do; and unless it does something to it, it cannot he its ‘Manifester’; if it were, there would be an absurdity; and anything could be the ‘Manifester’ of anything.

For these reasons it cannot be right to hold that diverse Cognitions regarding the Word-Sound are due to the embellishments of the *manifestor*.—(2494).
