> Whether the *sphoṭa* is produced or manifested by the articulations which appear in succession,—such succession is incompatible with the view of those who uphold the *sphoṭa*. When the *sphoṭa* is indivisible (without parts), there can be neither manifestation nor production of it in succession. As they would never lie outside the one and the same form,—they would be there for all.—(2713-2714)



## Kamalaśīla

So far, the author has pointed out the objections against the view that “the *Sphoṭa* is eternal”. He now proceeds to point out the objections against the view that “the *Sphoṭa* is without parts, indivisible’,—which objections a,re applicable to both views,—of *eternality* as well as *non-eternality*:—[*see verses 2713-2714 above*]

Some *Vaibhāṣikas* hold that there is ‘*Sphoṭa*’ of Sentences also, which is produced as the effect of words.

‘*It is indivisible*’—i.e. an entity without component parts.

‘*They would never lie*, *etc*.’—From the one form—produced or manifested—what is held to be unproduced or unmanifested could not be different.

‘*They*’—i.e. the production and the manifestation,—would be there for all; so that there would be no need for the use of any other letters or words at all.—(2713-2714)
