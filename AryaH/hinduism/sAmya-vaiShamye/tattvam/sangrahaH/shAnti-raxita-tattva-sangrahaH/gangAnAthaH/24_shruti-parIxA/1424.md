> “Just as the air-vibration put forth for the purpose of one does not bring about another,—in the same manner, the air-vibration, capable of bringing about the embellishment for the apprehension of one letter will not bring about another.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 80-81].—(2195)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*For the purpose of one*’—for the producing of another Letter.

‘*Capable of bringing about*, *etc, etc*.’—that *embellishment of the Auditory Organ* which brings about the hearing of the Letter, is what is spoken of bore by the term ‘*anyavarṇa-saṃskāra*’; and it is not the *embellishment of the Letter* itself that is meant; that it is so follows from the fact that it is the embellishment *of the Auditory Organ* that forms the subject-matter of the present discussion.

‘*Will not bring about another*’;—i.e. will not embellish another Letter through the embellishment of the Auditory Organ.—(2195)

*Question*:—Why should there be the restriction in the case of the *Air-vibrations* only?

*Answer* (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2196 next*]
