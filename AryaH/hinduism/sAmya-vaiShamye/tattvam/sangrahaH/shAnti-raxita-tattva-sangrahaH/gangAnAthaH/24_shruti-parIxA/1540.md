> If the Veda expressed its meaning by itself independently of conventions made by the whims of men,—then it might be valid and reliable. As, in that case, it would not abandon its meaning, even when explained otherwise by men with minds perverted by delusion, vanity and other defects;—and it would directly bring about the cognition of that meaning alone, and not express any meaning that may be desired by men.—If however, it depends upon the whims of men, then it does not differ from the common assertions of men; as in that case the expressing of meaning would be dependent upon men, and it is quite possible that it may be wrong.—(2394-2397)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author again shows that the premiss regarding the Veda being independent of personalities is ‘inconclusive’:—[*see verses 2394-2397 above*]

The whims of men are unfettered; if then the Veda depended, in the expressing of its meaning, upon Conventions made by the whims of men,—it would not express the meaning that is desired; as there would be nothing to restrict it. On the other hand, if the Veda expressed its meaning independently of the Conventions, then it would be possible for it to be valid and reliable; because regardless of the explanations propounded by men, it would directly express its meaning; even though it might be explained otherwise by men, it would never abandon the function of expressing its own meaning by itself,—exactly as the eye and other organs do not abandon their inherent function of apprehending things.—This is the sense of the whole argument.

‘*Ākhyāyamāna*’—Being explained.

‘*Aram*’—Quickly; at once.

‘*Wrong*’—i.e. the whims of men may be wrong.—(2394-2397)
