## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—“If, as has been said, there is no real relationship between the Object and the Word,—then how does the said *caudal relationship* come about?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2624 above*]:

‘*The Cause and the Effect*’—i.e. the two things of which one is the *Cause* and another the *Effect*.

‘*Spoken of as such*’—as ‘Causal relation’, etc.—for the sake of brevity.—(2624)
