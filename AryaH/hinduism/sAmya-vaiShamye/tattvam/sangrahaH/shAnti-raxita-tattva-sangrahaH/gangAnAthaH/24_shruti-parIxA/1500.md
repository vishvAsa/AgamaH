> “In the case cited, it may be that the ‘universal’ is not admitted by the party adducing the probans; even so, the probans remains invalid, so long as the ‘universal’ has not been rejected.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 345-346].—(2319)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—If that Probans alone can prove or disprove which is admitted by both parties,—then, how is it that you yourself have urged the ‘inconclusiveness’ of a Reason, against the *Buddhist*, on the basis of the ‘Universal’ (which is not admitted by him)?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2319 above*]

Even though, by the Buddhist and others who have put forward the Probans in question, the ‘Universal’ is not admitted as something wherein the contrary of the Probandum is present,—yet, as a matter of fact, the existence of the Universal cannot be denied. The sense is that, even under the circumstances, the Probans is one whose concomitance with the contrary of the Probandum is *suspected* (and hence invalid).—(2319)
