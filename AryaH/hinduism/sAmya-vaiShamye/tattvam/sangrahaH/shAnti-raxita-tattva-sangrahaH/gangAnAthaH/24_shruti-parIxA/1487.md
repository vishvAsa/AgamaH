> “Or, the individuals (articulations) themselves, being extremely subtle in their nature,—there is cognition of the properties of the ‘universal’; and it is through this that there is cognition of order among the letters, even though these are all-pervading.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 300].—(2297) commentary.



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Individuals*’—stands for the particular Articulations. The parts—components—of the Articulations—which appear in a certain order,—are extremely subtle; hence there can be no usage through them; consequently the properties of the Universal—such as *eternality* and the rest—become recognised—definitely known—as the causes of the manifestation of the Word-Sound.

*Question*:—What if that is so?

*Answer*:—‘*It is through this, etc*. etc.’—Even though the Letters are all-pervading, yet they appear as if in an Order of Sequence, on account of the Order of the Articulations which always appear in a certain order.—(2297)
