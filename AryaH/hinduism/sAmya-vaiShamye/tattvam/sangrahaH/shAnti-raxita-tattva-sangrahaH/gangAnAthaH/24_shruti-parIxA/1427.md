> “Or, the idea that should be entertained is that the auditory organ consists of space,—which idea would be in accordance with the Veda [*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 150];—nowhere in the.veda has it been said that the auditory organ consists in *ākāśa*, etc.—In connection with dissolutions, it has been declared (in the Veda) that the auditory organ becomes dissolved into space; here we have the description of the organs,—like the eye and the rest,—becoming dissolved into their original constituents.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 150-151].—(2198-2199)



## Kamalaśīla

So far the *Mīmāṃsaka* has taken for granted (for the sake of argument) the idea that the Auditory Organ consists of *Ākāśa*, as postulated under other doctrines,—or that it consists of the Ear-drum as conceived by common people,—and then proceeded to show that there can be nothing objectionable in the idea of the Word-Sound being manifested through the embellishment of the said Auditory Organ.—He now proceeds to take his stand upon the idea of the Auditory Organ consisting of *space* as described in the Veda, and to show that there can be no objection against the idea of Word-Sound being manifested by the diverse embellishments of that organ:—[*see verses 2198-2199 above*]

‘*The idea that the Auditory Organ consists in space*’; i.e. the conclusion should be accepted that ‘Space itself is the Auditory Organ.’

Why so?

‘*Because nowhere in the Veda, etc*. *etc*.’

If that is so, then, nowhere in the Veda is it found declared that ‘Space constitutes the Auditory Organ’; then why should that idea be accepted?

*Answer*:—‘In *connection with Dissolutions*, etc. etc.’—‘Dissolution’ consists in becoming dissolved into the original constituent cause. At the time of the death of living beings, their Eye and other organs become dissolved into their respective original constituent causes; in connection with the animal that is sacrificed, it is said in the Veda—‘May its Eye revert to the Sun, and the Ear to Space’,—‘may revert’ is to be construed with the latter sentence also. ‘*May revert*’—i.e. may it go to that from where it came. Thus though in the Veda it has not been directly declared that ‘Space constitutes the Auditory Organ’, yet the sentence ‘may the Ear revert to Space’ clearly implies that idea which is, thus, as good as asserted.

How so?

*Answer*:—‘*Here we have the description, etc. etc*.’;—what the sentence ‘may the Ear revert to Space’ is meant to describe is the fact that the Ear reverts to its original Constituent Cause, the meaning being—‘may the Ear revert to Space, which is its original Constituent Cause ‘Like what?’—‘*Like the Eye*, *etc*.’—(2198-2199)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verse 2200 next*]
