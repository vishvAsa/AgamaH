> The ‘manifestation’,—as in the case of letters,—can only consist in the embellishment of the object or the sense-organ concerned. And here also, in regard to the cognition envisaging the sphoṭa, the said ‘manifestation’ can be denied in the same way (as in the case of letters).—(2719)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*As in the case of Letters*’;—in connection with Letters, the idea that ‘there is *manifestation* in the shape of the embellishment of the Object and the Sense-organ’ has been refuted by showing that none of the alternatives possible is admissible regarding its capacity or otherwise of bringing about cognitions;—the same refutation is applicable to the present case also.

‘*The cognition envisaging the Sphoṭa*’—‘*Tat*’ stands for the *Sphoṭa*. This is said on admitting (for the sake of argument) that there is such a *cognition*.

What is meant is as follows:—If there did really appear in consciousness a verbal entity called ‘*Sphoṭa*’ as something apart from the Letters,—then its ‘manifestation’ could be possible; as ‘manifestation’ would mean ‘apprehension As a matter of fact, however, no such entity appears in Consciousness,—as already explained before.—But, let it appear in Consciousness; even so, the said ‘manifestation’ cannot be acceptable; as by its very nature, it cannot be either capable or incapable of being apprehended.—(2719)
