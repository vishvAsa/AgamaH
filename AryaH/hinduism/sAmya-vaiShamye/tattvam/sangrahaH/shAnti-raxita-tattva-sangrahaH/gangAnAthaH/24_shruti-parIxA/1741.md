## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2756*]:

*Question*:—Why do not they all move along at one and the same time? *Answer*:—[*see verse 2756 above*]

*Question*:—If the said portions of the Flame are capable of moving about, why do not they burn the grass or cotton that lies near it?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2757a above*]

[*verse 2757a*]:

What is meant is that it is only when the Flame is in the massed form that it becomes operative,—not when it is scattered about.—(2757a)

The answer to the above is as follows:—[*see verse 2757b above*]

[*verse 2757b*]:

Granting (for the sake of argument) what the other party has said, the Author points out defects in their argument:—[*see verse 2758 above*]

[*verse 2758*]:

‘*So* *long as*, *etc*.’—of the parts of the Flame.

‘*As before*’—as in the massed state;—there being no difference between the flame in the two states.—(2758)
