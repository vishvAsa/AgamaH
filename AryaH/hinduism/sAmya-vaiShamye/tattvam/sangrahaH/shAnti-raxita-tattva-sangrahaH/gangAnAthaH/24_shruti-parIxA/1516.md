> Even though there is no author, the Veda cannot be regarded as saying what is true;—because it is devoid of those excellences in its source which would make it truthful;—just as in the absence of defects, the word is not regarded as false,—(2353)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*) that “that which is free from the contact of defects conducive to *falsity* must be the source of *true* cognition, etc. etc.”.—The Author, for the sake of argument, admits the Reason here adduced, and then proceeds to show that it is ‘inconclusive’—[*see verse 2353 above*]

‘*Eṣā*’ stands for the Veda,

A man under the influence of Love and Hatred, etc. is found to say things that are *not true*; in this way, through positive and negative concomitance, it is ascertained that there are certain defects which lie at the root of *falsity*; similarly a man full of mercy and other good qualities is found to be truthful; hence these good qualities are excellences that lie at the root of *truthfulness*.—Thus, in the absence (in the case of the *Veda*) of these causes of truthfulness, the effect, in the shape of *Truthfulness*, also should be non-existent.—So that even though the Veda, may not be the work of a Person, its *truthfulness* is not established; hence the Reason put forward by the *Mīmāṃsaka* is ‘Inconclusive—(2353)

*Question*:—“But how is it ascertained that the excellences are absent?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2354 next*]
