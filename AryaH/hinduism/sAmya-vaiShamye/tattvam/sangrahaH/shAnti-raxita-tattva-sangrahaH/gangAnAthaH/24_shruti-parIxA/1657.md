> The idea that appears in men as to ‘the sun being over my head’ is surely wrong; because all living beings see the same sun at the same time,—and not different suns; because in reality no second solar disc exists; if it existed, it would surely be seen, and yet it is not seen; hence it is definitely concluded that only one sun exists.—As regards the word-sound, however, it has never been definitely ascertained to be one and the same; because whether appearing in succession or simultaneously it is clearly characterised by multiplicity. Even when speakers pronounce the letter ‘ga’ at one and the same time, the difference among them is clearly apprehended.—(2595-2599)



## Kamalaśīla

The following has been urged in,the *Bhāṣya* (of *Śabara*):—“It might be urged that it is not possible for one and the same thing to be seen simultaneously at several places; but the foolish man who says this should look at the sun, where one and the same sun is seen in several places..... It might be that its exact position is not ascertained on account of remoteness; hence there is an illusion. The same may be said in regard to the Word-Sound also; there is no definite cognition of the exact position”. (Sū. 1. 1. 15; *Translation*, pp. 35-36).

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2595-2599 above*]:

If the second solar Disc existed, it would be perceptible; but it is never perceived; hence it follows with certainty that it is one only; hence the idea that ‘the sun is above me’ is held to be wrong.

The *one-ness* of the Word-Sound, however, is not recognised in this manner; by virtue of which the idea of its being present in several places might be regarded as wrong. It is only when such one-ness is established that the idea of the said presence could be wrong. But that one-ness itself has not been established.

‘*Solar disc*—The term ‘*rāvam*’ is made up of the noun ‘*ravi*’with the ‘*aṃ*’ affix.

Says the Opponent:—“The one-ness of the Word-Sound has certainly been definitely established through *Recognition*”.

The answer to this is—‘*It has never been definitely ascertained, etc. etc*.’—That is to say, the validity of Recognition as a means of Right Cognition has been already rejected.

The words ‘*even when*, *etc*. *etc*.’ explain that even when the appearance is simultaneous, there is multiplicity.

‘*Clearly*’;—because all details regarding swiftness, middling and slow, etc. etc. are clearly perceived.—(2595-2599)
