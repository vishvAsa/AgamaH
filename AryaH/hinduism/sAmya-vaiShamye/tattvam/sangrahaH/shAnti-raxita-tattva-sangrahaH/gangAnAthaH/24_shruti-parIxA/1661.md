> Ākāśa being undefinable and vague, there can be no ‘manifestation’ of it; and as it is beyond the reach of the senses, what is seen in the pit, is not *ākāśa*, but light.—(2608)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Text* 2230 above, that—“when a large pit is dug in the ground, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2608 above*]:

It cannot be proved that *Ākāśa* is a positive entity; hence there can be no ‘manifestation’ of it; specially as there is the idea of *Ākāśa* only when there is nothing tangible perceived; for instance, in deep darkness, when people do not meet with any obstruction, they are found to say—‘there is nothing here, it is mere *Ākāśa*’.

Even for those who regard *Ākāśa* as a positive entity, it is beyond the reach of the senses; how then could there be any cognition of *Ākāśa*?—This is what is meant by the words—‘As *it is beyond the reach of the senses, etc*. *etc*.’

*Question* “If this is so, then what is it that is seen in the pit?”

*Answer* It is only Light that is seen.—(2608)
