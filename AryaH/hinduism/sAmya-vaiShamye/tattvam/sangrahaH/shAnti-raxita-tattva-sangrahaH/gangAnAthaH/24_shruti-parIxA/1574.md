> The principle just explained forms the reason why it is asserted by the wise that the Veda cannot be regarded as a means of right cognition. And in this they say what is perfectly true.—(2445)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2113,—“Even those who are hostile to the *Veda* do not assert any reason why it should not be a Means of Right Cognition, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2445 above*]

‘*The Principle just explained*’—viz. that ‘Words, dependent upon mere whim, can have no inseparable connection with the real state of things

‘*The wise*’—i.e. the Buddhists.

The Author of the *Bhāṣya* (*Śabam*) has declared as follows;—“The cognition derived from the Vedic assertion is *direct perception*; and no Inference can be reliable when it is opposed to Perception” (Sū. 1. 1. 2). *[Translation*, p. 6];—and again—“As a matter of fact it is the Vedic Injunction which is capable of making known what is past, present and future, also what is subtle or hidden or remote and such like; this cannot be done by any organ of sense”. [*Translation*. p. 4.]

All this becomes discarded by what has been said above;—as all this is equally applicable to human assertions also.—(2445)
