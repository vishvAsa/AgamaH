> As a matter of fact, there can be no ‘counter-argument’ against the reason ‘because it is an aggregate’; because this is a character whose invariable concomitance has been recognised as embracing all things.—(2781)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2341, that—“As regards the argument based upon the fact of the Veda being an aggregate, the counter-argument should be stated as follows:—Vedic study is always preceded by previous study,—because it is called ‘Vedic study’,—like the study carried on at the present time The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 2781 above*]

That is, the character of having its invariable concomitance with all things has been duly recognised.

This shows that the Buddhist argument proceeds on the nature and capacity of things; as nothing else can embrace all things. And when an Inference has proceeded on the strength of the nature and capacity of things, there can be no counter-argument, against it. Because the nature of things cannot be altered; nor is it possible for two mutually contradictory characters to subsist in the same thing; or else it would cease to be *one* thing.—(2781)
