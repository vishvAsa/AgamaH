> “Just as the lamp is regarded as the manifester of the jar, through the aid that it affords to the eye,—so (in the case of the word-sound) the articulation would be the manifester (of the sound) through the impression that it makes upon the auditory organ.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 42].—(2170)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—How can the embellishment of one thing bring about the manifestation of something else?

*Answer* (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*):—[*see verse 2170 above*]

Just as the Lamp becomes the manifester of the Jar, through the help it accords to the Eye, so the Articulation also, would be the manifester of the Sound through the embellishment of—impression upon—the Auditory Organ.—(2170)
