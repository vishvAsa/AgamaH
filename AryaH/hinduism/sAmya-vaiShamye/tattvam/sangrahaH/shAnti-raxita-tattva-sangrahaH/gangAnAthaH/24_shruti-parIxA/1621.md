> Because the auditory organ brings about the cognition of sound as interrupted, therefore, like the mind, it must be regarded as operating without contact;—not otherwise, like the skin (tactile organ).—(2526)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus stated the proof *against* the view that Sound is heard on getting into contact with the Sense-organ,—the Author next states the proof *in support* *of* the view that the perception takes place without the said contact:—[*see verse 2526 above*]

‘*Tat*’—Therefore.

‘*Not otherwise, etc. etc*.’—This supplies the Corroborative Instance *for dissimilarity*.—In the case of the Tactile Organ (which operates by contact), the perception is *not interrupted*, and the same would have been the case with the Auditory Organ also (if this also operated through contact).—(2526)
