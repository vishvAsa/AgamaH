> If the word-sound is not of the nature of being apprehended by its cognition, then, in that case, it would be on the same footing as taste and other things, which also are not of the nature of being apprehended by the cognition of word-sound; and in that case, auditory perception would not be the cognition of sound.—(2506)

The second alternative [noted in the Introduction to *Text* 2502, that ‘by its very nature, the Word-Sound is not endowed with the character, of being apprehended by its Cognition’] also is open to the following objection:—[*see verse 2506 above*]

This is easily understood.—(2506)
