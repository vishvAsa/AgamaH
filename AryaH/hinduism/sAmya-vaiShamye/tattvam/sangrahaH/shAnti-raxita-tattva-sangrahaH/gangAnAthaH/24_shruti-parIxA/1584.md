> Diversity in the form of ‘agreeable’ and ‘disagreeable’ and so forth, is directly perceived;—the diversity among cognitions is cognised on the ground of their appearing in succession,—as in the case of the virgin,—the cognitions of the individual ‘cow-words’, appearing at different times and places, cannot all denote one and the same object,—because they actually appear as diverse,—like the cognitions of taste, colour, etc.—The diversity in the cognitions of the various notes (of sound) in the shape of the ‘ṣaḍja’ and the rest is cognised by perception..... as is going to be explained later on.—(2462-2464)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“How is the diversity of Individuals recognised by Sense-perception?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 2462-2464 above*]

‘*Manojña*’—pleasing to the mind, Agreeable;—the contrary of this is ‘*amanojña*’, Disagreeable.

Annulment by Inference is next shown—‘*The diversity among cognitions*, *etc. etc*.’—The exact meaning of this will be made clear below, under the following *Text*.

The Inference may be formulated as follows;—Those Cognitions that appear as different cannot all envisage the same object,—e.g. the cognitions envisaging Taste, Colour and so forth;—and the cognitions of the individual ‘Cow-words’ appearing at different times and places appear as different; hence there is apprehension of the wider ‘contrary

That the Reason here put forward is not ‘inadmissible’ is shown by the sentence—‘*The diversity in the cognitions*, *etc. etc*.’—(2462-2464)
