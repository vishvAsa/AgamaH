> “The white object standing beeore persons some of whom are blind and the others are not,—the object is not seen by those who are blind, while it is seen by those who are not; but this does not make the object existent and nonexistent.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra*, 37].—(2270)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—In the case of the two characters of *being known* and *being not-known*,—these two also imply the mutually contradictory characters of *existence* and *non-existence* as residing in the same substratum [it being the Object that has the characters of *being known* and *being not-known*, even though the *knowledge* resides in the men]; hence the said incongruity vitiates this view also. Because the *cognition* and *non-cognition* of things are invariably concomitant with their *existence* and *non-existence*; because they are based upon these; if it is not so, then it behoves you to explain why when two persons are standing upon equally suitable places, one sees the thing while the other does not.

In anticipation of this argument, the *Mīmāṃsaka* says:—[*see verse 2270 above*]

In order to meet the question as to what is the cause of this,—the *Mīmāṃsaka* offers the following explanation:—[*see verse 2271 next*]
