> The embellishment, when it comes, would come about by the removal of the immobile air-envelope; and it has been pound that when the covering envelope is removed, the apprehension of what has been there follows (as a matter of course).—(2166)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—Though the embellishment appertains to all Sounds equally,—yet that Word-Sound alone is actually apprehended which the hearer desires to apprehend,—none other.

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verse 2166 above*]

There are two kinds of Air—mobile and immobile; it is the immobile Air which envelopes Sound, like dense Darkness;—it is in this Air-envelope that Conjunctions and Disjunctions are produced by the Air proceeding from the Speaker’s mouth;—these Conjunctions and Disjunctions bring about the removal of the said Air-envelope; removal of the Air-covering is what is meant by the ‘embellishment’ of Sound,—which cannot mean the strengthening of its characteristic features; because Sound is eternal and always of one and the same form.

What if it is so?

‘*It has been found, etc. etc*.’—‘Found’ in scriptures and also in common experience; e.g. when the enveloping darkness is removed, the Jar that is there,—even though its perception may not be desired,—becomes perceived, because it lies in a perceptible spot.—(2166)
