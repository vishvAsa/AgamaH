> When a cognition proceeds from the words of a human-being, in regard to something beyond the senses,—why do you not regard it to be as reliable as that derived from sense-perception?—(2440)



## Kamalaśīla

If even when not inseparably related, the Word were a Means of Right Cognition, then there would be incongruities,—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2440 above*]

Why should not reliability belong to the words that ‘Heaven does *not* result from the performance of the *Agnihotra*’? Because in both cases—[in the case of these words and in that of the Vedic declaration that Heaven does result from the performance of the *Agnihotra*]—the character of *not being denied* is equally present.—(2440)

The same non-difference between the two cases is further explained:—[*see verses 2441-2442 next*]
