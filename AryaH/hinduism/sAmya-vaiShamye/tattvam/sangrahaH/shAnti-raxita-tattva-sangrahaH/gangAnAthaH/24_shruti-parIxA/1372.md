> “As regards the positive fact of the eternality of the Veda, it becomes established for us on the rejection of the ‘two ends’ (of the Veda),—even though we do not adduce proofs in support of the said eternality—(2102)



## Kamalaśīla

Objection:—even when the said proofs have been refuted, it is necessary to put forth a further effort to prove the positive fact of the Veda being eternal; under the circumstances, how can the upholders of the Veda be satisfied, until they have actually proved the eternality of the Veda?

The answer to this (from the *mīmāṃsaka*) is as follows:—

‘*The* *two ends*’—i.e. the proof adduced in proof of the idea of the Veda having a beginning and end.—(2102)
