## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—“What is declared by the Veda—how can it be discarded by Inference? If the idea provided by a Means of Right Cognition were discarded,—then why should the Inference also not be discarded?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2439 above*]

‘*Tasyāḥ*’—of the Inference.

Words depend upon the whim of the Speaker, and as such they can have no fixed relationship to any real state of things; hence it cannot be regarded as a Means of Right Cognition in regard to the state of things.—Inference, on the other hand, always appears on the basis of the Probans which is inseparably related either by sameness or by causality; and as such it is inseparably connected with the thing;that is why it is a Means of Right Cognition and is capable of discarding notions to the contrary..

‘*Tadbhāvinyā*’—proceeding from words.—(2439)
