> When a man passes from place to place, one after the other,—it is so because he is in a perpetual flux; if it were not so, there could be no such ‘going’; if he remained fixed, permanently, then the man, not dissociated from his previous position, would continue to remain there; and as such he could not get at another place.—(2606-2607)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2227, that—“Just as the single person, Devadatta, passing from place to place, one after the other, does not become different, so the Word-Sound also does not differ simply because it is heard in several places”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2606-2607 above*]:

In the case of the non-eternal thing, the only ‘movement’ possible is in the shape of *being born in another place*; not so in the case of the eternal thing, which, unless it abandons its character as associated with one place, can never ‘go’ to another place.—This is what is pointed out by the *Text* 2607.—(2606-2607)
