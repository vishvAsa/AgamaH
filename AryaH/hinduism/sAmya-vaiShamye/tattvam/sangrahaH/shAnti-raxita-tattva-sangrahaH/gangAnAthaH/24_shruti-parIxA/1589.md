> Any such eternal universal as ‘cow’ has been already rejected; the relationship also is purely imaginary; the ‘*ākāśa*’ and the ‘atom’ also have been discarded. hence neither the probans nor the corroborative instance is sound.—(2472)



## Kamalaśīla

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* argument has been formulated under the *Text* 2135, in the following words—“From this it follows that the Word is *not-artificial*, and it never perishes,—because it has an eternal relationship with an eternal entity—like the *Akāśa* and the *Atom*”.

In the following *Text*, it is pointed out that the Reason and the Corroborative Instance herein adduced are both ‘inadmissible’.—[*see verse 2472 above*]

‘*Any such eternal Universal, etc*.’;—this asserts the fact of the *eternal* thing being ‘inadmissible’.

‘*The Relationship also*, *etc*.’—this asserts the ‘inadmissibility’ of the Reason ‘because there is relationship’.

‘*The Atom and the Ākāśa also have been discarded*’,—this asserts the ‘inadmissibility’ of the two Instances cited by the *Mīmāṃsaka*.

‘*Rejected*’, ‘*Discarded*’,—in course of the chapter on the ‘Six Categories’.

‘*Na*’—denies the Reason, etc.

‘*Tat*’—Therefore; hence.—(2472)
