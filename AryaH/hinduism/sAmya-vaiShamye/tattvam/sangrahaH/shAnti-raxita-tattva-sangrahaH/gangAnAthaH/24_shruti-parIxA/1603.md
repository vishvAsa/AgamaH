> In this way the word-sound would be uncognisable; as it would not be of any use in its own cognition, and, on that account, it would not be different from taste and other things (so far as having no bearing on the said cognition is concerned).—(2500)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—“If the Word-Sound were held to be a cause of the production of the Cognition, then there might be some room for raising the question as to its being *capable* or *not capable*;—as it is, however, what is held to be the cause of the Cognition of the Word-Sound is the embellished Auditory Organ,—and not the Sound; hence there is no room for the objections that have been urged”.

The Author attacks the view directly and refutes it in the following:—[*see verse 2500 above*]

In this way, like Taste, etc., the Word-Sound also would have no bearing upon its Cognition; and this would mean that it is not cognisable by that Cognition.

This argument may be formulated as follows:—When a certain thing has no bearing upon a Cognition, it cannot be cognised by that Cognition;—e.g. Taste, etc. in regard to Auditory Cognition;—the Word-Sound has no bearing upon the Cognition of that Sound;—hence there is apprehension of something contrary to the wider condition.

The reason here adduced is not ‘Inconclusive’; because, if what has no bearing upon a Cognition were cognised by that Cognition,—there would be no restriction at all, and Taste might also become cognisable by Auditory Cognition.—(2500)
