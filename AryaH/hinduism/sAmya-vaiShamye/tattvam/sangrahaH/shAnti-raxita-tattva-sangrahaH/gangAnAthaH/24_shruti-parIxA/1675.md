## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“The *Perpetual Flux* is not admitted by us; why then should you say that it must be different on account of Perpetual Flux?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2631 above*]:

‘*Tasyāpi*’—stands for the Relationships.

‘*Āhuḥ*’—they (Buddhists) explain it as such.

‘*Otherwise*, *etc. etc*.’—i.e. there would be no succession in the Cognitions also.—(2631)
