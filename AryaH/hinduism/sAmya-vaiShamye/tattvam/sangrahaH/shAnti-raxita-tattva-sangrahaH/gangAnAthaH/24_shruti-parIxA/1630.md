> All those objections that have been urged against those who hold ākāśa to be without parts, should be understood to be equally applicable to that view also under which the auditory organ consists of the one indivisible space.—(2538)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, under *Text* 2198, that—“or, the idea that should be entertained is that the Auditory Organ consists of *space*, which idea would be in accordance with the Veda”.

As this is open to the same objections, the Author applies them to that view, in the following:—[*see verse 2538 above*]

The view that the Auditory Organ consists of the indivisible Space, is open to all those objections—the futility of embellishment, the impossibility of embellishment, etc.—that have been urged against the view that it consists of the indivisible *Ākāśa*. Hence it is not necessary to state the objections against this other view separately.—(2538)
