> If it was previously inefficient, and is made efficient by the explanations,—then it becomes a source of knowledge through the help of personalities, and hence the work of a person.—(2365)



## Kamalaśīla

The underlying idea is that the efficiency or potency is not something apart from the Veda itself; if it were something different, then as there would be no connection between the Veda and the efficiency, the Veda would not be an active agent at all; as effects are produced from efficiency only,

‘*Source of knowledge*’—The Veda as source of knowledge, comes to be born of Personalities; the form of the Veda itself becomes born of Personalities; and as all this is not different from the Veda, the Veda itself becomes ‘born of personalities’.—(2365)

Further, it is not only that by dependence upon something else, the Veda becomes non-eternal; the assumption that it is not the work of an author also becomes futile.—This is shown in the following:—[*see verses 2365-2368 next*]
