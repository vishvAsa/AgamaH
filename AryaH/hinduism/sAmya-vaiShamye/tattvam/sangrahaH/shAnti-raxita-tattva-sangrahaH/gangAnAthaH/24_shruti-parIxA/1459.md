> “For those persons who live at different times and places, etc.—prior to the hearing of other words—there cannot be even one such word as had its connection set up.—Even if the idea be that the connection is ‘asserted’ (not set up or created),—the refutation of that also would be the same; as no such ‘assertion’ is possible in regard to what has perished, or what is non-existent, or what exists only at the present moment”.—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 260-261].—(2247-2248)]



## Kamalaśīla

The term ‘*ādi*’, ‘*etcetera*’, includes the states of childhood, youth and so forth.

‘*Prior to*’—this has to be construed with ‘*hearing of other Words*’, ‘*Perished*, *etc*. *etc*.’—‘*what has perished*’—i.e. the *past*;—‘what *is nonexistent*’—the *future*; with regard to these two no ‘assertion of connection’ can be made, because they are non-existent at the time;—as regards ‘*what exists*’—i.e. the *present*, which is being uttered,—that also perishes immediately; how could it continue to exist till the setting up of the Connection?—(2247-2248)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verses 2249-2251 next*]
