## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“If that is so, then what is the connection between the words and the said *Desire to Speak*,—by virtue of which they could serve to indicate that Desire?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2620 above*]:

As a matter of fact, words are definitely known—through Perception and Non-apprehension in oneself,—to be the effect of the *Desire to Speak*; hence the relation between them is that of *Cause and Effect*.—(2620)
