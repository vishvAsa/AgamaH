> “[Says the opponent]—‘[Even though the letters may be eternal] the arrangement (order) of the letters cannot be eternal;—consequently what is expressive cannot be eternal. because what is regarded as expressive is the word; and the idea of the word is dependent upon the said order (of letters)’.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 278].—(2279)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *texts*, the *Mīmāṃsaka* anticipates the objections of the Opponent—[*see verse 2279 above*]

The Word is held (by the *Mīmāṃsaka*) to consist of the definite arrangement of the Letters,—not of any such single entity as the ‘Sphoṭa’ [which, according to the Grammarian, is what, in the case of every Word, is really the entity representing the whole Word, which expresses the meaning];—and as the arrangement or order of the Letters is always dependent upon the whim of man (the Speaker), it cannot be eternal; and in this way the Letters also must be regarded as non-eternal; because the ‘arrangement’ is not anything different from the *Letters*.

How so?

‘*Because what is regarded as expressive*, *etc. etc*.’—It is the Word, consisting of the Letters, that is regarded to be *expressive*; because the idea of ‘Word’ is due to the particular arrangement of the Letters, not to any such other entity as the ‘*Sphoṭa*’;—and the arrangement is due to human agency.—(2279)

The same idea is further explained—[*see verses 2280-2281 next*]
