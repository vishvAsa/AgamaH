> “The same conclusion could be proved on the ground of its being a letter, like the letter ‘*kha*’.—As a matter of fact the contrary of this is never perceived; hence the said conclusion cannot be said to be annulled by perception.”—[*Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa*, 34]—(2144)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*The same conclusion*’—the denial of the individual ‘Ga’ apart from the Universal.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—The Letter ‘Ga’ cannot be entirely differentiated from the substratum of the universal ‘Ga’,—e.g. the letter ‘Kha’,—and ‘Ga’ is a letter;—hence here there is apprehension of what is concomitant with the Contrary,—as ‘being Letter’ is invariably concomitant with the contrary of being the substratum of the Universal ‘Ga’,

That the Conclusion of this argument is not sublated by Perception is shown by the words—‘*The contrary of this, etc. etc*.’—‘contrary’ stands for *difference* between the two.—‘Dṛṣṭam’—Perceived fact.—(2144)
