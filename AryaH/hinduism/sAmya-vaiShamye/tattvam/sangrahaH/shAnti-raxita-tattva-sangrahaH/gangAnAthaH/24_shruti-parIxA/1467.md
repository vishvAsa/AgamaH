> “It is often found that though a certain thing exists, it is not known; but it is never found by any person that what is absolutely non-existent is existent; because existence and non, existence being mutually contradictory, cannot belong to the same thing. There is no such contradiction between being known and being not known; because knowledge subsists in the cognisant person; and as personalities vary, there is no incompatibility; hence the absence of knowledge, as residing in one person, does not become excluded (by the presence of knowledge, in another person).—[*Ślokavārtika-samhandhākṣepaparihāra*, 33-35].—(2267-2269)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—It is not possible for the same thing to have the two contradictory characters of *being existent* and *being non-existent*? similarly it cannot be right for the same thing to be both *known* and *not known*. If there is no incompatibility between these two, why should there be incompatibility between *existence* and *non-existence*?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2267-2269 above*]

It is incompatible for two mutually contradictory properties to reside in the same thing,—not when they reside in different things. As regards *being known* and *being not known*,—these reside in different persons; hence there can be no incongruity in this. The same cannot be said of *existence* and *non-existence*, which have been held (by the Opponent) to reside in the same thing (the Connection). Such, in brief, is the sense of the argument.—(2267-2269)
