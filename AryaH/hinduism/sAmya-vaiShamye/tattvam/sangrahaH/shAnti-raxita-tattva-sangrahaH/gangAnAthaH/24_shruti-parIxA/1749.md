> Who can ever cognise the potency, in the form of the connection between the word and its meaning? That is why in the case of the Veda, even the use is not regarded as due to human agency.—It could not be learnt from more experienced people; because, by themselves, these also are equally ignorant. the only cognition therefore that may be possible is through the explanations provided by men.—(2772-2773)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued by the *Mimāṃsaka* under *Text* 2340, that—who has perceived the connection of such things as *Heaven*, *Sacrifice*, etc., all of which are beyond the reach of the senses?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2772-2773 above*]

What is meant is as follows:—By implication, you have yourself shown that the knowledge of the meaning of the Veda that there is proceeds only from the explanations provided by men. Because by its very nature, the potency rests in supersensuous things;—hence the use or employment of the Word in regard to this potency cannot be due to man; nor can the cognition of it be derived from the more experienced people; because all these also are equally ignorant;—the case therefore would be like the knowledge of Colour being obtained from blind men.—Hence, by implication, it follows that the said cognition must be due to explanations provided by men; there is no other alternative possible.—(2772-2773)

The Opponent brings forward the following objection:—[*see verse 2774 next*]
