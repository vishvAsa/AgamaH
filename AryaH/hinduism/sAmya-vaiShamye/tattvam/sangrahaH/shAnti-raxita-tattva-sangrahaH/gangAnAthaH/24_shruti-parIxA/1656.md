> Even if the reflected image exists in several places, it varies regarding its largeness, smallness and so forth; hence it cannot be one and the same.—(2594)



## Kamalaśīla

Granting that the Reflected Image is a real entity; even so several such images can figure in the same Cognition;—this is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 2594 above*]:

‘*And so forth*’—includes *length*, etc.

It might be argued that—“Even though there is diversity of *largeness* and the rest, yet in some way, on account of all being *blue, etc*., they might figure in the same cognition”.

But even so, that does not prove real *one-ness*; the *one-ness* might be *assumed*; but as regards that, your argument would be futile (as that is admitted by us also).

If the *one-ness* were real, even when the Images are perceived in different places, etc.,—then there may be one-ness between the *Brāhmaṇa* and the *Cāṇḍāla*, on the ground of both being *men*;—there would be one-ness between your mother and your wife, on the ground of both being *women*,—one-ness also between your mouth and the lower orifice, on the ground of both being made up of Earth. In fact, the whole universe would be *one*, on the ground of everything being a *Entity*; and in that case the contingency of the simultaneous birth and death of things would become irresistible.—(2594)
