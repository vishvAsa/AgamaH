## Kamalaśīla

Even granting that the Reflected Image is something different, produced in the reflecting medium, the *Mīmāṃsaka*, offers another explanation;—[*see verse 2225 above*]

Even if the Reflected Image is something different, these images cannot be several;—why?—*because they are apprehended by the same Cognition*—i.e. they all fall within the same idea.

In the same way, the Word-Sound also becomes established as one,—because it is apprehended by a single Idea.—(2225)
