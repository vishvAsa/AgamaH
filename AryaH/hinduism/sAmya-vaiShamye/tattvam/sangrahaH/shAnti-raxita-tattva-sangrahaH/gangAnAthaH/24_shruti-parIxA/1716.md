## Kamalaśīla

What is meant by this is as follows First of all, there is apprehension (of the Letters),—then the Remembrances immediately following from them come about in the same order as the Letters;—then from these Remembrances, there follows the cumulative cognition of all the Letters,—this cognition also is of the nature of Remembrance; because it only envisages things that have been previously perceived.—(2721)
