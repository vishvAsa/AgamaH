> “We do not necessarily accept the idea of the auditory organ consisting of *ākāśa*; nor can *ākāśa* be regarded as being without parts:—because such an idea has been negatived by the Jaina and the Sāṃkhya.—Consequently the auditory organ may be a part of *ākāśa*, or it may be a distinct entity by itself;—thus there is a separate auditory organ for each person,—which idea is based upon presumption due to the fact that well-known effects cannot be explained except on that basis.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 66-68].—(2183-2184)



## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—Under the view that the Auditory Organ is *Ākāśa*, if there is embellishment of the organ, there are various objections against this as pointed out above—such as ‘Being all-pervasive, there would be equality of contact with all Sounds and all organs’ (*Text* 2161);—how then is it that the Author of the *Bhāṣya* (*Śabara*) has provided the Answer on the basis of the ‘embellishment of the Auditory Organ’?

The Answer to this (from the *Mīmāṃsaka*) is as follows:—[*see verses 2183-2184 above*]

What is meant by this is that the objections urged against that theory are not applicable to the *Mīmāṃsaka*, who does not accept that theory.

‘*Nor can Ākāśa be regarded as being without parts*’—The verb ‘*abhyupeyate*’ (is accepted) has to be construed here also.

Why?

‘*Because such an idea has been negatived by the Jaina and the Sāṃkhya*’,—The *Jainas*—the *Ārhatas*,—as well as the *Sāṃkhyas* have rejected that idea. It is not that the *Mīmāṃsakas* do not make use of the conclusions of other people; they accept anything that is found to follow from reason; if they did not do this, they would cease to be ‘*Mīmāṃsakas*’ (Rationalists). Consequently, even if they accepted the *Jaina* and *Sāṃkhya* idea of the Auditory Organ consisting of *Ākāśa*, they would be doing nothing objectionable. ‘*Or it may be a distinct entity by itself*’,—called the ‘Ear-drum’,

‘*Presumption due, etc. etc*.’—i.e. based upon the fact that the phenomenon of the *hearing of Sound* cannot be explained except on the basis of this idea.—(2183-2184)

Or, even the view that the Auditory Organ consists of the *indivisible Ākāśa*, is not open to the said objections.—This is what is explained in the following:—[*see verse 2185 next*]
