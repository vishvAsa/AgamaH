> “Time is one, all-pervading and eternal,—and yet it is known to be ‘divided’ also, among all things;—just like letters; and it becomes manifested by certain things in certain cases;—when it is manifested in connection with letters, it becomes contributory to the act of expressing (or denoting); and as it exists elsewhere also, its form is regarded as eternal.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 303-304].—(2300-2301)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent—People who have postulated *Time* have regarded it as one, all-pervading and eternal; as has been declared in the following words:—‘Some people regard Time as a substance which is one, eternal and all-pervading,—and something quite apart from the operation of modifiable substances’;—under the circumstances, how can there be any ‘distinctions’ (or divisions) of Time?

The *Mīmāṃsaka’s* answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 2300-2301 above*]

‘*Divided also*’;—the term ‘also’ goes with all that has gone before—it is *one also, eternal also, all-pervading also*; though it has been misplaced in the *Text*.

*Question*:—In what way is it ‘divided’?

*Answer*:—‘*Among all things, like Letters*’.—What is meant is as follows:—Though the Letter, *Ga* for instance, is one only and eternal, yet when it comes to be manifested by a particular Articulation at a particular place then it is known as divided through the divisions of place, etc,; similarly *Time* also; though it pervades over all things, yet when it comes to be manifested by a certain action in regard to a certain object, it becomes known as ‘divided’ or ‘distinct’; and when it is manifested in connection with Letters, *it becomes contributory to the act of expressing*.

*Question*:—If Time is so ‘divided’, how is it regarded as eternal and all-pervading?

*Answer*:—‘*As it exists, etc. etc*.’—‘*Elsewhere*’—i.e. in Creepers, Leaves of trees and so forth;—because it exists in these also, its *eternality* and *allpervasiveness* become recognised and established.—‘Eternality’ alone is mentioned in the *Text*, by way of illustration.—(2300-2301)
