> Even in cases of proximity, the embellishment is supposed to be the cause (of the cognition); and this embellishment would be equally there for persons at a distance also.—(2568) 
>
> If the idea is that particular embellishments are produced by articulations, then in that case, no one can deny the idea of the sound being produced. Because the particular embellishment is not something different from the word-sound; otherwise the word-sound would be incognisable. consequently the word-sound also should be regarded as produced.—(2569-2570)



## Kamalaśīla

[*verse 2568*]:

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka*, in *Text* 2270, that—“Inasmuch as the idea of the Word-Sound being *produced* has been rejected, etc. etc.” The answer to this is as follows:—[see *verses 2569-2570 above*]:

[*verses 2569-2570*]:

If the Embellishment is something that is *produced*, then there should be *production* of the Word-Sound also; because it is not different from the Embellishment.—In case it is different, then, as the Cognition would be brought about by the Embellishment itself, the Word-Sound would not be an active agent in it; and hence it would not be apprehended by that Cognition. For these reasons it should be admitted that the Word-Sound also is *produced*.—(2569-2570)

The following might be urged—“Just as for you, the Buddhist, the Word-Sound is produced as capable of bringing about a particular restricted cognition,—so also for us, there is restriction in regard to the Embellishment also; whereby the Sound is not heard by people at a distance The answer to this is as follows”.—(2568-2570)
