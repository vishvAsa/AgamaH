> “If it be urged that—‘that other word also (which did not exist at the time of the convention) may be expressive through its own inherent aptitude’,—then, in that case, in the absence of any fixed rule, there could be no certainty as to which is the word that is really expressive.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 245-246].—(2237)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* anticipates and answers an argument of the Opponent:—[*see verse 2237 above*]

‘*Other Word*’—i.e. if the Word that exists at the time of its use is held to be expressive, through its own inherent aptitude, like the Word that existed at the time of the Convention;—that cannot be right; because in the absence of a fixed rule, there could be no certainty as to which Word is expressive of which meaning.—(2237)
