> In the case of such words as ‘*ananyāpoha*’ (‘non-exclusion of others’), what is comprehended cannot be something positive, as desired by the other party; because the universal and such other likely positive denotations have been already discarded.—(1163) 
>
> In fact, the conception that follows from this word envisages something positive; and it is only later on that there appears the idea of the negation (exclusion) of what is denoted by the word ‘Apoha’.—(1164)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 979, by *Kumārila*) that—“nothing is comprehended in the case of such words as ‘Non-exclusion of others’ (‘*ananyāpoha*’)”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1163 above*]

It is true that, in reality, nothing positive,—in the shape of the *Universal*, etc. is comprehended; because all these have been rejected in detail in the Chapters dealing with the *Universal*, etc.—(1163)

*Question*:—“What, then, is it that is comprehended?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1164 next*]
