> It is the first of these Apohas that is expressed by words; because the cognition brought about by words apprehends the external object.—(1011)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Having thus set forth the nature of the three kinds of ‘*Apoha*’, the Author proceeds to connect it with the subject-matter under discussion, the *Denotation of Words*:—[*see verse 1011 above*]

‘*First*’—i.e. that which consists in the Reflection of the object, as described above (in *Text*, 1006).

The reason for this is explained—‘*Because the cognition, etc. etc*.’;—that alone should be regarded as the ‘denotation of words’ which actually appears in the Verbal Cognition;—and as a matter of fact, in Verbal Cognition, there is no apprehension of *Negation Absolute*, nor that of the ‘Specific Individuality’, as there is in Sense-cognition; what actually appears in it is that Verbal Cognition only which apprehends the external object. Hence it is only the reflection of the External Object, which appears directly in Verbal Cognition as identical with it, that can be rightly held to be the denotation of the word.—(1011)
