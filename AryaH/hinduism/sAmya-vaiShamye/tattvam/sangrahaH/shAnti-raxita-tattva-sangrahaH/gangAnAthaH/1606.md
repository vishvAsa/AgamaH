## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

After the compound ending with ‘*Sambaddha*’, the phrase ‘*Śabdaḥ anuvartate*’ is understood.

Thus then, because the Word connected with the Cognition producible by the Embellished Organ continues for all time,—therefore it follows that even for the man whose Auditory Organ has not been embellished, the said Cognition would be there; so that there would be no use for the Embellishment of the Auditory Organ.—(2505)
