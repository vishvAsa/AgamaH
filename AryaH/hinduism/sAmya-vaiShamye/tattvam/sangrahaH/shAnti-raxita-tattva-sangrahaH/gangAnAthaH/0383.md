> “‘Bondage’ and ‘liberation’ must belong to the same person,—because they are of that nature,—like bondage and liberation in the ordinary world.—Thus everything becomes thoroughly well-established.”—(499)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The argument may be thus formulated:—*Bondage* and *Liberation* must subsist in one and the same person,—like the Bondage and Liberation in the world,—the ‘Bondage’ and ‘Liberation’ under dispute are Bondage and Liberation in the form of Attachment and Dissociation therefrom;—this is a reason based upon the nature of things.

‘*Because they are of that nature*’;—i.e. because they are in the form of Bondage and Liberation, i.e. because they have the character of Bondage and Liberation.

‘*Tau*’, ‘these two’—i.e. Bondage and Liberation.

Thus the single substratum in the shape of the ‘Soul’ being established, all the doctrines relating to the Relation between Actions and their Results and so forth *become thoroughly established*;—i.e. are beautifully proved; there being no *room* for the criticisms directed against them.—(499)
