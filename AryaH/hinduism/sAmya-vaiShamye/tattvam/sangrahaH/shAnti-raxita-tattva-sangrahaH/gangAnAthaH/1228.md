## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Then again, the capacity of ‘Birth’ and the rest to produce their effects is limited to their respective capacity; and this capacity of theirs is there at all times; hence they should produce their effects at all times. It cannot be urged that there is absence of the ‘Causal Factor’ (which prevents the production). Because the Causal Factor also is there at all times. Thus then, as Birth and the rest would be producing their effects in the ‘past’ and ‘future’ states also,—one and the same ‘state’ should include all the States, of which thus there need be no division.—(1829-1830)
