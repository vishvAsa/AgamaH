> It is not possible for the relationship to be real and one. because the things denoted being distinct and diverse, there would be no relationship at all.—(2626)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“Why is not the Relationship regarded to be *really* one only,—and why should it be regarded as illusory (assumed)”?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2626 above*]:

The one Relationship, when there, could subsist either in different, or non-different, things.—It cannot subsist in different things; because each thing rests within itself in its own distinct form; and there can be no intermixture.—If it were in non-different things, then, as the entity would be one only, wherewith would there be any Relationship? So that there would be no Relationship at all.—(2626)
