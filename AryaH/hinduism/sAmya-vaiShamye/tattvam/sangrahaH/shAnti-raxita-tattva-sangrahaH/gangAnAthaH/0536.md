> Thus ‘going’ and the rest are impossible either in permanent or impermanent things; because it is not possible for them either to be separated from their former place, or to get at another place.—(706)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Thus*’,—i.e. because it has been discarded by Inference and Perception, as just shown above.

‘*Because it is not possible*, *etc. etc*.’;—i.e. because separation from the former place is not possible; and because junction with another place is not possible. The words are to be construed in the respective order.—(706)
