> “by what has gone before, there can be no inference either, in this case; and for the same reason there can be no conception of any connection of this.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 79]—(940)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It might be argued that—“the *Apoha* may not be apprehended by the Sense-organs; it could be apprehended by means of Inference”.—This is answered in the following—[*see verse 940 above*]

‘*What has gone before*’,—under *Text* 934, above.

‘*There can be no*, *etc. etc*.’;—*connection of this*—i.e. with the *Word*.

The particle ‘*api*’ is meant to imply that the said absence of diversity is not the only reason.

‘*Tena*’—for the same reason.

Thus it has been shown that the Reason adduced by the *Bauddha* (against the denotation of Words)—‘because no Convention can be made’—is ‘inconclusive’; inasmuch as the application of words to the *Apoha* is admitted, even though no Convention can be made in regard to it.—(940)
