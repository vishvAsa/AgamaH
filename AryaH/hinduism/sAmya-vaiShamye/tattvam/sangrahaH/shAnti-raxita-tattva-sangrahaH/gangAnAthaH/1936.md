> When the inference is brought about by the indicative (probans) in the shape of its nature and its effect,—the indicative whereof the ‘infallibility’ has been ascertained,—there can be no mistake in it.—(3093)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that there can be no Infinite Regress even when validity is proved by means of Inference:—[*see verse 3093 above*]

‘*Ātmā*’ *nature*,—and ‘effect’;—such being the name of the Indicative (Probans);—of which Indicative, the ‘infallibility’ has been duly ascertained.

What is meant is as follows:—When the ‘nature’ and ‘effect’ of the Probans has been duly ascertained on the basis of ‘sameness’ and ‘causal relation,’—and on the strength of these Probans, there follows the Inference,—this Inference is valid by itself; as there can be no room for mistake in such Inference,—Thus there would be no Infinite Regress.—(3093)
