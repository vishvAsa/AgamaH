> Each of the two alternatives—that the two are different and non-different—having thus been severally rejected, the idea that the condition is both (different and non-different) also becomes discarded.—(407)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author next takes up the views that both (the Permanent Thing and the Conditions) are both *different* and *non-different*:—[*see verse 407 above*]

The rejection of each of the two alternatives naturally implies the rejection of both alternatives; as the *two alternatives together* do not differ from the two alternatives treated severally.—Further (between two contradictories), the acceptance or rejection of one must imply the rejection or acceptance, respectively, of the other; hence it cannot be right to regard the existing thing as being both *different* and *non-different* (from the Conditions); as the same thing cannot be both affirmed and denied at the same time; otherwise it would cease to be *one*.—(407)

The following Text shows that this has already been explained before, in course of the examination of the doctrine of the ‘*Pudgala*’ (section F, chapter VII) and the rest.—[*see verse 408 next*]
