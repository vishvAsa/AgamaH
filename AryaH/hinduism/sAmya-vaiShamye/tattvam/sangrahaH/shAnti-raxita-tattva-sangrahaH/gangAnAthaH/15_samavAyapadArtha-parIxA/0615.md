> The expressions of ‘being contained’ and ‘subsisting’ and the like also are based upon the same ‘inherence’; hence these also cannot be the basis of restriction.—(850)



## Kamalaśīla

“The restriction could be based upon such common expressions as ‘The Universal *Substance* is contained—subsists—in Substances only’.”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 850 above*]

The use of expressions like ‘being contained’, ‘subsisting’ and so forth also are explained by you as based upon the same ‘Inherence’; and as this is the same everywhere, how could it serve to restrict anything? Hence these notions of ‘contained in’, etc. cannot serve as the basis of restricting the relation of Container and Contained. Because the notions in question stand upon the same footing as this latter relation.—(850)
