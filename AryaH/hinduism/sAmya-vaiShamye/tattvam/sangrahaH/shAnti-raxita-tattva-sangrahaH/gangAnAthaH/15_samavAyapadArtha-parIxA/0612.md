> If inherence is one only, then any restriction regarding the container and contained is impossible. the universal ‘substance’ is held to subsist in substance only;—how could that be due to inherence? this same inherence of the substance is present in quality, etc. also; as these latter are related to the universals ‘quality’, etc.;—and inherence is the same in both.—(846-847)



## Kamalaśīla

According to us, there is no such relation of *Container and Contained* as is held to subsist between the Universal ‘Colour’ and the particular Colour; it is admitted by you only; and this is impossible for you who regard Inherence to be one only. These and other incongruities in the Opponent’s standpoint are now pointed out, For instance, the Opponent accepts the restriction that the Universal ‘Substance’ subsists in Substances alone; and he does so on the basis of ‘Inherence’;—now the ‘Inherence’ of the Universal as ‘Substance’ is present in Qualities also; because those are related to the Universal ‘Quality’.

*Question*:—“Even though the Relation is there, how is it concluded that that Relation is that of Inherence?”

*Answer*:—‘*Inherence is the same in both* ‘*Both*’—i.e. the two Universals ‘Substance’ and ‘Quality Thus the notions having the same basis in both eases, admixture and confusion are inevitable.—(846-847)
