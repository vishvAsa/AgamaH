> If the ‘container’ and the ‘contained’ were perceived as distinct from one another, then alone would there be any such notion as ‘this subsists in that’,—as is found in the case of the fruits and the pit (where the fruits lie);—the cloth and the yarns however are never perceived as distinct from one another,—by virtue of which there could appear any such notions as ‘this subsists in those’.—(828-829)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It is only when two things have been found to be distinct from one another, when one is found to be contained in the other, that there appears the notion that ‘this subsists in that’; such is our ordinary experience; as is found in the case of the notion ‘these *Bel* fruits are contained in this pit’. In the case of the Cloth and the Yarns however no such difference has been perceived; in fact, no such difference exists; how then could there be any such notion as ‘the Cloth subsists in the Yarns’.—(828-829)
