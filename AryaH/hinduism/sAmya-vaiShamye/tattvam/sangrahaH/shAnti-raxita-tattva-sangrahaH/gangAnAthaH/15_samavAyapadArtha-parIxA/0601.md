> “Inherence (subsistence) is apprehended on the basis of the notion of ‘this subsists in that’,—such as is found in the expressions ‘the cloth consists of (subsists in) these yarns’, ‘the mat consists of (subsists in) the reeds’.”—(823)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* proceed to set forth objections to the Category of ‘Inherence’:—[*see verse 823 above*]

“In regard to things that are inseparable, and among things where one is the container and the other the contained,—there is the notion of ‘this subsisting in that’; and the relation upon which this notion is based is ‘Inherence (Subsistence)’, This is apprehended as something different from Substance and the other categories, on the basis of the particular notions of ‘subsistence’ present in such conceptions as ‘the Cloth subsists in these yarns’,—In the ease of such Universals as ‘Being’, ‘Substance’ and the rest, it is found that they bring about cognitions like their own, of their substratum,—and on this basis they are regarded as different from one another and also from their substratum;—the same is found to be the case with ‘Inherence’ also; in regard to all the other five categories, there are such notions as—‘The Universal Substance subsists in this substance’, ‘the Universal Quality subsists in this quality’, ‘the Universal Action subsists in this action’, ‘the Ultimate Individualities subsist in these substances’ and so forth; and on the basis of these notions, it is concluded that Inherence is something distinct from these ñve (Substance and the rest).—This argument may be formulated thus:—When a notion is found to appear in regard to a thing in a form different from that of thatng, that notion must be based upon something different from that thing,—for example, the notion of ‘the man with the stick’ in regard to Devadatta;—of this same kind is the notion of ‘this subsists in that’ that appears in regard to the five Categories;—and this is regarded as justifying the conclusion (that the notion is due to a distinct category in the shape of Inherence).”—(823)
