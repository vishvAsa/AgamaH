“In that case the Restriction may be due to the limitations relating to the capacity *to manifest and be manifested*”.

*Answer*:—[*see verse 851 above*]

Substances have been held to be the *manifester* of the Universal ‘Substance’,—and this on the strength of Inherence itself; because it is on account of the fact that the Universal ‘Substance’ *inheres* in a particular substance that it is said to be manifested by it.

‘*It cannot be due to anything else*’ i.e. to any such circumstance as *the production of the character capable of bringing about an idea*, which has been postulated by the Buddhist. Because Inherence has been held to exist even in eternal things like ‘Being’ and the like,—and it is not right that there should be any ‘production’ of what are eternal.—(851)
