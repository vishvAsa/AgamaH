> That the conjunction in the case of the curd and the pit is one only has been already rejected by us before; any restriction on that basis is not possible; as that would lead to absurdities.—(583)



## Kamalaśīla

^(‘)*Before*’—i.e. in the Chapter on the Refutation of the Quality of Conjunction.

Conjunction may be one only, yet the objection remains—this is what is shown in the text—‘*Any restriction, etc*.’.

‘*On that basis*’,—i.e. on the basis of Conjunction.

The ‘absurdity’ referred to lies in the possibility of such notions as ‘the Pit in the Curd’; as the only ground for it—in the shape of Conjunction, -would be equally available in this also.—(853)
