> As a matter of fact, the words uttered by a man are not exactly those used by others; as there are always differences of accent and other details.—These latter are not properties belonging to the manifesting agency; because they are always perceived in the form of letters. Consequently the letters pronounced by each man must be regarded as distinct,—like the jar and such things. This difference being quite clear, why are you denying the signs of that difference?—(2680-2681)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Accents*’—such as the ‘*Udātta*’ and the rest.

‘*Other details*’—including swiftness, slowness, and middling.

‘*These are not properties, etc*. *etc*.’—‘*These*’—i.e. Accent, etc.

“Why?”

Because these Accents, etc. are always perceived in the shape of Letters; i.e. they are known as such.

‘*The signs of that*’—The signs of the difference of the Letters.

‘*Why are you denying*’—in the words ‘there is no other sign for you’ (*Text* 2291).—(2680-2681)
