> If many things—such as the cognitions of colour, sound and the rest,—were the effects of a single continuous (permanent) cause,—then any order of sequence among such effects would be incongruous; as their efficient cause would be always there.—(197)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“How is it ascertained that the notion in question is *wrong*?”

The answer is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 197 above*]

If the cognitions of the *Blue* and the rest were the effect of a single such Cause as the ‘Soul’, which is *eternal*, continues for all time, past and future,—then any order of sequence among such cognitions would be incongruous; as the efficient Cause being present, all the effects should appear simultaneously; specially as the eternal Cause cannot need the help of anything else; for the simple reason that it cannot be helped by anything else.—(197)
