> If the one ‘sound-essence’ be held to be different with each individual thing, then all things would occupy the same point in space and would be cognised in one and the same form.—(136)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text proceeds to set forth another method of criticising the ‘Sound’ theory:—[*see verse 136 above*]

When (according to you) the ‘Sound-essence’ undergoes modification, does it become different with each object, or not?—If the view is that it does *not* become different, then all things, Blue and the rest, should occupy the same point in space. That they should occupy the same point in space is said only by way of illustration. Time, modifications, functions and conditions also are meant to be included. The Cognition,—appearance (in Consciousness)—also would he in one and the same form; as all things, Blue and the rest, would be non-diiferent from the one essence of *Sound*.—(136)
