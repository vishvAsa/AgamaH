> If, from sound which is of one form always, diverse forms are produced, then how is it that the world is spoken of as ‘evolved’ in the form of the object?—(141)



## Kamalaśīla

Further, if it is admitted that out of Sound, which is of one form only, various diverse forms are produced,—then it will not be true to say that ‘*Brahman* evolves into the form of the Object’; because it is not right that when a different thing is produced, one thing should evolve out of another in that form, without actually entering into that form itself.—Thus the Proposition set up by the other Party cannot be maintained in any way at all.—(141)
