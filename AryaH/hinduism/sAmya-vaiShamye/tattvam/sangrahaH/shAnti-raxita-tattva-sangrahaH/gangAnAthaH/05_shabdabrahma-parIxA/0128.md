> Even so, what is actually perceived in the form of blue and the; rest by persons tramelled by nescience which form serves as the basis of rejecting and acquiring certain things,—apart from that form, what is there in the form of ‘Brahman’, unperceived, which could be cognised as ‘existing by persons whose mind has risen above (the shackles of nescience)?—(145-146)



## Kamalaśīla

The existence of the cognisable thing can be established only by means of Proofs (Means of Cognition); there is however no proof for (means of cognising) the existence of *Brahman* as postulated. For instance, It cannot be proved by Perception, as *Brahman* does not appear in any form other than the *Blue* and the rest as the basis of such activity as *rejecting* and *acquiring*;—and when It does not appear at all (in any pure form of Its own), how could It be cognised as *existing*, by persons whose minds have risen (above the shackles of Nescience) and are centred on the path of Reason?—(145-146)
