> If there were no cognition of it (sound), then there should be none of the blue and other things also; because both are of the same essence. in case they had different properties, there would be absolute difference between them.—(134)



## Kamalaśīla

If you do not admit of the Cognition of Sound (at the time of the cognition of the Blue, etc.) then there would be the absurdity of there being no cognition of the Blue, etc. also, just as there is none of Sound;—*because both are of the same essence*;—that is, Blue and the rest are of the same nature as Sound. Otherwise, if the Blue, etc. be held to have properties different from those of Sound, it would have to be admitted that the two are absolutely and entirely different.—(134)

The following *Text* explains why it would be so:—[*see verse 135 next*]
