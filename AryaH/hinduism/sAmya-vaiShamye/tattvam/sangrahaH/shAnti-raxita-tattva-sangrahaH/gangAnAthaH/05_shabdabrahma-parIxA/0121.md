> If (on the other hand) it differs with each individual (thing), then brahman becomes many,—as having a form which is diverse and of the nature of several things,—just like the diversity of individuals.—(137)



## Kamalaśīla

If the ‘Sound-essence’ is admitted to differ with each individual, then *Brahman* becomes *many*;—*as having a form which is diverse and of the* *nature* *of several things*; i.e. one whose nature—character—is diverse and of the nature of several things;—and yet *Brahman* is held to be *one*. Thus your theory goes directly against your own tenet.—(137)
