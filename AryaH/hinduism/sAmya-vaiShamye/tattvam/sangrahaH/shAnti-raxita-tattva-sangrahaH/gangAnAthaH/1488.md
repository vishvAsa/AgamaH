> “Thus it is that the letters, following up the properties of the articulation which appear there as eternal, become expressive of diverse meanings.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 301].—(2298)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *text* sums up the discussion:—[*see verse 2298 above*]

‘*Properties of the Articulation*’,—such as sequential Order, greater or less intensity, limitation in space and so forth.

‘*Which appear there as eternal*’,—through the *Universals*.

‘*Following up*’—in accordance with.—(2298)

Thus, it has been explained in detail that, if on account of their being eternal and all-pervading, Letters cannot have any Order, etc. by themselves,—even so, all this Order, etc., really belonging to the manifesting Articulations, become attributed to the Letters and thereby become contributories to the comprehension of the meaning of (the Word).
