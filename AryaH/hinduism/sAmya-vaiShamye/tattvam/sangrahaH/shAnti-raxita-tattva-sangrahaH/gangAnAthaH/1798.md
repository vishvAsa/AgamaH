> “In the bringing about of their own validity and the definite cognition of the object,—the cognitions are self-sufficient, and not dependent on other causes;—and in this their action is like that of the jar and other things.”—(2850)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The compound ‘*prāmāṇyārtha*, *etc*.’ is to be expounded as the‘*prāmāṇya*’—validity—and the ‘*artha*’—Object;—the ‘*viniściti*’,—Cognition, of the said two; in the ‘*janana*’—producing, bringing about of the said cognition.—‘*Arthaniściti*’ here stands for mere *observance*, the vague non-determinate cognition; because the subsequent determinate cognitions are in the nature of *certainty* itself.

‘*Action*,’ is *activity*, causal character.—(2850)

The following *Texts* explain the example of the ‘Jar’ as cited above.—[*see verses 2851-2852 next*]
