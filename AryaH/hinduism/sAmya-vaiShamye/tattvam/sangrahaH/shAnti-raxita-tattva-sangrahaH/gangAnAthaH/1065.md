## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Objection*:—‘*Similarity* resides in two things; how then can it be perceived in the *Gavaya* alone (the other thing, the Cow, not being before the eyes)?’

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1532 above*]

The term ‘*sāmānyavat*’, means that it is *like the Universal*.

Even though *similarity* lies between two members, yet, like the Universal, it resides in its entirety in each member; it is for this reason that even when the co-relative, in the shape of the *Cow* (in the case in question) is not perceived, the *similarity* is actually perceived in the other member (*Gavaya*) which is before the eyes.—(1532)
