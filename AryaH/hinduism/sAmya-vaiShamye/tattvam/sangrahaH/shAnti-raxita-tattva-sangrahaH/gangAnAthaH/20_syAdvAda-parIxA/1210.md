> This is not right; because of the absence of a common substratum; production, continuance and destruction cannot have the same substratum; for if they had, it would involve the presence at the same time of all these mutually contradictory properties. All this would be free from difficulties under the doctrine of ‘perpetual flux’; for why should any man be sorry at the absolute destruction of gold in the form of the pot? Why too should there be any joy at the production of the gold in the new form of the dish? As for continuance, there is none, of anything at all.—(1780—1783).



## Kamalaśīla

The principal sentence is ‘*because of the absence of a common substratum*’; this is explained in what follows—‘*Production*, *Continuance, etc*. *etc*.’—If a single entity had the three aspects of *Production* and the rest,—then it would mean that all these three—Production, Continuance and Destruction—are there in the thing at one and the same time; and yet it cannot be possible for these mutually contradictory properties to be present in anything at one and the same time; as otherwise, they would not be contradictories at all.

*Question*—“How then can there be the three notions described?”

In *answer* to this the *Text* shows how this is possible—‘*All this*, *etc. etc*.’

When the *Gold in the shape of the Pol* is destroyed by itself—why should any man so wanting it be sorry for it? Why too, on the production of a new thing in the shape of the *Dish* out of the Gold, should one be happy? As for *continuance*, there can be no such thing for anything of the nature of Gold; as both Production and Destruction are absolute without any connection with anything (past or future).—(1780-1783)

*Question*:—“If that be so, then how is there the feeling of *Indifference*?” *Answer*:—[*see verses 1784-1785 next*]
