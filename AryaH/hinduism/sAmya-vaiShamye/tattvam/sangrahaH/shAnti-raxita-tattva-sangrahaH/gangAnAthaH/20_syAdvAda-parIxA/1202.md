> It is in that same form that it is understood to be similar, because the cause of such understanding is present, in the shape of being the cause of one and the same conception, as differentiating these from other things.—(1758)



## Kamalaśīla

It is in the same form that it is said to be ‘similar’,—because they form the basis of the same conception. What is meant is that those that do not form the basis of the same conception are treated as ‘dissimilar’, while those that do serve as that basis are regarded as ‘similar’.—(1758)
