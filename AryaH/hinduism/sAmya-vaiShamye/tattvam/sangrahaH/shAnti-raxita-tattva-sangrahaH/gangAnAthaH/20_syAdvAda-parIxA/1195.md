> “As in the case of the variegated colour, one may emphasise any one colour as he chooses,—because the colour is variegated,—in the same way ‘difference’ or ‘non-difference’ of an entity might be emphasised.—(*Ślokavārtika-ākṛti*, 57-58).—When a thing of a mixed character is cognised simultaneously, then all distinctions like ‘difference’, ‘sameness’ and so forth, disappear—(*ibid*., 62-63).”—(1745-1746)



## Kamalaśīla

The author puts forward—from Kumārila’s point of view—the objection against the Buddhist argument, the objection that the Reason put forward is ‘Inconclusive’;—[*see verses 1745-1746 above*]

‘*Kalmūṣa-varṇa*’—is the *variegated colour*.—In this case one can fix upon, as he wishes, upon any of the several colours present—regarding the thing either as *Blue*, or *Yellow* or *Red*;—in the same manner, in the case of the Entity which has a *variegated* or *mixed* character,—being *existent* in its own form, and also *non-existent* in the form of other things,—and also having the two-fold character of the General and the Particular,—one can fix upon *Unity* or *Diversity*, as he likes. When a man wishes to emphasise the diversity -aspect, then he fixes upon *diversity*; and when he all at once cognises a, thing as being both General and Particular,—then all that has been urged regarding its *difference* or *non-difference*, etc. disappears; i.e, it does not apply at all; because what is clearly cognised through Perception is the thing of the mixed character. The objection that has been urged regarding the thing being *different* or *non-different*, etc. etc. is as follows (*a*) The *General* thing being *non-different* from the Particular things in the shape of the Horse, etc. should also have a diversity of forms like these particular things;—(*b*) the Particular things, being *non-different* from the General, all Particular things should become the same, like the General thing;—(c) how could *difference* and *non-difference*, which are mutually contradictory, reside in the General and the Particular? The other objections are such as—*Unity* and *Plurality* being mutually contradictory, how can one and the same thing be *General* as well as *Particular*?—(1745-1746)

It might be argued against the above (argument of *Kumārila’s*) that—‘If so, then in all cases, there would be cognition of the *Mixed Character*, and it would not be successive and simultaneous’.

The answer to this (from Kumārila’s point of view) may be as follows:—[*see verse 1747 next*]
