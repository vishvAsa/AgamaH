> Things are said to be ‘one’ when it is said ‘this is that’; whereas they are said to be ‘diverse’ when it is said ‘this is not that being that and not being that thus being mutually contradictory, cannot, in any way, be attributed to any one entity.—(1728-1729)



## Kamalaśīla

When it is stated categorically that ‘this is that’, t hen the things are said to be ‘one’; as in the case of Consciousness and Spirit. On the other hand, when the identity between things is denied, they are said to be ‘diverse, different’; as in the ease of Matter and Consciousness. As it is impossible for both affirmation and denial to pertain to any one thing, there is clear contradiction between ‘Unity’ and ‘Plurality’, which are based respectively upon the said identity and difference. Hence any diversity of properties of a single entity can be only a creation of fancy.—(1728-1729)
