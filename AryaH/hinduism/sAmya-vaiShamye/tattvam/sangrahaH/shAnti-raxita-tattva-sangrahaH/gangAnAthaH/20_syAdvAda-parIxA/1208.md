> “When the pot is broken up and a dish is made (of the same gold), the man wanting the former becomes sorry, while the man wanting the latter becomes glad, while one wanting only the gold remains neutral. thus the thing has three aspects; and the said three ideas would not be possible if there were no production, continuance and destruction of things.”—[Ślokavārtika-vanavāda, 21-22].—(1777-1778)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* set forth Rumania’s view on the subject:—[*see verses 1777-1778 above*]

*Kumārila* argues as follows:—“Inasmuch as all things are capable of being born, continuing to exist and being destroyed,—they have three aspects. That this is so is shown by the fact that a single thing can bring about three effects: For instance, when the Pot is broken up and made into a Dish, sorrow is produced in the man who wanted the former, while pleasure is produced in one who wanted the latter, while there is indifference in the man who wanted only gold. If the thing had only one aspect, then the idea produced by it would be of only one kind, not of three kinds.

‘*Vardhamānaka*’ and ‘*Rucaka*’ are particular kinds of utensils.—(1778)
