> “If the intended entity is entirely not-equal to other things, then it ceases to be an entity; for that which is excluded from ‘entity’, where could there be any other position, except non-existence,—as in the case of the ‘sky-flower’? Thus then, one who wishes the entity to be not-equal to the ‘sky-flower’ must accept the universal ‘entity’ as the character common to all entities—(1711-1713) 
>
> “If it were not as asserted, then, to what would this fact be due—that the common notion of ‘entity’ does not appear in connection with the ‘crow’s teeth’, while it always appears as restricted to entities alone?—If it be urged that—the said restriction is due to similarity’,—then our answer is that, that same (similarity) is what we call ‘commonalty’.—This same remark applies also to the view that ‘the said restriction is due to a certain capacity in the nature of things’.—Absolute difference (from other entities) therefore is not possible for any entity; because entities do not differ from each other, on the point of being ‘entities’.”—(1714-1716)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* set forth another argument in favour of the view that every entity has a *commonalty*, a general character:—[*see verse 1714-1716 above*]

‘*If* *it were not*, *etc*. *etc*.’—If an entity were ‘not-equal’ to—different from—every other entity,—then how is it that the common idea of ‘being an *entity*’ is found to appear only in connection with the Jar and such things, and not in connection with the ‘crow’s teeth’ (and other non-entities)? The basis for this has to be explained.

It might be urged that—‘the basis for this lies in the *similarity* (among entities)’.

Then it becomes established that- that same *Similarity* is the ‘Commonalty’, the Common character; ‘similarity’ being synonymous with ‘*Commonalty*’ (Common character).

It might be explained that—‘the said comprehensive potency subsists in the Jar and other *entities* only, and not in the Crow’s Teeth and such *non-entities*; hence ‘the capacity of the nature of things’ is what forms the basis of the notion in question’.

This view also is dispensed with by what has been just explained; i.e. the answer to this is the same as that to the view regarding ‘Similarity’; because the said *capacity* may be regarded as the required ‘Commonalty’.

From all this it follows that, *in the form of* ‘*entities*’, all things—the Jar and the rest—are *not-different* from one another.—(1714-1716)
