> “The entity itself is only one in essence, but is regarded as having several aspects; and these aspects are there in the form of being apprehended by inclusive and exclusive cognitions; the former ones, being inclusive, are spoken of as ‘common’ (universal, general), while the latter, being exclusive, are called ‘particular’.—(1720-1721)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus established the fact that every entity has the two-fold character—the *General* and the *Particular*, the Jaina proceeds to show that these two aspects serve as the basis of usage free from all confusion:—[*see verse 1720-1721 above*]

“The real truth of the matter is as follows:—Like the gleaming Sapphire, every entity, while being one, has several aspects; of these aspects, some are apprehended by *inclusive* notions, and others by *exclusive* notions. Those that are apprehended by *inclusive* notions are *inclusive* and hence spoken of as ‘Common’, while others, which are apprehended by *inclusive* notions, are *exclusive* and hence said to be ‘Particular’. The *inclusive notion* appears in the one *non-distinctive* form of ‘Entity’; while the *exclusive notion* appears *in* the *distinctive* form ‘this *in* *jar, not Cloth*’.”—(1720-1721)

The following *Texts* proceed to refute the above *Jaina* view:—[*see verses 1722-1723 next*]
