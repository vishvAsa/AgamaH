> It cannot be as explained above. that what is ‘variegated’ cannot be ‘one’ has just been pointed out. ‘variegation’ consists in ‘several forms’, and it can never be concomitant with ‘unity’.—All the real forms that there may be of a certain thing would be so many (different) things; and the thing in question itself remains only one.—(1748-1749)



## Kamalaśīla

The idea that ‘a single entity is variegated’ involves a contradiction in terms, as already explained under *Text* 1734 above; and the reason for this is that the term ‘variegated’ itself connotes Plurality; and between ‘Unity’ and ‘Plurality’ there is ‘contradiction’ consisting in the fact of the presence of one implying the absence of the other. Consequently one thing cannot have several *real* forms. Even if it had,—this fact would not prove the *plurality* of the single thing; as all that it would mean would be that there are so many things come about; but that also only if these forms could be proved to be *real*. But in no case can *Plurality* belong to what is *one*, as the two are mutually contradictory.—(1748-1749)
