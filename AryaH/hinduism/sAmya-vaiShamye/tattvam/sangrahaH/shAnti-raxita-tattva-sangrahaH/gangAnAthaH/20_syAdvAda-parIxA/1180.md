## Kamalaśīla

It has been declared in the Introductory bases (*Text*, 3) that the ‘True Doctrine’ is ‘not mixed up with any foreign element, to the smallest detail—In support of this idea, the Author proceeds with the next chapter; and starts off with an objection (from the standpoint of the other Party):—[*see verse 1709 above*]

It has been asserted (under *Text* 1675, above) that ‘What is capable of effective action is said to be *existent*,—other than that is said to be *nonexistent*,—the two cannot exist together in the same substratum, as they are contradictory’,

Against this, *Āhrīka* (a Jaina writer) and others urge the following objections:—

“*Every entity has more than one aspect^*—the *General* and the *Particular*; just like the lustrous gem which appears to be of variegated colour; why then should there be any contradiction (incompatibility) between *existence* and *non-existence*,—in view of which it is said that ‘the two cannot coexist in the same substratum’?—The term ‘*ādi*’ in ‘*sadādi*’ is meant to include ‘activity and inactivity’, ‘unity’ and so forth”.

Though this objection has been already refuted under *Text* 1676. by the sentence ‘*Nanu tadetaddhi*, *etc*.’, yet it has been introduced here for the purpose of expounding the matter in detail, or for setting forth a fresh theory.—(1709)
