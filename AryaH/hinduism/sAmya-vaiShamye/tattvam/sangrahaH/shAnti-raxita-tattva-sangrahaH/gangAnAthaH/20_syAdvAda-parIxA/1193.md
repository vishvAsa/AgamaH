> By their very nature, the said atoms are the basis of the recognition that envisages the salient features of the man and the lion;—as is clear from the fact of its arising from a particular idea. In this same way are the variegated gems and other cases disposed of.—The variegated character, based upon the presence of several forms, is certainly incompatible with unity.—(1736-1737)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“If *Narasiṃha* is only an *aggregate of many atoms*,—then how is it that there is an idea regarding him as being a single entity with a dual character?”

*Answer*—[*see verses 1736-1737 above*]

The Recognition that envisages the features of the body of the Man and the Lion (in the body of *Narasiṃha*),—of that the only cause or basis consists of the atoms (composing those features); what then, would be the use of assuming the *composite* whole (Body)?

If it be asked—Whence this ‘nature’ of the Atoms?—The answer is—‘*As is dear from the fact of its arising out of a particular Idea*’; i.e. because it proceeds from a particular cause; the ‘particular idea’ in this case is in the shape of the past deed leading up to the particular state of existence, and also the factors and other parts of the body peculiar to the particular animal-species.

What has been said regarding the case of *Narasiṃha* also serves to dispose of the case of the glittering gems, etc.;—and it is not necessary to criticise them separately.—(1736-1737)
