## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verse 2591*]:

In the following *Text*, the author refutes the charge of ‘Inconclusiveness against his Reason:—[*see verse 2591 above*]:

That all cognitions would have all things for their object is the Reason that serves to annul the conclusion of the other party.—(2591)

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* in *Text* 2218 that—“When the eye is slightly pressed by the finger, even a single object is perceived as diverse, because of the diversity in the functioning of the eye,—the same thing happens in the case in question also”.

This also is discarded by what has been said above.

[*verse 2592*]:

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under the *Text* 2225, that—“Even granting that the Reflected Image really exists in the different places,—there can be no plurality, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2593 above*]:

[*verse 2593*]:

The idea of the Reflected Image being an entity has been rejected before; where it has been shown that one corporeal object cannot occupy the same place as another and so forth.—(2593)
