> It may be that the existence of a thing cannot be known in the absence of a means of the right cognition of the existing thing. But the mere absence of the means of right cognition cannot bring about certainty regarding its being actually nonexistent.—(555)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Cannot bring about certainty, etc*.’,—as is found in the case of such things as the *Ghost* (which is not *seen*, and yet one cannot be *sure* that it does not exist).—(555)
