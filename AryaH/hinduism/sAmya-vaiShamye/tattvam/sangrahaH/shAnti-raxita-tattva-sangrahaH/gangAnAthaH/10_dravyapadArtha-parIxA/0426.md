> If the producer of atoms is not held to be endowed with the property of existence, on the ground that it does not form the objective of any means of cognising existent things,—[then the answer is as explained in the following text].—(553)



## Kamalaśīla

*Aviddhakarṇa* has put forward the following proof of the Permanence of Atoms.—“What is held to be the producer of Atoms cannot be endowed with the property of *existence*,—because it is not cognised by any Means of Right Cognition indicating *existence*;—like the ‘Hare’s Horns’. The ‘property of existence’ means *the property that should he present in the existing thing*; and the denial of this in the said Cause is what is meant. It means simply that ‘*there is* no Cause productive of the Atom’.”

This is the argument which is anticipated in the following:—[*see verse 553 above*]

The construction of the sentence is—‘*If the Producer of Atoms is not held to he endowed with the property of existence*’.

The term ‘*vidyamānopālambha*, *etc*.’ means that ‘it is not the objective of any such Means of Right Cognition as serves to apprehend the *existent* thing’, The rest is easily intelligible.

What is indicated by this is the argument that the assertion of the impermanence of Atoms is contrary to, and annulled by, Inference; because of the declaration that ‘the existing thing which has no Cause must be permanent’, which proves the *permanence* of Atoms on the ground of there being no cause productive of them.—(553)

The following *Text* explains that the Reason put forward here is not admissible:—[*see verse 554 next*]
