> Just as the baby does not occupy the lap of a second nurse,—so a substance embraced in one could not subsist in another (component).—(609)



## Kamalaśīla

The argument may be formulated as follows:—When a thing is embraced by one thing, it cannot subsist in another thing at the same time;—e.g, when a baby is occupying the lap of one nurse, it cannot occupy the lap of another nurse;—the substance (composite) is embraced by one component;—and thus there is perceived a character which is contrary to your conclusion.

‘*The substance could not subsist in another*’;—this states the first conclusion of the argument.—(609)

The Author next states the argument in support of the contrary of the Opponent’s conclusion, which is thus annulled by it:—[*see verses 610-611 next*]
