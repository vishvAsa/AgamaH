> As a matter of fact, in the matter of the perception of all things,—which exist only in the form of mutual exclusion (negation),—there is the same uncertainty in regard to all their characters and forms.—(587)



## Kamalaśīla

Under the view of the other Philosophers also, whenever anything is apprehended by Perception, there is no certainty in regard to all the forms and characters of that thing; what happens is that it is regarded as perceived to that extent which serves to differentiate it from other things,—and not *all* its forms and characters. Because even if other factors were perceived, there would be no certainty regarding them, and these would be of no practical use, and as such, would be as good as *not-perceived*.

‘*The same uncertainty*’;—i.e. as in the case of the apprehended thing.—(587)
