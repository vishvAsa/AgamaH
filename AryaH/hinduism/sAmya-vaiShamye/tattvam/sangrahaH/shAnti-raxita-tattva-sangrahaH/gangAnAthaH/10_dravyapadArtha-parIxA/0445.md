> If no relation is possible, then how could the property belong to the categories?—If it were held to belong to them merely on the ground of its being produced by them, then there would be others also like it.—(576)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that “the Property of *Existence* could belong to the Categories without any relation”.—The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 576 above*]

So that it would lead to an absurdity.

If it be held that the Property is said to be related to the Six Categories, on account of its being produced by them,—then, there are other things also,—such as Water and the like—which would be ‘*like it*’—i.e. related to things like the Tank and such things, merely on that ground ‘of being produced by them’; and under the circumstances, the postulating of Relations in the shape of ‘Conjunction’ and ‘Inherence’ would be futile.—(576)
