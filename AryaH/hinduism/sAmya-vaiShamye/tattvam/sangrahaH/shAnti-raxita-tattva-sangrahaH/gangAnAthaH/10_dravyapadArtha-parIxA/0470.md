> If it be held that the subsistence of the composite in the components is of the nature of ‘inherence’—then the same considerations as above follow that idea also with equal force.—(612)



## Kamalaśīla

*Uddyotakara* has argued as follows:—“All that the assertion ‘The Composite subsists in the components’ does is to mention two objects, one of which is the *substratum* (container) and another the *subsistent* (the contained), which means that the latter becomes the *subsistent*,—this ‘subsistence’ being of the nature of the contact called ‘Inherence’”.—(*Nyāyavārtika*, 2. 1. 32, page 217, Line 4, etc.).

The answer to this is provided in the following:—[*see verse 612 above*]

Even in regard to this form of *subsistence*, the considerations just urged are applicable,—such as ‘does it subsist in another component in the same form and character as in one component, or in some other form?’; they follow this idea also as if in ferocity, in anger—not tolerating the criticisms emanating from the poor intelligence of the other party.—(612)
