> Apart prom the colour, nothing else is perceived op the nature op something different; and it cannot be right,—even for you—that things should be apprehended by the cognition op something different; as that would lead to an absurdity.—(565)



## Kamalaśīla

The Opponent might argue that—“the Rock-crystal itself is perceived, apart from the Colour”.—This is answered in the following:—[*see verse 565 above*]

As a matter of fact, apart from the *Red Colour, nothing else of the nature of something different*,—i.e. in the shape of the ‘Rock-crystal’—is perceived; as all that is actually perceived is the Red Colour.—If it be urged that “what is perceived as *Red-coloured* is the Rock-crystal itself which is not really *red*”,—then our answer is that ‘*it cannot be right, etc. etc*.’;—i.e. when a Cognition is regarded as appertaining to a particular thing, it is on the basis of the form cognised; if then, the object of the Cognition had a form other than that of the Cognition,—then *Sound* and other things might be the object of the Cognition of *Colour*,—there being no difference between the two cases.—(565)
