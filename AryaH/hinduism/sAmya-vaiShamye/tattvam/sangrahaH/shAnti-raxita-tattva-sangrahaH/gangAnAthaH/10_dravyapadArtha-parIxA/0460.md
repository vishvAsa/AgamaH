> It is only such things as are well known in the world,—such as cloth, body, mountain and so forth,—that have been mentioned by you as ‘composites’;—and as a matter of fact, all men make use of such expressions as ‘the cloth is red—all of it—whole of it—in its totality—completely’,—entirely on the basis of their whim.—Thus the use of verbal expressions being dependent upon the whim of the speaker, we also make use of the expression ‘all of the object would be reddened’; because there can be no check upon speakers.—(596-598)



## Kamalaśīla

It is just the well-known things,—like the *Cloth*, the *Body* and so forth,—that have been put forward by you as ‘composites’; and in regard to all these things the use of such terms as ‘one’ and ‘all’ is also well known; e.g. people are found saying ‘all of this cloth has been coloured’ and so forth.—Such being the whim of speakers,—when there is a desire to speak of the colouring of things like the cloth-piece which occupy a larger space, we also, on the basis of the ordinary notion, make use of the said expression, for the purpose of bringing out the incongruity involved in your view.

Further, tins criticism is applicable to yourself, who regard the gross object as *one*,—not to us; because we do not regard the gross object to be *one*.—(596-598)
