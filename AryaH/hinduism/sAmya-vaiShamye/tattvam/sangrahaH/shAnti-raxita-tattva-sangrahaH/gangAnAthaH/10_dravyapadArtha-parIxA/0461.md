## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“The said criticism cannot apply to us either, because (according to us) the application of the name ‘Cloth’ to its component yarns is only indirect, figurative, based upon their being its cause; so that the use of terms like ‘all’ would be all right”.

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 599 above*]

If it is as you say, then there should be ‘difference in number’; i.e. in all cases, the Plural number should be used—‘all *Cloths* are coloured’; you do not consider it right to use the Singular number in regard to things that are *many*.

It might be argued that—“when the term ‘Cloth’ is used in regard to the component yarns, it is in accordance with the number of the composite object, which term ‘Cloth’ therefore does not abandon the gender and number of what is denoted by it”.

But this also cannot be right; this is what is shown in the second line—‘*There is also no difference, etc. etc*.’; if the applying of the name ‘Cloth’ is figurative (indirect), then the distinction between the cognition of what is *direct* and what is *indirect* would be only a halting one; because as a matter of fact, there is no difference.. For instance, when the expression is used as ‘all of the cloth is coloured’, the idea that it produces is *not* that ‘what is coloured is not the *Cloth*, but the yarns that are its constituent cause

The particle ‘*ca*’ in the *Text* implies, the following argument:—You do not admit that the *Cloth*, being only *one*, is denoted by the term ‘all’; how then can the term ‘all’, without the term ‘Cloth’, be applied to the *components*, on the basis of the Number of the *Cloth*?

Or, the second line may be explained as follows:—The ‘*bheda*’, *diversity*, of the Cognition, is not present in what are regarded as ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’; i.e. different colours are not found in the yams and the Cloth, in the way in which they are found among *Colour, Taste*, and other things; and when the forms of the two are not found to be different, they cannot be regarded as *direct* and *indirect*.—(599)

The following *Text* introduces the answer given by *Śaṅkarasvāmin*:—[*see verse 600 below*]
