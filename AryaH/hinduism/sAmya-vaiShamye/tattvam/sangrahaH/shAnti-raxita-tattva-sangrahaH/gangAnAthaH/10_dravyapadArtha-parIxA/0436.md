> It might be possible too in that case, that it is the white colour (of the rock-crystal) itself that is actually cognised; but such a cognition would be clearly wrong,—like the cognition of the conch being yellow.—(566)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Even granting that a Cognition may have for its object something which has a form different from that of the Cognition itself,—even so, what the other party desire cannot be accomplished.—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 566 above*]

That is, (under the view of the other party) it might be possible that in the case cited, what actually exists apart from the White Substance (Rock-crystal) is the *White Colour*, which is cognised as ‘red—But even so, that does not prove the existence of the *Substance with the Quality*.—The ‘*ca*’ should be construed as after ‘*śuklādayaḥ*’.

‘*The Cognition would he wrong*’,—i.e. not in strict accordance with the real state of things.—(566)
