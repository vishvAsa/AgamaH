> “If there were no gross substances, then the perception of the tree and such things would not be possible; because the atoms are beyond the reach of the senses; nor would the term ‘atom’ (small) be possible; because it is the extremely subtle thing that is so spoken of in relation to a gross substance; hence in the absence of the gross substance, in relation to what would its ‘subtlety’ be?”—(562-563)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus established the difference between the Composite and the Components, the Opponent proceeds to prove the same on the strength of Perception also:—[*see verses 562-563 above*]

If there were no Composite Substance, there would be the anomaly that there would be no Perception at all; as the Atoms themselves are beyond the reach of the Senses.—In the absence of the ‘gross’ thing again, the name ‘Atom’ (Small) itself would not be possible.—Why?—‘*Because it is the extremely, etc*.’—This is easy to understand.—(562-563)
