## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“If the original White Colour does not lie hidden in the Cloth, then how is it that when the Cloth is washed, the White Colour reappears?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 569 above*]

Just as, in the case of Metals which have become bright white by the contact of Fire, the Dark Colour is again subsequently produced,—so in the case in question also, another White Colour is produced in the Cloth. Hence there is no incongruity at all.—(569)
