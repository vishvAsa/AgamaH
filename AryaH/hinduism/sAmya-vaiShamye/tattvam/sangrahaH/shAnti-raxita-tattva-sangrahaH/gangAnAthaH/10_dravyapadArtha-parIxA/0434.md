> In the case op the rock-crystal (cited above), the rock-crystal is perceived as red in colour; and yet, in reality, it cannot be red;—as that would demolish your own theory.—(564)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Text*, the Author proceeds to answer the above arguments (of the Realists):—[*see verse 564 above*]

It has been asserted that “the Rock-crystal and such things are perceived even when their Qualities are not perceived”; but this cannot be admitted; because the said perception, being not in accordance with the reality, must be wrong, and hence baseless. For instance, when the red Hibiscus flower is placed adjacent to the Rock-crystal, the latter is perceived as *Red*, which it is not;—similarly when the Line of Cranes are perceived as *Dark* (in the dark) when they are really *White*. Neither of these two things—Rock-crystal and the Cranes—are really of the Colour as perceived;—i.e. of the *Red* or the *Dark* colour.—“Why?”—*Became that would demolish your own theory*;—i.e. if they were really of the Colour that is perceived, then your theory, just mentioned,—that things are perceived even when their Colour is not perceived,—would become demolished.—(564)
