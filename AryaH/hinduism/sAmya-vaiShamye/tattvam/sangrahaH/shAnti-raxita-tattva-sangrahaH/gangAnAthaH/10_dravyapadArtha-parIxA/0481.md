> ‘Mind’ as distinct from the ‘eye’, etc. is admitted by its also; that idea being regarded as ‘mind’ which appears immediately after the six (cognitions).—If however the mind is regarded as permanent, then there comes the anomaly of cognitions being simultaneous; thus the reason put forward by you becomes destructive of what is desired.—(631-632)



## Kamalaśīla

As regards the argument adduced for proving the existence of *Mind*,—if the mere fact of certain notions having a cause in general is meant to be proved, then it is superfluous.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verses 631-632 above*]

If what is meant to be proved is the *eternal* and *one* Mind, then the conclusion is one that is annulled by Inference, and the Reason is ‘Contradictory’. This is what is shown by the words ‘*If however, etc*. *etc*.’

‘*Destructive of what is desired*’;—because what it proves is only the dependence (of the notions cited) upon an *impermanent* (fleeting) cause which is distinct from the Eye and other organs. Otherwise, if they had an *eternal* Cause, as the Cause would always be present in its perfect form, the successive appearance of Cognitions would be incongruous.—(631-632)
