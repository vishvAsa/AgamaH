> “Inasmuch as the object is of one uniform character, to what would the use of the term ‘*sarva*’ (‘all’) be due? Because that term denotes more than one individual thing, while the composite is not of the nature of many individuals.”—(595)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Uddyotakara* has argued as follows—“As there can be no diversity in any *one* thing, the term ‘all’ cannot be rightly applied to it; then how can there be the use of the term ‘all’, on the basis whereof *all* (*sarva*) of it could be said to be *covered?*”

This objection is expounded in the following—[*see verse 595 above*]

“As a matter of fact, the term ‘all’ denotes *many*—more than one—things; while the Composite is *not many*; how then can the term ‘all’ be used in reference to it—in such an assertion as ‘all of it would become covered’?”—(595)

This argument is answered in the following—[*see verses 596-598 next*]
