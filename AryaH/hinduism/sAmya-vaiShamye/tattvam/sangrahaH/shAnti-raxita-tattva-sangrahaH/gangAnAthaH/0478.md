> Inasmuch as sound is already accepted as having its cause in the ‘great elements’ that have been acknowledged (or not-acknowledged),—it is already admitted that sounds subsist in those elements. So that the first reason put forward (for the existence of *ākāśa*) cannot prove (what it is meant to prove).—(627)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

With the following *Text* proceeds the refutation of the arguments (urged above, in favour of the existence of *Ākāśa*, Time, Space, and Mind as distinct Substances):—[*see verse 627 above*]

If it is only the fact of Sounds being subsistent in a general way in *something* that is sought to be proved,—then the Reason is superfluous (proving what is already admitted). Because, as a matter of fact, Sounds are already admitted as having their cause in the Great Elements that have been acknowledged (by all parties) and those that have not been so acknowledged;—and Sounds are certainly subsistent in these elements which are their cause (source); because effects are always subsistent in their cause, having their appearance (production) inseparably connected with the Cause. The ‘acknowledged’ elements are the *Citta* (*Idea*) and the *Caitya* (the *Ideal*), which are accepted (by Buddhists also).—The term ‘*ādi*’ includes the causality of such elements as are *not acknowledged* (i.e. Earth etc., which though *not-acknowledged* by the Buddhist, are accepted by the other party).

‘*Teṣu*’—i.e. in those elements.

‘*Iti*’—i.e. therefore.

‘*The first Reason*’,—i.e. the one put forward under *Text* 622;—it cannot prove what it is desired to prove; that is, because it is open to the objection of being ‘superfluous—(627)
