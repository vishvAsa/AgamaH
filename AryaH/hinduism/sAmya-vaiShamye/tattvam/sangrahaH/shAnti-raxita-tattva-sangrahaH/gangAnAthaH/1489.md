> “The order of the letters, as also the shortness, length and prolongation,—all these are only distinctions or divisions of time; and they come to be recognised as conditioned (or affected) by the articulations.”—[*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 302].—(2299)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Now the *Mimamsaka* proceeds to set forth another view, under which the said distinctions of Order, etc. really belong to Time, of which the Articulations are only the qualifying adjuncts; and these being perceived in the Letters, become contributories to the comprehension of the meaning.—[*see verse 2299 above*]

The compound ‘*dhvanyupādhayaḥ*’ is to be expounded as—‘The distinctions of Time which have the manifesting Articulations for their qualification’,—(2299)
