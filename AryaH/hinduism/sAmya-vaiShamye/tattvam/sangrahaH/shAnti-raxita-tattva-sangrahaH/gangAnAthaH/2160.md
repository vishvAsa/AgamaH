> That the descriptions should be understood in the figurative sense, like the mantra and Arthavāda texts,—would be right only after the actual existence of the omniscient person had been rejected.—As a matter of fact however, there is nothing to annul the idea of such a person; while, on the contrary, his existence has been actually proved in great detail. So that the idea of all this being figurative must remain doubtful: inasmuch as it is possible for it to be true in its primary sense.—(3530-3531)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 3200 that—“The descriptions that are met with of Omniscient Persons in the *Purāṇas*, etc. should be understood in the figurative sense”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3530-3531 above*]

If the existence of the Omniscient Person had been rejected by proofs, then no other explanation being possible, the assertions in question might be taken in their figurative sense;—not otherwise, if the primary meaning were in any way possible. It cannot be right to regard the eternal Word to be mere *Arthavāda*; because an assertion is taken as an *Arthavāda* only when some other meaning is *intended; in* a case therefore where there is no such intention, there being no speaker desiring to make the assertion,—that condition cannot be fulfilled.—(3530-3531)
