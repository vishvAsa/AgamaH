*Question*—“The things in question (by their insentience) cannot have any wish; how then can they have any *need* for (dependence upon) the causal conditions?”

The Answer is given in the following Text:—[*see verse 117 above*]

What is meant by the Things being so ‘dependent’ is that they come into existence at particular places and times and not at others; it does not mean that they have any ‘wish’ or ‘desire’,

*Objection*:—“If such is their *dependence* on the particular points of time and place,—even so, how does it follow that they are *effects* of these?”

*Answer:—It is the character of* ‘*Effect*’ *that is spoken of as* ‘*dependence*—The *character of the Effect* is not anything else except the *dependence* involved in the fact that they come into existence in that particular manner.

*Question*:—“How is it known that they come into existence in that particular manner?”

*Answer:—It is a perceptible fact*.—(117)
