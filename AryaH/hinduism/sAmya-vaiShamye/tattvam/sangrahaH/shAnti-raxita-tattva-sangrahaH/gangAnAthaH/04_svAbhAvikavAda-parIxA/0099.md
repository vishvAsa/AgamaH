## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

These people put forward the following reason in support of their view:—“When a thing which fulfils the conditions of perceptibility has its existence not perceived, it should be regarded by intelligent persons as*non-existent*,—as the ‘Hare’s Horns’;—any ‘Cause’ of things is something whose existence is not perceived;—hence it follows that there can be no cognition of the ‘nature of the thing’ (the Cause)

In the following Text,—it is shown that the Reason put forward is not ‘unproven’ (hence inadmissible):—[*see verse 111 above*]

‘*Rājīva*’ is*Lotus*;—the ‘filaments, etc.’ of the Lotus.—Such is the analysis of the compound;—‘*Et cetera*’ is meant to include the Stalk, the Petals, the Pericarp and other parts, also the sharpness of thorns and the like.—‘*Diversity*’;—such diversities as those of shape, colour, hardness and the like—‘*Who makes*?’—The sense is that no one makes it, since we do not find any such ‘cause’ as God and the like.—(111)
