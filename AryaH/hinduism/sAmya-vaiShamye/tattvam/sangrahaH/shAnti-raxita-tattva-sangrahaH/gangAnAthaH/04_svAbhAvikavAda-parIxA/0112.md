## Kamalaśīla

With the following Text, the Author sums up his position and thereby also shows that the conclusion of the other party is contrary to, and set aside by, Inference also:—[*see verse 127 above*]

Tilings like the Lotus and its filaments,—which are ‘other’ than thengs spoken of by the other party in his reasoning.—*As their production is restricted*;—i.e. they are produced only when certain particular things are there.—The argument may be formulated as follows:—Those things whose production is restricted to occasions when certain other things are there must be regarded as *with Cause*,—as for instance, your own cognition of the *Probandum* (desired to be proved) which appears only when the *Probans* (Reason) is there;—the same is the case with the Lotus and otherngs;—[hence these must be regarded as ‘with Cause’]—this being a Reason based on the nature of things.—(127)

*End of Chapter* (4)*—dealing with the Doctrine of the* ‘*Thing by Itself*’.
