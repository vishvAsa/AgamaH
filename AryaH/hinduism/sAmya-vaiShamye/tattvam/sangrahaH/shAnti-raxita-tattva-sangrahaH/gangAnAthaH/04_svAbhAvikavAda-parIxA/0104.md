## Kamalaśīla

‘*Tat*’—Therefore, thus;—or the whole expression ‘*Tatsvābhāvikavādaḥ*’ may be taken as a compound, meaning ‘The doctrine of the *Thing by Itself* in regard to the Lotus and other things’;—*is discarded by Perception*; Perception alone is mentioned here, as the ‘non-apprehension’ also of a certain thing consists only in the ‘apprehension’ of something else, and as such, is of the nature of ‘Perception’.

It has been sought (under Text 112, above) to prove that “Pleasure and such internal things can have no Cause because they appear only occasionally—This reasoning however is ‘contradictory’, inasmuch as it proves only the contrary of what is desired to prove; because what has no cause and what is not dependent upon anything else cannot be ‘occasional’, appearing only at certain times and places. What is meant is that the Corroborative Instance cited is devoid of the character desired to be proved.—(118)
