> ‘Non-perception’ by all persons is doubtful; ‘non-perception’ by any one person himself is inconclusive; as it is found that the grass and other things growing in the caves of the vindhya mountain do exist, even though they are not perceived.—(122)



## Kamalaśīla

Further, when ‘non-apprehension’ is put forward as the Reason (for *non-existence*), is it put forward in the form of the absence of perception by all men? Or of the absence of perception of any one person himself?—It cannot be the former; because ordinary men with limited powers of perception can never be sure of any thing being *not perceived, by all men*; hence it must be always *doubtful*. People of limited vision have no means of knowing that no man has the perception of an unseen cause for such things as the marks on the wings of the Peacock. As for any single man’s own *non-perception*, that can never be conclusive:—why?—because even though such things as the grass, the coral, the pebbles and the like growing in mountain-caves are not perceived, yet *they do exist*; that is, there is nothing incongruous in regarding them as *existent*.—Thus the reasons adduced being doubtful, the *non-existence* cannot be regarded as proved beyond *doubt*.—(122)
