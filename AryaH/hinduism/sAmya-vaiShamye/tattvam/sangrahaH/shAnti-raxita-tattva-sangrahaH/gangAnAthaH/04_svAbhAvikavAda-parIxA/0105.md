> It may be that there are no proofs for the existence of the ‘cause’ of things; but the mere absence of proof (means of cognising) cannot prove the non-existence of any thing.—(119)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Thus it has been shown that the conclusion (of the other party) is contrary to facts of Perception and that their Reason is ‘unproven, Inadmissible’; now the Author takes for granted (for the sake of argument) the ‘admissibility’ of the Reason, and then proceeds to show its ‘Inconclusiveness’—in the following Text:—[*see verse 119 above*]

If mere ‘Non-apprehension’ is put forward as the reason for the nonexistence of the Cause, then it is ‘Inconclusive’; because *mere absence of proof*—i.e. mere absence of a valid means of knowing,—cannot serve as a reason for establishing the non-existence of the thing concerned.—(119)

*Question*:—“Why cannot it be a proof?”

The answer is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 120 next*]
