> Or, those that subsist in a lasting substratum, having come about in it somehow, and—so long as there is no force to the contrary, they do not need any further effort towards bringing them about again,—these, by the excellence of the treatment they receive, reach the highest stage of perfection;—as for example, the purification of gold;—knowledge, mercy and such qualities are all of the said kind; so that when these have reached the highest state of perfection, there is brilliant omniscience.—nor can this reason be held to be fallible (false) in view of the two cases of jumping and water-heating; because jumping follows not from the jumping itself, but from strength and effort.—(3421-3424)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Or, if there are things that subsist in a lasting substratum, and have had some peculiarity produced in them somehow,—if there is no force to the contrary,—they do not stand in need of further effort for their production; and if they receive excellent treatment, they proceed to the highest stage of perfection; as is found in the case of the purification of Gold and such things;—Knowledge, Mercy and such things (i.e. those under discussion) have the character just described—hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.

‘*Nor can this Reason be said to be fallible, in view of the cases of Jumping and Water-heating*’; i.e. by reason of the qualifications that have been added in the above statement of the Reason. Neither Jumping nor Water-heating is produced only once; nor do they not need another effort for producing them again; nor do they subsist in a lasting substratum.

Or, it may be said that there is no ‘fallibility’ in the Premiss because of the further qualification that ‘it should proceed from a seed of the same kind’ (see *Text* 3414).—This is what is pointed out by the words—‘*Jumping follows, not from the jumping itself, etc. etc*.’,—i.e. the Jumping is not produced by the Jumping.

*Question*:—“From what then, does it proceed?”

*Answer*:—‘*Jumping proceeds from strength and effort*’;—i.e. when there is strength, and also effort, then there comes Jumping; it does not come when there is *Jumping* itself. These two—Strength and Effort—have their capacities restricted and fixed; consequently, the Jumping also has its character restricted and fixed.

The following might be urged—“If Jumping proceeds from Strength and Effort, not from Jumping itself, then, the Jumping-capacity that comes to man after practice, should be his even prior to that practice”.

This does not affect our position. What happens is that before the practice, the body was disabled by the presence of too much fat, and hence the same degree of Jumping could not be attained. Subsequently however, by repeated effort, the said disability gradually disappears, and the Jumping is attained exactly in accordance with the man’s strength.—That such is the case must be admitted; as otherwise, the Jumping would proceed from the Jumping itself, and in that case there could be no fixity in its degree of excellence.—(3421-3424.)
