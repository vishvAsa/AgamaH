> At first, every cognition appears in a form free from verbal expression; then comes in the body of conventions; hence the notions in question partake of the nature of remembrance,—for that reason also.—(730)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* proceeds to show that for the following reason also, the notions of ‘Being’, etc. are effects of memory, and have to be treated as so many *Remembrances*, and cannot be regarded as ‘Perception’:—[*see verse 730 above*]

As a matter of fact, there is no Convention bearing upon the ‘Specific Peculiarity’ (of Things); and it is only after one has seen the entity, prior to its determination, only as a point of ‘Specific Peculiarity’, free from all contact with verbal expression,—that there follows its Cognition based upon the functioning of the Sense-organ then there comes to the mind, the body of Conventions bearing upon that same entity;—then there appear\* the notions of ‘Being’ and the rest,—in accordance with the said Conventions,—in regard to the thing that has been seen; and these notions embody all the ‘determination’ with reference to the thing, and give verbal expression to them. How can these notions escape from being regarded as ‘Remembrance’?

‘*For that reason also*’,—i.e. because they are ‘determined’ as seen.

‘*The notions in question*’,—i.e. those of ‘Being’ and the rest.—(730)

*Question*—“Whence has this sequence in the appearance of Cognitions been deduced?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 731 next*]
