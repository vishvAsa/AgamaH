## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The question arising—“How is the existence of these *Specific Individualities* proved?”—the following answer is given:—[*see verse 713 above*]

It is found that people like ourselves have, in regard to the Ox,—the notion of the ‘Ox’ as distinguished from the ‘Horse’, through the presence of a particular shape, qualities, action and constituents,—these notions appearing in the form respectively of ‘the Ox, white, fast moving, fat-humped, with a large bell’;—in the same manner, in people different from us, such as Mystics, there appears,—in regard to each of the eternal objects, Atoms, Liberated Souls and Liberated Minds,—the exclusive notion that ‘this is different from that’; and also when the same object is seen at another time and place, there is recognition of it as ‘this is the same’; of such notions there being no other basis,—that to which they are due is held to consist in the ‘ultimate Specific Individualities’, whose existence is inferred from the peculiar experience of the Mystics.—Each of these Individualities subsists in its own substratum, and their existence is proved by the direct perception of the Mystics.—(713)
