> All this has no essence in it; it is an elaboration of a mere theory; there is no evidence at all in support of it. as a matter of fact, the notions of ‘being’, etc. Are not found to proceed from the functioning of the sense-organs; they arise from a body of conventions.—(721-722)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 714, above) that the fact of the notions of ‘Being’, etc. being of the nature of Sense-perception is deduced from the presence of the operation of Sense-organs.—If, by the Reason here adduced, it is meant that the said notions follow immediately after the operation of the Senses,—then it cannot be ‘admitted’; because as they are of the nature of ‘determinate Cognitions’, the body of Conventions (bearing upon the verbal expression) must interpose (between the Sense-operation and the resultant Determinate Cognition).—(721-722)
