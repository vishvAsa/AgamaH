> As for ‘inherence in several things’, this is present in number, etc. also, just as in the ‘universals’; hence the notion of ‘universal’ must be there in regard to number, etc. also.—(779)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* shows that the Theory in question involves an absurdity also—[*see verse 779 above*]

If ‘Inherence in several things’ were the basis of the Comprehensive notion in regard to ‘Universals’, then,—as such ‘subsistence in several substances’ is found in such things also as *Number*, *Conjunction*, *Disjunction*, *Composite Substances* and so forth,—the notion of ‘Universal’ should appear in regard to these also; because the basis of such notion would be equally present in this case also.

As for the character of ‘forming the object of one and the same cognition’, this also is restricted to the luiiversals ‘Being’, etc. as appearing in the forms of the ‘existing,’ etc.; and it does not touch any other ‘Universal’; so that, on the strength of that also, the comprehensive notion of ‘Universal—Universal’ cannot appear in regard to the several Universals. Consequently the following assertion of *Kumārila* is entirely irrelevant:—“The subsistence of one in several different things is the basis of the name ‘Universal’ as applied to *Being*, etc.; or it may be due to their being the basis of one and the same cognition”. (*Ślokavārtika-Ākṛtivāda*, 24).—(779)
