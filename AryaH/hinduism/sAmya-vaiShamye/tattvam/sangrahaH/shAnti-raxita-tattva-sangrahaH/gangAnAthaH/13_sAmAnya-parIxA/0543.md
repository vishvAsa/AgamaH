> “Such ‘universals’ (communities, genuses) as ‘being’, ‘cow’ and the like are vouched for by direct perception; as the notion of ‘being’ and the rest are found to appear only when the sense-organs are functioning.”—(714)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*—How is the existence of ‘Universals’ (Genuses, Communities) proved?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 714 above*]

It is a well-established principle that when one thing follows the presence and absence of another thing, the former proceeds from the latter;—in regard to Substance and the rest, the appearance of the notion of ‘Being’ (Existence), etc. follows the presence and absence of the functioning of the Sense-organs; wherefore then could the said notion not be regarded as produced by the Sense-organs,—just like any other Cognition through the Sense-organs? If it were not so regarded, then it would lead to an absurdity.—(714)
