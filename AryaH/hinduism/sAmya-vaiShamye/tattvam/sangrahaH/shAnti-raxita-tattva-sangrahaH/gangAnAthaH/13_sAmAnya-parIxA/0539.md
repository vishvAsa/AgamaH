> ‘Substance’ and other categories having been rejected, the ‘universals’ also have become rejected; as they have all been assumed to subsist in the three categories.—(708)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Text* the Author begins the criticism of the Category of ‘The Universal’:—[*see verse 708 above*]

‘*The Universals*’,—i.e. the Genuses. These are held to be subsistent in the three Categories,—Substance, Quality and Action; and hence become discarded by the rejection of these Categories themselves; as without the Substratum, the Subsistent cannot exist anywhere; for if it did, it would not be *subsistent* at all.

The mention of the ‘Universal’ is only by way of an illustration; the *Ultimate Individualities* also are held to be *subsistent*, as subsisting in Ultimate Substances; hence these also become discarded by the rejection of their substratum.—(708)
