> On what basis does the term ‘category’ (‘*padārtha*’) rest when applied to the six (*vaiśeṣika* categories)? as also the notion ‘it exists’ which is found to be present in ‘being’, etc.?—(744)



## Kamalaśīla

There is not (even for the *Vaiśeṣika*) any such ‘Universal’ as ‘*Padārthatva*’ (the genus ‘Category’) subsisting in all the six Categories,—on the basis of which there should be such a comprehensive notion as ‘this is a *Category*—this is a *Category* and so forth’;—similarly in the ‘Universal’, the ‘Specific Individuality’ and ‘Inherence’, the ‘Universal’ *Being* does not subsist; by virtue of which each of these could be conceived of as ‘existing’; because (according to the *Vaiśeṣika*) ‘Being’ subsists only in the three Categories of ‘Substance’, ‘Quality’ and ‘Action—As regards the three Categories of Substance and the rest, the Opponents hold the name to be based upon the presence of the ‘Universal’; hence the fallibility of the Reason has not been urged in regard to these.—(744)
