> The comprehensive notion (op all cows, for instance) manifests within itself the verbal expression and the constituent individuals; while the ‘universal’ is described as devoid of all tinge of colour, shape and verbal expression.—(739)



## Kamalaśīla

What is meant is as follows:—What is meant by you to be proved is the fact that the basis of comprehensive notions consists of something different from the Body, etc.;—this however is not right; as no such thing enters into the notions at all; and also because what does appear in these notions is something quite different, in the shape of Colour, Shape, etc. That is to say, you describe the ‘Universal’ *Cow* to be devoid of all tinge of *Colour*, *Shape* and *Verbal Expression*; and yet the actual Cognition that appears is always apprehended as accompanied by the manifestation of *Colour*, etc.; how then could the basis of such Cognition consist of what is devoid of *Colour*, etc.? Certainly a Cognition of one form cannot have its basis in something of an entirely different form; if it did, it would lead to absurdities.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—When a Cognition manifests an object distinct from some other object, it cannot be regarded as apprehending this latter object;—e.g. the Cognition of *Sound* cannot bo regarded as apprehending *Colour*;—and as a matter of fact, the comprehensive notion manifests within itself *Colour* and the rest which are something different from the pure ‘Universal’;—so that what is actually perceived is contrary to the premiss (cited by the Opponent).

‘*Manifests within itself the Verbal Expression*, *etc*. etc.’;—‘*verbal expression*’, i.e. the name ‘Cow’;—‘*constituent individuals*’, in the form of colour, shape and the rest; ‘*avabhasavān*’, containing the manifestation of these.

‘*Akṣara*’, ‘*Letters*’, stands for the verbal expression ‘*gauḥ*’, which is made up of the letters ‘*ga*’, ‘*au*’ and the *Visarga*,—(739)
