## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* sets forth another objection—[*see verse 805 above*]

‘*Ghaṭādi etc*.’—i.e. such diverse ‘Universals’ as the ‘Jar’ and the rest.

The Universals ‘Jar’, ‘Clayey’ and the like have been described as all-pervasive, and yet would they be described as pervading only over their own substratum—or as pervading over all space, even where there are no individuals at all?—There are only these two views possible.

‘*Like the Highest Universal*’;—‘Being’ is called the ‘highest’ Universal because it comprises the largest number of things. It is this widest Universal as comprising the largest number of things that has been cited as the instance, and not any such Universal as pervades over only such space as happens to lie between two individuals; as the said character is not perceived in this latter.—(805)

Out of the two alternatives set forth above, the Author sets forth the objection against the first alternative:—[*see verse 806 next*]
