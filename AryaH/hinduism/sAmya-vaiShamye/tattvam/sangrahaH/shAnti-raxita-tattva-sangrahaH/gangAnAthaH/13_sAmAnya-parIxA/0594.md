## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* sums up the section—[*see verse 812 above*]

The ‘Universal’ has been postulated by the *Vaiśeṣika* and his followers as something entirely distinct from the Individuals; and we have stated the objections against this doctrine. The *Jainas* and the followers of *Jaimini* have postulated the ‘Universal’ as *non-dijferent from the Individual*, and also of both kinds; and this will be examined, in due course, under the Chapter on ‘*Syādvāda*’; on the present occasion, we had set out to criticise the doctrine of the *Nyāya-vaiśeṣika*; hence we do not take up the other doctrine, which would be somewhat irrelevant to the Context.—(812)

*End of the Examination of the* ‘*Universal*’.
