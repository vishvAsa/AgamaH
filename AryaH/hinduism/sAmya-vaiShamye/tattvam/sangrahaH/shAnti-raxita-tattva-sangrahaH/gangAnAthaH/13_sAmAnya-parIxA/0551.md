> As regards the first reason adduced,—it is superfluous; as the fact of the notions being brought about by the body of conventions is already admitted (by us); and that same relative (body of conventions) is what is positively and negatively concomitant.—(732)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above (under *Text* 716) that—“In regard to the Cow and the Elephant, the peculiarities of *Name* and *Idea* must be due to causes other than Convention, etc. etc.”.—

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 732 above*]

If all that is sought to be proved is the general fact that the notions in question are due to other causes related, to the character of the things concerned,—then it is superfluous—proving what is already admitted. Because the Body of Conventions bearing upon the *Cow*, etc. is that *other cause* related to and in keeping with the character of the things; as the said notions appear only when this Body of Conventions is there, and they do not appear when what is there is some heterogeneous Body of Conventions; which shows that it is this Body of Conventions, which is positively and negatively concomitant with them, that is the Cause of the notions in question; as these are found to follow on the wake of the positive and negative concomitance of these Conventions. Thus the attempt to adduce Reasons for this is entirely futile.—(732)
