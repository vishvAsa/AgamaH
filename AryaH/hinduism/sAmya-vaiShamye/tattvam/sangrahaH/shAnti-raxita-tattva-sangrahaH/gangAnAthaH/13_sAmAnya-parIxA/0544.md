## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* seeks to prove the existence of ‘Specific Individualities’ by means of Inference also:—[*see verse 715 above*]

‘*A distinctive notion*’—a notion of a kind different from that ofngs like Substance, etc.

‘*Due to a different cause*’,—whose birth is due to other causes.

The inference may be thus formulated:—When one notion is different in form from another, it must be due to a cause other than the latter,—like the notion of ‘Colour’ in regard to the Cloth, the Leather and the Blanket;—of this same kind is the notion of ‘being’ in regard to Substance, etc.;—hence this is a natural reason [for assuming a different cause for it, in the form of the ‘Universal’].—Such is the view of the other Party (the *Nyāya*-*Vaiśeṣika*).—(715)

The sense of the same argument is shown by setting forth the arguments propounded by *Bhāvivikta*:—[*see verses 716-720 next*]
