> Thus the notion that appears in regard to the ‘cook’ is dependent only upon the diversity of convention, and apprehends only the form that precludes all unlike things.—From all this it follows that all names and notions proceed diversely in accordance with convention, without there being any all-embracing entity.—(764-765)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* sum up the Author’s position—[*see verses 764-765 above*]

‘*Thus*’,—because no other cause is found, on examination, for the notions of the *Cook* and the rest, therefore,—even in connection with diverse objects like the Cook, etc., the comprehensive notion—idea—which ultimately apprehends only something distinguished from all things unlike itself—proceeds in accordance with Convention; as this *exclusion of the unlike* is always present.

Because this is so, therefore it follows that in the case of the ‘Cow’, etc. also, notions partaking of a uniform character, as also Names, should proceed on the basis of Convention,—even without any entity like the ‘Universal—So that the Reason put forward by the other party remains ‘Inconclusive’, (Fallible, Untrue).—(764-765)
