## Kamalaśīla

(*a*) That is to say, if the form of the Universal subsisting in other heterogenous individuals and in the intervals were *not-different* from the form of the Universal subsisting in the Individual that is seen,—then, the former also should be seen, as it would be not-different from what is seen, like the form of this latter.—(*b*) If however there is no perception of the said Universal, then there should be no perception of that Universal as subsisting in the perceived individual which is non-different from what is not perceived.—(*c*) Lastly, if the Universal in question be held to be of both kinds,—then that would involve a diversity of nature; two mutually contradictory characters being present; and for any clear-minded person, it cannot be right to regard as *one* what is found to be obsessed by the two mutually contradictory characters of *perceptibility* and *imperceptibility*; as such an idea would lead to absurdities; as in that case the whole Universe would be a single substance, which would imply the anomaly of the whole being produced and destroyed at one and the same time. If it were not so, then they would be ‘one’ only in name; and there can be no difference of opinion regarding mere names.—(809)
