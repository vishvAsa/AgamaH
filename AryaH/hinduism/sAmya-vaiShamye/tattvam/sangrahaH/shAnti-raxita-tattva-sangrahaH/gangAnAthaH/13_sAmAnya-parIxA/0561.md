> The argument in proof of the ‘universal’ that has been urged after the one just disposed of, also becomes rejected by this; because the fallacy of ‘futility’ and the rest are equally applicable to that also.—(747)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (above, under *Text* 719) that—“The comprehensive idea that appears in regard to the Cow and other things, etc. etc.”.—

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 747 above*]

‘*By this*’,—i.e. by the refutation just explained.—As the same objections are equally applicable to that also; for instance, the defect of being ‘futile’, ‘superfluous’ (proving what is already admitted) and the rest are applicable to this argument also.

The phrase ‘*and the rest*’ includes the fallacies of the Corroborative Instance ‘being devoid of the Probandum’, the Reason being ‘unproven’, and ‘fallible’ (Inconclusive) and so forth.—(747)
