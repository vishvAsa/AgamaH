> In the case of water and such things, there may be a ‘receptacle’ which prevents their downward movement; in the case of üniversals however, which are immobile, what would be the use of receptacles?—In the case of what is capable of bringing about its own cognition, what would be the use of any causes of manifestation?—And also in the case of what is incapable of bringing about its own cognition, what would be the use of any causes of manifestation? If what was incapable yesterday were made capable (to-day), then the thing would be impermanent,—just like the jar manifested by the lamp.—(802-804)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* proceed to show that it is absolutely incongruous to assume a ‘receptacle’ for the ‘Universal’—[*see verses 802-804 above*]

‘*Agatīnām*’, ‘*Immobile*’—which are devoid of movement. The absence of movement in the Universal is implied by its incorporeality and all-pervading character.

Nor can the ‘subsistence’ of the Universal in the Individuals be of the nature of *being?nanifested*. Because the ‘manifestation’ of the Universal could only consist in *bringing about its Cognition*, not in any strengthening of its character, because the character of an eternal thing cannot be changed. Under the circumstances, if the Universal has the capacity of bringing about its own Cognition, then why should it need any other cause for its ‘manifestation’?—If, on the other hand, it does not possess the capacity of bringing about its own Cognition, then it would not be reasonable to assert its dependence on something else, as by its very nature, the Universal is such that nothing can be introduced into it by other things.—If it be held that other things do introduce peculiar features into the Universal, then, like the Individual, it would become *specific*, and cease to be *Universal*.

*The thing*, *etc. etc*.—The entire category ‘Universal’ is held to be based upon the *name* and *notion* of ‘existence’, [hence ‘*bhāva*’ here stands for the thing Universal, in that sense].

The argument may be formulated as follows:—When there is no basis for one thing subsisting in another, then it cannot subsist in this latter,—e.g. the *Himālaya* in the *Vindhya*;—there is no basis for the subsistence of the Universal in the Individuals;—hence there is non-apprehension of the wider ‘term’ (which implies the negation of the narrower term).—(802-804)
