## Kamalaśīla

Even granting that the existence of something other than the ‘Blue’ is proved, there can be no proof for what you desire to prove; as your Conclusion itself is barred by Inference, and to that extent, the Premiss also cannot be admitted.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 743 above*]

‘*Free from impermanence*’,—i.e. free from non-eternality,—eternal.

“Why is it not established?”

‘*Because the notions in question appear in succession*’; i.e. the notions of the ‘Cow’ and the rest. If these were due to any such commonality as the ‘Universal’, then they would not appear in succession,—as their cause being always present in its perfect form, they should all appear simultaneously; just like several things produced simultaneously. Specially because a cause that cannot be helped does not need anything else.—(743)
