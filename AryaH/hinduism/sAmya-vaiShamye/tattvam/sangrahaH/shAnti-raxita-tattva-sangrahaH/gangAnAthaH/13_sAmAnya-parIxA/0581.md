> As regards such expressions as ‘the prior negation of the jar’, it is a creation of mere fancy; just like the description of ‘bravery’ in regard to an imaginary person. in cases where the relation of qualification and qualified is based upon a real entity, there is bound to be some other relation (regarded as its basis).—(785-786)



## Kamalaśīla

When it is found that a thing which was not there has come into existence,—and there is a desire to speak of it,—there appears an imaginary notion which indicates ‘Prior Negation’ as something different from theng concerned, and related to it by the relation of *Qualification and Qualified*; it is on this imaginary basis that the relation of *Qualification and Qualified* is mentioned, and there is no such relation in reality;—just as in the case of the picture drawn by an artist, the qualities of ‘bravery’ and the like are assumed. In cases where you postulate the said relation of *Qualification and Qualified*,—some other relation (as its basis) has surely to be looked for; otherwise there would be no regularity or restriction.—(785-780)
