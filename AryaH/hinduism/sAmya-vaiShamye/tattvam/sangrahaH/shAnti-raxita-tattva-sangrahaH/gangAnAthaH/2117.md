> The supersensuous potency of gestures, magic circles and incantations to cure the attack of ghosts and witches, to remove the effects of poisons;—also the sages and Garuḍa and such beings;—if the clear knowledge of all these things by direct perception, as apart from words and inference, did not belong to these persons,—how is it that they have spoken of all this?—(3452-3453)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, the knowledge of Incantations and other things as possessing the capacity to remove the effects of Poison, etc.,—things that are entirely beyond the reach of the senses,—if these things were not directly known to *Buddha* and others, how is it that they have spoken of them? This needs to be explained.—(3452-3453)
