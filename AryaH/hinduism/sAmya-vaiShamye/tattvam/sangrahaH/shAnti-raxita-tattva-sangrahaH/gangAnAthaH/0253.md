> From all this it follows that there is no such lasting ‘substance’ as the ‘soul’ and the like; because they are not different from the ‘successive factors’,—like the form of the ‘successive factors’ themselves.—(319)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The phrase ‘*and the like*’ is meant to include the Jar, Grains and other things.—(319)
