> “The person securing liberation has always been found to be one who has been bound up in chains, etc.; any such assertion therefore as that ‘the unbound person becomes liberated’ is contrary to a well-perceived fact.”—(498)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—there would be Liberation for one who has not been in bondage;—where is the incongruity in that?

The answer to this is provided in the following—[*see verse 498 above*]

That the person who is *liberated* is the same that had been in *bondage* is a fact well recognised and seen in the world. The assertion therefore of the Liberation of the Person who has *not* been in Bondage is one that is annulled by popular notion and also by a perceptible fact.—(498)

The following *Text* points out that the said idea is annulled by Inference also—[*see verse 499 next*]
