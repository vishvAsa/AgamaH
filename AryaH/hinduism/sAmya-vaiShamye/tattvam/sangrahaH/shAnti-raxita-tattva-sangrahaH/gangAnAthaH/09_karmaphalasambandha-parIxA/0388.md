> The notion of the ‘doer’ and the rest is in reference to the unity of the ‘chain’; and that too is held to be only a figment of the imagination; it is not a fart of the real state of things.—(504)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

People have the light of their wisdom bedimmed by a mass of deep-ignorance; hence they ignore all considerations regarding their being this or that, being existent or non-existent, and so forth,—and come to regard the chain of impressions in the shape of particular causes and effects as ‘one’, and thus come to make use of such expressions as ‘The same I am doing this act’, and proceed to make attempts to bring about their Liberation.—It is in view of this (popular) egotism that the Blessed Enlightened Ones, desirous of saving their disciples from the pitfalls of Nihilism, propound the theory of the ‘Unity of the Chain’ and thereby explain the notions of the ‘Doer’ and the like.

Says the Opponent—“The said Explanation is enough to establish the-reality of the matter under dispute”.

*Answer*:—“*It is not a part of the real state of things*”;—as a matter of fact, the real state of things cannot be determined on the basis of the notions entertained by childish persons enmeshed in illusion and averse to the investigation of truth; specially as the said notion is negatived by the evidences of ‘Soullessness’ and ‘Perpetual Flux’ of Things.—(594)
