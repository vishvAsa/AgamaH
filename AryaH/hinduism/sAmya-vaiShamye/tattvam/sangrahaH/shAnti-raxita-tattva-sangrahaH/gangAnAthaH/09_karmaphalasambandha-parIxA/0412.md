## Kamalaśīla

The criticism that has been urged applies equally to both parties; as you also will have to accept one or the other of the two views—of Cognition having form or being formless otherwise there would be no possibility of the Cognition apprehending an object.—Nor is there any other alternative besides these two ways in which the Cognition could apprehend the object. When a criticism is applicable to both parties, it should not be urged by one against the other. Thus then the answer that you may be able to make to the criticism shall be our answer also. For instance, under the view that Cognition has some form, the answer that you might make would be either that the forms are unreal, or that they are nothing different from the Cognition itself with which it is found to be invariably concomitant, even though the two appear to be different;—and this same answer shall be ours also.—Under the view that Cognition is formless, the explanation that could be given would be that that character of the Cognition whereby it apprehends only a particular thing is due to previous Causes;—and tins same answer shall be available for us *Bauddhas* also, who hold Cognitions to be formless. Hence our answer to the Opponent’s criticism is that it cannot be urged against us.—(537)
