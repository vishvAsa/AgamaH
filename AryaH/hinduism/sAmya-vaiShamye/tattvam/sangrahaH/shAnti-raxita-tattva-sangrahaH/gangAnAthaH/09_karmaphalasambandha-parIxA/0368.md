> “In the case of active people, that ‘moment’ (momentary thing) which is believed to be the doer of the act, does not continue to exist at the time of the appearance of the result of that act;—and the act was not done by that ‘moment’ which is spoken of as the experiencer of the result at the time of its appearance; as it did not exist at that time.—Thus, inasmuch as no single entity is admitted as being the doer of the act and the experiencer of its results,—the position thus clearly is that the act is lost for the man who did it and its results befall one who did not do it,—which is extremely anomalous.”—(477-479)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Does not continue to exist*’;—as it is destroyed immediately on its coming into existence.

‘*Inasmuch as no single entity*, *etc*.’;—i.e. since the Act and its Result have not been taken up by one and the same entity. There is ‘loss of the Act’ for the 'doer of the act, as he does not come by the result; and there is ‘befalling of what he did not do’ on the man who did not do the act.

‘*Extremely anomalous*’;—i.e. no such situation is found either among people or mentioned in the scriptures.—(477-479)
