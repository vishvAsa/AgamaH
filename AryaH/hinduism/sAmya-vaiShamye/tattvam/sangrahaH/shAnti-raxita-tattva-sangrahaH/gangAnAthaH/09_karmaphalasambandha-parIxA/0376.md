> “If the jar and such things existed only for one moment, then they could not be perceived by the eye; as things that have been destroyed are never cognised,—as is found in the case op things long past.—The relation op ‘cause and effect’ cannot be apprehended by means op ‘perception and non-apprehension’, because the nature of things is not apprehended at all”.—(490-491)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus shown the impossibility of the relation of ‘Cause and Effect’, the Opponent proceeds to show the impossibility of any Means of Cognising such relation:—[*see verses 490-491 above*]

The Relation of Cause and Effect is sought to be proved through Perception (of Effect only when the Cause is present) and Non-apprehension (of the Effect when the Cause is absent). Under the circumstances, if Things were momentary, as they could not be in existence at the moment of their cognition, they could not be perceptible; as the relation of Cause and Effect is not possible between things existing at the same moment. Thus there is no possibility of Perception or Non-apprehension (in support of the *momentariness* of things); specially because ‘Non-apprehension’ also is only a form of ‘Perception’, being, as it is, of the nature of the apprehension of a Thing as not related to anything else; and hence there being no use for it when there is no apprehension of any thing. Such being the case, how could the relation of Cause and Effect be proved through Perception and Non-apprehension?—(490-491)
