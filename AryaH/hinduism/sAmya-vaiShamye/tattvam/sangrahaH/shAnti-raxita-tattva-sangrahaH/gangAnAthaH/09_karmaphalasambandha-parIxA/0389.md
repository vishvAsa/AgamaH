> In the absence of continuity, the relation of ‘cause and effect’ would be of the particular hind just pointed out,—this alone is possible among things appearing under different ‘chains’.—In the case of the seed, sprout and such things, the relation of cause and effect is found to be definitely certain, and yet there is not the slightest trace of continuity.—(505-506)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author anticipates the Opponent’s objection to the effect that “the absence of the continuous Soul in the case of Seed and such things not being admitted (by all parties), the Corroborative Instance (cited by the Buddhist, under *Text* 502) is one that is not admitted (and hence inadmissible as Corroborative Instance)”:—[*see verses 505-506 above*]

The term ‘*anvaya*’ stands for ‘*anugama*’, *continuity*,—i.e. of any particular character.—(505-506)
