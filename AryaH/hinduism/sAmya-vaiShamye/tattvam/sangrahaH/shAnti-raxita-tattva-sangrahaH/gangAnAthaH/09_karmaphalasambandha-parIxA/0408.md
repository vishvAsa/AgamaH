> Even when one thing appears in immediate sequence to another,—it is only in some oases (not always) that the latter is the cause of the former, where the sequence is invariable; this is what is accepted, in view of such being the real state of things;—the same is the case under the view that things are permanent.—(531)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Says the Opponent:—“Just as Smoke appears in immediate sequence to Fire, so sometimes it may appear in immediate sequence to such things also as the Cow, the Horse and the like; then why cannot mere *immediate sequence* be regarded as ‘inconclusive’ (in the proving of the Causal Relation)?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 531 above*]

We do not say that mere *immediate sequence* is the basis of ‘Causal Relation’); what we do assert is that one thing is to be regarded as the Cause of another when the latter is *always* found to appear, in immediate sequence to the former; that is, oneng is regarded as the Cause of another when the latter is found to appear *only* in immediate sequence to the former. Smoke is not found *always* to appear in sequence to the Cow, the Horse and so forth; because it actually appears even in the absence of these animals.—Then again, to you also, who hold Things to be permanent, the said criticism would be applicable—why the smoke, appearing after the Cow, etc. is not regarded as the Effect of these?—(531)

The Opponent urges an objection (in the first half, which is answered in the second half)—[*see verse 532 next*]
