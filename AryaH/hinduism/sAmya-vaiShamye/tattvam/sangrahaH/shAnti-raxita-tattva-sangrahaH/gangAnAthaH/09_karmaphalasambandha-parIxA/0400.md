> As a matter of fact, it is on the existence of the seed itself that the sprout is seen to appear; on the other hand, nothing is seen as coming into existence on the existence of an ‘operation’.—(523)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*On the existence*’,—i.e. on mere existence; i.e. on the existence of the Thing—the seed—itself, devoid of any other operation (or activity).—This establishes the fact of the *Effect* being positively and negatively concomitant with the *Thing itself*,—and not with the *Operation*.—(523)
