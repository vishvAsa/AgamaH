> As a matter of fact, the operation also is assumed to be the cause only on the basis of the fact that the effect appears when the operation is there; it is far better, then, that the thing itself to which that operation belongs should be regarded as the cause.—(522)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Assumed*’,—i.e. the ‘operation’, which has been assumed by you to be of the nature of neither the Cause nor the Effect, nor both.

‘*That to which the operation belongs*’,—‘becomes the Cause, by reason of the fact of the Effect appearing only when it is there’—such is the construction of the sentence.

‘*The Thing itself*’,—i.e. the Thing by itself, without any peculiar form of activity or operation, may be regarded as the ‘Cause’,—(522)

*Question*—“What is the peculiarity in this latter view that it is said to be ‘far better’?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 523 next*]
