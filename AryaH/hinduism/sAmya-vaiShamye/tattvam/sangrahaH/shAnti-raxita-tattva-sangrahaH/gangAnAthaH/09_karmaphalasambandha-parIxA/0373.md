## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged (by the Buddhist)—Even without any operation, the relation of ‘Cause and effect’ would be there on the basis of mere *proximity*.

The answer to this is supplied by the following—[*see verse 486 above*]

If the idea is that when one thing comes into existence after another, it must be the effect of this latter, then just as, after the ‘Colour-Moment’ subsisting in the Jar has ceased, the homogeneous Colour-moments that appear in it are regarded as the effects of the preceding Colour-moment,—so also the *Odour* and other properties that are produced in the same Jar would have to be regarded as the Effects of that same preceding *Colour*-*moment* And, yet, even though this immediate sequence is there, the *Odour-moment* is not held to be the effect of the preceding *Colour-moment*; because between material properties, there cannot be the same causal relation that there is between material substances themselves, because they appear in different ‘chains’ (or series). This is the opinion that our opponent himself holds.

‘*In the same way the subsequent Colours also*’;—that is to say, the homogeneous Colour-moments cannot be regarded as the effects of the previous Colour-moment, entirely on the ground of immediate sequence; as otherwise there would be an absurdity.—(486)
