## Kamalaśīla

Says the Opponent—“This definite Law of Cause and Effect itself is not possible without a ‘Soul’.”

The answer is provided in the following—[*see verse 502 above*]

Just as the potency of the Seed and such things is restricted to the Sprout and such things,—even without a controller in the form of the ‘Soul’,—so would it also be in the case of every psychical concept. Such things as the *Seed* and the rest are not controlled by the ‘Soul’, in the way that the Body, as the receptacle of experience, is held to be controlled. Otherwise, there would be no sense in the (*Naiyāyika’s*) argument that “the living body cannot be without soul, as, if it were, then there could be no *breathing* and other functions”; in the case of the Jar and such things, if the absence of ‘Breathing, etc.’ were found to follow from the absence of the ‘Soul’, then alone could the negative concomitance involved in the argument be admissible;—if the Jar, etc. also were with *Soul*, then how could the Reason adduced have the requisite negative concomitance?

‘*Even in the absence of a permanent Soul*’,—i.e. even when there is no character which is common to them all.—(502)
