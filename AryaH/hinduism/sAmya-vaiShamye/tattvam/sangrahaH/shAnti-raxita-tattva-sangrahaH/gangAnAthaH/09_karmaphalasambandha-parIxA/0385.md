> We proceed to answer the above criticisms as follows:—Things being without ‘soul’, in reference to these also, the relation of cause and effect being there, all the said notions become established without any difficulty.—(501)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Text*, the Author proceeds to answer the above criticisms (levelled against the Doctrine of *Perpetual Flux*):—[*see verse 501 above*]

Even whenngs are regarded as being ‘without Soul’, all such notions as those relating to ‘the Relation between Acts and their Results’ and so forth, are based upon the relation of ‘Cause and Effect’; so that when the relation of Cause and Effect is there, all those notions become established and there is no incongruity at any point.—(501)
