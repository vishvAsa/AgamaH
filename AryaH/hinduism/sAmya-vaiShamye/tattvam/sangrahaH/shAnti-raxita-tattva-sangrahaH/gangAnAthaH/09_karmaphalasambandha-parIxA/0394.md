> What did not exist could have no potency;—if the potency were there, the effect would surely be produced; hence simultaneity between cause and effect is clearly incongruous.—(515)



## Kamalaśīla

When the *co-born* Cause (i.e. the Cause that comes into existence along with its Effect) produces its Effect, it can do so either while it is itself *unborn*, or when it is itself *born*;—the former alternative cannot be right; as the Cause does not exist prior to the production of the Effect,—and as such, is devoid of all potentiality.—If it be said that—“It produces the effect when it is *born*, and then, being endowed with potentialities, it produces the Effect”,—the answer is—‘*if the Potency were there, etc*.’; i.e. if the Cause has its potency while it is in the state of having been born, then, like the character of the Cause, the Effect also would be already born; and under the circumstances, on what would the potency of the Cause operate?—Thus the doctrine that Cause and Effect are simultaneous is clearly contrary to the authority of Inference.—(515)
