> “Even if the destruction and production were simultaneous, there would not be mutual dependence; so that there could not be the relation of ‘cause and effect’, as there would be no help rendered by it.”—(485)



## Kamalaśīla

The following argument might be urged (by the Buddhist):—Just as the *rising* and *falling* of the weighing scales come about simultaneously, so also would be the *destruction* of the Present Moment and the *appearance* of its effect; so that what is meant is that the subsequent Moment is brought about by the preceding Moment before the latter has been destroyed; and that the appearance of the later moment would not fail to have its cause.

The following *Text* supplies the answer to this argument:—[*see verse 485 above*]

Even if the Destruction (of the first Moment) and the Production (of the second Moment) be assumed to be simultaneous, there would not be the relation of ‘Cause and Effect’ between the said *Destruction and Production*, or between the Moments undergoing the said Destruction and Production;—because the two would be independent of one another.—“How would they be independent of one another?”—Because *there would be no help rendered by it*; that is, the Destruction, being featureless, would have no action; and as for the entity that is regarded as the Cause, it is not present at the time that the Effect comes into existence *so* that it could not have any action bearing upon the latter.—(485)
