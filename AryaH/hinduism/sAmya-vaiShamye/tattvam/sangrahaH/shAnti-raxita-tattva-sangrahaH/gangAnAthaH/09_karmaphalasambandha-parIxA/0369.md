> “As a matter of fact, under the doctrine of ‘no-soul’, the doer of an act would know, beforehand, that, ‘as i am going to perish immediately, there would be no result from this act, or it would come to some one other than myself’; and knowing this, the intelligent man would not undertake the performance of any act, good or bad, for the purpose of securing its result; as for the result, it would be still further removed.”—(480-481)



## Kamalaśīla

The anomaly of ‘the loss of what is done and the befalling of what is not done’ has been pointed out, on the acceptance of the view that ‘activity’ is possible; the Opponent next proceeds to show—from Kumārila’s standpoint,—that *activity* itself is not possible (under the Doctrine of ‘Perpetual Flux’):—[*see verses 480-481 above*]

Under the Doctrine of ‘Perpetual Flux’, it would be held that all things are devoid of ‘Soul’; as all things being dependent upon their cause (in the ‘Causal Chain’), nothing can be independent (self-sufficient). Under the circumstances, the intelligent agent must know,—be conscious of the fact,—“what?”—that ‘after my destruction, the result could not accrue to me, as I would not be there at the time that the Result comes about; even if the Result comes about, it would come to a Moment other than myself’, Knowing this, the intelligent person would not undertake the act at all; how then could there be any result which can follow only from an act preceded by the activity (of an active agent)? Such Result would be ‘still further removed’, as absolutely impossible.—(480-481)
