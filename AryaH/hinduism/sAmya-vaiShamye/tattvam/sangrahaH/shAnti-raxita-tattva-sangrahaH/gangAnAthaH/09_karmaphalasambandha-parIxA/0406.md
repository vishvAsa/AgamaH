> Just as cognition is momentary, so are all things that are born, as they have been proved to be. Hence the whole universe must be devoid of ‘operation’.—(529)



## Kamalaśīla

“In the case of Cognition, it is quite right that mere *existence* is the Operation, as the Cognition does not continue to exist at any later time, being momentary; [but the same cannot be true in the case of other things, which are *not* momentary].”

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 529 above*]

Under the chapter on the ‘Permanence of Things’ it has been proved that all things are in ‘perpetual flux’,

‘*So are*, *etc*.’—i.e. like Cognition.

‘*Hence*’,—i.e. because of their momentary character.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—Things that are momentary can have no action (or operation),—like the Cognition,—Seed and other things have already been proved to be momentary;—this therefore is a reason based on the nature of things (for regarding them as *devoid of action*). As a matter of fact, things have no subsequent existence, and there could be no action without a substratum;—this supplies the argument annulling the possibility of action or operation inngs.

From all this it follows that the only basis for the relation of Cause and Effect consists in *immediate sequence*, and not in any *action* (or operation, on the part of the Cause).—(529)
