> Even in the ordinary world, these two—‘bondage’ and ‘liberation’—are not admitted as appearing in the same substratum; as everything is held to be momentary.—(545)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 499) that “Bondage and Liberation appear in the same substratum”.—The next *Text* proceeds to show that in this argument the Corroborative Instance cited is ‘devoid of the Probandum’:—[*see verse 545 above*]

When it has been proved that everything perishes immediately after it is born, then nowhere can Bondage and Liberation be accepted as appearing in the same substratum; hence what has been cited by the Opponent as the Corroborative Instance is what is not admitted.—(545)
