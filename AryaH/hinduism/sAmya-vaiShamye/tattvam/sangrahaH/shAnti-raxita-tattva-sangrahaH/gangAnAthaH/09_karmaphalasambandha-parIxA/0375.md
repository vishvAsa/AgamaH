> “The upshot briefly is this:—If the effect were produced from a cause that has perished, then such an effect would be without cause,—as what has perished can have no character (or potentiality).—If the effect be held to be produced from a cause that has not perished,—then, as the cause in that case would continue to exist during several moments,—wherefore could the ‘momentary character’ of things not become discarded (on that account)?”—(488-489)



## Kamalaśīla

What has been already explained above is now briefly summed up:—[*see verses 488-489 above* *and previous verses*]

Only two views are possible in this connection:—(1) The Effect is produced out of the Cause which is itself destroyed, and (2) that it is produced out of the Cause which is not destroyed; things cannot be other than either *destroyed* or *not destroyed*. The first view cannot be right; because what has been destroyed is *non-existent*, and if production from that were admitted, the effect would have to be regarded as *without Cause*; which would mean that it is eternally *existent*.—Nor can the second view be right; as, in that case, things would continue to exist during several moments, which would deprive them of the character of *momentariness*.—‘*Wherefore could it not be discarded?*’—i.e. it would certainly become discarded. For instance, it would mean that—(a) the Thing comes into existence, then (b) it acts, then (c) it produces the Effect, then (d) it perishes; so that it is there during all these several moments; which rejects the idea of its being ‘momentary’.—(488-489)
