> “An entity that has itself not secured its existence can never re the cause of something else; nor can the destroyed entity (be a cause); nor can the presence (of the present entity) be capable of producing the effect.—Further, if the destruction of the previous ‘moment’ be held to be absolute, then there could be no production of any subsequent ‘moment’, as its cause would not be there.”—(483-484)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* adduces arguments in support of each of the assertions made in the preceding *Text* regarding the *Future*, etc.:—[*see verses 483-484 above*]

Thatng is called ‘future’ which has not yet secured its existence;—what has not secured its existence must be ‘non-existent’; what is nonexistent must be devoid of all potentiality;—what is devoid of all potentiality cannot serve as the cause of anything else,—i.e. cannot serve as the cause of bringing about any otherng; because it is agreed on all sides that it is only a potential thing that can serve as a cause.

Similarly what has perished cannot serve as the cause of anything else, as it is devoid of all potentiality.

As for the Present thing, that has no continued existence, by virtue of which it could be capable of producing any effect.

Then again, if it is held that the preceding ‘Moment’ perishes *absolutely*, then there could be no producing of the subsequent ‘Moment’, as there would be no cause for such production.—(483-484)
