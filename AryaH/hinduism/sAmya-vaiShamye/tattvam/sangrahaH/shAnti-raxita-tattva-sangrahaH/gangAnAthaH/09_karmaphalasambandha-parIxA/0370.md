## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has thus been proved that there can be no *relation between Action and its Result*; the Author next proceeds to show,—again from *Kumārila’s* standpoint,—that the *Relation of Cause and Effect* is not possible under the doctrine of ‘Perpetual Flux’:—[*see verse 482 above*]

‘*Till that time*’;—i.e. during the time that it would come into existence and produce the effect, it does not continue to exist,—being *momentary*— (482)
