> It is the necessary condition of ‘immediate sequence’ that is called ‘need’; and in the appearance of the effect, the only operation of the cause in all cases is its ‘existence’.—(521)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The ‘need’ that the *Effect* has of the *Cause* consists only in the fact of its coming into existence immediately after the latter; and of the *Came* also, the only ‘operation’ towards the bringing about of the *Effect* is that it is always *in existence* at the time of the appearance of the *Effect*.—(521)

Further, you have to admit that the ‘causal character’ of an ‘operation’—or of a Thing with that operation,—towards a particular Effect consists entirely in the fact of the latter coming into existence only when the former is in existence; in fact, for the determining of the causal relation between a Cause and its Effect there is no ground except positive and negative concomitance. Such being the case, why is not the causal character attributed to the Thing itself (and not to its action or operation)?—specially as it cannot be said that the positive and negative concomitance of the Effect with the *Thing itself* is not well known. Hence it is far better to regard the Thing itself as the Cause, with which the positive and negative concomitance of the Effect is well recognised.—

This is what is explained in the following—[*see verse 522 next*]
