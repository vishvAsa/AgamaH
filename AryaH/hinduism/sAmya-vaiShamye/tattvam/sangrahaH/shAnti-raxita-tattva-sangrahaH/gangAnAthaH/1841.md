> The operation of causes has always been found to be something different from the birth of the effects; in order to preclude this from the case of cognition (*pramāṇa*), the term ‘birth’ (‘*janma*’) has been introduced [by Jaimini in his *sūtra* 1.1.4]—the idea being that the cognition does not continue to exist for even a single moment, and yet it is not born as invalid; on account of which it could operate only later on towards the apprehending of the object,—in the manner of the sense-organs.—[*Ślokavārtika*—sense-perception, 54-55].—(2923-2924)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

In *Sūtra* 1. 1. 4, Jaimini has propounded the definition of *Sense-perception* as consisting in ‘the *birth* of the man’s apprehension following from the contact of the sense-organs with an existing object’; and the above four lines have been put forward by Kumārila in justification of the use of the term ‘*janma*’ (Birth) in this definition; the sense being that the term ‘birth’ has been used in order to point out that the Cognition is valid as soon as it is *born*.

*Question*:—“What is the reason for this?”

*Answer*:—‘*The Cognition does not*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Tat*’ stands for the *Cognition*.—(2923-2924)

In the following *Text*, the Author anticipates and answers the rejoinder of the other party:—[*see verse 2925 next*]
