> There are three words used (in connection with non-entities)—‘*abhāvaḥ*’ (masculine), ‘*nirupākhyam*’ (neuter) and ‘*tucchatā*’ (feminine); what sort of connection with the states of continuance, etc. could be assumed in regard to the nonentities (spoken of by these words)?—(1126)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The definition is ‘too narrow’ also, because it is not true in all cases;—this is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1126* above]

Even in the case of non-entities,—such as the *Hare’s Horn* and the lake,—the states of *continuance*, etc. are not there; and yet in regard to them words of all three genders are applied—in the shape of ‘*abhāvaḥ*’ (Masculine, Non-existent), ‘*Nirupākhyam*’ (Neuter, Featureless) and ‘*Tucchatā* (Feminine, Insignificant). So that the proposed regulation of genders cannot include such cases; hence it is *too narrow*.—(1126)
