> Particular points of place and time also are related (as cause) to things.—“how so?”—if the said points were not the cause of things, these would be produced everywhere and at all times.—(115)

> As a matter of fact however things are found to be produced specifically at a certain place, at a certain time and in certain receptacles,—being dependent upon these and independent of all others.—(116)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It is not only such things as the Seed of the rest that are definitely known as the ‘Cause’ of things; even particular points of Place and Time are definitely known as such ‘Causes’;—this is what the Author shows in the following Text:—[*see verses 115-116 above*]

If the Lotus, etc. did not have them—i.e. the particular points of place and time,—for their ‘Cause’,—then such phenomena as their production *only* in a particular Place, like *Water* and things like it, and not in other places like *Stone*,—and only at the particular point of time like the *Summer*, and not at other points of time like the Winter,—would not be possible; in fact, the Lotus and other things would come into existence at all places and at all times, as they would be independent of the peculiarities of place and time. It is clearly recognised therefore that they are dependent upon these latter, from the fact that they avoid certain places and times and appear only at special places and at special times.—(115-116)
