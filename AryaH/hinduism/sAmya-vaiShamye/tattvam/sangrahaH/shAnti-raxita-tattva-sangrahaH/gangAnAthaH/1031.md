> (*a*) there can be no nature (or character) without a nature (or character); (*b*) nor can there be effect without a cause. Because (otherwise) there would be the incongruities of (*a*) ‘deviation from nature’, and (*b*) ‘causelessness and without these two (relationships) there can be no inference.—(1478)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“How is it known that the well-ascertained Probans never fails? There is no reason why this should bo so.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1478 above*]

There are only two kinds of *Probans*—(1) Nature of the thing and (2) Being an Effect; ‘non-apprehension’ being included under ‘Nature’, And these two kinds of Probans are not possible except where there is a Probandum, called ‘Nature’ and ‘Cause’,—by reason of which there could be ‘fallibility’ (falsity) in the Probans.

“Why is it not possible?”

‘*Because otherwise*, *etc*. etc.’,—There is copulative compounding between ‘*bheda*’ and ‘*animittatā*’; the sense is that the Probans which forms the *Nature* of the thing would cease to be its ‘nature’; and the Probans which is an *effect* would come to be *without cause*; and yet no Probans is admitted which forms neither the ‘nature’ nor the ‘effect’ (of the Probandum),—except when there is no connection and when there is no Invariable Concomitance.

‘*Without these two*’,—i.e. as ‘nature’ and as ‘effect’. The word has the Dual Ending.—(1478)
