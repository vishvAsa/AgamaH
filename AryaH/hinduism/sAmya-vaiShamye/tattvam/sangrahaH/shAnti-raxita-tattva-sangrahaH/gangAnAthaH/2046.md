> In this manner, o clever man, the non-existence of your mother’s marriage becomes established ‘free from all doubt’.—(3299)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the idea is that there can be Doubt only in regard to a thing that has been perceived some time or the other,—and in regard to all other things there should be certainty of *non-existence*,—then under that principle, the non-existence of your mother’s marriage becomes established, beyond all doubt; because you have never before perceived that marriage; by virtue of which there could be no certainty regarding its non-existence.

The rest of the objection is to be answered as before.

‘*Clever* *man*’—is said in derision.—(3299)

Says the Opponent—“If such be the case, then there can be no basis for Doubt at all”.

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3300 next*]
