> “Even when the producing and the manifesting (of the entire *sphoṭa*) have been done once by one articulation, people pronounce the other letters for the purpose of a clearer manifestation; because it is difficult to determine it as manifested once;—therefore it is manifested again and again by means of letters with similar appearances.”—(2716-2717)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been said under *Text* 2714 that—‘in the case of the indivisible *Sphoṭa*, production and manifestation are not possible’.

The following *Text* sets forth the Opponent’s answer to that:—[*see verses 2716-2717 above*]

Even though the *producing* or *manifesting* of the entire *Sphoṭa* is done by a single Articulation,—yet the subsequent Articulations are not entirely useless; as these serve to render the manifestation clearer; just as a verse, when repeated again and again, becomes more distinct than by a single utterance;—and even though the frequent repetition does not produce anything new in it, yet the repetition is not useless; similarly in the case in question also, the later Articulations are not useless.—This is what is pointed out by the words ‘*yataḥ, etc. etc*.’—‘*Duravadhārā*’—difficult to determine or ascertain.—(2716-2717)
