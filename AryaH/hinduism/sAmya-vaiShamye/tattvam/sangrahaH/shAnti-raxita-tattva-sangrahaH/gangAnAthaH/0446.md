> Further, as there would be ‘existence’ of the existence also, the incompatible (genitive) ending would be incompatible with it; and if there were existence of that existence also, and so forth, there would be no end to it.—(577)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, even granting that the Property of ‘Existence’ belongs to the Six Categories,—your Reason remains defective (false, inconclusive). For instance, that *Existence* itself would have *existence*, as it is an Entity; how then could there be the Genitive ending in the expression ‘existence *of Existence*’, which (as you say) is based on difference?—If it be held that there is yet another existence of the Existence, then there is an Infinite Regress.—(577)
