> Thus,—inasmuch as no ‘manifestation’ (of the word-sound) is possible,—the cognition of the word-sound must be regarded as having this character that it is invariably concomitant with the birth (coming into existence) of what is apprehended by it,—like the cognition of the individual jar and such things.—Consequently, both ‘producing’ and ‘manifesting’,—as brought about by effort and articulation,—will have the diversity of their capacity determined by presumption based upon the nature of the effects produced by them.—(2559-2560)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* set forth the arguments in support of the view that *Word-Sound* is *not-eternal*.—[*see verses 2559-2560 above*]

The argument may be formulated as follows:—What is occasional must be produced by a cause which also has had its production,—as for example, the cognition of the individual Jar;—and the Cognition of the Word-Sound is occasional; hence this is a Reason based on the nature of things.

The Reason cannot be regarded as ‘inadmissible’, because as a matter of fact, the said cognition is not found to appear at all times.—Nor can it he regarded as ‘inconclusive’; as the idea of Sound being ‘manifested’ has been already discarded,—Nor again can it be regarded as ‘contradictory’; because it is found to be present in all places where the Probandum is present.

‘*Idam-phalam*’ is a compound, meaning—‘that which has *idam*’—this, i.e. being invariably concomitant with the birth of what is apprehended by it—for its ‘*phalam*’, net gain, character.

The rest is easily understood.—(2559-2560)
