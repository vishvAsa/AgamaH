> “If the qualification were absolutely distinct from the qualified, then how could it bring about in the qualified a cognition in keeping with itself?”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 142].—(1296)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The term ‘absolutely’ has been added in view of the fact that some sort of indirect distinction *is* admitted; inasmuch as his view is that the

Universal and other qualifications are different as well as non-different (from the qualified), but not absolutely different, or absolutely non-different. He has asserted as follows:—“As their cognitions are distinct, Colour, etc. cannot be one and the same; what is held is that they are one as well as diverse, as conceived in the form of ‘Being’ (when they are *one*) and in the form of ‘Colour’, etc. (when they are diverse)”,—(*Ślokavārtika*, Sense-perception, 158).—He has again asserted that—“For us, the Universal and the rest are not other than the Individual”—(*Ślokavārtika*, Sense-perception, 141).—‘*Paratvam*’, ‘difference’, here stands for⁵ other than’.

‘*In keeping with itself*’—i.e. tinged with the form of the qualifying factors; as the *qualification* is so called only because it brings about the apprehension of the qualified thing which is tinged by the qualifying factor; otherwise, it would not be a *qualification* at all; as it has been declared that—‘The Qualification is so called because it colours the qualified thing with its own cognition’.—(1296)
