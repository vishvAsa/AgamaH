> “The ‘first end’ of the Veda consists in the idea of its being the work of an author,—and the ‘other end’ consists in its being destroyed; and the negation of these (two ends) means ‘eternality’.”—(2103)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

How the rejection of the ‘two ends’ automatically proves *Eternality* is explained in the following:—[*see verse 2103 above*]

As a matter of fact, ‘Eternality’ and ‘Having the two ends’ are mutually exclusive,—one involving the negation of the other; and between two mutually exclusive ideas, the absence of one is always concomitant with the presence of the other; as has been already pointed out.—(2103)

The other party urges—If the ‘negation of the two ends’ constitutes *Eternality*, then it comes to this that *Eternality* is not a positive quality of things.
