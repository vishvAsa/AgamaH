## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following argument might be urged against *Sumati*:—‘There is no such thing as the *Thing itself* which could be apprehended as qualified by a character; what there *is* is, only that *qualified thing* which is held by you, and also by me, to be the Particular (or Individual); it is this only that exists and is apprehended’.

To this *Sumati* makes the following answer:—[*see verse 1269 above*]

“The term ‘*mātra*’, ‘itself’, in the Opponent’s statements stands for the Universal, that which is called ‘Being’; and absolutely independent of this Universal, there is no Particular (or Individual) which could be apprehended.—It might be said—‘Under your view there may be such a Universal, but this is not touched at all at the time of the apprehension’.—Our answer to that is—*If this is not quite char in the apprehension, that is due to its having become devoid of Being*;—that is, if, at the time of apprehension, the said Universal ‘Being’ is not touched by Sense-perception,—and the Particular (or Individual) alone is apprehended,—then this Particular by itself, if apprehended at all, would be devoid of existence, as devoid of the character known as ‘Being’;—and thus it could become characterless; and as such could not be apprehended by Sense-perception, because it would be *devoid of Being*,—having lost its Being or Existence, and become like the ‘sky-flower’.”—(1269)
