> Even though the character of the ‘entity’ does not belong to the reflection as a corporeal object, yet how can the cognition envisaging the relection be regarded as objectless? And it is this latter (cognition), that is regarded here as the ‘effect’ and the ‘inferential indicative’; and though itself without a material basis, the cognition appears under the influence of the reflected object which is therefore regarded as its cause.—(1428-1429)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It is only the Cognition of the form of the Reflection that is regarded as the *effect*, and hence the Inferential Indicative, and not any *external* object-in the shape of the ‘Reflection’.—(1428-1429)
