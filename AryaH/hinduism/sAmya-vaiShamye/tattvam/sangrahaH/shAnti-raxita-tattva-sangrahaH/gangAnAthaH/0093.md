> \(b\) As regards the second alternative, that cannot be accepted by the other party; and for that very reason, it could not be the effect of some other cause.—(c) Nor can it be self-sufficient; as it appears only at certain times.—(106)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Apart from Primordial Matter and God, no other Cause is admitted by the*Sāṃkhyas*, from which the said ‘manifested form’ could be produced.—Nor is the third alternative right; this is what is asserted by the words ‘*nor can**it**be self-sufficient*’.—(106)
