## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* points out the futility of assuming the Omniscient Person:—[*see verse 3138 above*]

‘*Components*’—Hands and Feet, etc.—‘*Individuals*’—in the shape of the particular trees, *Dhava*, *Khadira*, *Palāśa* and so forth.—‘*Samasta*, *etc*.’—all components and individuals;—the ‘*details*’ of these are in the shape of atoms, hairs, leaves and so forth;—one who has the knowledge of all this is ‘*Samasta*... *jñāna*’,—the term ‘*jñāna*’ standing for *one who knows*—the ‘*Lyuṭ*-affix’ in ‘*jñāna*’ denoting the active agent;—any attempt to prove,—establish the presence of—such a *knower*—would be absolutely futile; that is, because, being *impossible* and not having any bearing upon *Dharma and Adharma*, it can be of no use in fulfilling any purpose of man.—(3138)

This same idea is further supported by means of an illustration:—[*see verse 3139 next*]
