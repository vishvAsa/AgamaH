> If the word ‘blue’ does not denote the substance related to the quality and the universal (blue) as related to the universal ‘lotus’,—then the substance as related to the universal ‘lotus’ should be something totally different; as a matter of fact, what is related to the universal ‘lotus’ is that same substance that is related to the other two (quality and universal ‘blue’); and that substance has already been expressed, in its entirety—not in part,—by the word ‘blue’,—and has also been apprehended by the verbal cognition brought about by that word;—so that the word ‘lotus’ would be entirely useless.—(1112-1114)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“Though the same Substance is denoted by the word ‘blue’, and also by the word ‘Lotus’,—yet the word ‘blue’ denotes the Substance, not as something related to the Universal ‘Lotus’, but as related to the Quality *Blue* and the Universal ‘Blue’; consequently, the word ‘Lotus’ is used for the purpose of expressing the fact of the substance being related to the Universal ‘Lotus’; and as such it cannot be useless.”

This argument is raised and answered in the following:—[*see verses 1112-1114* above]

If the word ‘blue’ does not denote the Substance related to the Quality and the Universal ‘Blue’, as related to the Universal ‘Lotus’,—then (there is the following incongruity).

The *substance* *as related to the Universal* ‘*Lotus*’ is not something entirely different from the *substance as related to the Quality and Universal* ‘*Blue*’,—on the basis whereof on the denotation of the Substance related to the Quality and Universal ‘Blue’, there might be no denotation of the Substance as related to the Universal ‘Lotus As a matter of fact, however, there is no difference between the correlatives in the two cases; and hence the two substances must also be the same; and hence it cannot be right that on the denotation of one there should be no denotation of the other.

Further, even admitting what has been said,—the substance related to the Universal ‘Lotus’ may be different from that related to the Quality and the Universal ‘Blue’; even so the word ‘Lotus’ would be useless. Because that impartiteng which is related to the Universal ‘Lotus’ is exactly what is related to the two factors of the Quality and the Universal ‘Blue’,—it is not anything different from it; and as that thing is impartite, it must have been denoted *in its entirety*, by the word ‘blue’; and it would also have figured in the Verbal Cognition—brought about by that word hence what would be left there undenoted in the denoting of which the word ‘Lotus’ would have its use?—(1112-1114)
