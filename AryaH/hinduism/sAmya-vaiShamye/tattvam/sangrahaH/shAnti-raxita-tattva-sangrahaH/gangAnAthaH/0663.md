> “Those who have admitted the universal ‘negation of the non-cow’ as the import of the word have, by the expression, admitted the universal ‘cow’ as an entity.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 1]—(915)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author next proceeds to set forth objections against *Apoha*, from the point of view of *Kumārila*:—[*see verse 915 above*]

*Kumārila* has argued as follows:—“When the Universal ‘Negation of the Contrary’ is asserted to be the Import of words, it could be either in the form of ‘Preclusion’ or ‘the negation of what is possible’;—If it be the former, then the Proposition is open to the charge of being ‘futile’,—inasmuch as we also hold that what is denoted by the word ‘Cow’ is the *Universal* named ‘Cow’; and this is exactly what you also assert in other words when you declare that ‘what is denoted by the word *Cow* is the *Universal* in the shape of the *negation of the non-cow*’; so that the dispute is only in regard to the name (of the Universal).”—(915)

*Question*:—How is it the same thing asserted in different words?

*Answer*—[*see verse 916 next*]
