> I think that the sūtra (*nyāya-sūtra* 1.1.36) has been composed for the purpose of proving and disproving the mind as postulated by the Buddha, and the other philosopher (respectively),—and hence it has been repeated with an additional ‘*a*’ (‘not’).—(633)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* jokingly confirms the same ‘contradictory’ character of the opponent’s Reason—[*see verse 633 above*]

I think as follows:—The *Sūtra* ‘*Yugapajjñānnāupapattirmanasoliṅgam*’ (‘The fact that cognitions do not appear simultaneously *is*—and *is not*—indicative of the Mind’,—*Nyāya-sūtra* 1. 1. 16) is meant to *prove* the ‘Mind’ as conceived by the *Buddha*,—and to *disprove* the same as conceived by the other philosopher; for the latter purpose an additional ‘a’ (‘not’) being read (before ‘*liṅgam*’, ‘indicative Such is the sense of the *Text* as a whole.

The meaning of the words is now described:—The compound ‘*Saugata*—*siddhaye*’ is to be expounded as ‘for the purpose of the proving and disproving, respectively, of the Mind, as postulated by the *Bauddha* and the other Philosopher’,

*Question*:—“How can one and the same Sütra express two mutually contradictory meanings?”

*Answer*:—‘*With an additional a (not*)’;—that is to say, as applied to the view of the other philosopher, the words of the *Sütra* are to be construed as ‘for the *disproving*—*asiddhi*—of the Mind postulated by the other philosopher’,—with an ‘a’ (before ‘*liṅgam*’);—and it is different when applied to the view of the Buddhist, in which case it is without the said ‘*a*’ (‘not’).

*Question*:—“How can one and the same expression be *with*, and also *without*, the syllable ‘*a*’ (‘not’)?”

*Answer*:—It is ‘*repeated*’;—i.e. in such a case, the repetition of the expression is justified.—(633)

*End of the Chapter on* ‘*Substance*’,
