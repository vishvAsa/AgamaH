> The assertion that—“the Veda alone—and nothing else—is able to provide knowledge of the past, etc.—could be true only if the non-existence of the other sources were certain.—(3312)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following assertion has been made by you *Mīmāṃsakas*—“The Veda can make known such things as the past, the present, the future, the subtle, the hidden and so forth; which cannot be done by any other Sense-organ” (*Śabara-Bhāṣya* 1. 1. 2).—This is also a mere assertion without any reason,—based upon sheer faith.—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 3312 above*]

‘*Nothing else*’—in the shape of Perception by the Omniscient Person and so forth.

‘*The non-existence of other sources*’;—if it were quite certain that the other source, in the shape of the Omniscient Person is non-existent,—then alone, not otherwise, could it be reasonable to make the above assertion; as any such restriction would, under the circumstances, be meaningless.—(3312)
