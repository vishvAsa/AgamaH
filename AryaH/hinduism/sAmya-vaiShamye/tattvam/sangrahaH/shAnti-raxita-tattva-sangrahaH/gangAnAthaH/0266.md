> There can be no distinction in cognition as ‘wrong’ and ‘right’—if the ‘soul’ consists of a single (eternal) cognition; how then can there be any ‘bondage’ and ‘liberation’?—(333)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

For one who holds the view that—Cognition is in perpetual flux, different with different persons, undergoing variations in a series,—the notion of ‘Bondage and Liberation’ is quite reasonable, as being due to the coming about of a series of cognitions, wrong and right; and through the practice of *yoga*, gradually purer and purer Cognitions coming about, the series of *impure* cognitions cease and the final Aim (of Liberation) is attained; and thus the attempt at Liberation becomes fruitful.—For you, on the other hand, the ‘Soul’ is of the nature of *one Eternal Cognition*; how then can there be any ‘Bondage’ and ‘Liberation’ for such a Soul? Because if the *one Cognition* is eternally *wrong*, then, as there could be no other state for it, there could be no possibility of ‘Liberation’; on the other hand, if the one Cognition were eternally *right*, then as it would be always pure, there could be no ‘Bondage’.—As regards our doctrine, the Cognition is held to be defective (wrong) or pure (right), in accordance with the varying character of the Series (in which it appears), and hence the notion of ‘Bondage and Liberation’ is entirely reasonable. This has been thus declared—‘Cognition is defective and free from defects, beset with impurities and free from impurities; if it were never *impure*, then all embodied beings would be always *liberated*; if it were never *pure*, then the attempt to secure Liberation would be fruitless’.—(333)
