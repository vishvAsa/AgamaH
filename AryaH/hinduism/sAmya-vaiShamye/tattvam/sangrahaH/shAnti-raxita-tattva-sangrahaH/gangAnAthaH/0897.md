> That sense-perception is ‘free from conceptual content’ is recognised very clearly; since it is found that even when one has his mind attracted by something else, he has the perception of the blue colour and other things through his senses.—(1243)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged:—“Conceptual Content may be as described. But how does Sense-perception become proved to be ‘free from Conceptual Content’?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1243 above*]

This shows that the absence of Conceptual Content is clearly perceived in one’s own experience.—(1243)
