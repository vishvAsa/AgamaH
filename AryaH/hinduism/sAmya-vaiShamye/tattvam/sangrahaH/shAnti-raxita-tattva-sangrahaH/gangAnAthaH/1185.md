> If the ‘general’ and the ‘particular’ were of the nature of each other, commingling and confusion would be inevitable; hence it cannot be possible that every entity has two aspects.—If they are not of the nature of each other, then they are diverse (two distinct things), and hence it does not follow that there are ‘two aspects’ (of a single entity).—(1722-1723)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

There are two alternatives possible: (1) The ‘General’ is the same as the ‘Particular’ and (2) The ‘General’ is something different from the ‘Particular’.

In the former case, the Particular and the General being of the nature of one another, there would be commingling and confusion; the result of which would be that it could not be discerned that ‘this is General and that is Particular’; which means that there cannot be two aspects of the same entity.

If, in order to avoid the confusion, the latter alternative is accepted, even so, the two being regarded as not of the nature of each other,—there would be ‘diversity’—difference of nature between the General, and the Particular; thus there would be no confusion between the two, only if the two were entirely different; but even so,—even when the two are different,—there are *two things*, and not *two aspects* of one thing.

The following might be urged—Even when there has come about a difference in the nature of the General and the Particular, the entity that exists in the form of the General and the Particular is one and the same”.

This however will be a contradiction in terms. For instance, if the General and the Particular are regarded as *non-different* from one and the same thing, how could there be any difference in the nature of those two themselves? Being non-different from one and the same thing, they must be non-different from one another,—like the nature of any single entity. When however the difference between the nature of the General and that of the Particular is accepted, there could not be any single thing that would be non-different from those two; because being non-different from the two, what is meant to be *one* would have to be regarded as *two*,—like the form of the General and the form of the Particular.

From all this it follows that the assertion that “every entity has two aspects” involves self-contradiction.—(1722-1723)
