> “Though in the case of other words, a positive entity may be what is ‘excluded’,—yet in the case of the word ‘*sat*’ (‘being’), nothing apart from ‘negation’ is regarded as ‘excluded’.—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 98]—(958)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might he urged—‘What are *excluded* by the words *Cow* and *Horse* are only the Specific Individualities as excluded from one another; and it is not *Negations* that are excluded; hence the contingency of their becoming positive entities cannot be unacceptable to us’.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 958 above*]

In the case of words other than ‘Being’—e.g. such words as ‘Cow’ and the rest,—it may be that what is excluded is an entity, in the form of the *Hill* and other things; but in the case of the word ‘Being’ itself, there is nothing that could be held to be excluded except that which is called ‘Negation’; that is, Negation alone can be excluded; because the word ‘Being’ is used only in the sense of excluding what is *non-being*, (Nonexistent).—(958)

*Question*:—‘What is the harm if that is so?’

*Answer*:—[*see verse 959 next*]
