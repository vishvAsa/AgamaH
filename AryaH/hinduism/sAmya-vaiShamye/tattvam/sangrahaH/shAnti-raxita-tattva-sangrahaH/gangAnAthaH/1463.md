> “As thebe would be difference between the ideas of the speaker and the hearer (in regard to the connection),—the use of the word would become vitiated; as the idea of the connection in the mind of the speaker would be one, while that in the mind of the hearer would be totally different—[*Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra*, 21-22].—(2256)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Difference between the ideas*’—The complete phrase should be ‘difference between the Connection that forms the *object* of the ideas’.—Hence the sense comes to be this:—The object, the matter, that figures in the ideas of the Speaker and the Hearer,—being different, there could be no usage based upon the idea of the denotation (of the Word) being one and the same. *Question*:—Why so?

*Answer*:—‘*As the connection in the mind*, *etc. etc*.’.—(2256)
