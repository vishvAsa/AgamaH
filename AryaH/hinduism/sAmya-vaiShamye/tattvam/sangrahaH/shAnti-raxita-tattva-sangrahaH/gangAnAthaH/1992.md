## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that the Omniscient Person cannot be cognised by means of the *Word*:—[*see verse 3187 above*]

That Cognition is ‘verbal’ which proceeds from Words, in regard to things not in close proximity to the man. It is of two kinds—that produced by the eternal Word, and that produced by the utterances of men. As asserting the existence of the Omniscient Person, there is no eternal scriptural Word; hence the former verbal Cognition is not possible in this case.—What we read in the *Upaniṣads* regarding ‘Him who is truthful in word, truthful in volution, truthful in desires—He should be sought after, He should be sought to be known’, and so forth,—all this should be understood to be merely commendatory.

As regards the human assertion that is quoted, such as—‘The Blessed Lord the *Tathāgata*, the *Arhat*, is Truly Enlightened, etc.’,—no reliability can attach to such assertions. How then could any reliable information be deduced from such an unreliable source?—(3187)
