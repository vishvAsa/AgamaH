## Kamalaśīla

Others however,—like *Vātsīputrīyas*—hold that there is a further classification of things under the two heads of ‘momentary’ and ‘non-momentary’; that is, according to these people, suchngs as Cognition, Sound, Light-rays, are ‘momentary’, while such things as Earth and *Ākāśa* are ‘non-momentary—(352)
