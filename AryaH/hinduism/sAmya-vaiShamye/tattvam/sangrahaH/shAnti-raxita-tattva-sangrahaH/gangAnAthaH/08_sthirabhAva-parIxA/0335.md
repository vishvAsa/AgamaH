> If the said idea had a non-entity for its cause, then it would be produced constantly; as the non-entity cannot need anything else, being always devoid of distinctions.—(427)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*;—“What is the Proof that annuls the idea of the said notion actually arising out of the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 427 above*]

The compound ‘*abhāvakāraṇatve*’ is to be expounded as ‘the character of having a non-entity,—like the *sky-lotus*,—for its cause’, If the idea had such a non-entity for its cause then the idea of the *skyāotus* and suchngs would be produced constantly; because its cause would be always present in its perfect form. Nor can it be said to be dependent upon the help of other things, as by its very nature it is incapable of being helped by anything else; hence its activity towards producing its effect could not be hold to bo occasional on account of the occasional absence of such aids.—(427)
