> “Even though the permanent thing may not actually need the auxiliary agencies, yet, apart from these latter, it cannot produce its effect, like the final cause; its own nature is such that it becomes an efficient cause only when in close proximity to the auxiliaries; hence it is that even though the permanent thing is always present, its effect does not come about always.”—(409-410)



## Kamalaśīla

The ‘na’ (at the end of the second line) goes with ‘*kārakaḥ*’, ‘*Like the Final Came*’;—this is meant to be the Corroborative Instance *per dissimilarity*; or it may be taken as the Corroborative Instance *per similarity* in support of the proposition stated in the last line ‘*it becomes an efficient came*, etc,’ The term ‘*hetuvat*’ is to be analysed as ‘*hetoḥ*’ (with the genitive ending) ‘*iva*’, ‘*Even though the Permanent thing, etc*.’—i.e., even though the Permanent Thing is always there.—(409-410)
