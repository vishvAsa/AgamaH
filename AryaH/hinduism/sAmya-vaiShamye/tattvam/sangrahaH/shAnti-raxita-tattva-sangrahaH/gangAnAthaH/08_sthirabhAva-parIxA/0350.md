## Kamalaśīla

It is only right that what has been ascertained through Inference should be concluded to be otherwise, on the strength of Sense-perception; because this latter is the highest among the Means of Cognition; but Inference and the rest can never alter the nature of ang as cognised through Sense -perception; as they are weaker.

‘*Firmly established*’,—i.e. free from Doubt and Mistake.

‘*To the contrary*’,—i.e. otherwise than that cognised through Sense-perception.—(456)
