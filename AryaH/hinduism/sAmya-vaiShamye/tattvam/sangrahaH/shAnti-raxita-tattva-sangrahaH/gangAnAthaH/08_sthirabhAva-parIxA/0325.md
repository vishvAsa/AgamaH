> This may be so; but if the character of the permanent thing in its complete form (along with its auxiliaries) be held to be the same as that of it in its incomplete form (without the auxiliaries), then the auxiliaries also should be permanent (eternal).—(411)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The above theory may be all right; but what has to be examined here is this—The character that belongs to the Permanent Thing in its complete form as fully equipped with its auxiliaries,—is this character the same as that of the sameng in its incomplete form (without the Auxiliaries)? Or is it different from this latter?—If it is the same, then the auxiliaries should be regarded as permanent.—(411)
