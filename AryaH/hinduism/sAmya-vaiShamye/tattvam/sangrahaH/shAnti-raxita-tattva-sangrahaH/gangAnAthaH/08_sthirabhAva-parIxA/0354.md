> The character of ‘being in accordance with the real state of things’ being equally present in all forms of valid cognition,—why should there be a prejudice at all?—In case the said character be not present in inference and the rest, then these latter would not be valid means of right cognition at all.—(460)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 456) that—“Sense-perception is the highest among the Means of Right Cognition”;—that also is not true. This is shown in the following—[*see verse 460 above*]

The ‘validity’ of the Means of Right Cognition consists only in their having the capacity to bring about the *right* notion of things; and if this is admitted as belonging to all the Means of Right Cognition,—then, why should Perception be regarded as the ‘highest’ among them?—It might be said that “it is Perception alone that is in strict accordance with the real state of things”,—then, *this character of being in strict accordance with the real state of things* being absent in Inference and the rest, these latter would not be ‘Means of Right Cognition’ at all; because the very idea of being a ‘Means of Right Cognition’ is based upon *accordance with the real state of things*; and this (*ex hypothesi*) would be absent in Inference and the rest.—(460)
