> When it is said that ‘there is annihilation of the thing’, what is meant is that ‘the thing is not there’, and it is not meant to convey the affirmation (predication) of any thing.—(379)



## Kamalaśīla

Even though the assertion ‘there is Annihilation of the thing’ appears to be affirmative of Annihilation, yet what is really meant is only the *negation* of the Thing itself, and not the *affirmation* of any positive entity.—(379)
