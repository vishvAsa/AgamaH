> If *ākāśa*, time and such things are existent, then, being so, they cannot escape from being momentary,—just like the created things.—(391)



## Kamalaśīla

Thus it has been shown that if *Ākāśa* and the rest are regarded as *uncreated*, they must be regarded as being *non-existent*; and it is now going to be shown that if they are regarded as *existent*, they must be *momentary*:—[*see verse 391 above*]

‘*Kṛtāḥ*’—stands for ‘*kṛtakāḥ*’, ‘created things’.

This indicates ‘being’, ‘existence’, as the Reason (for regarding things as *momentary*).—(391)

This Reason is stated more explicitly:—[*see verses 392-394 next*]
