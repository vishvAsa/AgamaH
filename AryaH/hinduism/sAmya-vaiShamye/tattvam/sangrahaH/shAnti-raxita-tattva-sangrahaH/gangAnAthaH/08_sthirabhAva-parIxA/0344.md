> If the recognition did apprehend the form of the thing as previously cognised, then it would have appeared at that same time, as its object would be the same,—like the previous cognition.—(448)



## Kamalaśīla

If the Recognition had the same object that has been cognised before, then it would have appeared at that same time,—because as having the same object, its cause would be there in its perfect form; like the previous cognition;—‘*as its object would be the same*’;—i.e. the object of the Recognition would be that same object which has been cognised before.—(448)
