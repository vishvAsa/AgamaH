> If it be held that—“the ‘destruction’ (‘*nāśa*’) brought about is of the nature of the ‘negation of entity otherwise called ‘disruption’ (*pradhvaṃsa*’),—there can be no reasonable cause for that also.—If negation were an effect, then it would be an entity, like the sprout and other effects; because while there is possibility of its being regarded as something ‘not-produced’, it is found to come about through the potency of a cause.—(363-364)



## Kamalaśīla

The following Text proceeds to show that the ‘Destruction’ of a thing cannot be of the nature of a *non-entity*:—[*see verses 363-364 above*]

What is brought about, produced, is always an *entity*, not a non-entity, because of the latter, which is of the nature of the absence of positive character that could be predicated of it, there is no form that could be *produced*. Hence *what is of the nature of the negation of entity*, i.e. what consists of the denial of existence,—cannot be brought about by anything,—simply because it is a non-entity,—like the ‘Hare’s Horns’, Otherwise (if it were something *produced*) then it would be an ‘effect’, and as such an *entity*,—like the sprout and other effects. This argument may be formulated as follows:—What is an *effect* must be an *entity*, as the sprout and other things,—and Destruction is an effect (*ex hypothesi*), hence this is a natural reason (for regarding it as *an effect*).

The author states the ‘invariable concomitance’ (Premiss) of this reasoning—*Because it is found to come about through the potency of a Cause*. As a matter of fact, that alone is said to be an ‘effect’ which acquires an accretion to its nature through the potency of a Cause; and it is only an *entity* that can acquire such accretion to its nature.

This point is not disputed even by the *Naiyāyika* and others: As these people also declare the character of the ‘effect’ to be either ‘inherence in Being’ or ‘inherence in a Cause’; and *Destruction* cannot inhere either in Being or in its Cause; for, if it did, then, like Substance and otherngs, it would have to be regarded as a *substratum of* ‘*existence*’ (i.e. an *entity*).—(363-364)

Says the opponent—“If that is so, let the *Destruction* be an entity, what is the harm in that?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 365 next*]
