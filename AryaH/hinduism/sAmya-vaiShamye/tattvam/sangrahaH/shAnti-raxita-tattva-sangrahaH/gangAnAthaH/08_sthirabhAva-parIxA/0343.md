> In fact, recognition can never be of the nature of direct sense-perception; because the form of the thing itself is inexpressible, and the recognition is expressed in words.—Recognition must be wrong, and sense-perception is entirely different from it. That recognition is wrong is clear from the fact that it appears in the form of the notion of ‘non-difference’ where, in reality, there is difference.—(446-447)



## Kamalaśīla

The very fact of the said Recognition being of the nature of Perception is not admitted. Because the real character of a ‘Thing’ is inexpressible in words, because of the absence of contiguity; hence its real cognition can only be in the form of a mental apprehension; specially because when the Thing has not been apprehended as related to any words, it cannot be possible to apprehend it along with a verbal expression. Hence a Real Perception, pertaining as it does to the specific individuality of things, must be *beyond all imposition*, *indeterminate*. And as such Perception would be entirely valid, it cannot be wrong. This is the reason why wise men have declared the definition of Perception to be that ‘it is free from all determination, and not mistaken’, which is perfectly logical.—*Recognition*, on the other hand, is *not* ‘free from determination’, as it is always conceived in the verbal form ‘this is that same’; nor is it *unmistaken*, because it apprehends, as *non-different*, things that are really *different*.—(446-447)

*Question*:—“How is it so?”
