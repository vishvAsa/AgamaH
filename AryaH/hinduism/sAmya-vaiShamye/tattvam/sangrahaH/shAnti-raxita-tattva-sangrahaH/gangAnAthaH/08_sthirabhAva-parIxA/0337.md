> Our answer to the above is as follows:—There can be no mutual help in the case of things appearing at the ‘initial stage’; they become auxiliaries only by virtue of having the same effective action. even when there is no help rendered to one another, these are not entirely undifferentiated; because when they are themselves produced out of their own constituent cause, they become productive of their own several distinct ‘series’.—(435-436)



## Kamalaśīla

The effect is produced only from a cause that is efficient; and yet auxiliaries are not entirely useless. Because the Auxiliary is of two kinds—(1) that which serves the same purpose, and (2) that which renders mutual help;—in the case of the effect appearing immediately, the auxiliary can be of the former kind only, not of the latter kind; because at one and the same moment one could not produce any peculiarity in the other, as it remains impartite (undifferentiated);—in the case of the remoter effect, however, the auxiliary is of that kind where there is mutual help; as the qualified succeeding moment is produced mutually out of both, and the remote effect is produced by mutual help in reference to its own ‘series Thus then, as regards those that appeared at the initial stage, there can be no differentiation from one another; and yet there can be nothing incongruous in their rendering mutual help; inasmuch as they serve the same purpose. But they are not *undifferentiated* in regard to the producing of the immediately following particular ‘moment’; as the entire series of the succeeding effects is produced out of its own preceding ‘causal ideas’, and each member of this series is equally efficient in producing the said effects. These ‘Causal Ideas’ are produced from their own ‘Causal Ideas’,—these again from other Causal Ideas’ of their own; and thus there is an endless series of causes.—Even if there is an Infinite Regress, that is nothing undesirable. Even though each member of the series is efficient, yet the others are not useless; as they also have been produced as so efficient, through the potency of their own causes. Nor is it possible for them to have a separate existence, as there is no cause for it. Nor can it come later on, as all things are momentary.

‘*They become productive of their own several distinct series*’;—that is, they are capable of producing the set appearing at the second moment.—The term ‘their own constituent cause’ should be understood to have been added for the purpose of precluding the usefulness of an auxiliary that appears at the initial stage. And it is not possible for any effect to be produced entirely from its own constituent cause, as everything becomes possible with the help of attending circumstances. This has been thus declared—‘Nothing can come out of any singleng, all is possible out of the attendant circumstances’.—(435-436)
