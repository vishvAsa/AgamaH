> “As it comes immediately after the thing, the destruction must have a cause; also because, not having been in existence, it comes into existence,—just like the following moment.”—(369)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Thus three reasons have been stated: Destruction must have a Cause, (*a*) because it is occasional, (b) because it comes immediately after theng, as admitted by the *Bauddhas*, and (c) because not having been in existence, it comes into existence, like the following Moment. The ‘Hare’s Horn’ and such other non-entities serve as Corroborative Instances *per dissimilarity*.—(369)
