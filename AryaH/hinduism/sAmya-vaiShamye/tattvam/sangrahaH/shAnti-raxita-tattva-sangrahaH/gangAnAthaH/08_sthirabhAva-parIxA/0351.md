> If existence at the present time is held by you to be distinct from the previous existence, then difference between them becomes proved by yourself.—(457)



## Kamalaśīla

With the following *Text*, the Author answers the above arguments of *Kumārila*:—[*see verse 457 above*]

It has been asserted that the object of Recognition is *existence at the present time*;—is this *present existence* different from the *existence* apprehended by the previous Perception? Or, is it the same? If it is different, then *difference* being proved by your own assertion, there is contradiction of your own doctrine; while for us, it is what is desired by us.—(457)
