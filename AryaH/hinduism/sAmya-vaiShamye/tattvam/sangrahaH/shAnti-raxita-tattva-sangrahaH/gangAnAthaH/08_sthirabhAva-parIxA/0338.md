## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Thenceforward*’;—i.e. since the moment following the second ‘moment’.

‘*Are brought about by that*’;—that is, produced by the particular causes brought about by the auxiliaries.

“How so?”

‘*On account of, etc. etc*.’;—i.e. because their nature is of that character,—i.e. produced by particular causes brought about by particular auxiliaries, ‘*Those that help towards them*’;—this should be construed with the preceding phrase ‘*because their nature is of that form*’; and the particle ‘*ca*’ has to be understood as before the phrase ‘*Those that help towards them*’, The meaning thus is as follows:—Towards the effect that comes into existence at the third moment, the particulars that have appeared during the second moment are helpful, as its cause; and those that are so helpful have the character of having a nature which is capable of producing the effects producible by the particulars brought about by the auxiliaries; so that the particulars appearing at the third moment are all brought about by these.—(437)

*Question*—“How does this restriction become applicable to these?”

*Answer*.—[*see verse 438 next*]
