> That thing which, having a momentary existence, is called ‘destruction’,—this destruction we also admit as having a muse; it is only the other kind of destruction which we regard as without cause, on the ground of there being nothing else (which could be its cause).—(375)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*.—“If that is so (and you admit what we have argued), then why have you held Destruction to be ‘without cause’?”

The Answer is—‘*It is only the other kind etc. etc*.’; i.e. *there being nothing else*,—apart from the Cause that brought the thing into existence,—coming later on, in the shape of the Bludgeon and such things,—that we regard the Destruction to be *without cause*.—(375)
