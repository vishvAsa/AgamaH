> “If the omniscient person is recognised as such on the strength of his own word,—how could this be regarded as established, in view of the mutual interdependence of both?”—(3188)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—We do not accept the Omniscient Person on the strength of any and every stray assertion; we do so on the strength of the assertions of that same Blessed Lord, such as—‘I am omniscient, perceiving all things, there is nothing that is unknown to the *Tathāgata*, etc. etc.’. Thus it is on His own word that we accept His omniscience.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3188 above*]

Under the circumstances, there would be an objectionable interdependence.—(3188)

*Question* How so?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 3189 next*]
