## Kamalaśīla

For those people also who assume the diversity of *Apoha* to be based upon *what is excluded* (by it),—even that diversity is not possible without an entity in the shape of the ‘Universal’.—This is shown in the following—[*see verse 933 above*]

If there were some property common to the Horse and all other *non-Cows*, then they could all be ‘excluded’ by the word ‘Cow’; not otherwise; as no other ground for distinction is perceptible. If such a common property is admitted, then the postulating of the *Apoha* becomes useless. Thus, for this reason, there can be no *Apoha*.—(933)
