## Kamalaśīla

The following Text sets forth the objection that applies to all the various' theories on the subject:—[*see verse 906 above*]

*All this*—‘Specific Individuality’, ‘Universal’ and so forth (which has been held to be denoted by words)—is it momentary or not-momentary?—In the former case, as there could be no co-ordination between what existed at the time of the Convention and what exists at the time of Usage,—no Convention could apply to the case at all.—If, on the other hand, it be held that it is all *not-momentary*, then,—inasmuch as what is *successive* cannot proceed from what is *not-successive*, there would be no cognition relating to Words and their Import,—as such cognition can only be *successive*.

‘*Otherwise*’—i.e. if it is *not-momentary*.—(906)
