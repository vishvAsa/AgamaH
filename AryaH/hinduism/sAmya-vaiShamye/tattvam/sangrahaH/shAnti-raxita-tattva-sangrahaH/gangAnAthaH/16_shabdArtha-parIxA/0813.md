> If the application of the genders were based upon the states of continuance, appearance and destruction,—then, all the three genders would become applicable to all things.—(1125)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Some people think that “the three genders in the case of the words cited may be explained as pertaining to the three states of the thing concerned (River-bank),—the three states being those of *destruction*, *appearance* and *continuance*”.

That this also cannot be right is shown in the following—[*see verse 1125* above]

There is a hiatus after ‘*syāt*’ (the conditional clause ending there).

If the ‘*application*’—regulation—of genders were based upon the states of *continuance* and the rest, then all the three genders would he applicable to all things,—like the River-bank, the Chain and so forth. Because, as in the case of the River-bank, so elsewhere also, all the three states of *continuance* and the rest would be there. Otherwise, there should not be three genders in the case of the three words ‘*tataḥ*’, ‘*taṭī*’ and ‘*taṭam*’ also; as there is no difference between the two cases. Thus the definition proposed becomes *too wide*.—(1125)

The definition is ‘too narrow’ also, because it is not true in all cases;—this is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1126 next*]
