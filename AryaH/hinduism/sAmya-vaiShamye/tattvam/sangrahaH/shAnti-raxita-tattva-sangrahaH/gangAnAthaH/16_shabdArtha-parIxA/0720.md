> “Why is the denotation of the word (‘cow’) held to be the Apoha—in the form ‘the cow is not non-cow’? Who has ever attributed the character of the non-cow to the cow—that it is denied here?—It is held that it is the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ in the cow, which forms the denotation of the word;—is this held to be something different from the cow? Or non-different?—If it is different, does it abide—or not abide—anywhere? If it does abide, then it becomes a quality, and the word cannot be denotative of the substance;—and thus as the word ‘cow’ would denote only a quality, there would be no co-ordination in such expressions as ‘the cow moves’, ‘the cow stands—if it does not abide in any thing, then what would be the sense in which it could be mentioned, for the purpose of exclusion, by the term ‘*agoḥ*’, ‘of the non-cow’?—If, lastly, the ‘Apoha’, ‘exclusion of others’ is held by you to be non-different (from the cow),—then it comes to be the same as cow; what more would, in that case, be expressed (by the term ‘Apoha’)?”—(989-994)



## Kamalaśīla

“Further, *Apoha*, *Exclusion*, being an *Action*, it behoves you to point out its object (i.e. the object excluded). That is to say, you explain ‘*Apoha*’ as ‘not being the non-Cow’; now is this object of the *Apoha*, the *Cow* or the *non-Cow*?—If it pertains to the *Cow*, how can there be *negation* of the Cow in the Cow itself?—If, on the other hand, it pertains to the *non-Cow*, how can the *Apoha* or Exclusion of one thing (non-Cow) lead to the comprehension of another thing (the Cow)? Certainly, when the *Khadira* tree is cut, the *cutting* does not fall upon the *Palāśa* tree.—Further, if the phrase ‘the Cow is not the non-Cow’ is explained as the negation, in the *Cow*, of the *non-Cow*,—then you should explain who has ever conceived of the *Cow* as the *non-Cow*,—which conception would be negatived by the said *Apoha*?”

The Arguer regards the first two alternatives as irrelevant, hence he sets forth the third alternative [that there is preclusion, in the *Cow*, of the *non-Cow*]:—[*see verses 989-994 above*]

The particle ‘*ca*’ (in Text, 989) has the collective sense; what is meant by the sentence is—why do you assert the denotation of the word ‘Cow’ to be the *Apoha* in the form of ‘Not non-Cow’?

‘Why should it not be so asserted’? (asks the Buddhist).

The answer is—‘*Who has*, *etc. etc*.’

“For the following reason also *Apoha* cannot be accepted:—Because none of the alternatives possible under that theory is admissible: The *Apoha, or Exclusion*, *of the non-Cow* in the Cow,—is this (A) Different, or (B) Non-different—(from the Cow)?—(A) If it is different; (*a*) does it abide (in the Cow)? Or (6) does it not abide in it?—(a) If it does abide in it, then, inasmuch as it abides in it, it becomes a Quality; that is, the word ‘Cow’ denotes a Quality, and not the Substance, the animal, *Cow*; and tinder the circumstances, there can be no such Co-ordination as that expressed in the words ‘the Cow is standing’, ‘the Cow is moving’,—(*b*) If, on the other hand, it does not abide in it, then what is the significance of the Genitive ending in the phrase ‘*agoḥ apohaḥ*’ (‘the Apoha *of the non-Cow*’)?—(B) If, lastly, the *Apoha* is *non-different* from the *Cow*, then it is the same as the *Cow*, and the postulating of it is entirely futile.”—(989-994)
