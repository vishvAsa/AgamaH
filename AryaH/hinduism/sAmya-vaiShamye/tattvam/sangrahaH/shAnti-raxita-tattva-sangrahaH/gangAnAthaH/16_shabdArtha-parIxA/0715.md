> “In the case of verbs, the ‘exclusion of others’ is never cognised; because in their case there is nothing to be denied which could form the object of exclusion.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 139]—(974)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* proceeds to show that what has been held regarding *Apoha* being the *denoted* and *denotative* is not all-embracing (not applicable to all words).—[*see verse 974 above*]

*In the case of Verbs*—words with conjugational endings, like ‘*pacati*’ (‘cooks’), ‘*gaccati*’ (‘goes’) and the like, wherein action forms the predominant factor, no ‘exclusion of others’ is apprehended;—why?—because ‘*in their case, etc. etc*.’; in the case of nouns—terms like ‘*ghaṭa*’ (Jar), etc.—with declensional endings,—there are certain well-established entities in the shape of the *non-jar*, etc. which are negatived and can figure in the ‘exclusion’ (expressed by the word ‘Jar’); not so in the case of verbs, like ‘*pacati*’, etc. where no well-established counter-entities are ever apprehended.—(974)
