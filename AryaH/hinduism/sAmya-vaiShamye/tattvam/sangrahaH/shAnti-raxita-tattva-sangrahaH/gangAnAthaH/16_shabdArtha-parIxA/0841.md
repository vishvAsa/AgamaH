> Words like this, however, are unconformable, as there is absence of connection. All verbal cognitions do not always envisage things as they actually exist.—(1165)



## Kamalaśīla

*Objection*:—“If it is held that there appears the idea of the negation of what is denoted by the word ‘*Apoha*’,—then *Apoha* only should not be regarded as the denotation of the word; as that is negatived by it.”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1165 above*]

‘*Words like this*’—i.e. Like ‘*ananyāpoha*

‘*Unconformable*’,—i.e. not in conformity with any real state ofngs.

*Question*:—“Why so?”

*Answer*:—‘As *there is absence of connection*’;—i.e, there is no connection with any such thing as is expressed by the word; because any positive entity in the shape of the Universal, etc. as denoted by words has already been rejected.

*Question*:—“If that is so, then how is it that the word ‘*Ananyāpoha*’ brings about the idea of the ‘negation of what is denoted by the word ‘*Apoha*’ (as just declared by you)?”

*Answer*:—‘*All verbal cognitions, etc. etc*.’.—That is, there are some verbal cognitions, as arising out of impressions due to repeated false conceptions, which envisage things that do not exist; and either the existence or non-existence of things cannot be proved on the basis of such cognitions.—(1165)
