> Those things however which appear in the cognition—these internal (subjective) things the word denotes directly; and the fact of these things being qualified by ‘exclusion’ has just been explained.—(1071)



## Kamalaśīla

As regards the thing imposed upon the Cognition, that is denoted by words primarily and directly.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1071 above*]

‘*Ayam*’—stands for the *word*.

*Question*;—“How can the character of being qualified by the *exclusion of other things* be attached to them?”

*Answer*:—‘*The fact, etc. etc*.’

‘*Just*’—that is, under *Text* 1069, it has been explained that things imposed upon the Cognition are excluded (or differentiated) from other things.—(1071)

*Objection*:—“If no objective factor is expressed by the word, then how is it that the Teacher has declared that it is only a certain part of the Thing that is apprehended by the ‘exclusion of otherngs’?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1072 next*]
