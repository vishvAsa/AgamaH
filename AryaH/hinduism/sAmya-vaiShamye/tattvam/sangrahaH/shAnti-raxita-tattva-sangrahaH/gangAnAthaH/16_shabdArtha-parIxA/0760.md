> The externality that is attributed to these exclusions is only assumed (imaginary), not real. in reality, difference and non-difference subsist only in real things.—(1047)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* shows that the said *exclusions* appear as distinct things, only on account of the said assumption,—not in reality:—[*see verse 1047 above*]

*Question*:—“Why is it not real?”

*Answer*:—‘*In reality*, *etc. etc*.’.—(1047)
