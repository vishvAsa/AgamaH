> “Co-ordination is not possible, as the Apohas are different.—if it be held to subsist on the basis of what is denoted, then what sort of ‘subsistence’ would there be between the two?”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 118]—(970)



## Kamalaśīla

*Kumārila* now proceeds to deny ‘co-ordination’—[*see verse 970 above*]

It is only when two words are applied to the same object that there is ‘co-ordination’ between them; and (under the *Apoha-theory*) it is not possible for the words ‘blue’ and ‘lotus’ to apply to the same object; because what are denoted by them are, respectively, ‘the exclusion of the *non-blue*’ and ‘the exclusion of the *non-lotus*’,—and these two are distinct. For instance, it has been asserted by yourself that ‘words have diverse denotations because the things excluded by them are diverse’, The argument may be formulated as follows:—Words like ‘Blue Lotus’ cannot form the object of co-ordination, because they pertain to different things, like the words ‘jar’, ‘cloth’ and so forth.

It might be argued that ‘the exclusion of *non-blue* also stands where there is exclusion of *non-lotus*; and thus the *Apohas* denoted by the two words may be applied to the same thing; and hence, through these denotations, co-ordination may be said to lie between the words also’, ‘*Tat*’ stands for *co-ordination*.

The answer to this is—‘*What sort of subsistence, etc*. *etc*.’—‘*Tayoḥ*—‘*between the two*’,—i.e. between the ‘Exclusion of the *non-blue*’ and the ‘Exclusion of the *non-lotus* That is to say, there can be no real *subsistence* in these; as what is formless cannot subsist anywhere, like the ‘son of the Barren Woman—(970)
