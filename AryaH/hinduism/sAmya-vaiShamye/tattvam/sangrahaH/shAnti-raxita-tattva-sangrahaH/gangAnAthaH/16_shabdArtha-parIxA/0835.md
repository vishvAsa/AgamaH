> Of similar kind would be the Apoha, when a negative is joined with another negative; just as it is apprehended when there are four negatives. in some cases, when a negative is associated with another negative, what is apprehended from it is something positive; the third negative expresses the negation (absence) of that positive thing; and when for the negativing of that again a fourth negative is used, if that is meant to be spoken of, what is denoted by it is the ‘exclusion of another’.—(1154-1156)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under Text, 977, by *Kumārila*) that—“In the case of a negative appearing with another negative, what sort of *Apoha* could be there?”

The answer to this is as follows;—[*see verses 1154-1156 above*]

‘*Taccatuṣṭaya, etc*.’—where there are four negatives.

*Question*:—“In what form is it apprehended?”

*Answer*:—‘*When* *a* *negative*, *etc*. *etc*,’,—The word ‘*arthaḥ*’ is to be taken as co-ordinated with the word ‘*vidhiḥ*’,

‘*Negation of that*’,—i.e. the negation of the said positive thing.

‘*For the negativing of that*’,—i.e. for the negativing of what has been expressed by the third negative (by itself), as apart from the positive factor.

‘*Turīyaḥ*’—is *fourth*;—the form being due to the rule which lays down the addition of the affix ‘*yat*’ in the sense of *making up*, to the term ‘*catur*’, and the elision of the first letter.

‘*If that is meant to be spoken of*’,—i.e. on the use of the fourth negative. ‘*By* *it*’—i.e. by the fourth negative.

‘*The exclusion of another is denoted*’;—i.e. it expresses the Reflection, in the positive form, as differentiated from the negation expressed by the third negative.—(1154-1156)
