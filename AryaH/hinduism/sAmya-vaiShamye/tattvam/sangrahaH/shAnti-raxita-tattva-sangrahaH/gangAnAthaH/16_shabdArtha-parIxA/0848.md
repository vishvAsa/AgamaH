> That they are cognisable in the forms asserted follows from the fact that it has been proved that all things are momentary and so forth. Negation also is cognisable as illusory, as it has been proved that it is in that form.—(1175)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*In the forms asserted*’—i.e. as ‘momentary’ and the rest; as all this has been established by proofs.

*Question*:—“How is Negation cognisable?”

*Answer*:—‘*Negation also is cognisable*, *etc. etc*.’;—‘*in that form*’,—i.e. in the form of Negation.

As a matter of fact, even non-entities are also somehow proved to exist, hence they are regarded as *cognisable*; if they were not so, then there could be no usage regarding them.—(1175)
