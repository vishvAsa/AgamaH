> That Apoha which is in the form of reflection, and which also is called ‘intuition’, is produced by the word also; and we readily regard this as the denotation of words.—(1028)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been urged (under 923, by *Kumārila*) that—“Even in the absence of the external thing, just as there is *Intuition* denoted by the Sentence so would it be in the case of the word also”,

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 1028 above*]

We have described the meaning of the *Sentence* as of the form of Reflection, named ‘Intuition’; so also is the meaning of the word described. Because by the *Word* also, what is produced is the *Apoha* in the form of Reflection; so that for us the *Apoha* in the form of the Reflection is held to be the denotation of the *Word* also, not only of the *Sentence*. This is what is meant by the term ‘also’, Thus there being no difference of opinion between us, the complaint against us is not right.—(1028)
