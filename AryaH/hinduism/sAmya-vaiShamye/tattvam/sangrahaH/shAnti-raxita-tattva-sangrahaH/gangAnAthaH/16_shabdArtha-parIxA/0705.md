## Kamalaśīla

It has been asserted before—(*a*) that ‘they would be differentiated by the excludedngs’ (*Text*, 929), and (*b*) that ‘there can be no difference among *Apohas* because they are non-entities’ (*Text*, 926).—These arguments have been thus answered by certain *Bauddhas*:—‘The difference among *Apohas* is due, not to the difference of substrata, nor to the difference among the excluded things; what happens is that on diverse external objects there are superimposed *Apohas* which are themselves featureless, and consist only in the form of those objects, and hence appearing as diverse; they are so superimposed by cognitions, which, though rather objectless, rest upon diverse unreal objects, and are related to variegated conceptual Impressions extending over all time without beginning;—and being thus superimposed, these *Apohas* appear as diverse and as *existing*; so that the *diversity* and *positive character* of *Apohas* would be due to the diversity of the said Impressions’.

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 960 above*]

As a matter of fact, no one holds the view that Impressions or Tendencies belong to the non-entity.—That there is no *objectless* Cognition has also been thoroughly discussed and proved in course of our examination of Idealism. Hence there can be no conceptions based upon unreal objects; how then can there be any Impression resting upon such conception?

‘*Avastuni*’,—i.e. when there is no Entity which could be its substratum _(;) and when there can be no Cognition without objects,—as there could be no cognition that could produce the Impression—how could there be any Impression? And when there is no Impression, how could the diversity among *Apohas* or their positive character, be due to Impressions?—(960)
