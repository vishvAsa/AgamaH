> What is produced by the word, in due course, is only the reflection; and it is through delusion that this appears as one and as external. The co-ordination and other relations are due to the reflection. In reality, all these words are held to be objectless.—(1120-1121)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“Why is not the objection regarding the *absence of coordination* applicable to the view under which the denotation of words is ‘illusory’?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1120-1121* above]

When the word ‘blue’ is uttered, what it brings about first of all is the conceptual Reflection, excluded (differentiated) from all *non-blue* things, and scintillating over the Lotus and other (blue) things and hence not excluding these latter, and conceived (objectively) in the external form; then when subsequently, the word ‘Lotus’ is uttered, what it brings about is the conceptual Reflection, excluded from all that is *non-lotus*, and with the form of only one externalng superimposed upon it;—in this way, *in due course*, there is brought about an *illusory* (conjunct) conceptual Reflection, excluded from the ‘non-blue’ and the ‘non-lotus’, with the one external form imposed upon it;—and it is in consequence of this that an illusory co-ordination becomes possible.

“Why is it not so, *in reality*?”

*Answer:—In reality, all these words are held to be objectless*.—(1120-1121)
