> [The supposition is]—“It is not by the cognition through the eye alone that the blue and other colours are cognisable,—but also by the one eternal cognition, through the ear also.”—(1172)



## Kamalaśīla

The dull-witted man might suppose that Colour is cognisable also by the Eternal Cognition through the Ear;—and it is this supposition that is ‘excluded’ (negatived) by the sentence ‘Colour is cognisable by the

Cognition through the Eye’; the meaning being that—‘Colour is cognisable by Cognition through the Eye only, *not by Cognition through the Ear and other organs*’.—(1172)
