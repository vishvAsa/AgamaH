> “Difference from the spotted cow is the same in the black cow and in the horse. so that if no other ‘commonalty’ is admitted, whereto would, the Apoha of the non-cow apply?”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 77]—(938)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Whereto, etc. etc*.’—Just as the ‘*Apoha* of the non-Cow’ is not applied to the *Horse*, on the basis of its difference from the *Spotted Cow*,—so, inasmuch as the *Black Cow* also is different from the *Spotted Cow*, the said ‘*Apoha* of the non-Cow’ should not apply to the *Black Cow* also. So also to the *spotted* and other Cows; ‘difference’ being equally present in all cases. [And the Buddhist does not accept any such *commonalty* as that subsisting among all *Cows*, but not in any other animal.]—(938)
