## Kamalaśīla

This argument has been thus stated:—‘They are diverse, through the diversity of the things excluded; but they are absolutely inert in the matter of difference among themselves’, So that, even though there is no difference among the *Apohas* themselves, yet, as there is difference in the Horse and other things excluded (by the *Apoha* denoted by the word ‘Cow’),—there would be difference among the *Apohas* also, which are of the form of the *exclusion of non-cows* (and *non-cows* are many and diverse); thus they could not all be synonymous.—(928)

This answer is rejected in the following—[*see verse 928b above*]

There can be no diversity or plurality in the *Apoha* itself,—because it is of the essence of mere negation. If it were diverse through others,—then this could be only imaginary, not real. Because it is not right that a nature that does not belong to a thing by itself should come to it through others.—(928)

Why should not this be right?
