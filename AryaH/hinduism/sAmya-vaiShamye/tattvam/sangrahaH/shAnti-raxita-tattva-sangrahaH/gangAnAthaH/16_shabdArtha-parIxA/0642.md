> These same arguments serve to set aside such ‘import of words’ as has been held to consist in the denotation of the verb ‘to be’ and the like. still we are going to say something regarding these.—(886)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—“There are other ‘imports of words’, in the shape of what is denoted by the verb ‘to be’ and the like; and as the Convention could be made regarding these, the said Reason remains ‘Unproven’ to that extent.”

The answer to this is supplied by the following—[*see verse 886 above*]

‘*The same arguments*’,—i.e. those urged against Specific Individuality, etc. forming the Import of Words.—[These serve to set aside those]—because this also is included under the said ‘Specific Individuality, etc.’.—(886)
