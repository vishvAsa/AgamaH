## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

There would be incongruity if it were held that both the resultants—affirmation as well as negation—are brought about by the word at the same time; when however, the view is that,—as in the case of ‘not eating during the day’,—only one is brought about directly, while the other is got at only by implication,—then there is no incongruity.

As for the argument (urged in 914) that—“on hearing the word *cow* uttered, the first idea that one should obtain would be that of the *non-Cow*”,—this also is rejected by what has been just said; because no such view as indicated has been held by us; that is to say, we have never held the view that the *negation (exclusion) of the non-cow* is done by the word *directly*; in fact, it has been already explained that this is obtained only by implication,—(1021)
