> The word is used only for the purpose of bringing about the cognition of the thing intended; hence the ‘exclusion of what is not-intended’ becomes apprehended by implication.—(1144)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under 974, by *Rumania*) that—“in the case of Verbs, ‘*the exclusion of other things*’ is not apprehended”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1144 above*]

That “in the case of Verbs the *exclusion of other things* is not apprehended” cannot be admitted. Because when a person uses a word, it is not because he is addicted to such use, but for the purpose of bringing about the cognition,—in the person hearing the word—in regard to a certain thing that is intended, desired, to be known. Consequently, when the desired thing is apprehended, the *exclusion of the undesired thing* also becomes apprehended by implication; as the ‘desired’ and the ‘undesired’ are mutually exclusive.—(1144)
