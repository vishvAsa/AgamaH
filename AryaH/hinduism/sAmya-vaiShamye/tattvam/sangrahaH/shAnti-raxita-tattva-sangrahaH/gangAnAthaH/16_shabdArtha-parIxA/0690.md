> “Unless the cow is established, there can be no non-cow; and if there is no non-cow, how can the cow be there? Between two negations, there can be no such relation as that of the container and the contained and the like.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 85]—(945)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* sums up the same mutual Interdependence:—[*see verse 945 above*]

For the purpose of proving the relation of *qualification and qualified* (between the two), the Teacher *Diṅnāga* has declared as follows:—‘Such terms as *Blue Lotus* and the like signify things qualified by the *negation of other things*’.

The Opponent shows the impropriety of this view, in the words—

‘*Between two negations*, *etc. etc*.’—When between two things, a real relationship is known to exist, then it may be correct to say that one is *qualified* by the other; in the case of the *Blue-Lotus* however, inasmuch as the two are of the nature of the *negation of Blue and negation of Lotus*, which are mere negations, and hence devoid of any form,—there cannot be any such relation between them as that of *Container and Contained* and the like.

The term ‘and the rest’, includes such relations as those of Conjunction, Inherence, Inherence in a common substratum and so forth.

In the absence of any real relation, it is not right that there should be a notion of one being qualified by the other. If it were so, then there would be an incongruity.—(945)
