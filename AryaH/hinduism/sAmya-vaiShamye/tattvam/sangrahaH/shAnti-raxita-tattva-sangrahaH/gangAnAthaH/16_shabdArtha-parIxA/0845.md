## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“What, and in what sentence, is that which is open to doubt in the mind of the dull-witted person,—which is ‘excluded’ by the word in question?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1171 above*]

‘*This*’—i.e. the sentence ‘Colour is cognisable by Visual Perception—(1171)

*Question*:—“What is it that is *supposed*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1172 next*]
