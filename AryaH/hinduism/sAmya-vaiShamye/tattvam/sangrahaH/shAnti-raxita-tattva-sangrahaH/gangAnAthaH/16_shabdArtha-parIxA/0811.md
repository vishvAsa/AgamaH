> There are three words (denoting the same thing)—‘*taṭaḥ*’ (masculine) ‘*taṭam*’ (neuter) and ‘*taṭī*’ (feminine); and yet any one thing cannot have three forms; for if it did, then, all cognitions would have to be variegated in character.—(1123)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* shows that the Reason just adduced cannot be said to be ‘not admitted’:—[*see verse 1123* above]

If Gender really belonged to things, then, on account of the three words—‘*taṭaḥ*’, ‘*taṭam*’ and ‘*taṭī*—in three genders, being applicable to the sameng (Rank of rivers);—the thing would have three forms; and it is not possible for one and the same thing to have the three forms—Masculine, Neuter and Feminine; if it did, it would cease to be *one*ng. If, even in the presence of mutually incompatible properties, things were to be *one*, then the entire universe would become a single thing; and in that case it would all be produced and destroyed at one and the same time.

Then again, on account of all things being expressed, by either one word or by another, as having the three genders, all cognitions relating to them would have to be variegated in character.—(1123)
