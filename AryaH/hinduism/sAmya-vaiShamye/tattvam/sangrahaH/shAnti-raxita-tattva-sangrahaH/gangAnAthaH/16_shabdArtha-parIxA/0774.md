> As a matter of fact, verbal cognition, not taking cognizance of any external object, apprehends its own mark as something external, on account of strong illusion.—This is all that is done by words; and words do not even, touch the object; nor is any object denoted as qualified by Apoha—(1066-1067).



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 945, by *Kumārila*), that—“There can be no relationship *of Container and Contained, etc*. between two negations”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1066-1067 above*]

In reality, no object qualified by *Apoha* is denoted by words. Because it has already been explained that no object is touched by Words anywhere, for the simple reason that the necessary conditions are absent. For example, Verbal Cognition, even though not pertaining to any external object, actually appears as apprehending its own *mark*—i.e. form—as something external; and it does not really touch the form of the object; because its apprehension is not in accordance with the real state of things.—(1066-1067)

*Question*:—“If that is so, then, why has the Teacher declared that ‘words like *Blue-Lotus* express things qualified by the *exclusion of other things*?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1068 next*]
