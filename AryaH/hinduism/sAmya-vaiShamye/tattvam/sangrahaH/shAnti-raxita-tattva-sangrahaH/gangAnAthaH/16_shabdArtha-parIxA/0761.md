> What differ among themselves are the conceptual contents apprehending the said exclusions;—and those differences are due to the influence of their root, the thing as differentiated from several things, and convention. Things, consisting of ‘specific individualities’ do not become either unified or diversified in parts; it is only the conceptual content that varies.—(1048-1049)



## Kamalaśīla

The following Texts proceed to show that in reality it is the assumptions (assumed conceptions) only that differ among themselves:—[*see verses 1048-1049 above*]

‘*Their Root*’,—in the shape of Wind and other Humours, and the Tendency to conceptual thought;—the thing as differentiated from severalngs,—and the Convention;—it is due to the ‘*influence*’—force—of these that the *Conceptual Contents*, apprehending the thing as excluded from several unlike things, become diversified; it is not the *things* that are diversified. For instance, the *Dhava* and other trees do not become *unified* in the form of the *Universal* ‘Tree’; nor do they become diversified, in parts, in the form of the momentary individual trees; all that varies is the conceptual content. This has been thus declared—‘Things by themselves do not become either aggregated or diversified, in reality; that their form is one or many is due to the fluctuations of the Cognition’,—(1048-1049)
