> “As a matter of fact, whenever the said cognition appears in connection with the import of words, it is always in the form of a positive entity; hence in such cases, the import could be assumed to consist of the positive entity only,—a cognition not of the nature of ‘Apoha’.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 39]—(922)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged—‘Even without a substratum (in the external world), the cognition in question would appear in the form of the ‘exclusion of the heterogeneous Cow, etc.’; hence the postulation of the ‘*Apoha*’ is quite right.’

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 922 above*]

‘*Vasturūpā*’;—in the form of a positive entity.

*The said cognition*’,—i.e. the cognition the Horse, without a real substratum in the external world.

‘*In connection with the Import of Words*’,—as relating to the Horse and other things conceived of.

‘*To consist of a positive entity*’;—in the shape of the Idea embracing the notion of the *Horse and other non-cows*.

The effect of the emphasis is explained—*a cognition not of the nature of Apoha*; i.e. that Import of Words, in the shape of Idea, wherein the *Apoha* does not enter at all; the compound ‘*buddhyanapohakam*’ being expounded as ‘the non-exclusion of the Idea’,—i.e. without any *exclusion of other Ideas*.—Or the compound ‘*buddhyanapohakam*’ may be explained as follows—‘*apohaka*’ is *that which excludes*,—‘*anapohaka*’ is that winch *does not exclude*;—the compound thus standing for ‘that which does not exclude the Idea’,—What is meant is as follows;—Though one Cognition is always different from another Cognition, yet when it appears, it does not tend to the exclusion of the other cognition; it always tends to the positive cognition of such entities as the Horse and the like. Consequently the most reasonable thing is to accept the view that what is denoted is a positive entity, not *Apoha*; because one Cognition cannot exclude (be of the nature of the *Apoha*, negation, of) another.—(922)
