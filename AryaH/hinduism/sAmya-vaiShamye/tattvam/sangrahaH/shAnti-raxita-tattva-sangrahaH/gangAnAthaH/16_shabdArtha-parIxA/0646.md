## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* explains what is meant by this ‘Coalescence’:—[*see verse 890 above*]

When the character of the *object* is imposed upon the *Word*—by such expressions as ‘Word is the Object’; on the basis of this imposition, when the form of the Word becomes identified with the Object,—the Word in the state of this unification with the object is said to be ‘in the state of coalescence’.—(890)
