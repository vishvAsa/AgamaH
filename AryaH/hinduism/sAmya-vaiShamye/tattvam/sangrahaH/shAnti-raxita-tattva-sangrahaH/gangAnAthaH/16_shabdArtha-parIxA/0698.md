> “As a matter of fact, the uncommon thing never figures in the cognition; nor again can it be rightly regarded as cognisable, because it is ‘indeterminate’.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 93]—(953)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Nor is it right to assert that—‘the Word and the Indicative operate upon the thing as ‘excluded from others—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 953 above*]

When a thing is ‘excluded from others’, it can, under your doctrine, be only the Uncommon Specific Individuality,—and yet it is your view that this latter does not figure in Cognition brought about by Words and Indicatives—on the ground that it is apprehensible only by ‘indeterminate, *non-conceptual* cognition’, while Cognition born of Words and Indicatives appertains to *commonalty*.

If it he held that this latter Cognition does apprehend the Specific Individuality,—then this cannot be in accordance with Reason; this is what is shown in the words—‘*Nor again can it be rightly*, *etc*. *etc*.’—that is to say, the Uncommon (Specific) Entity cannot be apprehended by Cognition born of Words and Indicatives; because all conceptual ideas are absent in that Entity; as Conceptual Thought operates only through the contact of the ‘Universal’ and such other qualifications and never through the pure *Thing*-*in-itself*.—(953)
