> From the term ‘blue-lotus’, only one thing is cognised,—and that is the reflection excluded (differentiated) from the ‘non-blue’ and the ‘non-lotus’.—(1098)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Texts* 967, etc., by *Kumārila*) that—“If it is held that it is mere *Apoha* that is denoted, etc. etc.”.—The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1098 above*]

What the term ‘Blue-lotus’ expresses is, not mere *negation*, but—the single Reflection of the object—as excluded from the ‘non-blue’ and the ‘non-lotus’,—partaking of the nature of both. Consequently, in the case of words like ‘Blue-lotus’, there certainly is the denotation of things of mixed character,—which has to be admitted on the strength of actual cognitions appearing in that form; and on the basis of this the necessary coordination becomes quite possible.—(1098)
