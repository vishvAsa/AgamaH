## Kamalaśīla

‘*Both*’—i.e. the *denoted* thing as well as the *denotative* Word.

‘*Reflection, etc*.’—The ‘*etcetera*’ is meant to show that even under the view that *Ideas* (Cognitions) are *formless*, it would be necessary to admit the existence, within the Idea itself, of another specific Idea in the form of the conception of ‘object’ where there is no real object.

‘In view *of these*’—i.e.ngs created by imagination.

‘*Tat*’ stands for ‘*tasmāt*’, ‘therefore’, ‘thus’. Or it may mean ‘of that’—i.e. of the Reason,—the ‘falsity’ remains unshaken.—(1094)
