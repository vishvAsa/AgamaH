> “If some one, perceiving the said relation between the nonexistent rain and the non-existent cloud, were to urge ‘inconclusiveness’ against our reason,—then, according to our view, there is an entity in the case cited also; but how could it be under your view?”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 109]—(965)



## Kamalaśīla

*Objection* against the above:—‘There is cognition of the *absence of Bain* from the *absence of clouds* (where both are non-entities); hence the Reason put forward is not conclusive’.

*Answer*:—[*see verse 965 above*]

On seeing that between the Rain and the Cloud both of which are non-existent, i.e. mere negations—[‘*asat*’ in the compound standing for the ‘abstract noun ‘*asattva*’, *non-existence*],—the relation of *denotative and denoted* (indicator and indicated) is present,—if the *Bauddha* were to argue that our Reason,—‘because they are non-entities’—is ‘Inconclusive’,—then that cannot be right; because according to our view, in this ease of the Cloud and Rain also there is an entity present, in the shape of the *clean sky*; because according to us Negation is an entity. For you, *Bauddha*, on the other hand, how could it be? That is, how could there be the relation of *Indicator and* *Indicated* in the case cited? It could not be possible at all.

The particle ‘*api*’, ‘also’, is misplaced; it should have come after ‘*adaḥ*’; so that the meaning is as follows:—It is not only in the case of the two *Apohas* that it is not possible for you to have the relation of *Denoted* and *Denotative* (Indicator and Indicated), it is not possible *also* in the case of the Rain and the Cloud.—(965)
