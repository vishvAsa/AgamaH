> “In that ‘void’ there would be an apprehension of the character of the cognitions themselves of the horse and other things; and in that case it would be useless to posit the ‘Apoha (negation) of others’ as the import of words.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 37]—(920)



## Kamalaśīla

If the ‘Void’ is what is denoted, then it comes to this that in all Verbal Cognitions what is comprehended is only the factor of ‘Cognition’ itself; as *ex hypothesis* there can be no apprehension of the form of any thing external.—“Even so, what is the harm?”—In that case, it would be futile to assert that the *Apoha* is denoted by words; as what would become the Import of Words would be the form of the *Cognition* which would be a *positive* entity independent of all tinge of anything external. What is meant is that in this way there would be a contradiction of your own doctrine—by this Proposition of yours.—(920)

The same idea is further explained:—[*see verse 921 next*]
