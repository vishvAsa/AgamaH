> That thing which is ‘different from the non-cow’ is certainly apprehended by the sense-organs; the reflection also which is superimposed upon it is apprehended by its own cognition. it is on noticing this that people use the word; the recognition of its relation also becomes clearly explained on the same basis.—(1061-1062)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued above (under *Text*, 939, by *Kumārila*) that—“The *Exclusion of the non-Cow* is not apprehended, at first, by the Sense-organs, etc etc”.

The following *Texts* show that this statement is not admissible:—[*see verses 1061-1062 above*]

The *Apoha* in the shape of the ‘Specific Individuality’ is apprehended through the sense-organs themselves.

As for the *Apoha* in the form of the Reflection of what is denoted by the Word, it is really of the nature of Cognition itself, and as such vouched for directly by its own cognition (it being self-cognised).

The particle ‘*ca*’ is meant to include the *Apohas* not directly mentioned. So that the *Apoha* in the form of Absolute Negation also is apprehended by implication; as has been shown under the *Text* 1014, by the words ‘the nature of one is not the nature of the other

Thus it is on noticing the *Apoha* in the form of ‘Specific Individuality’ and the rest, that people come to use words,—not on noticing a positive entity in the shape of the Universal; because no such Universal exists and because no such Universal figures in any cognition. And that through perceiving which people use the words must also be the basis upon which rests the relations of those words,—not on any other basis; if it did, it would lead to absurdity.—(1061-1062)
