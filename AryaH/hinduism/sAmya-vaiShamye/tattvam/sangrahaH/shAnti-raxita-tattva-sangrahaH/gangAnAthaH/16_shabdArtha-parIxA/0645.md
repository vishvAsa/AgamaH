> (*c*) or the real with unreal adjuncts is the ‘import of words’.—(*d*) Or ‘import of words’ may consist in the word itself in the state of ‘*abhijalpa*’ (coalescence).—(889)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Others have declared that the Real with Unreal adjuncts is what is denoted by words, For instance, the adjuncts, in the shape of such details as bracelets, rings and such things, are ‘unreal’ so far as the denotation of the word is concerned; and yet these adjuncts belong to something that is ‘real’—in the shape of the *Gold* which has a generic form and permeates through a number of particular things. This ‘Real with Unreal adjuncts’ forms *the Import of Words*,—i.e. is what forms the denotation of the word.

Others again declare that it is the word itself in the state of ‘Coalescence’ that constitutes the Import of Words.—(889)
