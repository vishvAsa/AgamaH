> Owing to the fact of its not bearing any factor apart from the appearance of its own form, its ‘exclusion from another cognition’ becomes duly apprehended.—(1029)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under 924, by *Kumārila*) that—“the exclusion of one Cognition from another is not apprehended”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1029 above*]

It is because the Cognition does not bear within itself any factor apart from the manifestation of its own form, that—on account of its being restricted within its own form,—the exclusion of one cognition from another becomes apprehended; otherwise, if the Cognition bore the form of another, how could it be apprehended as excluded from that another?

‘*For that reason*’—i.e. because it does not apprehend any form other than its own.—(1029)
