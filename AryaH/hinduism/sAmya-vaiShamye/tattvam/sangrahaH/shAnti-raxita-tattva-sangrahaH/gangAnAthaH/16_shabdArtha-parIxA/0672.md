> “If Apoha formed the import of words, then all words would be synonymous,—those that denote diverse universals, as well as those that denote particulars.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 42]—(925)



## Kamalaśīla

*Kumārila* again shows, by means of an Incongruity, that the doctrine of *Apoha* is contrary to experience:—[*see verse 925 above*]

The words denotative of diverse Universals,—like ‘Cow’, ‘Horse’, etc.—as well as those denotative of Particulars,—the ‘Variegated Cow’, etc.—would all become synonymous for you; as there would be no difference in their meanings,—just like the words ‘*vṛkṣa*’ and ‘*pādapa*’ (both of which denote the *tree* and are hence synonyms).—(925)

*Question*:—Why is there no difference in the meaning?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 926 next*]
