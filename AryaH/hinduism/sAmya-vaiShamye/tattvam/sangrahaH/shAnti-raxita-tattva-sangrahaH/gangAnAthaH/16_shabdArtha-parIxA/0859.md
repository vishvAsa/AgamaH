> For us the word does the ‘negativing of other things’ directly; and after the negativing has been done by the word, it becomes apprehended through its own force,—in the form ‘its nature is not the nature of anything else’,—as has been explained in detail (under text 1013); hence what is urged on the present occasion—‘who has attributed the character of the non-cow to the cow, that it has to be negatived?—Is through ignorance of the view of the other party. As a matter of fact, this is not what is held to be ‘negatived’ by the word directly.—(1192-1194)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been asked (under *Text* 989)—“Who has attributed the character of the *Non-Cow* to the Cow, that it has to be ‘negatived’ (by the *Apoha*)?” The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1192-1194 above*]

What has been urged would have been true only if the Word had expressed ‘the negation of others’ primarily; as a matter of fact, however, what the Word produces, first of all, is only the Reflected Image of the Thing (spoken of); and it is only after that has been comprehended that, through the force of its implication, the said ‘negation’ (exclusion) becomes comprehended. Apparently this doctrine of ours is not known to the other party, and what he has urged is something insignificant, beneath notice. Such is the upshot of the *Text*. The rest is easy.—(1192-1194)
