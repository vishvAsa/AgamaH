> In the case of the word ‘*evam*’ (thus), there is ‘*naivam*’ (not thus) which is clearly ‘excluded’; in the sense of ‘in another manner’.—(1184)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 981, by *Kumārila*) that—“Nothing *excluded* is noticed in the case of such words as ‘*evam*’ and the like”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1184 above*]

‘It is *thus*—and *not thus*’, in this way there is the idea of ‘another manner’ which is what is ‘excluded’—differentiated—by the word ‘*evam*’, ‘Thus’; and this is clearly apprehended.—So that our theory of Verbal Denotation does not fail to apply to this case also.—(1184.)
