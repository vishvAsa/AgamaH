## Kamalaśīla

It has thus been shown that several words are applied to a thing which, as performing a single function, is *one* only. It is now shown that in some cases, words are applied even on the basis of the diversity of other causes:—[*see verse 1041 above*]

‘*Produced by the large bees*’, as distinguished from that produced by the smaller bees.—(1041)
