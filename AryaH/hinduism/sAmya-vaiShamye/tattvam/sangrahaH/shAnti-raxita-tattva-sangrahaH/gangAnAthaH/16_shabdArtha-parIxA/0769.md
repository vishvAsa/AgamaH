> If it be held that ‘that alone has the capacity to manifest it’—then, even though the subsequent determinate judgment is the same, that alone has the capacity to produce it, and not the horse.—(1059)



## Kamalaśīla

‘*Manifest it*’—i.e. the particular Universal ‘Cow’.

‘*That alone*’,—i.e. the Variegated and other *Cows*, not the *Horse*.

If that be so, then, even when there is diversity, and there is no Commonalty, the variegated and other *Cows* alone,—not the *Horse*—would have the capacity to bring about the determinate judgment; even though this judgment would be the same. This view of ours also would not be incompatible.—(1059)

*Question*:—“What is the upshot of all this?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1060 next*]
