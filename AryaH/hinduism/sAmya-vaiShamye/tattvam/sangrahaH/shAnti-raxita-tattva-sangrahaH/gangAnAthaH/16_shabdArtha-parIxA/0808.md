> For us, no external thing is expressed by the word; nor is any idea of external things held to proceed from words,—by virtue of which, the thing in its entirety having been taken up by these two, any subsequent word would be a mere synonym of that word.—(1118-1119)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“Under the theory of the Buddhist also, when a certain thing has been expressed by a word, there could be no doubtful or wrong cognition in regard to other aspects, and hence why should there not be the incongruity of no other words being used?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1118-1119* above]

‘*These two*’—i.e. the said *word* and the said *Idea*.

‘*Subsequent*’,—coming later on.—(1118-1119)
