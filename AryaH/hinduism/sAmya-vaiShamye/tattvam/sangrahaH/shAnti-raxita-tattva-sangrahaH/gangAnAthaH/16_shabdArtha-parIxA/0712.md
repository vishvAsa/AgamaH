> “As a matter of fact, nothing ‘uncommon’ is ever apprehended; and anything else does not exist for you. where then would be the use of the co-ordination of words, which is not apprehended at all?”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 119]—(971)



## Kamalaśīla

Then again, there may be some sort of subsistence in the case of things like the Blue and the Lotus; but even though present, it could not be expressed by words.—This is shown in the following—[*see verse 971 above*]

No ‘uncommon’ thing in the shape of the Blue Lotus and the like is ever apprehended through words, because all conceptions are absent therein,—as has been declared (by the Apohist).—Under the circumstances when the thing which is the substratum is not known, how can the subsistence of the *Apohas* subsisting therein be cognised? That is, the cognition of the property is concomitant with that wherein the property subsists.

It might be argued that—‘as there is a substratum of these *Apohas* which is entirely different from the *Uncommon Entity*, the said objection is not relevant’.

The answer to this is—‘*Anything else does not exist*—for you’,

It might be urged that—‘even if the co-ordination is not actually cognised, yet it is there all the same, in the actual state of things’.

The answer to this is—‘*Where would be, etc*. *etc*.’—‘*Aikārthyam*’ is *coordination*.

‘*Where would be the me*’—i.e. nowhere at all.—Because even if a thing exists, if it is not cognised (known), it cannot form part of the usage of people.—(971)
