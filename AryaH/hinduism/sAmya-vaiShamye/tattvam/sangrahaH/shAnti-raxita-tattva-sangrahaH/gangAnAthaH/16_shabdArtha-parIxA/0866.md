> The words in question are directly expressive of that (reflection) alone,—because they are dependent upon convention,—like words expressing imaginary things.—(1205)



## Kamalaśīla

[The argument may be formulated thus]—Words that are dependent upon Convention are expressive of only the Reflection of the Conceptual Content produced by the impressions made by objectless (empty) conceptions,—as for instance, words like ‘the son of the Barren Woman’;—the words in question—i.e. words like ‘Jar’ and the like, which form the subject of the present discussion, are dependent upon Convention; and this is a natural reason (for holding that they are expressive only of the Reflection, etc. etc.).—(1205)
