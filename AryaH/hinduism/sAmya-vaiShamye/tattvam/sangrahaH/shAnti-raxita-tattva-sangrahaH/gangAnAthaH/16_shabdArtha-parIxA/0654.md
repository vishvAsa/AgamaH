> As regards ‘intuition’, which has been regarded as the ‘import of words’,—if it appertains to the external object, then, inasmuch as the external object has one particular character, how could there be various ‘intuitions’?—If the ‘intuitions’ be held to be objectless, and existing only in the form of faculties,—then how could there be either comprehension or activity regarding external things?—If it be held that these two (cognition and activity) abandon the external form and rest within themselves,—then the import of words becomes unreal, false—as proceeding through illusion.—Nor can intuition be held to be baseless; as in that case, it should appear everywhere.—If the basis of it be held to consist in the ‘mutual exclusion’ among things,—then that is exactly our view.—(902-905)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author points out the objections against the view that it is ‘Intuition’ that is brought about by words (set forth in *Text* 892):—[*see verses 902-905 above*]

If ‘Intuition’ is really based upon the external object, then it cannot be possible for various Intuitions to appear in persons living at mutually incompatible times, relating to any single thing like Sound; because what is one cannot have several natures.

If Intuitions are devoid of objects, then Activity and Comprehension in connection with objects should not be possible; as the word would have no connection with objects.

If it be held that—“the Comprehension and Activity come about under illusion, the object being imposed upon what is objectless”,—then the Import of Words becomes illusory, mistaken; and of this Illusion, some cause has to be found; otherwise, if there were no cause of the Illusion, it should appear everywhere and at all times.—If the *mutual exclusion* among things be held to be the cause of the illusion, then you support our own view, and as such your argument becomes superfluous.—(902-905)
