> “When one does not admit the denotation of the word to be positive (affirmative) in character, there can be no negation also for him; as this is always preceded by that.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 110]—(966)



## Kamalaśīla

“Then again, you hold the opinion that the Word and the Inferential Indicative,—in both of which *affirmation* forms the subordinate, and *negation* the predominant factor,—are expressive of their objects; and you have also made the following statement—‘When the denotation of another word has not been perceived, the relationship of the Word is easily deduced from the perception of even a part of what is denoted by it; and there can be no fallibility in this’.—All this is not right, under the theory of *Apoha*.”—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 966 above*]

‘*Preceded by that*’,—i.e. preceded by affirmation; that is Negation is only the denial of what has been affirmed.

Further, under the *Apoha-theory*, there is no possibility of the relation of *qualification and qualified* between *Blue and Lotus*, and the co-ordination between them,—which is perceived in actual experience.—(966)
