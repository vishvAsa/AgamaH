> “If the Apohas are different, then they must be entities, because of that difference,—just like the specific individuality of things. If they are non-entities, then they cannot be many, and hence they cannot escape from being synonymous.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 46]—(927)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“If difference is admitted among *Apohas*, then surely they become *entities*—This is shown in the following—[*see verse 927 above*]

‘*Vastu*’—states the Probandum.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—Those that differ among themselves must be entities,—like the Specific Individualities;—*Apohas* differ among themselves;—hence this is a natural Reason (for regarding them as *entities*); and if they are *entities*, then it becomes established that the Import of Words is *positive*.

Tins means that the Proposition of the Apohist is annulled by Inferential Reasoning.

On the other hand, if *Apohas* be held to be *non-entities*, then, there can be no plurality among them; and under the circumstances, it is certain that they are synonymous.—(927)

The following text anticipates the *Bauddha’s* answer to the above:—[*see verse 928 next*]
