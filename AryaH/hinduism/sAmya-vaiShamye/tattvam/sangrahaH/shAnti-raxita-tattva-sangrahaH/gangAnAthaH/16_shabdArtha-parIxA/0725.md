> It has been explained on a previous occasion (text 723) that things like the Harītakī and other things, though distinct from one another, become the basis of unitary conception. on the basis of such things, there appears a reflection in the determinate cognition,—which reflection is definitely apprehended (conceived of) as ‘objects’, even though the objective character is absent in it. [And it is this conception of the reflected image that is called ‘Apoha’].—(1005-1006)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Text* points out the form of Negation (*Paryudāsa*, Exclusion) in the form of *Conception*—[*see verses 1005-1006 above*]

‘*On a previous occasion*’—i.e. in the chapter on the examination of the ‘Universal’, under Text 723 *et seq*. It has been explained there that,—many such things as the *Harītakī* and the rest, without any commonalty among them, perform the same function of allaying fever and other diseases,—and exactly in the same manner the *Black* and other Cows, even though different among themselves, become, by their very nature, the basis of the unitary conception, even without any such entity as the Commonalty or the Universal.

‘*Abhayādisamāḥ*’,—i.e. like the *Harītakī*, etc.—the similarity consisting in fulfilling the same purpose.

‘*On the basis of such things*, *etc. etc*.’;—on the basis of consisting in objects like the *Harītakī* and the rest,—brought about by the apprehension of the action of such causes,—is the *determinate Cognition*;—in this cognition there is the *reflection*,—reflected image—of the objects,—i.e. there appears a reflection which is apprehended as the same as the objects;—and it is to this apprehension that the name ‘*Apoha*’ has been applied.

‘*Determinate*’,—this is an adjective qualifying ‘*cognition*’.

‘*Arthātmatābhāve*’;—even though the character of the ‘external object’ is wanting.

‘*Niścitam*’—definitely apprehended.—(1005-1006)

*Question*:—“Why has the name ‘*Apoha*’ been given to it?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1007-1009 next*]
