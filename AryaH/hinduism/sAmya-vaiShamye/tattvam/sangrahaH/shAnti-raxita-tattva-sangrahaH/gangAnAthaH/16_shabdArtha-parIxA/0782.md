> Discriminators of truth declare that what is denoted by the word is mere ‘reflection’. People, not knowing the distinction between what is ‘perceived’ and what is ‘fancied’ regard it to be something ‘external—as that is what is apprehended (by words), individuals are denoted by words.—In reality however there is nothing that is denoted by words,—as has been proved already.—(1078-1079)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued above (under *Text* 955, by *Kumārila*) that—“when Individuals, not being denoted, cannot be ‘excluded’, then what would be ‘excluded’ would he the Universal”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1078-1079 above*]

The reason ‘because Individuals are not denoted’ is *not-admitted*. Because the ‘non-denotability’ of words that we have asserted is only in view of the real aspect of things, not in regard to the illusory aspect. Under the illusory aspect, it is only Individuals that are denoted,—as is happily accepted by people wanting in true insight, and is well known; so that the Reason adduced is *not-admitted*.

What is ‘*perceived*’ is the *external* thing, in the shape of Specific Individuality;—what is ‘*fancied*’,—imaginary—is the ‘Reflection’ that figures in Determinate Conception.

If the Reason adduced by you is the *real* ‘non-denotability of Individuals’,—then we also do not admit of any *real* ‘exclusion’ of Individuals; so that in that ease your argument proves only what is already admitted by us, and is, as such, superfluous, futile.—This is what is shown by the sentence—‘*In reality*, *etc. etc*.’.—(1078-1079)
