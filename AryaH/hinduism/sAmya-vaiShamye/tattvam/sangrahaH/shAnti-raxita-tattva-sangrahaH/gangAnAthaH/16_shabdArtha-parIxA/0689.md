> It is only a well-established entity in the shape of the non-cow that could be excluded by the Apoha (denoted by the word ‘cow’);—and the non-cow is of the nature of the negation of the cow;—hence it has to be explained what this cow is which is negatived (in the non-cow).—If this cow is of the nature of the negation of the non-cow, then there is mutual interdependence.—If the cow is admitted as an entity for the sake of the Apoha, then the postulating of the Apoha becomes futile.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 83-84]—(943-944)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *text* shows that no Convention could be made regarding the *Apoha*, as it would involve mutual interdependence:—[*see verses 943-944 above*]

The *Cow* is apprehended through the ‘exclusion of the *non-Cow*’;—the ‘non-Cow’ is of the nature of the *negation of the Cow*;—hence the second term in the word ‘non-Cow’ has got to be explained, which is negatived by the negative particle in the word ‘non-Cow’; there can be no negation of anything, the exact nature of which is not known.

It might he argued that—‘what is it that has to be explained? It is already known that the *Cow* is of the nature of the *negation of the non-Cow*.’

The answer to that is—‘*If this Cow, etc. etc*.’;—‘*this*’ stands for the *Cow*. Thus then, the *Cow* being of the nature of the *negation of the non-Cow*, it could be apprehended only through the apprehension of the *non-Cow*;—and the *non-Cow* being of the nature of the *negation of the Cow*, it could be apprehended only through the apprehension of the *Cow*;—thus this would be a clear case of mutual interdependence.

It might be argued that—‘The *Cow* that is negatived by the word *non-cow* is a well-established positive entity, for the sake of *Apoha*,—i.e. for the fulfilment of the *Apoha* in the shape of *the exclusion of the non-cow*,—so that there would be no interdependence.

The answer to this is—‘*If the cow is an established entity, etc. etc*.’;—That is, if that be so, then it is useless to assume that *Apoha* forms the denotation of all words; inasmuch as you admit the import of words to consist of a positive entity. Consequently (to be consistent) you should not admit of any positive entity to be denoted by a word; and if you do not admit it, then the objectionable ‘interdependence’ becomes inevitable.—(943-944)
