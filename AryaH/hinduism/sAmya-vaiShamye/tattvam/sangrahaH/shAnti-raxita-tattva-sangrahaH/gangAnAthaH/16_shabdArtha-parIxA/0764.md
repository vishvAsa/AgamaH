> The ‘specific individuality’ consists of the thing-by-itself, as ‘excluded from what is not itself’;—an assertion of concomitance carefully made in this form would not be incongruous.—(1052)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under Text 934, by *Kumārila*) that—“Words and Inferential Indicatives do not apply to what is devoid of concomitance, etc, etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1052 above*]

Even though there is no entity in the shape of the Commonalty (Universal), yet, if an assertion of concomitance is made in regard to mere ‘Specific Individuality’ as excluded (differentiated) from unlike things,—that would not be incompatible (with our view).—(1052)

*Question*:—“Why so?”

*Answer*:—[*see verses 1053-1054 next*]
