> All these are wrong views based upon ignorance of what is meant by the ‘apoha, negation, of other things’.—People who are themselves damned damn others also.—As a matter of fact, Apoha is of two kinds due to difference between—(1) Paryudāsa (relative negation, contradistinction, exclusion) and (2) *niṣedha* (absolute negation, denial, prohibition). Paryudāsa again is of two kinds—(*a*) due to difference of conception (idea), and (*b*) due to difference of concept (object).—(1003-1004)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus set forth the opinions of others, in order of importance, the Author sets forth the answer to these:—[*see verses 1003-1004 above*]

‘*Due to difference, etc. etc*.’;—i.e. because there is Relative Negation and Absolute Negation, there are two kinds of *Apoha*, Negation.

‘*Due to difference in Conception, etc. etc*.’—i.e. due to difference of the nature of the Conception, and due to difference of the nature of the Concept. Of these ‘*the nature of Conception*’ consists in the appearance of cognition of several things in one comprehensive form;—and ‘*the nature of Concept*’—consists in the nature of the object, as contradistinguished from unlike objects,—i.e. in the form of ‘Specific Individuality’; and the two kinds of *Paryudāsa* are based upon difference of these two;—such is the sense of the compound.—(1003-1004)
