> The ideas of ‘one-ness’, ‘eternality’ and the like are purely imaginary, not real. hence your laughter at us on this point is indicative of a very high grade of learning (on your part)!—(1200)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been urged (under *Text* 1001) that—“Singularity, eternality, etc. cannot be attributed to *Apoha*”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1200 above*]

if ‘one-ness’ and the rest had been mentioned by us. as *real*, then there might have been some cause for your laughing at us. As a matter of fact, however, it has been mentioned by our Teacher only as something purely imaginary (subjective, conceptual),—and he has mentioned it only in view of common misconceived notions. Under the circumstances, how can a learned person find any cause for laughter in this? On the contrary, you yourself, by criticising what you have not understood, have become an object of derisive laughter.—(1200)
