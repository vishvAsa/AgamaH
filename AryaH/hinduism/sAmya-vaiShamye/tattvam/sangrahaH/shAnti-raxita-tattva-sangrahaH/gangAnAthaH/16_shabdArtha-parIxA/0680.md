> “Of the word and the indicative, no operation is possible without concomitance;—and without these (word and the indicative), there can be no Apoha;—and there can be no concomitance for what is ‘uncommon’ (unique, specific).”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 73]—(934)



## Kamalaśīla

Further, it is held by you that the *Apoha* is indicated by the Word and by the Inferential Indicative; now both these, Word and Indicative, cannot be operative in the absence of a positive ‘Universal’; hence (for you) how is the *Apoha* indicated?”

This argument is set forth in the following—[*see verse 934 above*]

‘*Anvayavinirmuktā*’—i.e. without co-ordination.

‘*These*’—i.e. the Word and the Indicative.—Without these, the *Apoha* ‘*cannot be apprehended*’,—this has to be taken as understood.

It might be said that—“the Word and the Indicative may operate on the basis of concomitance with the Specific Individuality”.

The answer to this is that ‘*there can be, etc. etc*.’, That is, the Specific Individuality is something *uncommon*, not partaking of anything else; how can there be any concomitance with it?—Thus Word and Indicative can have no bearing on the assumption of ‘*Apoha*’.—(934)
