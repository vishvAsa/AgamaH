> For the man by whom the denotation of words is not admitted to be anything positive, the mind (cognition) reflecting the thing is what is brought about by the word, and this cognition ultimately brings about the idea of the thing. When words express their meanings, there is, by implication, the exclusion of other things; and through the presence of this there is negation also, as preceded by the apprehension of the positive thing.—



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 966, by *Kumārila*) that—“one for whom there is nothing positive denoted by words,—for him there can be no negation either”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1095-1096 above*]

It is not that we absolutely do not admit the fact of words denoting positive things;—by virtue of which you have urged the undesirable contingency against us. As a matter of fact, it is admitted by us that the word produces the ‘mental condition’ (Cognition) which ultimately provides the idea of the Thing; so that in our opinion also what is denoted by the word is a positive entity which is illusory in character. In reality however, there is nothing that is denoted by words; hence it is only the *real* positive character of things that is denied by us;—so that the *illusory* positive character of theng denoted by words being accepted by us,—whenever there is anything positive denoted by the word,—the *negation* of other things becomes apprehended by implication; and hence it is quite possible to have this negation as preceded by the apprehension of the positive thing.—(1095-1096)
