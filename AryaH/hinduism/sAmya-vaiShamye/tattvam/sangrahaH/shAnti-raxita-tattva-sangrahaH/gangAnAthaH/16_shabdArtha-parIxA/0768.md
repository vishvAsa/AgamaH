> The difference from the variegated cow being equally present in the black cow and the horse, why is it that the universal ‘cow’, as differentiated from the horse, subsists in that?—(1058)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued above (under *Text*, 938, by *Kumārila*) that—“The difference from the *Variegated Cow* is equally present in the *Black Cow* and in the *Horse*, etc. etc”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1058 above*]

It behoves you to say—when the *Horse* is equally different from the *Variegated* *Cow* and the *Black* *Cow*,—how it is that the Universal ‘Cow’, as differentiated from the *Horse*, subsists in the Variegated and other *Cows*, and not in the *Horse*?—(1058)

The reply to this may be as follows:—“What is there to be said here? It is clear that it is only the Variegated and other *Cows*—and not the *Horse*—that are capable of manifesting the Universal ‘Cow’; hence the said Universal subsists in the *Cows*, not in other things. Nor will it be right to urge the question—‘why the Variegated and other *Cows* alone have the capacity to manifest the said Universal’, Because such restriction is due to the very nature of things; and there can be no complaint against the nature of things; as all such restrictions are due to the series of causes that have brought about thengs.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1059 next*]
