> “If the qualified thing is cognisable in the form of negation, then it cannot be an entity; consequently for you, there can be no entity that could be denoted by words as qualified by Apoha.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 91]—(951)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that—‘the *Apoha* does colour the Qualified Entity with its own Cognition (Idea)’.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 951 above*]

‘*Negation*’—i.e. the *Apoha*;—‘*cognisable in the form*’—i.e. cognised as being of the same form as;—if the *Qualified thing* has its character such that it is cognisable in the form of negation;—i.e. if the thing is cognised in the form of Negation,—then it ceases to be a positive *Entity*; as the ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ are contradictory terms.

The argument is summed up in the words—‘*Consequently, for you, etc*. *etc*.’.—(951)
