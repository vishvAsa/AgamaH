> “The qualification cannot bring about a cognition which is like something totally different; for how can that be said to be the qualification in a cognition which is like something different?”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 89]—(949)



## Kamalaśīla

“Granting that there is cognition of the *Apoha*,—even so, inasmuch as there can be no cognition of that form in regard to anyng, it could not rightly serve as its qualification—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 949 above*]

Every qualification is found to bring about in regard to the qualified thing a cognition in keeping with its own form; and one kind of qualification does not bring about a cognition like something else; e.g. the *Blue* does not produce in regard to the *Lotus* the cognition of *Red*; nor does the *stick* bring about in regard to the *Stick-holder*, the idea of his *wearing ear-rings*.—In the case in question also, the verbal cognition that appears in connection with the *Horse*„ *etc*. is not coloured by *negative* character; on the other hand, it partakes of the *positive* character.

It might be argued that—“Even when bringing about a cognition unlike itself, a qualification can be so called.”

The answer to that is—‘*How can, etc. etc*.’—‘*Like something different*’,—i.e. unlike the qualification itself.—(948)

*Question*:—“What would be the harm if it did?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 950 next*]
