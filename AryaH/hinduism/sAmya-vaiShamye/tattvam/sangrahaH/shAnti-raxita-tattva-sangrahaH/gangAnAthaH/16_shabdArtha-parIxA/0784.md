> Negation is not ‘excluded’ (denied) in the words ‘negation is not negation’; it is however clearly ‘excluded’ (denied) in such expressions as ‘the entity is not of the nature of negation’.—(1081)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued (under *Text* 956, by *Kumārila*) that—“Negation cannot be subject to *exclusion*, etc. etc”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1081 above*]

Negation is not ‘excluded’ in the words ‘Negation is not Negation’,—by virtue of which it would abandon its negative character (as urged by *Kumārila*). But, what is an *Entity* has the *positive* character, and as such remains distinct from the *Negative*; hence by implication, the Negation becomes subject to ‘Exclusion’; this is what is meant by us.—(1081)

This same idea is further clarified in the following—[*see verse 1082 next*]
