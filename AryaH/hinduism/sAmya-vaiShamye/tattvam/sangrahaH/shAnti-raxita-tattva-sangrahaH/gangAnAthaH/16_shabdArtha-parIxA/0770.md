## Kamalaśīla

*In whatever thing*—Variegated Cow, etc.—the said determinate judgment is present—in the form ‘this is a *Cow*’, ‘that is a *Cow*’,—to that,—even in the absence of the Universal '‘Cow’, as a positive entity,—the ‘exclusion of the *non-Cow*’,—in the form of the *Reflection*—becomes applied.—(1060)
