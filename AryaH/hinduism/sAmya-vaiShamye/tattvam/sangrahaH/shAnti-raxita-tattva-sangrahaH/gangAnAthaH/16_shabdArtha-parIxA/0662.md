> “When one hears the word ‘cow’ uttered, he should, first of all have the idea of the non-cow,—as the word ‘cow’ would have been uttered for the purpose of negativing the ‘non-cow’.”—(914)



## Kamalaśīla

In the following *Text*, *Bhāmaha* puts forward his comprehensive argument (against *Apoha*):—[*see verse 914 above*]

“If it is the *negation of the non-cow* that is mainly expressed by the word ‘Cow’, then, on hearing the word ‘Cow’, the first idea in the mind of the hearer would be that of the ‘non-cow’; because that is held to be the ‘import’ of the word the notion regarding which appears *directly and immediately* after the word; the notion of the ‘negation of the non-cow does not appear *directly and immediately* after the word ‘Cow—Thus, on account of the incongruity of there being no notion of the *Cow*, and on account of the incongruity of the first appearance of the notion of the *non*-*cow*, ‘*Apoha*’ (Negation of others) cannot form the Import of Words.”—(914)
