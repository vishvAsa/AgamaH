> When the cognition of the reflection in that form has resulted from the word, there has come about the relation of denoted and denotative, in the shape of cause and effect.—(1012)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As regards the well-known relation of the *denotative and denoted* which subsists between the word and its denotation,—it is none other than the relation of *Cause and Effect*; in fact it is of the nature of the relation of *Cause and Effect* itself.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1012 above*]

‘*The Reflection in that form*’—is that reflection which is of the nature of the apprehended external object;—when the birth—appearance—of the cognition of that—has been brought about—produced,—the relation that has resulted is, on reflection, found to be that of *Cause and Effect*. For instance, the Word, as bringing about the Reflection, is called ‘denotative’; and the Reflection, brought about by the Word, is the ‘denoted

Thus the assertion made by the Opponent—that ‘mere negation does not figure in Verbal Cognition’ (Text, 910)—is irrelevant; because mere negation is not regarded as the denotation of words.—(1012)
