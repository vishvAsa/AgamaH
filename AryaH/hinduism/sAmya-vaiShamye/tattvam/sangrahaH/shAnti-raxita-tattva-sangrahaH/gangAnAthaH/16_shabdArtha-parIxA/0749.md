## Kamalaśīla

Even without there being any Commonalty (or Universal), there is restriction regarding the application of a common word to a number of things,—and the basis of such application lies in the fact of several things performing the same fruitful function. By their very nature, some things, even though many, perform the same fruitful function; and for the purpose of expressing the fact of their performing the same fruitful function, people speaking of them,—for the sake of brevity—impose upon them a common form, and apply to them a common name. For instance, when the various things—Colour, etc.—are found to perform the same function of containing Honey, Water and other things,—the name ‘Jar’ is applied to them.—(1034)
