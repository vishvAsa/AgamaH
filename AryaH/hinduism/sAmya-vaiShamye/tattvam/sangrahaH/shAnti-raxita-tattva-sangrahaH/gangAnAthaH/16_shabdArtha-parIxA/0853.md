## Kamalaśīla

In this way the criticisms urged by *Kumārila* have been answered. The Author now proceeds to answer those urged by *Uddyotakara*.

It has been argued (under *Text* 982, by *Uddyotakara*)—“What is it that is assumed to be *excluded* in the case of the word ‘*sarva*’, ‘all’?”

Here also, as in the case of words like ‘knowable’, the word ‘all’ is never used alone by itself; it is always used in a sentence; hence what is ‘excluded’ by it would be just that in regard to which there may be doubt in the mind of dull-witted persons.
