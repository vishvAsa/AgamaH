> All things cannot be desired; as, in that case, there would be no restriction regarding any denotations. Hence in the case of words like ‘cooks’ and the like, there is clearly ‘something excluded’.—(1145)



## Kamalaśīla

It might be argued that “all things are *desired*—The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1145 above*]

If all things were ‘desired’ (to be expressed), then there could be no restriction regarding the denotation of words; in that case, it would not be possible for the hearer to undertake any activity that might be called for on the hearing of the word; consequently it cannot be right that all things are desired (to be expressed).

From all this it follows that in the ease of words like ‘cooks’ (Verbs) there is ‘exclusion of the undesired’, by implication; and it is quite clearly apprehended.—(1145)
