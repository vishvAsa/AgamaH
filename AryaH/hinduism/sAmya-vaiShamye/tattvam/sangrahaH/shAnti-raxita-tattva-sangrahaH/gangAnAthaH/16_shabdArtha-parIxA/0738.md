> Because it is cognised as a positive ‘entity’, therefore it is called a ‘positive entity’;—this mistaken cognition is produced quickly from its seed.—(1023)



## Kamalaśīla

As regards its *externality*, that also is spoken of as such only by persons under illusion; it is not real.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1023 above*]

*Objection*:—“If in any case, there were a positive entity in the shape of the Commonalty based upon an external object actually apprehended, then it might be possible to have an illusion of the Commonalty based upon similarity; when however, there is no real primary ‘Commonalty’ (according to the Buddhist), the said illusion of commonalty is not possible for you.”

*Answer*:—‘*This mistaken cognition*, *etc. etc*.’—‘*Quality*’;—i.e. the cognition in question appears, independently of the perception of any real Commonalty,—through some internal aberration,—like the conception of ‘two moons’; all illusions do not really proceed from the perception of similarity; they appear through mental aberration also. Hence there is no incongruity in our view.—(1023)
