> That (universal) which subsists in the many individual trees is the same that subsists in the single individual (tree),—the basis thereof being the same in both oases; consequently, the idea of ‘*vana*’ (forest) should be there in connection with the single tree also.—(1140)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been asserted (in *Text* 1136, by *Kumarila*) that “the word ‘*vana*’ may be taken as denoting the Universal subsisting in the many individual trees)”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1140 above*]

Under the said view also, a single Tree could be spoken of as ‘*Vana*’, Because what the word ‘*vana*’ denotes is the Universal as subsisting in the many Individuals; and that same Universal subsists in the single Individual tree, *Dhava* also; thus the basis of the notion of ‘*vana*’ being the same in all cases, why should the notion of ‘*vana*’ not appear in connection with the single tree also?—(1140)
