## Kamalaśīla

Then again, this *Apoha* that you have postulated as the Import of Words,—has been held to be denoted by the word as taken out of a Sentence; but what is expressed by the Sentence must be of the nature of *Intuition*; as has been declared in the following—“Hitherto has been discussed the denotation of the Word as taken out of a Sentence; but what is brought about first of all is what is expressed by the Sentence, which has been called *Intuition*”.—In this connection we have the following *Text*:—[*see verse 923 above*]

Just as, even in the absence of an external object denoted by the Word,—you describe the meaning of the Sentence to be of the nature of *Intuition*, hot of the nature of ‘*Apoha*’,—even so, the meaning of the word,—like the meaning of the Sentence,—also may be of the nature of Intuition. Under the circumstances, why is any such thing as ‘*Apoha*’ postulated at all? That is to say, the Import of both Sentence and Word may be of the positive character.—(923)
