> Even in cases where the thing itself is apprehended, the ‘exclusion of other things’ is also apprehended,—as is indicated by the force of the emphasising term (used by you); if it were not, then, the emphasising would be useless.—(1201)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been asserted (under *Text* 1002, by *Kumārila*) that—“for these reasons, the element of the *negation of others* could be there only in the case of words that are associated with the negative particle, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1201 above*]

The factor of the ‘exclusion of other things’ is cognised, not only in cases where the negative term is present; also where the negative term is not present, the same is cognised. This has been made clear by yourself when you said that ‘the Thing *itself* is apprehended’, where you have emphasised the ‘itself’. If this is not what you mean, then that emphasising word is useless. Thus when it is said that ‘the thing *itself* is cognised’, it is all the more clearly implied that the ‘exclusion of others’ is also cognised.—(1201)
