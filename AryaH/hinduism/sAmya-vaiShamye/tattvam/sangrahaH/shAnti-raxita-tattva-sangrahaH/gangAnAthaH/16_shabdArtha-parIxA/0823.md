> If it be so, then even a single tree could be spoken of as ‘*vana*’ (forest); several trees also are spoken of as such only through connection, and that is present in the single tree also.—(1139)



## Kamalaśīla

If the application of the word ‘*vana*’ to Individual Trees, *Dhava* and the rest, be due only to the presence of the *connection of the Connected*, or of *Connection* itself, then even a single tree could be spoken of as ‘*Vana*’; as the basis of the application would be present there. For instance, even the several trees—*Dhava* and the rest—are spoken of as ‘*Vana*’, only through the connection of the Number of the Universal,—and not through anything else; and this connection is present in the single Tree also;—why then should this also not be spoken of as ‘*vana*’?—(1139)
