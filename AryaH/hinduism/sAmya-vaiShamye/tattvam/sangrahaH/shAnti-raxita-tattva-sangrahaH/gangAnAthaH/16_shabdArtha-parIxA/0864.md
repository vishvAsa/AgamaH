> As non-entities have no form, words appertaining to those cannot be even suspected of being denotative of the universal and such things. in fact, it has been fully established that they are only indicators of the reflection.—(1203)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Such non-entities as the ‘son of the Barren Woman’ have no form,—no character;—hence words relating to those cannot even be suspected of being denotative of the *Universal*, etc. It is only in the case of words relating to entities that there could be any question as to whether what is denoted by them is some *form* or only a Redaction. As regards non-entities (or Negations) they are entirely different from Entities, hence how could words applied to them be even suspected of pertaining to entities? From this it is clear that the words in question have no object (denotation at all); all that they produce is the mere Reflection of things; and this Reflection is what is actually apprehended. Thus there is no room for the objection that has been urged.

The same is further explained:—[*see verse 1204 next*]
