## Kamalaśīla

Thus, just as the word ‘lotus’ would be useless, so also the use of such words as ‘non-eternal’ would be useless; or if they were used, they would be only synonyms,—like the words ‘*taru*’ and ‘*pādapa*’ (both of which stand for *tree*).—This is the application of the said reasoning to other cases indicated in the following—[*see verse 1117* above]

‘*Udīraṇam*’—i.e. úse, utterance.

‘*Uktau*’—i.e. in the uttering.

This idea has been expressed in the following statement:—‘A certain thing having been entirely taken up by a word—or by an idea,—there remains nothing else that could be expressed by another word or Idea; hence these would be synonyms’.—(1117)
