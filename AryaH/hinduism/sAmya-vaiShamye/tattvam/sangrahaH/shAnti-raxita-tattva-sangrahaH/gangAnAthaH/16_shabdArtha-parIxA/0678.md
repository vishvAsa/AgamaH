> “As a matter of fact, no one can conceive of the cow and other things—any similarity of form among whom is not admitted,—to be the substratum of Apoha.”—(932)



## Kamalaśīla

“Further, it may be granted that diversity is due to diversity in relatives; even so, as you do not admit of the ‘Universal’ as an entity, it is not possible for your *Apoha* to have the relative, in the shape of its substratum; the diversity of which could account for the diversity in the *Apoha*”,—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 932 above*]

If a real similarity among *Cows* were admitted, then they could be accepted as the substratum of the *Apoha*, of Horse and other things, on the basis of that common similarity;—not otherwise; hence one who desires to have these Cows as the substratum of *Apoha*, must admit of the *similarity*; and in that case, that *similarity* as the ‘Universal’ would form the Import of the Word, and there would be no use for the assuming of *Apoha*.

The term ‘*Viṣaya*’ in this Text, stands for *substratum* or *receptacle*; just as in such expressions as ‘*Jalaviṣayā matsyāḥ*—(932)
