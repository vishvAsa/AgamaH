> The idea of ‘heat’ that follows on the utterance of the name (‘hot’) is not so clear and distinct as the perception of the (hot) thing brought about by the sense-organ.—(879)



## Kamalaśīla

The Author next states another proof in support of the view that Specific Individuality cannot be denoted by words:—[*see verse 879 above*]

The cognition of the Hot thing brought about by the Senses is clear and distinct,—not so the cognition that is brought about by the word ‘hot’; people whose Visual, Gestatory and Olfactory organs have been impaired do not cognise the Colour and Taste, etc. of things on the hearing of the mere name—‘mātuliṅga’ (Citron), for instance; while people whose eyes are intact have a clear perception of those through that sense-organ. This has been thus declared—‘The man who has been burnt by fire has the idea of having been burnt, on the contact of fire,—which idea is entirely different from the idea of burning arising on the utterance of the word burn

The perception of the thing, etc. etc.—is an Instance per dissimilarity.—(879)
