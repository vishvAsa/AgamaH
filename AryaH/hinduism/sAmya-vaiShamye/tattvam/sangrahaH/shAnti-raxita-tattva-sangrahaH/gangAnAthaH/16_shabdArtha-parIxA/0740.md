## Kamalaśīla

In reality, the *Apoha* is not anything entirely different from the Cognition; how then could it appertain to another thing,—by virtue of which appertenence, it could be the ‘commonalty’ of several things? It has been declared above—‘How can what is non-different from the Cognition appertain to another thing?’

For this same reason, our reasoning is not open to the charge of being ‘redundant’ (seeking to prove what is already admitted); because you do not admit the Universal named ‘Cow’ to be of the form of Cognition and not of the form of an entity; on the other hand, you postulate the Universal ‘Cow’ as a real entity embracing all cows—variegated and the rest. Hence our reasoning is not ‘redundant’,

It has been urged (under 919) that—“If mere negation be assumed to be the denotation of words, this would be only the *void* expressed differently”. As no such assumption is made by us, it does not affect our position.—(1025)
