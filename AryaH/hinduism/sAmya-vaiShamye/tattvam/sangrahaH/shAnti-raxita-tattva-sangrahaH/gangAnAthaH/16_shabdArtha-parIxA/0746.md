> ‘Non-difference’ consists in being of the same form; how can this be there in what are formless? Words become synonyms only when what is denoted by them is one and the same.—(1031)

*Question*:—“If there is no *one form* in *formless* things, why should words not be synonymous?”

*Answer*:—‘*Words become synonyms, etc. etc*.’—(1031)
