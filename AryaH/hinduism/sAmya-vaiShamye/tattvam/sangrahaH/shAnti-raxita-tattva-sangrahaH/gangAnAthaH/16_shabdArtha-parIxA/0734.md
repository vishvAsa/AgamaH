> It is only when the reflection has been cognised that there follows the ‘exclusion of other things’, by implication; because the idea of ‘others’ does not form part of the reflection at all.—(1019)



## Kamalaśīla

Having thus explained the nature of *Apoha*, the Author now proceeds to meet and set aside the objections urged by others.

It has been urged (by *Bhāmaha*, under Text 912) that—“if the word ‘Cow’ serves the only purpose of excluding other things, then please point out some other word which would produce the notion of *Cow* in the Cow.”

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 1019 above*]

It is the idea of the *Cow* itself which is produced by the word; as regards the ‘exclusion of others’, that is understood only by implication,—and from the word itself; because the Reflection of the Cow is free from the touch of any other appearance (or reflection). If it were not so, then, it would never be apprehended in its specific form. That is why, for the bringing about of the idea of the Cow, another word is not sought after; because the said idea of the Cow is produced by the word ‘Cow’ itself.—(1019)
