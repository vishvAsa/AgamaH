> As for the connection of gender and number, it is not present in individuals also; in fact, such connection is based entirely upon conventions set up by the whims of people; it is nothing real.—(1122)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under *Text* 973, by *Kumārila*) that—“there can be no connection between the *Apoha* and Gender, Number, etc”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1122* above]

The fact of Gender, Number, etc. belonging to things is not admitted. In fact it is due entirely to Conventions set up at whim.

‘*In Individuals also*’—the term ‘also’ is meant to include the *Apoha*.

The argument may be formulated thus:—When one thing does not follow the presence and absence of another thing, then it cannot belong to it;—e.g. Coolness and Fire;—Gender and Number do not follow the presence and absence of individual things,—hence there is non-perception of the wider term (which implies the non-existence of the narrower).—(1122)
