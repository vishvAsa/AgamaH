> “This Apoha, ‘exclusion of other things’—is it itself denoted or not-denoted? Even if it is denoted, is it denoted as something positive? Or only as the ‘negation of other things’?—If it is denoted as something positive, then you should abandon your extremist view, whereby it has been asserted that ‘in every case it is the exclusion of other things that is denoted by words.’—If, on the other hand, the said ‘exclusion’ (Apoha) is denoted in the form of the ‘exclusion of other things’,—then such a view would involve an infinite regress.—If then it be held by you that the said Apoha (exclusion of other things) is not denoted, then your assertion, that ‘the word always brings about the exclusion of other things’, would become annulled.”—(997-1000)



## Kamalaśīla

“You have to be questioned—is this *Apoha* denoted or not denoted? If it is denoted, is it denoted as something positive? Or as the ‘exclusion of other things’?—If it is denoted as something positive, then the assertion that ‘The denotation of words consists in the *exclusion of other things*’ is not universally true.—If it is denoted as the ‘exclusion of other things’, then that ‘exclusion of others’ would itself have to be denoted as another ‘exclusion of other things’; and so on and on, there would be no end to it.—If then the *Apoha* is held to be *not-denoted*, then that would contradict the statement that ‘the word brings about the exclusion of what is denoted by other words’.”—(997-1000)

All this has been set forth by *Uddyotakara*. In answer to this, the revered *Diṅnāga* has declared as follows:—“In all cases, the substratum being the same, there is no disruption, and all that is desired is duly accomplished; hence in due course, all characteristics of the ‘Universal’,—such as *one-ness*, *eternality, complete subsistence in every component*—subsist in the *Apoha* itself. Consequently, on account of the superiority of its excellence, the only theory that is right is that ‘the denotation of words consists in the *exclusion of other things*’.”

In reference to this, *Kumārila* argues as follows, thereby summing up the arguments against the doctrine of *Apoha*:—[*see verses 1001-1002*]
