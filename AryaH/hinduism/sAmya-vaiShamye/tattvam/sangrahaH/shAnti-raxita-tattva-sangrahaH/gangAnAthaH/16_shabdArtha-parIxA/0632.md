> Even in the Himālaya and such things which do not differ with time and place,—there are atoms which are diverse and momentary, as proved above.—(875)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“There are certain things, like the *Himālaya* Mountain, which remain permanently in one and the same form,—so that there can be no diversity in them due to Place, Time and Distinction;—consequently, as they would be present at the time of Convention and Usage,—your Reason becomes partially ‘inadmissible’.”

The answer to this argument is as follows:—[*see verse 875 above*]

‘*And such things*’—is meant to include other mountains like the *Malaya*.

All these are aggregates of many Atoms; hence there can be no Convention relating to all their component parts; also because it has been proved that all these things are destroyed immediately after their appearance. Thus, in the case of these things also, there can be no presence, at the time of usage, of the character that was present at the time of the making of the Convention. Hence our Reason is not ‘unproven’,—(875)
