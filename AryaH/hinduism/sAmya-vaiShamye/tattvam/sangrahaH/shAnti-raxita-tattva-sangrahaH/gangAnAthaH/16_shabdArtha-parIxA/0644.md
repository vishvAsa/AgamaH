Text 886 has spoken of ‘denotation of the verb *to be* and the like’; the term ‘and the like’ is a reference to certain other theories that have been propounded regarding the ‘Import of Words These theories are now set forth (under Texts 888 to 892):—[*see verse 888 above*]

(*a*) Some people assert that what the word—‘*brāhmaṇa*’ for instance—denotes is the aggregate of austerity, caste, learning, etc. without any conceptual determination either collective or distributive; just as the word ‘forest’ denotes the *Dhava* and other trees. That is to say, when the word ‘forest’ is uttered, the notion that appears is not a determinate or well-defined, one,—either of the *Dhava or* the *Khadira or* the *Palāśa or* any particular tree (distributively),—or of the *Dhava and* the *Khadira* and the *Palāśa* and other trees (collectively);—it is only a vague indefinite conception of the *Dhava* and other trees in general;—similarly when the word ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ is uttered, the notion that appears is not a well-defined one—either of Austerity *or* Caste *or* Learning, (distributively), or Austerity and Caste *and* Learning (collectively); what are cognised are Austerity and the rest conceived of as one aggregated whole as differentiated from other correlatives.—The term ‘*vikalpa*’ (in the Text) stands for the distinct conception of any one individual from among a group consisting of an indefinite number of individuals; and ‘*Samuchaya*’ stands for the distinct conception of a definite number of individuals related together;—and the notion brought about by words is free from both these conceptions.

(*b*) Others however have held that what is denoted by the word is the relation of a thing—substance, f.i.—to an undefined ‘Universal’—‘Substance’, f.i.;—and this is said to be ‘unreal’ because the individual correlatives are not really denoted by the word.—Or, it may be that, like the dark complexion and other properties, *Austerity*, *Caste*, etc. also appear in the notion as a single unity,—and hence it is the relationship of these that is called ‘unreal’. Because these are not really apprehended together in their own forms; what is apprehended is only the aggregate of these perceived like the whirling fire-brand, without reference to the individuals making lip the aggregate.—(888)
