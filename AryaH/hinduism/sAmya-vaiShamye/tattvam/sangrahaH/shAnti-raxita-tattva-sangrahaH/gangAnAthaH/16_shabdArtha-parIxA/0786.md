## Kamalaśīla

The author is going to cite an example which is accepted by both parties, and through that, is going to make it clear how the Reason of the Opponent is ‘Inconclusive’:—[*see verse 1083 above*]

You, *Mīmāṃsakas*, also do not admit the fact of Things having been created by Primordial Matter, or God, or Time and other Causes; but the negation (denial) of this fact does not make it a positive entity;—in the same manner, even though there is *Apoha* (negation, denial) of Negation, yet that does not make the Negation a positive entity. Consequently, the Reason adduced by you is *Inconclusive*,—(1083)
