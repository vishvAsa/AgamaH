> Thus then, the notion of ‘being accomplished’, as also the conception of the ‘past’ etc.,—being of the same form as positive entities—comes to be based upon that same.—(1152)



## Kamalaśīla

The answer to the above argument of the opponent is that, if it is as just explained, then you yourself have shown the basis of the notion of ‘being accomplished’ and of that of ‘past’ and so forth, and consequently you should not say that all this becomes baseless.

This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1152 above*]

‘*Based upon that same*’,—i.e. based upon the apprehension of the fact that they are of the same character as Positive entities.—(1152)
