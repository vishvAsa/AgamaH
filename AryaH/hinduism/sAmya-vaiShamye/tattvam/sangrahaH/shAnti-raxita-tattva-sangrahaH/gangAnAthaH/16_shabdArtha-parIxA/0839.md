> When the meaning of the sentence—‘*caitra*, bring the cow’,—has been comprehended, what is understood, by implication, is the Apoha (exclusion) of other agents, other objects and so forth (than those expressed by the words of the sentence).—(1162)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

This same idea is made clearer by means of an Example:—[*see verse 1162 above*]

In the case of the said sentence, nothing else comes into the mind except what is expressed by the words—‘*Caitra*’ etc.—composing it; and when *Caitra* has been comprehended, *the exclusion of non-caitra* also becomes comprehended through implication. Otherwise,—if the *exclusion of other Agents*, etc. were not meant, then the mention of *Caitra*, etc. would be meaningless; and hence no such sentence could be addressed by any person to any one; and there would be an end to all usage in the world.—(1162)
