> “In that case, all things, with the sole exception of the single individual cow, would become excluded by the Apoha; and in that case it would not be proved that any commonalty constitutes the import of words.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 82]—(942)



## Kamalaśīla

If it is your opinion that the word ‘Cow’ cannot apply to anything except the one that was perceived at the time of the apprehension of the *Convention*,—then, with the exception of the one *Spotted Cow* which has been the object of the Convention, every thing else,—even the *Black* and other Cows,—would have to be excluded by the word ‘Cow’; and in that case, it could not be established that any *Commonalty* is denoted by the Word.—(942)
