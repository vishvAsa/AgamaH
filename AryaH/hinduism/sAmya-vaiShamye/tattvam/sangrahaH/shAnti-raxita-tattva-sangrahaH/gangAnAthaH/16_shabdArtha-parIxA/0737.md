## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (by *Kumārila*, under *Text* 915, above) that—“Those who have accepted the commonalty in the shape of the *negation of the noncow* as denoted by the word, have admitted the positive entity, the *Universal* ‘Cow’ to be so denoted”.

This is answered in the following—[*see verse 1022 above*]

‘*Of the same kind*’,—that is, superimposed upon, reflected in, the Cognition, as something external.
