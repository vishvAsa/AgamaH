> “In that case, even the non-existent (non-being) would have a positive character; which would be a great calamity.—And when there is no negation, there would be no existence (positive) at all; and (as a consequence) non-existence also would be impossible.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 99]—(959)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As shown before (under 956, above) ‘Negations would abandon their negative character’,—hence if there were exclusion of the *non-existent*, it would be a positive entity; and as this would involve the idea of the nonexistent also being a positive entity, which would be contrary to the Apohist’s doctrine,—this would be a great calamity for him.

It might be said—‘The Negation may be an *entity*, what then?’

The answer is—‘*When there is no Negation, etc*. *etc*.’—When there would be no Negation, there would be no ‘existence’ of anything at all; because, according to your view, *existence* is only the *exclusion* or *negation of non-existence*; so that, when Negation is ‘excluded’, it becomes an Entity, and loses its character; hence there can be no *non-existence* either; as that also is only the *exclusion* or *negation of existence*, and *existence* does not exist, as shown above.—(959)
