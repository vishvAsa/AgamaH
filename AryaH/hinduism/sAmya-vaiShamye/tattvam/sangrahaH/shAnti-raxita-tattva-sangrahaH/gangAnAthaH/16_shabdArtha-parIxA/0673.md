> “There can be no difference among Apohas, because they are non-entities, and devoid of all such conceptions as ‘related ‘one’ and’ many.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 45]—(926)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Such conceptions as ‘related’, ‘one’ and ‘many’ are possible only in regard to an entity, not to a non-entity; and as *Apohas* are *non-entities*, there can be no such conceptions in regard to them as being ‘mutually related’ and so forth; how then can there be any difference among them?—(926)
