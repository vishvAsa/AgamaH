> In the case of the eye and other things, all tending to bring about the single effect in the shape of the cognition of colour,—if someone were to apply a common name, even without a comprehensive (common) element [in the same manner would it be in other cases also].—(1035)



## Kamalaśīla

*Question*:—“Without a single comprehensive (all-embracing) factor, how can a single word be rightly applied to several things?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1035 above*]

As a matter of fact, the application of words to things depends entirely upon the whim (of people). For instance, the Eye, Colour, Light and Mind, all tend to bring about the single effect of Colour-cognition; if some one, through sheer whim,—even without there being a common element,—were to apply a single word (name) to them,—would there be any one to prevent him from doing so? Among all these things, the Eye and the rest, there is no Common Element, in the form of ‘being productive of visual perception’; specially because you regard the Universal, the Ultimate Differentia and Inherence also to be productive of visual perception’; and in thengs in question, there is no Universal or Inherence either; because the Universal cannot belong to a Universal, and in Inherence also there cannot be a second Inherence.—(1035)
