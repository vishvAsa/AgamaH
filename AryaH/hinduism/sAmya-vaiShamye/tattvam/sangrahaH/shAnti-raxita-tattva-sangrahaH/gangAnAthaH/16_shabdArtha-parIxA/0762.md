## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued above (under *Text* 932) that—“No one can be able to conceive, in regard to the Cow, the unknown similarity in the object of *Apoha*, etc. etc.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1050 above*]

The compound ‘*apohyāpohagocarāḥ*’ is made up of the ‘*apohya*’ ‘what are excluded’—i.e. (in the case of the word ‘Cow’) the Horse and other animals,—and the ‘*apohagocara*’, ‘what are contained in the exclusion’,—i.e. the Variegated and other Cows; these are so spoken of as the ‘exclusion of the non-Cow’ pertains to them.

Thus, though there is no concomitance of any *commonalty*, yet, those that bring about the determinate judgment of *non-different* things are regarded as having their similarity well known,—while those that bring about the determinate judgment of *diverse* things,—are regarded as otherwise (i.e. as having their similarity unknown).—(1050)
