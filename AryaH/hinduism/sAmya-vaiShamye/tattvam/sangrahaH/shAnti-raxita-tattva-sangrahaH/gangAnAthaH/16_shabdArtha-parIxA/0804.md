> If what belongs to the universal ‘lotus’ is different from what is related to the quality and universal (blue),—then the words ‘blue’ and ‘lotus’ cannot be co-substrate (co-ordinated).—(1111)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“The word ‘lotus’ does not denote exactly the same thing that is related to the quality *Blue* and the Universal ‘Blue’; it denotes something different. Hence the word ‘lotus’ cannot be useless.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1111* above]

There is a hiatus after the particle ‘*yadi*’ (‘if’).

‘*They cannot be co-substrate*’;—i.e. they cannot be co-ordinated.—(1111)
