> Nor is there any incongruity in universals and particulars being denoted by words, as appertaining to larger and smaller number of things,—on the basis of the inference of the relevant convention.—(1045)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“The words may not be synonymous,—because a distinction is assumed in the things; but how can there be the difference between words denoting Universals and those denoting Particulars, unless there are Universals and Particulars?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1045 above*]

For example, the word ‘Tree’ brings about the ‘Reflection’ inferred in the shape of the ‘Exclusion of non-trees’,—in regard to *all trees*—the *Dhava*, *Khadira*, *Palāśa* and so forth; hence, as appertaining to a larger number of things, what is denoted by the Word is spoken of as the ‘Universal’ (Commonalty).—On the other hand, in the case of the word ‘*Dhava*’, there is ‘exclusion of the *Khadira* and other trees’, which brings about the conception of only a few of the trees (the *Dhava* ones only); hence what is denoted by it is said to be a ‘Particular’.—(1045)
