> In the case of the word ‘all’, the negation of all parts is not what is meant to be spoken of; hence the incongruity of the ‘exclusion of its own meaning’ that has been urged has been so under ignorance.—(1188)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under Text 983, by *Uddyotakara*) that—“If it be held that *one* and the rest are excluded by the word ‘all’, etc. etc”.

The answer to that is as follows:—[*see verse 1188 above*]

If it were meant that when the word ‘all’ is used in a sentence in the course of usage, there is negation of *all parts*,—then there might be ‘exclusion of its own meaning—As a matter of fact however, what is held to be negatived is only that which is open to doubt by the dull-witted person; how then can there be any ‘*exclusion* of its own meaning’?

The same reasoning applies to the ease of such words as ‘*ādi*’ and the like.—(1188)
