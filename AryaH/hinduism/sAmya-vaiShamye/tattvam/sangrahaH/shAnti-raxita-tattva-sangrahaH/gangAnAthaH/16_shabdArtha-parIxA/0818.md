> How too can there be such words as ‘*abhāvaḥ*’ (masculine), ‘*nirupākhyam*’ (neuter) and ‘*tucchatā*’ (feminine)?—From all this it follows that the entire scheme of three genders is purely conventional.—(1133)

The following *Text* states the objection that is equally applicable to all:—[*see verse 1133 above*]

Thus it follows that the entire scheme of the three Genders is based solely upon Conventions made according to the whim of speakers.—(1133)
