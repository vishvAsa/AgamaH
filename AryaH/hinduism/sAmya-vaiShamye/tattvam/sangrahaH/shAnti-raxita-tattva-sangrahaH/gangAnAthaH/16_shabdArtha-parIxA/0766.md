> The specific individuality that is differentiated from ‘man’s horns’ and other non-existent things is also differentiated from permanent things,—just as the cognition, the lamp-flame, etc. are;—the specific individuality of sound, etc. is not a non-existent thing.—In this way there can be the assertion of concomitance through differences as indicated.—(1055-1056)



## Kamalaśīla

That Specific Individuality which is differentiated from the *non-existent*, because it is not non-existent,—is also differentiated from *Permanent Things*,—as we find in the case of Cognition, Lamp-flame and such things.

The necessary concomitance can be asserted in this way,—without touching upon any *particulars*; and there would be nothing incongruous in this.

The concomitance shown here is in regard to the Probans ‘because it exists’; [the inference being in the form—‘The Specific Individuality of Sounds, etc. is differentiated from Permanent Things, *because it exists*,—like Cognition, Lamp-flame, etc.’].—(1055-1056)
