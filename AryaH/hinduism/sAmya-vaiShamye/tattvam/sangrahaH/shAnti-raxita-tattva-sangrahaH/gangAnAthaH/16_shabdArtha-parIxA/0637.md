## Kamalaśīla

Of these three—Individual, Configuration and Universal,—the idea of the Individual and the Configuration, being denoted by words, should be taken as rejected by the foregoing rejection of the idea of the Specific Individuality forming the denotation of words.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 881 above*]

That is to say, the rejection of the Universal will come later.

‘*Rejection*’—as forming the ‘import’ of words.

“Why?”

Inasmuch as ‘*both these*’—Individual and Configuration,—are held by others to be of the nature of ‘Specific Individuality’; so that just as ‘Specific Individuality’ cannot be denoted by Words, because there can be no Convention bearing upon it,—so also, in regard to these two also, there can be no Convention; hence the Reason cannot be said to be either ‘Unproven’, or ‘Inconclusive’.—(881)
