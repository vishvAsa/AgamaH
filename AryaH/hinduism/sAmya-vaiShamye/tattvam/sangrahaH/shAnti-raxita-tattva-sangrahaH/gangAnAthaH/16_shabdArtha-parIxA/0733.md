> The word is said to ‘denote’, because it produces a reflection of the conception of the external thing; it does not touch the exclusive factor in the shape of the specific individuality; apart from the said production of the reflection, there is no other denotative function of the word.—(1017-1018)



## Kamalaśīla

The following *Texts* explain this same declaration of *Diṅnāga’s*:—[*see verses 1017-1018 above*]

What the revered Teacher means is as follows;—Of the word, there is no function of denoting external things, other than the producing of the Reflection of the Conception apprehending those things; because all entities are devoid of activity. Hence when the word produces the Reflection of the conception tending to the apprehension of the external thing, it is said that ‘it denotes its meaning’. It does not touch *the exclusive factor*, in the shape of Specific Individuality as excluded (distinguished) from like and unlike things; as this would serve no useful purpose.

‘*Apart from*, *etc. etc*.’;—i.e. apart from the producing of the said *Reflection*, there is no other denotative function of the word.—(1017-1018)
