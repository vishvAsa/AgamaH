> “It is held that what is denoted is Apoha only; under this theory, there can be no possibility of the relation of qualification and qualified or of co-ordination, in the case of such verbal expressions as ‘blue-lotus’, which have a mixed connotation; because the ‘exclusion of the non-blue’ does not involve the ‘exclusion of the non-lotus’,—nor does the latter involve the former, hence the relation of qualification and qualified is not possible (between the blue colour and the lotus).—Nor would the said relation be possible between the words apart from what they denote.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 115-117]—(967-969)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

“With a view to explaining these,—the relation of *qualification and qualified* and the *co-ordination*,—the *Bauddha* has made the following statement:—“Words denote diverse things on account of the diversity of the things ‘excluded’; they are ineffective in the matter of their own diversity. They become the *qualification* and the *qualified* when bringing about the same effect; and the difference being based upon that fact alone, it is not abandoned by their own Commonalty; and yet the said difference has not been asserted, as there is doubt regarding it; and when the two are equal and similar, then they serve the same purpose”.

The following *Text* proceeds to show that all this cannot be right:—[*see verse 967-969 above*]

What was rejected before was the possibility of the relation of *qualification and qualified* between the things denoted; what is rejected now is the same relation between words; hence there is no repetition.

The relation of *qualification and qualified* consists in each of the two serving to differentiate the other; and this is held to be present only in a number of words connected together,—such as ‘Blue lotus It appears also in the case of expressions where the terms are not co-ordinated; e.g. in the expression ‘King’s officer It is said to be a case of ‘co-ordination’ when two words, having different connotations, are applied to the same object; such ‘co-ordination’ is held to be present only in compounds like ‘Blue-lotus’,

Now in regard to such verbal expression as ‘Blue-lotus,’ and the like,—whose connotation is mixed,—there is ‘co-ordination’,—and this would not be possible under the *Apoha-theory*.

‘*Mixed connotation*’—i.e. a connotation of mixed character. As declared in the statement—‘The *Blue-lotus* is neither *Blue only* nor the *Lotus only*, because what is denoted is the combination of both’.

*Question*:—Why is this not possible under the *Apoha-theory*?

*Answer*:—‘*Because, etc. etc*.’, Because on the ‘exclusion of the *nonblue*’, there is no ‘exclusion of the *non-lotus*’, Nor does the *latter*—i.e.‘Exclusion of the *non-Lotus*’—involve the *former*—i.e. the ‘exclusion of the *non-blue*—[In some texts, the reading is ‘*itarā*’ for ‘*itaraḥ*’; where the Feminine form may be taken as with reference to the term ‘*Cyutiḥ*’; ‘*itarā*’ thus standing for the ‘*Cyuti*’ exclusion, of the Non-Blue].—What is meant is that these two do not stand in the relation of *container and contained*, because both are featureless. And when there is no relation, there can be no relation of *qualification and qualified*; if there were, we would be landed in absurdities.

What is meant by this is that under your theory there can be no *mixed connotation*, as all words denote mere *negation*; and hence the relation of *qualification and qualified* is not possible.

It might be argued that—‘there may be no relation of *qualification and qualified* between what are denoted by the words,—why should it not subsist between the words themselves?’

The answer to this is—‘*Nor would, etc. etc*.’, that is, it is only through their denotations that the relation of *qualification and qualified* becomes attributed to the words; hence when the said relation is not possible between what are denoted, how can there be any attributing of it to the denotative words?—(967-969)
