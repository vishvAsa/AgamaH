> “If the negation of a negation is different from it,—then it must be a positive entity. If not, then the cow will be the same as the non-cow for you.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 97]—(957)



## Kamalaśīla

Then again, the *Apohas* could be either different or non-different among themselves. If they are held to be different, then there are objections to that view.—This is shown in the following—[*see verse 957 above*]

If, ‘*Of the negation*’—i.e. of that negation which is denoted by the word ‘non-cow’,—‘the negation’—i.e. that which is denoted by the word ‘cow’,—were different from the former Negation,—i.e. something other than it,—then it would be a *Positive Entity*; because the *positive character* consists only in the *absence of negation*.

If it is not different from it, then, for you, the *Cow* also should be *Non-Cow*; because what is *not-different* must be understood to be the *same*.—(957)
