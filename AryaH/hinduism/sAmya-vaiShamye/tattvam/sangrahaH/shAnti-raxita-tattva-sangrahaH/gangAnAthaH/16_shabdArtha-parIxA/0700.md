> “When individualities could not be what is ‘excluded by apoha’ because they are not denoted by words,—then the commonalty (universal) alone is what could be ‘excluded’; and because of its ‘exclusion’, it must be an entity.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 95]—(955)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The author proceeds to prove, in another way, the fact of Commonalty (Universal) being a real entity:—[*see verse 955 above*]

‘*Individualities*’.—That is, the *Uncommon* (Specific) Entities—cannot be expressed by words; hence they cannot be regarded as ‘excluded’; because what is not spoken of cannot be denied (or excluded).

*The Commonalty alone is what could be excluded*,—that is, because that alone is what is expressed by words.—(955)
