> If they were dependent upon the speaker’s whim, then the cognitions would not envisage the things at all. under that whim, the cognitions should be of one form, and yet the thing is not of one form.—(1124)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged:—“Even though all things may have three genders, yet the cognitions of things would appear exactly as envisaging that form alone which the speaker may desire to speak of; hence they could not be of variegated character.”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1124* above]

‘*If they*, etc.’—i.e. if the cognitions were dependent upon the whim.

If, through the Speaker’s whim, the Cognitions be of one form, then the Cognitions in question could not envisage things of three kinds (as having three Genders); because no single thing has that (mixed) form; and it would thus be as objectless as the visual cognition of sound!

‘*Tadvaśāt*’,—i.e. through the speaker’s whim,—(1124)
