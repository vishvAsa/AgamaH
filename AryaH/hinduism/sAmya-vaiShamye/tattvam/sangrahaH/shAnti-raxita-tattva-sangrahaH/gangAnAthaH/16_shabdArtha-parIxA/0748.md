> In reality, words are neither synonymous nor not-synonymous; as it has been explained that what is denoted by them is neither one and the same nor diverse.—(1033)



## Kamalaśīla

If what is denoted by words were really different or non-different, then they could be either synonymous or not-synonymous. As a matter of fact, however, it has been explained above (under *Text*, 871) that neither Specific Individuality, nor the Universal, nor what is possessed of the Universal, can be really denoted by words.—(1033)

“How then is there the restriction regarding words being synonymous and not-synonymous?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1034 next*]
