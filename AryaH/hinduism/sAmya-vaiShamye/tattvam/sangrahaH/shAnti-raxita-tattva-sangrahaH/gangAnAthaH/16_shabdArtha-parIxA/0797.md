> The ‘impossibility of the positive’ has been averred oh the ground that such things as the ‘universal’ and the like cannot form the subject of words and determinate conceptions.—(1097)



## Kamalaśīla

The following might be urged by the other party:—“If it is admitted that the Word does denote positive entities, then, how is it that in the *Hetumukha*, the *Lakṣaṇakāra* has spoken of the ‘impossibility of the positive’?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1097 above*]

Inasmuch as there are no real ‘denoted things’ or ‘denotative words’ in the shape of the ‘Universal’ and the like,—there can be no *real* subject for Words and Determinate Conceptions,—it has been asserted by the great Teacher,—in view of the *real* state of things,—that ‘there is impossibility of the Positive’; hence there is no contradiction at all.—(1097)
