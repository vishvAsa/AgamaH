> The cow and the non-cow are both well-established,—as there are distinct determinate judgments in regard to both; it is only the word that is not well-established; and hence it is applied according to the speaker’s whim.—As a matter of fact, a distinct thing does not need for its apprehension, the apprehension of another thing; hence there is no room here for the charge of ‘mutual interdependence’.—(1063-1065)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued above (under *Texts*, 943-944, by *Kumārila*) that—“It is only the well-established non-Cow that could be *excluded*, and it is of the nature of the *negation of the Cow*, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 1064-1065 above*]

As a matter of fact, things like the Cow, by themselves, bring about distinct determinate judgments regarding themselves, and as such, are well- known in their distinct forms. For the purpose of speaking of them, people make use of words, which are not well known, through their whims. Under the circumstances, if the form of a distinct thing required, for its own apprehension, the apprehension of another different thing,—then there might have been mutual interdependence. As a matter of fact, however, the distinct thing is apprehended without the apprehension of another thing; and when it is definitely known as something distinct bringing about a distinct determinate judgment,—and then the Convention is made in the form ‘this is a *Cow*’, ‘that is a Cow’ and so forth,—according to the man’s wish,—how then, can there be any mutual interdependence?

‘*Vittau*’—stands for ‘*vittyartham*’, *for the apprehension*.—(1064-1065)
