> Inasmuch as the Apohas are apprehended as ‘things’ they cannot be regarded as non-entities; this is well known and admitted as pertaining to the illusory aspect of things. as regards the real aspect, what the opponent seeks to prove is accepted by us already.—(1089)



## Kamalaśīla

It has been argued (under Text 964, by *Kumārila*) that—“There could be no relation of *Denoter and Denoted*, between two *Apohas*”.—

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 1089 above*]

If by the reason adduced—“*Because they are non-entities*”—it is meant to be a general statement of fact, then that is *not admitted*; because the two *Apohas* in question.—which are in the form of *Reflections*—one of which is the *denoter* and the other is the *denoted*,—are actually recognised by deluded persons as *external things*; and hence they are endowed with *illusory reality*.—(1089)

If, on the other hand, the Reason adduced pertains to the Real Character of ‘Entity’,—then the argument is superfluous. Because in fact, we do not accept anything as being the *denoter* or *denoted, in reality*.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 1090 next*]
