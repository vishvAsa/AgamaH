> “In the case of the word ‘all’ (‘*sarva*’) what is it that is assumed to be the ‘excluded’? There is no such thing as the non-all, which could be excluded.—If it be urged that ‘one and the rest’ are the non-all, then it comes to be the exclusion of the denotation itself; as the parts would be excluded, and no whole is admitted.—Similarly, in regard to the denotation of the word ‘group’ (‘*samūha*’), the constituents would be excluded; and nothing apart from this is admitted; hence all such words become deprived of their meaning.—As regards the words ‘two’ and the rest, which also are applied to groups, as the ‘one’ and other constituents would be excluded, they could no longer be so applicable.—Then again, the denotation of the word ‘cow’ is said to be the ‘non-non-cow’;—now is this positive or negative? If it is positive, is it the cow or the non-cow?—If it is the cow, then there is no dispute; as the denotation turns out to be of the positive character. On the other hand, if it is the non-cow that is denoted by the word ‘cow’,—that would exhibit a wonderful insight into the meanings of words indeed!—Nor can it be negative; as, in that case injunction and the rest would not be possible.—Nor does any one ever comprehend a negation from the word ‘cow’.”—(982-988)



## Kamalaśīla

*Uddyotakara* has argued as follows:—“It cannot be right to say that words denote the *Apoha* of other things; because this explanation cannot apply to all words; that is to say, in the case of words where there are two mutually exclusive contradictions, it may be that when one is affirmed the other is denied; as for instance, it may be true that when the word ‘Cow’ is heard, the *Cow is* affirmed and the *non-Cow* is denied. But this is not possible in the case of the word ‘*Sarva*’ (‘all’), as there is no suchng as *non-all*, which could be denied by the word ‘all’.—‘But in this case also, there is denial or preclusion of *one and the rest*; so that our explanation takes in this case also—You mean that *one and the rest* are the contradictories of *all*, the *non-all* which are excluded by the word ‘all’.—But this is not right; as it involves the incongruity of words abandoning their own meaning. If the word ‘all’ excludes *one and the rest*,—inasmuch as these latter are what go to make up the *All*, and (for the Buddhist) the *whole* has no existence apart from its constituents, the exclusion of *one and the rest* would mean the exclusion of everything that goes to make up the *All*, and there would be nothing left for the word ‘all’ to denote: and this word would thus become meaningless.—[The word ‘*aṅga*’ stands for *part*].—Similarly all *collective* words, like ‘group’ and the rest, would become meaningless, if they were used for the exclusion of their own constituents; as it is held that the *group* has no existence apart from the members that make up that group.—As for the words ‘two’ and the rest, they also pertain to groups (of Two, Three, etc.); so that, if they denoted the exclusion of one *and the rest*,—as these, being precluded, would not be there to make up the said groups, the words would become meaningless.”

This is the argument that is indicated by the words—‘*They would not be so applicable*’ (Text 985). What is meant is that the words in question are accepted as applicable to groups; but they would cease to be so applicable.

“Further, when it is asserted that what the word ‘Cow’ denotes is the ‘*Apoha* of other things’,—i.e. something that is ‘not non-Cow’,—is this something (A) Positive or (B) Negative?—(A) If it is Positive, is it the *Cow* or the *non-Cow*?—If it is the *Cow*, then there is no quarrel between us.—If it is the *non-Cow* that is held to be denoted by the word ‘Cow’,—this shows a wonderful insight into the meanings of words!—(B) Nor can it be something Negative; as nothing negative can form the subject of any injunction or comprehension thereof; as a matter of fact, when one hears the word ‘Cow’, neither the Injunction nor its comprehension pertains to anything merely negative.”

This is the argument that is indicated in the words ‘*Nor can it be negative, etc., etc*.’—‘*Praiṣa*’ stands for *Praiṣaṇa*, Injunction; that is, the urging of the hearer by the Speaker to something; this belongs to the Speaker; while ‘*Comprehension*’ belongs to the hearer.—The term ‘*and the rest*’ is meant to include such nouns as ‘carrier’, ‘milker’ and the like.

Lastly, it is by actual experience that the meaning of words is comprehended; and as a matter of fact, no one ever comprehends *negation* from the word ‘Cow’,—(982-988)
