> The author of the Veda having been established in the manner above described, you have to admit of the person capable of perceiving supersensuous things. In this way, the intelligent man would be able to see subtle things, and while transcending the limitations of his own kind, he would be rising above other men.—(3402-3403) 
>
> Just as the capacity of the ear and other sense-organs in relation to their objects, becomes improved by special exercise, medication and other means,—so would be the case with the mind also.—(3404)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[*verses 3402-3403*]:

It has been argued under *Text* 3161 that—“Even the intelligent man who is capable of perceiving subtle things is superior to other persons, without going beyond the limitations of his own kind”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3402-3403 above*]

‘*In the manner described*’—by us, under the chapter on ‘the Revealed Word’.

The author states an argument in support of the above:—[*see verse 3404 above*]

[*verse 3404*]

As a matter of fact, the potency of the sense-organs—Ear and the rest—relating to their objectives, becomes improved by particular exercises and by the application of particular unguents, etc.; and in the same manner it is quite possible that the capacity of the Mind also should become improved by certain special means.—(3404)
