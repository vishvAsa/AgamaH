> If the universals continue to exist as related to the individuals, the eternality of the individuals also is irresistible. or (conversely), if the individuals exist as related to the universals, then the universals also should be noneternal, even if you do not relish it.—(2691-2692)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Granting (for the sake of argument) the relationship between the Universal and the Individual, the Author proceeds to point out objections—[*see verses 2691-2692 above*]

Every Relationship subsists between two relatives; Universals are regarded as eternal; hence what exists in the form related to the Universal, must itself be eternal. Otherwise the Universals would not have their form consisting of the relationship of the Individuals. Similarly, as Individuals are held to be non-eternal, the Universals, which consist in the relationship to these, must also be non-eternal. If the Individuals are non-eternal, the

Universals must also be non-eternal. If it were not so, then, while one of the two relatives would be there in a perfect condition, it cannot be right for the other to be imperfect; as in that case, the Relationship itself would cease.—(2691-2692)
