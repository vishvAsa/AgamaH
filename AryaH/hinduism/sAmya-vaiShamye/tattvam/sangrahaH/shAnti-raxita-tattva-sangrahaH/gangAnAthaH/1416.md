> “Even if the auditory organ (as consisting of the indivisible *ākāśa*) were all-pervading and one,—the embellishment due to articulation could affect only the material substratum of that organ; hence that man alone hears the sound the substratum of whose organ is affected by that embellishment.”—(*Ślokavārtika*—eternality of words, 68-69].—(2185)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘*Vyāpi*’—‘*Ekam*’—qualify ‘*Śrotram*’ (understood).

Even so, that man alone, no other, hears the Sound whose ‘Ear-drum’, as the substratum of the Auditory Organ—is affected by the embellishment due to articulation.

What is meant by this is that the embellishment affects the *substratum*, not the Auditory Organ;—and as the substratum varies with each person, the objections in question do not apply at all.—(2185)
