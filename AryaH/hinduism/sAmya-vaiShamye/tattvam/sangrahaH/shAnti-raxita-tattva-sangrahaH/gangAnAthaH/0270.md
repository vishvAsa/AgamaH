> These people should be told that (according to what they have said), the *pudgala* cannot be regarded as existing in reality;—because it is incapable of being spoken of either as the same or as different (from thought-phases);—just like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such non-entities.—(338)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following Text proceeds to show that like other things, the *Pudgala* also cannot be regarded as *existing*, because it is *incapable of being spoken of*;—this conclusion being deducible from your own words:—[*see verse 338 above*]

The argument may be formulated, as follows:—That which is incapable of being spoken of either as the same as, or as different from, a thing cannot be an entity,—as the sky-lotus;—and the *Pudgala* is (*ex hypothesi*) incapable of being so spoken of;—hence the wider character being absent (the narrower character must be absent); the corroborative instance *per dissimilarity* is supplied by Feelings etc.—(338)

*Question*—‘How is the invariable concomitance (Premiss) urged here arrived at?’

The answer is provided by the following—[*see verse 339 next*]
