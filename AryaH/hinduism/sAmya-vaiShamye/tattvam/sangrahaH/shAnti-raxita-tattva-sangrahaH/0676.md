> “When even the substrata to which they are related do not make any difference in the form of the Apohas,—that they would be differentiated by the excluded things, which are exterior to them, would be an assumption that is too far-fetched.”—[*Ślokavārtika*-*Apoha* 52]—(929)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That is to say, when the things to which they are related, the *vanegated* and other Cows—which are their substrata—enter into their very constitution,—are unable to produce any difference in the essence of the *Apohas*,—inasmuch as even among the several cows, variegated and the rest, the *Apoha*, in the shape of the ‘Exclusion of the non-cow’, is held to be one only,—then how could this *Apoha* be rendered diverse by the objects excluded—such as the Horse, etc.—which are exterior to it? A thing that cannot be diversified by that which enters into its very constitution cannot certainly be diversified by what is exterior to it; as in that case the latter would cease to he exterior.

For this reason, what has been suggested is too much of an assumption.—This has been said in a joking spirit.—(929)
