> We are not objecting to the single cognition in the form of ‘*gauḥ*’, the cow; but the notion of oneness regarding the word is due to the facts—(1) that it is apprehended by a single idea and (2) that it denotes a single thing.—(2729)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Grammarians urge the following objection—“If there is no such single entity as the ‘*Sphoṭa*’, of the nature of the Word,—then how is it that on the utterance of the word ‘*go*’, (‘Cow there appears the single cognition in the one form of ‘*gauḥ*’ (and not in that of the component letters)?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2729 above*]
