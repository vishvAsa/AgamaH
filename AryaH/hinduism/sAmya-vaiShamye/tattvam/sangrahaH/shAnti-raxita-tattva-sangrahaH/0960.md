In connection with the Bow, there are such notions as—(a) ‘The *Bow* pierces’, (b) ‘He pierces *with the Bow*’, (c) ‘the arrow proceeding *from the Bow*, pierces’,—where the same *Bow* is spoken of as (a) ‘Agent’, (b) ‘Instrument, and (c) ‘Ablative—and this distinction is only imaginary (not real); and yet it is not incongruous; so it is in the case in question also.—(1347)
