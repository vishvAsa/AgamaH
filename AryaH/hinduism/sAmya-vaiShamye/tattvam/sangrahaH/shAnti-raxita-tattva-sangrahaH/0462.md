> “Inasmuch as conjunction is not all-embracing in its character, the colouring cannot belong to all the cloth; nor is the whole found to be covered.”—(600)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

He argues as follows:—“The colour spoken of as belonging to the *Cloth* is of the nature *Conjunction* (contact) with such colouring substances as the red dye, saffron and so forth; and Conjunction is a quality that is not *all-embracing*; hence when one (part) is coloured, the whole does not become coloured.—Similarly when one part of the body is covered by the Cloth, the whole body does not become covered.—(600)

The following *Text* shows that this explanation is not right:—[*see verses 601-602 next*]
