> “If another sublating cognition of it is further sought for, then the middle (second) cognition would become sublated; which would establish the validity of the first cognition.—If even after due effort at seeking for it, no other sublating cognition is found,—on account of there being no basis for it,—then no cognition sublative of the first sublative cognition would be found; and thus there being no sublation of this, this becomes strong and hence sublates the initial cognition; hence it is the validity of this latter that becomes discarded. Thus then, the investigator need not proceed beyond three cognitions; and when the man has not had any further sublating cognition produced, he need not suspect the presence of such cognition.”—(2868-2871)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If, on further investigation, one finds that there is a sublater of that sublater also, then, as the second Cognition would be set aside by this third sublater, the first Cognition would become valid. If the further (third) sublating Cognition does not appear, on account of the absence of the basic-cause, then the second Cognition, which is more powerful, sublates the first Cognition, and thereby its validity becomes set aside.

‘*Need not proceed beyond*, *etc. etc*.’—“Who?”—The Man, the observer. *Question*:—“On the appearance of the third Cognition also, why is there no need for a further sublating Cognition,—as in the case of the second Cognition;—and why should there be only three Cognitions for the investigator?”

*Answer*:—‘*When no further sublating cognition, etc*. *etc*.’;—‘*produced*’—found by the investigator.—(2868-2871)

*Question*:—“Why should it not be suspected?

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2872 next*]
