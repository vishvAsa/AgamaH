> The cognition that appears in the case of the man covered by the cloak is inferential, and does not appertain to the man at all; because what is really cognised in this case is the cloak having the shape due to the man.—(567)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Another instance cited by the Opponent was that of ‘the man covered by a cloak’,—That also cannot be regarded as ‘Perception’; because it is accompanied by a verbal expression (‘this is a man’), and also because it is *indistinct* It can at best be regarded only as an ‘Inferential Cognition’, as pertaining to the ‘man’ in the shape of *the aggregate of Colour and other Qualities*. So that this also does not serve to prove the existence of the *Composite Substance*.—This is what is shown in the following:—[*see verse 567 above*]

The compound ‘*taddhetusanniveśasya*’ is to be expounded as ‘the cloak which has the shape of which the Man,—who is only an aggregate of Colour, etc.—is the Cause’,—This shows that the inferential Cognition is brought about by the particular indicative mark called the ‘Effect’.—(567)
