> “If the said entity were entirely devoid of dissimilarity from the other standard entities,—then that entity would not be different from these; there would be complete non-difference,—as from their own selves. what is called ‘dissimilarity’ is only a form different from those; hence the idea that ‘there is no dissimilarity, and yet the thing is different’ would involve a self-contradiction. Consequently, when one has to accept some sort of difference among things, he has to accept ‘dissimilarity’ also, and thence also the ‘particular’ character of things.”—(1717-1719)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Texts* provide reasons for accepting the ‘difference’ (*particular* character) of things from one another:—[*see verse 1717-1719 above*]

‘*Standard, entities*’—the Cloth and the rest (to which the Jar is being compared).—If the Jar were entirely devoid of dissimilarity to these other things—Cloth, etc.—then, there being no difference between them, the Jar could not be any thing different from those things; as it would be non-different from it, like the form of its own self. For instance, what is called ‘dissimilarity’ is only that form of the Jar which is different from the Cloth,.—nothing apart from that form; hence to say that ‘there is *dissimilarity'* in the *Cloth*, etc., and yet there is no *difference* from the *Jar*’, would involve self-contradiction;—as ‘difference’ and ‘dissimilarity’ are synonymous terms.—(1717-1719)
