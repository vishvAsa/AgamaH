> Because the truth that has been found in the buddhist doctrine, through proofs with well-established premises,—has not been so found in any other doctrine,—therefore please draw as many definite conclusions as you can, through various reasonings and counter-reasonings, which are well-founded and not swallowed by their own reflections.—(3352-3353)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 3153,—How can any definite conclusion be arrived at through such reasonings and counter-reasonings, which are uncertain and swallowed by their own reflections?”

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3352-3353 above*]

‘*Yat*’—*Because*.

‘*Siddhapratibandhena*’—By means of Premises asserting identity and the causal relations, on the strength of the real state of things.

‘*Tena*’—Therefore.—(3352-3353)
