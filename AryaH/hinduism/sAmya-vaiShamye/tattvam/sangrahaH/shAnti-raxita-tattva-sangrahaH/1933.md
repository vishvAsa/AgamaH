## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued under *Text* 2905, that—“when a firm conviction produced by a sentence is not found to be incompatible with the Cognitions appearing at other times and places and in other men, it is undoubtedly valid”.

‘*Already*’—i.e. under the chapter on the ‘Revealed Word ‘*Is similar to others*’;—i.e. it stands on the same footing as the notion derived from such human assertions as ‘the performance of *Agnihotra* does *not* lead to Heaven—(3089)
