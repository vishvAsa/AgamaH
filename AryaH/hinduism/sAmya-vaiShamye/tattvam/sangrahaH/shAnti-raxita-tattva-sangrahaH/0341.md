> There are two kinds of ‘momentary things’—some are causes of decadence,—e.g. fire is the cause of the decadence (diminution) of cold; and others are not so.—People, not perceiving the truth, think that there is antagonism of various kinds among things, even when the relation of cause and effect is there, as a matter of fact however there is no real ‘antagonism’ among things, in the shape of the relation of the destroyer and destroyed. It is in this sense that the expression ‘notion of antagonism’ has been used.—(441-443)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* proceeds to explain the idea of ‘antagonism’ (relation of *Destroyer and Destroyed*) among things:—[*see verses 441-443 above*]

There are certain things which become causes of the ‘decadence’ of certain other things,—the ‘decadence’ consisting in the production of ‘moments’ of gradually decreasing degrees of intensity; for instance *fire* is the cause of such a ‘decadence’ of *Cold*;—while there are other things *which are not so*,—i.e. not causes of the decadence of things; e.g. *Fire* is not the cause of the ‘decadence’ of *smoke*.—Among the former—i.e. among the causes of decadence,—even though there is the relation of cause and effect,—yet people, having their powers of vision bedimmed by ignorance, think that there is ‘antagonism’ (between the said *cause* and the thing whose decadence has been brought about),—*of various hinds*,—e.g. *Fire* is antagonistic to *Gold*, *Air* is antagonistic to the *Lamp, Light* is antagonistic to *Darkness* and so forth.—In reality, however, there is no such antagonism among things as that between the *destroyer* and the *destroyed*; because when an entity comes into existence, it does so in its complete form,—and it is impossible to bring about any change in the nature of a thing; there can be no cause for any such change,—whether it be different or non-different from the thing. As regards the *non-entity*, nothing can be done to it, simply because it is non-existent.—So that in both ways, the ‘antagonist’ can do nothing. It is for this reason that the Teacher has declared that ‘When your cause is there in its perfect form, and yet there is non-existence (of its effect) while something else is existent, it is spoken of as *antagonism*’;—it is only a *notion* of antagonism; i.e. there is no real antagonism.

The particle ‘*api*’ stands for ‘*ca*’, and should be construed after ‘*eva*’.—(441-443)
