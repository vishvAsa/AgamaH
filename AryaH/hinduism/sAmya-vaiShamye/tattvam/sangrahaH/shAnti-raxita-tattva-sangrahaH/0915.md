> It is only after the thing has been apprehended as the ‘negation of all things other than itself’,—that there appears the conceptual cognition in the said form.—(1273)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*:—“How is it then that it is *said* to be ‘different’?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 1273 above*]

‘*Svabhāvāt*’—other than its own self.—When the Thing has been apprehended as *the negation of*—as differentiated from—all other things,—and when the (non-conceptual) perception in the specific form of the Blue has appeared,—then there follows the Conceptual Content associated with the words ‘it is different’, If this were not so. then it would be something of the nature of purely verbal expression, or the essence of the thing as associated with the verbal expression, through which the thing could be associated with the name ‘different’ or ‘non-different’, and apprehended as such.

From all this it follows that our Reason is not ‘inadmissible’.—(1273)
