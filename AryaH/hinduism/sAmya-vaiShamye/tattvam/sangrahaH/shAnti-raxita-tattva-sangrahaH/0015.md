> If the curd and other effects are already wholly existent in the essence of (their causes) milk and the rest,—then, inasmuch as they would be exactly like the cause, etc. in their essence, what of theirs would be there that would have to be produced?—(17)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“In what way are the two ‘equal’?”

The answer is provided in the following—[*see verse 17 above*]

The argument here set forth is for the purpose of supporting the view that ‘what is already *existent* cannot be produced’ (an argument aimed against the *Sāṃkhya*). If the Effects (Products) in the shape of Curd and the rest exist *wholly*—in their entirety—i.e. in their mature and properly differentiated character, regarding their specific taste, potency and consequences,—*in the essence of their Causes. Milk and the rest*,—then, as they would be already existent, what of their form would be there that would *have to be produced*,—i.e. for the purpose whereof they would have to be produced by such causes as Milk and the rest?—The compound ‘*hetvādisadṛśātmanām*’ is to be analysed as ‘those whose essence is exactly like the Cause, etc.’; the ‘Cause’ here stands for the Primordial Matter; the ‘*etc*.’ stands for the *Sentience*;—and certainly the fully matured Effects being thus circumstanced, what is meant is the fully developed form of the Effects, which, thus, cannot be produced again.—This indicates the two Reasonings that go to demolish any such permanent relation as that between Cause and Effect.—(17)
