> As *ākāśa*, is without parts, the auditory organ could hot consist of *akāśa* as conditioned by merit and demerit,—which is essential for the two limitations referred to above.—(2163)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—The Auditory Organ consists of *Ākāśa* as conditioned by the tympanum embellished by Merit and Demerit; hence as the Sound heard would be subsisting in the *Ākāśa* as contained in the tympanum,—there would be no room for the two undesirable contingencies just pointed out—viz.: (a) that being all-pervading, the Organ would be in equal contact with all Sounds, and (b) that there would be one and the same Organ for all living beings.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 2163 above*]

For that which is impartite, there can be no *parts*, by, virtue of which a certain *part* of *Ākāśa* could constitute the Auditory Organ.

‘*The two limitations*’—the limitation that the contact of the Organ with all-Sounds cannot be the same, and that there are several Auditory Organs.—Or the ‘two limitations’ may be those relating to the *apprehension and non*-*apprehension* of Sound.—(2163)
