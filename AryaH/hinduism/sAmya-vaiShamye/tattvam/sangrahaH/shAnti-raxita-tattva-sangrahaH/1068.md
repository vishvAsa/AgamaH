> “Thus that which is remembered, and which is qualified by the (perceived) similarity, is the object that is apprehended by analogical cognition. or, the object of the said cognition may consist of the similarity itself as subsisting in that (remembered) thing.”—[*Ślokavārtika-upamāna*, 37.]—(1535)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Because Analogical Cognition is as described above, therefore the Cow that is *remembered* and which is qualified by the similarity of the *Gavaya* (seen) is the object apprehended by that Cognition.—Or it may be the *Similarity* itself as subsisting in the Cow.—(1535)
