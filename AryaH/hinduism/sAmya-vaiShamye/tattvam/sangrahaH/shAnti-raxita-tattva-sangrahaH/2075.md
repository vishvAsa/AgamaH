## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the other party, under *Text* 3150, that—“In regard to one matter, of Arithmetic for instance, all beings are found to be truthful and no distinction is found among them, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3348 above*]

The above described ‘Superiority of Knowledge’ of the Blessed Lord, the ‘Suppressor of Māra’ (Desire) having established His ‘Distinction’ (superiority) over *Ṛṣabha*, *Vardhamāna* and others—it is not open to you, if you are truthful, to assert that ‘no Distinction is perceived’. Such is the upshot of the whole.—(3348)
