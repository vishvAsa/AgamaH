> “There is mention of the three deities, Brahmā, etc., in the Veda, which is eternal; and yet the eternality of the Vedas does not become impaired; because Brahmā and the rest are themselves eternal.”—(3210)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—If *Brahmā*, etc. are named in the Veda, then, why should not the Veda be regarded as *non-eternal*, on account of its connection with non-eternal things? If the Vedas are held to be eternal, then the idea that Brahmā, etc. are spoken of in the eternal Veda is incongruous, as the said *Brahmā*, etc. are not-eternal. If there is no incongruity in this, then there can be no incongruity in *Buddha*, etc. also being mentioned in the Veda.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verse 3210 above*]

‘*Tannityatvāt*’—on account of the eternality of *Brahmā* and the other Deities.—(3210)

The same idea is further clarified in the following:—[*see verses 3211-3212 next*]
