> The ‘relative’ (wherein the relation could subsist) having been discarded, whose ‘subsistence’ would it be? and where? still a detailed denial of each (category) is going to be set forth.—(635)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

‘Subsistence’ is described as ‘inherence of the *five* categories’; so that when the *Substance* and other (four) categories—wherein alone the said Relation could subsist,—have been rejected, *whose* ‘*subsistence*’ *would it be? and where?* That is, *of nothing* and *nowhere*; for the simple reason that all that could be the *substratum* and the *subsistent* have been rejected.—(635) The detailed denial of *Qualities* is now set forth.

In this connection, the *Sūtra* (*Vaiśeṣika*) is as follows:—“The following are. the *Qualities*:—Colour, Taste, Odour, Touch, Number, Dimension, Separateness, Conjunction, Disjunction, Priority, Posteriority, Cognitions, Pleasure, Pain, Desire, Hatred and Exertion”; the particle ‘*ca*’, ‘and’, including Gravity, Fluidity, Viscidity, Momentum, Merit and Demerit and Sound.—*Colour* is what is apprehended by the Eye, and subsists in Earth, Water, and Fire;—*Taste* is apprehended by the Gestatory Organ, and subsists in Earth and Water;—*Odour* is apprehended by the Olfactory Organ and subsists in Earth;—*Touch* is apprehended by the Tactile Organ, and subsists in Earth, Water, Fire and Air”,

From among these Qualities, the Text sets forth the denial of the first four—*Colour* and the rest:—[*see verse 636 next*]
