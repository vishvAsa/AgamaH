> Thus then there is no such calamity as that of the non-existent becoming a positive entity. In fact, even on the establishment of the negation, the existence remains there (in the entity),—and the non-existence (of the negation) becomes established thereby.—(1084)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* shows that this also becomes answered by the above pointing out of the *Inconclusive* character of the Opponent’s Reason:—[*see verse 1084 above*]

It has been argued (under the same *Text* 959) that—“if Non-existence is not established, there can be no *Existence*; nor can *Non-existence* be established”.—The answer to tins is that—even on the establishment of the Negation, in the above manner, the *existence* of the Positive Entity does become established; as that rests upon its own nature. And the above-mentioned establishment of Negation also constitutes its *non-existence*.

The answer to this argument has been made out of its turn (along with that to *Kumārila’s* argument put forward under 955 et seq.), because the same answer is applicable to both.—(1084)
