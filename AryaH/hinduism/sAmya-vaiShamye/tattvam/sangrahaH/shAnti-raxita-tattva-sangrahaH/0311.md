> What is meant to be spoken of (by the term ‘*kṣaṇika*’, ‘momentary’) is the thing that does not continue to exist after its coming into existence; and that term may be used either with the affix or without the affix (to which Uddyotaka has taken objection).



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, when a man utters a verbal sound, that sound denotes, in that form alone, only that much of a thing as to which it is applied,—such denotation being due to convention; and in reality there is no ‘basic term’ or an ‘affix’; the term (verbal sound) ‘*kṣaṇika*’ is applied by the learned to only such a thing as does not continue to exist after its coming into existence; and such a thing being meant to be denoted by the term ‘momentary’—it may be used along with an affix or without an affix,—we have no regard for any such use, which is used on the basis of conventions that are purely arbitrary.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verse 390 above*]

‘*Evam*’—i.e. by the term ‘*kṣaṇika*’, ‘momentary.’

‘*With the affix*’—i.e., with the Possessive affix (*Thañ*).—(390)
