> What is meant to be proved is the general pact. nor would the reason be ‘contradictory’; there is no incompatibility between these and the reason, by reason of which incompatibility, it could negative it.—(1964)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It is the third of the above alternative views that is meant by us.

*Nor is the Reason* ‘*Contradictory*’.

“Why?”

Because there is no incompatibility between ‘*being produced from past experience*’ and ‘Love and other feelings’,—by virtue of which incompatibility, the idea of ‘being due to past experience’ could be set aside.

Further, such notions as ‘this world’ and ‘the other world’ are based on differences in the state or condition of things,—and the differences of childhood, youth and so forth.

In this way, the beginninglessness (of things) becomes established. Hence this should not be emphasised—as it amounts to the view-point of other disputants (Naiyāyika, Mīmāṃsaka, etc.).—(1964)
