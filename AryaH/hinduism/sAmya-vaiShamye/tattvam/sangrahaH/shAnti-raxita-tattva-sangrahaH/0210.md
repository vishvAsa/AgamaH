> From this it follows that the said perception of the reflection is an illusion,—appearing in connection with things possessed of diverse unthinkable potencies.—(262a)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Inasmuch as, under both theories, it is not possible for the Reflector to become transformed into the Reflection,—it becomes established that it is an Illusion.

*Question*—“If that is so, then such Illusion appears only in connection withngs like the *Bock-crystal*, and not with things like the *Wall*.”

The answer is supplied by the words—‘*In connection with things possessed of diverse unthinkable potencies*.’—*Diverse*,—of various kinds;—and ‘*unthinkable*’,—are the potencies ofngs; no objection can be raised against the particular potentialities of things,—as these potentialities are the effects of the series of causes that have brought about each thing. In fact, you also can have no dispute against this much; as you have yourself said—‘Who can take objection to the fact that it is *Fire*, not *Ākāśa*, that bums?’,—(262a)

“If that is so, then in the case of Cognition also, the idea of its being transformed into the reflection of its object may be mere Illusion; so that there is no transformation into the reflected form.”

The answer to this is provided in the following Text:—[*see verse 262b next*]
