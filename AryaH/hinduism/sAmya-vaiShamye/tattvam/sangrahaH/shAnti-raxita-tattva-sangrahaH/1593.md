> If it be urged that what is sought to be proved (by the mīmāṃsaka’s argument) is that it is not the substratum of the universal ‘*ga*’, which is of the nature of the ‘exclusion of others’,—that cannot be right; as that will involve the fallacy of the basis of the reason being ‘inadmissible’.—Inasmuch as the letter ‘*ga*’ is nothing apart from ‘the exclusion of the non-*ga*’, to which object would the character of ‘being not apprehended by any cognition other than that of *ga*’ belong?—(2480-2481)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following might be urged—“What is meant to be proved by the-reasoning in question is that the Individual is not the substratum of that *universal* ‘Ga’ which is of the nature of the ‘exclusion of others’; hence there is no ‘futility’ in it; because you (Buddhist) do not hold that the-Individual *Ga* is not the substratum of the ‘exclusion of others’”.

This is the view combated in this *Text*.

Even when what is sought to be proved is put in this way, the Reason becomes ‘inadmissible Because the ‘exclusion of others’ is not anything different from the thing thus ‘excluded’ from others; in fact, it consists of the same Individual ‘*Ga*’; and it is spoken of as ‘exclusion of others’ or ‘*Apoha*.’ etc. when its precise nature is meant to be determined which is thus done through the denial of other exclusions of unlike things. Consequently there being no such *object* which could form the subject of the argument,—to whom could the Reason,—in the form ‘because it is not apprehended by any cognition other than that of *Ga*’—belong? To nothing at all.—(2480-2481)
