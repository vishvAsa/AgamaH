> “In this same manner it may be shown that, if all things are in ‘perpetual flux’, remembrance and such other phenomena would be impossible,—as there would be no single substratum (under that theory).”—(500)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As any single Agent would be impossible, it should be understood that there would be no possibility of any such phenomena as the following s—Remembrance, well-ascertained cognition, seeking for a thing hidden by oneself and so forth. Because in all these, the substratum being different, there would be incongruities; e.g. when *Caitra* is the original *apprehender*, *doubter*, *hider and seeker*,—*Maitra* could not be the *rememberer*, the *ascertainer*, *seeker*, and so forth.—(500)
