> In fact, eternality does not belong even to the Veda well-known as such; because it represents cognition following after effort, or the result of successive cognitions and so forth.—But in case the well-known Veda is accepted as reliable, you have to accept the other rescensional text also as reliable, because that also is Veda.—(3519-3520)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Though the *Ṛgveda* and the rest are well-known as *Veda*, yet it is not well known that they are eternal.

“How so?”

‘*Because*, etc. etc.’; ‘*yat*’ stands for ‘*yasma*’, ‘because’;—the Cognition after effort, or the successive Cognition, is all not-eternal; just like the Jar and other things;—so also is the Veda;—hence it is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—The charges of ‘Inadmissibility’, etc. against this Reason have been fully refuted under the chapter on the ‘Revealed Word’, hence it is not done over again here.

‘*Etasya*’—of the well-known *Veda*.—(3519-3520)
