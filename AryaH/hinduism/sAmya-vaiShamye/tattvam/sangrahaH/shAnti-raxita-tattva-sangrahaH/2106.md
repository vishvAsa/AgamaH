> The young *rāja-haṃsa* (swan) is unable to move out of the house even; but through practice, it becomes able to go beyond the ocean also. Just as this movement of his is the result of the exercise of the particular conditions of the receptacle (i.e. the body),—similarly, why cannot similar, or even higher, powers be possible (in the blessed lord)? at the preceding stage of the ‘Bodhisattva’, however, he is notable to attain such power of movement; but the great sage would certainly attain it on his reaching the highest state of ‘communion’.—(3428-3430)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, it is actually seen that when peculiar conditions are produced in the Receptacle, the Movement reaches very superior excellence; so that from that also we could deduce such perfect movement in the case of the Blessed Lord.—This is what is shown in the following—[*see verses 3428-3430 above*]

The young one of the Swan, in the beginning, is finable even to go out of its nest; but later on, after even slight practice, its wings having grown, it flies even beyond the seas. In the same manner, it is quite possible that other people, through the exercise of the conditions attaching to the body, attain similar process of movement.

“That the bird is enabled to go to distant places, is due to the growth of wings, not to Practice”.

Even after the wings have grown, the young bird is not found to fly up into the air all on a sudden. What happens is that when it begins to fly from one branch to the other of the tree, it flies, at first only to a short distance,—then, having got rid of all fear and doubt, it flies to remoter regions.

Then again, just as in the case of the swan, after it has acquired a particular substratum, it acquires the powers of movement that it did not possess before,—similarly in the case of the Blessed Lord also, it is quite possible that, though He did not possess the particular power at the stage of the ‘*Bodhisattva*’, yet, when He attained a particular stage of Communion, He secured a particular substratum which enabled Him to acquire the movement in question.—This is all that is meant by the Text; the mention of ‘Practice’ has no significance.

The argument may be formulated as follows:—That Practice which is related to the receptacle of a particular condition leads up to the power of going very very far,—as is found in the case of the Practice by the young Swan;—the Practice of human beings also is capable of being related to the receptacle of a particular condition;—hence this is a Reason based upon the nature of things.—(3428-3430)
