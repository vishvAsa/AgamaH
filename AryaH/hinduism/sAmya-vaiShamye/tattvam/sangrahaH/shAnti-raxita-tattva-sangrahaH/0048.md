> “In the producing of their effects, all such causes as merit, demerit and atoms are controlled by an intelligent being,—because they operate intermittently,—like the shuttle and the yarn.”—(50)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Uddyotakara* however has formulated the argument as follows:—“The Causes of the Work,—in the shape of ‘Primordial Matter’, ‘Atoms’ and ‘Destiny’ (Unseen Force)—need a Controller with Superior Intelligence, in the producing of their Effects,—because their activity is intermittent,—like the Yarn, the Shuttle and such other causes (of the Cloth)”.[^1]—

[^1]:  These words are not found in Uddyotakara’s Nyāyavārtika. This idea is there (under Sūtra 4. 1. 21, p. 463, lines 11 et seq.—Bib. Ind. Edn.); but the exact words are not there. Apparently the Commentator has reproduced the sense of Uddyotakara’s argument.

This is the argument set forth in the following Text.—[*see verse 50 above*]

The meaning of this is quite clear.—(50)
