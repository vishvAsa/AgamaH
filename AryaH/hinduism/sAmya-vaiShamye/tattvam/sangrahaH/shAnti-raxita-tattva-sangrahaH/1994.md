> “The assertion is true because it has been made by the omniscient person, and such an omniscient person exists because he asserts it. How can both these notions be established without some other well-known basis?”—(3189)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

As a matter of fact, there can be no certainty regarding the reliability of his word unless it is recognised that it has been spoken by an Omniscient Person; and that the speaker is omniscient is learnt from his own words; hence there is clear interdependence.

‘*Without some other well-known basis*’—i.e. some other well-known reason.—(3189)
