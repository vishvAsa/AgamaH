> We hold that there is doubt also when there is no valid cognition; it arises in regard to existence as well as non-existence, from the absence of the operation of any of the means of right cognition.—(3300)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The ‘absence of the operation of any Means of Right Cognition’ can always be shown in regard to both *existence* and *non-existence* of things; hence there can bè no restriction in this matter. Hence our explanation is that Doubt arises whenever there is no certainty (regarding either *existence* or *non-existence*). This has been thus declared—‘Doubt is that wavering judgment in which the definite cognition of the specific character of any one object is wanting,—and it is due to the uncertainty attaching to Perceptions and Non-perceptions’ (*Nyāyasutra* 1. 1. 23).—(3300)
