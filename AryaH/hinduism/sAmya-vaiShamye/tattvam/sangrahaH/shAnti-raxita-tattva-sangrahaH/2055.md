> The proof in support of the person knowing primordial matter and the spirit and other things, as also of the person knowing all things, has been already declared before, and later on another proof also is going to be set forth.—Hence it is not for nothing that people take the trouble of proving the existence of the person knowing the minute details of the whole world, by means of enthusiastic treatises and discussions.—(3313-3314)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

It has been argued by the *Mīmāṃsaka* under *Texts* 3140-3141 that—“By proving the existence of the Person knowing only *Dharma* and *Adharma* whom the Buddhist postulates, etc. etc.”.

The answer to this is as follows:—[*see verses 3313-3314 above*]

When we try to prove the existence of the Omniscient Person, we do not give up all considerations regarding that Person Himself; in fact our effort is directed towards the proving of the existence of the Person who knows the principal factor of *Dharma* itself. Thus on a previous occasion, under *Text* 3267, we have set forth the proof, in the shape of Presumption, in due accordance with your own view,—where we pointed out that ‘your denial of the Omniscient Person is set aside by the acceptance of the *knower of Dharma*, on the strength of Presumption’;—and we are also going to set forth another proof, in the shape of Inference.—It is not for nothing that people take all this trouble,—in fact, it is for a very right and proper purpose.—(3313-3314)
