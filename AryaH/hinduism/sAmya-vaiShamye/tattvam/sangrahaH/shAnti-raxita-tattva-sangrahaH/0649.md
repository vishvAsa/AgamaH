> What is expressed by the verb ‘to be’ is said to be denoted by words;—is it meant to be the ‘specific individuality’ of things? or the ‘universal’? Or the contact? Or something else which reflects the cognition?—The objections to everyone of these alternatives have been already set forth above. further, as for what is expressed by the verb ‘to be’, which has been held to form the import of words,—there can be no diverse usage based upon that.—(893-894)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The Author now proceeds to refute the various theories (regarding the Import of Words, that have been set forth in *Texts* 887-892):—[*see verses 893-894 above*]

If ‘what is expressed by the Verb *to be*’ is held to be of the nature of what has been expounded before,—then it is open to the same objections that have been previously set forth.—Further, as no definite form can be conceived of in regard to ‘what is expressed by the verb *to be*’,—if that alone were denoted by Words, there could be no such divergent usage of words as ‘Cow’, *gavaya*’, ‘Elephant’ and so forth; as these animals would not be denoted by the words at all.—(893-894)
