## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

*Question*—“How can validity and reliability be accepted as attaching to the Veda as *composed* and *explained* by faultless persons?”

*Answer*:—[*see verse 2402 above*]

This has been thus declared by *Śabarasvāmin* (in his *Bhāṣya* on Sū. 1.1.2)—“As regards the assertion of ordinary men, if it emanates from a trustworthy person,—or if it pertains to something that is directly perceived by the senses,—it must be true”. (*Translation*, p. 4.)

‘*Sadvācaḥ*’—Excellent assertions.—(2402)
