> If, on the other hand, the form of the efficient cause continues (after having brought about the effects), then it should produce the effect over again; because, how could any efficiency be attributed to what is not effective in bringing about due effects? Thus all things would be non-existent and momentary,—like the ‘sky-lotus’,—on account of their being devoid of all efficiency; because—it is efficiency (for effective action) that constitutes the characteristic of (existing) ‘things’.—(415-416)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If the second alternative is accepted, then, as the form of the thing, in the shape of its causal efficiency, would continue,—it should produce its effect over again; because it will not have abandoned its previous form, just like its previous condition; and thus there would come about the same *succession* of effects. This shows that the doctrine of *simultaneity* is contrary to Inferential Reasoning.

It might be argued that—“It may be that the effective action of the Permanent Thing is neither *successive* or *simultaneous*; and yet its efficiency may be there all the same,”

In answer to this, it is said—‘*How could any efficiency*, *etc*. *etct*.’—When the efficiency of things is determined, it is only on the basis of their bringing about their effects; so that when ang does not bring about any effect, how could it be efficient? Otherwise, why could not efficiency be attributed to the ‘sky-lotus’ and other such things also?

Bays the Opponent—“Even though the efficiency of the Thing has disappeared, the *existence* of the Thing is still there (it still *exists*); and as it would be in existence, your Reason becomes *Inconclusive*.”

*Answer*:—‘*Thus all things could be non-existent*, *etc. etc*.’—The only characteristic of an *existing thing* is that it should have the capacity for effective action; if this *capacity* has disappeared, how could *existence*, the characteristic feature of the *entity*, remain there?

Thus it is established that *Ākāśa* and other things which are held to be *non-momentary* (permanent) can only be regarded as ‘non-existent’,—like ‘the son of the Barren Woman’,—because they are devoid of the capacity for effective action, functioning either successively or simultaneously.—(415-416)
