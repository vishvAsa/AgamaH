> In case the object is something lasting, ‘going’ and the rest are all impossible; because such an object should remain the same under all conditions,—(698)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

That object is said to be ‘*non-momentary*’ which remains in the same form always; it is all the more impossible for any Action to appear in such an object; as, like *Ākāśa*, it remains always in the same condition.—This argument may be thus formulated If an object remains always the same, it can have no Action,—as in the case of *Ākāśa*;—the object regarded as ‘ṇon-momentary’ is always of the same condition;—hence there is apprehension of something contrary to what is wider (than the Conclusion of the Opponent).—(698)
