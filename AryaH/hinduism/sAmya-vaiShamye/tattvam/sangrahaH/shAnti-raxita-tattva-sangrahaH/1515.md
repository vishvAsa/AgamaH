## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

[Next follow the arguments against the Reliability of the Revealed Word, Veda.]

The said ‘hostility’ to the Veda is now expounded:—[*see verse 2352 above*]

‘*Ghuṇākṣaravat*’—even by the slightest chance; like the ‘Crow and the Palm-fruit’.—(2352)

[‘*Ghuṇākṣara*’—when insects get into a piece of wood and make holes in it, some times, the holes that appear become, by chance, so arranged as to assume the shape of Letters; hence ‘*Ghuṇākṣara* ‘insect-letters’, stands for ‘mere-chance’. So also ‘Crow and the Palm fruit’ stands for *mere chance*; exemplified by the case when the Palm fruit drops from the tree when the Crow sits upon it, it is mere chance, as the coming of the Grow cannot be the real cause of the falling of the fruit.]
