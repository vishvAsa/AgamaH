> “When he occupies the ten stages, and all his attachment and other defects have ceased, then alone he can apprehend all things, through his knowledge which is like pure crystal. when rapt in meditation, his mind concentrated on the idea of all things, he would be pervaded by all things; and would not be able to impart any teachings.”—(3238-3239)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Or, there may be an Omniscient Person; even so, there can be no ‘words’ (‘assertion’, uttered by Him,—on which your activities could be based.—This is shown in the following:—[*see verses 3238-3239 above*]

Standing upon the Ten Stages, all imposities of Attachment, etc. having disappeared, His Knowledge becomes like the pure crystal, whereby all cognisable things become apprehended such is your explanation.

Now, at this stage, His mind would be concentrated—being intent upon the idea of ail things; so that He could not be in a position to propound any teachings relating particularly to *Dharma*; being unable to perform all these functions all at once.—(3238-3239)
