> If it were so, then, there would be no (*a*) doubt, nor (*b*) wrong cognition (misconception),—in the case of the person recognised as ‘trustworthy’—in the shape of (*a*) ‘are there defects in this person or not?’, and (*b*) ‘there are defects in him’. And yet there are such doubt and wrong cognition in some men; until it is recognised that he is the receptacle of excellences.—(3045-3046)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

If, in bringing about certainty regarding the *absence of defects*, excellences functioned by their mere presence,—then in the case of the person recognised as ‘trustworthy’, no one could have any Doubt or Misconception in regard to the *absence of defects*; as both these will have been barred by the certainty.—And yet such is not the case; so long as the certainty relating to the presence of the excellences does not come about,—there certainly do appear Doubt and Misconception regarding the *absence of defects*. Hence it follows that the excellences are not operative by their mere presence.—(3045-3046)
