> If this were not so,—the objection in question could be urged with equal force against your ‘soul’ also; but all difficulties are removed by the fact that there is diversity in its potencies.—(277)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

Further, even when the ‘I-notion’ is held to have the Soul for its basis,—the objection in question would apply with equal force:—Why does the said notion not appear in connection with another Soul also?—It might be answered that “it is not so because of the restrictions imposed by the potency ofngs”,—then, for us also the same answer would be available,—that the notion appears only in regard to some internal objects, and not in regard to all. So that all difficulties would be removed.—(277)
