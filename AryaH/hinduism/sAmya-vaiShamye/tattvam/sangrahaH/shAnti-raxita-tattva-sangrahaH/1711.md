> Even if the *sphoṭa* is with parts (divisible), as the letters expressing them would do so only in succession, why should not the *sphoṭa*-parts also be likewise? Why should unseen ones be assumed?—(2715)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* points out objections against the view that the *Sphoṭa* is with parts (divisible)—[*see verse 2715 above*]

Would each one of the *Sphoṭa-parts* be without meaning (inexpressive) or with meaning (expressive)?—If the former, then, as those parts would be appearing in succession, the whole *Sphoṭa*—like Letters—would be inexpressive. Its *expressiveness* might be assumed; as there would be attributing a form to a thing which does not have that form. Because the expressive sentence is said to have *one* form only, and its components are *inexpressive*; hence the expressive character of these latter could be only assumed—or figurative,—like the character of the Lion attributed to the Boy. The *expressiveness* thus being assumed, it is far better to regard the component *letters* themselves as expressive,—rather than assume the unseen *Sphoṭa-parts*, to no purpose.

If on the other hand the *Sphoṭa-parts* are expressive (the second view)—then there can be no need for several assumptions; because the ‘Sentence’ is described as a group of words conveying one complete idea; if each part of the sentence were expressive, then there would be as many ‘sentences’ as those parts, and not *one* ‘Sentence’ composed of several component parts. And when the meaning of one of these parts would be comprehended, there would be comprehension of the meaning of the whole sentence. This has been thus declared—‘If each of the parts were expressive, the assuming of several such would be futile; because the comprehension of the meaning of one part would bring about the comprehension of the meaning of the whole sentence—(2715)
