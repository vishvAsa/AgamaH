> There is no distinction perceived between ‘being brought about by the falling insect’ and ‘having its appearance felt on the touch of the falling insect’.—(1397)



## Kamalaśīla’s commentary (tattvasaṃgrahapañjikā):

The following *Text* points out the defect in the third argument (put forward by *Pātrasvāmin*, in *Text* 1373, regarding the ‘falling insect’):—[*see verse 1397 above*]

‘*There is no distinction perceived*’,—between the Probans (Premiss) and the Proposition (Conclusion); that is, the Probans is a part of the Proposition itself. In the case in question, what is meant to be proved is the fact of the Pain being due to a particular insect,—and the same fact is asserted, in different words, in the Probans (Premiss). Hence there is no difference between the Premiss and the Conclusion.—(1397)
