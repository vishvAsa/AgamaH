title: Creation and suffering
---

## Intro
Was there a creation? Then, there is the question of the creator - was it intelligent? Unlike abrahamisms which consider it as an unquestionable axiom, the Hindu vaidika tradition considers it requiring support from argument and speculation.

Varied views:

- kumArIla-bhaTTa the mImAMsaka rejects the notion of a creator or creation as implausible and hard to establish ([eng_gj](https://archive.org/stream/slokavartika015341mbp#page/n427/mode/2up), [sa_kb](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.273885/page/n667)).
- The Samkhyakarika accepts the notion of higher selves or perfected beings but rejects the notion of God. \[[sk](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&pg=PA258#v=onepage&q&f=false)\]
- Various other darshana-s suppose that an intelligent Ishvara created the universe.

## Whence creation and suffering
Whence creation? Whence suffering (negative experiences) in the world?

Some classic answers:

- 'तत्सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्' (तै. उ. २ । ६ । १)। "रसो वै सः। रसं ह्येवायं लब्ध्वा आनन्दी भवति ।"  - तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् २-७-२।
- "कुतो जगत्सृष्टिर्? इति प्रश्नस्योत्तरमत्र निहितं स्यात् - वीरशृङ्गारादीनाम् अनुभूतिरन्यथा कथं स्यात्? क्व च वीर्यम् भीतिं विना, क्व रामो रावणं विना? (कुतो ऽसृजल् लोके दुःखम् इत्य् आक्षेपस्याप्य् अत्रैव लभे समाधानम्॥)"
- "Emotions are not positive or negative, they are only strong or mild. Like vibrations. We may pay for some and some may kill us." - shrI sthAneshvara

### Compassion
Is the creator not compassionate to suffering? Classic answers:

- For those who want to exit the game and reunite with him, he offers a way out.
- For those who want material needs satisfied - there is the law of karma, subject to which he helps or not.
