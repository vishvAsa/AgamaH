> "mano [ha vai] devA manuShyasya+AjAnanti |"

A vedic saying from the shatapatha brAhmaNa which appears in the AV as:  

> manasA saM kalpayati tad devAM api gachChati |

To us, this has philosophical implications (especially for polytheists like us).  
As per the theory of the SYVs this cognition is passed to gods by tanU napAt manifesting as the metabolism comprised of prANa and udAna.  
So the gods do not precognize but the thought reaches them post-facto via an effect on metabolism.
