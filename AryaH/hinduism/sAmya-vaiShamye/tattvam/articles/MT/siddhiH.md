While mantra-practicing yogin-s can attain several siddhi-s they are a rare minority. The attainment of siddhi of several mantra-s, especially of the shaiva & its derivative shAkta tradition are not easy for solitary sAdhaka despite having the predisposition & devoted practice. They usually need the "chakra" of sAdhaka-s for proper expression and may be seen only within that context. Many modern aspirants miss this aspect and hope they can attain these in isolation.

## Time
For one man, it took 10 years to achieve the siddhi after being initiated by someone reputed to be one of the most accomplished guru-s in jambudvIpa. The other man, laboring sincerely in j~nAna, and grasping the siddhAnta, has practiced for 35.5 years, but the same siddhi seems to get only farther away from him; yet, he has not given up and labors on.  Maybe that's why H say for some, it might take more than one life.

A kR^iShNa practitioner of haThayoga felt he is acquiring some lower(?) siddhi after several years of practice. He claims to have gained some degree of dUradR^iShTi and dUrAnubhuti. He said he was studying Skt to study authoritative haThayoga texts. He was wondering why modern "gooroo-s" look down upon siddhi-s. Should siddhi-s not be one of the main objectives of yoga? I told him his thinking was right. 

Early haThayoga and other yoga traditions did emphasize siddhi-s. siddhi-s typically take an enormous amount of time -- if that is their goal, people might give up on yoga and forfeit its other benefits due to lack of success. For most common people, attaining siddhi-s is a distant goal, making it hard to keep as a motivation for any practice.
