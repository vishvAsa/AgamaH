While mantra-practicing yogin-s can attain several siddhi-s they are a rare minority. The attainment of siddhi of several mantra-s, especially of the shaiva & its derivative shAkta tradition are not easy for solitary sAdhaka despite having the predisposition & devoted practice. They usually need the "chakra" of sAdhaka-s for proper expression and may be seen only within that context. Many modern aspirants miss this aspect and hope they can attain these in isolation.

## Time
For one man, it took 10 years to achieve the siddhi after being initiated by someone reputed to be one of the most accomplished guru-s in jambudvIpa. The other man, laboring sincerely in j~nAna, and grasping the siddhAnta, has practiced for 35.5 years, but the same siddhi seems to get only farther away from him; yet, he has not given up and labors on.  Maybe that's why H say for some, it might take more than one life.
