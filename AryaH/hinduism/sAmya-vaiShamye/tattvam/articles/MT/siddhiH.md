While mantra-practicing yogin-s can attain several siddhi-s they are a rare minority. The attainment of siddhi of several mantra-s, especially of the shaiva& its derivative shAkta tradition are not easy for solitary sAdhaka despite having the predisposition & devoted practice. They usually need the "chakra" of sAdhaka-s for proper expression and may be seen only within that context. Many modern aspirants miss this aspect and hope they can attain these in isolation.
