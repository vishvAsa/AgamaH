## trivarga - The triplet

The following purushArtha-s are suggested in early texts (especially the niiti-shAstra-s), and they are very well motivated (See shatAvadhAnI gaNesha's explanation - [IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/foundations-of-hinduism/)). They offer an excellent conceptual framework to view and prioritize our motives and goals in this world (for example some of us keep detailed lists of our goals categorized under these heads).   

- kaama: We want to have fun and be happy. (Of course, we can do that in the pursuit of dharma and artha, but this category excludes those.) That is kaama.
- dharma:
    - To do dharma (धारणात् धर्म इत्याहुः - धर्मो धारयते प्रजाः -mbh) is to something directly for the good of other beings (or groups thereof).
    - This feeling is innate to us, and essential for our survival - otherwise, our desires will ensure that we destroy each other. It is always a compromise (we'd rather continue with our kaama.)
    - Plus, dharma increases our group fitness. Since memes are seen as being carried within groups rather than individuals, "group selction" applies.
    - Traditionally, the other two puruShArtha-s are followed in a way as to not conflict with dharma. (eg. manu and medhAtithi [here](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc200281.html))
    - Eg: Donating money, Punishing a murderer, providing for one's family. 
    - Details [here](../../social-cultivation/dharma/).
- artha: artha is accumulation of wealth, power, knowledge etc.. For example, to accomplish dharma: wealth to give others, power to punish, knowledge to guide; Or for kaama.

The above 3 seem to encompass the universe of everything we do (barring moxa - considered below), and furthermore, they seem disjoint the way they are defined above.  

## kAma unopposed to dharma
The influence of (vedantic / yogic) asceticism or occidental condition causes many modern hindus to be guilty about kAma pursuit. However, this is not a healthy attitude. For example, see the example of sexual intercourse below.

### Intercourse / सम्भोगे
- Injunctions like AshvalAyana's “ऋतौ भार्यामुपेयात्” make it clear that a gRhastha is *required* to have sex with his wife during every fertile period. 
- Some people may worry - "how to prevent the slippery slope to hedonism". However, one can safely trust the sages and well established shAstra-s. If one cites the shAstra-s to have sex often, one should also observe the required fasts and rituals (eg maintain agni etc..) enjoined by the same shAstra-s.
- The vedAntin curailment/ ideal (consistent with their general nivRtti) is: "लोके व्यवायामिषमध्यसेव नित्या हि जन्तोर्न हि तत्र चोदना । व्यवस्थितिस्तेषु विवाहयज्ञ सुराग्रहैरासु निव्त्तिरिष्टा ॥".

## Spiritual highs
One needs joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various [goals of life](/), including [dharma](../../social-cultivation/dharma/). Spirituality (a focus on the development and maintenance of "good" mental states) is then an essential component of hindu self cultivation.

Secular/ spiritual non-separation: See [here](../../rivals/abe-disease/0-theism/secularism/).

### Mysticism does not imply goodness

It must be noted that mysticism and ability to achieve mystic highs do not necessarily imply goodness:

- muhammad was a mystic, so were sufis of the type described [here](http://www.chakranews.com/beauty-and-the-beast-of-sufism/2454). 
- mahAyAna rebellion of 515 China \[[IMG](https://i.imgur.com/Ps9LX8J.png)\], where the doctrine seemed to include: "kill 10 enemies and become a 10th stage bodhisattva; kill all monks in captured monasteries" etc..
- Many villains in hindu mythology - rAvaNa to narakAsura - were accomplished [sAdhaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhaka)-s.

All sAdhaka-s (mystics) don't necessarily follow the same dharma shAstra (moral code); and they don't necessarily "transcend" the moral codes of their culture. Rather, their sAdhana gives them the strength to pursue what they consider "good and proper behavior" with an unusually great zeal. So, just as it is possible for the vAmAchArin who has discarded social rules to steal and eat parts of burning corpses, it is possible for the sufi to have great mystical experiences, and be a temple destroying zealot.

आवेशावस्थायां जनः स्खलतीत्यत्र केषाञ्चन पद्यानि प्रमाणम् - तत्र छन्दोभ्रंशः, व्याकरणदोषा यथा दृश्यन्ते।

### mokSha

- [mOkSha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha): Pursuit of enjoyment through kaama is, in the end, unsatisfactorily riddled with compromises due to limited artha (eg: wealth) and the need for dharma (accommodation for the well being of others). So, the ancients sought something beyond dharma/ artha/ kaama. They sought a path towards the ultimate joy (Ananda). This objective was popularized in later texts.
    - One feels the need to transcend the many masks/ roles one dons in this world (father, servant, scholar etc..), except that one feels that this needs to be done in the spirit of "being in the world, but not of the world". This mildly insulates us from upheavals of life, while still letting us enjoy it even more - like a person performing in a drama.
    - " mokSha or some equivalent thereof acquired greater importance in the brahmasUtra tradition and its successors. In the heterodox nAstika phase of nirgrantha &the tathAgata, a substitute for the same was proposed. What we see is by this time a synthesis was attempted."

#### The nature of the end goal
- For some, this goal was other-worldly - eg: eternal union with the paramAtmA after leaving the body (-- I consider this goal ill-founded, having rejected the [sUkShma-sharIr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtle_body)a and [karman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) as described earlier).
- But this is not always the case, some defined a different, long lasting state of mind - while living - as being an intermediate goal of moxa-type pursuit - there are those that seek extraordinary control of oneself - or even perfect understanding of everything (in a very analytical sense, like the vaisheShika-s did, without necessarily transcending categories).

#### kramamukti
> "kramamukti has its shrutipramANa in chandogyopaniSat, where one attains hiraNyagarbha/kAryabrahma and then attains mukti from that loka without returning to earth. Since, this is different from the mukti “unveiled” (not attained in advaita) by aparokSa-jñāna from vedānta-mahāvākyas & is rather unveiled stage by stage (path of devas—>hiraNyagarbhaH—>paramukti), that is, krama by krama; it is called kramamukti. kramamukti has its shrutipramANa in candogyopaniSat, where one attains hiraNyagarbha/kāryabrahma & then proceeds to realize mukti from that loka without returning to earth; at the time of mahāpralaya. This is also confirmed in kūrma-purANam. matsyapurANa ityādi have some vratas, explicitly mentioning kramamukti as the fruit. The purANas also mention bhakti towards śiva & viSNu as leading men of all varNas as well as women to mukti. varāha-purANa mentions the bhāgavata-dIkSA for all including caturthas. śivapurANa mentions japa of saumya-pañcākSari as well as dIkSA for all varNas. In all these examples, the fruit of no-return & eventual mukti is stated for one who properly does bhakti."

## Impact of mortality, impermanence

- Bodies die. Societies die. Entire species die. Planets become uninhabitable. Universe will die too.
- How do we respond to this? We can't hope to extend our lives or the lives of our genes or the lives of our thoughts for ever. We can only try to ensure that while we (as individuals, societies or cultures) live, we live gloriously.
