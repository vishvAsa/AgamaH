- "dharma" among hindus came forth as dharmashAstra in reaction to the "dharmas" of nAstikas around 350BCE .
  - "pAshaNDa" cults of ashokan edicts and kauTilya-artha-shAstra include ajIvakas, jainas, bauddhas, brAhmaNas
  - gRhastha contrasts with pravrAjaka (with some tension harmonized by Ashrama-system); is a religious person. The former term seems to have been motivated by prAkRta parallels. gRhapati and gRhapatnI were used earlier - and replaced in later works. The replacement stems from a slight semantic shift.
- Apastamba, gautama, baudhAyana, vasiShTha sUtras appeared first, in that chronological order.
  - "dvija" (in social sense) is absent in Apastamba as well as in patanjali-mahAbhASHya. Appears first in gautama sUtra (~200 BCE).
- manusmRti - 0-200 CE.
  - Had kauTilya-artha-shAstra for legal and procedural elements.
  - Introduced moxa.
  - Heavily influenced later writers.
- yAjJNavalkya-smRti (300-400 CE), eastern India, gupta patronage.
  - 9CE vishvarUpa commentary rescension closer to original. 13CE vijnAneshvara commentary rescension more emended.
  - Much versification of kauTilya-artha-shAstra.
  - Several advancments over manu
    - lekhya - documents
    - divya ordeals
    - appeals procedure.
- Other smRtis 
  - viShNu (6th CE kAshmIra).
    - anugamana.
    - Temple and image worship - pAncharAtra background.
  - nArada, parAshara.
- Compositions ended by ~750CE. 90% dharmashAstra manuscripts lost. sangrahas and nibandhas came to eclipse them.
- sangraha-period. Canons of 24 or 36 texts were created. Heavy on AchAra-s and prAyashcittas.
  - purANa-s were not initially considered dharmashAstra-proper. Early commentators like bhAruchi don't quote from them. yAdavaprakAsha explicitly excludes them in his work. Later works (post 11th CE) quote them regarding topics not covered in dharmashAstra - extra shrAddhas.  
- nibandhas.
  - 13CE कृत्यकल्पतरु
  - प्रतिष्ठाकाण्ड, तीर्थकाण्ड, व्रतकाण्ड
- Practice
  - vyavahAra-sections - more used as jurisprudence than simple "law book".
