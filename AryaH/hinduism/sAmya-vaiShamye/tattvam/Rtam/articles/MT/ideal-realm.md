## Paradoxes
The Banach-Tarski paradox is something that can be understood by a mathematical layman as a real thing in the Platonic realm. It is If an educated layperson is asked why it doesn't apply in the real world he would say infinities don't belong to the real world. More specifically one might add that the ultimate quantum of length is Planck's length so one cannot really apply the operations needed to establish B-T in the real world. Thus, one may ask if paradoxes like this raise questions about the relationship between the Platonic and real realms.
