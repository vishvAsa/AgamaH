      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my own research, I have found it rewarding to think of rta- as meaning something like &amp;ldquo;(original) deed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;precedent&amp;rdquo; which is a model for emulation, a kind of cosmogonic blue print. That is what allows rta- in the plural to reverse to verses, they are the original speech act (sūkta) that the community attributes to a legendary or primordial figure. In mind it is why rtāvan- has that long ā, its an aluksamāsa. In the single, the term is reified to &amp;rsquo;the Precedent&amp;rsquo; the primordial first motion which creates and structures the universe (varies but it is very often the opening of Vala cave, elsewhere the defeat of Father Asura/Vrtra) and sets it in motion. This is why the ritual must align with rta, by re-creating these original deeds or cosmogonic precedents, the year is restored to its pristine condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
