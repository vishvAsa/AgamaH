## The web of connections

- Humans are embedded in an intricate, interconnected, interdependent system. There is a continuity between man and nature. Hindu traditions emphasize this interconnected nature, so that a hindu understands this network not just intellectually, but also in the world of feelings.

## Presentations
This has been variously presented in the tradition - Rta, dharma, yajna.

Other traditions - nagAre in shinTo.

## Rta
- Rta (divine order in the universe), whose keeper is varuNa. (gaNesha [here](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).)

### Ideal realm
- Rta is thought to be ultimately mathematical in nature. Its ultimate form is algebra (seen in natural laws of science expressed as symbol-relationships) which determines the functioning of the real world. \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/syllable-number-and-rules-in-the-ideal-realm/)\]
- Compare with [platonism](/AgamaH/AryaH/mediterranian/platonism) of the yavanas.

  yasmin devā adhi viśve niṣeduḥ |  
  yas tan na veda kim ṛcā kariṣyati  
  ya it tad vidus ta ime sam āsate | RV 1.164.39


## The motif of yajna
- The offering of soma into agni during a yAga is representative of reciprocal connections between the sacrificer (yajamAna) and the deity; between the consumed and the consumer in a cycle of consumption and offering. It is symbolic of all sorts of events: from creation to destruction. This symbolism has been made explicit in several places.
    - panchAgnihotra-vidyA presented in chAndogya (6th chapter) and bRhadAraNyaka (5th chapter) vividly represent each link in the (cloud > rain > crops > food > digestion > child-birth > death + cremation) cycle as a yajna, with different entities playing the roles of agni, soma, hotR, smoke, embers, sparks, phala.
    - 5 prANa-s of the human body are thus represented in the 4th prashna of prAshnOpaniShad, aitareya-upaniShad, taittarIya-brAhmaNa ("मानवशरीरे यज्ञोपचारः।"). The digestive fire is called jATarAgni.
- The act of yAga-s include cooperative participation from a variety of people, reminding and strengthening social connections.

### The notion of brahman
- Everything in the universe is said to be brahman by the many followers of the veda-s. brahman is said to be conscious and bliss in some schools of thought (eg: vedAnta).
- Consciousness of individual beings is hard to explain scientifically, and so some people have proposed a universal, fundamental aspect of nature (like space and time) as its source \[David Chalmers [YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhRhtFFhNzQ), [TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness/transcript?language=en), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/JLQ4iFT.png)\].

### "Body part" representations

Representation of various parts of the nature (including various social constructs) as having originated in (and being various parts of) the same primodial person (puruSha). \[puruSha-sUkta, \]
    - Hindu origin stories espouse either the manifestation of the single underlying spirit in many forms, or a combination of male and female fundamental principles to generate all this diversity.
    - There are similarly various other personifications (kAvya-puruSha in kAvyamImAMsA, sangIta-puruSha, vAstu-puruSha, loka-puruSha, devasthAna-puruSha, yajna-puruSha).

### Nature
- One can observe close connection to nature in a variety of Hindu concepts.
  - Examples
      - Bird songs, whale songs and sAmans: Neural convergence in animals or imitation? [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/02/19/mental-and-neural-convergence/)
      - The varNa system.
- That said, some refinement (saMskRti) is applied to the natural state of affairs (prakRti) to enhance effectiveness and good feeling. saMskRti is not opposite to prakRti - it attempts to capture the beneficial essentials.
