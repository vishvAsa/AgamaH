## shabda-brahma-darshana
- Basic Sastra on Sabda Brahma Darśana - vākyapadīyam. This tells us how the world came into being as per Vyakaraṇa Darśana.
- Śabdabrahma is Cetana and Source of all. 

अनादिनिधनं ब्रह्म  
शब्दतत्त्वं यदक्षरम्।  
विवर्ततेऽर्थभावेन  
प्रकृया जगतो यतः॥

- The use of grammatically correct word only is Dharma (that way you connect to shabda-brahma). Impure Apabhraṁśa word also gives meaning; however, its use is Adharma.

Sanskrit phonetic alphabet is very scientific - wrt sthAna, prayatna etc. progression. 

## Cross modal association 
- any object that comes into your sensory field of perception triggers multiple associated [[20:08]] senses
- vowels and colors - people with different language backgrounds - certain vowels were associated with certain colors
  - paper where the strong associations were found between ah and red, e with light colors, ooh with dark color
- certain sounds were associated with being like large
- certain sounds were more associated with certain emotions like fear or pleasure
- pitch effect
  - high [[21:02]] pitch eliciting lighter color
- shape association 
  - bauba kiki experiment

This is seen in bīja-mantras.

## mātr̥kā
- kāmadhēnutantram - Very important in use of bīja-s in mantra-sādhanā. 
- rudrayāmala-tantram → anuttaratattva, vijñānabhairava → parātriṁśikā → vivaraṇam (abhinavagupta)

### Philosophy
abhinavagupta: parā-paśyantī = r̥tambhara-prajñā. akṣarabrahma is outcome of parāvāk = saṁvit (essence of pāramēśvarī parā bhaṭṭārikā, anuttara-śakti beyond space-time).  

anuttara-tattva → paramakaulāvasthā (never discussed publicly; abhinava gives indications only) → śāntāvasthā → ichchā-śakti (want to appear as a word) → paśyantī (all śāstra-s appear) → madhyamā → vaikharī (all letters of mātr̥kā are distinct)

akula = shiva, kula = shakti.  
mahāmāhēśvara - Realization in visargabhūmī, anuttara state - shiva and shakti are one. 


### स्वराः
स्वराः - शिवः, तिथयो ऽपि।

- The Vowels have liquid nature, wherever they go they change as per the consonant. Hence, they are called as Vīrya.

- अ - अनुत्तरा। 
  
५ कृत्यानि 

- आ - आनन्दः। शक्तिर् उदिता। 
- इ - इच्छा। सिसृक्षा। 
- ई - ईषद् इच्छा।

- ऋ - (← इच्छा + ईषदिच्छा + अनुत्तरा-**तेजः**)। अत्रेषदिच्छातत्त्वम् अप्य् अस्ति, तेजो ऽपि। 
- ॠ - (← इच्छा + ईषदिच्छा + आनन्द-**तेजः**)
- ऌ - (← इच्छा + ईषदिच्छा + अनुत्तरा-**स्थिरता**)। बगलामुख्या मन्त्रे - माया + स्थिरम् = स्थिरमायबीजम्। 
- ॡ - (← इच्छा + ईषदिच्छा + आनन्द-**स्थिरता**)



- ए = अ + इ। क्रियाशक्तिः। शिव-त्रिकोणं लिप्या। 
- ऐ =  शिव-त्रिकोणं (ए) + शक्ति-त्रिकोणम् = षडरम् ।  
- ओ = अ + उ । 
- औ = आ + उ । त्रिक-त्रिशूलम्। चतुर्दशी। 
- अं = बिन्दुः। 
- अः = अनुच्चार्यम्। रहस्यचर्याङ्गम् - न सार्वजनिकम्। लिपौ बिन्दू - शाम्भव-विलासः, शाक्तविलासः।

#### श्रीयन्त्र-मातृका-चक्रम्
From mātr̥kā-cakra-vivēka . svatantrānandanātha

māṭrā-s divided into 5 states- jāgr̥ta, svapna, suṣupti, turīya, turīyātīta. 

- Caturdaśāra : Letters from a up to au.
- Śoḍaśāra: This has letters from a up to au along with bindu aṁ and visarga aḥ.
- Daśāra Dvaya: Ka - class, Ca - class, Ṭa - Class and Ta - Class.
- Daśāra Dvaya bahya Catuṣkoṇa - Pa, Pha, Ba, Bha and Ma.
- Aśṭāra - Ya, Ra, La and Va and Śa, Șa, Sa and Ha.
- Trikona - Ma
- Bindu Kṣa

### mātr̥kā-raśmī
- Śrividyarṇava Tantram Uttarārdha 20th Śvāsa
- The Mantra, Yantra and Devata shall be known as per the Rasmi Krama of Mantras.
- Each vowel and consonant has six rasmis of Jala, Vayu, Teja, Akāśa, Nabha and Manasa.
- In Kādi Krama - The vowels and consonants have different rasmis as per different āmnaya.
  - In Dakṣināmnaya has krama of four only Vayu, Teja, Jala and Prthvi.
- In Kali Krama there is no Amnaya bheda.
  - no mānasa raśmi.
- Write vowels and consonants of Mantras
  separately then write the number of Rasmis. Add the rasmis of six sections separately. The same is used to realize the Mantra, Yantra and Devatā.


The Calculation to Assess Mahavidyā Tattva of Mantra

Each Kalā of Kalāpañcaka originated from the mouth of Īsāna has 320 rays. Mantra has 68 letters, multiply it with the 32 Manasa rays and divide the same by all Manasa rays (1600 Manasa rays of Brahmarandhra) the resultant of it would produce the Mantra and its Cchanda, the resultant of this calculation only is known as Mahavidyā. The one who is desirous of accomplishments must know them at minute to minute level!!!

Śrīvidyaranya Yati further explains, “Multiply 32 with total number of letters of Mantra. Multiply each consonant and vowel of the Mantra with 32. Then divide them with Pūrṇa Mānasa rays (1600). If the resultant is above 26 then divide it with 26 again. The resultant of the same is known as the Cchanda of Mantra. If resultant is 576 then the Mantra is Mahavidyā if it is a bit less or a bit above then also it is Mahavidyā."


### mālinī

When the vowels and consonants come together the system agitates and the due sequence of Matrka breaks.

न ऋ ऋ ऌ ॡ थ च ध ई ण उ ऊ ब क ख ग  
घ ङ इ अ व भ य ड ढ ठ झ ञ ज र ट प छ ल  
आ स अः ह ष क्ष म श अं त ए ऐ ओ औ द फ

These rise due to union of Bīja and Yoni which causes the quivering of Visarga is determined as Mālinī Śakti-

बीजयोनिसमापत्तिविसर्गोदयसुन्दरा ।  
मालिनी हि परा शक्तिर्निर्णिता विश्वरूपिणी ॥ २३३ ॥

They are Śakti of Rudra which possesses both Bhoga and Mokṣa:

मालिनी मलिता रुद्रैर्धारिका सिद्धिमोक्षयोः ॥१३१॥  
फलेषु पुष्पिता पूज्या संहार-ध्वनि-षट्पदी..   
संहार-दानादि-शक्ति-युक्ता यतो रलौ ॥ १३२ ॥

#### Utility
If in case there is any disruption in Vidhi, there is any disruption in Mantra Virya or if in case any other type of nyasa is done which is out of our Tantra then while doing nyasa with it the mistake is corrected:

तेन भ्रष्ट विधौ वीर्ये स्वरूपे वान्या परम् ॥१३४॥  
मन्त्रा न्यस्ताः पुनर्न्यासात्पूर्यन्ते तत्फलप्रदाः ।

As per Śrī Mālinīvijaoyttara Tantra if in case any specific Vidihi is missed out due to some reason then Mālini Nyasa covers that loss:

उक्तं श्रीपूर्वतन्त्रे च विशेषविधिहीनिते ॥ १३५ ॥  
न्यसेच्छक्तिशरीरार्थं भिन्नयोनिं तु मालिनीं ।  
विशेषणमिदं हेतौ हेत्वर्थश्च निरूपितः ॥ १३६ ॥  
यथेष्टफलसिद्ध्यै चेत्यत्रैवेदमभाषत ।

The secondary Mantras also become full of virile like Siddha Mantras when Malini Nyasa is done:

साजना अपि ये मन्त्रा गारुडाद्या न तो परम् ॥१३७॥  
मालिन्या पूरिताः सिद्ध्यैः बलादेव तु मुक्तये।


## Mahātripura-Sundari
- She is Sri Madhyacakranilaya.
- As she keeps Kşa and Ma within her where Kṣa is Śiva the Tūrīya state and Jīva is Ma from whom the Svapna states are represented, she is Kṣamātmānginī. she only is Turyātīta Daśā.
- Her four arms represent Jāgrata, Svapna, Suşupti and Turya.

- Ikṣucāpa (Sugarcane Bow): As sugarcane has sweet juice and as Susupti too is like juice as it is stage of repose, it is Susupti.
- Puspa Bāṇa: The Prapanca happens in Jagrata. Its main business is to fascinate.
- Pāśa: As the Svapna stage is illusive by nature and Jiva perceives the Bhedabheda in this stage.
- Ankusa: Jñānātamka Sadasiva. He is Turya. The way a giant animal elephant is controlled by Ankuśa same way Mahāpaśu Caitya is controlled by Sadasiva.


## Varṇa-Cakra
Śrī Varṇa Cakra (Pāñcarātra Āgama, sāttvata-saṁhitā Based)  

- Varṇādhvā is Śabda Brahma.
  - Śabda flowing as water stream of the form of various Varṇa is Varṇa Adhvā.

- Sadhaka does Bhāvanā of each Murtis like Vāsudeva etc. in the form of Viśrāma, Udaya, Vyāpti and Vyakti.
  - Viśrama Varṇa are at Parā stage, Udaya is Paśyantī, Vyāpti is Madhyma and Vyakti is Vaikhari.
  - There are further divisions of Varṇa also which is based on Jagrata, Svapna, Susupti and Tūriya. 
  
There are two kinds of Varṇa Cakra.

- First one is for Uddhāra of Para and Vyūha Mantra.
- Second one is for Vibhava (Avatara Devatā) Mantras.

- The way Śabdabrahma comes down from Para, Pasyanti, Madhyamā and Vaikharī same way Varṇacakra is divided into Amala, Santa, Śantodita and Udita.

## Transcript

so today the discussion is primarily [[6:09]] based upon how a mantra works [[6:14]] how it originates and then how does it work so what are the basic principles behind it so the fact is that when we [[6:22]] talk about mantra standard mantraly so the standard mantra are in sanskrit okay so there are there are two streams [[6:30]] which talk about uh sanskrit uh this lexicography whatever [[6:36]] means formation of sentences one is background based and another is tantra based [[6:41]] so before we enter in tantra exactly as to what tantra says about origin of mantras etc we shall i think [[6:49]] it is our personal miss dr saban we have personal thought upon this thing that we shall first of all [[6:55]] uh understand that what is the concept of upon formation of sentences so in [[7:02]] vikkaran there are various scriptures which talk about uh this origin of word etc but [[7:09]] and is one of his very important scripture i would not say [[7:14]] that supreme but it is very important scripture this vacation is ascribed to uh bharathi hariji and this scripture is [[7:21]] divided into three parts [[7:28]] he talks about about the brahmana [[7:33]] bharti talks about the brahma so what does it what does he say basically [[7:39]] so he says that in order to if suppose we want to denote [[7:46]] something or tell about or represent something or address something that shall be addressed in correct grammar this is [[7:53]] basic principle of sanskrit grammar maharshi patanjali [[8:01]] that if you speak appropriately as per correctly as per grammar for example if suppose a shakti [[8:07]] is there the shakti must be called as shakti only so that is dharma when you represent it [[8:15]] as per correct grammar then that is otherwise if you do not represent it correctly so or in some way maybe some [[8:23]] in other language sharper languages they are called so in those languages then maybe you may be able to understand that [[8:30]] what what you want to apprehend but the thing is that would not be correct and that would be other [[8:37]] now why is it so so the fact is that it says that [[8:43]] shut the brahman which of the in itself is a brahma so that is paraphrasanti stage [[8:51]] in that stage what happens is that subthe brahma comprises of all the [[8:57]] all the essences of this word not only objective and but subjective also like if say suppose we say [[9:16]] these are these are not objective they are they are feeling based [[9:23]] so in in that case all the essence of the being existence of all [[9:30]] these attributes of this creation are present in the brahman sabda brahma okay [[9:38]] so if we move to next slide principle okay so the same thing is [[9:45]] mentioned in the principle of origin of [[9:59]] and what does it mean it says that is beyond birth and death so brahma [[10:05]] anyways is beyond birth and that so that is uh a primary attribute of brahma even if [[10:12]] you say brahma is an ah nirvana so that nirvana also has one bone at least and that is he is beyond his eternal [[10:21]] mirror eternal he is beyond life and death so this quality at least exists in means [[10:27]] this is eternal means most important quality and most [[10:32]] must have quality of brahma so brahma is beyond life and death and he deliberates himself as akshar in [[10:39]] viver manners what is vivar means something which is not real when [[10:45]] evolves from such is viva basically follows [[10:51]] where it is said that origin only evolves from so we will see all that later on when we [[10:56]] will discuss about when we will discuss about this thing so it says that [[11:02]] only is responsible for processes of creation operation and destruction of [[11:07]] this world so how does it happen so that then there are various other [[11:18]] so so many things are there various concepts are there but the discussion is it's a long discussion and we have to [[11:25]] take up various topics so we will directly focus on how earth how happens [[11:30]] so we will move on to next slide here we see [[11:36]] super pronounced but we say oh we take home here so when we say [[11:43]] when mandir when mandir [[11:48]] uh the mandir evolves uh from that shepherd brahma comprises of all [[11:54]] the optimum means are subjective and objective existence of this world so when the mandir [[12:00]] is uttered when mandir happens in this space then mandir comes [[12:05]] into being his earth about that that becomes that materializes in the form of mandir similarly when gow is [[12:12]] said then cow [Music] is materialized [[12:17]] and in reverse we will go if suppose we go in reverse direction we say that cow [[12:22]] would [[12:30]] so that that is the concept of this brahma means everything evolves from him [[12:35]] and dissolves in him because all the existence of this word are [[12:41]] exist in this shabda brahma only so this is the basic principle why one shall use [[12:47]] proper and correct grammar that is as per grammarians so why they say [[12:54]] so is that uh because if suppose cow has come into being so cow would again [[13:01]] from where it has come there only it would go so they give an example of means you suppose a golden bangle [[13:08]] you you have a golden bengal it is made up of gold when you will uh means uh [[13:14]] scotland means meaning will you melt the gold bangle it will again become gold [[13:19]] the same way whatever exists in this world in the end that would dissolve in [[13:26]] the so by practicing the correct grammar [[13:31]] we will follow [[13:38]] that is their concept that is the concept of vikram now the thing is i have given objective existence example [[13:44]] only we can take example of means joy and sorrow also for example [[13:51]] and the then the feeling of sukh came into this world the important feeling of juke came into [[13:57]] world sheath top whatever means all the kind of feelings whatever feelings you have so [[14:03]] basically the word comprises of two things means that is objective existence means [[14:09]] objects materialistic what i'm talking ab and then otherwise there are feelings [[14:14]] attached to that object so it means the thing is you have suppose you owned any new object so you [[14:20]] have a feeling and suppose the object which you own is not up to your desire as per your desire you may feel [[14:26]] sorrow also or otherwise you are somewhere where are you wherever you are living here there's [[14:31]] also anything so the fact is that subjective and objective existence only make this materialistic world and they [[14:38]] evolve from this akshar brahma so while connecting with correct gram while using correct grammar we are able to connect [[14:45]] with the action grammar so now the fact is that which grammar is connected [[14:52]] in next slide only is considered as means correct and [[14:59]] all pervasive background so what is what it says the story behind [[15:04]] panini background is that maharishi patanjali oh sorry maharishi pannani did maintenance stuff of bhagavan shiv and [[15:10]] when bhagavan's you became pleased with him he started playing his damaru from that damaru some sutras evolved and [[15:17]] those supras are called as maheshwar sutras and by using by comprehending those [[15:23]] maheshwar maharishi patanjali created the grammar of sanskrit the next slide shows the [[15:29]] uh bhagavan shiva is playing in raj is playing bhagavan natasha is playing the damaru and [[15:36]] i would railric except i own i watch all these [[15:43]] so and then if you will see you believe such a hard concept is there so many concepts [[15:49]] and so so these i would really like if you will [[15:55]] comprehend these things you will find that my from this [[16:01]] matrix also can be comprehended so means reverse corollary also is there so [[16:07]] so many ways are there to comprehend because it's it's a long topic so we are not [[16:13]] entering into that so matrika sunset alphabets are also associated with this thing [[16:20]] so yes in the next slide we have show soon the division of vowels and consonants in the [[16:27]] next slide yeah swar and vengeance components of matrika [[16:32]] have been shown and this is the physical source of origin of vengeance in the next slide [[16:39]] you will see enough so there are passengers there are surprises of also that from which [[16:46]] they cover that way the supras are also [[17:12]] again that would be further beyond the scope topic so here some source of consonants have been [[17:20]] displayed in the diagram also [[17:25]] so you will see contour floating is shown here from here and covered [[17:36]] that way there so again in the next slide everything has been explained in detail it will go so it is shown from which [[17:42]] place which sound has evolved that way it is displayed here now doctor would like to explain [[17:49]] something on this i think yes uh so i think uh that was a very quick overview of the [[17:56]] standard shall we say the vyakaran and wikipedia view and [[18:01]] the division of the sanskrit alphabets as per the source of origin along the vocal tract [[18:09]] and you may think this is just a kind of a random way of classifying uh [[18:16]] alphabets but modern science has definitely given us evidence that [[18:21]] this form of classification which is kind of like this biological style of classification based on where [[18:28]] in your vocal tract the closure is made in order to generate that sound [[18:34]] is actually a very deep and meaningful classification at least as far as the organism is [[18:40]] concerned so this is a very complex slide the essence of this slide essentially is [[18:45]] that depending on where the phoneme is produced whether like throat or whether [[18:51]] it's like f or whatever there are differential activations that [[18:56]] can be seen in the brain now the shall we say the the the fine [[19:02]] fineness with which we can actually assess brain activity for such tasks is is still lacking in terms of [[19:10]] our technology but as our technology improves there is no doubt that we will be able to prove [[19:17]] that the brain itself reacts differently when producing and when hearing [[19:24]] um sounds made at these different parts of the vocal tract so these are very real distinctions not a kind of just [[19:32]] like somebody woke up one day and decided that this is a nice way to classify it so that is a important thing [[19:37]] to remember um and the subsequent [[19:43]] a kind of a corollary to that to the fact that where you make the closure in your vocal [[19:49]] tract is important in terms of which part of the vein is activated the corollary is that [[19:55]] because there is a phenomenon known as cross modal association which means that [[20:01]] any object that comes into your sensory field of perception triggers multiple associated [[20:08]] senses these particular kind of phonemes when [[20:14]] you know produced by closure at any one part of the vocal tract can be associated with [[20:19]] distinct uh shall we say hierarchies of other senses so there is this one paper which [[20:25]] came out a few years ago which is cross modal association between vowels and colors [[20:31]] so what does that mean essentially that across civilizations people with different language backgrounds [[20:37]] certain vowels were associated with certain colors and you know certain sounds were associated with being like large or [[20:44]] small certain sounds were more associated with certain emotions like fear or pleasure so here is uh kind of [[20:50]] what they found in this little paper where the strong associations were found between ah and red [[20:55]] e with light colors ooh with dark colors robust pitch effect was found with high [[21:02]] pitch eliciting lighter color so this is something you can even experiment on yourself like if something is like [[21:10]] and something is like the color that you associate with the first sound is usually more of a very [[21:17]] light color and the color that you will associate with the heavy [[21:23]] tone is usually going to be darker and larger and this is just one study multiple other studies have been done on this [[21:29]] topic this can be kind of tested once again and this is an actual scientific experiment that was [[21:36]] conducted by the famous neurologist vs ramachandran if i gave you these two [[21:41]] pictures and i told you one of these pictures is named kiki and the other one [[21:47]] is named bauba i think most of us are going to say this [[21:53]] sharp jagged one is the key and this kind of balloon-like one is the bauba [[21:58]] now what is interesting is that when they gave the same test to people like you [[22:04]] know like tamil people english people in america people living in some remote pacific [[22:10]] islands who don't have any exposure to you know geometry or photographs almost all of them the majority of them [[22:16]] would pick kiki to be the sharp shape and baubar to be the balloon-like shape there is no rational reason that you can [[22:24]] explain why your brain chooses the sound to match with this shape and [[22:29]] the other sound to match with that shape the reason is because when you hear a sound or you see a [[22:35]] picture or you smell a smell there are multiple sensations being triggered [[22:41]] although most of them are happening beneath your perception like they are subconsciously being triggered [[22:47]] and although your brain is kind of perceiving all that information you as an individual you cannot consciously [[22:53]] report it so that's what is meant by these cross modal associations and it's something [[22:59]] that is going to be a important topic of research in the years to come um [[23:05]] now given that suppose we evaluate this wonderful statement [[23:12]] that uh i read on an article by this wonderful young scholar named shankar bharadwaj [[23:19]] the qualities of a devda can be seen from the bijas of the devda bhija meaning the bhija mantra [[23:26]] for instance bhavaneshwari is one of the most pleasant forms of punishment is a form of devi [[23:32]] this is because bhuvaneshwari beach mantra has maya bhija and maya corresponds to anandamaya kosh [[23:40]] she is bound to be a personification of bliss so if you kind of put this [[23:47]] like two and two together with this slide and the previous few slides it clearly tells you that when you think [[23:54]] of a devta and you think of a mantra that's associated with them it's not a random [[23:59]] uh kind of people didn't just pull it out of thin air and you know made you mug it up and regurgitated [[24:05]] there is something very deep going on beneath the surface which only a few people who have the [[24:12]] necessary training of their brains can appreciate and so that science is explained [[24:20]] in the tantrica outlook of the matrikas the matrikas being of course the [[24:26]] the alphabets as we mentioned and i can give you a few examples of how [[24:31]] the alphabets of the sanskrit alphabet have kind of played an important role in [[24:36]] tantra and they continue to play an important role in our temples today for example this is [[24:42]] a picture of the ceiling of the har siddhi mata temple in ujjain [[24:48]] very famous temple you see here very closely if you look on the roof you [[24:54]] can see the alphabets of sanskrit are written right there now you know a normal person modern [[25:00]] person who thinks sanskrit is a dead language they'll be like okay so what like sanskrit is a language just like any other language english or you know [[25:06]] french or whatever but as you can see here there's a very deep connection that people have always realized between [[25:13]] the language the alphabets and the deities and the religion itself [[25:20]] similarly this is uh what is called the akshara pitham depiction of devda from uh this is [[25:27]] actually a namagiri tayar which is uh in tamil nadu and this is surrounded by the [[25:34]] alphabets and interestingly enough um namigrit is also the devi uh form of [[25:40]] lakshmi i believe who visited ramanujam in his dreams and gave him the mathematical formulas so there [[25:46]] is both the tamir alphabets and the alphabet which are essentially the same sounds [[25:52]] just written in a slightly different way so [[25:58]] what was the tantric understanding of the sanskrit alphabet [[26:03]] and why was it important so important that people put it up on the roofs of their temple so important that the great [[26:10]] rishis and sages put it up around the pictures of their devise these are all basically um [[26:16]] meant for dhyana and meditation purposes so so important was the alphabet to them that [[26:21]] they put this right around the devi icon itself so to go into all that mishraji [[26:28]] will now tell us more about the tantrika outlook of the matrikas yeah sure [[26:34]] before i start with this slide i would like to uh appraise our audiences that just now [[26:41]] raksha has shown us a slide of shihar chiddhi devi mandir and you would you might have seen akshay's men's matrika [[26:47]] is mentioned on the ceiling and with pictures also of devi so [[26:58]] associated with every single letter is depicted there and in a previous [[27:03]] slide also that [Music] [[27:19]] in mantra sadhana and how beast mantra actually acts that is explained in kambhanutantram so now [[27:26]] we would take up from the side slide matrika the tantric outlook [[27:32]] so [[27:59]] which is taken from [[28:15]] scripture he has explained all these things only in extremely intricate and lucid commentary [[28:23]] so there he says that para pasanti's stage which background cannot consider [[28:28]] as again i am not against any philosophy we are just taking up the various points we [[28:35]] are summing up various concepts so suppose someone says that he is so we are not against them we are just [[28:40]] telling that what different acharyas have their opinion okay so the fact is that in sri sri para mahamaya [[28:47]] venue says that it is the outcome of [[28:55]] he says that the parable [[29:18]] so as i mentioned earlier also that if someone this is very very basic quality which [[29:25]] brum owns and that is being beyond space and time means [[29:30]] and then all pervasive means [[29:37]] these three are very basic qualities which abram shall comprise so initially [[29:46]] beyond that there is also but parang shall never be discussed publicly even [[29:53]] like avenue also have not explained param wasan detail he has given [[29:58]] indications only regarding this for that and what he says he says that [[30:06]] this is results in the stage of [[30:13]] the stage then at some point when shakti does quote his uh means he [[30:20]] only actually there is nothing but shield so she himself becomes shakti so when he [[30:25]] becomes active so in that case what happens what happens in him and h [[30:32]] in him and then stage of ashanti evolves and that way again further he [[30:37]] in the past is the gray and grog means that it is the stage which is like uh which is like egg means [[30:45]] everything is there but that is inside that egg only nothing is uh nothing is [[30:50]] present outside all the all the differences are differences that come into being but they are not present [[30:57]] means at the level of deliberation so what happens is that [[31:02]] from that stage she she steps down to madima and then further is divided [[31:15]] that way and then further reform comes into being so [[31:20]] okay so the huh so the these matrika only have so at that level [[31:27]] matrices evolve actually matrikas evolve [[31:40]] [Music] [[31:51]] but she does not conceive anything because if she will conceive or something will go outside her body then there is nothing because there is [[31:57]] nothing outside her this entire world is manifestation of herself only she herself has become this world so she [[32:04]] becomes pregnant and she keeps everything within within herself only so that is why she earned their wish [[32:11]] vishwatar she only is [[32:17]] so that is the fact and there is one more fact here if i say that she went because here she is not kailash [[32:24]] and lives on kailash here is [[32:52]] that is something which is subject to realization no one can then can tell that where is mr bhumi people can mean [[32:58]] read book and then say okay it is so but that is actually that is a theoretical only practically that has to [[33:05]] be realized something which is related to realization so at wizard when you realize that shiva and shakti [[33:12]] both are one so that only is another stage and one who realizes that only is maha maheshwar so the fact is that that [[33:19]] accuracy is akul and shakti is [[33:33]] creation of this world he wants the word shall be created so that he may enjoy this is for his pleasure only this is [[33:39]] for his joy only he has made all of us this entire entire world for his pleasure only enjoy so the fact is that [[33:46]] for the sake of enjoyment of himself he himself becomes shakti and then when he becomes shakti at the stage of another [[33:53]] he will not do anything he will stay he will sit inert in an inert manner but when he will become [[33:59]] vishuru shakti i use he the fact is that he see it [[34:04]] these three words are not eligible to denote another one he is another is beyond he she is but we [[34:12]] have to give some we have to use somebody has given a very beautiful example he says that foreign [[34:20]] himalayan quartz but he says that spatik also cannot be the correct example to ano to do the [[34:27]] analogy of correct analogy of people but we have nothing more pure more [[34:32]] pure than this thing so that is why we use aspartic so that's why he is used but it is not that uh [[34:39]] of that essence that it can define so from he only becomes that thing and in that stage only all the matrix coming [[34:52]] later on first we will go to why this is called matrika [[34:57]] that is next to next slide [[35:14]] entire [[35:28]] so the fact is that by by realizing the matrix chakra by realizing the matrika checker in the [[35:35]] summit of one could be able to realize the shambo by so that is very basic very true [[35:40]] definition now if you say that how to do this so uh again this is not the forum [[35:45]] you know that he has explained everything know how to do it practices are also there but the forum [[35:52]] this forum cannot disturb those things because various restrictions so the basic [[36:29]] so so now the next slide we will say how the matrix originate so [[36:35]] there is there is a sutra okay [[36:42]] okay okay that comes later okay no issues so so the origin of math regards so the fact is [[37:24]] there is no difference between shivan he has very clearly mentioned good things so if suppose we are today's navratri so [[37:32]] if we say that i is a mohammed shakhtar [[37:49]] 12 letters represent the kramakali and and he gives kramen a scripture also that he gives he gives [[37:55]] some citation also in the same chamber he talks about all these things so the fact is that it depends upon you how you [[38:02]] take this if suppose you are a kali kramer you can say that this is on there [[38:11]] same thing has been explained mahatma [[38:19]] also the same thing has been expanded one who sits on the heart of sadashiv [[38:25]] is this that way that has been explained there so that another only becomes anand [[38:41]] that is very complicated thing is his shakti evolves in and then this joy happens and that joy is [[38:49]] represented by ah and that is called as anandi so the fact [[38:54]] is that first five vowels are ieee [[39:22]] so what will happen in in that case a desire evolves what is that desire he says that is [[39:30]] a very dim kind of desire it was that is to create something okay so that it has [[39:38]] that it is represented by e that is represented by e [[39:44]] when that becomes ishat means uh form [[39:50]] uh uh up to some level formidable so that is called as e b r e [[39:57]] and then when h had to create a wall then the gyan by which this hap could be fulfilled [[40:03]] evolves so that gyan is represented by who there are complex descriptions behind [[40:09]] origin of every single vowel and various i mean [[40:15]] so many so many pages have been written by siddhara so but because [[40:20]] that cannot be covered here so we are simply taking in this manner so he and then again when gyan [[40:28]] evolves and later on because shiva is moving from the stage of [[40:33]] another to vishwa and in vishwa he would become jeeve himself [[40:38]] so his gun starts acquiring limitations so [[40:43]] happens that is represented [[40:49]] now after that four visas there rig real rick these are called called as shunt beaches [[40:56]] avenue is called this and calls them amrit why he calls them so because they are inaudible [[41:06]] only they do not produce anything so that's why they are called as uh amrita beach so how they come into being [[41:13]] so when the cha cha shakti of permission both [[41:33]] and send the same way when it cha and isha collaborate [[41:39]] with means stability [[41:45]] attribute of another inherent [[41:52]] attribute of inherent attribute of stability of another anatomy [[41:58]] so you will see that lobbies is used in sri lanka [[42:31]] associates with that stability then lick evolves same way [[42:37]] so jana sanji also is there so we are not going to that details he explains all [[42:43]] these things are mentioned there but this way these four are evolved he says one thing that when they are shunned [[42:49]] because i tell you vowels are considered as shiva and consonants are considered as shakti [[42:57]] there is further description i am not using those words here because so many people are sitting here and everyone [[43:02]] shall not listen to raha terms that is restriction so one may say that [[43:08]] when they are shunned they are neither sure nor here so the fact is that they have some amount of ichat in them say [[43:16]] when you say so in that e sound is there that e sound [[43:22]] is there in this even though so they themselves are chanting but they have some amount of each other so [[43:28]] that is why they are kept in this sequence otherwise they would not be kept here [[43:34]] so because there's some amount of a child there so they are kept here then a is a evolves how a star evolves as [[43:42]] evolves [[43:47]] together happens similarly [[43:53]] when this is represented from okay so from here your kriya shakti evolution starts [[44:01]] it starts earlier also but the fact is problem because shunt is there so we will take from here [[44:20]] see that a triangle ah equilateral triangle kind of shape would be visible here it means exactly not but if you [[44:27]] will see it thoroughly you will find that there is equilateral triangle kind of shape is available here so that is [[44:32]] shift requirement when this shift record further [[44:41]] this a is quite esoteric in nature this is called a shutter [[44:46]] shutter shall not neither be explained publicly and it shall never be discussed publicly so what nacharya's have done [[44:53]] they have added another they have added a [[44:58]] tail also what cell what i'll say pony ponytail on the head of a so they have made it a it is represented [[45:05]] in that manner otherwise it is shutter the shield reconnaissance yes we have come together now after that [[45:12]] this associates with its own anand oh gyan [[45:18]] then okar evolves that is for the development of kriya that is for the development of kuya [[45:24]] and when anand associates with the same then how he was this only history [[45:41]] because these are 15 so these are cities also these are [[45:51]] so the fact is that this 14th city only is represented by [[45:58]] so in amrit beach this how only when so so when the diagram is made that when [[46:04]] that triangle is made then only is made of thick issue now what happens that this entire [[46:10]] dissolves in bindu and [[46:26]] it cannot be pronounced by anyone there is only one way by which it cannot it can be pronounced but uh again that is [[46:33]] related to the area that is something secret so we cannot discuss here so that ah [[46:38]] ah cannot be pronounced by any and even so and the upper [[46:52]] so this is this is this this is how this entire [[46:57]] vowels have come into being later on from these vowels only [[47:03]] cover the tower power etc evolve and then from these power chewers etc only [[47:11]] these consonants evolve so that description is already given there but the fact is that uh this again would [[47:17]] become something very complex thing so we will just take that from these [[47:23]] bubbles only these consonants have evolved now the fact is that in [[47:30]] the scripture which we have discussed the these in next slide you will see [[47:36]] that these vowels only are associated with 36th parts sokka represents praswitha and [[47:42]] represents shiva similarly all these sapphires represent all these all these all these [[47:49]] are represented by every single consonant now the fact is that these consonants are called as shakti and the [[47:55]] vowels are called as shiv when the shiv and shakti come together the word comes into being for example we suppose we [[48:02]] want to write shiva shiv mesha [[48:18]] and by [[48:25]] that is the concept of creation here up now in the next slide what you will [[48:31]] find it is it says that there are six principle wobbles [[48:36]] it says that there are six principles [[48:42]] these are the success of [[48:55]] so what is the fact it says that only the ah who are the source of origin of all the [[49:02]] this entire creation this entire creation is evolved from these six vowels only [[49:08]] now amongst these six the deer vowel means ah e means capital r capital e and [[49:14]] capital u d register are vogue means consumable and the small vowel [[49:22]] means consumers so when the consumer consumes consumable then only consumer [[49:27]] is left behind so the fact is [[49:35]] these are three vowels which are the source behind origin so that is called as [[49:42]] saran [[49:52]] now we will go into matlaka chakra and then we will see some examples also uh so what is material now the fact is that [[49:58]] we have under now we have as of now we have seen that what how the letters evolve [[50:03]] this is aspect philosophy sikh direction philosophy is another thing direction is another thing both are different things [[50:10]] okay so [[50:23]] um [[50:36]] you would be able to [[50:53]] of matricula chakra earning or the realization of supporting this realization because somebody happens in [[50:59]] some way somebody happens in some way whatever [[51:05]] your would realize [[51:20]] brain assimilation not only brain level means this outer level consciousness [[51:26]] whatever your asthma will realize that is some more than that only some with that [[51:31]] that is done by some people so whatever somebody would realize so that by the grace of guru your athma [[51:38]] would realize that so that realization what religion would matter [[51:44]] so what happens [[52:15]] um [[52:43]] so this is in the center and then on the outer circle you will see that sequentially all the vowels are written [[52:50]] in systematic alphabetical order and then they are associated also mentioned so this is the matrix of [[52:57]] this thing now we will see some examples because psychologically also we have to see what effect so so the fact is that [[53:04]] if you will see uh i will take only a few examples to make [[53:10]] it underpositive suppose you will take lot of examples it will take a lot [[53:25]] is [[53:50]] and you are able to burn all your karmas by [[54:17]] not directly but if you will read his writings you will find that sa is um [[54:24]] [Music] you can also try this if someone says someone is mentally not stable he has [[54:30]] some problem and he continuously recites uh even everyone can do it immediately in [[54:35]] mind will immediately quickly feel like okay okay [[54:42]] you will you would quickly quickly feel like okay some relax my brain has relaxed [[54:48]] so and even in word formation also you [[55:05]] all those words which give pleasure mo i do not say that uh bad words or not [[55:13]] videos certainly but you will find a lot of good words with this for example if you'll see takara [[55:20]] [Music] [[55:53]] so the fact is that they have these words have impact on psychology [[56:00]] when these letters hit our psychological consciousness of our brain they produce [[56:07]] specific kind of signal and then specific kind of hormone is released [[56:13]] for example so [[56:28]] hormone would secrete and the joy would be fed like takaras would have to so so the brain would start giving alert signals [[56:38]] so so the fact is in drought for radha's caviar used when someone is going to fight in war so in order to [[56:45]] provoke these words are in carbon these are used so so these are very few examples [[56:54]] and in details also you can find means mohammed [[57:07]] this reminded me of a very wonderful little talk that late minister sushma [[57:13]] swaraj had given i think in parliament where she had compared two sotras to bhagwan shiv one was shift [[57:21]] under stotram by ravan composition and another was a similar composition by sriram [[57:27]] and i think she had demonstrated precisely this fact that shift understood [[57:34]] very yes [[57:53]] in english more words if you will see if you're the cross behind i don't know other languages maybe in other languages [[57:58]] also this might be for other means such a prominent [[58:03]] means representations but the fact is that even if oh just i mean the fact is that no matter [[58:11]] whether someone knows this concept or not the fact is that concept would be concept for [[58:16]] example gravity existed before i newton also apple used to fail before newton also [[58:23]] only thing is he explained this thing rather even earlier in our scriptures [[58:29]] also these concepts have been explained but the fact is that we have we are not able to claim that we are not able to claim our scientific [[58:36]] legacy that is somewhere we have means not missed out but we we were not able to [[58:42]] allow to do so somehow so there is one more matrix which we [[58:48]] have uh we will quickly wrap it up so that much like it belongs to scripture on history [[58:54]] this is from the sample so i would like to tell you that there are various various means in if you will go [[59:01]] to tom you will find various very different kind of uh description means all are connected it [[59:08]] is like you are seeing that a lake is there on the seashore and then a river is flowing to a seashore and then [[59:14]] another river is going to a seashore but the fact is that all of them comprise of water and all the water mergers will see [[59:20]] and then evaporates and then condenses and then again falls in the river so the cycle is safe [[59:27]] it is like ash bharava is there so suppose some someone has to someone see [[59:32]] from uh northern bridge someone from southern western eastern so everyone would say okay kalash is like that so it [[59:39]] does not mean that it wants this this way so another one is wrong the fact is that everyone is describing [[59:46]] the kailash only only thing is the viewpoint is different because there are four sides by which [[59:52]] you can see that this structure also comes from kashmir [[1:00:00]] kashmir has a great contribution to this nation means it is unfortunate that we are seeing a lot of problems there but [[1:00:06]] the fact is that as far as knowledge is concerned kashmir has given a means tremendous contribution and abhinav says [[1:00:13]] one thing very beautiful thousands of years ago now we say whether kashmir is part of or not he says that the country [[1:00:20]] in which thousands of rivers like ganga flew just as ganga flowing kashmir there is no no even single drop of water [[1:01:09]] but commentary was written after composition of consciousness because the uh commentator of this scripture [[1:01:16]] i forgot his name i will have to see the name okay anyways so the commentator has [[1:01:21]] given only one citation in this entire in his entire community the rest entire commentary of this scripture is your [[1:01:27]] base sadhana and you when you will read this commentary you will find [[1:01:32]] that at various points automatically the discussion breaks down a breakdown and discussion would happen [[1:01:39]] you will feel like okay what happened here you're talking to patamura we were discussing something and automatically something else is not discussed so the [[1:01:46]] fact is that then guru mukha gamma gyan is there which comes from sadhanati [[1:01:51]] and then the fact is that he has quoted only one example that is of uh [[1:01:57]] panchayati while he gives example of bala mantra and says that okay [[1:02:02]] all that can be kept in any way so that he wants to explain to explain [[1:02:08]] the uh for a try of sea chakra which shall be which shall come first and last so that [[1:02:14]] to explain that he gives this example rest there is no example and even [[1:02:19]] sanskrit is very standard the main sutra sanskrit very standard [[1:02:26]] has not used any nepad etc only bhaktivinoda so it is it was it is very [[1:02:32]] tough to apprehend those locals at few sloths i have written only commentary description only i was not [[1:02:38]] able to exactly translate the slow means i am not sanskrit expert because [[1:02:44]] so what i did i have explained what is the essence of the commentary i have explained i was not able to translate [[1:02:50]] that look word by what it is very standard scripture [[1:02:57]] was directed by to comprehend [[1:03:21]] this is older than mahatma it is very clear if suppose someone is expert in grammar and sanskrit also he [[1:03:28]] will be easily accelerated [[1:03:40]] so the fact is that he tried to [[1:04:09]] is in next slide you would see that [[1:04:15]] i know so the fact is that the matrikas are divided here into five [[1:04:20]] cognitive states jagras submits [[1:04:26]] so the fact so so what this scripture says that from these cognitive states of [[1:04:31]] mind these letters have come into being and the first chapter judgement uh judgement [[1:04:37]] of purpose i have given with that forever [[1:04:59]] everything has been explained in detail and from cognitive states which letter evolves from which cognitive state that [[1:05:05]] he has explained in detail and it even if you will take a book i think i [[1:05:11]] have given around 50 diagrams in first chapter only 40 to 15 diagrams are given in first chapter because i thought that [[1:05:17]] by the help of this it could be easier to comprehend what is written here because commentary is uh [[1:05:24]] very intricate and lucid in nature and the terms are old people do not cheat chat is there so chat is generally [[1:05:31]] chat is not used for their chat is used then logics are also [[1:05:36]] given but the fact is that these are not used in common uh in a common way so in the next slide you will see that math [[1:05:43]] chakra is there embedded in mathematical sectors uh one of my readers uh [[1:06:45]] they can probably zoom that and zoom and watch it that is not a problem because it could already be available on youtube [[1:06:55]] in itself which is [[1:07:15]] am i audible clearly because my mic is shaking so the three bindu is a [[1:07:20]] so triangle and bindu together are called as sha and ma [[1:07:26]] so in triangle and bindu you will see that shine shine mar mentioned if you look properly [[1:07:31]] so the fact is smaller g very small letter sir so now we talk [[1:07:37]] about we will talk about only because when we if we go for jagras [[1:07:42]] why jagras is there so it will take hours to discuss all that every single letter its evolution [[1:07:48]] and how because even at some places the uh [[1:07:53]] grand car has he has given his own logics maybe [[1:07:59]] grammarians may have some objections and they can raise them further we can probably discuss all this but at some points [[1:09:04]] is for the fact is that there is no difference there is no difference at all [[1:09:13]] hello am i audible yes yes absolutely so that is why she is called mangini [[1:09:20]] what does it mean shah and ma the one whose limbs are ksha and majivan [[1:09:25]] shiva limbs of her that's why she's a kshmat mangini okay so and she only is [[1:09:47]] sugar cane has juice when you extract sugar and juice comes out similarly sushubti state is [[1:09:54]] extraction of jagrati and stuff it is after jagat and stepnon [[1:10:15]] that's up in this scripture in fifth chapter [[1:10:24]] last chapter yogi kriyas are also mentioned how it is anna [[1:10:30]] suppose someone say how can you say that sugar cane it is not like someone is sleeping and [[1:10:36]] all of a sudden it is [[1:10:52]] are there by which you can realize this thing this is very high stay with us again [[1:10:59]] i just like to admit here i have heard from few of my worthy friends that while reading [[1:11:05]] she can see madrika chakraviv they have felt high level of energy and they were not able to complete the reading [[1:11:12]] yes wow that is means they started feeling some [[1:11:18]] heat in their life they were not able to it is not my opinion i have heard from [[1:11:24]] the people and i am not bhagavati would great then everyone would be able to read this thing so that is because books [[1:11:29]] are available anyone who is a uh means shri with that diction can read this book so that is not a problem but i have [[1:11:35]] some inputs which i am sharing so because your gift practices are there so in the same way [[1:11:46]] means creation etc means all this word everything uh means existence of uh [[1:12:21]] lump of uh the ashes of pambio and bhanda was created and the he only was honda when [[1:12:28]] vandaser was killed gave his soul what means kanji to birth [[1:13:23]] dedicated to me and is honest in life may you give him [[1:13:28]] the joy of love in his life so for that purpose he gave him [[1:13:34]] so this push to burn only fascinates so this is the fact that only fascinates so [[1:13:39]] that's why this is associated with [[1:14:13]] because big elephant the very big elephant is controlled by and pushed same way big chat means a person who is [[1:14:20]] highly indulged highly indulged in carnal pressures and consumers that i am guilty of mission [[1:14:26]] only and nothing [[1:14:40]] and she herself is so this is different so [[1:14:46]] i would like to tell you that earlier in earlier times [[1:14:51]] the scripture line which talked about the actually this is not the real form of baby [[1:14:58]] this is which she has in isha ishmael [[1:15:07]] so in order to because everyone cannot do nirakana nirvana [[1:15:12]] it is very clear if suppose i say okay from tomorrow morning you will start me somewhere [[1:15:18]] after five ten minutes everyone will sing okay he would rather even sleep also maybe or maybe start watching [[1:15:24]] mobile phones but the fact is you sit in front of pictures [[1:15:35]] then later on when [[1:16:14]] [Music] [[1:16:28]] this is a bit different from the one of uh [[1:16:39]] is also here so this is different rest all are same okay so now there is one more in next [[1:16:46]] slide there is one more concept how mantras are originated [[1:16:54]] there are two scriptures which are diana tantrum talks about is a is a very prominent [[1:17:28]] okay so what does it say it says that before knowing that [[1:17:34]] who is this shall be known by the rashmi kram of [[1:17:40]] monkey okay if suppose for example a mantra is the ram [[1:17:45]] i will give you an example so there are three words in it three letters [[1:17:52]] and then ma so you write okay or rather you write raw amount [[1:17:58]] because matras are not considered so or because okay sorry vowels are also [[1:18:03]] yes written and then each letter [[1:18:09]] has six six rash [[1:18:39]] are given here fortunately our charity has given formulas also otherwise knowledge could have we might have lost [[1:18:45]] this manager also the way we have lost so many things so the fact is that [[1:18:51]] if suppose specific number comes so by that number you would be able to ascertain that who is this data and what kind of mantraly yen would be made so for [[1:18:57]] example in later later part of this chapter they have shown that what would be the size of [[1:19:03]] what material everything has been explained as per rashmi grams okay some [[1:19:21]] okay [[1:19:30]] okay so in all the letters [[1:20:31]] three days five jell rays sages raised then one sixty value raise [[1:20:36]] and four numbers here mana series are again minus these are not yet so induction online and in kali kram mana [[1:20:42]] series are not there yes and just to clarify for uh some of [[1:20:49]] our listeners who may not know so basically this kram and amna are basically in in simple terms they are [[1:20:54]] kind of you can say lineages so mishraji is essentially i guess trying to say that in different lineages there [[1:21:00]] are slight distinctions in how this uh tablation is done and how the calculations are done is that [[1:21:06]] correct [[1:21:26]] that's okay so that is already so that has been explained so in next slide if you have [[1:21:32]] and also by the you know just by the work just to previously see this side [[1:21:38]] please i thank you so if you will see that by the help of these rashmi's what all we can uncertain is that mantraly [[1:21:43]] length now in the next slide that calculation to access mahadasha [[1:21:48]] of any mantra so our conversion calculation is given in the scripture only and i have written [[1:21:54]] english description so if suppose or a resultant is 576 [[1:22:01]] then that specific mantra would be maha [[1:22:06]] is that okay yes so i think this is a very important uh uh [[1:22:11]] thing to remember because this is basically showing us that when we have something like [[1:22:17]] what is a mahabhithya we modern people especially english educated people and western scholars we [[1:22:23]] have a wrong impression that just randomly some now and then some avatars and devdas and like they're all [[1:22:30]] mixed up together and some list is made even today i think if you go to wikipedia for dash mahavidyas [[1:22:36]] which are the 10 most important forms of mahadevi you can say uh they say like hindu and buddhist [[1:22:42]] goddesses were combined and then a list of ten mahavidyas was made but what misraji is [[1:22:48]] trying to tell us is that this appears kind of random on the surface but if you know the inner [[1:22:55]] workings of the rishis who thought about all this there is actually a very fine and intricate logic behind it [[1:23:02]] unfortunately most people today don't know it so scholars very confidently pronounce like incorrectly that you know [[1:23:08]] whether it was for political reasons or cultural reasons and like they randomly picked up five six uh [[1:23:14]] uh they've doesn't made them into a list so but i think this is a very novel and fascinating insight into what is the [[1:23:20]] meaning of a mahavidya from the inner mechanistic workings of the mantra [[1:23:26]] itself in the same chapter [[1:23:32]] hello huh uh okay okay in the same chapter if you will move further on you will find that uh [[1:23:39]] grand theft has given some examples like for para prasad we have given example okay how go rashmi has been small [[1:23:58]] so those who are interested can read the book means here our if suppose what if someone says what would be the outcome [[1:24:04]] of this discussion i will say that we are living in a body this is cavity and from this cavity we are just peeping [[1:24:10]] outside a hole and trying to see look at yeah so we are we are going to get just [[1:24:17]] a glimpse of that after conclusion of this discussion maybe not not that also [[1:24:23]] that would depend upon my grace of my body only whether we are able to do that or not even for me for anyone so by that [[1:24:30]] way you can access the size of yantra also so it everything means there is there are logics it is not that happy [[1:24:37]] but like if you will read it you will see that when [[1:25:08]] it's of miles okay because why it is so because rashmi that is [[1:25:15]] required and how many people have to be attracted [[1:26:04]] all these traditions there is some description of and the origin of mantra and mechanism everything has been discussed so because [[1:26:11]] we have taken two examples of the chevron characters so we will take one example of vashna [[1:26:16]] sampradaya also this is their ada college they call it as shivan [[1:26:35]] i'm just taking example suppose someone says that okay this has been left that has been left so everything cannot be [[1:26:40]] discussed so just an example is given here so that does each is like what's there etc [[1:26:47]] now the fact is perhaps pages letters are [[1:26:53]] which someone are of the kara stage and they have one are staged [[1:27:01]] if someone wants to understand this in detail you shall read that scripture only is considered [[1:27:08]] what is one whatever i am speaking it's like water stream continuous stream is going out of my [[1:27:13]] mouth and it comprises of various ones various letters are there in it so the [[1:27:19]] fact is that this one is one this only is akshara brahman directly associated so the fact is that [[1:27:27]] is based on view concept of you so from [[1:27:45]] in prime and four qualities in in uh [[1:27:50]] what i can just subtle form four qualities are in two parties [[1:27:57]] so these are these [[1:28:41]] warner chakra the waste of the brahma comes from down from paraphrase [[1:28:46]] divided so this is very [[1:28:52]] short glimpse and just to introduce and just to let people know that there [[1:28:57]] is a concept of this thing this slide has been updated now what is malini [[1:29:02]] as mata has been as matrika has been discussed a lot we will discuss about malini so the [[1:29:22]] the shape of vessel same way these vowels whenever add with any consonant they adopt the shape shape [[1:29:29]] of that component xiaomi matrix so then they are called as v and there [[1:29:35]] is another reason also because we have seen that we have seen above because malini comes from click only so [[1:29:42]] concept only would be applicable here so as the swara as the swar have [[1:29:48]] shiva primacy okay so they are called as beer and consonants are called as uni so [[1:29:54]] when the when we and uni means when the shiva and shakti even [[1:29:59]] and kept separate okay so at that time there would be no agitation when but when both come come [[1:30:07]] together and get attached with each other [[1:30:14]] so again that would be a very long discussion so i'm not taking origin of in next slide we will go to [[1:30:21]] origin of malini so in malini you will see that vowels are written on right side it associates [[1:30:28]] with vengeance or consonants so or your means shiva with shakti then ma in next slide [[1:30:34]] you will see marini has evolved so because shiva and shakti have come together and [[1:30:41]] showed or agitation has happened so the sequence has been has broken so it starts with na and ends [[1:30:49]] yes and i would just like to add for some of our listeners that malini is like how matrices was that [[1:30:55]] arrangement that we saw earlier from and all that malini's the arrangement which [[1:31:01]] was the focus of this very important uh text malini videotar tantra which [[1:31:06]] i believe gupta has stated as the supreme or very wonderful [[1:31:12]] scripture yes correct of the entire system and so i just wanted to make sure people who did not know uh understood [[1:31:19]] that okay [[1:31:24]] he says that country's essence of entire [[1:32:04]] [Music] [[1:32:25]] would represent some subjective existence like joy sorrow happiness etc etc okay so [[1:32:33]] even this existing objective subjective simply we shall take it and meals and music only [[1:32:38]] means [[1:33:06]] foreign [[1:33:39]] means various ways it would happen and in previous slide if you will see the why the sequence is like this so the [[1:33:45]] fact is that it is questioning like why is first so the fact is that the arrangement [[1:33:51]] happens in this way when it breaks up when it breaks its sequence it sets up in this manner that [[1:33:59]] is the thing okay why heart has that kind of shape because body fitment is like that so the statement is like this so that is the [[1:34:06]] fact why is it nice but and there are there are matrika and malini mantras also [[1:34:12]] which with maya b is in the end first and then [[1:34:30]] also [[1:35:26]] also [[1:35:55]] displaced after its consecration then you will have to start from saman [[1:36:01]] near no matter you are doing average or you have reached on or you are about to do [[1:36:07]] surgeon at any point it happens then disruption happens and you have to spoke in order to correct that malignant [[1:36:15]] could be done that is one thing second there is any description of mantra revere [[1:36:21]] how it happens mantraly disruption happens [[1:36:36]] suppose someone has some planetary effects or someone has some trouble so shanti karmas and that is acceptable [[1:36:41]] that is allowed australia someone is not good in studies okay someone is weak someone is [[1:36:48]] financially not very good okay someone's family [[1:37:05]] that shall never be done in that case potential of mantra destroys [[1:37:10]] so if suppose potential of me rather i will tell you if you do maharana prayer twice [[1:37:16]] if you do maharana prayer twice or suppose you do once [[1:37:34]] and you suppose you do maharana khan twice your mantra reverie would exhaust and you will have to do foreign [[1:37:40]] again and there is surety that mantra would not accomplish [[1:37:47]] would not allow they will not let you complete that question so suppose some normal disruption happens in mantra [[1:37:53]] reveal because of some of which are constituted so by malini that can be corrected [[1:37:58]] in other type of [[1:38:05]] my ignorance okay for example suppose i'm just giving example not [[1:38:11]] take it personally no one should take it personally suppose someone is [[1:39:08]] there are chances of missing out [[1:39:21]] even if you talk you should talk in sanskrit only otherwise puja would become russian [[1:39:26]] have a branch of buddha so for that kind of dosha also would cover up because now people will [[1:39:33]] not be able to speak in sanskrit somebody has some emergency someone is thirsty something is requiring puja also [[1:39:38]] some [[1:40:26]] they have limited results okay so in that case what this malini would do [[1:40:32]] will make it make it [[1:41:02]] also [[1:41:17]] mukti is very high even in first chapter and then in fourth [[1:41:22]] fourth hanukkah and first aniki fourth hannibal's disguise described in details what is ben what is the difference [[1:41:28]] between moksha there is one very beautiful thing which i admire always he [[1:41:34]] say he calls back means that they know nothing and [[1:41:41]] but he he calls bharathi hari as bhagavan [[1:42:20]] so the fact is that he criticizes veda [[1:42:25]] but he calls while explaining veerachar while explaining veerachar he cites [[1:42:30]] bhagavad-gita and called veda vyasa's beerupungawa so means supreme ms v [[1:42:40]] okay [[1:42:51]] so this is something his objection is towards concept not the person [[1:42:58]] so ah so that is that is beauty of hr so here also [[1:43:04]] so so same way when he says moksha would provided by mantra i am not very clear [[1:43:22]] is he says this thing so here in 15th a [[1:43:28]] honeycomb controller clarifies that if millennials is done before garuda that mantra also would become capable of [[1:43:36]] destroying the moocs but the fact is could only be done when you are booksheet [[1:43:44]] means trick sadhana then only you can do malignant not not else so next slide drop mantra [[1:43:51]] so after okay before in rashmi i would like to add one thing i would like to remember [[1:44:04]] you might have heard about him uh i haven't actually sorry okay so you [[1:44:10]] will tell us you heard about yes yes [[1:44:26]] [Music] i think he was not willing that i shall [[1:44:33]] put his picture so it was missed out so the fact is that he was he [[1:44:39]] was sid of surah gyan it's not only the value began so he was [[1:44:45]] able to [[1:44:51]] here and he was able to manipulate with them [[1:44:56]] by which he was able to produce also [[1:45:05]] so what he would do he will convert on flower into some other flower or he will change the smell of power he will change [[1:45:11]] the object also he will mean all these were there in him [[1:45:19]] so on now we will go to mantras a mantra or next slide we will see mantra is nothing but um [[1:45:26]] now i will tell you that aham stands for r [[1:46:52]] foreign [[1:47:10]] so she is his mother is the one who has given birth to one who is uh [[1:47:17]] and he is barrow by birth yogini [[1:47:28]] so the fact is that what is if you would say that is [[1:47:33]] the real deliberation of swag the real deliberation of that [[1:47:39]] that brahma of trika where drama word is not used [[1:47:45]] used rather calls it [[1:48:16]] you would deliberate like that paragraph only and that is final earning of money [[1:48:22]] so whatever later on previously we have discussed that all only comes into being [[1:48:27]] and letters are joined together and mantras are formed how mantras are formed and how mantra could be [[1:48:32]] understood from this matrix that shall not be explained here so i'm not explaining the next slide we have some [[1:48:38]] important books of mantra are given these are shri paratranchita [[1:49:12]] to make devata formidable in the swamp [[1:49:22]] of yogi that is why it is essential that a [[1:49:28]] mantra shall comprise of these mantras so what you will see that all the mantras of yota would have certainly [[1:49:33]] have these mantras i know so these only makes up yesterday [[1:49:39]] we were discussing about bengal chandra so the fact is that vedic mantras approach but when we had swahili or [[1:49:46]] maybe um so that becomes mantra otherwise [[1:49:53]] it is not a mantra it's a simple [[1:50:20]] now you see that what a level of that yogi should be who shall be able to do puja with these [[1:50:27]] rashmi first you shall be able to accomplish together [[1:50:33]] like like i said that one or two in course [[1:50:40]] not only not even three and four would be able to do this huh [[1:50:46]] one or two so that so the fact is that luckily we are 150 course so we have [[1:51:13]] [Music] [[1:51:48]] it is in hindi and it is it is very very good book [[1:51:56]] wonderful book means anyone if suppose i say you need not to listen to this talk again you forget [[1:52:36]] the sound is complete and accurate and complete so the connection [[1:52:43]] is more accurate means direct connection in battery it is not possible 98 99 percent 90 percent even [[1:52:49]] if happens then also it is okay you might be aware of real gas and ideal gas so real gas is even vmware p2 you do [[1:52:55]] ideal is van der waal equation [[1:53:11]] so heat is dissipating real or ideal so in ideal condition is not possible but real condition it is [[1:53:17]] best second thing is also okay something which i have missed out no [[1:53:23]] issues so uh i conclude my discussion here jamai maharaja thank you thank you very much [[1:53:31]] very very wonderful uh uh session by mr rajeev thank you so [[1:53:36]] much mishraji for sparing your time i think i have learnt a tremendous amount even though i think we have been talking [[1:53:42]] about this topic for three four days uh even then going over the same things i think clarified a lot and [[1:53:50]] to our listeners honestly this is not something which [[1:53:55]] you know i expect all of you to definitely understand all of i honestly admit i understand maybe only 5 or 10 of [[1:54:01]] what was talked about today um this is honestly it was my attempt to [[1:54:06]] create this as a record for the future maybe five years ten years down the line people who have an interest might in [[1:54:12]] this might come and uh uh kind of uh go through this talk and you know maybe contact misraji and you [[1:54:18]] know make some connections and take this forward it is uh merely an attempt to kind of show that [[1:54:23]] this level of depth of analysis has existed in our traditions and what seems to us [[1:54:30]] as some half as our jumble of random thing things thrown together mantras and [[1:54:35]] yantras in reality it only appears random because we don't have [[1:54:41]] insight into the true mechanisms of how these things were [[1:54:46]] created essentially um and uh also i would like to take this opportunity to specifically uh [[1:54:54]] mention uh padmashree shi shubash kaki who has joined us very honored to have him here and [[1:55:01]] specifically because as misraji mentioned a lot of the topics [[1:55:06]] we discussed today came based on the work of great sages of [[1:55:12]] kashmir so in many ways we are carrying forward their legacy and misraji has also [[1:55:18]] mentioned that even though many of these great thinkers were based in kashmir they never saw [[1:55:23]] themselves as writing something uniquely kashmiri they always thought about it as not kashmir [[1:55:30]] shaivism but they thought about it as paramadweight and they were always considering themselves as part of the [[1:55:35]] larger hindu uh civilization and the larger bharatiya society as he was saying about [[1:55:42]] the ganga flowing through the country abhinav gupta said that that is the best country [[1:55:47]] um and of course the recent times with kashmir files releasing i think [[1:55:54]] the uh the tragedies of modern kashmir are definitely in public view but [[1:56:00]] at the same time we i think we need to also remember that uh kashmir should be remembered [[1:56:06]] uh also for example extraordinarily positive contributions and in history i would like i hope more [[1:56:12]] people yes like [[1:56:27]] philosophy there is no cash media then there are absolutely trees plants [[1:56:32]] vegetation so amazon amazon it is as good as amazon forest yes [[1:56:38]] absolutely so it is a a very great opportunity for us to have [[1:56:43]] listened to this from israji and to have carried forward the legacy of these great thinkers um a couple of [[1:56:50]] questions but i'll keep it just i'll ask just one very specific question which [[1:56:55]] bothers me and i seek advanced apology if i sound very rudimentary that is because of my lack [[1:57:02]] of understanding rather than anything else [[1:57:44]] the fact is that first of all i said that i gave example of ideal and real [[1:57:50]] okay so ideally means ideal is hundred percent i said not idealize it in bm is [[1:57:55]] up to 90 percent in order to connect with the utah it is specific means when i say that in [[1:58:03]] order to connect with because [[1:58:29]] that's why i said ideally 100 is there but everything is not hundred percent so [[1:58:34]] real in real case what is that in real case it is like up to i said ninety percent ninety five [[1:58:40]] percent i think daksa might be remembering that what i said that time that in ideal case [[1:58:47]] hundred percent accuracy shall be there but ninety percent accuracy is available in this language and yes what we have [[1:58:52]] said for example talks about that in previous times [[1:59:03]] does not exist at all so there are various so when you say that vedic swara is there so vegeta is there so it in [[1:59:10]] matrix it is already there okay i rather i will if suppose i could have a book i can [[1:59:16]] show you there are apart from 50 there are further divisions also 81 divisions are also [[1:59:21]] there in these these half etc etc also are added the fact is that accuracy level is [[1:59:28]] highest here i will refer i will replace what i said for example i said in ideal gas [[1:59:34]] condition p1 v1 is considered as p2 v2 pressure volume of ideal gas is always the same but in [[1:59:41]] real situations uh wonderball equation applies the fact is that in reality [[1:59:47]] ideal conditions because heat can never be dissipated in isolated vessel but the [[1:59:53]] fact is that you keep in isolated vessel by the evening it would become somewhat [[1:59:58]] cold means some amount of heat would dissipate so ideal isolated black body is not [[2:00:04]] we are not able to manufacture that so in that that example i have given so the fact is that [[2:00:11]] the maximum accuracy of mantra comes in this language that is what my submission is two [[2:00:17]] questions basically first question is pranava understood as being identical [[2:00:24]] to shabda brahman or is pranava understood to be a word distinct from [[2:00:29]] shabda brahman but having greater closeness to shabda brahman and a higher [[2:00:34]] ritual status than any other ordinary word so that is the first question [[2:00:56]] that is something which is specifically related to background [[2:01:02]] archer should i move on to the second question ah second question please he says this [[2:01:08]] talk used the dev devnagari script did mahashmeishwara gupta give any preferences or [[2:01:15]] recommendations for which scripts most suitably represent the nature and significance of each matrika [[2:01:23]] see in translations if you will see that if you lead milikan to guru etc the translations of them so for explaining [[2:01:29]] like for shutter a they have used the concept of a [[2:01:36]] but the fact is that he has not if you will read his writings specifically he does not talk about any script [[2:01:43]] script oriented he is not there he is oriented towards because sound is important [[2:02:18]] might be more in synchronization with this thing what i say [[2:02:24]] go ahead thank you so much for this gracious and mr jim thank you for very much that first question was answered very well [[2:02:32]] second this is also a very generic question that shall we consider this mantra [[2:02:37]] aspect as a organic evolution of the vedic literature [[2:02:42]] vedic thing and the selection of harapatta style which is normally chanted [[2:02:49]] does does that have any connection with all the descriptions that you were giving uh [[2:02:55]] sir i would like to tell you one thing that the research what abhinav tries to [[2:03:02]] explore what he tries to explore is that how mantra works that is one liner statement [[2:03:09]] so for that purpose it starts from battery and reaches up to the level of parabani [[2:03:14]] and as even the vedic mantras are written in bakhari rather he gives example of andhra [[2:03:23]] he gives example of andhra language also and he says that it means [[2:03:29]] that and said and see that he says that even the grammar have not been developed he has [[2:03:35]] given example of some sindhi uh means western indian language also he says [[2:03:40]] that even grammar is not developed there but the meaning of words are like this so those kind of examples so he says he [[2:03:47]] shows the all pervasive the focus is that how the mantra requires [[2:03:52]] that is the emphasis how it works so how much so if suppose it is a mantra it will have some effect of this thing [[2:03:59]] for example [[2:04:08]] so allah [[2:04:37]] into being from africa evolves then they develop they become gross [[2:04:46]] and then further 16 vowels are evolving [[2:04:58]] so wherever this even i have read in various services i am not aware of it but what i have seen [[2:05:06]] is that in these regional languages or not even in hindi also you will see that letters are of this form only [[2:05:13]] even in the i i'm not sure but as i have seen means [[2:05:19]] i think alphabets are in this manner i'm not sure but i have somewhere means i know i'm [[2:05:26]] not aware of convention but the fact is that because these were that's what i said completeness in that time because [[2:05:39]] suppose any language is there so you can you can mention that like in english there's a jar [[2:06:01]] not there like in purdue's eyes but in hindi you can write ja with bindi [[2:06:08]] below then it becomes that could be written that is arabic [[2:06:14]] for example uh full so full so full of heart initiative in [[2:06:19]] the life so that women's representation can be done in this matrix most accurate representation can be done [[2:06:25]] here so in that in that comes and have enough talk about service [[2:06:30]] [Music] [[2:06:43]] thank you misraji that was and one more thing i wanted to add just a corollary to what ramadan had asked over the [[2:06:50]] course of our discussion mishraji had also mentioned his other talks which he has explored very deeply the [[2:06:56]] connections between the vedic era and various modern traditions including the [[2:07:02]] ancient roots of lalitha sundari so if that [[2:07:07]] if that was also part of your question as in the connections between these tantric sampradayas and the vedic past misraji [[2:07:14]] has gone very extensively into that and i think they just that i got from him correct me [[2:07:19]] if i'm wrong mishraji is that these were always considered as part of a larger shall we say hindu [[2:07:27]] hole this is a in even though modern [[2:07:33]] scholars especially many from outside india seek to portray this as some sort of [[2:07:38]] schismatic or unique thing which really has no connection to the rest of the hindu structure i think misraji if i [[2:07:45]] understand it correctly he is very keen on emphasizing the continuity and [[2:07:50]] connectivity between these various traditions including like panchatra and which also of course has [[2:07:55]] very ancient uh uh uh roots in the world i would like to give you some examples [[2:08:23]] and without any prejudice and if you will read his language he is not trying to establish and [[2:08:28]] reinforce something he is using as a running example [[2:08:34]] like that [[2:08:40]] and he says that this female discharge and male discharge [[2:08:45]] during copulation both are the most sacred substances of this planet [[2:08:52]] has been explained [[2:09:01]] and that is most important thing [[2:09:45]] foreign [[2:10:19]] so the fact is that the source of these rituals is same [[2:11:02]] foreign [[2:11:20]] liberation is dependent upon [[2:11:47]] the very fundamental concept is same the fact is that [[2:11:58]] [Music] is [[2:12:32]] that is the thing uh thank you so much mr aji for such an enlightening talk and my question is [[2:12:40]] related to actually my research area so i just wanted to [[2:12:45]] know about uh matrikas from creative perspective so is it possible just by [[2:12:53]] concentrating on matrikas and tatwas anyone can like [[2:12:59]] evoke images for creative writing is it possible [[2:13:06]] you mean you mean pictures uh yeah like a mental picture or you can [[2:13:12]] say [[2:13:23]] i think i have that book also just a minute just a minute [[2:13:28]] i have various such books just a minute uh he has given [[2:13:34]] is are these pictures visible yes yes yes [[2:13:40]] says [[2:14:11]] apart from it there is one more book of nada [[2:14:17]] in which akshar and then specific dhan has been given this is the [[2:14:22]] so so there are various there are various ways yes it can happen the thing is that i tell you that [[2:14:37]] nothing is clear everything [[2:14:52]] is mentioned here that is very important book and the name of that book i believe is [[2:14:58]] that correct yes and the other one is i think uh secrets of math [[2:15:05]] if i remember correctly this yes there is a few questions from a [[2:15:11]] gentleman abhishek ghosh which misraji if you wish you can answer otherwise you may you know feel free if you think [[2:15:16]] maybe better for these things to be answered by a guru um he asks about what is the significance of the [[2:15:24]] chakra and he asks how to reach the state of pragya and then
