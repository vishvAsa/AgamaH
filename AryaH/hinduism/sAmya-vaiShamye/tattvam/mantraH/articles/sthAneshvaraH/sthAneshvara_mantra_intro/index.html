Meaning Mantras are at the center of religious experience in India: they are found in all modes of ritual and practices, and they accompany all life events from birth to death. While mantras ground meditative practice and the many paths to liberation, they are also applied for magical power, alchemical transformation and medicinal purposes, and for prosperity in various phases of life. Found in the earliest Vedic literature, mantras transcend Hindu culture and are also found in Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh traditions. Even within Hindu culture, mantras defy a single interpretation. The understanding of mantra found in the Vedas, Tantras, and folk traditions often overlap and shift. Subsequent traditions utilize some of the earlier mantras, shifting their meaning, ritual, and visualization.&#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43; In the classical sense, the term mantra is derived from two different verbal roots: the first is √matri &#43; ac or ghañ which means ‘speaking secretly’ (Sāyaṇa), and the second is √man&#43;tran, meaning ‘to contemplate’ (Yāska).&#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43; Tantras often derive this term from two other verbal roots, √man (to contemplate) &#43;√trai (to protect) (KT 17.54). Stemming from different verbal roots and referring to distinct concepts, mantra can be considered as wholly discrete terms. Among the prominent meanings of the Vedic or Tantric mantras, including secret counseling and the elevated self-awareness (pramātṛ) &#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43; identified in the Trika system as ‘mantra,’ this essay focuses the first meaning of the term.">

<h2 id="meaning">Meaning</h2>
<p>Mantras are at the center of religious experience in India: they are found in all modes of ritual and practices, and they accompany all life events from birth to death. While mantras ground meditative practice and the many paths to liberation, they are also applied for magical power, alchemical transformation and medicinal purposes, and for prosperity in various phases of life.  Found in the earliest Vedic literature, mantras transcend Hindu culture and are also found in Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh traditions.  Even within Hindu culture, mantras defy a single interpretation.  The understanding of mantra found in the Vedas, Tantras, and folk traditions often overlap and shift.  Subsequent traditions utilize some of the earlier mantras, shifting their meaning, ritual, and visualization.+++(5)+++  In the classical sense, the term mantra is derived from two different verbal roots: the first is √matri + ac or ghañ which means ‘speaking secretly’ (Sāyaṇa), and the second is √man+tran, meaning ‘to contemplate’ (Yāska).+++(5)+++  Tantras often derive this term from two other verbal roots, √man (to contemplate) +√trai (to protect) (KT 17.54).  Stemming from different verbal roots and referring to distinct concepts, mantra can be considered as wholly discrete terms.  Among the prominent meanings of the Vedic or Tantric mantras, including secret counseling and the elevated self-awareness (pramātṛ) +++(5)+++ identified in the Trika system as ‘mantra,’ this essay focuses the first meaning of the term.</p>
<h2 id="classical-definitions">Classical Definitions</h2>
<h3 id="vedic">Vedic</h3>
<p>Mantra is something “pronounced by seers” (kaviśastá Ṛg 1.152.2b; 6.50.14d; 10.14.4c,  Findly 1991, 15-47).</p>
<p>Mantras serve to bring to light the subsidiary parts of the sacrifice as it is being performed (MSBh 1.2.32.  Taber 1991, 149).</p>
<p>Mantra is what activates an indication of ritual element (abhidhānasya codaka  MSBh 2.1.32).</p>
<h3 id="tantric">Tantric</h3>

<li>“The mantra is so-called because it is in the nature of thought and deliverance.  It is indeed all-knowing thought and release from transmigration.” (RT, verse 266.  Padoux 1990, 374).</li>
<li>“ . . . a thought which is omniscience, a liberation which is grace bestowed upon the transmigratory soul . . .” (Viveka on TĀ 3.225. Padoux 1990, 374).</li>
<li>“All mantras consist of phonemes and their nature is that of energy, O dear One.  Know, however, that this energy is the mātṛkā, whose nature is that of Śiva.”  Tantrasadbhāva.  Padoux 1990, 374.</li>
<li>“ . . . mantra is the awareness [of reality]” ŚS 2.1.</li>
<li>“Mantras are the Venerable [Energy] of the phonemes.  They are in the nature of the world as well as of the supreme Lord, and so forth.  They are thought and liberation.  They consist of discursive thought as much as of pure consciousness”.  (Abhinavagupta in PTV, p. 243.  Padoux 1990, 376).</li>
<li>“The mantra is so-called because it is of the nature of the contemplation of the divine of unbound light [and] because it protects from all fears”.  KT 17.54.</li>
<li>“The meaning of the term mantra is some awareness that encapsulates [lit. gulps] the entire mental constructions which is of the character of thinking in its expansion and of the character of protecting from fear in its retraction.”   MM 49.</li>
<li>“ . . . mantra is not comprised of letters. Neither is it of the body having ten arms or five faces.  Mantra should be [understood] as the rise of sound in the early point of determination.”  Cited in Parimala, MM 49.</li>

<h2 id="contemporary-definitions">Contemporary Definitions</h2>
<p>Jan Gonda:  For the Vedic Mantras<br>
“a general name for the formulas, verses or sequences of words in prose which contain praise . . . are believed to have magical, religious, or spiritual efficiency, are recited, muttered or sung in the Vedic ritual and which are collected in the methodically arranged corpora of Vedic texts.” (Gonda 1975, IV: 251).</p>
<p>For the Tantric Mantras<br>
“a power (śakti) in the form of formulated and expressed thought” (Gonda 1975, 271).</p>
<p>Agehananda Bharati<br>
“A mantra is a quasi-morpheme or a series of quasi-morphemes, or a series of mixed genuine and quasi-morphemes arranged in conventional patterns, based on codified esoteric traditions, and passed on from one preceptor to one disciple in the course of a prescribed initiation” (Bharati 1965, 111).</p>
<p>André Padoux For the Tantric Mantras<br>
“A mantra is a formula or a sound with a fixed and prescribed form, to be used according to certain rules and in prescribed circumstances, and empowered with a general or a specific efficacy acknowledged by the tradition wherein it is used.” (Padoux 1990, 379).</p>
<p>Second [philosophical] definition<br>
“A mantra is an aspect of the cosmic energy, and thereby it lies at a certain level of consciousness.” (Padoux 1990, 379).</p>
<h2 id="general-characteristics">General Characteristics</h2>
<p>The above definitions make explicit that the concept of mantra cannot be reduced to a single interpretation.  It is nonetheless possible to highlight some characteristics in order to identify mantras.  In general, specific lineages assume traditional authority in transmitting specific mantras with a focus on the oral instruction. Receiving a mantra, thus, becomes identical to receiving ritual initiation (dīkṣā).+++(5)+++  Mantras are considered to be divine revelation, and the authorities, the Ṛṣis in the Vedic tradition and Siddhas in the folk pantheons, are considered capable of ‘hearing’ the cosmic resonance.+++(4)+++  The power of mantra is believed to transcend its linguistic ability to signify something and they often defy the rules of spoken language and thus the efficacy of a mantra relies less on grammatical correctness than on its precise articulation.+++(5)+++  Distanced from common language, a mantra can be an acronym of the names of deities or of various mantras.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Mantras are often identified with distinct deities and just as the images of the deities receive rituals of life-installation and worship, so also do mantras.+++(4)+++  In this depiction, mantras assume their own personalities. When mantras are applied in specific rituals, their very nature shifts according to the ritual application.+++(4)+++ Mantras, then, are often flexible; they can be used for different and sometimes contrasting purposes, and the treatment of mantras follows the ritual paradigm.  This application of mantras often relates to the construction or visualization of various geometric designs.+++(4)+++  Although the incorporation of geometric designs for rituals that require chanting mantras is found in both Vedic and Tantric rituals, the interrelationship between mantra and maṇḍala becomes prominent in the latter.  In the Tantric depiction, just as peripheral deities are considered to be emanations of the central deity, the mantras of the deities in the circle are considered to be limbs of the core mantra.+++(5)+++ Tantras often reverse the Vedic ritual paradigm by placing a mantra at the center of the ritual, and in many cases, the recitation of mantra replaces the ritual itself.+++(5)+++  In this changed paradigm, the mantra is regarded as the foundation for reflection, and the mental resonance of mantra is considered to be more powerful than its vocalic articulation.+++(4)+++</p>
<h2 id="the-vedic-mantras">The Vedic Mantras</h2>
<p>The composers of the Vedic mantras are called ‘seers’ (Ṛṣis).  The Vedic citations identified as ṛc are metrical and are loudly pronounced, whereas the yajus sections contain prose to be uttered lowly in various ritual contexts. Vedic tradition stresses exact articulation, and variation in chanting gives rise to different branches of the Vedas (Carpenter 1994, 19-34).+++(4)+++  As rcs are associated with deities, mantras identified as yajus are linked with rituals. The sāman is metrical and chanted with musical effect.  The mantras in the Atharvaveda are often linked to magical effects.</p>
<p>Due to the stature of the Vedas in Indian society, vernacular traditions occasionally link themselves to the Vedas.  The authority in the Vedic paradigm concerns the power of speech, limited to that embodied by the Ṛṣis through their penance.  Myths often highlight the seer’s power to transform reality through speech.+++(4)+++  As this is not simply linguistic signification, authoritativeness is crucial to mantric identity.</p>
<p>The concept of speech (vāc) as divine is at the center of mantra.  In the Vedic world, speech is considered to be the teacher of gods (Ṛc 8.100.10; 10.125.3), immortal (Ṛc 1.139.😎), and of the nature of light (Ṛc 9.73.5).  They are the mothers (mātaraḥ) (Ṛc 8.6.20), and are indestructible (akṣarā) (Ṛc 1.80.1). +++(5)+++ This divination of speech manifests in Indian philosophical traditions on one hand in the concept that the signifying power (śakti) of language is divine, and on the other, in the magical power of speech with its ability to transform reality.+++(4)+++  Vedic tradition relates correct understanding and articulation of mantras to magical results.  A narrative suggests that the demons lost the war by failing to pronounce the mantras correctly (MB 1.1. pages 30-31).  In the Hindu paradigm, all rituals require mantra.  It is arguable that rituals and mantras exist independently and are superimposed upon each other for magical effect.  In the later traditions, the efficacy of mantras supersedes the ritual paradigm.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The repetition of mantras comes to prominence in the later Vedic period, with soft recitation in the morning and louder articulation later in the day.  This stylistic shift in chanting evolves in the form of three recitations: low (mandra), inaudible (upāṃsu), and mental (mānasa) (Patton 2005, 29).+++(4)+++  This structure of chanting unfolds with the divine vāc being not merely speech having power, but Vāc as the goddess of wisdom and the procreative force associated with Prajāpati, the god of creation (Holdrege 1996, 89-93, 105-112).</p>
<h2 id="importing-mantras-vedic-mantras-in-the-tantric-context">Importing Mantras: Vedic Mantras in the Tantric Context</h2>
<p>The vast gap between the Vedas and the Tantras is bridged through the concept of mantra.  The deities invoked in the Vedas, the mantras associated with the deities, and the rituals differ greatly when compared to Tantric deities, mantras, and ritual application of those mantras.  Vedic mantras are poetic in nature, a characteristic that diminishes in the subsequent mantra literature.  Vedic mantras are replete with simile and metaphor, and record history through poetic vision, which is not the case for Tantric mantras.+++(5)+++  Despite differences, the mantra which embodies the concept of the power of speech, is at the core of both Vedic and Tantric traditions.  Most Tantras attribute mantras to one or the other Vedic seers, suggesting that their authority in Indian society had remained undiminished despite the changed ritual context.</p>
<p>Tantras frequently draw upon the Vedic mantras.  An exploration of the Gāyatrī mantra, which is both the most popular Vedic mantra recited today as well as a Tantric mantra, demonstrates the nuances added in transporting mantras from one to another context.  GT delineates the detailed ritual, visualization, and application of this mantra.  While the name Gāyatrī comes from the verbal root √gā or √gai, meaning ‘to sing,’ the mantra is no longer sung, but is quietly articulated or repeated mentally.+++(4)+++  The deity of the mantra is no longer Savitṛ (the sun), but Sāvitrī, a goddess with benign anthropomorphic form.+++(4)+++  The mantra is no longer read once in the ritual context, but is repeated many times.  The associated deity, Gāyatrī, is meditated upon in different forms: in the form of Gāyatrī in red garb for the early morning, as Sāvitrī in white garb during the day, and as Sarasvatī in smoky garb at sunset.+++(5)+++  She is visualized as having five faces and ten arms during late night meditation.  The full mantra practice requires the installation of the mantra in the body (nyāsa), the demonstration of various gestures (mudrā), and visualization of both the corporeal form of the deity and each and every letter of the mantra.+++(5)+++  Furthermore, each letter is focused upon as having a specific color, and is associated with a specific Ṛṣi and meter (GT, Chapter 1).  Each letter of the mantra links with distinct principles found in Sāṅkhya cosmology, and certain perfections are associated with certain letters of the mantra.  The practice includes maṇḍala construction and worship, wherein various deities are invoked as emanation of the goddess Gāyatrī (PST, Chapter 30).</p>
<p>Duplicating the Vedic Gāyatrī mantra, Tantras produce multiple versions, with each of the deities having its own Gāyatrī mantra.+++(5)+++  In the changed context, this mantra transforms to a ‘class’ referring to a particular type of mantra associated with various deities.  Adopting this structure, sometimes even peripheral deities in the mandala have their own Gāyatrī mantra.</p>
<p>Another example of this process of adaptation and transformation can be found in the Śaiva Āgamas, which often utilize five Vedic mantras in ritual visualization of the five faces of Śiva.  These mantras are at the center of the Pāśupata vows and practices. The Svacchandatantra describes the Aghora mantra, associating it with Svacchanda Bhairava.  Parallel to the Tantric practice of Gāyatrī, these Śaiva mantras move to a new ritual paradigm with a shift, not only in visualization and preparatory rituals, but also in the meaning of the mantra.  They now correspond to various Śiva or Bhairava forms, and the practice includes the installation of mantras in the body, construction and visualization of a maṇḍala, demonstration of various gestures,+++(4)+++ and a high number of mantra repetitions.  Various perfections and magical powers are associated with repetition of these mantras.  These examples demonstrate the fluidity of the Hindu traditions, and illustrate the shift of the ritual paradigm with the mantras remaining unchanged.+++(4)+++</p>
<h2 id="mantra-in-tantric-literature">Mantra in Tantric Literature</h2>
<p>Tantric mantras dominate the popular Hindu perception of the power of speech.  These mantras may be in Sanskrit, in a hybrid language, or in the vernacular.  Although mantras in the Tantric world vastly differ from their Vedic counterparts, Tantras often assign the Vedic seer and the meter for their mantras.  In the shifted paradigm, Tantras stress the powers of the letters (mātṛkā) that collectively constitute the power of mantras.+++(4)+++  Letters, the substance of mantras, are considered here to be the blueprint of creation.</p>
<h3 id="mantra-and-mātṛkā">Mantra and Mātṛkā</h3>
<p>Each of the Sanskrit letters, generally counted as fifty, is considered as mātṛkā, giving rise to words and in turn to the world.  Following ŚS, mātṛkās constitute the very foundation of cognition (ŚS 1.4).  Tantric texts arrange letters in various orders, attributing special significance to each variation.+++(4)+++  The Śabdarāśi order, wherein the letters are read in the sequence of a to kṣ, highlights the prominence of Bhairava.  In the Mālinī sequence, the letters are arranged from n to ph.  Tantras give a unique visualization for each of the letters and also assign a specific number of rays (raśmi).  These rays, referring to the powers of the five elements from earth to sky, are organized differently in different letters corresponding to the transmissions (āmnāyas), the different sources of the emanation of the deities (VAT, Ch. 20).+++(4)+++  Furthermore, the letters a to kṣ are segmented into seven or eight groups and are related to their corresponding deities, invoked as Mātṛkās.+++(4)+++  In other words, the powers of Bhairava and Mātṛkā manifest through the articulation of vowels and consonants that collectively constitute the mantra.</p>
<p>As the word aham is an acronym of both vowels and consonants, this is considered to be the seminal form of Bhairava and Mātṛkā.  The term means I-sense.  The world is considered the manifestation of aham in both the cosmological sense with the categories emerging from the letters, and the cognitive sense with self-awareness being the foundation of concepts, and that in turn of the perceived world.  These two letters also depict the seminal drop (bindu) and sound (nāda), suggesting the capacity of mantras to be ‘seen’ and ‘heard.’+++(5)+++  The cosmic resonance encapsulated in letters and found in deeper levels of pronunciation establishes the parallel between the individual body where Kuṇḍalinī resides in the subtle and physical forms of sound, and the cosmos that is the manifestation of sound in material form (LT, Ch. 18-23).+++(4)+++</p>
<h3 id="mantra-as-person">Mantra as Person</h3>
<p>According to Tantras, mantras not only distill the cosmic forces and empower its holder, they are often treated as living persons.  As each mantra presents its own order of letters, it depicts a unique macrocoosm, with mantra being the conscious subject, the axis upon which all energies revolve.  The divine nature of speech, found in anthropomorphic form in the Tantras, parallels the concept that the proper order of letters unfolds the hidden forces of the cosmos in the form of mantras.  Select instances to describe the subjective domain of mantras include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mantras embody awareness (KT 15.61).</li>
<li>Mantras are considered engendered by mātṛkā, the mothers (ŚTT 2.57)+++(4)+++</li>
<li>Most of the monosyllabic mantras are considered to be ‘seminal’ (bīja), from which longer mantras emerge.+++(4)+++</li>
<li>Mantras are masculine, feminine, or neuter.  The mantras that end with vaṣaṭ or phaṭ are considered to be masculine, while those ending with vauṣaṭ or svāhā  are feminine, and those ending with huṃ or namaḥ are neuter  (Mantramahodadhi 24.92-94) Other Tantras consider the mantras ending with hum as masculine, and the mantras ending with ṭha ṭha as feminine (ŚTT 2.58).+++(5)+++</li>
<li>Mantras can have impurities (sūtaka) related to birth or death (KT 15.57).</li>
<li>Mantras receive the rituals of birth and are awakened (KT 15. 71-72.  ŚTT 2.112-123).</li>
<li>Mantras can be perplexed or angry; they can be young, adolescent, or old; they can be proud, insensible, intoxicated, deceitful, or slow; they can turn their face away; they can be deaf, blind, inanimate, servile, hungry, immobilized, tormented, without affection, lifeless, asleep, cruel, dull, hostile, indifferent, ashamed, or deluded  (KT 15.65-70.  ŚTT 2.64-110,  Buhnemann 1992, 79).+++(4)+++</li>
<li>A mantra can be a friend or an enemy (KT 15. 84.  ŚTT 2.126).+++(4)+++</li>
</ol>
<p>These attributes of mantra are possible only when mantras are treated as persons and not merely as words or instruments for acquiring magical results.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-mantras">The Power of Mantras</h2>
<p>The Vedic understanding, that rituals constitute and transform reality, embodies the notion of the power of mantras, as there are no rituals without mantras.  The later Vedic concept that praṇava (Oṃ) is the source of the three planes of the cosmos typifies Tantric exegesis, and the early Indian notion of penance (tapas) is reversed in later Indian culture, with mantras replacing rituals and penances.  In the Vedic paradigm, one aspires to ‘see’ mantras, and be a Ṛṣi, whereas in the Tantric context, mantras are divine revelations and one aspires to achieve siddhis through the mantra practice.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Mantras are often compared to weapons.  Mantras that grant protection, identified as Sudarśana, Aghora, Pāśupata, Nṛsiṃha, Brahmā, and so on, and mantras given the mythological names for weapons, both highlight the paradigm of warfare.  If practiced differently, mantras generate the opposite effect: the mantra for granting long life, when recited in reverse order, is applied as a mantra for killing.+++(4)+++  Read from back to front, the DM grants supernormal powers, and the Gāyatrī mantra carries out magical effects. Although the etymological and syntactic meaning of a mantra does not apply in these reversals, the concept of Mātṛkā generating power in the mantra is not challenged even in the changed sequence.</p>
<p>Patañjali identifies certain perfections that are achieved through mantras (YS 4.1).  These supernormal powers are clearly distinguished from those attained through tapas and absorption. In his commentary, Vyāsa identifies perfections such as having multiple bodies through birth, agelessness and deathlessness through the application of elixir, the powers such as manipulating the size of the body through mantras, and the ability of shape-shifting through tapas (Vyāsa in YS 4.1).  This categorization is not applicable to both Vedic and Tantric understandings, as they unequivocally proclaim the unparalleled powers of matras.</p>
<p>In Tantric practice, the power of mantras is discovered through acquisition of a specific state of mind.  The gesture called khecarī, for instance, depicts the state of mind beyond thoughts, identifying it as the supreme state and origin (yoni) of all deities and mantras (NT 7.35-41).+++(4)+++  Mantras are considered more powerful in their seminal (bīja) form.  Aham is one of these seed mantras that stands as acronym for all the letters and also for self-awareness (Padoux 1991, 386-389).+++(4)+++  Mantras, along these lines, are the specific arrangements of the powers found in letters (mātṛkā), which are the ‘unrecognized mothers’ for bound individuals and are divine forces for the realized ones (ŚS 1.4).+++(5)+++  The rise of the powers that underlie these letters determines perfections, and when all the forces of these letters are concealed, one is bound and compared to a beast (SK 45).  The realization of the divine aspect of the I-sense through the complete recognition of aham is therefore considered to be the essence of all the mantras.</p>
<p>The vigor (vīrya) of mantra is considered to be experienced through the immersion in pure consciousness (ŚS 1.22 and Vimarśinī thereon).  Tantras are in agreement that the letters pronounced are not mantras if they are repeated without awareness.+++(5)+++  An aspirant merges his self-awareness with a mantra through ritual installation of mantras and through visualization, wherein the focus lies on the integration and dissemination of mantra and letters.  The vigor of mantras is felt through the expansion of the self-awareness that embodies the cosmos (ŚS 2.3).</p>
<p>Essentially, the power of mantras is ‘felt.’  As explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“once entered that state which (the yogi) takes as his support and firmly resolves that: ‘I will surely do whatever he says,’ both the sun and moon set, following the ascending way, into the channel of suṣumnā, once abandoned the sphere of the universe. Then in that great sky, when the sun and moon dissolve away, the dull minded (yogi is cast down) into a state like that of deep sleep.  The awakened however remains lucid.  Seizing that strength (bala), mantras, endowed with the power of omniscience, perform their functions, as do the senses of the embodied.”
SK 23-26.  Dyczkowski 1994, 102-104</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of mantras parallels the power of Kuṇḍalinī.  As mantra stands both as its phonetic resonance and the awareness embedded in it, so does Kuṇḍalinī with its relationship to life force (prāṇa) and awareness.  Tantric texts such as ŚV discuss the physical effects of the rise of Kuṇḍalinī.  The manifestation of mantric powers coincides with the waking of Kuṇḍalinī.  There are physical symptoms associated with the rise of this serpentine power, some of which are wearisome (ŚV 19-22).  This depiction tallies with the folk belief that mantras can be ‘dangerous’ and are not to be practiced without a proper guide.</p>
<p>Tantras highlight the schema that audible mantra recitation (śābda) is less powerful in comparison to inner vocalization  (upāṃśu), which in turn is subordinate to mental reflection (mānasa).  The inner recitation of a mantra is considered to be a hundred times more powerful than vocalic recitation, and the mental counting is considered one thousand times more efficient.  Some Tantras relate vocalic recitation to inferior accomplishments such as killing or hypnotizing, inner utterance (upāṃśu) to achieving perfections such as distance sight or hearing, and mental recitation as the means to liberation (LT 39.35).+++(5)+++  Tantras apply their own set of rules and regulations to the course of recitation for discovering the power of mantras.</p>
<p>Following Tantras, the course of mantra practice starts with finding a proper mantra that fits the nature of the aspirant and culminates with the ‘waking’ of mantras.  As mantras are considered to have their own personalities, particular mantras are appropriate for particular persons.  This selection of mantras and initiation is accompanied by contemplation upon the meaning of the mantras given, followed by the enlivenment of the mantras (mantra-caitanya).  Both the cognitive and resonant aspects of the word are actively engaged in this phase of making the mantras alive.  Through the perception that mantras are powerful, and are the divine vehicles for achieving perfection and liberation, one builds faith in mantras.  This conviction in the power of mantras is an important stage in mantra practice.  In this course, the aspirant visualizes all the letters of the mantra in the heart, connects it to the Kuṇḍalinī, and visualizes them united in the thousand petalled lotus.+++(4)+++  The repetition of the mantra with saṃpuṭa, or the insertion of the seed syllables such as hrīṃ at the beginning and ending of the mantra recitations, is taught as the means for the rise of mantras.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Some seed mantras such as hrīṃ are also identified as kullukā.  Visualization of the specific deity along with her kullukā, prior to counting the mantra, is considered a necessary step in mantra recitation.  These syllables are also identified as the bridge (setu) between the practitioner and the mantra, and are supposed to be recited before chanting the mantra.  Each of the mantras is supposed to have emanated from a seed mantra and the recitation of that seed mantra, such as śrīṃ for Lakṣmī, is supposed to purify speech and empower the mantra recitation.</p>
<p>The mantras received can have various faults. A practitioner revealing his practice, for example, is considered to be a fault.  The power of mantras is believed to manifest when these faults are removed.  Tantras describe the following rituals as necessary in order to purify mantras:</p>
<ol>
<li>Birth (janana):  In this ritual, a geometric design associated with birth (janana yantra) is made, in which the letters are written and a specific mantra is revealed.</li>
<li>Illumination (dīpana): This ritual recitation of the mantra begins with haṃsa and ends with so&rsquo;ham.</li>
<li>Awakening (bodhana): This refers to the recitation of the mantra with hrūṃ at both of its ends.</li>
<li>Beating (tāḍana): To recite the mantra with phaṭ at both ends is considered ‘beating. ’</li>
<li>Consecration (abhiṣeka): In this ritual, the main mantra is consecrated with the mantra aiṃ haṃsaḥ oṃ.</li>
<li>Purification (vimalīkaraṇa): In this ritual, the main mantra is recited with Oṃ troṃ vaṣaṭ at both ends.</li>
<li>Enlivenment (jīvana): To recite the mantra with svadhā vaṣaṭ in both ends is considered enlivenment.</li>
<li>Libation (tarpaṇa): This is the ritual offering of milk, honey, or water one hundred times while reciting the main mantra.</li>
<li>Concealing (gopana): This is the ritual of reciting the main mantra with hrīṃ at both ends.</li>
<li>Satiation (āpyāyana): Recitation of the mantra with hsauḥ in both ends is the ritual ‘satiation’  (MMU 24.98-108).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-meaning-of-mantras">The Meaning of Mantras</h2>
<p>The cognitive and phonic aspects are inseparable from one another in Mantras.  Just as the sound of the mantra, its correct articulation, and the number of repetitions are equally important, both the Vedic and the Tantric literature likewise stress that understanding the meaning of mantras is an integral part of mantra practice.  Later Mīmāṃsā treatises state that ‘mantras call to memory things associated with some performance,’ suggesting that mantras used in rituals are meaningful in the ritual context, whereas others have ‘unseen’ (adṛṣṭa) meaning.+++(4)+++  Mantras are deciphered in different ways, accepting different perspectives to be valid.+++(4)+++  Exploration of several prominent exegetes and the traditions that endeavor to discuss the meaning of mantras follows.</p>
<h3 id="yāska">Yāska</h3>
<p>Yāska, the earliest known commentator upon the Vedic literature, strongly propounds meaning in mantras.  He criticizes Kautsa who considers mantras to be devoid of meaning (Nir 1.15) and proposes that Vedic words are identical to the spoken language (Nir 1.16).  In rejection of the position that mantras are obscure, Yāska says that it is not the fault of the post if a blind person does not see it: it is the fault of the man himself (Nir 1.16).  He cites passages describing the person as a blockhead who, having read the mantras, does not understand their meaning (Nir 1.18).</p>
<p>His exegetical approach is to first extract the meaning of ritual language from its common usage, and then to explore the etymological basis for multiple meanings.  Yāska’s exegesis culminates in the section called Daivata, where he categorizes mantras as 1. indirectly addressed, 2. directly addressed, and 3. self-invocations  with a first-person subject.  He understands the deity of the mantra as the one whom the seer invokes with a particular request (Nir 7.1). This understanding of mantra limits its scope to invocations, and does not take into account the uktha, bīja, and kūṭa type of mantras.  Utilizing a sophisticated process, Yāska deciphers the meaning of mantras on two different planes, one corresponding to the deity (adhidaiva), and the other to the self (adhyātma).+++(4)+++  This tendency to derive multiple meanings of mantras becomes prominent in the later traditions.</p>
<h3 id="the-mīmāṃsā-exegetical-tradition">The Mīmāṃsā Exegetical Tradition</h3>
<p>The nature, role, and meaning of mantras are crucial to Mīmāṃsā texts.  Thinkers of this Vedic tradition such as Śabara, Kumārila, and Prabhākara have an unmistakable imprint on other exegetical traditions.  Central to the Mīmāṃsā tradition are the concepts that mantras are not of human origin (apauruṣeya), and that mantra recitation creates power that did not exist before (apūrva).  Mīmāṃsakas first perceived mantras as eternal and in saying so, they primarily meant the permanence of phonemes (varṇa).</p>
<p>Śabara contends that ‘word’ (śabda) embodies properties that are both seen (dṛṣṭa) and unseen (adṛṣṭa).  The comprehension of word-meaning can be considered the visible aspect, whereas the ‘power’ believed integral to the articulated word can be identified as the second.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The next concept of Śabara’s, that the meaning of word is image (ākṛti), allows later linguists to conceive of ‘meaning’ as mental.+++(4)+++  For Śabara, ‘word’ is not confined within time nor is it comprised of parts (Gächter, 1983, 38-69).  This concept parallels the Sanskrit grammarians’ view of the Śabda Brahman.</p>
<p>Kumārila posits that mantras have ‘intrinsic validity’ (svataḥ prāmāṇya).  While defending that the Vedas are not of human or divine origin, Kumārila argues that the content of the Vedas, dharma in general, is not found by any external means of knowledge.  This concept is at the foundation of later epistemologists, who argue that the means of knowledge does not depend on further means for its validity (Taber 1992, 204-221).  Adopting this position, the magical effect of rituals, some of which come to fruition in subsequent lives, cannot be confirmed through any other means of knowledge.</p>
<p>The meaning of a sentence emerges here in the context of analyzing mantras.  The theory that the meaning of a word is understood in relation to the meaning of other words in a sentence, or ‘related designation’ (anvitābhidhāna), is attributed to Prabhākara.  Following this argument, linguistic understanding relies on unitary comprehension of meaning.  As the movement of a wagon cannot be reduced to specific functions of its parts, the singular awareness derived from a sentence, following this understanding, cannot be attributed to separate words (Siderits 1985, 253-297). +++(4)+++</p>
<p>Following the theory of designated relation (abhihitānvaya) of Kumārila, the meaning of a sentence is gleaned from the meaning of its words, and knowing the meaning of one word does not depend upon comprehension of other words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Exegetes have utilized both of these methods for explaining mantras. +++(4)+++</p>
<h3 id="bhartṛhari">Bhartṛhari</h3>
<p>Although the scope of Bhartṛhari’s philosophy of language is not only directed to mantras, it nonetheless provides deep insight into the classical understanding of the nature of ‘word’  (śabda) identified with Brahman.  His concept of ‘word’ as the absolute, the concept of sphoṭa in which meaning is a unitary whole, and the analysis of speech at the esoteric levels of paśyantī, madhyamā, and vaikharī, are foundational to mantra exegesis in Tantric literature (Iyer 1992, 98-180).  The concept of pratibhā, or the intuitive linguistic power, becomes the cosmic procreative force in the Trika Śaiva doctrine, allowing the interpretation of speech at four levels, placing parā or pratibhā at the heart of the evolution of speech.</p>
<p>In Bhartrhari’s paradigm, there is no distinction between word and its powers that materialize reality. Because of this intimate relationship between the absolute and the word principle, one who is aware of the reality of the word principle is said to realize the absolute (Sastri, 1991, 1-33).  In the absence of this concept that bridges the absolute and the word, the realization of the self and attaining liberation through mantra would not be possible.</p>
<p>Sphoṭa encapsulates both word and meaning: its sonic aspect is found in pronouncing the word, and its cognitive aspect is revealed through knowing its meaning.  Both sound and awareness manifest, or ‘burst forth’ (sphuṭ), out of this ‘word principle.’  This concept fits with the later Vedic notion that the threefold world is the manifestation of the three letters of Oṃ. +++(4)+++ Bhartṛhari analyzes this relationship in terms of sphoṭa and dhvani (sound), in which the internal aspect is identified as the cause of the real meaning, while the external form is revealed through articulation.  Dhvanis are “all-pervasive and imperceptible particles which, when amassed by the movement of the articulatory organs, becomes gross and perceptible sounds and are then called nāda” (Coward 1980, 74).  Tantras give sophisticated structure to nāda and derive the meaning of mantras, not only by segmenting it according to its letters, but also by analyzing subtle resonances found in the course of reciting the mantra (Padoux 1990, 86-165).+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The Tantric understanding of mantra substantially depends upon the concept that there are various levels of speech.  Following this principle, audible speech is merely the external form of the word principle that manifests first in its self-revealing stage identified as paśyantī and is experienced in the mediating ground (madhyamā) before it becomes articulated.  Addressed briefly by Bhartṛhari, the concept of the levels of speech dominates the exegesis of mantra in Trika Śaiva and other Tantric traditions.  Tantras add the category of the ‘supreme’ (parā) form of speech, describing it as consciousness itself, pulsating eternally, giving rise to both linguistic and material manifestation.  This word principle is recognized as the non-dual awareness being aware of itself.  In this self-awareness of speech, all that is to be cognized is cognized, and this is the foundation for the rise and collapse of names and forms (Padoux 1991, 172-204).</p>
<p>The self-seeing (paśyan) word principle, the śabda Brahman, appears as the first pulsation and orientation toward creation.  Tantras identify it as subsequent to supreme speech, awareness itself.  Mantras manifest on this foundation comprised of the forces of the word principle, where subject and object are not distinguished.  The dialogue of the primordial couple Śiva and Śakti is related to this level of speech in Tantras.  This self-seeing (payantī) speech is correlated with the power of will (icchā), which is found in consolidated form in the manifestation of the power of knowledge (jñāna) in madhyamā speech, and in the power of action (kriyā) in vaikharī speech.+++(4)+++  The duality found both in terms of subject and object, and word and meaning, appear (ā+bhās) in the madhyamā level of speech.  The letters found in the form of aham are manifest in this intermediate stage of speech, giving rise to vowels and consonants.  Although not articulated audibly, this is the ground where word and meaning assume difference, and language manifests in the mind.  The last stage, vaikharī, is the external and audible form of language (Padoux 1990, 204-216).</p>
<p>The first throb of mantra found in paśyantī is of the character of vision, and can be compared to the visionary power of the seers in their ability to see the mantras.  In other words, ‘knowing’ mantra is a singular audio-visual perception.  This hierarchy of speech allows Tantras to develop their esoteric interpretation of mantras, where the subtle sound is more powerful, and sound and cognition become one in self-awareness.</p>
<p>Mantra is the ground of speculation for both Mīmāṃsā exegesis and Bhartṛhari’s philosophy of grammar.  These ideas predate most of Tantric literature and are the bedrock in the development of the Tantric interpretation of mantras.  Furthermore, both Bhartṛhari and Trika Śaivites similarly embrace the doctrine of Ābhāsa, adopting the concept that the absolute appears in manifoldness without really being polluted or without falsely projecting non-existing entities. +++(4)+++ In other words, utilizing both Mīmāṃsā and the philosophy of Sanskrit grammar for speculation on mantra is crucial to understanding classical mantra exegesis.</p>
<h3 id="deciphering-mantras">Deciphering Mantras</h3>
<p>The Tantric exposition of mantras can be clearly presented with case studies of select mantras.  With an example of Oṃ, it is easy to identify both the inclusive layering of meanings and the exclusive and singular meaning of the same mantra found in different traditions.  With Sauṃ, the Tantric treatment of a seed mantra can be described.  The mantra of Tripurā in the Śākta tradition exemplifies the sophisticated meanings of mantras.</p>
<h4 id="praṇava">Praṇava</h4>
<p>The letter Oṃ, identified as Praṇava, is the most widely circulated mantra.  By analyzing this single syllable, the later Vedic, Smārta, and Tāntric approaches to interpret mantras can be demonstrated. In order to describe the plasticity of mantras and their meanings, it is important to know how the same mantras are understood or visualized differently in different traditions.  Praṇava makes a strong case for that as well.</p>
<p>In the later Vedic tradition, Oṃ is visualized as the seed mantra that gives rise to bhū (earth), bhuva (the middle ground), and sva (heaven).  This is also identified with the three sections of the Gāyatrī mantra, with each section considered to be the manifest form of a+u+m.+++(4)+++  MU outlines that these three letters successively refer to the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states of the self at both cosmic and individual levels.  The fourth state, awareness itself that transcends both the letters and triadic manifestation, is identified as the true nature of the self.</p>
<p>The yoga system of Patañjali considers Oṃ as the signifier of Īśvara, the particular puruṣa who is never stained by the limiting factors such as kleśa, karmavipāka, or āśaya.  Īśvara is never bound by ignorance, the conditioned I-sense, passion, aversion, or death, and is eternally omniscient.  Patañjali maintains that the repetition of Oṃ is the contemplation of its meaning, which is Īśvara.  To contemplate the meaning of Īśvara is to contemplate his attributes.</p>
<p>Tantras describe nine subtler layers in addition to the three letters of Oṃ.  Identified as bindu, ardhacandra, nirodhikā, nāda, nādānta, śakti, vyāpinī, samanā, and unmanā, these stages refer to very subtle moments of time, all of which are to be visualized while pronouncing the mantra.  Their location within the body, their visualization and correlation with specific deities, are all considered part of the meaning of Oṃ.  Tantras also specify the seer, the meter, and the deity of Oṃ for meditation (PST 19.3).</p>
<p>Following another description, the deity of Oṃ is lord Viṣṇu, visualized sitting atop a lotus and having four arms, one carrying a lotus, mace, disc, and conch shell (PST 19.4).  Confirming Vaiṣṇava cosmogony, four aspects of Oṃ are associated with Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha (PST 19.😎).</p>
<p>In light of these descriptions, the meaning of Oṃ appears to be the prescribed visualization that varies with each tradition.  In other words, whatever is supposed to be brought forth in the mind when Oṃ is recited is the meaning of Oṃ.  Patañjali refers to positive attributes such as omniscience as the subject matter for contemplation, whereas Tantras build a hierarchy of subtle grounds and describe this as the meaning.  Deities to be visualized in each of the Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, or Śākta traditions differ, and this visualization is identified as the meaning.  Explicitly, the meaning of Oṃ cannot be separated from the context of recitation.  +++(4)+++</p>
<h4 id="parā-mantra">Parā Mantra</h4>
<p>The syllable sauḥ, identified as the mantra of the goddess Parā, demonstrates how Tantras build up visualization and consider that to be the meaning of the mantra.  Following PT, the seed mantra sauḥ is the heart of the Godhead, Bhairava (PT 9).  Just as a seed contains the tree in its seminal form, following the text, so does the seed mantra, as it is the heart of all the mantras (PT 24).</p>
<ul>
<li>Of the three letters of the mantra, s+au+ḥ, the first is described as referring to sat, or being, and to the god of emanation, Brahmā.</li>
<li>The second letter identifies the trident and that in turn, the triadic powers of the Godhead.</li>
<li>The last letter, identified as visarga (emission), describes the successive rise of awareness emerging from the procreative aspect with the powers of impulse, cognition, and action, the three energies springing from the consciousness of Bhairava (Padoux 1990, 416-422).</li>
</ul>
<p>In two different processes of visualization, the world is considered to be emanating from and returning to this seed mantra that describes the process of cosmic pulsation.  Self-awareness is at the core of both emission and retraction, as it is the heart or the foundation of both the cognitive process and physical world.  The meaning of the mantra includes the visualization of both Kuṇḍalinī and a trident inside the channels of the flow of prāṇa.  Essentially, recognizing self-awareness as the foundation of cosmic pulsation giving rise to the world is the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<h4 id="tripurā-mantra">Tripurā Mantra</h4>
<p>Tripurā is one of the most widely worshipped deities among Tantric practitioners.  There are two main mantras in this practice, also identified as Śrī Vidyā:</p>
<p>Kādi: ka-e-ī-la-hrīṃ-ha-sa-ka-ha-la-hrīṃ-sa-ka-la-hrīṃ</p>
<p>Hādi: ha-sa-ka-la-hrīṃ-ha-sa-ka-ha-la-hrīṃ-sa-ka-la-hrīṃ</p>
<p>YH gives preliminary visualizations for reciting the mantra, including the visualization of cakras or various centers within the body, and the equinoxes (viṣuva) that indicate the vitality of the prāṇa (life force), the mind, and the mantra itself.  The first viṣuva, identified as prāṇa, refers to the visualization of the flow of prāṇa.  The second, identified as mantra, refers to the middle ground in which mind dissolves into the sound rising from the base cakra.  The practitioner focuses on one sound that envelops all letters of the mantra, visualizing all the letters merging into and emanating from the single sound.  The third, identified as nāḍi, is the identification of the channels within the body that manifest the sound.  In visualizing the viṣuva called praśānta, the mind rests in the śakti state that is beyond sound and its foundation.  The next one, kāla refers to the visualization of sound transcending time.  In the final tattva-viṣuva, one visualizes the essential nature of the self (Timalsina 2005, 221-224).</p>
<p>Following YH, the mantra possesses six layers of meaning.</p>
<h5 id="1">1</h5>
<p>The first, identified as ‘essential meaning’ (bhāvārtha), refers to the constellation of deities corresponding to the limbs of the mantra.  As the mantra in totality refers to the goddess Tripurasundarī, its limbs are correlated with specific divinities, and the ‘essential meaning’ refers to the awareness of this relationship. The integral step of visualizing the five gross elements such as earth, and the five subtle elements such as smell, constitutes a part of mantra’s meaning.  The embodiment of fifteen deities that correspond to the lunar cycle layers further meaning upon the mantra.  Finally, the I-sense (aham) is the essence of the mantra, with ‘a’ referring to light (prakāśa), and ‘ha’ referring to awareness (vimarśa).</p>
<h5 id="2">2</h5>
<p>The second, the ‘lineage-meaning’ (sampradāya), is shared within the community and imparted by teacher to disciple.  To visualize this, YH describes the successive correspondence of the letters h, k, r, s, and l to sky, air, fire, water, and earth.  From these letters manifest the subtle elements such as smell or touch, numbering fifteen in total, each with a different arrangement of the proportions of the five elements.  The powers dormant in these elements are the manifestations of Śakti and are signified by the letter h, and the entities themselves are identified as Śiva and signified by the letter a.  Once again, a+h, referring to I-awareness, is the essence of all that exists, and is also the essence of the meaning imparted within the lineage.  This awareness is felt by establishing correspondence between the letters of the mantra with the 36 categories accepted in Śaivite traditions.  Besides referring to all the principles, the letters of the mantra also indicate the evolving states of self-awareness.  Self-experience endowed with limited will, knowledge, and action is identified as the sakala stage.  Above this are the vijñānākala and pralayākala stages, where the aspects of action and knowledge are sequentially unbound.  The stages, mantra, mantreśvara, and mantra-maheśvara refer to the higher stages of awareness where, through realization of oneself as the mantra and the deity of the mantra, one recognizes the self as the supreme divinity.+++(4)+++  Adopting this interpretation, mantra is no longer words or sentences but the very self-awareness of the practitioner.  The rising awareness that transcends sound and mind is also considered to be an integral part of the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<h5 id="3">3</h5>
<p>The third meaning, nigarbha (embryonic), refers to the awareness that the deity of the mantra, instructor, and aspirant are all essentially identical.  Explicitly, all of the above meanings stress the identity of the mantra and the deity, the aspirant and the mantra, and the mentor and the deity.  In both first and second meanings, mantra is equated to self-awareness identical to the cosmic awareness, and the divine union of Śiva and Śakti.  The third meaning further highlights the same oneness, confirming that the meaning of mantra is not isolated from the self-awareness of the practitioner.  Essentially, elevation of self-experience to the higher planes that allows the aspirant to feel his presence in all that exists is the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<h5 id="4">4</h5>
<p>The fourth meaning, kaulika, is shared among the initiates.  Added to the sequence of above visualizations, this meaning confirms the identity of the self with the maṇḍala, its deity, the mantra, and the master.  Here, the body is visualized as the constellation of all 36 categories.  The identity of the mantra and maṇḍala is found through visualization of the select letters of the mantra as distinct parts of the maṇḍala.  For instance, the letter h refers to two sets of ten triangles and the outer layer of fourteen triangles of the Śrī Cakra.  The deities associated with the letters, and the planets and lunar mansions installed in the body are considered integral parts of kaulika meaning.</p>
<h5 id="5">5</h5>
<p>The ‘esoteric’ (rahasya) meaning, in the same sequence reveals the awareness that mantra and Kuṇḍalinī are identical.  The visualization of the cosmic force dormant within the practitioner’s body thus becomes an integral part of the meaning of the mantra.</p>
<h5 id="6">6</h5>
<p>Finally, the ‘supreme meaning’ (mahārtha), is the recognition that the aspirant and the cosmic force that permeates all that exists is one and the same.  With this realization, the aspirant, while living in the body, finds his self-awareness identical to the divinity, and his bodily experience permeating all that exists (Timalsina 2005, 224-232).</p>
<h5 id="observations">Observations</h5>
<p>Some observations can be made based on the above discussion of meaning.  As highlighted already, ‘meaning’ here is mental rather than its correspondence to external objects, and knowing meaning is transformative rather than informative.  It is the self, not objects, that is visualized and confirmed as the meaning of the mantra.  Knowing the meaning here is not simply knowing the way things are, but changing their previously cognized condition.  As mantra is envisioned, so is its meaning.  Understanding a mantra, following this, is a purely cognitive process that does not depend upon external reality for identifying the relationship between signifier and signified.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-approaches">Contemporary Approaches</h3>
<h4 id="mantras-are-meaningless">Mantras are meaningless</h4>
<p>Fritz Staal analyzes the Vedic rituals in great detail and makes the observation concerning ritual and mantra that these are essentially meaningless.  The core of his arguments is that the Vedic ritual context provides mantric identity.  As mantras can be broken into pieces and applied in various ritual contexts, they do not have inherent meaning.  He further argues that mantras are like music or the chirrups of birds.+++(4)+++  He cites the stobha and bīja mantras, wherein a plain linguistic meaning is hard to imagine.  In the context of mantras with visible meaning, he argues that it is not the content that constitutes it as mantra, because the translation of mantras are, after all, not applied in rituals.</p>
<p>This understanding of meaning is a part of his theory that “ritual is pure activity, without meaning or goal . . . To say that ritual is for its own sake is to say that it is meaningless, without function, aim, or goal, or also that it constitutes its own aim or goal.  It does not follow that it has no value: but whatever value it has is intrinsic value” (Staal 1996, 131-2).  He considers ritual as ‘a mere activity performed by animals in accordance with rules’ (Staal 1996, 137), and argues that finding the meaning of ritual is human rationalization.  As mantras are considered to be rules within the context of rituals, he comes to the conclusion that mantras are devoid of meaning.  He contrasts the nature of mantra with that of language that is in flux, as mantras are supposed to be handed down without any change.</p>
<p>Scholars have criticized this position primarily by demonstrating the presence of meaning in many mantras.  Traditionally, all mantras have meaning, whether visible or invisible.  It is explicit that there are two tendencies, one to read mantras linguistically and second, that highlights the alinguistic aspect of mantras.  There is a flaw in Staal’s assumption that mantras in the earliest stage are bīja mantras, and in their intermediate stage are two dimensional arrangements such as hā bu hā bu, and in the final stage are the mantras that are subject to semantic, further syntactic and different syntactic constraints (Staal 1996, 266).  The mantras classified as ‘final’ appear first in the Vedic texts, and the bīja mantras appear historically in the last phase in Tantric literature.  Even among mantras found in the Āgamas, the bīja mantras are relatively earlier than the kūṭa mantras.</p>
<p>What is missing in this discussion is that meaning is always internally constructed.  To determine whether something has meaning or not, it is necessary to know whether its user meant something by it or not.  The mantra tradition overwhelmingly indicates that mantras have meaning.</p>
<p>It is true that mantras are used in fragments and are often removed from their original context.  But it is also true that the whole body of the mantra text is considered to be an unbroken mantra.  For example, DM is used in segments in the ritual context.  However, the entire story of the goddess found in DM is also considered as a single mantra.  In this case, the myth of the victory of the goddess becomes the essential meaning of the mantra.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mantras are found in flux in vernacular and indigenous traditions with dhāmīs, jhãkrīs, and other shamans often arbitrarily manipulating the mantras.  Healers are also found telling stories that do not require exact repetition of words.  Arguably, even the Vedic mantra tradition may not necessarily be a rigid system in its fluid stage of origination.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Tantric texts often elaborate upon mantras.  One example in this context is how the kūṭa mantras are treated.  Assigned successively for the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and sky, the kūṭa-mantra la-va-ra-ya-haṃ collectively refers to the five principal elements.  Although there is no syntactic meaning to the kūṭa, it functions as an indicator of something else, the five elements.  In the same way, the kūṭa mantra, ‘ḍa-ra-la-ka-sa-ha,’ refers to six Yoginis visualized in the six cakras.  Again, this kūṭa functions as an acronym and by repeating the mantra, one is collectively invoking all the Yoginīs.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Mantras are frequently encoded in the Āgama texts, and to read them, it is always necessary that they be ‘extracted’ (uddhāra).  This process of decipherment identifies the two-way, reciprocal process of mantras: first, mantras are derived by segmenting letters from words, and then their meaning is conceived of as hidden within the letters.  This dual process of deciphering mantras and arriving at their meaning depends upon contemplation itself as an integral part of the meaning of mantras.</p>
<p>Moreover, the concept that ritual context gives mantra its identity contradicts the Vedic understanding that ‘mantra is pronounced by seers.’  The Vedic verses have apparently obtained their identity as mantras even prior to their application in rituals.+++(5)+++  This also contradicts the context wherein mantra itself is the ritual and when there is no other ceremony or ritual except for repeating the mantra.</p>
<h4 id="mantras-are-speech-acts">Mantras are ‘speech acts’</h4>
<p>Wheelock and Alper propose that mantras are ‘speech acts,’ taking for granted that mantra is a form of language (Wheelock 1991, 96-122; Alper 1991, 249-294).  Following the theory of Austin and Searle that linguistic expression not only reveals thought but necessarily involves accomplishing some purposeful act, religious language transforms the objects involved in the ritual.  The meaning of mantra here rests on ritual function.  Accepting that mantras are applied in order to generate thought instead of common language, where language is used to express thought, the meaning of mantra is found in its ability to transform the cognitive paradigm of the agents involved in performing rituals.</p>
<p>In plain words, ‘speech act’ is a theory of the communicative aspect of language that requires linguistic utterance.  The underlying principle is that the minimal unit of human communication is a performance of certain acts and not a sentence or other expression.  It is through communication that statements are made, questions asked, orders given, or things described.  We apologize, explain, thank, or congratulate in communication, and these are the acts carried out through utterance.  In essence, we do something by saying something.  Speech act is always dialogical and inter-subjective, and it avoids the solipsistic character of speculative or psychological analysis.</p>
<p>Wheelock argues that mantric utterance involves accomplishing some purposeful act.  He distinguishes ritual language from common language by pointing out that language used in the former can hardly be the communication of information (Wheelock 1991, 99).  He then says that ‘mantra is a good case of this general point about liturgical utterances’ (Wheelock 1991, 100).  He highlights the transformative aspect of ritual performance and demonstrates that invocation, praise, and petition are the acts carried out by mantric utterance (Wheelock 1991, 101-117).  The essence of the acts carried out in uttering mantras, in his opinion, is ‘to pay homage to the gods’ (Wheelock 1991, 121).</p>
<h5 id="problems-with-speech-act-theory">Problems with ‘Speech Act’ Theory</h5>
<p>Although the application of ‘speech act’ theory addresses the cognitive dimension of mantras, it does not incorporate the aspect of sound highlighted by Staal.  Neither does it address the inherent meaning of mantras built within the traditions.  The act of summoning or invocation can be conducted without comprehending intrinsic meaning.  For instance, summoning a pet dog named ‘Tiger’ does not depend upon knowing the conventional meaning of the term. +++(4)+++</p>
<p>The concept of ‘speech act’ depends on the dualistic model of reality and a dialogical nature of mantric utterance.  Most Tantric doctrines are monistic, highlighting identity between the agent articulating mantra, the deity, and the mantra itself.  Although Tantras present the revelation of mantras in the dialogical sphere of paśyantī, demonstrating the inter-subjective aspect of mantric utterance, dialogue in paśyantī is internal, subjective, and not between two human agents.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Furthermore, mantras are not always ‘uttered.’  Although following classical Indian linguistic philosophy, the parā, paśyantī, or madhyamā are considered to be the subtle layers of linguistic expression, this is not what Austin and Searle have in mind when they propose the theory of ‘speech act.’  The communicative domain is either silent or subjective in the context of mantric utterance.  Mantras are said to be more and more powerful as they are internalized. +++(4)+++ This cannot be the case of communicative language.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘mantra’ presupposes the concept of ‘śakti,’ that certain speech has certain power.  Tantras, while describing this power, do not highlight the meaning embodied in the words but dissolve the mantra into letters, claiming that the power of the mantra is the constellation of the powers of the ‘mothers’ (mātṛkā), or letters.  The concept of ‘force’ found in the discussion of Austin and Searle is completely different from the Mīmāṃsā or Tantric understanding of śakti.</p>
<p>There are additional problems in reading mantras as ‘speech acts’ within the paradigm of Advaita Vedānta.  ‘Speech act does not describe or report anything at all’  (Findly 1991, 27).  Upaniṣạdic mantras, such as ‘Brahman is of the character of truth, knowledge, and endlessness,’ on the other hand, describe attributes of the Brahman that are to be contemplated for self-realization.  Furthermore, within the paradigm of ‘speech act,’ ‘uttering of a sentence is a part of action’ (Findly 1991, 27).  Following the Advaita doctrine, realization of the meaning of the Upaniṣadic sentences that explain the nature of the self is not an ‘act:’ the self knowing itself is not an action, as the distinction between subject and object is a requirement in actions, whereas when the self knows itself, there are not two entities, one knowing the other.</p>
<h4 id="mantras-as-signs">Mantras as Signs</h4>
<p>Another theory to analyze mantras is that these are the signs through which the divine is comprehended.  Brooks considers mantras as an indication of the dispositional powers of the divine, and argues that the indexical function of particular signs follows the assertion of the real presence of divinity (Brooks 1992, 84-85).  Following Pierce’s thesis that the sign stands for something, Brooks interprets that the body of the goddess and the mantra correspond to the corporeal and subtle bodies of the divine (Brooks 1992, 82).  This argument can be further advanced following Derrida’s understanding of signs that “the sign and divinity have the same place and time of birth.  The age of the sign is essentially theological.  Perhaps it will never end.” (Derrida 1994, 14).  In defense of this argument, one can add that Tantras often utilize terminology such as ‘indication’ (saṅketa) while discussing mantras, address symbolism of iconic forms, and describe mantras as representing divinity.</p>
<p>Although applicable when analyzing the mantra literature from a distance, there are crucial problems even in imposing this idea to read mantras.  The fundamental problem lies in the difference between sign and what it stands for.  As has been demonstrated, the exegetes interpreting mantras repeatedly establish identity between mantra and the divinity.  One of the identified meanings of Śrī Vidyā is that the aspirant, the mantra, and the goddess are identical.  Although perfectly feasible in a dualistic paradigm, the monistic worldview of Tantric philosophers and the inherent difference between sign and sign-holder pose contradictions.  To argue that mantras are signs and to establish identity would be something similar to establishing that the driver, the highway signs, and the highway are identical.</p>
