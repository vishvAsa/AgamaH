title = "Note on Spelling and Pronunciation of Mantras"

+++

The book uses the ‘transliterated Sanskrit alphabet’ to indicate the proper pronunciation of the mantras. Please note that the transliterated alphabet has its own phonetics that are not always equivalent to how these letters are pronounced in English. Sanskrit letters do not always correspond with English letters or even with English phonetics. This transliterated alphabet, though perhaps a little cumbersome to use at first, allows us to pronounce Sanskrit correctly.

However, for Sanskrit terms that are not approached as mantras in the book and may already be part of the English language, like Purusha or Shakti, I have not used the transliterated alphabet.

Please take the time to learn the basic sounds of the Sanskrit alphabet in order to pronounce the mantras correctly. Note the description of the transliterated alphabet at the end of the book. Be willing to take as much time with Sanskrit as you would any other language that has a different pronunciation. The rewards of such diligence will be unlimited in Mantra Yoga\!
