title = "Orientation of the Book"

+++

1\) The first section of the book explores the background of Mantra Yoga, the use of mantra for improving our karmas or actions in life, and the profound philosophy that mantra is based upon. This is to enable the reader to approach the practicalities of mantras with awareness, insight and discrimination.

2\) The second section explains the main bija mantras, starting with the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, leading up to the Mantra Purusha or body of sound, which is a very important practice in Mantra Yoga that has not been afforded much examination in the existing literature. Shakti bija mantras are also explored in detail, along with their application with the Mantra Purusha. This can help the reader understand the energies and indications of the bija mantras that they are using and how to adapt them for greater efficacy.

3\) The third section explores the main methods of Mantra Yoga starting with mantra and pranayama, mantra and traditional Kundalini Yoga, and the use of Divine names and Bhakti Yoga. It is followed by the application of Mantra therapy in the Vedic sciences of Ayurvedic medicine, Vedic astrology, Vastu \(directional science\), and the Vedic usage of mantras overall.

4\) The appendix contains advanced technical material as well as background resources, including reference to a series of mantra CDs of Yogini Shambhavi Chopra that can help with the pronunciation of the mantras in the book.
