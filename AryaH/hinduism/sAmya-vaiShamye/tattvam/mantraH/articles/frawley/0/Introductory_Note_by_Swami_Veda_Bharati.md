Those who know \(vidvaamsah\) will confirm that the works of Shri Vamadeva Shastri are distinguished by their authenticity. This is so because they are based on \(1\) his personal quest and experience \(2\) deep dwelling into the texts and \(3\) oral learning received from many authentic teachers who are experts in their areas of knowledge. Shri Vamadeva Shastri has done this great service to many that he has offered access into knowledge that was often hitherto inaccessible to an average western seeker. He has done so not merely as a scholar of ‘words, lexicons and translations’, sometimes dubbed in the traditional circles of India as modern ‘index aachaaryas’. They provided profound research tools with their untiring efforts. It is a matter of profound delight that we can use their work as well as the first hand of knowledge of the keepers of the Traditions. Those who wish to dive deep into the spiritual treasure beyond words are now more and more highly recognized even in academic circles. Shri Vamadeva Shastri is of the generation that now respects the Traditions and articulates the ancient knowledge of those who would otherwise remain inarticulate because they do not always speak the languages of our contemporary world power structures. The present work on Mantra-yoga by Shri Vamadeva Shastri is a delight to read as it leaves out no corner of multigonic truths unexplored with regard to the complex science of mantras.

Attached to the mantras is always a pra-yoga-shastra, the science of their application. Shri Shastri has given glimpses of these applications. The true details are to be learnt not by a student but by a disciple who submits to traditional disciplines under an accomplished guide.

An example of such pra-yoga-shastra is Rg-vidhana of the Rishi Shaunaka. This very ancient text gives the applications of only a select number of hymns and mantras of Rg-veda, out of the 10,000 mantras of Rg-veda. For the hymns selected, the sage Shaunaka not only states the power of each hymn, the end-result of using the mantra, but also, most important, how the mantra is to be used, for example with what kind of wood the fire offerings with that mantra are to be performed, how many times, with what herbal oblations, and so forth. It may even prescribe the posture in which one should sit for such endeavour.

In the age of instant fixes, those who know the disciplines are often disinclined to give out the knowledge to those whose very long term dedication to a discipline is not yet proven. For instance, in writing the above paragraph on the work of Shaunaka, I am not revealing, for example, which hymn may be mentally recited, with what fire offerings, if one wishes to remember one’s past life or if one wishes that the knowledge of this life may be remembered in the next life. Who will follow the discipline of correct daily schedule, the attitude of devotion-- not mechanical recitation – and sit in the prescribed posture at the prescribed hours of the day ?

Can I become a doctor by reading one book on medical science? Can I start prescribing, even to oneself, ayurvedic medicines after reading one book? Can one choose a mantra for oneself so as ‘one’s spouse would begin to listen to him/her\!’

What we write in modern languages is often an appetiser; for an invitation to the full feast, may each reader become an adhikarin. Shri Vamadeva Shastri’s work guides one on the path to becoming a qualified disciple. Congratulations to those who would truly pursue the Path of nih-shreyasa \(summum bonum\), the Supreme Good.
