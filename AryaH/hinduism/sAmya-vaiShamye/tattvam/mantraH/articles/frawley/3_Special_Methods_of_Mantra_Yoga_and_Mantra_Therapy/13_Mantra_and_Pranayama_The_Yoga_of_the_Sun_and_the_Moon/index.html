Uniting prana, our power of action, with the mind, our power of knowledge, integrates us back into the source of our being.

  <p>Pranayama and mantra naturally go together and work best in combination. Using a mantra along with pranayama unites the mind and prana, drawing our attention and awareness into the breathing process. It can turn pranayama into meditation, as well as bring energy, vitality and wakefulness into the repetition of the mantra. Uniting prana, our power of action, with the mind, our power of knowledge, integrates us back into the source of our being. Prana gives Shakti to the mantra and makes it alive and vibrating within our entire body.</p>
<p>The sound of the breath is our most natural and constant outer mantra, we could say. The sound of our heart beat, which is connected to the sound of the breath, is our most natural internal mantra. An important goal of mantra practice is to get one&rsquo;s mantra to resonate with the breath, so it is naturally repeated, strengthened and deepened along with every breath that we take – and then to get it to resonate with every heart beat, so that our heart beat is the beat of the mantra.</p>
<p>There are many ways of using mantra with the breath. The following chapter emphasizes repeating bija mantras along with the breath, though longer mantras can be used as well. Bija mantras have the greatest affinity with the breath and are said to be &ldquo;prana predominant&rdquo;; whereas longer mantras are &ldquo;meaning predominant&rdquo; and require more contemplation in their usage.</p>
<p>We will examine alternate nostril breathing and breathing through both nostrils along with the use of bija mantras. We will focus on the sibilants (s and h-sounds), semi-vowels (ya, ra, la, va) and Shakti bijas to enhance and transform the practice of pranayama.</p>
<p>More specifically, we will explore the balancing of solar and lunar, male and female, Shiva and Shakti energies known as the &ldquo;Yoga of the Sun and the Moon&rdquo;. This balancing of solar and lunar energies within us is the basis of traditional Hatha Yoga in which &ldquo;<em>Ha</em>&rdquo; means the Sun and &ldquo;<em>Tḥa</em>&rdquo; means the Moon. Traditional Hatha Yoga is the ‘Yoga of the Sun and the Moon’, using mantra and pranayama to balance the two forces and bring about transformation. It is not an asana centered practice such as the term is used for today.1 As such, traditional Hatha Yoga is the foundation of deeper Tantric Yoga practices.</p>
<h2 id="using-mantras-to-count-the-breath">Using Mantras to Count the Breath</h2>
<p>Regardless of the type of pranayama that one follows, mantras repeated mentally can be used for counting the breath. Bija mantras like <em>Oṁ</em> or <em>Hrīṁ</em> can be repeated a certain number of times along with the breathing process, like 8 repetitions on inhalation, 4 on retention or 8 on exhalation, or multiples thereof. Longer mantras can be used in the same way. For example, the Gayatri mantra of 24 syllables can be repeated with the first 8 syllables on inhalation, the second 8 syllables on retention and the third 8 upon exhalation.</p>
<p>It is better to use mantras to count the breath rather than to use numbers as some groups do. Numbers lack the resonance of mantras and can put the mind into a dull or mechanical state. Repetition of mantras increases our mental energy while that of numbers tends to reduce it. The mantra can be energized with the power of devotion or knowledge, which a number cannot.</p>
<h2 id="aham-pranayama-the-sound-of-the-self">Aham Pranayama: the Sound of the Self</h2>
<p>In Tantric philosophy, inhalation as an open sound relates to the vowels, specifically to the vowel-A, the first and most important of the Sanskrit vowels. Exhalation as a closing sound relates to the consonants, semivowels and sibilants, specifically to the letter-Ha, which is the last of the Sanskrit letters and governs prana as a whole. Extending this principle, the sound &ldquo;<em>A</em>&rdquo; relates to inhalation, while the sound &ldquo;<em>Ha</em>&rdquo; relates to exhalation. Try this for yourself. Mentally repeat the sound &ldquo;<em>A</em>&rdquo; on inhalation and &ldquo;<em>Ha</em>&rdquo; on exhalation and feel the energies involved.2 This means that the entire Sanskrit alphabet is inherent in your breath.</p>
<p>The word <em>Ahaṁ</em> means &ldquo;<em>I</em>&rdquo; in Sanskrit. Repeating the <em>Ahaṁ</em> mantra along with the breath (A for inhalation and Ha for exhalation), we naturally attune ourselves to the ultimate sound of the breath which is &ldquo;<em>I-I</em>&rdquo;, meaning “I am I “or “I am the Self of all beings.” This utterance of <em>Ahaṁ</em> or I is the original and highest level of speech.3</p>
<p>All words, all thoughts and the breath itself naturally begin with the sense of I. The sense of Self, which is the root of consciousness, comes first, then the mind comes into being and through it we can see the outer world.</p>
<p><em>Ahaṁ</em> is reflected on all levels of our nature. Speech is <em>Ahaṁ</em>, with A as the first letter and <em>Ha</em> the last letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. Breath is <em>Ahaṁ</em>, with A as inhalation and Ha as exhalation. Thought is <em>Ahaṁ</em>. The I-thought or <em>Ahaṁ</em> is the root of all thoughts. The I-thought reflects the original prana that rises from the heart, of which it is a manifestation. Our true Self consists of the nature of <em>Ahaṁ</em> beyond speech, breath and mind. Through the <em>Ahaṁ</em> mantra, everything is comprehended. <em>Ahaṁkara</em> or the &ldquo;I process&rdquo; is the Sanskrit word for ego, as opposed to the Self which is <em>Ahaṁsvarūpa</em> or the Self-nature. <em>Ahaṁkara</em> at a cosmic level is the main power of external creation through which the mind, five sense organs, five motor organs and five sense qualities (tanmatras) are differentiated. The *Ahaṁkara Tattva *or cosmic principle in Yoga philosophy is defined in terms of the Sanskrit alphabet.4</p>
<p>Division arises through sound which proceeds through the alphabet. This means that through reciting the Sanskrit alphabet, or just repeating the <em>Ahaṁ</em> mantra, and turning within, one can integrate all the cosmic principles as well as all aspects of mind, senses and pranas and return to pure unity.</p>
<p>Practice the <em>Ahaṁ</em> mantra along with a silent meditation on pure being or pure consciousness, the eternal presence. Contact the current of the Self as the I-thought, the origin of breath and speech in the heart. &ldquo;*Ahaṁ *Mantra Meditation&rdquo; is one of the most direct means of Self-realization.5 It keeps the energy of the breath in the hridaya or spiritual heart that encompasses all that is.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-solar-and-lunar-energies-on-the-right-and-left-sides-of-the-body">Balancing Solar and Lunar Energies on the Right and Left Sides of the Body</h2>
<p>The basic ignorance and suffering inherent in human life occurs owing to the fact that our minds and prana are caught in dualistic and contrary forces. These dualities consist of the various attractions and repulsions, likes and dislikes, desires and fears that keep us disturbed and agitated. Yoga requires balancing these dualistic forces, to lead us to a state of unity where there is lasting peace within us.</p>
<p>This duality of thought and emotion is reflected in the body as a division of solar and lunar energies, the right Pingala and left Ida nadis or subtle channels, fire and water, Prana and Apana (ingoing and outgoing aspects of prana), and Pitta and Kapha doshas, the biological fire and water humors in Ayurveda.</p>
<p>• The right solar or Pingala nadi relates to the right nostril and right side of the body, and is accordingly warming, drying, stimulating and detoxifying in its effects.</p>
<p>• The left, lunar or Ida nadi relates to the left nostril and the left side of the body and is accordingly cooling, moistening, calming, nourishing and tonifying in its action.</p>
<p>In addition, in Tantric Yoga, lunar energy generally relates to inhalation, which has a similar nourishing effect as the Ida nadi, particularly for the sense organs that like inhalation serve to take in prana. Solar energy relates to exhalation, which has a similar expressive force as the Pingala nadi, particularly for the motor organs that like exhalation consist primarily of pranic discharges.6 But this is a matter of degree. There are solar types of inhalation and lunar types of exhalation, among the many different types of Tantric Yoga pranayamas.7</p>
<p>Our energies fluctuate between these dualistic forces, though one side usually predominates overall. Pitta dosha people, those with a fiery temperament in Ayurvedic thought, will have the breath more commonly flowing through the right nostril. Kapha dosha people, those of a watery temperament, will find the breath to flow more through the left nostril. Vata dosha types, those with airy temperaments, will more commonly find their breath fluctuating back and forth between the right and left nostrils.</p>
<p>Pranayama can be used to balance the two forces, particularly alternate nostril breathing called Nadi Shodhana in Sanskrit or &ldquo;cleansing the channels&rdquo;. The solar and lunar divisions of the breath can be connected with bija mantras of a solar or lunar nature for a greater effect.

<p>Samkhya Karika of Ishvara Krishna, verse 22, Matharvritti commentary identifies the Cosmic Ahamkara principle with the Sanskrit alphabet. Note the Self-inquiry method of Ramana Maharshi, which emphasizes tracing the root of all thoughts back to the I-thought in the heart.2 Note the idea of lunar inhalation and solar exhalation in the works of Abhinavagupta, the main teacher of Tantric Kashmiri Shaivism, Para Trisika Vivarana, pps 263-264.3 There are various yogic kriyas involving pranayama and mantra for guiding the energies of Fire (Kundalini), Moon (Soma), Sun (Surya) and Lightning (Vidyut) up and down the spine or to different chakras, depending upon the stage of practice and the development of the Yogi. How inhalation and exhalation function depends upon which specific energies one may be drawing in or releasing out. Balancing solar and lunar energies, however, is fundamental to all of these yogic pranayamas.</p>
<p><em><strong>So&rsquo;haṁ Pranayama</strong></em></p>
<p>*So&rsquo;haṁ Pranayama <em>is probably the most common form of Mantra Pranayama. It consists of letting the sound So resound naturally on inhalation and the sound <em>Haṁ</em> on exhalation, following them in the sound of the breath itself. Adding the vowel-O, whose energy is opening and expansive, to the consonant-Sa, which draws energy inward, allows the inhalation to be wide and expansive. So inhalation increases the lunar nurturing energy of the breath. Ha</em>ṁ *as exhalation sends energy outward into the realm of action and increases the solar stimulating aspect of the breath. In the most basic form of <em>So&rsquo;haṁ</em> Pranayama, one allows the breath to naturally deepen, while mentally repeating these mantras and listening to them in the sound of the breath.</p>
<p>The mantra <em>So&rsquo;haṁ</em> is a great statement of spiritual knowledge. So or Sa means &ldquo;He&rdquo; as the higher Self, the Atman. <em>Haṁ</em> is short for <em>Ahaṁ</em> meaning &ldquo;I&rdquo;, myself. This natural sound then is saying that&quot; He (the higher Self) am I&quot; or &ldquo;I am God or pure consciousness&rdquo;. In this way, our breath becomes our inner guide and guru, ever teaching us our oneness with all. Many Yogis have gained Self-realization through the <em>So</em>&rsquo;<em>haṁ</em> mantra alone. One can also use the <em>So&rsquo;haṁ</em> mantra to draw the prana up the chakras one by one, chanting the mantra at each chakra step by step from the root chakra to the crown chakra.8</p>
<p><em><strong>Haṁsaḥ Pranayama</strong></em></p>
<p>Vedic thought contains many wonderful and cryptic symbols. One of the most poignant and beautiful is the image of the hamsa, which outwardly means a swan. The hamsa symbolizes the bird of the soul. It is said to be golden in color and to reside in the heart. It is identified with the Sun, which is a symbol of both the soul (Atman) and prana. This bird of the soul rests upon the breath. Its two wings are exhalation and inhalation, Ha and Sa.</p>
<p>The Upanishads state, “With the sound Ha, one moves outward. With Sa, one moves in again. The individual soul repeats the mantra *Haṁsaḥ, Haṁsaḥ, *all the time, 21,600 times in the course of the day.9 This is called the spontaneous Gayatri (ajapa Gayatri), which ever grants liberation to the Yogis.”10</p>
<p>We can look at the <em>Haṁsaḥ</em> mantra as <em>So&rsquo;haṁ</em> in another form, with Ha as exhalation and Sa as inhalation. However, some Yogis reverse the natural order of <em>So&rsquo;haṁ</em> and use Ha for inhalation and Sa for exhalation. While <em>So-haṁ</em> for inhalation and exhalation naturally deepens the breath, <em>Haṁ-saḥ</em> for inhalation and exhalation adds additional fire to the breath.</p>
<p><em><strong>Haṁsaḥ So&rsquo;haṁ Pranayama</strong></em></p>
<p>We can combine these two prana mantras together as <em>Haṁsaḥ So&rsquo;haṁ</em>. This helps balance the solar and lunar energies in the body and mind. It also affirms the unity of the individual soul with the supreme Self.</p>
<p>• The <em>So&rsquo;haṁ</em> mantra works better with alternate nostril breathing, inhaling with the left nostril and exhaling with the right.<br>
• <em>Haṁsaḥ</em> works better with inhaling with the right nostril and exhaling with the left.</p>
<p>In this practice, one breathes in through the left nostril with the mantra-So, and then out through the right nostril with the <em>mantra-Haṁ</em>. Then one breathes in through the right nostril with the <em>mantra-Haṁ</em> and out through the left nostril with the <em>mantra-Saḥ</em>. One can also use the mantra So to take the lunar energy up the spine on inhalation, and <em>Haṁ</em> to bring the solar energy down the spine on exhalation, followed by using the mantra <em>Haṁ</em> to take the solar energy up the spine on inhalation and <em>Saḥ</em> to take the lunar energy down the spine on exhalation. The *Haṁsaḥ So&rsquo;haṁ *mantra has many other applications in deeper Yoga practices, several of which will be discussed later in the book.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hrīṁ and Śrīṁ in Pranayama</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Hrīṁ</em> and <em>Śrīṁ</em> are prime Shakti mantras with important correlations to the breathing process and its solar and lunar aspects. <em>Hrīṁ</em> is the bija mantra of the Sun at an astrological level. <em>Śrīṁ</em> is the bija mantra of the Moon. The two sounds relate to the heart in terms of function (<em>Hrīṁ</em>) and substance (<em>Śrīṁ</em>), thought (<em>Hrīṁ</em>) and feeling (<em>Śrīṁ</em>). They also relate to the solar and lunar nadis (Ida and Pingala, the solar and lunar sides of the body, and the right and left eyes. Instead of using the sounds Sa and Ha, one can use the mantras <em>Śrīṁ</em> and <em>Hrīṁ</em> for a similar effect. This practice connects the energy of the breath with that of the heart.</p>
<h2 id="mantras-for-the-five-elements-and-pranayama">Mantras for the Five Elements and Pranayama</h2>
<p>Another important Mantra Pranayama method is to use the seed mantras of the five elements (la, va, ra, ya, ha). While the sibilants work more on the energy of the breath, the semi-vowels affect more the circulation of the blood that the breath sets in motion. The mantras <em>Laṁ</em> for earth, <em>Vaṁ</em> for water, <em>Raṁ</em> for fire, <em>Yaṁ</em> for air and <em>Haṁ</em> for ether, can be used along with alternate nostril breathing or with both nostril breathing. They can be employed to balance solar and lunar energies or for other purposes.</p>
<p>• <em>Haṁ</em> as the bija mantra of the ether element will tend to increase the ether energy through any nadi, chakra or marma that it is associated with, bringing in its inherent qualities of space, openness, receptivity and release.</p>
<p>• <em>Yaṁ</em> as the bija mantra of the air element will tend to increase the air energy through any nadi, chakra or marma it is associated with, bringing in its inherent qualities of stimulation, movement, change and increase of speed.</p>
<p>• <em>Raṁ</em> as the bija mantra for the fire element will tend to increase the energy of fire through any nadi, chakra, or marma it is associated with, bringing in its inherent qualities of heat, light and color.</p>
<p>• <em>Vaṁ</em> as the bija mantra for the water element will tend to increase the energy of water through any nadi, chakra or marma it is associated with, bringing in its inherent qualities of coolness, moistness, lubrication and nourishment.</p>
<p>• <em>Laṁ</em> as the bija mantra of the earth element will tend to increase the earth energy through any nadi, chakra or marma it is associated with, bringing in its inherent qualities of strength, stability, resistance and support.</p>
<p>Of these five element mantras, <em>Yaṁ</em> as the bija mantra for the air element from which prana arises, is probably most important. It aids in the flow of prana or air in any of the nadis or channel systems. Overall, it has a drying, cooling and lightening effect, reflecting the qualities of the air element. Because of the connection between prana and air, the air-mantra <em>Yaṁ</em> is widely used with pranayama to get the prana to move, as well as to dry up any blockages in the nadis. Because of the effect of wind to increase fire, <em>Yaṁ</em> can be combined with the mantra <em>Raṁ</em> to increase the energy of fire.</p>
<p><strong><em>Raṁ and Vaṁ</em>, the Bijas of Fire and Water for Balancing Solar and Lunar Energies</strong></p>
<p><em>Raṁ</em> is the bija mantra for the right side of the body, which has a fiery or solar nature. <em>Vaṁ</em> is the bija mantra for the left side of the body, which has a watery and lunar nature. Mentally repeating the mantra <em>Raṁ</em> while breathing through the right nostril will increase the fiery nature of the breath; mentally repeating the mantra Va*ṁ *while breathing through the left nostril will increase its watery effects. These mantras help increase the energies of the respective right and left, solar and lunar nadis.</p>
<p>Using the corresponding five element mantras with the appropriate nostril, like the mantra <em>Raṁ</em> with the solar nostril is a kind of &ldquo;increasing or parallel therapy&rdquo;. One can also employ a &ldquo;decreasing or opposite therapy&rdquo;, like using the mantra <em>Raṁ</em>, the fire mantra, with the lunar nostril that has a watery energy.</p>
<p>If we repeat the mantra <em>Raṁ</em> while breathing through the left nostril, which has a watery nature, we will tend to dry it out. This can be helpful when there is too much Kapha or water, or too much cold in the body, or when the left nostril is inhibited in its flow. Similarly, if we repeat the mantra <em>Vaṁ</em> while breathing through the right nostril we will tend to moisten it. This can be helpful when there is too much Pitta or fire in the body, or too much heat in the body or the right nostril is inhibited in its flow.</p>
<p>Similar strategies can be employed with the seed mantras of the other elements. If we repeat the mantra of the earth element <em>Laṁ</em> while breathing through either nostril, it will tend to slow down, stabilize, block or restrict the flow through the nostril by bringing the energy of earth into the flow. This can be good when the flow is too open or too rapid. If we repeat the mantra of the ether element <em>Haṁ</em> while breathing through either nostril, it will open and increase the flow. This can be good when the flow is closed or blocked.</p>
<h2 id="five-element-mantras-with-both-nostril-breathing">Five Element Mantras with Both Nostril Breathing</h2>
<p>We can also use the bija mantras for the five elements with both nostril breathing in order to increase the elements working during inhalation and exhalation. If your inhalation is heavy and restricted, for example, you can repeat the air mantra <em>Yaṁ</em> or the ether mantra <em>Haṁ</em> to open it up. If your breathing overall is too fast and ungrounded, you can repeat the earth mantra <em>Laṁ</em> to slow down and stabilize it. If your breath is cold or damp, you can repeat the fire mantra <em>Raṁ</em> to warm it up. If it is too hot or dry, you can repeat the water mantra <em>Vaṁ</em> to cool and moisten it.</p>
<p>You can also direct the breath up or down the spine with the mantras of the respective elements that you wish to increase, for example, drawing the fire energy up the spine with <em>Raṁ</em> and the water energy down the spine with <em>Vaṁ</em>. It is possible to balance the five elements through the breath with the help of these five element mantras. Such strategies will vary according to the condition of the individual and their pranic flows.</p>
<h2 id="five-element-mantras-pranayama-and-the-chakras">Five Element Mantras, Pranayama and the Chakras</h2>
<p>The five element mantras can be used to direct energy to the respective chakras that they rule over. One can repeat the seed mantra of the chakra while holding the gaze and awareness at the site, breathing in and out. This grants power over the element and a mastery of the faculties and qualities associated with it. For example, one can repeat the mantra <em>Laṁ</em> while meditating on the root or earth chakra, allowing the breath to naturally deepen. This process should be done for some time, generally at least twenty four minutes per chakra. In this way, one can gain power over the earth element and chakra, granting strength, stability, groundedness and patience to one&rsquo;s being.</p>
<p>You can similarly repeat the mantra <em>Vaṁ</em> along with the breath, while concentrating on the sex or water chakra to develop the energy there, and so on through the other chakras with their respective seed mantras. For the third eye, you can use the bija mantra <em>Kṣaṁ</em>, the seed sound of the mind. For the crown chakra, you can use the mantra <em>Oṁ</em> or <em>Aṁ</em>. This process is called &ldquo;Chakra Mantra Dharana&rdquo; or concentrating on the mantra at the chakra.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Fire and Water Energies Above and below with Mantra and Pranayama</strong></p>
<h2 id="agni-and-soma-in-tantra">Agni and Soma in Tantra</h2>
<p>Tantric Yoga emphasizes balancing Agni and Soma or fire and water, just as we find in the Vedas and in Ayurvedic medicine. In Tantric Yoga, Agni as the serpent fire relates the Kundalini force that dwells in the lower three chakras,11 particularly the root chakra. Soma is the complementary nectar or amrit that dwells in the higher three chakras,12 particularly the crown chakra, which is often referred to as the Soma. The goal of Tantric Yoga is to allow the Agni to ascend as the Kundalini fire and the Soma to descend as the complementary nectar or Divine grace, which allows for the full expansion of our inner being. Mantra is a key component and prime catalyst of this process.</p>
<p>We have discussed the importance of balancing the energies on the right and left sides of the body. Yet besides this, one must also strengthen the water and fire energies or Soma and Agni forces above and below in the body. This usually follows from balancing the energies on the right and left sides. Besides their general correlations with the three lower and three higher chakras, Agni and Soma have specific locations in the physical body that can be used to control their energies.</p>
<p>• The navel is the place of solar energy below in the body, preserved in the idea of the solar plexus and the navel or fire chakra.</p>
<p>• The soft palate of the mouth is the place of the lunar energy above in the body, reflecting the mind, which has a lunar character.</p>
<p>In Ayurveda, the belly is the location of the Jatharagni or &ldquo;digestive fire&rdquo;, the main form of fire governing the physical body and its metabolic processes. It is also the location of Pachaka Pitta, the form of Pitta or fiery energy that governs digestion and supports the Jatharagni. Balancing the Jatharagni or digestive fire is the basis of physical health and is necessary for any dietary or herbal therapy to really work. Yoga asanas aim at balancing the Jatharagni as a key goal of practice.</p>
<p>The brain is the location of Tarpaka Kapha, the form of Kapha giving contentment and lubricating the brain and nervous system. Maintaining its proper flow is the basis of psychological and emotional health and well-being. The brain has the capacity to produce special secretions that promote calm and contentment and which allay pain, anxiety and fear. Modern medicine has various names for these like endorphins and has developed special drugs to increase them. In yogic parlance, these are our inner &lsquo;somas&quot; or nectars (amrit) that can draw us into deeper states of meditation.</p>
<p>Yoga in the higher sense is all about developing the Soma within our minds. This Soma not only gives outer well-being but promotes inner happiness and peace leading to samadhi or the unitary state of mind and heart. Mantra, pranayama and meditation are among the main means of increasing it. Through mantra and pranayama, we can change our brain chemistry, promoting contentment, happiness and even bliss.</p>
<p>The key to physical health is to maintain a strong digestive fire energy in the navel below to protect the body. The key to psychological health is to maintain a strong lunar nectar in the head above to protect the mind. This is one of the keys to Ayurvedic medicine for both purification and rejuvenation. If the fire energy moves upwards adversely, it will burn up the lunar energy that is the basis of longevity, and harm our vitality. This is also one of the secrets of traditional Hatha Yoga. One must protect the Soma or the Moon above even when developing the Agni or fire below. Through such practices, great Yogis could prolong their life spans, promote rejuvenation and gain higher states of consciousness. Without developing the higher Soma, trying to arouse the Kundalini below can burn up the nervous system.</p>
<p>Mantra is one of the best means of balancing the lower fire and upper lunar forces of the navel and the head, particularly when combined with pranayama.13 This also serves to balance Pitta and Kapha, the biological fire and water energies, which in turn aids in stabilizing of Vata dosha, the underlying force of air and prana, and the most important dosha clinically.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-solar-and-lunar-energies-and-the-kundalini">Balancing Solar and Lunar Energies and the Kundalini</h2>
<p>According to a yogic understanding, the prana or vital energy does not normally flow through the Sushumna or central channel unless the solar and lunar energies are first balanced. Without first creating this balance, the chakras do not receive any direct prana or energization. The Kundalini Shakti remains asleep at the base of the spine and the chakras are not activated at a deep level. We can compare this to the state of an electrical system which is limited to a small battery, which does not have enough power to run much by way of equipment, whereas when the Kundalini Shakti is awakened, it is like connecting to a power grid that can run anything.</p>
<p>The prana ordinarily flows through the right and left, solar and lunar, the Ida and the Pingala nadis, shifting back and forth. The chakras only receive the limited prana conveyed by these two nadis. In the process, a small amount of nectar is conveyed by the lunar nadi to the Kundalini in the root chakra, which feeds and sustains the Kundalini so that it can uphold our regular physiological and psychological processes, but leaving it overall dormant.</p>
<p>This means that unless one first balances the solar and lunar nadis, any deeper work on the chakras will likely remain ineffective. Any talk of opening or awakening the chakras without first balancing these two forces, remains largely speculative.</p>
<p>To awaken the Kundalini and energize the chakras, one should do Yoga practices first that aim at stopping the flow of nectar through lunar or Ida nadi. Once that occurs, deprived of its nourishment, the Kundalini is forced to seek its nourishment by ascending through the central channel of the Sushumna to the ocean of nectar or Soma in the crown chakra, opening the chakras along the way.14</p>
<h2 id="the-breath-of-the-digestive-fire-for-the-body">The Breath of the Digestive Fire for the Body</h2>
<p>To accomplish this drying up of the Ida nadi, a special practice of alternate nostril breathing is used relative to the fire below. This procedure may be repeated for some period of time until a significant amount of purification occurs.</p>
<p>• First, one inhales through the left or lunar nostril along with the air mantra <em>Yaṁ</em>, repeating the mantra as many times as comfortable, drawing its energy into the navel.</p>
<p>• Second, one holds the breath along with the Shakti fire mantra <em>Hūṁ</em>, repeating the mantra as many times as comfortable, stimulating the fire in the navel to burn up any impurities in the abdomen and dry up the lower chakras.</p>
<p>• Third, one exhales through the right nostril along with the air mantra <em>Raṁ</em>, repeating the mantra as many times as comfortable, letting the impurities disperse.</p>
<p>• Then one reverses the process, repeating the fire mantra <em>Raṁ</em> along with inhalation through the right nostril, the Shakti fire mantra <em>Hūṁ</em> upon retention, and the air mantra <em>Yaṁ</em> along with exhalation through the left nostril.</p>
<p>Traditionally, inhalation is recommended for 16 counts, retention for 64 counts and exhalation for 32 counts. That requires very strong lungs and a good deal of previous pranayama practice to be able to do, which is quite rare. Shorter ratios should be used when the lungs are weaker. Even rations of 4/4/4 should be used to begin with, increasing the duration as the power of the breath increases over time. One should seek to increase the power of Prana naturally through slow, steady practice for the best results.</p>
<p>In this process sometimes a &ldquo;dark man of sin&rdquo; is imagined in the navel or to the left of the abdomen, symbolizing the ego, which is burned up or purified. Or from the standpoint of Ayurvedic healing, one can visualize the Ama or toxins in the body being burned up. It is important to hold the gaze and direct one&rsquo;s eyes inwardly to the navel center during this process, as the gaze aids in kindling the fire. This method arouses the Kundalini Shakti, which is connected to the digestive fire.15</p>
<h2 id="the-breath-of-soma-for-the-mind">The Breath of Soma for the Mind</h2>
<p>Besides the need to increase the fire below is a complimentary need to increase the water or nectar above. Normally our brains and minds are overheated and over stimulated, which results in the depletion of the mind&rsquo;s nourishing lunar energy. This leads to stress, anxiety, agitation, fear and anger. Besides consolidating the fire energy below for purification purposes, one needs to consolidate the lunar energy above for revitalization.</p>
<p>• First, one inhales through the left or lunar nostril with the water mantra <em>Vaṁ</em>, repeating the mantra as many times as can be done comfortably, drawing the energy up into the head and the place of the Moon in the soft palate of the mouth.</p>
<p>• Second, one holds the breath with the Shakti lunar mantra <em>Śrīṁ</em>, repeating the mantra as often as can be done comfortably, forming a spiritual body or body of nectar in the head.</p>
<p>• Third, one exhales through the right nostril with the earth mantra <em>Laṁ</em>, repeating the mantra as often as can be done comfortably, consolidating the spiritual body or body of nectar in the head.</p>
<p>• Then one reverses the process, repeating the earth mantra <em>Laṁ</em> along with inhalation through the right nostril, the Shakti lunar mantra <em>Śrīṁ</em> upon retention, and the water mantra <em>Vaṁ</em> along with exhalation through the left nostril.</p>
<p>One should hold one&rsquo;s gaze at the soft palate of the mouth, the upper back of the throat opposite the third eye during this practice. The procedure should continue until a significant amount of inner calm and well-being is created. Through this practice, one consolidates the Soma or nectar in the head so that it can balance the ascending Kundalini fire.</p>
<p>Note that these are basic versions of Agni and Soma mantra pranayamas. There are variations on how they can be done. Mantras for the other elements may be used as well as other Shakti mantras, depending upon the level of the individual practitioner.16 By performing both practices, one strengthens the digestive fire below and the mental calm and coolness above. One burns up toxins in the body and spiritualizes the mind.</p>
<p>Matangi, Goddess of All the Powers of Sound</p>

<p>1 Note Hatha Yoga Pradipika for its discussion of pranayama, Kundalini and Samadhi.</p>
<p>2 Or Ah can be used on inhalation.</p>
<p>3 The Para Vak of the four stages of speech.</p>
<p>4 Samkhya Karika of Ishvara Krishna, verse 22, Matharvritti commentary identifies the Cosmic Ahamkara principle with the Sanskrit alphabet.</p>
<p>5 Note the Self-inquiry method of Ramana Maharshi, which emphasizes tracing the root of all thoughts back to the I-thought in the heart.</p>
<p>6 Note the idea of lunar inhalation and solar exhalation in the works of Abhinavagupta, the main teacher of Tantric Kashmiri Shaivism, Para Trisika Vivarana, pps 263-264.</p>
<p>7 There are various yogic kriyas involving pranayama and mantra for guiding the energies of Fire (Kundalini), Moon (Soma), Sun (Surya) and Lightning (Vidyut) up and down the spine or to different chakras, depending upon the stage of practice and the development of the Yogi. How inhalation and exhalation function depends upon which specific energies one may be drawing in or releasing out. Balancing solar and lunar energies, however, is fundamental to all of these yogic pranayamas.</p>
<p>8 Another method is to use the So mantra to draw the Apana up from the root chakra to the navel and the haṁ mantra to enkindle Agni or digestive fire in the navel. This is a simple method to help balance Apana and Prana as lunar and solar forces.</p>
<p>9 This amounts to one breath every four seconds, about average for most healthy people. This number is found in the Shatapatha Brahmana XII.3.2.8, an ancient Vedic text.</p>
<p>10 Dhyana Bindu Upanishad 61-63.</p>
<p>11 The three lower chakras are commonly said to be the region of Fire or Agni and are named the kanda or bulb in Tantric thought.</p>
<p>12 The three higher chakras are called the region of the Moon or Soma in Tantric thought.</p>
<p>13 The two bandhas, uddiyana and jalandhara, aid in these practices, uddiyana for the fire in the navel, and jalandhara for the nectar or Soma in the head. The mula bandha is important for drawing the Apana Vayu to the navel to unite Prana and Apana.</p>
<p>14 The Serpent Power of Sir John Woodfroofe.</p>
<p>15 An important aid to arousing the Kundalini is to draw the descending prana (Apana Vayu) upward from the root chakra, where its energy tends to get dispersed, to the navel and, conversely, to draw the ascending Prana downward from the throat and head, where its energy tends to get dispersed, to the navel. Uniting the Prana and Apana in the navel electrifies the nervous system and energizes the subtle body and its chakra system. In this respect, the Apana provides the fuel or food for the increased fire that is stimulated through the Prana. This can also be described as uniting the Apana or the lunar current with the Prana or the solar current in the navel, thus enkindling the fire principle, Agni or Kundalini. Many Tantric Pranayama practices reflect this approach.</p>
<p>16 A similar practice occurs in many Tantric teachings using the five element mantras to purify the Papa Purusha or dark man of sin in the lower left abdomen and transform it into a ball of golden light. The practices given here are a bit more complex and consider the Agni and Soma energies in both their locations.</p>
