title = "19 Vedic and Vedantic Mantra Yoga"

+++

The *Vedas* present the oldest form of the Sanskrit language, the language of mantra. As such, they present us with the oldest form of Mantra Yoga. Mantra Yoga is the oldest and most central of all the Yogas. Classical Yoga evolved out of the language of mantra, which is the language of the spiritually awakened mind that reveals the underlying unity of all existence.

Some scholars argue that there is no Yoga in the Vedas because the term Yoga is rare in Vedic texts and no Yoga asanas are described. However, they miss the obvious point: the Vedas represent a path of Mantra Yoga, including the use of Divine Names. Mantra, more so than asana, is an indicator of higher Yoga practices and Yoga in general.

The *Vedas* provide a large number of names for the different Vedic deities. Some of these form special sequences, notably the twenty-one names of the Divine Mother. “The seers thought out the first name of the Cow and found the three times seven supreme powers of the Mother.”1 The Vedas recognize speech \(Vak\) as the Mother. Her forms are different letters or different levels of communication. “The Devas generated the Word Goddess. Her animals of all forms speak.”2 Indeed the Vedas are always spoken of as the Mother or Mata Veda.

The *Rigveda*, the oldest and largest of the Vedas, speaks of seven levels of speech: 'seven Voices conceive a single child.”3 The voices are feminine and their child is Agni or fire, the Vedic deity ruling over speech. These seven levels of speech may refer to the role of mantra on all the seven planes or lokas of existence from the gross physical to the Supreme Absolute or formless Brahman and to the seven chakras.

The *Rigveda* projects a language of cosmic sound, reflecting the language of nature through the natural forces of light and energy. It consists of various rhythmic chants to the great powers of the conscious universe in order to draw their blessings into our lives. According to the Vedas, sound comes from the Sun, which has the nature of light. The Sun is continually chanting *Oṁ*.4 There is a secret Sun hidden in our hearts. This is the origin of the unstruck sound or Anahata that gives rise to the inner sound current or nada.

Single syllable bija mantras are not as evident in the Vedas as in later texts. However, they do exist in the Vedas, particularly as hidden in the roots of words. Sanskrit words develop from root sounds. For example, the root "*Hu*", which we find in the fiery mantra *Huṁ*, also refers to fire as the invoker \(Hota\) and to fire offerings \(Huti\) and fire rituals \(Havan, Homa\). Sri Aurobindo notes that Vedic Sanskrit evolved from an earlier language of such root sounds, to which various inflections were gradually added.5 These roots remain more alive and variable in Vedic than in classical Sanskrit.

This means that if one knows the prime roots of the Sanskrit language, one can understand most bija mantras, which are nothing but the language of the Sanskrit roots. Sanskrit etymology, called *Nirukta* in Sanskrit, is one of the *Vedangas* or "limbs of the Vedas" and an important aspect of Mantra Yoga. Such mantric roots are more alive in the Vedic language than they are in later Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit arose from these mantric roots at an early stage of human speech.

## Vedic Suktas and Vedic Chanting

The *Vedas* consist of special poetic verses or Suktas, referred to as "hymns". Suktas are mantric verses to various deities, which represent forms and aspects of the Divine or Inner Self \(Atman or Purusha\). Hidden in these Vedic mantras is a complete inner Yoga of the chakras and realization of the higher Self, as well as the foundation for all the Vedic sciences. The *Rigveda* presents the greatest number of Vedic mantras in three tone chant. The Samaveda emphasizes a more musical type of chanting as its main form of practice. In fact, the Vedas honor the deity primarily as Svara or sound vibration, which is later equated with Shiva. “What is called Svara in the Vedas and what is established in the Vedanta, …that is Maheshvara \(Shiva\).”6

Certain verses from different Vedic Suktas have become important mantras and prayers in their own right. A few of these Vedic verses remain popular in yogic circles. Most notable is the Gayatri Mantra to the Sun God Savita.7 However, the Gayatri Mantra is one of ten thousand verses of the *Rigveda* and many of these verses have similar powers. The Mahamrityunjaya Mantra to Lord Shiva for warding off death also remains commonly used today.8 Another very important Vedic verse is the *Haṁsaḥ* Mantra of Vamadeva.9 Many significant Vedic verses are found in the famous Asya Vamasya Sukta of Dirghatamas.10 Vedic Shanti mantras or peace mantras, Shanti Patha,11 are another type of Vedic verse that continues to be widely employed. Many of these Vedic verses occur in the Upanishads.12

Vedic Suktas, particularly to Soma and Agni, are in my opinion the greatest works of Sanskrit literature, poetry and spirituality. These Vedic hymns have a density and power in the language probably unequalled even in later Sanskrit poetry or Kavya literature. Vedic mantras can be used according to certain methods of pranayama and meditation internally and according to special fire rituals externally, and remain very effective if so employed, even today.

Besides verses directly from the Vedas, there are special chants found in supplementary collections of Vedic verses. These include the Sri Sukta to Lakshmi, the Durga Sukta, Sarasvati Sukta, Narayana Sukta and Vishnu Sukta. Certain *Upanishads* are also commonly chanted today; notably the Taittiriya and Mahanarayana, the latter of which contains many older Vedic verses. Some Vedic chants derive from the Yajurveda, notably the Rudram, a long chant to Rudra-Shiva that remains the most popular of the longer Vedic chants.13

Many people today listen to tapes of Vedic chanting, such as are available from the TM \(Transcendental Meditation\) movement and other sources. There are several centers in the West that teach Vedic chanting, which is used in some Yoga traditions. The greater Vedic Mantra Yoga is less commonly taught or understood, but is gradually emerging once more.

## Gayatri Mantra

The Gayatri Mantra is the most sacred prayer of the Hindus. It has been widely promoted by modern Hindu sects like the Arya Samaj and the Gayatri Pariwar, whose millions of followers recite it daily. Many western Yoga groups now chant the Gayatri as well, though they are not always aware of its sacred origins or intent.

The Gayatri is probably the oldest chant that has been continually recited in the history of the world, with an antiquity of at least five thousand years. It reflects the timelessness of the Vedic language. Below is the Sanskrit and a simple translation.

*Oṁ Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ, Tat Savitur vareçyam bhargo devasya dhīmahi, dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt*

Om Earth, Atmosphere, Heaven: We meditate upon the supreme effulgence of the Divine solar Creator, that he may direct our minds.

The *Yajurveda* reveals the sounds of the three worlds *Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ *called* Vyāhr̥tis *in Sanskrit, which are placed at the beginning of the Gayatri and other Vedic mantras and function as bija mantras. All three mantras are based on the root vowel-*U*, which projects a circular and expansive energy that can create and sustain the worlds. The consonant-Bha is the last of the series of the 25 Sanskrit consonants, except the M-sound, and is the most open and expansive of all the consonant sounds. It also relates to the sphere of light, *Bhā*.

*Bhūḥ* refers to being or existence in the realm of time and space as defined by the development of light. *Bhuvaḥ* refers to energy or becoming and relates to the Atmosphere or realm of intermediate space. Su refers to creation, expression, swelling, revolving and resonating. *Svaḥ*, also rendered as *Suvaḥ*, relates to light, sunlight and the realm of light or Heaven. The *Vyāhr̥tis* are sometimes extended to seven with *Maha, Jana, Tapa *and* Satya *added for the four higher worlds of intelligence, bliss, consciousness and pure being.

## Vedic Mantra Yoga and Bhakti Yoga

The *Vedas* consist of the human invocation of the Divine and cosmic powers, not only in the world around us but within our own psyche. They speak to the Divine as “Thou” as their main mode of address. Vedic mantras should be directed to the Divine with a sense of a personal and reverential connection in order to have their full efficacy.

In this regard, Vedic mantras promote Bhakti Yoga or the Yoga of devotion. They are directed to the Divine consciousness mirrored in the forces of nature like Fire, Wind and Sun, and in our own inner faculties of speech, mind and prana through various Devatas like Agni, Indra and Surya.

The Vedas promote various attitudes of devotion, looking at the Divine as father, mother, brother, sister, friend, master, and beloved. “Thou, O Indra, are our father and our mother, you who have unlimited power, as such we implore your grace.”14

There is no important aspect of devotion that does not occur among the Vedic chants, honoring the Divine as One, as many, as All and as beyond all manifestation, yet woven into a unitary pattern of sound and vibration.

***Ãṁ,* the Supreme Bija Mantra of the *Rigveda***

The *Rigveda* speaks of the primal cosmic word called *Akṣara*, meaning what is imperishable. “All the Divine powers dwell in the syllable of the chant in the supreme ether; those who do not know that, what can they do with the Veda?”15 The mantra *Oṁ* does not appear with any significance in the *Rigveda*, though it is well known in the Yajurveda, but other mantric sounds do occur. Most common in the *Rigveda*, is the mantra *Ãṁ*, which is a common interjection in many hymns. The Yajurveda speaks with reverence of this word, “Reverence to the sound *Ãṁ*.”16

The great modern Yogi, Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni, the chief disciple of Ramana Maharshi, explains in detail the importance of *Ãṁ* as the great mantra from the *Rigveda*, its form of Pranava, equivalent to *Oṁ*, as representing the Cosmic Word.17 Ganapati Muni's disciple Brahmarshi Daivarata does so as well.18 It was from Daivarata that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi received much of his Vedic knowledge. He brought Daivarata to the West and spent time with him in India.

Generally, *Ãṁ* represents the power of Divine light and seeing, while *Oṁ* projects the power of Divine prana and hearing, though the two are closely linked together. *Ãṁ* is the mantra of Indra, the supreme deity of the chant in early Vedic thought. *Oṁ* is the mantra of Shiva, the supreme deity of the chant in later Hindu thought. They are essentially two forms of the same mantra and of the same deity. Through the power of mantra *Ãṁ*, the secret of all Vedic mantras can be revealed.

The mantra *Ãṁ* is the foundation of most of the Shakti mantras discussed earlier in the book. It projects an energy and power of perception, the electrical force of seeing. It is the mantric sound of the eyes in the Mantra Purusha. The mantra *Ãṁ* allows for the awakening of the Shakti of any mantra, and also provides the vision behind the mantra, its knowledge component.

The related Vedic mantra *Sīṁ* refers to the highest, the summit, the power of pure existence, while *Hīṁ* refers to the power of the Vajra or the lightning bolt of pure perception that Indra, the deity of cosmic prana, wields. Brahmarshi Daivarata revealed the great mantra *Ãṁ Oṁ Śrīḥ*, which was followed by the Gayatri Mantra.19 This he regarded as the mantric key to all creation and the basis of all the other Vedic mantras.

## Orientation of Vedic Mantras

For all Vedic mantras, there are three primary factors. First is the deity or Devata to which the hymn is being addressed. Second is the meter \(chandas\), the rhythm or sound form the hymn takes, which is its means or vehicle of expression. The meters are regarded as feminine in nature and reflect the energy or Shakti of the hymn. Third is the rishi or seer who first cognized the hymn. The Vedic rishis have their own stories, energies and attributes which are relevant in understanding their hymns.

For a Vedic mantra to be fully effective, it is said that one should know and honor all three factors. One should chant the hymn according to an inner communion with the Devata, a feeling of the meter or energy power of the chant, and a regard for the rishi.

For example, the Gayatri Mantra is to Savita, who is one of the Adityas or solar Godheads. More specifically, Savita represents the Purusha or consciousness within the Sun as symbolic of the Divine light, especially the transformative power of light. Savita represents the power that changes night into day and day into night. This is why the Gayatri mantra is chanted at sunrise, noon and sunset, the transformational moments of the Sun's movement. In Vedic thought, the Sun is not simply a material globe but the source of prana, intelligence and Divine grace. The Sun is the primal guru. The Vedic mantras themselves reside in the rays of the Sun as powers of light and prana.

The Gayatri mantra was first cognized by the great Rishi Vishvamitra, the most martial and effort-oriented of all the Rishis. This means that the Gayatri is a mantra of effort and tapas, heat and transformation. Vishvamitra was known for his wrathful nature and was a manifestation of Agni or fire. Through the Gayatri mantra, he overcame his personal weaknesses and raised his energy into the highest light, charting a path for all humanity to follow after him and leave behind all their limitations.

The Gayatri mantra is named after the Gayatri meter in which it is cast. There are around two hundred and fifty Vedic hymns in the Gayatri meter, which consists of three verses of eight syllables or twenty four syllables each. The Gayatri meter is most connected to Agni or fire as a deity. It represents the power of the Goddess to move through all difficulties and causes her energy to arise within us.

The Gayatri mantra is a means of bringing solar energy of a spiritual nature into our deeper awareness. It should be chanted at the appropriate transformative moments along with reverence and humility. It can draw down a Divine solar power to energize our minds and prepare them for meditation, much like we use solar cells to electrify our houses. At the highest level, the Gayatri opens our minds and heart to the Supreme Light and grants the highest Self-realization, just like the great sayings and teachings of Vedanta.

## Mantra Purusha and Vedic Mantras

The idea of the Mantra Purusha or body of mantra is one of the main Vedic concepts. It is based upon the same division of the types of sounds discussed relative to the Sanskrit alphabet.

The *Aitareya Aranyaka*, from which the Upanishad of the same name arises, states: "The consonants are the form of the Earth. The sibilants are the form of the Atmosphere. The vowels are the form of Heaven. The consonants are the form of Agni \(light of Earth\). The sibilants are the form of Vayu \(light of the Atmosphere\). The vowels are the form of the Sun \(light of Heaven\)”.20 This is the same concept as in Shaivite Yoga of the vowels as consciousness \(light\), the sibilants as Prana or Vayu, and the consonants as the material principle or Earth.

In another instance, the *Aitareya Aranyaka *states that there are 360 vowels, 360 consonants and 360 combinations of the two, referring to their variations and combinations, which relate to the 360 bones, 360 nerves and 360 bone-nerve connections in the body. This results in 540 sounds on the right side of the body and 540 sounds on the left side of the body.21 These 1080 sounds in turn are said to correspond to the Sun and the 360 days, 360 nights and 360 day-night conjunctions of the year, so they are also part of a cosmic symbolism of light.

While I have not seen a presentation of the Mantra Purusha with the fifty sounds of the Sanskrit alphabet in the Vedas, we do find in these statements, a presentation of a Mantra Purusha with 1080 sounds, suggesting a yet more elaborate Mantra Purusha presentation that once probably existed.

## Vedic Mantras, Ayurveda, Yoga and Tantra

The *Rigveda* is based on three primary deities Agni, Vayu and Soma, which outwardly correspond to the forces of Fire, Air and Water. Indra as the Supreme deity can be related to all three, but is generally placed in the sphere of Vayu. Surya or the Sun is the essence of all the three. We can find in these Vedic deities the basis of the three Ayurvedic doshas and their subtle essences with Agni, Tejas and Pitta dosha, Soma, Ojas and Kapha dosha, and Vayu, Prana and Vata dosha.

This means that we can repeat Vedic verses to Agni, Indra and Soma to develop the subtle essences of Tejas, Prana and Ojas within us, the spiritual essences of fire, air and water. These subtle essences are the master forms of the doshas that create positive health and help unfold our higher spiritual potential as well.

The hymns to Soma are particularly good to repeat for promoting meditation and samadhi. They aid in developing Tarpaka Kapha, which lubricates the brain and nervous system. The hymns to Agni grant us power of discrimination, speech and meditation. The hymns to Indra give higher powers of prana, will power and deeper perception. The hymns to the Sun or Surya give higher powers of intelligence, comprehension, prana and awareness.

Relative to Tantric principles, the Vedic Agni hymns help awaken the Kundalini Shakti or serpent fire in the root chakra, which is the Agni hidden in the earth of the root and in the recesses of our own psyche. The Soma hymns aid in the flow of Soma from the crown chakra or thousand petalled lotus and descent of Divine bliss and grace into us. Soma flows in a thousand streams covering all the petals of the crown chakra and all possible variations of sound and mantra. The hymns to Indra aid in the opening of the third eye and help us gain mastery over all external forces. The hymns to the Sun aid in the opening of the heart and contact with the omnipresent Divine light of truth.

## Vedantic Mantras

The *Vedas* reach their culmination in the profound philosophy of Vedanta, the main principles of which are set forth in the *Upanishads* and *Bhagavad Gita*. The language shifts from cryptic symbolic mantras to profound philosophical utterances, in which the symbolism of light gradually merges into the supreme light of consciousness as Atman or Purusha, the higher Self.

Instead of rhythmical verses like the Gayatri, there are succinct statements of unity with the Supreme Reality, Brahman. These are called *Mahavakyas* or "Great Sayings". They teach and affirm the unity of the individual Self with the Supreme Self, which is the ultimate aim of Yoga. The special resonance of their sounds helps sustain the higher knowledge that they bestow to those who listen to them with an open mind and heart. There are a number of such statements in the Upanishads, of which perhaps six are the most important.

• *Aham Brahmāsmi*: I am Brahman or the Supreme Godhead.22

• *Ayam Àtmā Brahma*: This Self is Brahman or the Supreme Godhead.23

• *Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma*: Everything is Brahman or the Absolute.24

• *Tattvamasi*: Thou art That \(the Supreme Brahman\).25

• *So\`ham Asmi*: I am He \(the Supreme Self\).26

• *Prajéānam Brahma*: Wisdom is the Supreme Brahman.27

All these great sayings are summarized in the single great mantra *Oṁ* that comes to dominate all mantras from the late Vedic era and also means "I am all". There are other important Vedantic mantras in yogic thought, for example, *Oṁ Tat Sat*. *Oṁ* is the Divine Word. *Tat* refers to the Infinite, from the root Ta meaning "to extend". Sat refers to pure existence, from the root As indicating being.

One repeats these mantras as the focus of one's meditation. In them, the meaning is most important, though the special nature of Vedic sound serves to support the meaning in a powerful manner. It is good to adopt one of these Mahavakyas as the great saying to guide one's life and promote one's deeper awareness, motivating us to Self-realization. They provide a higher intention or samkalpa to lead us beyond all lower inclinations.
