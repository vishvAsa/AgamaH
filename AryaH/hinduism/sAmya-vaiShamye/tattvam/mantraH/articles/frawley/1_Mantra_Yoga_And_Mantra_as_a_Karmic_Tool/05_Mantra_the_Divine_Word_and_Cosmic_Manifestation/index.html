  <p>There are many profound philosophies of mantra and the Divine Word in the different spiritual traditions of the world. Western philosophy and theology has aimed at the Logos or Divine Word, as perhaps its prime inspiration, since the time of the ancient Greeks. The great yogic philosophies of India have been rooted in mantra, of which the ancient Vedic philosophy is probably the oldest and most comprehensive. The Vedas teach how the entire universe in all its vastness arises from a single sound, just as the Big Bang theory of modern physics teaches how the entire universe arises from a single timeless and spaceless point. Yoga explains how our own psyche mirrors cosmic sound in the structure of our subtle body and its chakra centers, which are mantric formations.</p>
<p>Mantra can be said to be the highest form of philosophy because it provides the concentrated form of language necessary to embody the highest truths that go beyond our ordinary human language based on physical reality. Mantra is a deeper level of speech that reflects the laws of the universe, what is called dharma, ’that which upholds’, in Sanskrit. Mantra is the ‘language of dharma’ that enables us to understand what dharma is and how it works. That is why in Mantra Yoga different sounds correspond to the natural and spiritual forces through which the universe operates, starting with <em>Oṁ</em> itself as the cosmic word.</p>
<p>Each object in the universe is an expression of the Divine Word and holds a specific message about the meaning and purpose of the universe as a whole. Nature itself is the first Book of Mantra or sacred sound, the outer reflection of the Divine Word. Yoga and all the Vedic sciences arose originally from an ability to understand the Divine Word, to read the language of nature that is mantra, and to unfold its secrets through Shakti, the hidden power of nature, whose origin is primal sound.</p>
<h2 id="speech-and-the-human-being">Speech and the Human Being</h2>
<p>According to the Upanishads: “The essence of all beings is earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water is the plants, the essence of the plants is the human being, the essence of the human being is speech, the essence of speech is the <em>Rigveda</em>, the essence of the <em>Rigveda</em> is the Samaveda, and the essence of the Samaveda is <em>Oṁ</em>.1 We as human beings are a manifestation of cosmic sound and have the ability to reflect the Divine Word in our own minds and hearts. Mantra is the language we need to learn in order to be able to do this.</p>
<p>Speech is the main faculty that defines our nature as human beings. Our special vocal organs are one of the main evolutionary developments that made the human species possible. We humans have the ability to make complex sounds with our tongues, mouths and throats that reflect the subtlety of what our brain can think and the intricacy of what our hands can fashion. Usually, the greater is our intelligence, the greater is our ability of communication through speech.</p>
<p>Our power of speech is originally an articulation of self, an expression of self- existence and individuality. The utterance of ‘I’ is the root of all other expressions. Speech is the expression of consciousness, its way of revealing itself and its powers of observation. It is because of our power of speech that we can recognize ourselves, name objects in the world, and reflect upon the meaning of our existence. The human ‘I am’ is a reflection of the Divine ‘I am’ through the unity of the human and the Divine Word.</p>
<p>Speech is the main motor organ that we use in life, through which we direct our other faculties. We are always speaking either with our mouth or with our minds. As our words precede our actions, speech is the basis of our power of action in general. This means that through control of speech we can control our karma and gain mastery over the entire movement of our lives. Yet besides our outer speech capacity there is an inner speech, the voice of the mind and heart, which proceeds through the power of mantra and sacred sound and contains our higher evolutionary potential in consciousness.</p>
<p>To understand mantra, we must first understand this underlying power of speech, which is ultimately rooted in consciousness itself, not just the vocal organ. Speech is a Divine potential that is part of the universal creative power. Speech is not simply a biological or species-based urge. Our human speech is not just used to express our basic life impulses; it has an additional power of poetry and philosophy. We can use the power of speech not only to communicate with other human beings, but to also communicate with the Divine powers that pervade the universe. Mantra is the means of this cosmic communication, though which we can become one with All.</p>
<h2 id="speech-and-the-goddess">Speech and the Goddess</h2>
<p>Great spiritual traditions from throughout the world recognize the role of the Divine Word as the origin of the universe. The same is true of yogic thought, in which the Divine Word both creates the universe and is one with the Absolute beyond time and space. Yet in yogic thought, the Word is not simply God, the Word is the power of the Goddess.</p>
<p>As a creative power, speech has a feminine quality. It is the instrument of the great world Mother. Speech is the original form of the Goddess, who herself is the creative power of the silent Absolute hidden in infinite space. This power of speech, called</p>
<p>Vak or Sarasvati in the Vedas, is the force behind nature and holds all the powers of cosmic evolution.</p>
<p>The very body of the Goddess is made up of mantra, defined through the root sounds of the Sanskrit alphabet, through which she fashions all things, forming the myriad forms of creatures out of the vibratory power of the Word. The Goddess rules over the universe through her power of speech, which dictates the cosmic order and sets in motion all the laws of existence. Yet she herself is also the Word, and through it, she is herself all beings in the universe, which are aspects of her own self expression.</p>
<p>This Divine Word Goddess has entered into humanity and allows us to speak. She is the higher voice within us. Unfortunately, we seldom honor the Goddess by treating our speech as sacred. We too frequently use our speech in a destructive and egoistic manner. Such unsacred speech causes many problems in life, whether conflicts with others or emotional unrest within ourselves. However, once we reach the mantric level of language and reconnect with the Divine Word, our language once more becomes the expression of the Goddess and regains its healing and transformative capacity. Mantra requires that we let the Goddess speak through us. For mantra to really work, it should be employed as a means of worshipping the Goddess, not to gain something for ourselves!</p>
<h2 id="prana-and-speech-the-great-god-and-the-great-goddess">Prana and Speech/ the Great God and the Great Goddess</h2>
<p>The Vedas define the two fundamental forces in the universe as Prana or life- energy, which we experience mainly through the breath, and Vak, which is speech, articulation or expression overall.</p>
<p>Prana is the Great God or masculine principle – Shiva in Hindu thought – who represents the transcendent Prana or immortal life energy beyond life and death. This power was called Indra in Vedic thought, the foremost of the Vedic deities, who represents the ruling power of Prana as will, insight and the urge to transcend. Vak or speech is the Goddess or feminine principle, Shakti or the Devi (Goddess) relative to Shiva, and Indrani, the feminine aspect of Indra.</p>
<p>Prana is spirit, which is formless, while speech is the basis of form and matter through the naming process. Name and form arise through speech, while being and consciousness are sustained by prana. Prana and speech are intertwined, like husband and wife, or the right and left sides of the body. They always move together. Prana is the energy behind speech, which moves through the breath. Speech is the form or limitation that prana or the breath assumes. Speech is prana in action. Prana is the essence of speech, which communicates our life-energy, its intentions and its information. Prana or breath is the meaning behind speech, which is the sound created by the breath as it tries to express itself outwardly. Prana is the speaker, and speech is the instrument of speaking.</p>
<p>Prana and Vak are two facets of the same underlying reality. Prana is unmanifest speech, and speech is manifest prana. Prana naturally creates sound, which is the hissing sound of the breath.2 Speech occurs through the outgoing breath and is, therefore, manifest prana. Our speech expresses our prana or our energy, not just our physical and vital energy but our mental and spiritual energy. Similarly, our prana or breath carries our thoughts as the seed of our words. Prana provides the impetus to speak, which at a higher level is the expression of inspiration.</p>
<p>This means that we cannot forget the role of prana in mantra. The power of the breath and the greater vital energy behind it vitalizes the mantra. Similarly, mantras can work to hold and sustain our prana. Prana, we could say, is the spirit of mantra. Mantra in turn is the expression of prana. Whatever most engages our prana or vital energy becomes the main subject of our speech.</p>
<h2 id="speech-senses-and-mind">Speech, Senses and Mind</h2>
<p>Whatever we can perceive through any of our different senses, we can express through speech. Speech can relate what the eye sees, what the ear hears, what the nose smells, what the tongue tastes and what the skin touches. All the senses express themselves through the power of speech, apart from which they are mute and incapable of articulating themselves.</p>
<p>Speech therefore is the guide of all the other senses. Through the control of speech, we can control all our senses.3 This means that mantras can help us master, energize and harmonize all our senses. Mantra connects our outer speech with the inner speech of the Gods, which can bring the Divine Will into our sensory functioning. Speech is more than a motor organ but connects to the speech of the mind, our deeper consciousness and the Divine word.</p>
<p>The mind is composed of thoughts, which are based on words and reflect our speech patterns. Thought itself is a subtle form of speech. We can observe this for ourselves. Our thoughts are a kind of internal conversation, our own mental talk, often framed as a soliloquy or an imagined dialogue. If we replace this mental speech with mantra, we can transform the energy of our minds and hearts. This higher speech of the mind is the basis of buddhi or higher intelligence in Yoga, which allows our thoughts and actions to flow with the Divine word.</p>
<p>Notice that you cannot see your mind or your thoughts, which have no visible form. The mind consists of sound which carries our memories, emotions and ideas. It is the power of sound that holds who we are, who we have been and who we wish to be. This is not just sound as one of the five elements but the primal sound vibration behind all the elements. Mantra as primal sound can change the nature of the mind down to the subconscious level. Through mantra, the control of both the mind and the senses becomes possible, not through the ego but through the Divine presence within us. Mantra can then open up our inner senses and higher levels of the mind that are otherwise very difficult to access.</p>
<h2 id="sound-and-meaning">Sound and Meaning</h2>
<p>There are two factors in all words as ‘sound’ and ‘meaning’. In yogic thought, the sound is said to be Shakti, the feminine principle of energy, and the meaning is said to be Shiva, the masculine principle of being. The sound is a vehicle for the meaning. In our modern languages, the sound and meaning of words has little relationship. For example, there is no particular reason of sound quality why the English word ‘tree’ means ‘a woody plant with a big stem’. The use of a particular sound for a particular object is based upon convention, rooted in historical usage, not in the power of sound. Another language can use a very different sound for the same object.</p>
<p>Yet we do seek to harmonize sound and meaning when it comes to literature, particularly poetry. The poet seeks to say something in a sound pattern that enhances the meaning. Uniting sound and meaning lends greater power to our language and allows the meaning to penetrate more deeply into our psyche.</p>
<p>Sanskrit rests upon an inherent relationship between sound and meaning. For example, the Sanskrit word for peace, shanti, comes from the root ‘sham’, meaning ‘to calm’. The sound quality of the word shanti is peaceful. On the other hand, the English word peace, though having the same basic meaning as shanti has a sound quality that is harsher and does not serve as useful a vehicle for its meaning. Repeat these two words shanti and peace for a few minutes and see which of the two sounds makes you feel more peaceful!</p>
<p>Of course, meaning is more important than sound. It is better to say something meaningful in a clumsy manner than to say something meaningless with style. But it is better if sound and meaning remain harmonized. Sound reflects speech and meaning reflects the mind. It is important that the two resonate with each other.</p>
<h2 id="primal-sound">Primal Sound</h2>
<p>There are subtler realms of both sound and meaning. Ordinary words like ‘house’ or ‘tree’ have specific and limited meanings in time and space, denoting particular objects of the senses. Such ‘substantive nouns’ reflect a physical view of reality and a utilitarian sense of value. They have little ability to connect us with the Divine or sacred presence in nature.</p>
<p>There are higher levels of meaning in our language. We have words for emotions, ideas and spiritual experiences that do not correspond to specific physical objects. At the highest level, we have terms for God or the Supreme Reality. There are also deeper levels of sound. We recognize not only the level of poetry but that of scripture, which adds a spiritual dimension to expression that is often poetic as well. Mantra teaches us that there is an additional level of ‘primal sound’ that corresponds to root meanings behind all words, ideas and objects. This is the basis of bija mantras or seed syllables like <em>Oṁ</em> that is said to carry the Divine in both its manifest and unmanifest forms. Spiritual principles easily remain mere concepts or beliefs for us, not objects of our direct experience. Anyone can repeat the word God and know what it means at a conceptual level, but this does not mean that they know God or have experienced the Divine within their own hearts and minds. But mantras and Divine names can easily connect us to the deeper truth behind such ideas.</p>
<p>The primal sounds of mantras are not mere ordinary words with specific dictionary meanings. Nor are they meaningless, as some might believe. Mantras contain entire spectrums of meaning from the physical to the spiritual and reflect various qualities of energy. Seed mantras can serve as vehicles to perceive, experience and realize the reality of universal consciousness, not only in a general sense but in the changing forms of our individual life experience.</p>
<p>Primal sounds are connected to ‘primal meanings’, which go back to the universal sense of Being and Self. Such primal sounds and their primal meanings are the basis of the roots of the Sanskrit language and are mirrored in its development. Mantra is a vehicle to bring our minds, hearts and prana to the level of both primal sound and primal meaning, in which we can return to the original state of unity with all. This requires that we use mantras with an intention, focus and aspiration to reach the Supreme.</p>
<h2 id="sound-and-light-time-and-space">Sound and Light/ Time and Space</h2>
<p>Sound and light are inherently connected. Sound is a creation of light and electrical energy, just as thunder manifests from lightning. There is an electrical force or glow inherent in infinite space, from which a mantric vibration is ever arising like a continuous series of lightning flashes, sustaining all forms and processes in the universe.</p>
<p>The higher word or mantra consists of both sound and light. It is the word of light. Sound is the vibratory quality of space, which itself is the field of light. Light relates to the meaning of words, their mental component. Words serve to convey knowledge, which is a condensation of the light of the mind. For example, when we see something, like a tree, the light of the mind perceives it, but it is sound in the form of words in our memory that holds our knowledge of having seen it. Light reveals knowledge but sound carries, preserves and embodies knowledge. Mantra brings light into our awareness, but also allows us to carry and sustain that light as knowledge.</p>
<p>Light and sound relate to space and time. Light creates space as its field of illumination and sound creates time as its field of movement. Ganapati Muni defines “the nature of time is the most subtle sound.”4 Mantra, therefore, can project the root powers of time and its universal energies, ideas and potentials. Through mantra we can gain mastery of all the forces of time and karma.</p>
<p>Through mantra, we can awaken the Divine light within us and expand beyond the limitations of space, direction and manifestation. Through mantra, one can learn to ride the waves of cosmic sound and light, going back to the Divine Word at the heart of the world. This is the cosmic form of Mantra Yoga known only to Yogis who have gone beyond the body and mind.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-levels-of-speech">The Four Levels of Speech</h2>
<p>Speech has four levels in yogic thought, which are the four different states of the Goddess or Divine Word:
<strong>Four Levels of Speech (Vak)</strong>   <strong>1. Vaikhari</strong> Audible speech Throat Waking state   <strong>2. Madhyama</strong> Pranic speech Heart Dream   <strong>3. Pashyanti</strong> Illumined speech Navel Deep sleep   <strong>4. Para</strong> Transcendent (Turiya) Root center Samadhi</p>
<p><em>Vaikhari</em> refers to the coarse or literal level of speech. It is the word as spoken with the vocal organs in the mouth and the throat. Our minds usually dwell on this level of audible speech and the conventional meanings of words. This is the level of speech as related to outer sensations, which relates to physical reality. At this level, the outer form of the word is the main thing. To affect this level of speech, we must audibly repeat the mantra.5</p>
<p>We enter into <em>Madhyama</em>, which literally means the ‘middle level’ of speech, when we think or feel deeply about something, when we ponder or wonder about things. This requires that our life-force and vitality is engaged in what we say. Most artistic thinking comes from this level, which reveals subtle forms and inner energy patterns. This is the astral form of speech connected to the dream world. All mantras can be employed at this level when we repeat them along with the breath.6</p>
<p><em>Pashyanti</em> or ‘perceptive’ speech occurs when we perceive the underlying cosmic truths or archetypes, the dharmas behind any object or situation. Its nature is light or revelation, showing the seed forces at work in the universe. This is the causal level of speech related to the deep sleep state. To reach this level in the waking state requires deep meditation or as an act of grace. It corresponds to the one-pointed mind in Yoga. It has a luminous quality to it. The word at this level has light and reveals the truth. Many mantric prayers and hymns are best understood at this level, which engages our deeper contemplative nature.7</p>
<p>Para, which means ‘transcendent’, is the level of pure silence in which meaning is so full and complete that it cannot be broken down into limited words. It is the level of pure consciousness, the Divine Word of silence of ‘I am all’ and the great realizations of Vedanta.8 This is the transcendent level of speech which leads beyond any particular expression or utterance. It corresponds to the nirodha or merged condition of the mind, the state of samadhi in Yoga practice.</p>
<p>The higher Self or Paramatman has its own natural language, which reverberates in silence. Its basic seed ideas are revealed in the great insights of Vedanta such as <em>Aham Brahmāsmi</em>, ‘I am the Divine Self’. This speech of the Self is the highest or supreme stage of speech, Para Vak. It consists of such realizations, not mere thoughts but concretely felt understandings as “I am All”, “All is One”, “The Self is the Entire Universe,” or just the expression of the breath as “I”. Prana is the “I am I” as it projects the sense of individual life. Our sense of self is rooted in speech, which in turn is based on the Divine Word.</p>
<h2 id="descent-of-the-sound-current">Descent of the Sound Current</h2>
<p>The ordinary human level of existence occurs mainly at the lower, outer or Vaikhari form of speech, while the Self-realized state is the Para or transcendent form. Developing our speech capacity from Vaikhari to Para is the inner movement of Mantra Yoga. Then we can take the power of speech back to Vaikhari or the audible word, but holding the consciousness of the Supreme! A teacher who can bring the Para or transcendent level of speech into the audible Vaikhari level becomes truly great. His very words become mantras.</p>
<p>An understanding of these four levels provides an important insight for Yoga practice. The power of speech must be brought down to the base of the spine and the root chakra to allow the energy of consciousness to ascend upward in the form of Kundalini in order to awaken our higher potentials. Before we ascend, we must first descend. To bring the power of speech inward and downward is the work of the Yoga of sound, whether as music, nada or mantra. Unless we have first done this, we are unlikely to be in a position to open the chakras or bring our energy up the Sushumna whatever else we may try to do.</p>
<p>To bring the current of speech down to the base of the spine, the breath must also be made to descend. In Vaikhari, we speak and breathe through the throat. In Madhyama, we speak and breathe through the heart. In Pashyanti, we speak and breathe through the navel. In Para, the breath merges into the Sushumna or base of the spine from which it automatically ascends. Try focusing your mind on these four different centers as the source of your breath. Note how your consciousness will progressively deepen.</p>
<p>To bring the current speech down to the base of the spine, our minds must also turn within. The mind must be withdrawn from the sensory centers in the head and allowed to dive deep within until it reaches the base of the spine, where the power of the Goddess is held in the Earth of our being.9 In this process of bringing the power of speech downward, the fire of speech or mantra develops and purifies the lower chakras, stimulating the Kundalini.10</p>
<h2 id="speech-as-kundalini">Speech as Kundalini</h2>
<p>Kundalini is the inner serpent power behind all higher Yoga practices, the energy of the subtle body or primary electrical force behind consciousness. In our ordinary state of awareness, the Kundalini lies dormant or sleeping at the base of the spine and only a small portion of its power serves to run our ordinary physical and mental activities. When awakened, the Kundalini ascends and merges the mind into the Absolute giving liberation and Self-realization. One connects directly into the cosmic energy or Shakti.</p>
<p>Kundalini is the portion of the universal power of speech that dwells inside each one of us. We use but a fragment of it for ordinary thought and communication. Yet Kundalini holds encrypted within itself the code of Self-realization, our higher evolutionary potential. This manifests when we develop higher powers of speech through mantra and the practice of silent communion during meditation.</p>
<p>Kundalini speech is energized mantra. In this regard, we must remember that Kundalini wears the garland of the mantras of the Sanskrit alphabet and ultimately the garland of all mantras.11 Mantra is the main yogic method used to arouse the Kundalini, particularly mantra repeated along with pranayama, meditation and deep devotion.</p>
<p>Yet working with Kundalini, we must remember that Kundalini is a form of the Goddess. She is closely connected to Kali, the dark Goddess of Infinite Space who represents Kriya Shakti or the power of yogic action. Kali works to set in motion the inner process of Yoga or self-integration within us. This proceeds through the dissolution of our attachment to the external world. Through it the external world gets withdrawn into the tattvas or cosmic principles, taking us back step by step from the gross elements to the Purusha or pure awareness, the higher Self.</p>
<hr>
<p>1 Chandogya Upanishad I.1.2.</p>
<p>2 Udana Vayu in Ayurvedic thought, which not only governs speech but also effort, expression, will power and the ability to ascend in consciousness, including awakening the Kundalini.</p>
<p>3 Such is the importance of mauna or the practice of silence (not speaking) in yogic teachings, which is often regarded as the most important form of tapas or self-discipline.</p>
<p>4 Collected works of Vasishta Ganapati Muni, Vol. VI., Vishvamimamsa V.4.6.</p>
<p>5 Repeating the Sanskrit alphabet is an important Vaikhari practice, particularly as aligned with deities like Sarasvati, Ganesha or Matangi. It links the Vaikhari state with the higher levels of speech.</p>
<p>6 Prana mantras like So`haṁ and Haṁsaḥ are often used at this level, though they have deeper applications as well. Pranic deities like Kali, Shiva or Hanuman help us here also.</p>
<p>7 Bija mantras that are connected to the inner light, like Hrīṁ, are important at this level. The Goddess Tara in Hindu thought relates to this level, as also Chhinnamasta, who grants higher perception.</p>
<p>8 The Mahavakyas that we discuss later in the book in the chapter on Vedic and Vedantic Mantra Yoga, like Tattvamasi, Thou art that. The deepest level of bija mantras like Oṁ and Hrīṁ also takes us to this level.</p>
<p>9 Bringing the sound current and breath down to the belly and base of the spine helps unite the two opposite currents of our vital energy, allowing the Prana down to unite with the Apana. It is an important therapy for treating Vata disorders, for strengthening Prana and for correcting the adverse downward movement of Apana. Vata type people tend to breathe and speak shallowly and quickly. Such deep sound therapy helps counter this tendency. They can begin by learning to chant Oṁ from the belly so that it resounds throughout the entire chakra and nervous system.</p>
<p>10 It is also part of a process of balancing our energies to the right and left and above and below such as we will discuss later in the book relative to mantra and pranayama.</p>
