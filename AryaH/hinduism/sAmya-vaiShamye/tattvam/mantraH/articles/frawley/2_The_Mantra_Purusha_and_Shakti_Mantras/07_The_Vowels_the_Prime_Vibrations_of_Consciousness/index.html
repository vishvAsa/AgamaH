  <p>It is not enough to use the sounds of words as a tool; we must understand the nature of the tool that we are using. Only then can we shape our speech in a creative and insightful manner. In the following chapters, we will examine each letter of the Sanskrit alphabet from the standpoint of mantra, starting with the vowels, looking for the connections between the nature of the sound, how it is pronounced, and its deeper meaning and effect upon us.</p>
<p>Usually we treat the sounds of our words mechanically and unconsciously. We do not reflect upon the quality of the sound itself, unless we are reciting poetry. The word is just a convenient vehicle to convey the idea or emotion that we have in mind. We are not aware of its sound power or intrinsic value. We use the sound of words to think about things, but do not actually think about the sound itself.</p>
<p>To understand mantra and the Sanskrit language, we must reconnect sound and meaning. In Mantra Yoga, we focus upon the sound directly, upon the inherent meaning of the sound apart from any object or idea that it may be ordinarily associated with in the outer world. We look at the sound itself rather than merely using it as an instrument. To shift our thinking in this manner can be difficult but is very rewarding. It puts us in touch with the poetry of nature and the resonance of the cosmic life.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, the vowels are the most important sounds and the most consistent in terms of their higher meanings in traditional texts. Yet as primal sounds, vowels carry a range of indications that can vary depending upon the factors they are related to. We should aim at grasping their essential qualities and full spectrum of possible derivative connotations. We cannot look upon them as formed words but must understand them on the level of sound essences.</p>
<p>The following study reflects primarily the Shaivite tradition, the philosophies that view the supreme reality as Shiva, pure consciousness, and his feminine counterpart of Shakti as the energy of consciousness. The letters of the Sanskrit alphabet are said to arise from Shiva’s drum, which he beats while performing his thunderous Tandava movement as Nataraj, the Lord of the cosmic dance of existence.1 However, the meanings given here are rooted in older Vedic teachings, where their outlines can be found. Moreover, the mantric meaning of the letters can be found in their application as root sounds of Sanskrit words.2</p>
<h2 id="the-three-prime-vowels">The Three Prime Vowels</h2>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Sanskrit recognizes ‘three primal vowels’ that are the basis of all other sounds and of all creation, which are A, I and U.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The primal sound-A (a as in another) is the most basic sound that forms the root of all other sounds. It relates to the Absolute (Brahman), pure existence, the infinite, the void, the unmanifest, and the changeless. It is said to be the Supreme Shiva and pure light.3</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The primal sound-I (i as in pin) is the sound of contraction, focus and direction. While the sound-A indicates inarticulate sound, the sound-I is the basis of articulate sound. The sound-I relates to Shakti or energy, the One, the atomic, the point or bindu, the seed power of will and desire through which all creation proceeds. As the sound reverberating in the center of the mouth, the greatest number of letters is connected to it.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The primal sound-U (u as in flute) made with the lips has an expansive power that is strong, harsh or even explosive, almost opposite the contracting or focused power of the sound-I. It relates to the Shiva principle in developed, expressed or articulated form, arising to pervade all things, in a successive and graduated manner. It is said to have the power of knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Intone these sounds yourself and feel their energy within you.</em></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how the A-sound holds the energy deep inside you. It relates to your sense of self, life, being and deeper awareness.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The I-sound draws the energy up and out in an almost linear manner, holding it at the top of the mouth. It is your basic power of expression and motivation.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The U-sound allows it to expand outward through the lips and beyond the body. It allows your energy to manifest in the outer world.</p>
<p>Now intone their long forms À* <em>as in father, Ã</em> <em>as in need, Ï</em> <em>as in mood. This makes their vibrations clearer. The long vowels represent the same energy of the short vowels but as doubled in length. As such, they represent a deepening of their energy and follow the same basic force and meaning. À</em> <em>allows one to rest in one’s being. Ã</em> *allows one’s energy to move and accelerate. Ï sustains expansion and expression.</p>
<p>The short vowels are considered to be solar and masculine in nature and represent the Shiva principle or will power. The long vowels are considered to be lunar and feminine in nature and represent the Shakti principle, the field of repose, rest or expansion. Yet the long vowels are more often used for mantric purposes as they can be intoned for a longer period of time and so have greater resonance.</p>
<p>In this explication of the three vowels, I am following specifically the Nandikesha Kashika, a short Shaivite text on the meaning of the alphabet. For the explication of the sixteen vowels as a whole, I will also bring in the meanings given by the Kashmiri Shaivite tradition like the great guru Abhinavagupta4 as well as that of Ganapati Muni. Let us examine a few verses from the Nandikesha Kashika, which after noting how the letters arise from Shiva’s drum, makes the following commentary on the three primal vowels.</p>
<p>**Verse 3. **The letter-A has the form of Brahman and is free of all qualities, dwelling in all things. Resorting to the letter-I, it takes the form of the world. The letter-U is Ishvara (the cosmic Lord).</p>
<p>**Verse 4. **The letter-A is the first of all letters. It is pure light, the supreme Shiva. Combining the beginning and end of all letters (A and H), the Self (aham) arises.</p>
<p>**Verse 7. **Through its proximity to the letter-A, from its having produced the world, the letter-I among all letters, from its Shakti-power is said to be the causal force.</p>
<p>**Verse 9. **The letter-A is of the nature of perception. The letter-I is said to be the portion of pure consciousness. The letter U-is said to be Vishnu, and from its pervasive power, it is Maheshvara.5</p>
<p>The letter-A is the pure Being or Absolute beyond all time, space, causation and creation. The letter-I is the Shakti or causative power that produces the manifest world. The letter-U is God or Ishvara as the Cosmic Lord ruling over and guiding the manifest world. Combining these letters A plus I, the absolute plus Shakti, is <em>Aiṁ</em> which is the sound Adya Shakti or the primal feminine, energy or Goddess principle. Combining A plus U is <em>Auṁ</em>, which is Adi Purusha or the primal masculine, Self or God principle.</p>

Sound Pronounced <em>a</em> as in <em>a</em>nother   Energetic Pure existence, simple affirmation/simple negation, light as bare illumination, unmanifest Self   Spiritual Absolute, Pure Consciousness, Godhead – Parabrahman, the Supreme Shiva   Physical Top of head, back of head   Psychological Deeper consciousness, source of mind and prana, primal Self   Yoga Promotes pratyahara, meditation, samadhi, detachment, crown chakra energies, Yoga nidra</p>
<p>The Sanskrit letter-A, the short vowel, is regarded as the first of all letters, just as the letter A is in other alphabets. The short A-vowel is the most primal of all sounds, the origin and source of all. It indicates the basic opening of the throat necessary to produce any type of sound, the root vibration of the vocal cords. It is the basis of the guttural group of letters beginning with the consonant-Ka. It is the basic sound of the prana or exhaling breath which produces all other sounds. The Sanskrit-A is the most neutral, basic and easy of all utterances that we can make.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to the primal sound-A. First, it is simple affirmation or being itself. It reflects or illumines things as they are. It is the basic resonance behind all things, the underlying note or tone. In this respect it resembles the verb is, which is presumed in all statements. It is ultimately our own self-existence that is presumed in all that we say and think. Following this idea the primal sound-A represents what is original, first, primary or most important.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the primal sound-A is negation. As the original and absolute sound, it transcends all that is derived, relative and manifest. It is the Absolute, beyond which there is nothing, the Void that is beyond all name and form. The letter-A in Sanskrit serves to indicate negation when it is placed at the beginning of a word. For example, <em>rupa</em> means form, <em>a-rupa</em> means formless.</p>
<p>Tantric yogis call short A-vowel as Anuttara,6 meaning that from which there is nothing greater, the supreme ultimate. They also call it <em>Amr̥ta</em>,7 the immortal and deathless, the immortal nectar that we are always imbibing as we partake of being. Sri Aurobindo states that the letter-A relates to absolute existence, of which other sounds are relative existence. The Vedas say that the letter-A is Brahman or the Absolute.8 It is the first of all the vowels that constitute the spirit (Shiva or Purusha).9 It indicates the center, origin, being, Self and Supreme.</p>
<p>At a physical level, the sound-A serves to ground and stabilize our being and all its processes down to a cellular level. It is the root or base tone behind all the other vibrations of our organism, which we return to in a state of deep sleep. Repeating this sound serves to attune, harmonize and balance our entire organic field. It brings us back into our body and deeper awareness, connecting to the root energy of the heart and the center of our being.</p>
<p>At a psychological level, the sound-A returns us to the ground of our being and helps us shut off our outer noise. It calms and silences the minds and senses and takes the pranas back to their core energy. It helps us settle, let go, detach and simplify. It connects us to our deepest Self and being.</p>
<p><strong>P</strong>* <em>– The Long Vowel <em>À</em></em>*</p>
<p><strong>The Absolute in Expansion as the Space of the Higher Self</strong>
Sound Pronounced <em>a</em> as in f<em>a</em>ther   Energetic Higher Self or Atman, Self-expansion and awareness of the Absolute   Spiritual Power of bliss, the space of consciousness   Physical Forehead, face, expansion and circulation of energies   Psychological Outgoing and creative aspect of mind, conscious mind, conscious Self   Yoga Promotes contemplation, meditation, happiness, contentment, creativity, space</p>
<p>Just as the short A-vowel represents the unbounded pure being of the Absolute, the long À-vowel represents its expansion into infinite space, <em>Àkāśa</em>. As the short A-vowel represents pure being or Sat, the long À-vowel represents its manifestation as bliss, <em>Ànanda</em>, which is the delight or contentment inherent in being. It also relates to the power of attraction, <em>Àkarśana</em>, and helps draw things to us and aids us in returning to the source, having a kind of magnetic energy.10</p>
<p>As the short vowel-A represents the absolute in a universal sense; the long vowel-À* *represents the Absolute in a manifest sense, the individual Self or <em>Àtman</em>.11 As the short A-vowel is pure Shiva, its long form shows the energy of Shakti inherent in Shiva, the power of rest inherent in the Absolute. As the short A-vowel is the Self in its underlying nature, the long À-vowel is the Self in its outward expansion. In Vaishnava thought, as the short A-vowel is Vishnu or Krishna, long À-vowel is the serpent Ananta, on which Vishnu reclines.</p>
<p>At a physical level, the long À-vowel is releasing, relaxing and revitalizing. Repeat ‘aa’, like opening your throat to reveal your tonsils, and feel this for yourself. The sound expands and releases the prana. It has a similar effect at a psychological and spiritual level, allowing us to relax into the ground of our being but with a certain expansiveness. As the short A-vowel relates to the consciousness in its unmanifest form (which at a lower level includes the subconscious), the long À-vowel relates to consciousness as mind, expression, feeling in the broader sense.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>* <em>– The Short Vowel <em>I</em></em>*</p>
<p><strong>The One, Point, Atom, God, Creator and Cosmic Lord, Divine Will</strong>
Sound As in ‘eat’ but shorter   Energetic Contraction, focus, point energy, unity   Spiritual God as ruling consciousness, Cosmic Lord   Physical Right eye, guiding energy of the body, motivating prana   Psychological Perception, logic, judgment, will power, guidance, motivation   Yoga Yoga of seeing, dharana, will power, discrimination, knowledge</p>
<p>Just as the letter-A represents the unlimited and has no boundaries, the letter-I represents unlimited contraction or concentration. The letter-I is the infinitesimal or atomic, the point that contains all time and space, which explodes through the Big Bang. This ultimate point is called the bindu in Tantric thought, meaning not only the point but also the seed, as what is concentrated must again expand.</p>
<p>As the letter-A is the Infinite, the letter-I is the One. The field of the infinite (A) must be contracted into a point (I) in order to create the universe. As the letter-A is God as the Absolute or Godhead in the formless or monistic sense, the letter-I is God as the cosmic ruler, the creator or God in the theistic sense, the lord of the worlds or Ishvara.</p>
<p>While the vowel-A is the background of all sounds, the vowel-I is the means through which all the other sounds are made. In this regard, it is the Mother or Shakti principle. It is connected to the palatal group of sounds beginning with the consonant-Ca, but also with the cerebral and dental groups of sounds using the Ta and Da sounds, making it the source of the largest number of sounds.12</p>
<p>The sound-I, starting as a point, moves in a straight line. It represents will, motivation, orientation, time and direction. It shows the application of force in a specific and determined manner in order to bring about a specific result, which is the creation of the universe. Tantrics call the letter-I as Iccha, which means will, desire or love. From Iccha-Shakti or will-power all other forces come into being.</p>
<p>As the letter-A is the spirit as the Absolute, the letter-I is the spirit as embodied. In this sense of directed versus undirected existence the letter-I indicates the individual soul (Jivatman) as the letter-A is the supreme soul (Paramatman). Sri Aurobindo relates the letter-I to relative existence, but it is only so in the sense as the original creative idea and force behind relative existence. As the letter-A is the Absolute, the letter-I is the causal force.</p>
<p>As the letter-A is the root power of existence, the letter-I is the power of vision, insight and imagination. It focuses this power of existence along a particular line, leading to a specific manifestation. The letter-I gives us life, energy, motivation and a goal to achieve.</p>
<p>At a physical level, the sound-I serves to set in motion and sustain all the organic processes within us. At a psychological level, it similarly increases our vision, motivation, focus, energy and determination. Its spiritual implications are of the same nature, allowing to us to connect with the Divine will and energy within us.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>* <em>– The Long Vowel <em>Ã</em></em>*</p>
<p><strong>Will as Ruling Power, Divine Mother, Ishvara Shakti</strong>
Sound As in d<em>ee</em>p   Energetic Ruling power, executive and creative force in its expansion   Spiritual Divine Mother, Divine Energy, Shakti, Mahamaya   Physical Left eye, left energy of the body, power of love   Psychological Creative vision, emotion, empathy   Yoga Imagination, visualization, devotional concentration, dharana</p>
<p>The long Ī-vowel is phonetically represented by the sound ‘ee’. According to the Tantras, it is the expansion of the short-I vowel, intensifying will (iccha) into ruling power (<em>Ī**śāna</em>). It is called <em>Shakti bija</em>, the seed of Shakti or <em>Maya bija</em>, the seed of Maya, as it shows the creative will in its extension.</p>
<p>As the short-I vowel represents Ishvara or the cosmic lord, the long Ī-vowel represents <em>Ishvara Shakti</em>, the Divine creative, originative and executive power, the Divine Mother. This is why so many Shakti or Goddess mantras have this sound (note <em>Hrīṁ</em>,* Krīṁ*, <em>Klīṁ</em>,* Strīṁ*). It magnifies the electrical energy of the short I-sound.</p>
<p>It is also called <em>Shanti-bija</em> or the ‘sound of peace’ because its forces bring unity, homogeneity and harmony to all things. It is said to be *Vishnu bija *as the power of the creator Vishnu. It is said to be the lotus because it holds the lines of all manifestation. It is said to pervade all things, like the current of energy (I) flowing in space (A).</p>
<p>At a physical level, the long Ī-vowel awakens our higher prana, stimulating the nervous system and improving our vision. At a psychological level, it helps us develop insight, vision, imagination and motivation. Spiritually, it has a similar electrifying effect that invigorates all our higher practices.</p>
<h2 id="g--the-short-vowel-u">g – The Short Vowel U</h2>
<p><strong>Vibration, Unfoldment, Creation, Power</strong>
Sound As in fl<em>u</em>te   Energetic Vibration, work, effort, action, development, progression   Spiritual Expansive force and penetrating power, ascending to new dimensions   Physical Right ear, hearing, audio-perception, circulation of energies   Psychological Intuition, prana, comprehension, mental grasp   Yoga Perceptive listening, knowledge, peripheral awareness, learning, formless meditation, meditation on the void</p>
<p>The letter-U represents vibration or nada. It shows the opening of the creative force (<em>Unmeṣa</em>) into the external world. As the letter-I represents the Divine will power holding the seed of creation, the letter-U represents the Divine force unfolding, blossoming or blooming and setting forth the pattern of creation, allowing the worlds to arise and take shape like a blowing of bubbles. It adds depth, dimension and form to the initial creative direction of the letter-I. The letter-I is the concentration of energies behind creation, U is the expansion of creative energies which follows.</p>
<p>The vowel-U has a circular and expanding effect, just as its pronunciation by the opening of the lips, and projects things into manifestation. It establishes a field in which energies are both sustained and protected; its round vibration creating the spheres, lokas or world systems. It projects the labial group of sounds (those made with the lips) and the consonants beginning with the sound-Pa.</p>
<p>The sound-U is the strongest of the three primal vowels and has definite force, if not possible violence behind it. While the sound-A is expanding in the sense of releasing, relaxing and liberating, the sound-U is expanding in the sense of energizing, creating and forming, but at the same time having a complementary effect to remove or destroy. The letter-U is thus dualistic. It both creates and destroys and thereby sustains a vibratory field. The letter-U creates suspense, drama and emotion. It often has a violent or harsh force connected with it.</p>
<p>As the letter-A is the Absolute and the letter-I is the Creative Will and executive force, the letter-U is the Creative power and personality. As the letter-I is the bindu or primal point, the letter-U is primal vibration, Nada. As the letter-I represents will, the letter-U represents knowledge. Will creates a field of knowledge in order to manifest itself.</p>
<p>At a physical level, the letter-U helps us improve work and effort, granting us strength, resistance and durability. At a psychological level, it grants similar qualities and gives us an emotional power and reliance. Spiritually, the letter-U allows us to apply our energy into our practices and open up new fields of discovery.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>* <em>– The Long Vowel <em>Ï</em></em>*</p>
<p><strong>The Wave, the Vibratory Field</strong>
Sound As in shoot   Energetic Vibration, music, nada   Spiritual Field of Divine force and action, development, transformation   Physical Left ear, creative hearing, intuition   Psychological Receptivity, openness, emotional vulnerability   Spiritual Receptive listening, opening of the mind and heart, listening to the inner sounds or nada</p>
<p>The long vowel-Ï* <em>intensifies the U-dimension of opening or unfoldment as vibration. While the short-vowel-U means opening, the long-vowel-Ï</em> *creates sustained opening, which is vibration.</p>
<p>It represents the space of creation that holds all the forces, principles and tendencies to be manifest later. In this regard is it different than the space of the long vowel-À, which is more the unmanifest space. It gives protection. It weaves. It is said to be like a series of waves (<em>Ïrmi</em>). It brings about the unfoldment of all the worlds. Yet when we turn it within, it brings about the dissolution of the worlds.</p>
<p>At a physical level, the long vowel-Ï* *allows the waves of prana to envelop the body and promote healing energies. At a psychological level, it breaks down resistance and clears the subconscious mind. At a spiritual level, it promotes revelation and surrender to the higher forces.</p>
<h2 id="the-r-and-l-sounds-as-vowels">The R and L Sounds as Vowels</h2>
<p>Sanskrit recognizes two special vowel forms of the letters R and L and their short and long forms as well. These are mainly the soft forms of these sounds as we commonly know them. While these letters are not used much by themselves, they are necessary to define the other groups of consonants.</p>
<p>Adding these to the three pure vowels A, I, and U, it provides the Sanskrit language with five prime vowels. The vowel-*Ê *is the root of the cerebral series of sounds. The vowel-*Ä *creates the dental series. These vowels are the seeds of their semi-vowel forms, which are the letters that we usually know by these sounds. These two letters also exist in short and long forms, though the long forms are even rarer in their occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>W,</strong>* <em>Ø –The Soft or Vowel Sound <em>R</em></em>*</p>
<p>This is the soft or unrolled Ŗ, while the consonant Ŗ is the rolled form. You experience it on the top of the mouth. The transliterated form of this letter is an R with a dot below it (Ŗ).
Sound Soft and unrolled R (as in macab<em>re</em>), often followed by a short-i sound   Energetic Fire, color, light, warmth   Spiritual Dharma, Cosmic Law, principle order; Divine Father as ruler of Heaven   Physical Nostrils, prana, motivation   Psychological Mind, intellect, perception, judgment   Yoga Heating forms of pranayama, solar energy, judgment, discrimination</p>
<p>The letter-Ra in itself is a semi-vowel. The vowel-Ŗ is its precursor and follows the same basic line of meaning. First there is a connection of the R-sound with the concept of order and truth (Ŗtam), the foundation of dharma in the universe. We find this meaning even in the English language r- words like right, rite, rhythm, and rectitude.</p>
<p>Second, the letter-Ra connotes heat, light and fire, particularly in manifest form. The vowel-Ŗ is the seed of fire, like a burning ember. We can use it to reach the core of the fire element. Cosmically, it also relates to the heavenly realm or realm of light. It is connected to the deity Rudra, who is the form of Shiva governing light and sound.13 It relates to the Purusha or higher Self working through and governing the forces of manifestation.</p>
<p>At a physical level, the vowel-Ŗ stimulates the seed of fire and prana within the body, circulatory and nervous systems. At a psychological level, it promotes right thinking, judgment, perception, and right values. At a spiritual level, it connects us to our higher dharma.</p>
<p>There is a long vowel form of this letter <em>Ë</em> but it is rarely used and not significantly different in meaning. It has a more feminine energy, representing the field of light, and being oriented to the left side of the body and the left nostril. It is most commonly pronounced as a soft r with an ee sound afterwards (ree).</p>
<p><strong>X‰ v ¦ –The Soft or Vowel Sound <em>Ä</em></strong></p>
<p>The vowel-Ļ is a soft L-sound, as opposed to a voiced L-sound. It is a rare sound in actual Sanskrit, so much so that most Sanskrit fonts do not contain it. The vowels-Ŗ and Ļ form a pair as the fire and earth elements, Heaven as the realm of light and Earth as the realm of form, God and Nature, Purusha and Prakriti. The two are Shiva and Shakti, as the mountain God and the valley Goddess. They represent the seed or causal principles and energies behind manifestation. They hold the entire manifestation in the root form.
Sound Soft L as in tab<em>le</em>, yet commonly pronounced like ‘lri’   Energetic Descending formative energy   Spiritual Joy, creativity; Divine Mother as the Earth   Physical Cheeks, sense of touch, emotion   Psychological Feeling, emotion, happiness   Yoga Cooling forms of pranayama, lunar and earth energy, devotion, visualization, imagination</p>
<p>There is a long vowel of this vowel (Ļ) but rarely used and not significantly different in meaning. It has a more feminine energy and connection with the left side of the body. It is more commonly pronounced like ‘lree’, but there are some variations in how different groups chant it.</p>
<h2 id="four-compound-vowels">Four Compound Vowels</h2>
<p>The four Sanskrit compound vowels (diphthongs) reflect the meanings of the two shorter vowels that they are composed of. They are commonly used in Sanskrit mantras.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>* <em>– The Vowel <em>E</em></em>*</p>
<p>The Sanskrit E-vowel is composed of the combination of the Sanskrit sound-A and the sound-I and combines their meanings. It is called Yoni Bija, meaning the womb or the source of all. It indicates unity, eka. It shows the state of all primal forces in their original condition of unity before manifestation, in which their differentiation is implicit but not yet evident.14 It is connected to the feminine principle as the premanifestation phase of Shakti.
Sound Like the long vowel-a as in c<em>a</em>ke   Energetic Unity, union, descending creative energy   Spiritual Seed state of forces; the Divine Mother getting ready to create   Physical Upper lip, initial phase of speaking   Psychological Feeling, balance, harmony, receptivity   Yoga Devotion, concentration, reintegration</p>
<p><em><strong>:</strong> – The Vowel <strong>AI</strong></em></p>
<p>After <em>Oṁ</em>,* Aiṁ *is the most important of all the mantras. While <em>Oṁ</em> represents unmanifest speech or prana, <em>Aiṁ</em> represents manifest speech in its seed form. <em>Aiṁ</em> develops the focus, direction, vision and knowledge of the I-dimension of sound to its fullest extent. It electrifies the mind and speech for knowledge, teaching and creative expression. As such, <em>Aiṁ</em> is the Mantra of Adya Shakti or the Supreme Feminine power and helps invoke that power and grace within us. It shows the concentration of energies prior to their full manifestation. We will examine it in detail under Shakti mantras.
Sound As in the word ‘<em>ai</em>sle’   Energetic Focus, expression, motivation, calling   Spiritual Intelligence and creativity in manifestation, guiding intelligence   Physical Lower lip, tongue; improves flow of energy in the head, mouth and lungs   Psychological Mind, intellect and creative intelligence   Yoga Mantra Yoga, concentration, teaching, counseling</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>* <em>– The Vowel <em>O</em></em>*</p>
<p><em>Oṁ</em> is probably the most famous and most important of the Sanskrit mantras. It is said to be the Word of God, the Word of the Guru, Atman, and Ishvara. It represents both the manifest and the unmanifest Brahman. It causes our energy to open, expand, ascend and unify. We will examine it more specifically under Shakti mantras.
Sound Like the o in ‘yoke’   Energetic Shiva energy manifest and unmanifest, affirmative, ascending   Spiritual Universal ruling power, guiding and expanding force   Physical Upper jaw, prana, mouth; opens the prana in the head and spine   Psychological Clears the mental and emotional field, connects mind and higher Self   Yoga Knowledge, devotion, unity, pranayama, energizes all the Yogas</p>
<p><strong>;</strong>* <em>– The Vowel <em>AU</em></em>*</p>
<p><em>Auṁ</em> creates the most complete manifestation of the vowels. It takes the primal-A sound and expands it to its fullest extent with the open long-U sound. <em>Oṁ</em> and <em>Auṁ</em> are similar. <em>Auṁ</em> is just an extension of the <em>Oṁ</em> energy, giving it more energy. It is said to relate to the Adi Purusha or the prime cosmic masculine energy, having a power to fill, pervade and transcend.
Sound As in ‘<em>ou</em>t’   Energetic Full expansion of Divine energy and consciousness   Spiritual Shiva principle in full expression pervading the universe   Physical Lower teeth and jaw, primary prana of mouth and face in full expression   Psychological Expansive aspect of mind and prana   Yoga Promotes contemplation, affirmation, pranayama, samadhi</p>
<p><strong>e8‰ e7 – Anusvara and Visarga, <em>Aṁ, Aḥ</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primal Energies of Contraction and Expansion</strong></p>
<p>Most Sanskrit bija mantras end with Anusvara, which allows their sounds to vibrate within the mind and nervous system. Yet a few are done with the Visarga to help project the force of prana through them. A few mantras can be done with either Anusvara or Visarga, which changes their effect.15</p>
<p>Anusvara is often an extension of the primal short A-vowel sound and has the same general range of indications in Tantric thought. It allows all other sounds to merge into the pure essence of sound at the top of the head, the A-sound of the Absolute, Brahman. It is said to be the Shiva-bindu or the ‘point of Shiva’ that merges the entire universe back into pure unity. It is often related to the mind and the Moon. Visarga is often connected to the long-A vowel in terms of its range of meanings.</p>
<p>In addition, it is used by itself as the mantra ‘<em>aḥ</em>’, which stands for the Self (aham), Prana, the Sun and the day. It gives light and power and connects with our inner being and source of energy and vitality. It is only used with a few mantras like <em>Sauḥ, Śriḥ, Hrīḥ</em>, as well as <em>Namaḥ</em> for giving additional expressive or creative energy to them. It imparts Shakti to sounds as manifest power.</p>
<p><strong>Anusvara,</strong>* <strong>Aṁ</strong>*
Sound Final nasal sound as in Oṁ, drawing in of a sound and merging it into the mind   Energetic Holding, harmonizing, internalizing, dissolving within   Spiritual Mergence in the Deity, Being or the Absolute, Shiva   Physical Head, top of the head, upper palate   Psychological Mind, deep feeling, profound knowing   Yoga Promotes contemplation, mergence, internalization, detachment, samadhi</p>
<p><strong>Visarga,</strong>* <strong>Aḥ</strong>*
Sound Soft-H as in Namaḥ , release of sound through exhalation   Energetic Releasing, expanding, expressing generating energy   Spiritual Higher Self in transcendence, first pranic manifestation, Shakti   Physical Face, forehead, lower palate   Psychological Outgoing or expanding energy and self-expression, ego, prana   Yoga Promotes meditation, Self-inquiry, awareness of original prana</p>
<hr>
<p>1 As in the fourteen Maheshvara Sutras of Panini&rsquo;s grammar.</p>
<p>2 This is Sanskrit etymology or Nirukta.</p>
<p>3 Parama Shiva, Prakasha.</p>
<p>4 Specifically his Paratrishika Vivarana and Tantra Sara.</p>
<p>5 Nandikesa Kasika, Bulletin of the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras, (Chennai), Vol. III. No. 2. 1950.</p>
<p>6 Paratrishika Vivarana of Abhinavagupta, Jaidev Singh edition available.</p>
<p>7 Yogini Hridaya Tantra, Pujasamketa 30-31.</p>
<p>8 Aitareya Aranyaka II.3.8.</p>
<p>9 A is Ananta, the infinite, endless or boundless, an-anta. It is akshara, the primal letter, the central point, the undecaying a-kshara. It is Agni, the primal fire, the indestructible, a-gni, the inner guide ag-ni.</p>
<p>10 The Sanskrit long vowel-À serves as a prefix to intensify or to reverse the meaning of the words it is added to. For example, nanda means joy, Ànanda means bliss. Gacchati means &ldquo;he goes&rdquo;, āgacchati means &ldquo;he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11 Particularly what is called the Jivatman.</p>
<p>12 Note Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s Tantrasara, third chapter, where he refers to the Shambhava Upaya.</p>
<p>13 Two key Sanskrit words for the meaning of the vowel-Ê are Êtam, meaning truth, particularly harmony and order in the cosmic manifestation, and Êṣi or seer, one who has the knowledge and energy of that truth.</p>
<p>14 It represents the dimension of will (i or iccha) as further brought into existence. Note the progression: short-vowel-I or will, long-vowel-I as ruling power, diphthong ai as majesty.</p>
<p>15 For example, the mantra Sau, which can be either Sauṁ or Sauḥ. Sauḥ is most common and is used to project energy or Shakti as well as the power of Soma.</p>
