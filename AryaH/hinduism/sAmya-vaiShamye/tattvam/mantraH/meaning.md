title: Meaning
---

## Intro
- To understand what a mantra says and, to feel what the mantra feels: This is one good reason why learning Sanskrit, with its stresses (svara-s) is valuable.
- General background on multi-level ways to derive meaning out of texts in general is presented [here](../../bases/books/index/).

## Meaning denouncers
- Some claim that it is not necessary to understand what the words in the mantra mean (to whatever extant the grammar would allow). 


- kautsa opinion is denounced by authorities such as yAska, shaunaka and shikShA texts.
  - Such opinion is condemned in quotes in shikSha texts which denounce pATha without "understanding" with the aid of vedAnga-s (शीघ्रपाठी…).


## Importance of meaning
> भावार्थः सम्प्रदायार्थः  
> निगमार्थश्च कौलिकः।  
> तथा सर्वरहस्यार्थो  
> महातत्त्वार्थ एव च॥  
> - योगिनीहृदये

- While a mantra can contain meanings beyond what is revealed by mere grammar and vocabulary, that lower level of meaning is important in itself, and as an aid to access deeper meanings.

मन्त्रार्थज्ञानम् उत्तमम् ।  
तस्मादर्थं विजानीयाद्  
उक्तेन जपकृन्नरः ।  
विश्वास-भक्तिभ्यां द्वाभ्यां  
जपादीनां महत्-तरम् ।  
फलं भवेज्-जपकृताम्  
इति वेदेषु भाषितम् ।

इति भारद्वाजः।
