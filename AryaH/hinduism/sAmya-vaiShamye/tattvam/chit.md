title: चित् Consciousness
---

## सत् We exist.
- "First: can we question our own existence? If yes, even such questions will be the product of our own existence." [SG_IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/foundations-of-hinduism/)

## चित् 
We are aware, to some extant at least. And we may even like it. This is because we are conscious. 

- Consciousness is fundamental constituent of the universe, more fundamental than time, space, matter and energy. We suppose this given the "hard problem of consciousness".
- Consciousness is all-pervasive. A stone or dead wood is conscious but they are generally almost entirely of the guNa tamas.



## आनन्दः We want Happiness.
- "Happiness is our highest goal. All our suffering, struggle, and effort invariably are exercises towards the attainment of happiness. Happiness is the one point where all our diverging natures converge." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).
- "Our own experience reveals that happiness is a state of completeness where no inadequacy is felt." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).
- "This state of fulfilment, though lasting for a moment, is essentially the same for everyone. Leo Tolstoy starts off his novel Anna Karenina with the words: ‘ All happy homes are alike. But every unhappy home is unhappy in its own way.’ " [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).

## Source of Happiness
- "It is also interesting to note that sorrow cannot be generated internally, for our true state is bliss and not agony." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).
- "Indeed, joy is also a product of external influences. But the happiness that we gain externally is short-lived and eventually leads to sorrow because it operates in the material world." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).
- "Those who seek existence, awareness, and bliss from outwardly sources try to establish authority over others. They declare their own freedom at the cost of other’s freedom and invariably become tyrants, blemishing humankind."[SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).
- "Sat–cit–ānanda is not something to ‘attain’ but it is something to ‘realize,’ for it is always within." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).

## Deep sleep analogy
- "Though our experiences in the wakeful state or even in the dream state are entirely different from place to place, time to time, person to person, and thought to thought, in sound sleep all of us have the same universal experience of absolute immersion and absolute detachment. Sleep is a highly refreshing and blissful state indeed." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).
- "In the state of sound sleep, neither the sense organs nor the mind are in action. However, there is no paucity of bliss. There is absolutely no inadequacy. It is a state of complete saturation. For our enquiry, we should start our analysis from this point. No study will become meaningful without a common or universal basis, such as this, to compare and contrast with any other experience. The Upanishads start their self-enquiry with this analysis."[SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).

## Commonality
- "Absolute existence (sat), absolute awareness (cit), and absolute bliss (ānanda) that are independent of external factors constitute the nature of the self (ātman)."
- Some postulate that this is common to every being (living or not). Eg: "Don’t these instances reveal that existence, awareness, and happiness are natural states of every living being? Even in the physical world, we see concepts such as equilibrium, valency, and steady-state, pointing to a similar truth." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/)..
