title: चित् Consciousness
---

## सत् 
We exist.

> "First: can we question our own existence? If yes, even such questions will be the product of our own existence." [SG_IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/foundations-of-hinduism/)

## चित् 
We are aware, to some extant at least. And we may even like it. This is because we are conscious. 

- Consciousness is fundamental constituent of the universe, more fundamental than time, space, matter and energy. We suppose this given the "hard problem of consciousness".
- Consciousness is all-pervasive. A stone or dead wood is conscious but they are generally almost entirely of the guNa tamas.

## आनन्दः
> "It is also interesting to note that sorrow cannot be generated internally, for our true state is bliss and not agony." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/).


## Pervasion into achit
Some postulate that this is common to every being (living or not). Eg: 

> "Don’t these instances reveal that existence, awareness, and happiness are natural states of every living being? Even in the physical world, we see concepts such as equilibrium, valency, and steady-state, pointing to a similar truth." [SG_IF15-2](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-pillars/)..
