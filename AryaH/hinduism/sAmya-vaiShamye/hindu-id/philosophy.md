> I use the term ``Philosophy in the Sanskrit cosmopolis'' (``Sanskrit philosophy" for short) in order to cover all philosophical texts produced in a world in which Sanskrit was a major intellectual player, even for authors who wrote in other languages. - Elisa Freschi

Might use "Hindu philosophy" to cover all philosophical texts produced in a world in which Hindus were a major intellectual player, even for authors who belonged to counter-religions.
