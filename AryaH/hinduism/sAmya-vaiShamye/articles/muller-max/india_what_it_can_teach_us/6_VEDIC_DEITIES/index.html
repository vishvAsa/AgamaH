  <meta property="og:description" content="The next important phenomenon of nature which was represented in the Veda as a terrestrial deity is Fire, in Sanskrit Agni, in Latin ignis. In the worship which is paid to the Fire and in the high praises bestowed on Agni we can clearly perceive the traces of a period in the history of man in which not only the most essential comforts of life, but life itself, depended on the knowledge of producing fire. To us fire has become so familiar that we can hardly form an idea of what life would be without it. But how did the ancient dwellers on earth get command and possession of fire? The Vedic poets tell us that fire first came to them from the sky, in the form of lightning, but that it disappeared again, and that then Mātariśvan, a being to a certain extent like Prometheus, brought it back and confided it to the safe keeping of the clan of the Bhr̥gus (Phlegyas).1">

  <p>The next important phenomenon of nature which was represented in the Veda as a terrestrial deity is Fire, in Sanskrit Agni, in Latin <em>ignis</em>. In the worship which is paid to the Fire and in the high praises bestowed on Agni we can clearly perceive the traces of a period in the history of man in which not only the most essential comforts of life, but life itself, depended on the knowledge of producing fire. To us fire has become so familiar that we can hardly form an idea of what life would be without it. But how did the ancient dwellers on earth get command and possession of fire? The Vedic poets tell us that fire first came to them from the sky, in the form of lightning, but that it disappeared again, and that then Mātariśvan, a being to a certain extent like Prometheus, brought it back and confided it to the safe keeping of the clan of the Bhr̥gus (Phlegyas).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In other poems we hear of the mystery of fire being produced by rubbing pieces of wood; and here it is a curious fact that the name of the wood thus used for rubbing is in Sanskrit Pramantha, a word which, as Kuhn has shown, would in Greek come very near to the name of Prometheus. The possession of fire, whether by preserving it as sacred on the hearth, or by producing it at pleasure with the fire-drill, represents an enormous step in early civilization. It enabled people to cook their meat instead of eating it raw; it gave them the power of carrying on their work by night; and in colder climates it really preserved them from being frozen to death. No wonder, therefore, that the fire should have been praised and worshipped as the best and kindest of gods, the only god who had come down from heaven to live on earth, the friend of man, the messenger of the gods, the mediator between gods and men, the immortal among mortals. He, it is said, protects the settlements of the Aryans, and frightens away the black-skinned enemies.</p>
<p>Soon, however, fire was conceived by the Vedic poets under the more general character of light and warmth, and then the presence of Agni was perceived, not only on the hearth and the altar, but in the Dawn, in the Sun, and in the world beyond the Sun, while at the same time his power was recognized as ripening, or as they called it, as cooking, the fruits of the earth, and as supporting also the warmth and the life of the human body. From that point of view Agni, like other powers, rose to the rank of a Supreme God.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> He is said to have stretched out heaven and earth—naturally, because without his light heaven and earth would have been invisible and undistinguishable. The next poet says that Agni held heaven aloft by his light, that he kept the two worlds asunder; and in the end Agni is said to be the progenitor and father of heaven and earth, and the maker of all that flies, or walks, or stands, or moves on earth.</p>
<p>Here we have once more the same process before our eyes. The human mind begins with being startled by a single or repeated event, such as the lightning striking a tree and devouring a whole forest, or a spark of fire breaking forth from wood being rubbed against wood, whether in a forest, or in the wheel of a carriage, or at last in a fire-drill, devised on purpose. Man then begins to wonder at what to him is a miracle, none the less so because it is a fact, a simple, natural fact. He sees the effects of a power, but he can only guess at its cause, and if he is to speak of it, he can only do so by speaking of it as an agent, or as something like a human agent, and, if in some respects not quite human, in others more than human or superhuman. Thus the concept of Fire grew; and while it became more and more generalized, it also became more sublime, more incomprehensible, more divine. Without Agni, without fire, light, and warmth, life would have been impossible. Hence he became the author and giver of life, of the life of plants and animals and of men; and his favor having once been implored for &ldquo;light and life and all things,&rdquo; what wonder that in the minds of some poets, and in the traditions of this or that village-community he should have been raised to the rank of a supreme ruler, a god above all gods, their own true god!</p>
<hr>
<p>We now proceed to consider the powers which the ancient poets might have discovered in the air, in the clouds, and, more particularly, in those meteoric conflicts which by thunder, lightning, darkness, storms, and showers of rain must have taught man that very important lesson that he was not alone in this world. Many philosophers, as you know, believe that all religion arose from fear or terror, and that without thunder and lightning to teach us, we should never have believed in any gods or god. This is a one-sided and exaggerated view. Thunderstorms, no doubt, had a large share in arousing feelings of awe and terror, and in making man conscious of his weakness and dependence. Even in the Veda, Indra is introduced as saying: &ldquo;Yes, when I send thunder and lightning, then you believe in me.&rdquo; But what we call religion would never have sprung from fear and terror alone. <em>Religion is trust</em>, and that trust arose in the beginning from the impressions made on the mind and heart of man by the order and wisdom of nature, and more particularly by those regularly recurring events, the return of the sun, the revival of the moon, the order of the seasons, the law of cause and effect, gradually discovered in all things, and traced back in the end to a cause of all causes, by whatever name we choose to call it.</p>
<p>Still the meteoric phenomena had, no doubt, their important share in the production of ancient deities; and in the poems of the Vedic Rishis they naturally occupy a very prominent place. If we were asked who was the principal god of the Vedic period, we should probably, judging from the remains of that poetry which we possess, say it was Indra, the god of the blue sky, the Indian Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, the giver of rain, the wielder of the thunder-bolt, the conqueror of darkness, and of all the powers of darkness, the bringer of light, the source of freshness, vigor, and life, the ruler and lord of the whole world. Indra is this, and much more in the Veda. He is supreme in the hymns of many poets, and may have been so in the prayers addressed to him by many of the ancient septs or village communities in India. Compared with him the other gods are said to be decrepit old men. Heaven, the old Heaven or Dyaus, formerly the father of all the gods, nay the father of Indra himself, bows before him, and the Earth trembles at his approach. Yet Indra never commanded the permanent allegiance of all the other gods, like Zeus and Jupiter; nay, we know from the Veda itself that there were skeptics, even at that early time, who denied that there was any such thing as Indra.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>By the side of Indra, and associated with him in his battles, and sometimes hardly distinguishable from him, we find the representatives of the wind, called Vāta or Vāyu, and the more terrible storm-gods, the Maruts, literally the Smashers.</p>
<p>When speaking of the Wind, a poet says:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> &ldquo;Where was he born? Whence did he spring? the life of the gods, the germ of the world! That god moves about where he listeth, his voices are heard, but he is not to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Maruts are more terrible than Vāta, the wind. They are clearly the representatives of such storms as are known in India, when the air is darkened by dust and clouds, when in a moment the trees are stripped of their foliage, their branches shivered, their stems snapped, when the earth seems to reel and the mountains to shake, and the rivers are lashed into foam and fury. Then the poet sees the Maruts approaching with golden helmets, with spotted skins on their shoulders, brandishing golden spears, whirling their axes, shooting fiery arrows, and cracking their whips amid thunder and lightning. They are the comrades of Indra, sometimes, like Indra, the sons of Dyaus or the sky, but also the sons of another terrible god, called Rudra, or the Howler, a fighting god, to whom many hymns are addressed. In him a new character is evolved, that of a healer and saviour—a very natural transition in India, where nothing is so powerful for dispelling miasmas, restoring health, and imparting fresh vigor to man and beast, as a thunderstorm, following after weeks of heat and drought.</p>
<p>All these and several others, such as Parjanya and the r̥bhus, are the gods of mid-air, the most active and dramatic gods, ever present to the fancy of the ancient poets, and in several cases the prototypes of later heroes, celebrated in the epic poems of India. In battles, more particularly, these fighting gods of the sky were constantly invoked.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Indra is the leader in battles, the protector of the bright Aryans, the destroyer of the black aboriginal inhabitants of India. &ldquo;He has thrown down fifty thousand black fellows,&rdquo; the poet says, &ldquo;and their strongholds crumbled away like an old rag.&rdquo; Strange to say, Indra is praised for having saved his people from their enemies, much as Jehovah was praised by the Jewish prophets. Thus we read in one hymn that when Sudās, the pious king of the Tr̥tsus, was pressed hard in his battle with the ten kings, Indra changed the flood into an easy ford, and thus saved Sudās.</p>
<p>In another hymn we read:<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> &ldquo;Thou hast restrained the great river for the sake of Turvîtî Vāyya: the flood moved in obedience to thee, and thou madest the rivers easy to cross.&rdquo; This is not very different from the Psalmist (78:13): &ldquo;He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there are other passages which have reminded some students of the Veda of Joshua&rsquo;s battle,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> when the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. For we read in the Veda also, as Professor Kaegi has pointed out (l. c. p. 63), that &ldquo;Indra lengthened the days into the night,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Sun unharnessed its chariot in the middle of the day.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>In some of the hymns addressed to Indra his original connection with the sky and the thunderstorm seems quite forgotten. He has become a spiritual god, the only king of all worlds and all people,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> who sees and hears everything,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> nay, who inspires men with their best thoughts. No one is equal to him, no one excels him.</p>
<p>The name of Indra is peculiar to India, and must have been formed after the separation of the great Aryan family had taken place, for we find it neither in Greek, nor in Latin, nor in German. There are Vedic gods, as I mentioned before, whose names must have been framed before that separation, and which occur therefore, though greatly modified in character, sometimes in Greek, sometimes in Latin, sometimes in the Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic dialects. Dyaus, for instance, is the same word as Zeus or Jupiter, Ushas is Eos, Naktā is Nyx, Sūrya is Helios, Agni is ignis, Bhaga is Baga in Old Persian, Bogŭ in Old Slavonic, Varuṇa is Uranos, Vāta is Wotan, Vāc is vox, and in the name of the <em>Maruts</em>, or the storm-gods, the germs of the Italic god of war, Mars, have been discovered. Besides these direct coincidences, some indirect relations have been established between Hermes and Sārameya, Dionysos and Dyuniśya, Prometheus and pramantha, Orpheus and r̥bhu, Erinnys and Sāraṇyu, Pān and Pavaṇa.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>But while the name of Indra as the god of the sky, also as the god of the thunderstorm, and the giver of rain, is unknown among the north-western members of the Aryan family, the name of another god who sometimes acts the part of Indra (Indraḥ Parjanyātmā), but is much less prominent in the Veda, I mean Parjanya, must have existed before that of Indra, because two at least of the Aryan languages have carried it, as we shall see, to Germany, and to the very shores of the Baltic.</p>
<p>Sometimes this Parjanya stands in the place of Dyaus, the sky. Thus we read in the Atharva-Veda, XII. 1, 12:<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> &ldquo;The Earth is the mother, and I am the son of the Earth. Parjanya is the father; may he help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another place (XII. 1, 42) the Earth, instead of being the wife of Heaven or Dyaus, is called the wife of Parjanya.</p>
<p>Now who or what is this Parjanya? There have been long controversies about him,<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> as to whether he is the same as Dyaus, Heaven, or the same as Indra, the successor of Dyaus, whether he is the god of the sky, of the cloud, or of the rain.</p>
<p>To me it seems that this very expression, god of the sky, god of the cloud, is so entire an anachronism that we could not even translate it into Vedic Sanskrit without committing a solecism. It is true, no doubt, we must use our modern ways of speaking when we wish to represent the thoughts of the ancient world; but we cannot be too much on our guard against accepting the dictionary representative of an ancient word for its real counterpart. Deva, no doubt, means &ldquo;gods&rdquo; and &ldquo;god,&rdquo; and Parjanya means &ldquo;cloud,&rdquo; but no one could say in Sanskrit parjanyasya devaḥ, &ldquo;the god of the cloud.&rdquo; The god, or the divine, or transcendental element, does not come from without, to be added to the cloud or to the sky or to the earth, but it springs from the cloud and the sky and the earth, and is slowly elaborated into an independent concept. As many words in ancient languages have an undefined meaning, and lend themselves to various purposes according to the various intentions of the speakers, the names of the gods also share in this elastic and plastic character of ancient speech. There are passages where Parjanya means cloud, there are passages where it means rain. There are passages where Parjanya takes the place which elsewhere is filled by Dyaus, the sky, or by Indra, the active god of the atmosphere. This may seem very wrong and very unscientific to the scientific mythologist. But it cannot be helped. It is the nature of ancient thought and ancient language to be unscientific, and we must learn to master it as well as we can, instead of finding fault with it, and complaining that our forefathers did not reason exactly as we do.</p>
<p>There are passages in the Vedic hymns where Parjanya appears as a supreme god. He is called father, like Dyaus, the sky. He is called asura, the living or life-giving god, a name peculiar to the oldest and the greatest gods. One poet says,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> &ldquo;He rules as god over the whole world; all creatures rest in him; he is the life (ātmā) of all that moves and rests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely it is difficult to say more of a supreme god than what is here said of Parjanya. Yet in other hymns he is represented as performing his office, namely that of sending rain upon the earth, under the control of Mitra and Varuṇ, who are then considered as the highest lords, the mightiest rulers of heaven and earth.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>There are other verses, again, where parjanya occurs with hardly any traces of personality, but simply as a name of cloud or rain.</p>
<p>Thus we read:<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> &ldquo;Even by day the Maruts (the storm-gods) produce darkness with the cloud that carries water, when they moisten the earth.&rdquo; Here cloud is parjanya, and it is evidently used as an appellative, and not as a proper name. The same word occurs in the plural also, and we read of many parjanyas or clouds vivifying the earth.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>When Devapi prays for rain in favor of his brother, he says:<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> &ldquo;O lord of my prayer (Br̥haāpati), whether thou be Mitra or Varuṇa or Pūshan, come to my sacrifice! Whether thou be together with the ādityas, the Vasus or the Maruts, let the cloud (parjanya) rain for śantanu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again: &ldquo;Stir up the rainy cloud&rdquo; (parjanya).</p>
<p>In several places it makes no difference whether we translate parjanya by cloud or by rain, for those who pray for rain, pray for the cloud, and whatever may be the benefits of the rain, they may nearly all be called the benefits of the cloud. There is a curious hymn, for instance, addressed to the frogs who, at the beginning of the rains, come forth from the dry ponds, and embrace each other and chatter together, and whom the poet compares to priests singing at a sacrifice, a not very complimentary remark from a poet who is himself supposed to have been a priest. Their voice is said to have been revived by parjanya, which we shall naturally translate &ldquo;by rain,&rdquo; though, no doubt, the poet may have meant, for all we know, either a cloud, or even the god Parjanya himself.</p>
<p>I shall try to translate one of the hymns addressed to Parjanya, when conceived as a god, or at least as so much of a god as it was possible to be at that stage in the intellectual growth of the human race.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Invoke the strong god with these songs! praise Parjanya, worship him with veneration! for he, the roaring bull, scattering drops, gives seed-fruit to plants.</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;He cuts the trees asunder, he kills evil spirits; the whole world trembles before his mighty weapon. Even the guiltless flees before the powerful, when Parjanya thundering strikes down the evil-doers.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;Like a charioteer, striking his horses with a whip, he puts forths his messenger of rain. From afar arise the roarings of the lion, when Parjanya makes the sky full of rain.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;The winds blow, the lightnings<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> fly, plants spring up, the sky pours. Food is produced for the whole world, when Parjanya blesses the earth with his seed.</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;O Parjanya, thou at whose work the earth bows down, thou at whose work hoofed animals are scattered, thou at whose work the plants assume all forms, grant thou to us thy great protection!</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;O, Maruts, give us the rain of heaven, make the streams of the strong horse run down! And come thou hither with thy thunder, pouring out water, for thou (O Parjanya) art the living god, thou art our father.</p>
<p>7. &ldquo;Do thou roar, and thunder, and give fruitfulness! Fly around us with thy chariot full of water! Draw forth thy water-skin, when it has been opened and turned downward, and let the high and the low places become level!</p>
<p>8. &ldquo;Draw up the large bucket, and pour it out; let the streams pour forth freely! Soak heaven and earth with fatness! and let there be a good draught for the cows!</p>
<p>9. &ldquo;O Parjanya, when roaring and thundering thou killest the evil-doers, then everything rejoices, whatever lives on earth.</p>
<p>10. &ldquo;Thou hast sent rain, stop now! Thou hast made the deserts passable, thou hast made plants grow for food, and thou hast obtained praise from men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a Vedic hymn, and a very fair specimen of what these ancient hymns are. There is nothing very grand and poetical about them, and yet, I say, take thousands and thousands of people living in our villages, and depending on rain for their very life, and not many of them will be able to compose such a prayer for rain, even though three thousand years have passed over our heads since Parjanya was first invoked in India. Nor are these verses entirely without poetical conceptions and descriptions. Whoever has watched a real thunderstorm in a hot climate will recognize the truth of those quick sentences: &ldquo;the winds blow, the lightnings fly, plants spring up, the hoofed cattle are scattered.&rdquo; Nor is the idea without a certain drastic reality, that Parjanya draws a bucket of water from his well in heaven, and pours out skin after skin (in which water was then carried) down upon the earth.</p>
<p>There is even a moral sentiment perceptible in this hymn. &ldquo;When the storms roar, and the lightnings flash and the rain pours down, even the guiltless trembles, and evil-doers are struck down.&rdquo; Here we clearly see that the poet did not look upon the storm simply as an outbreak of the violence of nature, but that he had a presentiment of a higher will and power which even the guiltless fears; for who, he seems to say, is entirely free from guilt?</p>
<p>If now we ask again, Who is Parjanya? or What is Parjanya? we can answer that parjanya was meant originally for the cloud, so far as it gives rain; but as soon as the idea of a giver arose, the visible cloud became the outward appearance only, or the body of that giver, and the giver himself was somewhere else, we know not where. In some verses Parjanya seems to step into the place of Dyaus, the sky, and Pr̥thivî, the earth, is his wife. In other places,<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> however, he is the son of Dyaus or the sky, though no thought is given in that early stage to the fact that thus Parjanya might seem to be the husband of his mother. We saw that even the idea of Indra being the father of his own father did not startle the ancient poets beyond an exclamation that it was a very wonderful thing indeed.</p>
<p>Sometimes Parjanya does the work of Indra,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> the Jupiter Pluvius of the Veda; sometimes of Vāyu, the wind, sometimes of Soma, the giver of rain. Yet with all this he is not Dyaus, nor Indra, nor the Maruts, nor Vāyu, nor Soma. He stands by himself, a separate person, a separate god, as we should say—nay, one of the oldest of all the Aryan gods.</p>
<p>His name, parjanya, is derived from a root parj, which, like its parallel forms pars and parsh, must (I think) have had the meaning of sprinkling, irrigating, moistening. An interchange between final j, ś, and sh, may, no doubt, seem unusual, but it is not without parallel in Sanskrit. We have, for instance, the roots pi_ñg_, pingere; pish, to rub; piś, to adorn (as in peśas, ποικἱλος, etc.); m_rig_, to rub, mr̥sh, to rub out, to forget; m_ris_, mulcere.</p>
<p>This very root m_rig_ forms its participle as mr̥sh-ṭa, like yaj, ishṭa, and viś, vishṭa; nay there are roots, such as druh, which optionally take a final lingual or guttural, such as dhruṭ and dhruk.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
<p>We may therefore compare parj in parjanya with such words as pr̥shata, pr̥shatî, speckled, drop of water;<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> also parśu, cloud, p_ris_ni, speckled, cloud, earth; and in Greek πρόξ(ω), περκνός, etc.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>
<p>If derived from parj, to sprinkle, Parjanya would have meant originally &ldquo;he who irrigates or gives rain.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
<p>When the different members of the Aryan family dispersed, they might all of them, Hindus as well as Greeks and Celts, and Teutons and Slaves, have carried that name for cloud with them. But you know that it happened very often that out of the commonwealth of their ancient language, one and the same word was preserved, as the case might be, not by all, but by only six, or five, or four, or three, or two, or even by one only of the seven principal heirs; and yet, as we know that there was no historical contact between them, after they had once parted from each other, long before the beginning of what we call history, the fact that two of the Aryan languages have preserved the same finished word with the same finished meaning, is proof sufficient that it belonged to the most ancient treasure of Aryan thought.</p>
<p>Now there is no trace, at least no very clear trace, of Parjanya, in Greek, or Latin, or Celtic, or even in Teutonic. In Slavonic, too, we look in vain, till we come to that almost forgotten side-branch called the <em>Lettic</em>, comprising the spoken <em>Lituanian</em> and <em>Lettish</em>, and the now extinct <em>Old Prussian</em>. Lituania is no longer an independent state, but it was once, not more than six centuries ago, a Grand Duchy, independent both of Russia and Poland. Its first Grand Duke was Ringold, who ruled from 1235, and his successors made successful conquests against the Russians. In 1368 these grand dukes became kings of Poland, and in 1569 the two countries were united. When Poland was divided between Russia and Prussia, part of Lituania fell to the former, part to the latter. There are still about one million and a half of people who speak Lituanian in Russia and Prussia, while Lettish is spoken by about one million in Curland and Livonia.</p>
<p>The Lituanian language even as it is now spoken by the common people, contains some extremely primitive grammatical forms—in some cases almost identical with Sanskrit. These forms are all the more curious, because they are but few in number, and the rest of the language has suffered much from the wear and tear of centuries.</p>
<p>Now in that remote Lituanian language we find that our old friend Parjanya has taken refuge. There he lives to the present day, while even in India he is almost forgotten, at least in the spoken languages; and there, in Lituania, not many centuries back might be heard among a Christianized or nearly Christianized people, prayers for rain, not very different from that which I translated to you from the Rig-Veda. In Lituanian the god of thunder was called <em>Perkúnas</em>,<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> and the same word is still used in the sense of thunder. In Old Prussian, thunder was <em>percunos</em>, and in Lettish to the present day <em>pérkons</em> is thunder, god of thunder.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p>It was, I believe, Grimm who for the first time identified the Vedic Parjanya with the Old Slavonic Perūn, the Polish Piorun, the Bohemian Peraun. These words had formerly been derived by Dobrovsky and others from the root peru, I strike. Grimm (&ldquo;Teutonic Mythology,&rdquo; Engl. transl., p. 171) showed that the fuller forms Perkunas, Pehrkons, and Perkunos existed in Lituanian, Lettish, Old Prussian, and that even the Mordvinians had adopted the name Porguini as that of their thunder-god.</p>
<p>Simon Grunau, who finished his chronicle in 1521, speaks of three gods, as worshipped by the Old Prussians, Patollo, Patrimpo, and Perkuno, and he states that Perkuno was invoked &ldquo;for storm&rsquo;s sake, that they might have rain and fair weather at the proper time, and thunder and lightning should not injure them.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The following Lituanian prayer has been preserved to us by Lasitzki:<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Check thyself, O Percuna, and do not send misfortune on my field! and I shall give thee this flitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the neighbors of the Lets, the Esthonians, who, though un-Aryan in language, have evidently learned much from their Aryan neighbors, the following prayer was heard,<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> addressed by an old peasant to their god <em>Picker</em> or <em>Picken</em>, the god of thunder and rain, as late as the seventeenth century.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Thunder (woda Picker), we offer to thee an ox that has two horns and four cloven hoofs; we would pray thee for our ploughing and sowing, that our straw be copper-red, our grain golden-yellow. Push elsewhere all the thick black clouds, over great fens, high forests, and wildernesses. But unto us, ploughers and sowers, give a fruitful season and sweet rain. Holy Thunder (pöha Picken), guard our seed-field, that it bear good straw below, good ears above, and good grain within.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, I say again, I do not wish you to admire this primitive poetry, primitive, whether it is repeated in the Esthonian fens in the seventeenth century of our era, or sung in the valley of the Indus in the seventeenth century before our era. Let æsthetic critics say what they like about these uncouth poems. I only ask you, Is it not worth a great many poems, to have established this fact, that the same god Parjanya, the god of clouds and thunder and lightning and rain, who was invoked in India a thousand years before India was discovered by Alexander, should have been remembered and believed in by Lituanian peasants on the frontier between East Prussia and Russia, not more than two hundred years ago, and should have retained its old name Parjanya, which in Sanskrit meant &ldquo;showering,&rdquo; under the form of <em>Perkuna</em>, which in Lituanian is a name and a name only, without any etymological meaning at all; nay, should live on, as some scholars assure us, in an abbreviated form in most Slavonic dialects, namely, in Old Slavonic as <em>Perun</em>, in Polish as <em>Piorun</em>, in Bohemian as <em>Peraun</em>, all meaning thunder or thunderstorm?<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Such facts strike me as if we saw the blood suddenly beginning to flow again through the veins of old mummies; or as if the Egyptian statues of black granite were suddenly to begin to speak again. Touched by the rays of modern science the old words—call them mummies or statues—begin indeed to live again, the old names of gods and heroes begin indeed to speak again.</p>
<p>All that is old becomes new, all that is new becomes old, and that one word, Parjanya, seems, like a charm, to open before our eyes the cave or cottage in which the fathers of the Aryan race, our own fathers—whether we live on the Baltic or on the Indian Ocean—are seen gathered together, taking refuge from the buckets of Parjanya, and saying, &ldquo;Stop now, Parjanya; thou hast sent rain; thou hast made the deserts passable, and hast made the plants to grow; and thou hast obtained praise from man.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>We have still to consider the third class of gods, in addition to the gods of the earth and the sky, namely the gods of the highest heaven, more serene in their character than the active and fighting gods of the air and the clouds, and more remote from the eyes of man, and therefore more mysterious in the exercise of their power than the gods of the earth or the air.</p>
<p>The principal deity is here no doubt the bright sky itself, the old <em>Dyaus</em>, worshipped as we know by the Aryans before they broke up into separate people and languages, and surviving in Greece as Zeus, in Italy as Jupiter, Heaven-father, and among the Teutonic tribes as <em>Tŷr</em> and <em>Tiu</em>. In the Veda we saw him chiefly invoked in connection with the earth, as Dyāvā-pr̥thivî, Heaven and Earth. He is invoked by himself also, but he is a vanishing god, and his place is taken in most of the Vedic poems by the younger and more active god, <em>Indra</em>.</p>
<p>Another representative of the highest heaven, as covering, embracing, and shielding all things, is Varuṇa, a name derived from the root var, to cover, and identical with the Greek <em>Ouranos</em>. This god is one of the most interesting creations of the Hindu mind, because though we can still perceive the physical background from which he rises, the vast, starry, brilliant expanse above, his features, more than those of any of the Vedic gods, have become completely transfigured, and he stands before us as a god who watches over the world, punishes the evil-doer, and even forgives the sins of those who implore his pardon.</p>
<p>I shall read you one of the hymns addressed to him:<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be blessed in thy service, O Varuṇa, for we always think of thee and praise thee, greeting thee day by day, like the fires lighted on the altar, at the approach of the rich dawns.&ldquo;2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Varuṇa, our guide, let us stand in thy keeping, thou who art rich in heroes and praised far and wide! And you, unconquered sons of Aditi, deign to accept us as your friends, O gods!&ldquo;3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;āditya, the ruler, sent forth these rivers; they follow the law of Varuṇa. They tire not, they cease not; like birds they fly quickly everywhere.&ldquo;4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take from me my sin, like a fetter, and we shall increase, O Varuṇa, the spring of thy law. Let not the thread be cut while I weave my song! Let not the form of the workman break before the time!5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take far away from me this terror, O Varuṇa; Thou, O righteous king, have mercy on me! Like as a rope from a calf, remove from me my sin; for away from thee I am not master even of the twinkling of an eye.&ldquo;6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not strike us, Varuṇa, with weapons which at thy will hurt the evil-doer. Let us not go where the light has vanished! Scatter our enemies, that we may live.&ldquo;7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did formerly, O Varuṇa, and do now, and shall in future also, sing praises to thee, O mighty one! For on thee, unconquerable hero, rest all statutes, immovable, as if established on a rock.&ldquo;8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move far away from me all self-committed guilt, and may I not, O king, suffer for what others have committed! Many dawns have not yet dawned; grant us to live in them, O Varuṇa.&ldquo;9.</p>
<p>You may have observed that in several verses of this hymn Varuṇa was called āditya, or son of Aditi. Now Aditi means <em>infinitude</em>, from <em>dita</em>, bound, and <em>a</em>, not, that is, not bound, not limited, absolute, infinite. Aditi itself is now and then invoked in the Veda, as the Beyond, as what is beyond the earth and the sky, and the sun and the dawn—a most surprising conception in that early period of religious thought. More frequently, however, than Aditi, we meet with the ādityas, literally the sons of Aditi, or the gods beyond the visible earth and sky—in one sense, the infinite gods. One of them is Varuṇa, others Mitra and Aryaman (Bhaga, Daksha, A_ms_a), most of them abstract names, though pointing to heaven and the solar light of heaven as their first, though almost forgotten source.</p>
<p>When Mitra and Varuṇa are invoked together, we can still perceive dimly that they were meant originally for day and night, light and darkness. But in their more personal and so to say dramatic aspect, day and night appear in the Vedic mythology as the two Aśvins, the two horsemen.</p>
<p>Aditi, too, the infinite, still shows a few traces of her being originally connected with the boundless Dawn; but again, in her more personal and dramatic character, the Dawn is praised by the Vedic poets as Ushas, the Greek Eos, the beautiful maid of the morning, loved by the Aśvins, loved by the sun, but vanishing before him at the very moment when he tries to embrace her with his golden rays. The sun himself, whom we saw reflected several times before in some of the divine personifications of the air and the sky and even of the earth, appears once more in his full personality, as the sun of the sky, under the names of Sūrya (Helios), Savitr̥, Pūshan, and Vishṇu, and many more.</p>
<p>You see from all this how great a mistake it would be to attempt to reduce the whole of Aryan mythology to solar concepts, and to solar concepts only. We have seen how largely the earth, the air, and the sky have each contributed their share to the earliest religious and mythological treasury of the Vedic Aryans. Nevertheless, the Sun occupied in that ancient collection of Aryan thought, which we call Mythology, the same central and commanding position which, under different names, it still holds in our own thoughts.</p>
<p>What we call the Morning, the ancient Aryans called the Sun or the Dawn; &ldquo;and there is no solemnity so deep to a rightly-thinking creature as that of the Dawn.&rdquo; (These are not my words, but the words of one of our greatest poets, one of the truest worshippers of Nature—John Ruskin.) What we call Noon, and Evening, and Night, what we call Spring and Winter, what we call Year, and Time, and Life, and Eternity—all this the ancient Aryans called <em>Sun</em>. And yet wise people wonder and say, How curious that the ancient Aryans should have had so many solar myths. Why, every time we say &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; we commit a solar myth. Every poet who sings about &ldquo;the May driving the Winter from the field again&rdquo; commits a solar myth. Every &ldquo;Christmas number&rdquo; of our newspapers—ringing out the old year and ringing in the new—is brimful of solar myths. Be not afraid of solar myths, but whenever in ancient mythology you meet with a name that, according to the strictest phonetic rules (for this is a <em>sine qua non</em>), can be traced back to a word meaning sun, or dawn, or morning, or night, or spring or winter, accept it for what it was meant to be, and do not be greatly surprised, if a story told of a solar eponymos was originally a solar myth.</p>
<p>No one has more strongly protested against the extravagances of comparative mythologists in changing everything into solar legends, than I have; but if I read some of the arguments brought forward against this new science, I confess they remind me of nothing so much as of the arguments brought forward, centuries ago, against the existence of Antipodes! People then appealed to what is called Common Sense, which ought to teach everybody that Antipodes could not possibly exist, because they would tumble off. The best answer that astronomers could give, was, &ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo; And I can give no better answer to those learned skeptics who try to ridicule the Science of Comparative Mythology—&ldquo;Go and see!&rdquo; that is, go and read the Veda, and before you have finished the first Manḍala, I can promise you, you will no longer shake your wise heads at solar myths, whether in India, or in Greece, or in Italy, or even in England, where we see so little of the sun, and talk all the more about the weather—that is, about a solar myth.</p>
<p>We have thus seen from the hymns and prayers preserved to us in the Rig-Veda, how a large number of so-called Devas, bright and sunny beings, or gods, were called into existence, how the whole world was peopled with them, and every act of nature, whether on the earth or in the air or in the highest heaven, ascribed to their agency. When we say <em>it</em> thunders, they said Indra thunders; when we say, <em>it</em> rains, they said Parjanya pours out his buckets; when we say, <em>it</em> dawns, they said the beautiful Ushas appears like a dancer, displaying her splendor; when we say; <em>it</em> grows dark, they said Sūrya unharnesses his steeds. The whole of nature was alive to the poets of the Veda, the presence of the gods was felt everywhere, and in that sentiment of the presence of the gods there was a germ of religious morality, sufficiently strong, it would seem, to restrain people from committing as it were before the eyes of their gods what they were ashamed to commit before the eyes of men. When speaking of Varuṇa, the old god of the sky, one poet says:<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Varuṇa, the great lord of these worlds, sees as if he were near. If a man stands or walks or hides, if he goes to lie down or to get up, what two people sitting together whisper to each other, King Varuṇa knows it, he is there as the third.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> This earth too belongs to Varuṇa, the King, and this wide sky with its ends far apart. The two seas (the sky and the ocean) are Varuṇa&rsquo;s loins; he is also contained in this small drop of water. He who should flee far beyond the sky, even he would not be rid of Varuṇa, the King.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> His spies proceed from heaven toward this world; with thousand eyes they overlook this earth. King Varuṇa sees all this, what is between heaven and earth, and what is beyond. He has counted the twinklings of the eyes of men. As a player throws down the dice, he settles all things (irrevocably). May all thy fatal snares which stand spread out seven by seven and threefold, catch the man who tells a lie, may they pass by him who speaks the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see this is as beautiful, and in some respects as true, as anything in the Psalms. And yet we know that there never was such a Deva, or god, or such a thing as Varuṇa. We know it is a mere name, meaning originally &ldquo;covering or all-embracing,&rdquo; which was applied to the visible starry sky, and afterward, by a process perfectly intelligible, developed into the name of a Being, endowed with human and superhuman qualities.</p>
<p>And what applies to Varuṇa applies to all the other gods of the Veda and the Vedic religion, whether three in number, or thirty-three, or, as one poet said, &ldquo;three thousand three hundred and thirty-nine gods.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> They are all but names, quite as much as Jupiter and Apollo and Minerva; in fact, quite as much as all the gods of every religion who are called by such appellative titles.</p>
<p>Possibly, if any one had said this during the Vedic age in India, or even during the Periklean age in Greece, he would have been called, like Sokrates, a blasphemer or an atheist. And yet nothing can be clearer or truer, and we shall see that some of the poets of the Veda too, and, still more, the later Vedāntic philosopher, had a clear insight that it was so.</p>
<p>Only let us be careful in the use of that phrase &ldquo;it is a mere name.&rdquo; No name is a mere name. Every name was originally meant for something; only it often failed to express what it was meant to express, and then became a weak or an empty name, or what we then call &ldquo;a mere name.&rdquo; So it was with these names of the Vedic gods. They were all meant to express the <em>Beyond</em>, the Invisible behind the Visible, the Infinite within the Finite, the Supernatural above the Natural, the Divine, omnipresent, and omnipotent. They failed in expressing what, by its very nature, must always remain inexpressible. But that Inexpressible itself remained, and in spite of all these failures, it never succumbed, or vanished from the mind of the ancient thinkers and poets, but always called for new and better names, nay calls for them even now, and will call for them to the very end of man&rsquo;s existence upon earth.</p>

<p>Grimm suggests in his &ldquo;Teutonic Mythology&rdquo; that Parjanya should be identified with the Gothic fairguni, or mountain. He imagines that from being regarded as the abode of the god it had finally been called by his name. Ferg_unn_a and V_ir_guṇià, two names of mountains in Germany, are relics of the name. The name of the god, if preserved in the Gothic, would have been Fairguneis; and indeed in the Old Norse language Fiörgynn is the father of Frigg, the wife of Odin, and Fiörgynnior, the Earth-goddess, is mother of Thor. Professor Zimmer takes the same view. Grimm thinks that the Greeks and Romans, by changing <em>f</em> into ḥ, represented Fergunni by Hercynia, and, in fine, he traces the words _ber_g and _bur_g back to Parganya.—A.
