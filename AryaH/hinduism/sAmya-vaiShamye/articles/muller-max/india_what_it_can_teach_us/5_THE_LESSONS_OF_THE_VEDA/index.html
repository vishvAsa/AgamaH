  <meta property="og:description" content="Although there is hardly any department of learning which has not received new light and new life from the ancient literature of India, yet nowhere is the light that comes to us from India so important, so novel, and so rich as in the study of religion and mythology. It is to this subject therefore that I mean to devote the remaining lectures of this course. I do so, partly because I feel myself most at home in that ancient world of Vedic literature in which the germs of Aryan religion have to be studied, partly because I believe that for a proper understanding of the deepest convictions, or, if you like, the strongest prejudices of the modern Hindus, nothing is so useful as a knowledge of the Veda. It is perfectly true that nothing would give a falser impression of the actual Brahmanical religion than the ancient Vedic literature, supposing we were to imagine that three thousand years could have passed over India without producing any change. Such a mistake would be nearly as absurd as to deny any difference between the Vedic Sanskrit and the spoken Bengali. But no one will gain a scholarlike knowledge or a true insight into the secret springs of Bengali who is ignorant of the grammar of Sanskrit; and no one will ever understand the present religious, philosophical, legal, and social opinions of the Hindus who is unable to trace them back to their true sources in the Veda.">

  <p>Although there is hardly any department of learning which has not received new light and new life from the ancient literature of India, yet nowhere is the light that comes to us from India so important, so novel, and so rich as in the study of religion and mythology. It is to this subject therefore that I mean to devote the remaining lectures of this course. I do so, partly because I feel myself most at home in that ancient world of Vedic literature in which the germs of Aryan religion have to be studied, partly because I believe that for a proper understanding of the deepest convictions, or, if you like, the strongest prejudices of the modern Hindus, nothing is so useful as a knowledge of the Veda. It is perfectly true that nothing would give a falser impression of the actual Brahmanical religion than the ancient Vedic literature, supposing we were to imagine that three thousand years could have passed over India without producing any change. Such a mistake would be nearly as absurd as to deny any difference between the Vedic Sanskrit and the spoken Bengali. But no one will gain a scholarlike knowledge or a true insight into the secret springs of Bengali who is ignorant of the grammar of Sanskrit; and no one will ever understand the present religious, philosophical, legal, and social opinions of the Hindus who is unable to trace them back to their true sources in the Veda.</p>
<p>I still remember how, many years ago, when I began to publish for the first time the text and the commentary of the Rig-Veda, it was argued by a certain, perhaps not quite disinterested party, that the Veda was perfectly useless; that no man in India, however learned, could read it, and that it was of no use either for missionaries or for any one else who wished to study and to influence the native mind. It was said that we ought to study the later Sanskrit, the Laws of Manu, the epic poems, and, more particularly, the Purāṇas. The Veda might do very well for German students, but not for Englishmen.</p>
<p>There was no excuse for such ignorant assertions even thirty years ago, for in these very books, in the Laws of Manu, in the Mahābhārata, and in the Purāṇas, the Veda is everywhere proclaimed as the highest authority in all matters of religion.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ldquo;A Brahman,&rdquo; says Manu, &ldquo;unlearned in holy writ, is extinguished in an instant like dry grass on fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;A twice-born man (that is, a Brāhmaṇa, a Kshatriya, and a Vaiśya) not having studied the Veda, soon falls, even when living, to the condition of a śūdra, and his descendants after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How far this license of ignorant assertion may be carried is shown by the same authorities who denied the importance of the Veda for a historical study of Indian thought, boldly charging those wily priests, the Brahmans, with having withheld their sacred literature from any but their own caste. Now, so far from withholding it, the Brahmans have always been striving, and often striving in vain, to make the study of their sacred literature obligatory on all castes except the śūdras, and the passages just quoted from Manu show what penalties were threatened if children of the second and third castes, the Kshatriyas and Vaiśyas, were not instructed in the sacred literature of the Brahmans.</p>
<p>At present the Brahmans themselves have spoken, and the reception they have accorded to my edition of the Rig-Veda<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and its native commentary, the zeal with which they have themselves taken up the study of Vedic literature, and the earnestness with which different sects are still discussing the proper use that should be made of their ancient religious writings, show abundantly that a Sanskrit scholar ignorant of, or, I should rather say, determined to ignore the Veda, would be not much better than a Hebrew scholar ignorant of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to give you some characteristic specimens of the religion and poetry of the Rig-Veda. They can only be few, and as there is nothing like system or unity of plan in that collection of 1017 hymns, which we call the Saṁhitā of the Rig-Veda, I cannot promise that they will give you a complete panoramic view of that intellectual world in which our Vedic ancestors passed their life on earth.</p>
<p>I could not even answer the question, if you were to ask it whether the religion of the Veda was <em>polytheistic</em> or <em>monotheistic</em>. Monotheistic, in the usual sense of that word, it is decidedly not, though there are hymns that assert the unity of the Divine as fearlessly as any passage of the Old Testament, or the New Testament, or the Koran. Thus one poet says (Rig-Veda I. 164, 46): &ldquo;That which is <em>one</em>, sages name it in various ways—they call it Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another poet says: &ldquo;The wise poets represent by their words Him who is one with beautiful wings, in many ways.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>And again we hear of a being called Hiraṇyagarbha, the golden germ (whatever the original of that name may have been), of whom the poet says:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> &ldquo;In the beginning there arose Hiraṇyagarbha; he was the one born lord of all this. He established the earth and this sky. Who is the god to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?&rdquo; That Hiraṇyagarbha, the poet says, &ldquo;is alone God above all gods&rdquo; (yaḥ deveshu adhi devaḥ ekaḥ āsît)—an assertion of the unity of the Divine which could hardly be exceeded in strength by any passage from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>But by the side of such passages, which are few in number, there are thousands in which ever so many divine beings are praised and prayed to. Even their number is sometimes given as &ldquo;thrice eleven&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> or thirty-three, and one poet assigns eleven gods to the sky, eleven to the earth, and eleven to the waters,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> the waters here intended being those of the atmosphere and the clouds. These thirty-three gods have even wives apportioned to them,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> though few of these only have as yet attained to the honor of a name.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>These thirty-three gods, however, by no means include all the Vedic gods, for such important deities as Agni, the fire, Soma, the rain, the Maruts or Storm-gods, the Aśvins, the gods of Morning and Evening, the Waters, the Dawn, the Sun are mentioned separately; and there are not wanting passages in which the poet is carried away into exaggerations, till he proclaims the number of his gods to be, not only thirty-three, but three thousand three hundred and thirty-nine.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>If therefore there must be a name for the religion of the Rig-Veda, polytheism would seem at first sight the most appropriate. Polytheism, however, has assumed with us a meaning which renders it totally inapplicable to the Vedic religion.</p>
<p>Our ideas of polytheism being chiefly derived from Greece and Rome, we understand by it a certain more or less organized system of gods, different in power and rank, and all subordinate to a supreme God, a Zeus or Jupiter. The Vedic polytheism differs from the Greek and Roman polytheism, and, I may add, likewise from the polytheism of the Ural-Altaic, the Polynesian, the American, and most of the African races, in the same manner as a confederacy of village communities differs from a monarchy. There are traces of an earlier stage of village-community life to be discovered in the later republican and monarchical constitutions, and in the same manner nothing can be clearer, particularly in Greece, than that the monarchy of Zeus was preceded by what may be called the septarchy of several of the great gods of Greece. The same remark applies to the mythology of the Teutonic nations also.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> In the Veda, however, the gods worshipped as supreme by each sept stand still side by side. No one is first always, no one is last always. Even gods of a decidedly inferior and limited character assume occasionally in the eyes of a devoted poet a supreme place above all other gods.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> It was necessary, therefore, for the purpose of accurate reasoning, to have a name, different from <em>polytheism</em>, to signify this worship of single gods, each occupying for a time a supreme position, and I proposed for it the name of <em>Kathenotheism</em>, that is, a worship of one god after another, or of <em>Henotheism</em>, the worship of single gods. This shorter name of <em>Henotheism</em> has found more general acceptance, as conveying more definitely the opposition between <em>Monotheism</em>, the worship of one only God, and <em>Henotheism</em>, the worship of single gods; and, if but properly defined, it will answer its purpose very well. However, in researches of this kind we cannot be too much on our guard against technical terms. They are inevitable, I know; but they are almost always misleading. There is, for instance, a hymn addressed to the <em>Indus</em> and the rivers that fall into it, of which I hope to read you a translation, because it determines very accurately the geographical scene on which the poets of the Veda passed their life. Now native scholars call these rivers devatās or deities, and European translators too speak of them as gods and goddesses. But in the language used by the poet with regard to the Indus and the other rivers, there is nothing to justify us in saying that he considered these rivers as <em>gods</em> and <em>goddesses</em>, unless we mean by <em>gods</em> and <em>goddesses</em> something very different from what the Greeks called River-gods and River-goddesses, Nymphs, Najades, or even Muses.</p>
<p>And what applies to these rivers applies more or less to all the objects of Vedic worship. They all are still oscillating between what is seen by the senses, what is created by fancy, and what is postulated by the understanding; they are things, persons, causes, according to the varying disposition of the poets; and if we call them gods or goddesses, we must remember the remark of an ancient native theologian, who reminds us that by devatā or deity he means no more than the object celebrated in a hymn, while r̥shi or seer means no more than the subject or the author of a hymn.</p>
<p>It is difficult to treat of the so-called gods celebrated in the Veda according to any system, for the simple reason that the concepts of these gods and the hymns addressed to them sprang up spontaneously and without any pre-established plan. It is best perhaps for our purpose to follow an ancient Brahmanical writer, who is supposed to have lived about 400 b.c. He tells us of students of the Veda, before his time, who admitted three deities only, viz., Agni or fire, whose place is on the earth; Vāyu or Indra, the wind and the god of the thunderstorm, whose place is in the air; and Sūrya, the sun, whose place is in the sky. These deities, they maintained, received severally many appellations, in consequence of their greatness, or of the diversity of their functions, just as a priest, according to the functions which he performs at various sacrifices, receives various names.</p>
<p>This is <em>one</em> view of the Vedic gods, and, though too narrow, it cannot be denied that there is some truth in it. A very useful division of the Vedic gods might be made, and has been made by Yāska, into <em>terrestrial</em>, <em>aërial</em>, and <em>celestial</em>, and if the old Hindu theologians meant no more than that all the manifestations of divine power in nature might be traced back to three centres of force, one in the sky, one in the air, and one on the earth, he deserves great credit for his sagacity.</p>
<p>But he himself perceived evidently that this generalization was not quite applicable to all the gods, and he goes on to say: &ldquo;Or, it may be, these gods are all distinct beings, for the praises addressed to them are distinct, and their appellations also.&rdquo; This is quite right. It is the very object of most of these divine names to impart distinct individuality to the manifestations of the powers of nature; and though the philosopher or the inspired poet might perceive that these numerous names were but names, while that which was named was <em>one</em> and <em>one</em> only, this was certainly not the idea of most of the Vedic r̥shis themselves, still less of the people who listened to their songs at fairs and festivals. It is the peculiar character of that phase of religious thought which we have to study in the Veda, that in it the Divine is conceived and represented as manifold, and that many functions are shared in common by various gods, no attempt having yet been made at organizing the whole body of the gods, sharply separating one from the other, and subordinating all of them to several or, in the end, to one supreme head.</p>
<p>Availing ourselves of the division of the Vedic gods into terrestrial, aërial, and celestial, as proposed by some of the earliest Indian theologians, we should have to begin with the gods connected with the earth.</p>
<p>Before we examine them, however, we have first to consider one of the earliest objects of worship and adoration, namely <em>Earth and Heaven</em>, or <em>Heaven and Earth</em>, conceived as a divine couple. Not only in India, but among many other nations, both savage, half-savage, or civilized, we meet with Heaven and Earth as one of the earliest objects, pondered on, transfigured, and animated by the early poets, and more or less clearly conceived by early philosophers. It is surprising that it should be so, for the conception of the Earth as an independent being, and of Heaven as an independent being, and then of both together as a divine couple embracing the whole universe, requires a considerable effort of abstraction, far more than the concepts of other divine powers, such as the Fire, the Rain, the Lightning, or the Sun.</p>
<p>Still so it is, and as it may help us to understand the ideas about Heaven and Earth, as we find them in the Veda, and show us at the same time the strong contrast between the mythology of the Aryans and that of real savages (a contrast of great importance, though I admit very difficult to explain), I shall read you first some extracts from a book, published by a friend of mine, the Rev. William Wyatt Gill, for many years an active and most successful missionary in Mangaia, one of those Polynesian islands that form a girdle round one quarter of our globe,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> and all share in the same language, the same religion, the same mythology, and the same customs. The book is called &ldquo;Myths and Songs from the South Pacific,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and it is full of interest to the student of mythology and religion.</p>
<p>The story, as told him by the natives of Mangaia, runs as follows:<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;The sky is built of solid blue stone. At one time it almost touched the earth; resting upon the stout broad leaves of the teve (which attains the height of about six feet) and the delicate indigenous arrow-root (whose slender stem rarely exceeds three feet)&hellip;. In this narrow space between earth and sky the inhabitants of this world were pent up. Ru, whose usual residence was in Avaiki, or the shades, had come up for a time to this world of ours. Pitying the wretched confined residence of the inhabitants, he employed himself in endeavoring to raise the sky a little. For this purpose he cut a number of strong stakes of different kinds of trees, and firmly planted them in the ground at Rangimotia, the centre of the island, and with him the centre of the world. This was a considerable improvement, as mortals were thereby enabled to stand erect and to walk about without inconvenience. Hence Ru was named &lsquo;The sky-supporter.&rsquo; Wherefore Teka sings (1794):</p>
<p>&lsquo;Force up the sky, O Ru,<br>
And let the space be clear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day when the old man was surveying his work, his graceless son Māui contemptuously asked him what he was doing there. Ru replied: &lsquo;Who told youngsters to talk? Take care of yourself, or I will hurl you out of existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do it, then,&rsquo; shouted Māui.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ru was as good as his word, and forthwith seized Māui, who was small of stature, and threw him to a great height. In falling Māui assumed the form of a bird, and lightly touched the ground, perfectly unharmed. Māui, now thirsting for revenge, in a moment resumed his natural form, but exaggerated to gigantic proportions, and ran to his father, saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ru, who supportest the many heavens,<br>
The third, even to the highest, ascend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Inserting his head between the old man&rsquo;s legs, he exerted all his prodigious strength, and hurled poor Ru, sky and all, to a tremendous height—so high, indeed, that the blue sky could never get back again. Unluckily, however, for the sky-supporting Ru, his head and shoulders got entangled among the stars. He struggled hard, but fruitlessly, to extricate himself. Māui walked off well pleased with having raised the sky to its present height, but left half his father&rsquo;s body and both his legs ingloriously suspended between heaven and earth. Thus perished Ru. His body rotted away, and his bones came tumbling down from time to time, and were shivered on the earth into countless fragments. These shivered bones of Ru are scattered over every hill and valley of Mangaia, to the very edge of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the natives call &ldquo;the bones of Ru&rdquo; (te ivio Ru) are pieces of pumice-stone.</p>
<p>Now let us consider, first of all, whether this story, which with slight variations is told all over the Polynesian islands,<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> is pure nonsense, or whether there was originally some sense in it. My conviction is that nonsense is everywhere the child of sense, only that unfortunately many children, like that youngster Māui, consider themselves much wiser than their fathers, and occasionally succeed in hurling them out of existence.</p>
<p>It is a peculiarity of many of the ancient myths that they represent events which happen every day, or every year, as having happened once upon a time.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> The daily battle between day and night, the yearly battle between winter and spring, are represented almost like historical events, and some of the episodes and touches belonging originally to these constant battles of nature, have certainly been transferred into and mixed up with battles that took place at a certain time, such as, for instance, the siege of Troy. When historical recollections failed, legendary accounts of the ancient battles between Night and Morning, Winter and Spring, were always at hand; and, as in modern times we constantly hear &ldquo;good stories,&rdquo; which we have known from our childhood, told again and again of any man whom they seem to fit, in the same manner, in ancient times, any act of prowess, or daring, or mischief, originally told of the sun, &ldquo;the orient Conqueror of gloomy Night,&rdquo; was readily transferred to and believed of any local hero who might seem to be a second Jupiter, or Mars, or Hercules.</p>
<p>I have little doubt therefore that as the accounts of a deluge, for instance, which we find almost everywhere, are originally recollections of the annual torrents of rain or snow that covered the little worlds within the ken of the ancient village-bards,<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> this tearing asunder of heaven and earth too was originally no more than a description of what might be seen every morning. During a dark night the sky seemed to cover the earth; the two seemed to be one, and could not be distinguished one from the other.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> Then came the Dawn, which with its bright rays lifted the covering of the dark night to a certain point, till at last Māui appeared, small in stature, a mere child, that is, the sun of the morning—thrown up suddenly, as it were, when his first rays shot through the sky from beneath the horizon, then falling back to the earth, like a bird, and rising in gigantic form on the morning sky. The dawn now was hurled away, and the sky was seen lifted high above the earth; and Māui, the sun, marched on well pleased with having raised the sky to its present height.</p>
<p>Why pumice-stone should be called the bones of Ru, we cannot tell, without knowing a great deal more of the language of Mangaia than we do at present. It is most likely an independent saying, and was afterward united with the story of Ru and Māui.</p>
<p>Now I must quote at least a few extracts from a Maori legend as written down by Judge Manning:<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Genesis of the New Zealanders:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Heavens which are above us, and the Earth which lies beneath us, are the progenitors of men, and the origin of all things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly the Heaven lay upon the Earth, and all was darkness&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the children of Heaven and Earth sought to discover the difference between light and darkness, between day and night&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the sons of Rangi (Heaven) and of Papa (Earth) consulted together, and said, &lsquo;Let us seek means whereby to destroy Heaven and Earth, or to separate them from each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said Tumatauenga (the God of War), &lsquo;Let us destroy them both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then said Tane-Mahuta (the Forest God), &lsquo;Not so; let them be separated. Let one of them go upward and become a stranger to us; let the other remain below and be a parent for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then four of the gods tried to separate Heaven and Earth, but did not succeed, while the fifth, Tane, succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Heaven and Earth had been separated, great storms arose, or, as the poet expresses it, one of their sons, Tawhiri-Matea, the god of the winds, tried to revenge the outrage committed on his parents by his brothers. Then follow dismal dusky days, and dripping chilly skies, and arid scorching blasts. All the gods fight, till at last Tu only remains, the god of war, who had devoured all his brothers, except the Storm. More fights follow, in which the greater part of the earth was overwhelmed by the waters, and but a small portion remained dry. After that, light continued to increase, and as the light increased, so also the people who had been hidden between Heaven and Earth increased&hellip;. And so generation was added to generation down to the time of Māui-Potiki, he who brought death into the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now in these latter days Heaven remains far removed from his wife, the Earth; but the love of the wife rises upward in sighs toward her husband. These are the mists which fly upward from the mountain-tops; and the tears of Heaven fall downward on his wife; behold the dew-drops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far the Maori Genesis.</p>
<p>Let us now return to the Veda, and compare these crude and somewhat grotesque legends with the language of the ancient Aryan poets. In the hymns of the Rig-Veda the separating and keeping apart of Heaven and Earth is several times alluded to, and here too it is represented as the work of the most valiant gods. In I. 67, 3 it is Agni, fire, who holds the earth and supports the heaven; in X. 89, 4 it is Indra who keeps them apart; in IX. 101, 15 Soma is celebrated for the same deed, and in III. 31, 12 other gods too share the same honor.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa we read:<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> &ldquo;These two worlds (Heaven and Earth) were once joined together. They went asunder. Then it did not rain, nor did the sun shine. And the five tribes did not agree with one another. The gods then brought the two (Heaven and Earth) together, and when they came together they formed a wedding of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have in a shorter form the same fundamental ideas: first, that formerly Heaven and Earth were together; that afterward they were separated; that when they were thus separated there was war throughout nature, and neither rain nor sunshine; that, lastly, Heaven and Earth were conciliated, and that then a great wedding took place.</p>
<p>Now I need hardly remind those who are acquainted with Greek and Roman literature, how familiar these and similar conceptions about a marriage between Heaven and earth were in Greece and Italy. They seem to possess there a more special reference to the annual reconciliation between Heaven and Earth, which takes place in spring, and to their former estrangement during winter. But the first cosmological separation of the two always points to the want of light and the impossibility of distinction during the night, and the gradual lifting up of the blue sky through the rising of the sun.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Homeric hymns<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> the Earth is addressed as</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother of gods, the wife of the starry Heaven;&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
<p>and the Heaven or Æther is often called the father. Their marriage too is described, as, for instance, by Euripides, when he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the mighty Earth, Jove&rsquo;s Æther:<br>
He (the Æther) is the creator of men and gods;<br>
The earth receiving the moist drops of rain,<br>
Bears mortals,<br>
Bears food, and the tribes of animals.<br>
Hence she is not unjustly regarded<br>
As the mother of all.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>
<p>And what is more curious still is that we have evidence that Euripides received this doctrine from his teacher, the philosopher Anaxagoras. For Dionysius of Halicarnassus<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> tells us that Euripides frequented the lectures of Anaxagoras. Now, it was the theory of that philosopher that originally all things were in all things, but that afterward they became separated. Euripides later in life associated with Sokrates, and became doubtful regarding that theory. He accordingly propounds the ancient doctrine by the mouth of another, namely Melanippê, who says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This saying (myth) is not mine, but came from my mother, that formerly Heaven and Earth were one shape; but when they were separated from each other, they gave birth and brought all things into the light, trees, birds, beasts, and the fishes whom the sea feeds, and the race of mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we have met with the same idea of the original union, of a separation, and of a subsequent reunion of Heaven and Earth in Greece, in India, and in the Polynesian islands.</p>
<p>Let us now see how the poets of the Veda address these two beings, Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>They are mostly addressed in the dual, as two beings forming but one concept. We meet, however, with verses which are addressed to the Earth by herself, and which speak of her as &ldquo;kind, without thorns, and pleasant to dwell on,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> while there are clear traces in some of the hymns that at one time Dyaus, the sky, was the supreme deity.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> When invoked together they are called Dyāvā-pr̥thivyau, from dyu, the sky, and pr̥thivî, the broad earth.</p>
<p>If we examine their epithets, we find that many of them reflect simply the physical aspects of Heaven and Earth. Thus they are called uru, wide; uruvyacas, widely expanded, dūre-ante, with limits far apart, gabhîra, deep; ghr̥tavat, giving fat; madhudugha, yielding honey or dew; payasvat, full of milk; bhūri-retas, rich in seed.</p>
<p>Another class of epithets represents them already as endowed with certain human and superhuman qualities, such as asa_sk_at, never tiring, ajara, not decaying, which brings us very near to immortal; adruh, not injuring, or not deceiving, pracetas, provident, and then pitā-māta, father and mother, devaputra, having the gods for their sons, r̥ta-vr̥dh and r̥tavat, protectors of the r̥ta, of what is right, guardians of eternal laws.</p>
<p>Here you see what is so interesting in the Veda, the gradual advance from the material to the spiritual, from the sensuous to the supersensuous, from the human to the superhuman and the divine. Heaven and Earth were seen, and, according to our notions, they might simply be classed as visible and finite beings. But the ancient poets were more honest to themselves. They could see Heaven and Earth, but they never saw them in their entirety. They felt that there was something beyond the purely finite aspect of these beings, and therefore they thought of them, not as they would think of a stone, or a tree, or a dog, but as something not-finite, not altogether visible or knowable, yet as something important to themselves, powerful, strong to bless, but also strong to hurt. Whatever was between Heaven and Earth seemed to be theirs, their property, their realm, their dominion. They held and embraced all; they seemed to have produced all. The Devas or bright beings, the sun, the dawn, the fire, the wind, the rain, were all theirs, and were called therefore the offspring of Heaven and Earth. Thus Heaven and Earth became the Universal Father and Mother.</p>
<p>Then we ask at once: &ldquo;Were then these Heaven and Earth gods?&rdquo; But gods in what sense? In our sense of God? Why, in our sense, God is altogether incapable of a plural. Then in the Greek sense of the word? No, certainly not; for what the Greeks called gods was the result of an intellectual growth totally independent of the Veda or of India. We must never forget that what we call gods in ancient mythologies are not substantial, living, individual beings, of whom we can predicate this or that. Deva, which we translate by god, is nothing but an adjective, expressive of a quality shared by heaven and earth, by the sun and the stars and the dawn and the sea, namely <em>brightness</em>; and the idea of god, at that early time, contains neither more nor less than what is shared in common by all these bright beings. That is to say, the idea of god is not an idea ready-made, which could be applied in its abstract purity to heaven and earth and other such like beings; but it is an idea, growing out of the concepts of heaven and earth and of the other bright beings, slowly separating itself from them, but never containing more than what was contained, though confusedly, in the objects to which it was successively applied.</p>
<p>Nor must it be supposed that heaven and earth, having once been raised to the rank of undecaying or immortal beings, of divine parents, of guardians of the laws, were thus permanently settled in the religious consciousness of the people. Far from it. When the ideas of other gods, and of more active and more distinctly personal gods had been elaborated, the Vedic r̥shis asked without hesitation: Who then has made heaven and earth? not exactly Heaven and Earth, as conceived before, but heaven and earth as seen every day, as a part of what began to be called Nature or the Universe.</p>
<p>Thus one poet says:<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;He was indeed among the gods the cleverest workman who produced the two brilliant ones (heaven and earth), that gladden all things; he who measured out the two bright ones (heaven and earth) by his wisdom, and established them on everlasting supports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again:<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> &ldquo;He was a good workman who produced heaven and earth; the wise, who by his might brought together these two (heaven and earth), the wide, the deep, the well-fashioned in the bottomless space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soon this great work of making heaven and earth was ascribed, like other mighty works, to the mightiest of their gods, to Indra. At first we read that Indra, originally only a kind of <em>Jupiter pluvius</em>, or god of rain, stretched out heaven and earth, like a hide;<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> that he held them in his hand,<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> that he upholds heaven and earth,<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> and that he grants heaven and earth to his worshippers.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> But very soon Indra is praised for having made Heaven and Earth;<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> and then, when the poet remembers that Heaven and Earth had been praised elsewhere as the parents of the gods, and more especially as the parents of Indra, he does not hesitate for a moment, but says:<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> &ldquo;What poets living before us have reached the end of all thy greatness? for thou hast indeed begotten thy father and thy mother together<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> from thy own body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is a strong measure, and a god who once could do that, was no doubt capable of anything afterward. The same idea, namely that Indra is greater than heaven and earth, is expressed in a less outrageous way by another poet, who says<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> that Indra is greater than heaven and earth, and that both together are only a half of Indra. Or again:<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> &ldquo;The divine Dyaus bowed before Indra, before Indra the great Earth bowed with her wide spaces.&rdquo; &ldquo;At the birth of thy splendor Dyaus trembled, the Earth trembled for fear of thy anger.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, from one point of view, Heaven and Earth were the greatest gods, they were the parents of everything, and therefore of the gods also, such as Indra and others.</p>
<p>But, from another point of view, every god that was considered as supreme at one time or other, must necessarily have made heaven and earth, must at all events be greater than heaven and earth, and thus the child became greater than the father, ay, became the father of his father. Indra was not the only god that created heaven and earth. In one hymn<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> that creation is ascribed to Soma and Pūshan, by no means very prominent characters; in another<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> to Hiraṇyagarbha (the golden germ); in another again to a god who is simply called Dhatr̥, the Creator,<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> or Viśvakarman,<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> the maker of all things. Other gods, such as Mitra and Savitr̥, names of the sun, are praised for upholding Heaven and Earth, and the same task is sometimes performed by the old god Varuṇa<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> also.</p>
<p>What I wish you to observe in all this is the perfect freedom with which these so-called gods or Devas are handled, and particularly the ease and naturalness with which now the one, now the other emerges as supreme out of this chaotic theogony. This is the peculiar character of the ancient Vedic religion, totally different both from the Polytheism and from the Monotheism as we see it in the Greek and the Jewish religions; and if the Veda had taught us nothing else but this <em>henotheistic</em> phase, which must everywhere have preceded the more highly-organized phase of Polytheism which we see in Greece, in Rome, and elsewhere, the study of the Veda would not have been in vain.</p>
<p>It may be quite true that the poetry of the Veda is neither beautiful, in our sense of the word, nor very profound; but it is instructive. When we see those two giant spectres of Heaven and Earth on the background of the Vedic religion, exerting their influence for a time, and then vanishing before the light of younger and more active gods, we learn a lesson which it is well to learn, and which we can hardly learn anywhere else—the lesson <em>how gods were made and unmade</em>—how the Beyond or the Infinite was named by different names in order to bring it near to the mind of man, to make it for a time comprehensible, until, when name after name had proved of no avail, a nameless God was felt to answer best the restless cravings of the human heart.</p>
<p>I shall next translate to you the hymn to which I referred before as addressed to the Rivers. If the Rivers are to be called deities at all, they belong to the class of terrestrial deities. But the reason why I single out this hymn is not so much because it throws new light on the theogonic process, but because it may help to impart some reality to the vague conceptions which we form to ourselves of the ancient Vedic poets and their surroundings. The rivers invoked are, as we shall see, the real rivers of the Punjāb, and the poem shows a much wider geographical horizon than we should expect from a mere village-bard.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Let the poet declare, O Waters, your exceeding greatness, here in the seat of Vivasvat.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> By seven and seven they have come forth in three courses, but the Sindhu (the Indus) exceeds all the other wandering rivers by her strength.</p>

<p>This hymn does not sound perhaps very poetical, in our sense of the word; yet if you will try to realize the thoughts of the poet who composed it, you will perceive that it is not without some bold and powerful conceptions.</p>
<p>Take the modern peasants, living in their villages by the side of the Thames, and you must admit that he would be a remarkable man who could bring himself to look on the Thames as a kind of a general, riding at the head of many English rivers, and leading them on to a race or a battle. Yet it is easier to travel in England, and to gain a commanding view of the river-system of the country, than it was three thousand years ago to travel over India, even over that part of India which the poet of our hymn commands. He takes in at one swoop three great river-systems, or, as he calls them, three great armies of rivers—those flowing from the north-west into the Indus, those joining it from the north-east, and, in the distance, the Ganges and the Jumnah with their tributaries. Look on the map and you will see how well these three armies are determined; but our poet had no map—he had nothing but high mountains and sharp eyes to carry out his trigonometrical survey. Now I call a man, who for the first time could <em>see</em> those three marching armies of rivers, a poet.</p>
<p>The next thing that strikes one in that hymn—if hymn we must call it—is the fact that all these rivers, large and small, have their own proper names. That shows a considerable advance in civilized life, and it proves no small degree of coherence, or what the French call <em>solidarity</em>, between the tribes who had taken possession of Northern India. Most settlers call the river on whose banks they settle &ldquo;<em>the river</em>.&rdquo; Of course there are many names for river. It may be called the runner,<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> the fertilizer, the roarer—or, with a little poetical metaphor, the arrow, the horse, the cow, the father, the mother, the watchman, the child of the mountains. Many rivers had many names in different parts of their course, and it was only when communication between different settlements became more frequent, and a fixed terminology was felt to be a matter of necessity, that the rivers of a country were properly baptized and registered. All this had been gone through in India before our hymn became possible.</p>
<p>And now we have to consider another, to my mind most startling fact. We here have a number of names of the rivers of India, as they were known to one single poet, say about 1000 b.c. We then hear nothing of India till we come to the days of Alexander, and when we look at the names of the Indian rivers, represented as well as they could be by Alexander&rsquo;s companions, mere strangers in India, and by means of a strange language and a strange alphabet, we recognize, without much difficulty, nearly all of the old Vedic names.</p>
<p>In this respect the names of rivers have a great advantage over the names of towns in India. What we now call <em>Dilli</em> or <em>Delhi</em><sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> was in ancient times called Indraprastha, in later times <em>Shahjahānabād</em>. <em>Oude</em> is Ayodhyā, but the old name of Saketa is forgotten. The town of Paṭaliputra, known to the Greeks as <em>Palimbothra</em>, is now called <em>Patna</em>.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup></p>
<p>Now I can assure you this persistency of the Vedic river-names was to my mind something so startling that I often said to myself, This cannot be—there must be something wrong here. I do not wonder so much at the names of the <em>Indus</em> and the <em>Ganges</em> being the same. The Indus was known to early traders, whether by sea or by land. Skylax sailed from the country of the Paktys, <em>i.e.</em> the Pushtus, as the Afghans still call themselves, down to the mouth of the Indus. That was under Darius Hystaspes (521-486). Even before that time India and the Indians were known by their name, which was derived from <em>Sindhu</em>, the name of their frontier river. The neighboring tribes who spoke Iranic languages all pronounced, like the Persian, the ś as an ḥ.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup> Thus Sindhu became Hindhu (Hidhu), and, as h&rsquo;s were dropped even at that early time, Hindhu became Indu. Thus the river was called <em>Indos</em>, the people <em>Indoi</em> by the Greeks, who first heard of India from the Persians.</p>
<p><em>Sindhu</em> probably meant originally the divider, keeper, and defender, from sidh, to keep off. It was a masculine, before it became a feminine. No more telling name could have been given to a broad river, which guarded peaceful settlers both against the inroads of hostile tribes and the attacks of wild animals. A common name for the ancient settlements of the Aryans in India was &ldquo;the Seven Rivers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sapta Sindhavaḥ.&rdquo; But though sindhu was used as an appellative noun for river in general (cf. Rig-Veda VI. 19, 5, samudré ná síndhavaḥ yādamānāḥ, &ldquo;like rivers longing for the sea&rdquo;), it remained throughout the whole history of India the name of its powerful guardian river, the Indus.</p>
<p>In some passages of the Rig-Veda it has been pointed out that sindhu might better be translated by &ldquo;sea,&rdquo; a change of meaning, if so it can be called, fully explained by the geographical conditions of the country. There are places where people could swim across the Indus, there are others where no eye could tell whether the boundless expanse of water should be called river or sea. The two run into each other, as every sailor knows, and naturally the meaning of sindhu, river, runs into the meaning of sindhu, sea.</p>
<p>But besides the two great rivers, the Indus and the Ganges—in Sanskrit the Gangā, literally the Go-go—we have the smaller rivers, and many of their names also agree with the names preserved to us by the companions of Alexander.<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup></p>
<p>The Yamunā, the Jumna, was known to Ptolemy as <em>Διἁμουνα</em>,<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> to Pliny as Jomanes, to Arrian, somewhat corrupted, as Jôbares.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup></p>
<p>The śutudrî, or, as it was afterward called, śatadru, meaning &ldquo;running in a hundred streams,&rdquo; was known to Ptolemy as Ζαδἁρδης or Ζἁραδος ; Pliny called it Sydrus; and Megasthenes, too, was probably acquainted with it as Ζαδἁρδης. In the Veda<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup> it formed with the Vipaś the frontier of the Punjāb, and we hear of fierce battles fought at that time, it may be on the same spot where in 1846 the battle of the Sutledge was fought by Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Henry Hardinge. It was probably on the Vipāś (later Vipāśā), a north-western tributary of the Sutledge, that Alexander&rsquo;s army turned back. The river was then called Hyphasis; Pliny calls it Hypasis,<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup> a very fair approximation to the Vedic Vipāś, which means &ldquo;unfettered.&rdquo; Its modern name is Bias or Bejah.</p>
<p>The next river on the west is the Vedic Parushṇî, better known as Irāvatî,<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup> which Strabo calls Hyarotis, while Arrian gives it a more Greek appearance by calling it Hydraotes. It is the modern Rawi. It was this river which the Ten Kings when attacking the Tr̥tsus under Sudās tried to cross from the west by cutting off its water. But their stratagem failed, and they perished in the river (Rig-Veda VII. 18, 8-9).</p>
<p>We then come to the Asiknî, which means &ldquo;black.&rdquo; That river had another name also, candrabhāga, which means &ldquo;streak of the moon.&rdquo; The Greeks, however, pronounced that Σανδαροφἁγος, and this had the unlucky meaning of &ldquo;the devourer of Alexander.&rdquo; Hesychius tells us that in order to avert the bad omen Alexander changed the name of that river into Ακεσἱνης, which would mean &ldquo;the Healer;&rdquo; but he does not tell, what the Veda tells us, that this name Ακεσἱνης was a Greek adaptation of another name of the same river, namely Asiknî, which had evidently supplied to Alexander the idea of calling the Asiknî Ακεσἱνης. It is the modern Chināb.</p>
<p>Next to the Akesines we have the Vedic Vitastā, the last of the rivers of the Punjāb, changed in Greek into Hydaspes. It was to this river that Alexander retired, before sending his fleet down the Indus and leading his army back to Babylon. It is the modern Behat or Jilam.</p>
<p>I could identify still more of these Vedic rivers, such as, for instance, the Kubhā, the Greek Cophen, the modern Kabul river;<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup> but the names which I have traced from the Veda to Alexander, and in many cases from Alexander again to our own time, seem to me sufficient to impress upon us the real and historical character of the Veda. Suppose the Veda were a forgery—suppose at least that it had been put together after the time of Alexander—how could we explain these names? They are names that have mostly a meaning in Sanskrit, they are names corresponding very closely to their Greek corruptions, as pronounced and written down by people who did not know Sanskrit. How is a forgery possible here?</p>
<p>I selected this hymn for two reasons. First, because it shows us the widest geographical horizon of the Vedic poets, confined by the snowy mountains in the north, the Indus and the range of the Suleiman mountains in the west, the Indus or the seas in the south, and the valley of the Jumna and Ganges in the east. Beyond that, the world, though open, was unknown to the Vedic poets. Secondly, because the same hymn gives us also a kind of historical background to the Vedic age. These rivers, as we may see them to-day, as they were seen by Alexander and his Macedonians, were seen also by the Vedic poets. Here we have an historical continuity—almost living witnesses, to tell us that the people whose songs have been so strangely, ay, you may almost say, so miraculously preserved to us, were real people, lairds with their clans, priests, or rather, servants of their gods, shepherds with their flocks, dotted about on the hills and valleys, with inclosures or palisades here and there, with a few strongholds, too, in case of need—living their short life on earth, as at that time life might be lived by men, without much pushing and crowding and trampling on each other—spring, summer, and winter leading them on from year to year, and the sun in his rising and setting lifting up their thoughts from their meadows and groves which they loved, to a world in the East, from which they had come, or to a world in the West, to which they were gladly hastening on. They had what I call religion, though it was very simple, and hardly reduced as yet to the form of a creed. &ldquo;There is a Beyond,&rdquo; that was all they felt and knew, though they tried, as well as they could, to give names to that Beyond, and thus to change religion into <em>a</em> religion. They had not as yet a name for God—certainly not in our sense of the word—or even a general name for the gods; but they invented name after name to enable them to grasp and comprehend by some outward and visible tokens powers whose presence they felt in nature, though their true and full essence was to them, as it is to us, invisible and incomprehensible.</p>

<p>As it has been doubted, and even denied, that the publication of the Rig-Veda and its native commentary has had some important bearing on the resuscitation of the religious life of India, I feel bound to give at least one from the many testimonials which I have received from India.

<p>I formerly translated yát vãjān abhí ádravaḥ tvám by &ldquo;when thou rannest for the prizes.&rdquo; Grassman had translated similarly, &ldquo;When thou, O Sindhu, rannest to the prize of the battle,&rdquo; while Ludwig wrote, &ldquo;When thou, O Sindhu, wast flowing on to greater powers.&rdquo; Vāja, connected with vegeo, vigeo, vigil, wacker (see Curtius, Grundzüge, No. 159), is one of the many difficult words in the Veda the general meaning of which may be guessed, but in many places cannot yet be determined with certainty. Vāja occurs very frequently, both in the singular and the plural, and some of its meanings are clear enough. The Petersburg Dictionary gives the following list of them—swiftness, race, prize of race, gain, treasure, race-horse, etc. Here we perceive at once the difficulty of tracing all these meanings back to a common source, though it might be possible to begin with the meanings of strength, strife, contest, race, whether friendly or warlike, then to proceed to what is won in a race or in war, viz. booty, treasure, and lastly to take vāgāḥ in the more general sense of acquisitions, goods, even goods bestowed as gifts. We have a similar transition of meaning in the Greek ἁθλος, contest, contest for a prize, and ἁθλον, the prize of contest, reward, gift, while in the plural τἁ ἁθλα stands again for contest, or even the place of combat. The Vedic vājambhara may in fact be rendered by ἁθλοφὑρος, vājasāti by ἁθλοσὑνη.</p>
<p>The transition from fight to prize is seen in passages such as:</p>
<p>Rig-Veda VI. 45, 12, vãjān indra śravãyyān tváyā jeshna hitám dhánam, &ldquo;May we with thy help, O Indra, win the glorious fights, the offered prize&rdquo; (cf. ἁθλοθἑτης).</p>
<p>Rig-Veda VIII. 19, 18, té it vãjebhiḥ jigyuḥ mahát dhánam, &ldquo;They won great-wealth by battles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What we want for a proper understanding of our verse, are passages where we have, as here, a movement toward vājas in the plural. Such passages are few; for instance: X. 53, 8, átra jahāma yé ásan áśevāh śivãn vayám út tarema abhí vājān, &ldquo;Let us leave here those who were unlucky (the dead), and let us get up to lucky toils.&rdquo; No more is probably meant here when the Sindhu is said to run toward her vājas, that is, her struggles, her fights, her race across the mountains with the other rivers.&#160;<a href="#fnref:48" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Vājinîvatî is by no means an easy word. Hence all translators vary, and none settles the meaning. Muir translates, &ldquo;yielding nutriment;&rdquo; Zimmer, &ldquo;having plenty of quick horses;&rdquo; Ludwig, &ldquo;like a strong mare.&rdquo; Vajin, no doubt, means a strong horse, a racer, but vajinî never occurs in the Rig-Veda in the sense of a mare, and the text is not vajinîvat, but vajinîvatî. If vājinî meant mare, we might translate rich in mares, but that would be a mere repetition after svaśvā, possessed of good horses. Vajinîvatî is chiefly applied to Ushas, Sarasvatî, and here to the river Sindhu. It is joined with vajebhiḥ, Rig-Veda I. 3, 10, which, if vājinî meant mare, would mean &ldquo;rich in mares through horses.&rdquo; We also read, Rig-Veda I. 48, 16, sám (naḥ mimikshvá) vãjaiḥ vājinîvati, which we can hardly translate by &ldquo;give us horses, thou who art possessed of mares;&rdquo; nor, Rig-Veda I. 92, 15, yúkshva hí vājinîvati áśvān, &ldquo;harness the horses, thou who art rich in mares.&rdquo; In most of the passages where vājinîvatî occurs, the goddess thus addressed is represented as rich, and asked to bestow wealth, and I should therefore prefer to take vājínî, as a collective abstract noun, like tretínî, in the sense of wealth, originally booty, and to translate vājinîvatî simply by rich, a meaning well adapted to every passage where the word occurs.&#160;<a href="#fnref:56" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Sîlamāvatî does not occur again in the Rig-Veda. Muir translates, &ldquo;rich in plants;&rdquo; Zimmer, &ldquo;rich in water;&rdquo; Ludwig takes it as a proper name. Sāyaṇa states that sîlamā is a plant which is made into ropes. That the meaning of sîlamāvatî was forgotten at an early time we see by the Atharva-Veda III. 12, 2, substituting sūnr̥tāvatî, for sîlamāvatî, as preserved in the śānkhāyana Gr̥hya-sūtras, 3, 3. I think sîlamā means straw, from whatever plant it may be taken, and this would be equally applicable to a śāla, a house, a sthūṇa, a post, and to the river Indus. It may have been, as Ludwig conjectures, an old local name, and in that case it may possibly account for the name given in later times to the Suleiman range.&#160;<a href="#fnref:58" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Madhuvr̥dh is likewise a word which does not occur again in the Rig-Veda. Sãyaṇa explains it by nirguṇdi and similar plants, but it is doubtful what plant is meant. Guṇda is the name of a grass, madhuvr̥dh therefore may have been a plant such as sugar-cane, that yielded a sweet juice, the Upper Indus being famous for sugar-cane; see Hiouen-thsang, II. p. 105. I take adhivaste with Roth in the sense &ldquo;she dresses herself,&rdquo; as we might say &ldquo;the river is dressed in heather.&rdquo; Muir translates, &ldquo;she traverses a land yielding sweetness;&rdquo; Zimmer, &ldquo;she clothes herself in Madhuvr̥dh;&rdquo; Ludwig, &ldquo;the Sîlamāvatî throws herself into the increaser of the honey-sweet dew.&rdquo; All this shows how little progress can be made in Vedic scholarship by merely translating either words or verses, without giving at the same time a full justification of the meaning assigned to every single word.&#160;<a href="#fnref:59" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The first tributaries which join the Indus before its meeting with the Kubhā or the Kabul river cannot be determined. All travellers in these northern countries complain of the continual changes in the names of the rivers, and we can hardly hope to find traces of the Vedic names in existence there after the lapse of three or four thousand years. The rivers intended may be the Shauyook, Ladak, Abba Seen, and Burrindu, and one of the four rivers, the Rasā, has assumed an almost fabulous character in the Veda. After the Indus has joined the Kubhā or the Kabul river, two names occur, the Gomatî and Krumu, which I believe I was the first to identify with the modern rivers the Gomal and Kurrum. (Roth, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, p. 43, Anm.) The Gomal falls into the Indus, between Dera Ismael Khan and Paharpore, and although Elphinstone calls it a river only during the rainy season, Klaproth (Foe-koue-ki, p. 23) describes its upper course as far more considerable, and adds: &lsquo;Un peu à l&rsquo;est de Sirmágha, le Gomal traverse la chaîne de montagnes de Solimán, passe devant Raghzi, et fertilise le pays habité par les tribus de Dauletkhail et de Gandehpour. Il se dessèche au défilé de Pezou, et son lit ne se remplit plus d&rsquo;eau que dans la saison des pluies; alors seulement il rejoint la droite de l&rsquo;Indus, au sud-est de bourg de Paharpour.&rsquo; The Kurrum falls into the Indus north of the Gomal, while, according to the poet, we should expect it south. It might be urged that poets are not bound by the same rules as geographers, as we see, for instance, in the verse immediately preceding. But if it should be taken as a serious objection, it will be better to give up the Gomatî than the Krumu, the latter being the larger of the two, and we might then take Gomatî, &lsquo;rich in cattle,&rsquo; as an adjective belonging to Krumu.&quot;—From a review of General Cunningham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ancient Geography of India,&rdquo; in <em>Nature</em>, 1871, Sept. 14.&#160;<a href="#fnref:71" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
