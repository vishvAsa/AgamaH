It has been said that man looks zward, he looks around, and he looks upward, and out of his response and reaction to this threefold looking' of bis are born his religion and philo sophy To put the same thing la other words, man (25 implied by looking inward"), universe (as implied by 'lookuog around'), and god (as implied by looking upward') are the three basic themes of man's religio-philosophical speculations You art, perhaps, aware that I have already sitten and published to monographs-one og "Man in Hindu thought" and the other on "God in Hindu Thought" . I am now engaged on preparing a monograph on "Uonerse in Hindo thought", and I propose to present before you some aspects of that subject - ladeed, just a few aspects which can be conveniently dealt with in these three lectures - mainly in the light of Vedic evidence The title of the settes of these lectures, accordingly, needs to be changed to “Unterse la Vedic Thought " 
The subxect of the Universe in Hindu (or rather, Vedic ) Thought” can be studied mainly from three points of yew - Damely (1) of cosmogony-cosmography (that is, of the origla, cuolation, and nature of the onnierse ard of the plan and stracture of the unnerse), (2) of caythology (considered mainly under three heads a creation aod organization of the Universe as a fanction of the dinimitres, [6] deification of cosmo graphical regions like heaven, earth, etc., and (c] assignment of cosmographical regions as abodes of gods ), and (3) of ethics-eschatology The desire to know the origo and nature of things may be said to be almost unborn a map Accordingly,

attempts are seen to bave been made by man, even in the ipfapcy of the human race, to explażn the origin and development and the plan and structure of the world which surrounded him and which naturally aroused his interest, in other words, to evolve some kind of cosmogonical myth Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any period in the history of man when he had not formu "lated a cosmogonical myth It should also be remembered that the cosmogonical notions of man have always influenced and are often reflected in his ritual The parallelism between myth and ritual must never be lost sight of while studying any ancient religion 
To begin with what I have elsewhere characterised as the protohistoric Hinduism, we have to admit that hardly any material has become available which would help us to visualise its cosmology cosmograpy The evidence brought forth by archaeological excavations for the reconstruction of the material civilization of the protohistoric period of India's history is DO doubt fairly rich, but attention bas also been appropriately drano to the notorious incapacity of material symbols to represent the true contents and aflidity of a religion or belief's Notwith standing this, some speculations regarding the beliefs of the Indus people about the universe, particularly from the eschatological point of view have been hazarded on the basis of very meagre and obviously unconvincing evidence It has, for instance, been suggested that the Indus people believed in a sky-world or rather in a solar world, to which the spirits of the dead were supposed to repair after death An ellipsoid urn recovered from the cemetery at Harappa ( denoted by H 206 b) is presumed to depict a funeral Scene It is claimed that the therianthropic figure (the upper part of the body being that of a peacock and the lower one that of a man) shown standing between the animals represents the subtle body (sük sma sar ra) of the dead person and the animals his guides to the land of bliss or the solar world Another burial um

One finds oneself on a surer ground shen one comes to the age of the Veda. The Vedic interature is fortunately rich in speculations relating to the various aspects of the subject of the opiverse Broadly speaking, prayers and mythological traditions constitute the principal content of the Rgreda But the Rgvedic poet-priests have by no means ignored cosmogony, which, as a matter of fact, often represents the first manifestation of religious thought. Their cosmogonical speculations either form part of the general pattern of their mythology or are expressed in the form of independent cosmogonical myths Naturally enough, we conot speak of any single uniform cosmogonical theory of the Rgreda as such. It would seem that various explanations about the origin and nature of the universe were put forth though Aone of them had been finally confirmed Further, it has been rightly suggested that any particular cosmogonical theory has to be related to the man and not to the age It also needs to be remembered that these various theories are by do means mutually exclosite One more thing In my various writings I have consistently advocated the view that the major roythology of the Rgreda is essentially evolutionary in character 10 I must, however, state here that, uolike the Kgredic mythology, the cosmogony

of the Rgicda can be ill subjected to an evolutionary inter pretation 
A mention may be made at this stage of a few more points, which, as a matter of fact, may be said to apply to Hindu cosmo gony as a whole According to the Rgveda, creation is not a single definite act - it is regarded as ever proceeding " It is a process and not a single event But, unlike the Purana cosmo. logy, the Vedic cosmology does not speak of repeated creations A Vedic poet asserts that the heaven and the earth have been created but once RV VI 48 22 tells us sahrdd ha dy aur ajājata sahrd bhūmir ajájala In the Rgvedic passage, sūryācandramasau drātā jathāpūrsam akalpajat, etc (X 190 3), the word yatha. pūrvam has to be understood in the sense, “according to the proper order "" This is confirmed by the reference in the Vajasaney, Samhita (40 8), Jāthatathyalo 'rthân ny adadhat Secondly, the concept of creation er nihilo is practically unknown to Hiodu thought As a matter of fact such a concept is gene rally not to be found in any of the ancient cosmogopies Crea. tion usually implies the transformation of the potential into the actual or the establishment of cosmos in the place of chaos It is, indeed, in this latter sense that the Rta is often characterised as the source of the phenomena djävā ha k samā prathame rienā 'bhıśrāve bhavatah (RV X 12 1) In the only Rgvedic passage, which seems to suggest that something was produced out of Dothing, namely, devānām pūrvje juge 'saiah sad jāj ata (X, 72 2) the word asal actually means. primordial non-differentia tion or distinctionlessness' rather than norbing. 18 And, thirdly, Vedic cosmogony does not have any teleological significance

The creator, whenever be is mentioned, is hardly ever represented as haizog beer caosed by aos idea of executing any deliberate plan. It is perhaps on account of this that the creator as such does not play any promirent role in Hindu religious thought which rarely concerns itself with the design, object, or purpose of the world 
It is well known that the creation of the annerse is ascribed in the RgTeda to various disputes The relevant Rgvedic passages are too many to be septioped bere The creaton of the Odiverse, indeed, constitutes almost an inevitable feature of the full-ledged mythological personalities of the Vedic gods The cosmological activity of the Vedic gods is often described as a work of art and is commonly expressed through the Cetaphors of building', 101ping, 'neavog', 'mooldog's etc ! Such references, however, have so many cases, merely a rhetorical rather than cosmogonial import It may be empha sized, at this stage, that, broadls spealing, in Vedic anythology, the Cosmogonical themes and the legends of god, do not show any organic unity There do, honeer, exist, in Rgvedic mythology, some divinities which are more or less exclusively connected with the creative activity Among these a special refereace deserves to be made to Tiastr and Yaralarman Tv2str was originally regarded as having been responsible for the creation of the All verse, but when, in the evolutionary mythology of the Rgveda, history was mythologised and the human hero Indra was trans formed into a cosmic god, he usurped Tvastrs function as the creator za the same way as he usurped Tnta Aptya's function as the raid-god Is It has also been suggested that Trastr must have bem Jonged to extra-Vedic tradition, that the Rbhus wer: represented u the Rgreda as bis friendly nsals, and that, after he had been ditested of his cosmolagical functions, he became a fertiuty-god and a god of handicraft.1 As for Vivakaroo, his personality

scems to have resulted from a conscious effort to represent a unity of godhead through the creatorship of the universe 17 
A tendency has also become evident in recent years to see in the Indra Vitra-fight an Original Aryan myth of creation 19 It is pointed out that Indra slays with his vajra the power of resistance of the inert chaos (1rtra). splits the primordial mountain on which Vrtra was residing and thereby brings out the goods of life symbolised by fire (Agni-Surya) and water (Apah-Soma) By slaying Vitra, Indra also separates the heaven from the earth, which event represents an early stage in the process of creation This view is slightly modified by KUIPER19 who has suggested that the Indra-Vrtra-fight reflected only the second stage in the process of creation Waters represented the beginning of the universe Within those waters, there emerged the primordial mountain Indra directed his assaults against this mountain which had been Vstra's abode, slew Vitra, and thereby advanced the cosmogonical process KUIPER wonders whether all this cannot be construed as just a macrocosmic projection of a necessarily individual recollection of the embryogonic experience Indra's great creation act, he further asserts, 20 is repeated every morning and leads up every year, at the time of the winter solstice, to a new crisis '21 It would, however, seem that the cosmogonical traits in the Indra mythology were not original but that they were superimposed on it at a later stage in the evolution of Indra's personality and character as a part of the mythologisa. tion of history Indra is obviously a newcomer in Vedic mytho

logy-he is ánujāvara-and there must have been in vogue some cosmogonical myth even before Jadra care to be glonfied as the supreme god of the Rgieda As has been already indicated, Indra must have superseded his father' or 'grandfather' Trastr and must have thereby talen over to himself the cosmogodical func uoos of the latter 
As agalost Indra's, Yamna s role in the cosmological act must be regarded as more basic and essential There occurs in the Rgreda a rather obscure - but, for our present purpose, a highly significant-reference to lama RIX 13 4 reads

There is ample euidence in the Rgredo to show that Yama was a god RV I 83 5, for instance, speaks of Jamasja jalam amrtam As such he was entitled to immortality (amirtatra) Notwithstanding this Yama, we are told, opted for death - be surrendered his own dear body in the sacrifice of the gods for the sake of procreation Yama sas a god man - an immortal who willingly suffered death.

characterised by the self-immolation of a god-man and which was intended for prajā (procreation ) 23 
An extended version of this cosmogonical speculation occurs in the famous Purusa-Sūkta (RV X 90) The Purusa, whose characterisation as purusa suggests his humanness but whose epithets, amirtatasya icana, etc, clearly indicate his divideness, was, like Yama, a god-man in the primeval sacrifice of the gods, the principal oblation was this Purusa bimself (purusena havisa derā jajñan alamata) The various parts of the universe (as also of the human society) issued out from the various limbs of the sacrificed primal person 
Attention may be drawn to another significant motif associa ted with the self immolation of the god-man, Purusa or Yama This god-man was also a hermaphrodite - being constituted simultaneously of male and female This is suggested by the Purusa-Virāç concept in the Purusa-Suhia and the Yama-Yami concept in the Yama mythology We, thus, have in the Rgreda the cosmogopical theory, according to which thc universe is believed to have been the result of the self immolation of a bermaphrodite god-man It may also be pointed out that the idea of sexual congress of a male and a female as the starting point of the creation of the universe is implied in the relationship between Purusa and Vırāt (X 90 5), Aditi and Daksa (X 72 4), Yama and Yami (X 10), and even Dyauh and Pythivi (VI 70 3) 
The Hindus have conceived of the universe as being infinite in time and space Though this notion becomes particularly emphatic only in the post-Vedic literature, we do get some intimations of it even in the Rgreda A reference may be made in this connection to the mythological concept of Aditi who personifies infinity "l or eternity 36 or immeosity"! or

The ancestors of the Vedic laders lived in close proximity to nature It was but to be espected that, in that stage of their cultural life, they should have been deeply impressed by the vist Dess, brilliance, confession, and bounty of rature It wis, indeed this pomary Lopression of theirs which the Vedic poets sought to project symbolically ut their religion» ideology through the mythological concept of the cosmic parcats presented by the dual divinity, Dzīvāprthivi From the point of view of compari tive mythology, however, it nould appear that the personalities of the Father Sky (drau'r pota) acd the Mother Earth (preko milu) In the Vedic mythology, unlike those of their coapterparts in the other lado-European raythologies, remuned more or less arrested 10 their growth. The main reason for this I believe, was that, n their raythology, the Vedc Anans did not put so much emphasis on the fact that the nature around them was vast, brilliant, and bountiful as on their uncanny esperience that, in spite of its vastgess, nature wis estreinely well-ordered ard wert regulated It was out of this profouod realisation that they $000 cvolved the concepts of the cosmic Law, Roz and its administrator, Asura Varuna *1 Eventually, Rta became the pivot of their cosmogoncal speculations

Varuna enforced his cosmic law,32 Rta, in a very subtle way, by binding down the various aspects of creation by means of 
ropeless bonds' as it were (setrbhir arajjubhih, RV VII 84 2) The very word varuna is derived from the root or “to bind" Elsewhere the Rgvedic poets speak of Varuna holding up fast the crown of the tree (presumably, the heaven ) in the foundation less' space ( abudhne rāja varuno vanasyo 'rdhivam stūpam dadate pütadak sah, RV I 24 7 138 and of the great master fitting 10 together the two wide, deep, and well founded worlds in the 'beamless' region (uni gabhire rajasi sumehe avamse dhirah Sacjā samairat, RV IV 56 3) And Varuna could accomplish such mysterious feats because he was Asura One of the most fundamental beliets of the Vedic Aryans was that, though the universe was varied and multiform in outward appearance, it was unitary and uniform in essence A single all pervading and more or less somatic magic potence permeated through the various constituents of the universe and thereby invested them, so to say, with existence and life Indeed, such a belief was common to many ancient ideologies The Vedic Aryans seem to have denoted this cosmic magical potence by the term asu God, man, beast, tree, etc, might appear to be different from one another for all practical purposes, but, as possessors of asu, they were all essen tially identical The differences among them were quantitative rather than qualitative The word asura is derived from asu (the magic potence) and ra (a possessive termination) Asura was the possessor of the greatest quantity of asu Varuna was Asura par excellence in the Vedic mythology, and so he could effectively administer the cosmic law, Ria The epithet asura is, no doubt, applied to some other Vedic gods, but that is only to suggest that, compared to the other constituents of the universe, such as man, beast etc, the gods possessed a greater amount of

a Verily, it is jo ves of this peculiar as:/-Ideology of the Vedic Aryans that I have ventured to characterise the religion of the early RgTeda as Pan-asuis rather than Pantheista." 
Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, 10 cosmicethical contexts, the opposite of Rta is lurti, bile honad-moral contexts, the dualism is csualls implied between ria and crrta, though, un later times when the Rta-ideology lost much of its intrinsic relevance, one began to speak of satra and arrta rather than of na agd arta,

question is generally raised in respect of the origin of waters themselves Even Višvakarman is said to have been preceded by this primordial substance or substratum 38 Waters were "the primitive medium in the womb of which is fashioned everything that exists "39 tam id garbham prathamam dadhra apo jatra devāh sam agacchanta viste (RV X 82 6), and the poet of RV X 129 1 asks about them “What was that deep bottomless water?" ambhah kim asid gahanam gabhiram 48 Verily, in all periods of the history of Hindu thought, waters have been regarded, in different ways as the material source of the universe According to the Hiranyagarbha sūkta (RV X 121 ), the primal spirit or the highest god, who is later identified with Prajapati, originated in the primeral waters as Hiranyagarbha, the Golden Embryo, which, incidentally, is sometimes described as the principle of fire floating upon waters, and subsequently started the cosmogonical process The Rgvedic Hiranyagarbha may be identified with heranyajetasa - the golden reed - referred to in Atharvaveda X 7 41 Hiranyagarbha may also be related to the myth of Aditi ( who can be equated with primeval waters) and Mārtānda 41 Then there is also the cosmogonical theory (RV X 129 ) that, in the primordial condition which could not be described either as sat because it was uncharacterisable or as asat because it possessed the potentiality of evolving, there arose, at the outset, häma or the original impulse for creation, and this marked the beginning of the subsequent evolution of being Further, in this very content may be mentioned the creative role of sāk 12 As for the cosmogony of the Athanaveda, by and large it speaks of the Prajāpati like highest god conceived under different names and forms such as rolula (XIII 3-4), anadian (IV 11 ), kala (XIX 53-54), kāma (XIX 52), as the creator of the universe

Speculations more or less similar to the Vedic ones c3o be traced in various ancient cosmogonies For mstance, waters are regarded as the primal matter in the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek cosmogonies The Egyptun and Greek cosmogonies also hare the notion of the cosmic egg. Vedic Kāma may be said to correspond with Greek Eros, and the sexual relationship between the sky and the earth is referred to i Hebrew cosmogony It may also be pointed out that unlike Vedic cosmogony, the ancient Iranian cosmogony is one of opposition. The entire cosmic process, according to the latter, consists of a senes of beneficent creations by Ahura Mazdab and malebcent counter creatious by Ahrimao 
Very little has been said in the Agreda about the actual process and order of the creation of the universe A reference may, however, be made in this consection to a couple of passages In one rather obscure passage ( 72 3-4) we are told 10 the first cpoch of the gods, sat tras born from asor,' after it (sat) onginated the world-regions (asāh), and that one subsequent to the couchant ( utlänapad what this ultārapad denotes is oot at all clear 14, the earth was bom from the couchant and from the earth onginated the world-regions Elsewhere (X. 190 1-2) 1t 15 sard Rta and sarja ongated from tapas, from it (it is not clear what this it' denotes, or does tarah mean thereafter'?) the night, and therefrom the agitatug ocean, from the agitating ocean was bom the year (perhaps, symbolising time), which, rulog over all that wils, organizes days and nights I think that the abstruse Rgvedic stanza (X 27 23 ), deraram mare prathamā atisham, etc., also refers to the process and order of the creation of the universe

An essential feature of Vedic – indeed, of the entire Hindu - cosmography is the system of lokas' or worlds or cosmographical regions There is, however, to be seen considerable vagueness, inconsistency, and confusion about the various details regarding these lokas For instance, the conflicting Vedic statements in respect of the number of lokas constituting the universe cannot be reduced to any kind of uniformity Usually the Vedic poets speak of a dual division of the universe The universe is said to be constituted of dyaus (heaven) and prthivi (earth) Inciden tally, the word dyaus is translated both as 'sky' and beaven' However, in the Vedic contexts, I prefer the rendering heaven' The word svarga, which is invariably employed in later literature to denote heaven, occurs but once in the Rgveda (X. 75 18) The Vedic poets express the idea of the whole universe through the mention of the heaven and the earth together - however, not uncommonly in contradictory terms, such as that the heaven and the earth are the parents of gods and that they are generated by gods 8 
It was believed that the heaven and the earth were originally joined together This is faintly suggested in several Rgvedic passages - but is more clearly stated in the Brāhmanas For instance, the Altareja-Brāhmana (IV 27) says imou vai lokaut saha astām. They were subsequently separated and held apart One of the features of the enforcement of the cosmic law by Varuna

The separation of the heaven and the earth from each other resulted ja tbe emergence of antariksa or the midregron. Indra is said to have measured out the midregion wider jo antarik sam vi mame varījah (RV II 122) It is, indeed, sugges ted that coming toto being at creation consisted largely un being able to pass between the heaven and the earth 
The references in the Rgveda to the three lokas (Worlds or regions ), namely, djaw (beaveo ), antariksa (mdregion), and prihm ( earth ),are so frequent that one is inclined to think that the Vedic Aryans rather assumed a tripartite division of the Universe. The heaven is then referred to as trtija,' uttama,to or

parama, 11 while the earth is upara12 or Asam 13 Sometimes these three worlds are mentioned and then one of the three is addition ally mentioned in the same passage 11 There are also indications that three of one of these three worlds, for instance, three dāvah or three prthiyah, are made to denote the whole universe It would seem that Hindu cosmographical speculations were greatly influenced by the numbers 'three' and 'seven' by the number 
three' generally in the Vedic texts and by the number 'seven' 10 the Puranas The Vajasaneji-Samhuta ( 8 60) mentions the usual three lokas, namely, dyaus, antariksa, and prthivi, and further adds jam ham ca lokam, thus suggesting the possibility of the existence of more than those three lokas Nāka or the firmament or the heavenly vault15 is sometimes mentioned besides the usual triad as a region higher than that triad 16 The purpose of nāka seems to have been to hold the stars or to serve as the basis of the heavenly ocean which encompasses the whole world A passage in the Atharraveda (IV 14 3) seems to speak of a realm of celestial light (svar potih) as a region further beyond nāka (dno nākasya prsthåt svar otir agām aham) However, the turizam drāma referred to in RV IX 96 19 does not seem to possess any cosmographical significance, though Sāyana, and following him LUDWIG and GELDNER, understand the phrase as denoting the moon 
The number three has been exploited by the Rgvedic poets in connection with their cosmography in various other ways For instance, apart from the heaven, the midregion, and the earth, they speak of three heavens (djavah) and three earths (bhumin) making up a sixfold pattern ( sadrdhanah),17 or of three earths (bhūmih) and three higher regions ( uttarant),18 or of three carths (bhumih) and three realms of light (rocană), or of three realms

The expression sal ursih, sus Wide ones, occurs in the Rgreda three times, 21 but is none of these passages docs its exact signifi cance become clear It may be presumed that sal urtih more or less correspond with the sad rajámsı of RI'I 164 6 and represent the six #7de regions #bich make up the uniterse, for, it is asserted that do world custs outside of the sol urtih na räbhyo bhuanam kaccanā 're (RV VI 47 3) They may thus be understood to denote the three heavens and the three earths referred to above But Sīyana, commenting on RV X 128 5, says that the sit us are, according to the scripture (presumably, the Asfalājana Sraulasūtra 1 2 3 and Sankhāj ana-Srautajūtra 1 64), dy aw, pathiri, day, night, waters, and plants Honever, the Satapatha. Brāhmana, which is the oldest text explaining the term sad ursih, speaks ( 5 22 ) of agrih, prthiri, apah, rajah, ahah, aod rärnk, while elsewhere dy aus, prikri, ápah, osadhajah, ürk, and sünrtā are also mentioned in this connection Obviously, all this is quite formulaic In a passage to the Atharrarede (VIII 9 16), $ix dj žāprthrris and sux urris are mentioned side by side perhaps in syntactic parallelism 
It is geedless to point out that the various words used in the hgreda in connection with the aniverse and its different regions throw much belpful light on the Vedic notions about the nature and structure of the paiverse Tte significance of many of these Words -- such as prthii (extended), mahi (great), uyi (wide), and bhumi (-bhūman (that which has come into being, Secon darily, place of becoming or prosperiog, amplitude) (all these detoting the earth ), dj aus (shining), rocand (realm of light), and woman (from the root yu mth ri that which has beea separated and held apart, some scholars derive the word from the

shiding in the middle')?" – is self-evident The concept of loka in the Veda has been studied in great detail by Professor GONDA,2% and it has been shown, among other things, that loka, originally connected with light, represents, more particularly, 'a place or position of religious or psychological interest', or a place which has come into contact with "power" , or 'room to exist in freely and without hindrance and obstruction' It has been further stated that the term loka denotes 'the diversification of the primordial cosmic unity' Similarly it has been shown that in the ultimate analysis, the term bhavana may be understood in the sense of the whole aggregate of what has come and is coming into being * 24 In the Rgveda, the word rajas, when used 10 singular, denotes the midregion, when used in plural, it depotes the worlds or regions in general That word is derived from the Indo-European reg 'to stretch out,' and originally means 'that which has been stretched out ** space', and more specifically the space above the earth Heinrich ZIMMER assumes2s the existeoce of a rajas beneath the earth to account for the sun's course from the west towards the east during the night in this connection, be refers to the Rgvedic passages, such as, VI 91, VII 80 1, and IX 68 3 But this is rather far-fetched Most of the Rgvedic passages, in which the word rajas occurs, clearly point to the region or regions above the earth But the word seems to have eventually acquired a special sease The portion of the upper space attached to the earth was darker than the one which was attached to the heaven The former came to be known as rajas and the latter as rocana The phrase krsna rajas is not

The possibility is also suggested of the dpal rajasi being an abbreviated form of rajas plas rocara It must, howeser, be remembered that, in the Rgreda, the word rojas is not everywhere used in the special sense mentioned above. lacidentally, it may be pointed out that the word rajas, hardly occurs in the Rgreda in the sense of darkness' or 'dust' as such.1 
It is interesting to note that ison (ks , grā) earth is Inguístically related to lat hurris earth ard homohonan beug,' thus perhaps suggesting that the earth is the place suitable for human habitation Later scbolasts, however, explain that the earth is called ksma, ksara, because she bears patiently (samate) The exact derivation of the Ford roke is uncertain. It is etymologally coopected with *na?. 'skin,' bude,' *corer. ing,' and its meaning heavenly vault', 'firmament is thereby sought to be confirmed There by also the new that the word räka is to be related to such words as upala, wala, ete, which are indicative of directors, and that it is to be then explained as 
that to which one points upwards' It is suggested that the helen is sometimes called amar. (RV V 30 8, 56 4) (f. Persian-Hindi asmān=sky, heaven) because of its resemblance to a stone -vault. It, however, seems more likely that the heaven is called asman, because it bears the asman or the clouds. The word asan primarily means 'rock, but, in the Rgveda, it is also used in the sense of cloud' (cf RV II 12. 3), because black clouds look like huge rocks It is from this very pont of view that the heaven is abo called rabhas "clocd-bedecked,' the word rabhas originally harag the sense of cloud

1 The word rodasī is variously derived It is suggested that the original word is rodas (neut), which may have meant earth 28 The word rodas is connected with lat rudis raw', 'wild' and rullus rustic' and may imply the grossness and ruggeddess of the earth as compared to the other two lokas Rodasi is then explained as an elliptical dual denoting both the heaven and the earth 29 A reference may be made here, in passing, to the word visa, which, as a substantive, depotes 'all,' everything' That word seems to imply an 'organic whole. According to GONDA, visva means analytical and enumerative totality, as against sarva which connotes synthetical totality, completeness, wholeness, integrity 34 Attention may also be drawn, in this very context, to the various pairs of opposites, such as jagar lasthus, jagat sthātr, jät-avasıta, divja-părthna, darvja mānusa, jivaloka amriasya loka, each of which pairs denotes 'all being 31 
It has been already pointed out that the Vedic poets often think of Dyāvāppthivi as a single mythological entity Dyāvā. prthivi (also referred to as dyarák sämā, dj āvābhūmi, or rodası) play not an unimportant role in Vedic mythology Six whole hymns in the Rgreda are addressed to this dual divinity, and it is also mentioned in over 100 isolated passages Dyāvāprthivi are celebrated as the primeval parents (pūnaje pitară RV VII 53 2, X 65 8) - as the cosmic father and mother (pitä mätä сa bhuva nânı rak satah, RVI 160 2, or djaur me pitā jantā nābhir atra bandhur me māta prthivi mahi "yam, RV I 164 33 ) 31 But, as has been already pointed out unlike in many ancient mythologies, the character of Father Sky and Mother Earth as the basic cultic

figures was not sufficiently developed in Vedic mythology ** Dyavāprthivi are said to have given birth to the gods - they are deraputre par excellence 34 - though they are also sometimes said to have been gederated by the gods However, in the Rgreda, there is hardly any direct reference to the marriage between Dyats and Prthuvi, such as the one which he meet with, perhaps for the first time, la the Aitare) a-Brahmana IV 27 (au samsanlar etam derarirāham r ai aherăm lodeed, there is not much sex symbolism in tbe Rgvedic mythology relating to Dyāsāpsthivī, except perhaps as implied in a couple of passages like ni mātara FLIJ ani retase bhuje (RLI 155 3 “He, that is, Visou, leads the two parents to the enjoyment of the semen") or jurok sıktā FIStripānı sarrolá (RV VI 70 3 "The semen of jou two gives rise to the multiform beiogs which follow the selfsame ordi Dance"). The references im RY I 71 5,2 61 5-7 to the 1acest of a father with his daughter presomably relate to the myth of Dyaus and bus daughter Usas rather than to Dyaus and Prthivi as suggested by some scholars The latter are together called pilara or mătară or svasarā Dyáváprthivi are further said to support all things (19) am imanā bibhrtah RI I 185 1) and proiect all beings (apı ra jošā janimāni raste, RV II 38 8) Horcier, their mythological growth was manifestly arrested even 13 the Rgreda and they are more or less completely subordinated in Vedic ritual 
The Rgvedic poets seem to seek deliberately to establish the equality of the two components of this daal divinity For instance, one of them asks, Latarā pirtā katarā parā 'joh (RV I 185 1) " Which one of these two is earlier, which later?", Perhaps implying thereby that both hase emerged simgltaneously Both have also grown together ( sākamsrdhā, RV IX 683) Further, Dyāvāpribiyi are measured up and are found to be

similar in measurement ( sam mātrābhur mamire jemur uni, RV III 38 3) They are also represented as kissing the navel of the world together (RV I 185 5) The heaven and the earth are viewed as the two halves' (ubhāv ardhau bharatah sādhū asmai, RV II 27 15 )- they are like two bowls turned towards each other (mah camā samici, RY III 55 20 ) or like two wheels at the two ends of an axle (ak sene 'la cakrijā, RV X 89 4) or like dlısanäs or shells' (samicine dhuisane, RV X. 44 8, AV XX 94 8) Incidentally, these passages may be said to embody the Vedic poet's notions regarding the shape of the heaven and the earth The collaborative activity of Dyāvāprthivi is suggested by the statement that the rains (from the heaven) stimulate the earth and the fires (presumably the ritual fires from the earth ) the heaven bhumim parjanja jinvanti, dnam jimanty agnayah (RV I 164 51 ) 36 The rains are described as the springs of the heaven ( divah utsåh, RV V 57 1) 37 
Dyaus by itself does not play any important role in the Rgseda - as a matter of fact, not a single hymo is addressed to Dyaus exclusively The only important feature of the mythology relating to Dyaus is his cosmic fatherhood, though, strangely enough, in about twenty Rgvedic passages, the word djaus occurs as a feminine noun It may be recalled that, even as the cosmic father Dyaus has not been elevated to the same exalted position as his other Jodo-European counterparts like Zeus and Jupiter ** Generally, functions of only a secondary character are seen to have been attributed to him The Ravedic poets seem to have thought of Dyaus as not being static but as moving in its course, ** and also as having boundaries 40 The Võjasaneyl-Samutā (862)

Four points of cosmographical significance emerge from the Rgredic-Atharvasedic descriptions of djous Firstly, the associa tion of dj aus with light and resplendence becomes evident from the termo dzaus itself It is again obviously with reference to this very characteristic that Indra is mentioned as fastefing the rūpa ‘formn' on djaust? or that djaus is said to unfold its form. Secondly, the shape of djous is indicated in a passage in the Atharraseda (X 8 9) which implicitly refers to it as a goblet with its mouth below and bottom upwards (tiragbılaś camasa urdhrabudhnah) Thirdly, the position of dy aus is said to be far away and at a great height It Is, for instance, suggested that dj aus ly the roof of the world held up without beams (aramse dyām astabhājad brhantam, RV I 15 2) At the same time, Vedic poets speak of de aus as havjag been supported with props As the supporters of dy aus are variously mentioned, among others, Indra," Rsabha,47 Savitr,4% and A. Frequently referen ofs are also made to sānu, 50 prstha,2 mrürdlian, sumont, 'pinnacle' of dy aus, as also to the climbing up to dy aus 5 Other termes used in similar contexts are paráraták and ristapa.

According to him, both in the Veda and the Avesta, the heaven was conceived as a great stone building filled with light, through whose doors and windows that light shone upon men 10 the form of the sun and the stars 57 of course, there is very little evidence available in the Rgveda to support this view It is also said that the gods Maruts live in dyaus 68 It is perhaps also the Maruts who, in another passage (RV VI 2 11), are referred to as the heroes of dy aus 
The fourth point of cosmographical significance is more note worthy Besides the notion of the three heavens mentioned above, the Rgreda also seems to have the notion of a threefold division of dy aus, pamely, uttama 'highest,' madhyama'middlemost, god avama 'lowest ', (jad uitame maruto madhyame vă vad jā 'vame subhagāso do stha, RV V 60 6) A passage in the Atharvaveda speaks of the aiamā djaus as being rich in water, the madhyamna dyaus as being rich in pilu, and the third or the highest dyaus (pradjaus) as the place where the fathers dwell (udan ati dyaur aramā pīlumati 't1 madhyamā, irtijā ha pradyaur iti pasjām pitara asore, AV XVIII 2 48) The meaning of pilu, in this context, is uncertain "The commentator understands the word in the sepse of stars '68 Compared to the mention of a threefold heaven, that of the three heavens is more common In one passage, it is specifically stated that two of the heavens copstitute the Jap of Savity, while one is in Yama's world (tisro dāvah, savitur dā upastha, ekā samasya bhuvane virāsāt, RV I 35 6) The exact intention of this passage is not quite clear One thing, however, seems certain, namely, that the suggestione that the passage refers to the lowest heaven, which belongs to Yama and which is the ultimate destination of sacrificers, etc, the middle heaven which

belongs to Savitr and Sūrya and which accommodates the Rbhus and the Maruts, and the highest heaven which belongs to Visoo, is obviously unacceptable 
There is only one short hymn (consisting of only three stanzas ) in the Rgreda (V 84 ) which celebrates Pithivi. In the Atharvaveda also there is only one hymn to Prthivi (XII 1), but it is very much longer (it consists of sixty-three stanzas) and far more significant than the Rgvedic hymn What strikes one most about the Atharvavedic Pithivi-Sukta 1) that it does not contain mere conventional mytho-poetic cliches or any remote mystic allusions. Through it, the poet seeks to make us feel the direct impact of this concrete tangible earth, on which we live, as acutely as he himself has felt it He speaks, in a purely pragma tic mazoer, of the vital relationship of the visible earth with man. The hymn describes in detail and in a transparent language the physical features of the earth, its extraordinary bounty, its moral ethical foundations, its mythological-ntoal coorections, and above all, its character as the great integrator of the human community Both these hynas clearly show that, in the Veda, Prthivi is more important as locality than as a divinity It is only in a few rare passages, soch as, RV I 115 6 and IV 3.5 (where Prthivi s mentioned along with Mitra, Varuna, Agri, Aditi, etc) and RV II 54 19 (where she is apparently included among Vsre Devāl), that Prthivi is referred to-agd that too, oaly by implication - as a goddess. BAILEY suggests at that the cult of the earth, associa ted with the sky as a productive pair, is of the earlier type of maythopoeia attested in Indo-European languages, and is bedded in a stratum far earlier than the personalised oecarchia of Indra, Visau, etc Vittore PISANI also speaks of an Indo-Germanic earth-goddess However, in the Rgveda, we can hardly trace any cult of the earth as such.67

Attention has already been drawn to the various Vedic words denoting the earth and their significance The earth is, naturally enough, thought of as "this loka" as against suhrtām loka, trliyam nāka, irtijam jjonih,64 or as against parama loka, 65 or as against 
yonder loka *66 The earth is thus distinguished from the other lokas or worlds both from the cosmographical and the ethical. eschatological points of view As for the yonder world, a reference may be incidentally made to the suggestion that the conception of the yonder world as an inverted world where every thing of this world is turned into its opposite is reflected in the legend of Bbsgu's visit to that world ($PBF XI 61, JBr I 42-44) Of course, that legend does not seem to have any ethical sigo ficance 
In the beginning the earth is believed to have existed in the form of water upon the ocean of space' (yâ 'rnave 'dhu sallam agra åsit, AV XII I 8) The wise discovered it by means of their miraculous powers The earth is sometimes viewed, presu mably on account of its position, as the foundation ( dharuna) for the universe 68 It is also pointed out that this earth is the uppermost among the three earths (imā jās tusrah prthivis tāsām ha bhūmir utlanā, AV VI 21 1) The easth is described as caturbhrstid four-cornered' and eight peaked 70 As a matter of fact, on the basis of this latter passage which reads, astau vy akhyar kahubhah prihivyās tri dhanva yojanā sapta sindhūn, it is suggested that the earth has eight mountains, three continents," and seven streams The earth is further said to be made up of four quadrants (pradısah )72 and to have seven forms ( dhamani) "

The Atharvavedic poet further goes on to say that it was on the earth that the gods overcame the Asuras and man's ancestors unfolded themselves (jasjām pūrve pūrvajanā u cakrire, jasyām devă asuran abhy avartavan, AV XII 1 5) Asyinau measured the earth, Visnu bestrode it, and Indra, vanquishing the Dasyus, lorded over it (10, 37) The earth is also said to make the sacrificial ritual possible (jasjâm sado haurdhāne jūpo yasyām ni mijate, AV XII 1 38 ) 
The earth, Vanquishing the Dasy:

Finally, the earth is rightly glorified as the essential basis of the life of the human community It is the great gathering place affording full scope to the vigorous activity (18) of man and his varjous organizations such as grāma pranja, sablo, somgrāma, and samuti (56) What is, however, particularly remarkable is that the earth is thoroughly impartial and equally supports all kinds of men - foolish as well as weighty or respectable, good as well as evil ( malam bibhrati gurubhrd bhadrapapasya mdhanam Intık suh, AV XII 1 48) It also integrates people practising different religious rites and speaking different languages (janam bibhrati bahudhā rālasam nānādharmanam, AV XII 1 45) A Rgvedic passage (1 72 9 ) seerns to imply that the earth severed its connections with the gods in order to be able to be more closely associated with men 
The third of the normal Vedic world-trad, namely, the midregion, does not figure in the Rgveda with any prominence 
The two words which commonly denote the midregion, namely, antarih sa and rajas ( 10 singular), have been already discussed It has also been pomted out that no clear evidence is available 18 the Rgieda to suppart the assumption of rajas beneath the earth

to account for the sun's course dundg the night. The statement that, 10 the primordial condition, there was to rajas (răsid rajah, RV X 129 1 ) presumably refers to the situation when the heaven and the earth were still joued together That the poet should add, in the same passage, that, at that time, there was also to rjoman (=that hich has been separated or beld apart, that us, the heaven ) nould thus seem sigolfcant For, Indra is credited with having measured out antariksa by separating prthivi and dj ou 9 The entire process of the orgination of prthiri, rajas, and djaus out of the primeval ovan is indicated in RV X 149 2 ato bhur ata ă utihitam rajo 'to digiõprthiri oprathetām It may be noted that the context makes it necessary to understand dj cus for dyöräprther in this passage In set of the cosmographical position of antanksa, it is understandable that the gods are described as moving through the midregion 57 In another signifi cant passage ( RV X 149 1), Sauts, who actually represents but an aspect of Asura Varupa, e' is said to have calmed down the faltering earth by means of mets, fastened the heaven in the supportless space, and milked the artariksa which neghed like a horse sarita jantraih prthirim aramnād askambhane saritā djām adrmhar, asram rrã 'dhuksad dhunim antariksam atūrte baddhom sarila samudram This last activity evidently refers to the pheno menon of rain fallng from the midregion Overspread with throdering clouds It is, howeser, not unlikely, that it refers to the gushung forth of the primeral waters Ode may also note that, in this passage, antariksa is compared to a sea sustained in

another passage, antarik sa is, on the one hand, differentiated from prthivi, while, on the other, it is brought into specially close contact with dy aus prihni nal pārtināt päty amhaso 'ntarik sam dngar pānı asmān (RV VII 104 23 ) 
It is only rarely that antariksa is referred to, even by impli cation, as a divinity as such In RV III 54, like Prthivi, Antariksa also is included among the Viśve Devūh (st 19) But there is an interesting, though rather obscure, hymn in the Athariaveda (1 32 ) which seems to glorify antarılsa in a special way The theme of that hymn may as well be said to be the “apotheosis of antariksa " The poet begins by proclaiming that a great mystery is going to be pronounced (mahad brahma sadisj ate I read 
adisyafe for vadisyatı occurring in the Shupaka text ), namely, that what makes the plants breathe is not on the earth nor in the heaven' na tat prihvyām no dm Jena pránantı virudhah, it is thereby implied that it is in the antariksa (1) The midregion (I read antariksam for antarikse ) is the station of those (life giving potences ) - it is the foundation of all being (asja bhitasya asthānanı) (2) When the two trembling worlds - namely, the heaven and the earth, while being separated from each other - fashioned out the third world, namely, the antariksa, the latter was all watery even as the streams of the sea (3) jad rodasi rejamāne bhūmım (I read bhimm for blūmuh) ca pur arah salam, ārdram tad adja sarvadā samudrasje 'va srotjah It may be recalled that the midregion is often regarded as a celestial oceap This pervading space, that is, antariksa, has, as it were, pepetrated into the one that is, dyaus ) - It is supported upon the other (that 15, prihv) (4) visvam anjām abhi 'sa 'ra rad anyaszám adhifri tam The significance of this hymn from the point of view of cosmogony-cosmography needs to be adequately appreciated 

## Lecture 3 
Today, I should like to begin with a brief excursus on the cosmological-cosmographical speculations of the Brahmana-texts It is said that, when speculation is once set going in the Brāhma. nas, the result of its treod is to lead its followers in an intellectual chaos. This is no doubt a rather harsh indictrcent, but it cannot be said to be altogether upwarranted We have seen that, broadly speaking, three main trends of cosmogonical thought are evident in the early Veda, namely, (1) beginning with a mytho logical figure, (2) beginning with some material praciple, and (3) beginning with some abstract principle AU these three trends are reflected in the Brahmanas but with this noteworthy difference (a) There is a greater emphasis on a single Personal Creator or a more patently cothropomorphic All-God, namely, Prajapati, as being the priocipal character in the cosmogonic drama, (b) the other two trends, namely, of a material principle and an abstract prociple being the starting points of the cosmo gopical process are organically mingled with the basic Praăpatr legend, and (c) all these trends are eventually given a distinct ntualistic onentation It must, however, be conceded that the cosmogonical legends in the Brāhmanas, by and large, tend to confirm the dictum that mythology is a kind of primitsye mctaphysics 
Though, as has been pointed out, there is, to the Brāhmanos, an unambiguous stress on abat may be called the personalistic theones of creation there is still no suggestion of the creator having any motive or design for creation He is hardly ever represented as erecuting any deliberate plan. It often seems as if the creator is moved primarily by a desire to allow an outlet to the exuberance of hus energy-by an impulse to moltiply tumself The wbole vanverse thus becomes just a manfestation of some

effusive force Incidentally, it is this attitude which later deve loped into the doctrine that the universe represents but the nila kawalyam 
The most typical cosmogonical myth of the Brahmanas has Prajāpati as its central figure SO 'yam purusah prajāpalır akāmajata | bhūyant sjām prajāzeye 'ill so 'frāmjata sa tapo "apyata / sah sräntas tepano brahmai "va prathamam asrjata trayım eva vidjām sai à 'smai pratistha 'bhavat tasyām pratisthāyām pratisthito 'rapyata / so 'po 'srjata vāca eva / so 'kämajata/ abhyo dolyo 'dhi prajāycje 'ri/ so 'nayā tray vidjajā sahā 'pah prāvsat / tata andam sam avartala / tad abhy amrsad astv ity astu bhūyo 'sh aty eva tad abravitatha yo garbho Intarā 'sit so 'grir asrjjata (Šatapatha-Br VI 1 1 8 ff) "Now this Person Prajāpatı desired, 'May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced' He toiled, he practised austerity Being worn out with toil and austerity, be created first of all the Brahman, the triple science it became to him a foundation Resting on that foundation, he (again ) practised austerity He created the waters out of Vāk He desired, “May I be reproduced from these waters' He entered the waters with that triple science Thence an egg arose He touched it “Let it exist, let it exist and multiply', so he said Now the embryo which was inside was created as agri " And so the process continues with Agni Pfthvi etc 
There are several variations of this basic theme, some features of the other cosmogonical trends, mentioned above, being integra ted with it Thus, for instance, according to SPBr XI 5 8, Prajāpati, who was alone in the beginning, desired, May I exist, may I be generated', practised penance, and eventually created the three worlds, namely, the earth, the antariksa, and the heaven He heated these three worlds, and from them, thus heated, respectively three lights were produced - Agni, Vayu, and Surya

From these lights were produced the three Vedas, and from these latter, thuh, Bhuvah, and svak And this legend is then set lato the framework of the discussion about a sacrificial procedure. Auf Br V.32 has a more or less similar legend, prajapatır akāmajata prajázeja bhujan sjām i1l/ sa tapo 'rapjata / sa tapas toptre 'măl lokān asrjata prtham antariksamt dram/ tål lokån abhy atapat, rebhyo 'bhitaptebhjes inni joriy ajāJanta etc. All this occurs in the context of the Agnihotra and the duties of the Brahman priest lo another version occurring in SPBT VOI 4 3, Prazpatı is said to have sought the help of the Pränas m having his desire to procreate fulfilled The Artarej a-Aranjaka I. I 8 speaks of the Purosa creatrag, by bus speech, etc, the earth with fire, etc 
Sometimes, waters are represented as having preceded Praja pati (ŚPB. XI 161 ff) ipo ha vā idam agre sallam era 'sa tā akāmayonla kathar nu projájemahi '11 / 1ā aframjams tās tapo lapjanta / tasu lapas tapjarānāsu hıranjam ändam sam babhūra. In a year's tude, a man, this Prajāpat, was produced therefrom. He broke opeo this golden egg There was then, indeed, do resting place, only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as loog as the space of a year At the end of a year he tried to speak. He said bhūh-this became the earth, he said bhurah this became antariksa, he said soh-this became the heaven We are then fortber told sa ( = prajāpatır) átmany era prajtim adhatla / sa asgerai 'sa deran asrjata atha jo "Jam aran pränah / tena 'suran asrjata The Tautinija-Samhitā also has the legend of the waters and the cosmic egg 
Besides a material principle, which is almost invariably the waters, abstract principles also are mentioned as the starting points of the creation process ID SPB, VI 1 1 1, asat us saxd to have been there in the beginning asad rá idam agre ist The question is then asked.

able to generate with those seved separate persons They, therefore, thought, and etān sapta purusan ekam purusam ahurvan The one Person so formed out of the seven persons was Prajāpati And, thereafter, it was Prajāpati who took the lead in creating the uni verse According to the Taittiriya-Brāhniana (II 2 9), the succes sive elements in the cosmogonic process are asat, hāma or desire, tapas, and creation in connection with which the urinary bladder of Prajāpati is said to have been the origin of the ocean Another passage from the SPBr (X 5 3) takes its cue from the famous Násadiya-Sukta It says ne 'va iā dam agre 'sad asin ne 'sa sad äsit/ asid na lā idam agre ne'a'sit/ tadd ha tan mand era 'sa This mind wished to become manifest, to become more defined (niruk tataram), more substantial ( mūrlataram ) We also come across (SPBr XI 2 3) the brahman, which, as the first principle, created the gods And, having created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds - Ago this world Vāyu the antariksa, and Sürya the heaven The further part of this passage is particularly interesting from the point of view of cosmography or the structure of the universe For, it goes on to say And the deities who are above these three, pamely, Agal, Vāyu, and Surya, the brahman made ascend the worlds which are above these three worlds, namely, Prthivi Antariksa, and Dyaus And, indeed, just as these three latter worlds and these three deities are manifest, so too are those higher worlds and the deities, who ascended those worlds, manifest Then the brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond atha brahmar 'ja parārdham agacchat 
As for the number of lokas or worlds, the Brāhmana-texts are by no means unanimous While they generally speak of the tripartite universe consistiog of Prthivi, Antariksa, and Dyaus, they also contain other enumerations It, however, needs to be remembered that these different enumerations have very little or do cosmographical significance They are not intended to illumine the view of the Brāhmanas regarding the plan and structure of the universe, they are given mainly in order that they should conform to the ritualistic contexts in which they occur Thus, even the pormal tripartite universe is sometimes interpreted (TBr III

81, JB I 154) as being made up of Pitrloka, Deyaloka, and Manusyaloka. Sicularly, while explaining why there have to be two Yedis in the Sautrāmadī, the ŚPB(XII 7.3 7 ) says drau tāra lakar it) Zhur deralolos cai 're pitrlokas ce According to the Attarej a-Arangala (II 4 1), there are four lokas, namely, arblas (which signifies the waters above the heaven), marici (lights or the Djaus), mara (the abode of the mortals that is, the earth), and åpah (waters under the earth) The mention of the earth as mara is specially poteworthy and would remind onc of what has been already said about the word ksam In connec tion with the Perusamedha, the SPBr (XIII 613 ) mentions the three lokas, namely, Prithivi, Antanksa, and Djaus, and the Duah, and adds erarod idam sarran (that is, presonably, the universe) Järad inte ca lokā disasca Reference has already been made to the sad utrih, the six wide opes, mentioned in that Brahmana Elsewhere that Brāhmana (XI 6 3 6) speaks of the universe as having been constituted of eight worlds, which are related to the cight Vasus, namely, Agni, Prthivi, Vāya, Antariksa, Aditya, Dyaus, Candramas, and Maksatrānu 
But the references, which are particularly interesting from the point of view of the evolution of the Hindu cosmography, are those to the seven lokas For, it is these references, which, in a sense, may be said to mark the transition from the Vedic cosmography (which is generally influenced by the number 'three to the classical Paurānic cosmography (which clearly shows the influence of the number 'seven) The ŚPBr (LX 5 2. 8) speaks of the selen worlds of gods merely to make them correspood with a fitualistic detail, camely, the employment of the hymn of seven Ferses in connection with the puling up of the fire-altar saplarcam bharati/ saplacitko 'gnih sapta 'rtarah sapta disah sapla dera lokāk, etc. The Kausitakr-Brāhmana ( 20 1 ) is more specific. It narrates how the gods, molated on the wheel of the year, moved round the seven lokas, namely, the Deva-Petr-loka, the Agnu-loka or the Rtadhāma, the Vayu loka or ibe Aparajita (incidentally, it is sometimes suggested that Aparājita decotes the Dyuloka), the Indra-loka or the Adbıdıy, the Varuda-loka or the Pradiv, the 
184 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
Mrtyu-loka or the Rocana, and the Brahmano Loka Altogether, this passage has an unmistakable Paurānic ring More note worthy, however, is the passage in the Tarttırıya-Arany aka (* 10 1 ) which speaks of the seven worlds, seven oceans, and seven mountains In another passage (X 27 28 ), it actually gives the names of the seven worlds, while in a third (1 7 1,3), it even mentions the Mahāmeru Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, in the context of the adding of fuel to the sacred fires, etc, the PBY (XI 6 8–10 ) alludes to sanasparīnam lokah, pašū. nām lokah, osadhinām lokal, and apăm lokah, which is reminiscent of the epic-Pauranic eschatology The significance of the plura. lity of lokas, from the point of view of the doctrine of salvation, seems to have been suggested in the Jaimnija-Brähmana (III 341 ff ) which tells us how Prajāpati created the gods, how he wanted to elude them, how, therefore, he went from one loka to another, how he stationed the various gods in those lokas, and how, finally, he united all those lokas into one, called nāka or Siarga or bradlımasya vistapa It becomes clear from this passage that the different lokas of the different gods are but partial aspects of the true heaven In this very context may be mentioned the commentary of the SPBT (VI 3 1 17) on the verse in the Vājasaneyr-Samhitā (115), senyantu visie amrlasja putrā , je dhāmānı divyāni tasthuh The amrla or the immortal one, verily, is Prajāpatı, his sons are all gods, and the heavenly abodes are these worlds 
Speaking of the universe as a whole, the SPBT (XI11 22 13) says that it consists of sixteen parts (sodasokalam và idam sariom) As a matter of fact, this division into sixteen parts 15 applied also to man and the animal The lokas or the worlds are believed to have been founded on the waters and to have been linked with the sup by means of the quarters apsu hi 'me loka pratisthitah aditve hi me loka digblur ásakráh (SPB, VI 7 1 17) It has been further pointed out that the earth is stabilised by taeans of the mountains and rivers, the antarıksa by means of the birds and marici, and the heaven by means of the clouds and the stars (SPBr XI $ 1 2) Elsewhere the entire universe 15

described as resting on Dyáv prthiri tad ābhjām djárāpnik bham arcbkare rajor dam sarram edat (SPB, II I 3 26). 
The Kānra-SPBr (IV 5 2 13), botrever, says that there is pothing beyond Dyirāprthuvi. 
A reference has already been made to the Vedic beuef that the heaven and the earth were ongially joined together The Brāhmanas also reiterate that belief The ŚPBT (1 41 22), indeed, says this of all the worlds.semantiham ira ha to me 'gre lokā ēsu if umsj a hat ira dicur asa "lo the beginning, these worlds were well-nigh coauguons to one another, at that time one could touch the heaven thas” But, more specifically about the heaven and the earth, that Brõhmara (VII 1 223) says: saka har 're rich agre lolar asatah, but, in the course of the crea t100-process djäräsrthri anant the heaven and the earth went asunder (SPB, VUI 4 316) Acd, when they parted asunder, the space, which was between them, became the antariksa saha hat 're 'mör agre lokas äsatus (ajor rijator jo 'riarenā "läsa änt tad Antarik som obharat (SPBr, VI 1.223) The Autareje-Brālmana (IV 27 ) adds that, after the separation of the beased and the earth from each other, there was neither ram por sunshine. The fie peoples ( panca janah) fell apart. But, eventually, the gods brought about general reconciliation through the mamae of Dyaus and Prthivi The Tailtrija-Brähmara (1 1 3 2), how crer, has a different, and a more ntual-oriented, Version It says The bearen and the earth frere originally close together On belog separated they said to each other, “Let there be a common 52crifiqat essecce (gjim) for us " What sacrificial essere There was belonging to the yonder world, that is the beaven, that it bestowed on this earth, that became the salty grounds (on the earth) And what sacrificial essence there was belonging to this eartb, that it bestowed on the sonder world, that became the black spots in the moon Honcret, perhaps more zlominating ihan the above-quoted references to the wutual relationship between the heaven and the earth is the Brahmano-passage, which characterises the two worlds as retahsicau, seed-shedders. It says Seed-shedders, venly, are these two worlds-thus terrestri) Forld 
186 
INSIGHIS INTO HINDUISM 
sheds seed upwards from here in the form of smoke, it becomes rain in the yonder world, and that rain the yonder world sheds from above (SPBVII 4 2 22) Incidentally, it is interesting to note that, in another context, the Altareja Brāhmana (11 17) mentions that the heavenly world is at a distance of about 1000 days' travelling on horseback from here, that is, the earth sala sram anucjan siargakāmasya sahasråśvine vā stah syargo lokah 
As for the shape of Dyaus and Ppthivi, they are said to be round parimandalau hī 'mau lokau (ŚPBr VI 7 1 26) Elsewhese (SPB VII 51 iff ), the universe is compared to a Tortoise ( sa csa (Lūrmah) ima eja lokah) The lower shell of it (adharam hapălam) is this terrestrial world, and the upper shell of it is the yonder heaven For, the yonder heaven has its ends, as it were, bent down (varagrhītāntā djauh) And what is between the shells is antariksa The cosmographical signifi cance of this passage is unmistakable The Brāhmanas also speak of the heaven and the earth as having been properly fitted into each other (cf ŠPB, VIII 7 1 6) 
In the Brālimanas, Dyaus is clearly distinguished from Svarga Broadly speaking, the concept of Svarga is eschatologi cal, while that of Dyaus remains essentially cosmogonical-cosmo graphical Svarga is invariably regarded as the ultimate goal of the sacrificial ritual (siargakamah jajeta) It would also seem that, as a cosmographical region, Svarga was roughly identified with nāka (ŠPBVIII S 34), which was described as dnah Irtiyam rocanam prstham the third luminous back of the heaven ( SPBr VIII 63 19) In the lausītakı-Brāhmana (21 4, 26 17), Dyaus is said to be the symbol - the visible symbol - of Svarga I may, however, add that, in the foregoing discussion about the Brāhmana-view of the upiverse, I have always rendered the word dj aus by heaven' As a matter of fact, I have concen trated on Dyaus more or less ignoring Svarga 
The Brälmanas have something interesting to say about the origin of Dyaus with a desire to multiply, Prapatı, by means of Vāyu, entered into union with Antariksa, thence an 488 arosc

From it, yonder Aditya was created. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became the sunbeams (rasnayah), and that which was the shell became Dydus Similarly, out of the union betreed Ādiga and Dyaus sere produced the moon, the inter med.ate quarters, and the chief quarters ($PBT VI 1 2.3-4) Elsen bere Br VI 525), Adityas are said to have fashioned Dyans Dyaus is golden harını a dyguh (SPB, XIV 1.3 29) The close connection betreen Dyaus and waters is suggested in various ways Dyzus is described as the seat of waters (apām sadanan, ŚPBr VII 5 2 56) or waters are some times even identified with Dyaus ( õpo roi djauh, SPB, VI 419) Commenting on the Vajasare, i-Samhita (23 53 ), the SPB, characterises Djaus as pūrvacsit or the first conception. An loteresting passage in the Parcarimsa-Brähmana (20 16 7) seems to suggest the superionty of Prthuvi to Dsaus, for, as it points out, the cattle do not procreate 10 the sonder world. One is here reminded of the lies that the earth is ever the bestower of new life, while the heaven is unfruitful - merely a brilliant culmination 
The Brahmanas seem to suggest that the earth was ongoally jo a fard state, and that, eveptually, it was solidified through some kind of coagulatory process. The Adivarāha or the cosmo goric boar is said to have agitated the pameval waters and to have brought up some mod from the bottom of those waters It was this mud which became the beginning of the earth (USI 6 3) The Adivarāba is obviously to be identibed with Prajāpap, and presumably also with the sükara mentioned in the Atharyn eda (II 27 2, Y 14 1), and the vară: of the Aresta The Taittira. Brahmana (I. 1 3 5-6) presents a slightly different rersion of the myth. According to it, nothing was to be seen in the begionlag except water and a fotos-leaf stapdıog out above it Prabpan (being beot on creating the firm ground) bethought binsell that the lotus-stalk must be restrog on something, and, har mg assumed the form of a boar, he drved and brought up some of the mud This he spread out (prach) on the lotus leaf, whence ongidated the earth (prthii) The ŠPBr. (XIV 1 2 II) points 
188 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
out that the earth was, in the beginning, of the size of a span (prādešamāırī), that a boar called Emūsa raised her up, and that this boar was her lord Prajāpati The Arrareja-Brāhmana says that the earth is round and supportless, but the SPBr (VI 1 2.29) speals of her being caluh-sraltı (four-cornered) and higher than the waters (ajam vai lolah adbhy ah utarah, XIV 3 1 28) This latter Brālmana also speaks (III 5 1 31 ) of this earth and the other two beyond it (imām, dhe asjäh pare). Finally, from the ritualistic point of view, Prthivi is characterised as one syllable of Gāyatri (SPBF VI 5 1 12) and as the great vessel ( mohad alapanam, SPB, XII 2 6 13 ) 
All these cosmogonical cosmographical details from the Brahmana texts must, however, be regarded as being, 10 a sense, but minor and incidental For, the most fundamental concept of the Brāhmadic cosmogony is that of the essed 131 bond between sacrifice and the world-process A reference has already been made to the pan-asuism of the Veda As a part of this pan-asuistic ideology, the Vedic poet-priests be lieved that the essential magic potence inhering withio & person or a thiog could be either augmented or diminished or transferred from one person or thing to another person or thing by means of the magically potent mantras and practices - in other words, by means of the sacrificial ritual The true significance of the magical practices of the Athana eda and the ritual practices of the Brahnanas, indeed, rests on this belief from the point of view of the subject with which we are now concerned, namely, the universe in Vedic thought, it may be pointed out that the magical potence, asu, in the universe dwindles, on account of onc reason or another (Prappati's creative or procreative functions are said to have drained bus poners), and that, as a result of this, the entire cosmic process is seriously jeopardized Uoder such circumstances the magical potence in the universe is augmented by means of the sacrificial ritual, and the cosmic process is thereby revived For instance, on the basis of a critical analysis of the Rājasūya, it has been shown that that sacrifice was an 20

qually repeated rite iateaded for cosmic regeneration and rebirth. It was an abridged representation of the upcoding cyclical process of decay and regeneration The Vedic rtualists claimed that whateret was symbolically performed in a secrifice actually happened in the world-process Sacrifice can be aptly compared to a clockwork huch had to be lered up in order that the world should be kept goig 
Another important doctrine, which developed out of this philosophy of sacrifice, has that of the close corresponderce between macrocosm and microcosm It », indeed, on the bas13 of this doctrine that the Brühm.ing-authors set many of their important ideas into the framework of the five "correspondency (poccasu adhikaronesu) 
As has been indicated earlier, the various lokas or worlds can be considered from three main points of vet, aamel, (1) 29 so many regions of the ponerse, (2) as the special abodes of parti cular gods, and (3) as rewards for meritorious deeds ( or punish ments for sias) In popolar Hiadu thought, these three points of view are seen to have been actually combined to make op a single religious complex. The Vedic pcets, on the other fund, do pot seem to have established any definite correlation between their cosmography and eschatology Popular Hinduism may be said to be rather excessively obsessed by the ideas of after-life and

However, attention needs to be drawn to a few siguificant points in this conpection Firstly, the earth itself seems to have been regarded as the last resting place of man At the time of the interment of the bones of the dead man, he is asked to "crouch towards this mother earth, the spacious and friendly earth", for, the young lady. soft as wool to the gler of dok sınā", will "guard you against the lap of nursi" (upa sarpa mātaram bhūmım etām urujacasain prihnim suścıām / ürnamradā swatir dal sināiara esa na pätu nirrtor upasthät // RVX 18 10) Prthivi, on her part, is implored to vault up (ucchiañcasra) and Dot to press him in (mā ni bādhathāh, RV X 18 11 ) The mrnmaja grha, mentioned in RV VII 89 1, seems to refer to a vault under the earth where the dead person is interred Onc may see in these references a cosmographical region having been somebow related to the post mortem condition of man The notions that the various constituents of the universe bave origina ted from the different limbs of the cosmic Purusa,' that there exists a close correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm, and that, therefore, the different limbs of a person go back after his death to the corresponding constituents of the universe, seem to form the ideological basis of such passages as RV X 16 3 Sūry ani cal sur facchafu tam imā djam ca gaccha prthuim ca dharmanā It must be added that the word dharmonā, in this context, has to be understood in the sense of * 10 accordance with the natural correspondence and not of in accordance with the religious merit" 
The Rgedic poets do speak of a land (or lands) of felicity where the god devoted people are described to be enjoying them selves (for instance, jatri naro dovajanto jugāni vitaniate prati bhadrāja bhadram, RVI 115 2, or naro jatra derajalo madanti, RV I 154 5) but they do so not necessarily in any eschatologal contexts Nor do they identify those lands with any cosmogra. phical regions A direct juxtaposition of the concept of the

world presided over by a particular god (which, however, is not sought to be identified with any cosmographical region) and the eschatological speculation is to be found 11 such passages as RV X 14 8 RVX 14 8 reads sam gacchasra pitrbhih sam jamene 'stapürfena parame ry oman/ hinajā 'radjam punar astam ehi sam gacchana tanya surarcáh (I would read surarcasă for suarcah) A critical study of this stanza would bring out the following signifi cant pouts After death, a person goes to the world of Yama. This world of Yama (jamaloka ) is also the world where the Pitars live (pitrblih jamena sam gacchana) In other words, the Jamaloka is identical with the putrloka 6 It is located to the lughest heaven (parame ronan) A person attajas to this world only as the result of his istápūria-of his acts of piety and chanty 
This world is, deed, mao's opin natural home ( asta) Before Teacbing there, a person leaves behind all that was reprehensible in him (aradjam hināja), and assumes a new resplendent form (surarcasa tanrā) it may be pointed out that this Rgvedic passage corresponds almost fully with AVVI 120 3, which reads zatrā suhārdah sukrio madanı vaja rogam tanrah srāyāh/ alonā angair ahrutah srarge tatra pašjema pitarau ca putrān. The most noteworthy difference between the tno passages, how ever, is that instead of the pantaloka implied in the Rgedic passage the Atharvavedic passage uaequnocally speaks of srarga The points of correspondence between the two passages are (RV) pitrbhih sam gacciasta (AV) pitarau ca putron pajjema, (RV) istāpūrtena (AV) sukrtah, (RY) arad, am hitrāja (AV) nājah tanah rogam rihaja and (RI) Surarcesā lanrā (AV) aslonah angazh ahrutah Incidentally it may be added here that, in another significant passage in the Rgreda

The Atharvaveda refers to sarga fairly frequently - and thus, in most cases, 10 aa eschatological sense Starga is often men tioned as a place of blissful existence (etās na dhārā upe yantu sarvah svarge loke madhumat pinvamānāh, upa nā tisthantu pus karınıh samantăh, AV IV 34 5, sjargā lokā amrtona visthāh, AV XVIII 4 4 Incidentally, in the only Rgvedic passage where the word svarga occurs, X 95 18, it is this very idea that 15 stressed), and as a place which one secures as a reward for one's meritorious deeds or for charity and sacrificial performance # But it is very rarely that svarga is cosmographically defined in very general terms, it is said to be located in the third vault of the heaven (trtiye nāke, AV XVIII 4 3 ) or on the heaven's ridge (näkasja prsthe, AV XVIII 4 4) or in the third heaven (trtiyam nākam, AV IX 5 1 )One thing, however, is often stressed, namely, the association of this land of bliss with light svar,19 Jyotis, Suci 12 Indeed, it is even suggested that, though the word svarga as such occurs in the Rgveda only once, the concept of sarga is sometimes alluded to in that Veda by such words as jyotis and svar 13 It is noteworthy that the Atharvaveda seems to be actually speaking of a plurality of svargas (svargāh lokäh, AV XVIII 4 4)-it mentions punyāh lokah on the earth, in the antariksa, and in the heaven, 14 verily immeasurable punjah lokah (aparımı

tāh punjah lokāh AV XV 13 10 More specifically, the Atharva veda refers to kaumāra loka (AV XII 3 47 BLOOMFIELD seems to understand the word nightly to denote the world to which one becomes entitled through the birth of a son, while GONDA takes it to imply that the heavenly world is the son produced by the ritual cooperation of the sacrificer and his wife's), to bhadrasa loka,' and (by implication ) to the loka from where one has agam to turn back (pre 'ra piponsatz manasă munur á vartate punah, AV XII 2 52) This last reference would remind one of the world of the moon, mentioned in later texts,18 which one attaids through one's punya but from which one has to return to the world of mortals after the full consumption of that punya 
Allusions in the Rgteda to heu as such are almost ni, and the notion in respect of it is noticeably vague But the idea that the singers and evil-doers are condemned to suffer in some distaal abyss occurs pot infrequently In one Rgedic passage (IV 5 5), for instance, the sinful, crooked, and potruthful are said to have prepared for themselves a gabhira pada, a deep station pāpasah santo and assiya idam padam ajangrā gabhram Sayada, 10 bis commentary on the passage, understands the phrase, gabhira pada as denotuag some infernal region or hell, GELDNER translates gabhira pada with 'geheimaisvolles Wort',"' but Sāyana's inter pretation seems to be confirmed by the unprecation in IV 5 148 (anáyudhasa i asarā sacantām) where the word asat is used more or less as a synonym of nurrt, which latter word also means perdi trog It may be, incidentally, pointed out, in this coctext, that, according to Y NORMAN BROWN," asar is the term by which heu is denoted in the Rgreda Hell represents just the opposite of the well-ordered world bich latter is denoted by the word sat Thus, hell is regarded as being similar to the primordial chaos Obviously, this view cannot be regarded as being supported by

Vedic evidence As for the word nirrti, another word which may be equated with it, namely, nirrtha, is actually used in the sense of perdition' in RV VII 104 14 It is noteworthy that the same root sac is employed with reference to asat in RVIV 5 14 and to nirrtha in RV VII 104 14 In another passage (RV IX 73 8), asā "justan udhyatı harte avratan, the word used is harta wluch means a cavity The Java ( RI'VII 104 3, 17) and the parśana (RV VII 104 5), into which the duskrtah21 and the demoness (RV VII 104 3, 17) and the atrınsa (RV VII 104 5) are to be thrust down, also imply black holes within the bowels of the earth It will be seen that these references are of a more or less conven tional character and do not suggest any specific cosmographical region The only point which seems to be suggested here is that, while the land of bliss, which is the destination of the meritorious Is "up above ", the hell or the purgatory (of course there are so definite words in the Rgreda to denote these places) is located “ down under" (cf11fasya jantor adhamas padista, RV VII 
104 16) Another point of contrast between the two is that, while the former is a realm of light, the latter implies anārambhana tanas ( RV VII 104 3), “bottomless darkness" (also cf må le drsant sūrjam uccarantami, RV VII 100 24) It is only in one solitary passage that the infernal region is described in cosmogra. phical terms In RI VII 104 11, Vasistha curses the person 'who seeks to harm him, that he sink down to the region lying beneath "all the three earths ” (tisrah prihıvır adho asiu visāh) This is also perhaps the only clear Rgvedic reference to what may be called the underworld', the concept relating to which plays a prominent role in popular Hindu cosmography and eschatology

"God is my arst thought, world may cext, and man my third and last ” In their religio-philosophical quest, the Hindu thinkers may be said to have travelled just the other way round. Their starting point was man But this did not result io their thought-compler becomwg anthropocentric They did not claim, like Protagoras, that man was the measure of all things Hindu ideology has always been essentially cosmic. It is said that the three ancient thought-world, had their respective watch Words The watchword of the ancient Vestero thought was “I” (aham), that of the ancient Chinese thought was "we" (rajam), and that of the apcient Indian thought was “alt (nfram) Hindu thiplers base no doubt thought of aham-bet they have thought of aham as "a part of masram" and not as "apart from risrom "
