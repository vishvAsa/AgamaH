title = "LITERATURE OF BRAHMANISM IN SANSKRIT"

+++
The Brahmanic religion, in its different phases, can boast of a vast and traditionally continuous literature, which concerns itself, directly or indirectly, with the various aspects of that religion An attempt will be made in this paper to present a connected historical account of this literature, from the age of the Veda down to about the end of the medieval period of course, on account of its decessary limitations, this survey will take into account only the more significant literary works, and, here too, special consideration will be given to such of these works as do not usually receive adequate treatment 
Speaking of the literature of Brahmanism, one has to begin with the Veda A mention may, first of all, be made of certain distinctive features of the Veda The term Veda' does pot denote any one siogle book-it denotes an entire literature, which is strikingly extensive from the points of view of chronology, geography, and authorship The composition of the various texts which are believed to constitute the Veda has spread over many centuries and over different localities and has to be ascribed to many generations of poets, priests, and philosophers But the ancient tradition in connection with the genesis of the Veda would not warrant the use of such words as composition', authorshp', etc, in respect of it For, it is traditionally claimed that the Veda is apauruseja - that is to say, do human agency is responsible for its creation The Veda has existed from times immemorial, and the activity of the various Rsis (Seers) 10 connection with it is restricted only to seeing' or discovering' it The claim of apaurusejarva made on behalf of the Veda has naturally given rise to another claim namely of reda prāmänja The Veda, being free from all the limitations and deficiencies usually associated

with human agency, possesses absolute validity in the field of knowledge 
The Veda has been transmitted from generation to generation through oral tradition It is called Sruti, because it was recited and beard', and not written and read 2 Though, as suggested above, the Veda signifies not any single specific text but a veri table library of texts, which are remarkably saned in form and content, there is Des ertheless a thread of logical development which runs through it and wbich thus bestows upon it a kind of distinc tire unity The Vedic literary history is usually divided into three main periods, namely, the Samhna-period, the Brāhmand period, and the Upanisad-period Broadly speaking, these periods represent a chronological as well as a logcal sequence Lastly, a reference may be made to another feature of the Veda which is important from the point of view of the literary history It concerns the emergence, 19 course of ume, of various Vedic takhis which have sponsored their own recensions of the different Vedic texts 
Before proceeding to a further consideration of the three periods of the Vedic literary history, one may clanfy a few points which have sometimes occasioned a wrong perspective Firstly, it needs to be pointed out that, side by side with the Vedic litera ture, there must have been produced in that age much other litera tore, which, however had cot been consolidated and given a fixed form in its early stages. It also needs to be remembered that not the whole of the literature produced in the Vedic tradition could have been preserved For, the oral transmission has its natural limitations And finally, the Veda can by no means be regarded as the only source of the cultural history of that epoch. 
Now to turn to the Vedic Samhitās There are four Sam huas, which are also commonly referred to as the four Vedas pamely, the Rgreda-Samhita, the Atharraveda-Samhitā, the Sama

veda-Samhita, and the Yajurveda-Samhita comprising the Krsna Yajurveda and the Sukla-Yajurveda The name Samhità (collec tion) necessarily presupposes a stage of stray and scattered mantras It may be assumed that the ancient ancestors of the Indo-European speaking peoples once had their common home 10 the North Kirghiz region in course of time, some tribes from among them migrated towards the South east and eventually settled down in the Balkh region There they developed a certain form of their original Indo-European language, which may be characterised as the proto-Aryan language and wbich may be regarded as the direct ancestor of the Vedic language They also developed a form of religion (proto-Aryan), which was, in many respects, a direct precursor of the Vedic religion In course of time there again occurred further migrations from Balkh Some tribes proceeded towards further South east and finally rea. ched Saptasındhu or the land of seven rivers These were the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans 3 
The religion of the Vedic Aryans may be said to have been mainly twofold On the one hand, they developed a cosmic religion (10 which such concepts as Dyāvā-Pithivi and Varuna-Rta played the most prominent role), a hero-religion (which was dominated by the personality of Indra ), an Agoi cult, a Soma-cult, etc This was the religious ideology of the classes within the community of the Vedic Aryans Coeval with this there was also the religious ideology of the masses', which was essentially magical 10 character The early Vedic poet-priests and magic priests composed mantras relatiog to both these types of religion The word mantra is, indeed, quite peculiar, for, it denotes, on the one hand, the prayers addressed to the various divinities of the mythological religion of the classes, and, on the other, the formulas and incantations connected with the magical religion of the masses This mantra producing activity presumably started

while the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans had still been in the region of Balkh, and continued during their journey to and early Sojom A Saptasındhu. 
The nomadic Vedic Aryans soon settled down in this new region, and there established their tribal dominions A sense of security and prosperity gradually gres among them One thing which they undertook to do in this new phase of their life was to collect, revise, add to, and systematically arrange their stray and scattered mantras relating to both the types of their religion Two great collections of mantras eventually resulted from this activity Broadly speaking, the martras connected with the religious ideo logy of the classes were brought together in one collection, which leter came to be called Rgreda-Samhıtā (or Rgreda), and the mantras connected with the religious ideology of the masses were brought together in another collection, which came to be called Atharraveda-Samhita (or Atharrareda ) Verily, these two alone are the primary Samhilas The æntral theme of the Rgreda may be said to be mythology, and that of the Atharrareda to be magic 
The Rgreda-Samhitā which has come down to us belongs to the Sakala Sakhả It consists of 1028 süktas or hymas (includ ung the elesen Valakhilya-hymns) These hymns, which are made op of a varying pumber of mantras in the form of rks or metri cal stanzas, are distributed in ten books called mandalas The formation of the mandalas is governed mainly by the principle of the homogeneity of authorship Among the classes of the Vedic Aryans certain families had already acquired some measure of SOcto-religious importance The mantras or hymns, which the progenitor and the members of any of these families claimed to have seen' were collected in the book of that family The nucleus of the Rgyeda is formed of six such family-books, namely, mondulus two to seven, which are respectively 35c7ibed to the families of Grtsamada, Vbvāmitra, Vāmadeva, Ati, Bharadváp, and Vasistha The eighth mandala largely belongs to the Kanvas, while the first mandala represents a collection of what may be called miniature mandalas The Dipth mandala is goseraed by 
324 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
the principle not of the homogeneity of authorship but of the homogeneity of subject matter All the sūktas in that mandala relate to Soma The tenth mandala ( which has the same number of hymns as the first mandala, pamely, 191 ) is a kiod of mis cellaneous collection of big and small sūktas Within a family book, the sūklas are arranged according to the subject-matter That is to say, the sūktas are grouped together according to the divinities to whom they relate, and then these Devath-groups are arranged in some set order within a Devatā-group, again, the sūktas are normally arranged in the descending order of the number of their stanzas The other kind of the arrangement of the Rgveda, according to which the whole collection is divided into ,eight astakas, each astaha into eight adhyayas, and each adhjāja into about thirty three vargas consisting of about five stanzas each, is obviously mechanical and is intended to serve the practical purpose of Vedic study 
Tradition requires that, before starting the study of any sūkta, one should know four items about it, namely, Rsi (authorship), Devatā (subject matter ), chandas (metre), and viniyoga (ritualistic application) This last item is evidently an after-thought The mandala arrangement of the Rgveda clearly indicates that this Samlıtā is not at all ritual oriented It also becomes clear that the various hymns were not composed with any elaborate sacrificial ritual in view As will be pointed out 10 the sequel, the ritualistic purpose was superimposed on them in & later period 
The majority of the suktas in the Rgveda are of the nature of prayers addressed to different dividities usually on the back ground of the description of the various exploits and achievements of those divinities The poets of the Rgveda po doubt show themselves to be conscious artists who not unoften employ various stylistic and thetorical devices But the purpose of these latter is to enhance the magical efficacy rather than the poetic beauty of their mantras Their prayers thereby become compelling invocations to the divinities for the fulfilment of their earnest longings which usually concern a happy, secure, prosperous, domestic life in this

world Apart from such prayers and mythology, we do get in some siktas of the Rgreda intimations of the further develop ment of the Vedic thought in thdoections of ntualism and philosophical speculation. In connection with this Latter, a special mention deserves to be made of the Huranj asarbha-sūkia (X-121 ), the Purusa-szkla (X-90), and the Visadiya-sikta (X-129) 
In contrast to the Rgreda, the Atharsareda, which is aptly characterised as the * Veda of the masses", is an essentially heterogeneous collection The mythology of the Rgreda tends to become repetitie, confectional, and stereotyped, while the magic of the Atharrareda manifests itself in ever nester forms The Athartareda is free from all sophistication, its contents do not reflect any inigence of pnestly hierarchy This Veda concerns itself mostly with the every day-ufe of the common man, from the prenatal up to the post-mortem condition - portraying that ufe with all its light and shade, ard hughlighting the generally obscure human emotions and relations Verily, there is an aura of my stery and unetpectedness about it. The interest of the Atharra seda is varied and its impact irresisuble 
A distinctive feature of the Atharrareda is the large number of names by which it has been traditionally known. All these names are significant, and together give a full idea of the nature, extent, and contents of this Veda The name Athartăngurasah (an abbreviated form of which, namely Atharraveda, came, la course of time, to be most commonly used) 15 for instance, indicative of the twofold character of the Athar anic magic-the wholesome, auspicious, shite' magic of the Atharvans and the terrible, sorcerous, black magic of the Argirases. The substirution of Bhrgu for Athartan in this name (Bhrgrângirasah) is presumably the result of the dominant role played by the family of the Bhrgus 10 a certain penod of India's cultural history. The Poro hita of a Vedic ling, who, with a vien to being able adequately to discharge the daties of his responsible office, *2$ etpected to be an adept in white and black magic, naturally depended on the mantras and practices of the dtharsareda, and so this Veda cum 
326 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
to be called Purohita-Veda It was called Asaira-Veda, because it included within its scope many practices specifically relatiog to the Ksatriya rulers The Athanaseda consisted of brahmans or magically potent mantras, and was, therefore, called Brahima Veda But the other reason why the Athanaveda is called Brahma-Veda is far more significant On account of the peculiar character of the contents of the Athanaveda, that Veda was, for a long time, regarded as not being on par with the other three Vedas (trayr) As a reaction against this exclusive attitude of the Vedic hierarchy, the Atharvavedins went to the other extreme and claimed that their Veda not only enjoyed, by night, the full status of a Veda, but that it actually comprehended the other three Vedas Already, the view had been independently gaining ground, namely, that the Rgreda, the Yajurveda, and the Sämaleda were essentially limited in their scope and that the brahman alone was truly limitless The sponsors of the Athana veda claimed that this brahman was adequately embodied in their Veda - that the Atharvaveda was Brahma-Veda It is not unlikely that the name Brahma-Veda became stabilised, because the priest of the Atharvaveda in the Vedic ritual was called Brahm. The Atharvaveda is a Veda of magic, and magic becomes effective only through the joint operation of mantras and the correspond ing practices The Atharvareda-Samlıtä itself contains only the mantras, while its various practices are described in its many ancillary texts, particularly in its five kalpas The Atharvaicda 15 accordingly sometimes referred to as the Veda of the five kalpas 
Nine (or, sometimes, fifteen) sākhas of the Atharraveda are traditionally known, but the Samıtās of only two säkhās, namely, the Saunaka and the Paippalida, have been preserved It was once believed that the Paippakada sākha was restricted to Kashmir, and the Paippalāda-Samhută was, therefore erroneously called the Kashmiian Athanaveda But it bas now been shown that that sākhā of the Atharvoreda had spread widely also in Eastern Jodia and Gujarat The Saunaka Samhita of the Athanaveda has, however, been more commonly current It consists of 730 
LITERATURE OF BRAHMANISV 
327 
hymas (sūktas ), grouped into twenty books or kõndas About five sitths of these sültas ( which are called artha-süktas) contain metrical stanzas, while the remaining säkras ( which are called parjaga-sukras ) contain arasānas or prose-units Unlike the Rgreda-Sanna, the arrangement of the Atharraveda-Samhitā is Dot governed by any consideration of authorshup- it is, indeed, understandable that the histoncal tradition regarding authorship has not been preserved in respect of this Veda of the masses - or of subject matter Agaio, the Atharrareda shows considerable looseness in the matter of metre, accent, and grammar, prestrah ly because, unlike the Rgveda, that Veda was not subjected to any deliberate revision and redaction 
The contents of the Atharrateda are remarkably varied 10 character There are in that Veda charms to counteract disease and possession by evil spirits ( bhaisaj)ūni) Indeed, the Atharra veda presents perhaps the most complete account of primitive medicine Then there are prayers for health and long life (ājussani) and for happiness and prosperity (pausnhânı) There are also spells pertaining to the variods kinds of relationship with Fomen (strikarmanı) Hymns which concem themselves with the affaus iny olyog the king (rājalarmanı) and those which are intended for secunog harmony in domestic, social, and political fields (sāmmanasanı) form another significant section of the Atharsareda As for black magis, the Atharrateda abounds in formulas for sorcery and imprecation, for exorcism and counter exorcism (ābhicărikani krtjāpanhararını) One of the most striking features of the Atharraseda may be said to be its polarity, for, side by side with the incantations for sorcery and black magic, this Veda contains bughly theosophic or philosophical speculations which represent a significant landmark in the history of lodian thought 
As has been mentioned earlier, the Rgreda and the Atharra Teda are the only two primary Samhurās, the other two Sarhitås being mostly derivative in character Again, it is to be noted 10 this very context that the Sāmaseda and the Yusurreda may be styled as Samurās because they are, in a sense, collections of 
328 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISVI 
niantras, but in them are reflected tendencies not of the Samta penod but of the Brahmana-penod. 
The Sarrateda-Samhità is a collection of mantras prescribed for being chanted at vanous Som3-sacrifices by the Udgått pnest and his assistants, and thus seres an avonedly ritualistic pur pose. Though called Samaredo it is not strictly spealing 2 collection of samans The Sarrateda is essentially 2 dentative production in the sense that most of its rantras are derived from the Rgteda One may imagine three distinct stages in the cro lution of this Veda. Firstly there is some specific mantra from the Rgeda in its original form This n anira is the talen over in the Samneda with a view to its being made the basis of a proper sèman or chant. The only change that is effected in this process concerns the marking of the accents - Dumbers 1, 2, and 3 being now used to indicate the accents instead of the vertical and honzontal tipes as in the Rgreda. In this second stage the mantra is called stīmaj oni-mantra The Samarcd-Samhita is actually a collection of such simaj oninianiras 
This collection is made up of two main parts - the Punărcila and the Uttarārcika The Pünārcıha consists of 585 single verses, the first 114 being addressed to Agni the next 352 to Indra, and the last 119 to Soma, while the Uttarārcıka consists of 1225 verses grouped into 400 units of connected verses, mostly treas The total number of mantras in the Samareda, not counting the repeated ones, is 1549, out of which all but 78 are talen from the Rsreda, mostly its cighth and dinth mardalas 
It is, however, not in the form in which tbey occur in the Samareda-Samhita that these mantras are cooployed by the Udgātt in connection with the Soma-ritual Toe siimaron-mantras are transformed into chants or ritual melodies, called ganas, by means of such devices as the modifiaton, prolongation, and repetition of the syllables occurrog in the mantra itself and the occasional insertion of additional syllables (stobhas) These sānas, which represent the third and final stage in the cvolution of the Sämareda, Art collected in four bools, amely, the

Grārzageyagāra, the Ararsegera, the Chagora, acd the Crregara Of course, these găra-collecti093 are quite distinct from the Sarrateda-Sarraute Normally, each gära included in these collections is given some technical care like Brtar, Rathiniara, Golamasya Paria, etc. Sicce one samagort-it.artra can be chan ted in a venety of ways, it may give rise to seteral göras For bostance, three gäres, namely, Gotarasa Parka, Kaspapessa Bērhise, and acother Goiatasja Parka, bave evolved out of the first martra in the Sarrareda-Sama Ceosequently the pumber of Samagros is much larger than the sma) ori-martras - the Dumber of géras in the Jaimidija school being 3,681 ard that in the Kauthumi school 2,722 
Thirteen sältas of the Sorreeds are traditionally mention ed, though only three altás, namely, Kauthoma, Raniyaniya, and Jaimini, are better known today Patarl, in bus Jaha bhāsa, speaks of the Sárovzda 'having 1,000 paths' (Chaya. Tartrra säraredah). This character2003 presumably suggests the large number of the possible modes of sõna-chanting rather than 1,000 siltās of the Sarrameda 25 supposed by some 
In the Bhageradgitā (X. 22) the Säraveda glonged as the most ercellent of the Vedas This may be due to the great efficacy of the magical potere engendered in the Vedic ntual by the chanting of the sēmaris Urderstandably enough there 15 also the other side of the magic of the Sancteds which has gien rise to the traditioa that, sicce sorse portions of the Säma. reda are connected with abhāra, the recitation of the Rgreda and the Yajurseda must stop at the sound of the chanting of a sarar 
Like the Sarrated, the curreda too is essentially ritua listic in character This is clearly indicated by Vásta's derivation of the word jars from the root ya shich means to sacrifices But while the Samiateda coccerns itself exclusively with the Soma-sacrifice, the Yourseda trests of the entre sacrificial

system Indeed, the Yajurveda may be regarded as the first regular text-book on the Vedic ritual as a whole It deals mainly with the duties of the Adhvaryu priest who is responsible for the actual performance of the various sacrificial rites Incidentally it may be pointed out that, while the Samaveda represents a very early stage in the history of Indian music, the Yajurveda marks the beginning of Sanskrit prose 
Tradition speaks variously of 86 or 101 or 100 säkhās of the Yajuneda We may, however, begin with the consideration of its two major recensions, the Krsna-Yajurveda and the Sukla. Yajurveda The difference between these two recensions Iles not so much in their contents as in tbeir arrangement In the Krsna Yajuneda, the mantras (mostly derived from the Rgveda) and the yajus or sacrificial formulas in prose and their ritualistic explana tion (called the brähmana) are mixed up together That is to say, in the matter of form and contents, the Samhitā of the Krsna Yajurveda is not particularly distinguishable from the Brahmana or the Aranjala of that Veda As agajost this, the Samhita of the Sulla-Yajurieda contaids only the mantras and sajus - the corresponding ritualistic explanation and discussion being res erved for the Šatapatha-Brāhmana which belongs to that Veda 
From among the many schools of the Krsna-Yajurveda, the Samliitās of only four schools, namely, the Taittiriya, the Katha, the Maitrāyaniya, and the Kapisthala Katha, are today available either wholly or ja fragments The Tarttıriya school, which is traditionally divided into two branches, pamely, the Aukhya and the Khāndikeya, and is further subdivided into five branches, pamely. the Āpastamba, the Baudhāyana, the Satyāsādha. Hiranya kesin, the Bhāradvája, and the Vaikbīnasa 54, has preserved 
maintaining the continuity from the Samlıtā period, through the Brāhmana-Aranyaka-Upanı sad periods, up to the Sūtra period It is presumably on account of this fact that the Taittıriya school

is often equated with the whole of the Krsna-Yarneda The name Taittırıya 'is variously explamed There is, for instance, the legend which narrates how Yājāavalkya, who had developed differences with his teacher Vasampāyana, vomitted the Veda which he had studied from his teacher, how, at the instance of Vanampāyana, his other pupils assuming the form of filtını birds consumed the vomitted Veda, how, consequently, the Veda so recovered by the artırı birds was called the Taittirija-P'eda, and how, finally, Yāpavalkya secured from the sun-god another Veda wbich came to be known as the sukla or bright Yajuneda It is also suggested that, on account of the interspersion in it of the mantra and the brähmand, the Krsna-Yajuneda appears variegated 
like a attırı bird aod is, therefore, aled Tartırija-Sanhira But the most satisfactory explanation of the name seems to be that an ancient sage called Tittiri was traditionally regarded as the *seer' of this Veda 
As suggested above, the Samhit the Brāhmana, and the Aran yaka of the Taittiriya school form one sipgle unit, and together cover the entire Vedic ntual The Tarija Samhita is divided into 7 händas, 44 prasas (prapūrhakas), 651 anuālas, and 2198 khandikäs The principal sacrifices described in it inclode the New-moon and the Full-moon sacrifices, the Agnistoma, the Vajapeya, the Ripusūya, the Sautrā mani the Agoyadheya, the Agnihotra, the Pasobandha, the Agnicayana, etc These are supplemented by the Tattırīja-Brihrana which deals with the Ašvamedha, the Purusamedha, the Naksatra-Yagas, etc, and the Tairtrija-Arany aka which deals with the Sarvamedha, the Pits medha, the Pravargya, etc It may be observed that, in the Taittiriya texts, neither the different sacrifices nor-the-tantras are given in any rational order It may be pointed qui-that, in view of the peculiar arrangement of these terts, a special method; called the Sārasvata-Patha, which imples the study of the manira and. the brahmana portons together, is adopted in connecpon with them 
The other Samhuês of the Krsna-lapun eda agree substantially with the Tarttırija-Samhilā in the matter of contents and arrange.

ment, and even verbally The nucleus of the Katha-Samhita ( which is more commonly known as the Köthaka-Samhitā) is formed of three händas, called Ithimikā, Madhyamikā, and Orimikā Two more kändas are added to this nucleus presumably by way of app endixes - one relating to the japā and the puronuāksă verses to be recited by the Hotr (and the Maitrāvaruna) and the other to the formulas connected with the Asyamedha sacrifice A few striking features of the Kathaka-Samhitā may be mentioned here Firstly, the names of the first and the third kandas of this Samhitā, namely, Ilhimikā and Ormkā, are quite intriguing Secondly, a compa. rative study of the Krsna-Yajurveda and the Suhla-Yajurveda shows that the Kathaka-Samlıtā occupies a position intermediate between the Taittiriya-Samhita and the Vājasaney, Samhitā It may also be noted that the school of the Kathas seems to have been widely current in the days of Patañjalı, as is evidenced by his statement grāme grăme kathakam kālāpakam ca procjale 
The Samhita of the Maitrāyaniya school, which latter is closely related to the school of the Manavas, may be said to be more systematic in its arrangement than either the Taittiriya Samhita or the Kathaka-Samutā Its nucleus is made up of three händas, but there is also the fourth kända of the nature of an appendix (khila) and the fifth kanda which constitutes the Mairri. Upanısad The Kapısthala-Katha-Samhitā is available only in a fragmentary and more or less corrupt form Out of its 48 adhyāyas, as many as 19 are lost The text of this Samhită shows but little divergence from that of the Kathala-Samhita 
A significant feature of the Suhla-Yajuneda Samhitā, which is also known as the Vājasanezi Samhitā, is that the entire Samhuta and its Bralumana, called the Satapatha-Brahmana, have come down in two distinct versions - the Madhyandına and the Kānva These two versions show essential agreement from the point of view of their contents and arrangement, it is only in the readings of some of the sacrificial formulas and in the orthogra phical peculiarities, such as reading d Occurring between two

vowels as I, that they differ from each other As indicated above, the name Sukla-Yarurreda implies the presentation of mantras (or verses) and sajus (formulas) ID a pure and locd manner by separating them from the brāhmana portion This Samhita is also called Vājasaney 1-Samhita after its traditionally accepted apthor Yamasalkya who is bellesed to base been the son of Vājasen: As another explanation of this name, it is suggested that Yāžavalkya secuted (san) this Veda from the san god who had assumed the form of a horse (rājin) The word rājasoni may even mean the obtaining of food or of strength', which is, after all the principal purpose of a sacrfice 
The Văjasanej --Samhit in the Mádbyandına version consists of 40 adhyājas, 303 anusakas, 1975 Londihas The first 25 adhja fas, which perhaps originally formed the entire Samhita, contain Terses and formulas relating to the principal sacrificial ritual The next 4 adhyājas include additions to these basic verses and formulas Adhjājas 30-39 deal with such sacrifices as the Purusa medha, the Sarvamedba, the Pitrmedha, and the Pravargya, while the last adhjāja constitutes what is popularly known as the Isopanısad The Kansa-Samhita, which also consists of 40 adhyājas, generally follows the same pattern of the distribution of subject matter 
Attection may be drama here to some points of special inte rest in connection with the Sulla-} ajurveda-Samhită The sui teenth adhyāja of the Nadhy andina-Sanhıtā, which forms the famous Satarudrija, throws considerable light on the character of the ancient Suva-Rudra religion The thirtieth adhyāja dealing with the Purusamedha is important in that it mentions a number of mixed castes A mantra connected with the Assamedha con tains historically significant allusions to Ambā, Ambikā, and Ambālıkā and also to Subhadrikā of the city of Kampilya in tbe Pancāla country' It is also noteworthy that the Vădhyandına Samhita uses the word arrunas and the Kania-Samhita the word

phalguna in a formula relating to a sacrificial site at the corona tion of a king Indeed, the latter Samlată seems to show close familiarity with the Kurus and the Pancūlas and their country 10 
The Samaveda-Samhitā and more particularly the Yajurveda Samhitā already reflect the stage in the evolution of the Brāhmanic religion when that religion had come to be more or less wholly identified with the Vedic sacrificial ritual Sacrifice was then looked upon not merely as a means to an end, but as the end in itself Indeed, sacrifice had almost become the very centre of the life of certain sections of the community The sacrificial system, which had already been rendered highly complex, continued to be made still more complex It was naturally not possible for an ordinary jodividual to master all the increasingly complicated details of the ritual, involving the prakrt-jāgas and the vikrtz jāgas, the obligatory (nitya) sacrifices and the optional (kāmya) sacrifices, and the havis sacrifices and the Soma sacrifices It was consequently inevitable that distinct classes of priests, whose main occupation was to officiate at the various sacrifices in different capacities such as Hotr, Adhvaryu, Udgāts, Brahman, etc, should have arisen in the Vedic society It was also inevitable that these priests should have produced manuals dealing with the different aspects of the theory and practice of sacrifice These manuals are the Brahmanas One claim which is implied in the Brahmanas is that all the mantras in the Rgveda, the Atharvareda, and the other Samhitis are intended to serve an essentially ritualistic purpose, and that the Brahmanas prescribe the maoner in which they are to be made to serve that purpose Accordingly, each of the Brāhmanas is connected with one or the other of the Samhitās 
Broadly speaking a Brāhmana text consists of two main parts - the vidhi and the arthavada The vidhi part sets forth the various details relating to a particular sacrifice, such as the proper time and place for a sacrifice, the site of initiation, the priests, the sacred fires, the diginities, the mantras, the oblations, the utensils

and other material, the dalsinā, and the expiation-ntes The corres ponding artharõda glonfies that sacrifice as a whole or a specific nite or detail in that sacrifice by emphasizing its efficaciousness It does so, firstly, by means of ancient legends - most of them having the conflict between the gods and the demons as their central theme They narrate how the gods and the demons were engaged in a battle, how, in the initial stages of that battle, the gods were overpowered by the demons, hor the gods then some how acquired the knowledge of a particular sacrifice or a ritual detail, and how, finally, on account of their hastag performed that sacrifice or having practised that nitual detail, they became power fol enough to vanquish the demons Apother method of glori fying jusufying, or recommending any sacrifice or rite, adopted by the Brālimaras, is etymologising Through an etymologs, which is often fanciful, an item pertaining to the sacrifice is sought to be ensuringly connected with its promised fruit The artharada sometimes lays stress on what is technically called the rupa samrddhi of a 53crificial nite It is often seen that so far as the meamng of a mantra is concerned, the ironira and the ntcal action which is to be accompanied by that mantra hardly have any rational connection with each other it is, indeed, the sound of the mantra, and rot its sense, which actually possesses the ritual istic potence But when, in some cases, even the meaning of a mantra conforms to the ritual action, the mantra becomes, so to 
say, doubly efficacious and thereby brings about the rūpasamrdchi of the sacrificial site Bat perhaps the most common device en ployed in the artharāda for confirmiog the efficacy of a sacrificial rite described in the ridhı portion is bandhurā, that is, the esta blusbment of some kind of mystic or magical bond between the various aspects of sacrifice and their desired result. In this connection it needs to be specially pointed out that magic, and not logic, is the main basis of the Vedic sacrificial system 
Many Vedic texts are traditionally called Brālmamas, but the more important among them are the Altareja and the Kausirakı belonging to the Rgreda, the Tarttırija belonging to the Krsna Yajurveda, the Satapatha belonging to the Sulla-Yajurvedd, the

Jaiminija and the Tand, a belonging to the Sama eda, and the Gopatha belonging to the Atharvareda The Antares a Brāhmana, which naturally concerns itself mainly with the duties of the priest of the Rgveda, namely the Hoir, is divided into 8 pañcikas of five adhyājas each Clear evidence is available of Pāoini's having known all the forty adhyājas of this Brālmana 11 The first 24 adhyāyas of the Artareya-Brāhmana deal with the hautra of the various Soma sacrifices, the next 6 with the Agnihotra and the duties of the Hotr's assistants, and the last 10, which show signs of being a later addition, with the Pasuyāga and the Rāja. sūya The Kausitakı-Brahmana, also known as the Sanhhāyana Brāhmana, has 30 adhyājas it is a better organized text and covers more or less the entire sacrificial procedure 
As has been pointed out elsewhere, the Taittiriya-Brähmana 15 merely a continuation of the Tarttıriya Samhità Its three kändas either supplement the discussion of the ritual in the Samhita or contain a more detailed treatment of some of the topics dealt with in it 
The Satapatha-Brāhmana, on the other hand, must be re garded as an independent work which is quite remarkable in many respects Indeed, after the Rgveda and the Atharvaveda, it is perhaps the most important Vedic text from the point of view of both extent and contents The Madhyandına version of the Satapatha-Brāhmana consists of 14 kändas (each Lända haylag a separate name derived from its contents ), 68 prapathakas or 100 adhyāyas ( from which latter the Brāhniana presumably gets its name), 438 brāhmanas, 7624 kandıkās in the Kanya version, the first, the fifth, and the fourteenth Ländas are each divided into two händas, the total number of kāndas in that version thus being 17 Otherwise the names of the kāndas and their contents in the two versions are generally the same The first 9 kändas of the Müdhyandına Satapatha-Brälmana, which seem to repre sent the older portion, fully correspond with the first 18 adhyājas of the Vājasaney-Samhută, and thus cover the basic sacrificial

ritual The tenth kārda, called Agnirahasa, speaks of the my stical significance of the various aspects of the sacred fires, while the eleventh, called As'adhyāv recapitulates the entire sacrificial ritual The twelftb kanda is alled Vadhyama, which pane clearly suggests that landas 10–14 constitute a separate ont added later to the original Brahmana This would seem to be confirmed by Patañjali's reference to this Brahmana as Sastipatha' - a name presumably derised from the fact that the first 9 händas together consist of 60 adhjāsas The twelfth Lända concerts itself with expiation-ntes and the Sautramani sacrifice The thirteenth Tanda deals mainly with the Assamedha and rather briefly with the Purisimedha and the Sanamedha The first three adhyā) 25 of the last kända of the Sareparha-Brāhmana are devoted to the consideration of the Pravargya, hile the last 6 adhjuājas consti tute the famous Brhadāranjaka-Uparisad 
One of the important features of the Sarapatha-Brāhmana is the large number of legends which it contains From among these legends may be specially mentioned those of Manu and the fish, the migration of Vıdegha Māthara from the region of the Sarasyati to the regon of the Sadānīrā ll the rejuvenation of Cyavana,s the romantic affair between Porüraras and Urvas1,16 and the contest between Kadrū and Suparni"? Another impor tant feature is that, while some portions of this Brahmana are intimately connected with the Kuru-Paccalas, 1t some others have their provenance in Kosala-Videba 1: This fact clearly indicates that the Salapatha-Brāhmana is a composite work and that its composition must have extended widely m time and space In this connection it is noteworthy that the principal figure in landas 1-5 and 11-15 is Yāzāsalkya, whereas it is sandilya in Ländas 6-10.

The Sāmaveda can boast of the largest number of Brāhmana texts connected with it, but only two or threc of them can be proper ly called Brahmanas - the others being more or less of the nature of Parišistas The Jammıniya-Brälmana, which consists of 1252 sections and which is thus one of the bulkiest of the Vedic texts, constitutes the best source of information regarding the technique of the Sīmagas But it is also a disficult text, since the ritual and the legendary data in it are more or less isolated Another Brahmana which belongs to the Sāmai eda is the Tāndja Brālimana It is also known as the Pañcaviša-Brāhmana, lor, it consists of 25 books Its chief concern is of course the Soma-sacrifice in all its varieties, but its detailed descriptions of the sacrificial sessions (sattras ) organized on the banks of the Drśadrati and the Saras. vati and its treatment of the Vrātya-stomas are also quite interesting Like the Pañcanımía-Brālimana, the Sānaseda also has a Saduimša-Brālmana, the last book of which, called the Adbhuta-Brālimana, deals with omens and portents 
The Gopatha Brahmana, which is the only Brahmana of the Athanaveda known to us, is perhaps the youngest of the Brahmana-texts It is also limited in extent, consisting as it does of only two books with 11 prapāthakas The Caranas) üha, which is one of the Parisistas of the Athariaveda, however, says that the Gopatha Brāhmana originally consisted of 100 chapters, out of which only two have survived This is plausible, though not entirely, since many statements whicb are referred to in other texts as being derived from this Brālimana Bre not traceable in the text of that Brāhmana which is available today A significant point about the Gopatha-Brāhmana is that, for the most part, it contains myths, legends, and parables which are intended to illustrate and explain various ceremonies in the Vedic ritual The Atharvanic character of this Brāhmana becomes evident in several ways For instance, it glorifics Angiras as the 'sage of sages , 30 and empha sizes that a Vedic sacrifice performed without the help of a priest of the Athar aneda is bound to fail 21 Incidentally, Yáska in his

The supposed incongruity between the apparently inconsequen tial and trusial ritualistic details which have been discussed in the Brähnanas and the mock-serious but tediously repetitive manner in which they have been discussed has tended to create the impression that the Brahmanas are after all a twaddle, and, what Is worse, a theological twaddle It, however, needs to be pointed out that what may appear as inconsequential and trial to modern logic could certainly not have been so in the context of ritualistic magic Similarly, the repetitive style of the Brahmanas must have been intended to sene a significant practical porpose, namely, facilitating the oral transmission of those texts The characterisation of the Brāhmanas as twaddle also does injustice to them by neglecting to appreciate adequately their importance from the culture-historical point of vier For instance, from the point of view of the literary history of ancient India, the Brahmanas are important on account of the facts that they represent the earliest attempts to interpret the Vedic mantras, that thes mark the beginnings of Sanskrit prose, that they have presened many ancient legends, and tbat they have in them the seeds of the future development of seseral literary forms and works as also of various branches of knowledge The Brāhmanas contain an exclusive and comprehensive treatment of Vedic sacrificial ritual, and thus constitute hughly authontause sources for one of the most significant periods in the religious history of India. It is again the Brāhmanas which have prepared the back ground for the philosopbical speculations of the Upani sads And, finally, a culture-bustorian can ill afford to lose sight of the various facts of socio-political history which are interspersed in the ntualistic lucubrations of the Brahmaras 
The Arcnjalas may be said to have been regarded as inde pendent Vedic texts only by courtesy Actually they represent but a kipd of continuation of the Brāhmanas, tertually as well as conceptualy They mark the transition from the ntualism of the Brāhmanas to the spintoalism of the Upanışads While, on the340

one hand, most of the Aranyaka texts form the concluding portions of some of the Brāhmanas, they have, on the other hand, some of the Upanisad-texts either imbedded 10 or appended to them The Aranjakas seek to present the true mystique of the ritual by glorifying the inner, mental sacrifice as against the external, material sacrifice These tendencies were obviously esoteric and, in a sense, dangerous The study of the Arany akas was, therefore, traditionally restricted to the solitude of forests (aranja) That is why they came to be called Āranjakas It is also not unlikely that this name got confirmed op account of their schematic congection with the forest dweller's stage (Vāna prasthāśrama) 
Only a few texts have traditionally come to be called Aranyakas The Altarej a-Aranjaka, belonging to the Rgieda, consists of five books, out of which the second and the third are specifically attributed to Mahidāsa Aitareya and are generally theosophic in their tendencies The first three sections of the second book, which are said to be intended for persons who desire liberation jp gradual stages, teach the prāna-upāsanā The last three sections of that book constitute the Antareya-Upanısad which sets forth Vedāntic doctrines The third book deals with Samhita upāsana and is meant for persons who are still attached to worldly possessions Jo its other parts, this Āransaka treats of such sacrificial ceremonies as the Mahāvrata The Kausitakı-or San khāyana-Aranjaka, which also belongs to the Rgveda, consists of three books - the first two of which are ritualistic in character while the third forms the Kausitaht-Upanisad As for the Tantriya Aranjaka, it is a direct continuation of the Samlıā and the Brāhmana of the Taittiriya school It supplements the treatment of Vedic ritual in the latter two texts by dealing, in its first six books, with such sacrifices as the Sarvamedha, the Pitrmedha, and the Pravargya Its next three books constitute the Taullirija Upa. nisad, while its tenth and last book is known as the Mahānärājana Upanısad The first three adhyāyas of the fourtecoth kända of the Satapatha-Brāhmana are called Arany aha and their subject. matter is the Pravargya The last six adhjajas of that kanda

The Upanissads may be said to have been the outcome of a strong and deliberate reaction against the priestly exclusiveness and the attitude of blind acceptance engendered by the Brāh manas in the soC10-religious and the intellectual spheres res pectively Free thinking, scepticism, and attitude of inquiry were by no means altogether absent in the earlier periods of Vedic literary history, but they began to become emphatically operative in the atmosphere created by the Brāhmanas The claw of the priests that they alone were entitled to expound the Veda authoritatively, the exclusively ritualistic interpretation which was forced upon the Vedic mantras, the emphasis on the religious efficacy of mechanical sacerdotalism, the elevation of sacrifice almost to the status of the ultimate cosmic principle --- these and similar tendencies which were prominently reflected in the Brāhmanos ane to be challenged by the Upadisadıc thinkers They were not prepared to accept anything on trust - Dot even what was claimed to have been ordained by the Veda They began to ask questions, and it was out of these questions that gedpine philosophical thunking developed The Upanısadıc thiokers also sought to rediscover the spirit of religion which had been smothered by the ercessive insistence of the prests on even the minor detais of the form of religion And, finally, the Upapisadic thinkers helped to bring about a kiod of democratisa tion in the domain of religion and philosophy 
The word upanisad 1interpreted variously It is made to correspond with the word upasana which is understood to mean either worship or profound knowledge 23 Or the word upanısad is sometimes interpreted as mysterious wisdom derived through tapas ?! The word is also connected with the Puli word spanisa and is thereby made to mean something like cause or connection

upanuisad as that which destroys (sad = to destroy) ignorance But the sense most commonly assigned to the word upanısad is the esoteric teaching imparted by the teacher to the pupil who sits (sad) near him ( upa) 10 a closed select (1) group The Upanisads are also called Vedānta, because they represent the concluding portion of the apauruseya Veda or Śruti, or the final stage in Vedic instruction, or the ultimate end and aim of the teachings of the Veda 
It may be broadly stated that the Samlırās, the Brähnianas, and the Upanisads are the creation respectively of the poet-priests, the ritual priests, and the poet-philosophers One must, however, hasten to add that the Upanisads can be hardly regarded as embodying any sustained philosophical system as such They are neither critical in their approach nor constructive in their treat ment What one finds in them are only the results, without the processes, of speculative activity - only the conclusions without the methodology, of philosophical thinking Logic is usually at a discount, and reliance is mostly placed on intuition or inner voice It was not that the Upanjsadic thinkers abliorred logic, they were only convinced of the inadequacy of logic as an instru ment to tackle the problem of the ultimate reality For them, the ultimate reality was not merely to be intellectually compre hended but it was to be spiritually experienced Accordingly, the Upanısadıc speculations can, at best, claim to be inspired guesses at truth The approach of the Upanisadıc thinkers to the various problems of philosophy is, by and large, mystic vitutional rather than metaphysical-intellectualistie, and their style is characterised by poetic symbolism rather than by logical rigour Verily, the Upansads are the songs before the sunrise 
But the importance of the Upanisads as some of the earliest recorded attempts at systematic, ihough not systematised, philo. sophizing can hardly be garasard They constitute one of the most significant sources of the spiritual wisdom of India, and are traditionally regarded as one of the three prasthānas of Indian philosophy Also one cannot fail to be impressed by certain notable features of the Upanış ads, such as the unity of their pur

pose in spite of the variety of the doctrines, the note of certainty or definiteness which informs them, and the various levels at which they consider and represent reality 
Not much need be said about the Upanisads in the context of religious literature as such, because they concern themselves with the contemplative-realizational rather than with the ritua listic-ceremonial aspect of the spuntual life of the people. In other words, they may be broadly said to belong to the realm of philosopiy rather than to that of religion, though in the 2ncent Iodian ideology it is by no means easy to damarcate between religion and philosophy Over 200 tests call themselves Upani sads, but they include such recent works as the Christopanısad and the Allopanısad The Junikopanised gies a traditional ust of 108 Upanisads (10 belonging to the Rgreda, 19 to the Sukla Yajurveda, 42 to the Krsna-ların eda, 16 to the Såmaseda, and 31 to the Atharrareda ), but, even out of these, many texts are called Upani sads only by courtesy Usually 13 Upanısads are regarded as the principal Upanisads They are traditionally con Dected with one Vedic sâkhā or another, and several of them actually form part of a larger literary complet 
The Isa-Upanısad belongs to the Sulla-Yajurveda and is included in the Vājasanej e-Samhită as its last, that is the fortieth, arthjoja This Upanisad, which derives its name from its first nord, emphasizes the unity of being and becoming but, in this connection, it speaks of the Personal God rather than of Para brahman It elaborates the doctrine of ridji (lnowledge of the reality) and arıdja (harma) and sets forth the view that a life of activism is a pecessary precondition for the attaiment of amriatia The Kena-Upani sad, hich also derives its name from its initial word, forms part of the fourth bool of the Talarakāra. Brāhmang of the Samareda It consists of four sections, out of which the first to, which are in verse, deal with the Brahman, the parā ridy, and the sad, omuld, while the last two, which are in prose deal with Isvara, the apară ridyā, and the Aramarruktı This Upanisad contains the famous legend of Umā Haimavati One of the better known Upanisads is the Marha or the Kathala,

which belongs to the Krsna-} ajurveda It consists of two chap ters having three vallıs each, and his for the background of its philosophical teaching the striking legend of Yama and Nacıketas A noteworthy point about this Upanısad is that it has many passages common with the Bhagavadgitā 
The Prašna-Upanı sad, the Mfunda (or Mundaka )-Upanisad, and the Mānduk ya-Upanisad belong to the Athariaveda As its name suggests, the Prasna Upanısad deals, in its six sections, with the sux questions (praśnas) relatiog to such topics as the nature of the ultimate cause, the significance of Om, and the relation between the Supreme and the world The name Munda is suggestive of renunciation, and, in its three chapters, this Upa nisad discusses samnyāsa and parā vidjā as against samsára and aparā vidyā Incidentally, the national motto of India, saljam eva jajate, is taken from this Upanısad (II! 1 6) The Mfandūkja-Upanı sad is a very small text consisting of only twelve stanzas, but it has attained a significant place in the philosophical literature of India on account of the fact that Gaudapıda, tradı. tionally believed to have been Sankara's teacher s teacher, prote, by way of a commentary on this Upanisad, his famous Kārkās which may be said to contain the first systematic statement of the doctrine of absolute monism The Tarttırija Upanisad is a part of the larger literature complex of the Taittiriya school of the Krsna-Yajurveda As pointed out in an earlier context, books 7-9 of the Taittirija- Āranjala constitute the Taustırija-Upani sad, while its tenth and last book is known as the Mahânārajana Upanisad The Tautarija-Upanısad is divided soto three sections called jallis-the Siksā vall, the Brahmananda-ralli, and the Bhrgu vall. The Aufarej a-Upanisad of the Rgieda is equivalent to Aitareya-Aranjaka II 4-6 
By far the most important of the Upanisads are the Chando gja agd the Brhadaranyaka The Chăndogja-Brahmana belonging to the Kauthuma-sakhă of the Sámaveda consists of ten chapters The first two chapters, which comprise the Mantra-Brāhmana, deal with ritualistic subjects, while the last eight chapters con stitute the Chandogja Upanisad The first two of the cight

prarăthalos of the Chårdog a-Upanisad may be said to be Brahmanic tendency They treat of the various names of 
unce, as also of udgitha and prarara Another subject with which they deal is the three @stamas The other prapithalas of the Chandog a-Upanisad are distinctively philosopbucal in character Some of the topics 10 this Uponisad of particular philosophical interest are the sandılja ndjá, ibe samsarga ridjā, the paiStārata-radyo, and the teachings imparted by Praāpati to Indra, by Ghora Angrasa to Korda Deviliputra, by Uddalaka Ārudi to Svetaketu, and by Sanatku mára to Mārada The Brlidāranj aha-l fanssad wbuch belongs to the Sula-racurreda, is the biggest and perhaps the oldest of the Upanisads In the Madhyandına recension this Upanisad corresponds with chapters 4-8 of the fourteenth handa and chapter 6 of the tenth handa of the Solapatha-Brahmarg of the same recension The Kanya Brlodāranj al a-l parisad (which, incidentally, Satlara has chosen for his commentary) is analogous to the last six chapters of the sixteenth kõnda of the Kānya Satapatha-Brāhmana There is, however, no material divergence between the two recensions so far as the subject matter is concerned. The first two chapters of the Brhadaranjaka Upanisad constitote the madhu-landa, the main purpose of which 15 to establish the bas c identity of Jiva and Brahman The next two chapters, which seem to form the kernel of this Upanısad and which make up what is known as the jajFaralkza-kānda or the mun-kanda, are domipated by the personality and the teachings of the greatest of the Upadisadic pbilosophers, Yáña Valkya The Khula-hānda, shuch consists of the last two chapters, deals with various kinds of upásanās It is not unlikely that these three hardas onginally formed three independent Upansadic texts It may, indeed, even be that the Brhodárenjala Upanisad represents a fusion of many shorter Upanısads 
The three other Uparısads which are usually added to the traditionally recogaized dosa upanısadah (mentioned above) to make up the thirteen principal Upanisads are the Sretānatara and the Jauri or Jaitrāj ani (both of which belong to the Krsna.

Yajuricda) and the kausitaki (which belongs to the Rgveda ) The Svetāśvatara-Upanisad, which consists of six chapters and 113 stanzas, is essentially a theistic text It presents the Supreme Brahman as the Personal God Rudra and teaches the doctrine of bhakt This Upanisad is also remarkable for its use of the Samkhya terminology and its attempt at reconciling different religious and philosophical views which were currently in vogue 25 The Maitri- or Maitrājani Upanisad consists of seven chapters, the last two of which are comparatively late It mentions the Trimurti concept, and, 10 its references to the illusory character of the world and the momentariness of phenomena, seems to betray the influence of Buddhistic thought The Kausilaki-Upa. ni sad, though also called Kausitakı-Brāhmana Upami sad, is not connected with the kausitaki (or Sankhāyana )-Brāhmana As we have already seen, this Upanı sad is the third chapter of the Sankha. Jana Ārany aka It deals, among other topics, with the progres sive definition of the Brahman, the course to Bralımaloka, and Indra as life and immortality 
Apart from these principal Upanisads, there are many other Upanısads which are essentially sectarian in character and pseudo philosophical in contents They are usually divided, in accor dance with their main tendencies, into various classes such as Sāmānya-Vedānta, Yoga, Samnyāsa, Saiva, Varsnava, and Śūkta 
As for the age of the principal Upanısads, they may be rougbly said to extend over a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BC, the older ones among them being decidedly pre Buddhistic So far as the relative chronology of the Upanisads is concerned, it is customary to speak of the four classes, namely, ancient prose, early metrical, later prose and later metrical However, instead of relying on such external criteria, it would be more reasonable to assume that the Upanisads - particularly the larger ones - were composite works, and then to stratify them as Brahmanic, Brahmano Upanisadic, Upanısadıc, and neo Upa.

Disadic according to the tendencies most prominently reflected in their different parts 
The Upanısads an, no doubt, be said to represent the high watermark of Vedic thought, but it also needs to be realised that certain features of their teachings proved detrimental to the influence of those teachings becoming permanent and widely prevalent For one thing, the Brahmoudy of the Upanisads was too subtle to be adequately comprehended by ordinary people. It demanded high intellectual level and strict spintual descipline on the part of the seeker Again, the absence of any unified doctage in the L panısads tended to confound the common man rather than offer him proper guidance in his spiritual quest The fact that the aim of the Upadisadıc philosophy was essentially individualistic - that the L padisa dic philosophy lacked any larger social appeal- also proved to be, in a sense, its seal point The Upanisads gave to the people a 'philosophy', but not a religion', wbich latter alone could have met their spirtual Deed The cumulative result of all this was that the end of the penod of the major Upanisads say the gradual dwindling of the influence of the Vedic tradition Four cultural movements emerged during the ensu ing interregnum Firstly the heterodor religions like Buddhism and Jainism began to assert themselves Secondly, as a natural reaction to this challenge to orthodor Brahmanism, attempts were made to consolidate the Vedic way of life and thought by reorganising and systematizing all Vedic loonledge and Vedic practice The Sutra-l'edānga Literature was the outcome of these attempts Thirdly, for the purpose of counteracting the renunciatory tendencies generally encouraged by the Upantsads, there grew what may be called secular and materialistic ten dencies such as were best manifested in a work like the Kauning Arthaśāstra And finally, there evolved Hinduism hich steered clear of the heterodory of Buddhism and Jainism on the one band and the revivalism of the $dira-'edānga movement on the other Hinduism was a kind of federation of tribal religious cults, most of u bich were ongnally non-Vedic in provenance and hich tended to converge in the course of histoncal development - this

federation being held together by means of the thin thread of formal allegiance to the Veda For our present purpose, we are concerned only with the literature relating to the second and the fourth movements 
As we have seen, the Brālimanas, the Aranj ahas, and the Upanısads, are believed to be opauruseja Not so the Vedāngas, which represent an attempt at systematizing the various aspects of ancillary Vedic knowledge These Vedāngas are Śrsa (plonetics), Kalpa (socio-religious practice), Vjākarana (grammar), Nirukta (etymology, exegesis, and mythology), Chandas ( metrics), and Jyotisa ( astronomy) Each of these șix Vedāngas is connected, in one way or another, with the Vedic religion, although it is only the haipa which may be said to be directly religious in purpose By the Kalpasūtra is usually understood a whole literary corpus com prising the Srautasūtra, the Gujasūtra, and the Dharmasūtra, which, broadly speaking, refer respectively to the religious, the domestic, and the social aspects of the life of the people These sútras primarily seek to regulate and codify the practices which were already in vogue, but, at the same time, they also initiate new practices or modify the old ones in accordance with the times, the climes, and the school traditions in which they originated 
'There is reason to believe that each Vedic school produced its own Kalpasūtra, though, quite understandably, not all these texts are available today The nature of a Kalpasūtra will be clear from the following analysis of the contents of the Kalpasūtra of the Apastamba school of the Taittiriya sakhā of the Krsna. Yajurieda This kalpasītra consists of 30 praśnas (chapters ), the first 23 of vluch constitute the Srautasūtra The 24th praśna is called the paribhasā prasa and contajas the pariblāså or the general rules and definitions connected with the ritual In view of its character as introduction, this prasna should have beco placed at the very beginning of the Kalpastītra, but, as the commentator Kapardısvāmin explains, this parıbläsa is applicable to both the Srautasülra and the Grljasūtra and is, therefore, placed between these two The paribhäsi praśna also comprises the pravara and the Nautra The 25th and the 26th prasnas give the 
LITERATURE OF BRAAVANSU 
349 
mantras to be employed for the various grhy a rites, while the 27th prašna makes up the pastamba-Grhy asūtra proper The 28th and the 29th prasnas contain the Dharmasüfra, acd the 30th prasna is the Sulbasūtra To these 30 prasnas is sometimes added the 31st prasra constituting the Putriren a sütra Among other soch complete Kalpasūtras which are avadable today, may be mentioned those belonging to the Baudhāyana, the Hiranyaloin, and the Vaikbanasa schools of the Tasttiriya salhă All these texts are called Sutras because they h3ye adopted the unique literary form which was developed dunng this period samely, the Sūtra-form. The sūtra is an apboz tic statement - at once brief, Daequivocal, comprehensive, gecerally valid, and expressive of the essential point Presumabk, the sūtras were originally intended to sene as lecture-notes for the teachers of the various schools 
The Srautasūtres, as has been mentio ed above, contain injunctions regardiog religious practice, which latter, however, 15 understood in the restricted sense of ntualistic practice Natu rally, therefore, they are directly connected witb the Brahmanas, particularly with their ridlu-portions. But the Srautasūtras present the procedure of the various sacrifices (several of which are not at all described in the Brahmanas) 10 a far more completc and systematic manner - these Surras haviog been presumably composed as practical aids to the profe«sional officiating priests Closely related to the Srautasūtras are the Sulbasūtras which deal with such matters as the construction of the Jajñasála, the mea surements of the different kinds of fire-allars, etc 
The Srautasütras generally treat of sacrifices in which the three sacred fires, the Āhararija, the Garhapatja, and the Dalsina, (or sometimes more) are employed These sacrifices usually require the services of several officuting priests such as the Adhvaryu, the Hot, the Brahman and the Udgāts, and their assistants According to the traditional enumeration, the stuuta $acrifices include the seven harirajñas.imsthās (namely Agnya 
dheya, Agnihotra, Darsapürnamāsa, Igraj ana, Căturmisja, Airudhapasibandia, and Sautrāmani) and the seven somaj ajña samsthās (damely, Agnistoma, Athagnistoma, Ththya, Sodasın,350

Vājapeya, Atırätra, and Aptoryāma) The frauta sacrifices are classified in another way, namely, as istis of which the Darsa pūrnmāsa is the norm, the animal sacrifices of which the Nirūdha paśubandha is the norm, and the Soma sacrifices of which the Agnistoma is the norm 
The majority of the Srautasutras which are known today belong to the Hajureda (particularly to the Krsna-Yajurveda) This is quite understandable, for, the Adhvaryu plays the most active role in the frauta ritual, and the Yajuneda is essentially the Veda for the Adhvaryu The Baudhājana Srautasülra belongs to the Taittırīya sak ha of the Krsna-} ajurveda, and is perhaps the oldest among the Srautasūtras Indeed, Baudhayana is traditi onally regarded as the foremost among the Acāryas The Baudrāyana-Srautasülra is called a praiacana, and is written more in the style of the Brāhmanas than of the Sūtras Special mention may be made of the two sections included in this Sitra, namely, the Dardha and the Karmānta, the former critically records the viens on ritualistic practice of the various Ācāryas of the Taittıriya sällä The other Srautasūtras which belong to the Taittiriya sākhã are the Bharadiāja, the Āpastamba, the Satza. sādha-Hıranjałeśin, the Vaikhānasa, and the Vādhūla 26 The Bhäradıāja Srautasītra consists of 15 prašnas, the paitrmedhiha Sūtra, and the parise sa-sūtra It does not give any hautra at all The Apastamba Srautasūtra is the best known of the Srautasütras A Haufraparısista ascribed to Āpastamba is also available There is considerable similarity between the Āpastamba-Srautasūtra and the Satjāsådha lliranjakesı Srautasütra so far as their ritual is concerned A poteworthy feature of the Park hānasa Srautasutra is that, unlike the other Srautasūtras belongiog to the Yajuneda (which begin with the description of the Darśapürnamāsa), it begins with the Agnyādheja which is followed by the Agnihotra homa The text of the Vadhula Šraulasītra, which has become available, is corrupt and fragmentary Out of the two Srauta

practice, called Paddhatis and Prayogas, have been produced by the differeat Vedic schools These are, of course, of a much later date 
The Grhy astītras deal with the household ceremonies or grhy a rites which broadly comprise the seven pākaj ajñasamsthas (namely Aupasanahoma, Vaisiadera, Parana Astakā, Māsi fräddha, Sarpabals, and Bānabalı) and also the rites connected with the various samskäras or sacraments Some rites, like the Agravana, the Aadlıuparla, and the obsequies, are common to both the Srautastra and the Grhjasūtra The Grhiyasītras have very little to do with the Brāhmanas, but they are directly connected with the Samhıtās since they derive their mantras from them it, however, needs to be pointed out that not all the mantras prescribed to be employed in the grhja rites are traceable to the Samutās The grhy a rites are generally performed with the help of only one fire, in many of these rites the services of officiating priests are not required, and Soma has no place in any of them when they form part of a corpus the Grhyasūtra presupposes and occurs after the Srautasūtra It is, however, difficult to say whether the Šrautasūtra and the Grhyasutra belonging to the same school can be ascribed to the same author ship At the same time, one does come across many verbal repetitions in the two Sutras of the same school 
Like the Srautasülras, the Grhy asūtras also show, to a certain extent, the influence of the specific Vedic schools to which they belong The Sanhhājana Golijasūtra, which belongs to the Sankhāyana school of the Rgieda and which is based on the Baskala recension of that Veda consists of six chapters, the last two of which are presumably later additions The name of the author of this Grhyasūtra is said to be Suyajña Śankhiyana The Kausitaka Grhyasūtra, which is attributed to Sambavya, has five chapters and is almost a replica of the original Sänk häjana. Grhjasūtra But perhaps the most important Grhy asūtra belong ing to the Rgveda is the Assalajana-Griyasūtra It consists of fout chapters and its author is traditionally believed to be Saunaka's pupil Asyalāyana A few other unpublished Grhyasūtras of the

Grhyapancihā It is also called Laugāksi-Grhy asi tra 
From among the Giljasūtras belonging to the Sāmaseda, the Gobhila-Grhy asūtra presupposes, besides the Samaeda-Samhitā, a collection of mantras known as the Mantra-Brāhmana. It seems that the Grhijasūtra and the Mantra-Brāhmana were compo sed side by side and in accordance with a common plan The Khădıra-Grhijasūtra, which is almost identical with the Dráhya yana-Grhyasūtra-Vrit, is presumably an abridgement of the Gobhila-Grhy asūtra The Jaimma-Grhyasūtra, which is divided into pūriam (24 Alandas) and uttarain (9 khandas ), seems to presuppose the Jaiminija-Samhita of the Sāmajeda The so called Kauthtima-Grhja of the Samayeda is a corrupt text show og signs of lateness Two other Grliyasūtras of the Sāmaseda, Damely, the Gautama and the Chándogja, are not published but are referred to in other texts The Kausika-Sutra, which belongs to the Saunaka sākha of the Atharray cda, is traditionally regarded as the Grhyasūtra of that Veda But apart from the grhja mites this Süfra deals with the various magical practices of the Athana veda It is suggested that the Kausiha Sūtra represents a mixture of two separate Sūtras, namely, the Atharia Sūtra and the Grhya 
Sūtra 
Compared to the Srautasūtras and the Grhyasūtras, the Dharmasūtras which have become available till now are very few in number It may, however, be pointed out that, besides the Dharmasūtra texts, which have been published so far, many other texts belonging to this category have become known through quotations from them in other works It is also possible to presume that some Dharnasūtras are now completely lost There is another significant point about the Dharmasūtras Though the different Dharmasatras are traditionally believed to have been affiliated to different Vedic schools, the influence on them of these specific schools is almost negligible It seems that, while the Sraula and the grlja practices varied-at least in some details - from school to school, social practices, civil and criminal law, and polity which constituted the principal subject matter of the Dharmastitras, had become generally common to the entire Vedic

Aryan community Understandably enough, therefore, the connection between a Dharmrasüfra and any particular Vedic school was often tepuous Witbun a Kalpa-corpos, the Dharma Sūtra usually follows the Grhy asūtra It may also be noted that many topics, such as the asramadharmas, are common to the Grhy arītra and the Dharrasītra The arrangement of the sobxect-matter in the Dharmasüfras annot be said to be at all orderly, but, in the light of the classification of topics in some of the later metrial Smrtis, it is possible to classify the topics in the Dharrasītras also under three main beads, namely, ācāra, parahira (bich includes rājad.arma ), 2nd prājascita. As for the literary form of the Dharmasútras it may be mentioned that, with the exception of the Gautama-Dharmasútra and the Vallha rosa-Dharmashtra, they contain sūtras interspersed with metrical passages 
Only six texts, which may be characterised as Dharmasītras, have been published so far Perhaps the best known among them is the Gautamo-Dharmashtra Presumably it is also the earliest. The Gautcma-Dharmasūtra, which consists of 28 chapters, belongs to the Sõnareda Though there is nothing specifically sāmavedic about this Sūtra, it may be noted that its entire twenty-seth chapter is taken from the Samaridiāne-Brol.mona of the Samoreda 
Three facts, namely, that the word jarara occurs in thus Sūtra, that the only teacher of Dharmasastra mentioned by name in it is Mand, and that Gautama as a teacher of Dharma is referred to in the Bavdhājara-Dharmasūtra, are usually adduced m connection with the date of the Gautama-Dharn.asūtra But these facts aan hardly be regarded as constitutiog any conclusive evidence, either singly or cumulatively The Baudrājana-Dharmashtra, which contains four pranas, forms part of the Baudhājana-Kalpasitra It is, however, doubtful whether Baudhayana is personally the author of this Sufra, for he is referred to in the Sufra in the third person and as Bhagavān Baudhyana, The 28th and the 29th prasnas of the pastamba-Kalpasūtra form the Dharn sart of that school There are many indications to show that the Grhrashtra apd the Dharmrasūtra of the Apestämba school, are

from the same hand The so-called Sarjāsādha-Hiranyake$i Dharmasūtra ( which corresponds to the 26th and the 27th prasnas of the Satyasadha-Kalpasutra) is almost identical with the Apa stamba-Dharmasüfra This fact would suggest that the Satya sādha-Hiranyakeśın school did bot originally have any Dharma sutra of its own, but that, in order to complete its Kalpa-corpus, it adopted the Dharmasūtra of the Āpastamba school as its own Dharmasutra 
Tbe Vasistha-Dharmasūtra, in its most common version, has 30 chapters, out of which the first twenty-three form the original part of the Sūtra wbile the last seven āre a later addition in its present form this Dharmasūtra is full of repetitions and even inconsistencies Vasistha, who is presumably the author of this Sūtra, is referred to as an authority on Dharma in the Asanusmrti and the Yājñiavalkjasmrti, but bis relationship with the Rgvedic seer of that name is uncertain The Vaikhānasa-Dharmasūtrd, which is made up of praśnas 8-10 of the Vaikhanasa-Smārlasūtra, deals, more or less exclusively, with the varnásramadharmas It is closely related to the Manusmrti, but it does not have any sections on rājadharnia and śāddha It is customary to include the Visnusmrti, which is also called Visnu-Dharmaśāstra in the colophons of some of its manuscripts, among the Dharmasutras The Visnusmrti consists of 100 chapters, and, as its name suggests, it claims divine authorship Many of its verses are found also in the Manusmrtı It is suggested that this work originally belonged to the Kathaka sākha of the Krsna-Yajurieda and was later redacted by a Vaistava author Actually, however, it seems to be a loose compendium on Dharmaśāstra, produced in the period of transition from the Dharmasūtras to metrical Smrtis 
Broadly speaking, the Dharmaśāstras or metrical Smrns re present a later stage 10 the evolution of the literature on Dharma Sastra than the Dharmasūtras But it cannot be assumed on this account that every Smrt had a Dharnasūtra for its basis or that exery Dluumasutra gave rise, 15 course of time, io a metrical Smrit This point received special relevance in connection with the problem relating to the Manuısmrt, and the Mānara Dharmasūtra It

was suggested that the present Janusmrti was a metrical redaction of the Manara-Dharmasutra which belonged to the Maitrāyani Salka of the Krsna-Yajurveda But no Vānasa-Dharmasūtra has become actually available so far Nor is it esen mentioned a any other work. Various arguments have, therefore, been advanced to prove that a Mänava-Dharmasūtra must have once cxisted, but that it must have been lost in course of time There have also been counter-arguments to disprove the existence of a Järava-Dharmasürra However after a critical consideration of these arguments and counter-arguments, one is inclined to con. clude that aeither of them are conclusive enough, and that, there fore, thus question will have to be regarded as an open question 
By and large, the entire Vedic literature - whether apauru seja or paurusega - may be said to be directly religious in charac ter As against this, the post-Vedic Sanskrit Literature is by 10 means homogeneous from the point of view of either form or contents Religion 15 but one of the many fields which this Literature covers -though, one may perhaps hasten to add, there 15 hardly any ancient or medieval Sansknt text, even among those belonging to the avowedly secular type, which is not religion oriented in one sense or another Another point may be noted here We have dealt with the Vedic literature in a more or less regular chronoloncal order The logical and chronological sequence which characterises the various Vedic periods, 15, however, absent in the post-Vedic Sanskrit literary periods Ve have, therefore, to consider the post-Yedic Sansknt religious texts, not chronologically but 10 groups formed in accordance with their contents and tecdencies 
A reference has already been made to the four ideological movements which were ushered in during the interregnum follow ing the penod of the major Upanisads It is with the literature relating to the movement bich proved to be of the greatest consequence in the history of India, namely, Hinduism, that we are concerned here The main characteristics of this new religious movement may be broadly set forth as follows The indigenous popular gods, like Siva and Visou the latter in his

various incarnations ), superseded the Vedic gods like Indra and Varuna The doctrine of Bhaktı or devotion to a Personal God began to prevail, and the different religious practices associated with it, such as pūjā, replaced the Vedic saçtıficial ritual The ideal of social solidarity (lokasamgraha) was given as much importance as the Upanisadıc self realisation (ārmajñāna) Consequently, Karmayoga came to be encouraged as against Samnyāsa The response of Hinduism to the external and internal challenges was one of gradual assimilation and adaptation rather than of opposition and isolation, and the tendency to synthesise various religious practices and philosophical doctrines into a single harmonious way of life and thought became prominent A mention may be made also of the new polity and statecraft which came to be sponsored 
The influence of some of these trends in Hinduism becomes evident even in the ancillary texts of the different Vedic schools, like the Parisistas, the Prayogas, and the Paddhalıs, which, of course, belong to a fairly late date The Vaikhanasa-Sūtras, for instance, which claim to belong to a school of the Yajurveda, are actually related to a Vaşnava sect in South India Similarly, the Baudhājana Grlyaparısıstasūtra deals with some aspects of Visnu-pājā Such texts, though ostensibly Vedic, have taken over many of the non-Vedic beliefs and practices 
But the characteristics of Hinduism, which have been set forth above, are best reflected in the Bhagavadgitā, which may, indeed, be regarded as the principal scripture of this new religious ideology,33 as also in the character of Krsna as portrayed in India's great epic Mahābhārata The Alahābhārata is, in many Seoses, a unique literary phenomenon It is by far the biggest single literary work known to man The vastness of its extent is aptly matched by the encyclopaedic nature of its contents and the universality of its appeal The claim is traditionally made, and fully justified, that 'in matters pertaining to dharma (relie gion and ethics ), artha (material progress and prosperity },

kama (enjoyment of the pleasures of personal and social life), and noksa ( spiritual emancipation), whatever is found in this epic may be found elsewhere, but what is not found in it it will be impossible to find anywhere else. The Vahābhārata, as we know it today, is the outcome of a long process of addition, assimila tion, exposion, revision, and redaction Presumably, it ongna cated as a bardic-historical poem, called Joya, having the eventful Bhārata-war as its central theme in course of time, a large amount of material belonging to the uterary tradition of the Sītas, which had been developing side by side with the montra tradition embodied in the Vedic literature, came to be added to the histonaal poem, thereby transforming it into the epic Bharato But this transformation of the Jaja into the Bharata recensed added momentum from another and, from our point of vier, more significant factor, namely, the rise of Krscaite Hinduism. The protagonists of this religion realised that the bardic poem, 
bich had been enjoying Wide carteDC), would serve as the most eficient vehicle for the propagation of their ideology They, therefore, redacted that poem in such a way that the Bhagavadgitā became the cornerstone of the new epic superstructure with Krsoa as its central character Upon thus new literary product, called Blārata, which had dermed its bardic-histoncal elements from the ancient Sūla-tradition and its religio-ethical elements from Krsnaite Hinduism, there came to be gradually superimposed elements derived from the Brahmagic learning and culture as also from the other aspects of Hinduism The result was that the Bharata became the Jahabharata It is, indeed, on account of the contributions of Krtcaism, Brabrcanum, and the larger Hinduism that the Fotābhārala has become a veritable treasure-house of religious beliefs and practices 
The Vahabharata, which must have assumed its present form doring the first centuries before and after Christ, is traditionally believed to consist of 100,000 stanzas divided into 18 partans Some of its typical religious sections are the Süryanarrāsta

śataka (Āranyakaparvan ), the Sanatsujātija (Udyogaparvan ), the Bhagavadgita and the Vasudevastuti (Bhismoaparvan ), the Satarudrija (Dronaparvan), the Jāpakopākhyāna, the Nārāyaniya, and the Uñchairtly upākhyāna (Santiparvan), the Snasahasra. nāmastotra, the Gangāstava, and the Vis usahasranāmastotra (Anušāsanaparvan), and the Isvarastutt and the Amugitā (ĀŠva medhikaparvan) A mention may be made in this context also of the Harivainsa, which is traditionally regarded as a Ahilaparvan of the great epic 
If the Mahabharata (with the Harnamsa) glorifies the Krsna incarnation, the other epic, the Ramājana, gives an account of the Rāma incarnation This incarnation is traditionally believed to have been earlier than the Krsna-incarnation, but the composition of the Rāmāyana, which is largely the work of a siogle poet aamed Vālmīkı, seems to have begun after that of the Mahābhārata and to have been completed before the Mahābhārata had assumed its final form The Ayodhyā episode in the Rama yapa probably has some historical basis But, with the exile of Rāma, the theme of the poem is enlarged to epic proportions, and the prioce of Ayodhyā becomes transformed into the leader of the Aryan expansion to the South and eventually into an incarnation of the highest god Cleverly interwoven with these two strands is a third strand, namely, that of an agricultural myth Compared with the Mahābhārata, the Ramayana presents a more voitary structure, not being too much overloaded with extraneous Sautic material, it is also distinguished by several features of classical Sanskrit poetry The Ramayana consists of seven kändas the entire seventh kända being evidently a later interpolation It contains several sections of religious significance, such as the Sürya stava ( also called Aditya hrdaya) by Agastya and the Råmastuti by Brahmā (both in the Yuddhakānda) Its principal religious appeal, however, springs from the idealısed domestic and social virtues which its characters embody Indeed, this appeal has proved to be more direct and sustained through the centuries

among them having been accomplished not before the age of the Guptas But, from the point of view of the major part of their subject-matter, they belong to the ancient literary tradı tion of the Sūtas, which is also fcown as the itibāsa-purana tradition. It is customary to divide the infasa-furora Litera ture into three broad classes, namely, māsa or epic history (represented by the Mahabharata ), Larya or epic poetry (re presented by the Rārājara), and purana or epic legends (represented by the Purānas) A Purana is traditionally defined as comprisidg five main topics, pamely, sargo (creation), prali sarga ( dissolution and re-creation ), romsa (diyine genealogies), maryantara ( ages of Manus), and ramsyān.canta (genealogies of kings. It would be seen from this definition that the Purēnas, in their onginal form, had very little to do with religious beliefs and practices as such But code of the Puranas as we know them today strictly adheres to the definition of five topics mentio ned above (parcalal sana), actually these topics do not cover toore than one forureth portion of the estact Purana Nor does any Purāna strictly adhere even to the definition of ten topics (dasalaksana) which are made up by adding five more topics, camely, vrtu ( means of livelihood), ral si (10camatiods of gods ), men (final emancipation), retu (hving beings) and apăsraya (Brahman) It is the subjects shich came to be incorporated into the Puranas in the course of their growth, such as those relating to religious instruction, sectarian cults, ritual, dāna, vrata, Tirtha, srčddna, bhaka yoga, aratēra etc., which have given them their truly religious character and have thereby confirmed their claim to be the Veda of the common people.

One may refer here also to some other works, which are significant from the religious point of view The Brhatsamhıtā of Varāhamshira ( 550 A D ), though a work on astronomy and astrology, is almost encyclopaedic in scope, and contains much material of a religious character, such as details of private and public worship, temple architecture, iconography, and works of charity The Adliyātma-Ramājana (15th century), which is a part of the Brahmanda Purana, is usually treated as an indepen dent work An attempt is made in this work to superimpose monistic Vedānta on the doctrine of devotion to Rāma The more important among the manuals dealing with Bhakti are the Bhaktı-Sutras of Nárada (10th century), the Bhaktı-Sutras of Sandilya (earlier than the 10ch century), the Bhakti-Rainavalı (1400 A D ), which is an anthology compiled by Visnupuri of passages from the Bhagavata-Purāna relating to Bhakti, and the Bhaktardhini of Vallabha Several imitations of the Bhagavad.

The Dharmasastras or Smris are religious in character and purport more or less to the same ettent as the Dharmastras They may be said to bile presened the traditional rules governing man's persocal, domestic, and social behaviour Easıly the best known work of this type is the Varusmrti The Vammrti or the Bhrguaritā, which seems to have belonged to the penod when the Valābhārata was undergoing its final redaction, consists of twelve chapters It begins with a statement regarding the process of creation, and then proceeds to lay down, 19 the nest five chapters, the rules of conduct for persons belongog to the different social orders ( rarras) and the different stages of life (āsamas ) It then goes on to discuss the duties of lugs (rajadharma) where, in connection with the admjaustration of justice, it deals at some length with the 18 titles of law It ends with the mention of some erpatory ntes (prājaścittas ) and a de sultory discussion of a few philosophical topics like karma, gunas, etc The other Smrlis mostly follow the patter of the rarnasama dharma as laid down in the Jarusnirti It is only in the matter of Jatakāra (cy and criminal law ) that these lan-books appear to differ from one another For instance, the Yājrarak jasiritt, which belongs to the 4th-5th centuries A D and which is divided into three clear-cut sections, namely, acara (religious Law), rjasahāra (av ard criminal lan ), and pray ascitia (erpua tion), puts greater stress upon prate lan than opon criminal law and shows great advance over the Varusini 10 the law of inheritance An interesting work of the nature of a Digest of Law is the Caturrargacintärrani of Hemadr ( 1260-1309 A. D) It deals, in a special manner, with vanous topics of religious significance such as rratas, donas, pilgrimages, rāduhas, and ritual 
Generally speaking in ancient and medieval Indıa, rebgion and philosophy were not sharply demarcated But the literature

relating to the various Hindu systems of philosophy - usually considered in its three principal classes, namely, the Sūtras, expository works on the Sütros, and independent treatises - Day be said to have developed almost independently of what is normally understood as religion That literature is also quite extensive It may, therefore, be left out of this survey of religious literature The ethico didactic literature in Sanskrit (as also not a little of the poetical and dramatic literature) may be characteri sed as religious so far as its theme and ultimate purpose are concerned However, for obvious reasons, this literature too cannot be dealt with here But due potice must needs be taken of the two types of literature in Sanskrit, which are distinctively religious in character, namely, the Tantras and the Stotras 
Tantra is a generic term denoting the literature of certain religious cults which seem to have begun to become prominent witliin Hinduism (and, for that matter also within Buddhism) from 500 A D onwards This literature did not necessarily arise to oppose the Vedas which claimed some kind of formal authority in respect of Hinduism It only averred that, while the Vedas were all right for the earlier ages, their doctrines and practices had lost their appeal 10 the Kaliyuga The Tantras, therefore, took the place of the Vedas as the authoritative religious literature of the new age In a sense, the Tantras claimed to do with reference to Brahmanic Hinduism what Brahmanic Hinduism had done with reference to Vedism Paradoxically, however, while the Taniras, on the one hand, sought to democratise Hinduism by removiog the barriers of sex and caste ro the matter of religion, on the other hand, they laid down strict rules regarding the initiation of the sõdhakas into their secret doctrines and practices 
Tantra is fancifully defined in the kāmikāgama as follows 
fanoti vipulān arthän tathamantrasamāśrutan/ 
frānam ca kurute jasmat tantram ity abhidhijate // The Tantras comprise esoteric teachings and mystic-magical practices of various kinds Their dogma and ethics are more or less similar to those of Brahmanic Hioduism But their distractive

feature is their religious practices which include mantra (magi cally potent formula ), bija (mystical letter or syllable which forms an essential element of the mantra), Jantra ( mystical diagram), nyasa (mental appropriatod or assignment of various parts of the body to tutelary derties ), mudrå (particular positions or inter twinings of the fingers ), mandala ( mystical diagram without bija ketters ), jāga ( sacrifice ), Joga (meditation ), upasarā (worshup). pētra ( going on a pilgrimage ), etc The Taniras also deal with the various details of pājā apd orgastic rites as also of tetaple architecture and iconography Many of the late sectarian Upani sads, which have been referred to abose, are of the nature of Tantras, similarly the influence of the Terras on some of the Puranas quite unmistakable A Tarira-text, whose authorship is usually anonymous, normally consists of four parts or padas which deal respectively with ridja or jñāra (soteriological theo logy), I nijā (practices of the cult), carjā (personal and social behaviour), and yoga (psychophysiological discipline ) Unlike the Veda the Tantras, whose number 15 indeed, large, are empha tically sectanan in character They relate mainly to the three sects - Saiva, Vaisnava, and Säkta - and the tantric texts belonging to these sects are respectively called Āgamas, Samhıtās, and Tantras It is generally believed that the Agamas originated in Kashmir, the Samhitas in various parts of India, particularly Bengal and South India and the Tartras in Bengal and Eastern and North-Eastern India 
In the Sabdalalpadruma the follosing definition, again fanc ful, of Agama is gisen: 
agatam. pañcoraktāt tu gatam ca giryjänane / 
matam ca rāsuderasja tasmad āgamam ucjate ll There are 28 Saiva Āgarrias which are traditionally telieved to bave originated from the five mouths of Siva - five, pamely, Kamila, Yogaja, Cmija, Kārana, and Anna, from the sadyojata mouth, five, namely, Dipta, Salsma, Sahasra, amsumar, and Suprabheda, from the rāmadera mouth, five, namely, Vijaya, Misräsa, Srirambhura, a nala, and Vira from the aghora mouth, five, namely, Raurara, Afaluta, Vimala, Cardrajrana, and Bimba,

from the fatpurusa mouth, and eight, namely, Prodgita, Lalita, Siddha, Santana, Sarıohta, Paramešvara, Airana, and Vatula, from the isāna mouth As many as 207 Upāgamas are also mentioned Further, there exists, by the side of the basic Āgamas, an abun dant literature pertaining to the Saiva ritual produced by such teachers as Aghorasivācārya and Somasambhu The epoch of the redaction of the Agamas is uncertain, but they have been profusely used by Tirumular and other Tamil writers and must have accordingly belonged to a period not later than the seventh century AD These texts have been carefully presened in the families of Gurukkals who use them 10 connection with their religious rites The tradition of temple architecture and icono graphy as taught in the Saiva Agamas is still living A reference may also be made to the deep influence which these Āgamas are seen to have exercised in the ancient kingdoms of South-East Asia 
The principal Tantric Vaisnava cult is known as Pancarātra The name Pañcarásra is variously interpreted,38 but it seems best to understand it as alluding to the five nights during which five discourses were given by Nārāyana respectively to Siva, Brahmā, Indra, the Rsis, and Brhaspati Traditionally, 108 Samhitās of the Pāñcarātra are mentioned, though their number is sometimes given as 215 or even 290 The entire corpus of the Páscarātra literature is believed to consist of 11/2 crores of verses Among the Pāñcaratra Samutās, which are variously referred to as Elāyana-Veda or Mula Veda or Müla Sruti or Pancama-Veda or Malopanısad, some are specially honoured For instance, the Satriata., the Pauskara-, and the Jayākhya Sanitās are said to constitute the Ratnatraji (jewel triad) But on account of ils being the first to have received a critical treatment in modern times the Ahurbudlya-Samlıă has perhaps become better known This Samutã is believed to have been produced in Kashmir 10 carly fifth century AD It devotes its major part to the dis cussion of kry and carsi rather than to viāna and yoge in Sac

section, however, it presents an interesting survey of vanous systems of religion and philosophy The Ratnatrazi mentioned above is presumably older tban the Alırbudium a-Samhitā - the Sättrata-Samhitā being perhaps the oldest (3rd century) Among the other well-known Sanhitās are the Israra (which is perhaps One of the earlier ones produced in South India and which is quoted by Rámānuja's teacher Yāmuda), the Parama (bich, together with the Pauslara, es quoted by Rāmánuja ), the Brhad. brhama ( which is beliesed to belong to that is koonn as Mārada Parcarātra and which contains prophesies regarding Rāmānuja and most therefore be later than the 12th century), the rang mrtesāra ( which also belongs to the Nārada-Picarátra and wbuch contains the glonfiction of Kosnu and Rādha and is thus close to the Vallabha-system), the Kāsj apa, the Pārameara, and the Lalsi 
Side by side with the Paparātra, there also developed the Tantric Vaisnava cult known as Vaikhāna sa The Vaisnava temples in South India, and to a certain extent, in Ransthan and Orissa, are governed either by the Pancarātra canons or by the Vaikhānasa canons For instance, the religious rites at the Varadaraja temple at Kanchi and the Sriranganātha temple at Srirangam are performed according to the Pãöcarātra, while those at the Venkateswara temple at Tirupati are performed according to the Vaikhānasa (though, curiously enough, at the temple of Venkatarara's consort Padmívati the rites are performed accord ing to the Patcarátra) Similarly, some specific Samhras are regarded as authontative at specific temples, as, for fastance, the Pauskara and the Pāramesrara at the Sriranganātha temple the Jajākhye and the Pādre at the Varadaraja temple, and the Sālirata and the Thara at Melkote- though the Padma-Samhita is seen generally to govern the Vaisdava pijā 
Though the Silta Tantras are traditionally believed to exist in three groups of 61 terts each, their actunt number as known from several manuscript-catalogues, is very much larger 
The chronology of the Tantras is difficult to determine, but it may be pointed out that there are codications of the influence of the 
368 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
Tantras even in the Mahābhārata and that some elements of the Tantras have been epigraphically documented since 424 A D The more important of the Tantras have originated in the Kaula school The Mahānınana-Tantra, which is perhaps only next to the Bhagavadgitâ in popularity, is a late work (18th century) presumably produced in Bengal It may be regarded as present ung the Sākta doctrine and practices in the most representative manner The Brabman is identified with Saktı, the ultimate principle having to be necessarily female Among other topics dealt with in this Tantra are pañcataliya, pañca-malara, cakra püja,*9 symbolic meditation on Sakti, etc Its metaphysics is not different from the Sankhya and the Vedānta, and its dharma ( social ethics) seems to have been adopted from the Manu smirti 
The Kulārnava-Tantra speaks of six forms of acāra, but emphasizes that moksa is possible only through the acăra as ordained by kula It also insists that the five maloras must not be employed except in strictly esoteric circles From among the other Tantras may be mentioned the Tantrarāja (which, in its first part, deals with the Sriyantra), the Kulacūdā mani (which serves as a popular manual on Tantric ritual), the Prapancasāra (which discusses the essence of universe'), the Jānārnava ( which regards humārīpājana as the highest sacrifice ). the Saradanlaka (which expounds the esoteric significance of mantras and ; antras ), the Yogini ( which includes the māhāimya of the Kāmākhyā temple), and the Gandharia (which speaks of idols) Some of the other important sākta texts are the Sricakra sambhāra, the Kāmakalāvläsa, the Advaitabhāvopanısad and the Satcakra nırīpana A mention may be made in this context also of the Deilmalämja ( 6th century), which is included in the Märkandeja-purāna, in which Devi is glorified as the eternal Universal Mother, and the commentary on wbich, called Dašinga, gives a detailed description of the Sikta pājā, the Devi-Bhagavata.

Purāra (1100 A.D ), which is a sākta counterpart of the Vaisnava Bhāgorata-Purāna, and the Adbhuta-Rāmāyana, which is obviously a late work and in which the Saku-cult is sought to be introduced into Vaisnavism by elevating Sith over Rāma 
The Stotra-literature in Sanskrit is very rast Indeed, one wonders whether any proper count has ever been made or can be made of the works belonging to this class This literature must also be said to enjoy the widest currency among the people The tradition of prayers and hymns in India is quite ancient and may be traced back to the Rgreda Stotras bave been included in the epics, the Purānas and the Tantras Some epic poems also contain fine specimens of hymaal poetry, such as, for instance, the hymn to Visnu (Raghuramsa X), to Brahmi (Rumāra. sambhara III ), to Mahadeva (Kırātārrun ja, closing canto), to Krsna (Sisupalaradha XIV), and to Candi (Haravijaja XLVII). In a sense, the Nard-verses in Sanskrit dramas may also be regarded as religious lyrics But the targer part of the Stotra literature seems to have been produced independently Apart from single works of more or less definite authorship, many collections of Stotras - a large cumber of these Stotras being of anonymous authorship - are available in priat, such as, for instance, the Brhaistotramuktahāra, the two Brhatstotraratråloras, and some of the Gucchakas of the Kārjamā la 
The major Stotras usually relate to the five Hinda diyinities namely, Ganapatı, Sürya, Siva Sakti, and Visau - Siva perhaps being most commonly praised and prayed to Then there are Staras addressed to the ten incarnations of Vista, either indi vidually or collectively A substantial cumber of Stotras are agam addressed to what may be called localised disinities, like Venkatesa of Tirupati, Mināksī of Madura Vivanātha of Vara. nası, and Srirangapatha of Srirangam Minor divinities like Sasthi Sitala, and Manasā, rivers, and holy places also bave their share of Stotras Stotras possess a twofold appeal, religious and literary, but it may be added that barning a few noteworthy erceptions, the majority of Stotras are known for their religious appeal rather than for their lyricism And even this religious370 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDVISM 
appeal is characterised by a conventionalised idiom rather than by a genuine effusion of religious emotion 
One of the early Stotras is attributed to Bāna ( 7th century) It is the Candidataka which consists of 102 verses, mostly in the sragdharā metre, in praise of Mahisāsuranardini The Surya. Sataka by Bāna's contemporary and close relative Mayūra has, however, received a greater approbation from literary critics Traditionally, the great Sankarācārya is said to bave composed nearly 200 Stotras, out of which at least some like the Ananda lahari (consisting of 20 sikharini verses ), the Saundary alahari (containing 103 Sikharını verses - the last verse being in the vasanta tilakā – in praise of Saktı), the Mohamudgara (also known as the Dvadasapañjarikā), the Bhaja Govindam (also known as the Carpatapanjari), the Harimide, and the Slāparādha-K'samāpana may be said to betray the touch of the master In most of these, devotional fervour is very well matched by poetic elegance, and deep nysticism by musical rhythm The Pancasari describes the plıysical charms of Kápáksi in erotic terms, and is ascribed to poet Mūka who is believed to have been a contemporary of Sankara The Styamahimnahstotra ascribed to Puspadanta (9th century ?) is perhaps more philosophical than religious in its tenor, and can boast of over 20 commentaries To almost the same period belongs the Devisataka of Anandavardhana ( 850 A D ), which seems to have been planned rather as an essay in alamhāras than as a religious hymn A reference may be made here also to the hymnal literature produced by other Kashmirian poets, such as the Slavacintamani of Bhatta Nārāyana (8th century), the Snastofrāsali of Utpaladeva (10th century), the Bhavopahāra of Cakrapaninātha (11th century ?), and the Ardha. nāristarastotra of Kalbana (12th century) The Samba pañcāsıkā, which is a hymn to the sun god and which is traditionally attri buted to Kssna's son Simba, is also probably the work of a Kashmirian poet 
Coming down from Kashmir to Kerala one may mention the Mukundamālā of Kulasekhara ( 11th century ?), which is a small work consisting of about 30 verses (the number of verses varies

in different sersions ), but which is remarkable for the devotional earnestness and the sense of stytle of the author The Nārāyanija of Nārāyata Bhatta of Kerala (1585 AD) on the other hand, 15 an extensive poem of 1000 verses, which is laboured both in form and contert It glorifies Krsca of Guruvayur, who is said to have cured the author of his asthma of the Stotra-texts belong. ing to the Voistadvaita school may be mentioned the Stotraratna of Yámupācārya ( 11th century), the Gadjatraja of Rāmánuja ( 11th - 12th century), and the Ajāsadasaka and the Asrabhu ástala of Vedāntadesika The five Laharis (Amrta, Sudha Gangā, Karunā, and Laksmi-) of Jagannātha Pandita (17th century) present a pleasing combination of sincere der otion, deep learning, and great poetic ability Nilakantha Diksita of about the same period has wntten a hymn to Mināksi called Ananda sāgarastaa, whule bis popil Ramabhadra is responsible for three poemas in praise of Rima's various weapons as also for the Varnamālastotra hich is an alphabetically arranged eulogy of Rāma A special mention may be made in this context also of the hymnal literature produced in connection with the Catanya movement, such as the Sił sāstaka of Gauranga himself (15th century), the Staramālā of Rūpa-Gosvamin, and the Starāralı of Raghunāthadāsa 
Besides prayers and hymns, some typical specimens of which hase been mentioned above there bas been produced in Sansknt not an unconsiderable amount of deliberately artistic religious poetry "The inspiration for this kind of poetry may be said to have been derived mainly from the Bhagarata-Purano The Krsnakarnāmrla of Lizsaka also knord as Bilsamangala (11th century) is a strik og collection of devotional lyrics in which the sentiment of bhakn for the youthful Krsna is expressed through religio erotic idiom and imagery The work bas come down in two main recepsions - the south-western recension consisting of three asasas of over 100 verses each, and the Bengal recepsion consisting of only one āsāsa of 112 verses The Guagovinda of Jayadeva (12th century) is a unique work so seseral respects It presents a series of what may be called musical monologues or

three characters - Krsna, Radhā, and her companion - on the background of the rāsakrida in Vrndāvana Its central theme is that rāsa, the realisation of blissful personal communion with the Lord, is the final goal of all religious activity, and this theme is vivified by Jayadeva through his masterly exploitation of the media of poetry, nusic, and gesture dance (abhinaya) The Gitagovinda, which is variously characterised as a lyric drama or a pastoral or an opera or a melodrama or a järra, consists of 12 cantos, each canto containing padávalis or songs set to different rāgas These songs are introduced by one or two metrical stanzas which seem to have been intended to be sung in chorus The great popula rity of the Gitagovında is vouched for by its several imitations In some of these Rāma and Sitā or Sıva and Parvati take the place of Krsna and Rādha The Singararasamandana by Vallabhā. cārya's son Vitthaleśvara ( 15th century) contains songs modelled on Jayadeva's compositions Another work, namely, the Krsnali lūtarangini by Nārāyanatirtba (1700 A D ), also contains devotional lyrics set to different rägas But the truly glorious period of Sanskrit religious poetry-or, for that matter, of Sanskrit poetry in general - must be said to have ended with Jayadeva bimself
