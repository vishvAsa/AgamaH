## A BROAD OUTLINE 
It has been observed that the basic dogma of the Sophists, whose important role in the history of the Western philosophical thought must not be underestimated, is best represented in the momentous words of Protagoras ( 500 BC), namely, Man is the measure of all things' It bas been further observed that this dogma of theirs has held good in the West ever since If the Iodian philosophical thought anywhere differs pronouncedly from the Western philosophical thought it is, indeed, in this very respect For, the most distject ve feature of the speculative Wis dom of the Indians is its essentially cosmic character According to lodian thinkers, from the ultimate philosoplucal point of view, man cannot be regarded as, in any way, standing apart from the universe, much less as enjoying any preponderance at Their speculations have, therefore, never tended to become anthropo centric They look upon man just as part aod parcel of the Universe - just as one of the maoy forms in which the Supreme Being is manifested in this universe As the seer of the Brhadaranjaka Upanisad' has put in a very telling manner, '(The essential self or the vital essence in man, atman), is the same as that in ant, the same as that in gnat, the same as that in elephant, the same as that in these three worlds indeed, the same as that in the whole unterse: It will be accordingly seen that the dualism between * man and other things in the unrerse, wbich is implied in the words of Protagoras, does not find countenance in the early Iodiad thought. A proper understanding of this ancient cosmic ontlook would serve as an adequate background for a correct estimate of the role of man in Hinduism For, that outlook has deeply influenced the Hindu concepts regarding man's relations with himself, with god, and with the world

The constant exhortation of the Upanısadıc teachers is " Knon thuself" The philosophical implication of this exhorta tion is that the real' man is something different from the man who moves about, acts has various erperiences, in short, Inves" in this phenomenal world In other words, the essential or real sell (ärman) is different from the empirical self (ira) It further implies that the true philosophical knowledge consists in not confusing the one with the other This is evactly the moral of the very famous parable in the Chandogj a Upanisad: Once upon a time, the Upanisad tells us, the gods and the demons became anvous to learn the nature of the essential self, for, at was made known that whosoever knew that self which is free from sin, free from old age, free from death and grief, free from bunger and thirst, which desires nothing and imagines nothog' would win all the worlds So gods sent Indra and the demoos Virocana as their representatives to acquire its loowledge from Praūpati They both lived with Prajapati as his pupils for a period of thirty-two years - this long apprenticeship being a necessary precondition for the great spiritual truth being impart ed to them But, even after this apprenticeship was over, Praju pat would not immediately communicate to them the final truth, He wanted to test their capacity to understand as also their cri tical acumen He, therefore, first told them that the essential self was nothing different from the image that we saw in our eyel which means in simpler language, that the essential self was the same as the embodied self in the condition of wakefulness (ägrat ), when it was conscious of external objects and enjoyed the gross things Thereupon Indra and Virocana became com placeat in the belief that they had understood the truc nature of the essential self Virocana hurried back to the demons and proclaimed that he had acquired the ultimate knowledge which he bad sought from Prajapati At this stage, the Uranı sad slyly adds that those who believe in the identity of the essential self with the bodily consciousness have learnt only the gospel of the demons' lodra was, however, too clever and critical to be satisfied with

this gospel He thought to himself If this body were actually identical with the essential sell, the characteristics of the self, which were made koond to him, pamely, that it was free from fear, sin, old age, death, etc, would prove to be false For, was the body not subjected to fear, old age, death, etc ? Indra, there fore, concluded that there was po glory in possessing that know ledge His thirst for true koonledge was, however, not quenched. So he again went back to Prajapatt Prajāpatı asked him to serve another term of apprenticeship for a period of thirty-two years, At the end of that period, Prajāpati told Indra that the essential self was identical with the self in the condition of dream (stopno ), when the self was not affected by the limitations and characteristics of the body, and when, because only the mind was actise, the self was conscious only of internal objects and enjoyed the subtle things This teaching certainly represented an advance over the earlier one Botesen so it could not satisfy Indra He bethought himself In the state of dreaming, the self might not be affected by the limitations and characteristics of the body, but it was still infoenced by the limitations and characteristics of the mud For, did we not feel as if we were struck or chased 10 oor dream? Did He not experience pain and shed tears? How could this be reconciled with the fearless and painless nature of the self? So, undaunted in his spiritual quest Lodra weot to Prajāpate for the third time Prajapati must have, indeed, been satisfied that Indra was a worthy pupil. After the usual terta of studentship of thirty-two years, therefore, he led lodra a step further in the knowledge of the self He told him that tbe essen. tral self was identical with the self in the condition of deep-sleep ( susuph), when neither the body por the mind affected the self, and when it desired no desire and dreamt oo dream 3 This deep-sleep consciousness was, indeed, free from fear and pain, thought Iodra But it could not be identified with the essential self, for, 10 deep-sleep, we were actpally conscious of nothing, neither of ourselves nor of external objects There might be, 10 that state perfect repose and rest, but this repose and rest was

just like the repose and rest of logs of wood Finding this great deficiency in the teaching imparted by Prajapatı, Indra went back to him and again questioned him about the true nature of the essential self Indra had thus proved himself worthy of recening the highest knowledge So Prajā pati asked him to live a student's life with him for a further period - tlus time only of five years On the completion of that period, Prajapati imparted to Indra the highest knowledge about the self The essential self must not be regarded as being identical with bodily consciousness por must it be confused with the dream consciousness It transcends even the deep-sleep condition, though some satimations of its nature are available in that condition The essential self is, in deed, of the nature of pure self-consciousness, which is beyond all bodily and mental conditions 
Through this very suggestive analysis of human conscious ness, some characteristic features of the nature of the essential self are clearly brought out The essential self is identical neither with the body nor with the mind, and is therefore, free from all the limitations, mutations, and experiences to which the body and the mind are liable It is eternal and immutable (sal) As a matter of fact, the distinction between the self on the one hand and the body and senses mind, intellect, and ego on the other is quite fundamental in Hindu thought the essential self must not also be identified with the sum total of perceptions of the senses and conceptions of the mind, though both perceptions and con ceptions necessarily presuppose the existence and the direct apareness ( sāk sita) of the essential self Similarly the essential self never becomes the object of perception and conception in other words, therefore, in the ordinary sense the self is neither the subject or the object nor the act - neither the knower nor the KOORD Ror the knowing in the expression. I know, for instan ce, the essential self is not represented by the word 'l' nor is it represented by the act of knowing But, at the same time, the 
I' and the loowing become impossible without the essential self It must be further pointed out that the esscntial self does not imply the absence of consciousness as in the condition of decp

sleep It is certainly conscious but of nothing else bat itself it is porely and exclusively self-consciOUS (Cu) 
Thus the essential self does exist - 1 is gel--but not as any particular individual conditioned by the limitations of body, mind, intellect, and ego, and is therefore, not subject to any mutations. It is also consc005-cit-but not of any particular object, external or internal, nor is it to be ideotified with the consciousness in any particular state One annot therefore, realise the true nature of the essential self in any of the three states of conscious Dess, namely, wakefuldess (jāgrot), dream ( stapra) agd deep sleep ( sasuptı) it is in a state which transcends these three, that is to say, in the fourth state ( furijārasha), when body and senses, mind, intellect, and ego cease to fuoction, when there is no koowledge of internal objects bor of exterpal ones, por of the two together, when the self is not a mass of intelligence or Inox ledge, transcending as it does both consciouşcess and unconscious Dess, when it is Jovisible, pocommunicable, incomprehensible, 10defioable, that the nature of the essential self as pore self consciousness becomes realisable through self-intuition. 
Besides being of the nature of pure sat (eristence as such) and pure cul (consciousness as such), the essential self is descrr bed as being something more There is another lateresting attempt in the Upanısads to analyse the human personality and thereby attain to the very core or essence of its nature lo this attempt, the seer of the Tautinja-Upanssads proceeds from the grosser forms of the human personality to its subtler forns - It bendg clearly implied that the subiler the form the more real it is. First of all there is the physical body, which is said to be made of food or matter (annamaya) But this cannot be the ultimate or real essence of the human personality For, as the Upansadic teacher tells as, there is, within this physical body, 'another body which is made of vital air (prāramaja), the fomer is filled with the latter, which is also like unto the shape of man' 
4 5

More internal - and, therefore, subtler and more real - than the body made up of vital air is another body made of miod (manomaja) The former is filled with the latter which is again like unto the shape of man More internal still than the mental body is another body which is made of intel ligence or consciousness (viñanamaja) Within this body of intelligence or COnsciousness is the most internal and central of all bodies, namely, the body of bliss (ānandamaya) This last is the subtlest and, therefore, more real than the bodies mentioned earlier It is needless to add that this description is not to be understood in the literal seose It is not intended to suggest that an individual actually possesses five bodies, one within the other, each being 'uke unto the shape of man (purusavidha)' This doctripe, which is known as the doctrine of five sbeaths (Lošas ), represents a sort of symbolic attempt to analyse the human personality into its five basic elements, namely, physical body, Vital breath, mind, intellect or consciousness, and pure bliss It is pointed out here that each succeeding element in the above list is more internal and subtler, and, therefore, more real and essen tial than the preceding one As the result of this analysis, there fore, we arrive at the conclusion that the essential self in man transcends the physical, vital, mental, and intellectual forms” of the human personality, and must be identified with its 100ermost and subtlest form, namely, the beatific form In other words, man realises his essential self in an ecstatic mystic state, where the only experience is that of pure bliss "The ultimate nature of the real or essential self is, therefore, pure existence (sat), pure sell-consciousness (cu), and pure bliss ( ananda ) 
A reference may be made, at this stage, to another current of thought, through which the nature of the essential self came to be further defined Just as, in his philosophical quest, the Upanisadic thinker looked inward' and thus analysed the human personality with a view to attaining the knowledge of the ultimate reality, he also looked' outward' and tried to apaiyse the external universe with a similar purpose 10 view As the result of this latter analysis he came to the conclusion that, at the basis of this 
MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT 
manifold and gross phenomenal world, which was changeful and fleeting by nature, and which was, in the ultimate analysis, a mere bundle of pames and forms ( nôma, rūpa), there lay but one eter aal, immutable, sentient reality & Thus this ultimate cosmic reality, or the cosmic self, which, it was frequently emphasised, was one without a second, was also sat and cut It, therefore, naturally followed that the essential self id man (alman) and the ultimate cosmic reality (brahman) were one and the same This grand philosophical doctrine emphasises the fact that neither the empirical self nor the tangible phenomenal world, with which the empirical self seems to come into contact, possesses any reality from the ultimate point of view 
To recapitulate the true philosophical knowledge consists 10 clearly realising the distinction between the essential self and the empirical self This should not, however, be misunderstood to mean that an individual possesses two selves The real self is actually one, but, under certain conditions, it assumes an indivi duality characterised by a body-mind-intellect complex. The self with an individuality is the mistaken for the real self The real self is, jodeed, distinct from the body and senses, mind, intellect, etc It is neither the doer ( kartā) nor the experiencer (bhoktā), and 15, as a matter of fact, in no way involved in the doings of the phenomenal world It is essentially immutable and eternal dot being governed by the laws of time, space, and causality It is of the nature of sat, cit, aod ananda, and is, on that account to be identified with the ultimate cosmic reality It is finally pointed out that the true nature of the essential self and its identity with the cosmic self can be realised only in an ecstatic, mystic state (turījárastha), which transcends the three normal states of CODsciousness 
This is the most representative view 10 Hinduism about the nature of the essential se'n vad Buti is by no mean the only view There are, for instance, some thinkers, who regard the self as, in a sease, finite and atomic There are others who 
6 
Chundoga U 
VI 1-3 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
believe that the essential self in man is identical with the cosmic self or the Supreme Being only in essence but not in form 
There are still others, who assert that the essential self is distinct from the Supreme Being both in form and essence It is not necessary to examine all these different views at any length It may, however, be pointed out that, in spite of fundamental differences most of them agree in one respect, Damely, in the assumption that the real self is distinct from the body-mind complex 
According to the Hindu view, as the result of the operation of original ignorance or nescience (avidyā), the essential self falls off from its pedestal of serene aloofness and self-lumine scence thereby forgetting, so to say, its identity with the Supreme Being of the ultimate reality, and thus becomes involved in the phenomenal world, which also is, in a sense, a fictitious creation of avdā It may be added, in this connection, that the question as to how and why the original ignorance (avidja) becomes operative is, by its very nature, philosophical. ly inadmissible for philosophical thinking - or, for the matter of that, any thinking - can, strictly speaking, relate only to the conditions consequent upon the operation of avidyā When, before the operation of audzā, there existed only one ultimate reality, who could have been the thinker and what could have been thought ?? Starting on the basis of the philosophically necessary assumption of the operation of adja, we can say that, under the influence of asdjā, the essential self (alman) becomes conditioncd by the limitations of individuality Some aspects of the nature of the individual or the empirical self una) will have already become evident in the discussion regarding the nature of the essential sell The most distiactive characteristic of an individual is his assumption of the body lo Hindu thought the term body' (deha or sarıra ) is understood in a very comprehensive sense and is made to denote all kinds of limitations that are produced by and The empirical self or the individual is, therefore, also called chibodied self ( Särira almă )!

MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT 
The body to which the essential self is supposed to be attached, as the result of the operation of ardia, is, according to the most representative Hindu vies, of three kiods There is first of all the gross physical body (sthala sarira ), which, in view of the fact that it is nounsbed by food, is described as the annamajj hosa referred to above It is regarded as having been produced out of the five elements (parca bhatas), namely, earth (prth77), water (ap), light (rejas), wind (raju), and ether (akása ), and serves as the abode of all the experiences relating to the external world (bhogajarana) It also serves as the basis of the consciousness in the state of wakefulness At the death of an individual only the physical body perishes, that is to say, it dissolves into the five elements out of which it is produced It is, indeed, necessary to emphasise this point namely, that, according to the Hindu vex, death can affect only the physical body and nothing else 
There is then the second body, which is known as the subtle body (sūksma Carira) because it 15 constituted of elemeits far sabtler than the five elements (parica bhūtas ) which produce the sthūla urira These subtle constituents of the sūksma sarira are seveoteen in number -- five pranas or vital breaths (prāna (1o the heart ), arāna (10 the anus), samāna (10 the gavel), udāna (in the throat), and fjóra (diffused in the whole body)], five karmendrijas or organs of action ( speech (rak) band (hasta ), feet (põda), dous (pāju), aad organ of generation ( upastha)), five jñanendriyas or organs of knowledge (ear (sotra), ski (tral), eye (calsu), tongue (ha), and nose ( ghrána), mind (manas OT antahkarana), and intellect (buddhi) Consequently the saksa sarita becomes equivalent to the prānamaja (vital), manomaja (mental), and ruñana maja (intellectual) kosas together It serves as the basis of the dream-consciousness As mentioned above, the vital, mental, and rotellectual functions impled by the suksmo sariro become possible only on account of the presence and the direct anareness of the essential self The sul sma sarira thus senses, in a sense, as the indicatory mark (linga) of the presence of the self, and, is, therefore, also called the Imga-sarira 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
But the most important role of the suksma Sarira is the one played by it in connection with the transmigration of the self from one body to another it has already been pointed out that, at the death of an individual, only his physical body (sthula sarira) perishes That does not, however, mean that death marks the end of individualityThis latter, as we shall see presently, comes with the spiritual realisation by the self of its identity with the ultimate reality in other words, with moksa 
Till then the journey of the self continues through one body or another What we call death is not the terminus, but only a junction where the self changes the body and also perhaps the route of the journey This goes on until the final destination is reached It is believed that the medium by means of which the self cbanges from one physical body into another is the sükşma Sarira Such an assumption is, indeed, philosophically neces sary For, firstly, the self cannot be assumed to leave both the sthūla and the sūksma bodies simultaneously, that would amount to the termination of individuality, in other words, to moksa Secondly, it is the sūksma sariro, which, in a sease, determines the type of the pbysical body to be taken by the self for the next lap of its journey As we shall see later, the body to be assumed by the individual in his each rebirth is conditioned by the moral consequences of the deeds done by him in the prece ding life It is believed that the sūksma sarira serves as a repository of these moral consequences -- direct (phala) as well as sodirect (samshoras ) -- until they have their effect in respect of the individual's rebirth The direct moral consequences of the past deeds determine the actual kind of the physical body to be taken at rebirth and other environments relating to the rebirth, while the indirect moral consequences produce in the individual certain inpate tendencies which prompt him to act in one way or another in other words, therefore, the sük sma Sarira serves as the medium through which the eternal and inexorable law of karma operates 
The third body, which the enpirical self is believed to as sume, is known as tbe karana (capsal) sarira The kôrang Saring 
MAN N HINDU THOUGHT 
becomes evdent in that state of the existence of the individual in 
hich both the physical and the subtle bodies cease to function temporarily, as, for lastacce, in the state of deep-sleep It is ID this body that the individual can get some intimations of the perfect spirtual beatitude Further, the gross and the subtle bodies seem to arise from this body That is why it is called kārana sarta They also seem to dissolve into it, wherefore it 15 called the lasa-sılära 
It will be thus seen that it is the empirical self or the divi dual, who, with bis three bodies, becomes involved in the pheno medal world Various other details are mentioned to connection with the empirical self A frequent reference is, for instance, made to the three aspects of his psychical activity, namely, cogni tre, affective, and conatise We are further told that, in the three states of consciousness, namely, those of wakefulness, dream, and deep-sleep, the idividual ts respectively called Falfrānara, taijasa, and prājra. His actions are sad to be mainly of three kinds - bodils (tājika), vocal (Tacika). and mental (mõrasa ) - and, as indicated above, they are assumed to produce certain inevitable moral consequences Then there is also the doctrine of the gunas, accordiog to which the characters of the individuals are the outcome of the mixture, in varying propor uon, of the three principal constituest aspects (gunas ), camely, saltra (knowledge and luminosity), rajas (passion and mobi lity), and tamas (igaorance and passivity) It is needless to say that the essential self transcends these three gunas — IS trigunātita. An individual, 10 shom scifra predominates, is called såltrid and is characterised by knogledge (frana), passiopless detachment (rairāgsa), and glory (aisrarja) An individual, 10 #hom rajas predommates becomes rājasa He is always absorbed in actions being impelled to them by desires, passions, and impulses A támasa individual is one, in whom tamas predominates, and who is, therefore, characterised by ignorance, vice, infatuation, greed, etc,

INSIGHIS INTO HINDUISM 
With a view to clarifying our own ideas in the matter, we may speak of certain distinct stages in connection with the process of what we call the worldly life of an individual First of all there is the stage in which the essential self exists in all serenity and aloofness — mystically united with the Supreme Being As the result of the operation of the original ignorance, avıdyā, the essential self seems to enter into the second stage the stage of individuality It becomes conditioned by the body-mind-complex and is nyolved the phenomenal world, which is, in a sense, its own creation This stage is pregnant with two possibilities Either, on account of true knowledge, the individual shakes off the limitations of his individuality and thus forthwith attajas to the stage of moksa - a stage which, in its nature, 15 identical with the pre-audzā stage Or the individual cont, nues his pilgrimage through various rebirths - this is the stage of transmigration or samisára - until he reaches his destination in the form of moksa 
The idea of rebirth is common to several ancient religions of the world But the distinctive contribution of Hinduism is that it has attempted to present a metaphysical and ethical rationali sation of that idea four main principles may be said to be involved in the Hindu theory of rebirths or transmigration (samsára), namely, the permanence of the essential self, the operation of avidyā, the possibility of mioksa, and the doctrine of karma The most fundamental among these pripciples is, of course, the Hindu concept of the permanence (niljana) of the essential self It is quite obvious that, without the assumption of a permanent entity, any talk of rebirth or transmigration would become meaningless That is why the materialists who do not believe in a permanent entity. like the ātman, do not accept the possibility of rebirth The second principle, namely, the ope ration of avidjà, is also quite basic and essential for, avidyā, by causing the essential self to assume an individuality may be said to make the whole process of transmigration at all possible It is interesting to note in this connection, that, according to the Hindu view, the original cause of birth is not any moral error of 
SIAN IN HINDU THOUGHT

lapse For, ardā is essentially a metaphysical concept rather thad a moral or an epistemologcal one Moral or epistemological concepts have relevance only after the process of samsāra b once started Attention may non be drasz to another significant Hindo ven concerniog samsára, namely, that samsāra is neither an idle or unmotnated journey Dor a wild-goose-chase It has been invested with a definite meaning and purpose This is where the third principle, namely, the possibility of moksa, becomes operative For, rroksa represents the ansver to the cternal question whither mankicd 
Some general idea about the Hindu concept of molsa will have been already derived from the foregoing discussion about the essential self and the empirical self It would, however, be desirable to emphasise some of the distinctive fearures of that concept To begin with, it must be made clear that, though, in common parlacce se speak of 'attaining” moksa, the state of moksa is not something essentially different from the real nature of the self It is only for the convenience of speech that ne speak of "attaping' moksa The Hindu thinkers claim that mokse is not prāpja (to be reached) por uipadja (to be crea ted), por tilārsa (to be got as the result of some modification or change ), nor samkārja (to be got as the result of some operation for refinement or perfection) In other words, in the Hiodu yew, moksa is native and not densauve so far as the individual 15 concerned Voksa does not imply that the self acquires something which does not belong to it or, to be more precise, something which it is not As a matter of fact, moksa meaos realsing one 5 000 tre- self It is already there though one becomes temporani; bund to it order the influence of adj. Paraphrased in popular Loguage, man is really god Godhead is, jadeed, his real nature It is only through the accident of ignorance that he feels drested of that datu-e. Such a ven 15, indeed, morally very significant, for it elevates man by denying all creatureliness ” 10 respect of him. 
When it is claimed that mok so is aatuse to man, another claim made by the Hindus also follows it by way of a corollary, 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
namely, that mok sa is the birth-right of every individual This view, it will be seen, is the very antithesis of the doctrine of god's grace According to it, man himself, and not any extra neous power, is responsible for his emancipation It is, indeed, this assurance which gives a meaning and a purpose to one's life Man learns to look upon life not as a journey without an epd or purpose but as soul's pilgrimage to be terminated at moksa Even if moksd is not realised in one life, man is sustained through all the stages of transmigration by this message of faith and hope that nobody can depriye him of his bith night, namely, moksa 
About what may be called the content of moksa, the only thing that we can say is that, from the individual's point of view, moksa consists in throwing off the shackles of individuality and thereby passing into the mystic state of spiritual union with the Supreme Being There is, however, another view of moksa, according to which mok sa represents mainly a certain attitude of mind- an attitude whereby the individual develops a universality of outlook, so that, even after the discernment of the truth which comes to the liberated soul, he still retains his individuality as a basis for action in this world This is the condition of being jivanmuhta (emancipated while living) The Hindu thinkers, indeed, speak of three kinds of liberation - liberation attained forthwith at death (sadyomuhtı or videhamuki), whereby deatb really renders one deathless, liberation by stages (hramamuktı), and liberation while living inanmuktı) It is this last, which the Bhagavadgua glorifies as the highest deal of man, an ideal which that philosophical poem has emphasised in its descriptions of sthiraprajña, the yogin, and the bhakta 
To revert to the theory of transmigration it may be said that if the operation of avidyā is the cause of the birth' of an indie vidual, the operation of the law of karma, which is the fourth principle involved in this theory, is the cause of his rebirths' It may be further pointed out that, out of the four principles

61 
involved in the theory of transmigration, the first two are meta physical, the third is significant both from the metaphysical and ethical points of vert, and the Last, panek the doctrine of karird, is predominantly ethical. It would, however, be necessary and desirable to esamine the doctrine of loma a little more closely 
The doctrice of karma is one of the most distinctre features of Hipdann It will be seed to have cfluenced most of the important Hiodo teachings and practices It is, it should be Temembered, the essential element got onls of Hindu ethos but of the entire popolar bel ef of the Hiodes The faiths of India differ widely, at some points being the very poles 25beder But all of them, orthodox as rell es heterodor ( with the exception of materialists like Carvita), accept this doctice as oge of their andpal tenets. 
The doctrme of kerma represents the solution offered by Hinduism for the great niddle of the ongn of soffermag ard in equality of human conditions in this world According to the Hodus, the law of cacsation operates not only in respect of the phys cal world, but it operates in an equally invariable and inyolable manner, also in respect of the moral rorld All acts that ap adındaal does tpevitably led to some results, good or bzd, and the life of the indivdual, who dox those acts, becoces conditioned by the consequences of those acts We cannot think of any acts which fizzle out vihout prodccing resolts (intopra nāša) por of any results which have to antecedents in the form of come acts (chrtābhyuragarra) This is the icexorable law of karma, the lau of actions and their inevitable results It most, bow ever, be added that the doctrme of Larra does cot denote merely this more or less mechanical theory of retribution. It also imples some definite moral principles Morally good acts recessarily froduce good results and morally bad acts bad results It can be empirically proved that there is perfect justice the fuactioning of this law But we often see that all acts of 20 individual do pot fructify within the bref span of a single Lfe What, it may be asked, becomes of those acts According to the Law of karma,INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
no actions are barren It, therefore, becomes necessary to postu late another life for that individual, during which he may reap what he has son in the preceding life As a matter of fact, we have to assume by a logical extension of this postulation, the existence of a series of lives in the case of an individual This is the theory of somsira, which thus becomes a necessary corollary to the law of harma 
The present life of an individual is conditioned by such of the acts done by him in the preceding life as had not attained their fructification during the course of that life The moral conse quences of his past conduct and behaviour are, so to say, conser ved and have their effect in the present life His past acts, for sostance, determine the kind of body which he may assume, the family, society, and position in which he may be born, and the acts which he may do in the present life To put it briefly, every creature is the creation of its own past deeds The otherwise inerplicable vicissitudes of life and incquality among human beings are thus rationalized by the doctrine of karma Nothing 10 this world, physical as well as moral, happens as the result of mere caprice or blind chance In every happening we have to see the operation of an immutable law. As a matter of fact, such a law has been postulated at a very early stage in the evolution of Indian thought in the Rgieda, for instance, we come across frequent references to rta, the cosmic magic law which governs every happening in this world - from the mightiest workings of the powers of nature to the tinast activity like the winking of the eye The Vedic rta may, therefore, be said, in a sense to be the Vedic version of the Hindu doctrine of harma 
If, then according to the doctrine of karma, whatever we are and do is prcordained, is harma not just another name for fata lism? Is man hereby not denied his initiative as a free agent? Is he not reduced to thic unenviable position of a helpless victim of & mechanical law? What interest can he have in a life which it is not in his power to invest with a purpose and a meaning? Let it be said at the outset that these and similar other questions, though natural on the face of them, betray an inadequate under

standing of some of the essential features of the doctrine of karma This doctripe, it should te clearly understood, does not imply the operation of any extraneons factors in man's life and doings No erternal power such as fate or destiny, is assumed to be shaping the life of man Considered critically, the doctrine of karta #ill be found to be teaching that man himself is, in a seose, the architect of his life What he did in the past life 18 entirely responsible for what he is in the present life So viewed this doctrine becomes the very opposite of fatalism It deletes caprice or chapce and discountenances the working of an over nding providence The causes of an individual s life and actions are to be ultimately traced back to the çndividual himself And, as indicated above, the life of ad individual may not be limited to one life only 
Two objections are likely to be raised against this position Even assuming that, in this sumsåra the actions of an iodividual in the preceding life condition his next life, it may be asked what about his first birth in the series of rebirths? There is no possibility of any anterior actions and their retribution in respect of that birth Therefore, so far as that birth is concerned, the law of karma would pot operate that is it that would condition ap adividual's life and action at that juncture? Such a question is pbilosophically inadmissible According to the Huadu thought, the samsāra is begingjagless (anadi). It is impossible to visualise an individual without antecedents For, strictly speaking, individuality itself is the product of antece denis If the essential self is unaffected by any antecedents, it does not become 11able to be born at all and so to assume any lodividuality 
The other object107 1$ perhaps more pertinent We may accept that, in the beginningless series of rebirths, an individual's px USA zatra. hios pirra. Va W7uy via wept that the individual himself, and not aby ertraneous factors is accouota ble for what he is in the present life but do the individual's *past deeds not become, in a sense, extraneous forces so far as his present life is concerned? What control does he ron have 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
over his past actions which govern his present life? He cannot alter their course the past, although it is his past, is already a fait accomph, and it is this that determines his present, thereby leaving him do freedom to shape it as he would like He cannot, for instance, say In my present Iife, my action shall be only such as will inevitably lead to a better life next time He cannot say this for the simple reason that his actions in this life are not really his They are predetermined Such an objection is met by the Hindu thinkers by postulating a twofold fructification of all actions Firstly, every action produces its direct result (phala) The phala of our past deeds is that they determine the nature of our present body and the conditions directly relating to and consequent upon our birth In respect of these we have no choice We have to accept them as they are ordained But our past deeds also produce what may be called their indirect result in the form of our innale tendencies ( sanıskāras) It is these samshāras, produced in us by our past deeds, which prompt us to act one way or another it is, however, necessary to emphasise that the samskäras only prompt but do not compel us to act in a particular manner This fact affords ample scope for initiative and self-determination on the part of an ipdividual He can, if he will, control and direct his samskäras Though, therefore an individual's birth and initial environments are predetermined, he has before him the gratifying prospect of being able to master his sanskaras, which are, indeed, the main sprogs of all his actions The doctrine of karma thus includes within itself also the possibility of moral progress in spite of the initial conditioning of our present life we can employ every moment of it to make ourselves as we will And when it is realised that the present life represents not the whole term allotted to an individual but only a stage in the soul's progress towards its goal, even that partial predetermination should not matter much 
It will be thus seen that the doctrine of karma does not imply fatalism nor does it preclude the operation of free will, which is the very basis of ethical conduct Teaching as it does that, in the ultimate analysis, an individual is himself the architect of his

own life, this doctrine countenances no such thing as cruel fate or unjust god It produces in man the faith that it is never too late to mend Though apparently a blind mechanical force, karma, it must be remembered essentially represents the cosmic power of righteousness which forever encourages man on his odward march towards a higher spirtual goal 
Though, in the Vedic literature, there are but few indications of the doctrine of karma,lo in the later Hindu thought, it held a very commanding position Indeed, 10 some schools of thought like the Sāmhhia and the Vimámsā, karma came to be regarded as such an all pervading power as to render god almost super fluous In other schools, god was conceded the position of an impartial administrator of the law of karma But, in any case, the idea of god's grace was considered to be entirely incompati ble with this doctripe The significance of this doctrine from the point of view of the social organisation of the Hindus would be. come clear from the important part played by it in connection with the consolidation of the caste system 
With all that has been said so far, there would still remain one final difficulty about the doctrine of karma How can karma be reconciled with mohsa which is universally recognised by the Hindus as their spiritual goal? Is the law of karma, in a sense, not the very antithesis of moksa? Do even morally good actions Dot continue to keep an individual lavolved in life howsoever ethically high it might be? The Bhagavadgită has shown a satisfactory way out of this difficulty 11 It teaches that man's actions attain their fructification in the form of phala or sams käras affecting that man only if he performs those actions with a feeling of attachment for their results If, however, he acts — AS required by the law of karma, bus, at the same time, properly controlling and directing the samsläras --- in a spirit of passionless detachment 10 respect of the fruits of his actions, he would, while doing his svadharma, be still leaving the road open for the soul's

progress towards moksa In other words, the anāsakirjoga of the Bhagavadgitā, as it were, bridges over the gap between the doctrine of karma and the ideal of mok sa 
If the philosophical approach to the problem of the role of man gises rise to the dualism between the essential self and the empirical self, the religious or theistic approach presupposes the dualism between man and god Let it be sard, at the very outset, that the dualism between man and god is philosophically inadmis sible For, as shown above essentially man is god As a matter of fact, from the ultimate philosophical point of view, the very concepts of man and god cannot be said to possess absolute rea Inty They belong to the realm of the phenomenal world This will account for the fact that many philosophical systems in India are essentially atheistic They are not required to posit the exis tence of a personal god in order to answer the various cosmolo gical, psychological metaphysical, and even ethical questions which they have mooted in the course of their spiritual quest This does not, however, mean that Hinduism has nothing to do with god On the contrary, Hinduism — particularly popular Hinduism — is crowded with gods Hinduism is certainly god conscious — perhaps very much so! This need not surprise us It really redounds to the glory of Hinduism that, in it, absolute monistic idealism and passionate devotionalism should abide side by side and without any conflict What is still more creditable is that Hinduism has achieved this marvellous feat in 1 more or less rational manner, namely, through the assumption of the pos sibility of two points of view in philosophical matters -- the abso lute (pāramārthika) point of view and the relative (vārahi rika) point of view, the one not spurning the other, each posses sing reality in its own way and each independently leading to the final goal The proverbial catholicity of the Hindu mind is also, in no small measure, responsible for what would appear to a casual observer as the paradoxes of Hinduism Indeed, one of the most striking of such paradores is to be seen in the fict that a staunchi monistic idealist like Samkarācārya has composed some of the swcetest and most stirring hymns in praise of personal disinities. 
MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT 
The consideration of the role of man in relation to god is, therefore, not altogether without relevance To put it in broad but philosopnicallv qot quite precise - terms, god stands in the same relation to the ultimate realitv or the Supreme Being as ao individual does to the essential self So the relation betweco god 
od man is in many ways iniuerced by the relation between the Supreme Being and the essential self Therstically the goal sought after bv man is either to live in the same world as god (salokatā) or to be nearest to god ( samipatā), or to assume the same form as god ( suructu), or figally to achieve intimate UDIOD with god ( sa ulata) It will be easily seen that, while the first three goals rore or less represent the stages leading to the last goal, the last goal is but thertic reflection of the philosophi cal goal of the mystic Lnion of th essential self with the Supreme Being The philosophically accepted identity between the Supreme Being 30d the essential selt is sometimes qualified in theism by suggesting that god and en are idectical in essence but diffe rent in form What sparks are in relation to fire, man 15 10 relation to god A further development of this partial separate ness of man from god is that god is described as being not really extercal to mao but as being the antur;ūmin (100er controller) of man God is really the efficient directive cause (prajojaka karta) 10 man s life 
The philosophical doctrine of the perfect identity between the Supreme Being ard the essential selt is thus first modified into a doctrine of qualıted identity or partial separateness between god and map This latter is then carried still further in the direction of complete djalism between god and mag God is then conceived of as the creator and the moral governor of man and the universe Particularly in respect of man he plays the role of the dispenser of the lay of karma It is however, irteresting to note, in this connection, that, even accepting the complete separateness and the ale inspiring distance between man and god, 1 Hindu seeks to achieve a direct personal communion with ged through a complete surrender of his whole being to god This is the ideal of a Hindu devotee (bhakta) 
68 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
Devotion (bhaktı), according to the Hindu view, implics, firstly, dedicating all one's actions to god, rerdering service to him, and meditating on him in single pointed concentration, 12 it further implies ridding oneself of all consciousness of 'I' ness and 'my' ness18 and developing in oneself an attitude of being the same to all gods beings whether friend or foe," and, paradoxical as it may seem, it finally implies creating in oneself a peculiar mystic power through surrender, humility, and faith 16 Prayer, worship, ritual iratas (religious observances), etc, do have a place in the Hindu religious practice But the doctrine of true bhaktı, which involves such items as consciousness of sinfulness on the part of the devotee, his complete self-surrender before God, his earnest longing for a close personal communion with Him, and the mystic experiences that he has in His companionship,18 must, indeed, be regarded as the most potent facior, which, in Hinduism, governs the role of man in relation to god 
Let us now try to understand the role of man vis a vis this world in general and his fellow beings in particular In this con nection it may be recalled that, according to the higher philoso phical thought of the Hindus, the essential self of man is never in volved in the happenings in this phenomenal world From the ulti mate point of view, therefore, the question about the role of man, the 'real' man, in this world would have no relevance whatsoever Even with reference to the empirical self the consideration of such a question would have but little intrinsic value For, the highest spiritual goal of a Hindu is to transcend the limitation of his indi viduality, which binds him to this phenomenal world, and so to realise his identity with the Supreme Being, which is, indeed, his native character Life in this world is accordingly to be looked upon as a bridge, over which one has, of necessity, to pass in

order to reach one s destination, but on which it is unwise to build one's house Van's role to this world thus pertains to an essentially lower stage of expenence, and is generally treated 25 such by the Hindu thinkers. The usual charge that, in India, ethics is regarded just as an 'asıde' from the serious business of philosophy -- a concession, as it were, to the necessity of man's contact with the phenomenal world cannot, therefore, be said to be quite unjustified It must be admitted that Indian philo sophy transcends the merely ethical level as much as it does the merely rotellectual level. 
This must cot, however, te Misunderstood to mean that the Hiodus have altogether neglected this aspect of the role of man Hinduism does offer man an expert guidance for a safe and speedy passage over the bridge of life Its most significant contribution in this respect is the concept of dharma Dharma is, indeed, a very elusne term and has denoted different things in different contexts It may mean Vedic ritual, or religion and ethics in general, or aste rules, or coul and criminal law But the vader lying basic idea is everywhere the same Dharma seeks to resolve the inevitable conflict between the real and the phenome nal, the spiritual and the material, the eternal and the temporal. It recognises that, while string after the ideal, man cappot afford to overlook the actual Drarra thersfore lays down a way of life which aims at securing the material and the spiritual sustenance and growth of the individual and the society It is a unique joint product of the speculaute and the practical wisdom of the Hindus It would now become clear hon it is possible to speak of different kinds of dharma, such as rarnadharma and asramadharma, corresponding to the different relations subsisting between man and the world or society 
It may be asked how is it at all possible to get oser the obvi ous opposition between the individual good and the individual ends on the one baad ard the social good and the social ends on the other? The ultimate goal of the individual, namely, mok sa, presup poses that bus constant endeavour should be, as far as possible, to isolate kimself from this world In other words, the individual is 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
expected to follow the path of resignation and actionlessness (nartimürga) The goal of social stability and progress, on the other hand, requires for its realisation positive efforts on the part of every member of the society Unless, therefore, every individual were 10 play his part in this world with active interest and a sense of responsibility - unless, in other words, he were to follow the path of action (prarumärga)- the sociaty would disinte grate There is often observable a tendency to regard these two ways of life — the way of action (karma) and the way of renuncia tion (samınjāsa) -as mutually exclusive and to extol one at the expense of the other The Hindu view of life, however, is gover ned by an implicit faith in the efficacy and validity of both these ways and in the possibility of reconciling the claims of action and renunciation In a sense, this faith is the very motive force of Hindu dharma It is fully realised that the life of actionless contemplation is as much fraught with evil as the life of attach ment and bare activity The sage of the Isaiasja Upanısad (9) tells us “To pitchy dart ness do they go who pursue the path of audja, that is, of bare action To greater durkness still, as it were, do they go who are absorbed in the life of bare krowledge and meditation (idyā)" The ideal set forth in this connec tion, therefore, is to synthesise these two ways of life is such a manner that one does not prove an impediment to the other, and both together facilitate the realisation of mok sa for the individual and solidarity and progress of the society It is not action per se which entangles man into the turmoil of this world thereby ren dering his chances of liberation remote The root cause of this evil is not action but the passion and attachment which accom pany that action Fruitsul actionlessness, therefore, consists in the annihilation of such passion and attachment and not in the abandonment of action itself This is the anāsak 11 Joga of the Bhagavad. Itā, which implies Itnunciation in action and not of action 
One of the most typical results of this ideal of life is the Hindu doctrine of the four ends of man (purusārtlas) The Hindu thinkers have recognised that man possesses a complex

explain the why' of it This problem of the inequality of human conditions has, indeed agitated the minds of great thinkers of all times and of all climes As we have seen, through their doctrine of karma, the Hindu thinkers have made an out standing contribution in this regard It is, therefore, necessary that that doctrine 15 always present in our mind while we exaraine the aśramadharma and the rarnadharma 
The āśramadharma, or the Hindu scheme which aims at an ethical organization of an individual's personal life with a view to a fruitful synthesis of the way of action (pravrttı) and the way of renunciation (marttı) as also to the realisation of the four ends of man (purusārthas ), is undoubtedly a unique contri bution to the ethical thought of the world From the historical point of view, the ongin of this scheme is to be presumably sought in the impact between the Aryans and the indigenous communities of India The outlook on life of the Aryans, as re presented in the Rgveda, is essentially characterised by an exube rance of attachment for and interest in living That Veda does not generally show any traces of renunciation or attitude of resig. nation on the part of the Aryans On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there existed, among the 10 digenous people of India, several religious sects, like those of the Vrātyas, the Brahmacārıns, the Munis, and the Yogiasl? who seem to have lived a life of detachment from the affairs of the world a life which was, besides, characterised by great austerity and rigorous physical and spiritual discipline 18 It can be assumed that, perhaps on account of the miraculous powers which the members of these sects were believed to possess, they wielded a peculiar influence on the commonalty of the people Their way of life must have also had an irresistible attraction for maoy of

them This was a phenomenon about which the Brahmapic thin kers could not have remamed altogether indifferent. An organic scheme must have therefore, been gradually evolved in the form of the asarradharma, which afforded foll scope for the operation of the protetti-tendencies of the Aryan colonisers and the nitrtti tendencies of the pre-Arya anchonites In this connection, it may be icadeptally added that the origin of the ladian caste system also has to be discovered in tbe impact between the Aryan immigrants and the indigenous Indian communities 
There was another factor o hich must have helped the formu lation and the consolidation of the asramadharma It was the great ethical concept of the three deb's ( rratraj a ) 1: Every indi vidual, we are told, is born with a bability of three debts, which he is expected to requite dunog his life There is, first of all, the debt which he ones to god ( dera-ra) of this he can redeem himself by dedicatiog his life to the service of God and to the proper promotion of the scheme of things as laid done by Him There is then the debt to the seers (rsi-rra) shich he an repay by presening ard eonching the cultural hentage handed down to him from age to age Lastly there is the debt which he ones to his ancestors (pur-ma) This te aan discharge by procrea ting good progeny and thereby ensuring the contjquity of the human race The avemadnorma organizes the life of an indryl dual in such a mapper that he remains ever picdful of his sacred obligations and is also given adequate opportonities for their redemption 
The word ašrania literally means erertion or the place where such exertions are performed By an extension of this meaning, the asramas came to denote the main stages in an iodividual's life, which, if properly organized, itself becotees a planned exertion. According to the Hindu vex, there are four such stages, which follow one another jo succession - brahmacarja (life of a student),

After the rite of initiation (upang, ana ), which was very significantly regarded as his secord birth, a child commenced his life of a student He approached his teacher with fuel in hand - a gesture which was symbolic of his willingness to obey and to serve For the next few years - the normal period of brahma carja extended over twelve years, though it varied in some cases - he had to hive at the house of the teacher devoting himself fully to the achievement of the three main goals of studentship, namely, the acquisition of knowledge, the building up of character, and the preparation for the shouldering of the responsibilities which would devolve on him in future life. This compulsory stay of the student in the teacher's house had its own advantages For one thing it excluded the possibility of any conBict arising between the teacher and the parents in the matter of the method and the contents of the education of the child For, during the period of studentship, the role of teacher and father were combined in one person 20 Moreover the constant personal contact between the teacher and the student was bound to have a sterling influence on the moulding of the latter's mind and character There is, indeed, mentioned in the Veda a symbolic rite whereby the teacher magically transferred his splendour to the pupil -1 
Normally, student was expected to live by begging (bhiksă carana) and was not required to pay any fixed fees to the teacher Soare very important principles of education were involved in this practice Begging implied that it was mainly the responsibility of the community to maintain the student It also engendered the habit of a simple and selt reliant life and fostered the necessary sense of equality among students Besides, since no fixed fees were laid down, the education of an individual was not made dupendent on his economic condition The Hindu

and not a contract The real significance of the Hindu marriage is not that it represents the fulfilment of any important purposes of life, but that it marks the begioning of a more responsible and purposeful life to come The sacrament of marriage and the various restrictions relating to endogamy and exogamy which normally govern every Hindu marriage imply a perfect biological, psychological, moral, and spiritual union of husband and wife The relationship between the two is governed by the sentiment of loyalty and devotion to each other until death 27 
Hindu thunkers have often emphasised the social purpose of marriage, namely, procreation of progcny (prajanana) and conti puation of the line (santāna) It must, however, be pointed out that marriage does not by itself constitute a full social institu tion But it certainly lays the foundation of the most funda mental of all the social institutions of the Hindus namely, family Normally a Hindu family is a closely-knit group of persons related to one another by blood But consanguinity, it must be remembered, is not the only force which keeps a family together Far more effectively operative in this respect are the remarkable affections which develop among the various members of a family 
They are really bound together by the bonds of mutual respect, devotion and love this characteristic of the Hindu family is rightly regarded as one of the most attractive features of the social life of the Hindu A Hindu family implies common residence, common kitchen, common property, common worship, and consequently, common experience of the joys and sorrows of life for all its members Such an arrangement has many advantages For instance, it necessarily encourages a feeling of identity of interests and promotes the consciousness of all for each and each for all' For the sake of solidarity, an individual learns to subordinate his own interests to the interest of the family Sacrifice is, indeed, the keynote of the harmony of the family It will be seen that, in actual practice, family offers adequate protection and support to its weaker members, such

as widows, the aged ard the firm, and the unemployed In many ways, therefore, family serves as a rursery where the first lessons 10 social behaviour are learnt It is a school which prepares a person for the larger communal life Therefore, in spite of some of its disadi antages, such as that it encourages idleress and does not promote bitiative and epterprise, the Institution of family has proved a very polent force to the social history of the Hindus

made a return to gods, he is a downsight thief” The ethical significance of the sacrifice to creatures (bhuta-jajña), which consists of offering food to them, is indeed very great It emphatically deprecates the selfish tendencies in man and requires him to share his possessions with his needy follow beings A seer of the Rgveda"8 says “He becomes an absolute sinner who eats by himself" The same sentiment is expressed in the Bhagavadgitā ? which says "Those who cook (exclusively) for themselves eat of so, and are sinful” The last sacrifice, namely, the sacrifice to men (Mr-Jaña), is only another name for the proverbial hospitality of the Hindus These five great sacrifices together represent the ideal of a householder's life The spirit of service and sacrifice, which thus underlies all actions performed during the grhasthasrama, is indeed most elevating

After having lived a full and fruitful life as householder, a man naturally begins to think of freeing himself from the ties of family and society This is the stage of withdrawal from active life and taking over the life of a forest-hermit (vānaprastha) In this aśrama, a man may be accompanied by his wise, who too is expected to dissociate herself from all family and social bonds The main role of a vānaprastha consists not in service or leader ship but in disinterested counsel Without, in any way, imposing himself upon the community, he places at its disposal the rich experience which he bas gathered during a long and busy life

But even this partial and passive contact with the affairs of the world a man is not inclined to continue for long. He, therefore, soon enters into the last stage of life - the stage of complete renun. ciation and solitude ( sam jasa Hus one and only aim must now be the realisation of spiritual freedom of mystic union with the diszne It is here necessary to emphasise the distinction between asceticism (samnjāsa) and austenty (tapas) While, by means of tapas, one seeks to achieve more or less superhuman poners to be used mostly for materialistic and secular purposes, samnjāsa aims at purely moral and spiritual ends A samnijāsın must drown his consciousness of 'I ness ( ahamkāra) and 'my-' ness (manahära)- he must cut himself loose from the limita tions of individuality and so prepare himself to realise the goal for which he has served, during the first three asramas, a sell-planned apprenticeship 
It will be seen from the foregoug statement that the asrama dharma provides a Hindu wub an outline of a well-defined plan of life, complete with its four fixed stages, each stage having its OND compler of duties All that an indivdual is expected to do 15 to fill in the details in accordance with his propensities and capacities Indeed, this pattern of life, though a unique feature of Hinduism, is so universal a character that it can well become acceptable to all people and at all times The m3in strength of the asramadharma perhaps lies in the fact that it lays down a graded discipline which is eminently suitable to the physical and mental development of man at different ages Another significant point to be noted in connection with the astarradharma is that, according to it, mans whole life constitutes a great and noble sacrifice (Jajra) It evinces an indomitable faith in the possibility of progress only through service and sacnfice It should be further noted that, though the asramadharma pertains mainly to the personal life of an individual, it incidentally seeks to deter mine the responsibilities of the individual and the society in respect of each other in the first asrama, it is the responsibility of the community to look after the individual while, in the life of a householder, the individual is enojned to promote communa)

life through service and sacrifice The third stage (vanaprastha) represents a somewhat neutral phase, and, in the last stage, after having lived a useful social life, the individual 1s pormally inclined to concentrate on his own spiritual emancipation Finally it should be noted that, true to the main trend of their thought, the Hindu thinkers have taken care to emphasise that the aśramadharma must not be regarded as an end in itself To use a classical metaphor, the aśramas merely constitute a four runged ladder which an individual has to climb in order to reach his ultimate goal 
As if to make the broad scheme of the asramas more tangible and definite, the Hindu thinkers have correlated it with their more minute scheme of sacraments (samskäras ) A sacrament is generally defined as a religious rite which is intended to mark the creation in an individual of some inward spiritual grace Promi nent among the various elements which constitute Hindu samska ras are sacred fire, prayers ( mantras ), sacrifice, lustration," ori entation, symbolism," taboos," and magic 46 Each important

43 Certain details of the artaments are fixed in accordance with the popu lar beliefs relating to the different quarters In all auspicious sacraments, for instance, the individual is required to face towards the east, which is believed to be the quarter of light, life, and energy South is the quarter ol the god of drath, the dead body is thereforc, placed on the funeral pytc with the head towards the outh CE also circumambulation pradaksin), that is going round the object of worship in such a way that it will always be on the right hand side 
44 Material objects are used as tymbols (pralika ) of spiritual qualities for instance, stone is the symbol of fixity and steadfastness. In marriage cerc mony therefore the bride 13 asked to step on a stone ( amarahang), to fuggest stcadastness in her devotion to the husband

juncture in the journey of life 15 sanctified by means of a sacrament As a matter of fact, sacraments touch the life of an individual from before his birth antil after his death For the first sacrament ja the series refers to the conception ( garbhadhana) and the last to the funeral (crhjesh), while some of the impor. tact in'en ening sacramects relate to the name-gung (rama karara) the tocsure ( cudakarra) tbe laitiation (uparia Fana), the end of studentsbup (som rorlara) and the marriage (traka) Apart from the popular and more or less superstitious parpose, which the sanskaras are supposed to serve, such as, for instance, the removal of es influences and attraction of favour able ones, they sene a very signifcant cultural purpose They represent, in a sense, the principal landmarks in the process of an individual developing icto a full-fledged social beio Atten tion may also be drawn to the fact that by prescribing th sarskāras for all classes of people - the only difference being that, among the lower classes, the surslaras are not accomp2pied by tte recitation of sected mantras-the Hinda thinlers have achieved a kind of unity and uniformity of their religious culture 
If the scheme of the asraras represented a Lud of ethical Organization of an individual's personal life, the caste system could be regarded from a certain point of view, as the ethical organization of the social life of the Hindu Though caste is universally looked upon as one of the most distinctive features of Hinduism, it is, indeed, very difficolt precisely to define ciste All that we can do is to pdicate certam essential features of the caste system as it operates in India. To begin with, the member ship of a caste is determoed by birth Forther the caste normally regulates the marriage, diet, and occupation of the persons belonging to it. For instance, a caste is an endogamous group so that its members are forb dden to marry outside that caste in most cases a caste is further subdivided into smaller exogamous groups, the members of bich most pecessarily marry outside those groups It seems that the nigd restrictions on marriage, which of course, van according to different castes and localities, are due to the taboo on taking food cooked by or in 
84 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
the company of certain persons As a matter of fact, according to some scholars, this taboo is the keystone of the whole caste system in this connection it must be pointed out that restric tions are placed by different castes also on the kind of food which may be taken by their members For most castes, again, there are fixed occupations Since heredity is the basic factor which invests an individual with a particular caste for life - unless, of course, he be later expelled from the caste for the violation of its rules - the transition from one caste to another becomes impossi ble Another important feature of the caste system is that there is some gradation of castes, whereby the Brāhmanas are generally assigned a position at the top Indeed, a casual observer might feel inclined to wonder whether the whole system did not revolve round the central theme of the prestige of the Brāhmanas Even the normal social intercourse among the various castes is governed by certain set regulations, many of which are based on ideas regarding pollution through direct contact or otherwise As a matter of fact the relative position of different castes in the hierarchy of the caste system has to be ultimately traced back to the conceptions of purity and magic potence in a ritual ceremonial Caste in India also implies the denial of certain civil and religious rights to a large number of people 
A mention may be made of some other minor and less rigid restrictions Certain castes have special rights to wear certain ornaments or garments The kind of language to be used by one caste with reference to another is also sometimes determined by the status of those castes in the hierarchy Then there is the general ban placed on journeys overseas, presumably with a view to preserving the purity of caste which would otherwise be affected through contact with non caste people Provision is, however, made for expiatory rites in cases of violation of this ban It has been rightly observed that caste interferes with all the relations and events of the life of a Hindu, and with what precedes and follows it It has influenced the social process of India to such an extent that the caste of 1 Hindu persists even after he changes his religion The caste system is, accordingly, seen to

have infected the lower classes of the Muslim and the Indian Christian communities 
Hon did such a sistem come into baing? Several theories have been put forth as regards tbe origin and the growth of castes, Disision of society into classes or groups 15 perhaps a common feature all over the world But the caste system in India 1», as indicated above, peculiar in miny respects and so essentially incomparable suth the soc al segmentation seen elsewhere Some of the features of the Irdian caste sistem are indeed, so peculiar ibat, on account of them, it has to be distinguished from institu tions erting elsewhere, which are more or less analogous to it The usual ven about caste is that it is the result of the attempts of the culturally superior Aryan invaders to protect themselves from absorption by the barbarous aborigio-> There 1further a tendency among many scholars to regard caste as an artificial creation of the priesthood - as an outcome of the minipulations of the Brahmanas to wanted to maintain the purity of the race of the Aryan invaders Those who adopt such a viet seem to forget that caste is essentially an organic growth rather than an externally imposed defensne measure Storeover, if re accept the exclasively racial origin of castes, we shall have satisfactonly to account for the circumstance that though colour prejudice and racial exclusiveness have been very common in history, they have not elses here given rise to an institution like caste Aod, further, will it be possible to claim that racial punity has beco actually preserved ampoog even de priestly casits of today? 
To point to occupation as the exclusive basis of caste is equally uncooming Why should there hale been a taboo on commensality among different professions and hou could there hase arisen other strong prejudices among functional groups? A 119, which is non more commonly advanced, 13 that caste must be traced back to both racial and occupational origios It 15 suggested that colour or racial difference, real or fancied, together with hereditary occupations gave birth to the caste system, According to another sien, caste is the result of the impact of the patriarchal immigrants on the jodigenous matriarchal popu.

INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
lation Some others define caste as a society of classes with a cross section of guilds There is indication in the Rgveda, which is the earliest literary document of the Indians, that the society in those days was organized into four distinct orders - Brāhmana (the poet-priest). Rājanva (the warrior ruler). Vaisya (the trader-agriculturist), and Sūdra (the labourer) In later litera tute these social orders are frequently referred to as Tarnas Tbe traditional theory is that castes owe their origin to these four varnas - being the result of mixed upions between the different varnas or between one varna and the offspring of such mixed unions 47 But to assume that the 3,000 castes, which are today 10 existence in India, are the outcome of such mixed unions is perhaps to put too great a strain on one's imagination This traditional attempt to explain caste is quite formalist and only shows that the origins of caste had then already become obscurc As a matter of fact such simple or set theories can hardly be expected to explain so bighiy complex a social phenomenon as the caste system 
A proper appraisal of the ancient organization of the varnas would, however, lead to a better understanding of the later caste system It is sometimes suggested that the varna of ancient times is itself equivalent to caste On a closer examination, however, it will be found that the nature of Tarna was essentially different from that of caste as understood today Strictly speaking, caste Is pot varna, it is an In later times, yarna came to be loosely interpreted as caste presumably because the traditional theorists wanted to find, in the sacred Veda, authority for the caste system 
A kind of religious sanction for caste was sought to be derived from the Purusa sakta" wherein the four orders, namely, Bră hmana, Rājanya," Varya and Śūdra, are first mentioned It may be noted that the Purusa-Sülta does not use the word varna

There these orders are described as beiog respectuely, the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the legs of the Cosmic Being The word sarna literally means colour, and there can be little doubt that in such passages in the Rgreda, bere this word 13 used in connection with the antagonism between the Aryan invaders (arja Farna) and the indigenous Indian tribes conquered by them (dāsa Tarna ), it denotes the colour of the skin It thus seems to emphasise the racial distinction between the early An 20 mm grants on the one hand, and all other tribes - collectively - whom they en ountered and wanquished, on the oth, When, however, the word Tarra is used to depote the four social orders, mentioned in the Purusa-sühia, it does not seem to possess any racial connotation whatsoever As a matter of fact these social orders are not even called tarnas in the Rgreda It is only in later Vedic Literatureal that the word rarna came to be first employed with reference to them in post-Vedic literature, particularly in the literature dealing with Hindu dharmasastra, the connotation of the word varna was further extended, and besides the four orders, it generally devoted also the castes, which had by that time, become consolidated :

It 15, indeed, suggested that all human communities were originally bodies of persons organized for ritual purposes, the chief of which was to secure a full life with sufficiency of whatever is necessary or desirable It thus seems that the division of the Vedic society into four orders was intended for properly distribut ing throughout the community the various duties connected with the communal ritual and thereby ensuring that those duties were performed only by persons who were duly qualified on account of the heredity, the purity preserved by means of taboos etc, and the knowledge of the special functions connected with the ritual The beginnings of the rigid regulations about taboo etc, which characterise the castes of the later times may be discovered in the magic-ritual origin of the Vedic iarnas One point, however, needs to be emphasised in this connection, namely, that, in the Vedic times, taboo and other restrictions possessed a definite reality, while, 10 later times, they were more or less conventionalized and thus became only the fossils of ancient ritual actualities It further appears that, with a view to distinguishing the ritual character and functions of the four orders, four distinct colours had been assigned to them - white to the Brāhmana, red to the Rūjanya or Ksatriya, yellow to the Vaisya, and black to the Śūdra 63 This fact would explain the significance of the name varna by which these orders came to be eventually known Traditionally these four colours were further associated with the points of the compass, which fact seems to radicate that, in order to avoid pollution through free contact, the four orders were allotted dwelling places in the four quarters within the communal settle ment The magic ritual character of the varnas is further con firmed by the concept of the ceremonial tubirth of the first three among them They were accordingly called dhijas or twice born It was only after the sacrament of initiation that they became qualified for their respective rilual functions She sarnas of the ancient times seem to have been, to some extent, fluid in character, and instances of transference of persons belonging to one iarna to another varna, though rare, are not altogether wanting This is

perhaps in keeping with the magic-ntcal ideology, which made it possible for a person, under special circumstances, to increase his magic-ritual potence and thus qualify bimself for functions diffe rent from those of his own order, 
Thus, even in the Vedic times, there eusted a kind of delibe rate brerarchical organization among the Anan immigrants This organization included within itself certain factors, bich, on account of the interaction of certain other factors, so developed as to transform that organization into the caste system Indeed, one of the most significant features of the early Aryan conquest and colonisation, from the point of view of the social history of apcent India, may be said to have been the evolution of the foor ancient sarnas into the sanious later jares It is not sellaigh 
possible to mark out the various stages in this process It may, however, be added that the drift of the evolution had been in the direction of hardening and secularization Presupably, among the indigenous communities of India also, there existed certain distinctive concepts of taboo, pollutiod, purification, etc Morcover there is sufficient ground to assume that their socia life was organized on the basis of graded fuoctional guilds The impact of the social orders of the Aryacs and the in digenous Indian communities on each other must bave helped the growth of castes Aad, besides the factors implied by these tuo social organizations, such as the ideas relating to mana or soul-stuff, taboo, pollution, ceremonial purity, and magic-ritual potence, tbe belief in magic associated with crafts and functions, the anxiety for guarding the secrets of trade, etc, several other factors, such as the geographical isolation of the Indian sub-con Linent, the enforcement of deliberate economic and administrative policies, the clash of cultures the fusion of races, the shrewd appli cation of the doctrine of harma, aed the tendency towards religi ous and social exploitation, must have further led to the consoli dation of these castes into a full fledged system. Such then was presumably the manner of the origia and the growth of castes As a matter of fact, except on the assumption of such a multiple origin, it is almost impossible to account for the extreme comple: 
12

INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
xity of the caste system The caste system in India, must, there fore, be regarded as a unique social institution in the world, for, #1 15, indecd, very rarely that the various factors, which have collectively contributed towards its building up, could be all found to subsist together in another region 
Attention may be drawn at this stage to certain theoretical principles involved in the functioning of the caste system TO begin with it will be seen that, as a matter of fact, cach caste represents an independent social unit The different and exclu sive customs of a particular caste, in a sense, isolate it from other castes Therefore, though caste is a strong uniting force so far as its own members are concerned, it also serves as a potent dividing force vis-a-vis other castes Indeed, each caste seeks to guard its own special customs so jealously that one sometimes feels inclined to subscribe to the dictum that caste 15 custom But the peculiarity of the Hindu society is that it bas integrated several such independent units into an organic whole "This social organism called the castc system, is so built up that it can accommodate within itself, without difficulty, any new unit that may come into existence Similarly, if one unit breaks up ioto smaller units, each one of the latter, instead of falling out, becomes naturally integrated into the bigger organism as an independently functioning cell 
The exclusiveness and independence of a caste as a social unit Are further confirmed by its essentially autonomous character Each caste makes its ona rules and establishes its own customs It also possesses the power to enforce, through its council or panchayal, those rules and customs on its members The constr tution of these councils or panchayats varies in the case of different castes They are either permanent bodies or are impro vised for special occasions, and consist cither of hereditary functi onaries or of elected representatives The main or perhaps the only - sanction of caste rules and customs is excommunication from the caste - a contingency which a Hindu fears perhaps morc than anything else in the world in actual practice it is observed that the lower the caste in the social scale, the more efficient 
WAN IN HNDU THOUGHT 
91 
are the organization and functioning of its council. It is suggen sted that the autonomous character of castes is sometimes vitiated by the fact tbat the ling or the state assumes the ultimate authority in respect of them There have no doubt beed cases wbere the rulers have exercised their power in the matter of a per son's expulsion from or restoration to his caste But all that the Hindu dharmasastra calls upon a king to do is to see that the rules and customs of a caste are being properly observed by its members It further requires him to tale care that his own law's are as far as possible compatible with the rules and customs of the various castes 
In their original magic-ritual character, the varying status of the four social orders was perhaps not so ler, Seenly felt. All Sense of inequality must have been drowned into the ritual cere monial, through which they sought to achieve the common weal of the community and in which each of them bad a distioct and pecessary part to play But with the secularization of sarnas into astes, such gradation was bound to become more comples and pronounced Attempts were, therefore, made to palliate the Sense of inequality among castes and to rationalse the difference in the privileges and prerogatives enjoyed by persons belongog to different castes On the one band it was argued that castes were divine in orign, and, therefore, beyond the control of man On the other hand, the responsibility for the particular caste in which a person was bom was thrown on the person himself by suggesting that the actions done by an ipdividual in the preceding Ide detertained bus beredity and, therefore, caste in the next life Caste was thus regarded as a matter to be decided exclusively according to the external and inexorable law of karma It must, honever, he pointed out in this connection that the doctrine of karma not only justifies the present social status of an individual, it also offers a message of hope and sounds a note of warning. It emphatically lays done that an individual's nse or fall in the social scale in the next lfe depends entirely on the good or bad deeds which he performs in the present life with a view to cxtcouating the sense of inequality amoog casies, it is also argued92 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
that if the privileges of a higher caste are greater its responsibill. ties also are greater Further a reference may be made, in this context, to the fact that the allocation of a caste in the social scale is not necessarily rigid There is always the possibility and there have actually been instances of a caste ristag in the social scale by means of its own efforts A caste can, for instance, by changing or modifying its social and religious observances, generally improve its way of life so that its status in society is more or less automatically raised 
Before concluding this section it is necessary to say a few words about the concepts of subcaste, mixed caste, and exterior caste It has been already pointed out that endogamy 1$ one of the chief characteristics of a caste The members of a caste are, accordingly, forbidden to marry outside that caste However, it often happens that, in the normal social process, a caste is divided into smıller groups, and the restrictions relating to endogamy and, in some cases, also those relating to commeosality and general social intercourse - come to be made applicable to each of these groups in a sense, therefore, each of these groups derives the character of a caste, and, for all practical purposes, is actually regarded as a real caste But, in view of the fact that they originate within a real caste and also that their status in the caste hierarchy as a whole is determined by the caste in which they originate, these groups are often referred to as subcastes The phenomenon of mixed or intermediate caste may be best described as the result of the attempts made by Hindu law givers to regularise the position of the progeny issuing from marriages forbidden by dharma and discountenanced by custom Though marriage within the caste was laid down as the legally recognised ideal, marriages outside the caste were not altogether unknown And, perhaps under the pressure of actualities, such unequal unions were not only taken into account by the law-givers, but, in a sense, were also condoned by them The Hindu theorists, accordingly, evolved a scheme pot so much for controlling such marriages as for systematising them Marriages of males of higher castes with females of lawer castes (anuloma vidha) 
MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT 
93 
Fere viened with greater tolerance than marriages of females of higher castes with males of loner castes (praniloma virāka) It was, however laid done that the offspring of such unequal unions belonged peither to the caste of the father nor to that of the mother A Dew cadre of castes, called mixed or inter mediate astes, mas, therefore created the fact that these muted castes were not organic but nere artificial would become clear from the differences, which are quite apparent anong las gyers, in the matter of their nomenclature and legal rights and disabilities The genesis of the exterior castes, which are also koonp as outcastes or depressed castes has, on the other hand, to be traced back to the magic-ritual epoch rhen certain groups were debarred - purely on magic nitual grounds -- from partici pating in the communal ritual either directly or indirectly Even in later times this stigma continued to be attached to these groups, and they, together with similar groups from among the sodigenous Indian communities, came to be assigned to an extremely low position in the social scale Theirs t», indeed, quite an anoma lous position They are not altogether disowned by the Hindu society, but, at the same time, they are kept outside the hieratic caste system while, therefore these groups are condemped to sofier all legal social and religious disabilities to shich a low class Hindu is normally subjected, they are also denied the few advaotages, at ch would have accrued to them had they belonged to the regular caste system. Really speaking these groups are casteless in the sense that Ibey are excluded from the caste system; but they are called astes, because, among themselves, they are divided into various smaller groups, which observe the uspal Testrictions relating to eodogamy commensality, and social intercourse Incidentally it may be added that the ignominious treatment reted out to these casteless castes by the caste Hindus has been perhaps ore of the most glaring inequities of the caste Systend 
A survey of the various vicissitudes through which the insti tution of caste has passed through the ages would give us an idea as to how the several features of the system, including is inequi,

ties, actually came into being As indicated elsewhere, the Vedic society was divided into four orders - Brahmana, Rajanya, Vaisya, and Sūdra - which, strictly speaking, cappot be identified with castes in the sense in which we understand the term today This peculiar segmentation of society had as its basis the magic ritual functions which people had to perform in connection with the primitive communal sacrifice It was, therefore, necessarily influenced by all the peculiar concepts usually associated with such ritual, such as those relating to mana, taboo, polution by contact, capacity of food as the transmitter of magic power, etc The intercourse among these four orders was therefore, regulated in accordance with these concepts There did, no doubt, exist a kind of gradation among these social orders, but it was purely of a magic-ritual character These orders were not rigidly closed or exclusive groups In conformity with the magic ritual ideo logy, an upward or downward gradation was possible, though it could not have been quite frequent, because the principle of heredity soon begins to operate in matters where special functions or crafts are involved There are indications that the preeminence of the Ksatriya or Rājanya, among the four orders, was tradı tronally acknowledged perhaps because a representative of that order played the central role in the communal sacrifice How ever, in the Vedic literature, which is mainly the creation of poet priests, a conscious effort seems to have been made to glorify the function of the Brāhmana The function of the Vaisya was not clearly defined The first three orders were entitled to cere monal rebirth, which qualified them for direct participation 19 the ritual The Sūdra, who was regarded as untouchable so far as sacrifice was concerned, bad but an indirect share in it in addition to these four orders, mention is made, in the Vedic literature, also of certain occupations, like those of chariot-maker, barber, potter, etc, all of which seem to have origipated in a scheme for distributing, throughout the community, the various duties connected with the ritual There were also classes, Jike the Candilas, who seem to have been entirely debarred from participation in the communal ritual and so eventually formed the filth varna

As the result of a closer impact between the Aryan imml grants and the indigenous Indun communities, the Vedic yarnas tended to become more secular in character There are clear indi cations in the Brahmanic literature of the post-Vedic period that several closed groups were being formed in the society though they were all still included within the scheme of the four ancient orders The older gradation among the orders based on threr respective magic-ntual functions now hardened into general social Inequality, in which process the principle of bereditv played the most prominent role The position of the Brāhmanas as the specially privileged class was finally confirmed, and, correspond ingly, the Sūdras came to be degraded and suffered from several disabilmes in religious and secular matters The Ksatriyas were struggling to retain their original position of prelminesce, and the Vasyas were slosly but surely sinking in the social scale The various occupational groups nere generally assigned either to the Vaista farra or the Sudra rarna This stratification of society became so rigid that, la course of time in every single mitter, big or small - from the scales of taxation to the mode of address and salutation, from the age of 10tation to the location of crema tion-grounds - the distinction of ore varna from another and the gradation in their status were emphatically bronght out The most complete and detailed picture of this social pattern with all its ramifications is to be found in the Vanusmrti (cir 2nd century BC)51 bich has laid down that obedience to caste rules (varnadirma) was the very essence of dharma The scheme of varnas thus finally consolidated itself into a full-fledged caste system, which, with its compler variety of real castes sobcastes, mixed castes, right-band castes and left-hand castes, and exterior castes, has dominated the Hindu social life through the ages. The aggrandizement of the bigher caste at the cost of the lower caste, accordingly, continued to be the motive force of Hinda social organization. 
In the course of history voices were occasionally raised against the rigid social stratification engendered by the castę

system, but without any tangible result Neither Buddhism nor Islam can be said to have done much in the matter of the exter mination of castes In more recent times, Kapılar (Tamil), Vemana (Telugu), Basava (Lingāyata), Kabırpanthis, and Sikhs - among others -- strongly opposed caste But in the case of some of them the poison of caste recoiled on them, while the protests of the others proved sterile Theoretically the British could not have had any sympathy for the caste system But as rulers they were too shrewd directly to jaterfere with any of the social institutions prevailing in India Whenever, however, they found that some features of the caste system were likely to affect their principal aim, namely, to stabilise their power in this country they did not remain indifferent about it. For instance, they laid down that their own law would, under all circumstances, Override the laws of the various caste councils Similarly they refused to recognise the right of the Brahmanas to act as priests to all castes of the Hindus Some acts like the Special Marriage Act, which were aimed at neutral sing caste restrictions, were no doubt passed in the British regime, particularly as the result of the incessant work done in that behalf by certain Hindu legislators There was also the pressure of the new reformist movements But, on the whole, the British cannot be said to have achieved much 10 the matter of counteracting the evils of caste On the contrary, in many ways caste system proved helpful to their policy of divide and rule 
A reference may be made at this stage to the ethical ideali. sation of the caste system (actually of the varna Vyavasthā) in plied to the Bhagavadgitā There the emphasis is put not so much on the differences and the gradation among the varnas They are regarded as only incidental matters What, according to the Bhagavadgita, is really important is the principle of ethical interdependence involved in this system Society as an integrated whole can be held together and progress only if its various units properly perform the functions assigned to theme The considera tion whether a function is high or low, or whether it is to ope's hking or not, is not of any real value The feeling that, by ob

serving your farnadharma, you are actively promoting the solida nity, stability, and progress of the society as a whole is in itself a reward greater than any other to be sought after in this sorld 
The fact that the sponsors of the reformist movements in modern India have made aaste the main target of their attack against Hindu practices is likely to lead one to think that caste System has not played any useful role whatsoever in the coltoral history of lodia. It should, however be remembered that it is the institution of aste which bas enabled diverse elements of population in India to Ire together in a more or les organized form In ancient times, for instance, this social device had been mainly instrumental in regulatag and regulanising the racial fusion between the Aryan immigrants and the indigenous lodian communities Esen in later Indian history there have been sere ral instauces of foreigners being assimùated spto the Hindu fold, almost as a matter of course, through the agency of castes The facts relating to the ongn and the present status of the Rajputs are perhaps most signiblant in this respect But it is not only that the caste system, by evolving an organic shole out of diverse elements, minimised - or, in some cases, completely neutralized - the serious consequences of the social upheasal, which normally follows in the spate of the encounters of various races and peoples What is perhaps more significant is that, while doing so, it say to it that the individual cultures of those races and peoples were not adversely affected. If, today, Hindam is truly a federation of cultures, the credit for it must belong tot in a small measure, to the aste system in the cultural history of India the caste system has proved a great integrating and stabr Lising force it is, hou eser, decessary to add, in this connection, that the caste system Deser encouraged racial promicuity On the contrary, through its rigid rules regarding endozamy and exogamy, it sought to presene what is known in genetics as 'pore line 
From the point of view of the individual, the caste, to which he belonged, afforded bin a kind of social and economic security from the very beginning. There was no need for him to feel stranded, 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
for, in a sense, his status, social connections, occupation, etc were already settled for him by his caste Further, caste must have automatically served the purpose of poor law in respect of its members The restrictions placed by the caste system on the occupations to be followed by various persons could not have failed to bave certain favourable repercussions in the field of social economy Apart from the fact that the caste system achieved a kind of self sufficiency by providing for the various functions necessary to social life, it also put a natural check on unemployment and evolved a practicable scheme of division of labour Caste was also the agency by means of which several arts and crafts were adequately preserved Further, caste must be said to have generally served as an efficient form of trade union 
These are some of the items which can be shown to the credit of the caste system In the final accounting, however, it is the debit side which is likely to prove heavier Whatever the factors that were responsible for the genesis of caste, there can be hardly any doubt that, in the course of its consolidation, it turned out to be the very antithesis of the principle of the essential equality of men But what was perhaps still worse was that, by accepting heredity as the only criterion which determined one's caste, the caste system completely blocked the way for individual pro gress Whatever his ability and attainment, an individual could not even think of being up-graded in the social scale during his life time The doctrine of karma could be but a poor consolation under such circumstances The caste system is often credited - not, of course quite unjustifiably - with having afforded consi derable security to its members But for this they had to pay a heavy price Members of a caste are compared to cogs in a wheel which protected them only when they completely subordinated themselves to it 
The caste system gave rise to still more serious social evils As indicated above it implied the denial of certain cıyıl and reli gious rights to a large number of people Having created and stabilised social inequality, which was necessarily accompanied

99 
by oppression and exploitation of one class by another, the caste system proved a constant source of discontent apd unrest, and, consequently, a perennial obstruction to social progress The extreme social segmentation naturally presented the grosth of the sentiment of national poity Patriotism was not unoften misunderstood as loyalty to ope's caste, and the interests of the caste- and not of the community as a whole - became the motive force in social lfe True morality was superseded by the demands of caste roles Forther, batas beneficial in the initial stages of the economic life prosed to be quite the contrary 10 course of time Restriction on the choice of occupation, for instance, led to unemployment within a caste, abile absence of competition among castes in respect of production and trade killed all initiatrse and enterprise 
The attitude towards caste, today, is mainly threefold. Firstly, there are some people who believe that the caste system is the creation of god, that it is governed by the inetorable lan of karma, that it still has its uses, and that, therefore, it must not be-oay, it cannot be - supplanted under any circumstances, This view is too reactionary in the context of the conditions at present presailing in Jodia to deserve any serious consideration. Then there are others who would like to see the present 3,000 or more castes grouped together into the four social orders mention ed in the Purusa-sūkta, namely, Brahmana, Rajanya, Vabya, and Śūdra - these latter being allowed to preserve the main features of the caste system It will be easily seen ibat such a substitution of the four rarnas for the dumerous jātus is now neither possible nor desirable Finally there are social reformers who advocate a complete extermination of castes by all possible means It is now fully realized that, despite geographucal, climatic, racial, reh gious, and linguistic diversities, India possesses a fundamental cultural unity and continuity The caste system, which may hale once been a great integrating and stabilising force, is now proving a serious menace to that sense of upity It is rightly poicted out that the gravest exit of the caste system is that it Las rendered lodian society undemocratic and a sociological

myth One, therefore, feels inclined strongly to support the plea that an active nation wide campaign be launched against caste, both through governmental and primitive agencies in this connection it is necessary to remember that, even in the past, cfforts were occasionally made to supplant caste On account of its peculiar vitality, the system has endured in the face of all revolts against it Even today we see great loyalty being evinced to the system, even by the lower and the suppressed classes Every campaign against caste must, therefore be based on a correct estimate of the real source of its vitality 
It is also necessary to remember that conditions in modern India are changing rapidly The very pressure of the new set of circumstances bas helped to minimise the operation of many fea tures of the caste system The present economic set-up, for instance, is fast killing the occupational character of castes The growing facilities of and increasing necessity for communi cation among various people have effectively neutralized the restrictions relatiog to commensality and social intercourse It 18 found that the observance of the rigid rules regarding pollution through contact etc is now well nigh impossible in the ordinary day to day life It may be enforced only in ritual situations Further, several basic concepts of the so called philosophy of caste, such as its divine origin and its efficacy to preserve racial purity, are now completely discountenanced It may also be pointed out that the movement of bhaktı has done much in uniting the various castes into a sort of religious democracy 
There is, however, one feature of the caste system which seems to die hard, namely, its control over marriage Even an educated Hindu who claims freedom in the matter of food, social intercourse, occupation, travel, etc is seen to observe scrupu lously the matrimonial rules of caste it is suggested that this last stronghold of the caste system can be most effectively attacked only through inter caste marriages on the widest scale This 18 perhaps to beg the question Very little, indeed, can be achieved in the matter of the extermination of castes unless some radical change is effected in the economic system, which now lies at thc

root of all social relationships At any rate, it is most reassuring to find it laid down in the Constitution of the Indian Republic, which, indeed, represents the collective will of the people of India, that "the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them " and that "untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden" 
It has been rightly pointed out that one of the most outstand log paradores of Hinduism is that it gives one absolute liberty in the world of thought but enjoins upon him a strict code of conduct Whatever, therefore, might be the philosophical assevera tions of a Hindu, he would consider conscientious observance of the asramadharma and the varnadharma - more particularly of the latter - to be a duty of prime importance Thus is indeed, ma sease, as it should be Practice coscerns the whole mass of the people. Therefore, without their contorming to some disciplined and well-regulated way of life, the solidanty and stability of the Society would be dificult to achieve On the other hand, in the matter of higher thought, with wuch but a select few were really concerned, there could not be any risk in allowing those few com plete freedom As a matter of fact history shows that such freedom in belief and thought hus, more often than not, proved conducive to general progress it is necessary to add, in this connection, that, while strictly conforming to the practice, ode most not, as far possible, lose sight of the spirit underlying that practice That is, however what seems to have happened 10 respect of the aśramadharma and the varnadharmo in course of time, there developed a sort of gull between the original concept and the actual practice 
Besides the āśramadharma and the varnadharma, the Hindu theorists speak of four other kinds of dharma oamely, the varnāšramadharma or the dharma applicable to 40 individual of a particular varna at a particular stage in his personal life, the gunadharma or the dharma which concerns some distinct office or position held by an individual, the numitta-dharma or the dharma which refers to certain special curcumstances, and102 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
the sämänyadharnia or general ethics A few observations may be made here relating only to this last kind of dharma It must be pointed out, at the very outset, that the general Hindu ethics cannot be said to have been reduced to any regular code as such For, as in metaphysics so in ethics, the Hindu seems to place greater emphasis on the inculcation of a proper attitude of mind rather than on the postulation of any elaborate theories For instance, the theoretical question as to whether human will is free or pot does not seem to have particularly bothered a Hindu All that he sought to do was to neutralize his will completely through mystic union with the Supreme Being 
So far as what may be called the practical side of Hindu ethics is concerned, one is, first of all, reminded of the three cardı nal virtues enumerated in an interesting payable of tbe Brhadāra yaka-Upanisad 6 Gods, men, and demons are said to have once gone to their comnon father, Prajāpats, and requested him to instruct them To gods, Prajapati communicated the syllable da, which they correctly understood to be the symbol of the instruction, dāmyata," practise self control" To men also, Prajapati communicated the syllable da, which ibey understood 10 the sense, dalta --"practise charity" To demons, likewise, Prajāpati communicated the syllable da, which, in their case, denoted dayadlvam - practise compassion” The Upanised further tells us that all beings are frequently reminded of this triple instruction of Prajāpati relating to the three cardinal virtues of self control (dama ), charity (dana),59 and compassion (dayā) through the thundering of clouds which produces the sound da da da The Bhagavadgitā has mentioned, in different contexts quite a large number of other virtues, such as, for instance, fearlessness ( abhaya), purity of mind ( sath asamsuddhi), sacrifice (Jajna), uprightness (ārjaya), nop violence (ahımsa), truth (sarja ), freedom from anger (akrodha), renunciation

56 The word charity is not used in the sense of merely giving alms It rather implics sharing what one has with one's fellow beings, not being sellish, and, therefore, loving one', fellow beings

(trāga), tranquility (arn), aversion to fault-finding (opaisuna), freedom from covetousness (aloluparra), gentleness (mārdara), modesty (hr), and steadicess (acapala) 57 It also enjoias on man the avoidance of certaio vices – more particularly of lust (härra), anger (krodha), and greed (lobha), which represent the 'triple gate of hell', leading to the run of the soul * The Huda concept of sin is, indeed, very comprebensive and includes withm itself several views expressed on different plages-from the most primitive view which represents sin as a disease to the most elevated one huch represents it as the denial of soul or betrayal of self, some of the other views berog those which regard sm as debt or as breach of caste rules, or as defiance of god, or as being out of harmony with the spintual eartronmeots, or as lack of spiritual power It will be thus seen that the general practical ethics of the Hirdus is much the same as that of the Lost of the civilised peoples But if the Hindus have anywhere distinguished themselves it is in their special emphasis on truth (santo), con-violence ( ahimsā), sacrifice (Jajfia), and renuncia tion ( sam āsa ), which, according to them, are not merely passive virtues, but represent positive social morality 
Very little need be said about truth. Attention may only be drawn to the Upaniadic parable about Satyakāma Jābūla. When asked about his antecedents by his teacher, Satyalāma gave a straightforward reply that he did not really know from wbat family he had come, but that he only knehis mother's Dame, and that she had told him that she did not know from 
bat father be was born herself having led a very santop life in ber youth On accouot of this pure aod unadulterated truth told by him, the son of Jabālā was forthwith accepted by the teacher as a worthy pupu for spiritual instruction This parable emphasues that truthfulness 15 to be recognised as the only criterion of an individuals character and position As for ahımsā, it is the cosmic outlook of the Hindus which teaches

them to respect all life - Indeed, all god's creation This is the positive aspect of ahimsa Closely allied with this is the teaching regarding armaupamya, that is, seeing with equality everything in the image of one's own self,co and sarvabhūtahita, that is, doing good to all creatures 61 It 18, indeed, well said that the doctrine of ahımsā, with its host of implications, is of far greater importance than the costliest philanthropic institutions The concept of sajñia must be said to be dominating the entire Hindu view of life The form and extent of sacrifice may have varied from age to age but its underlying spirit, expressed in the words, " fostering each other you shall attain to the supreme good",&* has endured throughout The Bhagavadgita, indeed, describes the whole upiverse as a "wheel of sacrifice "93 which operates of the ethical principle of mutual interdependence among its constituents No one must be remiss in playing bis appointed part in that sacrifice, lest the proper functioning of the world would be adversely affected 
The concept of samnyása (renunciation in Hinduism has been very much misunderstood It is often suggested that samnjäsa is a negative virtue, that it is not a social value, and that a samnjāsın has no social personality It cannot be denied that the actual practice of samnyasa in popular Hinduism gave sufficient ground for such characterisation But the true ideal in this respect is represented in the Bhagavadgitā, which reconciles samnyasa with the ideal of lokasamgraha ( solidarity of the society and maintenance of the universe) and the doctrine of yajña A true samjásın is one who practises renunciation in action and and not of action The Bhagavadgitā, indeed, lays down in the following words the motto, which, according to Hinduism, should govern the role of man in relation to the world “There fore, without attachment, perform always the work that has to be done, for man attains to the highest by doing work without attachment” (First published ABORI 43, 1963, 1-57 )
