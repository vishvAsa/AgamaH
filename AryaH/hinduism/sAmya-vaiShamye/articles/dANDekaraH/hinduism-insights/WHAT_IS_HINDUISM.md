Hınduism is, in any respects, a unique plenoreron in the history of religions Indeed, Hırdaism can tardi, be called a religion in the popularly coderstood sense of the term Unlike most religions, Hinduism does pot regard the concept of god as being central to it Hiccusm is not a system of theology - It does not make any dogmatic afirmation regarding the nature of god And, yet, shat often appear, confusing to superficial ob servers is that the Hicdus are seen to worship many gods though they may be actually believing 17 oply ope god as the sipgle ultimate reality Similarly, Hicdaism does not venerate any particular person as its sole prophet or founder It does not also recognize any particular bool as its absolutely authoritate scripture Further, Hirdem dos cot insist on any particular religous practice as being obligaton, por does it accept any doctrine as its dogma Hioddisin can also pot te identified with a specific woral code Hindy sm, as a rel gop does not convey any defpite or unitary ide3 There is no dogma or practice which can be said to be eitter bonersel or essential to Hmdois as a #bole lodeed, those sho call themselves Hindus may not peces sarily have such 18 commop as regards faith or worship What 15 essential for one section of the Hindu commud'ty may not be necessarily so for apotter lodeed, even within a particular sect of Hindum, the essentials can hardly be separated from the non essentials Towithstacdıng all this Hiodam tas persisted through centuries as a distinct religious epttv.

be specially witended to nor a particular problem to be deliberately pondered over He views life as an integrated whole and its various aspects as being intrinsically interdependent This may account for there being no word in Sanskrit to denote religion as it is popularly understood The word dl arma, which is usually employed as a synonym for religion, has a far wider connotation Broadly speaking dharma implies the whole compler of theories and prectices relating to the actualities and aspriations of the mate rial and spiritual life of the individual and the society Dharma, to a Hindu, is, accordingly, co extensive with life it may be said to signify the entire way of life, which, however, is not neces sarily and in all respects identical in the case of all those who call themselves Hindus 
Hinduism is, in a sense, an ethnic religion It was not reveal. ed to a prophet and then either propagated among or imposed upon the people The Hindus are verily born and grow in Hin duism and this condition of birth is so compulsive that many petsons who are born of Hindu parents have generally to con form to Hinduism though they may not believe in many of its doctrines and practices It has now become almost a truism to say that Hinduism defies all attempts at definition One can hardly assert that a person is entitled to be called a Hindu only if he believes in certain doctrines and follows certain practices or that he forseits his claim to be called a Hindu if he does not believe in certain doctrires and does not follow certain practices 
Attempts have no doubt been made, from time to time, to lay down some criteria of Hinduism Belief in the absolute validity of the Veda is, for instance, often mentioned as a distinc tive attribute of a Hindu Actually, however one can be a good and devout Hindu without having to profess such a belief The various schools of Tantrism may be referred to as an instance in point Morcover such a definition ultimately proves to be singu farly vague and nebulous For, the Veda, as we know it, being a collection of essentially heterogeneous and in some cases, even self-contradictory texts one would, indeed, find it difficult to accept the whole of it as being equally valid and binding One

to a vanety of interpretations, no one of which can be said to be invested with absolute authonty Obsersance of caste-rules is certainly a score potent criterion It is neither the disasowal of any particular doctrine nor the devzation from any particular religious practice that has been regarded as a serious lapse on the part of a Hiddo it is rather the non-conformity to the aste-rules which has been regarded as such But even this latter may entail the loss of one s caste-ratus, it does not necessarily entail the loss of bis Hindu religion It may also be pointed out that caste rules are scripturally and conventonally behered to be non ope rative in respect of certain classes of Hindos, such as ascetics and sanm ăsirs Strictly speaking, Hinduism 25 a religion must deeds be distinguisbed from Hinduism as a social organization In this connection, it is significant that in recent times, responsible Hindu thinkers, who are leer on the presensation and promotion of Hinduism as religion, regard caste-system as a veritable corse and openly advocate its abolition Incidentally, it may also be noted that conditions of modero Ife have actually tended to re move the caste-bamers among the Hindus to a large extent Thus, observance of traditional caste-rules cannot be any longer regarded as a universalls vald critenop of Hmdoism The belief 
the sanctity of the con and the Brāhmana is too superficial a feature to be considered seriously in this context One cannot also speak of any sacraments being obligatory to all the Hindus Doctrines regarding Zrman karma samsārd, and molsa may per haps be regarded as atiomatic in many schools of Hindu philo sophy, but they are by no means either upisersal or essential so far as Hindu religion 15 concerned For, a person can claim to be a good Hindu without believing in any or all of these doctrines, while a person is not entitled to be called a Hindu only because he accepts any or all of these doctrines 
The word “Hindu ", it must be remembered, is of a foreign origin It is also of a fairly fate origin Actually, most of what

is usually understood by the term " Hinduism" or "Hindu reli gion" had been in existence since very much long before that term came into vogue Indeed, the term “Hinduism" came to acquire its specific and complex socio-religious significance only in comparatively recent times Originally, the term “Hindu" seems to have had a purely geographical connotation The people who lived on the other side (that is, on the eastern side ) of the river Indus were loosely called Hindus And, even after that name had, as it were, become naturalised, it was for a long time understood in a more or less negative sense Whoever was born in India and was not a Muslim or a Christian or a Parsi, etc , was called a Hindu Obviously, such a negative description can hardly serve our present purpose It is sometimes suggested that the term “Hindu " is an essentially juridical term, and that a Huodu may be most conveniently defined as a person to whom the Hindu law becomes applicable in the law courts of India But this would amount to arguing 10 a circle, for, Hindu law itself cannot be defined except as the law which is generally made appii cable to the Hindus Moreover, the Hindu law does not become applicable to all the Hindus in the same manner and to the same extent Conversely, it is seen that all those who are today governed by the Hindu law do not necessarily profess Hindu religion Such, for instance, are the Sikhs, the Jainas, and the Buddhists The relationship between Hinduism and the Hindu law is by no means comparable with that between Islam and the Muslim civil law 
Hinduism cannot thus be said to be amenable to any theo logical definition or sociological test or juridical characterisation One has, therefore, inevitably to fall back upon the very simple definition namely, that a Hindu is one who is born of Hindu parents and who has not openly abjured Hinduism This defini fion also, no doubt involves the defect of petitio principu, but, in view of the great antiquity of Hinduism, that defect may be treates as more upruent har. 9221 22 may not te legarútá as seriously yitinting that definition However, the real difficulty here would be in respect of recent converts to Hindu religion

By the very nature of its origin and youth, Hinduism has been exceedingly tolerant - tolerant towards other religions and tolerant towards itself It cannot, however, be said that this to leracce has always represented a sublimation of religious feelings or that it has, in every case, ben deliberate and discriminating, But Hinduisto has by and large, always tended to incorporate and assimilate rather than to choose and eliminate Hinduism is also a remarkably free religion --a rebgion which is cofranelled by any fixed creeds, dogmas, or rituals In the course of its long history, it has manifested a vaique capacity for almost infinite expansion One of its basic assumptions seems to bare been that, thougb relgious practices and beliefs were bound to change according to different times and different curces, they could all be comprehended mithin a larger Unuty Accordingly, Hiodaism has always been variable, elastic, and receptie 
Hinduism is essentially dynamic Unlike many religions, which are prophetic or creedal and which, therefore, necessarily tend to remain static it has exhibited, throughout history, a remarkable elasticity and responsiveness to the geeds of different comment ties and to the demands of different ages and regions It has Deyer hesitated to sponsor dew scriptores, des gods, and new institutions It has rejected noge, it has selcomed within its fold all those who have sought its spiritual ladership and social protection and sustenance It thos represents different levels of religious belief and practice and different stages of cultu ral developroept, and offers almost endless grades of spiritual possibilities Indeed the tho great ments of Hipdubm bart becn its concern for the specific spiritual competence of a person (adhıkāra) and its readiness to allow him freedom of worship piog bys chosen dividity (ustadesala) A reference may be made in this very contest to another feature of Hinduism, namely, that Hindu worship is personal ratter than congregatonal in charac ter A Hindu feels as uninhibited adopting any particular religious practice as 10 subscribing to any part cular doctrine 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
The result of all this has been manifold It is true that Hinduism has rarely been guilty of religious persecution It is also true that the tendency of Hinduism to absorb and sanctify whatever it came across has been to a large extent responsible for the fact that it spread all over Jodia rapidly and without resorting to any active proselytisation It may be further pointed out to the credit of Hinduism that the religious absorption which it pro moted was invariably accompanied by a social absorption and Teadjustment But on the debit side it must be mentioned that the over tolerant and absorptive attitude of Hinduism has resulted in lowering the average level of its doctrines and ritual And, what is perhaps still more serious, Hinduism has, on account of this trait, all along been deprived of the compactness and distract characterisation which normally invest a religion with a peculiar strength It should, therefore not be surprising that Hinduism has never encouraged a theocratic state or that it has hardly ever become a state religion 
If one might at all speak of any distinctive features of Hinduism, one could mention the belief in the ideological complex of karma sansära mohsa on the metaphysico ethical plane and the acceptance of caste system on the socio ethical plane Incidentally, even here, since Hinduism is essentially an ethnic religion, it is the lattor feature which has come to be regarded as the more basic and compelling of the two As the result of his original igno rance, man gets involved in a whole cycle of existences which has been revolving since eternity (samsāra ) - his doings in the course of one life inexorably governing the nature and conditions of his next life in a perpetual chain of causality (harma) His religio philosophical summum bonum lies in mok sa or his be coming free from this involvement through the realisation of his true nature, that is to say, of his essential identity with the one absolute reality A Hindu is, accordingly, ever obsessed with the quest for moh sa, and his attitude towards life is generally deter. mined by his conviction that a single life in a whole cycle of existences is valueless from the ultimate point of view On the other hand, however, a Hindu does not altogether ignore his 
WHAT IS HINDUISV? 
individual mundane life -- he makes it serve as the ground for his efforts to attain molsa He believes that the existence in fiux holds a promise for the existence in essence He further believes --and this is perhaps far more important that the manner m which he Ines bus fife vitally affects the security and solidanty of the society to which he belongs A proper co-ordination between the philosophico-ethical ideal of mok sa and the socio-ethical ideal of dharma, wbuch latter is believed to have found its most typical espression in the form of varrásrama dharma and wluch is re garded as investing the phenomeoal etistence with a meaning and a purpose, may be said to constitute the most central problem of Hinduism Joksa, it is realised is theoretically attainable by any individual by himself, but dharma has to adjust itself with a 
given social situation 
Apother problem, which has often figured prominently in the history of Hinduism and thich, in the ultimate analysis, is just a reflection of the problem referred to above, relates to the conflict between the traditional dharma or the way of life prescribed in scriptural tests and the eternal or absolute dharma which reveals itself to the enlightened one and to which the traditional dharma attempts to give but a practical expression It is something like the conflict between ‘liw' and `justice' The attitude of Hindu ism in this respect is ambivalent - on the one hand, it inslots on the subordination of the sense of right to the sense of duty, while, on the other, it unequivocally states that, at a certain stage in his spiritual advancement, the true seeker may set aside the injunc tions of the traditional dharma 
It needs to be remembered that Hieduism is not a unitary concept or phenomenon nor a monolithic structure It is, there fore, hardly possible to make any statement which can become applicable, without exception, to Hinduism as a whole Hindu ism is, ideed, 25 unpredictable as human nature In the last analysis, a study of Hinduism would invariably amount to a study of the various Hindu castes aod sects The Hindu society ts cut up horizontally into castes and vertically into religious 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
sects - the horizontal stratification having been originally more rigid and more exclusive than the vertical one 
Hinduism appears to be marked by several paradoxes and polarities For instance, it emphasizes religious equality among all men and at the same time not only connives at but actually promotes a rigorous social hierarchy It allows complete free dom in the matter of belief but insists on a rigid conformity to caste-rules And what is particularly striking is that, though the lower castes suffer from many disabilities both in the religious and social spheres, one finds that the lower the caste is in the social hierarchy the more religiously conservative and conformistic it usually happens to be Hinduism does not insist on any set form of worship, but this fact itself has given rise to a veritable plethora of religious practices Similarly, on the one hand, Hinduism regards god as a superfluity, while, on the other, it sponsors a deeply emotional theism as the noblest form of reli gion On the one hand, it lays down rigorous austerities and penances for the sake of religious discipline, while, on the other, It seems to permit various orgiastic and sensualistic rites On the one hand it extols moksa, jñana, and samnāsa as the highest religious ideals, while on the other, it also prescribes elaborate rituals which are believed to win starga for their punctılıous per former Hinduism does not countenance any dichotomy of reli gion and philosophy Philosophy is believed to involve man in a very profound manner It is, indeed, understood to be essentially an applied - and not merely theoretical or contemplative - disci pline it aims at concrete, tangible results It is certainly signi ficant that the Upanısads and similar texts often speak of vidjas (pragmatic philosophical doctrines ) rather than of jñana (pure academic knowledge ) Philosophy is thus regarded as an inte gral part of religion This would also account, in some measure, for the paradoxes and polarities mentioned above But the true glory of Hinduism consists in presenting all these polarities and paradoxes as also the various levels of doctrine and practice as constituting a single well coordinated religious system (First published Sinert al Indological Siwlics, Dullt, 1975, 60–96 ]
