Proto-Historic Hudakto 
Hinduism is in no sepse revealed to or founded by any pro phet or messiah. It is, therefore not possible to speak of the specific origin of that religion All that we may do in this connection is to go back to the earliest period in the history of India when some of the distinctive features of the Hindu religion as we know it today had already become manifest Not many years ago, the spade of the archaeologist unearthed a whole civilizauon in the salley of the river Indus - first centering round Mohenjo Daro and then primarily round Harappa - and thereby gave quite a nen onentation to the history of India The age of the newly discovered Indus civilization - which is now more popularly known as the Harappan Civilization - is generally believed to have extended from 3500 BC to 2200 BCA considerable amount of material has become available from the excavations carned out at Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and other related sites which throws ample light on the various aspects of that civilization, including religion. Indeed, tbe lcdus valley religion 15 perhaps the earliest form of religion in India about which one day make some statement which is sopportable by a more or less taggible evidence Even on a cursory examination, the lodos religion is seen to display certain traits which, on the one hand, conspicuously differentiate it from the Vedic Aryan religion, which, incidentally, had for a long time been looked upon- of course, erropeously-as the fountain-head of Hinduism but which can now be shown to bare exercised but a formal and superficial influence on that religion, and, on the other, establish close and direct affiliations with what may be called classical or historical Hinduism whose many ramifications continue to become esident even to this day Thus, essenually, the Indus religion is

a form of Hinduism and may, 10 contradistinction to classical or historical Hinduism, be styled as proto hustonc Hinduism It may, accordingly, be said to represent the first period of the history of Hinduism 
Naturally enough, the sources for the reconstruction of the Indus religion are rather limited We do not have any literature or popular tradition relating to it We have to depend mainly on such objects as seals, sealings, figurines, and stone images dis covered at the various archaeological sites wlich have lard open different phases of the Indus civilization But all this material is quite illuminating and can be fruitfully exploited if worked upon with 'scientific imagination. The first thing which would strike even a casual observer is that, unlike the Vedic religion, the Indus religion was essentially iconolatrous, which feature, rocidentally, is seen to have been shared with it by the Hinduism of the later periods One of the most important objects derived from the cicavations in the Indus valley, which may be presumed to throw much useful light on the religion of the period, is the seal, dis covered at Mohenjo Daro, depicting a three-faced nude male deity with horns, seated on a stool, with penis erectus and with his heels pressed closely together in what is obviously some specific yogic posture This god is shown with an elephant, a tiger, a rhinoceros, and a buffalo surrounding him and with antelopes under his seat He is seen to be wearing a large number of bang. les on each arm and a pectoral round his neck, and a fan shaped head dress Tises between the lions The inscription of six or seven letters appearing at the top of the seal is not yet satisfacto. sily deciphered - Indeed none of the pictographs from the Indus valley has been so deciphered - and cannot accordingly enlighten us on the true character of the figure But the cumulative evidence of the various details depicted on the seal would seem to lead to only one conclusion, namely, that the Mohenjo Daro god was akin to-or cven identical with the Sıva of classical Hinduism The tres faces clearly suggest the irimukha Siva and would

proto-Dravidian aspect, for instance, the god of this religion was celebrated as a 'red' god and was actually called Siva (which word in Proto Dravidian means 'red') The religious practices relating to Siva consisted mainly of pūjā (which word, derived from Proto-Dravidian, originally signified the besmearing of the god's icon presumably with the offerings of blood, thus confirming the redness' of the god) and balı ( which originally meant the offerings of raw oblations like uncooled flesh) Apart from the crude icons reddened with blood, the god of the proto Dravidians seems to have been worshipped also in to other forms, namely, the phallus and the bull 
Two other aspects of proto-Siva seem to have been referred to in a Vedic text, namely, the Satapatha-Brāhmana According to that Brāhmana (1 738), proto-Sıva was celebrated as Sarva by the Prācyas or the people of Eastern India and as Bhava by the Vähikas on the Bāhlikas in the North-West 
The religion of proto-Siva, which had thus taken deep roots in various parts of India, seems to have been temporarily over shadowed during the interlude when the Vedic Aryan religion bad been firmly and repidly extending its jpfluence But that pre Vedic non-Aryan religion could not be altogether smothered or even ignored Actually, the Vedic religion adapted - or, rather, was construined to adapt - within itself some of the features of that religion, though with evident hesitancy and reluctance The Vedic Rudra represents, both in name and character, an aryanised version of the proto historic Siva Some other features of the religion of proto Sıva also are reflected in some Vedic hymns such as the hymns relating to the muni (that is, the ascetic in ecstasy Rgreda X 136 ), the bralımacārın (that is, the observer of the rigorous vows Athari aveda XI 5), and the yrātyas (that is, the followers of the cult of wandering mendicancy Atharvaveda XV) At the same ume, some Vedic texts suggest, in quite unequivocal terms, the antagonism of the Vedic Aryans towards the followers of the religion of proto Stva, who are variously represented a

Vedic Religion 
From the point of view of the history of Hinduism as a whole the Vedic Arjan period may be said to have occurred more or less 35 an interlude It was no doubt an eventful and highly significant period but ihe religious ideology of that period did not certainly exercise on the formation and character of bestoncal Hinduism as sital and far-reacbing an influence as it is usually believed to have done in a sense, historical Hinduism arose as a kind of reaction against the peculiar religio-philosophical cond tions which had been engendered by Vedism - particularly by its later phases Honever the attitude of the sponsors of historical Hinduism was thoroughly realistic and pragmatic. They fully realised the extent and profuodity of the influence of the Vedic way of life and thought and therefore decided, as 3 practical measure, not to alienate themselves completely from it Hia. duism accordingly, not only did not turn its back od Vedic beliels and practices but it actually professed an allegiance to the Veda Itsas tightly anticipated that such as allegiance, homso ever formal and tenuous it might prose in actual practice would belp Hinduism in its escounter with the so-called beretic religious movements of the early post-Vedic period 
The Vedic religion, it needs to be remembered was essectually exouc on the Indian soil and, in the vigour of this very erotic Dess, it succeeded in rapidly overs belming the religious complex of the pre-Vedic non-Aran India But, as has been pointed out earlier, it could not obliterate the latter completely Vedism itselt was constrained to assimilate some of its features, albeit reloc tantly, while many of its other features remained generally dormant - but quite viablo among certain strata of society - uptil they acre resuscitated with the rise of Hinduism

Unlike the proto hustoric Hinduism, the Vedic religion can boast of an ample and varied literature relating to it, namely, the Veda Though the Veda is a collection of texts which are essen tially varied from the point of view of literary forms and contents, It is also characterised by the great hall mark of Indian culture, namely, unity in diversity for the sake of the convenience of proper understanding the cultural age represented by the Veda is usually divided into three distinct periods, namely, the Samhita period, the Brāhmana-period, and the Upanisad period It may be emphasised that these three periods constitute not only a chronological sequence but also a remarkable logical sequence It is, verily, this logical sequence which invests the multifarious Veda with a kind of unity Broadly speaking, the Samhılās (only the two primary Samlıtās, namely, the Rgveda and the Athana. seda, may be taken into account here ), the Brālimanas, and the Uranı sads respectively reflect the three phases of the Vedic religion namely, mythology (RV) and magic (AV), ritualism, And spiritualism of course, such a stratification of religious ideology must hy no means be regarded as exclusive It has a reference only to the main tendencies The Rgveda 
It was once generally believed that Vedic mythology was naturalistic in character - that it mainly symbolised natural powers and phenomena It is, however, now realised that the narrow frame work of naturalsın is quite inadequate to contain the rich variety of Vedic mythology It was, of course, inevitable that the overwhelming phenomena of nature, with which the Vedic Aryans must have become habituated, should have deeply influ. enced their mythology, ritual, and poetry But those phenomena cannot be said to have constituted the exclusive basis - or even the cssential factor - of Vedic mythology Other approaches to Vedic mythology, such as philological', 'chno sociological', or 'my stic psychological' are also now found to be quite inadequate by themselves Similarly, generalisations such as that Vedic mytho logy is a mythology in decay or that it is a mythology in the mak ing, are hardly pertinent Vedic niythology is essentially an evolu.

15 
tionary mytholog Its general character has changed in accor dance Rith the vicissitudes in the cultural life of the Vedic people For instance, it would be seen that a certain specific god was re garded as supreme and sovereign in a certain specific period. The reason for this was that the character and personality of that god were in full copformity with what may be called the ethos of that period This is one aspect of evolutionary mythology The other aspect of it is that though the basic character of a dividity was determined by the peculiar environments in which it had come into being that character did oot remain static and stagnant through out It underscot vanous modifications in accordance with the changing conditions of the life of the Vedic Anans to the course of its evolution, many new features gradually accutoulated round that drits so that the total personality which it finally presented was highly complex It is, however not altogether impossible to analyse the complex character and personality of a Vedic god generally isolate from one another the anjous elements 1p that character, and then broadly mark out the different stages in the evolution of that god 
Cosmic mythology represented one of the earliest phases of the religious ideology of the Vedic Anans They generally cele brated the divine parents, Dyauh and Prtbui, but the normal growth of these divities into full-fledged Father Sky and Mother Earth respectively seems to have been arrested in the Veda On the other hand, Vedic mythology emphasised another sigoificant feature in this connection, namely, that the unnerse, vast as it was, was pot a chaos, but that it was a cosmos AD inexorable 11w (Rta ) govered in a subtle manoer, the working of both macrocosm and microcosm The concept of the cosmic law or Rta became the centre of a whole mythological complex involving Varuna, Mitra, Adityas and Aditi Varuna, the "binder" god, held together the estire unnerse by means of his fetters (pasas ) and thereby enforced 11$ regular operation He also punished the transgressors of his law with those very pāsas Varuoa s pa as thus possessed a doubl., significajce - cosmological and ethical Varuna could erercise his authority over the upl

verse as supreme ruler (samrāt) because he was asura or the possessor of asu The concept of asu is perhaps most central in Vedic religious ideology Indeed, it is seen to have vitally influenced the whole religio-philosophical thought of ancient India It was believed that an all pervading magical potence substance penetrated through the universe and thereby invested it, so to say with existence and life This magical potence served as the essential basis of the various aspects of creation such as gods, men animals, trees etc There was, accordingly, an essential qualitative unity throughout the universe It was the varying quantity of this somatic magical potence, which the different aspects of creation such as gods, men, animals, trees, etc, possessed that made them different from one another The Vedic Aryans designated this all penetrating magical potence as asu The larger the quantity of Osu one possessed, the greater was the magical power which he could wield Varuna could effectively enforce the cosmic law Rta because he was believed to have possessed the largest quantity of asu -- because he was asura It may be incidentally pointed out that the godhead of the Vedic gods depended mainly upon their sharing in the magic potence asu 
The conditions of life of the Vedic Aryans changed substan tially when they started on their migratory march from the region of Balkh towards Saptasındhu and, true to its evolutionary character, Vedic mythology also changed its main aspect from the costic to the heroic Indra, the war-god, now came to occupy the supreme position which had been held by the cosmic sovereign Varuna Apart from this manifestation of the evolutio nary character of Vedic mythology as a whole, that character becomes particularly evident in the development of the mythologi. cal personality of Icdra In a sense, lodra is the only god in the Veda with a real mythology associated with him the starting point of the Indra-mythology is the mythologisation of history Originally lodra was a human hero who led the Vedic Aryans ia their victorious encounters with the antagonistic tribes which were collectively referred to in the Veda as Vitras and Dāsas, and their

consequent colonisation and establishment of sovereignty in Saptasındhu fadra's epithet puramdara ( smasher of fortresses) would suggest that that intrepid war-commander of the nomadic tribes of the Vedic Aryans was mainly responsible for demolishing at least the last vestiges of the fortified settlements of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan Indus civilisation in this connection Indra s hostility towards the Yatis and the Spadevas which has been referred to earlier, gains special significance It must not, however, be supposed that all the exploits ascribed to Indri in the Veda were achieved by a single individua) Such ascription is obviously the result of the institutionisation of the individual which marks a distinct stage in the process of the mythologisation of history 
Indra, the human hero who was transformed into the pational war-god, is seen to dominate the entire mythology of the Rgreda, because the Rgreda-Sanitā as te hare it today relates mainly to the period of conquest and colonisation in the history of the Vedic Aryans Indeed Indra became the symbol of the bieratic religion of the Agreda, and the status of the other Vedic gods in that religion was determined by the oature of the relationship which those gods claimed with Indra 
With the conquest of the Vrtras and the Disas ard the subsequent colonisation by the Vedic Aryans in Saptasındha, the historical role of ladra came to an end aod his c'ythological role began to be emphasised This was accomplished by superimpos ing upon lodra, basic hunad-bustorical character certain cosmic features Indra the vanquisher of human foes, began to be represented as the vanquisher of Vrtras in nature - he came to be glorified as a rain-god or a storm-god The overpowering of constricting forces in nature and the epliening of cosmic life attributed to Indra was but a cosmicised projection of an authen tic socio-political event in the history of the Vedic Alyans There were still other features which came to be added to the Indra mythology in the course of its evoltron lo almost all ancient mythologies there 1 to be found the primul myth of the conflict between the hero and the dragon, 10 some form or another In the course of the evolution of Vedic mythology, Indra came to be 
INSIGUITS INTO HINDUISM 
represented as the hero and his principal cnemy Vítra as the dragon 
Two other gods who had become prominent in the religion of the Rg cda were Soma and Agni The religious concept of Soma had arisen already during the proto Aryan period, but, then, Soma had been connected with cult rather than with mythology Originally, Soma was a specific plant, primarily derived from the Mūjarat mountain whose bitter astringent juice played a central role in the simple cultic rites of the Aryans But, while the human hero Indra was evolving into the national war god, Soma cime to be invested with some kind of mythological significance It was suggested that Indra achieved his many heroic exploits under the invigorating inebriation produced by the offerings of Soma made to him Agni, like Soma was mythologically not very significant but his cultic importance was very great If Indra was the pivot of Vedic mythology, Agni was the pivot of Vedic ritual Incidentally, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between the mythological Agni and the ritual fire 
It may be presumed that, side by side with the hieratic reli gion of the Samhitā-period, some glimpsos into which have been given above, there had been in existence various forms of what may be called popular and tribal religions Some of these latter, which, incidentally, need to bu distinguished from the religion of the masses as is for instance, represented in the Athanaveda, seem to have become quite a force to reckon with in the religious life of the community - indeed, so much so that the Vedic poet priests were constrained to accommodate them in their mythologi cal scheme This gave rise to yet another motif in the evolutio nary Vedic mythology, namely, hierarchisation of popular cults The most common procedure adopted by the Vedic poet-priests for admittiug a popular divinity into the pantheon of hieratic gods was to associate that divinity - may be in a forced and artificial manner - With Indra who had become the very symbol of berone Vedir rela Mwaer, in the worse of sorok hrvatore upgrading of a popular divitty, the Vedic poct priests, on the one hand scrupulously suppressed such features of the character 
HINDUISM RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT 
of that popular dividity as were disagreeable to the sophisticated hieratic mentality, and, on the other, emphasised such other features of its character as could suggest - however faintly and indirectly - a possible similarity between that divinity and some hieratic god Bat, in so te of such tendentious manipulation on the part of the Vedic poet-priests, some significant traits of the basic ard essential character of that popular divinity did not fail to lurk in the representation of that divinity in the hieratic Vedic mythology 
A typical example of such hierarchisation is Visnu - an on ginal fertility-god conceived jo a bird-form who, in the process of his upgrading, was artificially associated with Indra and then came to be regarded as a solar divinity, his origmal bird-form having facilitated the transition from the fertility-bird to the sun bird and then to the solar divinity It may be added in this context, that solarization, that is to say, the superimposition, at some stage and for one reason or another, of the solar character upon the dividities who had originally nothing to do with the sun, was another common motif in the evolution of Vedic mythology Besides Visnu, Pusan, Mitra and Savitr were subjected to such solarization 
It is true that, by and large the aspect of the Vedic religion, which was represented in the Rgveda, comprised mainly of mythological traditions and prayers There sas however, ano ther item of religio-philosophical significance which seems to have interested the authors of the Pgreda, and that was cosmology Several Vedic gods were represented as haviog been responsible for the creation, organization and sustenance of the universe, This may be accounted for by the general asuistic' trend of the Vedic mythology Besides such mythological descriptions, however, there are a few typical cosmological theories which have been adumbrated in the Rgleda Io one of the bymas (Rgreda X 121 ), for instance, the process of creation t said to have

started with the emergence of the golden embryo This hymn is important also from another point of view It reflects the Vedic poet's feeling of the general inadequacy of the mytho logical gods and his consequent groping for the true godhead 5 Another hymn (Rgveda X 90), popularly known as the Purusa sūkta describes the universe as resulting from the ntual self inmolation of a hermaphrodite god-man A third current of cosmological thought is represented by the famous Nāsadiya-sūkta (Rgdeda X 129 ), which, in a way, anticipates the later Upani sadic speculation in this behalf 
The Rgvedic religion was untconic, but it seems to have promoted a kind of domestic worship centering round the family fire and usually carried out without the intervention of profes sional priests The Rgvedic ritual, as compared to the later brahmanic ritual, was quite rudimentary in character The employment of various Rgvedic verses in connection with the sacrificial ritual was clearly an after thought, those verses were origioally by no means intended for that purpose The Rgvedic religion was also free from most of the extravagances of the theistic Hindu cults, though, it may be incidentally pointed out, the germs of the bhahnı doctrine, which later became almost the hall-mark of classical Hinduism can be discovered in such hymas as those which refer to the peculiar personal relationship between Varupa and Vasistha 
Philosophising as such was rare in the Rgieda though it can. not be said to have been altogether foreign to it. One of the most significant features of the religious ideology of the Rgieda is the belief in the magic potence of the mantra or the cultically pro nounced word The mantras possessed a kind of compelling power, and, if properly uttered and employed, they would never fail to achieve the desired end There are also to be found in the Rgveda some indications of religious ecstasy and mystic exaltation, but these are presumably the result of the influence of the religious

practices of proto-historical Hinduism It is to be specially noted that the Rgvedic Aryans gever thought of this life as being just one in the unending cycle of existences aod therefore of little ccasequence, nor did they believe in its being predestiged by the law of Karma and consequently initiative-deterrent Their general attitude was, therefore, essentially life-affirming, dynamic, free from pessimistic gloom, and full of bearty genial piety and feeling of buoyancy and cheer A happy, secure, and prosperous family. life bad always been the goal of the Rg edıc Aryaas The Atharranc Magic 
It needs to be emphasised that, from the point of view of the history of religion, the paredu and the 4tl arvaveda have to be regarded as being contemporaneous and as relating to the same community of the Vedic Agads - the Preda berag, by and large, the Veda of the classes and the 4than greda the Veda of the masses Naturally enough, in comparison with the Rgveda, the scope of the Atharrapeda is much wider apd its contents of a more Varied interest It is free from the sophistication and priestly hierarcby which characterise the Rgveda It concerns itself with the common life of the common man from its pre-gatal to post mortem stage, with all its light dod shade, and often reflects 
obscure human emotions and uncarny human relations 
The basic concepts of the Atharvaseda ideology were that all eristiog eptilies participated in the same all-perradiog somatic magic potence, that, therefore, there was no real scope for such differentiation as between spint and matter or the living and the Life-less or the person and the thing or the abstract and the concrete, and that, - and this is of particular sigauticance from the point of view of the religion of the Athariareda - the magic potence in an eatity could be enhanced or diminished or trans ferred to another entity by means of cultic incantations and action More than any other Veda, the Athartareda aimed at achieving some definite practical end, and that too in a direct tangible manger 
A rather unexpected feature of the Atharrateda is that it contains more matter which can be called phulosophical than anyINSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
other Samlua The occurrenee of such philosophical material 10 a book of magic need by no means be regarded as the result of a secondary fusion It should be remembered that the dividing line between magic and 'non-learned' philosophy is very thin Indeed, much of the later Upadisadıc philosophy may be described as the ideology of the Atharraveda magic presented in a specula tive garb In the view of early Vedic thinkers, philosophy was as closely connected with a practical purpose as magic Their basic dictum was that the knowledge of the end to be achieved was the surest means of achieving that end the polarity of the contents of the Athanaveda is thus more apparent than real 
Vedic Ritualism 
Towards the end of the Samliitā-period, the Vedic Aryans had, by and large, become politically stable, economically secure, and socially organized The transition from toilsome, adventurous, nomadic life to a life of household comfort and leisure did not fail to influence their relgion - more particularly their religious practices Out of the simple prayers, fire-worship, and Soma cult, and primitive magic of the earlier period, there was now evolved a highly complex and complicated system of ritual which soon assumed the status of the only recognised form of religion Elaborate rules were prescribed and rigidly enforced in connection with the various details of the ritual, such as the proper time and place for sacrifice, the sacred fires, the officiating priests, the sacrificial materials and implements, the divinities, the oblations, the mantras, the dah sınā, and the reparation or expiation rites for the errors of commission and omission in the sacrificial proce dure The natural consequence of all this was that the initiative and operative capability in religious matters bow passed, for all practical purposes, into the hands of the newly arisen class of professional priests who claimed a certain amount of expertise in ritual practice and could therefore authoritatively guide the people in their sacrificial performances The need must also have been Celt for literary mabuals wluch described and discussed the many details of the theory and practice of this intricately worked put sacrificial system It was, verily, out of this need that the

Brahm3udya 
In actual practice, however, the exaggerated glorification of Brahmanic ritual stirred up intellectual and social simmerings against the religion of sacrifice in the Brāhmana-period, sacri fice was exalted so extravagantly that it had come to be regarded not merely as means to an end but as an end in itself Not only had sacrifice become the very pivot on which the entire communal life of the Vedic people revolved, but it had also been elevated to the position of the basic motive force of all cosmic phenomena It was then but natural that the priests, who held the key to the theory and practice of sacrifice in their hands should have exerted upon the entire community an intellectual and social influence which almost amounted to domination But such a state of things could obviously not endure for long There arose a band of free thinkers who resented the attitude of blind acceptance, which the priests had more or less deliberately fostered among the people, and therefore sought to replace it with the attitude of uninhibited inquiry Many of these free thinkers came from social strata other than those to which the Brahmanıc priests bad belonged They began by challeaging the two basic claims implied in the Brähniana texts, namely, that the Veda possessed absolute validity and that the purpose of the Veda was exclusively ritualistic They asserted that the Veda embodied only a lower kind of knowledge (aparā vidya), and that the Brahmanıc sacri. fice which placed joordinatcly greater emphasis on the form of religion than on its spirit' represented an inferior kiad of religion (avora i karma) Sacrifice, they insisted, was an unsteady boat' on which one could .11 aTord to rely for success

Lo the contest of the religious history of India, however, what could be considered to be the strong points of the Upan sadec speculations from one point of view proved to be their weak points from apotber point of view The exalted spintualisma (brahmar idja) of the Uporisads, for instance seat oier the heads of the connon people The adequate comprehension of the monistic-idealistic teachings of the Upaniseds and more parts. cularly the mystic realization of the ultimate reality on which they lay a special emphasis pecessarily call.d for a high intellectual capacity and an austere spiritual disciplie: And these an ordi nary person could obs iously not te expected to command 12 sufficient ceasure Further the fact that the Upanisads had not set forth any one consistent philosophical docinae 435 respon sible for their failure to produce a uniform and concentrated and, therefore, more or less abiding-effect on the miods of the people in this very content may be mentioned the essentially individualistic character of the Upanisadıc teachings The Upa 015adıc thinkers do not seem to have made any effort to build up a kind of spiritual brotherhood among the mass Indeed, no one among the great Uporadic teachers ever sought to be the Spiritual leader of the people at large The Upanissads may be said to have igpored more or less completely the practical side of the spiritual urge of the people They gave to the people a philosophy, or philosophies, which most of them were not com.

The religious interregoum occasioned by the interruption in the cortinuity of the Vedic tradition offered a propitious oppor tunity for the consolidation of the heterodox or non-Vedic beliefs and practices such as nere, for instance, represented by Jainism and Buddhism The beginnings of many of these beliefs and practices may actually be traced back to a common pre-Vedic non-Aryan culture complex Jainism and Buddhism took advantage of the simosphere of free thinking and the attitude of inquiry even with reference to the Veda, which had been promoted by the Upon sads, and assimilating their strong points but avoiding the weak ones steadily extended the spheres of their influence on the other hand, boucyer, Vedism, which had taken deep roots among the people in the course of its fairly long history, had not lost its Vitality altogether The rear guards of that great religious move ment again mustered themselves and made a strong bid to coun teract the advance of the non-Vedic religious forces by consolidat iog reorgapzing and thereby revitalizing the Vedic way of life and thought The various branches of Vedic knowledge, such as phonetics, etymology, grammar, metrics and astronomy, Here systematized in the form of Vedānga texts, and - what is far more important from the point of view of the history of religion - the Socio religious life of the community was sought to be regulated through the Aalpasūtras —- *ts ritual aspect through the Srauta sutras, individual and domestic aspect through the Grhy asutras, and socio poliucal aspect through the Dharmasútras However, tbus fluivalisuc movement, which does not seem to have become a popular movement in any sense, could not by itself, succeed in its mission.

emerged as quite the forces to reckon with But the decline of Vedism afforded them an opportunity to assert themselves it would, indeed, seem that the rear guards of Vedism had them selves boosted up these religions to a certain extent For, they must have soon realised that the challenge of the beterodox movements could not be effectuely met by mere revivalist efforts A common popular front needed to be built up against them Consequently, most of the popular tribal religions, with the variety of their gods and religious practices, came to be loosely organized into one single but multi-charactered whole, which was held together by means of the thin thread of their allegiance to the Veda This is, in broad outline, the story of the genesis of historical Hinduism It may be noted that Hinduism steered clear, on the one band, of the extreme orthodoxy of the Sūtra-Vedānga revivalists, and, on the other, of the extreme heterodoxy of the religious movements like Jainism and Buddhism While arresting the growth of the anti-Vedic ideology, it successfully combated the insularity and exclusiveness of Vedism by bringing together under its banner large masses of people and, at the same time, saved the Vedic tradition from becoming altogether extinct 
The main characteristics of this religious movement may be stated as follows The principal gods of hieratic Vedista like Indra and Varuna came to be superseded by the popular gods fike Siva and Visnu-Krspa The Purāna legends, such as that Krsna did not recognise the Indra-festival, that he protected the cow herds and their cattle against Indra's fury by lifting up the Govardhana mountain, and that he plupdered Indra's garden and snatched away the päryjäta tree, are suggestive of such change of religious loyalties "The Upanisads, which are traditionally believed to have represented the culmination, as it were, of the Vedic way of life and thought (they are significantly called Vedānta) had already replaced the gods of the Samhita by the suprapersonal Absolute or the impersonal Brahman Hinduism again energetically revived the religion of personal gods - and this it did with a strong monotheistic bias The god now came to be looked upon essentrally as friend and saviour The elaborate

that as an essential constituent of society, he furthers the process of lolasamgraha through an active awareness of his social obliga. gations The Bhagavadgita has thus invested its teaching with positive social values The sadharma or the special socio ethical obligations of different types of men are, according to the Bhaga radgitā, best embodied in the doctrine of căturiarnja or the scheme of four social orders Honcver, it needs to be noted that, unlike the avoredly brahmadic texts, the Bhagavadgitā never refers to the superiority of one social order to another It consistently emphasizes only the socio ethical significance of that scheme It would, indeed, seem that the maio insistence of the Bhagavadgitū was on man's active recognition of his sradharma or social obligations, the cāfuriornja having been referred to - almost by way of an example - as a scheme, wluch, in the context of the contemporary conditions, best ensured the recognition by men of their respective svadharmas 
The promotion of lokasamgral a, through the fulfilment of one's svadharma, necessarily implies an activistic way of life The Bhagaads ia has accordingly discussed, at some length, the why and the how of this harmaioga Verily, that is the main theme of the poem It seeks to reconcile its ideal of lokasan gralia with the Upanisadıc ideal of mol s1 through its teachings of anāsahin) oga, that is renunciation in action and not of action The larmajoga of the Bhagavaagita is not to be confused with the karmalanda of the ritualistic texts Krsna fully realised that the elaborate and highly complex system of sacrifice could never become the religion of the people He, therefore, sponsored a way of spiritual life in which everybody - irrespective of caste, creed and ser - could participate It was the way of bhalni or devotion Some faint traces of the doctrine of braki which involves such items as the realısation by the devotee of the almost insuperable distance between the supreine majesty of God and his own lowly station, the consciousness on his part of lus own guilt, his complete self surrender before God, his carnest looging for a close personal communion with God, and the mystic ctperiences which he enjoys in the companionship of God, can be discovered

even in certain hymns of the Rgseda, particularly those addressed to Varuna by Vaisistha (VII 86-88), 10 but it is only in historial Hinduism that devotion to a personal god has been represented as one of the most essential features of religion in his teaching of bhakti, however Krsna has stressed one very sign fcant point, He has insisted that a true harmojogin that is to say, one who adopts the activism as taught in the Bhagavadgitā as his creed, can alone become a true bhahta, for by pursuing his sadharma, the karrrajogin actually subserves the will of god and participates in the divine project Arong other features of the teacting of the Bhagu adgira may be mentioned the erbical idealization of Sacrifice and the promulgation of a portile religio-philosophical synthesis 11 
If the Bhagavadgita was, in a sense, the basic text of Hindu religion and ethics the Smrfis must be said to bave been the basic texts governing a Hindu s persona) domestic, and social beha viour Though the term Smrti was sometimes used to denote almost the entire religious literature of early classical Hinduism ja contradistinction to the term Sruti which denoted the religious literature of Vedism (or Brahmapiso) that term decoted, more specially, the versified texts op Dharmasastra Easily the best konn work of this type is the Vaz ismrti, which may be presu med to have belonged to the period wheo the Vahābhārala vas undergoing its figal redaction The Janusmrti begios with a statemept on cosmology, and then proceeds to lay down, in the Dext few chapters which may be said to constitute the very kernel of the work, the rules of conduct of persons belonging to the different social orders (varnadharma ) and the different stages of life (ośramadharma) Indeed to course of time, the rar näsrama dharma as formulated in the Vandsmrti came to be almost identi fied with Hinduim as a whole The Manusmri then goes on to discuss matters relating to polity (raja lharma), whereby 10 connection with the admiäistration of justice, it deals at some

length with the eighteen titles of law It ends with the mention of some expiatory rites (prajalcuttas) and a desultory discussion of a few topics of a metaplıysical character 
It was also during this period of the definition and consolida tion of Hinduism as a socio religious system that typical concepts such as those of proirt and maurii, the three mas, the four purusārthas, and more particularly of Karma and samsāra, which last incidentally may be regarded as perhaps the only dogmas (if at all anv) of Hinduism, came to be specially emphasised It may be pointed out in this context that, though, in ancient and medieval India, religion and philosophy were not always sharply demarcated, the various systems of Hindu philosophy seem to have developed almost independently of religion to the course of the first few centuries before Christ, what may be called the Hindu philosophical thought seems to have been, for the first time, crystallized in the form of regular orthodox philosophical systems 
While the rise of the dynasty of the Sungas in Magadha, in the second century BC, gave great impetus to the movement of the resurgence of Hinduism, its fall may be said to have marked the beginning of a period of a kind of uncertainty in the fortunes of Hinduism Various circumstances may be said to have been responsible for bringing about this state of things For one thing there was at that time no single paramount politi cal power which could have promoted the advancement of Hinduism It was a period of great social upheaval and unsettled political conditions Adequate impetus could not, therefore, be given to the morentous upsurge of Hinduism which had started in the post-Maurya era, though some efforts in that direction are known to have been made by the hanvas, the Andhras, the Bhārasivas, and the early Vākátakas The religious affiliations of the foreign tribes like the Bactrian Gruehs the Sakas the Pahla vas and the husūnas, who made inroads in India during this period and eventually settled down in this country, were divided between Buddhism ard Hinduism Most of these forcign tribes had sojourned in Serindia before they came over to India and had,

accordingly, already come under the influence of Buddhism, wbich bad spread far and wide in that region in course of time, however, many of them seem to have been converted to one or the other sect of Hinduism Another significant factor which must baie seriously affected the growth of Hinduism was the rise, during this penod, of a strong tuyal to that religion in the form of Mahāyāna Buddhism When, however, in the early fourth century AD, the Guptas came to power, Hinduisth attained a truly 
classical efiorescence 12 
Classical Hondas 
One of the foremost religio-literary activities of the age of the Guptas was the final redaction of the Puranas The beliefs and practices of the Hinduism of the age of the Guptas are accor dingly best represented in these scriptures of the common man" The Puranas reflect not only the culmination of the process of the classicalization of Hinduism but also the begionings of the prols feration of Hinduism A clear indication of this latter tendency is to be found 10 the rise of the various sects which were esser tially monotheistic in character Indeed, hereafter, one can speak of the history of Hinduism only in the sense of the history of the Hudu sects, foc, apart from these sects, Hinduism as such hardly had any independent entity in this context, it shopld be remem bered that sects can anse easily only 10 such religions as bare no clearly defined dogmas Otherwise, there is the risk of the sects becomiog heres es

the idea of avatāras Just as Vaisnavism developed round the figure of Visnu, who cannot be said to have belonged to the hieratıc Vedic pantheon,14 Saivism developed round the pre-Vedic non-Aryan god Sıva 18 It is, indeed, remarkable that an austere and ascetic god like Sıva should have been made the object of an emotional and emancipatory love It would seem that the Svetāśvatara-Upanisad, which had sought to elevate the personal god over and above the impersonal brahman, had played the same role in respect of early Saiva theism as the Bhagavadgitā had done in respect of the early Bhagavata theism History shows that, by and large, these two major Sects of Hinduism lived and grew side by side without generating any feeling of mutual ill-will Apart from Vaisnavism and Saivism, the emergence, during the period of classical Hinduism, of several other minor sects is also evinden ced in history and Jiterature 
Another very significant aspect of the development of Hindu sects is to be seen in the Tantras Tantra is a genetic term denoting the literature of certain religious cults, whose beginnings have to be traced back perhaps even to the pre-Vedic times but which were systematised and began to become prominent within Hinduism (and, for that matter, also within Buddhism) from 
about the Sth century AD This literature cannot be said to have necessarily arisen to oppose the Vedas which claimed some kind of formal authority in respect of Hinduism It was only averred that the Vedas had been all right for the earlier ages, but that their teachings and practices had lost their appeal in the Kaliyuga The Tantras, therefore, took the place of the Vedas as the autho ritative religious literature of this new age Tantrism also opened its doors to all social orders and women Paradoxically, however, while the Tantras, on the one hand sought to democratise Hinduism by removing the barriers of sex and caste in religious matters, on the other hand, they laid down such strict rules for the initiation of the südhakas into their secret practices that they thereby tended to become an exclusive esoteric cult The dogma

tics and ethics of the Tanfras were more or less similar to those of Brahmanic Hipdom, but their distinctive feature was their mystic-magical practices which compnsed such items as mantra 
( magically potent formula), bija ( mystical letter forming the essential part of a mantra), Jantra (magic-mystic diagrams), rrāsa (placing of the hands on different parts of the body), mudra ( gesture a buch sought to presente the form of the montra intact), etc The Tantras also dealt with the various details of pājā and orgiastic rites as also of temple-architecture and icono graphy Many of the late sectari20 L parisads are of the nature of Tantras, rhile the infoence of the Tantras op some of the Purāras is quite unmistakable 
Unlike the Vedas, the Tartres, whose number is fairly large, are emphatically sectarian in character They relate mainly to the three sects -Sana, Vaisdava, ard Sakta - and the Tantric texts beloogog to these three sects are respectively called Azarras, Samhlás, and Tantras It is generalk belicted that the Agomis onginated m Kashmir, the Tartras in Bengal and Eastern India and the Sanhitas in various parts of this country, particularly Bengal and South India. 
The age of the Guptas thus stoessed a solid, opalent, and many-sided expansion of Hindasm A brief reference may be made here to some of the characteristic features of thus grand coltural movement Firstly, it becomes clear from the study of epigraphic and literary records of the Gupta period that classical Hinduism had gecerally developed a remarkable spint of tolerance 176--175 other religions as also among its ranous sects." Secondly, this cow, vigorous Hinduism is seen to have given a great fillip to Sanskrit language and literature It may be noted, 10 this connection, that classical Sanskrit was twidely - and perhaps deliberately - used even for popular and secular purposes and that even the Jainas and the Buddhists thought it necessary to write their religio-pbilosophical works in Sanskrit. Thirdly, thanks to the activities of the peripateuc monstrels, who visited the distant

parts of the country under the pretext of the various pilgrimages recommended by the popular scriptures and thus carried the message of Hipduism directly to the masses by means of the Purana recitatioos, Hinduism proved in that period a significant force jo unifying the heterogeneous elements of the population 10 a common bond of religion And, finally, Hinduism had then assumed a positive missionary role The movement of the spread of Hioduism in foreign lands had already begun in the earlier period and there is ample evidence of its expansion over the whole of South-East Asid, from Burma to Java and Balt, from at least the second century onwards, though many indications in this connection have been partially obscured by Buddhism which had preceded and tben again followed Hinduism This activity as well as that of the Hinduisation of foreign tribes which came to India continued with equal zeal even in the classical period of the history of Hindựism Proliferation of Hinduism 
The next millennium, that is roughly from 700 A D to 1700 AD, was characterized by the vigorously continued proliferation of Hinduism in various directions Hinduism came to be further fragmented into more sects and sub-sects This resulted in the creation of a kind of dichotomy between the smärta Hinduism and the sectaman Hinduism It must, however, be remembered that, howsoever radical a sect might have been, it made it a point not to abjure the parent creed, though some of the sects had obviously arisen under the inspiration of non-Hindu religious ideologies The emergence of these sects usually followed a certain set pattern Some religious leader started a movement with a view either to reforming the existiog vulgarised religious practices or to widening the appeal of Hinduism by claiming equal religious privileges for all castes and classes It may however, be incidentally added that most of the movements started for the purpose of the democratization or popularization of religion eventually tended to become exclusive and esoteric The newly ariseh sects and sub sects centred round specific divini tics, and adopted as their gospels the sayings and sermons of their

promoters (or of the immediate disciples of those promoters ), wbich were sually delivered not in Sansknt but in the languags of the people and which were presen ed either 10 oral or written form. They were also, not onoften, barked out from one another on account of their distinctive apparel or emblems Thus, thoogh Hirderm as suck did not smear by any Prophet or any Book ar any Chorch, the sects of Hinduism may, in a sense, be sad to have done so 
A notable feature of these sects was that they had artsen not so much to sponsor any specific philosophical tenets as to esta blish and popularize particular types of theism and ways of bhaktı lodeed, it has been aghtly pointed out that, from the 9th-10th centuries onwards, all that is most vital in Hinduism has mani fested itself in the forta of bhakrı Thus renaissance of bhaktı is known to have received its main impulse from South India Lo South India, there were the Nainārs, who, in the first half of the Dinth century, developed a bod of sensuous mysticist for Siva, and the Alvärs, who a few years later, expressed in their Tamil songs a deeply emotional and intensely personal devotion for Visao 
But the Vascasa bhaltı-cult underwent a truly exuberant ramification in Northern and Central Ladia from the 13th to the 17th century Two main curteots of devotional porshup could be distinguished in this connection - one relating to Rama and the other to Krona Io the case of the latter, again, there were to be seen two distinct lines of development - one centering round Kosa3 apd bus spouse (as generally sponsored by the saints of Maharashtra ) and the other round Krsna and his beloved Radha (as popolarized, among others, by Timbārla, Caitany, and Jayadeva) So far as Sarvism is concerned, a referece may be made to the Tnka or the Tantric-metapbysical aspect of Sauvism which had become established in Kashimar round about the ninth century AD, the elaboration and systematization of the Sana Siddhanta in South Iodia, and the rise of the Yanows Saira sects like the Kāpāuka, the Kálmukha, the Virasaiva, and the Lingayata 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
Besides this proliferation of sects and cults there was also 10 evidence a fairly active proliferation in respect of the orthodox philosophical systems 
A survey of the history of Hinduism during this long period would bring out two promisent facts Firstly, the influence on Hinduism of non-Hindu religious ideologies has been quite super ficial and therefore almost negligible And, secondly, for its length this bistory must be said to have been marred but seldom by religious persecution either by or of or within Hinduism The missionary activities of Buddhism and Jaroism were generally pacific, and with the Hindu theistic-philosophical renaissance in South India they had become more or less subdued Islam was more aggressive - on the negative side it sought to exterminate Hinduism and on the positive side it aimed at the conversion of the Hindu population The encounter between Islam and Hindu ism, on the one hand, evoked a religio political solidarity such as was evidenced in the Maratha and the Sikh reaction, and, on the other hand, it inspired efforts to bring about a spiritual rapproche ment between the two faiths 
Confrontation of Tradition and Modernity 
The eighteenth century was a period of staguation for Hinduism Not much activity was evident either in respect of doctrine or of literature But, roughly with the advent of the British rule in India, traditional Hinduism had to face quite a Dew problem - the problem arising from its confrontation with modern culture (In the early stages of the evolution of that culture) 19 The educated classes among the Hindus reacted to thts phenomenon, which was fraught with serious and far reach ing consequences, in three typical ways "The remarkable achieve ments of science and technology in the West and the new philo sophies of life to which they gave rise made a tremendous impact on one section of the Hindu intelligentsia They critically studied the situation in Ipdia and concluded from this self examination

that the root-cause of the material and the spiritual poverty of India - yes, even the spiritual poverty, for, the much-flaunted Hindo spirituality was, according to them, to be fourd peither 10 books nor in practice - was the kind of religion which she tradi tionally professed Thes, therefore, felt that this root-cause Deeded to be removed, that is to say, religion had to be rejected Such rejection of religion tool tro forms Firstly it meant the rejection of traditiocal Hinduism in favour of a religion which was considered to be more amenable to modern deselopments, particularly of Christianity The other variety of rejection was far more radical. It cannot, of course, be said to have been restricted only to lodia Indeed, it was a common intellectual attitude which had been engendered by the multiple material forces w post parts of the civilized world This ranety of rejection insisted on religion as such being entirely basished from human affairs But the rexectionists of neither of these two varieties could command any extensive support in fodia. 
The second kind of react100 was represented by the equally strongly expressed tendency towards the presenation - either wholesale or selectise-of the beliefs and practices of Hinduism, It was claimed that traditional Hinduism could not and must not be banished, for, it bad efficaciously sened acd would continue to sente as the perennial source of inspiration and the one beacon light for the Hindu millions The traditional Hindu spintuality, it was insisted, nas the only rampart which could successfully with stand the cursed onslaught of the degrading Western materialism Three principal manifestations of this tendency became parti. culary evident (1) the obscurantism of the Varnāsramadharma Samgha and the Ramarājja-Pansad, (2) the Hindu nationa LISTA of the Hindo Mabāsabhi and the Rastriya-Svayamsevaka Samgha, and (3) the fundamentalism of the Aryasamāja 
The third kind of reaction resulting from the confrontation of traditional Hinduism with modern culture was reflected in the attempts to restate Hinduism in the light of the newly arisen complex situation in India and the world This tendency may be said to be the ruling tendency of the present times It has its 
40 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
origin in the firm conviction that Hinduism possesses the inoate character of what may be called the eternal religion, sanätana dharma, and that it can adequately satisfy the religious urge of any age The past history of Hinduism, It is averred, encourages one to believe that it will be found "equal to any emergency that the future may throw up whether on the field of thought or of history » All that needs to be done is to reinterpret Hinduism to suit the changing conditions - and this, it is believed, can be done without any serious violence to the basic character of Hinduism -- or to isolate and emphasize such characteristics of Hinduism as are universal and perennial in their appeal and thereby relate 1t8 teachings suitably to modem developments This tendency towards restatement, reinterpretation, or revision of Hipduism has manifested itself in various ways, but a mention may be made here only of two of these manifestations, pamely, (1) the Brahma Samāja and similar religio-social movements and (2) the Ramakrishna Mission 
It is however, a third kind of manifestation of the tendency of restatement and reinterpretation of Hinduism which seems to appeal tost to the Hindu intellectuals today Surprisingly cnough, this kind of manifestation has not taken the form of any organized religious movement like the Brāhma Samija or the Ramakrishna Mission It is largely the result of the endeavours - which are mostly academic in character - of individual thinkers, who, having become " conscious of many of the imper fections and disabilities of the historical faith, seek to find within it by some kind of rationalization, a faith adequate to meet the demands of Indian life to the present age " Their re-evaluation of Hinduism 15 rational, critical, and essentially philosophically Oriented Their attitude is one of constructive criticism tempercd by trust Traditional Hinduism, they are convinced, is by no means free from mistaken concepts excesses, and abuses, but these are but excrescences to be gotten rid of Underneath these are solid, universal principles to be held to without hesita tion The slogan of this school of thought scems to be Change 10 religion is inevitable, but tradition must grow

The roodem age has thrown out a serious challenge to all traditional religions, However, in the course of the long period of its esolution, Hidduism may be said to have acquired adequate strength to meet any new challenge and to respond to the demands of any dew set of conditions more or less successfully and with out allowing its essential character to be vitiated in any way History bears abordant testimocy to this kind of strength of Hodoism But there are also other tal d reasons which seem to 
confirm the belief that Hinduisa would be able to adjust itself with modern culture without much contiict 
In this connection, it Deeds to be, first of all, noted that many of the clums of moderoism, which seem to imply the futiuty of religion in modern times, have been proved to be inherently ustenable For sastance modern intellectualism, sbuch discounts cances faith because it is said to breed fanaticism has completely failed to realise the true nature of faith and the significance of the role which faith plays in the life of an It must be emphast sed that, particularly 10 the realm of morality, reason 15 uncom plete aod arrested in growth of not allowed to blossom into faith. It may be further pointed out that motion, which is so much aalted in the Hindu tradition but which is generally anathemati zed by modern rigorous rationalism, is not a-logical, but that it is

supra logical Faith and intuition have proved to be veritable sources of strength to man It seems as if, while combating one kind of fanaticism, modern intellectualism has fomented another kind of fanaticism, pamely, the fanaticism regarding the invulnera bility of reason 
Modern science claims to have established that reality is ordered, that man's reason is capable of discerning this order as it mainfests itself in the laws of nature, and that the path to human fulfilment consists primarily in discovering these laws, utilizing them where this is possible, and complying with them where it is not It is further claimed that the ever-increasing fund of scientific knowledge has delimited - and, in some cases, entirely negatived - the scope and the purpose of religion Science has, for instance, unravelled the mystery of the origin of the world and of the man, and has thereby rendered religious cosmology and anthropology quite nugatory These and similar claims of modern science have, however, now been proved to be wholly unwarranted by what has been called “post-modern" science Scientists now confess that the structure of nature has eluded them They are, indeed, confronted with something which is truly ineffable 
It may also be added that several features of modern culture have been found to be not very desirable - jodeed they have been instrumental in stirring up serious crises in the life of man It is true that modern technology has brought about a clearly noti ceable rise in the standard of the material and physical life of man This, in its turo, has given rise to the changed concept of human needs, and to the belief that religion is, by its very nature, not competent to satisfy these needs This may seem indis putable But are not many of the other consequences of modern technology distinctly undesirable? It is seen that technology has tended to promote a social organization which is essentially impersonal in character Technology has also led to the concen tration of authority, power, and wealth-and, what is worse, by its very nature, it does not possess the capacity to lay down the norms in the matter of the use of that authority, power, and

wealth Again, the rush of the machine-age has disturbed the equilibrium in human lfe, it has created a kind of imbalance. Sundarly man cd go looser hope to enjoy the personal solitude which is so sery essential for his spiritual health. It has also to be emphasised that the persisting conditions of war have revealed technology in a graie and dangerous perspective. Of course, science and technology by themselves are not to be condensed. Lodeod, med cappot not do without them. All that is intended to be suggested is that the employcent of science and techoology needs to be governed by a proper sease of values 
As regards the emphasis laid by modern culture on the freedom of the individual, it may be borde in mind that a wholly free zodiyidcal us as much a myth as a stoly rational individual. Even the caterialistic vien wuch is one of the tcost dominant viens of the present age, looks upon man as "a passive creatore moulded and pushed from behind by mechanical forces, a slave of physical energy he can noter control" The tso ideals of modern culture, namely, individual freedom ard socialista, bare remaiced incompatible Indeed, the socialization of the radik daal 15 threatening to develop into a mojor CRISIS of the modern tines 
The antenability of certain claims of modern culture and the undesirability of several of its features may be said to have actually created ja Lsdi2 - as, perhaps, in many other countries - a propitions atmosphere for a fresh rethinking about the need for religion. Such rethinking in respect of Hinduism is, indeed, now seen to be engaging the attention of Hırda intellectuals 
Secondly, certain charactenstics of Hinduism, arising from the sery nature of its cngin and growth, reoder it apable of adequately meeting the challenge of any pest set of circumstances. Hinduism, it may be reiterated, has generally retained free from any kind of institutional rigidity This is surely the secret of its remarkable responsiveness to the changırg condiuops of life and thought. This is also shy Hinduism has contigued to be a “gTowing" religion There is, accordingly, no possibility of any serious conflict arising from the confrontation of Hinduism with

modernity Indeed, one need not be surprised if, in course of time, modernity itself becomes an organic part of the Hindu tradition Tolerance, which is rightly mentioned as one of the most outstandiog characteristics of Hinduism is another factor which has operated as an effecture deterrent of Insular and exclusi vist tendencies in the matter of belief and practice in the matter of religion, Hindu tolerance implies a kind of sublimation of religious feelings - a recognition that religion is polymorphic 
A third reason why Hinduism will be able adequately to meet the challenge of modern culture is that Hinduism either already possessed (albeit in a rudimentary form) several of the elements of modernity or it has steadily assimilated them in the course of its evolution Rationalism as such, for instance, is by no means aet to the Hindu tradition. It is well koond that Hindu thought an boast of a fairly well-developed epistemolog Indeed, Nyāya (Hindu system of logic and epistemology ) has played a signifi. cant role in the deselopment of almost every branch of Hindu knowledge. The spirit of inquiry has always been a rulog passion with Hindu thinkers They are seen to have devoted themselves to a fearless and uninhibited pursuit of truth regardless of where it led A Carvila or a Kautilya 25 not unknown to Hindu intellectual histon At the same time it is verily a strong point of Hindu thinlers that they have duly recognised the limitations of human intellect But they refuse to stop at the inevitable intellectual indeterminism Sraddhā or faith, which they have glorified, is actually an indication of their epistemological opti mism 
Like modern scientists the Hindus also tested their enou. ledge, limited in scope and variety though it might have beco, pragmatically, that is, by the quality of personal cuperence which 10 made possible For instance, immediate cuperience of reality, and pot merely its mediate knowledge, is the goal towards which all the religio-philosophical activities of the Hindus have been directed 
It may be further pointed out that, for a Hindu tbinker, the "attitudinal" aspect of 3 plulosophy has been more important

than the “cognitional ” aspect What really matters is not what onc "knows" but what one "becomes" All this makes Hipduism an essentially mystic-personal religion It Deed not, therefore, come into any serious conflxct with modern culture As claimed by the modernists, the theologic aspect of religion may have lost its raison d'etre after the rise of modern science and secular ethics, but its mystic-personal aspect, 35 even the protagonists of moder dity are now generally incliced to admit, will ever remai coeval with maa. 
Today, India, like the rest of the civilized world, is witness 10g a major conflict of values In India, as elsewhere there is a distinct shift of interest loterest 10 policies and economics is becoming more and more predominant and the teodency is becoming evident to subordirate all oiber salues to this single salge (TOYS BEE regards this state of things 25 markjog the decay of cullization ) 1o the matter of religion, the Hindu intellectuals bave now generally become listless They are merely dnfting It is clear that the kind of equilibrium which traditionat Hinduism had established has hon been senopsly disturbed by modernisation But it is equally clear that for the sake of social solidanty, a pety kind of equilibrum must be substituted and that Hinduismo, as indicated above, does possess the apacity to mect this challengiog situation in quite an adequate manner Map is essentially a religious creature Constituted as be is, he cannot live without some kind of religion, religion is for hio a psycholo gical and a sociological necessity This being so, irreligion or rejection of religion > positively unnatural The secularism, which is nos accepted by the Indus people as an article of faith, does not imply irreligion or apt-trapscendentalism or non-spin tualty Indian secularism is a positive negative concept. On the one hand, it implies positie good will and respect for all reli grons, and, on the other, it insists that institutionalized religion shall not under any circumstances, be employed to jofluence adversely the music life of the people and the normal functioping of the State ln a country like India which is characterized by religious pluralism, this doctrine of secularism is fully justified

In the India of today, communities professing different religious faiths and practices have not only to live together in harmony, but they have also to work together in a spirit of active and responsive collaboration Under these circumstances, secularism, properly understood, can alone operate as a positive force in the proper development of the country Secularism, which seeks to subordinate the theologic, creedal, institutional, ritualistic aspect of religion to its mystic, personal, spiritual aspect, does not contemplate an outright reversal of the spiritual tradition of the country It rather promotes a healthy evolution of that tradition so that it may suitably respond to the changing conditions His tory would show that Hinduism could not have anything intrinsi cally against such secularism 19
