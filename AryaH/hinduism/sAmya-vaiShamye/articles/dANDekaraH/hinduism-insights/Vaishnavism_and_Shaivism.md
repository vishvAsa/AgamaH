Ramakrishna Gopal BHANDARKAR'S (RGB'S) VAISLITISTE Šarrism and Moor Religious Systems (VŠURS), which was IA claded in the “Grundriss der indoanischen Philologis" and which was first published in 1913, represents a significant landmark i the study of the religious history of Ladia No doubt, since early times, single chapters on Indian religions, particularly Vedic religion, have been included to the histories of religions in general, such as those by E VEROV (Hutotre raturelle des religions, 1885), C. YON ORELLI (Allgemene Religionsgeschichte, 1899), S REINACH (Orpheus Histoire gerérale des religions, 1907), and A S BISHOP (The world's altar stars Introductory studies in The religions of the world, 1910) But these chapters are inevi tably more or less superficial in character It was Fasdrich MAX MULLER, who in his pioneering works like Lectures on the Onzu and Growth of Religion as illustrated by the Religions of Indu (1878), Natural Religion (1888), Physical Religion (1891), Anthropological Religion (1892), and Theosophy or Psychological Religion (1892). for the first time, occupied himself with the subject of Indian Relgions to a big way His aroned aim, however, was to develop a science of comparative religion and comparatne mythology Naturally, therefore, bis treatwent was restricted to the 'Aryan' or the Vedic religion. Moreover, his approach cannot be said to have been that of a historian of religion, he was primarily interested in the content of religion. The same was the case with Forks like L YOX SCHROEDER'S Arusche Religion (1914–16) 
The scope of H H WILSOV's Essats and Lectures on the Religion of the Hindus (1861-62) was certamly wider, but still they did not constitute a regnar history of the region of the Hmdos Besides, these Essays were patently worted by the perversity of the author's approach to the subject. He is said to

have publicly expressed the view (at the University of Oxford in 1840) that one needed to study the Hindu religion in order to be able to prove its erroneousness and to persuade Hindu intelli gentsia to adopt the Christian faith Nevertheless, WILSON'S English translation of the Vişnu-Purāna was a laudable attempt to make the authentic sacred writings of the Hindus easily accessible to the Western public The first proper history of the religions of India - a work which deals with both history and doctripes - must be said to be Les religions de l'Inde (1879) by A BARTH An authorised English translation of this book by J WOOD was published jo 1882 The French scholar no doubt felt that Hinduism showed visible signs of decadence, but he was not inclined to believe that it would ever surrender to Christianity Monier WILLIAMS ( Religious Thought and Life in India, 1883) too took strong exception to Hindu religious leaders being charac. terised as * benighted heathens' BARTH's work was followed by The Religions of India (1895) by EW HOPKINS (who sought to study these religions with a view to understanding the manner 11 which religions and theistic ideas arose and developed among a people and the light which they shed on the origin and develop ment of similar ideas elsewhere), Indische Religionsgeschichte (1898) by E HARDY, and Ancient India, its Language and Reli gions ( 1898 ) by H OLDENBERG 
It was but to be expected that in such works as those mentio ned above the treatment of the two major sects of Hinduism, namely, Vaisnavism and Salvism, as also of the minor religious systems in Hinduism, would be sketchy and inadequate RGB, for the first time, undertook to trace the history of these sects and systems in a comprehensive manner on the basis of all available literary, epigraphical, sculptural, and numismatic evidence In keeping with the views regarding research methodology which he consistently advocated, his approach to and treatment of the subject were eminently objective, critical, and comparative Apart from the general Works on Indian religions mentioned above,

Vaisnavism i! RGB's survey of Vaisnavism from about the fifth century before Christ to the middle of the seventeenth century after Christ may be broadly divided into three main parts to the first part he explains how that religious sect originated and how it passed through various stages of development before it fipally came to be consolidated in the form of what may be called classical Vaisna vism While this first part is historical in character, the emphasis in the second part is more on the doctrine In the eighth century A D, Samkarācārya vigorously promulgated the doctrine of spiritual monism and world-illusion'-a doctrine which was const dered to be highly detrimental to the basic tenets of Vaisnavism It had to be confronted and refuted on a logical-metapbysical level and the religion of Bhakti had to be rehabilitated on sound rational basis This is exactly what Rāmānuja (11th century) strenuously endeavoured to do the same mission was carried forward, in their own distinctive ways, by Nimbārka (12th century), Madhya ( 13th century), and Vallabha (15th century) 
The second part of RGB's survey deals with the thought and work of these Ācāryas An active sympathy for the lower classes and the use of vernaculars for the propagation of Bhaktı with special stress on its emotional side had become evident in the history of Vaişnavism ever since the days of Rāmānuja The compositions of the Alvars of the south would confirm this But these traits became more marked with Rāmānanda (born 1300 AD) They continued to be the hallmark of the teachings and activities of the later Vaisnava saints like Kabir ( 1398-1518) and Tulasidasa ( 1532-1623 ) in the north, Caitanya (1485-1533 ) in the east, and Nāmadeva (born 1270 ?) and Tukārīma (1607-1649) in the Deccan The discussion of these teachings and activities may be said to constitute the third part of RGB's survey of Varsnavism Out of these three parts it is the first which is particularly impor tant from the historical point of view, the other two parts being more or less of the nature of factual statement The first part is also more controversial aod calls for a critical re-appraisal, in the light of the fresh evidence that has become available, of som of the Joints made in it.

About the origia aad growth of Vaisnavison, RGB has to say this "It (Vasnavism) first appeared as a religious reform, like Buddhism and Jalism, but based on theistic principles Its early Dame sras Ekantika Dharma, or the religion of a single-minded love and devotion to One In its background stood the Bhagavad gitá, a discourse professing to be preached by Vasudeva-Krsna. It soon assunod a sectarian form and w3s called the Pazcarátra or Bhagavata religion It was professed by a tribe of Ksatryas of the name of Sätrata and was noticed by Megasthedes, about the end of the fourth century before Christ, as the religion of such a specific people. Tais faith magled itself with the existing onc in Nārāyana and wib that in Visau in the Bhagavadgith itself Here embodied some of the teachings of the Upanisads Soon after the bridging of the Christian era another element was contributed to this system of religion by the Abhiras, or conherds, who belonged to a foreign tribe, in the shape of the marvellous deeds of the boy-Krsta, who came to be regarded as a god, and of his amorous dalliances with con herdesses So constituted, Vaisoavis kept on till about the end of the eighth cenivry "11 
When RGB says that Vaisnavsm first appeared as a reu gious reform, be seems to suggest that it was orthodor in ongo and that it represented an extension of Vedic thought in a particu lar direction According to him, the tide of free speculations initiated by the Upanisads culmida.ed 10 the east into such systems as Buddhism and Jardism and in the west into a theistic system with a god who had come to dnell among them The tendency to trace all religious ideologies - indeed, the entire Indian culture back to the Veda, in some way of the other, which characterised carly Todology, is evident here it must, however, be remembered that when the Vedic Aryans arsed so India they did not by any mcans step into a religious vacuum There is sufficient endence to show that differedt religious sects prevailed in diferent regions of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan India It is possible to identify at least tko such pre-Vedic non-Aryan cults Ope tpay designate

them as the Muni-Yati-cult and the Bhakti-cult with a view to distinguishing them from the exotic Vedic Aryan cult which may be called the Rsi cult The Muni-Yati-cuit, with its emphasis on Yoga, Tapas, Sampyāsa, etc, was a characteristic feature of the pre-Vedic non Aryan Siva-religion of the Indus valley as also of the ancient Magadhan religious complex which served as the fountainhead of Jainism and Buddhism,1while the autochthonous character of Bhakti, as evidenced, among others, by its connec tions with the indigenous worship of the Mother-Goddess and the Nāga-and the Yaksa cults, its vegetal and fertility symbolism, and the bacchalian element in it, is now generally accepted 11 It can also be seen that the Muni-Yatı cult and the Bhakti-cult did not fail to influence the Rsi cult, both positively and negatively The Vedic religion adopted the pre-Vedic non-Aryan Śiva in the form of Rudra,s while it is not improbable that Vasistha's attitude towards Varuna reflects the influence of the Bhaktr-cult 26 Negati. vely, the hieratic Vedic religion exhibited obvious loathness for the Yatıs, the Sınadevas, and the Müradevas 17 
On account of its freshness, energy, and flush of victory, the Vedic religion succeeded in keeping the indigenous popular reli gious sects suppressed for a fairly long time But when, about the end of the period of the major Upanisads (7th-6th centuries B C), the hold of Vedism, for obvious reasons, began to weaken, those popular religious cults again gatliered strength - indeed, to such an extent that they soon posed a serious challenge to the Vedic religion itself 19 There was, however, some difference in the attitudes of the religious sects mentioned above While Jainism and Buddhism openly revolted against the hegemony of

Vedism, the Bhaktı-religion, for some practical reasons, sought to establish a kind of liaison with it. 
Bhaktı for a personal god constatates the very bernel of Vaisnavism. It would seem that the tbestic region, »ith Bhakti for the deified Vrsar hero Vasudeva (who, it may be emphasized, s not mentioned in any early Vedic text) as its central tenet, was one of the several sects which re-emerged as powerful religious forces in the days of the decline of Vedista incidentally, it may be noted that, like Vásudeva soho belonged to the tribe of the Vrstus, Mahāvīra and Gautama Baddha who consolidated their religious doctrines (the origin of which, as pointed out carlier, can be traced back to the pre-Vedic Magadhan thought complex), at about this very time also belooged to the tribes of the Jatrkas and the Sakyas respectively RGB has nghtly iodicated that the starting point of shat He today ander Stand by Vaisaasism was got the worship of Visco - it was the worship of Vasudeva This Vasudevis, bich represented the primary phase of Varpayit, naust have become fairly well established in the days of Panin (Sth century BC ), for, Panini was required to eduociate a special Sūtra (IV 3 93) governing the formation of the word rāsuderaka in the sense of a "Bhakta or devotee of the pre-eminently worsłupful god vasudeva "1) The tradition of the supreme godbead of Vasudeva acd of Vasudevism has been continuous since that time Megasthedes (4th century BC) speaks of the people of Sarasena who held Heracles (by whom Megastheces obviously meant Vasudeva-Krsna) in special Seneration. As pointed out by RGB, a Niddesa passage also suggests that Vasudeva-Torship prevailed in the 4th century BC* "The Bhagavadgită (3rd century B C ) eulogises the man of knowledge, who at the end of several births, betakes himself unto the Lord 10 the conviction that “ Vástdeva is AU (VII 19) Ye

then have the Besnagar inscription, belonging to the last quarter of the second century BC, on the Garudadhvaja of Vāsudeva, the god of gods, erected by Heliodoros, the Bhāgayata, the son of Dian and an inhabitant of Taksasili 
The historical tradition that the god Vasudeva originally belonged to the tribe of the Vrsnis is well attested ' For instance, in the Bhagavadgitā, the Lord unequivocally declares that of the Vrsnis he is Vasudeva (X 37) The Mahābhāsya of Patañjalı (150 B C ) also clearly speaks of Vasudeva as belonging to the Vrsni tribe 22 Again, as pointed out by ROB, Vasudeva is closely related to the other deified Vrsni hero Samkarsana in the Ghosundi stone inscription of Sarvatāta, belonging to the second half of the first century BC, and the Nanaghat cave jöscription of the Satavahana queen Nāgapikā of the first century B C %3 The Kāśikā emphasizes this close relationship between Samkarsana and Vāsudeva by giving the example, dvandyam sam karsananāsudaiau, to illustrate P VIII 1 15, atjantasahacarite lokaviñāte diandram Ity upasamhlyanam 
Though the religion centering round the popular god Vásu. deya had become well established since before Panini's time, it is strange that the Buddhist canonical text Amguttaranikaya,44 which mentions such religious sects as the Ajivikas, the Nirgranthas, the Mundafrāvakas, etc, does not refer to the Vasudevakas Simi larly Aśoka's inscriptions, which mention the Śramapas, the Brāhmanas, the Ajivikas, and the Nirgranthas, do not speak of the Vasudevakas The only possible explanation of this would be that Vāsudevism, which was naturally restricted to the regions dominated by its chief promoters, namely, the Vrsojs, the Sātvatas, and the Yadayas-Ābhiras, had not will then spread far towards Eastern India which was the provenance of Buddhism As against this, it was well known to Papini of Takşasılā as also to Megasthenes, and it attracted, in course of time, even

nous religious sects among sh.ch are iccluded the worshippers of Vasudesa and Baladera. So far as Jainism is concerned, it seems to have been more positively responsive to Väsuderism. Ths Vasudeva-legends have markedly influenced the Jain2 hagio logy, particularly its concept of suty-three cläkāpuruscs who comprise, among others, nine Vasudevas, cine Baladeras, and ane Prativísuderas 
Another striking point about the Vásudet-religion is that the word tāsuderaha, in the sense of a Bhakta of Vasudeva, is cot attested in any available literary work. On the other hand, since a descriptive grammaria lie Panini has devoted a separats Sutra to the morphology of that word, it must have been farly common in his time. We are, therefore, constrained to assume that cons.derable Literature of pop-Vedic characters existed in Parni's time but that it 15 now lost to us * 
RGB has not discussed the implication of the latter member of the compound rasudevorsräthjām 10 P IV 3 98 it stors that, besides the Vasudeva religion, there also existed, Proini's time, a religious sect centering rourd Arjuna. But, colile the Vasudesa-religion, the religious history of ladu knows hardly anything of the Arjuna-religion It is suggested that P 19.3 98 doss nat presuçpose Iso independent religious sects - one of the Vasudevakas and the other of the Arjunakas - tut teat the Sutra refers to one single religious sect with Visudeva as the supreme god add Arjuna as the special derotee Obviously, this sugges. tion 13 not supported by the wording of the Sütre.

Further, from the manner in which they have been referred to by Panini, it may be assumed that these two cults were closely allied to each other - the Vasudeva cult having been regarded, even at that time, as being superior to the Arjuna-cult In the Rgvedic mythology, Visnu is closely associated with Jodra 28 According to Sotapatha Brāhniana II 1 2 11 and V 4 3 7, Arjuna is a secret or mystical (guhja) name of Indra, while, a later Vaisna vism, the personality and character of Vedic Visnu have been merged into those of Vāsudeva 29 Therefore, the alliance between the Vasudeva-sect, with which Pánını seems to have been familiar, may be said to correspond, in a way, with the alliance between Vişnu and Indra 80 Another prototype of such an alliance is to be seen in the religious ideology pertaining to Nara and Nārā. yana, 31 wherein Nara may be regarded as the alter ego of Indra (of the Rgeda) and Arjuna (of P IV 398) and Nārāyana as that of Visou (of the Rgveda) and Vasudeva (of P IV 398) It would seem tbat, even in the joitial stages of their history, the Vasudeva sect subdued and subsumed within itself the Arjuna sect 32 That would account for the fact that no traces of this latter sect have been preserved either in history or literature 
RGB has not said much about the Samkarsana-religion, though he has suggested that Samkarsana might have originally been a god outside the Vaisnava pantheon 33 Like the Arjuna religion, the Samkarsana-religion also seems to bave arisen as an independent religion, but, unlike the former, its historical deve

lopment can be reconstructed from literary and archaeological sources in the Mahabharata, Samkarseda or Balarama is repre sented as a Vrsai hero, the elder son of Vasudeva and Rohini, but he does not play any siguificant role in the great cpic." The earliest literary reference to the Samkarsana-cult is to be foord in Rounlira-Arthašāstra (4th century BC) XIII 367, a hicb speaks of the spies disguised as the ascetic worshippers of Samkarsana IAdolgence io intoucating drinks seems to have been a special feature of that cult Megasthenes says that Dropysus ( = Bacchus, God of wine) is represented in India by three gods, and from the further description it becomes clear that, according to the Greek writer, one of them is Samkarsana to the intral stages of its evolution, the Sankarsana-calt was closely related to the Nāga cult-a fact which later led to the belief that Samkarsana was an Avatāra of Sesa or Adapta-Naga Sankarsapa's copfections with Inebrety and the stake-cult further led to his belog often identi fied with Rudra-Siva in the Pāñcarátra-Samhitas 25 A further piece of evidence in support of the assumption that the Sam karsana-religioc must have originated independently of the Yāsu desa-religion is the Mathură sculpture of the second century B C., depicting Samkarsana by himself. It is however, not correct to say that Samlarsana was originally a non-Brabmancal agricultural dexty which later came to be destified asth Balarama, 3* for, Samlarsana and Balarādia novaere appear as two separate Ludividuals 
The worship of Sankarsana constituting an independent religious sect may be thus presumed to have ansen more or less contemparageously with Vasudevism, but its sphere of influence seems to have been rather restricted Soon, the two independent religions, namely, the Samkarsana-religion and the Vasudeva.

religion, came to be closely allied to each other It is this stage in the religious history which is reflected in the Mahabhāsya of Patañjalı, the Niddesa text, and the Ghosundi and Nanaghat 10$ criptions Attention has recently been drawn also to a joint representation of Vasudeva and Samkarsana belonging to the second century BC Two points peed to be noted in this connection The alliance between the Samkarsana cult and the Vāsudeva-cult was not the result, as suggested by some scholars, ai of a deliberate attempt to assimilate the Naga-cult into the Vasudeva-religion, rather it seems to have been prompted by the historical necessity of preserving and consolidating the religious cohesion of the Vrsnis - Sátvatas which would have been adversely affected if these two religious sects, which had arised within the tribe, had been allowed to develop independently of each other Secondly, the mention in the inscriptions of Samkarsana before Vāsudeva does not imply the precedence of the Samkarsana religion over the Vasudeva-religion 39 Such a mention is only formal and is presumably occasioned by the historical fact that Samkarsana was the elder of the two Vrsni brothers who had been deified It may be noted that the Ghosundi löscription characterises both the gods equally as anıhata, bhagavat, and sarvesvara 
The other development in the religious history of that same period -a development which must bave been independent of the first, namely, the alliance on equal terms between the Samkarsana religion and the Vasudeva-religion -- was in the direction of the evolution of the doctrine of the Vyuhas Though the doctrine of the Vyühas, in its developed form, first occurs in the Nārāyaniya section (early centuries of the Christian era )40 11 is adumbrated

RGB says that Vasudeva was also called Krsoa because bus gotta was Kársaiyana * In thus condection he emphasizes the Vedic affiliations of Krsna by pointing out that one Krsni Angi rasa is the Rsi of RV VIII 74, that the same Krsna Angira sa is mentioned in KB 30 9, and that Krsna occurs in the Chandau ga-Upanisad as the pupil of Ghora Angirasa The Vedic seer Krsoa could thus have been a founder of a gorra RGB further adds that, though Vasudeva belonged to the Ksatriya family or the Vrsnis, he must have adopted the gotra of his Brāhmaga priest for sacrificial purpose. 3 In support of his assumption, RGB refers to the commentary of the Ghara-Jätaka which seems to suggest that Vasudeva belonged to the Kānhāyan3 gorra AN this argument, however, is rather farfetched Even assuming that Vasudeva did adopt the Kārsnīyana gotra, one would not be able to explain why Vasudeva was called Krsna He might have called himself Kärscāyana, but not Krspa One hardly finds a person adopting the name of the founder of his gorra as his additional personal name The commentary of the Ghara-Jataka, which 100 is a little confused about the gorra-dame and the personal name, obviously represents a later tradition Incidentally, Krsna of the Chándogya-Upanısad need not have been a Brāhmana scer 
Another assumption, wtuch is often made up this context, is that, from the very beginning, Krsoa was an additional personal name of Vasudeva of the Vrsnis * It is however, rather dousual

that an individual should have been originally given two equally important personal names Pānını, who knows Vasudeva as a god, nowhere alludes to Krsna being the other name of that god Similarly, in connection with the Vyūba-doctrine, which is asso ciated jo a distinctive manner with the Vrsni heroes, the game Krsna is hardly ever mentioned It is also difficult to accept the suggestion that Vrsni Vasudeva was called Kysna on account of his dark complexions and that, in course of time, the epithet became a personal name As regards the names Vasudeva and Krsna, the view is sometimes put forth that Krsna was the original name of the Viso: hero and that Vasudeva was just bus patronym derived from his father's name Vasudeva This view cannot be accepted for various reasons Firstly, Patañjali's commentary on Yārttika 7 of P IV 1 11446 indicates that Vasudeva (and not Vasudeva) is the basic form of the name of the Vrsni hero and that the termi pation an affixed to this original name Vasudeva also gives the form Vasudeva Secondly, if Vasudeva was really a patronym, Balarāma or Samkarsana, who is represented as the elder brother of Kysna, should have been more aptly called Vasudeva But that is not the case On the other hand, we find Krsna and Bala tāma being specifically referred to by their matronyms, namely, Devakiputra and Raubineya respectively The rivalry among some Ksatriya princes for the real dryine "Vasudevahood" also clearly goes against Vasudeva being regarded as a patronym "? Again the etymologies of the word vasudeva given by the Maha. bhārataand Ujjvaladatta's gloss of Unādısūtra I 1" would leave po doubt that Vasudeva was regarded as the onginal name and not a patronym 60 JACOBI mentions the fact,s1 which is particu.

larly significant in the present context, panely, that the name Vāsobhadra sometimes occurs as an auxiliary of Vasudeva 5We have, therefore, to conclude that, just as Krsna was not an addi tional personal name of Vasudeva, Vasudeva was not the patronym of Krsna 
The troth of this whole matter Seeros to be that Vásudera and Krsna were originally two distinct personalities As pointed out earlier, Vasudeviso must have originated at a fairly early dates so that it could become thoroughly well established ja Panini's time Perhaps a little later than the Vasudeva-religion, there grew another religious sect round the figure of Kisoa who had onginally been the tnbal hero and religious leader of the Yadavas" but who was subsequently made into a god This Yadava Kssnas may as well have been the same as Devakiputra Krsna who is represented in Chandoglo-Upanisad III 17 1 as a pupil of Ghora Angirasa and who is said to have learnt from bus teacher the doctrine that man's ufe is a kind of sacnfice 54 Chropology does not go against such an assumption, indeed, it supports st.

Though RGB does not consider Yādasa Krsna to have been distinct from Vrsai Vasudeva, he does believe that the Gopāla Krspa element #25 introduced to Visudevisnt at a fauly late stage in tbe development of the latter " He points out that no reference to Gopāla Krsna occurs in the epigrap ucal records like the Ghosundi and the Nanaghat Inscriptions, nor does it occur wa the Mahabhäsja of Patañjalı or even in the Nārāyaniya section of the Afahabhārara No doubt, 10 the Sabhāpatvan, Sisapāla is represented as referring tauotingly to Krsna's exploits' in the Gokula, like the killing of Pūtapā,« but RGB regards that passage as an interpolation Similarly he accepts the interpretation of Kisa's name Govinda, given in the Adiparyan and the Soupar vau, as "fader of the earth", thereby rejecting any suggestion regarding Krsca having been connected with the cons Honever, be hasteus to add that, care probably, the game means “finder of the cows ” Finally he concludes that the story of Krsna's boybood in the Gokula was doknown till about the beginning of the Christus era, that it occurs w its full-fledged form only m the Hanıramsa, the Vāvu-Purând, and the Bhagarata-Purând, that some of the elements in the Gopāla Krsna mythology, which clearly betray Christus influence, such as, the worship of the boy god and the story of his humble buth, his reputed father's kuon. Jedge that he has not his son, and the massacre of the innocents, were brought into India by the Abhiras when they migrated into this country in the first century A D , and that the Abhiras possibly brought with them abo the name Christ, which probably led to the identification of the boy-god with Vasudeva-Krsna

There can be little doubt that the religion centering round the cowherd child-god Krsna originated among the Domadic cowherd community of the Abhiras « In the Padma-Purand, the supreme god is represented as announcing that he would be born among the Abhiras in his eighth incarnation 65 Similarly, in the Harnamsa and the Balacarita" of Bhāsa, Krsna is said to have been brought up in a ghosa, and, according to the Amarakoša, se ābhirapalli is a synonym of ghosa The religious cult of Gopāla Krsna abjured the lodra dominated Vedic religion (as is evidenced by the Govardhana-episode ) and promoted religious sublimation of sensuous Jove (cf the relationship between Krsna and the Gopis) 
We need not here go into the question of the origin of the Abhiras Whether they were a foreign tribeor an aboriginal one living in Panjab," there is sufficient evidence to show that they were in India already in the third century BC" So RGB's suggestion regarding the Christian influences brought in by the Abhiras cannot be sustained 72 Again, the so-called similarities between the legends pertaining to Gopala Krsna and Christ, to which RGB refers, are patently superficial Atteotion may also be drawn to a Mathurā sculpture, depicting Vasudeva as crossing the Yamunā with the baby Krsoa in a basket, which has been assigned to the Kusāna period 73 This may be taken to prove

that the legend regarding Krsna's transference to Gokula (whuch, in its turo, is the result of the merger of the Vasudeva-Krsna religion and the Gopāla-Krsna-religion) had already been la common vogue even in the first century A D Similarly a figure of Govardhanadhara Krsna in red sandstone, from Mathurā, is assigned to the same period. Bhāsa, who has to be assigned to a still earlier period, portrays, in huis Balacarita, various episodes in Kisga's life in the cow-settlemeat As for RGB's contention that the passage in the Sabhāparvan, mentioned above, may be an interpolation, the evidence of the Critical Edition of the Mahabha. rata goes counter to it Indeed, there are a few other passages in the Mahabharata which betray knowledge of Krsna's life in the GokulaAll the same, one does not fail to get the impression that the redactors of the Mahabharata must have made deliberate attempts to suppress many of the episodes of Gopāla Krsoa's boyhood in the Gokula, particularly bis amours with the Gopis, presumably because those redactors wanted specially to highlight Krsna's character as a divine teacher of new ethucs **

affiliations of Abhira Gopāla Krsna As against this, Indra is often described in the RV as govid (=finder of cows ), but Gopāla Krsna, as we have seen, asks his followers to desist from Indra worship and to regard cons as their deities The original non Vedic character of the Gopāla-Krsna-cult is thus beyond doubt 
It would seem that the Gopāla-Krsna-religion of the Abbiras was, in course of time, engrafted on the organically united Vasudeva-Krsna religion of the Vrsnis-Yādavas 81 This must have happened some time before the third century BC, for, the Bhagavadgita contains the words govindas2 and heśınısüdana 3 which are reminiscent of Krsna's boyhood days in the Gokula Similarly, Katyāyana (3rd century BC) found it necessary to add a Vārttika to P III 1 138 to explain the morphology of the name Govinda84 which must have become fairly common in his days The words damodara and govinda, which definitely belong to the Gopāla-Krsna religious complex, also occur in the Baudha Jana-Dharmasūtra (If 5 24 ) of about the same period 
The amalgamation of the Vasudeva-religion of the Vrsnis, the Kfsna-religion of the Yādavas, and the Gopāla-religion of the Abhiras gave rise to what may be called a new Krsnatsm If, as pointed out earlier, Vāsudevism represented the first phase of classical Vaisnavısm, this new Krsnaism represented its second (and perhaps most outstanding) phase New legendary links were forged whereby Vasudeva, Kysna, and Gopāla were integra ted into a single homogeneous mythological pattern Vasudeva, who, as the result of the merger of the Vasudeva-religion and the Kpna religion, had already come to be regarded as Krsoa's 
81 It may be emphasized that such engrafting was facilitated on account of the cultural and polatıcal affinity among the Vrinis, the Y davas, and the Abhiras The commonness of the name Kına may also have served as a Jupporting factor

father, was now represented as having transferred his infaat soo Kisza to the care of his fnend Narda, the Abira leader of a ghosa, with a view to goarding him agamst the misfortune of merciless slaoghter which his earlier children had suffered at the hands of hus brother-in-law Kansa. There, in the Gokula, the boy Krsda grew in the company of Gopas and Gopis as Gopāla Krsca ( Abbira element) From there, he ( with his elder brother Sankarsana-Balarama) weat over to Mathoră, killed Kamsa, and thereby put an end to the latter's despotic rule (Vrsni elemeat) Thereafter, Krsna migrated to Dvārakā to found and foster the bangdom of the Yadavas (Yadava element) He also played the role of the friend and mentor of the Pandavas. Such was the composite mythology of Krsnaism The religo philosophico-ethical doctrine of this Krsnauso is embodied so the Bhagavadgita 
The third century B C was the most eventful period 10 the hstory of Vardayism. As we have seen, Vasudevism-Kisiasm originated and developed as an essentially non-Vedic religious sect. Other heterodox religions, particularly Buddhism, bad abo been flourishing, so much 50 taat, in the thud century BC, Buddhism reached almost the peak of its power It must have, indeed, inspired the fear that it would soon overwhelm not only the declining Vedic religioa but also other non-Vedic religious sects Väsudeyism-Krsdam, therefore, prepared itself to meet this serious challenge. It did so in two ways Firstly it rated together all the religious forces akin to it. The amalgamation of the Vasudera-Krsda-religion ard the Gopāla-Kisca-religion and the consequent bridging into being of the new Krsnauso, to which a reference has been made above, was an important step 1 that direction The other line of action, which it followed, may be said to have been rather unexpected Non-Vedic 12 origint and development, Krsnaism Cow sought affidation with Vedism howsoever tenuous and fornal that afiliauon might be - so that It could thereby make itself acceptable to the still not loconsi derable orthodox clements among the people the rear-guards of the langushing Vedum, on their pari, bad also been wintig

to reclaim its former position for one thing, they tried to revive, reorganize, and revitalise the traditional Vedic way of life and thought, the literary monuments of this movement were the Srauta-, the Dharma-, and the Gțbya-Sūtras As an additional measure, they must have welcomed the prospect of at least some Vedic elements being preserved through Krsnaism 
The rapport which Krsnaism was striving to establish with Vedism was thus expected to prove beneficial both to Vedista and Krsnaism This is the background on which the Visnu-ele ment and the Nārāyana-element came to be merged into Krsna15m. RGB has dealt with thus merger, but he does not give its histori 
cal rationale 
We need not here analyse in detail the Visou-mythology in the Rgveda Suffice it to say that it symbolises an important motif in the evolution of Vedic mythology, namely, hierarchisation of popular religion Visnu was originally a popular dividity of fertility and growth, conceived (as in several primitive mytho. logies) in the form of bird $6 However, popular pressure seems to have rendered it necessary to admit Visou in the hieratic Vedic pantheon The artificiality of this mythological elevation of Visou is indicated by the forced manner in which he has been brought into association with Indra, who was, as it were, the philosopher's stone in the matter of hierarchtsation And, when Visou was thus being related to Indra, the Vedic poet-priest took care to suppress the original fertility traits in Visnu s character and to superimpose on him the conventional solar character RGB 15, indeed, right in not stressing the Rgvedic Visou's identity with the sun The superimposition of solar character on Visnu was presumably facilitated by the common symbol of bird' which represented both the fertility-divioity and the sun In the course of the further evolution of the Visnu-mythology, Vişnu came to be regarded as the supreme (parama) god from the ritualistic point of view 67 It was, however, his character as a

god of fertility and growth which appealed most to the popular imagination aod which consequently served as the most const nient point of contact between Krspasm (particularly its Gorila Krsta aspect) and Vedism It is also not unlikely that the popular understanding - or rather misunderstanding - of the Rgvedic Vispu's epithet gopi and of the gorah 10 his highest aboder, also helped the identification of the popular god Krsma with the Vedic Visco

in the Baudhāyana Dharnasūtra," which belongs to about the same period as the Bhagavadgita, Visnu is called Govinda and Dāmodara, and in the Taittiriya- Aranyaka," which is a little posterior to the Bhagavadgitā, he is identified with Vasudeva and Nārāyana The identity of Vāsudeva with Visnu is also suggested by the fact that, in the Besnagar inscription, Vasudeva's column is called Garuda column Further, according to WEBER," the fact that, in Patanjali's commentary on Vārtika 6 of P III 1 26, the episodes of Kamsavadba (of which Krsna is the hero) and Balibandha (of which Visnu is the hero) have been mentioned together, shows that Krsna and Visnu stood in close relationship with each other 100 Similarly, it is significant that a coin of the Vr$o1-rājanyagana of the first century B C bears the two emblems of Visou cakra on the reverse and Garuda on the observe lol Incidentally it may be mentioned that, in the Mahabharata, the Dame Visnu occurs less frequently than the dames, Vasudeva, Krşna, and Nārāyana 
Two points need to be specially noted in connection with the assimilation of the Visnu element by Krsnaism Firstly, when Visnu came to be assimilated into Kęşgaism, there occurred a vital change in his character in the Rgvedic mythology, Visou is represented as a subordinate ally of Indra In Krsnaism, Visnu not only supersedes Indra but, in his role as Krsna, he actively antagonises him The legends concerning the Govardhana moud. tain and the Părijāta tree would confirm this 102 Secondly, it is not quite correct to characterise the assimilation of the Visqu

clement into Krsnaism as the 'Brahmapisation' of Kisaasm, for, it actually resulted in the Krsna isation of Visou rather than 10 the Vissursation of Krspa No significant Brahmanic traits are seen to have been introduced into Krsgaism together with the Visau element Indeed, the position of Vipu jo this entire petly evoked religious complex is such as would hardly justify that religious complex being designated as Vaisnavism The only indication of Visau's predominance is to be found in the newly propagated belief that Kisha was an dyatāsa or incarnation of Visnu 
The araráras constitute a special characteristic of Vaisna135m. RGB has ooted the vanous references to aratăras, 10 but he has not discussed the gralăra-theory as such. The oatāra-theory is essentially purpose-onented in the Bhagavadgitā, the Lord declares that, whenever Dharma (righteousness ) languishes and Adharma (unrighteousness) thrles, be jocarpates himself The moral aspect of the aratărc-theory is emphasized by suggesting that god comes down to man in order that man may strive to become god by following bus example 105 The aratára-theory also facilitated the transcendent being brought into direct relation with the phenomenal world It promoted the doctrines of Bhakti and grace by providig their very sine que non, namely, a personal god Further, the avatāra-theory gave the psychologically much needed assurance that god tas not merely an indifferent and bainterested spectator of the world-process which he bad initiated but that he was responsibly involved in t From the point of view of the history of Hinduism, the aratára theory may be said to have helped the synthesis of various religious sects which that religion had sought to accomplish It integrated into a sugle scheme the presıdıpg divinities of those sects by regarding them

The Bhagavadgitā reflects the stage of Krsnaism after it had assimilated the Vispu element RGB gives a detailed chapterwise summary of the BG He also discusses at some length the sour ces of the religion of the BG.107 RGB is too prone to trace the origin of most of the teachings of the BG to the Upanisads Thus, for instance, he connects (not quite convincingly!) the BG do ctrine of Karmayoga with the insistence of the Ita-Upanisad(st 2) on man's doing actions resolutely for a hundred years coupled with the idea of non-contamination resulting from an elevated state of mind as spoken of in Chandogja-Upan sad IV 14 3, Brhadāranyaka-Upanisad IV 23, and Mauri-Upanısad VI 20 Further, according to RGB, the BG derives the attributes of the Supreme, the concept of brahmanirvāna, and even the teaching of Bhaktı from the Upanisadic sources It would, however, seem that, in the matter of essential attitude and doctrine, the BG represents a kind of reaction against the prevailing Vedic ideo logy It must be said to have adequately responded to the needs of the hour Broadly speaking, the major Upanisads, which mark the acme of the religio-philosophical culture of the Vedas, teach that the ultimate goal of human life is the realisation of the essential identity of the individual soul and the universal soul which results from the complete withdrawal from the fundament ally unreal phenomenal world The Upanisadıc attitude is thus individualistic and, to a large extent, negative As against this, the BG emphasizes the ideal of lokasamgraha -of the stability, solidarity, and progress of the society The society cao fuaction properly only on the principle of the ethical interdependence of Its various constituents Man must, therefore, see to it that, as an essential constituent of society, he furthers this process of lokasamgraha through an active awareness of his social obligations

Another significant trait of Krspası, which is not reflected m the BG but which is clearly brought out by Krsaa's character as represented in the Mahabhārata, is its new political ethics which issists on the urgency of attaming the end, which one considers to be right, by any means even if they sometimes do not appear to be so nght 143

The assimilation of the Nārāyana-element into Krsnaism,111 which is generally regarded as the second major factor in the process of the so-called brahmanization of Krsnaism, does not seem to have been known to the Bhagavadgitā The name Nārā yana does not occur in the Bhagavadgitá, nor does the doctrine of the Vyūhas which is believed to have been taught to Nārada by the great Being in the Shetadvipa (that is, Nārāyana ) 119 RGB's suggestion that the doctrice of the Vyühas may have been implied in the Bhagaiadgita VII 4-5, wherein a reference is made to the eightfold prakrt of the Lord,115 is not at all convincing It would seem that, very soon after the final redaction of the Bhagavadgitā, Nārāyana became an essential constituent of Vasudevism-Krsnaism The Taittirii a-Aran) aka x 11 clearly identifies Nārāyana, Vasudeva, and Visnu 111 The association of Nirāyana with Vasudevism-Krsnaism must have become well established since then The Ghosundi 10scription of Sarvatāta speaks of the närājana-kataka115 for the place of worship of Samkarsana and Vasudeva In the Malībhārata XII 321 16-17, the supreme god is said to have manifested himself in the four forms - Nara, Nārāyana, Hari, and Krsna Nārāyana is also glorified there as sanatadharnagopta (XII 322 5) He declares that he can be seen only by those who devoutly follow the ekontıha dharma (XII 326 12) In the Devabodhisatnośāstra, Āryadera (second century A D ) quotes certain sayings of

The name Narayan3 is variously explained On the face of it, it looks like a gorro-rate (like Kātāyana or Vätsyayar3 ) derived from the same Nara. Nárayana pas accordingly regarded as a sage born in the family of another sage called Nara It was further soggested that both these sages, who were later deified, were originally great sun-worshippers, which fact facilitated the later identification of Narayana with Visot Horever, in the Mahabharata, it is Nara ano is represented as having been born as the result of the austerities of Nārāyana There is also po evidence to suggest their connection with sup-worshup Further, doubt us expressed as to the propriety of the highest god being the descendant of any ope else 1 According to llamusmrti I 10, Nārāyana was so called because his primary abade (pürra ayana ) was waters (rärah) 19 Bat there Nārāyana is obviously represca ted as being identical with Brahma-Prajapati rather than with Visou.

ingenious way He understands nāra in the sense of a collection of naras or men, and ayana in the sense of a resting place or goal The god Nārāyana is thus the resting place or goal of men "0 BHANDARKAR refers, in this context, to the statement made by Keśava or Hari to Arjuna that he is known as the resting place or goal of men (narānām) 121 The form nāra is no doubt possible, but it is by no means common BHANDARKAR'> explanation is, accordingly, farfetched and, therefore, not very convincing 122 It would rather seem that Nara and Nārāyana originally constituted one single personality conceived as having been made up of two closely related aspects and that the essential idea underlying it was that of the "cosmic male" or Purusa 123 
RGB's analysis of the Narajanījalt! is excellent, but it does not throw much light on how and why the Nārāyana-element might have been merged into Vásudevism-Kţsnaism The several references to the ascetics-yogins associated with Nārāyana in Badarı or Svetadvipaat would indicate that the Nara-Nārāyana cult had originated independently of the Veda, but the connection of Nārāyana with the Indus valley civilization cannot be validly

established 11: Tradition invests the Nārāyana-cult with great antiquity, for, Nārāyana is described as Jo'rau karājano nama pürtesām api pūrvajah 17 It is not unlikely that this very same Nārāyana was adapted into the Vedic ideology in the form of Purusa Nārāyana of the Satapotha-Brahmana, 11• According to the Satapatha-Brāhmana XII 3 4, Praäpat urged Parusa Nārāyana to perform a sacrifice He did so and, as the result of it, he "placed himself in all the worlds, in all the gods, un alt the Vedas, and in all the vital airs, and they were placed m him."?l?! In the Satapatha-Brahmana XIII 6 1, Purusa Nára. yana is said to have performed a Purusamedha extending over five Dights whereby he superseded all beings and himself became identical with the All Presumably, it was this latter reference which gave rise to the tradition of Nārāyana being associated with the famous cosmological hymn, the Purusosukta (RVX 90 ),139 as its Rs. But what seems to have facilitated the merger of Nārāyana toto Vasudeviso-Krsoais (which was intended to serve the same purpose as the merger of Vuspo) was not so much hus cosmic character and function as his dual personality as Purisa Nārāyana Correspondence could be easily established among the four pairs, namely, Nara-Nārāyana of Badarikäsrama, Perusa-Nārāyana of the Satcrarha-Brahmana, Indra-Visnt of the Rgvedic mythology, and Arjuna-Vasudeva of Vasudevism Krsaalstu.

132 The view of some scholars that the Nardyopisa waplies an actual journey of some Indian Vauppa vas to Christian countries and the subscquent coclusion of Christ among the incarnations of Narayana is now proved to be quite unwarranted It is suggested (S CHATTOPADITYAYA, OP al., 56 ) that, since Pamı (Meru ) was the provenance of the Pancarācra doctrine, it may have received some 10spiration from the Central Asiatic region in the buipa age

There is little in the remaining portion of RGB's treatment of Vaisnavism that calls for agy special comment or amplifica. tion 139 Among other things, he points out that, from about the first century B C up to the time when the Guptas rose to power in the first quarter of the fourth century A D , there are no epigraphical or sculptural traces of any Brahmapic religious system, and then presents a brief chronological survey, mainly on the basis of inscriptions of the development of Vaisnavism from the fourth to the eleventh century, principally in accordance with the mode professed by the Bhāgavatas 10 He further states that, in the original Ramayana, Rāma Dāśarathi was represented as a human hero and that it was only in the early centuries A D that he came to be regarded as an avatāra of Visnu 141 When, however, he says that there is no evidence of the Rāma-cult as such till the eleventh century AD,+ one finds it difficult to agree with him, for, one is then naturally reminded of the mention of Rama girisvāmin in the Rithpur copperplate jascription of Prabhīvati guptā (about 407 A D) and of Citrakūtasvämın (= Rāma) in tbe Gadhava Daśāvatāra temple inscription of 468 AD, of the rules regarding the construction of the image of R.Ima given in Varāhamıhıra's Brhatsamlilā (c 550 A D ), and of the Kerala king Kulasekhara ( 8th century AD) who was a special devotee of Rāma 
RGB speaks of the two classes of Varnava votaries in South India -- the Alvārs and the Acāryas (the two main tenets of these latter being Bhaktı and the rejection of the doctrine of Māyā) But it is difficult to agree with him in his suggestion that some of the teachings of Rāmānuja show the influence of Christianity"

Compared to Vaisnatism, the origin of Saivism is more obvi ous and its bustorical evolution less complex. Accordiog to RGB, the beginnings of Sansm have to be traced back to the Vedic god Rudra who personified the dreadful and destructive pheno mena of “the storms that uproot trees and even demolish houses, accompanied by the thunderbolt which strikes down men and beasts dead in a moment and the epidemics that rage and carry off numbers of men " }{5 Rudra (from the root rud to honl') went about howlog with the stormy finds (Manuts) who were his sons (Rudrijas) RGB further adds that these dreadful phenomena trere the result of the wrath of Rofra which, how eser, could be appeased with prayer, praise, and offenng Rudra then became Sta or the benignant one to the RV, Rudra stood for the destructive agency of lightning But when he was daly propitiated with prayers, he became pasupă protector of the cattle. (I 114 9) Rudra caused dueases, but he also possessed the healing remedies (I 43 4) This ambivalent character of Rodra was often emphasized in the RV The conception of the Vedic Rudra gradually developed further until, as seen in the Sala rudnia (TS IV 51, VS 16), he became the god "of wild and awful scenes, such as cemeteries, mountains and forests. Of the beasts and savages that dwelt io these last and of the threses and outcasts that resorted to them, he became the lord" 119 Subsequ ently he developed into the god who pervaded the uonerse, dwelt in fire and water, in all beings, and in herbs and trees, and thus became the supreme ruler of all. Indeed, as pointed out by RGB,

even in the Ry, Rudra was represented as having risen to supreme power (VII 46 2 It was in this form that the god became "the subject of Up,unisad speculation, by meditating on whom and seeing whom everywbere in the universe a man attained bliss ful serenity " 117 
This theory put forth by RGB is characterised by the two common assumptions of early Indology, namely, (1) that the origin of everything Indian has ultimately to be traced back to the Veda and (2) that the Vedic gods are basically personifica. tions of natural phenomena It, however, needs to be emphasized that the real popular religion, which was essentially distinct from the Vedic religion, remaiped outside the purview of the Veda The Veda, it must be realised, does not teach us everything on ancient social and religious conditions of even Aryan India It may be said to have emanated from a parrow circle of poet priests, and reflects a somewbat singular view of things 148 Long before the advent of the Vedic Aryans, there had prevailed in various parts of India widely spread and deeply rooted popular religious cults Though they might have apparently suffered a kind of set back on account of the onslaught of the freshly vigorous Vedic way of life and thought, some of them proved influential enough to compel the sponsors of Vedism to accommodate them, in one form or another, in the framework of their religious ideology, And when, in the course of the religious history of India, Vedismi began gradually to decline, these popular religious cuits again came into their own and confirmed themselves as the religion of the people Such, in broad outline, is the genesis of Vaisnavism, Saivism, and other minor religious sects which together constitute the major part of the classical Hiaduism It has been rightiy observed that these religious sects are of a fairly ancient date though their positive history is comparatively modern 
How a pre-Yedic non-Aryac religion was adopted into the Vedic religious ideology is perhaps best illustrated by the pers

Onality and character of Vedic Rodra 143 From a corsory study of the varios references to Rudra in Vedic literature, one gens. rally gets the impression that two distinct Rudras are presented in that iterature - the Rgsedic Rudra, 29 who is a heavenly god 
7th Marots as his hosts, and the post-Rgvedic Rodra, who is earthly in character and is associated with evil spints and dread fol beings However, the basic identity of these two Rudras is quite onmistakable A critical consideration of the came, the outward appearance, and certain special features of these two Rudras would leave no doubt about this The distinction between the two Rudras is only apparent and is occasioned by varying emphasis 
It is a verred that the Vedic gods, in contrast with the Greek gods for instance, lack concretepess and "lifefolness', their characterisation tends to become stereotyped and conventiodal, and, therefore, pale and colourless Redra does not play any very important role in Vedic mythology and ntual, and yet, more particulars are given to the Veda about his personality and chara. cter than about those of many other gods As has been rightly pointed out, Rudra has more body' than the others He is shown as possessing a distinctie and more or less well-defined individuality He is clearly isolated from other Vedic gods 1 respect of appearance, dress, and other paraphernalia For instance, he is said to be brown (babhru I 33 5) or red in compleuon (VS 16 7) He is blue-necked ( IS 16 7) and blue tufted ( AV II 27 6), his belly is black and his back red ( AV XV 1 7-8) He is hapardır (f 114 1,5) and wears a multiform Decklace (niska) as his special ornament (11 33 10) He is also described as being clothed in a bide (VS 3 61, 16 51) The Autareya-Brāhmana (V 2 9) speaks of Rudra as appearing in a dark dress

Rudra is essentially ambivalent in character (which fact 15 duly noticed by RGB) He is described as a fierce god (II 33 9, 11, X 126 5), destructive like a terrible beast (11 33 11 ), un assailable and unsurpassed in might (I 114 4, II 33 3) Mention is frequently made of Rudra's death-bringing Missiles (If 33 10) As a matter of fact, fear of Rudra's terrible shafts and deprecation of his wrath and ill will may be said to be the ruling sentiments of a large number of Rgvedic passages concerning Rudra (II 33 4-6, 15) Rudra's very pame 18 frightening (II 33 8) It is to be never directly mentioned In the post-RV Vedic litera ture, Rudra's malevolence and wrathfulness are more frequently referred to and deprecated (VS3 61, AV XI 2) According to the Altareja-Brahmana (I]I 33), Rudra is the compound of the terrible forms of the gods, while the Sarapalha-Brāhmana (IX. 1 1 1, 6) says that even gods are afraid of hin But Rudra is not exclusively malevolent and maleficent For, he is said to bestow blessings on his worshippers (I 114 1, 2, II 33 6) and generally look after the welfare of man and beast (1 43 6) He sees to it that the inhabitants of a village are well fed and free from disease (1 114 1) But by far the most significant reference in this coonection is the one to Rudra's great healing powers He is the physician of physicians ( II 33 4), whose remarkable remedies are often praised by the Rgvedic poets (I 114 5, II 33 7, 12, V 42 11, VII 46 3) Rudra's healing powers are referred to also jo the post-RV Vedic literature (AV II 27 6, VS 3 59, 16 5,49), but less frequently than his frightful and destructive nature This double personality' of Rudra seems to have been regarded by the Rgvedic poets as the special distinguishing feature of that god Abrahmodya stanza (VIII 29 5) indirectly speaks of Rudra as a god, who is at once ferocious (ugra) and bright and holy (suur), and who wields in his hand a sharp weapon (tigma ayudha) and at the same time possesses marvellous healing powers (alasabhesaja ) 
Similarly, on the one hand, Rudra is called the ruddy boar of the heaven (1 114 5), or the great Asura of the heaven (II I 6), wbile, on the other, the Satarudrija associates him with various

kinds of people and places on the earth. He is glonfied as the lord of thueves, pilferers and plunderers (VS 16 20-22) Not only this, he is himself charactersed as robber and prowler (eren In RI L 114 4, Rudra is referred to as ranku kari), cheater and decenser (ibid) 11 In the Satarurija, Rudra is presented with all the characteristics of purely popular origin - as a figure so real 10 popular consciousness As so appositely obsersed by BARTH, "We can concene nothing more life-like than the figure which stands out from this piece of rede realism, but nothing, at the same time, less Brahmanic * In this opesual litany, we hardly come across any espression bearidg on ritual or any allusion to a sacred custom Rudra certainly does cot appear here as a sosereigo god, but there are clear indications that he must have originally been on 
Rudra does not enjoy any position of prominepce and honour in the Srauta ntual He is either drien back to his hone'as in the Agnihotra, 13 or only the remanants of oblations are assigned to him 15 As agaust thus, Rudra plays a particularis important role in certain grhya or popular rites such as the Sulagara lot the Aśraydi, and the Prstakā Thus, while Rodra is generally excluded from the homas offered in buerarchical ntual, he is very positively represented as being entitled to the balis offered in folk-cult ntes. 
On account of all such features Rudra stands out almost segregated from the federality of Vedic gods 175 Notsithstand ing this the Veda cannot be said to exhibit any open opposition

Attention may now be drawn to certain other characteristics of the Vedic Rudra In the Rgieda, Rudra is closely associated with Maruts It would, however, seem that the hosts of Rudra were originally called Rudras, that, when Rudra was admitted into the Vedic pantheon munly as god of death, he was deli berately brought into relationship with Maruts who had onigl pally been independent divinities and were regarded as the hosts of the spirits of the dead, and that this relationship of Rudra with Maruts, which was frankly tendentious, proved to be but short lived Rudra's affinity with Agni, on the other hand, is perhaps more constant and enduring Indeed, in some passages, Rudra seems to have been actually identified with Ago (II I 6, AV VII 87 1, TS V 4 3 1) But this is obviously just incidental and not essential The word rudra was primarily used as ad epithet of Agni, but later it tended to be interpreted as another nane of Agni It is also natural that the terrific form (ghorā tanah) of Agni should be referred to as rudra (TS 11 2 2 3) The legend that on a certain occasion, Agni wept and was, therefore, called Rudra (TS II 2 10)167 is pateptly an afterthought On the contrary, it is not improbable that, since, on account of his peculiar character and associations, Rudra's name was taboo among the Vedic poet priests, he was often represented as conceal ing under the names of Agn, 158 And, if Rudra was really identi cal with Agon, how could one explain Rudra's peculiar position in the hieratic Vedic ritual 2169 As against this, the points of simila.

But it is Rodra's unmistakable connection with certain reli gods cults of ancient times which thrors a very suggestite Light on the essental personality and character of that god The Kesin hymn (X 136), for instance, relates to the orgastic cult of the Munis who are said to have mora loog hair, indulged in a sort of ecstasy-producing potion, and attained certain miraculous powers which were comparable to those attained through Yoga, aod, in that hymn, Rudra is iepresented almost as the leader of that calt (X. 136 7) The cult of the Brabmacirns 15 glorified in AV XI 55 These Brahmacãrins practised sesere penance and thereby became endoved with peculiar virile powers which enabled them to undertake creo cosmic activities The description of the Brahmacānın tends to remaid oge of Vedic Radra Similar is the Case of the Vratyas (AV XV who had dexeloped their own distinctive religious ideology, social order, and general way of life.

The most common theory regarding the character of Rudra is that he is the roaring storm god who is both frightful and bene. ficent RGB has endorsed this theory without any discussion, but specifying that Rudra represented the destructive agency of light. Ding According to him, the simple folk working in the field saw in the black cloud tinged red by the soft glow of the lightning god Rudra with his blue neck and red complexion 102 In the present context, it is neither possible nor necessary to subject this theory to any critical examination Suffice it to say with OLDENBERG that, in the Vedic descriptions of Rudra, lightings do not flash, rains do not pour down, winds do not rush forth 165 Therefore, at least in the consciousness of the Vedic poets, Rudra was not a god of tempest 164 Moreover that theory miserably fails to explain, rationally and satisfactorily, the complex personality of Rudra with its distinctive and exclusive features as set forth above As for Rudra's identification with Agni, it has already been shown to be just incidental and not essential 165 According to OLDEN BERG,168 who considers Rudra's connection with mountains and forests to be far more vital and essential than that with storm and lightaing, characterises that god as the Old Man of the Mountains, a demon of disease coming from forest and mountain, like Mars Silvanus But while emphasizing one significant aspect of Rudra's character, 167 OLDENBERG has completely ignored other equally or

even more important aspects AREVANTS, like OLDENBERG, rejects the theory that Rudra is the god of thunderstorm or that he personifies any other phenomenon of oature According to him, Rudra is an unheareply product of lover mythology, an earthly, depopic, fearfol god who has ongnated from the primi tire concepts of death and its fears He further asserts that Rgredic Rudra represents an artificial side growth of the contr nuous line of development from the orginal primite pon-Vedic Rodra to the later Vedic Rudra, and then to the epic Susa 
There is no doubt that in the Vedic literature, particularly in the RF, greater emphasis is put on Rudra's association trith death and its horror than on any other aspects of his compler persona uty and character Rudra s sajakas (II 33 10) are the death bnoging arrows shot by Rudra, the sender of disease and death.

ritual in which Rudra figures confirm his character as god of death in the Sikamedha, for instance, there is a funeral cere mony which includes an offering to Rudra Incidentally it may be pointed out here that according to the primitive belief, the god of death and his hosts also bestowed fertility on land, animals, and human beings It also needs to be added that, since the entire concept relating to Rudra was foreign to the Vedic ideology, the character of that god was not clearly defined in the Veda, and the emphasis often shifted from one aspect of his character to another "That is why Rudra cannot be said to have been re presented in the Veda as god of death either exclusively or consistently 
The following points will now have been clear from the fore going discussion (1) that Rudra was essentially different from the normal hieratic Vedic gods, (2) that he belonged to a milieu which was foreign to the Vedic poet priests, (3) that the Vedic poet-priests must have accommodated him in their religious complex under the pressure of circumstances, and, therefore, reluctantly and almost under protest, (4) that, while doing so, they either suppressed or transformed many of that god's essential traits, and (5) that, as a result of this, only one aspect of Rudra's original complex character, namely, that of the god of death came to be generally emphasized in the Vedic literature One does, however, get a few glimpses of Rudra's original complex character from various stray references to that god in the Veda Indeed, some indications are avajlable in the Vedic literature itselt of the rise of Rudra, in the form of Rudra-Siva, to the position of supreme godhead For instance, various references 10 AV XV suggest Rudra's correspondence with Ckavratya (XV 1) and with Bhava, Sarva, Pasupati, Ugra Deva, Mahadeva, and ifāna (XV 5) Aod, already jo the Mauryani-Samhita II 9 1, Rudra is identified with Purusa and Mabadeva 
There is sufficient evidence to justify the assumption that Rudra is but the Vedic version of a well established pre-Vedic non Aryan popular god The religious cult centering round this proto Indian god had spread far and wide-different aspects of

The proto-Indian god was celebrated as 'red god' in some circles, particularly among the proto Dravidians They called him by the name Sıva (which proto-Dravidian word means the * red one'), because they worshipped him, among other things, by pouring over (Tamil pūcu from which the word pūjá is derived) his icon the blood of the animal, more particularly the buffalo (or, in some cases, even the human being ), which was offered to him, and, as a consequence of this, the god actually looked red Vedic Rudra has borrowed not only the name but also some characteristics of the red god The word, rudra, has to be derived from a hypothetical lost root, rud, which must have meant to be ruddy or red 170 Thus, Rudra, like proto-Dravidian Śiva, also means the red god As pointed out earlier, Rudra is actually associated with the red colour in a variety of ways He is des cribed as being arusa (1 114 5), babhru (II 33 5), tâmra, aruna, vilohuta, nilalohita ( 7S IV 51, VS 16 6,7) Like the proto Indian Sıva, Rudra also is offered Bali (and not homa) as in the Sūlagava rite Rudra's fondness for blood is frequently referred to The TS (II 1 7 lff ), for instance, narrates the legend of vasathāra breaking open the head of gayatri On that occasion, we are told, the gods took the various juices issuing out of that head But Rudra chose only the blood The Āpss (X 13 11 ) seems to refer to blood as Rudra's water in the Afva medha, the blood of the horse is assigned to Rudra (TS I 4 36), and, according to the Satapatha Brāhmana (V 3 1 10), Rudra longs for the cows slaughtered in the royal palace in the Rājasuya Red colour is also suggestive of death magic, evil omen, swear ang, cursiog, misfortune, etc And it can be shown that both proto-Dravidian Siva and Vedic Rudra were intimately conoccted with these concepts implied by the red colour

Thus Rudra is not a storm-god as RGB supposes, but re presents just the Vedic version of the proto Indian Sıva-Pasupati It is to this latter god, and not to Vedic Rudra (as RGB says ), that the origin of Saivism is to be traced back Indeed, most of the essential features of Saivism are anticipated by the proto Indian religion of Siva-Pasupati and consequently by the religious complex pertaining to Vedic Rudra 184

The Sretāšratara-Upanısad ( Ś0) represents a very significant landmark in the history of Salysm. That Uparusad is in respect of Saivism what the Bhagaradgilā is in respect of Vasudeviso Krsoaism There is, honeter, no doubt that the Bhagaradzilā is chronologically later than the SƯ It can, indeed, be shown that many concepts occurring in the SU bave been further developed in the Bhagavadgita 1* The SŲ (V2) mentions Kapila, the founder of the Sankhya system, 1% who may be taken to have belonged to the 6th ceptory BC That would fix the termous ante quem son for the ongin of that t'panisad Further, from the grammatical poigt of view, that l'penisad is clearly post Pannian 200 The SV may accordiogly be assigned to about the end of the 5th century B C Conceptually, the ŚU may be placed between the Katha-Up and the Bhagavadgitā 401 
ŚU is essentially monotheistic in character Eko derah-01 - these words may, indeed, be said to be the key-nords of this philosophical tract.

Rodra being thus represented in the SU as the Supreme Being, it is difficult to agree with RGB's observation that this Upanisad “does not 3ppear to be composed in a sectarian spirit” *06 Again, Rudra in the SU is not, as RGB seems to suggest, *o; the result of the personalisation of the impersonal Brahm. There are clear indications in the Upan sad that the God is actually superior to Brahmad - he is brahmajoni (V 6) and brahnapara (JII 7) It is true that Samkhya (VI 13), Yoga (VI 13), and Vedānta (VI 22 )-all these three are men tioned by name in the SU, but the teachings of that Upanı sad are basically Sāmkhya-Yoga oriented,208 the Vedāntic elements 10

The privilege of this favour of Sıva was shared also by Nara who was born of Nārāyana's tapas Nārāyana and Nara, who, in the epoch of the MBh, incarnated themselves as Krsna and Arjuna respectively, continued to enjoy that favour of Siva (Drona 172) A similar explanation was given by Vyāsa in another context While Arjupa was routing the Kaurava forces, he saw that a resplendent person bearing Sūla was actually doing so for him When he reported this to Vyāsa, the latter told him that it was Siva who had been constantly guarding him throughout the war Vyāsa then praised Siva with what is referred to as a caturvidha stotra (Drona 173) 818 Verily, as described in the Aranyaka parvan (38-41), Arjuna had obtained his strongest weapon, namely, the Pasupata-astra, from Sıva himself whom Arjupa had propitiated through tapas and who, in the guise of a Kırāta, had subsequently put to test Arjuna's fortitude and valour '18 
In the first episode mentioned above, a bint was incidentally given by Vyāsa that Asvatthāman also was in a way cherished by Siva (Drona 172 82) This very point seems to have been further developed in the Sauptika-parvan (6-7) When, after having been temporarily dissuaded from his proposed nocturnal raid, Aśvattbāman returned to his camp, he saw a gigantic apparition blocking bis way He attacked that phantom with all his might, but to no avail He suspected that the phantom was born from his own evil 10clinations, he, therefore surrendered to Śiva, sang him a hymn of praise, and then actually prepared to offer himself as an oblation to the God Śiva was thereby propi tiated He then told Asvatthāman of the rigorous austerities which Krsna had practised for the sake of his favour and declared that no one was more beloved to him than Krsna (Sauptika 7 61 tasmad istatamah krsnăd anyo mama na vidyate)Further, in the same parvan, it is narrated that Yudhisthira asked Krsna how Asvatthāman had, single handed, dared perpetrate the atrocity

doring the night and that Krsza replied that it was all due to the credulous favour of Sira. Krsna further took that opportunity to expatrate on Siva's greatness Brahmā, he continued to tell Yodhisthura, implored Siva to create the world and procreate the boman race Siva agreed and undertook severe penance for that purpose Having waited for the God for a long time, Brahma decided to bring about creation through another agency Siva returned from his penance and san that the world had already been created Greatly enraged, he cut off his generative organ and voleatly planted it upon the earth for, he thought, it was no longer needed Krsna also told Yudhisthira of the sacrifice of the gods in whicb no portion was offered to Siva 3d which, there fore, Sira had rujhlessly exterminated (Sauptika 17-18) 
But Sra's unquestioned supremacy is perhaps best illustrated by the Krsna-Upamanyu episode described in the Apusīsana paryan (14-18) Jāmburati desired a son from Krsaa Haying Lnown that Rukmini had given birth to valant sons as the result of Krsna's worstip of Siya, she importuned Krsna again to worship that God for her sale Krsna went to the Himālaya moontam for pedance and casually came to the bermutage of Upamanyu Upamanyu asked Kro3 to practise penance there only, for, Sıra hipself was residing there Upamanya then told Kista bow he bad practised pena gce jn order to propitiate Sna, how he had refased to accept boons from any god other than Sna, and how, in the end, Siva had manifested himself before him and had fulfilled all his desires (14) Krsm too, is then said to have propitiated Siva through penance and to have there by obtained the desired boons (15-16) This narrative is followed by the Śrra-astottarasahasrurāma-stotra (17) and the eulogy of that Stotra by different sages (18) In another context, on hayog beep asked by Yudhisthira shat specific knowledge he had obtained from Dunisas, **Krsta responded by glonfying the supreme greatness of Rudra-Siva (Aouxısana 145) and by explaining the significance of the great god s various n3mes, such

as, Maheśvara, Rudra, Mahadeva, Siva, Sthānu, Pasupati, etc (Anusasana 146 ) It is noteworthy that, in both these cases, a special mention is made of the Satarudrija (Anusasana 145 4, 146 23 ) 
Various occasions have been manoeuvred by the redactor of the MBh to introduce - appositely or otherwise - hymns of praise of Siva Some of the more important of these Sivastutis are by Krsna in Drona 172, by Vyása in Drona 173, by the gods and the Brahmarsis on the eve of the destruction of Tripura (Kamna 24 ), by Aśvatthāman in Sauptika 7, by Upamanyu in Anušāsana 14, by Krsna in Anušāsana 15, and the Śna-asfotiarasahasra nāma stotra ( Aaušāsana 17) 1 It may also be mentioned that many tirthas spread over different regions of the country are described in the epic as having been sanctified by association with Śiva, in one form or another - a fact that would indicate the wide sphere of the influence of the Siva religion 
Attention may now be drawn to some characteristic features of the Sıva religion which become evident from the many allusions to Śiva occurring in the epic In the epic Śiva-religion, greater importance is attached to tapas than to Bhaktı or any other form of worship And this is in full conformity with the proto-Indian character of that religion Whoever seeks to propitiate Siva practises penance-for instance, Nārāyana, Upamanyu, and Kysna did so Even Siva, who is naturally enough represented as the supreme god, himself takes to tapas whenever he wants to accomplish something That phallus worship is an integral part of the Siva-religion is also frequently emphasized in the epic Indeed, Upamanyu argues that Siva is the greatest of the gods because it is only his linga - and of no one else – that is wor shipped by gods (Anušásana 14 100-102 na suśruma yad anyasya lingam ably arcyate surash) The suggestion that linga bere means merely a concrete symbol or an indicatory mark

would not carry conviction For, the symbols of even other gods are seen to be actually worshipped. But it is only in the case of Sıva that his generative organ is worshipped. That linga, in the context of Siva, invariably signifies the generative organ is confirmed by the legend carrated by Krsna to Yudhin sthira regarding Siva having cut off his linga when he discovered that it was no longer needed since the process of creation had already been accomplished (Saoptika 17 24 ) Again, the NB is definitely familiar with the circumstance that Siva is worshipped in two different forms - in the human form and in the form of linga (Drona 173 94 pūjayed rigraham jas tu lingam tā 'pr samarcajet, also Anusāsana 146 15-17) 
One is often remuaded of Siva's ancient character as the god of fertility 10 respect of wan, animal, and land, when one reads in the cpic, got infrequently, of persons propitiating Rudra-siva for the sake of progeny (cf Acusāsana. 14–16). The almost unbroken contingity of the Siva-religion from the proto-Indian penod to the epic-paurānic penod is further evidenced, among other things, by Siva appearing as a Kırāta ( Āranyaka 38-41 ) or as a Purusa bearing süla (Droga. 173) and by his being denied a sbare in the sacrifice (Sauptikz. 18, Shoti 274) * Similarly, some of the ideological features of Saivism which were first introduced in the SU are seen to bave been delileated also in the epic - such as, for instance, its Sámkhya-Yoga onentation o13 Supreme godhead of Siva, which is frequently emphasized in the epic, may also be mentioned in this very context. As for this last, however, it needs to be pointed out that, though Nārāyana. Krsna is usually represented as a protege of Siva, the redactor of the epic, presumably with a view to stressing the Vasava genesis of the epic, has introduced some episodes wherein Rudra-Siva u

RGB's treatment of phallus-worship is rather inadequate And this is quite understandable, for, he did not have before him the considerable archaeological material which has become available in recent times the tradition of phallus-worship in India is, indeed, very ancient It has been suggested that the Neolithic people in South India were primarily worshippers of Iinga Evidence is produced in this connection of the Kapagallu hill in Bellary district, where one sees a linga together with a bull in a crouching position 228 Be that as it may, there is certainly far more definite and far more profuse evidence regard ing phallus worship which has been upearthed in the Indus

valey The conical terracotta objects with rounded tops and the ringstones discovered in the Indus valley are, without doubt, the symbols of linga and joni respectively We have already seen that the chief god of the lodus valley people was the 1thyphallıc Yogišvara Pasupati ( who has been depicted on the Mohenjodaro seal and who is identical with the proto-Dravidian god Siva ) 229 The ithyphallicism of the Mohenjodaro figure and the large number of linga-joni-like objects discovered in Indus valley may be presumed to have been closely related to each other-venly, they have to be regarded as denoting the two aspects of the phallic worship which was an integral part of the proto Indian Siva-religion It is not uplikely that the worship of the phallus, which, as evidenced by its almost universal dissemina tion, must have been a naturaf development in the history of human culture, had grown in India independently in the boary past,230 and that it came to be associated with the religion of the shyphallic god only at some later dare Whatever that may have been, one thing seems to be quite certam, namely, that, in the proto-Indian religion of the Indus valley penod, the two had already become organically condected with cach other It is believed that an obloog terracotta sealing discovered in the Indus valley actually shows the figure of Siva with his three symbols, namely, the bull, the tndent, and the phallus 231 We may, therefore, assume that in the proto-Indian Siva-religion the god was worshipped both in the anthropomorphic ithyphallic form and in the form of a separate linga Tus practice of the worship of Siva has continued even in historical times,233 though

As pballus-worship was supposed to have been unknown to the Veda, it was suggested that it had originated among the Dravidian races295 or among the Western nations and even among the Greeks 231 For one thing, it is not correct to say that phallus worship was unknown to the Vedic poet-priests, indeed, they knew it and abhorred it as is indicated by their attitude towards the $1śnaderas And, secondly, in view of its universal diffusion in very ancient times, the question regardiog its origin is rendered almost irrelevant 235 
There has beeo a tendency among Indian scholars - a ten. dency which is perhaps quite natural - to reject the assumption that the linga is a phallic emblem It is suggested, for instance, that the idea of the Imga originated out of ad attempt to express the inexpressible, to make Siva perceptible to the mental cye 236 The linga is Maheśvara himself, and not merely the emblem of his membrum virile (lingam saksan mahesarah) 217 It was also claimed that the linga signified a protest against idolatry Accordiog to another interpretation, the Siva-linga 1s the closest possible approximation to the cosmic Purusa - the hemispherical top of the linga consists of thousands of heads ( sahasrasirsan), each of the size of a point The linga represents the double idea of the "formless" and the "all-formed” Siva 20

But the more common idea which is presumed to underue the linga is that of the axis mundi (hich is also implied by the Atharvavedic Skambha and the Buddhist stūpa) Recourse is also taken in this condection to the Purídic account of the quarrel for precedence between Brahma and Visou and the appearance before them of Siva in the form of a blazing column the ends of which the two gods were asked to find but which, to their chagrin, they could not.

The close relationship between the ithyphallic god and the linga-Joni-bile objects, which is clearly implied in the Indus valley religion should, indeed, put an end to all such speculations

As for the literary evidence in this connection, reference may be made to the description of Rudra-Śıya in the SU as the god, wbo, being one, rules over every single jom (V 2 Jo yonim Jonim adhitisthaty ekah), or as a person who is of the measure of a thumb244 (III 13 angusthamátrah purusah, also V 8), to Upamanyu's unequivocal assertion ( mentioned above) that Siva was the greatest of all gods because it was only his hinga which was worshipped, 245 and to the Purānic account that the sages of the Pine Forest accusing Siva of seducing their wives in disguise, cursed him that, as the result of the curse, the generative organ of Sıva dropped down, and that Śiva, revealing himself to them, taught them, to worship his fallen linga 246 It may, however, be added that, in the Purānas as also elsewhere, we do come across passages wherein attempts are pude to foist some mystic or philosophical meaning on the concept of linga All such attempts have proved to be manifestly artificial and unconvincing We

The Ford ásahsülika is not to be understood in the uteral sense, but only in the metaphorical sense It denotes a person who takes recourse to harsh measures in order to accomplish some work which can be accomplished by milder methods The contest seems to suggest that the ĀJahulika was a kind of extortionist false ascetic, like the dandajinila, but his correction with the Siva-religion, if any, is not clear 
RGB's exploitation of the epigraphic coaterial for the recon struction of the history of Saivism is, as usual, perfect The Qumismatic evidence for the prevalence of the Sıva religion, particularly in the first couple of centuries before and after Christ, is also not inconsiderable It is not northy that most of thus evidence is densed from porth-western India.

The Guptas, who came to real power in the first decades of the fourth century AD, exhibited a remarkable catholic spirit in the matter of religion Epigraphic and numismatic evidence indicates that most of the Gupta sovereigns were devout Vaisnavas or Bhāgsvatas,26) but there is also evidence to show that they and their ministers respected and patronised Saivism without any inhibition 206 The prevalence of Śatvism in northern India 10 the post Gupta period may very well be inferred from the state ments of Hieun-Tsang (second decade of the seventh century) referred to by ROB 207 The Chinese pilgrim, who mentions the Pāsupatas as many as twelve times, says that there were temples of Maheśvara at which the Pāśupatas worshipped, in one or two of them they even resided And, at Varanası, Hieun-Tsang fovod about ten thousand sectaries who honoured Maheśvara, besmeared their bodies with ashes, went oaked, and tied their bair in knots It may be added that, when Hieun-Tsang travelled 10 India, Buddhism was rapidly disappearing from the south, while Śaivism, and especially Jainism, were becoming the popular faiths in that region

Sailism in south India developed in two directions_āgamic apd of Bhakti, primanly in the latter direction And this brogs us to the three stalwarts of this Bhaktı movement, the famous Tēvāram Trio According to the generally accepted tradition, the first two of the Terāram Trio, namely, Tirunavukkarasar (Appar) aod Tvajñānasambandar were contemporaneous (Appar being the older of the two) and lived during the reign of Pallava king Mahendravarman (610-630 A D ), while the third, namely, Sundarar, lived during the reigo of Pallava king Narasimhasarman Il Rājasimha (690-728 A D) Though bom in an orthodox Saiva Vellila family, Appar nas attracted to Jainism in his early ufe and joined the monastery at Fatalıputra (pear Cuddalore in South Arcot) as a monk.

converting Mahendravarman (who had been a confirmed Jaipa) to Saivism He thus initiated, as it were, a glorious epoch for the Siva-leligion in south India - an epoch which lasted for nearly the next four centuries through the regimes of the Pallavas, the Pandyas, and the Colas 268 Most of the religious activity was centred round the many Śiva temples, big and small, and "the ninth century saw the establishment of the first monasteries which were to find the Saivite regions of the South particularly favourable to their development ”.69 
A brief reference may be made in this very context to the expansion of Saivism outside India It is well known that the first centuries A D saw brisk maritime and commercial activity on the part of the Indians, mostly from southern and south eastern India, and in some cases also from Gujarat, in South-East Asia and particularly in the Indonesian Archipelago (Dvipāntara), which resulted in the foundation of Hindu or Hinduistic kingdoms there Inscriptions from that region, dating from the 5th century AD, many of which employ a script similar to the one used in Coro. mandel under the Pallavas, show that Sanskrit was used for official and religious purposes They also reflect the deep penetration in that region of Hindu religion and Dharmaśāstra However, the few sources that have become available for the first two or three centuries, that is from the 5th to the 7th century, relate mainly to the powerful Sumatran kingdom Śrivijaya which was an important ceptre of Buddhism It is only the inscriptions belonging to the eighth, and more particularly to the ninth, century that brog to light the Siva-dominated religious scene in Java 270 Scholars have

fact that Siva and Surya are identified with – indeed, are merged into each other even in some early Purānas 
In connection with the saivism in the Indonesian Archipe lago, a special mention needs to be made of the concept of Bhattāra Guru The concept is evidently the result of the tendency to glorify and deify the Guru or the preceptor In the Saiva tradition, the Guru is believed to be infused with the spirit of $12-1ndeed, he is Sita himself 274 Agastya also plays a significant role in the Indonesian Saivism He is mentioned in the oldest East Javanese tradition ( 760 AD ), and the work entitled Agasty aparia (11th century) refers to Bhakti for Siva 
In Cambodia, the medieval princes seem to have been devout worshippers of Sıva For instance, the Han Chey inscription of Bhava varman, who conquered Fu-nan (6th century A, D ), opens with a mangala dedicated to Śiva Similarly, Jayavarman II of the early 9th century AD, is said to have introduced a new type of Tantric ritual for the worship of Devarāja (represented by a Siva linga) who came to be recognised as the tutelary deity of Kambuja from that time onwards 275 
In Campā, king Bhadravarman is described in the inscription of the early fifth century AD as having dedicated a temple to Sıva at Mi son under the pame Bhadreśvarasyāmia There is sufficient evidence to show that Siva was worshipped in Campi both in the anthropomorphic and the linga forms Indeed, most of the kings of that country are known to have occupied then selves with the installation and consecration of Siva lingas Reference may also be made here to the Wat Phu hill or the Lingaparvata in Laos where a temple of Śiva had been constructed In Malaysia, on the right bank of the river Bujang, there existed a Pallava type Salva sbrine belonging to the sixth or the seventh century AD Inscriptions on jūpas of the late fourth century

The Vayusamhită speaks of two classes of the Saiva Agamas (1) srauta or Vedic which are of innumerable kinds and (2) syatantra or non-Vedic ( Siddhāpta ) which are of 10 or 18 kinds and are believed to have been composed by Śiva himself The Saiva Āgamas mention twenty-eight Yogācāryas of Saivism, from Sveta to Lakulisa, while Gunaratna enumerates eighteen Acāryas from Lakulīsa to Vidyāguru 2*** 
Lakulisa, who, according to RGB, was a direct pupil of Srikantha (mentioned in the Mahabharata) and a contemporary of Patañjalı,279 is believed to have composed the Påśupatasūtras (consisting of five adhyājas), and the seventeenth Ācārya, Rasi kara, to have written a commentary on that work known as the Pañcadhyāyībhâsya or the Pancārthabhâsya The Pasupata wor. ship consisted of some abnormal practices hasıla gira-nrita dumdumkāra-namaskāra japa-upahārena upatisthet 280 The Laku lisa-cult spread widely and quickly - Lakulisa himself having come to be regarded as representing the emanated anthropomor phised concept of the potent cosmic role of Śiva81 and several Lakuliba temples having been constructed

The Siva-religion sponsored by the Purīgas is usually known as the Siddhanta-mārga Its principal tenet is Bhakti for Siya, and its ritual practices also are fairly sobet The followers of this school are the ordinary Saixa Bat the name Siddhanta is more commonly given to the Āganic Saiva doctrine of south Todia and sometimes also to what may be called the Vedāntic Saiva doctrine of Kashmir 
There is some uncertainty about the schools of Saiyim 10 Kashmir and their literature RGB says that “the Kashmir Saiyism has two branches, the Spanda sastra and the Pratyabhalástra.74 The authorship of the first is attributed to Vasogupta and his pupil Kallata, while the founder of the Pratyabhima school is said to be Somānanda, the author of the Siradrst $ Honeter, in the introduction to his edition of the smadrs, Madhusudan

KAUL SASTRI characterises Somānanda as the follower of the Tryambaka school of the Kashmir Saivism It is pointed out that Siva himself, in the form of Srikantha, imparted this doctrine to Durvāsas who, in his turn, passed it on to Tryambakāditya It was Tryambakāditya, who, in course of time, settled jp Kashmir and formalised these teachings, which later came to be known after him. Somāpanda, the author of the Snadrsti, was the twentieth in the line of teachers from Tryambakāditya It is further suggested that Kashmir Saivism comprises three schools - Tryambaka (which is very much older than the other two), Spanda (which is derived from the Spandasūtra and the Spanda kārıkā ), and Pratyabhijñā which is taught in the Śrvasütras - and is, therefore, called Trika 287 Toçidentally, RGB does not mention the Spandasūira at all, there is also the tradition that the names Spandasūtra aod Spandakarikā denote one and the same work, but Ksemarāja (11th century AD), in his Śnasūtra vimarsini, specifically mentions both the Sutra and the Karikā With Utpala (author of the Tharapratyabhijñākārikā, the Kvara. siddhi, etc), Laksanagupta, and Abhinavagupta (author of the Pratyabhijñāvmarśmi the Tantraloka epitomising the 64 non dualistic Tantras, the Paramarthasāra, etc ), Ksemarāja, who was a pupil and cousin of Abbioavagupta and who wrote, besides the Śnasūtravmaršini, works like the Pratyabhiynahrdaja, the Spanda nirna) a, and the Uddy otas, belonged to a distinguished 110e of teachers of the Kashmir Saivison 
It has already been pointed out that Saivism of south India developed in two main directions - of Bhaktı and of Siddhānta The Saiva Sidabāota of the South arose independently and may be said to have supplemented the devotional effusions of the Saiva saints with doctrinal reinforcement It is, for instance, said that in the Tirunāšagam of Mānikka Vasagar (10th-11th century AD) which together with the Tcıāram of the Trio

mentioned above, is regarded as constituting the Tamil Veda, the doctrines of the Saiva Siddhanta have fused into the passionate experience in the beart of a Sivabhakta. Actually, however, in that poem the element of Bhakti is far more dominating than that of Siddhanta “Scarcely ever", writes POPE about the Tirurāśagam,z'1 " has the longing of the human soul for purity and peace and divine fellowship found worthier expression " The Sana Siddhānta was originally expounded in the eighteen Agamas to which were added, in course of time, the ten Yamalas and a number of Upīgamas This doctrine was later systematized by Maykaddar Karulturai ( 13th century A. D) in his Sirajtiāna. bodham ard by his popil Arulapanti Sivācārya in his Srajñāna. siddhn ár Nay kandar, who is glorified as the father of Tamil Saivism, said to have belonged to the Golaki-Laksādhyāyı school of Saiyism This school seems to have been an offshoot of the Mattamayūra sect, which was originally patronised by the Kalacũri-Cedi princes of Central fodia and a bich entered into the Tamil country in the 10th century A.D 
Besides the Sanskrit Sarva Siddhanta and the Tamil Saiyism there has yet another school of Aganic Saivism in the South, pamely, that of the Viraśarvas or the Lingayatas Actually, the word lingājata does not occur in any extant traditional Sanskrit work on the Virensa religion except the Pirasatrācārapradipikā where it occurs as lingāzita The attempt to explain grammatically the word lingayata as a Sanskrit word is not conyincing 259 It is more ukely that the word is a Kaprada radbhara form of Sanskrit lingurantah** The term Viraana is more extensive and covers both the Arâdbyas (abo continue to adhere to some Brahmanic samskāras aod practices) and the Lingīyatas (who represent a kind of resolt against the Brahmatic orthodots) 21 To the basic

Virašaiva doctrines of sakin asistādi aita (which is generally derived from the Kashmir sıvádyarta ),""* sarsthala (six steps to mukti ),203 and astăvarana (eightfold protective shield against the evils of maya), the Lingāyatas may be said to have added their specific practices of pañcācāra (fivefold code of life) and trisasısıla (sixty three rules of daily conduct ) 04 A mention may be made at this stage of the Sıvānubhavamantapa - the religious assembly which is said to have been organized by Basava396 and to have been presided over by Allama Prabhu It is believed that Virasaivism, particularly its satsthala doctrine, received its final form through the discussions of the Saranas 10 this gathering It was again the Sivānubhavamantapa which proved to be the fountain head of the remarkable Vacana literature 
Attention may now be drawn to some distinctive features of Saivism It may be recalled that Vasudevism-Krsnaism Origigated from and centred round a human hero who came to be deified 10 course of time One of the purposes of the Avatāra-theory seems to have been to provide a kind of rationalisation, and also substantiation - for such godship of a buman being Siva, on the other hand, has been conceived as a god from the very beginning And moreover he is conceived essentially as an earthly god - as a god who, being ever present, is intrinsically interested and ja volved in the affairs of man Naturally, therefore, Saivism does pot countenance any Avatāras of Sıva The tradition that, in each Kalpa, Sıva appears along with his four disciples is obviously

upsurge of a kind of cosmic energy and life-force Through his asceticism, Siva is enabled to keep that creative energy or life-force under control Siva personifies the ideal which rejects both the licentious indulgence and the stifling continence and which pro motes the controlled release of power Tapas and Kāna may be diametrically opposed, but they are by no means mutually exclusive 802 Indeed, both are regarded as being of the nature of fire or heat These two polar opposites, namely, asceticism and sexuality, are believed to lead to the same condition, namely free dom from contingency It is wrong to bifurcate the personality of Śıya and argue that eroticism belongs to the Siva of the Tantras and asceticism to the Brahmanic SivaThis apparent coincidentia oppositorunt - this concept of the erotic ascetic – is to be understood as the expression of the essential polarity of one single integrated whole Sıva comprehends within himself, superbly balanced, the supreme aloofness and contemplativeness of Tapas as well as the hectic fervour and involvement of Kāma Todeed, all opposites are beautifully reconciled in his personality and character 803 
The inadequate understanding and appreciation of the essen tially integrated character of Siva and the consequent emphasis on one or another aspect of his superficially multiple nature have given rise to an intriguing varicty of Saiya sects--the Kāpālkas with their bloody and revolting aghora practices, the Vāmācāra Tāntrikas with their orgiastic rites, the ecstatic Pasupatas, the mystic Saiva-Siddhāntins of Kashmir, the aggressive Viraśarvas, and the saintly Saiva Bhaktas of south ladia about whose fine devotional poems it is said tbat jo them is to be found the frank est and the profoundest delineation of the individual religious life with its struggles and dejections, its hopes and fears, its con

It is perhaps on account of its erotic mysticism that we see in Saiyisin a comparatively heavy preponderance of the female divity As indicated above, tendencies are evident even 10 the proto-Indian Siva-religion towards the worship of the male and the female aspects of divinity in a joint dirige sovereignty Io classical Saryum, Sakti, the metaphysically denixed cosmic potence of Siva, was granted an independent status and a separate personality lodeed, in the cosmogony of the Tantras, the role of the creator actually belongs to ber—Siva being re presented as a mere inmobile spectator 45 But, here too, in conformity with the usual tendency of Saivism, the two poles, panely, the male and the female aspects of divinity, are re-onited, through a balanced integration, to form the magnificent godhead of Ardhanarbiara.*** Kalidasa has very poetically brought out the paradox of Siva, who, being ever united with bus consort, still is the foremost among the all-abpuring ascetics *7 It is further paradoxical, in a sense, that the lord of the Yogins and the ascetics should have been regarded as the ongrator and the

presiding deity of drama and dance 304 But, obviously, this idea has its origin in the cosmic dance of Natarāja Siva Mention may be incidentally made in this very context of the tradition that the first fourteen sūtras of Panini's grammar, which form the basis of a part of his terminology, were revealed to him by Siva himself 800 
Having originated as a religion of the people (rather than of hieratic circles) Saivism has been more or less non confor mist in character in the sense that it generally did not make much of the traditional Varnāśramadharma It also promoted equality of sex Some of the Saiva sects, like the Lingāyatas, even went to the extent of denouncing sedaprāmiānja, Brahma. nic orthodoxy, image-worship, and the doctrine of transmigration 
They removed the bar to widow remarriage and strongly protested against child-marriage 
There is no doubt that saivism is more ancient than Vaisnayism, but the latter is said to be more expansive, more attractive, and more favourable to community of worship and religious sentiment $10 Both Saivism and Vaisnavism sponsor a personal monotheism (as against the earlier pantheism ), but ritual practices are perhaps more in evidence in Saivism than in Vaisnayısm While Saivism regards the universe as the source of pain and misery - as the pāśa of the pašu - apd, therefore, as worthy of being repudiated, Vaisnavism looks upon it as an evi dence of the lord s omnipotence and, therefore as worthy of being cherished But it may not be valid to assert that, on account of this attitude of Vaisnavismo towards the universe, its contributions to arts and literature have been richer and more profuse than those

of Sarvism 371 Saivism is krond to have dominated the religious scene till the 11th century AD, but thereafter Vaisnavist, which had been infused with new life in respect of both phuosophy and devotionalısma by the Ācāryas beginning with Rāmīnuja, started to look up And, though, today, Sauvism may reckon more sanctuaries, it is Vaisnavism which is generally in ascendancy Whatever that may be, perhaps the greatest glory of the Sıva religion is that it can justifiably boast of the longest continuous and living tradition among the religions of the civilised world. 
POSTSCRIPT 
(a) Spread of l'aisnajism outside India In South-east Asia, Yaisdavism does not seem to have prevailed to the same extent as Saivism, in the carly period of Indian contacts The religion centering round Visou is no doubt mentioned in some inscriptions of the tenth century AD, bet the general impression which one gets is that Vaista151 bad not become a religious sect of the people On the other hand, in the subsequent period, many rulers in Indonesia, particularly those belonging to the eleventh and the twelfth centuries Ike Erlanga ( 1019-1042 A D) of Java, for instance, were supposed to be aratāras of Visou Literary works like the Arjunavnáha (before 1035 A D ) and the Bharatayuddha ( 1157 A D ) also evicce the growing interest, in that region, 10 the epic and post-epic Krsnaite themes (a Bali, besides the normal pūjā of the Sun Brāhmadas, there had been in vogue also the puja-h satrija which was rather Vaisnava in character and which was primarily intended for the Ksatriyas

dedicated to Visnu Io Campā, an inscription discovered in Duong-Mong mentions the construction of a temple for Visny Purusottama Further, Visnu is depicted in the ananiasāyın posture on a pedestal of a M1-son temple in the region of Maura-Kaman in Borneo, where three jūpa-inscriptions of Mula varman have been found, there was also discovered the figure of a standing four-armed Visnu attached to a pendant Incidentally, Visnu is regarded as a protector god - even as the protector of the faith of the Buddha --18 Ceylon, and figures in many Ceylonese legends 
As for the spread of the Vaisgava tradition in Central Asia, evidence is, first of all, produced of Zenob's story, which, how ever, is of doubtful validity The story speaks of the two Indian princes, Gisane (Kısane) and Demeter, who fled westward with their clan and found shelter with Valarasbak or Valarsaces, the first Arsacıd monarch of Armenia (cn 149–127 B C) It is suggested that Kisane and Demeter stand for Krsna and Baladeva, and that therr flight to Armenia is reminiscent of Krsna's shifting from Mathurā to Dvārakā of real importance, in this context, is the fragment of an inscription in Kharosthi characters, dis covered by A N BERNSHTAM in Tadjikistan, which is deciphered as "Nārāyana, be victorious" On palaeographical grounds, the inscription is assignable to the second first century BC It is difficult to ascertain whether the reference in the inscription is to the Nārāyana of Vaisnavism or to Nārāyana the Buddha But the proximity of Badarıkāšrapa and Tadjikistan 12 would render it quite probable that the reference is to the Nārāyaṇa of Vaisnavism The Nicolo seal, bearing an inscription in Tocharian script and Tocharian language points to the prevalence, in Central Asia, about 500 AD, of a composite cult of Siya, Visnu, and Surya Definite Vaisnava influence is noticeable in a Buddha image with auspicious symbols from Balawaste in the Domoko region, on the southern silk route of Eastern Turkistan This image is attributable to about the eighth century A D 418

(b) The Sak11-cult The Tantras relate primarily to the worship of Saktı, though other religous sects also have their Tantras It is claimed that the worship of Sakti is a fundamental feature of the Vedic religion and that Vāk, Laksmi, Ida, Kál, and Umā are some of the aspects of Sakti with which the Vedic post-priests were familiar The history of the Sakti-cult is, horever analogous to that of the Siva-cult The Sakti-cult has to be traced back to the pre-Vedic non-Aryan cult of the Mother Goddess On account of the pressure of cusculistances, the Vedic religion was forced to adopt some of the features of the latter in its ideology, but its direct developed form is to be seen in the Sāktism of the epias, the Purānas, and the Tantras In all probability, the Sakti cult originally evolved as an independent religious cult, it must have been only at some later stage that it cane to be affiliated to the Siva-cult, in which latter it found a most suitable soul for growth Actually, as pointed out earlier, in classical Siktiso the active Sakti completely overwhelmed the p355Me Siva Three factors may be said to have helped in the consolidation of the position of Sakti (1) the metaphysically derned concept of the divise energy, (2) the ancient cosmogonial concept of sexual dualism, and (3) the deep-seated primitive faith ia the mother principle as the ultimate secret of the universe It is presumably 19 yies of this that the Tantras are said to have aimed at the simplification of religion on metaphysical rather than on emo tional lines

temples at Bhurma (District Pappa, Madhya Pradesh) and Udayagun hills near Vidišā, bich fact clearly points to the existence of the worship of Ganesa in the Gopta period This is further confirmed by the fact that Varāhamjhira (beginning of the sixth century) has prescribed in his Brhetsamhıtā detailed instructions in connection with the fashioning of the images of Ganesa
