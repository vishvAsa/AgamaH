It is now generally agreed that man is basically & religious creature As a finite beisg, he instinctively yearns for the infinite Actually he seeks in the Infinite the solace and support for his ono finite life As the Chandogja-Upanisad says! Jo vai bhima tai sulham, ra’lpe sulham astı It is, indeed, the potential infinity in his finite personality -- his instinctive urge to transcend the finiteness from which he suffers - that produces 10 man what ray be called a religious feeling 
And the most basic factor in this religious feeling may be said to be a vague sense of some power which permeates and directs man and the uonerse The doctrine relating to this power is represented by the historidas as religion under various nanes, such as adimism, manaism, aumenism, dynamism, and theism. Ao extedsion of this doctrine, which has evoked perhaps the largest consensus, is the claim that the belief in god constitutes the primary priociple of all religions But can such a claun be said to hold good in respect of Hioduism? 
It must be confessed, at the very outset, that it is not possible to make any statement shich may be generally applicable to Hinduism as a whole For, Hinduism is by no means a homoge neous entity Sectaninism is the very essence of Hinduism, and, when any general statement regarding Hioduism is made, one or the other of its sects is bound to prove an exception to that statement This is, indeed, quite understandable in respect of a relgion which has arisen and developed without Prophet, without Book, and without Church Hinduism is not made, it has grown It is well and truly said that Hinduism is a jungle and not a deliberately laid out park or garden Whatever could GTON ID it did actually grow in it The doctrines and practices or Hinduism can, accordingly, 11 lend themselves to any cute gene

ralization All that one may seek to do is to view the entire situation historically and synoptically 
For our present purpose, the history of Hinduism may be conveniently divided into four periods, namely, (1) the period of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan religious complex, wbich is basically different from Vedism but whose affiliations with the classical or historical Hinduism are beyond doubt and essentially organic and thus establish a line of direct development with it, and which may, therefore, be justifiably characterised as proto-historical Hipduism, (2) the period of the Vedic interlude with its distinct mythology, magic, ritualism, and spiritualism, (3) the period of classical or historical Hinduism jo its stages of consolidation and proliferation, and (4) the period of the stagnation of Hinduism and its subsequent confrontation with modernity? 
The sources of our knowledge of proto-lustorical Hinduism are necessarily limited We do not possess any literature or popular tradition directly relating to that period, and all that we have to draw upon consists of archaeological finds and other similar antiquities It is, however, possible to sketch jo broad butline the salient features of the religious situation prevailiog in the pre-Vedic non Aryan period of India's history with the help of the archaeological and allied evidence as also with the help of the literary reflexes of that situation seen in the later Vedic and other texts The principal god of that period was represented variously in different parts of the country-as Pasupatı-Yogi Svara of the Indus people, as the red god Sivan of the Proto Dravidians, as Sarve of the eastern people, and as Bhava of the Vähikas or Bählykas He was the supreme male god associated With the cult of the Mother Goddess or the Mothers " who presumably personified that god's power of procreation and sustenance The proto historical Hinduism was an idolatrous religion, the god having been worshipped in the form of an image or a carved figure or some other concrete symbol The existcoce

of public places of Worship also cannot be discountedanced The norship took the form of pújā, which basically consisted of anointing the figure or the symbol of the god normally with the blood of the animal offered to him or otherwise with some suitable substitute The offering to the god, which often formed part of a communal sacrifice, was usually raw and was made over to the divi Dity directly - that is to say, it was of the nature of balı and not of the nature of homa wherein the oblation was usually cooked and was offered to the divinity through sacral fire On account of the pouring of blood over the figure or the symbol of the god, the god looked red and was, in some parts of the country, actually called Siva meaning "red god * Even the worshippers of that god put sacramental blood on their bodies, or otherwise painted their bodies red or more red robes Yoga, penance and auste aties, wandering mendicancy, ecstatic conditions engendered through special medicaments, control and peculiar operation of the vinle poser, etc, constituted some of the main factors of the proto-historical Hindu religious pracuce These factors very markedly differenuated the pre-Vedic qod-Anan religious culture of the munus and jars from the Vedic Arap religious culture of the r515 But fairly distinct echoes of the former can be heard in some Vedic hymns like the Juni-sük ta (RP X. 136 ), the Brah macari-sükta ( AV XI ), and the Vratza-sūklas (AV XY) In vies of the fact that most of the significant features of this proto historical Hinduism are seen to have been preserved, consolidated, and developed in the later Srva-religion, the former may very well be characterised as the religion of proto-Sıva Vedic Rudra is but an Agad version of that god * 
This reconstruction of the proto-bustoncal Hinduism, which was bound to be but cursory, cannot, however, be said sufficicotly to enlighten us on the total conception of godhead so that penod All that we are entitled to presume is that, if we visualized the later Sıva-religion as an essentially monotheistic religion, we might

obtain a fairly suggestive glimpse in the proto-historical Hindu theology 
With Vedism, a new religious ideology, which is exotic and basically distinct from the proto-historical Hindu religious ideo logy, -makes its appearance on the Indian scene Fortunately, from this period onwards, we have a rich and almost unbroken tradition of religious literature, which enables us to study more specifically the topics which are pertinent to our present inquiry, such as the nature of the deity, the relation of the deity to the world, and the relation of the deity to the finite self in its three principal states, namely, the pre-samsára state, the embodted state, and the emancipated state 
To begin with the Rgreda, one may say that that Veda is "primarily occupied with mythology rather than with theology 
To pot it in other words, most of the Rgvedic gods appear to have been created for the myths and not the myths created for the gods The Rgvedic religion is directly dependent on myths The myth is the primary and unique mode of apprehending reality, it is thus expressive of the primitive man's experience of reality The myth, indeed, is the thing, while the divinities seem to have been thought of as mere actors in the mythological drama In the course of the exuberant growth of mythology and mythology, it should be remembered, is an essentially grow 10g phenomenon- many incidental and sometimes even irelevant details are added to its nucleus It is in view of this tendency that mythology is said to be telling many little lies in the interest of one great truth " 
It is generally accepted that the Vedic gods are not amenable to being reduced to any kind of system The character of the Vedic gods, as imagined by the Vedic poets in different contexts, is too fluid and jptangible And this their feature gets more and more confirmed on account of the absence of any attempt, during that period, to represent them in a concrete manger A sculpture or a painting certainly tends to invest a god with a kind of definite characterisation Strictly speaking, a Vedic god is 
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 
109 
generally not a god in the spiritual, moral, or mystical sense He 15 venly a bundle of epithets and functions But even in this respect we do not find any logical consistency Whatever theism there is in the Veda is little more than glorified anthropomor phism, which latter, again, is bighly variable The Vedic divities would seem to defy any classification - bether regional, rtua lite or functional They are too vague and impersonal for such classification. In this connection, BARVETT actually went to the extent of saying that the Vedic people whose imagination created Vedic deities had never felt any deep interest in them and that the Vedic poet-priests had got been able to cover them with the flesh and blood of living personality 
Notwithstanding all this, attempts have been made to discover some norm or derile some system by means of an analysis of Vedic mythology The Mirulia of Yaska refers to the theones of scholiasts like the Nauruktas, the Aitihasikas, and the Yamikas The etymological-naturalistic interpretation of Vedic mythology, sponsored by Yáska, found a large following among the modern Vedists They were content to look upon myths as a kind of paraphrase of natural phenomena, for them, Vedic mythology was latile rrore than "a plastic and popular physics and astro nomy " It is hardly necessary to emphasize the inherent inade quacy of such a view Suffice it to point out that it has bot inevitable that the religious thinking of the Vedic people, who lived in immediate contact with pature, should have been pro foundly influenced by naturalistic concepts but those concepts cannot be said to bale constituted the basic foundation of their religious thinkisg Naturl phenomena generally do got create mayths aod legends, the similarity with a natural phenomenon may only help mythologically to reinforce a story which often has a real historical happening for its b3sts

may be made here to some of the typical views in this connection MAX MULLER, for instance, begins with certain basic assump tions According to him, all religions have some common basic elements, such as the realisation of the Divine in the actual, the feeling of human weakness and dependence, the faith in the divine ordering of the world, the consciousness of good and bad, and the hope for a higher and better life Again, all religions, howsoevermuch they may differ in other respects, agree 10 onc point, namely, that their evidence is not entirely supplied by sensuous perception in connection with this, MAX MUILER thinks that, so far as the Vedic religion is concerned, two factors must have been operative (1) some kind of external revelation as is suggested by the word śruti and (2) a kind of religious instinct, which only man, among all living creatures, possesses He then goes on to point out that, by a simple psychological analysis, we can discover three classes of things, which we can perceive with our senses, but which leave in us three very distinct kinds of impression of reality (1) tangible objects, such as stones, shells, and bones, which are supposed to have been the earliest objects of religious worship by the religion historians who bold fetishism 10 be the first beginnings of all religion, (2) semi tangible objects, such as trees, mountains, rivers, the sea, and the earth, and (3) mangible objects, such as the sky, the stars, the Sun, the dawn, and the moon The testimony of the Veda, MAX MULLER further points out, shows that, out of the three foregoing classes of objects, the first is hardly represented at all among the so called deities of the Rgveda As for the semi tangible objects, each one of them can be met with among the deities of the Veda MAX MULLCR characterises these deities as semi deilies in the intangible objects can be discovered the germs of what may be called full deities MAX MULLER'S conception of Vedic mythology is naturalistic, and in his matura listic conception hic scems always to stress the solar aspectI{crc it is neither possible nor necessary to subject MAI MULLER'S

views to any critical examination, it may only be pointed out that the facts of Vedic mythology as stated by him are often correct, but his interpretation of them is not always convincing 
The startiog poput of BERGAIGNE IS the assumption of the rigorous zaterdependence of Vedic mythology and Vedic cult? The sacrificial ritual is according to him, the true reproduction on earth of the cosmic phenomena. These phenomena are of two kinds (1) those which accompany the rising of the son ( solar phenomena ), and (2) those which accompany the fallsng of ram after a long drought (meteorological phenomena) la both these kinds of phenomena, Vedic mythology disticgaishes between male and fecale elements, and these different elements are represented differently in the frame-work of mythological anthropomorphisco and zoomorphism From this bare sketch of BERGAIGVES theory it would be seen that, tbough SERGAIGNE started with a vien to presenting Vedic religion and mythology as a simple system consisting of a fen easily intelligible formulas, he actually ended by producing only a complicated and essentially schematic pattern 
Rudolf OTTO approaches the Veda pot from the point of view of philology or Indology, but from the point of 11ew of psychology and history of religion" He believes that the genesis of the Vedic gods (1odeed, of any gods) angot be traced back to the effects produced on man s mind by the great phenomena of nature, soch as the sun, the sky, the stone, the winds, etc, but that, at the bottom of all consciousness of drypity, there is the specific and a prion faculty of apperception of a power shich may best be termed as a pimen' It wil, however, be easily agreed that Vedic mythology 15 too comprehensive and variegated to be squeezed into the narrow frame of the Duminous

functional relationship between social and sacred phenomena, DUMÉZIL arrives at his tripartite division of Indo European social organization into priests, warriors, and food-producers (that 15, peasants and artisans) as a keystone of a common religio mythological ideology) He then goes on to point out that, so 
far as the Vedic religion and mythology are concerned, the two antithetical yet complementary divine rulers Mitra and Varuna are the representatives of the class of priests, Indra (or Vāyu) of that of warriors, and Asvins of that of food-producers DUMÉ ZIL is rightly criticised for being " carried away by his own hypotheses, constructions, and subjective interpretations " 10 
My own view is that Vedic mythology is essentially an evolutionary mythology Its general character has changed 10 accordance with the vicissitudes in the cultural life of the Vedic people For instance, it would be seen that a certain specific god was regarded as having been sovereign and supreme in a certain specific period The reason for this was that the character and personality of that god were in full conformity with the ethos of that period This is one aspect of the evolutionary mythology The other aspect of it is that, though the basic character of a divinity was determined by the peculiar environments in which it had come into beipg, that character did not remain static and stagnant throughout It underwent various modifications in accordance with the changing conditions of life of the Vedic Aryans in the course of its evolution, many new features gradually accumulated round that divinity so that the total personality which it finally presented was highly complex 1, however, believe that it is not altogether impossible to analyse the complex character and personality of a Vedic god, generally isolate from one another the various elements in that character, and then broadly mark out, with the help of comparative mytho

logy, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Vedic Arvans, the different stages 10 the evolution of that god 
I should like to characterize the primar ard the most basic religious concept in the early Vedic period as Orendism or Asuism The Vedic man believed in a magc potence- and be often thought of it 12 terms of scmething like “soul-stuff". which permeated through gatore and the human world and thereby constituted the essential basis of their existence and functioning This magic potence has shared alike by gods, human beir, animals trees, etc - of course in varying propor tions It was on account of this that the Vedic man made do sharp distinction between spint and matter, Imog and lifeless, person and thung abstract and concrete, substance and attributes, etc The concept of a somatic magic potence such as this tas, mdeed, common to the religious ideologes of many primitive peoples The name for this potence, which is particularly pope lar with the anthropologists, is Maps or Orenda, and its Vedic counterpart, in my view, 15 as: It is from these names that I have coined the terms Orendism and Asvism The Vedic man further believed that, through his marfra and cultic action, new asu could be created and the existitg asu either enhanced or reduced or traosferred from one entity to another The essential cature of the Vedic gods is that they are asuras or special possessors of the asu-potence varura is asura par etcellence and soften celebrated, in the Agreda, as the samrāl, who, by virtue of his power of bondage arisiog from his asuratsa, esta blishes the cosm c order na in this vast and complex 005 serse This may be said to be the norm of the cosmic myth which is presented in the Veda ja varying forms and with different gods in different contents The Vedic poet-prest speaks of several other aspects of this essential magic putru, o sbose operation man is believed to be subjected either positively or Degatively The Vedic poet priest further emphasizes the fact that, while man is dependent for his existence and functioning on the bearers of the magic asu-potence (assras) the latter too are dependent for their proper functioning on man's mantra and 
114 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
cultic action This sense of mutual interdependence may, indeed, be said to be at the very root of the cosmic ethics of the ancient Indians 
'To recapitulate So far as the primary conception of god. head of the early Vedic poet-priests is concerned, three points need to be specially stressed, namely, (1) that the Vedic gods are generally conceived as being subservient to an all pervading magic potence, (2) that, since they participate in this magic potence together with all other categories of existence, they cannot be said to be essentially distinct from the latter (the potence being more basic and more important than the person' or 'thing' in which it inheres), and (3) that all these categories, including gods, are dependent on one another for their proper functioning This, in brief, is the only theology that one can derive from the Rgieda Everything else is mythology Apart from the primary cosmic myth, which has been referred to above, the most signifi cant of the factors which have become operative in the process of the evolution and growth of Vedic mythology are mythologisation of history mainly through the superimposition of naturalistic cosmic elements (as represented in the Indra legends) and hierarchisation of popular religious cults, wherein solarization bas played a particularly prominent role, (as, for instance, seen in the evolution of the mythology relating to Visnu and Pūsın) 
Theologically, the religion of the Rgieda may be characterised as "pan asuism", if I am permitted to coin such a word to denote the religious doctrine according to which the universe conceived as a whole is asu-permeated But, mythologically, that religion is certainly polytheistic It is a polytheism of anthropomorphic character A few pertinent points need to be taken into account in this context The anthropomorphism of the Vedic gods, it will be seen is itself highly variable Again, properly speaking, there is no hierarchy among these gods There are no clear and well defined functions in the world process and world rule assigned to the various members of the Vedic pantheon As a matter of fact, one may hardly speak of a pantheon of Vedic gods in the strictest sense of the term They do not have any recognised

115 
undisputed leader like Zeus or Jupiter, and they present a picture of “interminable variety of ranks and confusing interchange of characters * In view of these facts, the Rgvedic polytheism must be said to be a diffuse polytheism 
It is suggested that one may discover in the Rgreda a distinct trend of its polytheism gradually making way to mono. theism For one thing there is noticeable an acreasing tendency to identify the gods one with another, which MAX MULLER calls syncretism The frequent grouping of gods also points in the same direction Then there are suggestions that all Vedic divinities are participants in the same divine esserce Further, the Vire L'esīh are regarded as embodying the concept of collective godhead, and a fer passages from the Rgseda are beltered to reflect a kind of "integral multiplicity in the d une world In spite of all such indications it must be clearly stated that monotheism in the sense of a single ethical god s bo, while being intimately involved in the world process is yet transcen dental in character had not developed in the Vedic penod. Indeed, such monotheista cannot be said to have developed jo any period of the history of Hinduism, except perhaps in the proto-historical perod Whatever jpdications there are in the Veda point to nopism rather than to monotheisio For instance, the oft-quoted Rgvedıc passage (t 167 46 ), cham sad riprå bahudhà rodanti, cannot be said to imply monotheisio The peuter elam and the fact that the manifold forms of that one principle are stated to have been accepted as an established fact would go agaiast such an interpretation In the creative process of tbe voiverse, the many issues out of the "ode', in the thuoking process of man, on the other band he seeks to reduce the many' to the one. It is this latter trait which is often misrepresented as suggesting monotheism 
c. A his treatment of Vedic religion, MAT MULLER has emphasized one significant tendency of the Vedic poets, namely, to celebrate jodividual gods successively as the highest To this successive belief in single supreme gods te has given the care of 
116 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
henotheism or kathenotheism 11 To identify Indra, Agni, and Varuna is one thing, it is syncretism To address either Indra or Agni or Varuna as, for the time being, the only god in existence with an entire forgetfulness of all other gods is quite another - According to MAX MUI LER, it is this latter tendency, the heno theistic tendency, which is fully developed and predominantly reflected in the hymns of the Rgreda MAX MULLER further adds that henotheism marks a stage between the original poly theism and the later monotheism of the Rgxeda 
OLDENBERG characterizes benotheism as an appearance rather than a reality, for, as he seeks to point out, such successive glorification of the Vedic gods has a reference to different sacrificial contexts and thus has little theological value 12 BLOOM FIELD also explains the phenomenon of henotheism on ritualistic grounds and adds that henotheism is “polytheism grown cold in service, and unnice in its distinctions, leading to an opportunist monotheism in which every god takes hold of the sceptre and none keeps it " 13 The protagonists of Urmonotheism (that 15, of the doctrine that belief in one single god is primary in all religions) are inclined to regard henotheism as deteriorated monotheism According to Rudolf OTTO the so called heno. theism only indicates that certain Vedic tribes worshipped certain gods as their special gods and placed them above others It is just a case of tribal (or, as HILLEBRANDT would put it, regional) monolatry It is also suggested by some scholars that the same mental attitude as inspired the dānastutis (or eulogies of patrons) also inspired henotheistic hymns That is to say, blatant flattery was at the bottom of those hymos 
It may, first of all, be pointed out that the tendency observed by MAX MUILER is an indisputable fact of Vedic mythology His suggestion that the Vedic religious thought has developed from polytheism through henotheism to monotheism is also probable, but it actually did not happen that way, for, the Vedic

religion dever became monotheistic To speak in the coatext of henotheism, of various monotheisms or of monotheisms with changing gods is theologically UpSound The conception of Urmonotheism does not seem to be valid at least so far as the Vedic religion is concerned. The Vedic tendency, as mentioned earlier, 15 to go from the many 'to the 'one' and oot vice versa Henotheism cannot, therefore, be explained as the last remem brance and relic of the original monotheism Similarly, there is no evidence to support the assumption that henotheism 15 either a ntualistic device or a tribal trait. To compare henotheistic passages with dānastutis amounts to a gross Disconception of both. Henotheism is certainly not intended merely for the practical purpose of fattering certain god, with a ver to garding treasures from then Henotheism represents a distract religious attitude, namely, that of eclecticism (as against absolutism or exclusivism ) which has characterised Hiodoism almost throughout its history 11 Its further development may be traced to the concept of 1sfaderatá which implies a complete freedom of choosing one's special god and mode of worship, without however, allowing that freedom to become in any way detrimental to other gods and other forms of worship Monotheism is essentially exclusive in character Accordingly, benotheism is not only not a stage leading towards monotheism, but, in a sense, it implies an opposition to it One could claim that one's god was supreme, but one must not claim that that god sas unique It may be incidentally added that it is the two doctrices, namely, of adhikara (spuntual competence) and of Istaderată (freedom of worship ), wbuch have helped to brag about a kind of religious adjustment among the various peoples and cults which have gone to make up the toity that is Hinduism 
Two main tendences are noticeable in what may be presumed ta be the last staves in the evolution of Rgvedic religion A feeling seems to hase been gradually taking root in the minds of the Rgvedic poet-priests that the mythological gods were quite

ipadequate to satisfy their religious instinct They were, as it were, groping for a real god, and, therefore, asked in great anguish kasmai de âya hausā vidhena (RV X 121 ) The other tendency, as shown earlier, was to reduce the perplexing multipli city in the divine world to some kind of unity 
There is very little of mythology in the Athanaveda, for, mythopoetic activity and magic do not normally go well together The gods as represented in that Veda are but subservient to magic which is the central theme of that Veda And the basic founda tion of the Atharvanıc magic is none other than the "pan-asuism* of the Rgveda This latter is also at the root of the Vedic ritual such as has been developed in the Brāhmanas The Brāhnianas seem to give some prominence to the new god Prajāpatı, which fact has persuaded some scholars to discover a kind of mono theism in it But Prajāpat is by no means a mythological or a theological deity He does not possess any individuality, he mostly appears as the central figure in the ritual of creative self immolation The Vedic fitual is conceived as an autonomous phenomenon and as operating automatically, that is, indepen dently of god or man in the ideology of the Vedic ritual, gods do not play any important role The Brāhmana texts, which set great store by the correct performance of an inordinately complex system of sacrifices, may be said to have actually ousted god from the centre of the religious stage (if he had at all occupied that centre any time!) Indeed, it was sacrifice which was believed to have bestowed godhead on gods Sacrifice was intended to coerce gods rather than to propitiate them 
If the Brahmadic ritualism had divested the mythological gods of their individualities and functions, the Upanisadic spin tualism completely negatived their importance and influence in connection with the world process The early Upanisdds taught the doctrine of the ultimate identity between the brahmant, the universe, and the individual self This utter monism allowed no scope whatsoever for theism It was, however, obviously not possible that such a rigorous metaphysical position could be maintaincd for long Popular religious sentiment is not satisticd

with an abstract impersonal entity, it craves for a personal deity Besides, there must have been pressures - both of a pozjuse and of a negative character - from the con-Vedic religious ideologes Consequently tere began to appear, in the pariscds, more or less clear-cut theistic tendencies a hich are seen to have reached their culmination in the Steräsralara-parisad Already in the Chandogsa-Cparised (ILI 14), Sodilya speaks of the man in terras which are rercmucent of a personal god The chiarjantre doctrine of the Brhadârcrjako-parisid (II 7 8 ) and that Upanisad's characterisuon of the mal an airā as sarrasja rasi, santara Israk sarrasju adrpalthsarrestaracturadripauh, brütcpālah, etc (IV +22) may also be regarde the therstic direction The Brhadaranızda-l parisad (147) seems to think of the supreme being as something etternal to the world 
But a d stinct mtimation of the traosition from mooism to theism becomes available from the Vurdala-Upasad acd more particularly from the Sretāstataro-parisd The Stetāstatara Upamisad (I 12 ) caequr ocally dotinguiskes dhoker (tke individual self), thogja (the phenomecal xorld), and prenir (the god) from one another, and then speaks of these three forming trin dram brafma The supreme being is referred to (IV 11-13) by terms denoting a personal god, such as isāna, rorada, idya dera, ustadhipa, de ärāns ad ipa, etc He is the source and ongia of the gods, the ruler of all, Rudra. The lord 15 the supporter of all this which is a combination of putable and romutable He 15 aot idenucal with the indusideal self, but pervades it without Sharing 10 its imperfections and actions. There is also a sugges top in that Upar sad of a bhakti-uke personal relatopship between the supreme being and the individual self The god in his immacent spect is to be knaan through yoga, the god in his transcendent aspect is to be worshipped with loving devotion Further, the Sretānarara-Uparjad emphasizes the necessity of moral conduct and the possibility of the grace of god The Sretāsratara-Upansod may thus be regarded as presenting perbaps the earlkst full-fledged theistic statement in histoncal Hindum 
120 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
And the fact that the great god according to that statement is Rudra is historically very significant, for, it may have been a direct result of the influence of the proto historical Hindu mono theism centering round proto-Sıya 
The history of classical Hinduisma presents a strange pheno menon While, on the one hand, Hinduism sought to substitute the impersonal absolute of the Upanısads with a personal god, the various philosophical systems, which it adopted as its own, were, by and large, basically atheistic The Samkhya system, for instance, whose beginnings, incidentally, must be traced back to the pre-Vedic non Aryan thought complex, had originally no place for god in its metaphysics The process of the evolution of the material and the psychological world from the Prakšti was believed to be autonomous It was only at a later stage in the development of the Sāmkhya doctrine that god came to be posited as being jostrumental in bringing Praktı and Purusa into contact with each other and thereby initiating the world process The Hinduism of the epics and the Puranas has mostly sponsored this latter kind of Sāmkhya, namely, the seśvara Sāmkhya The Yoga system, which concerns itself essentially with mental and spiritual discipline but which has generally adopted the Samkhya doctrine as its metaphysical basis, does accept god God, accord ing to that system, is after all a Purusa or soul, but he is a distinctive kind of soul He is different from other souls not so much because he is eternal and transcends the limitations of time, but because, unlike other Purusas, he ever remains unaffected by the ramifications of Prakrti He is also said to be responsible for the maintenance of the cosmic order, but he is never specifi cally represented as the cause of the universe He is thus redeemed of any bability for the inequality and cruelty jo the world Not only this, he is even said to be positively compas. Siodate There is further an indication in the Yoga system of a kind of an ontological argument such as that, since we have an idea of a Prefect Supreme Being, such a Being must be in exis. tencc But the most outstanding feature of god's personality which the Yoga system seems to emphasize is that he is the ideal

The Vabeskas, Uke the Samkhyes, generally seco to hold that the world-process is 10 DO vay dependent on god, though, it may be added, the Varsesika-Sūtras proper do not contain any direct passage bearing on tbe creation and ibe dissolupon of the userse The Varesika system maintains that reason canpot prove the existence of god However, the atutude of that system towards god cannot be said to be as uncompromising as that of the original Samkhya The later Vanesika theory such as is, for lostaoce, developed in the blásja of Pravastapāda, presumably under the groping theistic jafi uerce speaks of god as being actively instrumental 19 the er olution and dissolution of the uonerse The Njáya system represents pot so much a philoso phucal system as a logical methodology Its metaphysical basis Is derned largely from the Valsesila atomism It mentions god malals as the sentient administrator of the law of Karma It is god who ensures that that lan does not operate promiscuously Some Marjakas, like Vācaspati and Udasdda offer logical proof for the existence of a primal cause posessing intelligence of the highest order God 15 believed to joitiate the creative process He is the operause cause of the underse, but he does not get humself involved in the workings of the upiverse It honever, needs to be underlined that the god of the Naya system is hardly comparable to the personal god of the proper theistic ideology 
The Pūrsanimāmsā treats god with scant respect. For, according to it, the Vedic ntual, ubicb is its chief concern, operates automatically and autonomously God is subservient to the ntpal performance and is often regarded as even superious. Indeed for the Pün amimams, which essentially deals with the technique of interpreting the Vedic texts, the subject of god is almost irrelevant it, therefore, often ignores god It bas been well said that, according to Miminsä, gods can be regarded only as hypothetical entities which one has to assume because they art 
16.122 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
essential for the ritual act In the eyes of the Mimāmsakas, * Veda' is far more vital and important than Deva' Inciden tally, the Vedic ritual does not also seem to bother about the "moralness" of the character of the sacrificer and the officiating Prests or of the purpose of the sacrificial act 
A characteristic feature of the Vedānta as represented by Samkara is the assumption of two main levels of reality - trans cendental or absolute and phenomenal or empirical The ultimate and the only reality is, no doubt, the brahman in its transcenden tal aspect Naturally enough, this immutable bralınan caonot be made liable for any kind of activity like that of creating the universe The universe may have only relative reality, but its creation had nonetheless to be explained It is in this context that god is posited by Samkara In other words, god is real on the same level as the individual self and the universe The con ception of god is, after all, a hypothesis which right knowledge eventually dicards But, as long as that right philosophical knowledge does not dawn upon a person, he has to accept god seriously and with adequate zeal Thus Samkara does not deny the existence of god on the empirical level However, on this level, the individual self is not to be identified with god For, the ways in which the māyā operates with reference to god on the one hand and to the jodividual self on the other are essenlially different Of course, when the mājà ceases to operate, there is neither god nor individual self 
A brief mention may now be made of the attitude of some of the avowedly theistic schools The Bhagavadgitā seems to oscillate between pantheistic monism on the one hand and fervent theism centred round a personal god on the other It sometimes represents god as an aspect of the brahman-as a personalized version of the bralıman-st being thus suggested that the brahman is the supreme being, but it ultimately proclaims as its gulya. Tama - most esoteric-teaching that, beyond the undifferentiated unity of the brahinian, there is the god, who is the Supreme Person characterised by numberless perfections, who is the ethical lord, who is actively involved in the world process but who nevertheless 
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 
123 
remains eternally changeless in his essence, and who, above all, bears ceep affection and love for his devotees. The teaching of the Bhagajadzitā regarding the nature of god continues to dommate the later religio-philosophical tests of the Bhagavatas, such as the warājarija and the Amugită in the ckabr234, the VISP-Purina, the Pacarıra-Somas and the Bhagavatt Purāna The only noteworthy modification in the basic teaching of the Bagavadgita is the doctrire of ones, which is adumbra ted in the Marijaniza and fully developed in the Purcarētra. Samnitás According to this doctrice, the true nature of Vasu deva the supreme god, I consututed of the scegunja or sex qualities, namely, fura or absolute consciousness with its five characteristics, sakit (which enables Vasadeva to become the material cause of the universe ), atsvarja (or independent spontaneous power of action ) bala (or inexhaustible power of sustaining the world), virja (or the ability to remain unchanged despite being the material dose), and teus (or prestige ard authority with which be bras forta the universe without any extraceous help). These sit guras are represented on the one hand, as forming Văsudeva s body, and, on the other, ay serving, through the three juhes -Sankarsada, Pradyum2, und Adr. ruddha, 18 each of these ty has only two out of the six gunas being specially attested -as the instruments of his creative activity 
Madhva may be said to be teacting a sort of an almost uodiluted monotheism He unequivocally recognizes the dualism between god and the creat on, both of whuch are real, though he does not fail to add that god alone is absolute and independent Madhva emphasizes the fivefold difference, namely, between god and soul, bera een god ard patter, between soul add matter, between one soul and another acd between Oce atom of matter and another Icdeed, he is so uncompromising in this respect that he is not unoften seen to be twisting the patentlv pantasistic texts to yield monotheist c-dualistic sease As for the tresm of Vallabha and Caitanya it may be pointed out that emotional, passionate - almost erotic - love for a personal god is its most outstanding feature

But by far the ablest statement of what may be called philosophical theism we owe to Rāmānuja Ramanuja's persona lity often betrays an inner conflict between a philosopher and a theologian-- the latter usually having the upper hand Rāmānuja was not only a metaphysician, he was also and perhaps more essentially - a founder of a religious sect According to him, the existence of god cannot be established by means of logic For instance, one cannot argue, as on the empirical plane, that just as a living body presupposes the existence of the soul or intelligent agent, even so does the world process presuppose the existence of an intelligent motive principle like god for, the analogy here is not perfect, the soul not being ever assumed as the creator of the body Nor can the analogy of potter clay-picher be regarded as compelling enough to establish in connection with the universe the existence of god as the agent possessing the knowledge of the material cause For, as Rāmānuja seems to suggest, even a lesser being than god as he has conceived him would be quite adequate for the purpose On the other hand, though the scriptures constitute for Ramānuja the only authoritative source for the knowledge of god, his peculiar attitude towards the Upanisad's tends to show that he has realised that the Upanisads do not support the doctrine sponsored by him 
God, according to Rūmīnusa, has for his attributes the six gumas, namely, jñāna, etc, mentioned by the Pāőcarātra texts He is characterised by all perfections He is the supreme dividity which creates this world of manifold experience which is essen trally real The world, consisting of souls and matter, is depen. dent on god, it is, indeed, god's body Rāmānuja further points out that the world is related to god as modes or attributes are related to substance This would bring out the appropriateness of his teaching being designated as wis1514 ad, aila Incidentally it may be noted that, according to Rāmānuja, god exists jo five different modes -as Para or the entire supreme spitit, as the four wühas, as an avatāra like Rima or Krsna, as the antaryamin, and as a duly consecrated image 
Various Views have been put forth regarding the nature ol 
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 
125 
god and the ultimate reality in modern Hipdu thought The Arya Samaj, for costance, seems to sponsor a Liod of monothersunt as against Vedāntic mopism It believes in three fundamental realities, namely, god, soul, and the uptverse On the other hand, Sri AUROBINDO speaks of integral advaltısm-of one Brahman with positive and negative aspects Bat the general trend in Neo-Hindoism may be said to be towards some kind of reconciliation between the absolute and the god Swam, VIVEKA. NAYDA regards god as the dynamic aspect of the highest reality TAGORE thinks of the reality as teing both impersonal and personal, as chaogeless and evolving, as being and becoming And according to RADHAKRISHNAN, the god is the absolute from the cosmic point of view and the absolute represents the precosmic nature of god 
It may be specially pointed out here that, in whatever forms theism developed in classical Hinduism and Neo-Hicdum, it alsays had a pantherstic tinge Hindu temperament and Hindu Jogic must be said to be particularly corducise to a pantbestic religion Indeed, lodia, as a whole, has come to be recognised as the classic land of panikeism, aod the vanons Indian religions are regarded as representing but different stages of panibersm. There is, however, often percepuble a tendency to suggest that even pootheismo is rot the ultimate truth Actually Hindu thought IS pot inclined to make any sharp distinction between philosophical monio aod religious panthers. It is, therefore, not infrequently that this modism-paotheism tends to be represented (or, rather, misrepresented) either as acosmism or as polite atheism 
The two main questions relatiog to god and the world-process are (1) How did god create the world? acd (11) why did god create tbe world? Vanous viens have been expressed io connec tion with the first question To begin with, there are some schools of Hindu thought which do not at all regard the sorld as the bandinork of god Indeed Hinduism is said to represent a peculiar religious phenomenon in which god does not deces santy figure as the creator nor does bis will constitute the moral law One extreme vient is that the phenomenal world is basically an 
126 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
allusion, a false presentment of god or the ultimate reality, an imagined transformation of the supreme being The usual analogy in this respect is that of the rope which, under certain circumstances, appears as serpent It is pointed out that so long as the world appears it is in the Brahman which is the only reality This does not, however, affect the transcendent character of the ultimate reality, Brahman, in the same way as the essential " ropeness" of the rope is in no way affected by its transient appearance as serpent From the ultimate point of view, there does not exist any god as such apart from the impersonal, abso lute Brahman However, in view of the essential immutability of Brahman, the existence of god may be temporarily posted as a kind of connecting link between the immutable Brahman and the temporary illusion of the world for, as long as the illusion of the world is not recognized as an illusion, it does possess what may be called relative reality So, god, according to this view, stands on the same level of reality as the world and the individual self 
The Bràlunanas and the early Upanisads often mention a cosmological theory according to which creation amounts to some kind of emanation or rather discharge (srst) which is not dependent either on the will or the activity of a divine person In otber words, creation is there represented as 1 purely materia listic process Another cosmological theory, which is atheistic and materialistic presupposes the time less co-existence of two essen tially contradictory and mutually independent entities, namely, prakrlı or thc undifferentiated matter, which however, possesses the potentiality of evolving, and purusa or the multiplicity of souls which is capable of seeing but incapable of acting These two come into a relationship with each other - one cannot say how - and the process of the evolution of the cosmological and psychological world is thereby started The Valsesika cosmology, which involves a specific kind of conglomeration of eternally existing atoms is like the original Samkhya prakrti-purusa cosmo logy, also atheistic 
Side by side with such atheistic materialistic theories of creation, there have developed in Indian thought, even from very 
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 
127 
early times, different kinds of personalistic-theistic theories of creation The descriptions of Vedic gods as having been respod. sible for the creation aod sustenance of the universe have to be understood rather as poetical erercises intended to emphasize the power and greatpess of those gods than as any deliberate cosmo logical speculations But a reference must be made in this conrection to the viet suggested in the Purusasühta (RV X 90) that the upverse is the result of the ritual self-immolation of a hermaphrodie man-cod Some Upadisadıc accounts bowever. represent cosmology with a more specific personalistic bias For lastance, the Prawa Upanisad (I 3-13) tells us that, at the begipoog of creation, Prajāfat the creator, having become desirous of progeny, practised penance, and, after having practi sed peoapce, produced the original couple, rajı and prána, who eventually created all that exists Elsewhere ( Tarttırja-Up II 6), Prajāpati, who, presumably, bad become tired of his solitude, is said to have emitted, by way of a relief from that solitude, the entire creation The ideas underlying these two theories seem to hare merged together to give rise to a third theory Atmin, who alone existed in the beginniog of things in the form of man, with a view to getting rid of his topeliness, divided himself into tro balses - one male and the other female - and then procreated the various species in the organic world (Brhadāraniala-Up I 4)--) These ard simular other theories are no doubt more of less personalistic (10 contrast to the purely impersonalistic-mate nalistic theones referred to above), but they can by no means be characterized as theistic in the strictest sense of the term 
A mention has already been made of the soclusion of god 10 Some cosmologial theories as a demiurge or a secondary creator It may be added that the demiurge is sometimes represented also as the poner (mājā sahn) or the manifestation (199ha) of the ulinate reality which alope must be regarded as the absolute substratum and source of the unnerse in this context must be mentioted also the imagery of the golden embno in which the first personal creatise being is represented as having himself proceeded from a material substratum in the mythical form, 
128 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
this being is called Hiranyagarbha or Nārāyana 15 Such cosmo logical theories, however, are basically pantheistic and seem to have later developed in the direction of a pale and shallow theism which Hinduism is said to have often “confessed with lips but which has never won the homage of its heart "16 in a more distinctly theistic theory, the creation is represented as a process of manifestation or evolution starting from god The world process is, indeed, regarded as a rhythmic movement consisting of alternate emissions and reabsorptions of the world by the supreme being It is this form of cosmology which usually figures in the Purānic Hinduism Another cosmological theory which is popular vith the Puranas 15 a modification of the original Sānkhya doctrine At 1 later stage in the development of the Samkhya doctrine god came to be superimposed on the prakrilo purusa dualism as having been responsible for bringing prakrti and purusa into contact with each other and thereby initiating the world process Prakrti and purusa came to be regarded as just the two aspects of the supreme lord who, through his guiding and controlling will, gave the first impulse to prahrt to shake off its equilibrium It may be added that, like this theistic Sámkhya doctrine, we also have a theistic Vansesika doctrine which postu lates a god who is responsible for switching on the process of the conglomeration of the eternally existing atoms Thus, by and large, the role of god 10 Hindu cosmological speculations may be said to have been thought of only secondarily, and its scope to have been regarded as very much limited 
Assuming that god created the world, one might feel natu rally inclined to ask oneself as to what could have been god s motive for doing so This motive cannot have been 'love', for, love normally implies the craving for sympathy and fellowship from an entity other than cneself and god is believed to transcend ?l kinds of saying Nor can it have been the impulse to 'work, for, work normally aims at getting onc s needs satisfied or one's

insufficiencies recouped and god is regarded as being free from all Deeds and insufficiencies Similarly, the world annot have been created by god for bis ora benefit, because god is perfect, it cannot have also been created for the benefit of man, because it is characterized by innate requality and cruelty Agjid, in Creating the umperse, god cannot be said to have felt urged to execute any specific plan Indeed, in connection with god's relation to the world, Hırdu thinkers base hardly ever thought in terms of the design, plan, or obect of the world It is sometimes suggested that god created the world because he was moved by some reproductive itapule, by an instinctae urge to multiply hund self, or that it was just a passing sum of god But this would seem to go agaiast the rationality of god Another assumption is that god himself, as much as idan, is subject to some universal 128 which constrains him to create the world Obviously, such an assumption would cegate the oppo'ence of god. According to still another sex, god has created the world with a view to affordiog man the opportunity to redeem himself of his liabilities under the moral lan of Karma (though, it must be added, the law of Kartua is believed to be operating independentiy of god and god in no way predestines the conditions of man's life) This would, on the one hand, account for the requality and cruelty Lo the world withoat miling the creator responsible for them, and world, on the other, emphasize god', solicitude for man whose Journey of the road to mroksa he thus hastens Io a sense, god is keen on facilitating the divinization of man. For, god Is said to desire union with the soul as fen ently as the soul desires union with god Hindaism, it may be pointed out, does not stop with affording only a one-way road, namely, from the soul to god, it provides for a tto-say communicauon between the two 
But the thecry which seems to have been found generally acceptable by various schools of Hindu thought is that the world process is but the sport-lila-of god This Iā which provides an outlet for the eruberant spint of god, is to be thought of just as play for the sake of play Essectially it amoants to the release of 
11 
130 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
energy for the sake of the release of energy 17 The assumption of līlā alone can explain why one who is perfect and self-sufficient does do anything Actually to impute any motive to god's act: vity would mean denying his very god-head Lilā constitutes a motive which is, indeed, no motive at all The assumption of lila is significant from yet another point of view Metaphorically, the word lilā would very well bring out the sense of the miracle of the one appearing as many. It would further suggest the temporal character of the world whose reality is not to be taken with absolute seriousness Again, the concept of lilā, jo its sexual connotation, may be related to the concept of god and his consort Saktı being responsible for the creation of the universe It is also not unlikely that the later Hindu love-mysticism has something to do with this imagery of god's la Of course, it must be conceded that the concept of lilā does not explain away all the difficulties in connection with the question of god's motive for the creation of the world For instance, it fails to rationalize the inequality and cruelty in the world It would seen as if god's sportive instinct was governed by the universal moral law of Karma At any rate, the concept of Gilā cannot be said to constitute any serious philosophical doctrine, it only serves as a fairly satisfactory analogy 
Uolke many other religions, Hinduism is hardly ever repre sented as a system of ethics Indeed, ethics occupies but a midor place in Hindu religious ideology By and large, Hindu thought does not make any sharp distinction between spirit and matter, it thereby discards the very basis of morality The pantheistic overtone of Hinduism must also be said to have been responsible for its amoralism In this connection it is pertinently asked how a tide can sin against the sea In Hindu thought, god is rarely conceived as a moral lord and governor Hindu morality, accor dingly, does not mean obedience to the will of god Profound speculativeness is a distinctive mark of Hindu temperament, and this is reflected in the fact that Hindu religio philosophical ideo 
17 Presumably it u in thu Icnse that TAGORE speaks of the similarity between the cosmic creation and the artis&ic creation 
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 
131 
logy has raised knowledge to a higher pedestal than either morality or devotional worship of god Virtue I», do doubt desirable, but without true knowledge it is rendered futile For a Hirdu thinker the real sin is ignorance it is man's onder standing which is involved in it and not hrs will As has been very tellingly put, the badness of bad conduct lies in that it darkens the vision of truth Socrates says that an enlightened person would generally do no wrong The Hindu thinker seems to assert that a truly enlightened person is always right Accord jag to the Hiodu thought, salvation does pot mean deliverance from so against god, it rather means freedom from avdia The consciousness of moral guilt becomes magifest relatively seldom, and the prayer is usually intended for vision rather than for Pardan 
The attitude of Hinduism in respect of morality is essentially polar. Oo the one hand, morality as such is believed to be in no way related either to religion or to god As apparently immoral act, for instance, is not regarded as being necessarily irreligious Ever the Thogs could claim that their nefarious activities were a part of their religion A saint may be morally extravagant but he is nevertheless religiously much esteemed For, it is through his rigorous asceticism, which may not be necessarily compatible with the conveational code of moral conduct, that the saint is believed to attain a direct insight into the divine mystery Similarly as has been already pointed out, morality, according to Hizdo thought, does not amouot to the conforming of one's conduct to the will of god Nor does it imply obedience to a categorical itoperative At best, morality may be looked upon as an instru ment of social adjustment At the same time, Hinduism is seen to have gone to the other extreme in that it has elevated the doctrine of Karma, which is intensely ethical to the position of an trrevocable cosmic law 
Though most of the Hindu gods have been invested with particular attributes and vehicles, their basic nature continues to be vague and impersonal The individual gods capnot, accordingly, be sharply distinguished from one another Nor can the mututal132 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
relationship among the various gods be said to be clearly defined It may be further pointed out that the nature of individual gods 15 often submerged and lost in the exuberant mythology which has grown round them Unlike the gods of some other religions, the character of a Hindu god as the creator of man and the universe is but little emphasized So far as Hinduism 15 concerned, it may be more apt to say that, instead of god having created man, man has created gods - and that too after his own image Therefore, while, in one sepse, the Hindu gods are vague and impersonal, 18 another sense, they tend to become almost identical with men Many of man's special characteristics are seen also in gods For one thing, gods, like men, are by no means wholly free and independent They are not unoften represented as being subject to the law of Karma Gods, like men, bave their own peculiar religion to which they have to be loyal Indeed, a Hindu god's nature is a curious mixture of the human, the mythological, and the philosophical 
In the course of the development of various views regarding the gods of Hinduism, some landmarks are clearly noticeable As has been already pointed out, in the early Vedic period, people celebrated many gods or devas - most of them embodying the "asuistic" ideology - but no one god in the monotheistic sense In the Upani sads, the supreme being, which was emphatically Asserted to be one and without a second, was more or less comple tely impersonalised The classical Hinduism, which must be said to have largely inherited the religious ideology and practice of the proto historical Hinduism, manifested itself, in its initial stages, la the form of the two major sects, namely, Vaisnavism and Saivism. These sects were almost monotheistic in character - they repre sented a kind of modified monotheism Visnu and Siva were regarded as having, as it were, transcended the hierarchy of mythological gods who were quite numerous, and were headed by Indra, the king of gods and his regents, the dihpālas Besides Vaisnavısm and Saivism there also emerged sects centering round other divinities like Sakti, Surya, and Ganesa - each of them again representing a kind of modified monotheism It must, 
GOD N HINDU THOUGHT 
133 
however, be stressed that these sects, howsomenuch they differed from one another 10 respect of their strength and the atent of their influecce, hardly ever sought to extinguish one anolher On the contrary, 10 course of time and in conformity with the usual trend of development in Hinduism, the fire cults, respectively centering round Surya, Garea, Vistu, Sna, and Saktı, instead of each of them having been regarded as absolute and updependent, came to be regarded as constituting the five steps in a sugle religious echelon 
lo connection with the Bhakti-cuit to the Drandian region, four gods are specially mentioned, namely, " the red one with blue throat" (that ts, Sira ), " the white one of the ploughshare and the palmayra flag" (that is, Baladera )," the blue one with the eagle fag" (that is, Krsna ), and "the nder on the elephant with the peacock flag" (that is, Subrahmyz) A reference may also be made here to gods like Brahmă, Väyu, Agni, Yarom, etc, who had no clearcut sect2r120 afiliations Incidentally, some Buddhist sources speak of three classes of divinides, namely. (1) Yines and holy mea or proptets, (1) defied heroes like Vasudeva and Baladeva, and (w) popular folk-dinjites like 5op, moon, fire, etc 
A briel Dote on the female diyabes in Hinduism would be quite apropos at this stage So far as the proto-historical Hinduism is concerned, it is overwhelmingly domigated by the three-headed horned male god-proto-Siva But, as pointed out cisen here, the worship of " mothers " also sens to have consti tuted a significant feature of that religion As against this, in the hieratic Vedic religion, got much importance is attached to female divities Aditi u the Rgreda, for instadce, is hardly ever invested with the personality and character of the Mother-Goddess as such, while the character of Usas-as also of Prthivi - has been concened by the Vedic poets as being little more than transparently datoralistic Some of the other female divities in the Veda are exther mere colourless female counterparts or wnes of male gods, or otherwise they represent the later deificabon of some abstract concepts It would, indeed, seem that the distinc 
134 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
tive religious ideology centering round the female divinities was essentially indigenous and that it forced itself into the Vedic ideology - though not to any large extent -as the inevitable result of the contact of the Vedic Aryans with the indigenous population of India Two aspects of this ideology deserve to be specially noticed here for one thing, these female divinities are mainly worshipped by the common folk A mention may be made in this context of the gramadeatās – the mothers - like Mariamman and Kottavai of the Tamil country as also of the divinities like Sitala and Manasā They are regarded specifically as“ pegative" divinities in the sense that they are prayed to not so much tbat they may bestow any positive good on the wor shipper as that they may forestall the evils which are likely to befall him Nirīti, Sinivāli, Kubū, and Gungū are presumably the Vedic reflections of some of such indigenous female dividities It would also be seen that, in the Atharvaseda, spirits with feminine names were usually associated with diseases and disasters Such " negative" female dividities are, indeed, quite numerous in popular Hinduism 
The second aspect of the religious ideology relating to the female dividities is far more significant from the theological point of view In this context, one may speak of one goddess rather than of many female divinities This goddess usually represents the personification of the "power" of the great god and is often regarded as his consort The great god is, indeed, the self sufficient, static aspect of the ultimate, but he is believed to have a consort, wbo is both one with and subordinate to him and who alone serves as the motive force behind the world-process It is only through her that the supreme being becomes involved in the cosmic activity Such goddess, for instance, is Sakti On the one hand, she personifies the creative as well as the destructive power of the great god Śiva, while, on the other, she is the great goddess - the mother goddess – in her own right and has an inde pendent religious cult developed round her in the Piñcarátra texis and the Puranas, Laksmi is sometimes represented as the sakni - both from the formal and the material points of view of 
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT 
135 
Nārāyana. It is through her that Närāyan3 passes from his transcendental and undifferentiated form to a form characterised by the six qualities of aistarja The proto-lustoncal counterpart of Sakti s pot as distinctly represented as that of Siva, but the extent of her influence, even in the pre-Vedic times, may sery well be imagined from such of her reflections in the Vedic literature as Vāk (RV X. 125) and Umā (Kena-Upanisad 3 12) Inciden tally, it may be added that the two aspects of the religious Ideology concerning the female diyipities, which have been referred to above, are sometimes seen to mogle with each other 10 a loose manner 
In Hindu religious thought, the concept of Satan or Devil or Prince of Darkness as such hardly ever occurs with any promi nence. A figure like that of the Buddhist Māra is absent in Hindu mythology Tbe sharp duality of superhuman poners with opposite moral qualties - the duality, that is to say, of poners of light and powers of darkness-as, for rastance, ia the Zoroastrian dithetsm, has never been the basis of Hindu religious ideology. The character of Vrtra or Abu of the Rgreda whom Indra vanquishes is essentially different from that of the Devil He cap by no means be said to represent evil personified 10 a single figure The same thing may be said of Ravana, the adver sary of Rāma in the Rāmājana Indeed, Råvana is often represented as a pious and learned Brāhmand Many demonjac antagonists of divine powers have, no doubt been mentioned in the Puranas But they are often shown to possess several good features of character, and they are either quickly overpowered by the gods or actually become the worshippers of gods Many of them have ongupally been great and noble persons, who, for some minor lapses, are cursed to be temporarily transformed into demons The existence of evil is generally said to be the reason for the existence of religioo But this dictum does not seem to hold good in respect of Hinduism 
The doctrine of ararõra or descent of god on the earth marks a new and fairly well-defined pbase in the development of Hudursa It may, however, be pointed out at the very outset 
136 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
that the avatāra-theory has to be essentially differentiated from the primitive motif of a god descending to the earth According to the Hindu conception, god actually appears on this earth in various forms at various times to fulfil certain specific purposes Of course, in his įpcarpations, god does not appear 10 his highest form, which is, indeed, incomprehensible to the mortal eye He assumes a mortal form (either human or animal), but, even in that form, his transcendental power becomes unmistakably mani fest The avatára is not to be understood merely as a transitory manifestation of the deity, it represents a mystic but real presence of the supreme being in a mortal body The anthropomorphism (or, in a few cases, the zoomorphism) is complete in every respect, but there becomes clearly evident a union of infinite divinity on the one hand and finite individuality on the other 
The avatāras must be said to be a special characteristic of Vaisnavısm However, the classical theory in this respect does not seem to have been formulated in the epic period The Mahābhārata, for instance, does not contain any systematic account of the avatāras It is in the Purānas that the scheme of the ten avatāras is fully developed Indeed, the treatment of this subject in some Purānic passages is quite diversified since they give lists of avatāras other than the classical ten The ten incarna tions, in which Visnu is, according to the normal classical tradition, believed to have appeared on this earth, are Fish (Matsya ), Tortoise (Kūrma), Boar (Varaha), Man Lion (Narasimha ), Vāmana, Parasurāma, Rāma, Krsna, the Buddha, and Kalks Räma is sometimes regarded as only a partial avatāra - one balt of the divinity having been divided among his brothers Two other points 10 connection with Rāma are noteworthy Firstly, there is no Purāna exclusively dedicated to Ráma (presumably because Rāma-worship did not offer much scope for Purānic sectarianism ), and, secondly, the divine personality of Rāma had been so conceived that it could be conveniently combined with any other god even with Siva ( as has been testified by the figure of Rameswara) As against Rāma, Krsna is celebrated as a full incarnation or pūrpavatāra As a matter of fact, in some

accounts, Balarama (Krsna's elder brother) is substituted for Krsna as aralēra, for the latter is believed to be god himself and pot bus aratāra In some other aratāra-lists, Krşqa is mentioned after Balarama or in the place of Balarama or in the place of the Buddha 
In the Buddba-incarnation, Visou is supposed to bave been born as the "Deluder in order to mislead the demons with false doctrine and thereby bring about their uodoing That aratūra may also be regarded as being intended for recognizing the personal greatness of the Buddha while, at the same time, depre cating his teachings The tenth and the last aratara, namely, Kalkt, is to appear at the end of the present Kalı epoch Ridung a horse called Devadatta, Kalkı aill overrun the earth, par an end to all evil, poxers, and re-establish moral order 
The germs of some of the avatāras of Visou, such as Matsya, Kurma, Varáha, and Vāmata, may be discovered in the Vedic Legends la some cases, the forms wluch the Prajāpati of Vedisa is seen to base assumed on dutierent occasions have been trans ferred to the Visnu of Hinduisto It is, however, not improbable that Vedism itself had borroned those ideas from the proto-lodian religious thought-complex. We also find that several peculiar features of Vedic Visuu's personality and character are reflected in his classical Hindu aratãras locidentally, it may be posated oot that the Arestan Verethragoa is also said to have appeared in teo incarnations and that some scholars like CHARPENTIER and BENVEXISTE are inclined to connect these incarnations with the araröras of Visnu Further, it is not unlikely that the Hiddo aratăra-theory, the Jaisa tradition of the Tirthamkaras, and the Buddhist conception of the Boddha's mapy births have some genetical relationship 
The Hindu theory of aratāras is significant from various points of view To begro with, it is always asserted that the road purpose for which Visau appeared in his vanous incarnations was to establish moral order in a world which had become spintually dissolute As the Bhagavadgită (IV 7) says Whenever nghi. eousness languishes and varighteousness thrives, theo does god

incarnate himself This moral aspect of the avatāra-theory is emphasized in another way as well, pamely, by suggesting that god, appearing in his avatāra, placed before man a norm which might help the latter in properly Orienting his spiritual life God is believed to have come to man in order that man might become god by following his example The descent of the Divine is regarded as having been intended for promoting the ascent of the individual In this context, Rāma was often represented as the absolute ideal for all humanity, for, the Rāmāyana seems to have portrayed Rima as a man who became god rather than as god who bad incarnated himself as man 
The avatāra-theory also facilitated the transcendent being brought into direct relation with the phenomenal world It is suggested that, from his eternal existence as an incomprehensible undivided unity, god descended into the existence characterised by time and history apd thereby invested with some meaning the otherwise meaningless cycles of time The avatāra-theory was a grand attempt by the religionist to personalize the impersonal reality of the philosopher, not only conceptually but also empiri cally It afforded the unique experience of the One co-existing with the Many, and thereby helped the consolidation of the doctrine of blakti For, the motive for the avatāras, which was stressed as strongly and as often as the establishment of Dharma, was god's desire to show grace and do good to those who were devoted to him and whom he loved Psychologically, a single god manifesting himself in various forms must have adequately met the fancies of different kinds of people The aratára theory also served, from time to time, as an assurance, which was perhaps psychologically much needed, that god did not remain merely an indifferent and uninterested spectator of the world-process but that he duly recognized his role of responsible involvement in it 
From the point of view of the history of Hinduism the avatara theory may be regarded as a major factor in the religious Synthesis brought about by that religion Originally, the different dividities like Rāma, Kțsnı, Parašurāma etc, scem to have beca The gods of different religious cults When, in the course of the

139 
religious history of India, these cults federated themselves to form #hat came to be known as Hinduism some kind of unity of god head was sought to be actueved by those gody being represented as the incarnations of one single god Visou On the other tand, this also helped to elevate the status of the objects of worship of certain primitive cults It may be further poted that the aratase theory generally tended to supersede the philosophical partheism and to promote some kind of tbeology approaching monotheism or at least polytbeism organized under a single gode Incidentally, a reference may also be made here to che suggestion that the sequence of the ten avatāras reflects the various stages 10 the esolution of man himself 
Among other concepts, bich are in some way related to the coccept of araråra but which must ceeds be essentially differentiat ed from it, may be oeationed those of prădurbhana wherein god manifests bunself while remaining transcendent in his true form; tants or appearances in certain specific aspects which laiter may be co-existeot (this concept having been developed more parti cularly in Santism), āresa or enteriag ito and getting possession of some pratika, ribhūtus or special manifestations in eminent entities jūtas or cosmological ard psychological emanations of the supreme being, ribhava or jacarpate form whalb god, in his grace, assumes, from time to time, in order to be accessible to his devotees, antarjām nor god as the inner self of man, and arcâ or the idol-form of god 
One of the striking features of popular Hinduism, as against Vedism which may, in a sease, be said to have culminated in the Upanısadıc spiritualism, is that it seeks to substitute a religion as contemplation by a religion as practice it is in this context that a study of the Hirdu concept of worship becomes relevant The Yedic Aryan religious practice was manly of the nature of home, ihat is, of the offering of oblations to gods, who were pot directly prese3t before the sacrificer 10 the form of idols or images, on the sacred fires in the accompadiment of Vedic mantras With the advent of historical Hinduism, Vedic roma or ritual came to be more or less superseded by a form of worship popularly known as 
140 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
pūjä The centre of the entire procedure of pūjā was the idol or the image or some other concrete symbol of the divinity, which was ceremonially bathed and anointed with sandalwood-paste or coloured powder and to which offerings of flowers, food, milk, sweets, etc, were made in the accompaniment of the racital of mantras and prayers, the ringing of bells, and the burning of lights and incense Actually the pre-Vedic non-Aryan religion -- that is to say, proto historical Hinduism - also seems to have been characterised by some kind of religious practice akın to pājā Naturally enough, dunng the Vedic interlude, homa or Vedic ritual came to be generally recognized as the representative religious practice But in classical Hinduism pūjă was again revived in a highly developed and complex form A third kind of religious practice which may be referred to here consisted of 
Tāntric ritual and worship 
A distictive characteristic of Hindu pūjā is that, in essence, It is a personal activity rather than a congregational or communal performance For a Hindu, pūjā is an individual experience, it is an act of private devotion Temple-worship is, of course, not uncommon but it cangot be said to be an essential constituent of Hindu religious practice The piety of a Hipdu is by no means dependent on his visiting a temple and offering worship there Indeed, many devout Hindus prefer home-worship to temple worship It may, however, be noted that the basic pattern of temple worship is more or less the same as the one indicated above Naturally enough, in temple-worship, the devotees have usually to be content with besog mere spectators of rather than active participants in the procedure of worship Even in the case of home-worship it is only one member of the family who offers worship for the whole family Thus, in the ultimate analysis, the individual's part in worship is limited mainly to his own contem plation of and prayer to the divinity In this connection a special mention must be made of japa or the repeated murmuring of the Dame of the god which is believed to possess deep religio-magical siguificance As for prayer, the religious man seeks to establish, by means of it, a living communion with god conceived AS

141 
personal and present in experience It jmplies, on the one hand, an unfiloching faith in god's grace, and, on the other, one's complete surrender to his mercy 
Scch udividual worship is perhaps of greater spintual valge, bat there is no doubt that the absence of any obligatory worship of a congregatiopal type has, to a certain extent, adversely affected the religio-social cohesion and integration among the Hindas, Hinduism certainly provides for such religious affairs of a communal nature as the recital and exposition of epic and Puranic texts and works of religio-philosophical import, seasonal festival! and pugrimages to sacred places But these cap by no means be $ad to constitute the essentials of religious practice Nor arc they, in any sease, obligatory 
Though, as has been pointed out above, the basic pattern of Hindu worship is more or less fixed, there are often made in it dinerous and minute sanations in accordance with the differeot cults, different divinities, and different occasions Indeed one often wonders shether the diversity of Hindu worship does not actually exceed the duersity of Hodu doctrine A reference to the ritual and worship sponsored by the Tantra schocks would be quite relevant at this stage The Tantric ntual and worstup are more rigorously organized than the normal Hindu ritual and worship The Tantras do not make any distinction in the matter of religious practice on the basis of caste and sex Their ritoal is essennally of an esoteric character and its knowledge is usually trasismitted and preserved through a strict teacher-pupil tradition It comprises of various sexual orgiastic, and bloody rites One of the basic assumptions of the Tantras relates to the almost organic correspondence between man and the universe, and, on the strength of this assumption, the practitioner of Tantric rites Seeks to control the universe through the control of his own body 
ne Taptras also emphasize the religio-magical potence of such Ilems of worsbup as mantra, Janira, bija, etc. Indeed, the Tantras pelieve in magically compelling the divine powers rather than religiously propitiating them,142

• It has been stated elsewhere that, from the strict philosophical point of view, god is only relatively real, that is to say, he is real only on the phenomenal plane Worship of god cannot, accord. ingly, be regarded as of ultimate spiritual value The Brhadă ranjaka-Upanisad (1 4 10) for instance, says “Whoever worships another divinity (than his self) thinking that he (god) is one and he himself another, he knows not" Actually the same Upanisadie passage further suggests that gods do not like that men should know the ultimate truth of transcendental unity, for then they would know gods to hold but a subordinate position and so cease offering worship to them Notwithstanding this predominating philosophical attitude which tends to look upon all rules, rites, and creeds as being part of a lower and temporal order of things, the Hindu is normally not half hearted in respect of his worldly obligations His devotion to god and his zeal and earnestness in the matter of worship cannot brook being called in question The worship of god reflects his genuine response to the supreme reality as conceived on the empirical plane ma response of sear, hope, love, and trust 
Hindu worship is also fegarded as an efficacious means of moral discipline aod spiritual fortification which human life so badly needs Indeed, Hindu worship has a very wide connota tion It does not necessarily imply some deliberate act of devotion As (de Bhagavadgitá proclaims, one who perfornis his prescribed duties exclusively for the sake of lokasamgraha and without being selfishly attached to their fruits must be deemed to be offering the most devout and the most agreeable worship to god Whatever one does in the spirit of true anāsah Ir-yoga is in essence an act of worship - The doctrine of grace must, indeed, be regarded as an essen tial constituent of theistic ideology Some intimation of this doctrine may be discovered in such Rgvedic references as that Varuna chosc Vasistha for his exclusive companionship and, through his mijesty, made him a true scer (Vir 88 4) But it takes its appearance in a fairly developed form for the first time, only in the later religiously oriented Upanisais Already in 
GOD N HINDU THOUGHT 
143 
the Katha-Upanisad (II 23) we are told that this supreme self "canoot be attained by instruction, nor by intellectual power por even through much hearing He is to be attained only by the one whom he chooses' The Vundaka-Upanısad (III 2. 3) repeats the same very But the Stelāraldra-Upanisad is perhaps more expiat on ibus point At one place ( I 6), for instance, it says that the self blessed by the Lord the Moser (prerur), gains Life eterdal, while at another (ITI 20) it actually speaks of drātuh prasāda or the grace of the creator 
The doctrine of grace forms an integral part of the teaching of the Bhagavadgita One of the principal attributes of god in the Bhagaradgira is lose for his devotee Indeed, god is said to be the friend of all beings (V 29) and to be actisely helping man in freemg bimself from the somsāra Several times in the poem, Lord Krsna is seen to have assured Arjuna that "for one who attams to him there does not remain any re-birth’ (VIII 16 ) Mainly through god's grace does one in the eternal immutable realm So, almost by way of his final precept Krsna urges Arjuna to relinquish all the religious duties and betake burself only to him He alone sball deliver him from all sins whatsoever (XVIII 66) 
Io the cpics, and more particularly in the Purānas, divine grace is a frequently occurring religious motif God is said to have assumed finite forms for the sake of the love for his worshippers and in order to free them from the shackles of this worldly existence in the Pancarātra scriptures, this fonction of freeipg the devotee from the sausāra is ascribed to the sudarsana portion of Laksmi, the transcendent chara cter of the supreme lord himself being thereby scrupulously maintained The sudarsana is represented as operating like god's grace and as gradually leading the sell on the way to mohsa or dcineracce However, it may be incidentally pointed out that, 
as god is endowed with the attribute of anugraha or grace he is also endowed with the attribute of nigraha or the power of obstruction by means of which be keeps man bound down to samsāra In the course of the further development of the 
144 
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM 
Vaisnava theism, the doctrine of grace became so basic a theme of its teaching that it came to be unequivocally claimed, as, for instance, in the Narājaniya, that one could attain religious enlightenment not through penance or knowledge or the like, but only as the result of the compassion of Nārāyana 19 The Bhāga. vata Purana glorifies the grace of god as the very crown and consummation of religion. God is god by nature, but man, who is man by nature, can become god by nature through the grace of god The Ārvars sing of god as being condescendingly merciful even to the lowliest among men and bestowing on him his grace 
Rāmānuja, who seeks to give a philosophical foundation to the theistic ideology, has to encounter the problem of the co ordination of the two concepts, namely, the grace of god and the law of Karma With reference to the statement in the Kausitakr Upanısad ( II 8) that 'this one that is, the supreme being), truly, causes him, whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds, to perform good actions, this one, indeed, also causes him, whom he wishes to lead downward to perform bad actions,' he seems to suggest that god's grace does not operate arbitrarily but that it does so in accordance with the law of Karma This does not, however, imply that the law of Karma is something external to or independent of god It is itself the expression of god's mode of action God is the source and substratum of both grace and law of Karma There is, therefore, no question of one of these two being subservient to the other God often employs the law of Karma as a kind of testing erercise for one to whom grace is to be ultimately shown As hinted at in the Bhagavadgita (VI 41-43), the samsära, which is the inevitable consequence of the law of Karma, is inteoded to allord to man an opportunity to qualify himself for god's grace, for moksa in other words, man is subjected to the law of Karma because of god's desire to show him grace and not in spite of it A reference may be made, in this very context, to the two major schools of the Vaisnava theology propounded by Rámānuja The southern school or the

locidentally it may be added that, even in the Sarva theism, the greatest attribute of Su8 « believed to be love and the soul (payu) is said to be dependent for its liberation from the threefold fetter (pasa) of māsā, harman, and árara entirely on the grace of Siya 
While speaking of uberanon (rroksa) one most clearly realise the distinction between its theistic concept and its metaphysical concept From the strictly advanic point of vex, mok sa does not uply any gets state of being to be attained by the soul Indeed, it denotes its original state of being -- the state of what is catchingly alled the "pre-drographical unity” which it teropo. rarily forfeits as the result of ignorance but which it is entitled to regun through true koowledge to this state, the soul transcends time, space, and causality, which characterise the phenomenal world It fuses into the absolute and is thus freed from any further possibility of rebirih Velsa, in this sense, has hardly anything to do »ub god But the religious teisin does not countenance the illusion of the individual self implied by the advaitic absolutism Voksa, according to theism, represents a specific kind of relationship between god and the sop! The

world process, as has been already pointed out, is an unending cycle of emanations and reabsorptions, and the aim of religion is some kind of union or close association of the soul with god beyond that cycle It is also suggested that, through deep contemplation of god, one actually becomes either god or like god But, generally, in the Hindu theism, moksa is not under stood either as union with or fusion into or identification with god It rather means isolation - the isolation of the self from all other things such as the world and the other selves It is, indeed, the isolation of the soul in its essence This kind of liberation is believed to be more desirable than either the annihilation of the soul or its absorption into the vaster spirituality of Brahman The soul is eternal, it has its true being beyond time and space It is just in this sense that the soul is said to participate in divine Dature And, thus participating in divine nature, it persists even to the state of liberation Freed from evil of all kind and having attained all desires, through the grace of god, the soul becomes isolated from the associations of the manifested world, and yet continues to experience the unending and ever increasing love of god 
All Hindu mysticism aims at the transcendence of personality by the soul, eitber through the realisation of complete unity with the universal spirituality or through the total isolation of the eternal in the soul from the temporal in it There has however, been often mentioned still another type of mysticism, namely, loving communion with god even during the state of embodied existence it is in diew of this that one speaks of 'impersonal' mysticism and personal mysticism But, in the ultimate analysis, the experience of mysticism is essentially uniform though that experience is expressed in different ways, such as, through silence or negation or contradiction or superlation Hindu mysticism transcends the tyranny of words usually encouraged by philosophie cal dogmas or religious doctrines It is, indeed, from its mysticism that Hinduism has defiscd its unique attitude of tolerance 
In the history of Hinduism mao s attitude towards god has undergone many changes However, three principal landmarks

may be specially noted in this connection in the early Vedic period, man sought to exert on gods a kind of magically compal sive influence by means of his word (brehran or mantra) and 2ction (Jajña or ritual) In the t'panised c penod, lcosledge of god-or, to be more precise, of the suprece being-came to be regarded as the only source of salvatica ard eteroal 6!155 - though, incidentally, even then, the magic potence of knowledge was duly emphasized To Loon was to attain - indeed, to knon was to become Desire for knowledge, respect for knowledge, and trust in the practical religio-philosophical eficacy of Iton ledge - these continued to be the distinctive features of Hinduism throughout its bistory Tbi Knowledge-partial attitude of the Hirdu was often camed to such an extreme that he got ogoften posited and logically spbstantiated a religion without a god, and persisted in regarding ignorance as a more gneious sin than even the most senous moral lapse It is, indeed on account of this that Hinduism is frequently - though not always justifiably - characterised as 'wisdom' rather than spirituality 
With popular Hinduism, bhalni or passionate devotion to god became the watch ord of religion Blala Cecessarly presupposes the belief m a personal god, who is ofted a diuinity of a popular cult elevated to the status of the supreme being. Before this personal god, man erperiences the feeling of moral mferionty, spiritual imperfection, belplessdess and humility He, Lowever, has unquestioned faith in the grace of god, and, therefore, surrenders before him in a completely self-oblivious manner hop ing thereby to achieve a direct moustic communion with bum which, for a bhalla, cons''utes the ultimate spiritual goal. Some traces of this emotional theism may be discovered in a few hymns of the Rgreda, particularly those addressed by Vasstha to Varuna, but 10 15 in the Sretāstatara- cansad that it seems to have been first formulated into a religious doctrine 1 The rise of various Hirdo sects are a flip to the growth of Maha, and the Porīnic uradi tion that braku was born in the Dravidian country gets bistorical"

confirmation from the fact that the two principal and more or less parallel currents of early medieval theism, pamely, Vaişna vism and Saivism, had their main spring in southern India 
The religion of bhalı generally substituted theology for mythology, but its most outstanding achievement was that it sought to establish the equality of all persons, irrespective of caste, creed, and sex, in the sight of god Of course, both mythology and social distinctions proved too tenacious to be so easily stifled The role of bhakti in the history of Hinduism may be said to have been self-contradictory On the one hand, the doctrine of bhakti served as a unifying force among the Hindu masses who were rallied together, under the banner of religious equality and brotherhood, to counteract the exclusivism of Vedism-Brahmanism, while, on the other hand, the various sects which sponsored that doctrine, each in its own way, tended, in course of time, to consolidate themselves into different castes and thereby encourage the fissiparous trends in the Hindu society 
And now to revert to the question with which we started, pamely, whether the belief in god can be generally said to consti. tute the primary principle of Hinduism Hindu thinkers, as will have been seen, do not start with the certainty of god They seem 
to accept god only as a hypothesis which is not unworkable The historical process of the phenomenal world and man are not dependent on god, on the contrary, gods themselves are believed to be subject to some universal law like the law of Karma The concept of god 18 thus by no means central to Hinduism The Hindu thinker begins with the experience which is most immediato to him, namely, the self He construes god and the phenomenal world with reference to the self-though, it must be emphasized, bis Weltanschauung has not thereby become anthropocentric The German philosopher FEUERBACHI says "God is my first thought, the world my next, and man my thurd and last " In his religious qucst, the Hindu thinker must be said to have proceeded the other way round
