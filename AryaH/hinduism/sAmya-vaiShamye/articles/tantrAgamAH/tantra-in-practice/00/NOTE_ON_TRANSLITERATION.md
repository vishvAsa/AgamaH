title = "NOTE ON TRANSLITERATION"

+++

The works in this volume are translated from many Indic languages, as well as  from the Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan languages. In the case of the Indic  languages, the translators have, in general, adhered to the standard  transliteration system for each of the languages. Certain common place names,  proper names, and selected terms that have entered into English usage on the  Indian subcontinent are shown without diacritical marks. Chinese terms appear  in Pinyin. Japanese terms appear in Hepburn transliteration. Tibetan terms are  rendered in a phonetic equivalent by the translator, after which the term is  provided in Wylie transliteration. Modern place-names and names of modern  authors and editors are transliterated without diacriticals.
