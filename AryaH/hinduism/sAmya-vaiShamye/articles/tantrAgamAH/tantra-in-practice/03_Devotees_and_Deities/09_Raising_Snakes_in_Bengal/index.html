What is Tantra in Bengal? The Sanskrit Tantras important to the region since the fifteenth century list several central elements: selection of the proper teacher; initiation; mantra repetition; fire worship; construction of mystic diagrams (yan tras); image worship; the honoring of young girls as embodiments of the Goddess; cremation-ground rituals performed to gain mastery over death; and the notorious “five M” ritual, in which wine, fish, meat, a type of intoxicating grain, and sexual intercourse (these are the makaras, all of whose Sanskrit and Bengali names begin with M) are used in controlled ritual circumstances - either literally (the hero’s way), through comestible alternatives (the bestial way), or by enjoying mental substitutes (the divine way). Meditative techniques are also crucial to Tantra. The most famous of these is kundalini yoga, or the practice of raising the serpent power through the seven lotus-shaped spiritual centers in the body (cakras) to the top of the head, where she unites with her consort Siva. Each of these cakras - muladhara (at the base of the spine), svadhisthana (at the genitals), manipura (at the navel), anahata (at the heart), visuddha (in the throat), ajna (between the eyebrows), and sahasrara (at the top of the head) - has a different number of petals, with letters of the alphabet engraved on them, and is assigned a resident god, goddess, animal, element, one-syllabled mantra, and sound to be enjoyed as one passes through it. These lotuses are strung on a subtle channel called the susumna, “the path of knowledge” or “the path to liberation.” Flanking it are two more channels, the ida to the left, symbolized by the moon, and the pingala to the right, which represents the sun, whose influence is said to be poisonous, causing attachment to the senses. Especially significant are the beginning, middle, and end points of the journey: the muladhara, where the serpentine kundalini lies coiled three and a half times around the Siva linga, waiting to be awakened and induced to enter the door to the susumna; the anahata, where the Goddess is installed and visualized in the heart; and the sahasrara, where Siva and Sakti,">

  <p>Raising Snakes in Bengal: The Use of Tantric Imagery  in Sakta Poetry Contests</p>
<p>Rachel Fell McDermott</p>
<p>What is Tantra in Bengal? The Sanskrit Tantras important to the region since the  fifteenth century list several central elements: selection of the proper teacher;  initiation; mantra repetition; fire worship; construction of mystic diagrams (yan tras); image worship; the honoring of young girls as embodiments of the Goddess;  cremation-ground rituals performed to gain mastery over death; and the notorious  &ldquo;five M&rdquo; ritual, in which wine, fish, meat, a type of intoxicating grain, and sexual  intercourse (these are the makaras, all of whose Sanskrit and Bengali names begin  with M) are used in controlled ritual circumstances - either literally (the hero&rsquo;s  way), through comestible alternatives (the bestial way), or by enjoying mental  substitutes (the divine way). Meditative techniques are also crucial to Tantra. The  most famous of these is kundalini yoga, or the practice of raising the serpent  power through the seven lotus-shaped spiritual centers in the body (cakras) to  the top of the head, where she unites with her consort Siva. Each of these cakras - muladhara (at the base of the spine), svadhisthana (at the genitals), manipura (at  the navel), anahata (at the heart), visuddha (in the throat), ajna (between the  eyebrows), and sahasrara (at the top of the head) - has a different number of  petals, with letters of the alphabet engraved on them, and is assigned a resident  god, goddess, animal, element, one-syllabled mantra, and sound to be enjoyed as  one passes through it. These lotuses are strung on a subtle channel called the  susumna, &ldquo;the path of knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;the path to liberation.&rdquo; Flanking it are two  more channels, the ida to the left, symbolized by the moon, and the pingala to  the right, which represents the sun, whose influence is said to be poisonous,  causing attachment to the senses. Especially significant are the beginning, middle,  and end points of the journey: the muladhara, where the serpentine kundalini  lies coiled three and a half times around the Siva linga, waiting to be awakened  and induced to enter the door to the susumna; the anahata, where the Goddess  is installed and visualized in the heart; and the sahasrara, where Siva and Sakti,</p>

<p>often as male and female swans, make love, dripping nectar for the tasting. It is  here that the soul achieves liberation and attains the blissful status of Lord Siva.  Often Tantric practitioners will meditate on special seats erected over the buried  skulls of five &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; beings (jackal, snake, dog, bull, and sudra). A final cate</p>
<p>gory of Tantric arts relates to the tantrikas superhuman skills: he can cure with  charms and protective mantras; prognosticate via astrology; and even attain mas tery over nature through special powers. Because of these sometimes eccentric  rituals, and the philosophical principle that worldly enjoyment can be a means  to spiritual realization, Bengalis have often viewed Tantra as the upside-down  path of the mad.</p>
<p>Although each of these topics is praised in the Sanskrit Tantras, they are not  emphasized uniformly by Bengali tantrikas. This chapter investigates what Tantra  has meant to a tradition of Bengali Sakta poets who utilized its themes for their  own purposes. What has been maintained, what ignored, and why?</p>
<p>The tradition of &ldquo;Syama Sangit,&rdquo; or songs composed to the black goddess Kali,  began in the middle of the eighteenth century with a gifted poet and devotee of  the Goddess, Ramprasad Sen (ca. 1718-1775). In more than three hundred po ems of praise, petition, complaint, self-exhortation, and meditative contemplation,  he set the standard for the genre, and his literary followers - over two hundred  as of the present day - have continued his lead in style and content. Two of his  most famous heirs, Kamalakanta Bhattacarya (ca. 1769-1820) and Mahendranath  (Premik) Bhattacarya (1843-1908), mirrored his achievement not only in their  composition of Sakta poetry but also in their religious lives; like Ramprasad, they  too are famed as Tantric adepts. All three have also inspired a hagiographic tra</p>
<p>dition, Ramprasad since the 1850s, Kamalakanta since the 1880s, and Premik  since the 1920s. Contemporary poets continue to add luster to the tradition, with  new poetry collections and recordings appearing every year. One especially fine  example is a man whose pen name is Dinram. Although the introductions to his  published work contain almost no information about him, his literary output  demonstrates that even if he is not a practicing Sakta, he has mastered the imagery  superbly.</p>
<p>I take these four poets as representative of the Syama Sangit tradition; together  they span two and a half centuries and include three men who are household  names in Bengali Goddess-worshiping contexts. Although the Tantric images,  valences, and messages of their poetry are of primary interest here, one must not  forget the hagiographic lore that has grown up, particularly around Ramprasad  and Kamalakanta - and that &ldquo;interprets&rdquo; for us the Tantra of the poets&rsquo; compo</p>
<p>sitions. Such stories, when placed beside the poems they are meant to &ldquo;explain,&rdquo;  demonstrate the disjunction between poetry and commentary.  A caution: Tantric themes, though important to the Sakta poetric genre as a  whole, never touch more than fifteen percent of any poet&rsquo;s total output. This is  true even of Ramprasad and Kamalakanta, the two figures whose Tantric procliv ities are most famed. Far more common are Kali-centered poems of adoration,  supplication, and self-abnegation. Indeed, many poets omit Tantric themes alto-RAISIN G SNAKE S I N BENGA L 169</p>
<p>gether from their compositions. But the fact that contemporary poets like Dinram,  a retired government employee, still incorporate Tantra into their work is evidence  of its continued importance - even if it is ignored or feared by most.</p>
<p>Is the Snake Charmer&rsquo;s Son a Fool? Tantra&rsquo;s Redeeming Features</p>
<p>The most obvious Tantric influences on the Sakta poets are the dhyanas, or icon ographic descriptions of the various forms of Kali, to be visualized in or just below  the heart cakra. The Sanskrit Tantras enjoin the adept to construct a jeweled alter  in a temple of jewels underneath a wish-filling tree, on an island in a sea of nectar,  and to establish the deity there for meditation. As so depicted, Kali kills demons  on the battlefield and then stands triumphantly on the chest of Siva, also referred  to in the poetry as the Great Lord (Mahadeva), the slayer or bewitcher of Lust  (Madana or Kama), and the enemy of the demon Tripura (Tripurari). She is  beautiful - a bejeweled sixteen-year-old - and her vision grants liberation (poem  1). This emphasis upon the installation of Kali in the heart, or mind&rsquo;s eye, is  consistent with the biographers&rsquo; characterizations of the poets: Ramprasad, Ka</p>
<p>malakanta, and Premik were said to be proficient in meditation, which they per formed on their five-headed Tantric meditation seats.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Goddess is not a static icon but an active partner with Siva in  erotic love making (poem 2). Watching this is so intoxicating that it befuddles  the senses and opens the final door for the rising kundalini (poem 3). The poet&rsquo;s  demeanor changes, too; he becomes mad, like Kali&rsquo;s crazy Bengali devotees Ra</p>
<p>makrsna and Bamaksyapa (poem 4) - and like the Goddess herself, who is pro nounced a crackpot for mating in the poet&rsquo;s head (poem 3) and blighting the  creation with her injustice. You must have been on drugs, complains Dinram,  who vows to be compassionate to the victims of her caprice, while nevertheless  refusing to leave her (poem 4).</p>
<p>What about real sexual union? And the five Ms? In spite of the scope given to  Siva and Sakti in the sahasrara, Bengali Sakta poetry makes almost no reference  to the fifth M. This is true of all poets, from Ramprasad to the contemporaries of  Dinram. Indeed, by their stock denigration of the &ldquo;six enemies&rdquo; (lust, anger, greed,  delusion, pride, and envy) and the &ldquo;three strands&rdquo; (goodness, activity, and ig</p>
<p>norance), the poets display their mistrust of earthly passions. With the exception  of a poem by Ramprasad on cremation-ground rituals (poem 5), there are no  poems in the entire Sakta corpus on external rites - whether exoteric deity wor ship or esoteric rituals involving the five Ms. On the contrary, a common theme  in the poetic literature is the uselessness of physical rites, which cannot aid in the  task of raising the kundalini to the city (a common image for the sahasrara) where  there is no darkness, sleep, or unconsciousness. Expecting to find happiness from  the world is like marrying a widow (poem 6). However, one can use the world  to liberate oneself from it. Like the waterpoured into the ear to induce it to drain,  or like the grandson Knowledge who kills the grandparents Worldly Attachment</p>
<p>170 RACHEL FELL MCDERMOTT</p>
<p>into whose family he was born (poem 6), Tantric philosophy encourages a careful  recourse to earthly enjoyments. Hence the importance of the teacher, Srinath, or  the Lord.</p>
<p>Although the poetry of Ramprasad, Kamalakanta, and Premik is thus strikingly  lacking in references to ritual practice of any sort, the legacy of the biographic  tradition is less clear. All three men were known as Tantric practitioners, and one  can still visit the sites of their five-headed seats. However, all three were also  householders. Although Kamalakanta is depicted as a man who learned the five  M practice at Tarapith, a famous Tantric temple in Bengal, his biographers are  quick to point out that he only engaged in the ritual with his wife, and never  ejaculated. Premik deliberately gave up his overt Tantric practices - even ceasing  to use his five-headed seat - when he began to have children, and counseled his  followers to live a spiritual life within the acceptable confines of worldly expec tations. Hence the poets&rsquo; lack of interest in ritualized sex accords with the ori</p>
<p>entation of the Bengali tradition as a whole, which has a stake in representing its  tantrikas as practicing the &ldquo;divine&rdquo; or internalized path. From such a perspective,  watching Siva and Sakti in union is the equivalent of engaging in the fifth M  oneself.</p>
<p>If ritual is not the main focus of the Sakta poets, let us turn to what is: the  intricacies of kundalini yoga. A few poems describe the entire upward journey,  but most focus on a single lotus. One example we have already discussed: the  heart lotus, where one enshrines one&rsquo;s chosen deity and worships her according  to prescribed iconographic descriptions. Another is the ajna lotus, where the three  subtle channels, ida, pihgala, and susumna, come together in a plait between the  eyebrows. This confluence, called the tribeni in Bengali, is said in the poems to  be a spiritual Kasi (Varanasi); &ldquo;bathing&rdquo; in its waters brings the highest spiritual  cleansing and pleasure.</p>
<p>All four of our Tantric poets write about the merits of immersion at this con fluence. One representative sample by Ramprasad is an extended metaphor about  pilgrimage, except that the destination is not a physical site. The horse of the  mind pulls the six-wheeled chariot of the body (a reference to the first six lotuses  of kundalini yoga), with the soul for a charioteer and the two- syllabled Goddess,  Ka-li, as a passenger. Coursing past the five senses and their objects, impelled by  the five vital breaths, the soul reaches Tribeni Ghat, where he refreshes himself  (poem 7).</p>
<p>This type of poem has an odd history in the biographic literature. In Rampra sad&rsquo;s corpus it acts as a proof-text for a story in which the poet plans a trip to  Kasi, but gets only as far as Tribeni - a town in northern Bengal - when the  Goddess tells him that she is pleased with his efforts and requires him to go no  further, since all pilgrimage places lie at her feet. The biographers have external ized the theme of the poem and devotionalized the moral, never hinting at the  embedded poem&rsquo;s Tantric implications. The strain between poetry and biography  is still more pronounced in Kamalakanta&rsquo;s case. He too writes poems on bathing  at Tribeni, and his biography contains an almost exact copy of Ramprasad&rsquo;s pil-</p>
<p>RAISIN G SNAKE S I N BENGA L 171</p>
<p>grimage story. But the poems are not used as proof-texts. It is tempting to con clude that the narrative cloak created by Ramprasad&rsquo;s biographers to obscure the  meaning of the Tantric poems took on such a life of its own that later interpreters  missed the connection between story and poetry. Premik&rsquo;s biography contains no  reference at all to pilgrimage, internal or external, though he too composed poems  on the subject of the Tribeni bath. As poets become less famed and the knowledge  of Tantra less widespread, stories necessary to &ldquo;translate&rdquo; Tantric allusions for a  devotional audience decrease in frequency.</p>
<p>The lotus that receives the most attention is the sahasrara, where the kundalini  meets her mate. The bliss experienced here by the aspirant is encapsulated by  two unusual images: inebriation and moonlight. In translating both through a  narrative venue, the biographic literature is once again at odds with the poetry it  is aiming to illuminate.</p>
<p>All four poets compose songs on divine drunkenness. In a kundalinr yoga  context, the nectar or honey in question drips from the citrini, a narrow channel  within the susumna, the entrance to the final ascent for the kundalini at the  sahasrara. Generated by the blissful sport of Siva and Sakti in union, it is the  drink for which the aspirant thirsts (poems 8 and 9). Real drunkards are not  tantrikas, but those intoxicated by the sense objects, and the truly spiritual can  tell the difference. Ramprasad hints, however, that his erratic behavior may be  more than just a spiritual trope; in defending his right to be &ldquo;unrespectable,&rdquo; since  the Goddess cares for the insane, he may also be justifying the use of wine in a  religious context (poem 8).</p>
<p>Indeed, it is possible that these poems contain veiled clues to the first M.  Ramprasad and Kamalakanta not only devote songs to the subject of inebriation  but also inspire their biographers to frame stories to justify their unconventional  behavior. Both are accused of wine drinking by respected men - sometimes de</p>
<p>picted as Vaisnavas. Ramprasad defends himself by singing about divine nectar.  Although the poem does not make explicit mention of the juice dripping from  the sahasrara, it is clear from other poems in the corpus that this is his intention.  No commentator or biographer ever warns the reader that this is what is being  referred to, and prefers instead to let the poem be read as a devotional reference  to the nectar of Kali&rsquo;s name. Kamalakanta too is defamed as a drunkard, but  instead of singing a song in his defense, he takes the jug of wine he has been  caught with and turns it into milk. Although there are songs in his repertoire that  demonstrate his familiarity with the &ldquo;wine&rdquo; dripping down from the thousand petaled lotus in the head, none is ever attached to this story. The masks created  for Ramprasad&rsquo;s Tantric poems have once again, with Kamalakanta&rsquo;s life story,  gained their independence. No biographer tells the reader that the poets may be  defending the actual use of wine in a Tantric ritual, or that they are definitely  promoting the idea of drinking divine ambrosia in the sahasrara.</p>
<p>A third example of the disjunction between poetry and legend also concerns  the sahasrara: the rising of the full moon. In kundalini yoga, the difference be tween the darkness of ignorance, as experienced in the muladhara, and the light</p>
<p>172 RACHE L FELL MCDERMOT T</p>
<p>of consciousness, as realized in the sahasrara, is explained by comparing the new  moon, where all is dark, to the full moon, where light brightens everything. Thus  when the poets exclaim that they have arrived in a city where the moon always  shines, dripping nectar; where there is neither night nor sleep; and where op</p>
<p>posites cease, they are referring to the topmost cakra (poem 10). Ramprasad and  Kamalakanta&rsquo;s biographers either did not know this or tried to conceal it in a  common story. Both poets are challenged by irreverent contemporaries as to what  day of the lunar cycle it is. When they reply, &ldquo;the full moon,&rdquo; they are ridiculed  for their ignorance; it is, they are told sneeringly, the new moon. No matter. That  night both perform a miracle of self-justification and cause the full moon to rise,  out of season. Poets like Premik and Dinram who are familiar with this Tantric  moon imagery continue to use it in their compositions, though Premik&rsquo;s biogra phers feel no need to explain it away by recourse to his planetary prowess.</p>
<p>The Sakta poets also use kundalini yoga imagery to exhort spiritual awakening  through homey metaphors. The poet is a snake charmer learning his duties (poem  11). His body is a boat, where the kundalini is the mast (poem 12), or a house  where the sleepy mistress lies around with her man (poem 13). Alternatively, the  kundalini is homologized to elements of popular festivals. For instance, Dol, the  Vaisnava fair in which Krsna and Radha are rocked back and forth on a swing  and showered with red powder by their devotees, is used to describe the motion  of Kali seated on the platform of the heart lotus, held by the ropes of the three  subtle channels (poem 14).</p>
<p>In sum, Bengali Sakta poets are selective in their appropriation of Tantric  themes. Meditation is central; human teachers, external rituals, the five Ms, yogic  powers - almost none of these make their way into the poetry genre. It is the  biographers who are far more intent on the poets&rsquo; supernatural powers: their  abilities to command rivers, change the properties of liquids, and control planets.  The fact that the events in these stories bear such a striking resemblance to kun</p>
<p>dalini yoga imagery leads one to conclude that the poems came first, and were  transformed by the contexts into which they were placed. Did the biographers do  this purposely or not? We may never learn. One indication, however, that the  earliest writers may have known what they were doing is a comment by ISvar</p>
<p>candra Gupta, Ramprasad&rsquo;s first biographer in 1853. After quoting one of Ram prasad&rsquo;s most explicit poems about the raising of the kundalini, Gupta says; &ldquo;A  sincere tantrika, with a deep feeling for spiritual matters, will appreciate these  immortal songs; no one else will be able to do so. This subject is extremely  difficult. There are only one or two great souls left who can grasp the significance  and concealed meanings of certain of Ramprasad&rsquo;s poems, in order to explain  them; nowadays almost all such people have disappeared&rdquo; (Isvar Gupter Racand bali 2:23).</p>
<p>Whatever the intention of our poets and their interpreters, three things are  certain today. First, poets writing in the genre continue to draw upon Tantric  metaphors and language. Second, the average person continues not to understand  such poetry, and even if the modern biographers do, they tend not to explicate</p>
<p>RAISIN G SNAKE S I N BENGA L 17 3</p>
<p>it. Sakta anthologies routinely omit poems on kundalini yoga, and recording stu dio employees freely admit that Syama Sahgit does not sell as well as Vaisnava  songs - both because the imagery is so abstruse and because the vision of Kali or  the kundalini copulating with Siva does not fit with the majority view of the  Goddess as Mother, or Ma. Third, although one does not know whether the  evidence preserved in the Sakta songs represents the whole of the poets&rsquo; Tantric  activities - one suspects not - one can understand the reticence an adept might  feel in revealing everything in his poetry. Besides, although the literal use of ritual  substances like wine, meat, and sex might awe the outsider, Bengali or Western,  the tradition itself devalues it. Meditation takes precedence because Bengali Tantra  places the &ldquo;divine path,&rdquo; the path of mental worship, highest in the spiritual  hierarchy. Sanskrit Tantras describe a range of Tantric injunctions. Bengali poets  leave records that - although in an upside-down language - do not ultimately  compromise their respectability.</p>

<p>your head will spin.</p>
<p>The cosmic egg itself</p>
<p>filled with yantras and pierced with mantras</p>
<p>floats in that ambrosial water.</p>
<p>She saves us all</p>
<p>Tantrikas and non-Tantrikas</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t leave your path because of what others say.</p>
<p>Some believe the three strands birth all:</p>
<p>Goodness gives us righteousness</p>
<p>Ignorance feelings</p>
<p>180 RACHE L FELL MCDERMOT T</p>
<p>and Activity deeds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re deluded, Mind.</p>
<p>If you get drunk the conventional way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll fall out of beat, and the Out of Beat Goddess of Death  will take you on Her lap.</p>
<p>Ramprasad says, if</p>
<p>at your final hour</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve abandoned this path</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be shut out.</p>

<p>From the time of the womb</p>
<p>a fire burns;</p>
<p>Come, Mind, let&rsquo;s sit at Kali&rsquo;s feast.</p>
<p>1 am hungry for nectar,</p>
<p>always in search of it.</p>
<p>The flame of my appetite burns;</p>
<p>look at all those delicacies of love</p>

<p>Mind,</p>
<p>why should we go any more</p>
<p>to the world?</p>
<p>Instead let&rsquo;s proceed to that town</p>
<p>where day and night,</p>

<p>the full moon shines bright</p>
<p>no waxing or waning</p>
<p>no opposites reigning</p>
<p>no hunger or thirst and no eating or drink -</p>
<p>everyone plays with delight.</p>
<p>Nectar oozes from an ambrosial moon</p>
<p>but poison streams out from the sun.</p>
<p>With no cakora bird</p>
<p>to follow your whim</p>
<p>and drink to the brim</p>
<p>the moon steals its nectar away. Mind,</p>
<p>he who swallows this poison&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>like you -</p>
<p>going to and fro</p>
<p>forgetting his learning</p>
<p>in the grip of a venomous</p>
<p>burning.</p>
<p>Says Premik:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fortunate person</p>
<p>who lives in that town.</p>
<p>For those who believe</p>
<p>in a personal God, The Unformed</p>

<p>My Mind,</p>

<p>and now you wander</p>

<p>A hunter&rsquo;s son kills birds,</p>
<p>A fisher&rsquo;s son catches fish.</p>
<p>O Mind, if the snake charmer&rsquo;s son is a fool</p>
<p>will the snake spare him?</p>
<p>Playing with snakes is your caste duty;</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t despise those mantras</p>
