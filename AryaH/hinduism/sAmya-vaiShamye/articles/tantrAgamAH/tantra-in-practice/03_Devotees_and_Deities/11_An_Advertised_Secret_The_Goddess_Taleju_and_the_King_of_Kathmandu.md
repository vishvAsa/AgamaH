Bronwen Bledsoe  

The text presented here is an inscription from Nepal, a praise-poem named Sar vaparadhastotra, which King Pratap Malla had hammered into the golden doors  of the temple of the Tantric goddess Taleju in the middle of the seventeenth  century. A public and literary text, the Sarvaparadhastotra offers a concise - if  difficult - instance of Tantra's deployment in one historically specific social  world.  

Mise-en-scene  

In late medieval Nepal, the temple of the goddess Taleju commanded the skyline  of the city-kingdom of Kathmandu, while her principal servants - rulers of a  dynasty named Malla - commanded the world of the Newar people. No structure  in the realm could be build higher than the goddess's imposing temple in the  royal palace at the heart of the mandala-patterned city-kingdom. The Tantric  goddess Taleju was literally and conceptually the most exalted being of the realm.  No one could miss the fact of the goddess's existence or her power, yet access to  her sanctuary was jealously restricted. Full initiation into the method of her wor ship amounted to consecration into kingship itself in the late Malla period (ca.  1600-1768 C.E.).  

And just who might this goddess named Taleju be? There is still no definitive  answer to this question, at least none openly spoken. The name may be derived  from the Newari tale, meaning high or upper, and the honoric suffix ju; thus, "the  deity of the high temple." Or, it may be a transformation of Tulaja, patron deity  of the great Maratha king Sivaji (1630?-1680). In this poem the king addresses  her as Kali, a fierce Saiva goddess with both exoteric and esoteric forms aplenty;  he also calls her Kalika, "little Kali." Both the latter name and certain details of  the poem suggest the authority of the Kalika Purana of Assam. Elsewhere King

Pratap addresses the goddess as Candika, Ambika, Uma, Durga, and Bhavani. No  doubt we are to understand that she is any and all of the Saiva goddess's many  forms. Informed scholarly speculation opines that her true esoteric identity is  Siddhilaksmi, high deity of the Northern Transmission of Kaula Tantra, but Taleju  is not called by that name in public. Just who she is for practical purposes emerges  from her supremacy in the kingdom, and her mastery over the king.  

Pratap Malla (reigned 1641-1674) was perhaps the most flamboyant king ever  to rule in Nepal. Local chronicles and oral tradition remember him as a great  tantrika, a pupil of several famous gurus, and a protagonist of Tantric duels and  deeds of daring. Pratap was a great self-publicist, particularly fond of elaborate  Sanskrit inscriptions, where he where he invariably signed himself "kavindra", or  poet-king. Pratap's favorite topic of conversation was the divine company he kept,  and his favorite conversation partner was the goddess he addresses in this poem.  

Politics and Tantra  

Kings had powers, responsibilities, problems, and potentialities that set them  apart from other mortals. With our modern presupposition of a clear division  between the domains of religion and politics, it might be thought that the proper  concern of kings would be the exercise of power in statecraft, in the sense of  administration and warfare. The historical record is, however, scanty on such  mundane matters. What texts of all types do choose to speak of is the continuing  quest of mortals to integrate their lived world with the worlds of the divine.  Nowhere was this quest of more consequence for society as a whole than in the  case of kings, for their extant words and works all indicate an overriding concern  with what might be called "cosmopolitical order." By this term I mean a social  and/or political order whose constituency was not confined to mortals but was  actively extended at every turn to include divine as well as human beings in a  single conceptual and practical frame.  

Constructing an inclusive cosmopolitical order around a Tantric deity involved  one major problem. Tantric knowledge and practices are by definition secret,  whereas political life must be public. How could Tantra be deployed for public  purposes without compromising its essential secrecy?  

In general, the Mallas negotiated this problem by recourse to what Robert Levy  has called "advertised secrets." This useful oxymoron breaks down as advertising,  calling attention to the existence and importance of private deities, plus secrecy,  maintaining resolute silence on particularities of content. Taleju's conspicuous yet  inaccessible temple is a prime example of the advertised secret rendered in ar 

chitectural terms. Royalty were not the only agents of the period to make use of  the advertised secret: Newar Buddhists and some brahman lineages had also taken  one or another variety of Tantric knowledge as the highest and most efficacious  form of truth. Their deities too were announced and concealed in special archi 

tectural structures; their initiations too authorized roles of privilege in society.  Kings had the responsibility to maintain continuities between sociopolitical 

AN ADVERTISED SECRET 197  

order on earth and an encompassing universe of divine powers. That is, they were  concerned with the lives of the gods, and with the lives of mortals defined as  servants of the gods. In the Kathmandu Valley, temples by the hundreds and  thousands were the principal sites for the articulation of cosmopolitical order, for  service to deities new and old generated complex networks of obligation and  privilege among mortals of all classes. Inscriptions on these temples constituted  a public and permanent discourse on relations of cosmic and mortal power. It is  probably true that only a small proportion of the king's subjects could read the  letters placed on display in inscriptions, and even fewer would have been able to  penetrate the stylized Sanskrit verse. But we should not doubt that most people  would have had a substantial understanding of what was being said. The king  was the foremost servant of the goddess; thus he was foremost among mortals;  therefore he should be served by all other mortals. This was the logic in force.  

The poet-king Pratap did not put the matter so bluntly. Inscriptions were tra ditionally a medium for display of Sanskrit literary virtuosity, and more than any  Nepali king, Pratap turned the subtleties and sophistication of Sanskrit poetic  convention to the articulation of power. His problem with respect to the Tantric  goddess was to speak of her without compromising the esoteric heart of the rela tionship. His solution, I suggest, was to preserve the intimacy of the king/goddess  dyad by overlaying its esoteric heart with a reformulation centered on exoteric  devotion. Within the frame of exoteric devotion, Pratap constructed his own  kingly persona by juxtaposing the special forms of knowledge of which he was  master with a posture of extravagant humility. Among these special forms of  knowledge was his understanding of the goddess's role in the realm as a whole:  she commanded not only him, but his city-kingdom, and ultimately the universe.  As an open and public production, the inscription is amenable to an exoteric  surface reading. But the poem's very construction - through display and con cealment, contrast and camouflage - invites penetration beyond its facade.  

Explicit Arguments and Counterevidence  

The overt message of Pratap's Sarvaparadhastotra, or "Hymn for the Forgiveness  of All Faults," is resolutely exoteric. It is quite possible to read past its esoteric  component with barely a pause. In mood, the poem is confessional rather than  perfection-seeking; goddess and practitioner relate as mother and child, without  hint of erotic charge. Its literary category is stotra, "praise," "eulogy," or "hymn."  Its genre in the conventional division of Indic religious modes is that of bhakti,  "devotion" or "participation." What the poet craves is an intimacy with the god dess that is profound but in no way secret. The poem's overall thrust and over 

riding tone are encoded in an insistent refrain, "O Mother, let my faults be for given! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious."  

The poem's explicit argument centers on the king's abject failure to accomplish  what he should have accomplished, namely, service to the deity - service in the  form of worship and knowledge, or at least exquisite eulogy. The obstacles to her 

198 BRONWE N BLEDSO E  

service, his lapses, and his inadequacies are inventoried and examined one after  another. The impossibility of achieving her grace through individual effort is  argued in the first half of the poem, which presents obstacles and inadequacies  by category. It opens with four strong verses on the impediments entailed in the  various stages of life: infancy, childhood, youth, and old age each constrains mind  and body in some way to prevent her worship. Then the king speaks of the failures  of paths (margas) and performative practices (vidhis). Orthodoxies include re 

vealed and "remembered" brahmanical wisdom, esoteric knowledge and practice,  simple acts of devotion performed by bodily and mental faculties - according to  the poem, the king has succeeded in none of these.  

One important result of the inventory of failures is to focus attention on Pratap  Malla. It is the figure of the poet-king, not of the goddess, that is carefully con structed throughout the stotra. The critical point in the poem's construction of  the king is the status of the faults or failings (aparadha) around which it revolves.  The word aparadha could be taken more strongly: "offense" or "outrage" is not  going too far. In large measure, the force of the poem derives from the tension  between the king's self-deprecation and the mass of internal and external evidence  to the contrary.  

Few of the poet's statements concerning his failings can be taken at face value.  Some are indeed rooted in human inevitabilities, as with the age-determined  constraints on mind and body. Most demand active interpretation. One clear  example is the king's apology (at verse 16) that the goddess's worship had not  been performed at her temple at festival time, through his "wrong-headed neg 

ligence." This is extremely unlikely, for the Festival of the Nine Nights (navaratri)  was and remains a great state occasion, hardly subject to lapse. Elsewhere (verses  11-12) Pratap exhorts his body's limbs and senses - ears, tongue, nose, thoughts,  spirit - to partake of her, and then laments that he did not do so. Again, one  must wonder if it were possible for him not to have performed these acts. What  Pratap must mean is that he has in fact done all of these things, and yet something  eludes him. Other portions of the poem, such as the difficult quasi-esoteric verses  (6-10), are hard to understand at all without supplying this sense of oblique  dissatisfaction. (My translation does so.) "Failings" or "faults" here serve to prove  discriminating excellence, in a way that boasting could not.  

The text itself offers evidence contradicting the poet's self-deprecation. The king  calls himself feeble-minded, yet he gives voice to keen sensibilities, and in poised  and polished Sanskrit verse. Speaking to the goddess, he calls himself a child, yet  his signature epithets outside the poem proper address mortals in proud and  magisterial tone:  

Thus ends the Sarvaparadhastotra composed by him who excels in all fields of ex pertise, including war, book-learning, and music, the ruler of great rulers, the lord  of Nepal, the great scholar, the lord of the circle of all kings, the supreme king of  kings, the most worshipful poet-king, Jaya Pratapa Malla.  

With regard to the goddess, the king is all humility; with regard to men, he is  all majesty. As he serves, so should he be served.A N ADVERTISE D SECRE T 199  

The king's expertise as a master of knowledge and as a master of men comes  into active play in the latter portion of the poem, where the stock refrain gives  way to specific inflections, and the deity's merits are moved to the fore. Particu larly significant is Pratap's account of the way the goddess pervades the polity  and integrates the world of mortals. Specific margas are still said to be inadequate:  the competing doctrines of Vaisnavas, Saivas, and Buddhists - among others - all miss the mark set forth as paramount; that is, they fail to truly serve her. Yet,  argues the poem, she is integral to each approach: the brahmanical Gayatri mantra  is the goddess personified; the Vaisnava goddess Laksmi and the Buddhist Vajra varahi are none other than she; she is even the abstract principle niyati ("neces sity") of the non-theist Mimamsa school of classical philosophy. Pratap knows  that "She is the One whom all margas serve." (We should note that the followers  of these other margas may themselves have known nothing of the sort.) She is  the one who pervades the city-kingdom and renders it auspicious, a sahkari na gari. The same phrase implies that she belongs to both the cosmic order of Siva  and its citizenry on earth. Pratap's knowledge of unity in diversity is ultimately  political, for it manages both to affirm and subordinate the contending views of  ultimate truth that flourished in his realm.  

And what of the poem's overt message concerning methods of approach to the  divinity? None of his many efforts has succeeded in bringing the king to the state  he desires, which is total intimacy with the goddess. The poem of devotion ap pears to be his last hope. Can we therefore take it that bhakti-style submission  was truly Pratap's preferred mode of relation to the goddess? More broadly, is  this really evidence that in late medieval Nepal, Tantra was thought to be a less  efficacious approach than emotional bhakti?  

Bhakti and Tantra  

Precisely what the Sarvaparadhastotra has to say on Tantric topics is unfortunately  not altogether clear. Published transcriptions of the poem present variously prob lematic readings, and direct access to the lettering on the golden doors is not  readily obtained. The three verses (6-8) that pertain directly to Tantra may have  been somewhat obscure in their own time, for the poet's intent seems to have  been simultaneously to display and to camouflage an initiate's special knowledge.  In modern times, the problem of construing technical terminology in an exoteric  framework is yet more difficult. From the number of points at which the poem  touches upon esoteric topics, it is clear, however, that among the paths of ap 

proach to divinity alternative to that of bhakti or self-surrender, it is in Tantra  that success might have been expected.  

The poem's final verses offer an important closing reflection on the goddess's  grace. Because tantrikas of all six Kaula schools of transmission (sadamnaya)  achieve success (siddhi) at her pleasure, so does Pratap hope that she will be  pleased with his poem of praise, and thus forgive every conceivable sin. The  juxtaposition of esoteric and devotional approaches makes the important sugges-

200 BRONWEN BLEDSOE  

tion that poetry is the sadhana (perfection-oriented practice) of the king - the  king as devotee, that is.  

The discussion in this paper has followed discursive convention in treating  bhakti as an approach to divinity distinct from other Indicforms of religious  practice. The bhakti mode is usually glossed as devotionalism, emotional in na ture, with humility and self-surrender as key stances. As such, bhakti is distin guished from Tantra's esotericism on the one hand, and the ritualism of profes sional liturgies on the other. More technically, the term bhakti - a derivative of  the verbal root bhaj, "share" or "participate" - refers to the project of mortal par ticipation in the very being of the deity concerned. In this sense bhakti may be  an important component of both Tantra and professional liturgies. The Sarva parddhastotra is, however, centered on emotion and devotion.  

Two other important contrasts between bhakti and Tantra are pertinent to the  question of what texts such as the Sarvaparadhastotra meant in late medieval  Nepal. The first is bhakti's amenability to aestheticization in self-consciously lit erary endeavors: Tantric texts typically have a different thrust and texture entirely.  Similarly, the sorts of intimacy that Tantra and bhakti respectively seek to establish  between worshiper and deity pertain to entirely different domains. Devotional  bhakti is appropriate to exterior and public contexts; esoteric Tantra is predicated  on privacy and concealment.  

My suggestion is that in the Sarvaparadhastotra - and throughout his inscrip tional career - Pratap Malla used bhakti as the public face of Tantra. The fact of  his relationship with the Tantric goddess was no secret; in important senses, it  was the pivot of late Malla kingship. But articulating that relationship in the verbal  medium and in the public realm required Tantra's paraphrase or overlay, and the  bhakti brand of intimacy was eminently suitable for purposes of display. Bhakti  added an exoteric and aesthetic dimension to the relationship without compro mising its secret core.  

This introduction to the Sarvaparadhastotra has tried to relate Pratap's inscrip tion to the lived social world of its particular time and place. All the evidence  indicates that the problem which most engaged agents of the period was that of  constructing the world of mortals for maximum interface with the worlds of  divinity. The problem for the late Malla kings was to deploy power ultimately  referable to Tantra for real-world political purposes. Pratap's poem makes it clear  that the knowledge that bound devotee to deity constituted the conceptual center  of the cosmo-political order realized in his realm. Far from being a free-floating  text, the inscription's situation as a physical object in the real lived world is also  highly significant. Emblazoned on the golden doors of Taleju's high temple in the  heart of the city, the inscription - like the temple itself - advertised the secret at  the pivotal point of the city-kingdom's life.  

If what is at stake here were only Pratap Malla's poems, or only the history of  late medieval Nepal, consideration of inscriptional texts would be tangential to  the greater study of Tantra. But the larger point is that Tantra in practice - real  historical practice - must always negotiate some interface with the public gaze,  for even in maintaining secrecy its practitioners shape the social world.

Transcriptions of the Sarvaparadhastotra have been published several times. Tran scriptions show significant variations, corresponding in part to the three times  Pratap had the poem inscribed at different sites, none of which is open to foreign  researchers. My translation follows the unpublished reading graciously supplied  by the learned Gurusekhara Rajopadhyaya Sarma of Kathmandu. The textual in tegrity of the inscription is best retained in the edition published by Yogi Nara harinatha et al. in Samskrta-sandesa 1 (Kathmandu, 1953): 26-30. Naraharinatha  transcribes the stone inscription Pratapa Malla had erected at the shrine of the  goddess GuhyeSvari in N.S. 780, or 1659/1660 C.E. More readily available is the  reading supplied by Gautamavajra Vajracarya in his Hanumandhoka Rajadarabara  (Kathmandu: Nepala ra Esiyali Adhyayana Sasthana, Tribhuvana-Visvavidyalaya,  1978), pp. 225-27'. This transcription is of the poem embossed on the doors of  Taleju's temple, in or near N.S. 792, or 1671/1672 C.E. At pages 208-9 of the  same work, Vajracarya presents an earlier version of Pratap's poem, carved into  the now-crumbling stone bath of an inner courtyard of the Kathmandu palace  between N.S. 772 and 773, or 1651-1653 C.E. Most problematic is the reading  of Taleju's doors by D. R. Regmi, in his Medieval Nepal, vol. 4. (Patna: the author,  1966), pp. 97-101. Regmi does not supply a date, but inserts the inscription in  sequence at N.S. 775.

Homage to the thrice-illustrious Kalika.  

1. The sort of anguish felt by the child, whose body is tortured by the garland  of flaming digestive fires producing waves of piss and shit, reborn from his  mother's cavernous womb as a result of past evil's excess,  

Can someone like me, or one still more simple-minded, describe it?  O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

2. In childhood's painful state - incapable of knowledge, in a body wet with  its own filth - one cries constantly because it is impossible to say what hurts,  and because one is greedy to drink milk,  

In this state, which is totally dependent on others, there is not even recol lection of the mother who makes suffering cease.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

3. Wealth and youth feed egoism, and that mind-set respects no one. I adored  sexual games with women, and became so enchanted with this foul adoration  that not for a moment did I adore you, the Primal One, the most deserving of  those who deserve to be honored.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

4. In the decrepitude of old age - which consists of diseases starting with  coughing, wheezing, and being bent over, when walking and breathing are like  punishment, and the heart finds pleasure only in eating - one's thoughts are  empty of her who is Made of Pure Thought,  

When I am sinking into Death's snare, befouled by my own filth, and worries  grow ever greater,  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

5. I was unawakened in yoga, I was inattentive to the commands of the Veda  and indifferent to the orthodox smarta path, I lacked the power to apply myself  to Samkhya metaphysics and the like, I had no ears to hear talk of governance  and conduct.

My thoughts lack focus even when turned to praise and reflection on you,  who are Speech Embodied.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

6. Located like the Supreme Siva at the Brahma-lotus atop the head, you were  never worshiped through mental acts, nor were you worshiped by means of  external rituals, such as those performed in the yantraraja by me, even though  my thoughts were pure,  

Though every act was faithfully performed, fire-oblations and the rest, still  none really reached you.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

7. In my material body composed of the five gross elements, and of Brahma  and other deities, I did not honor you - who are eternal in the form of mantra  and the Inner Sound, who are the Queen of Breath, who are Made of Pure  Thought - 

I did not honor you by means of the unparalleled sacrifice of evils cut like  animals with the sword of knowledge, because the blaze of desire and anger is  brighter than the sun and moon.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

8. She is that which moves in the element-free subtle body, and in the mind,  and in the essence of the self as known through insight; she is transcendent,  an extraordinary thing composed of bliss, whose own self consists of ultimate  truth,  

And yet she is hidden from me. I have not even for a moment managed full  consciousness of her subliminal presence.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

9. Dhata [Brahma] in the form of a lotus, Hari [Visnu] in the shape of a lion,  Sambhu [Siva] as a ghost - these gods who are portions of yourself serve as  your illustrious vehicles at particular times,  

But I am just a mortal who does not know single- and multi-forms at the  time of sacrifice.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

10. You merely fixed your gaze on the best of yogins and that Great Lord - scorcher of Madana, bearer of the trident, holder of the bow - became the Lord  of the Simple, for his heart was stolen away,  

So how shall I, of the dull and wandering thoughts, offer elegant verses of  praise to you?  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  11. Ears! Listen ceaselessly to the stream of goodly descriptions of her.

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

12. Feet! Go forth to circumambulate daily. Hands, do puja! Head, bow your self in reverence. Heart, do continuous japa. Spirit, go to the state of absorption  in her!  

But I, who am deeply corrupt, did not perform your worship by sharing in  Bhavani thus.  

O Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Kalika, Treasure of Victory, be gracious.  

13. Let her be served - by those who have realized that wisdom, wealth, land,  all forms of grandeur, immortality, and the like are but trifles made of fear,  mixed with a little happiness, and thus doomed to be consumed by Time,  

With body, speech, and mind let her be served - by those who have realized  that she and Sankara are One, for she is made of Endless Bliss, she is the  Woman of the Beautiful City, she is the blessed Sankari of our City.  

14. Neither in fate, nor in the opinions of the Kapalikas and their like, nor in  the collected Vedic teachings, nor in the doctrines of the Vaisnavas, the Sau gatas, the Saivas, the Sauras, nor of those who put Ganesa first, nor in the path  of devotion to the guru, nor in the service prescribed by the Kaulikas who  teach the rules for your observances, with perpetual, occasional, and other rites,  In none of these is your worship accomplished.  

Mistress of the afflicted! Protect me who takes refuge at your feet.  

15. You are the Gayatri of the Vaidikas, Daughter of the Ocean (Laksmi) of  the Vaisnavas, Mahesi of the Mahesvaras, according to the categories of doc trine on earth, Vajravarahi of the Saugata yogins and, further, Necessity of the  Mimamsakas.  

Mother, let my faults be forgiven! Treasure of Victory, the One whom fol lowers of all margas serve.  

16. Kali! Even at a power-seat pleasing as this, even when festival time came  around, the puja of your two feet was not openly rendered, due to my wrong headed negligence. Thus you have been slighted, but don't be angry with fool ish me, who has come to take refuge in you.

But how might I sing your praises? Even this poem is no true praise. Mother  of Speech, be content with what has been uttered by the illustrious King  Pratapa.

Every single fault of mine, overlook it! O sea of compassion, O Devi Kali!  

Thus ends the Sarvaparadhastotra composed by him who excels in all fields of  expertise, including war, book-learning, and music, the ruler of great rulers,  the lord of Nepal, the great scholar, the lord of the circle of all kings, the  supreme king of kings, the most worshipful poet-king, Jaya Pratapa Malla.
