"Shoot me into Krsna,"  

Antal told desire,  

and performed the rites that made it happen.  

The poet known as Antal, who called herself Goda, lived in the early ninth cen tury, in the deep south of the Indian subcontinent. She performed Tantric rites  of the Bhagavatas and described them in her poems, excerpts of which follow.  Bhagavata theology and the stories of her life will introduce them.  

Bhagavata Theology  

"Bhagavata" is the ancient name for the devotees of Vasudeva Krsna who believe  him to be the human manifestation of the brahman they name Narayana. Today  they are more commonly known under the less precise name of Vaisnava. Brah man, a neuter noun, signifies the infinite power of beginningless being and be coming. Narayana, a masculine noun, defines the brahman as "the abode (ayana)  of humans (naras)." The name Narayana means that the brahman in whom we  live and move and have our being, in essence, is personal in a manner impossible  to comprehend. Narayana is the Supreme Person (parama-purusa) of the Rg Veda  and is the Supreme Self (parama-atman) of the Upanisads. Narayana, essentially  formless, is the source of all consciousness and being whose innate power of  creativity (maya) produces all forms.  

The form Narayana first imagines through maya is Vasudeva-with-Laksmi in a  realm called Vaikuntha composed of a supremely pure mode of matter (suddha-

sattva) beyond our reckoning. The non-dual Vaikuntha is changeless, transcen dent to sun, moon, and fire, and any who reach it do not return to space and  time. Vasudeva-with-Laksmi (Tirumal) is the primordial "Father-Mother," the  highest mode of Narayana that beings can worship. Through maya, Vasudeva with-Laksmi makes formations (vyuhas) of himself to produce the cosmos and  us, and differing forms (murtis) to act for us and to be served by us. Notable  among these are three goddesses (devis) called Sri (kingship), Bhumi (the material  realm), and Candika-Durga (victorious conquest); three gods (devas) called Visnu  (pervading sustenance), Siva (destruction), and Brahma (emanation); and two  humans called Balarama and Krsna. All the while, however, the formless Narayana  at whose "center" Vasudeva resides with Laksmi remains imperishable, omni present, and unthinkable.  

The name Vasudeva repeats the meaning of Narayana, but more intimately. It  means "God (deva) in whom all things dwell (vasu) and who dwells (vasu) in all  things." Laksmi denotes his auspicious and properous sovereignty. With her,  Vasudeva is known as the Bhagavan, "Possessor of Glorious Excellences" by which  he-with-she acts to conceive the universe at the uterine "center." As the Bhagavan  in the form of Krsna said to his friend Arjuna, "My womb (yoni) is the transcendent  brahman, and I plant the embryo (garbha) in it; the arising of all living beings  comes from that, O son of Bharata. In all wombs, O son of Kunti, whatever comes  into being with a form, the transcendent brahman is the womb, and I am the  father who gives the seed" (Bhagavad Glta [BG] 14.3-4). Just as the fetus resides  within the womb of a pregnant woman, the universe resides inside God as if God  were a pregnant king.  

Perception of Vasudeva in Vaikuntha is the purest wisdom possible in Bhaga vata thought and the content of omniscient knowledge (jnana). In the end, how ever, this is Vasudeva's gift, normally given to those of undefiled consciousness,  which means that in the Kali Yuga few will receive it, for in our time, passion and  ignorance overwhelm everyone. Only by omniscient knowledge can anyone know  who he or she truly is and act accordingly; without it, a soul (purusa) will live  forever inside the wheel of time (samsara-cakra) at Narayana's "center," propelled  by a profound anxiety (bhayam) that will cause it to cling to ephemeral objects  for a security they can never give. Anxiety generates desire (kama), which, when  frustrated, produces anger (krodha), causing greed (lobha) to emerge. Desire, an ger, and greed are doorways to painful purgation and ceaseless wandering (BG  16.21-24).  

Nevertheless, Bhagavatas believe there is hope, for by means of maya, Vasudeva  appeared as Krsna very near the end of the previous age, the Dvapara Yuga. He  was born in the city of Mathura on the Yamuna River in northern India through  the warrior aristocrat named Vasudeva and his wife Devaki, who at the time were  imprisoned. Miraculously, Krsna escaped the prison to join his elder brother  Balarama in the household of Nanda, the chieftain of the cowherd village of  Gokula. Nanda and his wife Yasoda mistakenly thought Krsna would inherit the 

208 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

position of cowherd chieftain; he was therefore known as Gopala ("Protector of  Cows"), Govinda ("Lord of Cows"), and Govardhana ("Increaser of Cows").  Krsna and Balarama were human modes of the Bhagavan, but not equally so.  Balarama, the elder, embodied omniscient knowledge (jnana) and its indefatigable  power (bala); like the purity of insight, his skin was white. Krsna, the younger,  however, embodied the complete Vasudeva; like our deluded Kali Yuga percep tion of God, his skin was dark as sapphire.  

Krsna as son of Devaki appears briefly in the ancient and esoteric Chandogya  Upanisad of the Sama Veda, but the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana (here after BP) develop that identity at great length. The epic Mahabharata, for example,  contains as its theological center the secret teaching that Krsna gave Arjuna after  he had abandoned his cowherd disguise: this is the famous Bhagavad Gita, "Song  of the Possessor of Glorious Excellences." There he revealed his identity and the  mysteries of our existence (BG 7). Along with Buddhists, Jainas, and Saivas in the  early centuries B.C.E., Bhagavatas spread throughout the Indian subcontinent, tell ing the story of Krsna and Balarama and establishing their worship. For those  who thought of Krsna only as a great hero and lover, his first name "Vasudeva"  was a patronym; but for those who believed him to be Narayana, it referred to  his true identity as God. By the ninth century C.E., the Krsna story and cult had  been in southern India for at least a millennium, and Antal, thoroughly immersed  in both, was intensely in love with the Dark Cowherd.  

Antal in History  

In her poetry, Antal calls herself Kotai ("Garland"), which in Sanskrit is Goda  ("She gives cows"). She lived in Villi's New Town, which she calls Putuvai ("New  Town") and is known today as Srivilliputtur; it lies about forty miles southwest  of the Pandya capital, Madurai, the "southern Mathura." New Town's newly con 

structed temple, facing east, housed a long stucco icon of Vasudeva reclining on  a huge snake in his form as Madhusudana, "Slayer of Delusion." That icon de picted the theme of maya at the beginning of the universe, which Goda and her  father Visnucitta creatively developed through their skill in ritual visualization  (dhyana).  

The Madhusudana story begins after the previous universe has disappeared  into the waters of darkness within Vasudeva's womb. Vasudeva has "eaten" the  universe, has kept it unmanifest in his "uterine center," and now at the end of  "night," it has emerged in the form of his first-born son, Brahma (BP 8.17-19).  Once awakened, Brahma's nature of purified Passion will enable him to reorganize  himself into the universe, following the guide of Veda or sacred knowledge. The  reclining icon in New Town's temple represented the last part of that primordial  night known as "Brahma's Hour" (brahmamuhurta).  

According to the story, this time when Brahma awoke in the lotus-womb, two  asura demons named Madhu and Kaitabha (Delusion and Passion) had stolen theTANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 209  

Veda. To assist Brahma, Vasudeva became Purity (sattva) in the form of a person  with the head of a horse (Hayagriva) - a visual allusion to the mantras of Veda.  Horse-head then descended into the waters of darkness, tricked Deluded Passion  into leaving the Veda unattended, seized it, and carried it up to Brahma. While  the asuras were searching in the dark waters for their deceiver, Purity removed  his horse-head form and took on the form of a white-skinned man lying on a  snake and sleeping - a visual allusion to the mantras of Tantra. Yet Purity was  not really asleep, for he had allowed maya to envelop him in the "Sleep of Unified  Consciousness" (yoganidra), a state of complete awareness that only appears to be  sleep. When the asuras embodying Deluded Passion found him, they mocked his  white body and snake bed, and attacked. Immediately, Yoganidra released Purity,  who then arose, battled the asuras, and slew them on the thigh of his own white  body. Brahma was now free to express his undefiled passionate nature by trans forming himself into the universe for a new daytime. Thereafter, that form of  Purity was known as Madhusudana, "Slayer of Delusion."  

That cultic background explains why Goda made Yoganidra, "Sleep of Unified  Consciousness," central to her rites. After Brahma had emanated space and time,  Yoganidra appeared within it as Goddess Candika-Durga, famous for slaying  asuras with her spear, as told in the "The Glorification of the Goddess" (Devi  Mahatmyam). She embodied the Bhagavan's brilliant conquering power (tejas).  Yet Goda did not address Yoganidra as Candika-Durga, but as Pinnai, or as Nap 

pinnai, "the lovely Pinnai," a figure in Tamil Bhagavata tradition who was Krsna's  beautiful "cousin-to-be-married." Having entranced Krsna with her alluring  beauty, Pinnai lived with him as wife in his cowherd parent's house. Still, Candika Durga is part of Pinnai's identity. In Sanskrit poems, Pinnai is known as Niladevi,  the "Dark Goddess," but Tamil poems call her Aymakal, a name whose double  meaning is revealing. Aymakal can mean "Cowherd (ay) Goddess (makal)," who  is the cowherdess Pinnai; at the same time it can mean "Goddess (makal) who  Strikes (ay)," who is Candika-Durga. Pinnai plays a crucial role in both of Goda's  poetic works, and we shall return to her shortly.  

The historical account of Goda is slim, known primarily from her poems and  those of her father, Visnucitta. They belonged to a brahman caste called Veyar  that specialized in music and served in temples. In New Town, Visnucitta was  known as "Lord of Priests" (Bhattapiran), adept in the art of visualization and a  devoted servant of Krsna. He apparently provided garlands of fresh lotus for the  daily rites in New Town's temple, and he interpreted his own name, Visnucitta,  to mean "Whose mind is a temple housing Gopala" (Tirumoli 5.4.11). In one  poem, he identified himself with the Pancaratra Agama, the mixed Vedic and  Tantric liturgy of the Bhagavatas, for he said that his family lineage was branded  with the Wheel and Conch that the four-handed Vasudeva Krsna holds in his  back right and left hands, respectively (Tiruppallantu 6-7). That branding is a  Pancaratra rite of purification.  

The origins of the Pancaratra Agama remain obscure, but evidence points to  its presence by the third century B.C.E. in both the northern and southern portions 

210 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

of the Indian subcontinent. Bhagavatas who followed that Agama believed that to  supplement the rites of the Veda, which in theory are restricted to males of certain  classes, Vasudeva in his various formations (vyuhas) revealed the ritual knowledge  now contained in the texts (Samhitas) of the Pancaratra Agama. He addressed  that knowledge specifically to people living in the Kali Yuga, including females  as well as males, low castes as well as high castes, the innately "defiled" as well  as the innately "clean." Followers of the Pancaratra Agama believed that it pos sessed powerful mantric rites to "clean up" the impure, notably the "Man-Lion  Consecration" (narasimha-diksa) taught in the Satvata Samhita, perhaps the oldest  literary form of that tradition now available. Once cleansed, initiates could then  receive consecrations that gave them access to mantras, icons, mandalas, and  temples in their worship, all of which were believed to be based on the Veda.  

In contemporary India, the Sri Vaisnava tradition (sampradaya), which de scends from the famous eleventh- to twelfth-century acarya Ramanuja, follows  the Pancaratra Agama. Its initial consecration includes a purifying sequence of  rites during which the initiate is branded by the acarya on his or her shoulders  in imitation of Vasudeva Krsna. Once marked, that devotee is Vasudeva's purified  possession, a "slave" who in bodily form now represents the "master" to the world.  Such devotees, called prapannas or refugees, are then qualified to receive further  consecrations if they wish. Each consecration requires commitment to specific  disciplines of daily life and ritual practice (sadhana) to attain a specific religious  goal, for example worldly longevity and prosperity, or emancipation from time  and space altogether, or both.  

According to Goda, her father was a religious virtuoso, "the king of those in  New Town who do not swerve from the enjoyment (bhoga) of God." He followed  a ritual practice or sadhana focused on temple worship. As part of his offerings,  it appears, he sang and mimed the poems he had composed while absorbed  mentally in the inner visions (dhyana) they portrayed. Goda said that his behavior  stimulated others: "our Lord reclining on the cobra bed is wealthy and great, so  what can we mere humans do to reach him? But in Villi's New Town, Visnucitta  makes his deity come in a powerful way and then we see him" (Nacciyar Tirumoli  10.10). The numerous Tamil poems her father composed to the cowherd Krsna,  collected as the Tirumoli ("Auspicious Speech"), earned him the title, "Great Saint  Immersed in the Consciousness of God" (Periyalvar).  

Visnucitta projected onto the reclining Madhusudana another story about the  deluge of Brahma's "nighttime," this one concerning the seer and great scholar of  Rg Veda known as Markandeya (Tirumoli 1.1.6 and 2.2.6). The story appears in  Mahabharata 3.186-87 and a "corrected" version appears in the Bhagavata Purana  

12.9.20-34. One day, it says, while Markandeya engaged in visualization at his  ashram, God gave him an experience of maya. Markandeya suddenly found him self totally alone in the dark waters of the cosmic deluge, floundering, it seemed,  for years. Then he saw a shining baby boy lying on the leaf of a banyan tree,  sucking his foot. When he approached the leaf, the dazzling infant inhaled the  seer into his mouth. Suddenly inside the baby, Markandeya now saw the entire 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTA L'S POETR Y 211  

universe and his own ashram. The baby, of course, was Vasudeva, who had  "eaten" the universe and would, as a mature male, emit it again through his own  lotus-womb as his son, Brahma. Suddenly, the baby exhaled Markandeya, and  he found himself back in the dark waters. He realized he had met the brahman  of Veda in a manner beyond his own understanding of the Rg Veda and took  refuge in him. Suddenly again, Markandeya found himself back in his ashram,  meditating.  

Krsna's cowherd mother Yasoda had similar experiences. One day while she  was nursing him, Krsna yawned, and Yasoda saw all things, moving and non moving, inside his mouth (BP 10.34-37). Another time, Yasoda was told that her  little boy Krsna had eaten earth. She grabbed him, but Krsna denied it. He offered  to open his mouth to prove it, and when he did, she saw the universe inside. But  through maya, Krsna allowed her to forget (BP 10.32-45).  

Visnucitta's visualization of the reclining Madhusudana as the baby of the deluge  who was also the baby Krsna changed the icon's identity permanently. Today he is  known in Sanskrit as "He who reclines on the banyan leaf (Vatapatrasayi), and in  Tamil as "He who has the banyan leaf for his great palace" (Vataperunkoyilutaiyan).  Following in her father's liturgical footsteps, Goda then added another story of even  greater cultic impact.  

Antal in Hagiography  

The hagiography of Goda explains her vision of the reclining icon. It is longer  than the historical story, more widely known, and is the basis of her annual  marriage to Krsna in Srivilliputtur. Written down in the twelfth to thirteenth  centuries, it depicts Goda as so passionately and single-mindedly attached to  Krsna that she first compelled him to wake up from Pinnai's bed, and then she  compelled him to marry her. That is why she received the title Antal, "She who  rules Krsna." Their union was so literal, the story says, that after Visnucitta be 

trothed her to Krsna, he processed her in a palanquin northward to the island  temple of Sri Rangam in the Kaveri River. There she walked into the temple's  sanctum, climbed up on the altar, and disappeared into its long and reclining  stucco icon, known appropriately as "The Handsome Bridegroom."  

To explain how that could happen, the story says that Antal was an avatar of  Goddess Earth (Manmakal or Bhumidevi). At the beginning of the Kali Yuga,  Goddess Earth appeared as a newborn under a basil plant in the garden of the  New Town temple. Goddess Earth, who is maya as the material universe, is noted  for her patient separation from Vasudeva, in contrast, for example, to maya as  the prosperous kingship (Sridevi), who is always with him. In order to experience  union with him even while remaining separate, however, Goddess Earth took a  human form; it was a gracious act, for right at the beginning of the Kali Yuga she  exemplified the goal of uniting with God in perception while remaining separate  from him in body. Visnucitta found the baby, raised her as his daugher, but when 

212 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

she grew into sexual maturity, her extraordinay passion for Krsna revealed her  true identity.  

Antal, the story says, was highly skilled in the practice of visualization. Krsna  was no longer alive on earth, but out of her longing for him, she perceived Villi's  New Town to be his cowherd village, and the Madhusudana Temple to be the  house of his cowherd parents, and its sanctum to be his bedroom where he slept  with Pinnai. So adept was she, raised a brahman girl, that she lived like a cowherd  girl and even smelled of sour milk. Out of that transformed consciousness, the  story says, she composed her poems for the benefit of the Kali Yuga, the Tiruppavai  and the Nacciyar Tirumoli. Not surprisingly, the rites we find in those poems do  not avoid desire or burn it up, as ascetic renunciants might try to do; rather, they  stimulate desire, harness it, and use it to focus the five senses - with the mind as  sixth - on Krsna.  

The Tiruppavai and Communal Rites  

In Tamil, Tiruppavai (hereafter TP) means "Auspicious Pavai," and in Antal's poem  the term pavai has three referents: Yoganidra as Goddess Candika-Durga; the rites  performed for the Goddess during the month of Margali by unmarried girls; and  the vow (nonpu or vrata) those girls made to perform those rites for the thirty  cold mornings of the Margali month. That month, known in Sanskrit as Marga 

Sirsa, ends at the winter solstice day; Krsna had identified himself with it in the  Bhagavad Gita 10.35. The committed girls would arise in the cold before the dawn  of each Margali day, gather a drum and other ritual implements from the head man's house, go together to the river, bathe, and then fashion an image of the  Goddess from sand. As a group they would then worship her for practical benefits  in the year beginning with the winter solstice. For the sake of the land and its  people, they asked the Goddess for regular rainfall; for their own sake, they asked  for a good husband.  

Although the hagiography provides a rich theological interpretation of Antal's  poems, the history of Goda, thin as it is, provides insight into her profound genius.  Goda based the thirty stanzas of Tiruppavai on a Margasirsa temple ceremony  prescribed for Bhagavatas by the Pancaratra Agama. Onto that ceremony she vi 

sually projected the rites of the Goddess's bathing vow; she then visualized the  actors of that vow, herself included, as cowherdesses living in Krsna's village of  Gokula, far to the north, in the previous age. Out of that complex perceptual  patterning she spoke a poem believed by Sri Vaisnavas to contain the essence of  the Upanisads. It was so important to their famously learned teaching priest  (acarya) of the eleventh to twelfth century, Ramanuja, that he was known as the  "Pontiff Devoted to the Tiruppavai" (Tiruppavai-jiyar). Having spoken out of a  desiring consciousness focused on Krsna, her words now embody that conscious ness as mantras do the brahman; any adept singer of them will become immersed  in the consciousness that produced them. 

TANTRI C RITE S I N ANTAL'S POETR Y 213  

In early ninth-century New Town, we may reasonably conjecture, observant  Bhagavatas arose during the last hour of each Margali night, gathered at the tem ple's sanctum, and sang songs as they waited for the priest to open the doors.  They then addressed the newly awakened Madhusudana directly and offered him  songs in Sanskrit and Tamil, the special foods he enjoys, and their own loving  service. For thirty days they fed him, but fasted until the last day, when in his  iconic presence they gathered to eat the sweet milk-rice, rich with the ghee in  which he delights.  

Of those thirty days, the full moon was the most important, and the Tiruppavai  describes it. Goda envisions male and female Bhagavatas rising in the predawn  hour as cowherdesses gathering to worship the Goddess in the Yamuna River.  Those same Bhagavatas standing at the door of the temple's sanctum she sees as  cowherdesses at the door of Krsna's bedroom. She hears the songs they sing as  cowherdesses calling out to Pinnai to open the door so that they might ask Krsna  for the drum essential to their Goddess rites - for as the headman's son, he is its  keeper. When the priest finally opens the sanctum doors to reveal the awakened  Madhusudana, she sees him as Pinnai opening the bedroom door to join the  cowherdesses, who now admit to Krsna that they had really come for him - the  drum was merely a pretext. All they want is the desire to serve him as they would  serve a husband, but for "seven times seven rebirths," which means forever in the  wheel of time. In her last stanza, Goda says he fulfilled their request.  

Later commentators noted that the cowherdesses in the Tiruppavai do not go  off alone for solitary union with Krsna, but remain together; they unite with him  collectively, as if bathing together in the cool waters of his stunningly beautiful  presence. Here erotic imagery depicts communal experience as it does in the  famous "Dance of Delight" (rasa-lila) described in Bhagavata Purana 10.29-33.  Dancing in a circle in the Vrndavana forest, Krsna appeared to each cowherdess  as if he were with her alone, and yet they were all there together, united in their  focus on him. Shared love of the Supreme Male is the basis of human community,  Bhagavatas believe, for all souls in relation to God are like dependent females:  their own fulfillment comes from giving God pleasure in the way servants give to  a master, or polygamous wives give to a shared husband.  

The Nacciyar Tirumoli and Solitary Rites  

Equal in fame to the communal "Dance of Delight" is Krsna's special love for a  single cowherdess (BP 10.30). Later northern tradition knows her as Radha; earlier  Tamil tradition knows her as Pinnai. Apparently, communal "bathing in Krsna"  on the full moon day of Margali was not enough for Goda, who wanted to be  alone with him as a unique lover like Pinnai. Goda could not have literal sexual  union with Krsna, of course, because he was no longer alive as a man. He was  bodily present now in icons of wood ,stucco, stone, or metal; or in the teaching  priest (acarya) on ritual occasions; or in her own visualizations. 

214 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

Being adept in visualization, Goda sought solitary union with Krsna through  it. She sought the enstatic consciousness called samadhi. Her method was to  envision herself as Pinnai, Krsna's cousin-to-be-married as she grew in Gokula  from a child of about five to full sexual maturity at the age of twelve when Krsna  was sixteen. Out of those visions she produced the fourteen poems called the  Nacciyar Tirumoli (NT), "The Venerable Beloved's (nacciyar) Auspicious (tiru)  Speech (moli)."  

Of the fourteen poems of the Nacciyar Tirumoli, eleven consist of ten stanzas  and three of eleven. In the first poem, translated below, Goda describes the rites  of her ritual discipline (sadhana). She had begun the sadhana on the winter solstice  day, the first day of the month called Tai, immediately after the Margali rites of  the Tiruppavai. She continued it through the following month called Masi. Now,  she tells us, she is on the first day of the following month called Pahguni, when  the vernal equinox falls, and is looking forward to its full moon. Her sadhana  thus extends from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox, the period of slowly  increasing heat in southern India that matches the increasing heat of her passion,  felt especially in her swelling breasts, which "will go into no other mouth than  Govinda's" (NT 12.4) In the poem she begins her sadhana's climactic sequence  of daily visualizations, producing a poem out of the experience of each day except  for the last; the samadhi she attained on the full moon day apparently left her  speechless.  

In the first poem, Goda describes her rites as centered on a mandala, a cosmic  mapping, that she had ritually drawn on the ground outside the temple sanctum  during the month of Tai. In the meantime, she had laid a fire and had performed  appropriate rites for the season, including, it appears, commemoration of Siva's  burning of the God of Desire (Kamadeva), which made him bodiless. Any doubts  about Kama's reality thereafter, however, she banished, and used his name in 

scribed on a wall to represent his bodiless presence. By addressing Kamadeva  outside of herself, she addressed the passion inside her that propelled her toward  Krsna, who in these rites stood as an icon over three hundred miles to the north,  on the mountain called Venkatam. Her rites took her in processions on New  Town's streets (verse 6), involved priestly chanters and the leadership of her  acarya (verse 7), and her own fasting (verse 8). Her acarya appears in verse 7 as  Visnu in the form of a Dwarf, a small man who embodied the owner of everything,  including the initiate (BP 8.15-23); that is, the status of the acarya infused with  mantras during consecration (diksa) rites conducted at a mandala. In the rite, he  touches her body to divinize it, and she envisions this to be Krsna's loving touch.  

Goda's ritual focus on Kamadeva as "Churner of the Mind" (Manmatha) reveals  her Pancaratra liturgical context. Kamadeva derives from the Preeminently Mighty  Formation (Pradyumna-yyuha) of the Bhagavan. In Krsna's later life as ruler of  Dvaraka, this formation appears as his son and heir-apparent, Pradyumna, who  looked just like his father. Pradyumna was born to Rukmini, but he had a younger  half-brother named Samba, born to Jambavati. Samba embodied Skandadeva,  God of War. Pradyumna and Samba were Desire and Anger as Krsna's sons, which 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 215  

means they were expressions of Vasudeva Krsna himself. That is why Goda ad dresses both in the poem: desire for, and anger at, Krsna are modes of his "Pre eminently Mighty" Pradyumna presence.  

Goda's remaining thirteen poems describe her visualized journey to samadhi.  In the second poem, she introduces herself as the child Pinnai building sand  castles that the older Krsna - "Narayana praised with a thousand names who was  a man" - playfully kicks down (NT 2.1). Each poem captures a scene in Pinnai's  life as she swells, like the Pariguni moon, to full sexual maturity and intense desire.  In poem 3, her sexual maturation has begun: While she is bathing with other  cowherdesses in a pond, Krsna steals their clothes and teases them erotically. "We  won't do that," she says, "it's not right - You're a boy and you know these things,  don't be in such a hurry" (NT 3.2). Following the conventions of ancient Tamil  poetry, in poem 5, her breasts have swollen with pleasure and give her grief, and  she has already met her lover in secret; he penetrated her, stole her "bangle," but  did not show his face. In desparation she addresses a huyil bird in passages trans lated below. He has to marry her to save her honor, yet as time goes by, he does  not come, and so, in poem 13, she breaks into a rage: "If I see Govardhana, I'll  grab my fruitless breast by the root, rip it out, and throw it on his chest, and then  I'll be free of my burning" (NT 13.8). But she retreats quickly: "If only he would  take me to his superbly auspicious chest, then, if one day he looked me in the  face and told me in truth to leave, still it would be wonderful" (NT 13.9).  

Goda also weaves into her poems a pilgrimage route that she must have made  at least once by palanquin, oxcart, and foot. She begins her envisioned pilgrimage  at the temple in New Town, where the icon is sculpted reclining. Then she visually  moves northward to icons sculpted in various postures - sitting, reclining, or  standing - housed in the temple in Madurai, in the mountain temple of Alaga 

koyil, and in temples along the Kaveri River. For example, at the closed doors of  the reclining icon in Kumbhakonam, she says to her visualized companions:  

I was initiated into the vision of the Black God  

Krsna,  

And in my pure state,  

Don't stand there talking of his beauty  

as if pouring acid in a wound,  

Take the gold cloth from the room of the Bhagavan  

who doesn't know women's sorrow  

And throw it over me  

to end my withering.  

NT 13.1  

She completed her envisioned pilgrimage route in the Pallava capital of Kan cipuram, the last major stop before the Venkatam mountain about sixty miles to  the north. The pilgrims she would have met returning from the forest shrine  appear in her last poem as Pinnai's friends. As the selected stanzas translated  below illustrate, they tell her they saw Krsna walking in the Vrndavana forest

toward which she is headed. The final stanza, moreover, makes it clear that she  would attain her goal, for it refers to a well-known story of Gajendra, the king of  elephants, caught by a "grasper" in the lake of ordinary sensual pleasure. After  struggling for a thousand years and near exhaustion, Gajendra remembered Va 

sudeva, mentally took refuge in him, and asked him to free him - not from  "grasping" sensual desire, however, but from ignorance. Instantly, Visnu ap peared, slayed the "grasper," and took the stout-legged "Indra of Elephants" to  Vaikuntha, never to return (BP 8.2-4).  

Despite the journey she embedded within her visualizations, Goda remained  at the mandala in New Town during the rites underlying her fourteen poems; she  traveled only in her consecrated and impassioned mind. She attained, we are told,  what all pilgrims seek, the end of ignorance and the emergence of omnisicent  knowledge (jnana), whose content is Vasudeva Krsna.  

For the Tamil texts of Antal's poems, I have used P. Annangaracaryar Swami's  edition of Tiruppavai (Kanchipuram: P. B. Anangaracaryar, 1962) and Nacciyar  Tirumoli, 5th ed. (Madras: P. B. Annangaracaryar, 1966). For Sanskrit texts and  English translations, I consulted Swami Tapasyananda, tr., Srimad Bhagavatam:  The Holy Book of God, 4 vols. (Madras: Ramakrishna Math, 1982); R. C. Zaehner,  tr., The Bhagavad-Gita: With a Commentary Based on the Original Sources (London:

Excerpts from the Tiruppavai  

1. Margali month and the full moon,  

what a grand day!  

If you're going to bathe, let's go  

You well-adorned wealthy girls  

of the herders' town flowing with riches!  

The son of Nanda the cowherd,  

man of sharp spear and ruthless deeds,  

The young lion of Yasoda,  

her eyes full of beauty,  

He with the body dark like a cloud  

with red eyes,  

a face like the sun and moon,  

Narayana himself,  

Will give us the drum,  

And people of this land will praise us,  

So plunge in, everyone, O my Goddess.  

2. O you who live on earth,  

Listen to the deeds we do for our Goddess:  

We exalt the Transcender's foot,  

who sleeps lightly on the Sea of Milk,  

We don't eat ghee, we don't eat milk, 

218 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

Before daybreak we bathe,  

But we don't paint our eyes,  

We don't braid flowers in our hair,  

We don't do what isn't to be done,  

Nor do we spread evil words around,  

But we do give gifts and alms to the limit,  

And we ponder the path to life,  

Rejoicing, everyone, O my Goddess.  

3. The Exalted One grew tall to measure out this world,  And if we extol his name and bathe,  

saying it's for our Goddess,  

All the land will be free from harm,  

For with rains three times each month,  

carp will leap in fine paddy growing tall,  

spotted bees will slumber in blue waterlilies,  

milkers without qualm will enter, sit,  

seize swollen teats, and tug  

as bounteous great cows overflow their pots,  

Unceasing wealth will abound  

For everyone, O my Goddess.  

4. Ocean-deep Lord of Rain, hold back nothing,  

Plunge into the ocean, lift up its water,  

Roar and soar high with a body dark like the Deluger,  

Flash like the Wheel he holds,  

he with a lotus navel  

and shoulders of power and beauty,  

Thunder like his Conch curling to the right,  

And without delay  

like a rain of arrows shot by his Bow,  

Pour down on earth for its thriving  

So we may bathe in Margali rejoicing,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

5. Coming in purity to the Owner of Maya,  

hero of everlasting Mathura in the north,  

chief of the Yamuna pure and deep,  

jewel lamp blazing in the cowherd caste,  

child with a rope tied round his belly  

bringing radiance to his mother's womb,  

We scatter bright flowers and worship,  

We exalt him with our words,  

Ponder him with our minds,  

And, they say, our past faults,TANTRI C RITE S I N ANTAL'S POETR Y 21 9  

and even those yet to come,  

Will become like cotton in a fire,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

18. He is a bull elephant in rut,  

His mighty shoulders never flee,  

He is Nanda the protector of cows,  

And you are his daughter-in-law,  

O lovely Pinnai,  

Won't you with coiled and perfumed hair  

Open the gate, please,  

for cocks are crowing all around us,  

and look, on the madhavi bower,  

flocks of kuyil cry out over and over;  

So that we may sing the names of your husband,  

As you hold the ball in your fingers,  

Won't you come  

with graceful bangles tinkling  

And with with your red lotus hand  

Open the door,  

Rejoicing everyone, O my Goddess.  

19. A standing lamp burns,  

While stretched out on a smooth bed  

of the five finest qualities  

over a frame with tusks for legs,  

You rest, holding on your full-blown chest  

The breasts of lovely Pinnai,  

clusters of flowers blooming  

in her coiled hair,  

Speak to us, please;  

And you there with those long shadowed eyes,  

Won't you let your husband awake from sleep  

even for a moment?  

Look, can't you stand to be apart  

even for a second?  

That's not your nature, not your way,  

Please open up,  

Rejoicing everyone, O my Goddess.  

20. You led the thirty-three Immortals  

and dispelled their fear,  

Such strength is yours,  

please wake up;  

You are faithful, you are brave, 

220 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

You are the Uncorrupted who gives  

sorrow to your foes,  

please wake up;  

And lovely Pinnai, best of women,  

breasts soft, small like pots,  

mouth red, waist slender,  

O Sri,  

please wake up,  

Give us a fan,  

a mirror,  

your husband,  

So we may bathe this very moment,  

Open up, please, rejoicing everyone,  

O my Goddess.  

27. O Govinda, you always slay the enemy,  

for such is your sovereignty,  

And in praising you we shall take the drum,  

Receive your largesse,  

And with gifts the land extols - 

bracelets and armlets,  

rings and baubles for the ears,  

anklets and many other jewels - 

We shall adorn ourselves, dress in cloth,  

We shall be served milk-rice covered in ghee  

flowing down our elbows,  

And sitting together with you we shall be cooled,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

29. In the small hours of morning we come and serve you,  Praising your golden lotus foot and no other,  

Listen please to the meaning of this,  

for you too were born in the caste  

that grazes cattle for a living,  

so don't go on not taking our intimate service,  

Because, keeper of cows,  

Today isn't for taking the drum - 

Every day for seven times seven rebirths  

We will relate only to you,  

We will slave only for you,  

So please dispel any other desire we may have,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

30. The finely dressed girls with moon-bright faces  

Approached and revered Kesava, 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 221  

who was Madhava  

churner of the sea of ships,  

And there received that drum,  

as told in a garland of classic Tamil by Goda,  

the daughter of the best of priests at lovely Putuvai  

whose garland is fresh and cooling lotus,  

While here whoever recites these stanzas  

all thirty  

without error,  

Will receive holy grace from wealthy Tirumal  

with four vast mountainous shoulders,  

red eyes,  

a brilliant face,  

And will dwell in delight everywhere,  

Everyone, O my Goddess.  

EXCERPTS FROM THE NACCIYAR TIRUMOLI  

POEM ONE  

1. The whole month of Tai  

I purified the ground  

and laid a graceful mandala,  

And from the first day of Masi  

I decorated the streets  

with fine sand and made them beautiful,  

0 God without a body,  

And wondering, "Will I ever live?"  

1 worshiped you and your younger brother - 

You can appoint me to the Lord of Vehkatam  

Whose hand holds the incomparable Wheel that spits hot fire,  can't you?  

2. I decorated the streets with fine white sand,  

I immersed myself in a pond before the sky grew light,  

I fed thornless branches into a fire,  

Enduring those things for you, O God of Desire - 

You can take a flower full of honey for an arrow,  

Write on it the unique name,  

"He the Color of the Ocean,"  

And shoot me into the singular target,  

"He Split the Mouth of the Bird,"  

can't you? 

2 2 2 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

3. Taking flowers of intoxicating sweet fragrance  

And the blossoms of coral trees  

I worshiped your feet three times a day,  

And when my heart burned and said, "He is not real,"  

I refused to say it and did not slander you at all - 

You can take a cluster of blooming flowers for an arrow,  

Write the unique name "Govinda" on it,  

And shoot me into the singular lamp,  

"The Mysterious and Wise Herder,  

Resident of Vehkatam,"  

can't you?  

4. I wrote your ancient name on a wall,  

Showed you auspicious flags with shark emblems  

And horses and ladies waving yak-tail fans  

And sugarcane war bows  

And gave them to you,  

Didn't you notice, O God of Desire? - 

Since 1 was young my full breasts have craved constantly  

and have swelled up,  

But I have resolved they are only for the Lord of Dvaraka  

And have been worshiping you,  

For you can make that happen quickly,  

can't you?  

5. My full and swelling breasts meant for the Supreme Being  Whose body bears the Wheel and the Conch  

Are like the food set aside by brahmans  

in the fire sacrifice  

for the gods dwelling in heaven - 

So if you say they are meant for a man,  

That would be like a fox that wanders in a forest  

who enters, licks, smells,  

and picks over the food,  

And I won't go on living,  

don't you see, Manmatha?  

6. Every day I appear on the street with handsome men  And young men and learned men  

And skillful reciters of hymns,  

Observing the days of Panguni perfectly,  

O God of Desire - 

So you should be gracious and make him  

who is the color of a black cloud  

and the color of the purple kaya flower  

and the color of the sky-blue karuvilai  

( 

TANTRI C RITE S IN ANTAL'S POETR Y 223  

Look at me directly with his auspicious eyes  

In his splendid face the color of a lotus,  

don't you see?  

7. I cook green paddy with sugarcane  

And I cook aval from fresh rice with brown sugar,  

And I worship you with the mantras of Brahmins with good voice,  O Manmatha - 

So you will give me the greatest glory in this world,  

The experience of the Thrice-strider  

who long ago measured out the land,  

Touching me with his auspicious hands  

on my lustrous belly and soft full breasts,  

won't you?  

8. With my body tarnished,  

My hair disheveled,  

My lips colorless,  

And eating only once,  

0 splendid and able God of Desire,  

Don't you notice the vow I endure? - 

Don't you see my lord,  

Only one thing is left to say:  

Be gracious in a way that crowns my womanhood  

And grant me this boon,  

"She will seize the feet of Kesava the Beloved."  

9. Worshiping three times a day,  

Venerating your feet,  

Tossing pure flowers in worship,  

1 sing your praise,  

Yet flawlessly I serve him alone,  

He whose color is the sea that surrounds the earth - 

And if I don't receive true life,  

I shall run wild  

and weep  

and wail  

and cry out "Mother!"  

And that will disgrace you entirely,  

don't you see,  

Just as if you had yoked an ox to the plow  

and worked it  

but never gave it food.  

10. By venerating the two feet of Lord Kama  

whose bow is sugarcane  

and whose arrows are flowers, 

224 D . DENNI S HUDSO N  

And by saying,  

"The one there who ripped off the tusk  

of the incomparable roaring elephant  

and split the mouth of the bird,  

he the color of blue gem,  

set me aside for him,"  

Goda, daughter of Visnucitta,  

king of those who live in New Town  

where storied houses spring up in abundance like mountains,  Composed this garland of Tamil with desiring love,  

And those adept in reciting it will,  

without a doubt,  

Reach the feet of the King  

of those dwelling in Visnu's realm.  

POEM FIVE (EXCERPTS)  

1. Just because I take pleasure in the Lord of Spring,  

that man the color of black gem  

wearing a jewel crown,  

Is it right that I lost my bangle? . . .  

2. That spotless one holding a sparkling Wheel  

in his left hand  

Didn't show his body to me,  

But penetrated me  

And hurt me  

And all day as my life pours out,  

He dances about, watching. . . .  

3. I haven't see that hero coming anywhere. . . .  

4. O kuyil, my bones melt,  

The lids of my splendid spearlike eyes  

won't close,  

And many days now I've been tossing about  

in the sea of sorrow  

without the boat Vaikuntha,  

But you, too, know the ache  

a lover's separation gives,  

Don't you? . . .  

5. Longing to see the golden feet  

of him who lives in Villi's New Town,  

My eyes fight like fish  

And I can't sleep. . . . 

TANTRIC RITES IN ANTAL'S POETRY 22 5  

6. The Lord of Senses  

whom gods everywhere worship and praise  

Pains me,  

And the beauty of my white pearl teeth  

and my red lips  

and my breasts  

Has vanished. . . .  

7. Longing to make love to him  

who sleeps on the billowing Ocean of Milk  

My breasts swell with pleasure  

And boil my spirit over  

To grieve me. . . .  

8. But that man  

whose powerful broad hand  

bends his bow  

Is a gentleman and decent,  

And we have an agreement between us  

That only he and I know. . . .  

9. O kuyil, I've been caught in a snare  

the color of a young parrot  

Called Sridhara, Bearer-of-Kingship. . . .  

If you want to live in this grove,  

You'd better tell him  

who holds the Conch and Wheel  

To come,  

And you'd better make him  

Bring my golden bangle  

And give it back. . . .  

10. He measured the world that day  

and I desire him,  

But in his slavery  

he treats me cruelly,  

I didn't know the way I would suffer  

when the southern breeze  

and the moon  

cut me through,  

If you want to go on living in this grove,  

O kuyil,  

Don't hurt me - 

Go tell Narayana to come today  

Or I'll chase you right out of here. . . .

POEM FOURTEEN (EXCERPTS)

Left me to suffer

eating everything,  

reeking of sour milk,  

Did you see him?  

Yes we saw him, indeed,  

There in Vrndavana playing with others,  

his garland of wild flowers  

flashing like lightning in clouds.  

3. The beloved Lord born as Desire,  

The bridegroom who creates Desire  

and tells all kinds of lies,  

Did you see him coming here?  

Yes we saw him indeed,  

There in Vrndavana under Garuda's wings  

Vinata's son stretching out  

to protect him  

from the spreading heat above.  

8. The gracious and auspicious Tirumal  

holds a white Conch  

wears a golden Cloth  

has a Wheel  

Have you seen him?  

Yes we saw him playing in Vrndavana  

Standing with bunches of fragrant flowers  

Coiling around his broad shoulders  

like a swarm of drunken bees.  

9. "Create the universe," said the Lord  

who is Purity itself,  

And in play gave Brahma and the others  

The cool and large flower of his navel  

to make into a home,  

Have you seen him?  

Yes we saw him there in Vrndavana  

Where he entered the wilderness  

to hunt down Dhenuka,  

the elephant  

and the bird,  

And slew them instantly.

10. In Vrndavana here on earth,  

Visnucitta's Goda saw the Supreme Being  

who was gracious to the elephant  

of stout legs,  

And whoever believes her words  

to be medicine,  

Living with them constantly in mind,  

Will exist forever at the feet of God  

whose legs, too, are stout,  

Never to leave.
