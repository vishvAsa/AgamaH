The Wedding of Siva and the Goddess  

in the Kulalikamnaya  

Teun Goudriaan  

In our endeavor to understand the Hindu scriptural tradition in its astounding  variety, we have to set up a number of distinctions as guidelines for our analysis.  But such distinctions should not be understood as so many watertight compart ments, because these hardly ever exist in Hindu religiosity. Two instances of such  analytical preliminaries are the distinction between "ideology" and "practice" in  the Tantric traditions, and that between "Tantric" and "Puranic" religiosities or  literary traditions. The translated Sanskrit text presented below, Kulalikamnaya  3.1-39 (this is the main version of the Kubjikamata Tantra [KMT]), provides.a  good illustration of their relative validity. It contains a version, admittedly unique,  of one of the best-known myths of the Epic-Puranic religious tradition; and it  firmly connects mythological timelessness with the psychosomatic realization of  spiritual truth and power which is the goal of Devi's rebirths  

We translate Devi by "the Goddess"; the title Devi is very frequent in the Tantras  as a name and a means of address. At first sight, the heading "Devi's rebirths"  seems paradoxical, because the gods cannot die, and especially Devi, being the  tangible manifestation of eternal Power, cannot be held to undergo death or re 

birth. But in mythology this theological truth is not always respected. On the  contrary, there are several mythological (and ritual) references to death and re generation of divine beings (see, among others, Marglin and Mishra 1991). With out a doubt, the most important tradition about the succession of Devi's earthly  existences is the mythological cluster around her death as Sati and successive  rebirth as Parvati. The religious historian might be tempted to explain the paradox  as follows: Devi's different existences are systematizations of different, even con tradictory revelations about manifestations of Power within the realm of time. But  the same could be maintained about Siva or his manifestations, which are nev ertheless only seldom said to undergo rebirth. It would seem therefore that "re birth" is a typical prerogative of the feminine manifestation of the godhead - at 

WEDDIN G O F SIVA AN D THE GODDES S 185  

least in the mythological sphere, where it probably reflects the observation of the  recurrence of death and rebirth in the natural world. This state of affairs implies  that the union of God and Goddess, absolutely necessary for the continuance and  renewal of the world process, is periodically repeated - or rather, reenacted,  actualized.  

Sati and Parvati  

The Puranic authorities generally agree that in her last but one temporal existence,  Devi appeared as Sati, "the Faithful [wife]." She was born as one of the many  daughters of a primeval father named Daksa. All these women, like Sati, bear  allegorical names such as Sraddha (Confidence) or Khyati (Fame). We momen 

tarily follow the authority of the Visnu Purana (1.7), where we are told, quite  significantly, that Sati did not belong to the oldest group of thirteen who were  married off to the god Dharma; nor to a second group of eight who were destined  to become the wives of Brahma's sons. In fact, the name of Sati (and, by the way,  those of Svaha and Svadha) was undoubtedly appended to those of the original  group at a later time. The mythic compilers may have felt that the ideal of the  "faithful wife" was too important to be left out of this collection of allegories. Be  that as it may, Sati was joined in wedlock to Rudra-Siva. When her father on a  certain occasion organized a magnificent sacrificial ceremony but forgot to invite  her husband, she could not brook the insult. In a terrible rage she killed herself  by means of a yogic procedure, as related in Kalidasa's famous court epic, the  Kumarasambhava (1.21). The Kulalikdmnaya author does not refer to this prelude;  however, because of its extreme popularity, he cannot have been unacquainted  with it.  

The Puranas tell us how Siva, inconsolable over the death of his wife, began to  lead the life of a naked ascetic. In the meantime, Devi decided upon a new in carnation as the daughter of the divine mountain Himavant (the Himalaya) and  the fairy Mena or Menaka (Linga Purana 1.101.24ff.). Of special interest in con nection with the fragment translated below is the version recorded in the Parva tikhanda of the Siva Purana (2.3.1-20).  

Although the Goddess as Daughter of the Mountain is generally known as  Parvati, she is occasionally given other names. Kalidasa (Kumarasambhava 1.26)  informs us that Parvati was the patronym by which she was known to her relatives,  but that her mother Mena introduced another name, Uma, when she tried to  dissuade her daughter from asceticism: through a strained etymology, Uma is  explained to mean u ma, "Oh, don't (do it)." According to the Lihga Purana  (1.101.24f) however, the name Uma was already known to Brahma before Par 

vati's birth. In the literature, Uma Haimavati is mentioned much earlier, in an  early Upanisad (Kena Upanisad 3.12). According to the Ramdyana (1.35.17), Uma  was the usual name of Himavant's daughter. But these sources are silent about  another famous name of Devi, that of Kali or Kalika. In the Siva Purana, this name 

186 TEU N GOUDRIAA N  

appears in the present myth in a dual context. First, the Goddess is invoked as  Kalika by Mena, her future mother, who implores her to take birth as her daugh ter. Second, when this has been granted and the daughter has been born, she is  given the name Kali, along with other designations, by her father Himavant. Also  here, the variant Kalika (Blackie) occurs.The same name is prominent in the  Kulalikamnaya, especially in its first chapter, which deals with her premarital  encounters with Siva. Kramrisch (1981) records a remarkable explanation for the  girl's dark complexion from the Matsya Purana, which is generally recognized as  a relatively early Purana: Brahma purportedly ordered his eldest daughter Ratri  (Night) to enter the body of the pregnant Mena and provide the embryo with a  black color. However that may be, it is clear enough that it would be wrong to  associate the name Kali solely with the well-known fearsome apparition who,  bedecked with skulls and other gruesome ornaments, dances upon Siva's corpse.  

How Siva Becomes Her Husband  

When their splendid daughter approaches marriageable age, her parents consult  the sage Narada about the girl's future (here we continue to follow the Siva Purana  version). The sage notices an inauspicious line in her hand and concludes that  her future husband will be a naked yogin of shabby dress and devoid of family  relations. The parents are shocked at first, but Kalika is happy, because from this  description she recognizes her eternal husband Siva. She is more determined than  ever to win him back. This purpose coincides with the gods' project of causing  Siva to procreate a son. Only such a son, they know, will be able to destroy a  most dangerous demon who is about to conquer the threefold world. The demon's  name is usually given as Taraka. The Siva Purana (2.3.10) also records the origin  of another enemy of the gods, Bhauma, "Son of the Earth" - a reference to his  birth from a drop of sweat that fell from Siva upon the ground. In his battle  against the gods, Taraka is assisted by his general Kraunca (Siva Purana 2.3.16.14).  In the version found in the Kulalikamnaya (3.3), Kraunca himself is the world conquering demon; typical of this Tantra's different outlook is the fact that  Kraunca is here said to have been born from the Goddess' (and not from Siva's)  perspiration. This must have happened when she roamed the earth as a virgin in  order to install sacred centres of Tantric worship (as described in chapter 2 of the  text, see also below).  

In the meantime (we return to the standard Siva Purana version) Siva, still  overcome with grief and disgusted with the outside world, chooses to continue  his asceticism in the region of the Himalayas. Himavant goes out to welcome him  courteously; Siva accepts his greeting but expresses his desire not to be disturbed  in future. Nevertheless, Himavant (having noted Siva's poor condition) soon re 

turns with his daughter, whom he presents (with her full assent) as a housemaid.  Siva opens his eyes for a moment but closes them again immediately when he 

WEDDIN G O F SIVA AN D THE GODDES S 187  

sees her dazzling beauty. Slightly irritated, he requests Himavant to leave his  daughter at home on future occasions. But this is unacceptable to Kali, who  addresses Siva with philosophical argumentation, proving that he as the cosmic  Self cannot do without her as Sakti, eternal Power (Siva Purana 2.3.13.1-22).  Siva cannot refute her demonstration and has to acquiesce in her daily service.  All this is told with a Puranic prolixity that tends to obscure the dynamism of the  story. The Tantric version, as we shall see, is quite different.  

The course of events now moves more rapidly. The gods, realizing that the  time is ripe, send Kama (Love), assisted by his friend Vasanta (Spring) and his  wife Rati (Passion) - in verse 19 of the Kubjikamata Tantra version, a second wife,  named Priti (Charity) is mentioned - to Siva with the command to shoot him  with his flowery arrows. He manages to release but a single arrow: Siva feels its  impact and because he happens to have Parvati in full view, he is seriously assailed  by erotic passions. But he regains his self-control, and with a fiery glare from his  third eye opened ever so slightly, reduces Kama to ashes (this god too can die!).  The episode is one of the most widely known of Hindu mythology.  

The concerted attack on Siva's chastity having failed, Kali, in tears, returns  home. But she soon finds herself again, and decides upon a course of the most  terrible asceticism, the likes of which has never been experienced on earth (Siva  Purana 2.3.22.61ff.). All the world's creatures begin to feel its impact. Even cats  and mice live in temporary friendship. The gods, alarmed and once again fearing  destruction, approach Siva under Visnu's leadership to request humbly that he  marry Parvati. After some hesitation, the god, moved by their devotion, agrees.  The world is again saved, and everyone joyfully takes part in the marriage cere mony, in which the most important gods act as officiants. As a matter of course,  the rites are conducted according to the Vedic prescriptions. Visnu (and not the  bride's father, Himavant) takes it upon himself to give away the bride (Linga  Purana 1.103.45f.), and Brahma acts as the invoking priest (hotar). Contrary to  what one might perhaps expect in a Tantra, the Kulalikamnaya (3.25f.) has pre 

served these time-honored ritual details. In verse 25, Siva even complains (with  a show of self-pity) that he cannot marry because the requisite participants are  missing from the ceremony; but the gods provide a solution to this problem.  

At the end of this rapid survey, we cannot but note the paradox offered by the  myth in its different stages: is Siva won over by Kama's feat of archery, by Parvati's  asceticism, or by the gods' devotion? In the Kulalikamnaya version, the problem  is less prominent, although present between the lines. Here (KMT 3.18), it appears  that Kama is burnt only after Siva is already in Parvati's arms, when he, however  love-stricken he may be, catches sight of his attacker from a corner of his eye (a  masterly detail). But the god's passion is strong and the marriage seems unavoid 

able. On Devi's asceticism, the text remains almost silent, except for two brief  allusions (KMT 3.12 and 24). But then, the gods' devotion is again described  (KMT 3.21ff.) as the decisive factor by which the god's self-centered hesitancy is  finally put aside. 

188 TEUN GOUDRIAAN  

The Kulalikamnaya and Kubjika  

In the Kuldlikamnaya, the myth of the marriage of Siva and Parvati is retold and  adapted as a divine context for its description of meditation and yoga. In this  way, the text firmly proves its attachment to the classical Hindu religious tradition.  At the same time, it recognizes Siva as the Lord of Kula (KMT 3.31), that is, of  the "family" or "community" of those who follow the esoteric path and whose  aim is final release through realization of the identity of their own self, the guru,  Siva, and Sakti. But its most remarkable feature is its introduction of an original  conception of the Goddess characterized as Kubjika (the Hunchbacked).  

This cult of Kubjika (also called Kuja, in KMT 3.22; or Kubji, in KMT 3.31)  must be an old subtradition from within the Kula, one that seems to have been  limited to certain communities of Siddhas and yogins in northern India. Due to  historical and climatological circumstances, the manuscripts of its Tantras and  ritual guides have been recovered almost exclusively from Nepal. In this still  imperfectly known literary heritage, we find several explanations of the Goddess's  surprising deformity. The most probable view is that "hunchbacked" is an oblique  reference to the coiled form (elsewhere compared to a sleeping serpent) in which  she remains hidden in the lowest power center of the human body (the mula dhara; in the Kubjikamata Tantra, perhaps the second center, the svadhisthana).  It may also be a reference to her crooked, serpentine upward course within the  body of the meditating yogin. An attractive mythological explanation is offered  in a secondary text of the school, the unedited Kularatnoddyota (1.75-76): the  Goddess is so named because she huddled herself together out of shame when  Siva declared his love to her. This "down-faced" position might very well refer to  the "sleeping" position of the kundalini serpent mentioned above. Curiously  enough, the Goddess after her wedding is still suffering of her deformity and  professes to be ignorant of its origin (KMT 3.32). To the best of our knowledge,  the Puranic traditions (with the exception of a late and secondary passage in the  Agni Purana) know nothing of this theme.  

In any case, the Kubjikamata Tantra makes clear that the premarital phase in  the relationship of Siva-Bhairava and the Goddess Kubjika has not been without  obstacles. On the contrary, a serious altercation between the predestined lovers  has taken place, as described in the text's first two chapters. The bone of conten 

tion seems to have been the possession of the authorization to teach (ajna) and  the right to transmit teachings. The Goddess has even gone so far as to show  herself in a fear-inspiring form (KMT 2.4f.), which later becomes one of her  worshiped manifestations. While still a virgin - and therefore independent and  awesome - she had taken a trip around the world (in practice, India) to establish  sacred places devoted to her worship and populated by her manifestations. In the  view of this Tantra, it is only after this task has been fulfilled that she is ready for  her marriage with the god.  

When the newlyweds are happily sitting together on Mount Kailasa, the timeWEDDING OF SIVA AND THE GODDESS 189  

is ripe for Devi to question Siva on those matters that are of crucial importance  to the earthly practitioners of the Tantric path - in short, the further contents of  the Kulalikamnaya. In this way, our text conforms to the general pattern of Tantric  contextual anchoring. It must of course be realized that Devi poses her questions  merely out of compassion for these devotees, being herself the source and final  goal of all teaching. By her pretended ignorance, she even leaves herself open to  her husband's ironical remarks (such as in KMT 3.33).  

The first subject explained is the selection and excellence of the right guru  (KMT 3.38f.). Thereafter, the text proceeds with the exposition of mantras and  mudras (gestures) in chapters four through six, followed by a discussion of Kub 

jika's root mantra: the thirty-two-syllabled samayavidya (vidya being the type of  mantra directed to, and identified with, goddesses). In chapters 11-22, the bulk  of the Kubjikamata Tantra, Kubjika's aniconic manifestations (mainly phonic and  geometrical), as well as the yogic and meditative methods to realize these, are  described. The final three chapters contain additional matter of importance to the  Siddha's or yogin's way of life.  

In this way, all the practical teachings of Tantric ritual and yoga are embedded  in the context of the creative union of Siva and Sakti or Devi. But this erotic frame  does not refer to the sexual ritualism that the West has often considered, quite  unappropriately, to be the main feature of Tantra. There are no clear allusions to  such rituals in the Kulalikamnaya.  

A remark on the literary character of the Kubjikamata Tantra: most of the text  is in the Sloka meter. This is also the case in the translated fragment, except for  stanzas 17, 18, and 31 (which are in varieties of tristubh meter); and 19 (in arya  meter). The Kubjikamata Tantra's manner of presentation is often unsystematic,  incomplete, and at times even mystifying. The fragment translated below is no  exception. The descriptions of events, and especially the dialogues and other  fragments of direct speech, are allusive and evocative rather than factual. It is  therefore possible that the translation contains a few misunderstandings of a  speaker's intentions (for example, in verses 9 and 10). Moreover, the manuscripts  show up a great number of variants.  

The present translation of the Kulalikamnaya 3.1-39 is based upon the text pub lished in Goudriaan and Schoterman (1988). While translating, I have tried to  remain faithful to the idiosyncracies of the Sanskrit, undoubtedly at the cost of  the fluency of the English.  

Further Reading  

The only available edition of the Kubjikamata Tantra is The Kubjikamatatantra,  Kulalikamnaya Version: Critical Edition, by Teun Goudriaan and Jan A. Schoterman  (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1988). This edition has a preliminary character because many 

190 TEU N GOUDRIAA N  

details of this difficult text are as yet imperfectly understood. A survey of the  Tantra's contents may be found in pages 110-30 of the introduction.  A general study of the Kubjika cult and its Tantric literature (which was written,  as far as we know, entirely in Sanskrit) does not yet exist. The reader may turn  to Jan A. Schoterman's pioneering study, The Satsahasrasamhita, Chapters 1-5  (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1982), pp. 3-16; or to Dory Heilijgers-Seelen's carefully  worded introduction to her The System of Five Cakras in Kubjikamatatantra 14-16  (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1994), pp. 1-12. The chapter entitled "The Panca cakra" in the same book (pp. 16-38), although difficult, is worth the trouble as  an introduction to the school's intricate microcosmic symbolism. Mark Dy czkowski's The Canon of the Saivagama and the Kubjika Tantras of the Western Kaula  Tradition (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988), is of only partial  relevance. A still useful general treatment of Hindu Tantric doctines and practices  is Sanjukta Gupta, Dirk Jan Hoens, and Teun Goudriaan, Hindu Tantrism (Leiden:  Brill, 1979). For the Puranic accounts of Siva's and Devi's wedding and their  earlier relations, see Stella Kramrisch, The Presence of Siva (Princeton: Princeton  University Press, 1981), pp. 301-83 ("The family of Siva"), especially pp. 340- 83 ("The Lineage of Parvata, the Mountain"); the rich material is, however, poorly  organized. A selective reading of Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty's Siva, the Erotic As cetic (New York: Oxford University Press, 1973, 1981) provides an idea of Siva's  difficult character. A compendium of Puranic literature in general is Ludo Rocher,  The Puranas (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1986). Orthodox Hindu marriage ritual  is treated, rather technically, by Raj Bali Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 2nd ed. (Delhi:  Motilal Banarsidass, 1969), p. 153-233. An attractive (although somewhat re mote) article on the death and regeneration theme is Frederique Apffel Marglin  and Purna Chandra Mishra, "Death and Regeneration: Brahmin and non-Brahmin  narratives," in Diana L. Eck and Francoise Mallison, eds., Devotion Divine: Bhakti  Traditions from the Regions of India (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, and Paris: Ecole  Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1991), pp. 209-30. The article is also useful as an  indication of the relationship between mythology and ritual, as well as of the  social background of different types of oral and written textual transmission.  

The Wedding of Siva and the Mountain's Daughter  

The Venerable Goddess said:  

1. Relate to Me, O Bhairava: how was the marriage realized  of You with Me; what was its cause,  

and what its object held in view?  

The Venerable Bhairava said:  

2. You, O fair Lady, [having roamed  

the earth, enjoying maidenhood],  

had reached again Your father's home; 

WEDDING OF SIVA AND THE GODDESS 191  

but as to Me: I was approached  

with respect by the throng of gods  

whose aim was to have Kraunca killed.  

3. And how that demon had been born,  

that I will tell You faithfully:  

from You, while traveling with haste,  

a drop of sweat fell down on earth.  

4. From that, a demon was born  

whose name was Kraunca; glorifying in strength.  

By him, the host of gods in seven worlds  

5. was put to flight: he was so mighty.  

They, then, retired to Brahma's place.  

But Brahma, at their head, went on  

to seek refuge at Visnu's side.  

6. He then conferred with Visnu thus:  

"What can we do, being put to flight  

by Kraunca, that powerful antigod;  

please, Lord, point out [to us] a way  

7. by which to crush him, Lord of the Bird!  

Because of this, I sought Your presence."  

But Hari spoke in answer thus:  

"No being is able to take his life  

8. if not Siva's and Devi's son.  

And why? He [Kraunca,] too sprang from that source."  

Considering this, the Grandfather Divine,  

[Brahma,] spoke thus: "[Siva,] that mighty Lord - 

9. Where does He live now [as an ascetic], far away  

from the Goddess's presence?" And he produced  

a laugh: "Does a protector act like this?"  

These were Grandfather's very words.  

10. [And he continued, warning them:]  

"Is He not full of power? his fire  

might rise; scorched by that burning wrath  

nobody who came with a request can live.  

11. You, dwellers in heaven, will be lost,  

laid low because of some presumptuous act!"  

Thus they were brought to realize  

by Visnu['s message,] intimated by Brahma. 

192 TEUN GOUDRIAAN  

12. But then, they spoke again and said:  

"A means should be devised right now!  

The Daughter of Mount Himavant  

sits there alone in concentration.  

13. The Lord's feet are her sole delight;  

the Lord Himself is not so far away."  

After these words, the famous pair  

of youths, called Spring and blameless Love,  

14. were summoned by the gods, and charged  

to charm the minds of God and Goddess both;  

and thus they did, after preparing flowers  

and sprouts, in short: all [Nature's gifts].  

15. Resounding with sweet melodies of cuckoos,  

teeming with swarms of bees restlessly humming;  

[Brahma] duly observed Spring thus appearing,  

and, with a voice steadied by his contentment,  

16. at that great moment he proclaimed this [message]:  

"the god of Love now hits the Fearsome One!"  

17. And He, staring with eyes filled to the brim  

by bliss, as He surrendered to his passion;  

fixing a steady gaze upon that maiden  

[and grasping her body,] He put her on his thigh;  

while She [also] was full of longing, as her hands  

were clasped around his neck. But even so,  

in tight embrace, He cast a glance aside, and saw.  

18. His mind aroused to shame, clouded by wrath  

- that cosmic fire, destructive of the threefold world - 

He wrapped [Love's] body in a flame. That god fell down,  dispatched within a moment by the Lover's lethal gaze.  

19. When Love was burnt, the source of their delight,  

his spouses, Charity and Passion, were reduced  

to wailing long and loud, and hard to bear!  

He saw them crying and [spoke]: "Forever gone  

is now your common spouse, henceforth  

the Bodiless; you both, please weep no more !"  

20. The three-eyed God thus meted out  

the punishment to Kama. Punishment or grace,  

Bhairava's wish becomes a fact. 

WEDDIN G O F SIVA AND THE GODDES S 193  

21. But then, when things had reached this stage,  

the throngs of gods together came;  

the sages, demigods, and perfect beings  

also arrived; Brahma and Visnu were presiding.  

22. These two, Hari and Brahma, praised aloud  

with divine songs and lauds, the Lord of Kuja;  

having thus satisfied Him, they spoke these words:  

"Oh God, we have a pressing need forward to bring:  

23. We lost [the blessing presence] of Your feet;  

we gods, Oh God, have fallen on evil days:  

pressed down are we by that impetuous being  

of violent nature, Kraunca; Oh supreme Lord!  

24. Protector, be benevolent to us, and by compassion - 

we mean to say, grant us security . . .  

Be kind, Protector, take the Goddess as Your wife,  

her state is pitiful, She mortifies herself."  

The Fearful One spoke:  

25. "Where is She now, whose daughter is She,  

who is her mother, who her [father and] father's father;  

who will give her to Me, to whom  

should I apply the wooing for her hand,  

what can I do, a lonesome being without relations ?"  

26. But Brahma answered Him: "I am the one  

to whom You can apply; I shall [on Your behalf]  

ask for her hand; the sacrificer is [her father]  

the Himavant; [Visnu] the Ruler is the acting priest."  

27. After these words, the Elder god  

ordered Vasistha, being the chief  

of sages: "quickly organize  

the marriage celebration rites!"  

28. The [sages] took their leave; they bore the order  

faithfully on their heads. A festive scene  

of wedding was prepared in costly style:  

29. most glamorous, with excellent forebodings,  

joyful and merry. From that time, every wish  

of these [participants] was realized completely.  

30. Now that the Fearsome's passion was aroused,  

the Cosmic Womb became the ever fertile source; 

194 TEUN GOUDRIAAN  

with the creation of a threefold world in view  

the God was then engaged in sexuality.  

31. While He was lost in all too greedy passion  

by fanciful varieties of love play, *  

intent upon the ritual production  

of what the Kula knows as "fluid of immortality,"  

that Lord of Kula, much attached to Kubja,  

was humbly questioned by his Lady, as follows:  

32. "By the love You made to Me, My body melted down;  but, Fearful Lord, my burden is heavy:  

this hunchbacked form of Mine."  

The Fearsome One spoke:  

33. "Goddess, expert in love play,  

fulfiller of many desires:  

today, You satisfied Me.  

Dear Lady, ask whatever You like,  

ask, even what may be hard to get."  

Verses 34-37 are omitted.  

The Venerable Kubjika spoke:  

38. "Be so kind as to explain to me, what is proper behavior; a Guru, how  [should he be, because] the realization of all [spiritual] aims is dependent upon  him alone.  

39. "[Such realization] comes to pass by his mantras and ritual instruction, by  his yoga; [in short,] his traditional authority. Dear Lord, please relate this all  in a relaxed manner, but [if possible] within one session."
