<p>The Pole Star and the seven stars of the Great or Northern Dipper occupy a  prominent place in Chinese imperial and Daoist traditions, and have microcosmic  and macrocosmic associations on both the astronomical and the human scales. It  was widely believed that the stars and constellations of &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; (tian) had ana</p>
<p>logues in the &ldquo;under-heaven&rdquo; (tianxia) and within the human body, and that  events and conditions in one of these systems affected the analogous structures  in the other systems. Thus, heaven was the model for earth, and the heavenly  bureaucracy the model for the earthly empire. So too, the human body was con</p>
<p>ceived as a &ldquo;country&rdquo; containing palaces and offices, with its gods the functionaries  that serve in the &ldquo;Niwan Palace&rdquo; (conceived of as &ldquo;grottos&rdquo; in the cranium), in the  &ldquo;cinnabar field&rdquo; (dantian) located below the navel, and elsewhere. Certain of these  gods were less than beneficent. Indeed, if allowed to leave the body they could  ascend to heaven and report misdeeds to the &ldquo;comptroller of fate&rdquo; (siming), who  noted their transgressions in a register. Such entries shortened a person&rsquo;s life. It  is notable that one of the texts below details rituals to alter these records and  thereby prolong life.</p>
<p>Chinese cosmomagical speculation drew important connections between an  emperor&rsquo;s rule and events in the heavens, and the &ldquo;Palace of the Pole Star&rdquo; was  thought to be the celestial model for the palace of the son of Heaven here on  earth. The Dipper asterism was also believed to be the residence of Taiyi, the  Great Monad, and the abode of the deified Laozi, who lives there &ldquo;as a hypostasis  of the Daoist cosmic Sage, the anthropomorphic form of the Dao&rdquo; (Robinet 1997:  50). In resonance with the universe at large, the human body contains its own  Great or Northern Dipper. For &ldquo;located in the very center of the head, the Niwan  (&lsquo;mud-pill,&rsquo; but also a transliteration of the term nirvana) Palace is covered by the  seven stars of the Northern Dipper&rdquo; (Kohn 1993: 209). This inner Dipper is the  focus of a wide variety of Daoist meditational practices and is celebrated in in numerable Taoist works. As one Daoist adept put it,3 8 4 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H . SANFOR D</p>
<p>In heaven seven stars; on earth seven treasures</p>
<p>and seven grottos in our heads</p>
<p>seven times the subtle air of yin melts</p>
<p>as a slow fire warms the cauldron, warms the lead.</p>
<p>Attributed to Zhang Boduan, Daozang qi yao 128</p>
<p>Because of the centrality and ubiquity of the circumpolar stars in Daoist and  imperial ideology, Chinese concern with the religious meaning of the Dipper stars  is often thought to be a peculiarly Daoist interest. Yet these motifs of macrocosm  and microcosm are often expressed in terms of the Indian cakra system of subtle  body organs. The dipper star motif is found in a number of Sino-Japanese venues  that range from Daoist alchemical texts (such as the poem translated above) to  paintings of the Japanese Shinto-Buddhist deity, Matara-jin. It should not, there fore, be surprising that in the volumes of the Taisho Tripitaka collection of Sino</p>
<p>Japanese Buddhist works devoted to Esoteric or &ldquo;Tantric&rdquo; Buddhism (zhenyan,  &ldquo;Mantra,&rdquo; or mijiao, &ldquo;Esoteric&rdquo; teaching, in Chinese; Shingon or mikkyo, in Japa nese) we find several such works.</p>
<p>Chinese Esoteric Buddhism has a complex prehistory; in brief, between the  third century and the beginning of the eighth century, South and Central Asian  texts describing mandalas, and studded with mantras and dharanis (spells), began  to pour into China. This piecemeal transmission continued until Subhakarasimha  arrived in Changan in 717, followed by Vajrabodhi and his disciple Amoghavajra,  who arrived in the Tang capital in 721 to articulate and propagate the compre</p>
<p>hensive systems of Buddhist esoterism. Like other South Asian forms of Tantra,  Esoteric Buddhism assumed an extensive series of correspondences between the  body and the cosmos, between internal yogic physiology (composed of cakras or  energy centers strung out along the spinal column and their connecting channels)  and the elements (wind, water, fire, and earth), planets, and stars. Progress toward  enlightenment proceeded on the external level in ritual, and internally through  yogic ascent. Success or siddhi was both a microcosmic mastery of the inner world  and a macrocosmic mastery of the cosmos.</p>
<p>A common thread that runs through the Esoteric Buddhism of Subhakara sirhha, Vajrabodhi, Amoghavajra, and their disciples in the Late Tang (mid-eighth  through mid-ninth centuries) was the interdependence of the achievement of  enlightenment and various forms of worldly benefit. Nevertheless, much of these  masters&rsquo; lives were spent in &ldquo;mundane pursuits&rdquo; and in constructing rituals mainly  of apotropaic and political value. Many of the ritual manuals collected in the  Esoteric portion of the Taisho canon (volumes 18-21) are directed toward the  ills of the period of the &ldquo;End of the Dharma&rdquo; (Chinese moja, Japanese mappo).  For example, in The Scripture Expounded at the Bodhimanda Concerning the Single  Syllable Usnisa, we find the Buddha instructing Vajrapani concerning a time &ldquo;after  my extinction, during the time of the end of the Dharma.&rdquo; What is then pro</p>
<p>pounded is the End of the Dharma Siddhi (Taisho 950: 200c, 205c) to shield the  practitioner from a wide variety of impending disasters.</p>
<p>LADIE S OF THE DIPPE R 385</p>
<p>Ritual application fell into two broad categories. There were rituals for the  imperial family, high courtiers, and generals, both living and dead; and rituals  designed to protect and maintain the state and the cosmic order. Esoteric re vamping of earlier Buddhist texts and rituals with these purposes in mind con sistently followed the paradigms set out in the Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha  (Taisho 865-66; 862), and the treatment of these texts and rituals parallels the  treatment of the Scripture for Humane Kings (Taisho 245-46). No disembodied  Buddhism this: rather, the point was application - fully embodied ritual appli cation with sonic, photic, and somatic dimensions. This was, in short, Tantra,  and what dazzled jaded Tang courtiers was its sumptuous ritual, its &ldquo;smells and  bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tang masters drew upon the vast store of correspondences between the  body and the cosmos found in South Asian Tantric systems. Among the most  basic homologies are those involving lunar and solar images, night and day, white  and red, and the ida and pingala channels that pierce the cakras of the yogin&rsquo;s  subtle physiology. Extensive correspondences were worked out not only con</p>
<p>cerning the moon and sun, but also with regard to the planets and stars. The  alchemical traditions related planets to colors, jewels, ores, and so forth. This  body of lore was developed throughout South Asian yogic traditions. Mainstream  Buddhism had relatively little to say on the luminaries in or outside of the body.  The Abhidharmakosa remarks only that &ldquo;the stars turn about Meru as though  caught in a whirlpool.&rdquo; Despite this laconic sentence, it makes perfect sense to  &ldquo;assume that there is some relationship between the seven circular mountain rings  and the seven spheres marked out by the &lsquo;planets&rsquo; of antiquity&rdquo; (Kloetzli 1983:  46-47). Not unexpectedly, later Kalacakra (Wheel of Time) traditions as sum marized by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye (1995: 156-58), give more details:</p>
<p>The celestial sphere pervades space between Mount Meru and the mountain of fire.  It is a belt of wind, within which the twelve houses and the twenty-eight constellations  formed first. [The houses] are situated in a clockwise arrangement. Planets such as  the sun and moon arise above them. [Eight] move counterclockwise; the Eclipser  [moves] clockwise.</p>
<p>The location of this belt in the body is not specified. The Japanese Byakuhokusho  (containing what is purported to be oral transmission of the Tang masters now  preserved in Japan) seems to identify it with the mouth and eyes in a fashion that  seems to evoke the sacrifice of Purusa in Rg Veda 10.90: &ldquo;the sun, the moon, and  the five planets emerge from the radiance of Manjusri. Emanating beams of light  from his mouth in the center of this radiance, he manifests the five planets; from  the radiance of his left and right eyes, he manifests the sun and the moon&rdquo; (Birn</p>
<p>baum 1983: 123 n.128, citing Taisho supplement 6.461a). South Asian sources  here parallel Daoist tradition in locating the Dipper in the head and associating  it with the sun, moon, and the eyes. As elsewhere in esoteric astral lore, it is  Manjusri, the bodhisattva embodiment of wisdom, who is lord of the heavens. The  Manjusri-nama-sangiti-sutra speaks of the twenty-eight lodges (the lunar lodges,</p>
<p>386 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H . SANFOR D</p>
<p>or groups of stars along the path of the moon; mythically, the abodes of Soma&rsquo;s  wives where he rests on his journey) as the diadem of Manjusri (Birnbaum 1983:  102). Given the identification of the throat cakra with the element wind one may  tentatively imagine the twenty-eight lunar lodges (naksatras) as the bodhisattva&rsquo;s  &ldquo;necklace&rdquo; and as the topmost level of the material world (just below the four  transic states or Brahma heavens) that affects the fate of sentient beings. Here we  have, in short, the workings of karma. In his climb to the summit of existence  the yogin masters the forces of karma (the planets and naksatras) and, by bringing  together the solar and lunar forces, transcends the wheel of time.</p>
<p>A major factor in the success of Tantric Buddhism in the eighth and ninth  century Tang court was the masters&rsquo; ability and willingness to adapt their knowl edge to the concerns of their new Chinese patrons. Indian astral lore - like that  of the Greeks - focused on the ecliptic (the apparent motion of the sun against  the background of fixed stars), the heliacal rising and setting of stars (which yields  the twelve houses or the zodiacal band of stars confined to the apparent path of  the sun in the sky), and the twenty-eight naksatras. Chinese astral lore was keyed  to the circumpolar stars and meridians drawn from them to the &ldquo;lunar lodges&rdquo;  (xiu). The stars of the Great Dipper were not neglected in South Asian traditions;  indeed, they had been identified with the seven rsis (sages) since Vedic times.  The wives of the rsis were the Krtikkas, identified as the Pleiades open star cluster  that rises in the east in late autumn, and which itself resembles a small dipper.  Perhaps this is the reason why the text locates all of the Dipper stars in the east.  The Indian and Chinese traditions shared an interest in the &ldquo;lunar lodges,&rdquo; and  both sought ritually to divine and influence events in the heavens in order to  shape events in the mundane world. Thus, the Tang masters introduced new  mathematical techniques for the production of accurate calendars (an essential  part of the son of Heaven&rsquo;s claim to rule), performed homa (immolation) rituals  designed to propitiate the &ldquo;nine Graspers&rdquo; (spirits of the planets, which are often  associated with disease: jiu zhi in Chinese; navagraha in Sanskrit), and designed  new rites to address the lords of the Great Dipper (an asterism in Ursa Major).</p>
<p>With this in mind, we turn to the Taisho canon, where we may distinguish  four categories of texts that concern themselves with astral phenomena. First are  those texts in which Manjusri is the lord of astral wisdom. Second is the cycle of  texts designed to prevent disasters connected with the Buddha&rsquo;s usnisa (the pro</p>
<p>truberance on his head, or &ldquo;wisdom bump&rdquo;). Third are those texts primarily  concerned with the lords of the Great Dipper. Finally, there is an assortment of  texts that, along with their primary purpose, also promise protection from astral  misfortunes. A good example of these is the Scripture for Humane Kings.</p>
<p>The three brief texts we translate represent a synthesis between Chinese and  South Asian astral worship. These are the Scripture Expounded by the Buddha on  Prolonging Life through Worship of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (Fo shuo  beidou qi xingyan mingjing), Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars of the  Northern Dipper (Beidou qi xing niansong yigui), and the Secret Essentials for Per forming Homa to the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (Beidou qi xing huma miyao</p>
<p>LADIE S O F THE DIPPE R 387</p>
<p>yigui). Aimed squarely at neutralizing the evil effects of astral divinities and at  promoting good fortune and long life, these texts were an integral part of the new  Tantric teachings tailored to the concerns of Chinese aristocrats and military men.</p>
<p>The Scripture Expounded by the Buddha on Prolonging Life through Worship of the  Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper constitutes a short catalog of the apotheosized  seven stars of the Dipper. Each of its seven entries consists of the following parts:  an illustration of the divinity of the star, the star/divinity&rsquo;s name, the drawing of  an appropriate talisman, and a short, formulaic, astrological text.</p>
<p>The seven illustrations are all of individual female figures in ancient court dress,  with the exception of the fifth star, which shows its female figure accompanied  by a smaller-scale male acolyte. This asterism, zeta Ursa Majoris (the brighter  member is also known as Mizar, and the dimmer star as Alcor) is a well-known  double star visible to the naked eye from a dark site. Curiously, these gender  associations are exactly the opposite of those found in most South Asian sources.  There, Vasistha (zeta Ursa Majoris or Mizar) is accompanied by his chaste wife  Arundhati. However, one verse in the Rg Veda (1.164.16) says in reference to the  Krtikkas (the Pleiades), &ldquo;They tell me that those virtuous women are men; he  who has eyes sees this, not he who is blind.&rdquo; Each entry is numbered in these  illustrations with a Japanese kana symbol, a feature that makes the Japanese prov enance of the Taisho text patent (but does not, of course, preclude earlier Chinese  provenance, as the text itself proclaims). The talisman shapes, like those of many  Daoist talismanic diagrams, are quite similar to Chinese characters; in some cases  the likely prototype character seems obvious. Each star name has also been as sociated with one or more of the &ldquo;twelve earthly branches,&rdquo; which, in turn, is  associated with an astrological animal. We have indicated the associated animal  in brackets. Not surprisingly, Manjusri is the recipient of this scripture. Perhaps  of greater import is the catalog of woes that the scripture seeks to address, in cluding favorable rebirth, helping relatives out of hell, help in fending off demons  and &ldquo;dead souls&rdquo; (literally, the yang and yin souls of the dead), illness, agricultural  disasters, and difficulty in childbirth.</p>
<p>The Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper is at tributed to the master Vajrabodhi and promises a variety of rewards, including  that of lengthening one&rsquo;s life by modifying one&rsquo;s karmic register. One should note  that such a register is a decidedly Chinese notion, one that is treated in greater  detail in the Secret Essentials for Performing Homa to the Seven Stars of the Northern  Dipper. Here we find a standard Chinese account of the role of the Comptroller  of Fate (siming), and of penalties suffered for crimes. The text also notes that the  stars of the Dipper are the &ldquo;essence of the sun, moon, and five stars [the planets],  making explicit one of the links between South and East Asian astrological lore.  Again, turning to South Asia, we find an intriguing correspondence, since the  seven rsis of the Dipper are sometimes regarded as sun, moon, and Agni (fire).  But this is a homa text, and it gives details of the construction of the altar, the  nature of the offerings, the proper mudras (gestures) and mantras, and a some what cryptic form of divination,</p>
<p>388 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H . SANFOR D</p>
<p>Taken together, these texts illustrate characteristic South Asian Tantric concerns  and practices aimed at advancement and protection in the material world, while  also demonstrating the adaptation of South Asian Tantric practices into the East  Asian milieu.</p>
<p>The Scripture Expounded by the Buddha on Prolonging Life through Worship of the  Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (Fo shuo beidou qi xing yan ming jing) is found  inTaisho 1307: 21.425b-426b); the Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars</p>
<p>of the Northern Dipper (Beidou qi xing niansong yigui) is in Taisho 1305: 21.423c 424b; and the Secret Essentials for Performing Homa to the Seven Stars of the Northern  Dipper (Beidou qi xing huma miyao yigui) is in Taisho 1306: 21.424b-425a. All  three texts are found in Taisho shinshu daizo-kyo, edited and compiled by Takakusu  Junjiro and Watanabe Kaigyoku. (Tokyo: Taisho issaikyo kanko-kai, 1924-34).  The mantras have been rendered according to the siddham (a script related to  Brahmi) that appears beside the Chinese transliteration in the texts.</p>
<p>The Chinese employ two series of characters, the ten &ldquo;heavenly stems&rdquo; and the  twelve &ldquo;earthly branches,&rdquo; to designate a calendrical cycle of sixty years. Each of  the twelve branches is associated with an animal and a zodiacal year sign. We  have given these associations in brackets where appropriate.</p>

<p>If you encounter an inauspicious year or month, pay obescience to this scrip ture seven times.</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke to Manjusri Bodhisattva, and what he ex pounded was this scripture. It has awesome spirit and awesome power. It can  save all beings from grave offenses and it can eradicate all karmic obstructions.</p>
<p>If there are monks and nuns, officials and administrators, laymen (upasakas),  good men and good women, whether wealthy or poor, whether of long or short  lifespan, they are all under the sway of the seven stars of the Northern Dipper.  If they hear this scripture and receive it, make offerings, and read it repeatedly,  and exhort friends and relatives, kith and kin, then in this life they will obtain  great fortune and in the next will attain rebirth in a heaven.</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters [whose kinsmen] have already died  and fallen into hell where they have received all sorts of bitter misery - if they  hear this scripture, revere it, and make offerings, then forthwith those who  have died will attain release from hell and be reborn in Sukhavati [Amitabha&rsquo;s  Pure Land].</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters who are injured by attacks of imps or  troubled by evil demons, or if evil dreams, weird occurrences, or dead souls  alarm them - then if they hear this scripture, receive it, and make offerings,  forthwith the dead souls will be pacified and they will always be free of fear.</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters, and if they serve as personal attendants  to an official and - if they encounter this scripture, revere it, and make offer ings, forthwith they will [themselves] attain promotion to official [status]. This  is great happiness.</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters, and if illness racks their bodies and  they seek relief, then they should, in a pure room, burn incense and make  offerings to this scripture. The illness will abate.</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters who desire advancement and through  goods-trading travel as brokers, seeking wealth, comfortable living, and pros perity - if they encounter this scripture, revere it, and make offerings, forth with they will attain the sought-after wealth and comfort they seek, and their  transactions will bring them great fortune.</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters, and if in raising silkworms [the co coons] are empty, or if in husbanding the six beasts are discontented, then in  a pure room, they should burn incense and make offerings to this scripture.  They will attain fields of silkworms according to their wishes, and their six  domestic beasts will multiply and [they] will never suffer injury or loss, disas ter, or obstruction.</p>
<p>If there are women who are pregnant and in difficulty at the time of partu rition, then if they encounter this scripture, revere it, and make offerings to it,  forthwith mother and child will be separated and the danger will be eliminated.  As a result, the children born to them will attain uprightness and long life as  a consequence of their previous good deeds.</p>
<p>If there are good sons and daughters, they should know that the seven stars</p>
<p>392 CHARLES D. ORZECH AND JAMES H. SANFORD</p>
<p>of the Northern Dipper control human destiny [and that this includes] an  entire lifetime&rsquo;s calamities [such as] official notice, disputes, loneliness, or [en counters] with various apparitions. If a person encounters this scripture and  reveres it and makes offerings [to it] not a single injury will [befall him]. At  that time Manjusri said, &ldquo;Good sons and daughters, [you should] revere it and  faithfully receive it.&rdquo; [Then] they bowed and dispersed.</p>
<p>Ritual Procedures for Invoking the Seven Stars of the  Northern Dipper</p>
<p>Translated by the Tripitaka master and South Indian brahmin Vajrabodhi.</p>
<p>At that time on behalf of all the unfortunate beings of the final age [of the  Dharma], the Tathagata expounded the mantra-teaching. At that time the sun,  moon, stars, and [lunar] lodges surrounded [the Buddha] and assembled like  clouds all around him, and in unison uttered this question, &ldquo;Would the Tath</p>
<p>agata expound for us the spirit-spell?&rdquo; At that time the World-honored One  uttered the eight-star spell:</p>
<p>Om sapta-jinaya bhajami jyaya jambu-dhama svami-naksatram bhavatu  svaha</p>
<p>This mudra and mantra come from the Seven Star section of the Sarvatatha gatatattvasamgraha [note: this section does not exist!].</p>
<p>The Buddha told Hungry Wolf, Ruiner of Armies, and the others, &ldquo;If there  are good sons and daughters who receive and maintain this spirit-spell and  preserve it, will you protect them or not?&rdquo; At that time the Eight Ladies an swered the World-Honored One: &ldquo;If someone chants this spirit-spell every day  their evil karma will certainly be completely eradicated and they will accom plish everything they wish. If, moreover, someone is able to chant this spirit spell 108 times each day, then forthwith he and all his kinsman will obtain our  protection. If, moreover, a person is able to chant it five hundred times [each  day] then, because of its awesome spiritual power, with a radius of five hundred  yojanas none of the mara [demon]-kings, the demon hordes, the obstructers,  or the numberless evil ghosts will dare to approach, and we will always protect  him. The Eight Ladies of the Northern Dipper, the sun, moon, stars, and lodges,  all the divine dragons (nagas) and dryads (yaksas) and those able to create  obstructions and difficulties at once will cease their obstruction. If someone  wishes to worship them, first arouse an altruistic mind and in a pure place  [suitable] for meditation take incense, flowers, drink, and food for offerings.  Recite the spirit-spell and make the mudra. If you make offerings thus, the  Eight Ladies and their retinue will manifest and in accord with one&rsquo;s wishes  they will serve you, and you will accomplish your limitless desires. If it is kingly  status you [desire, you] will have it - [therefore] how much more so the status  and glory of lesser worldly positions? If you want long life [they will] scratch</p>
<p>LADIE S OF THE DIPPE R 393</p>
<p>out your karmic register and restore your life register. If all the kings of states,  the princes, the great officers, those of the rear courts, and so on construct  mandalas in their palaces and pay obescience in accordance with the appro priate homa, the Eight Ladies of the Northern Dipper will be delighted. As a  result [you will] long abide in a superior position and constantly be happy.  The one hundred officers - those superior and those inferior - will be in har mony and not commit acts contrary to the teaching. The people will flourish  and the harvests will be abundant. The state will be at peace and without  disasters, and weird occurrences will not manifest. Sickness and death will not  arise, and all the criminals within the borders will naturally disperse. Therefore  keep this method secret from unbelievers and do not transmit it to the ignorant.  This is because those who are ignorant have minds that do not discriminate.  Being unable to grasp the intent of the teaching they give rise to doubt and  criticism. Although ignorant, those born of the Vajra [&ldquo;Diamond&rdquo;], sons of the  Vajra, and the like constantly chant and maintain the Buddha-Eye-Mother  mantra and [this teaching] ought to be transmitted to them. Though ignorant,  the Vajra-sons do not doubt or criticize and therefore they attain success with  the method. As for those who practice it, even in the joy of the Sukhavati they  profoundly reorient themselves toward attaining unsurpassed bodhi [enlight enment] .</p>
<p>Secret Essentials for Performing Homa to the Seven Stars of the  Northern Dipper</p>
<p>Compiled by Master Guanding of the scripture translation bureau of the Great  Xingshan monastery.</p>
<p>I will now, on behalf of the multitude of unfortunate beings of this latter age,  explicate the sequence of rites for making homa offerings to the seven stars of  the Northern Dipper.</p>
<p>In a pure room make a water altar - whether square or round, about a fore arm across is adequate. Take thatch incense, sweet pine [valerian] and cense  the area. Blend dragon-brain [Borneo camphor?], white sandalwood, and five flavor [Schizandra chinensis?] and daub it [on the altar]. Within the altar  around the hearth install drink, food, and fruit. Divide these in seven portions  and set them out. Food refers to congee [rice soup], cakes, koumiss [fermented  camels&rsquo; milk], and so on. But as for the choice among the five grains and  sapwood, they are to be selected according to a person&rsquo;s natal star.</p>
<p>First make a vow intoning these words: &ldquo;I earnestly request that the Seven  Luminaries, the venerable stars, the daras [the smashers], Hungry Wolf, Great  Gate, Wage Preserver, Literary Song, Pure and Upright, Military Song, and  Ruiner of Armies, on behalf of the patron so-and-so, [to] free him from danger  and lengthen his life so he will see one hundred autumns. I have constructed  this mandala and wish that you would condescend to take pity [on him] and3 9 4 CHARLE S D . ORZEC H AND JAME S H . SANFOR D</p>
<p>approach this place to accept this homa. Protect this patron so-and-so, free  him from disasters and lengthen his life in accordance with his heart&rsquo;s desire&rdquo;  (repeat this three times).</p>
<p>Next make the mudra, clasping your hands before your heart, take your  thumbs and press them on the nails of the third finger [such that] the middle  and little fingers are like a lotus blossom. Open and close your index fingers  slightly.</p>
<p>Next intone the monosyllabic Usnisa-raja mantra and the mantra for invok ing the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. The Usnisa-raja mantra is:</p>
<p>Nama samanta dara dara pacara hum</p>
<p>The mantra for invoking the Northern Dipper is:</p>
<p>Namah samanta darana ehyehi pax hai dai kai rax murdara gharaham svaha</p>
<p>Pick up the wood, the five grains, the koumiss, oil, etc., and throw it into  the hearth to incinerate it. Turn to examine [the patron&rsquo;s] natal star. If its  appearance scintillates and changes color and it shines with a yellowish-white  light, then you should make a vow to the Tathagata and in accordance with  the previous method do it for seven days and nights. You must not, in such  cases, approach this star, as it is concealed and may not be seen. Those referred  to as the seven stars of the Northern Dipper are the essences of the sun, moon,  and five stars [the planets]. In antiquity these comprised the seven luminaries  that shine in [all] eight directions. Above they shine on the celestial spirits, on  earth they shine down on men. They control good and evil and apportion  calamity and fortune. The host of stars report to them and the ten thousand  spirits bow before [them] in reverence. If someone worships and makes offer ings to them, that person will have long life and good fortune. He who does  not believe and revere them, his fortune will not last long.</p>
<p>The Book of Wages and Fate says, &ldquo;In the world is the spirit who is Comp troller of Fate. On each keng shen day (day fifty-seven in the sixty-day calen drical cycle) he turns to the Celestial Emperor to detail the good and evil that  people do. If a person [is guilty of] serious offenses then he receives the penalty  of destruction. If a person [is guilty of] lighter offenses then he loses twelve  years [of his life]. When the twelve-year [sentence] in the reckoning book is  announced as having elapsed, forthwith the Comptroller of Fate puts an end  to them.&rdquo; Therefore the Tathagata, on behalf of the multitude of beings in the  last generation who are of little fortune and short fate and who die prematurely,  has expounded this monosyllabic Usnisa-raja [mantra] and proceedures for  summoning and offering homa to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. On  behalf of those who make the offerings, these deities will order the appropriate  natal star to remove them from the death records and restore them to the life  records.</p>
<p>If all the kings of states construct mandalas in their palaces and in accordance  with this method offer homa and worship, then [the stars of] the Northern</p>
<p>LADIE S OF THE DIPPE R 395</p>
<p>Dipper will be delighted and therefore will protect you. You will long abide in  a superior station and you will continually receive peace and security. Ladies in-waiting, wives of high officials, concubines of the rear palaces, princes, the  multitude of officers, the three dukes, and the one hundred officials will be in  concord and will not act contrary to the Dharma. The people will multiply,  they will sow and reap bountifully, and the state will be at peace. There will  be no calamites, and incongruous events will not manifest themselves. Sickness  and death will not arise. Within the borders resentment and opposition and  the hordes of bandits will naturally flee and disperse. Therefore keep this  method secret!</p>
