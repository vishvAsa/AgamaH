  <p>John E. Cort</p>
<p>Tantra in Jainism has two distinctive features: it is largely centered around the  use of verbal spells or mantra, and Jain Tantric practices are aimed at improving  one&rsquo;s condition within the realm of rebirth rather than liberating one from rebirth.  Although Jain Tantric rites, such as that given in the second text below, also  involve the use of diagrams known as yantras, these play a subsidiary role com</p>
<p>pared to the mantras, and most yantras have the ritual mantra written on them.  Mantras are used directly to effect desired results, and to call on nonliberated  deities to effect those results. Jain Tantric rites rarely involve any elaborate form  of meditation or visualization; usually the simple repetition of the mantra suffices.  Some Tantric rituals invoke the central cultic figures of the tradition, the twenty</p>
<p>four Jinas or tlrthahkaras, the enlightened and liberated souls who showed the  path to liberation. More often, though, the rituals invoke other figures, such as  the wonder-working monk Gautama in the Svetambara (&ldquo;White-Robed&rdquo;) tradi tion, various goddesses in both the Svetambara and Digambara (&ldquo;Sky-Clad&rdquo;) tra ditions, and male figures such as Ghantakarna Mahavira and Nakoda Bhairava in  the Svetambara tradition.</p>
<p>According to Jain theology, however, none of these beings has the power to  grant liberation. The Jinas are inactive icons of the liberated state; the other deities,  although active in the world, are themselves unliberated, and so cannot give what  they themselves have not attained. As a result, most Jain Tantric rituals are aimed  at accomplishing a variety of goals in this world, such as health, wealth, and  power. The texts translated below are a veritable catalogue of these worldly goals.  Many Jain Tantric texts and rituals categorize these goals within the framework  of the &ldquo;six actions&rdquo; (satkarmani) of pan-Indian Tantra. What is not found in Jain  Tantra is the development of a full-scale alternative Tantric path to liberation such  as is found in some Hindu and Buddhist Tantric schools.</p>
<p>The cult of Ghantakarna Mahavira, &ldquo;Bell-Ears the Great Hero,&rdquo; exemplifies these</p>
<p>418 JOH N E. CORT</p>
<p>two distinctive features of Jain Tantra. (This Mahavira should not be confused  with Vardhamana Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and final tirthahkara of this era).  The worship of Bell-Ears is found exclusively among Svetambara Murtipiljaka  Jains, and in particular is special to one mendicant lineage, the Tapa Gaccha. He  is one of the fifty-two viras or &ldquo;heroes,&rdquo; a class of powerful male deities who  protect faithful Jains and defeat enemies of the Jain community. Bell-Ears is de</p>
<p>scribed as a fellow Jain, and so is dangerous only to the opponents of Jainism.  The traditional Sanskrit texts of the cult are the seventy-one-verse Ghantdkarna  Mantra Stotra, (a hymn that is also considered to be a mantra), and several Ghan takarna Mantras. The hymn was composed sometime in the latter half of the  sixteenth century by an otherwise unknown monk named Vimalacandra, who  was a disciple of Sakalacandra, who in turn was a disciple of the great leader of  the Tapa Gaccha, Hiravijayasuri (1527-1595).</p>
<p>These mantras were used in a variety of Tantric rituals performed over long  periods of time, by which the practitioner gained the allegiance of Bell-Ears and  so was able to gain the worldly powers associated with this deity. The nature of  these worldly powers, which ranged from cures for diseases and increasing one&rsquo;s  material wealth to defeating and even slaying foes of the Jain community, show  clearly that Jainism is as much about how to live successfully in the world as it  is about ascetic practices to liberate oneself from the world. The inclusion of  marana or killing foes in the list of Jain Tantric goals - although many Jain Tantric  texts exclude it - also shows that the Jain ethical injunction of ahimsa or non harm does not result in Jains being strict pacifists, as ahimsa is more applicable  in the sphere of dietary practices than in the sphere of relations among states and  religious communities.</p>
<p>For many centuries, the worship of Bell-Ears was a largely private aspect of  Jain practice, performed within certain monastic lineages, and possibly by some  laymen as well. Vimalacandra (verse 67) claims that this worship dates to the  time of the great Haribhadrasuri (c. sixth to eighth century), although there is no  other evidence to corroborate this. The nature of the transmission of the cult from  teacher to disciple is seen in the third text below, which describes the initiation  of Buddhisagarsuri (1874-1925) into the cult in the late nineteenth century. For  several decades, Buddhisagarsuri&rsquo;s practice was firmly within this largely esoteric  tradition. The texts translated here also indicate ways in which this Jain esoteric  tradition shared many practices and concepts with the pan-Indian yogic and Tan tric streams of religious expression, while giving them a distinctly Jain flavor.</p>
<p>Buddhisagarasuri effected an important change in the cult after his direct ex perience of Bell-Ears, when he established an anthropomorphic image of the deity  in a small shrine attached to the Jain temple at Mahudi in northern Gujarat. This  is the first known three-dimensional anthropomorphic image of Bell-Ears; pre viously he had been worshiped only in the forms of abstract and anthropomorphic  yantras. Toward the end of his life, Buddhisagarsuri was responsible for convert ing the cult into a highly public one. In part, Buddhisagarsuri&rsquo;s goal was to create</p>
<p>WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 419</p>
<p>a way for Jains to perform rituals aimed at worldly goals and still be good Jains.  According to Jain theology, the Jinas cannot respond in anyway to ritual petitions,  and so it is considered inappropriate and fruitless to worship the Jinas for worldly  ends. Worship of non-Jain deities is fraught with danger, especially as such wor</p>
<p>ship in the early twentieth century frequently involved sacrificing animals. Bud dhisagarsuri arranged for the construction of a much larger temple at Mahudi,  and wrote several hymns and rituals for the worship of Bell-Ears, including the  one translated as the fourth text below. In line with the transformation of the cult  from an esoteric one followed by initiated adepts into a public one followed by  hundreds of thousands of Jains, we also see in this text a reformulation of the  worship of Bell-Ears along more devotional (bhakti) lines than traditional Tantric  ones. Such interaction between Tantra and devotion has long been a feature of  all South Asian religious traditions.</p>
<p>The shrine of Bell-Ears at Mahudi is now one of the most popular Jain shrines  in all India. It is visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year, who  come to offer Bell-Ears his favorite food, a sweet dish known as sukhadi, in return  for his assistance in their lives. In particular, tens of thousands of people come  for the special worship of Bell-Ears on the day before Divali, the autumnal festival  of lights that also marks the New Year according to the western Indian calendar.  The worship of Bell-Ears is therefore an important aspect of insuring that any  possible malevolent influences from the previous year are negated, so that one  can start the new year with an auspiciously clean slate. Images of Bell-Ears are  also found in a growing number of Jain temples throughout western India.</p>

</ol>
<p>[Sanskrit invocation:] I bow to Ganesa, the giver of wealth and success, and  beloved son of the mountain-born Parvati. Now I tell the kalpa of Bell-Ears,  which removes enemies and troubles.</p>
<p>The best times for auspicious actions are an auspicious month, the bright  fortnight, and the fifth, tenth, and full moon in that fortnight. The auspicious  days and conjunctions are Sunday in the Hasta lunar mansion, Sunday in the  Mula lunar mansion, and Sunday in the Pusya lunar mansion. The best days  for killing (marana) and causing to flee (uccatana) are the eighth, fourteenth,  and new moon in the dark fortnight. The best conjunctions are Siddhi, Amr</p>
<p>tasiddhi, Ananda, Srivaccha, and Chatra. Before commencing, you should con sider the auspicious omens and the power of the lunar position in the horo scope for the performance of the mantsa.</p>
<p>The performance should be in a pure building, the walls of which have been424 JOHN E. CORT</p>
<p>attractively washed and rubbed with cow dung, or in a pure forest, in a garden,  on the banks of a river, in a temple, or else in your residence. The mantra for  purifying the earth is: &ldquo;Om hrim srim I bow to the earth deity.&rdquo; Recite this  mantra seven times while offering incense, lamp, and whole rice.</p>
<p>The mantra for bathing is: &ldquo;Om hrim klim I bow to Ganges water.&rdquo; Recite  this mantra seven times while bathing. The mantra for donning clothing is:  &ldquo;Om hrim klim I bow to the bliss deity.&rdquo; Recite this mantra while donning pure  clothing.</p>
<p>For a pure rite, meditate using the Bell-Ears mantra:</p>
<p>Om Bell-Ears Great Hero, destroyer of all ailments. Protect, protect those in  mighty fear of boils, Greatly Strong. Wherever you stand, O god, diseases and  gout are destroyed by the written lines of letters [of your yantra]. Instantly  from the recitation in the ear there is no fear of kings. Witches, ghosts, vam</p>
<p>pires, and demons do not arise. There is no untimely death, nor are snakes  seen, nor is there fear of fire or thieves, hrim Bell-Ears. Homage to you thah  thah thah svaha.</p>
<p>Recite this mantra 33,000 times over forty-two days. After that, recite it daily  108 times each at dawn, midday, and dusk. If you accompany the recitation  by offering black pepper and mustard seeds into a sacrificial fire, there will be  no fear of hostile deities. If you fear enemies, then offer a mixture of curds,  milk, ghee, saffron, and bdellium gum resin into the sacrificial fire, and estab</p>
<p>lish an anthropomorphic yantra (Figure 24.1). This will destroy fear of ene mies.</p>
<p>THE RITE OF THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC YANTRA</p>
<p>On the stomach of a human figure make twelve sections, and in them write  the twelve-syllabled mantra Om hrim srim klim sarvadusta nasanebhyah [Om  hrim srim klim for the destruction of all malevolence]. On the throat of the  figure write sri namah [obeisance to wellbeing], on the right hand sarva hrim  noma [obeisance to all], on the left hand satrunasane namah [obeisance to the  destruction of foes], on the right foot ram rim rum namah, and on the left foot  hvam hvim hum namah. Write the Bell-Ears Mantra around the border of the  figure.</p>
<p>Offer grain, lime paste, a coconut, and raisins into a sacrificial fire. Offer to  the yantra vermillion powder, and make a ring from cotton thread spun by a  young girl. You will be freed of fear of hostile deities, enemies, and kings, and  your fame will increase.</p>
<p>Here is another ritual with this yantra. On the day of Divali, eat a single meal  of rice pudding, set up an unextinguished lamp of ghee, light ten-scented in cense, and recite the mantra 12,000 times. Lie on the ground as if dead. After  the recitations, make an offering into the sacrificial fire of the five nectars [milk,  curds, ghee, honey, sugar], and you will see the form of your success in a dream.</p>

<p>THE METHOD FOR OBTAINING WEALTH (LAKSMI)</p>
<p>Recite the Bell-Ears mantra. Make a six-cornered yantra. In its six corners write  Om hlim hvim hum hlom namah. Write the Bell-Ears Mantra around the border.  Perform the following rite. To obtain wealth sit facing the west, wearing white</p>
<p>426 JOHN E. CORT</p>
<p>cloth, holding a white rosary, seated on a white cloth. With mind, speech, and  body in single-pointed attention, recite the mantra 125,000 times in seventy two days. While reciting eat once per day, and eat something made with wheat.  Offer into a sacrificial fire raisins, dried caroli fruit, almonds, and coconut.  Throughout offer incense, lamps, and food to the yantra. It is certain that after  six months you will obtain wealth. From maintaining the yantra you will obtain  all sorts of pleasure.</p>
<p>THE METHOD FOR SUBJUGATING OTHERS (VASIKARANA)</p>
<p>Recite the Bell-Ears mantra while seated facing north, wearing red cloth, hold ing a red rosary, and seated on a red cloth. Recite the mantra thrice daily (dawn,  midday, dusk) for a total of 225,000 times within forty-two days. Establish a  four-cornered yantra. Throughout this time offer incense, lamp, and food to  it. Offer into a sacrificial fire red sandalwood, pepper, and ghee. While making  the offerings, say the name of the deity whom you wish to subjugate. This can  be used either to imprison someone or free someone from prison. For this you  need to establish a yantra of 132 squares.</p>

<p>Buddhisagar&rsquo;s Initiation and Direct Vision of Ghantakarn</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It was Thursday, the eleventh of the bright half of the month of Fagan, in the  year v.s. 1954 [late February 1898 C.E.]. On that day in Vijapur, Ravisagar  decided to give the siddhamantra [mantra of success] of Bell-Ears, which was  in his mendicant lineage, to the young yogin Buddhisagar, who was his grand</p>
<p>disciple, and who was both most fortunate and firm in his practice. The practice  of constantly remembering this siddhamantra had come down in the lineage,  and by it those illustrious men had been saved from harassment by animals  and undesirable elements. But there had been no direct vision of the hero Bell</p>
<p>Ears, the presiding deity of the mantra, for two or three generations in the</p>
<p>WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 427</p>
<p>lineage. Ravisagar saw in the young Buddhisagar the power to generate a direct  vision.</p>
<p>As preparation for the initiation into the mantra, Ravisagar had instructed  Buddhisagar to consume only mung beans, rice, and water for one day, and to  maintain complete silence until midnight of the second day. At midnight on  the second day, Buddhisagar sat before Ravisagar . Ravisagar twice repeated  into his ear the nineteen-syllable mantra that had been passed down in the  lineage: Om hrim aim klim ghantakarna namostu mama karyani sidhyantu [Om  hrim aim klim praise to Bell-Ears may my actions be successful]. Then Ravisagar  used his right hand to rub vasksep [sandalwood powder that has been charged  by reciting a mantra over it] on the middle of Buddhisagar&rsquo;s brahmarandra  [crown of the head, from which spiritual energy can flow forth], and by press ing his hand gave saktipat [establishment of yogic power]. An awareness awoke  in Buddhisagar&rsquo;s entire body, and his six cakras [centers of yogic energy]  opened. Then for three days Buddhisagar followed his teacher&rsquo;s instructions  and recited the mantra.</p>
<p>On the first day of the recitation, Buddhisagar saw wheels of unlimited light,  star disks, and minute points in his ajna cakra [point between the eyebrows].  Then the points gradually opened up and became glowing lamps. The light of  the lamps came together in his forehead. In this light for a brief time he saw  the dim form of a black figure. On the second day, he became absorbed in an  indescribable bliss, and his ajna cakra glittered with a shining light. All six  cakras opened. All his kundalis [circles at the six cakras through which the  yogic power travels] were awake. His entire body experienced an unprece dented and stimulating sensation. On the third day, he had the same experi</p>
<p>ence. In three days he recited the mantra 27,000 times. Mantra-consciousness  was awake throughout his body.</p>
<p>After the three days, Ravisagar instructed Buddhisagar to incorporate this  supreme mantra in his life, and to give mantra initiation to those among his  followers who were suitable to recite it. Then he instructed Buddhisagar to sit  in one place and recite the mantra. Buddhisagar commenced the recitation,  reciting in his mind for eight hours every day. After nine months he had fin</p>
<p>ished 1,800,000 recitations. When he had finished 800,000, mantra-conscious ness awoke in him. After 1,000,000, he gained the power over dreams, after  1,400,000 he gained the ability to tell the future, and after 1,800,000 he gained  the power to untangle problems and ward off misfortune.</p>
<p>After he had finished the 1,800,000 recitations, Buddhisagar made a state ment of intention, in accordance with the science of mantra, to have a direct  vision of his chosen deity. He obtained Ravisagar &rsquo;s consent, and decided to to  go to Mahudi and there have a sacrifice performed by five laymen who were  dispassionate, faithful, and who daily recited the Navkar mantra [mantra to  the Jain spiritual hierarchy]. He instructed the five laymen that until the sac rifice was completed they had to maintain complete celibacy, renounce all  anger and wrong actions, and every day recite at least five cycles of 108 reci-</p>
<p>4 2 8 JOHN E. CORT</p>
<p>tations each of the Navkar mantra. For the sacrifice they had to wear white,  red, yellow, blue, and tan clothes. As an introduction to the sacrifice, Ravisagar  recited the Bell-Ears mantra.</p>
<p>On the day before the sacrifice, the sacrificial ground was prepared by wor shiping it at 4:00 A.M. in front of four young girls. Each girl held in her hands  a coconut, some sukhadi, and eleven and one-quarter rupees. The Ghantakarna  Mantra Stotra [Text 1] was recited three times. As the laymen offered the  coconut water on the ground to the ringing of a bell, a peacock suddenly  crowed. The sky began to lighten. A cowherd passed with his herd. A man  came running with some fragrant flowers and offered them. All of these were  taken as auspicious signs.</p>
<p>Before sunset, a three-tiered altar was constructed. It was painted white. In  the four cardinal directions Om was painted with sandalwood paste, and hrim  was painted in the four intermediate directions. Eleven and one-quarter rupees  in silver coins were placed on it, and vasksep sprinkled on them. Sweets were  placed on the coins, and this was all covered with a white cloth. Coconuts  were placed on the four corners of the cloth.</p>
<p>The fire was lit at the auspicious time of 10:15 in the evening. Buddhisagar  sat facing it. The five laymen took up their positions. They made 18,000 of ferings. The first sacrifice was made with bdellium gum resin, the second with  ghee, the third with five nectars of milk, curds, ghee, honey, and sugar, and  the fourth with sticks of wood. At 11:05 Buddhisagar started reciting the man tra. At 2:00 A.M. there was an unprecedented light in his ajna cakra. In the ajna  cakra he saw a divine form with bow and arrow in hand, a smiling face, a  powerful body, wearing golden clothes, a diamond-studded crown, and a di amond necklace. Twice he heard the words, &ldquo;attention, attention, blessing,  blessing.&rdquo; Buddhisagar folded his hands in thanks at the blessing, and per formed veneration. At the end he heard in his right ear the words, &ldquo;The god is  present right before you.&rdquo; For a while the deity was visible. Thus it was that  Buddhisagar, the great ascetic, the great king of yogins, the greatly fortunate,  greatly knowledgeable, and most worshipful, received that direct vision which  is difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>In the forest, in the field, at sea, on the earth, in the sky: you do what is  necessary for religion in the house and the royal court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing incense puja, counting your virtues, and taking correct faith into his  heart: Buddhisagar establishes the god of the teachings in the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Mantra: Om to Bell-Ears Great Hero, pacifier of illness and obstacles, granter  of desires, I sacrifice with incense for peace, satisfaction, and prosperity, svaha.</p>
<p>4 3 0 JOHN E. CORT</p>
<p>LAMP, THE SECOND PUJA</p>
<p>Refrain: Bell-Ears Great Hero, firm in strength, spread peace in the world. Your  glory is unprecedented, O Hero. Spread peace in the congregation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You beg for food not like a selfish beggar, but rather to observe the vows.  Jain devotees don&rsquo;t try to own you, they love you selflessly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I keep the vows selfishly, I hold to religion like a kinsman. I do the lamp  puja out of love, spreading the intention of nondesire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my entreaties I&rsquo;m not asking from you, for I am pleased in my love of  the soul. I help kinsmen from pure love. Daily I&rsquo;m absorbed in the supreme  truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You give shamelessly, O Hero, you help us. You give, but your glory isn&rsquo;t  besmirched. Your virtues are grounded in right faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The righteous people remain with the hero. Help us in religion. Our puja  is aimed at the lofty ones; keep us lowly ones in your meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your glory spreads throughout the world, yet doesn&rsquo;t block the sun. Remain  alert in this dark age, and from affection help your fellow Jains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May those who are fit to be friends remain firm in religion. Buddhisagar  directly experienced the message of Mahavir.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Mantra: Om to Bell-Ears Great Hero, I sacrifice with a lamp for peace, satisfac tion, and prosperity, svaha.</p>
<p>FLOWERS, THE THIRD PUJA</p>
<p>Refrain: Bell-Ears is a good hero within the teachings of the excellent Jina  Mahavir. He is a god who enjoys the teachings. Destroy the oppression of the  devotees, spread Jainism in the world, come and help the congregation, re member and help us.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You have a flower garland around your throat. My mind is established in  joy. My heart is pure from the love of god who is a fellow Jain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I request worldly things from the god who is a fellow Jain. When religion  is exhausted and in trouble, you protect your suffering fellow Jains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The god compassionately spreads happiness through strong divine medi cine. You do what is needed for devotees on the path to liberation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In their affection, men and women have good intentions in many lives.  Attaining the fruit of their desires, they fall into rebirth; but seeing them, you  lift them up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 431</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Hero, you are the chief devotee of the Excellent Jina God Mahavir. You are  deep like the ocean. Remain alert everywhere in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absorbed in the service of the Excellent Jina Mahavir&rsquo;s congregation, Bud dhisagar is in devotion, like a fish swimming in the water.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Mantra: Om to Bell-Ears Great Hero, I sacrifice with a garland of flowers for  peace, satisfaction, and prosperity, svaha.</p>
<p>SUKHADI, FOOD, THE FOURTH PUJA</p>
<p>Refrain: Bell-Ears Great Hero comes like a river of help. He helps these loving  righteous ones, he adorns them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are firm in your shrine. You give shelter in the name of the Supreme  Lord Mahavir. Your devotees sing their devotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They come seeking you in love and faith. Without devotion, they have no  claim. They offer the auspicious garland of victory, they wave the flag of fame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suddenly the earth shakes, suddenly Mount Meru trembles. But such is your  greatness that it incinerates all curses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You halt hostile foes, you spread Jainism throughout the world. You spread  the recitation of the name of the Lord Blessed Mahavir throughout the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your devotee offers an auspicious garland in his home to obtain wealth,  sons, and other success. You give all he desires, you spread peace of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the means by which merit arises. It spreads through faith, love, and  yoga. You apply yourself to the service of illuminating the teachings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great Hero appears directly to each devotee. The protector of the teachings  is sweet. The message of the Lord appears in Buddhisagar&rsquo;s heart.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Mantra: Om to Bell-Ears Great Hero, protector of the jina&rsquo;s teachings, I sacrifice  with a garland of flowers for peace, satisfaction, and prosperity; increase, in crease, do what is known, svaha.</p>
<p>COCONUT, THE FIFTH PUJA</p>
<p>Refrain: O come, come, come, come to me Great Hero. Strongly grace me with  the presence of faith and love, create knowledge of religion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dedicate yourself to Jainism and appear directly to the devotee. A string of  lotuses is above you. Don&rsquo;t come to nonbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You adorn the eyes of devotees who are lost in the form of your name. You  fulfill the devotion of the saints, you bring absorption in self-awareness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4 3 2 JOHN E. CORT</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>You are fond of the teachings, you illuminate religion, you love the Lord.  You perform the great service of the whole congregation and so attain to Su preme Lordship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May the righteous man who wants to do puja to you be firm in the wisdom  of religion. May Buddhisagar attain success, increase, and the glory of fame in  the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>FULL-POT SONG</p>
<p>Refrain: Sing loudly, sing of the hero of the teachings. Describe the fivefold  puja, the shelter for right faith and purity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do the puja of Bell-Ears Great Hero, and attain his virtues from singing.  Sing with joy the praises of the god of right faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mine is the Sagar branch of the Tapa Gacch, Nemisagar is my guru. Before  him were Ravisagar guru and Sukhsagar guru. Thus may Jainism grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May the whole congregation of monks and others increase. May they pro gress in all matters with the aid of his blessings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Immortal Third, 1978 [April 1922 C.E.] in the town of Vijapur, Bud dhisagar made offerings for three hours so men and women can attain happi ness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Mantra: Om to Bell-Ears Great Hero, remover of all niggling obstacles and  illness, granter of desires, I sacrifice with a fruit. Om arham Mahavira peace.</p>
<p>OFFERING OF THE LAMP (ARATI)</p>
<p>Refrain: Sing to Bell-Ears Great Hero, the strong-minded one who deserves  world fame.</p>
<p>1-2. Fulfiller of the mind&rsquo;s desires, remover of the devotees&rsquo; fears. Remover  of affliction, disease, and pain, alleviator of illness, affliction, and sorrow, you  quickly help those at your feet by giving wealth, success, and auspiciousness.  What is desired is obtained by remembering you. The auspicious time of the  devotee arrives.</p>
<p>3-4. O Bell-Ears Great Hero, men and women offer the lamp to you. Remover  of harsh worries and pain, remover of the mistakes against religion, roar loudly  in the world, in the home, on the ocean, in the forest. Help in arguments and  disputes so that auspiciousness isn&rsquo;t ruined by the wicked.</p>
<p>WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 433</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Bring peace in the country, city, and congregation. Increase the glory of the  devotees. Destroy obstacles and fears. May the world live in health and joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auspicious garlands shine in every house, stopping harmful influences. May  peace and joy shine forth. Come at once to those who remember you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soul, Mahavir and the teachings reign; this the devotees sing to the world.  In every moment help Buddhisagar in the worldly affairs of his soul.</p>
