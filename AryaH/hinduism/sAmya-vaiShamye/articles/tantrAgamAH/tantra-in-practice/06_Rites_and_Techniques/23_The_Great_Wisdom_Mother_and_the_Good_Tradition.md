Giacomella Orofino  

The tradition of Bdud kyi good yul (literally, "the demon as the object that is to  be cut off) is a medieval Buddhist practice developed in Tibet in the eleventh  century. Becoming widespread soon after the so-called period of the "new trans lations" of the Indian Buddhist Tantras in Tibetan, it was developed directly in  Tibetan rather than imported from India and translated from Sanskrit. It is a  syncretic movement that marks the confluence of Indian Tantric Buddhist and  pre-Buddhist Tibetan elements that are clearly shamanic in nature, which together  gave rise to a religious phenomenon with an identity of its own. It is based on a  complex literature that incorporated texts on dance, chanting, ritual music, the  nature of mystic hallucinations and visions, geomancy, exorcism, curing plagues,  and funeral rites. The basic principle of the practice involves annihilating the ego  by severing or "cutting off demons.  

This tradition was little known in the West prior to the last quarter century,  when it began to attract scholarly attention. The few Westerners who had pre viously described the good (pronounced cho) practice had provided only a su perficial analysis of it, more closely linked to the magicoreligious aspect of its  ritual than to its philosophic background and significance. The earliest data con cerning the doctrines of this practice had already arrived in the West before the  mid-nineteenth century, in the vague and somewhat mystifying descriptions left  by the early explorers of Tibet. This was followed in 1929 by the accounts of  Alexandra David-Neel, who described the good ritual in more detail, defining it  as a "macabre banquet" in which the officiant tramples all the passions underfoot,  "crucifying" the ego. In 1935 Evans-Wentz published the translation by Kazi  Dawa Samdup of The Laughter of the Dakinis (Mkha' 'gro gad rgyangs), one of the  most widespread ritual texts on good, from the collection of Klong chen snying thig  by 'Jigs med Gling pa (1730-1798). The German author compared it to a mystic  drama, akin to a mystery play, probably deriving from pre-Buddhist times. In  1953, George N. Roerich translated an entire chapter on the good yul system in  the Blue Annals, his English version of the Deb gter sngon po, one of the best-

T HE GOO D TRADITIO N 397  

known treatises on the history of Tibet, written between 1476 and 1478 by 'Gos  lo tsa ba Gzon nu dpal; and it is here that the Western reader could find for the  first time a brief hagiography of the most relevant female figure of this school,  Ma gcig Lab sgron (pronounced Ma chig Lab droun). Unfortunately Roerich, in  two other chapters of the Blue Annals, one on the New Tantras and the Lam 'Bras,  (the "Path and Its Fruit" teachings), and another on the lineages of the Zhi byed  doctrines, confused Ma gcig Lab sgron with Ma gcig Zha chung ma, a contem porary woman saint. This error, which led other scholars to confuse the two  yoginis, was identified in 1985 by Janet Gyatso in her thorough study of the good  tradition. Subsequently, since 1990, the Western public has had access to Ma  gcig's biography and to the foundations of good through the well-documented  studies of Karenina Kollmar Paulenz and the more popularized account by Jerome  Edou.  

In this essay I examine the central philosophy of the good school, its origins,  and its theoretical premises. This is followed by an analysis of the taxonomy of  the concept of "demon" from early Buddhism through Mahayana thought to its  subsequent development in good doctrine. This leads to an examination of the  relationship between Vajrayana Buddhism and the literature of Tantras in Tibet,  as well as a description of good practitioners, ritual objects, and the structure of  the practice. I also discuss the pre-Buddhist and shamanistic elements of death  and resurrection, exorcism, and decontamination. Finally, I outline Ma gcig's life  as a means of identifying the ways in which the main strands of this tradition  were developed in her practice. The translation is an excerpt from a poem attrib uted by the tradition to Ma gcig Lab sgron, the Great Collection of the Teachings  (Bka' tshoms chen mo), which was included among the good "root texts" by the  nineteenth-century Tibetan scholar 'Jam mgon Kong sprul (1813-1899) in his  compilation entitled the Treasury of Profound Instructions (Gdams ngag mdzod).  Although a complete Italian translation of this text has been published and a  German translation is in preparation, no English edition exists.  

The colophon to the Great Collection of the Teachings states that the poem is a  work by Ma gcig and that it should be considered to be the basis for all the good  doctrines. This work is renowned by Tibetan tradition as that saint's spiritual  testament, and the text that, more than any other, expresses her thought in a clear  and essential way. We find in it an analysis of the theory of the "four demons"  according to good tradition. Starting from the principle that the root of all demons  is to be found in one's own mind, Ma gcig examines the mechanisms that form  the basis of human suffering, concluding with the consideration that all demons  can be incorporated into those of ego-clinging and pride. Her analysis has an  apophatic connotation that reminds us of the Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wis dom) literature, and especially of Nagarjunian thought which holds that supreme  reality is neither conceivable nor obtainable through concepts. In this way, her  analysis of the mind is transformed into a hymn to the absolute reality, pure in  its essential nature and free from religious dogma. It offers us considerable insight  into one of the most remarkable traditions of medieval Buddhism.

Theoretical Premises  

In the good system, liberation from the fetters of existence can only come about  through the annihilation of pride. The foremost demon to be severed is attach ment to the ego, and all that flows from it: pride, vanity, arrogance, and pre sumptuousness. This is the fundamental cause of human ignorance and the true  obstacle to conquering the suffering of existence and awakening to supreme  knowledge. In more general terms, annihilation of the self is the axis around which  the whole of Buddhist philosophy has turned from its very inception. In this  system, however, cutting off the ego takes on a very specific connotation, as it is  based not so much on philosophical speculation as on ritual procedure that,  teeming with elements of considerable emotional charge, is deeply rooted in the  ancient pre-Buddhist traditions of Tibet. The main rite in good is a sacred drama  in which the officiant, dancing and chanting to the rhythm of a two-headed drum  and the sound of a trumpet made from a human thighbone, invokes all the spirits  

and gods of the universe and offers them the gift of his body.  It is not easy to establish the phases of the historical development of this tra dition. According to Tibetan historical tradition, the good system originated in  certain Indian Buddhist schools, the foremost being that of the Pacification of  Suffering, which was founded by Pha Dam pa Sangs rgyas, a Buddhist master  who lived between the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth  centuries. Another important person in the line of transmission was the brahman  Aryadeva, who some texts identify as Pha Dam pa's uncle. This master is obviously  not the philosopher Aryadeva, the contemporary of Nagarjuna who played such  a major part in the formulation of Madhyamika thought; nor is he the Tantric  Aryadeva, disciple of the Tantric Nagarjuna who may have lived in the eighth or  ninth century. According to tradition, the brahman Aryadeva was the author of  a short text called the Teaching on the Perfection of Wisdom that is considered to  be the theorical basis of the good philosophy, which was translated into Tibetan  by different authors. A copy of one these versions is also preserved in the Peking  Tengyur (bstan 'gyur) (vol. 146, pp. 171-72).  

Giving up one's body was already a cherished topic of ancient Buddhism, as is  evident in certain stories of the Buddha's previous lives (jataka), including those  of the tiger and of the hare. In AryaSura's rendition of the jataka of the tiger, the  Buddha, before offering his body as food to a starving tigress that was on the  verge of eating her own cubs, uttered these words:  

This body of ours is devoid of life, fragile, insubstantial, the source of suffering,  unrewarding, always impure. He who is unwilling to offer it for the good of others  is foolish! Attachment to our own pleasure and the impossibility of alleviating our  suffering render us indifferent to others' suffering. However, why should I remain  indifferent to this suffering as long as it exists and as long as it is possible to alleviate  it? For if, having the opportunity to alleviate someone's suffering, even if he were the 

THE GOO D TRADITIO N 399  

greatest malefactor, I were to remain indifferent, then I would feel I had committed  a transgression and my mind would burn like dry twigs in a fire. So I will hurl myself  down from this cliff and kill my miserable body, so that the tiger will not have to  kill her cubs, so that these will not be set upon by their mother.  

The theoretical premises of the good yul system must be sought, however, in  the Buddhist Prajnaparamita literature, a corpus composed in India in successive  stages from the first century to the end of the first millennium C.E., and which  constitutes the foundation of Mahayana mysticism. In the Prajnaparamita tradi 

tion, the Perfection of Wisdom is depicted as a mother goddess, the mother of  all the buddhas and bodhisattvas. This element, which comes to be grafted onto  such a strongly patriarchal religion as ancient Buddhism, may reflect the cult of  the mother goddess that distinguished the matriarchal societies of the Dravidian  populations of south India. This literature ascribed great importance to prajna,  wisdom or gnosis. Etymologically, the words gnosis and prajna derive from the  same Indo-European stem, and many scholars have pointed out that the Prajna paramita literature shares certain elements with the religious and philosophical  traditions that derive from the Hellenistic mysticism that was developing during  the same period in the Mediterranean area.  

Like the Perfection of Wisdom, all of the various gnostic systems, both Christian  and pagan - Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Neopythagoreanism, and Hebrew wis dom lore - are based on the principle that awakening can only take place through  an inner process of knowledge. This knowledge of ultimate reality, in contrapo sition to ignorance (avidya), can only arise from direct revelation. Moreover, just  as in Indian Mahayana Buddhism, so too in the gnostic traditions of the Medi terranean and the Near East, Wisdom is a magna mater, likened to ethereal space,  pure and immaculate as sunlight, who metes out divine ambrosia.  

In the Perfection of Wisdom literature, phenomenal reality is deemed a dream,  a mirage, a magical apparition, an illusion. It is only by generating prajna within  oneself that one can rend the veil of ignorance and see the ultimate nature of all  existence (dharmata). Thus, the concept arises of two truths - one provisional  and conventional, the other absolute and definitive. However, the dualism that  might appear to arise from this subdivision has already been surmounted in this  phase of Buddhism, since phenomenal reality, being devoid of self-existence, is  identical with the absolute truth. This truth, however, is ineffable, beyond the  imagination, without form or characteristics, and totally empty.  

Alongside emergent speculation on the notion of emptiness (sunyata), a new  ideal starts taking shape within the Greater Vehicle literature; this is the ideal of  the bodhisattva, who, like the Buddha, has perceived the supreme truth and yet  who renounces nirvana - the complete and definitive extinction of worldly suf 

fering, for the benefit of others - and chooses to continue taking birth in the cycle  of samsara in order to help others on their path towards liberation. This new ideal  of love for others is most clearly expressed in a work by the eighth-century Indian  mystic Santideva, the Bodhicaryavatara, ("The Bodhisattva's Conduct"), a treatise 

4 0 0 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

of great spiritual force on compassion and love, which analyzes the inner path of  the bodhisattva from the resolution to dedicate oneself to the good of others, to  the disciplines (mindfulness, patience, enthusiasm, meditation, etc.) that help to  maintain the pledge, up to the attainment of the actual capacity to benefit others.  From Santideva's text (8.129) we read:  

All the joy of this world  

derives from the wish for anothers' joy;  

all the suffering of this world  

derives from the wish for one's own joy.  

In these words we find already delineated the thought that underlies the good  system, in which, analogously, attachment to the ego is identified as the factor  that determines the suffering and ignorance proper to the human condition. Com passion (karuna) and awareness of emptiness are thus the fundamental principles  that underlie the religious literature of the Perfection of Wisdom, which is the  source of the good system. It should be noted, moreover, that at times in this  tradition the term good ("to sever") is replaced by spyod (pronounced in the same  way), which means "practice" or "spiritual exercise," which refers precisely to the  virtuous acts and practices of the Bodhisattva path.  

The Demons  

A significant feature of this system is a demonology of sorts, which comprises an  accurate analysis of the various demons (mara in Sanskrit; bdud in Tibetan) that  hinder awakening and hence must be uprooted and removed. The etymological  derivation of mara (which is also the symbol of the presence of evil in early  Buddhism) is the Sanskrit root mr-, "to die," whence mrtyu, "death." However,  whereas mrtyu indicates the act of death, mara stands for "he who causes death."  In Buddhist literature, both Pali and Sanskrit, Mara is the tempter, the offender,  who arouses sensual desire, and assails the Buddha to distract him from the  spiritual path. He is the demon who holds and binds men in chains, forcing them  to perpetuate a life that is under the power of death.  

We should take note, however, of the ambivalence of Mara's name. On the one  hand, it designates a popular god with his own place within the cosmology of  early Buddhism: leader of the Paranirmitavasavartin gods and lord of the realm  of desire; on the other hand, it reflects the etymological meaning of "he who  causes death," and Mara is thereby associated with everything that is deceptive,  transient, or that brings about spiritual death. These various aspects were sub 

sequently codified in the Greater Vehicle in the formula of the four maras. The  Mahaprajnaparamitasastra reads: "There are four kinds of mara: Mara of the ag gregates (skandha-mara), Mara of the mental afflictions (klesa-mara), Mara of death  (mrtyu-mara), and Mara, son of the deities (devaputra-mara). The metaphorical  function of the four maras in relation to spiritual death is explained in the follow-

THE GOOD TRADITION 401  

ing way in the Sravakabhumi of Asanga, the fifth-century Buddhist philosopher of  the idealist Cittamatra ('Mind Only') school: Skandha-mara corresponds to the  five aggregates that constitute the personality. Klesa-mara corresponds to the pas sions that range over the three worlds. Mrtyu-mara fixes the moment of death of  sentient beings. Devaputra-mara is the son of the gods, born in the realm of desire  and thus lord over it, who leads those who aspire to transcend the aggregates,  passions, and death astray from the practice of virtue." The personage of Mara is  also present in the Perfection of Wisdom literature. One of the most ancient texts  of this tradition, the Prajnaparamita-ratnagunasamcayagatha, "Stanzas on the Per fection of Wisdom, Heap of Precious Virtue," the original kernel of which prob 

ably dates back to the first century B.C.E., reads (27.447-49):  

If as many beings as there are in the fields - countless as the sands of the  Ganges - would all, let us assume, become maras;  

And if every single hair on their bodies would again magically create a snare, they  could all not hinder the Wise.  

For four reasons does the powerful and wise bodhisattva  

Becomes unassailable by the four maras:  

Because he dwells in the emptiness;  

Because he does not abandon other beings;  

Because he acts as he speaks;  

Because he is sustained by the Sugatas.  

In the Blue Annals, these verses are indicated as the foundation of the theory  and practice of the good system. The four principles listed therein: awareness of  emptiness, love for one's neighbor, observance of Bodhisattva conduct, and de votion to one's master and spiritual lineage constitute the pivots of the conduct  of good practitioners. In this system, however, the interpretation of the aspects of  Mara is developed still further. The four categories are multiplied, reflecting the  multifarious nature of Vajrayana esotericism, with a division of the symbol of evil  under two headings: "outer" and "inner." Later works add further subdivisions:  the "secret" and the "particular" maras.  

The outer maras correspond to those of Indian Mahayana literature, listed  above. The analysis of the four demons that we find in Ma gcig's work, on the  other hand, refers to the "inner" maras and subdivides them into "tangible," "in tangible," "of complacency," and "of pride." The tangible demons (thogs bcas kyi  bdud, literally, "demons that have obstructions") belong to visible reality and con sist of all the phenomena which, through sensory experience, arouse desire and  the thirst for possession in people, and enhance the sense of concreteness and of  the material reality of phenomena, the worst error according to Buddhist doctrine.  The intangible demons (thogs med kyi bdud, "demons that do not have obstruc tions") comprise purely mental events. They arise when the categories of good  and evil are separated in the mind and one distinguishes between what one wants  and what one rejects. This discrimination is the cause of the continuous alter nation between illusion and delusion that generates emotional instability and lack 

402 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

of awareness of ultimate reality. The demons of complacency (dga' brod kyi bdud)  comprise all those factors that lead to feeling complacent about results obtained  regarding philosophical knowledge and powers acquired through the practice of  yoga. In reality, these cause obstacles and block spiritual progress. The demons  of pride (snyems byed kyi bdud) give rise to haughtiness and arrogance. These are  the most important of the demons, as they give rise to all the others, because  attachment to the ego is deemed the first cause of the death of knowledge.  

Cutting off Mental Afflictions  

The theme of cutting off mental affliction was already known in earlier Buddhist  thought: It occurs in the Hinayana (Lesser Vehicle) school, as attested in Bud dhaghosa's Visudhimagga, which states that "relinquishment by means of cutting  off takes place in the one who cultivates the supermundane path leading to the  destruction of contaminations." According to the Blue Annals, the origin of the  term good ("cutting off) is found in the Abhidharmakosa, the summa of Sarvasti vadin-Vaibhasika thought compiled in the fifth century C.E. by the Indian phi losopher Vasubhandu:  

Now, why is this practice defined "the object that is to be cut off (good yul)? In  Vasubhandu's Abhidharmakosa (5.34) it says: "Mental afflictions originate: 1. from  habitual attachment (anusaya); 2. from the presence of external objects; and 3. from  erroneous mental acts." What have to be cut off are mental afflictions. If these afflic 

tions originate from attachment, from the presence of external objects, and from  erroneous mental acts, then as soon as the yogin comes into contact with an external  object and traces of past actions (vasanas) arise within him, he must cut off at the  root those afflictions [deriving] from objects that are based on erroneous mental acts.  This is the reason why this system is called "the object that is to be cut off (good  yul).  

Vajrayana Buddhism  

The Buddhist Tantras, which constitute the final phase of Indian Buddhist liter ature, constitute a highly complex religious phenomenon, in which Mahayana  thought coalesced with popular traditions and cults of ancient India to form a  mystical and gnostic system that was highly symbolical in character. It was called  the Diamond Vehicle or Vajrayana (from vajra, the "diamond" as symbol of the  perfect and immutable nature of ultimate reality), and the Mantra Vehicle or  Mantrayana (from mantra, the sacred formulas that were of crucial importance in  this system).  

The first promulgators of Vajrayana Buddhism, called Siddhas ("perfect ones"),  were yogins, mostly wanderers, living in various regions of India in the medieval  period. These ascetics - among them several women - who had absorbed the 

THE GOOD TRADITION 403  

classical Buddhist theses (the suffering of existence, the transient and fundamen tally empty nature of phenomena, and so on), elaborated a system that gave much  attention to the practice of yoga. Furthermore, they maintained that the passions  which characterize human nature, such as sexual desire, were no longer deemed  negative factors to be repressed; instead, the energy they provided constituted the  principal means of liberation from the fetters of existence.  

The behaviour of the Siddhas contravened the rules and conventions of the  Buddhist monastic communities and contemporary society. Like a kind of sacred  madness, their quest for ultimate truth and the fundamental identity of all phe nomena led them to wander far from towns and to live with outcastes, to eat meat  and other impure foods, to drink alcohol, and lie with women - without discrim inating. The teachings of the Tantras had a strongly esoteric and initiatory char acter, and the very words of the sacred texts were incomprehensible without the  associated initiation and a master's guidance.  

The spiritual heritage of Tantric Buddhism was readily received in Tibet. The  Tantras were translated into Tibetan, along with the earlier Buddhist literature,  in two successive phases, in the eighth and eleventh centuries. These translations  were then arranged and systematized in the Buddhist literary compilations called  Kangyur (bka' 'gyur), composed of texts that were considered to be the "word"  (bka) of the Buddha himself, and Tengyur (bstan 'gyur), the commentarial writ 

ings. These canons include thousands of works, and are of critical importance to  the history of Asian religion, inasmuch as within them are preserved numerous  texts, of which the Sanskrit originals no longer exist.  

To return to the origins of the good tradition, we read further in the Blue Annals  ('Gos lo tsa va, 870):  

"How can one assert that good is similar to the Tantras? Because it conforms to the  Hevajratantra.  

"Good meditation is meditation performed under a lonely tree, in a cemetery, at  night, in the places of the Terrible Mothers (matr, in Sanskrit; ma mo in Tibetan) or  in remote places" (Hevajratantra VI.6).  

Furthermore:  

"Having offered his body as a gift, he can start the practice" (Hevajratantra VI. 19);  and:  

"Whatever demon appears before him, even if it resembles Indra, he will not be  afraid, because he steps forward like a lion" (Hevajratantra VI.25).  

The three topics indicated in the Hevajratantra - the choice of terrifying places,  above all cemeteries; the ritual offering of one's body; and overcoming fear - are  of such importance in the good system as to be considered the fundamental rules  for practitioners of this religious system. The good pa (good practitioners) were  yogins who had given up the world and all social conventions to wander from  one cemetery to another, carefully selecting for their practice places that were  desolate and particularly fearful. cemeteries in Tibet were grim, uninhabited  places, where corpses were devoured by vultures and wild animals. The fear404 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

engendered by these places, frequented by ravenous beasts hunting for remains  of the cadavers, must have been great, especially at night.  

Like the other Tantric yogins, the good yogins wore ragged clothing, but were  recognizable by certain characteristic ritual good objects: a damaru, the two headed drum played in one hand, thereby enabling the yogin to dance with the  other hand free to accompany his chant with the rkang gling (a trumpet made  from a human or vulture's thigh bone, whose sound evoked demonic spirits); a  ritual bell; the skin of a predatory animal with the claws still intact, a symbol of  courage and power; a folding tent, his only shelter against bad weather and symbol  of his high aspirations; a trident, which also served to support his tent; a skull  (kapala) used as a bowl for his daily meal, a banner made of strips of tiger and  leopard skin; a braid of human hair; and a rectangular red hat. This attire was  somewhat reminiscent of the garb of the Kapalikas, the Saiva sect that took the  concepts of Hindu Tantra to extremes, and in which a very important religious  role was played by human skulls and bones.  

The Structure of the Good Practice  

The practice of good began with a sacred dance in which, to the rhythm of the  damaru and the sound of the rkang gling, the yogin visualized himself dancing  on his own ego and trampling his dualistic thoughts, fears, desires, and all the  fetters of samsara. He danced before the buddhas, the Tantric deities, and the  dakinis. These latter goddesses, already present as minor figures in the Indian  pantheon, acquired great importance in Vajrayana, where they were considered  to be the hypostases of the active energy that arises from wisdom; they were  depicted - as attested in the sacred art of Tibet - as female deities who had both  a peaceful and attractive, and a terrifying and disquieting mien. In Kahha's 800  to 850 C.E. Yogaratnamala, one of the few commentaries of the Hevajratantra  extant in Sanskrit, we read (2.3.3) that "dakini derives from the root dai, which  means to fly in the sky and which corresponds to the power (siddhi) of moving  anywhere in the sky." As a consequence, the Tibetans translated this word as  mkha' 'gro ma, "she who flies in space," ascribing a pivotal religious role to these  goddesses. In this case, "space" means the essential condition of reality, the pure  unconditioned state, the ground of all existence; flight in this dimension indicates  the dynamic capacity of transcendent wisdom to turn into action. As we read in  the lives of the saints and mystics of Tibet, however, the dakinis can, in addition  to belonging to metaphysical reality, also take on the form of flesh-and-blood  women, whose tasks it is to aid yogins and to spread and protect the doctrines.  

Good, elaborated by a woman, presided over by a female deity, with a ritual  charged with emotional force, became the dakini practice par excellence. The  Laughter of the Dakinis states:  

I, fearless yogin, practicing  

to unite samsara and nirvana, 

T HE GOO D TRADITIO N 405  

dancing on the deities and spirits of the ego,  

reduce to dust the discursive thought  

of transmigration  

that generates dualism.  

This dance is followed by the evocation of all kinds of gods and spirits, invited  to attend the ritual sacrifice of one's body. The good pa visualizes the transfor mation of his consciousness into a dakini, who cuts the head off his physical body  and then places the corpse inside the cranium, which stretches to cosmic pro portions. The corpse is subsequently transformed in accordance with the wishes  of the guests, multiplied infinitely, and offered to them as a gift. Then the offering  is divided into various categories: the white offering, in which the yogin visualizes  that his body is transformed into ambrosia to be consumed by the higher deities  and by the three jewels: the buddhas, devas, and dakinis; the multicoloured of fering, in which his body is transformed into all kinds of riches and material  goods and offered to the dharmapalas, the protector spirits of the Buddhist law;  the red offering, in which the dismembered flesh and blood are multiplied infi nitely to appease the demons and fierce spirits; and finally the black offering, in  which the officiant visualizes that all the errors and wrongdoings of the world are  absorbed into his body, which is then offered as a meal to the demons. These  offerings aim to satisfy all spirits, both higher and lower, in order to placate  negative impulses and to eliminate definitively the ills of the world.  

Having performed the sacrifice, the yogin, who has now transcended hope and  fear, is absorbed in absolute reality. This is the most solemn moment of the drama:  the gift of the teaching to all the evoked beings and to the entire world. Through  this gift, which encapsulates the ultimate meaning of the entire rite, redemption  for oneself and others is assured and supreme catharsis realized.  

The good practitioners are aware of the psychological significance of this ma cabre banquet. According to the texts, the deities (lha) evoked during the ritual  are the symbolic images of his desires and wishes while the evil spirits ('dre) are  nothing but projections of the practitioner's mind, embodiments of his disquiet  and fear. Offering one's body and dancing on one's ego represent the means of  eliminating discrimination between good and evil, between desire and aversion - the dichotomy that all Buddhist thought deems the root cause of all suffering. In  Ma gcig's Great Collection we read:  

Practicing good in terrifying places  

is like healing injuries  

wreaked by fire  

by cauterizing with fire.  

This teaching,  

which consists in stirring, cutting off,  

driving back, and subjugating [the demons]  

and which arouses strong sensations, is like  

healing through application of fire. 

406 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

In the good system, the horror the yogins seek by evoking demonic spirits in  terrifying places is a metaphor for the anguish and fears that characterize human  existence. These can only be eliminated by doing away with one's pride and  desires, which derive from attachment to oneself. The exacerbation of fear thus  becomes the method for definitively conquering fear itself. Ma gcig's text goes on  to explain the reason for choosing places that engender fear, and for the visuali zations of demonic spirits or other dreadful apparitions. All this is defined as the  necessary condition (pratyaya) for ripening the cause of liberation inherent in  every being:  

As the appearance of the conditions  

is like a weight getting heavier,  

one comes to understand that the secret method  

lies precisely in making the weight heavier.  

Unless all reality is made worse  

one cannot attain liberation  

by means of soothing and pleasing antidotes.  

Wander in grisly places and mountain retreats,  

do not let yourself get distracted  

by doctrines or books:  

no spiritual power can come from them.  

So, just get real experiences  

in horrid, desolate places.  

The Pre-Buddhist Elements  

The Buddhist elaboration of the theme and practice of good is grounded in mag icoreligious traditions and popular creeds in which archaic elements are easily  perceptible. For example, the good initiatory ritual often uses the expression  "opening the door of the sky" (nam mkha' sgo 'byed), which denotes ascension to  a state of transcendent consciousness. This same expression is also found in the  popular religion of Tibet, where it designates ascent into the celestial sphere by  means of the magic rainbow light cord (dmu). According to ancient narratives  about the epoch of the monarchy, the dmu cord was used by the early kings to  descend to earth and then reascend to heaven after their death. To this day, this  term refers to the center of a house or tent, above which a hole is made to allow  daylight and smoke from the hearth to pass. The dmu cord is the symbol of  communication between earth and sky: this word is also found in divinatory rites,  in which it connotes the "cord for ascending to the sky," as well as in other popular  apotropaic rituals.  

Moreover, it should be noted that in terms of the dramatic intensity of the ritual  procedure, the good practices of dismembering and offering the body to the spirits  recall the initiatory dismemberment of the future shaman by demons and the 

THE GOOD TRADITION 40 7  

souls of his ancestors, found among Siberian and Central Asian as well as North  and South American, African, and Indonesian peoples.  

Apart from ritual dismemberment, which partakes of the universal phenome non of death and resurrection found in many archaic traditions, it is possible to  discern other significant elements in the good system that evince traces of sha manism, such as the important ritual function of the sound of the thighbone  trumpet and the drum as instruments serving to contact "the spirit world." More over, it should be noted that the good pa, like the shamans in nearby Buryatia,  serve a particular role in Tibetan society by virtue of their position as exorcists of  the possessed and healers of illnesses - such as plague or other epidemic dis eases - that are popularly believed to be caused by demonic spirits. In Tibet there  was great fear of epidemics, both of humans and livestock, because they presented  a serious threat to the local, and particularly the nomad, economy. On these  occasions, the only persons authorized to touch the dead were the good pa, who  were summoned even from afar to perform the funerary and purificatory rites.  According to tradition, the good practitioner has transcended all forms of fear, as  he has overcome all dualistic considerations created by the ordinary mind con cerning good and bad, pure and impure, and so on. In this way he cannot be  assailed by demons and fierce spirits, and acquires the power to subjugate them  and to heal the diseases they inflict.  

Ma gcig Lab sgron between History and Myth  

According to her biographers, Ma gcig lab sgron was born in the region of E'i Lab  southwest Tibet in the middle of the eleventh century, during a period of great  religious and cultural ferment. Born into a Buddhist family, and bearing all the  signs that indicate an extraordinary birth, she displayed an early inclination to  study the sacred scriptures. From the time she was a child, she had the oppor 

tunity of assimilating the basic principles of Buddhist thought, in particular those  found in the Perfection of Wisdom texts, of which she was an expert reader.  Already at the age of ten she could read four volumes a day, six times faster than  other experts, and so she was called Lab sgron, the "Light of the Lab region,"  because of the knowledge and wisdom she was soon able to display.  

Orphaned at the death of her mother, she became a reader in the monastery  of Lama A ston. However, the disciple soon surpassed her master and, as he had  nothing more to teach her, he sent her to one of the major lamas of the time, the  famous gter ston Grwa pa Mngon shes, the discoverer of the Four Tibetan Medical  Tantras. For four years Ma gcig remained with this master of the ancient tradition,  who taught her the Prajiiaparamita teachings in depth. Subsequently, she received  teachings from Lama Bsod nams Grags pa, who initiated her into the esoteric  meanings of the doctrines. The hagiographies of Ma gcig recount that thanks to  these teachings she had a deep intuition of the Prajnaparamita; she was especially  struck by the chapter on demons (mara), and through this experience she stabi-

408 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

lized her knowledge and was liberated from the dualism of samsara. This episode  can be interpreted as the first acknowledgement by her Tibetan biographers of  Ma gcig's independence of religious thought, which was then subsumed and or ganized in the good system. Due to her awakening, Ma gcig utterly abandoned  worldly conventions, threw away her clothes, donned rags, and went to live with  lepers and outcasts.  

Subsequently, the yogini completed her religious training, receiving instruction  from several masters of the various Buddhist schools. According to tradition, the  most significant spiritual encounter of her life was with Pha Dam pa Sangs rgyas,  the Indian Mahasiddha who introduced the religious tradition known as sdug  bsngal zhi byed (The Pacification of Suffering) into Tibet. His teachings were  aimed at liberating humans from every form of suffering through the process of  the gradual elimination of all attachments and passions. Pha Dam pa is still very  popular in Tibet, especially in such areas as the Ding ri Valley in the southwest  of the country, not far from the Nepal border, where he plays a significant role  in connection with the the local folklore and cult of sacred rocks. He was famous  for both his great yogic capacity and his iconoclasm: in fact he destroyed all the  depictions of deities that he found, deeming them sources of delusion. He used  to exhort his disciples to consider ritual ceremonies and philosophical disserta tions as a kind of attachment, and would advise them to leave their monasteries  to go practice in the solitude of forests or mountain hermitages. According to one  of her biographers, Pha Dam pa immediately entrusted Ma gcig with his spiritual  testament, telling her, "Accept what disgusts you. Help those it seems impossible  to help. Give up all the things you desire. Go to frightening places such as cem eteries. Always remain vigilant and aware. Find the Buddha within yourself."  According to certain accounts, this first encounter took place in Ma gcig's youth,  although it was only subsequently, when she was an adult, that the yogini received  the various initiations of sdug bsngal zhi byed and good from the siddha. How ever, recent studies have cast doubts on the centrality and importance ascribed  by the Tibetans to Pha Dam pa in the constitution of the good system.  

All of her biographers tend to highlight the autonomy of Ma gcig's religious  inspiration. An episode - recounted in the Blue Annals and told in greater detail  in one of her biographies (Rnam bshad, 35-38) - which occurred during the  initiation of the Tantric cycle of Mahamaya (sgyu 'phrul chen mo) conferred by  Skyo ston Bsod nams bla ma, will serve as an example. We examine here the  account drawn from the Rnam bshad, as it contains an abundance of symbolic  details.  

The initiation rite had been celebrated during the night, and when at dawn the  lama was preparing to commence the most important phase of the ceremony, in  which he conferred the Wisdom initiation, Ma gcig had a direct intuition of the  teachings and suddenly withdrew from the temple. The yogini, who had entered  a deep contemplative state, rose into the air, dancing the sacred dances of the  peaceful goddesses, and teaching in Sanskrit. When she had finished the dance,  she alighted on a tree that was near a lake inhabited by a terrible and much feared 

THE GOO D TRADITIO N 409  

snake (naga). Ma gcig, who felt no fear of that demonic being, remained in deep  meditation for a long time. Both angered and intimidated by the yogini's presence,  the demon called a throng of other demons and spirits who assailed her, seeking  to terrify her, but the saint did not let herself be frightened by those monstrous  beings and instead offered them her body. The Rnam bshad biography recounts  that the demons could not harm her because they had not found any form of ego  in her to attack. After she had conquered the demons, all the divine manifestations  of the Mahamayatantra and the Cakrasamvara, all the buddhas of the ten direc 

tions, as well as the goddess Aryatara herself came and conferred on Ma gcig the  four Tantric initiations and numerous other spiritual instructions. Then Aryatara  predicted: "Yogini, you will help all sentient beings and will practice in the 108  cemeteries and terrifying places. Your teachings will shine like the sun high in  the sky and your disciples will attain the knowledge from which there is no  turning back."  

As soon as day broke, the lama and the others participating in the rite went  looking for Ma gcig. They found her sitting in the tree, naked and free from all  worldly misery. Descending from the branches, she prostrated before the lama,  saying: "Those who prostrate sincerely before their master will be purified of all  obstacles caused by their past deeds!" The other participants in the initiation then  accused her of having interrupted the consecration, but the master said that,  whereas they had all only received the initiation of the word (tshig dbang), Ma  gcig had been the only one to receive the initiation of the deep meaning (don  dbang).  

An examination of the allegorical elements in this brief episode enable us to  comprehend Ma gcig's unique place in the Tibetan tradition. The central theme  is that of her spiritual autonomy. Ma gcig is directly inspired by transcendent  reality: she withdraws alone from the temple, hovers magically in space, dances  the sacred dances, and teaches in the original language of the Tantras. These  extraordinary elements mark the authority the Tibetans have ascribed to her. Her  awakening is perfectly depicted in the image of the saint on top of the tree,  dominating the snake with the power of meditation. To Ma gcig are ascribed the  requisites for the founder of a new school. Furthermore, the religious ideal un derlying the doctrine of good - whose core practice is the meditation on offering  one's body - is actualized in the image of Ma gcig offering her body to the de 

mons, by which she exorcizes herself of all possibility of harm. Finally, the ini tiations directly conferred by the divine manifestations, Aryatara's auspicious  prophecy concerning the yogini's religious tradition, and the master's confirma tion of the authenticity of her spiritual inspiration, all assert the undisputed au 

thority the Tibetans ascribe to Ma gcig as the founder of a religious tradition.  The latter part of her saintly life is marked by her encounter with Thod pa  Bhadra (Sanskrit Kapalabhadra), an Indian yogin from Kosala. After having re ceived certain auspicious omens, Ma gcig married him and they had several chil dren. Some biographies relate that Ma gcig was harshly criticized for renouncing  her monastic vows and was given the name 'bka log ma ("the renegade"). The 

410 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

couple visited various pilgrimage sites in Tibet over a long period, but after twelve  years Ma gcig decided to give up family life to return to her Buddhist masters  and resume a lifestyle entirely devoted to spiritual practice. In Ding ri she met  Pha Dam pa again, who gave her further teachings on the Perfection of Wisdom  and yoga. Then the yogini resumed her pilgrimage, and following her master's  instructions, she practiced in 108 cemeteries and holy places. She then went to  Zangs ri khang dmar, where she went into retreat until her death, at the age of  ninety-five.  

In the last years of her life, Ma gcig taught numerous disciples, especially her  own children, who played a prominent part in the continuation of the good  tradition in Tibet. The lineages of transmission reported in the various historical  treatises are somewhat complex, and the names vary according to the different  authors. They are subdivided, along the same classificatory lines as the Tantras,  into a male-paternal or method (upaya) lineage and a female-maternal or wisdom  (prajna) lineage. These genealogical trees of the tradition include a variety of  individuals. All of them, however, mention the Indian yogins Aryadeva and Pha  Dam pa at the beginning of the lineage, prior to Ma gcig. There is another trans mission lineage, called "esoteric" in some hagiographies and "direct" or "very  direct" in others, in which the transmission of the good doctrines passes unme 

diated from the goddess Tara to Ma gcig. This transmission lineage suggests the  desire, already visible in her various biographies, to recognize Ma gcig as the  originator of an autonomous religious system. In fact, the idea is fairly widespread  that it was only with Ma gcig that this tradition began to be defined as good.  

Also noteworthy is an episode that occurred in the final years of Ma gcig's life,  and is recounted in most of her hagiographies and in several texts on the history  of the good tradition. One day when Ma gcig was already in retreat in Zangs ri,  three learned Indian scholars from Varanasi came to visit her. The pandits had  heard about the yogini's teaching and had reservations about a Buddhist tradition  that did not come from India. So they asked Ma gcig whether they could challenge  her in philosophical debate, as was customary at the time among exponents of  the different Buddhist schools. Ma gcig did not hesitate, and started to debate  with the scholars in Sanskrit, astonishing them with her wisdom and great doc trinal learning. The pandits were thus forced to concede the yogini's supremacy  and to acknowledge her as the manifestation of the Great Mother, Prajnaparamita,  in person. From that moment the good teaching spread throughout Tibet and,  crossing the Himalayan frontiers, spread rapidly in India as well. According to  tradition, this was the first Buddhist teaching originating in Tibet to be promul gated in the Indian subcontinent. We cannot ascertain how much truth lies in  this belief, which is handed down to this day among Tibetan lamas; however, it  betokens the importance ascribed in Tibet to the good tradition and its foremost  promulgator.

The Great Collection of the Teachings on the Noble Practice of  Severing the Demons, Perfection of Wisdom  

Praise to that unconditioned state  

which transcends objective considerations,  

the pure, inexpressible,  

unimaginable condition  

that goes beyond any thought.  

I have written down  

this Collection of the Teachings  

on severing the demons  

thinking that someone, someday  

may benefit from it. 

THE GOO D TRADITIO N 413  

The root of all demons is one's own mind.  

If one feels attraction and desire  

in the perception of any phenomenon,  

one is captured by the demons.  

When the mind grasps at phenomena  

as if they were external objects  

one becomes contaminated.  

The demons are divided into four categories:  

the tangible demons  

(whose basis is external objects)  

the intangible demons  

(whose basis is mental images)  

the demons of complacency  

(whose basis is the desire for obtainment) and  

the demons of pride  

(whose basis is dualistic discrimination).  

The tangible demons are numerous:  

when phenomena appear  

before the sense organs,  

if one discriminates between  

what one desires and what one rejects  

the tangible demons arise.  

In this way, perceiving phenomena as concrete,  

one is chained to the wheel of existence.  

As form is empty in its nature,  

do not feel attachment to it  

but meditate on the emptiness.  

If one feels no attachment to form,  

one is liberated from the demon of eternalism.  

If one does not conceptualize emptiness  

one is liberated from the demon of nihilism.  

The manifestation of visible phenomena  

can not be impeded,  

but if they are not considered as concrete  

one's vision manifests as light.  

In this way one is liberated from sight, sounds,  

tastes, odors, touch, and the mind.  

The mind itself is the intangible demon.  

On the other hand, if it arises through the door of the five senses,  it is defined the tangible demon.  

Phenomena that appear to the sense organs  

are instantaneously interrupted  

in the state of spontaneous liberation414 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

and are transformed in the great  

essential dimension of reality.  

The way in which the intangible demon manifests:  

In that discriminating thought of good and evil  

which arises in one's own mind when phenomena appear  

is defined the intangible demon.  

If one separates oneself from the natural  

and spontaneous state of the mind  

and clings to the idea of benevolent gods and evil spirits,  

because of the oscillation between hope and fear  

one's own demon manifests in oneself.  

From the clear and immense space  

of the essential dimension of reality,  

thought and memories arise in all directions  

just as ripples and waves arise  

on the immutable ocean.  

Whoever has this understanding  

has no need of contrivances  

and naturally remains in his own condition.  

One liberates oneself in the space in which  

neither benefit nor harm is born.  

As wisdom arises spontaneously  

from the space of essential reality,  

it is not necessary to nurture jealousy,  

aversion, or affection.  

If one feels no aversion or affection  

the spontaneous mind becomes manifest.  

The way in which the demons of complacency arise:  

The ordinary demons and the superior ones  

arise from illusory mind.  

If, practicing in horrifying places,  

one is not disturbed by the evil spirits  

self-satisfaction is born in oneself:  

this is the demon of complacency.  

When the signs of spiritual power appear - 

merits and material wealth - 

the demons of distraction arise.  

Glory, fame, happiness,  

friends, and enemies  

are the demons of complacency.  

When gods and spirits confer their magical power,  

and one is surrounded by sons and faithful friends 

T HE GOO D TRADITIO N 415  

getting pleasure and satisfaction,  

the demons of complacency arise.  

Whichever virtue one achieves  

with mind empty of dualism  

between subject and object,  

do not grasp at it  

as if it were concrete.  

Act naturally without any attachment  

to the nature of virtues,  

considering them as the objects of dreams.  

Like a beautiful woman  

with ornaments who makes herself  

even more beautiful,  

anything that arises  

is as an ornament  

of one's own condition.  

There is no reason for vanity  

but if it arises one is contaminated  

by the various categories of illusion.  

May this noble conduct  

of remaining in one's own natural state  

without attachment to phenomena  

be kept in secret in the very heart  

of those who know!  

Because all things are the spontaneous mind,  

he who meditates has nothing to meditate.  

Let any perception which manifests spontaneously  

be left in its natural condition  

of union, clarity, and splendor.  

Because the meaning is immutable  

it is unified,  

because one gets real understanding  

it is clear,  

because one is liberated in one's own condition  

it is resplendent.  

Thus just as butter freely remains in butter,  

this contemplation without meditation  

is the supreme meditation.  

If one abandons oneself  

and seeks externally,  

even if one practices for ten million eons,  

he will have no obtainment. 

416 GIACOMELL A OROFIN O  

Seek nothing, undertake nothing,  

remain freely in the nature of essential reality.  

Not having any hope is the supreme practice  

of cutting off the demons.  

Without the limitation of human hopes and fears,  

if one cuts the rope of attachment,  

where is the Buddha, in reality?  

Although they are divided into four categories,  

all demons are included in the demons of pride.  

Just as the lion on the high snowy peaks has no fear,  

if one eliminates ego-clinging,  

confidence will develop  

and one will not fluctuate  

between the gods and the evil spirit of existence.  

Even if hundreds of them rise up  

the doctrines will shine upon them.  

If they can be recognized as one's own projection  

one will proceed with great dexterity.  

Eliminating the flow of thoughts  

and not undertaking any meditation,  

it is sufficient to obtain a profound insight of inner wisdom  that bursts out strong and spontaneous  

like an epidemic.  

This practice of severing the demons  

which arises from the profound insight  

that there is no root  

is the supreme teaching of all!  

Emaho\ Marvelous!  

Eliminating one's own pride and ego-clinging  

one pacifies the demons!  

Having a profound insight that there is no root  

one obtains the real state of complete awakening!  

So be at ease in a free condition  

and let everything be, in its own natural state.
