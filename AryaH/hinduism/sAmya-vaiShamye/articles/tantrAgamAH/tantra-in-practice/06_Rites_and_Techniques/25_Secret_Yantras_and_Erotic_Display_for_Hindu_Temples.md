Michael D. Rabe  

The Silpa Prakasa is the only surviving text on Hindu architecture that was written  from an explictly Tantric perspective. Its author, Ramacandra, was an architect  who belonged to a community of Kaula brahmans residing in the Mahanadi delta  of Orissa. Composed during the reign of an obscure local raja, the text's date can  be approximated by the fact that its prescriptions are best exemplifed by one  particular temple. That is the Varahi temple at Chaurasi, located midway between  the great temple towns of Bhuvaneshvar and Puri, and assigned on stylistic  grounds to the early eleventh century.  

Chief among distinguishing features shared by text and its closest physical  exemplar is the prominence given to erotic sculpture. Of course, images of mi thuna (couples) had long been components of the north Indian architectural  idiom. Their auspicious presence on doorframes was called for by the sixth-cen tury Brhat Sarhhita of Varahamihira, for example, but they were seen centuries  earlier even on Buddhist monuments before the Christian era. What distinguishes  their tenth- and eleventh-century permutatations is graphic excess. Not only on  the Varahi temple at Chaurasi (which enshrines a striking image of a sow-faced  goddess, the Sakti or personified energy of Visnu's boar avatar, Varaha), but on  numerous others throughout Orissa and most famously at Khajuraho in the neigh boring state of Madhya Pradesh, the depiction of couples embracing so intensified  that one may say emphasis shifted from nouns to verbs - from depictions of  mithuna to maithuna - to the acts engaged in by couples.  

Again, it is the Silpa Prakasa alone among surviving architectural treatises that  offers, from an avowedly Tantric perspective, a rationale for this profusion of  erotic art on medieval Indian temples. As divulged in the final two verses of the  second passage translated below, erotic sculpture panels (kama-bandha) should  be used as "divertissements" - to titillate the general public while hiding from the  uninitiated any glimpse of secret diagrams inscribed beneath them, called yantras.  However, the employment of sexual imagery should not be construed as endorse ment of hedonistic indulgence. In fact, the Tantric understanding of sex begins 

SECRET YANTRAS AND EROTIC DISPLAY 43 5  

with full acceptance of the orthodox Hindu presumption that kama - broadly,  the pursuit of pleasure - is one of four legitimate aims in life. Tantrikas agree  with the righteous majority, moreover, that liberation (moksa) from the vicious  cycle of rebirth (samsara) is life's ultimate objective - the other two being duty  (dharma) and prosperity (artha). Where they diverge, more in practice than affir 

mation, from followers of righteousness, is in their bold assertion that a left-hand  path can also be efficacious. Harnessing the kama impulse itself, albeit under the  most rigorous if not pleasure-subverting ritual conditions, can also be empow ering and effective in the pursuit of moksa - not to speak of many lesser attain ments along the way, including a wide variety of magical powers (siddhis) like  levitation, astral projection, enticement, and worse.  

The deployment of yantras as visual "instruments" with which to demarcate  sacred spaces, and to invoke within tightly constructed grids the inhabiting pres ence of deities, is a commonality shared by nearly all Tantric practitioners, both  Hindu and Buddhist private meditators and communal ceremony officiants alike.  As such, the Silpa Prakasa is consistent in that site- or icon-specific yantras are  enjoined to underlie virtually every structural component or image type belonging  to both the temple's front worship-hall (mukhasala, the subject of Prakasa 1,  excerpted below) and the sancturary building proper (vimana; see Prakasa 2,  excerpted below). The two passages translated here constitute the major examples  from each of the text's two chapters.  

First, the Yogini yantra may be considered a Tantric substitute for the almost  ubiquitous Vastupurusa mandala of other Sanskrit treatises on architecture (Fig ure 25.1). This presumption gains credence from the fact that the Silpa Prakasa  does not even mention the latter, much better known, example of an underlying  geometrial grid upon which to build. Mythic acounts of the Vastupurusa mandala  vary considerably, but according to the Matysa Purana (chapter 226), a demon of  global proportions grew from a drop of the great god Siva's sweat. Ravenously,  he proceeded to devour everything until all the gods united and managed to press  him face down upon the earth, and to bind him in an eightfold mesh of parallel  cords (asta-bandha). There they were obliged to hunker down indefinitely - 

whence he became known as the Vastupurusa, the "person" upon whom they  "reside." By extension, or alternatively, Vastupurusa personifies the building site  itself, in essence a local guardian spirit (like the genius loci of ancient Rome) who  must be appeased to insure successful construction (of vastus or habitations)  upon it.  

As a geometric schema, there are two main variants on the way the god's asta bandha is conveived as the Vastupurusa mandala. In both cases the grid is square;  the difference arises from whether the intersecting sets of eight parallel lines pro duce sixty-four or eighty-one subdivisions: either there are eight squares on each  side or eight lines between sets of nine (Figure 25.1). Either way, care is taken to  insure that there are thirty-two domiciles for as many gods around the perimeter  (through a diagonal subdivision of the corner squares in the case of the sixty four-square grid). With a larger brahma-sthana residence at the center for a pre-

siding supreme being, one may discern a lingering influence of early references  to a Vedic pantheon of thirty-three gods. In actual practice, however, many ad ditional deities are assigned to other interior subsections of the Vastupurusa man dala, and still others are posted to vital points of its exterior perimeter. These and  many other finer points are eloquently expounded by Stella Kramrisch in early  chapters of The Hindu Temple.  

One additional aspect of the Vastupurusa mandala as actually deployed at con struction sites is reported by S. K. Ramachandra Rao. Although subdued, the site personifying Vastupurusa is neither dead nor entirely immobilized. Throughout  the year his froglike tucked position is conceived as rotating; his head is in the  east in September and moves in a clockwise direction (pradaksina) progressively  toward due south by December, and so on. The demon is also thought to be  dormant most of the time; however, intermittent ninety-minute periods of wake fulness are considered propitious occasions for the commencement of new con struction.  

Much less is known about the analogous Tantric deployment of the Yogini  yantra. The Silpa Prakasa passage concentrates on details of its construction and  investiture with goddesses. But given the parallels of occasion and audience with  the Vastupurusa mandala, its underlying rationale and function in practice can  be imagined. Like its better-known correlate, the Yogini yantra is drawn out on  a site or sanctuary floor and then covered over before construction upon it begins.

Figure 25.2. A Yogini yantra  

In neither case do the grid lines actually serve to demarcate architectural forms;  rather, they serve to position pantheons of empowering and protective deities,  with the obvious difference that the Tantric sets are predominantly female. By  "audience" I allude to the essential presence of a temple's patron - typically a  king - who like the yajamana (chief sacrificer) of Vedic sacrifices is homologized  in his essence with the building (or sacrificial victim) so that attendant benefits  may accrue to him.  

One fundamental reason why female deities should predominate in Tantric  yantras is that worshipers of Sakti, namely Sakta Hindus, consider the energizing  goddess to be dominant over her otherwise quiescent male counterpart. The best known visual expression of this conviction is the iconic Kali standing on the  corpselike body of Siva. The motif plays upon assonance shared between the male 

438 MICHAE L D . RAB E  

god's name and the Sanskrit word for corpse, sava. Tantric deities of both genders  frequently come in multiples of eight - or nine, considering that eight subordi nates frequently form a protective circle around a supreme central deity. Thus,  in one sense at least, the sixteen goddesses (called matrikas, "little Mothers")  consigned to the periphery of the Yogini yantra constitute a simple reduplication:  a protective circle of sixteen guardians is superior to one with only eight. Even  better, by this logic, is the total of sixty-four, reached when an additional four  yoginis are assigned to each vital point of the encirclement. However simplistic  this explanation may appear, it is not trivial in actual practice, given the fact that  a large number of Sixty-Four Yogini temples were constructed throughout central  India and beyond between the ninth and twelfth centuries. These are accompa 

nied by a truly bewildering number of textual variants on the goddesses' actual  names and attributes, with virtually no two lists or sculpture sets identical (see  the numerous examples compiled in Vidya Dehejia's book on the subject). But  again, such quantitative minutia are not unique to Tantric contexts, as evidenced  by the sixty-four- and eighty-one-square variants of the Vastupurusa mandala.  

Yet another current of thought joins these primarily architectural traditions.  Especially with respect to the sixteen component triangles of the Kamakala yantra  as detailed in the second passage translated here, the two works by David Gordon  White mentioned below bear a close reading. They demonstrate that since Vedic  times, sixteen has been considered the number of the moon's waxing and waning  digits, and that in the full moon's plenitude - equated with soma, the divine  ambrosia - there is hoped-for immortality.  

In purely formal terms, the distinguishing feature of Tantric yantras, including  the two examples presented here, is their incorporation of triangles. Sometimes,  as in the famous Sri Yantra, overlapping and reverse-directed equilateral triangles  are conceived as gendered pairs. The resultant stars thus constitute two-dimen 

sional equivalents of the cylindrical stone lihgas (phallic images of Siva) set into  discoid yoni-pithas (denoting the Goddess's vulva) in the sancta of Siva temples.  However, in both yantras presented here, where large numbers of triangles come  into play, they all signify yonis. An overt statement to this effect is verse 531 of  Prakasa 2, wherein the presiding goddess of the second yantra, Maha-Kamaka lesvari, is described as making a gesture called yoni-mudra. A rare survival of this  mudra, in an erotic sculpture tableau of the sort recommended for diverting  attention from the underlying Kamakala yantra, occurs on the Laksmana Temple  at Khajuraho (Figure 25.3).  

Both passages translated here include allusions to the physiological centrality  of sexual fluids in Tantric schemata wherein semen, ideally fortified by female  secretions (rajas) produces a nectar of immortality (amrta) that the adept aspires  to redirect through successive cakras of the spinal column upward to the cranial  vault. As such, the sexual activity referred to as rajah-pana (literally, "drinking  female discharge") in Prakasa 2.534 may be urethral suction (yajroli mudra). With  respect to the cakras, this same verse describes the divine love making as taking  place in the ajna cakra, topmost among the six psychospiritual nodes arrayed

along the spinal column in Tantric yoga, commonly visualized as a two-petaled  lotus at the level of the eyebrows (or Siva's third eye). Even without further delving  into this subject of great complexity and extremely varied traditions among prac tioners, it may be seen that homologies are presupposed between the physical  space and forms of temple architecture, the divine order of the universe, and a  mapping of the individual worshiper's subtle body - or more simply, between  the macro- and micro-cosms: as it is in heaven, so may it be on earth.  

The Silpa Prakasa has been published only once, with a full translation, text in  Devanagari script, and lengthy introduction by Alice Boner and Sadasiva Rath  Sarma: Silpa Prakasa: Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture (Leiden:  E. J. Brill, 1966). The volume was illustrated with photographs of the Varahi  temple at Caurasi, among others, plus reproductions from the one illustrated  palm-leaf manuscript of the text, with an eighteenth-century colophon. The pub lished text is based on three such manuscripts, all of a similar age and written in  the Oriya script.

Further Reading  

The search for texts of this nature was prompted by a more speculative earlier  publication by Alice Boner, Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture, Cave Tem ple Period (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), wherein she posited the existence of com positional diagrams for a number of well-known rock-cut sculptures at Mamal lapuram and Ellora, dating from the seventh and eighth centuries. Subsequently  she published two additional studies of manuscripts purported to preserve ar chitectural traditions of Orissa: New Light on the Sun Temple of Konarka; Four  Unpublished Manuscripts Relating to Construction History and Ritual of This Temple,  translated into English and annotated by Alice Boner and Sadasiva Rath Sarma,  with Rajendra Prasad Das (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1972);  and the Vastusutra Upanisad : The Essence of Form in Sacred Art: Sanskrit text,  English translation, and notes by Alice Boner, Sadasiva Rath Sarma, and Bettina  Baumer (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982).  

Two books are recommended for further reading on the use of mandalas in  temple construction: the magisterial Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, 2 vols.  (1946, reprint: Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1976), and S. K. Ramachandra Rao,  Mandalas in Temple Worship (Bangalore: Kalpatharu Research Academy, 1988).  For a well-illustrated introduction to a variety of Goddess temples belonging to  the same period and region as the Silpa Prakasa, see Vidya Dehejia, Yogini Cult  and Temples: A Tantric Tradition (New Delhi: National Musuem, 1986). The lead ing authority on Orissan temples is Thomas E. Donaldson, Hindu Temple Art of  Orissa, 3 vols. (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1985, 1986, 1987); see also his article, "Pro 

pitious-Apotropaic Eroticism in the Art of Orissa," Artibus Asiae 35 (1975): 75- 100, and my on-line publication: Michael Rabe, "Sexual Imagery on the 'Phan tasmogorical Castles' at Khajuraho," International Journal of Tantric Studies 2.2  (http://www.asiatica.org/publications/ijts). Finally, as mentioned with respect to  the underlying Tantric ideology, the reader is advised to consult David Gordon  White, The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India (Chicago: Univer sity of Chicago Press, 1996), chapter 2, "The Universe by Numbers"; and White,  "Transformations in the Art of Love: Kamakala Practices in Hindu Tantric and  Kaula Traditions," History of Religions 38.2 (November 1998): 172-98.  

Silpa Prakasa 1.90b- 106  

90b. Hear now about the supreme Yogini Yantra upon which Sakta temples  [for goddesses] are to be grounded.  

THE YOGINI YANTRA  

91. According to Tantric texts, the installation of yoginis is paramount. On the  ground align three bindus (points) at an equal distance from each other [along 

SECRE T YANTRA S AND EROTI C DISPLA Y 441  

a north/south axis, plus two outer points at an equivalent distance, as well.  The three interior points are equated, respectively, with the metaphysical qual ities (gunas) of sattva, rajas, and tamas, that is spirit, energy, and darkness].  

92. [Two equilateral] triangles [pointing south] should be made to meet at the  upper [sattva] bindu. (Let the sattva bindu mark the apex of the upper triangle  whose base aligns with the north perimeter point, and the base of the second  triangle whose apex extends a double distance to the tamas bindu). The top  triangle denotes sattva and the lower one (with twice the elevation, and cen 

tered on the rajas bindu) may be considered the rajas triangle.  

93.-94. [Likewise,] the central axis connecting the three points is called the  rajas line. From its southern [tamas] bindu, a tamas triangle should be drawn  (of equal size to the sattva triangle above), facing the opposite direction and  with its apex meeting the central rajas triangle at the tamas bindu. [A variant  recension of this passages adds the following gloss as verses 92b and 93a:  "Triangular fields pointing upward are considered fire triangles, whereas those  facing downward are thought to be water triangles."] Next, a transversal line  should be drawn through the midpoint of the sattva [-guna] triangle.  

95. And likewise a line should be drawn across the tamas triangle at midele vation. Then two more equilateral triangles can be formed by diagonal lines  between these transversals that intersect at the rajas bindu.  

96. Thus this supreme yantra is composed of five triangles, [three facing]  downward and [two facing] upward. Finally, two more triangles are drawn to  converge at the rajas bindu from the sides.  

97. Down the middle axis it is the the yogini rekha (line) that activates the  entire yantra by penetrating all the bindus and triangles like a rod.  

98. This is the auspicious Yogini yantra, enjoined for Tantric establishments  (pithas). Wherever temples are thus undergirded by yoginis, the acquisition of  siddhis (supernatural powers) is a certainty.  

99. Sixteen mother goddesses reside on [a corresponding number of] the yog inl-bindus (peripheral points of the yantra, including both ends of the center  "rod"; four yoginis are also to be assigned to each bindu, in sequential order).  

100. This yantra has great power when established within a temple's inner  sanctum (garbha-grha); the yantra should be made coterminus with dimen sions of the Goddess-sanctum (devi-pitha).  

101. The skilled practicioner should make sure that the yantra's coordinates  are aligned in all directions with the sanctum floor.  

102. By means of measuring cord and other instruments a priest should lay  out the yantra, affixing it [and its attendent deities] with aloe wood and ver million (kunkum) mixed with red sandal paste. 

442 MICHAE L D . RAB E  

103. Then the yantra-nyasa puja (the worship associated with the establish ment of the yantra) should be performed with the king present, worshiping  the yoginis invoked at each of the yantra's [peripheral] bindu-points.  

104. By depositing various jewels and other elements, including cakra dia grams engraved on metal discs, each bindu-point should be assiduously wor shiped.  

105. After completion of these oblations the sanctum floor should raised [to  seal them in place]. This royal yantra ceremony assures victory, the destruction  of all obstacles.  

106. Thus the king's aspirations for victory are fulfilled and all siddhis are  granted. Purification of the sanctum and the entire temple grounds is also  achieved without a doubt.  

Silpa Prakasa 2.498 - 539  

THE TRUTH ABOUT EROTIC ART (KAMAKALA TATTVA)  

498. In this context [of the ornamentation of exterior temple walls], hear the  rationale for erotic sculpture panels (.kdma-bandhas). I will explain them ac cording to the received tradition among sculptors (silpa-vidya).  

499. Kama is the root of the world's existence. All that is born originates from  kama. It is by kama also that primordial matter and all beings eventually dis solve away.  

500. Without [the passionate engagement of] Siva and Sakti, creation would  be nothing but a figment. Nothing from birth to death occurs without the  activation of kama (kama-kriya).  

501. Siva is manifest as the great linga, Sakti's essential form is the yoni. By  their interaction, the entire world comes into being; this is called the activity  of kama.  

502. Canonical erotic art (kamakala vidya) is an extensive subject in author itative scriptures (Agamas). As they say, "a place devoid of erotic imagery is a  place to be shunned."  

503. By Tantric authority (kaulacara) such places are considered inferior, and  to be avoided always, as if tantamount to the lair of Death, or impenetrable  darkness.  

504. Without [first] performing puja to the Kamakala Yantra, any worship of  the Goddess (Sakti-puja) or Tantric practice (sadhana) is as futile as an ele phant's bath.

Figure 25.4. A Kamakala yantra  

505. Where this yantra is consecrated, that building may be considered a Tan trie temple (vira-mandira). There all obstacles and fears, and so on, are sure to  be destroyed.  

506. From the mere sight of this yantra all manner of ghosts, demons, and  other hideous creatures are sure to flee far away.  

507. Listen, and I will carefully expound its secrets. [But remember,] this yan tra must never be divulged to anyone who is not a Tantric practitioner.  

THE KAMAKALA YANTRA  

508. The ground for this Tantric figure (vira-bhumi) must be four-sided, either  square or rectangular. Across the total area of this four-square field two lines  should be made.  

509. One vertical and the other horizontal, these lines should intersect at the  "jewel house" [center point]. Starting from the jewel-point, diagonals should  be drawn to the corners, thus dividing the entire figure into triangular yonis.  

510. Vertically extending from the lower baseline to the yantra's center, a nar-444 MICHAE L D. RABE  

row linga should be formed, with a jewel-like rounded top extending above  the center point.  

511. Above this jewel-top the kama-bindu's very essence is marked by a bul bous drop, the bindu that bestows all supernatural powers.  

512. After this, the sixteen matrikas are consigned to [a like number of] tri angle yonis, making sure that each is in captivating contact with the linga.  

513. These sixteen facets (kalas) are all formally conceived as being yonis,  only by virtue of linear conjunction with the lihga, thus becoming [a complete  set of sixteen] facets.  

514. How, then, is the segmented field apportioned so as to constitute the  fifteen [that is, sixteen] principal orifices that are conjoined with the linga?  

515. By what means are those three-sided figures considered to represent yo nis, the totality of which constitute this yantra?  

516. In the upper half, two oblique lines should connect the top central bindu  to the ends of the horizontal center line; similarly, draw lines from the lower  center up to [but not beyond] the corner diagonals.  

517. [The upper side triangles are then subdivided horizontally:] Kamesi is  the first Sakti [assigned to the upper side triangle on the proper right]; Bha gamalika is second [below her]; Nityaklinna is third [to the proper left top  triangle]; and fourth is Bherunda [below her].  

518. [Below] on the proper left set of three fields MahavajreSvan is assigned  the bottom triangle, Sivadutika is beside her [to the linga's proper right].  

519. Beside her, in the [other proper] left corner field, is the citsakti [named]  Vahnivasini, joined with captivating lines.  

520. To her left, and conjoined to the jewel-tip (mani-ksetra) portion of the  lihga is placed the goddess Vajresvari.  

521. Above, on the proper right [and horizontally extended from the linga] is  Tvarita, the steadfast essence of the Sakti facets (kalatmika), and opposite [her,  on the] left, Kulasundari.  

522. In this order are the beautiful fields occupied on the sides. In the great  yantra of the vulva-altar (bhaga-pitha) only six more remain to be enumerated.  

523. Against the lihga's right side is Sakti Kllapataka, opposite her the lovely  limbed Jvalamalini.  

524. Vijaya, the constant Companion [goes across the top left], Kamakalesvari  extends below her to the linga's jewel-tip.  

525. On her side to the proper right, the divine Tripurasundari is placed, [and 

SECRET YANTRAS AND EROTIC DISPLAY 44 5  

above her], opposite Vijaya, [goes Bhairavi], the constant love of Bhairava,  beloved of the powerless.  

526. These are the sixteen Saktis, goddesses who are the very essence of Love  (kdmakalatmika), together constituting the yantra's field; around its outer pe riphery a protective ring of [eight] yoginis [is invoked].  

527. Nirbhara at the upper centerpoint, Rahasyaka in the upper left corner,  Kulotkirna at the middle left, Atirahasya in the lower corner.  

528. At the lower center place Sampradaya; in the next corner Guptatarahgika;  Guptayogini at the proper right center; and Nigarbha at top right.  

529. These are the yoginis of the peripheral field, as distinguished from the  [interior, sixteen-] faceted Love Field. [Finally], the Supreme Sakti, the great  goddess of Love's Facets [or of the Art of Love], Parasakti Maha-Kamakalesvari  [is visualized at] the central drop.  

MEDITATION ON MAHA-KAMAKALESVARI  

530-31. Wearing colorful garments, gracious, [yet] aroused like an elephant  in rut, ever sex-crazed, radiant in a circle of light, with a snare of lotus-flowers,  and making the auspicious yoni-mudra [in right and left hands respectively],  she holds a bow on her [upper] left hand and and in her upper left a spray of  kimsuka (Butea frondosa) buds.  

532. [In a third pair of hands] the Goddess holds a rudraksa rosary while  confering boons and fearlessness (with the varada and abhaya mudras), though  afflicted herself by Kama's five sharp arrows.  

MEDITATION ON KAMAKALA'S LORD, SIVA  

533-34. Just below her, from the jewel-tip [of the yantra's linga] appears Siva,  Kamakala's Lord, his complexion somewhat dark, profoundly still in a seated  yogic pose, almighty, [yet] constantly absorbed in lovemaking to Kamakales vari, mounted in the ajna cakra, always delighting to partake of her sexual  fluids (rajah-pana-ratah).  

535. Wearing the ascetic's garb, [he is] the yogin Kamakalesvara, presiding  lord of the great Kamakala Yantra, the dark Sankara.  

536. This most secret yantra is the ultimate means of protecting any place. It  is a perceptible power aid, and manifestly the [ultimate] bestower of all siddhis.  

537. In all the best Sakta and Saiva temples this yantra must certainly be de ployed; then their fame will remain unmoved, like mountains.  

538. [But] this most secret of secret yantras must not be be seen by just anyone. 

446 MICHAE L D . RAB E  

This is the reason that images of erotic play [should hide] the yantra's align ments.  

539. The considered opinion among tantrikas is that erotic images should  adorn upper panels on pilasters of the exterior temple wall. There erotic sculp ture panels should be mounted in order to delight the general public.
