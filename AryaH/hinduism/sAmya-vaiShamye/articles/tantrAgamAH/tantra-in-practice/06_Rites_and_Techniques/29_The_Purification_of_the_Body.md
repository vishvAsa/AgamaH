title = "29 The Purification of the Body"

Gavin Flood  

The Tantric tradition's most elaborated source for the purification of the body  and its ritual identification with the cosmos is the Jayakhya Samhita, one of the  three most important revealed texts of the Pancaratra, the tradition of Tantric  Vaisnavism, probably composed between the seventh and tenth centuries c.E.  The Pancaratra Samhitas are regarded by the tradition as revelation and are di 

rectly parallel to the Saiva Tantras or Agamas, though these were not recognized  by the Pancaratrins. The status of the Sarhhitas within Vaisnavism as a whole is  ambiguous, though an early Sri Vaisnava teacher, Yamuna, defended their status  as revelation.  

The chapter translated here, which takes the form of the Lord addressing teach ings to the sage Narada, concerns the purification of the body, or more specifically  the purification of the elements (bhutasuddhi) within the body, as part of the  description of a sequence of ritual acts. These rites are part of the practitioner's  daily ritual activity (nitya karma) in order ultimately to attain liberation (brah masamapatti). The purification of the body is integral to Tantric ritual and prepares  the practitioner to worship the deity; as the famous Tantric adage goes, "only a  god can worship a god." The distinctively Tantric nature of the bhutasuddhi in  the Pancaratra can be seen by its absence from worship in the related, orthoprax  Vaikhanasa tradition, and its occurrence in the Jayakhya may be the earliest in  Sanskrit literature. The general ritual sequence of Tantric worship is as follows:  first, the purification of the body or bhutasuddhi "destroys" the gross or physical  body in the imagination; second, a divine body is created through visualization  and nyasa or the imposition of mantras upon the body; third, there is internal or  mental worship of the deity (manasayaga); and finally, external worship (bahya 

yaga) concludes with making offerings into the fire-pit (kunda).  The bhutasuddhi itself involves a complex process of visualization in which  the practitioner or sadhaka identifies his body with the universe, particularly the  five elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space, and visualizes phenomena as sociated with each of the elements. As in other Tantric systems, the Pancaratra 

510 GAVI N FLOO D  

hierarchical cosmology is recapitulated in the body. The Jayakhya divides the  cosmos into the pure creation (suddhasarga) and the material creation (pradhan ikasarga). Within the pure creation the Lord, referred to as Vasudeva, Narayana,  and Visnu, manifests his six qualities of knowledge (jnana), majesty (aisvarya),  power (sakti), strength (bala), energy (virya), and splendor (tejas) in his emana tions (vyuhas). These emanations, Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Ani ruddha (the latter three being referred to in the Jayakhya by the names Acyuta,  Satya, and Purusa), in turn produce further manifestations, the powers (vibhavas)  and incarnations (avataras), all of which are "contained" within the body (these  various manifestations are referred to in verses 97-98).  

Apart from the particular Pancaratra cosmology, the text also contains reference  (at verse 82) to the six paths (adhvans). This is a well-known cosmological scheme  from the Saiva traditions and is divided into the three ways of sound (vacaka)  (comprising varna, mantra, and pada) and the three ways of objects or referents  (vacya) (comprising kala, tattva, and bhuvana), also known as the ways of time  {kaladhvan) and space (desadhvan). These "paths" are mapped onto the body in  the ritual systems of Saivism and are simply assumed in the Jayakhya, though the  text remains true to Pancaratra cosmology. The Pancaratra absolute is located at  the crown of the head (called the dvadasanta) above the aperture of the absolute  (brahmarandhra). Space, air, fire, water, and earth are identified with the body  from the head to the soles of the feet. During the rite described in our text, the  sadhaka visualizes various segments of his body being pervaded by one of the  elements: the earth from knees to feet, water from thighs to knees, fire from navel  to anus, air from throat to navel, and space from the brahmarandhra to the ears.  This pattern is the same for the Saiva Siddhanta, and texts such as the Somasam bhupaddhati, a standard ritual manual, give roughly the same correspondences.  In the Jayakhya, each element is visualized before the sadhaka, breathed into the  body where it pervades its appropriate place, absorbed into its mantra, then into  its subtle cause, and breathed out. Thus the element of air is visualized as a yellow  square, which is then breathed in with the filling breath (puraka) until it pervades  the area from the knees to the feet. While the breath is retained (the kumbaka  breath), it is absorbed into its mantra, then into its subtle cause, smell, and  breathed out (the recaka breath). The same process occurs with each of the ele ments, water being absorbed into taste, fire into form, air into touch, and space  into sound.  

Fundamental to this system, and indeed to all Tantric ritual systems, is the  cosmology of Samkhya and the hierarchy of the categories (tattvas) in which the  subtle elements (tanmatras) of sound and so on (here referred to as powers  [saktis]), give rise to the gross elements. On a cosmic scale, the gross elements  are a manifestation of the subtle, so in ritual intended to return the sadhaka to  the source of the cosmos, the process of manifestation is symbolically reversed.  This process is accomplished through the repetition of sacred formulas or man tras, each element having its own mantra. Having absorbed each element into its  mantra, into its subtle cause and emitted it through the breath, the sadhaka should 

PURIFICATIO N OF THE BODY 511  

lead his soul, located in his heart-center, up the subtle channel that runs through  the center of the body, out through the aperture of the absolute - a mental act  symbolic of liberation. There his soul is identified with the mantra of Visnu, and  the text (verse 62), echoing the Vedantic notion, describes this state as being  beyond the sun, moon, and stars. He then imagines his body being burned from  the feet upward, until it resembles a pile of ashes, which are swept away to the  four directions by a flood of water arising from his meditation. Through this  process, the gross, physical body is symbolically destroyed in order that a divine  body can be created. Verse 72 describes this as the six coverings (sadkostka) being  burned like grass. These "coverings" or "sheaths" - energy (sakti), magical illusion  (maya), "setting in motion" (prasuti), matter (prakrti), the cosmic egg (brahmanda),  and "the body of the soul" (jivadeha) - surround both the purity of the soul and  vast levels or regions of the hierarchical cosmos. These regions are described in  chapter 6 of the Laksmi Tantra and correspond to the six sheaths of the Upanisads  (the annamayakosa and so on). As in the Upanisads (e.g. Chdndogya Upanisad  8.1.3), the universe is here contained within the body. The sadhaka's divine body  is made of light from the energy of mantra and contains the Pancaratra hierarchy  of deities, which are emanations of Narayana. This construction of the mantra  body or body of light is identified with the subtle body, called the "city of eight"  (puryastaka) (verse 94) because it comprises the five subtle elements along with  the intellect (huddhi), ego (ahamkara), and the mind (manas) of Samkhya cos mology. As the subtle elements give rise to the gross elements, so the gross or  physical body can be seen as an emanation of the subtle.  

With the destruction of the physical body, the sadhaka then draws his soul,  referred to in the text (verse 95) as an "image" (bimba), back down through the  central channel (susumna) to the heart within the "new" body. He is then ready  to perform the next stage of the rite described in the following chapter - the inner  worship (antarayaga) or mental worship (manasayaga), in which offerings are  made to Narayana in the imagination. Although the Pancaratra is a theistic tra 

dition in which the Lord is the transcendent creator of the cosmos and the inner  controller (antaryamin) located in the heart of all beings, the present text presents  a picture of the self as being both identical with him and distinct. Although the  text does not use the term, this is a typical "difference-in-identity" (bheddbheda)  kind of theology that resists any absolute distinction between the self and the  Lord. Indeed, the self and Lord are identified in verse 70, though elsewhere there  is a clear distinction: the Lord, for example, has the six qualities (listed above) in  contrast to the devotee, whose body is bereft of these qualities (verse 15). Yet in  spite of the ritual identification of self and Lord, many passages retain a sense of  the Lord's distinction. Echoing the Bhagavad Gita (18.65), where Krsna tells Ar 

juna that "you are dear to me" (priyo 'si me), Bhagavan in this chapter of the  Jayakhya (100b-101a) tells Narada the same. Indeed, our source refers to a "mys tical" text that is probably the Gita.  

Mantras are one of the key concerns of the Jayakhya, and the chapter on the  purification of the body contains some details of their formation. The text assumes 

512 GAVI N FLOO D  

the general Tantric understanding and classification of mantras as comprising the  seed (bija) and the body (pinda) of the mantra, and that mantras correspond to  different levels of the Pancaratra cosmos. The "complete" (niskala) or "root" man tra (mula) mantra is given to the sadhaka by the guru, here the famous six syllabled Vaisnava mantra, Om visnave namah. Each of the elements purified in  the rite has its own mantra, comprising the seeds and the name of the element  in the dative case, and the text describes their formation (17b-19), with different  syllables named as deities. Thus the syllable sa is called Sahkara, sa is called Agni,  

and so on, and these are combined to form the bijas of the mantra.  Accompanying the repetition of mantras is the practice of visualization. The  verbs used in the Jayakhya for this process of ritual meditation or visualization  are from the roots smr (to remember, recall), dhyai (to meditate), bhu (to exist, to  come into being), and cint (to think), generally used in the third person optative  case. I have generally rendered these terms as "visualize" because of the visual or  imaginative practice referred to, though unlike the English word they do not have  the implication of unreality in the ritual context. I have left the terms mantra,  "sound formula," and mandala, "ritual diagram" or "circle," untranslated, along  with proper names.  

This translation of chapter 10 of the Jayakhya Samhita is taken from the printed  edition of the text, although I have referred to two manuscript transcripts. For  verse 95b I have followed the manuscript transcript R2195 and read svamantra  rather than svatantra. The edition used is Embar Krishnamacharya, ed., Jaya 

khyasamhita, Gaekwad's Oriental Series no. 54 (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1931).  The two manuscript transcripts are numbers R2195 and 2182 in the transcript  library of the Centre d'Indologie, Pondicherry. I should like to acknowledge dis cussions that have greatly helped my understanding of the text, with the Saiva siddhanta Tattvajna, R. Subramanian, and Dr. T. Ganesan, both at the Centre  d'Indologie, Pondicherry, and Dr. David Smith of Lancaster University.

The Realization of Concentration  

The Lord spoke:  

1-2. O Narada, placing a blade of panic grass, a flower, a leaf, or sesamum in  the tuft of hair on his head, [reciting] the weapon mantra with holy water, and  holding a pot filled with water, [the practitioner] should go to a lonely, unfre quented, but charming and clean place.  

3. He should meditate upon the mantra situated in the middle of his heart,  whose body is the fire of awakening, and not gazing into the distance, he should  silently restrain the breath.  

4-5a. When he reaches that place, he should emit his own mantra through  the nose; then having fixed the weapon mantra outside of himself, he should  strike the earth with his foot. He should meditate with mantra upon the com plete (sakala) Visnu seated upon Garuda.  

5b-6a. Sitting in a special place, he should assume an agreeable posture on  sacred grass, on a hide, or on a cloth over a wooden plank for the purpose of  worship.  

6b-7. O Brahman, praising the Lord with a devout mind and receiving a men tal command from the lineage of teachers, with his head bowed to them, he  should perform all action mentally, as has been established.  

8. After consecrating the seat with holy water muttered over with the root  mantra, [the practitioner] should offer the mantra again for its purification,  snapping his fingers.  

9. Hear this, O Narada. He should then perform the purification of the hands,  on both palms, on the backs of the hands and on all the fingers.  

10. Purifying them with the weapon mantra, he should practice mantra repe tition and meditation. Then, after purifying his hands, he should purify the  place.  

11-12. Meditating on the god whose form is flames, whose splendor is like a  thousand suns, covered with millions of flames, vomiting flames from his  mouth, [the practitioner] should fill the entire universe up to the World of  Brahma with that [visualization].  

13. He should flood the directions, making them blaze with the splendor of 

514 GAVI N FLOO D  

his mantra, and meditate upon the entire circle of the earth baked, like a clay  pot, by the fire of his mantra, O Best of the Twice-Born.  

14. This purification of the place of worship occurs due to the outpouring of  the waves of nectar. Now hear, O Sage, about the purification of the elements  [in the body] in exact order.  

15. Know that the body, like Indra's net, comprises the five elements of earth,  water, fire, air, and space, but is bereft of the six qualities of knowledge and  so on.  

16-17a. It is impure, without autonomy, arising from blood and semen, de caying. For as long as it is not purified correctly and continuously with con centration, it will be unfit for things such as mantra, imposition (nyasa), and  so on.  

17b-19. [The practitioner] should join the five letters "Sankara" [sa], "Agni"  [sa], "Soma" [sa], "Surya" [ha], and "Antaka" [ksa] in sequence together with  "Dharesa" [la], "Varaha" [va], "Anala" [ra], "Kambu" lya], and "Pradhana"  [ma]. He should then use all these along with the primal deity possessing  lordship of the three worlds, at the crown [the anusvara, that is, the nasalized  phoneme m], O Twice-Born.  

20. In sequence these are the seed syllables of earth, water, fire, air, and space.  The syllables hum and phat should be placed at the end of the names of the  earth and so on, O Narada.  

21. [The practitioner] should utter [the mantras] three times for the purifi cation of the elements, each preceded by the syllable Om. They are established  in sequence according to the superiority of the five Lords of the elements [that  is, Om slam prthivyai hum phat; Om svam adbhyah hum phat; Om sram tejase  hum phat; Om hyam vayave hum phat; Om ksmam akasaya hum phat].  

22. The five [deities] Aniruddha, and so on, and Satya [are the Lords of the  elements and] have been previously referred to. [The practitioner] should utter  [their mantras] in sequence, accompanied by their powers.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE EARTH ELEMENT  

23. Expelling the Lord through the right nostril, he is placed in the middle of  a circular mandala that has the appearance of a thousand suns and resembles  the color of molten gold.  

24. Then [the practitioner] should meditate upon his mantra-self seated in the  highest place, twelve fingers above [at the crown of the head].  

25. Below that circle of light, the lords of the cosmic principles (tattvas) are 

PURIFICATIO N OF THE BODY 515  

added, and below them he should meditate upon the complete mantra-body  in due sequence.  

26-27a. [The practitioner] should then visualize a quadrangular, yellow earth,  marked with the sign of thunder, connected with the five sounds and so on  [that is, sound, touch, form, taste, and smell], filled with trees and mountains,  and adorned with oceans, islands, good rivers, and walled towns.  

27b-29. With an inhaled breath, he should visualize [that earth] entering his  own body from outside, and uttering the mantra [Om slam prthivyai hum phat],  he should imagine it as tranquilized, pervading in due order from the knees to  the soles of the feet, by means of the retained breath. Then, O Twice-Born, [he  should visualize the earth] gradually dissolved in its mantra-form, and this  mantra-king dissolved in the energy of smell.  

30a. After that he should emit the energy of smell with the exhaled breath.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE WATER ELEMENT  

30b-31. Water is the power in the great substratum called water, comprising  oceans, rivers, streams, and the six essences of herbs, and whatever water crea tures there are, creatures in the other world.  

32-34a. It has the same form as a half moon and is adorned with the sign of  the lotus. After visualizing that aquatic power outside of himself, [the practi tioner] fills his body with it by means of the inhaled breath, very gently, from  the top of the thighs to the knees. O Twice-Born, he should meditate on his  body as its own, complete mandala, pervaded by the inhaled breath.  

34b-35. After meditating on that water mantra [Om svam adbhyah hum phat]  called the substratum in the center of that [mandala/body], the entire aquatic  power dissolves in that [mantra]. Then that [mantra dissolves] in the energy  of taste, [which in turn dissolves] in the mandala of fire.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE FIRE ELEMENT  

36-37a. With the exhaling breath, he should emit the effulgent power whose  form is a triangular world, adorned with brilliance, containing lightning, the  moon, the field of stars, gems, jewels, and minerals.  

37b-39. It contains beings with self-luminous bodies and sky-goers without  bodies, and svastikas and lights are established [within it]. Tiger of sages, once  he has penetrated that great power he should then visualize the effulgent subtle  element established within the mandala. As before, uttering [the mantra Om  sram tejase hum phat] he should visualize [the fire element] entering him by  that same method.516 GAVI N FLOO D  

40. Holding it [in the mind] and making it pervade from the navel to the anus,  he should meditate upon that total, effulgent power, O Brahman.  

41. That [element] is pacified in the body of the mantra, and the mantra, whose  nature is fire, dissolves in the energy of form, which is made of consciousness.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE WIND ELEMENT  

42. The mantra-body itself is dissolved by its own energy. Exhaling, [the prac titioner] emits the energy into the substratum of wind.  

43-44a. He should then visualize that airy power outside of himself, accom panied by effulgent forms like a red stone, filled with many different smells  and qualities.  

44b. He should visualize it in this way with its own mantra \Om hyam vayave  hum phat] called the Dharana.  

45. Having thus meditated upon this essence and uttered the mantra, he  should destroy it, very softly through the nostril by the method previously  described.  

46-47. He should meditate upon [the wind element] pervading from throat  to navel. Then, by the method previously described, he visualizes the wind  power dissolved in its ruler, and, O Sage, that into the great energy called touch.  That energy is indestructible.  

THE PURIFICATION OF THE SPACE ELEMENT  

48. He should project into the mandala of space in the great substratum called  sound, this energy itself, endowed with power, eternal and invisible, [by which  he is] pervaded.  

49-51. Then, O Twice-Born, he should visualize that total power called space  outside this body. It is filled with various sounds, formless like collyrium, and  filled with innumerable perfected beings who are without bodies and made of  sound. He should meditate upon the support mantra called space [Om ksmam  akasaya hum phat] in the middle of that. Always supporting itself by its own  potency, the mantra of sound is formless and pervades the powers (vibhavas).  

52. Establishing [the visualization] accurately with the imagination, and hav ing infused [the power of space] into his body in the aforementioned way, [the  practitioner] should become pervaded by it.  

53. Space [pervades] from the ears to the orifice of the absolute. With that  power, fixed by the inhaled breath, the yogin [restrains] time.  

54. Afterwards, O Sage, he should meditate upon [space] transformed into its 

PURIFICATION OF THE BODY 517  

own mantra. The support mantra called space is then dissolved in the power  of sound.  

55. He should experience that indestructible energy going forth through the  orifice of the absolute, joining with the four energies of smell and so on.  

56. He should keep in mind the untainted, complete mantra [Om visnave na mah] that is beyond space, and beyond the energies of truth and so on.  

57. Know that sixfold, partless [mantra] previously mentioned. In stages, by  means of mantra, he should bring each elemental power to its home.  

THE STATE OF LIBERATION  

58. Individualized consciousness, like a quivering star, is next to be meditated  upon as at peace, departed from the cage of the elements [that is, the body].  

59-60. Through the gradual process [just described], within his body com prising the five energies [of the elements], and within the supreme mantra  devoid of extension, [the practitioner] sees his own self in the space of the  heart by means of the self, like a mountain resplendent as the sun. This [self]  is the Lord, supreme, pervading, and covered with vibrating light.  

61-62. Then, established in the body of the mantra, he should practice the  supreme concentration (samadhi). The supreme mantra body is manifested in  the succession of letters. By means of the energies, the bounds of the sky, the  sun, and so on are transcended, and having cognized that transcendence, [the  practitioner] is established in that condition.  

63. From worshiping the essence of mantra [the practitioner] becomes dissat isfied with worldly affairs and holding to the rope of knowledge, [he perceives]  the truth of the self in the six syllables [of the mantra Om visnave namah].  

64-65. He should visualize his own self, by his own self, arising from the cave  of the heart. That flame from the fire of mantra arises through the path of the  subtle channel from the brilliant [heart]. [That channel] is the susumna, re sembling the stalk of a lotus. Visualizing it going to the aperture of the absolute  [at the crown of the head, he knows] this to be a good path, O Narada.  

66. Having emitted his own self, very gently, by the wind of consciousness,  [the practitioner] should fix the particular sixfold mantra [Om visnave namah]  there.  

67. Lord, may he attain this [supreme state] that arises from the supreme body.  This is the unparalleled mass of splendor [previously] proclaimed, O tiger  among the twice-born.  

68a. [The self/Lord who] stands in the enter of the circle of light is delighted  by the joy of his own joy. 

518 GAVIN FLOOD  

68b-69. The truth of the self is established in the [various] states of being, O  Narada. His nature is consciousness, alone, freed from the body, the real. The  great joy that arises, that is the supreme power of Visnu (Saktivaisnavi).  

70-71a. Having made [himself] indistinguishable from him [the Lord], the  soul is the agent of undiminished action. Wherever she [Saktivaisnavi] arises,  there she yet remains. Know that, Narada, to be the ineffable, the freedom from  ideation.  

BURNING THE BODY  

71b-72. So, sitting down in his own place, having abandoned the elemental  body, established there he should burn the body with the exception of the  subtle elements of power. Then, the six worthless coverings of the self have  the form of burned grass.  

73-74a. With the fire arising from the birth of the mantra and due to his  intention, [the practitioner] should fix the support of the entire universe,  which is endowed with the four refuges [energy, knowledge, strength, and  lordship], above the body in the space established above the Lords of the world.  

74b-75. Starting with the seed syllable [the pranava] and ending with the  name expressing the fire of desire itself, [the practitioner] should visualize the  body, blazing from the feet. After that, O Twice-Born, the fire is calmed and  [the body] resembles a pile of ashes.  

76-77. Meditating upon his reduction to ashes, [he should use the mantra]  tyam preceded by the syllable Om and ending with namah. Then he floods the  ashes to the directions with the water, sprinkled with his own mantra, arising  from his meditation and having the appearance of milk.  

THE CREATION OF A RADIANT BODY  

78-79a. He should meditate upon the universe, moving and unmoving, which  has the appearance of a milky ocean, with [the mantra] svam, with the lamp  [mantra] as the second [term], understood as before.  

79b-80a. The nectar of the twice-born, continuously meditated upon, is made  to fall as a mass of streams from its elevated position, flowing out from the  fourth state.  

80b-81a. Having placed the energy of Visnu there in the middle [of the  ocean], which is his support [that is, Visnu's throne] and is the seed of every thing, he should visualize a lotus arising from it.  

81b-82. [The practitioner] should visualize [himself as] Lord Narayana in the  middle of that [lotus], as the essence of mantra, the essence of the truth of the 

PURIFICATIO N OF THE BODY 519  

six paths, white, brilliant, beautiful, surrounded by a triadic mandala [with  three rings], and shining with vibrant rays.  

83. O Twice-Born, he should meditate upon the complete, solitary, pure body  of the five true mantras, bursting with the energies of the mantras.  

84. He should visualize the five elements of space and so on, the Lord's fivefold  mantra, and the power of space [and the other elements] flowing from that.  

85. He should visualize this body born from the union [of the elements], from  the cage of the powers, having the appearance of a thousand suns and a hun dred brilliant moons.  

86. In this way he has produced a body that is supreme in liberation and  enjoyment, having the appearance of pure crystal, bereft of old age and death.  

87-88a. O Tiger among Sages, having thus been [re]born by means of energy  from that waveless place, [the practitioner] has gradually achieved the innate  fulfillment of all living beings.  

88b-90a. He should then rest in his own joy, from the great joy that is yet his  own joy. His own form is from the solar, celestial circle. [This body] shines  like millions of suns, glimmers with its own radiance, its form is like the col ored balls of the kadamba tree and it is pure like the pollen of the blue nisambu  flower.  

90b-92. Having brought his self from its own place, by means of the self, O  Twice-Born, let [the practitioner] enter his own mantra-body through the ap erture of the absolute as before. [He thus goes] to the inner lotus of the subtle  body by the path of the moonlight-channel. Then meditating on his own  speech, which is the support of all the worlds, the complete word [the entire  mantra] creates total satisfaction.  

93-94. [The practitioner] should mark on himself the "deathless" mantra end ing with namah. This mantra to be known is the "savior," and it denotes the  self. Then the whole mantra is the lustrous body, and [the practitioner] has  attained a body of light [which comprises] the five [subtle elements] and the  ego [that is, the subtle body].  

95. He should sprinkle his body with the flood of nectar from his own mantra.  Then pulling down the image [of his soul through the susumna], he fixes his  own mantra in his heart.  

96. The circle of light that is one's own shining form [created] from one's own  bliss, is the supreme, waveless energy, comprising great bliss.  

97-98. The path of the central channel is the complete body of the mantra  (pindamantra). [The practitioner] should visualize the energies, the group of  mantras, the five Lords of Protection, and the assemblage of powers (vibhavas), 

5 2 0 GAVIN FLOOD  

as [within] the body. [He should visualize] that blazing totality as different yet  nondifferent [from himself].  

99. O Narada, this complete, elemental purity arises due to three kinds of  cause: gross, subtle, and supreme.  

100. You are a devotee, unwearied, of firm intellect, and your soul is devel oped. You are dear to me, as declared by the mystic [text].
