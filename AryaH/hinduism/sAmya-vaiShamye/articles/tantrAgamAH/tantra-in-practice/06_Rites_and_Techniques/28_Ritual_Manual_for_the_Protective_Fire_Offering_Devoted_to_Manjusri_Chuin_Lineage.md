Richard K. Payne  

Every Tantric tradition has its own version of the homa, a votive ritual in which  offerings are made into a fire. In one form or another the homa is found from  Mongolia to Bali, from south India to Japan. The homa is also a link to the Vedic  ritual tradition and the broader Indo-European religious culture that includes  Iranian, Greek, and Roman ritual traditions.  

The homa ritual presented here is from the Shingon tradition of Japanese Bud dhism, specifically the Chuin lineage, which predominates in contemporary Ja pan. The Shingon tradition was established in the ninth century by Kukai, who  is also known by his posthumously awarded title "Kobo Daishi" and is sometimes  simply referred to as "the Daishi" meaning "the Great Teacher." He traveled to  China (804 to 806) with the specific goal of initiation into the Buddhist Tantra,  and received authority for the dual lineage of the Mahavairocana and Tattvasam graha Sutras.  

The homa is one of the most important rituals that Kukai brought to Japan,  and it became the final of the four rituals practiced in the training of Shingon  priests. The East Asian Tantric Buddhist tradition knows five kinds of homas,  identified according to the purpose for which they are performed: protection  (santika), increase (paustika), subjugation (abhicaraka), subordination (vaslkar 

ana), and acquisition (ankuia). Each is conducive to awakening in a dual sense.  For example, the homa of subjugation both enables the practitioner to overcome  enemies, either human or demonic, and to overcome the mental and emotional  errors that obscure the naturally enlightened mind.  

The ritual translated here is for protection, the kind most commonly performed  in contemporary Japan. This homa takes as its chief deity Manjusri, the bodhi sattva of wisdom. Manjusri is one of the best known of the Mahayana bodhisatt vas, playing a central role in such popular sutras as the Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra.

In this homa five sets of offerings are made. The first is to Agni, the Vedic fire  god who is almost invariably the first deity evoked in the homas of the Shingon  tradition. This is followed by a set of offerings to the lord of the assembly, a figure  that, like the chief deity, can vary from homa to homa. In this case the lord of  the assembly is Hayagriva, a horse-headed manifestation of Avalokitesvara, the  bodhisattva of compassion. Hayagriva is also known to the Hindu tradition, where  he is identified with Visnu.  

The central set of offerings is to Manjusri, the chief deity of this ritual. This is  followed by sets of offerings to the bodhisattvas accompanying Manjusri, sur rounding him in the mandala, and to a set of Vedic deities and astral groupings.  

These five sets of offerings are structured very similarly to one another - a fact  that allows for the abridgment of the version of the ritual instructions given here.  The basic pattern or syntax of each of the five sets of offerings is: 1. preparation  of the altar-hearth, offerings, and practitioner; 2. visualization of the deity to be  evoked within the practitioner's own body and in the altar-hearth; 3. evocation  of the deity by inviting him to leave his original location in the cosmic mandala  (the totally of being as it actually is, that is, as experienced by an awakened one,  a buddha) and to become identical with the deity as visualized in the hearth;  4. making of offerings to the deity; and 5. departure and leave-taking, in which  the identification is dissolved and the deity returns to his original location. The  model for this ritual structure is the feasting of an honored guest, and is rooted  in the Indic origins of the homa. This systematic structure is also evidenced by  the fact that the offerings prescribed here are to be embedded in a longer ritual,  as indicated by the first line's reference to "the additional recitations," a particular  point in the ritual into which these offerings are to be embedded. Often, however,  the portion of the ritual preceeding the homa offerings is performed at some  earlier time, perhaps the day before.  

The efficacy of this ritual is understood to result from the three-way identifi cation between the practitioner, the deity evoked, and the hearth. This identifi cation is effected by the practitioner's visualization. Thus, the mouth of the hearth,  into which offerings are made, is visualized as identical with both the mouth of  the deity and the mouth of the practitioner. The physical offerings are identified  with the practitioner's own self-frustrating emotional habits and intellectual mis conceptions. Just as the fire burning on the hearth is understood as purifying the  offerings, making them appropriate for the deity's consumption, the fire is also  the fire of wisdom, purifying the emotional habits and intellectual misconceptions.  The fire is both the deity's awakened mind and that of the practitioner. Thus, one  is offering one's own emotional habits and intellectual misconceptions to oneself  for purification in the fire of one's own awakened mind.  

Like other ritual manuals, the present text assumes a great deal of knowledge  on the part of the practitioner. Hence, the instructions at times only identify a  well-known ritual action by name, such as "universal offering and three powers,"  which are a pair of brief recitations found together in nearly every Shingon ritual.  It is expected that the trained practitioner will have these memorized, though 

FIRE OFFERIN G T O MANJUSR I 491  

individual practitioners often add the information to their own manuals. This  assumption of prior knowledge makes for a "telegraphic" style in the ritual in structions, which I have preserved in my translation.  

As with many esoteric systems, Shingon employs a set of associations between  the body and mind of the practitioner and the alternate worldview that the tra dition teaches. Each finger of the hands forming the mudras is identified with  one of the five elements: little finger with earth, ring finger (known as "nameless")  with water, middle finger with fire, forefinger (known as "head") with wind, and  thumb (known as "great") with empty space. This five-element system originates  in India and is part of the Indian religious culture brought to China and Japan as  part of the Buddhist tradition. This system of five elements was given particular  importance in Shingon as a way for practitioners to experience themselves as  identical with the cosmos as an awakened totality. The five elements also appear  graphically as five cakras, though the term is used somewhat idiosyncratically  here, since cakra is usually understood as a wheel. In the five-elements system,  earth is a yellow square or cube, water a white circle or sphere, fire a red triangle  or pyramid, wind a black half-circle or hemisphere, and empty space a blue  raindrop. Other aspects of Indian religious culture found in this ritual include  the repeated request that the deities perfect the practitioner's supernatural powers  (siddhis), the use of phonemes (as written in the Siddham script) as part of vi 

sualizing the deity's presence, and the activation (called here "empowerment") of  various elements of the ritual through the recitation of mantras.  

Likewise, many of the implements employed in the ritual, such as the ladles,  originate in Indian religious culture. The vajra, however, is even older, repre senting as it does the thunderbolt - the weapon of the high god across the entire  Indo-European religious culture. In the esoteric Buddhist tradition it is explained  as representing the qualities of awakened consciousness: like a thunderbolt, it  suddenly illuminates the night of our confused and frustrating existence. It is also  stronger than anything else, breaking the rock of our entrenched habits. The  Shingon tradition makes use of three forms of the vajra: one-pointed, three pointed, and five-pointed. At the start of the ritual, these are arranged on a plate  (the "vajra plate") on the altar in front of the practitioner.  

Not only is the altar itself the hearth upon which the fire is built, but it is also  a mandala. As the ritual enclosure in which the deities are evoked, it is enclosed  by a rope of five strands, each strand the color of one of the five elements. In  front of the practitioner the rope is raised to form a "gateway." Ritually identical  with the deities, the practitioner is able to enter the mandala through the gateway  to make offerings and perform the other ritual actions.  

The homa rite was appropriated by other Japanese religious traditions. For  example, a homa using large logs and performed outdoors is found in the Shu gendo tradition of mountain ascetics. Similarly, at least one of the nativist Shinto  traditions initiated in the nineteenth century also incorporated a homa, despite a  rhetoric of purifying Shinto of Buddhist influences.  

In contemporary Japan, one can observe this Tantric rite or its variant forms 

4 9 2 RICHAR D K. PAYNE  

quite easily. In some temples it is performed every day, in others on a monthly  or annual basis. The performance of the homa throughout so much of Japan  indicates the deep influence of Tantric Buddhism on Japanese religious culture.  

The present translation of the homa to Manjusri is based on Soeda Takatoshi,  Monju Soku Sai Goma Shiki Shidai, Goma Zenshu, no. 35 (Osaka: Toho Shuppan,  1982).

Following the additional recitations, hang the rosary on the left wrist, through out the homa.  

First, empowerment of Mahavairocana: form the wisdom fist mudra, recite  the mantra Om vajradhatu vam.  

Next, empowerment of the lord of the assembly: form the Hayagriva mu dra - make the empty bowl mudra with both hands, the two head and two  nameless fingers bent into the palm, their backs joined together; the two great  fingers are aligned, but do not touch the two head together. Recite Om amrt odbhava hum phat.  

Next, empowerment of the chief deity, Manjusri: form the empty bowl mu dra - the two middle fingers touch the back of the two nameless fingers, the  two great fingers are aligned, and the two head fingers bent - then the blue  lotus mudra. The preceding mudra is turned up so that the two middle, two  nameless, and two little fingers are placed above the two great fingers, and the  two great fingers are shaped like a sword. Recite Om a ra pa ca na.  

Next, visualize the three identities using the dharmadhatu meditation mu dra. Contemplate the following: the heart of the Tathagata is identical with 

FIRE OFFERIN G T O MANJUSR I 493  

what actually exists, what actually exists is identical with the fire of wisdom;  the hearth is identical with the body of the Tathagata; the fire is identical with  the dharmakaya fire of wisdom; the mouth of the hearth is identical with the  mouth of the Tathagata; the fire is nothing other than the wisdom within the  practitioner's body. Thus, the mouth of the Tathagata's body, the mouth of the  body of the hearth, and the mouth of the practitioner's body are all three the  same.  

Next, empower the poppy seeds: take the censer and place it in the left corner  of the altar. Next, take the bowl of poppy seeds from the left table and place  it where the censer had been; empower using the single-pronged vajra, reciting  the mantra of the Fire Realm seven times [there is an oral instruction: recite  the single-syllable chant twenty-one times]; at the end scatter the poppy seed  to the four directions, to the four corners, above and below, with the right  hand. Beginning from the northeast corner, recite the chant of the Fire Realm  once for each of the directions, throwing a total of ten times. Then return the  bowl to its original location.

Next, untie the string around  the twenty-one pieces of sapwood, turn the base toward the practitioner, and  place it on the vajra plate. Throw the string into the hearth. Next, take the  pincers and insert the offering wood, piling it up in the hearth in sequence.  From the orientation of the practitioner, in sequence from left to right place  six sticks in line; eleven sticks total. Next, with the pincers, insert a piece of  pine into the flame of the lamp on the right and place it under the right corner  of the firewood.  

Next, take the fan and fan the flames: hold the fan partially open in the right  hand, recite the mantra, and fan three times; imagine a syllable ham on the  surface of the fan; it changes, becoming a wind cakra, recite Om bhuh jvala  hum, three times. Close it in the right hand and return to its original location.  

Next, purification: sprinkle the wood in the hearth three times, sprinkle  directly, recite the kili kili chant: Om kili kili vajra hum phat.  Next, empower the firewood on the hearth: using the three-pronged vajra,  empower by reciting the kili kili chant three times.
