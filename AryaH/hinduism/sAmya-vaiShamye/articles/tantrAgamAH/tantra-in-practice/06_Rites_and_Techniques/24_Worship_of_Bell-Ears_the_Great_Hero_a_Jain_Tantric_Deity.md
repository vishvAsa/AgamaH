title = "24 Worship of Bell-Ears the Great Hero, a Jain Tantric Deity"

John E. Cort  

Tantra in Jainism has two distinctive features: it is largely centered around the  use of verbal spells or mantra, and Jain Tantric practices are aimed at improving  one's condition within the realm of rebirth rather than liberating one from rebirth.  Although Jain Tantric rites, such as that given in the second text below, also  involve the use of diagrams known as yantras, these play a subsidiary role com 

pared to the mantras, and most yantras have the ritual mantra written on them.  Mantras are used directly to effect desired results, and to call on nonliberated  deities to effect those results. Jain Tantric rites rarely involve any elaborate form  of meditation or visualization; usually the simple repetition of the mantra suffices.  Some Tantric rituals invoke the central cultic figures of the tradition, the twenty 

four Jinas or tlrthahkaras, the enlightened and liberated souls who showed the  path to liberation. More often, though, the rituals invoke other figures, such as  the wonder-working monk Gautama in the Svetambara ("White-Robed") tradi tion, various goddesses in both the Svetambara and Digambara ("Sky-Clad") tra ditions, and male figures such as Ghantakarna Mahavira and Nakoda Bhairava in  the Svetambara tradition.  

According to Jain theology, however, none of these beings has the power to  grant liberation. The Jinas are inactive icons of the liberated state; the other deities,  although active in the world, are themselves unliberated, and so cannot give what  they themselves have not attained. As a result, most Jain Tantric rituals are aimed  at accomplishing a variety of goals in this world, such as health, wealth, and  power. The texts translated below are a veritable catalogue of these worldly goals.  Many Jain Tantric texts and rituals categorize these goals within the framework  of the "six actions" (satkarmani) of pan-Indian Tantra. What is not found in Jain  Tantra is the development of a full-scale alternative Tantric path to liberation such  as is found in some Hindu and Buddhist Tantric schools.  

The cult of Ghantakarna Mahavira, "Bell-Ears the Great Hero," exemplifies these 

418 JOH N E. CORT  

two distinctive features of Jain Tantra. (This Mahavira should not be confused  with Vardhamana Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and final tirthahkara of this era).  The worship of Bell-Ears is found exclusively among Svetambara Murtipiljaka  Jains, and in particular is special to one mendicant lineage, the Tapa Gaccha. He  is one of the fifty-two viras or "heroes," a class of powerful male deities who  protect faithful Jains and defeat enemies of the Jain community. Bell-Ears is de 

scribed as a fellow Jain, and so is dangerous only to the opponents of Jainism.  The traditional Sanskrit texts of the cult are the seventy-one-verse Ghantdkarna  Mantra Stotra, (a hymn that is also considered to be a mantra), and several Ghan takarna Mantras. The hymn was composed sometime in the latter half of the  sixteenth century by an otherwise unknown monk named Vimalacandra, who  was a disciple of Sakalacandra, who in turn was a disciple of the great leader of  the Tapa Gaccha, Hiravijayasuri (1527-1595).  

These mantras were used in a variety of Tantric rituals performed over long  periods of time, by which the practitioner gained the allegiance of Bell-Ears and  so was able to gain the worldly powers associated with this deity. The nature of  these worldly powers, which ranged from cures for diseases and increasing one's  material wealth to defeating and even slaying foes of the Jain community, show  clearly that Jainism is as much about how to live successfully in the world as it  is about ascetic practices to liberate oneself from the world. The inclusion of  marana or killing foes in the list of Jain Tantric goals - although many Jain Tantric  texts exclude it - also shows that the Jain ethical injunction of ahimsa or non harm does not result in Jains being strict pacifists, as ahimsa is more applicable  in the sphere of dietary practices than in the sphere of relations among states and  religious communities.  

For many centuries, the worship of Bell-Ears was a largely private aspect of  Jain practice, performed within certain monastic lineages, and possibly by some  laymen as well. Vimalacandra (verse 67) claims that this worship dates to the  time of the great Haribhadrasuri (c. sixth to eighth century), although there is no  other evidence to corroborate this. The nature of the transmission of the cult from  teacher to disciple is seen in the third text below, which describes the initiation  of Buddhisagarsuri (1874-1925) into the cult in the late nineteenth century. For  several decades, Buddhisagarsuri's practice was firmly within this largely esoteric  tradition. The texts translated here also indicate ways in which this Jain esoteric  tradition shared many practices and concepts with the pan-Indian yogic and Tan tric streams of religious expression, while giving them a distinctly Jain flavor.  

Buddhisagarasuri effected an important change in the cult after his direct ex perience of Bell-Ears, when he established an anthropomorphic image of the deity  in a small shrine attached to the Jain temple at Mahudi in northern Gujarat. This  is the first known three-dimensional anthropomorphic image of Bell-Ears; pre viously he had been worshiped only in the forms of abstract and anthropomorphic  yantras. Toward the end of his life, Buddhisagarsuri was responsible for convert ing the cult into a highly public one. In part, Buddhisagarsuri's goal was to create 

WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 419  

a way for Jains to perform rituals aimed at worldly goals and still be good Jains.  According to Jain theology, the Jinas cannot respond in anyway to ritual petitions,  and so it is considered inappropriate and fruitless to worship the Jinas for worldly  ends. Worship of non-Jain deities is fraught with danger, especially as such wor 

ship in the early twentieth century frequently involved sacrificing animals. Bud dhisagarsuri arranged for the construction of a much larger temple at Mahudi,  and wrote several hymns and rituals for the worship of Bell-Ears, including the  one translated as the fourth text below. In line with the transformation of the cult  from an esoteric one followed by initiated adepts into a public one followed by  hundreds of thousands of Jains, we also see in this text a reformulation of the  worship of Bell-Ears along more devotional (bhakti) lines than traditional Tantric  ones. Such interaction between Tantra and devotion has long been a feature of  all South Asian religious traditions.  

The shrine of Bell-Ears at Mahudi is now one of the most popular Jain shrines  in all India. It is visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year, who  come to offer Bell-Ears his favorite food, a sweet dish known as sukhadi, in return  for his assistance in their lives. In particular, tens of thousands of people come  for the special worship of Bell-Ears on the day before Divali, the autumnal festival  of lights that also marks the New Year according to the western Indian calendar.  The worship of Bell-Ears is therefore an important aspect of insuring that any  possible malevolent influences from the previous year are negated, so that one  can start the new year with an auspiciously clean slate. Images of Bell-Ears are  also found in a growing number of Jain temples throughout western India.  

The Sanskrit Ghantakarna Mantra Stotra is found in Acarya Buddhisagarsuri,  Mangal Puja (Sanand: Sri Sanand Sagargacch Jnan Khata, 1953; originally pub lished ca. 1922), pp. 33-71; Acarya Buddhisagarsuri, Sri Ghantakarn MahavirDev  (Mahudi: Sri Mahudi Jain Svetambar Karkhana Trust, 1983-1984; originally pub lished 1924), pp. 69-74; Sarabhai Navab and Muni Candrodayvijay, eds., Ghan

The anthropomorphic yantra of Ghantakarna Mahavira (Figure 24.1) is  illustration 10 in Navab and Candrodayvijay. The Gujarati narration by Muni  Candrodayvijay of Buddhisagarsuri's initiation is from Navab and Candrodayvijay,  pp. 33-36. The Gujarati Worship of Ghantakarn is from Buddhisagarsuri, Mangal  Puja, pp. 18-26; and Buddhisagarsuri, Sri Ghantakarn Mahdvir, pp. 56-62.I have  used different spelling systems to indicate the differing pronunciations in Sanskrit  and Gujarati, especially where the latter does not pronounce the final short -a of  most words.

2. Ghantakarn Kalp  

[Sanskrit invocation:] I bow to Ganesa, the giver of wealth and success, and  beloved son of the mountain-born Parvati. Now I tell the kalpa of Bell-Ears,  which removes enemies and troubles.  

The best times for auspicious actions are an auspicious month, the bright  fortnight, and the fifth, tenth, and full moon in that fortnight. The auspicious  days and conjunctions are Sunday in the Hasta lunar mansion, Sunday in the  Mula lunar mansion, and Sunday in the Pusya lunar mansion. The best days  for killing (marana) and causing to flee (uccatana) are the eighth, fourteenth,  and new moon in the dark fortnight. The best conjunctions are Siddhi, Amr 

tasiddhi, Ananda, Srivaccha, and Chatra. Before commencing, you should con sider the auspicious omens and the power of the lunar position in the horo scope for the performance of the mantsa.  

The performance should be in a pure building, the walls of which have been424 JOHN E. CORT  

attractively washed and rubbed with cow dung, or in a pure forest, in a garden,  on the banks of a river, in a temple, or else in your residence. The mantra for  purifying the earth is: "Om hrim srim I bow to the earth deity." Recite this  mantra seven times while offering incense, lamp, and whole rice.  

The mantra for bathing is: "Om hrim klim I bow to Ganges water." Recite  this mantra seven times while bathing. The mantra for donning clothing is:  "Om hrim klim I bow to the bliss deity." Recite this mantra while donning pure  clothing.  

For a pure rite, meditate using the Bell-Ears mantra:  

Om Bell-Ears Great Hero, destroyer of all ailments. Protect, protect those in  mighty fear of boils, Greatly Strong. Wherever you stand, O god, diseases and  gout are destroyed by the written lines of letters [of your yantra]. Instantly  from the recitation in the ear there is no fear of kings. Witches, ghosts, vam 

pires, and demons do not arise. There is no untimely death, nor are snakes  seen, nor is there fear of fire or thieves, hrim Bell-Ears. Homage to you thah  thah thah svaha.  

Recite this mantra 33,000 times over forty-two days. After that, recite it daily  108 times each at dawn, midday, and dusk. If you accompany the recitation  by offering black pepper and mustard seeds into a sacrificial fire, there will be  no fear of hostile deities. If you fear enemies, then offer a mixture of curds,  milk, ghee, saffron, and bdellium gum resin into the sacrificial fire, and estab 

lish an anthropomorphic yantra (Figure 24.1). This will destroy fear of ene mies.  

THE RITE OF THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC YANTRA  

On the stomach of a human figure make twelve sections, and in them write  the twelve-syllabled mantra Om hrim srim klim sarvadusta nasanebhyah [Om  hrim srim klim for the destruction of all malevolence]. On the throat of the  figure write sri namah [obeisance to wellbeing], on the right hand sarva hrim  noma [obeisance to all], on the left hand satrunasane namah [obeisance to the  destruction of foes], on the right foot ram rim rum namah, and on the left foot  hvam hvim hum namah. Write the Bell-Ears Mantra around the border of the  figure.  

Offer grain, lime paste, a coconut, and raisins into a sacrificial fire. Offer to  the yantra vermillion powder, and make a ring from cotton thread spun by a  young girl. You will be freed of fear of hostile deities, enemies, and kings, and  your fame will increase.  

Here is another ritual with this yantra. On the day of Divali, eat a single meal  of rice pudding, set up an unextinguished lamp of ghee, light ten-scented in cense, and recite the mantra 12,000 times. Lie on the ground as if dead. After  the recitations, make an offering into the sacrificial fire of the five nectars [milk,  curds, ghee, honey, sugar], and you will see the form of your success in a dream.

The text then gives instructions for rituals for specific goals, including obtain ing wealth, gaining control over others, killing, causing victims to flee, elimi nating ignorance, and preventing miscarriage. Two of these are given here as  examples.  

THE METHOD FOR OBTAINING WEALTH (LAKSMI)  

Recite the Bell-Ears mantra. Make a six-cornered yantra. In its six corners write  Om hlim hvim hum hlom namah. Write the Bell-Ears Mantra around the border.  Perform the following rite. To obtain wealth sit facing the west, wearing white 

426 JOHN E. CORT  

cloth, holding a white rosary, seated on a white cloth. With mind, speech, and  body in single-pointed attention, recite the mantra 125,000 times in seventy two days. While reciting eat once per day, and eat something made with wheat.  Offer into a sacrificial fire raisins, dried caroli fruit, almonds, and coconut.  Throughout offer incense, lamps, and food to the yantra. It is certain that after  six months you will obtain wealth. From maintaining the yantra you will obtain  all sorts of pleasure.  

THE METHOD FOR SUBJUGATING OTHERS (VASIKARANA)  

Recite the Bell-Ears mantra while seated facing north, wearing red cloth, hold ing a red rosary, and seated on a red cloth. Recite the mantra thrice daily (dawn,  midday, dusk) for a total of 225,000 times within forty-two days. Establish a  four-cornered yantra. Throughout this time offer incense, lamp, and food to  it. Offer into a sacrificial fire red sandalwood, pepper, and ghee. While making  the offerings, say the name of the deity whom you wish to subjugate. This can  be used either to imprison someone or free someone from prison. For this you  need to establish a yantra of 132 squares.  

Sanskrit colophon:  

1. Whoever reads this in a spirit of devotion, and hears the mantra-bells in his  ear, will have no obstacles and so be successful in the three worlds.  

2. I have made thousands of mistakes: forgive me for all of them, god, be  merciful, O Supreme Lord.  

3. For what I have not known in the invocation, for what I have not known  in the dismissal, and for what I have not known in the worship: forgive them,  O Supreme Lord.  

4. For whatever has been deficient in my instructions, actions, and mantras:  lor give me for all them, O god, be merciful, O Supreme Lord.  

3. Buddhisagar's Initiation and Direct Vision of Ghantakarn  

It was Thursday, the eleventh of the bright half of the month of Fagan, in the  year v.s. 1954 [late February 1898 C.E.]. On that day in Vijapur, Ravisagar  decided to give the siddhamantra [mantra of success] of Bell-Ears, which was  in his mendicant lineage, to the young yogin Buddhisagar, who was his grand 

disciple, and who was both most fortunate and firm in his practice. The practice  of constantly remembering this siddhamantra had come down in the lineage,  and by it those illustrious men had been saved from harassment by animals  and undesirable elements. But there had been no direct vision of the hero Bell 

Ears, the presiding deity of the mantra, for two or three generations in the 

WORSHI P O F BELL-EARS 427  

lineage. Ravisagar saw in the young Buddhisagar the power to generate a direct  vision.  

As preparation for the initiation into the mantra, Ravisagar had instructed  Buddhisagar to consume only mung beans, rice, and water for one day, and to  maintain complete silence until midnight of the second day. At midnight on  the second day, Buddhisagar sat before Ravisagar . Ravisagar twice repeated  into his ear the nineteen-syllable mantra that had been passed down in the  lineage: Om hrim aim klim ghantakarna namostu mama karyani sidhyantu [Om  hrim aim klim praise to Bell-Ears may my actions be successful]. Then Ravisagar  used his right hand to rub vasksep [sandalwood powder that has been charged  by reciting a mantra over it] on the middle of Buddhisagar's brahmarandra  [crown of the head, from which spiritual energy can flow forth], and by press ing his hand gave saktipat [establishment of yogic power]. An awareness awoke  in Buddhisagar's entire body, and his six cakras [centers of yogic energy]  opened. Then for three days Buddhisagar followed his teacher's instructions  and recited the mantra.  

On the first day of the recitation, Buddhisagar saw wheels of unlimited light,  star disks, and minute points in his ajna cakra [point between the eyebrows].  Then the points gradually opened up and became glowing lamps. The light of  the lamps came together in his forehead. In this light for a brief time he saw  the dim form of a black figure. On the second day, he became absorbed in an  indescribable bliss, and his ajna cakra glittered with a shining light. All six  cakras opened. All his kundalis [circles at the six cakras through which the  yogic power travels] were awake. His entire body experienced an unprece dented and stimulating sensation. On the third day, he had the same experi 

ence. In three days he recited the mantra 27,000 times. Mantra-consciousness  was awake throughout his body.  

After the three days, Ravisagar instructed Buddhisagar to incorporate this  supreme mantra in his life, and to give mantra initiation to those among his  followers who were suitable to recite it. Then he instructed Buddhisagar to sit  in one place and recite the mantra. Buddhisagar commenced the recitation,  reciting in his mind for eight hours every day. After nine months he had fin 

ished 1,800,000 recitations. When he had finished 800,000, mantra-conscious ness awoke in him. After 1,000,000, he gained the power over dreams, after  1,400,000 he gained the ability to tell the future, and after 1,800,000 he gained  the power to untangle problems and ward off misfortune.  

After he had finished the 1,800,000 recitations, Buddhisagar made a state ment of intention, in accordance with the science of mantra, to have a direct  vision of his chosen deity. He obtained Ravisagar 's consent, and decided to to  go to Mahudi and there have a sacrifice performed by five laymen who were  dispassionate, faithful, and who daily recited the Navkar mantra [mantra to  the Jain spiritual hierarchy]. He instructed the five laymen that until the sac rifice was completed they had to maintain complete celibacy, renounce all  anger and wrong actions, and every day recite at least five cycles of 108 reci-

4 2 8 JOHN E. CORT  

tations each of the Navkar mantra. For the sacrifice they had to wear white,  red, yellow, blue, and tan clothes. As an introduction to the sacrifice, Ravisagar  recited the Bell-Ears mantra.  

On the day before the sacrifice, the sacrificial ground was prepared by wor shiping it at 4:00 A.M. in front of four young girls. Each girl held in her hands  a coconut, some sukhadi, and eleven and one-quarter rupees. The Ghantakarna  Mantra Stotra [Text 1] was recited three times. As the laymen offered the  coconut water on the ground to the ringing of a bell, a peacock suddenly  crowed. The sky began to lighten. A cowherd passed with his herd. A man  came running with some fragrant flowers and offered them. All of these were  taken as auspicious signs.  

Before sunset, a three-tiered altar was constructed. It was painted white. In  the four cardinal directions Om was painted with sandalwood paste, and hrim  was painted in the four intermediate directions. Eleven and one-quarter rupees  in silver coins were placed on it, and vasksep sprinkled on them. Sweets were  placed on the coins, and this was all covered with a white cloth. Coconuts  were placed on the four corners of the cloth.  

The fire was lit at the auspicious time of 10:15 in the evening. Buddhisagar  sat facing it. The five laymen took up their positions. They made 18,000 of ferings. The first sacrifice was made with bdellium gum resin, the second with  ghee, the third with five nectars of milk, curds, ghee, honey, and sugar, and  the fourth with sticks of wood. At 11:05 Buddhisagar started reciting the man tra. At 2:00 A.M. there was an unprecedented light in his ajna cakra. In the ajna  cakra he saw a divine form with bow and arrow in hand, a smiling face, a  powerful body, wearing golden clothes, a diamond-studded crown, and a di amond necklace. Twice he heard the words, "attention, attention, blessing,  blessing." Buddhisagar folded his hands in thanks at the blessing, and per formed veneration. At the end he heard in his right ear the words, "The god is  present right before you." For a while the deity was visible. Thus it was that  Buddhisagar, the great ascetic, the great king of yogins, the greatly fortunate,  greatly knowledgeable, and most worshipful, received that direct vision which  is difficult to obtain.
