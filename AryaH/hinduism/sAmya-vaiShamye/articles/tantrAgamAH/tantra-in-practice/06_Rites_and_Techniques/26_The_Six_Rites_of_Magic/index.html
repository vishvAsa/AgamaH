References to magical practices are found throughout ancient Indian literature, especially the Atharva Veda. Rites of magic are a common topic in Tantric texts, where we often encounter them in a group called the “six rites.” This group represents a systematization of magical practices. Although elements of folk tra
ditions are certainly present, the dependence on brahmanical rituals is clearly evident.
The Mantramahodadhi (Great Ocean of Mantras), a Sanskrit text that prescribes the mantras of different deities and ritual practices connected with them, was composed by Mahidhara at Varanasi, in 1588. Mahidhara wrote the work with the intention of gathering all significant information on the topic in a single book. Because of the clarity of its presentation, the Mantramahodadhi - along with the Nauka (The Boat), the author’s commentary written to enable practitioners to cross the “Great Ocean of Mantras” - has enjoyed great popularity in all parts of India up to the present day. Throughout the work, Mahidhara enumerates various deities, the mantras of those deities, and the rites in which the mantras are em ployed and which may be performed, once the mantras have been mastered, for the attainment of specific objectives. Among the rites are those usually classified as “the six rites” (satkarmani).">

  <p>Gudrun Buhnemann</p>
<p>References to magical practices are found throughout ancient Indian literature,  especially the Atharva Veda. Rites of magic are a common topic in Tantric texts,  where we often encounter them in a group called the &ldquo;six rites.&rdquo; This group  represents a systematization of magical practices. Although elements of folk tra</p>
<p>ditions are certainly present, the dependence on brahmanical rituals is clearly  evident.</p>
<p>The Mantramahodadhi (Great Ocean of Mantras), a Sanskrit text that prescribes  the mantras of different deities and ritual practices connected with them, was  composed by Mahidhara at Varanasi, in 1588. Mahidhara wrote the work with  the intention of gathering all significant information on the topic in a single book.  Because of the clarity of its presentation, the Mantramahodadhi - along with the  Nauka (The Boat), the author&rsquo;s commentary written to enable practitioners to  cross the &ldquo;Great Ocean of Mantras&rdquo; - has enjoyed great popularity in all parts of  India up to the present day. Throughout the work, Mahidhara enumerates various  deities, the mantras of those deities, and the rites in which the mantras are em ployed and which may be performed, once the mantras have been mastered, for  the attainment of specific objectives. Among the rites are those usually classified  as &ldquo;the six rites&rdquo; (satkarmani).</p>
<p>Chapter 25, the final chapter of the text, comprises 132 verses. Verses 1-102  address broader issues connected with the six rites. Five of these fall under the  category of abhicara, sorcery or destructive magic, and one may be classified as  an auspicious beneficial rite of white magic. The chapter bears some similarity to  sections of the anonymous Prapancasara and Laksmanadesika&rsquo;s Sdradatilaka (es</p>
<p>pecially 23.121-45), both well-known Tantric compendiums of the tenth to elev enth centuries. The text is precise but highly condensed, and presupposes a thor ough knowledge of Indian ritual practice on the part of the practitioner. Although  the text does not give details about how to perform such rituals - such descrip tions being scattered throughout the work - it provides general information about  the times, materials, and so forth that were considered suitable for these rites.</p>
<p>448 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN</p>
<p>Even though the six rites are often mentioned in Tantric literature, the names  used for them vary. The six rites referred to in the Mantramahodadhi are appease ment (santi), subjugation (vasya, vasikarana), immobilization (stambha, stam bhana), enmity (dvesa, vidvesa), eradication (uccata, uccatana), and liquidation  (mar ana).</p>
<p>Appeasement is defined as the curing of diseases; it is an auspicious, benevolent  rite, whereas the other five rites are of a destructive nature. Subjugation entails  bringing a person under the practitioner&rsquo;s control, especially seducing a woman  against her will. Immobilization means stopping a person&rsquo;s activity. Enmity is  defined as creating dissension or dislike between two persons who are attached  to each other. Eradication means depriving a person of his place, usually with  reference to such activities as breaking an object or removing someone from a  location. Liquidation means taking life. Similar definitions appear earlier in Sar addtilaka 23.121-25. Magical rites performed for these and similar objectives are  also described in Indian Buddhist Tantric texts, such as the Guhyasamajatantra,  as well as in some texts contained in collections of sadhanas (texts describing  methods of spiritual realization) like that published under the title Sadhanamala.</p>
<p>After defining the rites, Mahidhara states that the practitioner should know  nineteen items before performing a rite. These items are listed in verses 4 and 5  and then explained one by one in verses 6 to 65ab of the chapter. They are: the  deity, the deity&rsquo;s color, the season, the direction, the day, the posture/seat, the  arrangement, the symbolic shape, the gesture, the letters, the rise of the element,  the fire sticks, the rosary, the fire, the material for writing, the fire pit, the small  wooden sacrificial ladle, the large ladle, and the stylus.</p>
<p>The Nineteen Items</p>
<p>To each rite a presiding goddess with a specific body color is assigned (verses 6- 7ab; Table 26.1). Flowers of the respective colors are offered before undertaking  a rite. Here the color white is considered suitable for appeasement, whereas the</p>

</ol>
<p>SIX RITE S OF MAGI C 449</p>
<p>dark and gray colors are appropriate for destructive rites. In the three-color  scheme commonly found in Indian texts, white, red, and dark (black) are con nected with the three qualities of the Samkhya system of philosophy, namely,  goodness/purity, passion, and inertness/darkness, or with the cosmic functions of  creation, maintenance, and destruction.</p>
<p>The next section addresses suitable times of the day. The twenty-four hours of  the day are considered a replica of the entire year (verses 7cd-9ab; Table 26.2).  They are divided into the six seasons, with each, beginning at sunrise, lasting four  hours. Each season is favorable to one of the six rites. Each rite is further con</p>
<p>nected with the direction (verses 9cd-10ab; Table 26.2) the practitioner faces  during the performance. Omitting south and west, the two remaining cardinal  and the four intermediate directions are of significance. The topic of directions is  taken up again later (verses 60-6lab) in connection with the directions in which  the fire pits face. Except for two of the rites, appeasement and liquidation, they  agree with the above scheme.</p>
<p>Each rite should be performed on suitable days of the lunar month and the  week (verses 10cd-15ab; Table 26.3). The lunar month is divided into two fort nights: the bright half, when the moon waxes, and the dark half, when it wanes.  It is only to be expected that a rite such as liquidation should be mainly connected  with the dark half, whereas the auspicious rite of appeasement should be per formed during the bright half.</p>
<p>The practitioner is advised to maintain one of six postures in the rites while  seated on one of six animal hides (15cd-17ab; Table 26.4) We do not know how  far this classification was ever observed in practice, but we can perceive a con nection between the characteristics of the animals and the nature of the rites  performed. The hide of the sacred cow is suited for the auspicious appeasement  rite, whereas the hide of the powerful and large elephant suits the act of immo bilization.</p>
<p>Mahidhara goes on to describe six special methods or arrangements for con necting the mantra or sacred spell to be uttered in each rite with the letters of the  name of the person to be influenced (verses 17cd-23ab; Table 26.5). The sym</p>

<p>bolic shapes (mandalas) of each of the five elements are also assigned to the six  rites (verses 23cd-26ab; Table 26.6). Note that the fire shape is employed twice.  This assignment of the elements to the six rites appears again in the discussion  of the rise of the elements (verses 33cd-36), which is determined on the basis of  that part of the nose which the breath touches.</p>
<p>Next, six ritual hand gestures (mudras) are assigned to the six rites, and three  special gestures are described for the fire ritual (verses 26-29). The letters in scribed in the geometrical figures, or yantras, used in the rites are said to be the  letters governed by a particular element (verses 30-32ab). Details about which  letters are related to which elements are discussed in an earlier chapter (chapter  24, verses 80-81) of the text. There are also six closing words of mantras (verses  32cd-33ab), each connected with one of the six rites (Table 26.7). Svaha, vasat  and vausat have long been employed as exclamations when making offerings in</p>

<p>the fire in a ritual. Namah means &ldquo;salutation,&rdquo; and is used for offering respect to  a deity or person. Phat imitates the sound of bursting or breaking. These six  closing words also appear in nyasa rites, that is, the imposition of syllables, deity  names, and so forth, upon the practitioner&rsquo;s body. These rites are a part of the  worship ritual.</p>
<p>An interesting topic briefly touched upon in verses 33cd-36 is that of the rise  of elements, which is observed from the part of the nose where the breath touches.  It was observed that the breath does not pass equally through both nostrils at all  times, but touches certain parts of the nostrils over various intervals of time.  Certain rites or actions can be performed successfully when a certain element is  predominant (Table 26.8). This branch of knowledge is also known as &ldquo;rise of  breath&rdquo; (svarodaya) and is addressed in independent treatises. It is a method often  used for making predictions.</p>
<p>Rosaries are commonly used to count the number of repetitions of mantras.  Mahidhara gives some information about the material for the beads of rosaries,  their number, and the method of rotation (verses 40-44). Instructions regarding  the fire ritual (homa), which is an ancient Indian practice, follow. Fire sticks of  different woods, smeared with different substances, are offered in the fire ritual,  which constitutes a portion of the rites (verses 37-39). The offerings are made  into different fires, which are produced by rubbing sticks of different types of  wood together. The different flames of the fire are worshiped for each rite. They  are called &ldquo;tongues,&rdquo; because they consume the offerings. An almost identical list  of the names of the tongues appears earlier in Saradtilaka (5.23). To each of the  rites a fire pit of a particular shape is assigned, which faces a particular direction  (verses 60-61ab). The materials for the two ladles used in pouring libations into  the fire are specified in verses 61cd-62ab.</p>
<p>After the fire ritual, brahmans, who represent deities, are fed. This ritual feeding  of brahmans also figures in other rites. The number of brahmans fed varies with  the rite (verses 49cd-55ab). Their blessing is said to destroy the sin that accrues  from the performance of destructive magic.</p>
<p>Mahidhara describes different substances used as ink substitutes in drawing a  yantra as part of the rites, and suitable materials on which to draw the yantras</p>

</ol>
<p>SIX RITE S OF MAGI C 453</p>
<p>(verses 55ab-59). Depending on the nature of the rite to be performed, different  materials are used for the stylus, and certain days are recommended for making  that instrument (verses 62cd-65ab).</p>
<p>Following his discussion of the nineteen topics, Mahidhara addresses other  issues, such as the appropriate diet for the practitioner (verses 65cd-67), sub stances and vessels used for pouring libations (verses 68-70), and the body pos ture that is to be maintained (verse 71).</p>
<p>In his concluding discussion of these ritual procedures, Mahidhara declares  that he has described the desire-oriented rites only for the sake of persons who  are attracted to sense pleasures, based on instructions he has found in the works  of earlier preceptors (verses 72-76ab). Mahidhara extolls the superiority of the  worship of deities without any desire for personal gain, as well as of the attainment  of the highest knowledge, the realization of the unity of the individual self (atman)  with the universal principle (brahman; verses 76cd-81).</p>
<p>The text then continues with a discussion of a preliminary ritual, to be per formed for determining the success of the rite (verses 82-87). Not every mantra  is suitable for every individual. The practitioner prays to the god Siva to reveal  &ldquo;the truth&rdquo; in a dream. Auspicious and inauspicious dreams are listed in detail  (verses 88-97ab). Finally, the signs by which one recognizes that the practitioner  has attained mastery over the mantra are given. The practitioner is again advised  to strive for the highest knowledge and emancipation (verses 97-101).</p>
<p>A critical edition of the Mantramahodadhi is not yet available. The translation is  based on my new edition of chapter 25, published as appendix 2 of my study,  The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities. Vol. 1, The Pantheon of the Mantramaho dadhi (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2000), Gonda Indological Studies series, no. 9.  This volume also provides detailed information on the Mantramahodadhi and its  author. I have used the printed edition entitled Mantramahodadhih satikah (Bom bay:&lsquo;Srivenkatesvar Steam Press, 1910, 1962), as well as the manuscript repro duced in lithographic form in Mantramahodadhi, edited by Raghuvara Prasada  (Lucknow: Smarahimsakadatta Press, 1872), and the three following manuscripts:  Manuscript 1008 of 1891-1895, and 1138 of 1881-1892 (dated 1789), both  held in the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, India; and Manuscript  0793 (dated 1757), held in the library of the Centre of Advanced Study in San skrit, University of Poona, India.</p>
<p>In the following translation of Mantramahodadhi 25.1-102, the text is divided  into subsections, each with a separate heading. These headings are not part of  the Sanskrit text, but were introduced to help orient the reader and facilitate  understanding.</p>

<p>THE SIX RITES AND THEIR DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>I shall now explain the six rites, which grant success [if] the [correct] proce dure [is followed]. The following are called the rites: 1. appeasement, 2. sub jugation, 3. immobilization, 4. enmity, 5. eradication, and 6. liquidation. &ldquo;Ap peasement&rdquo; is the destruction of diseases, and so on.&ldquo;Subjugation&rdquo; is the state</p>
<p>of one who executes a command. &ldquo;Immobilization&rdquo; is obstructing an activity.  &ldquo;Enmity&rdquo; is the dislike between two affectionate people. &ldquo;Eradication&rdquo; is dep rivation from a place. &ldquo;Liquidation&rdquo; is the taking of life. These are the defini tions of the six rites. (Verses 1-3)</p>
<p>THE NINETEEN ITEMS A PRACTITIONER OF THE RITES  SHOULD KNOW</p>
<p>One should practice the six rites after knowing the following [nineteen items]  precisely: i. the deity, ii. the deity&rsquo;s color, iii. the season, iv. the direction, v.  the day, vi. the posture/seat, vii. the arrangement, viii. the symbolic shape, ix.  the gesture, x. the letters, xi. the rising of the element, xii. the fire sticks, xiii.  the rosary, xiv. the fire, xv. the material for writing, xvi. the fire pit, xvii. the  small wooden sacrificial ladle, xviii. the large ladle, and xix. the stylus. (Verses  4-5)</p>
<p>I - II. THE PRESIDING DEITIES OF THE SIX RITES AND THEIR COLORS</p>
<ol>
<li>Rati, 2. Vani, 3. Rama, 4. Jyestha, 5. Durga, and 6. Kali are the deities [of  the rites]. They are 1. white, 2. red, 3. yellow, 4. variegated, 5. dark, and 6.  gray. At the beginning of the rite [the practitioner] should worship them with  flowers of the [deity&rsquo;s] respective color in sequence. (Verses 6-7ab)</li>
</ol>
<p>SIX RITES OF MAGIC 455</p>
<p>III. THE SIX SEASONS AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE SIX RITES</p>
<p>The six seasons are spring, and so forth. Day and night come in sequence [as  they are mentioned]. The duration of each season is considered to be ten times  twenty-four minutes [four hours]. The wise man should connect 1. winter  [November-January], 2. the [season] called spring [March-May], 3. the cool  season [January-March], 4. summer [May-July], 5. the rainy season [July-Sep</p>
<p>tember], [and] 6. autumn [September-November] with the six rites in se quence. (Verses 7cd-9ab)</p>
<p>IV. THE SIX DIRECTIONS THE PRACTITIONER FACES DURING THE RITES</p>
<p>The directions are, in sequence, 1. northeast, 2. north, 3. east, 4. southwest, 5.  northwest, and 6. southeast. (Verses 9cd-10ab)</p>
<p>V. DAYS OF THE LUNAR MONTH AND OF THE WEEK SUITABLE FOR THE RITES</p>
<p>He should perform the respective rites while repeating the mantra [and] facing  the respective direction. And the second [lunar day] and seventh as well as the  fifth [and] the third [lunar day] in the bright half [of the month] coinciding  with a Wednesday or Thursday is approved of in the 1. appeasement rite.  Equally, the fourth, ninth, sixth, [or] thirteenth lunar day [of the bright half]  coinciding with a Thursday or Monday is recommended in the 2. subjugation  rite. And the eleventh, tenth, ninth, and again the eighth coinciding with a  Saturday or Friday is prescribed in the 4. enmity rite. The rite called 5. eradi cation should be performed on the [following days] for attainment of success:  the fourteenth or eighth in the dark [half of the month], when it coincides  with a Saturday. When the fourteenth and eighth day occuring in the dark  [half of the month], [and] when the new moon day [and] the [day] coming at  the end of the [dark half, that is, the first day of the bright half] coincide with  a Sunday, Saturday and Tuesday, [the time] is auspicious for 3. immobilization  and 6. liquidation. (Verses 10cd-15ab)</p>
<p>VI. SIX SUITABLE POSTURES AND SEATS FOR MANTRA REPETITION</p>
<p>In appeasement and other [rites], he should maintain in sequence the most  excellent posture: 1. the lotus, 2. svastika, 3. vikata, 4. cock, 5. diamond, and  6. bhadra. Having sat on the hide of 1. a cow, 2. rhinoceros, 3. elephant, 4.  jackal, as well as 5. a sheep or 6. buffalo, he should perform the repetition [of  the mantra] in the rites of appeasement, and so forth. (Verses 15cd-17ab)</p>
<p>VII. SIX ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE LETTERS OF THE MANTRA AND THOSE OF THE  VICTIM&rsquo;S NAME</p>
<p>Having explained the seats in this way, the arrangement is now being explained.  The following are considered the six arrangements in the rites: 1. granthana,</p>
<p>4 5 6 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN</p>
<p>the [arrangement] called 2. vidarbha, 3. samputa, as well as 4. rodhana, 5.  yoga, and 6. pallava. And now the definition of each of these six is stated:  1. There should be one syllable of the mantra, then a syllable of the [victim&rsquo;s]  name; again a syllable of the mantra and a syllable of the name. In this way,  granthana is described.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In the beginning, there are two letters of the mantra, then one letter of  the name; in this way [it is done] again and again. [Thus] vidarbha is explained  by the most excellent connoisseurs of mantras.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having first uttered the mantra, he should then recite the complete name  [and] at the end the mantra in inverted order. This is called samputa.  4. The mantra [inserted] in the beginning, middle, and end of the name,  however, is rodhana.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mantra [inserted] at the end of the name, on the other hand, is yoga.  6. The name [appearing] at the end of the mantra is pallava. (Verses 17cd 23ab)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>VIII. THE SYMBOLIC SHAPES OF THE ELEMENTS</p>
<p>The symbolic shape of water is said to resemble a half moon, marked with two  lotuses on both sides; it is recommended in the 1. appeasement rite.  The symbolic shape of fire, however, for 2. subjugation is a triangle endowed  with svastika[s].</p>
<p>A square connected with thunderbolt[s], however, is the symbolic shape of  earth for 3. immobilization.</p>
<p>A circle is the [symbolic shape] of ether for 4. enmity.</p>
<p>A [circle] marked with six dots, on the other hand, is the symbolic shape of  wind for 5. eradication; the fire shape [described before is the symbolic shape]  for 6. liquidation. (Verses 23cd-26ab)</p>
<p>IX. SIX HAND GESTURES FOR THE SIX RITES; THREE HAND GESTURES FOR THE FIRE  RITUAL AND THEIR DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>The 1. lotus, 2. noose, 3. mace, 4. pestle, 5. thunderbolt, and 6. sword should  be the six hand gestures in the six rites. Now the [gestures] for the fire ritual  are being told: &ldquo;[female] deer,&rdquo; &ldquo;goose,&rdquo; [and] &ldquo;sow&rdquo; are the three hand gestures  approved of in the fire ritual.</p>
<p>When the middle finger, ring finger, and thumb are joined, the gesture is  considered the &ldquo;[female] deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all except the little finger are joined [the gesture] is considered the  &ldquo;goose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hand is contracted it is the &ldquo;sow.&rdquo; The definitions of gestures have  been stated. For appeasement and subjugation, the &ldquo;[female] deer&rdquo; and &ldquo;goose&rdquo;  are employed; for immobilization and others, the &ldquo;sow.&rdquo; (Verses 26-29)</p>
<p>SIX RITES OF MAGIC 457</p>
<p>X. THE LETTERS: LETTERS ASSIGNED TO THE MOON AND THE ELEMENTS EMPLOYED  IN THE YANTRAS OF THE RITES; THE SIX &ldquo;CLASSES&rdquo; OR CLOSING WORDS OF  MANTRAS</p>
<p>Practitioners of mantras state that, in the six rites, the seed syllables of a yan tra consist of the letters of the moon, water, earth, ether, wind, and fire. The  [sixteen] vowels [and] sa and tha are the letters of the moon. The letters of  the [five] elements have been mentioned [in 24.80-83]. These [letters] with out the letters of the moon, should be taken in rites, such as subjugation.  Some specify 1. sa, 2. va, 3. la, 4. ha, 5. ya, [and] 6. ra [equivalent to water,  earth, ether, wind, fire] as the letters of the moon, and so forth. (Verses 30- 32ab)</p>
<p>In rites such as appeasement, the most excellent connoisseurs of mantras  should know the following six as &ldquo;classes&rdquo; in sequence: 1. namah, 2. svaha, 3.  vasat, 4. vausat, 5. hum, and 6. phat. (Verses 32cd-33ab)</p>
<p>XL THE RISE OF THE ELEMENTS DETERMINED BY OBSERVING THE TOUCH OF THE  BREATH ON THE NOSTRILS</p>
<p>Should the breath move below both nostrils, then the rise of the water [ele ment] is to be known, which grants success in the 1. appeasement rite.  When the movement of the breath resorts to the ridge of the nose, it is the  rise of the earth, [the element suitable] for 3. immobilization.  When it moves in the middle of the nostrils, it is the rise of ether, which is  auspicious for 4. enmity.</p>
<p>When the breath moves above the nostrils, it would be the rise of fire, [and]  then there is success in two rites, for 6. liquidation and 2. subjugation.  When the breath moves sideways, the rise of wind should be recognized [as  suitable] for 5. eradication. (Verses 33cd-36)</p>
<p>XII. THE FIRE STICKS SMEARED WITH DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES AND USED IN THE  FIRE RITUAL FORMING PART OF THE SIX RITES</p>
<p>Durva [used as] fire sticks, smeared with the clarified butter of a cow, [is  used] for I. appeasement. Pomegranate shoots smeared with the clarified but ter of a goat [are offered] in a fire ritual for 2. subjugation. Fire sticks from  the raja tree smeared with clarified butter from a sheep [are used] for 3. im mobilization. Fire sticks from the thorn apple [tree] smeared with atasi oil  [are used] for 4. enmity. [Fire sticks] from the mango [tree] smeared with  mustard oil are approved of in the 5. eradication rite. [Fire sticks] from the  khadira [tree] smeared with mustard oil are recommended for 6. liquidation.  (Verses 37-39)</p>
<p>458 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN</p>
<p>XIII. ROSARIES: MATERIALS USED, FINGERS EMPLOYED IN ROTATION AND NUMBER  OF BEADS</p>
<p>The [following] rosaries should be known in sequence in rites beginning with  appeasement: those made from 1. conch shells, 2. lotus seeds, 3. the fruits of  the nimba and arista [trees], 4. the teeth of the deceased, 5. the teeth of a horse,  [and] 6. the teeth of a donkey.</p>
<p>The wise man should rotate the rosary placed on the middle finger with the  thumb in 1. appeasement, 2. subjugation and acquisition [-related rites, and]  in mantra repetition whose aims are worldly enjoyment and liberation. The  wise man should repeat the mantra [rotating the rosary] by joining the ring  finger and thumb in the rite of 3. immobilization. However, the wise man  should repeat the mantra by joining the index finger and thumb for 4. enmity  and 5. eradication, [and] by joining the little finger and thumb for 6. liquida tion.</p>
<p>The number of beads in an auspicious rite would be 108, half of it [54], or  half of the [half, 27]. In destructive magic, the number [of beads] is 15. (Verses  40-44)</p>
<p>XIV. FIRE RITUAL: FIRE STICKS USED IN LIGHTING THE FIRE; THE TONGUES OF THE  FIRE; AND THE RITUAL FEEDING OF BRAHMANS</p>
<ol>
<li>Appeasement [and 2.] subjugation [are performed] in the ordinary fire, 3.  immobilization in a fire lit by vata [sticks], [and] 4. enmity [in a fire] lit by  bibhitaka [sticks]; the remaining two [rites, that is, 5. eradication and 6. li quidation, are performed in a fire] located in the cremation grounds. In an  auspicious rite, the connoisseur of the mantra should light the fire for the fire  ritual with fire sticks from the bilva, arka, palasa, or ksira trees; in an inaus picious [rite, with sticks] from the visa and bibhitaka, nimba, thorn apple, and  Slesmataka.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the rite of 1. appeasement, he should worship the tongue of the fire called  Suprabha; in 2. the subjugation rite, indeed, [the tongue] called Rakta; for 3.  immobilization, the one called Kanaka; for 4. enmity, the tongue Gagana; and  for 5. eradication, Atiraktika. For 6. liquidation, on the other hand, he should  worship Krsna. However, [he may worship] Bahurupa in any case. (Verses 45 - 49ab)</p>
<p>In rites, such as appeasement, he should also know the special number [of  brahmans] to be fed. For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, he should feed  brahmans [numbering] one-tenth the [number of offerings in the] fire ritual.  That would be the best rite; the mediocre one, on the other hand, is [per</p>
<p>formed] with [the feeding of brahmans numbering] one twenty-fifth [the num ber of fire offerings]. The feeding of brahmans, on the other hand, [numbering]  one one-hundredth [the number of offerings] of the fire ritual, that is, indeed,  the lowest [rite]. For 3. immobilization, the feeding of brahmans is held to be</p>
<p>SIX RITE S O F MAGI C 459</p>
<p>double [that is, one-fifth] the proportion [of offerings given] for appeasement;  for 4. enmity [and] 5. eradication, three times [the number of offerings in the  fire ritual, and] for 6. liquidation, [the prescribed number] equals the [number  of offerings in the] fire ritual. Brahmans should be fed with pleasing foods,  should have been born in a very pure family, should know the Veda and [its]  supplements, and should be pure, [and] devoted to virtuous conduct. One  should consider them deities [and] should worship them. They should be  bowed to repeatedly. They should be gratified with sweet words [and] by of ferings of gold, and so forth. [The practitioner] obtains his wish before long,  once he has received their blessings. The sin that accrues from destructive  magical rites vanishes by the [auspicious] utterance of brahmans. (Verses  49cd-55ab)</p>
<p>XV. MATERIALS AND SUBSTANCES FOR DRAWING YANTRAS</p>
<p>Sandalwood paste, yellow pigment, turmeric, domestic smoke [-soot], charcoal  from the funeral pyre, [and] the eight poisonous substances [are employed] in  drawing yantras for appeasement, and so on. He may certainly also take those  previously described [in 20.22-118] writing materials. The eight poisonous  substances are black pepper, pippali [long pepper], dry ginger, excrement of  vultures, citraka [wood], domestic smoke, juice of the thorn apple [tree], and  salt. For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, the most excellent connoisseur  of mantras should draw the yantra on birchbark; for 3. immobilization, on tiger  skin; for 4. enmity, on donkey skin; for 5. eradication, on a banner cloth; [and]  for 6. liquidation, on human bone. Whatever receptacles were mentioned in  the yantra chapter [20.12-13], they are also approved of. (Verses 55cd-59)</p>
<p>XVI. THE SHAPES OF THE FIRE PITS AND AUSPICIOUS DIRECTIONS</p>
<p>In the rites beginning with appeasement, the fire pit has [the form] of (1) a  circle, (2) lotus, (3) square, (4) triangle, (5) hexagon, or (6) half moon, in the  directions (1) west, (2) north, (3) east, (4) southwest, (5) northwest, and (6)  south, in sequence. (Verses 60-61ab)</p>
<p>XVII.-XVIII. MATERIAL FOR THE SMALL WOODEN SACRIFICIAL LADLE AND THE  LARGE LADLE</p>
<p>In [rites of] appeasement and subjugation, the small wooden sacrifical ladle  and the large ladle are golden and made from the fig tree. In rites such as the  one for immobilization, both are indeed held to be of iron. (Verses 61cd-62ab)</p>
<p>XIX. THE STYLUS: DIFFERENT MATERIALS USED AND THE SUITABLE TIME FOR  ITS MANUFACTURE</p>
<p>The stylus is made of gold, made of silver, [or] made from jati [twig] for  1. appeasement; for 2. subjugation, [it is] made from durva sprouts; for 3.</p>

<p>immobilization, from the agastya tree - or it could be made from the raja tree;  for 4. enmity, however, from the karanja [twig]. For an auspicious rite, the  wise man should make the stylus on a pleasant day; for 5. eradication, from  bibhitaka; for 6. liquidation, however, from human bone. For an inauspicious  rite, on the other hand, [the wise man should make] it, on the rikta days [that  is, the fourth, ninth, and fourteenth day of the lunar month], on Tuesday, or  on visti [-karana, that is, one of eleven divisions of the day]. (Verses 62cd 65ab)&rsquo;</p>
<p>THE PRACTITIONER&rsquo;S DIET</p>
<p>Now food, material for pouring libations, and the vessel for the [libations] are  described. For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, food fit for sacrifice [is  recommended]; for 3. immobilization, rice pudding; for 4. enmity, masa and  mudga beans; for 5. eradication from a place, wheat; for 6. liquidation, rice  with red lentils, as well as syama(ka) [grain], [and] pudding from goat milk.  [Thus] the foods of the practitioners of mantras who perform the rites have  been stated. (Verses 65cd-67)</p>
<p>SUBSTANCES FOR POURING LIBATIONS</p>
<p>For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, water mixed with turmeric is pre scribed for the pouring of libations, [and] slightly warm [water] with black  pepper, and so on, for 3. immobilization as well as 6. liquidation. Water mixed  with the blood of a sheep is recommended for 4. enmity and 5. eradication.  (Verses 68-69ab)</p>
<p>VESSELS USED FOR POURING LIBATIONS</p>
<p>A golden vessel should be [used] for pouring libations in the 1. appeasement  and 2. subjugation rites; for 3. immobilization, a clay vessel; for 4. enmity, one  made of khadira [wood]; for 4. eradication, one of iron. For 6. liquidation,  however, a fowl&rsquo;s egg [should be used]. (Verses 69cd-70)</p>
<p>BODY POSTURES MAINTAINED WHILE POURING LIBATIONS</p>
<p>For 1. appeasement [and] 2. subjugation, he should pour libations while seated  on a soft seat; for 3. immobilization, while resting on both knees; for 4. enmity,  and so on, while standing on one foot. (Verse 71)</p>
<p>DRAWBACKS OF DESIRE-ORIENTED RITES</p>
<p>Thus the procedure for the six rites has been stated for the satisfaction of the  connoisseurs of mantras. After having properly performed the types of nyasa,  and having performed the self-protection, the desire-oriented rites should be</p>
<p>SIX RITES OF MAGIC 461</p>
<p>performed; otherwise, there would be defeat. The mantra can become the en emy of the practitioner who has performed either auspicious or inauspicious  desire-oriented rites; therefore, he should not become attached to it. The desire oriented rite described by previous teachers was explained for the satisfaction  of those whose minds are attached to [sense] objects; but it is not conducive  to welfare. Those who are attached to desire-oriented rites can only [obtain]  limited results. Those who worship God without desire attain all siddhis [su pernatural powers]. (Verses 72-76ab)</p>
<p>SUPERIORITY OF WORSHIP WITHOUT SELFISH MOTIVES</p>
<p>[The practitioner] should avoid attachment to whatever performances were  stated [prior to the discussion of the six rites as appropriate] for each mantra,  for attaining happiness, and should worship the deity without desire. In the  Veda, three sections have been given: ritual, worship, and knowledge. The  means is described in two of these sections; in the third, the goal is stated.  Therefore [the practitioner] should perform what is stated in the Veda and  worship the deities, by means of which a pure-minded man obtains the highest  knowledge. The individual soul, consisting of consciousness which has entered  the body, is the complete brahman itself. Knowing this, he is liberated. And  having obtained a human body, he should worship the deities. He who is not  liberated from existence is a great sinner. Therefore the most excellent of men  should strive to obtain knowledge of the self by rites and the worship of deities,  [and] by eliminating the group of enemies, such as desire. (Verses 76cd-81)</p>
<p>RITUAL FOR DETERMINING FUTURE SUCCESS BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE  PROCEDURE OF PERFECTING A MANTRA</p>
<p>[The practitioner] who wishes to perform the worship of a deity should first  consider the future. Having taken a bath, performed the twilight [ritual], and  so on, [and] having recollected the lotuslike foot of Hari, he should lie down  on a bed of kusa [grass and] pray to the bull-bannered [Siva]: &ldquo;O Lord, Lord  of the God of gods, bearer of the trident, who rides on a bull! Announce, O  eternal one, the good and bad, while I am asleep. Salutation to the unborn,  three-eyed, tawny, great-souled one. Salutation to the handsome, omnipresent  lord of dreams. Tell me the truth in the dream regarding all matters completely.  O great lord, by your grace I will accomplish success in the ritual.&rdquo; Having  prayed to Siva with these mantras, he should sleep calmly. In the morning he  should tell the preceptor the dream he had at night. The connoisseur of the  mantra should himself reflect on the [significance of] the dream, without the  [preceptor, if he is unavailable]. (Verses 82-87)</p>
<p>AUSPICIOUS DREAMS</p>
<p>The vision of the following in the dream is auspicious: a phallic symbol [of  Siva]; the disks of the moon and sun; [the goddess] Sarasvati; the [river] Gan-</p>
<p>4 6 2 GUDRUN BUHNEMANN</p>
<p>ges; the preceptor; crossing the Ocean of Blood; victory in battle; worship of  [the fire god] Agni; residing in a chariot [yoked with] peacocks, geese, and  ruddy geese; sexual intercourse; mounting a crane and acquisition of land; a  river; a palace; a chariot; a lotus; a parasol; a girl; a tree with fruits; an elephant;  a lamp; a yak; a flower; a bull and horse; a mountain; ajar with liquor; heavenly  bodies; stars; a woman; sunrise; heavenly nymphs; ascending palaces, or moun</p>
<p>tains and chariots; going through the sky; consuming liquor and meat; applying  feces [to the body]; sprinkling with blood; eating rice with curd; coronation  as a king; a cow, bull, and banners; a lion; a lion throne; a conch; a musical  instrument; yellow pigment; curd; a sandalwood [tree], or a mirror. (Verses  88-93)</p>
<p>INAUSPICIOUS DREAMS</p>
<p>The following are not auspicious in a dream: [the sight of] a man anointed  with oil; a dark-colored one; a naked one; a pit, a crow, and a dry thorny tree;  an outcaste; a man with a long neck, and a palace without roof. In the case of  a bad dream, he should perform an appeasement. He should repeat the mantra  with concentration. For three years, obstacles may arise for him who performs  mantra repetition. Should he be devoted to the mantra repetition regardless of  the host of obstacles, having faith in success, he attains success in the fourth  year. (Verses 94-97ab)</p>
<p>INDICATIONS OF THE PERFECTION OF THE MANTRA</p>
<p>Tranquillity of mind, contentment, hearing the sound of a drum, of a song, of  the sound of beating time; the vision of heavenly musicians; seeing his luster  as equal to that of the sun; the conquest of sleep and hunger; beauty, health,  composure, [and] the absence of anger and greed - if the connoisseur of the  mantra notices these and other signs, he should recognize the perfection of the  mantra [and] the deity&rsquo;s grace. Then he should make additional effort in mantra  repetition for attaining knowledge. One who has attained knowledge will have  his purpose accomplished. He is liberated from existence, knowing that the  self is the highest brahman, as explained by the Vedanta [texts]. (Verses 97cd 101)</p>
<p>CONCLUDING VERSE</p>
<p>I worship that Brahman, the all-pervading Lord who, in the form of various  deities, grants man [fulfillment of his] desire. (Verse 102)</p>
