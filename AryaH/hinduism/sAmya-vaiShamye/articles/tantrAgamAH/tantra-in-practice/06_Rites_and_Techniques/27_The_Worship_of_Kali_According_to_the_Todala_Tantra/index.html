  <meta property="og:description" content="Sanjukta Gupta
To many Hindu Bengalis, Kali is the most important divinity. Identified with the great Goddess, Devi Bhagavati, she subsumes all other goddesses. She is held to be equal in status to Durga and their annual festivals, which occur close to each other, are celebrated with the greatest grandeur: feasts are held, gifts are ex
changed, and new clothes are worn in honor of the Goddess. Both Durga and Kali, facets of the same supreme Goddess, are fierce and aggressive. The Goddess is the embodiment of the divine power, potency, and dynamism. After the great dissolution of the worlds she regenerates the creation and sustains it until the time arrives when she must withdraw it into herself. She possesses both negative and positive elements in her divine personality. She is the nurturing Mother of created beings as well as the sovereign cosmic ruler who maintains cosmic law and order through her invincible power and irresistible energy. She punishes the evil and rewards the righteous. Above all, she protects all her creatures and is especially kind and sweet to her loyal devotees, like an indulgent mother to her devoted children.">

  <p>Sanjukta Gupta</p>
<p>To many Hindu Bengalis, Kali is the most important divinity. Identified with the  great Goddess, Devi Bhagavati, she subsumes all other goddesses. She is held to  be equal in status to Durga and their annual festivals, which occur close to each  other, are celebrated with the greatest grandeur: feasts are held, gifts are ex</p>
<p>changed, and new clothes are worn in honor of the Goddess. Both Durga and  Kali, facets of the same supreme Goddess, are fierce and aggressive. The Goddess  is the embodiment of the divine power, potency, and dynamism. After the great  dissolution of the worlds she regenerates the creation and sustains it until the  time arrives when she must withdraw it into herself. She possesses both negative  and positive elements in her divine personality. She is the nurturing Mother of  created beings as well as the sovereign cosmic ruler who maintains cosmic law  and order through her invincible power and irresistible energy. She punishes the  evil and rewards the righteous. Above all, she protects all her creatures and is  especially kind and sweet to her loyal devotees, like an indulgent mother to her  devoted children.</p>
<p>The cult of Kali has a long history of development in which her character has  undergone many changes. In an essay on &ldquo;Saivism and the Tantric Tradition,&rdquo;  Alexis Sanderson explains that in the ninth and tenth centuries C.E., the Kashmiri  Tantric exegetes classified and systematized Tantric texts according to the various  cults, mainly of goddesses and fearsome gods. The main emphasis was on specific  mantras and esoteric practices associated with those mantras, one of which is  called the Seat of Awareness (vidya-pitha). The texts dealing with the most esoteric  Kali cults are associated with the vidya-pitha. The practices they prescribe include  the so-called left-hand tradition (vama-marga), antinomian practices that involve  alcohol, blood, and sex; these came to be called Kaula practices. The name vidya.  here denotes esoteric mantras that are considered embodiments of the supreme  knowledge or awareness that is indeed Kali. Here she is called Kali not because  of her dark complexion but because she absorbs and transcends Time (tola), and  is thus the eternal transcendent reality (Kalasamkarsini). Kali thus became the464 SANJUKTA GUPTA</p>
<p>supreme godhead of this cult transcending even Siva. This Kali cult developed  through various streams and survived in the cult of Guhyakali, worshiped in  Nepal as Guhyesvari and in Mithila (Bihar) even today (Sanderson 1990: 138- 54). At the same period in Kashmir, there grew up a strong parallel Tantric cult  known as the cult of the three goddesses, the Trika. They are Para, transcendent;  Parapara, transcendent as well as material; and Apara, material. The second and  the third are related to the cosmic process of creation; the second is the state in  which the transcendent unity of reality is disturbed and the goddess experiences  the stir of polarized existence within herself, which heralds the next moment in  the cosmic evolution of diverse creation.</p>
<p>As Sanderson points out, these two cults affected one another. &ldquo;The cult of the  three goddesses and that of Kali were not sealed off from each other in the manner  of rival sects. The Jay adrathayamala shows that the devotees of Kali had developed  their own versions of the cult of the three goddesses. The Trika in its turn assim</p>
<p>ilated these and other new and more esoteric treatments from the left. Conse quently we find a later Trika in which Kalasamkarsini has been introduced to be  worshipped above the three goddesses of the trident&rdquo; (Sanderson 1990: 146).  This tendency continued throughout the history of the Kali cult and is clearly  noticeable in the Sakti-samgama Jantra (1.1.28-47), in which the three goddesses  of the vidyas - Kali, Tara, and Chinna, that is, Chinnamasta - form a kind of  triad. Indeed, Sanderson has described how the adherents of the Kali cult inter preted the name Kali. &ldquo;So, as Abhinavagupta tells us in his Tantraloka, the auton omous consciousness which is the Absolute is called Kali (i) because it throws,  in the sense that it projects the universe, causing to appear as though beyond it  . . . ; (ii) because through it the projection returns to (&lsquo;goes to&rsquo;) its identity as  cognition . . . ; (iii) because it knows the projected, in the sense that it represents  it as identical with its own identity . . . ; (iv) because it enumerates the projection,  in the sense that it distinguishes each element from all the others within its own  unity . . . ; and (v) because it sounds, in the sense that when it has dissolved the  projection it continues as the resonance of internal self-awareness&rdquo; (Sanderson  1990: 164).</p>
<p>In the Mahavidya cult, the primary goddess-emanations from Kali the supreme  and absolute consciousness form a horizontal triad at the cosmic differentiated  level, that is, Mahamaya, Sundarr and Bhairavi, to replace the Puranic triad of  Brahma, Visnu, and Rudra/Siva (Brown 1974: 118-80). Although Brahma and  so on were not totally removed from their cosmic functions, they moved to a  subservient position.</p>
<p>The Todala Tantra, translated below, was probably composed relatively late, in  the fourteenth century C.E, It is a small Tantra that contains ten chapters (patalas)  with 398 verses. It became very popular in Bengal, especially in the early modern  period, and has been quoted as a scriptural authority in many Bengali priestly  handbooks such as the Purohita-darpana on the ritual worship of Daksina Kali,  also called Adya Kali. Our text is mainly interested in the ritual worship of Kali  and other Mahavidyas. It mentions all the Mahavidyas, who are here more than</p>
<p>WORSHI P O F KALI 465</p>
<p>ten in number, and also mentions their companions, who are different manifes tations of Siva. It succinctly gives all the ritual sequences needed for the worship  of the first two Mahavidyas, including the esoteric formulas (mantras) and the  accompanying process of meditation (see Gupta 1977: 125-57). It also records  a complete program of Siva worship with mantras and so on, which seems to be  the same for every manifestation. According to it, it is imperative to worship Siva  immediately after worshiping the relevant Mahavidya.</p>
<p>In the traditional way, the text is presented as a dialogue between Siva and his  divine spouse Parvati, who is the pupil and the interlocutor, whereas Siva is the  teacher of the sacred science (sastra). Very little theological or ontological dis cussion is found in the text, though often it refers to the ultimacy of Kali. The  text gives important information about the esoteric meaning of the mantras of the  first three Mahavidyas and the practice of Tantric yoga; the esoteric kundalini yoga receives special treatment. Inheriting the Krama tradition of monistic power theism (sakti-advaya), the Todala Tantra asserts that esoteric yoga is higher than  esoteric rituals, as the latter involve differentiated awareness whereas yoga does  not. This is elaborated by means of a description of kundalini-yoga, giving a  detailed parallel of the microcosm with the macrocosm. Kundalini-yoga leads to  release from samsara as the yogin becomes one with the Goddess, having severed  the veil of delusion, maya, by means of vidya. In connection with esoteric yoga  practice, our text gives three important yogic postures: the yoni mudra, svalpa  yoni mudra, and kakicancu mudra. All are postures for practicing kundalini yoga,  where controlling the flow of air in the body by blocking all natural outlets of air  is of the highest importance. Although it presents mantras and rituals concerning  the Mahavidyas, the treatment is so brief that the text needs to be supplemented  by other handbooks, such as the Tantrasara of Krenananda or Kaulavalinirnaya  of Jnananandagiri (see Goudriaan and Gupta 1981: 139, 144).</p>
<p>In order to understand the theological background of our text, we have to turn  to other scriptural sources from the medieval period (roughly 1200 to 1800 C.E.).  They mainly belong to eastern India, and some may be from Bengal. By this time  the Tara-Ugratara-Ekajata cult of the Buddhist Tantric tradition merged into the  Kali and other Mahavidya cults presented in the Todala Tantra. To understand  the history and nature of Kali, the supreme Goddess, in eastern India in the  medieval period (roughly 1200 C.E. to 1800 C.E.), three texts can be considered  the most important. One is the Sakti-samgama Tantra (SsT), a large compendium  of the rituals and mantras and other esoteric practices associated with Kali and  her other manifestations. This text, as well as the Tantrasara and the Devima hatmya (DM), which constitutes the final section of the Markandeya Purana, have  shaped the Tantric philosophy, theology, and practice of the Kali cult in Bengal.  There the Devimahatmya is simply called Candi (the fierce lady), and devout Tan</p>
<p>tries recite it daily. In fact Kali&rsquo;s iconography, as followed by the traditional image  makers, shows traces of the description of the goddess Kali in that text.  The Devimahatmya represents Kali as a minor emanation of the Goddess, a  demonic figure, fearsome and grotesque. Having emanated from the angry third</p>
<p>466 SANJUKTA GUPTA</p>
<p>eye of the supreme Goddess to help the Goddess in her battle against the demon  host of Sumbha and Nisumbha, she was employed to lick up every drop of blood  of Raktabija, the demon general. Raktabija&rsquo;s peculiarity was that even a drop of  his blood shed on the earth produced countless clones. Kali&rsquo;s lolling tongue sym</p>
<p>bolizes this blood-licking task. Her demonic nature is also symbolized by her  fangs and by the countless severed heads and limbs dripping blood that cover  her body. She is intoxicated by drinking blood, and in her frenzy she laughs  loudly, baring her upper teeth.</p>
<p>The Kalika Purana (KP), on the other hand, describes Kali as possessing a  soothing dark complexion, as perfectly beautiful, riding a lion, four-armed, hold ing a sword and blue lotuses, her hair unrestrained, body firm and youthful (KP  5.52). A third view is found in such Tantric texts as the Sakti-samgama Tantra,  where Kali, naked, is seated on the supine body of Siva, immersed in the pleasure  of reverse sexual intercourse with him. These three separate views of the supreme  goddess Kali have influenced her modern iconography, although the third variety,  the goddess seated on the inert body of Siva, is rarely used outside esoteric wor ship. In the Sakti-samgama Tantra, though, we get two quite different descriptions  of Kali. In her supreme state, Kali is, as Sanderson describes, just the light of pure  consciousness, but in the creating state she is depicted in a form more awe inspiring than charming.</p>
<p>The supreme Goddess is forever associated with the supreme god Siva, the pair  forming an indivisible unit. But in this late tradition, Kali often supersedes Siva  and acts independently to initiate creation. Although creation is based on her  aspect as Maya, this often appears to be a biological activity. This point is em</p>
<p>phasized in the iconography of Kali and Tara, both of whom appear to be having  coitus with Siva, who is lying like a corpse. Siva&rsquo;s representation as a corpse  emphasizes his total inertness and passivity in the act of creation; the initiative in  creation belongs to the Goddess. Therefore Siva is not a corpse but is only de</p>
<p>picted as one. The Todala Tantra emphasizes this point. Kali&rsquo;s association with  Visnu as Visnu-maya is also underscored in this tradition. In order to enhance  the supremacy of the Goddess, the Devimahatmya took over the early Vaisnava  myth of the creation of the earth from the marrow and fat of two demons called  Madhu and Kaitabha, and replaced Visnu with Devi as the slayer of the demons.  The Kalika Purana, in fact, calls the cult of the supreme Goddess Vaisnavi Tantra,  and the main mantra, which is a salutation to the supreme deity with some  mystical syllables added, indeed addresses that deity: Om hrim srim vaisnavyai  namam. This has been noted by Brown: &ldquo;Thus does the Devi Bhagavati, although  eternal, manifest herself again and again for the protection of the world, O King&rdquo;  (Devimahatmya 12.36), clearly echoing the famous description of Visnu/Krsna&rsquo;s  avataras in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita (Brown 1990: 133-34). Both  the Todala Tantra and Sakti-samgama Tantra make some sort of equation between  the ten avataras of Visnu and the ten great vidya emanations of the Goddess. Her  closeness to Visnu/Krsna is often mythicized when she is cast as Visnu&rsquo;s sister or  the embodiment of Visnu&rsquo;s maya. In late tradition the Goddess superseded all  three cosmic gods - Brahma, Visnu, and Rudra.</p>
<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 467</p>
<p>The Sakti-samgama Tantra describes the creative activity of the goddess Kali as  follows: Daksina (compassionate) Kali, the primeval goddess, was dancing the  dance of cosmic dissolution surrounded by howling jackals and other carrion devouring beasts. The destroyed universe lay at her feet like a heap of corpses.  Kali is pure consciousness, totally transcendent, the unique Being. She subsumes  both Siva and the divine Power, Sakti. At a certain primordial moment, Kali  suddenly saw inside herself her own mirror image or shadow, which is indeed  delusion, Maya. In that Maya, Kali created the imagined form of Siva, who became  the primeval god and Kali&rsquo;s spouse. Kali then created empty space, and the chaos  of the destroyed universe disappeared as she engaged in sexual intercourse with  Siva, taking the reverse position and the active role. After a long coitus, Kali  produced one fetus, which developed into a perfectly beautiful girl whom Kali  called Sundari, the beautiful lady. Her beauty completely deluded Siva, who  wanted to put into words his agitation and longing. Siva&rsquo;s longing and desire for  self-expression produced Speech, which from its central unity developed into the  system of sounds, letters, and language, and became all-pervasive. Siva, however,  on creating Speech, first addressed the goddess Sundari as his heart&rsquo;s desire, the  loveliest in the three worlds, the exquisite sovereign deity and the ocean of nec tarlike compassion. Next Siva addressed Kali as most terrifying, howling like a  jackal, cruel-fanged and fearfully ugly, with lolling tongue and frightening roar.  As Siva uttered these two sentences addressing the two goddesses, Kali, as if  offended, suddenly disappeared, leaving Siva with Sundari, the product of delu sion, to get on with the task of creation. Kali, who is transcendent and the essence  of the creation, transformed herself into the abstract cosmic dynamic power. But  Siva became utterly despondent and confused without Kali; therefore the com</p>
<p>passionate Kali removed Siva&rsquo;s confusion and infused him with unimpeded cog nitive knowledge and desire to procreate. Moreover, in order to infuse him with  power she taught Siva the method of Tantric kundalini yoga and gave him as his  partner the beautiful goddess who is indeed the mother of the universe, Ambika,  the cosmic Creatrix (SsT 1.1.22-45).</p>
<p>This myth neatly puts forward the idea that the transcendent supreme divinity  is female; that she is the goddess Daksina Kali, who contains both the cosmic  male and female polarity; that she is the sovereign cosmic ruler who regulates the  system of creation; and that the creation is based on cosmic delusion, which is  her mirror image. This divine delusion, named Maya or Mahamaya, is Kali&rsquo;s divine  capacity, which ensures that in spite of the perfect oneness of Kali and Siva, the  latter is separated in an imaginary form by means of Kali&rsquo;s delusory power. Siva  is then deluded into thinking himself to be a separate divinity from Kali and so  feels the attraction of the delusory image of Sundari. Thus the main idea of mo nism, which emphasizes the unity of a single universal essence, and establishes  the illusoriness of the dualistic worldview, is put forward through a creation myth.  The polarized male and female cosmic divinities are results of delusion. In reality,  the supreme goddess Kali is unique and immutable, yet she is the source and  foundation of all creation. Kali, the eternally existent Reality, transcends both  creation and the dissolution of the creation. The appearance of her beautiful</p>
<p>4 6 8 SANJUKTA GUPTA</p>
<p>mirror image, Maya, heralds creation as an evolutionary process, and at that point  of primeval creation Kali, the pure consciousness who exists beyond the reach of  speech and phenomenal creation, disappears behind delusion and its influence - desire - and becomes the cosmic dynamic energy activating the ongoing process  of creation. Siva at the point of creation is the primordial conscious entity, Purusa.  He possesses vidya, omniscience, and iccha, sexual desire, to procreate; and he  is called Sadasiva who, together with Sundari, becomes the primordial couple  (SsT 1.1.103-6). In Tantric ontology, he is Siva-tattva, the cosmic self. The evolv</p>
<p>ing Sakti/Maya, who is identical with the supreme Goddess, is known as Vidya tattva. Together with the individual self, Atma-tattva, they constitute the cosmic  realities who are ultimately one and same.</p>
<p>The nature of the supreme goddess, Mahadevi, and that of supreme delusion,  Mahamaya, are expounded in the Devimahatmya. The Goddess is called Maha maya, the great delusion when she is seen as responsible for the unsatisfactory  and transient nature of this life. The real cause of this is human desire for pos sesion and procreation, and Mahamaya deludes individuals by making desire their  innate quality. But paradoxically the Goddess is also identified as supreme knowl edge, Vidya, which releases individuals from their bondage of desire and the  consequent endless succession of lives and deaths. This is one of the many par adoxes that constitute the mystery of the Goddess&rsquo;s divine nature.</p>
<p>Another important statement in Devimahatmya identifies Maya with Prakrti  which, in the dualistic Samkhya philosophy, is the primordial evolving matter.  This identity was first recorded in the Svetasvatara Upanisad (4.9-10). Coburn  (1996: 34) explains this as follows: &ldquo;On the basis of such passages (DM 1.59 and  4.6) it seems safe to say that the Devi&rdquo; Mahatmya has shifted the focus of the  Samkhya school and the Svetasvatara Upanisad by understanding prakrti not as  the material shroud or possession of spirit but as itself supremely divine, as Devi  herself.&quot; The Sakti-samgama Tantra (1.100) confirms this view by saying that the  supreme Sakti, that is, the Goddess, is Prakrti whereas her mirror image is the  evolving power Mahamaya. Thus Prakrti here refers to the supreme Goddess, who  ultimately is the unique source and origin of all, there being nothing outside of  her.</p>
<p>The Todala Tantra endorses this theological tradition in its accounts of the  nature of the goddess Daksinakali and her other Vidya emanations. Other im portant texts for the development of Kali and her Mahavidya cult are the Cinacara krama Tantra, Matrka-bheda Tantra, Gupta-sadhana Tantra, Kalika Purana,  Brahma-vaivarta Purana, Brahmanda Purana and other Tantric records of that pe riod. The salient feature of this tradition is the total supremacy of the goddess  Kali. In the words of Brown (1990: 217-18),</p>
<p>of the two genders, the feminine represents the dominant power and the authoritative  will in the universe. Yet both genders must be included in the ultimate if it is truly  ultimate. The masculine and feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality,  which goes beyond but still encompasses them. The Devi, in her supreme</p>
<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 469</p>
<p>form as consciousness thus transcends gender, but her transcendence is not apart  from her immanence. Indeed this affirmation of the oneness of transcendence and  immanence constitutes the very essence of the divine mother, as presented in the  Purana (Devi-bhagavata). And here we see what may be called &ldquo;the ultimate triumph&rdquo;  of the goddess in our text. It is not finally, that she is infinitely superior to the male  gods - though she is that, according to the myths in the Devi-bhagavata - but rather  that she transcends her own feminine nature as Prakrti without denying it.</p>
<p>The speciality of the Sakti-samgama Tantra myth is that it neatly puts forward just  this point. Prakrti or the feminine source of the universe is Mahamaya, who is  not Kali but her mirror image. Kali transcends her own evolving mirror image.  In the universe of Mahamaya, both delusion and cognition function. In the case  of Siva, his delusion is restricted to his sexual desire for Sundari, whereas his  cognitive knowledge is otherwise untrammeled. In this sense, it is possible to find  a parallel between the three goddesses Kali, Mahamaya, and Sundari and the three  goddesses Para, Parapara and Apara of the Trika tradition. Sundari corresponds  to the third deity of the Trika triad, that is, Apara (SsT 1.1.102). The Todala  Tantra (1.7-8) confirms this with the statement that she is called the fivefold  lady, Pancami, because she is differentiated as the five cosmic elements.</p>
<p>Kali and the Cult of the Ten Mahavidyas</p>
<p>The Todala Tantra describes the ritual worship of the ten sacred esoteric formulas,  the Mahavidyas. The word vtdya has various Tantric connotations. The great God dess is Vidya because she is perfect knowledge unimpeded by any differentiated  or discursive cognition - cognition without any reference to anything cognized.  This pure cognition brings about release. Vidya also connotes an esoteric formula  which, empowered by its Sakti deity, is capable of bestowing on its Tantric wor shiper great powers (bhukti) and eventually salvation (mukti). These ten Mahavi dyas or great mystic formulas are those of Kali, Tara, Sodasi (also known as  Sundari or Tripurasundari, meaning the Beautiful One in the Three Worlds),  Bhuvanesvari (Sovereign of the Three Worlds), Bhairavi or Tripurabhairavi (the  Fierce Lady), Chinnamasta (the Beheaded Lady), Dhumavati (the Gray Lady, who  is depicted in iconography as a widow with a crow as her symbol), Bagala (the  goddess of battle), Matangi (the goddess of the hunter tribes), and Kamala  (Laksmi). It is obvious that originally the number of formulas was not fixed at  ten. Early texts, such as the Todala Tantra, mention a few other formulas, includ ing those of Durga, Annapurna, and Kulluka. The first two are universally popular  goddesses, and the third became very important in the esoteric practices of the  mantras and vidyas. The Sakti-samgama Tantra, being an encyclopaedic text, men tions both a group of ten Mahavidyas and also other lists of Mahavidyas not  confined to ten members.</p>
<p>The importance of this group of great formulas and their power goddesses grew</p>
<p>470 SANJUKT A GUPT A</p>
<p>enormously in late Tantric, tradition and the goddess Kali became foremost  amongst them. She is considered the original power deity, designated Adya, the  primeval lady. The Todala Tantra deals only with the mantras and ritual worship  of Kali and Tara, whereas Sundari is treated in a rather fragmentary fashion. But  the full treatment of their mantras, especially the monosyllabic seed (bija) mantras,  to some extent covers the other Mahavidyas too, except for Dhumavati. This last  is a somewhat problematic figure: it is difficult to understand why she is included  in this group of power goddesses. Like other ordinary deities, such as Ganesa,  her seed mantra simply consists of the first syllable of her name, dhum. Thus,  although the formulas of each of these goddesses are different, their identities are  not always easy to determine and differentiate. It is also difficult to date the  beginning of their popularity or the crystallization of the group of ten. The Brhad dharma Purana (BdhP) presents the myth of how the ten Mahavidyas appeared in  the following manner:</p>
<p>Siva&rsquo;s wife Sati heard that her father Daksa was arranging the performance of  a huge sacrifice to which all the gods and other celestials were invited except  herself and Siva. Incensed, she told her husband that she was going to her father&rsquo;s  sacrifice to teach him a lesson in sensible behaviour. Siva knew Daksa&rsquo;s animosity  toward himself and Sati, and feared that Sati would be insulted, with catastrophic  results, and so tried to dissuade her from going. Sati became irritated, and changed  into her true Kali form, which she had suppressed when she had agreed to be  born as the beautiful daughter of Daksa and Prasuti, in order to marry Siva. Upon  seeing her terrifying transformation, Siva became completely confused and began  to run away. Even her reassuring words failed to stop him. Then the Goddess  appeared in one of her manifestations in each of the directions as Siva tried to  flee. Finally, at Siva&rsquo;s request, the Goddess explained that she herself was the  supreme reality Kali, the source of all phenomena. At the request of Daksa and  his wife, she had manifested herself as their exquisitely beautiful daughter Sati  and then married Siva. The ten manifestations who were blocking Siva&rsquo;s way in  every direction were her own vidya-manifestations. Before him, that is, to the east,  appeared the Mahavidya Kali; above him, Tara; on his right (south), Chinnamasta;  to his rear, (west), Bagala; on his left, (north), Bhuvanesvari; to his southeast,  Dhumavati; to his southwest, Sundari; to his northwest, Matahgi; to his northeast,  Sodasi; and immersed in his self was Bhairavi. At this revelation of the real identity  and powers of the Goddess, Siva apologized to her for assuming spousal authority  and stopped resisting her departure to her father&rsquo;s home. As a result, Daksa was  ruined, but escaped with his life; Sati, however, lost her life out of the anger and  shame caused by her father&rsquo;s actions (BdhP 2.6.65-89, 128-52).</p>
<p>Let us now attempt to find out who these ten Mahavidyas are. There seems to  be nearly no difference between Kali and Tara in the eastern tradition. The Ma hacinacara-krama Tantra 2.37 explains that in the Mahacina tradition, antinomian  practices are essential for Tara worship. The Todala Tantra agrees about these  special features of Tara. Although the Todala Tantra prescribes for Tara&rsquo;s worship  the use of the five esoteric ingredients (meat, fish, alcohol, woman, and sexual</p>
<p>WORSHI P O F KALI 471</p>
<p>fluids) that signify vamacara practice, it appears to believe that these practices are  not essential for Kali worship. Perhaps this is why this text has been taken in  Bengal to be the scriptural authority for the nonesoteric worship of Kali, both in  temples and in private homes. Other texts like Brhat-nila Tantra and Maha-nirvana  Tantra assert that these practices are essential for Kali worship. However, the  Mahdcinacara-krama Tantra, having said that the four goddesses Daksina Kali,  Tara, Sundari, and Bhairavi share the same style of worship, informs us in a later  statement (2.38) that the latter two goddesses share another, presumably more  orthodox, style of worship (that is, daksinacara), but that the former two must be  adored with antinomian practices (that is, vamacara). In the Brhat-nila Tantra,  Tara is called Nilasarasvati and is described as resting on the corpse, that is, Siva,  in a fighting attitude with her left leg advanced and her right drawn back, young  and smiling yet of awe-inspiring appearance, garlanded with severed heads, short,  pot-bellied, powerful, and wearing a tigerskin. She has four arms and her tongue  is lolling. She has flame-colored matted tresses held on the top of her head in a  single mass on which the face of Aksobhya is placed. She is also addressed as  Ekajata and Ugratara. The popular iconography of Kali, as already noted, is not  very different from Tara&rsquo;s, except for the hair: Kali&rsquo;s hair is loose and disheveled.  All these peculiar features of Tara show her close affinity with the Buddhist god dess Tara (Saviouress), who is very popular among the Buddhists of Tibet and  other Himalayan regions. The Todala Tantra and Sakti-samgama Tantra also name  Aksobhya as Tara&rsquo;s spouse, although a curious myth is offered in the Todala Tantra  to explain how Siva came to be known by that name. The Todala Tantra gives  her seed mantra as strim. Another source, namely, the Pancaratra Laksmi Tantra,  equates Tara with the supreme divine Power that is identical with Vac, the goddess  Speech (Gupta 1972: 177-83; 286-96).</p>
<p>Sodasi and Bhuvanesvari are, it seems, variations of Sundari and Bala and be long to the cult of Tripurasundari or Lalita; on this, see the Parasurama-kalpa  Sutra (PkS). Bhairavi alias Tripurabhairavi also belongs to the same cult. Chin namasta or the Beheaded Lady is depicted as a goddess standing in a fighting  posture with her left leg forward and right leg drawn back. Her right hand holds  a sword with which she has just severed her own head. Three streams of blood  flow from her neck; that on her left is being drunk by a minor goddess called  Dakini, that on her right by Varnini, and the middle one spouts upward and is  being drunk by the goddess&rsquo;s own severed head. She stands on a prone woman  who is in coitus with a supine man lying under her. This couple is considered to  be Madana, the god of sexual desire, and his wife Rati, sexual pleasure. The  goddess is the embodiment of the powerful mantra hum, and is addressed as  Vajravairocani, which again points to a Buddhist goddess (Kinsley 1997: 144- 66). A curious myth is recounted in Sakti-samgama Tantra 4.5.152-73 to explain  this gory iconography. The goddess suddenly left her spouse Siva in the midst of  their amorous play. When she reappeared, Siva asked her why she had disap peared so suddenly and why now she looked so pale. The goddess explained that  she had had to go to bathe together with her friends Dakini and Varnini, who</p>
<p>472 SANJUKT A GUPT A</p>
<p>were hungry. After their bath, the goddess had provided meals for all three of  them with her own blood as it gushed from her severed neck.  Bagala or Bagalamukhi is a golden-complexioned form of Tripurasundari, the  deity who presides over deadly weapons. It is difficult to identify Dhumavati, who  is tall, dark, rough, and sick-complexioned. Her hair is thin and matted, and her  disposition is restless and bellicose. She wears soiled clothes and rides a chariot  with a banner displaying a crow. She is seen as an incarnation of all that is sordid,  antisocial, and inauspicious in women, an antithesis of the goddess Sri. She is  depicted as a widow, who has allegedly gobbled up her husband Siva in a fit of  hunger. She was born from the smoking fire of the destruction of Daksa&rsquo;s sacrifice  and the death of Sati. Frowning, she howls desolately and carries a winnowing  fan. Laksmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka Tantra (24.9-14),  states that Dhumavati is the same goddess as Jyesthya.</p>
<p>The last two Mahavidyas are again familiar to the Lalita cult. Matangi is the  same as Syamala in that cult. She is mainly considered to be the deity presiding  over such fine arts as the power to compose poetry. She is exquisitely beautiful  and is dark complexioned, but otherwise closely resembles Lalita in appearance  (PkS 6.1-39). The tenth Mahavidya is goddess Laksmi alias Sri alias Kamala,  the spouse of Visnu - although she too is closely related to the mantra of  Tripurasundari.</p>
<p>Tantric Esoteric Practice</p>
<p>The Todala Tantra belongs to the corpus of Tantric scriptures that make up the  Mantra marga or Mantra path. The term Mantra marga means the entire Tantric  paradigm of ritual worship and meditation. Every mantra possesses a paradig matical ritual system of its own, a pattern that has become more or less fixed,  with variations to fit the relevant mantra and its deity, as well as the performer&rsquo;s  intended application (Gupta, Hoens, and Goudriaan 1979: 121-57). Mantra marga is followed by Tantric practitioners for two broadly defined purposes: lib eration from the bondage of endless transmigration (samsara), or rewards such  as supernatural power and achievements - mukti and bhukti respectively. The  Todala Tantra is more concerned with mukti and hence does not deal with the  esoteric worship of any Mahavidyas other than the first three: Kali, Tara, and  Sundari (or Bhuvanesvari). Seekers of mukti are more respected than seekers of  power and achievement, although the latter are held in awe and are much sought  after by lay devotees for personal gain, such as protection from disease and mis fortune, and destroying enemies.</p>
<p>The four important constituents in such esoteric Tantric worship are the pre liminaries, invocation, ritual service, and conclusion.</p>
<p>Preliminaries. First, the divine is represented by esoteric formulas, hand gestures  (mudras), symbols of the deity worshiped mainly on a diagram (yantra), and</p>
<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 47 3</p>
<p>sometimes an image and a pitcher full of water. Second, the practitioner (sadhaka)  must have been properly initiated by a competent sectarian guru. Third, the wor shiper, the symbol of the deity, and the objects used for offering must be physi cally and mystically purified. Fourth is the ritual of security. Tantric esoteric  practices are considered to be full of dangers. Often they are personified as harm ful spirits that obstruct the worshiper&rsquo;s every movement. Therefore the worshiper  must take measures to remove these spirits from the sacred area of the ritual  worship, by making threatening sounds; by stamping one&rsquo;s foot, clapping, or  snapping one&rsquo;s fingers; by frowning and looking angry, and scattering threatening  objects such as white mustard seeds; by making threatening gestures imitating  shooting, and so forth. The fifth, and perhaps the most important, preliminary  rite is called nyasa. This means the installation, limb by limb, of the sacred man tras, which are the sonic manifestation of the divine, onto the material body of  the worshiper, thus replacing the mundane body of the worshiper with a sacred  body. The same installation is performed onto the deity&rsquo;s symbol for the same  purpose.</p>
<p>Invocation. The goddess is invoked, first into the center or heart of the worshiper,  and thence onto the seat he has ritually prepared for her adoration.</p>
<p>Ritual Service. The deity is first adored in meditative imagination, in which all  the objects of offering are of an abstract nature. Next, the Tantric practitioner  worships the Goddess with various objects of material enjoyment. This is followed  by the service of the Goddess&rsquo;s spouse, Siva, and then her entourage, the minor  gods and goddesses encircling her. This is followed by the offering (ball), which  in the Mahavidya cult almost always implies an animal sacrifice, that is, beheading  an animal in front of the image. The animal offering is followed by a fire sacrifice.  Then a short meditation is done by means of repeating the main mantra a certain  number of times (japa). The ritual offerings culminate, for the followers of the  vamacara, with the offerings of the five objects (meat, fish, etc.). Finally, the  worshiper offers the deity all the merit he has accrued from performing the service.  He also offers himself to the goddess. These last two ritual acts refer to two very  important concepts: renunciation and loyal devotion. The first requires an utter  annihilation of one&rsquo;s ego and greed. Even the greed for accumulating merit for  the ego-person must be destroyed. The second is rooted in the concept of bhakti,  which came to mean total surrender to one&rsquo;s adored deity. The devotee offers all  that belongs to himself and then offers his individuality as well.</p>
<p>Conclusion. Having invoked a fierce manifestation of the Goddess and worshiped  it with some parts of the already offered objects for his own success and that of  his ritual service, the worshiper recites certain set formulas for his physical well being, and then recites hymns to the Goddess. Having partaken of a little of the  offered food as the Goddess&rsquo;s grace, the worshiper has fulfilled his daily obligatory  ritual service of his Goddess and is free to follow his normal way of life.474 SANJUKTA GUPTA</p>
<p>Tantra Ritual Practice</p>
<p>The Todala Tantra does not discuss Tantric initiation, and indeed, it does not  discuss any theological concepts at all. It starts by describing the procedure for  the ritual worship of Kali. The first ritual act is to worship one&rsquo;s guru mentally.  The guru is identified with the supreme deity Kali when she is united with Siva  immediately prior to creation. This text is meant for experienced Tantric practi</p>
<p>tioners who are versed in the Tantric meditation on the kundalini, the contracted  and inert form of the creatrix goddess Kali as she remains immanent in every  creature (Eliade 1969: 200-67). The aim of Tantric meditation is to arouse the  kundalini by means of breath control (pranayama) and one-pointed meditation  (dhyana) on the practitioner&rsquo;s deity, who when awakened longs to unite with Siva  and swiftly flies upward through the innermost passage of the practitioner&rsquo;s yogic  body, which contains six spiritual centers. At the top of this passage, just above  the practitioner&rsquo;s body, the creating Goddess is united with Siva, and this divine  area, transcending the creation at a point prior to creation, is imagined as a sphere  or a lotus with countless petals (sahasrara cakra). This united yet differentiated  stance of the supreme Goddess and Siva is what the Tantric practitioner endeavors  to understand and identify with. This is liberation because it transcends creation.  The practitioner&rsquo;s guru is already liberated and is thus one with this two-in-one  divinity. Even before the practioner actually leaves his bed, he performs the kun dalinl meditation on his guru while repeating his name, declaring his total sub mission to him. Only then does he start his daily obligatory ritual acts (Gupta  1979: 130-39).</p>
<p>Bhutasuddhi</p>
<p>The next important ritual is the purification of the practitioner&rsquo;s material body,  which is composed of five cosmic elements (bhutasuddhi). This is again a form of  meditation: the practitioner meditates on each of the five ontological elements,  starting with the element of solidity/earth and ending with ether/undefined space.  He eliminates each element by dissolving it into the element preceding it. Thus  in his imagination he contracts the entire differentiated creation in its microcosmic  form, arriving at the center of the countless-petaled lotus circle, where the energy  of the Goddess burns away the impurities of his microcosm, eliminating any  residual elements. Saturated and rejuvenated by the nectar produced by the coitus  of the divine couple, the microcosm is recreated, pure and consubstantial with  the divine. The import of such daily meditative rites as bhutasuddhi is to repeat  the process of internalizing the theological explanation of salvation as a direct  experience of one&rsquo;s true identity with vidya, nondual pure awareness, which in  turn is but the supreme goddess Kali in her transcendental form.</p>
<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 475  Mantra and Nyasa</p>
<p>After this renewed confirmation of his consubstantiality with Kali, the practitioner  can replace his purified mundane body with the divine personality, that is, vidya,  through the rite of nyasa. In this rite the mantras and their sonic source (matrka),  the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, are the most important concepts. Mantras are  the sonic forms of their deities, just as the images are their visual forms. The  mantras of Kali and Tara are therefore considered to be the mantra bodies of these  two goddesses. The Todala Tantra explains the concept of the Goddess&rsquo;s mantra  physique in its sixth chapter. It is a Tantric custom to analyze the mantra of a  deity into several components. The most important part is the seed or bija mantra.  Mahavidyas like Kali or Tara have several such seeds, one of which is considered  to be chief. The seed is the essence of a mantra. After the seed(s) comes the name  of the deity. As the complete mantra is a sentence, the name is either inflected as  a vocative, or is declined in the dative when it is followed by the term namas,  which means &ldquo;obeisance.&rdquo; Conventionally, formulas known as vidyas are consid ered to be of feminine gender, which requires them to end in svaha. But in the  case of the mantras found in the Todala Tantra, several seed mantras are often  inserted before the word svaha. It is interesting to note that this word is used for  offering Vedic oblations, and is mythologized as the name of the fire god Agni&rsquo;s  spouse. However, a practitioner receives his personal esoteric mantra from his  guru who, knowing the initiate&rsquo;s special disposition, chooses a specific variant of  his chosen deity. This then becomes the initiated practitioner&rsquo;s main or mula  mantra. The main mantra, which is considered the full physical form of its deity,  is divided into six main limbs (angas). These are the heart, the head, the tuft of  hair, the eyes, the weapon, and the armored torso. These six limbs symbolize the  deity&rsquo;s entire body. In the rite of nyasa the worshiper first invests his hands and  fingers with sacred formulas and then invests his six limbs with the same parts  of his main mantra. Because the supreme goddess is Vac, Speech, the worshiper  uses the matrka mantra for some specific nyasa, since that is the Goddess&rsquo;s pri mordial manifestation. In the worship of Kali, matrka nyasa is performed in six  different ways.</p>
<p>Mudra</p>
<p>Mudra has more than one meaning. Its primary meaning is &ldquo;seal,&rdquo; but in Tantric  terminology, mudra means a hand gesture or a posture of seated meditation (usu ally called asana), and in the context of the five esoteric ingredients of offerings  to the Goddess, it may either mean a female partner for ritual practice or just a  snack. There are many uses of mudras or hand gestures as the practitioner pro ceeds mentally to encounter divine and spiritual beings in his rituals. All actions  at this stage are accompanied by miming, and often they are so graphic that it is  easy to understand their meaning. For instance, for the dhyana or envisaging of</p>
<p>476 SANJUKT A GUPT A</p>
<p>the deity, the worshiper utters the deity&rsquo;s mantra of her iconography while acting  out in gestures the deity&rsquo;s special attributes. Thus, while uttering Kalika&rsquo;s dhyana  mantra - &ldquo;Om, you seated on a corpse, of fierce appearance with terrifying teeth,  who bestows desired objects [on her devotees], who laughs [all the time], who  has three eyes, holds in her hands a skull and a sword, whose hair is untied and  tongue is lolling out incessantly drinking the blood [of the asuras]. One should  envisage you, O Goddess, [as] having four arms whose other two hands gesture  fulfilment of the devotee&rsquo;s wishes and who promises protection&rdquo; - the adept ges tures with his fingers, graphically symbolizing the attributes described in that  mantra. These are called the yoni, bhutini, vara, abhaya, khadga, and munda  mudras (see Figure 27.1).</p>
<p>The Devanagari edition of the Todala Tantra was published in 1970, in Tantra sarngraha part 2, edited by Gopinath Kaviraj from the Yoga-Tantra department of  Benares Sankrit University, Varanasi. There are several Bengali published editions,  as well. The edition I have used is Todala Tantra, edited, translated, and com mented on in Bengali by Pancanana Sastri (Calcutta: Navabharata Publications,  1976).</p>

<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 479</p>
<p>12cd-13cd. One should worship Siva as a headless trunk (kabandha) by the  right side of Chinnamasta [the Beheaded Goddess]. He who does tantric ritual  worship of Kabandha [Siva] certainly becomes the lord of all tantric perfection  (siddhi). Dhumavati, the great Vidya, is manifest in the form of a widow [hence  there is no form of Siva by her side].</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>
<p>The one-faced great Rudra (the Fierce One) is worshiped by the right hand  side of Bagala. He is famed as the annihilator [performing the contraction] of  the creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Matahgi&rsquo;s right side one should worship Matahga Siva. He indeed is the  Daksinamurti who is in the form of universal bliss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[A worshiper (sadhaka)] should worship Sadasiva in the form of Visnu by  Kamala&rsquo;s right side. O great sovereign Goddess, there is no doubt that he would  achieve perfection (siddhi).</p>
</li>

<p>Explanation of Siva&rsquo;s Transformation into a Corpse</p>
<p>Who Nonetheless Has Sexual Union with the Goddess</p>
<p>The blessed Goddess asked:</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>The [great Sakti] who is the first great Vidya and also the second supreme  Bhairavi who is the mother of the three worlds and is eternal - how can she  be mounted on a corpse?</li>
</ol>
<p>The blessed Siva answered:</p>
<p>21-23. O great Goddess! she who is the primordial [divine being], herself  Death/Time, exists [identified] as the heart [essence] of the glorious Siva in  the form of the destroyer. Therefore the supreme Death/Time (Mahakala) is  the destroyer of the universe. But when Kali as the embodiment of destruction  manifests herself in her true form, immediately at that very moment, O God</p>
<p>dess, Sadasiva appears in the form of a corpse and at that instant, O Lady with  dancing eyes, she [Kali] appears mounted on a corpse.</p>
<p>480 SANJUKTA GUPTA  The blessed Goddess said:</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>The great god Sadasiva as a corpse is a lifeless body. How could it then  perform the sex act?</li>
</ol>
<p>The blessed Siva answered:</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>At the time that great Kali [actively] manifests herself, Sadasiva is devoid  of active power. When, O Goddess, he is united with sakti, then he appears in  the form of Siva; [but though] when devoid of sakti he is virtually a corpse,  he still does not lose his manliness [his phallus].</li>

<p>End of the first chapter, called a dialogue between Hara and Gauri,  of the most excellent of all Tantras, the Todala-tantra</p>
<p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
<p>Brief Enumeration of Kundalini Yoga</p>
<p>The blessed Siva said:</p>
<p>1-4. Listen O Goddess! 1 shall briefly recount the essence of yoga [meditation  and Tantric mental adoration].</p>
<p>The [human] body is like a tree [in reverse form] whose roots are on top  and branches hanging beneath. All the sacred places of the universe exist within  this body. The very form of the macrocosm exists in the microcosm [of the  human body]. There are thirty and a half million sacred places in the macro</p>
<p>cosm, O You who are praised by the heroes [Tantric practitioners]! Out of all  of these, only a hundred and forty thousand sacred places are visible. Out of  these, only fourteen [are noteworthy], and out of these [fourteen], only three  are auspicious. Amongst these [three again], O supreme sovereign Goddess,  [the one called] Mahadhira bestows liberation (mukti).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Vasuki [the divine serpent] is indeed Mahamaya [the cosmic goddess of  delusion], who is manifest in the form of a serpent, coiled three and a half  times, and resides in the region under the nether region (patala).</li>
</ol>
<p>6-8. O supreme sovereign Goddess, listen carefully while I recount the seven  heavens [upper regions] in their proper order. [These are] the region of the  earth, of the atmosphere, of the celestials, then the region of maha [of the great  saints], the region of jana [generation], the region of tapa [austerity] and, O  Lady with an elegant face, the region of satya [truth]. Here ends the list of  seven regions. O eminent lady! now listen carefully to the enumeration of the  nether regions. [These are the regions of] atala, vitala, sutala, talatala, mahatala,  patala, and after that rasatala.</p>
<p>9-17ab. The liberating [yogic duct, called nadi] Mahadhira ranges from ras atala to the end of satya, which exists inside the central [channel, that is, the</p>
<p>WORSHI P OF KALI 481</p>
<p>spinal column, meru]. Mahavisnu Siva resides in the satya region and Vasuki  is full of intense longing to meet him. When Vasuki, having pierced the six  regions (cakras), rises up [to that region of satya], all the other flowing rivers  [that is, the ducts] become upward flowing. In the body [the microcosm], O  sovereign Goddess, the ducts remain in the following order. If [the sadhaka]  presses down air through both the ida and pingala ducts, which have the sus umna between them, O sovereign Goddess, while repeating the prana mantra  [so&rsquo;ham], then the coiled one [Vasuki] starts [moving upward through the  susumna] following the order of the [six cakras], until she approaches the  eternal and immutable lotus [the sahasrara cakra]. With anxiety the coiled one  enters that eternal abode. Simultaneously all other down-flowing [ducts] start  flowing upstream. At that moment, O Goddess! [the sadhaka] should concen</p>
<p>trate on the garland of letters. Then while repeating mentally 108 times his  chief (mula) mantra [received from his preceptor at the time of initiation] the  intelligent [sadhaka] should bring the coiled one back to his muladhara cakra  [her original resting-place] in the same way, while refreshing the gods of the  six cakras with the nectar [from the thousand-petaled lotus].</p>
<p>Yogic Mudras, or Special Physical Positions for Kundalini Yoga</p>
<p>17cd-22ab. Now, my dear, I shall describe another yoga posture called the  yonimudra [the previous one was called sakti-calanl].</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner first sits down on his seat facing the east or the  north. With his arms he firmly holds his two knees and then, O Queen of the  gods, he brings his nose near the knees while sitting upright [that is, keeping  his back straight]. O Queen of the gods, [as before] he presses air down by  inhaling (but, O great Goddess! does not let the air escape by exhaling), and  simultaneously continues repeating the prana mantra. At the same time, as  described before, he should repeat [his chief mantra] 108 times in his upright  pose, [only this time ] he repeats [the mantra ] in reverse order. While thus  [repeating his mantra], O You of glorious face, he brings [the kundalini] back  to the basic root cakra [muladhara] through the same path while refreshing  the gods of the six cakras with nectar.</p>
<p>22cd-25. My dear, this yonimudra removes all illness. O Goddess, without  elaborating I can just say that it destroys great diseases and, O Goddess, without  exaggerating I can say that this mudra causes the realization of the mantra,  brings about the direct perception of one&rsquo;s [true] self, and bestows on the  practitioner the great liberation, mahamoksa. Had I possessed a hundred faces  I would not have been able to exhaust all its details; but with only five faces  how much can I enumerate? A Tantric practitioner practicing this mudra be</p>
<p>comes as beautiful as Cupid even if he began as a leper.</p>
<p>Here ends the second chapter of the Siva-Parvati dialogue</p>
<p>in the Todala Tantra which is the best of all Tantras</p>
<p>4 8 2 SANJUKTA GUPTA</p>
<p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
<p>The blessed goddess asked:</p>
<ol>
<li>0 God of gods, great God, the saver from the ocean of transient and recur ring life [samsara], O Ocean of compassion, please tell me the great mudra  called baddhayoni.</li>
</ol>
<p>Siva answered:</p>
<p>2-4ab. Listen, O Goddess, I shall briefly tell you the method of baddhayoni.  O great Goddess, the mantra practitioner covers his anus with the tip of his  penis. Then, O great Goddess, the intelligent practitioner gradually applies his  fingers [to cover other apertures of his body] starting with the thumbs, to  [cover] his ears, [and then in turn [covering his] eyes, nose, and mouth [with  rest of the pairs of fingers of his hands].</p>
<p>4cd-7 . [Thus covering all his bodily apertures] he should then inhale through  his nose and fill his mouth with air and as before press it downward [through  the ida and pihgala ducts]. When [the coiled goddess unites with Siva] the  practitioner should envisage the primaeval Sound (sabda-brahman) and then  envisage the garland of syllables (varnamala) while repeating his main mantra.  Then, repeating the mantra so&rsquo;ham, he brings, O Goddess, [the kundalini back  to the muladhara cakra] through the same central channel. On the way he  refreshes all the cakra gods [with the nectar produced by the union of the  goddess and Sadasiva]. O great sovereign Goddess! O spotless One! I shall tell  you [later] the achievements of one who peforms this [kundalini yoga seated  in baddhayoni posture].</p>
<p>Kali&rsquo;s Mantra or Vidya</p>
<p>The blessed Parvati asked:</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>O omniscient Isana! O most excellent of the erudite, who possesses all  wisdom! O master of gods! please tell me the rare description of Kalika&rsquo;s mantra  system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bija [Seed] Mantra.</p>
<p>The blessed Siva answered:</p>
<p>9-13 . O ever-blissful Goddess, listen to my account of the excellent Kalika  mantra; even the mere discussion of its nature makes a man liberated in this  life. For the first [seed mantra], cull the syllable ka, add to it i, r, and the  bindunada [double nasalization, symbolized by a sickle shape topped by a point  representing the normal nasalization]. O auspicious One! this is the very rare  perfect vidya, the queen of all vidyas.</p>
<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 483  The Vidya</p>
<p>Now listen to me explaining the next one. First utter this seed [mantra krim]  three times. Then cull the syllable ha connected with the nasal bindu and the  vowel u [hum], [and utter] it twice [after the first three]; and now I tell you  the next one [that is the third seed mantra]. Then, O sovereign Goddess [utter  the syllable ha joined with r, i, and the nasal, and repeat it again [hrim hrim ];  then add [Kalika&rsquo;s ] vocative, then again three of the first seed mantra, then  twice the kurca mantra [hum] and twice the maya mantra [hrim] and finally  svaha. This mantra of twenty-five syllables is the queen of all vidyas and is very  rare.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>When this great vidya is preceded by the vagbhava mantra [aim, the  seed mantra of the supreme speech, Vac], its inherent deity is Srikali; when  preceded by the pranava mantra [Om], its deity is known as Siddhikalika.</li>
</ol>
<p>15-16. When the mantra consists of two of the goddess&rsquo;s own mantras [krim]  followed by one kurca mantra [hum], O great Goddess, this trisyllabic supreme  vidya is known as Camundakalika. There is no vidya like this one for bringing  about success. The six-syllabled vidya [krim krim krim phat svaha] and the  three-syllabled vidya [krim krim hum] are of equal power.</p>
<p>17-18ab. O auspicious one! three of [Kalika&rsquo;s] own seed mantra [krim krim  krim] followed by the [vocative] smasanakalike, then again the three seed man tras and finally svaha, [together] constitute the fourteen-syllabled mantra that  is worshiped in all the three worlds.</p>
<p>Eight Forms of the Kail Vidya</p>
<p>18cd-21ab. Daksinakalika, Siddhikalika, Guhyakalika, Srlkalika, Bhadrakali,  Camundakalika, and the supreme Smasanakalika and Mahakali, O Goddess!  These are the eight [forms of goddess Kali]. O sovereign Goddess! First utter  Kali&rsquo;s own seed mantra, then her name in the vocative followed by another  Kalika seed mantra, and finally add svaha [krim kalike krim svaha]. These eight  forms of Kalika&rsquo;s mantra are secretly expressed in all Tantras.</p>
<p>The blessed Goddess said:</p>
<p>21cd-23ab. I have [now] heard the very secret mantras of the great Kalika.  Now I wish to hear Tara&rsquo;s royal mantra. O ISana! if you love me do tell me her  mantra, whose mere mention prevents one from drowning in the ocean of  [transitory] existence.</p>
<p>Tara Bijas</p>
<p>Sri Siva answered:</p>
<p>484 SANJUKTA GUPTA</p>
<p>Having uttered the moon seed [sam] add the syllable of fire [r] and t to it, to gether with the left eye [i]. My beloved, this royal mantra, this single-syllabled  vidya [strim] is venerated in three worlds, liana [h] united with the nasal and  the left ear [u] [forms] the monosyllabic vidya [hum], which is [Tara&rsquo;s] second  royal mantra.</p>
<p>The Tara Vidya</p>
<p>23cd-32ab. Siva [h] with the fire [r] and the left eye [i] and the nasal added  to it [hrim] [should first be uttered]. Then the first seed [strim] and then the  second [hum], then utter the weapon, astra mantra [hrim strim hum phat].</p>
<p>Different Forms and Efficacies of the Tara Vidya</p>
<p>When this vidya is preceded by pranava [Om], then [the Goddess] is called  Ugratara. When without the pranava this vidya is called Ekajata, the bestower  of supreme liberation (moksa). With neither pranava nor astra mantra [that is,  hrim strim hum], this trisyllabic vidya is called Mahanilasarasvati. When the  [trisyllabic] vidya is preceded by the vagbhava [seed mantra], it bestows [on  the practitioner] the status of the god of speech. This supreme vidya when  preceded by the seed mantra srim bestows wealth and prosperity. When this  great vidya is preceded by the seed mantra maya [hrim], it bestows sure success  and perfection (siddhi). When it is preceded by the kurca [hum], it reveals the  entire system of speech. When this supreme vidya is preceded by the seed of  the sky [ham], it bestows the liberation of total resorption. When this geat  vidya starts with the prasada [seed mantra, haum] it brings about the union of  the practitioner with Siva. When this mantra starts with the seed [mantra] of  prana [prum] it bestows on the practitioner the fulfilment of whatever he  wishes. When this supreme vidya opens with the seed of Kali [krim] it bestows  both liberation and prosperity.</p>
<p>Ritual Worship of the Deity</p>
<p>32cd-50abc. Now 1 shall describe the method of worshiping Kali and Tara.  Arising in the morning, the practitioner who knows his mantra [and its method  of meditation] first mentally worships his guru in the topmost cakra consisting  of a thousand petals. Then, having pierced the six cakras, he should repeat his  main mantra 108 times. Thereafter, having bowed down [to his preferred deity]  he should perform his ritual bathing. He should start this bathing ritual with  the following declaration of his intention (samkalpa): &ldquo;Today [here he men tions the day and date and then] the solar month, [I bathe myself] for the  pleasure of the deity.&rdquo; Then he bathes in the pure water.</p>
<p>Then he should utter Om and then gange ca, followed by yamune, then  having uttered godavari, sarasvati, narmade and sindhu kaveri he utters the  words asmin jale sannidhim kuru [Om the rivers Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari,  Sarasvati, Narmada, Sindhu, and Kaveri please abide in this water]. [While  uttering this mantra the practitioner] with the hand gesture called the goad</p>
<p>WORSHIP OF KALI 48 5</p>
<p>(ankusa) should [in imagination] pull these sacred rivers from the orb of the  sun and settle them [in the water in which he is bathing] by carefully showing  four relevant hand gestures. Then having protected the water with the hand  gesture called the fish [and scooping a palmful of water and covering it with  the other palm], the worshiper repeats his [deity&rsquo;s seed] mantra [krim] eleven  times. Then, throwing this water toward the sun, he should repeat his main  mantra twelve times while [in imagination] washing [Kalika&rsquo;s] feet three times.  Then [in imagination] he should three times bathe himself with that rinse water  flowing from [Kali&rsquo;s] feet while repeating the mantra. This is done by showing  the gesture of the water pot (kumbha) while repeating his main mantra three  times.</p>
<p>Then, O Queen of gods! he should decorate his forehead according to the  custom of his sect. Then he performs acamana [ritual cleansing of his mouth  and hands] with water while uttering the mantras of the three tattvas - at matattva, vidyatattva, and sivatattva. The mantras consist of each tattva pre ceded by pranava and ending with svaha [this is the name of the wife of the  god Agni, Fire].</p>
<p>[At this point he has left his bathing place, cleanly and decorously attired,  and reached the actual place of worship, carrying a pitcher full of water brought  from the water source. In this water pitcher] he invokes the sacred rivers with  the same gauge ca, etc., mantra [following the aforesaid procedure]. Then he  dips a bunch of kusa grass into the sanctified water and with it sprinkles water  on the ground [where he will hold his ritual worship]. Then in the same way  he should sprinkle himself seven times. Then he performs his anganyasa. Then,  O Goddess of the celestials, he with his left hand [scoops up water] and repeats  three times the [paficabhuta] bija mantras: ham, Mam,yam, lam and ram. Having  thus encapsulated that water with that pancabhuta mantra, the practitioner  should sprinkle himself seven times with his finger in the gesture of tattva  [reality] while uttering his main mantra. This act at once removes all his sins.</p>
<p>Then, O great sovereign Queen, the adept transfers the rest of the water from  his left hand to his right and in imagination inhales it through his ida duct  [inside his left nostril], which water then cleanses his inner body. Thereafter,  he should exhale that water through his pingala duct [inside his right nostril].  Here he imagines that water to be black and the embodiment of sins; he im</p>
<p>mediately throws the water onto a slab of rock with the mantra phat. Then he  should wash his hands, perform acamana and, having performed breath con trol, offer libation to his lineage god and then offer arghya [an offering of a  few rice grains, tips of durva grass and sanctified water] to the Sun god and  arghya to his chosen deity.</p>
<p>50d-53. Thereafter he should repeat the great words of the [Kalika] gayatri  [the famous Vedic mantra with which brahmans worship the Sun every day,  as follows]: first one should take the pranava [Om], then utter kalikayai, then  vidmahe; then smasanavasinyai dhimahi, then tan no ghore pracodayat. While486 SANJUKT A GUPT A</p>
<p>uttering this mantra, the worshiper should three times scatter the consecrated  water upward.</p>
<p>54ab. Then, O great Goddess, having performed anganyasa the worshiper  again performs acamana.</p>
<p>Tara&rsquo;s Gayatri is Described with a Brief Mention</p>
<p>of the Deity&rsquo;s Dhyana as the Sun Deity</p>
<p>54cd-56ab. O great Goddess! Having envisaged in meditation one&rsquo;s chosen  deity [here Tara] in the orb of the sun, one should utter Om tarayai vidmahe  mahograyai dhimahi tan no devi pracodayat. Then, having performed breath  control, he should repeat this mantra 108 times.</p>
<p>Now, O Queen of gods, I offer in the form of aphorisms (sirtrakara) an  account of the system of worship</p>
<p>Preliminaries</p>
<p>56cd-58. First proclaim universal well-being (svasti-vacana), then the an nouncement of one&rsquo;s intention to worship (samkalpa). Next, one should care fully place the pitcher [full of consecrated water], followed by the act of aca mana with mantras; next comes the setting the pitcher of water for arghya for</p>
<p>general purposes; then sprinkling the entrance [with consecrated water for  purification], finishing that ritual by worshiping the entrance. Then, having  removed the three categories of hindrances [concretized as evil spirits, belong ing to the ground, atmosphere, and close to the body of the worshipper and  the material objects around him gathered for the ritual] he removes [other evil]  spirits [with mantras, sprinkling of water and threatening gestures].</p>
<p>Starting the Actual Worship</p>
<p>59-60ab. Having adored the seat, the intelligent worshiper first of all bows  down to his guru. Then he purifies his hands, claps them three times, and then  performs the rite of consolidating and safeguarding the area surrounding his  person (digbandhana). Then he encompasses himself with fire. Then he per</p>
<p>forms bhutasuddhi.</p>
<p>Nyasa</p>
<p>60cd-64ab. He should then first perform the nyasa of the six limbs of the  matrka [the full Sanskrit alphabet], then the nyasa of the matrka on his inner  body. Then he utters the dhyana mantra [the mantra that gives the deity&rsquo;s  iconography] of the matrka. He should perform the same nyasa on his external  body. Then he performs the nyasa of the seat of the deity (pitha) before com</p>
<p>pleting his breath control. Then he performs the nyasa of the sage, and so on  [the sage poet, the meter, and the deity of his mantra]. Then he performs nyasa  of his hands and his limbs [identifying them with] the letters of the Sanskrit  alphabet. Then he performs the six types of nyasa [of his main mantra]. Then</p>
<p>WORSHI P OF KALI 487</p>
<p>he performs vyapaka [extended] nyasa. With concentration he performs the  nyasa of the tattvas; then, O Goddess!, he performs the nyasa of the seed  mantra. He performs the vyapaka nyasa in seven different ways using his main  mantra. Then in deep concentration he visualizes his deity, whereafter he wor</p>
<p>ships that deity mentally [with imagined ingredients].</p>
<p>Adoration of the Deity</p>
<p>64cd-68ab. [The adept] prepares the consecrated special liquid for special  argyha. Then he worships [the deity&rsquo;s] seat. Next he again performs the visu alization of the deity in deep meditation (dhyana) and this time he sees her  with her eyes open. [All the time he utters specific mantras and appropriate  gestures to accompany his ritual acts.] Then he in similar manner welcomes  the deity. Then while purifying all objects of offering he shows the gestures of  the cow&rsquo;s udder, and so on. [These are called the dhenu mudra, the symbol  for the celestial cow whose milk is nectar; the avagunthana mudra, which  symbolizes safety and cover; the galini mudra which symbolizes the fusing of  the sacred and the mundane water; and the naraca mudra, which symbolizes  iron arrowheads to ward off any polluting evil spirits]. Then he performs the  nyasa of the deity&rsquo;s six limbs. Then he performs the rite of establishing life [in  the image or other representation of the deity]. Then he worships [with offer</p>
<p>ings] his principal mantra and its deity, the Goddess. Then he requests the  Goddess to authorize him [to exercise the power of the mantra]. Then he  worships the deity&rsquo;s attendant deities like Kali, and so on. [They are Kali,  Kapalini, Kulla, Kurukulla, Virodhini, Vipracitta, Ugra, Ugraprabha, and Dipta.  The second circle of her assistants consists of Nila, Ghana, and Valaka, and the  third circle consists of Matra, Mudra, and Mita]. Then he worships her atten</p>
<p>dant mother-goddesses Brahmi, and so on, and their Bhairavas, Asitahga, and  so on. [They are Brahmi, Vaisnavi, Mahesvari, Camunda, Kaumari, Aparajita,  Varahi, and Narasimhi; and Asitahga, Ruru, Canda, Krodha, Unmatta, Kapali,  Bhisana and Samhara.]. Then he worships [the deity&rsquo;s consort] Mahakala. Then  he worships the Goddess&rsquo;s [weapons, that is,] her sword, and so on. Next he  worships the lineage of his guru. Then the ritualist repeats the worship of Kali.  This is followed by the offering of bali [a sacrificial animal, or in some cases  nonvegetarian food for the spirits]. This is followed by the fire sacrifice. Then,  having performed pranayama [as a preparation for japa], he performs mantra  repetition (japa) of his main mantra [which is a form of one-pointed medita tion]. Finally, the intelligent worshiper dedicates the merit of his japa to the  deity and then performs pranayama for a second time.</p>
<p>Esoteric Worship of the Goddess with Alcohol and Other Ingredients</p>
<p>68cd. At this moment the worshiper may, O Goddess, collect [esoteric ingre dients such as] alcohol [meat, fish, fried food/a partner for intercourse, and  the sexual fluids].</p>
<p>4 8 8 - SANJUKTA GUPTA  Concluding Section of the Worship</p>
<p>69-71 . Afterward, the worshiper offers the deity arghya and also dedicates  himself to the Goddess. Then he recites the Goddess&rsquo;s eulogy and then recites  her protective kavaca [&ldquo;armor,&rdquo; a special hymn used as a mantra, which guards  every part of the worshiper&rsquo;s body]. Finally he prostrates himself. Afterward  he mentally utters the formula, &ldquo;I am Siva,&rdquo; while making the gesture of bidding  her farewell. He then draws a diagram on the southwestern corner and offers  arghya and other offerings to the goddess Ucchistacandali. He then himself  puts a mark on his forehead with the sandal paste offered to the Goddess and  partakes of some of the offered food. Thereafter he can do whatever he wishes.</p>
<p>Alternative Brief Ritual</p>
<p>Alternatively, the initiated Tantric ritualist who has composed and fixed his  mind in devotion and meditation may perform a shortened version of the wor ship.</p>
<p>First he performs the nyasa of the poet-sage, and so on, of his main mantra;  then he purifies his hands [with nyasa] followed by nyasa of his fingers and  the extensive nyasa of his body. Then he performs the nyasa of his six limbs.  Then he claps his hands three times [to remove obstructing spirits], then en</p>
<p>circles his surroundings with [a fiery barrier]. Then he performs breath control  followed by dhyana on his mantra deity and then mentally performs her wor ship. Then he prepares and places the pitcher of arghya water, and worships  the seat [of the Goddess]. On that he invokes the Goddess after having med itated on her image. Then he performs her ritual welcome, and so forth, fol lowed by establishing life in her symbol, jivanyasa or pranapratistha, and finally  worships the supreme Goddess. Then he worships the attendant deities Kali,  and so on, as well as the eight Saktis, Brahmi, and so on, along with their  bhairavas. Then having worshiped Mahakala he worships his guru&rsquo;s lineage as  well as the Goddess&rsquo;s attributes and weapons such as the sword. This is fol lowed by a repeat of the worship of the Goddess. Then the foremost of all  worshipers practices breath control before performing his japa. He dedicates  the [merit of his] japa to the Goddess&rsquo;s hand. He performs the concluding  breath control, prostrates himself, recites the Goddess&rsquo;s panegyric and kavaca  and causes the special arghya to be offered. He then dedicates himself [to the  Goddess] and bids her farewell with the gesture of resorption. He draws a  diagram on his southwestern side and worships Ucchistacandali. In conclusion,  he partakes of some of the offered food and then he may do as he pleases.</p>
