The “Anubhava-nivedana-stotra” or the “Song of Praise Intended to Communicate the Direct Experience of the Absolute” is a poetic composition in Sanskrit attrib uted to the eleventh-century Kashmiri Tantric master, Abhinavagupta. It is one of but a handful of short poetic works or hymns of praise (stotras) attributed to this important Tantric philosopher and theologian. Probably written toward the end of his life as a kind of elegant summary of the author’s vision of Saiva mys ticism, the poem is an evocation of the experience of the ultimate consciousness">

  <p>by Abhinavagupta</p>
<p>Paul E. Muller-Ortega</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Anubhava-nivedana-stotra&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Song of Praise Intended to Communicate  the Direct Experience of the Absolute&rdquo; is a poetic composition in Sanskrit attrib uted to the eleventh-century Kashmiri Tantric master, Abhinavagupta. It is one  of but a handful of short poetic works or hymns of praise (stotras) attributed to  this important Tantric philosopher and theologian. Probably written toward the  end of his life as a kind of elegant summary of the author&rsquo;s vision of Saiva mys ticism, the poem is an evocation of the experience of the ultimate consciousness</p>
<p>known as Siva, the achievement of the highest goal of Saiva Yoga.  In the religious and spiritual literature of Hinduism, stotra is a well-known  compositional category that is quite varied in its form. It generally denotes a  eulogistic hymn of praise directed at a particular object that the author wishes to  praise. Any number of stotras of varying length, meter, and style were composed  in praise of deities, religious teachers and reformers, and many diverse holy ob jects of veneration.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Anubhava-nivedana-stotra&rdquo; is unusual in that it was written not so much  in praise of a deity as in praise of this Tantric author&rsquo;s own state of achieved  mystical illumination. It might be said that the poem forms a conceptual window  through which the author, a great master of medieval Tantric Saivism, allows the  reader to peer into this state of mystical illumination. Although a complex phil</p>
<p>osophical theology lies in the background of all that the author says, nevertheless  the poem evokes a simplicity beyond all of the philosophical and ritual complexity  that encompass it: the Tantric master&rsquo;s direct adoration of the unity of the absolute  consciousness called Siva.</p>
<p>Abhinavagupta accomplishes this, in part, by centering his poem on the so called sambhavl mudra, here rendered as the &ldquo;seal of Sambhu&rdquo;: a sophisticated  formulation of the highest stance of the Saivite yogin&rsquo;s achievement of mystical  illumination (verse 1). Sambhu (&ldquo;producing happiness&rdquo;) is a name for Siva, also</p>
<p>574 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEGA</p>
<p>known as Mahadeva, the great god of medieval Tantric Saivism. Although a per sonal theistic reference is not excluded, in this case Siva primarily denotes the  state of ultimate consciousness that lies beyond all limitation: the transcendent,  ultimate consciousness. Through a consideration of this central idea, the poem  unfolds to give expression to the brand of nonduality (advaya) that is fundamental  to the Saivite sadhaka or mystic&rsquo;s understanding of reality.</p>
<p>The Author of the Poem</p>
<p>Born sometime between 950 and 975 C.E to a rich and noble brahman family in  the city of Srinagar, Abhinavagupta grew up and matured in an atmosphere su percharged with religious devotion and dedication to learning. Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s  father, Narasirhhagupta, claimed descent from one Atrigupta, who had been  brought to Kashmir by King Lalitaditya (725-76f C.E.). Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s mother,  Vimala, died when Abhinavagupta was still young, and there is no doubt that her  death affected him greatly.</p>
<p>The family were devout followers of Siva, and Abhinavagupta began his early  studies of Saivism with his learned father but quickly began visiting teachers in  Kashmir and elsewhere. While he was studying literature and poetry, he was  spontaneously overcome with an intoxicating devotion to Siva. In his own sub</p>
<p>sequent self-understanding, this event would be seen as the initial impulse of  Siva&rsquo;s Saktipata or the descent of divine grace. Following this event, he seems to  have studied very widely in all of the fields of philosophical, religious, and literary  knowledge that were available to him. His love of learning and his spiritual search  led him to travel to Jalandhara, where he encountered the Tantric master Sam</p>
<p>bhunatha, who initiated him into the practices of the left-handed Kaula tradition.  This early period of study and spiritual practice lead to a mature life dedicated  to the absorption of knowledge in an atmosphere of extreme religious fervor.  Abhinavagupta never married and spent his life living in the homes of his many  teachers. At the height of his fame, he was revered as a charismatic Tantric master</p>
<p>whose authority as a guru or teacher was enhanced by the fact that he was con sidered to be a Mahasiddha, that is to say, a highly perfected and accomplished  mystic. A prolific writer, he was the author of twenty-one still extant works (and  there are references to titles of twenty-three others now apparently lost). We have  no definitive information about Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s death. Local Kashmiri legend  has it that the great master walked into a cave with 1,200 of his disciples and  simply disappeared.</p>
<p>The intellectual context of Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s writings is very broad, in part due  to his relatively late date in relation to the earlier traditions of Indian philosophy  and religion. In addition to the revealed literature of the Agamas and Tantras, and  the texts produced by his predecessors in the Saivism of Kashmir, Abhinava</p>
<p>gupta&rsquo;s work resonates with practically all that precedes him in Indian thought,  including the traditional Brahmanical or Vedic literature, the debates of the vari-</p>
<p>SEAL OF SAMBH U 575</p>
<p>ous philosophical traditions, the mysticism of the yogins, the various devotional  (bhakti) traditions, as well as the varieties of Buddhist and Jaina philosophical  discourse.</p>
<p>As a result, Abhinavagupta is considered to be one of the most sophisticated  and definitive theoreticians of medieval Hindu Tantra. His work as an authori tative interpreter of the revealed scriptures of Saivism was deeply intertwined with  his life as a devotee of Siva. His Tantric synthesis - termed the Trika-Kaula be cause of its skillful melding of doctrinal and ritual elements drawn from these  two Saivite preceptorial lineages - is so compellingly accomplished that it sub sequently became the normative formulation of what is later known as Kashmir  Saivism.</p>
<p>Writing in a fluid and often difficult Sanskrit, Abhinavagupta composed a large  number of influential works of philosophical theology including the Isvara-pra tyabhi)nd-vimarsinl (Commentary on the Recognition of the Lord); the Tantraloka  (Light on the Tantras), and the Paratrimsika-vivarana (The Long Commentary on  the Thirty Verses on the Supreme). Although he must be counted among the first  rank of India&rsquo;s greatest thinkers, outside Kashmir his name was practically for gotten until the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Sambhavi-mudra or the Seal of Sambhu</p>
<p>At the core of the &ldquo;Anubhava-nivedana-stotra,&rdquo; Abhinavagupta focuses on the  Sambhavi mudra, the seal of Sambhu. He does this in order to describe the par adoxical state of the yogin who does not close his eyes to the outer world (verse  1), yet who never loses sight of the innermost consciousness. This description of  mystical attainment is characteristic of the Saiva Tantra, and it differs greatly from  the much more rigidly enclosed or purely introversive definitions of achieved  mysticism found in earlier traditions of Indian thought.</p>
<p>From a doctrinal point of view, the articulation that Abhinavagupta gives in  these longer works of the nondual Saivism of Kashmir is to be distinguished  philosophically by its assertion that what is termed &ldquo;Siva&rdquo; - the absolute and  primordial consciousness - is advaya or nondual. Moreover, this nondualism dif</p>
<p>fers in important ways from the advaita taught in the various schools of the  philosophical Vedanta. For the Kashmiri nondual Saivites, the nondualism or  advaya of Siva does not in any way imply that the world and all who dwell in it  are an illusion or not real. Instead, Abhinavagupta asserts that this world is real  precisely because it is only Siva - the absolute consciousness.</p>
<p>However, the assertion of the reality of the world does not fall into &ldquo;naive&rdquo;  realism - asserting the ultimacy of the reality of the world as world. Instead, it  seeks to articulate the enlightened and transformed vision of the mystic for whom  the paradoxical omnipresence of Siva has become a tangible experience; this is  the abiding in the sambhavi mudra. Thus, Siva&rsquo;s nonduality encompasses without  contradiction the arising of duality and diversity within it.</p>

<p>This stance or gesture of consciousness has often also been called the bhairavi  mudra, the seal of Bhairava (a name for a form of Siva). An anonymous verse  often quoted in the texts of the tradition describes the bhairavi mudra as follows:  &ldquo;Even though gazing outside, the eyes neither opening nor closing, one should  direct one&rsquo;s attention within. This is the seal (mudra) of Bhairava, concealed as  the best secret of all the Tantras.&rdquo; Curiously, this verse begins with the same term  in Sanskrit that begins Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s poem: antar-laksya, literally, that which  is to be perceived within, referring to the innermost object of perception. This is  Siva, the highest consciousness to be recognized or perceived inwardly by the  yogin as the true and deepest nature of both the inner Self and the outer world.</p>
<p>Thus, whether it is called the Sambhavi mudra or the bhairavi-mudra, this term  describes a kind of bifocal mystical vision that involves the simultaneity of outer  sensory perception and inner yogic vision. When this vision is achieved, the  Saivite yogin need never repudiate the outer &ldquo;thisness&rdquo; (idanta) of the objects of  perception in an exclusively introversive, closed-eyed samadhi or meditative ab sorption. Instead, his outer vision is transformed so that it does not finally fall on  the world&rsquo;s apparent &ldquo;outwardness&rdquo; or &ldquo;manifestness&rdquo; (verse 1). Rather, what is  truly seen is the hidden interiority concealed within the world&rsquo;s apparent objec</p>
<p>tivity, an interiority in which the separateness and duality of the world have  melted into the all-pervasiveness of the paradoxical and boundaryless conscious ness known as Siva.</p>
<p>This theme of the melting or dissolving (vilina, linata, galita, mentioned in  verses 1,2, and 3) of the world into the unitary consciousness is widespread in  Saiva mysticism. Abhinavagupta tells us that it is achieved by the grace (prasada)  of the master, and this state is described as affording access to the highest con</p>
<p>sciousness beyond both the ordinary conditions of awareness, and the states of  purely introversive meditative absorption (verse 1). In order to understand in  more detail the play of meanings that combine in great richness around the notion  of Sambhavi mudra, we now examine in more detail what Abhinavagupta means  by a mudra.</p>
<p>The Meanings of Mudra</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, the term mudra most commonly denotes a seal in the sense of any  instrument used for sealing or stamping. In the ancient Indus valley civilization,  there were carved stone seals engraved with a variety of designs and used to  imprint this design into the wet clay of a pot or other object. In this same sense,  ancient India knew of other seals such as metallic signet rings or other engraved  implements that could be pressed into melted wax. The plot of a classical Sanskrit  play, the Mudrd-raksasa or &ldquo;Raksasa&rsquo;s Ring&rdquo; (by the sixth-century C.E. author  ViSakhadatta) revolves around just such a signet ring that belongs to the chief  minister of a king, and the authority that the signature engraved on such a ring  would bring to one who was not its rightful owner.SEAL OF SAMBH U 577</p>
<p>In the context of Indian dance, a mudra is often understood as a stylized  physical gesture of the hands, eyes, or body that carries or conveys symbolic  meanings. Many of these same mudras or symbolic gestures of the body are  encountered in the textual descriptions of Indian deities, and in the artistic rep</p>
<p>resentation of these deities in sculpture and painting. Thus, for example, there is  the famous cinmudra or &ldquo;seal of consciousness&rdquo; displayed by the hands of many  deities. In this sense as well, many varieties of Hindu religious ritual (including  that of Saivism) employ numerous hand mudras as an essential element of their  ritual performances.</p>
<p>In the traditions of hatha yoga, a mudra carries the meaning of a variety of  physical gestures or poses, or esoteric techniques of a specific sort that often  include some sort of lock (bandha) on the subtle energy of the body. In this sense,  we encounter in the texts of yoga the famous khecari mudra, literally the &ldquo;seal of  flying through the void,&rdquo; which was interpreted as a difficult technique for swal</p>
<p>lowing the tongue and thus tasting the nectar of immortality that drips down  inside the accomplished yogin&rsquo;s skull. Another example from hatha yoga is the  aSvim-mudra, the &ldquo;equine seal,&rdquo; which involves locking the energy in the anal or  perineal region. There are many more such mudras in the traditions of hatha  yoga.</p>
<p>In a related though slightly different environment, there are the mudras that  involve techniques for Tantric sexual intercourse such as the vajroli mudra  (dubbed in recent literature in the West the &ldquo;reverse fountain-pen effect&rdquo;) for  reabsorbing ejaculated semen back from the vulva into the male urethra, and  thus, it was thought, absorbing as well the female ejaculatory fluids and orgasmic  energies.</p>
<p>In the wider ambit of the Hindu Tantra, the term mudra is encountered in the  traditional list of the so-called pancamakara or five Ms, the listing of five &ldquo;forbid den substances&rdquo; - each of which begins with the letter M in Sanskrit - that were  thought to constitute an integral part of the transgressive ritual of the Tantra.  Here, the term mudra referred to a parched grain that was thought to have an  aphrodisiac effect (see Bharati, Tantric Traditions, p. 243). However, in Kashmiri  Tantra, and especially in the works of Abhinavagupta, the term mudra does not  appear to have been used with this last connotation. For the Kashmiri traditions,  the list of the five Ms appears to have been reduced to the three Ms: madya,  consecrated wine; mamsa, flesh or meat; and maithuna, ritual sexual intercourse  (Tantraloka 29.96). Mudra does not appear on this list; instead, Abhinavagupta  devotes an entire chapter of his summa of the Saiva Tantras and Agamas, the  Tantraloka (TA), to explaining the nature of mudra in a different and quite subtle  way (TA 32. 1-3). As we will see, Abhinavagupta presents a theory of mudra that  is intended to explain both its practice and its origins.</p>
<p>Abhinavagupta first offers a traditional, interpretive etymology of the term mu dra. He says - breaking the term apart into two constituent elements - that a  mudra is described in the traditional texts or sastras as that which gives (ra)  pleasure or happiness (mud). That is to say, Abhinavagupta continues, a mudra</p>
<p>578 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEGA</p>
<p>is the name for that by means of which one attains the intrinsic nature of con sciousness. Most importantly, he adds, a mudra is that which presents the gift of  the Self by means of the body (TA 32.3). Ksemaraja, one of the disciples of  Abhinavagupta and an important Tantric author in his own right, adds to these  traditional interpretive etymologies of the term mudra. In his comment on sutra  19 of his Pratyabhijndhrdayam, Ksemaraja says a mudra is so called first, because  it dispenses joy (muda) as a result of being of the nature of the highest bliss  (paramananda); second, because it dissolves or melts (dravanat) all spiritual bond age; and third, because it seals (mudranat) the entire universe into the state of the  transcendent consciousness (turiya). All of these interpretations convey different  aspects of the tradition&rsquo;s understanding of mudra.</p>
<p>Then Abhinavagupta becomes even more specific and technical. He tells us that  a mudra is a pratibimba, a counterpart form or reflected image, in contrast to the  bimba or the original image or form. Abhinavagupta goes on to assert a double  causal relationship between these two images or forms. He says that the counter</p>
<p>part image or form arises or is produced from the bimba, the original image or  form, but that the original image or form can be produced or made to arise from  the pratibimba, the counterpart form. In order to understand what Abhinavagupta  means by all this, we can begin by adopting an additional terminology of trans</p>
<p>lation and say that, in this definition, Abhinavagupta is telling us that a mudra is  a sign, and that the sign (pratibimba) is the counterpart of that which is signified  (bimba).</p>
<p>To illustrate: even in English, the term &ldquo;seal&rdquo; carries two different meanings. It  means either the engraved or otherwise carved or decorated implement or tool,  or the imprint that is created by that tool or implement.</p>
<p>In the first case, the design on the imprinting tool might be called the bimba  or original image, and the design left behind on the wax might be called the  pratibimba or counterpart image or form. In this case, then, the bimba or engraved  tool gives rise to the pratibimba or waxen seal. It is this pratibimba that Abhi</p>
<p>navagupta wishes to call the mudra.</p>
<p>We also recall Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s claim of a double causal directionality: prati bimba arises from bimba, but also bimba arises from pratibimba. In what sense  can the original image be said to arise from the counterpart image? Or, in what  sense can a sign give rise to that which it signifies? We here arrive at the first of  two important uses of mudra in Saiva yogic mysticism: first, the practice of mudra  as strategic method that gives rise to yogic attainments, and second, the sponta neous mudras that are born from the supreme consciousness. A mudra is, first,  considered to be a bodily &ldquo;sign&rdquo; of consciousness; by practicing it, the experience  of that consciousness can be attained. In this first usage, the context is that of the  not yet realized yogin who takes up the practice of mudra as a method by means  of which to attain yogic results or transformation. Specific poses, hand gestures,  or sensory or mental techniques are practiced by the yogin in the attempt to  precipitate the experience of some change or alteration in awareness. In this sense,  the mudra is a bodily technique consciously and strategically applied as part of a  yogic methodology designed to achieve the goals of yoga.</p>
<p>SEAL OF SAMBH U 579</p>
<p>As Abhinavagupta has told us, a mudra is that which presents the gift of the  Self by means of the body. In this sense, Abhinavagupta explains that there are  at least four different kinds of mudras: those that are made by the whole body  (kaya); those that are made by the hands (kara); those that are made by speech  (vak) (or the mouth or tongue); and those that are made in the awareness or mind  (citta) (JA 32.9b). Thus, by means of the bodily positions, hand poses, esoteric  physical techniques of mouth, tongue, or sexual organ, or, indeed, by means of  meditative techniques performed by the bodily senses and the mind - all of which  are varieties of mudras that are described in the traditions of Indian yoga - there  can arise the experience of supreme consciousness.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that the Sambhavi mudra of the poem is first presented. It  can be understood initially under this rubric of upaya or yogic method. The seal  of Sambhu is a sign of the ultimate consciousness. By &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; that sign, that  which it signifies can be experienced. Specifically, the Sambhavi mudra itself can  be understood as a technique of the breath, mind, and senses for achieving the  highest consciousness by means of the kind of &ldquo;bifocal&rdquo; vision described above.  A good description of the technique is found in the Vijndna-bhairava-tantra, which  describes this form of meditative practice as follows (verse 80): &ldquo;Fixing the gaze  on some outer object and yet at the same time making his mind free of the prop  of all thought constructs, the yogin acquires the state of Siva without delay.&rdquo; In  this mode of understanding, the various practices called mudra are the counter part images of the original consciousness, an experience of which they are meant  to precipitate. Hence, returning to Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s analysis, in this sense, bimba  is born of pratibimba. In the poem we can see that Abhinavagupta is alluding,  particularly in verses 1 and 2, to the Sambhavi mudra as a technique or practice  to be performed.</p>
<p>In verses 3 and 4 of the poem, however, we encounter a different idea of the  Sambhavi mudra. Rather than being a technique, the Sambhavi mudra is under stood as a description of the highest state of yogic achievement. Here Abhinava gupta seems to insist that he is now telling us about the true mudra (and mantra  and yoga), which is spontaneously produced as a result of the yogin&rsquo;s state of  abiding in the supreme nondual consciousness. Indeed, this reversal is further  emphasized in verse 4 by the verbal play (which verges on punning) in the San skrit words of the verse: he tells us about mantras that have no syllables, mudras  in which no physical gestures are performed, and a yoga in which no pranayama  or deliberate breath control is practiced.</p>
<p>This reversal is significant, for here the poem speaks about the Sambhavi mudra  as a spontaneous occurrence in the body, which is precipitated not as a practice  engaged in order to attain liberation but rather as that very condition of liberation  itself. In this second mode of understanding the nature of mudra, the directional  causality has reversed, and now bimba, original image, gives rise to pratibimba,  counterpart form. This reversal signals an explanatory Tantric theory for the origin  of mudras (just as the previous analysis was an explanatory Tantric theory for  their use in yogic practice).</p>
<p>Of the many mudras mentioned in Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s works (and in the wider</p>
<p>580 PAU L E . MULLER-ORTEG A</p>
<p>literature of Saivism), there are at least four that seem especially to fall into this  category of mudra as denoting states of achieved mystical consciousness. In ad dition to the Sambhavi mudra, we find the bhairavi mudra used to depict a state  of liberation (as described above). In the Tantraloka, Abhinavagupta praises an other important mudra as primary: the khecari mudra, the &ldquo;stance of moving or  flying through the void of the supreme consciousness.&rdquo; Abhinavagupta asserts  that all the other mudras of consciousness are derivations or variations of the  khecari mudra (TA 32. 6). As we have seen above, the practice of this mudra was  understood in a very different sense from that interpreted by Abhinavagupta here.  Nevertheless, it is here understood by Abhinavagupta as describing the stance of  the accomplished yogin for whom all possible signs of duality or differentiation  have completely vanished. Another important Saiva mudra relating to the con dition of liberation (mentioned in several places, including in Ksemaraja&rsquo;s Pra tyabhijnahrdayam) is the krama mudra, the &ldquo;seal of sequentiality&rdquo; in which there  is the sequential movement (krama) of outer awareness into the innermost con sciousness, and a countervailing (and sometimes simultaneous) movement of the  inner consciousness into outer awareness.</p>
<p>In addition to these, we find mentioned (in TA 32.4-6a, as well as in the Vijnana bhairava-tantra verse 77, and many other places) mudras with such names as the  trisulimm - relating to the trident; the karankinim - the skeletal; the krodhanam - the wrathful; the lelihanikam - the seal of tasting or licking, as well as many others.  All of these appear to denote &ldquo;stances&rdquo; or &ldquo;gestures&rdquo; of consciousness of the Saivite  mystic in the ascending evolution toward the highest realization.</p>
<p>Thus, the Sambhavi mudra refers to stance of the yogin in which the absolute  consciousness is realized in its completeness and totality. It is, therefore, a descrip tion of the state of liberation within the body (jivanmukti) and of the impact of that  state of absolute consciousness on the limited individuality of the practitioner.</p>
<p>Sambhavi-mudra, the Great Seal of the Absolute</p>
<p>To understand this poem it is necessary to see that the metaphor of the seal as  implement is here transposed to the impact (saktipata) of the Absolute. It is like  an invisible and transcendent &ldquo;implement&rdquo; that emerges from within to &ldquo;seal&rdquo; its  design on the person of the yogin. Like wax that has been melted, the mind and  body of the yogin have been &ldquo;melted&rdquo; by dedicated yogic practice. The yogin must  be responsive to the impact of this experience of the Absolute. He must not be  rigid, contracted, or given over to tightly limiting and constricting activities of the  body, the vital energy, and the mind. Such constricted &ldquo;bodily&rdquo; activities (repre sentative of those of the ordinary person) would only serve to &ldquo;harden,&rdquo; as it were,  the being of the yogin and to make him unresponsive to the influx of the potency  of the Absolute.</p>
<p>All the preliminary stages of yoga thus seem to be meant to prepare the yogin</p>
<p>SEAL OF SAMBHU 581</p>
<p>for this condition of responsiveness to the influx of the supreme power or sakti.  What is sought, finally, is a kind of existential transparency to absolute conscious ness. Upon reaching the summit of mystical consciousness, the being of the yogin  then reveals the shape of the Great &ldquo;Seal&rdquo; of the Absolute, like the signet ring that  is impressed into the warm and receptive surface of the wax. The resulting shapes  and impressions are the mudras of consciousness, even as the force of the impact  of the Seal of the Absolute - the state of liberation - is also called a mudra. In deed, the body of the enlightened yogin is understood to be continuously forming  mudras, some overt, others subtle. Every activity of the enlightened yogin is a  mudra: a &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; or &ldquo;sign&rdquo; that reveals the shape and character of the absolute  consciousness that is invisibly impressing itself into the receptive yogin&rsquo;s being.</p>
<p>The mudra as pratibimba or counterpart image, then, refers to the responsive  molding of the yogin&rsquo;s individuality: the mind, breath, body, and demeanor of  the yogin are all shaped by the overwhelming impact of the potency of the Ab solute. It, so to speak, molds the yogin into its own design; it &ldquo;seals&rdquo; its imprint  on the being of the yogin. In this way, though transcendent, invisible, and beyond  the reach of the senses, the Absolute nevertheless, by means of the force or Sakti  of its descent into the individuality of the practitioner, reveals its nature in the  transformation of the state of the realized yogin. The state of the mystical expe</p>
<p>rience of the absolute consciousness - the sambhavi mudra as bimba or original  image or form - can thus be understood to &ldquo;seal&rdquo; its effect or invisible design  upon the outer assemblage (this is the sense of the term samsthana in verse 3) of  the body, breath, and mind of the yogin. This creates the many mudras or physical  gestures or responsive demonstrations in the sense of pratibimba or counterpart  image or form of the absolute.</p>
<p>Such a double understanding of mudra reflects what the Saivite tradition will  call anupaya or &ldquo;no-practice&rdquo; (discussed below). It seems to be implicit in Abhi navagupta&rsquo;s definition of mudra that the sense of mudra as yogic practice is sub servient to and dependent upon the sense of mudra as spontaneous existential  gesture of the condition of liberation. Indeed, in the Tantraloka Abhinavagupta  explicitly singles out the spontaneously appearing mudras of consciousness by  insisting that &ldquo;Whatever bodily configuration appears spontaneously in one who  has ascended completely to the sphere of the absolute consciousness (khecari  cakra), that alone is to be considered a mudra. The rest, which are devoid of the  impact of the absolute consciousness, are simply unnatural deformations of the  body&rdquo; (TA 32.65).</p>
<p>This understanding of spontaneously appearing mudras provides us with what  amounts to a Tantric theory of origin for mudras. By implication, we can speculate  that the strategic practice of mudra appears to be the imitation of such gestures,  stances, and poses. What had previously been observed in the posture and de</p>
<p>meanor of the enlightened yogin as spontaneous manifestations of deep inner  transformation are purposefully imitated by other yogins as a conscious stratagem  for precipitating or reduplicating that very state of illuminated consciousness.  Although the poem does not explicitly take up these themes, they hover in its</p>
<p>582 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEG A</p>
<p>conceptual background, particularly in the sharp contrast between the first two  verses and the last two.</p>
<p>Sambhavi-mudra and the Nonduality of Siva</p>
<p>This poem sings about abiding in this space of deepest interiority. What is at  stake for the Saiva Tantric yogin here is not just a momentary breach or prelim inary entry into the supreme consciousness. Rather, the poem extols the state of  the most accomplished Saivite mystic for whom the experience of the great Self  has matured, stabilized, and become a continuous experience, a quotidian state  of being (verse 2).</p>
<p>Such a state is not understood to exclude the dynamic, swirling, and abundant  variety of the world. Rather, it is the full revelation of the intrinsic and unchanging  source from which this kaleidoscopic drama of samsara continuously emerges  and manifests. Therefore, the nonduality of the ultimate consciousness of Siva is  understood to be continuous with, contiguous, and subjacent to the differentiated  and variegated play of the world. It is the source of all differentiation (srsti), it is  that which underlies, supports, and inheres in the variety of differentiation (sthiti),  and it is that into which the differentiation finally merges (samhara).</p>
<p>In the final state of vision described by the sambhavi mudra, the &ldquo;world&rdquo; reveals  itself to be only consciousness. It is &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; with the stamp of Siva&rsquo;s blissful  nonduality. Such a yogin succeeds in tasting the unitary flavor of Siva (ekarasa)  in every moment of the apparently differentiated perception of a supposedly sepa</p>
<p>rate and objective world. Whether the accomplished yogin gazes within or with out, what is perceived is the boundaryless consciousness of Siva. As a result, for  that yogin, the very distinction between inward and outwardly turned perception  and, indeed, between self and other, between the supposedly only silent and  tranquil absolute consciousness and the apparently only dynamic and active rela tive world - all of these distinctions collapse.</p>
<p>Because this poem was probably directly addressed to a small audience of  initiated disciples, it unfolds against the background of a shared understanding  of such philosophical argumentation about the nonduality of Siva, as well as of  the complex technicalities of Saiva yoga and its understanding of an ascending  path of mystical consciousness. But although the philosophical theology of Abhi</p>
<p>navagupta&rsquo;s branch of Saivism posits the notion of advaya or radical nonduality  as a fundamental tenet, the Tantric sadhaka nevertheless seeks to actualize fully  the experience of this philosophical formulation as the direct and unmediated  realization of his daily practice. Indeed, the yogin seeks, finally, a stabilized con</p>
<p>dition of achieved mystical consciousness that both fulfills and in some significant  sense brings to an end all explicit forms of practice.</p>
<p>In the yoga of Saivism, central to such a practice are the forms of samavesa or  absorptive meditative merging, of which there are several varieties or degrees of  intensity. For Abhinavagupta, the definitive classification of these is to be found</p>
<p>SEAL OF SAMBH U 583</p>
<p>in the Mdlim-vijaya-tantra. There, the yogic methods or means (upayas) for at taining the supreme consciousness are arranged in terms of samavesa. These range  from the so-called anava or &ldquo;minute,&rdquo; to the sakta or &ldquo;empowered,&rdquo; to the Sam bhava or &ldquo;supreme.&rdquo; Thus, the highest method or degree of yogic absorption is  usually termed sambhava: that which relates to Sambhu or Siva. Here, the effort  and technique, the dedicated practice and discipline of the lesser modes of Saiva  yoga have been left behind. The Sambhava upaya involves the highest states of  mystical dissolution of individuality beyond the realm of the thought-constructs.  Furthermore, although effort in any explicit sense has been left behind, such a  &ldquo;method&rdquo; is understood to be empowered by the force and impact of the grace  of the master (verse 1). By means of it, the practitioner is led to the ultimately  effortless yogic merging into the englobing consciousness of Siva, the absolute  consciousness.</p>
<p>The accomplished Saivite mystic is one who - even as his vision falls on the  surface play of existence - is capable of penetrating its pulsating layers and con tinuously discovering, uncovering, and recognizing its ultimate, unitary, and si lent source in the supreme consciousness. The seal of Sambhu, the Sambhavi  mudra, then, is this paradoxical state of Tantric attainment that is neither exclusive  nor repudiatory, nor does it in any way reject the variety of the world&rsquo;s astonishing  play.</p>
<p>Abiding in the space that encompasses both inwardness and outwardness in  one overarching and paradoxical consciousness, the yogin is capable of seeing  that the world now reveals its deeper layers of being, finally laying bare its ultimate  and secret source in the resplendent domain of Siva: the silent, pulsating core  essence of the supreme consciousness (verse 2).</p>
<p>Although what Abhinavagupta describes in this poem is certainly rooted in the  technical practice of Saiva yoga of a complex sort, it enters into the zone of what  this and other Saivite traditions characterize as the anupaya or the &ldquo;method of no  practice.&rdquo; Such a &ldquo;no-practice method&rdquo; consists of the summit of the mystical life  where the &ldquo;practice,&rdquo; so to speak, involves abiding in surrender to the Absolute,  finally yielding the vestiges of limited individuality to the supreme consciousness.  From this vantage point, we can understand this poem as giving expression to  that most rarefied of mystical movements: the final transition from the highest  practice or method of the Saiva yoga - the sambhava upaya - to the anupaya or  &ldquo;no practice&rdquo; as the state of liberation and enlightenment itself. Here, the need  for yogic practice, method, technique, and effort with regard to mantra, mudra,  and breath have all been transcended in the stabilized condition of fully illumi nated awareness. Such is the Sambhavi mudra.</p>
<p>In this poem Abhinavagupta, one of the definitive theologians of a branch of the  later &ldquo;high&rdquo; Hindu Tantra, reveals himself as an ecstatic, mystical poet; Abhina vagupta, the masterly theoretician of Saiva ritual, lays bare his own accomplish ment as a yogin; Abhinavagupta, the sober philosopher and capable expositor of  the most subtle forms of reasoned philosophical argumentation, allows himself</p>
<p>584 PAUL E. MULLER-ORTEG A</p>
<p>to be seen as an intoxicated devotee of absolute consciousness. As a result, the  poem is less stylistically rigid and formal than many comparable stotras directed  toward deities. It is - within the constraints of the rich technical vocabulary that  Abhinavagupta employs - quite descriptive and evocative. One senses the ex</p>
<p>treme familiarity with which Abhinavagupta addresses himself to his theme. As  we have seen, in the poem, Abhinavagupta takes features of the technical yoga - in particular the idea of mudra - and transposes them beyond their complexity</p>
<p>as practice in order to reveal what he claims to be their true nature.  The poem exists against the background of an immense array of Tantric tech nicalities but finally settles down in the intimacy of the Tantric practitioner&rsquo;s inner  state. It is itself an inspired mystical expression, a mudra, if you will, for it attempts  to speak in poetic terms of a state of mystical attainment in such a way that carries  the weight of that attainment. Finally, the poem is not concerned with philo sophical argumentation, nor does it engage in didactic teaching, nor is it instruc tive about the intricacies of the practice of Saiva yoga - or, indeed, of its complex  rituals. It is, in the end, a celebratory exclamation: a stotra or hymn in praise, a  true poem in that it gives expression to the direct experience of the absolute with  elegance and in a way that opens that experience to others. Hence, Abhinava gupta&rsquo;s title for this stotra: a song of praise intended to communicate (nivedana)  the direct experience (anubhava) of the Absolute.</p>
<p>Though little known outside Kashmir, the short poetical compositions of Abhi navagupta appear to have been central to the lore of Kashmir for a millennium.  They appeared in published form in 1935 in K. C. Pandey&rsquo;s massive study of  Abhinavagupta: Abhinavagupta: An Historical and Philosophical Study, Chowk hamba Sanskrit Studies, vol. 1 (Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office,  1963). Pandey (p. 73) describes finding the Sanskrit text of this poem in a col lection of Abhinavagupta&rsquo;s stotras in the possession of one Harabhatt Shastri of  Kashmir. He warns us, however, that he finds no other authority for attributing  the work to Abhinavagupta. He includes this stotra in Sanskrit (along with a  number of other short works by Abhinavagupta) as an appendix to his book. The  stotra does not appear in the listing of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies.  Lilian Silbum tells us that she studied this and other such stotras of Abhinava gupta under the direction of Swami Lakshman Joo. In 1970 she published a  translation of a number of them into French, along with a very useful thematic  and interpretive introduction and commentary. I have translated the stotra as it  appears in Appendix C of Pandey&rsquo;s book (p. 953).</p>

<p>The Song of Praise Intended to Communicate the Direct Experience of the Absolute</p>

<li>The accomplished Tantric yogin, whose mind and breath have been dis solved through complete immersion in the innermost object of perception, the  supreme goal of yoga - such a yogin then abides with a silenced though open  vision, the pupils of the eyes unmoving. Though he [is seen to] gaze still on  the outer world, in truth his vision assuredly does not rest on its [apparent  outwardness]. This is the seal of Sambhu - the sambhavi mudra, the Saiva  &ldquo;seal&rdquo; of unitary consciousness, the performing of the ultimate &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; or  &ldquo;stance&rdquo; of Siva&rsquo;s illumination.</li>
</ol>
<p>This state of true and ultimate mystical vision, O Divine Master, is produced  only because of your potent and illuminating grace. This is the domain of  Sambhu, the gracious Lord, the true state of reality which is beyond the ex perience of both the fullness [of the conditions of ordinary awareness], as well  as lying beyond even the [extraordinary] void states [of advanced Tantric medi tation] .</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Such a yogin abides with eyes half opened and yet with a mind that is  motionless and serene, his gaze fixed steadily [at the secret portal that opens  to the yogin&rsquo;s subtle perception found] at the tip of the nose. The sun and</li>

<p>moon [either the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; as the means of knowledge (pramana) and the &ldquo;moon&rdquo;  as the known objective universe (prameya), or the two breaths and the whole  world of duality that they stir] have dissolved into the great interiority of aware ness that pulsates naturally with the triple vibration [either the vibration of  the energies of will, knowledge, and action or the vibration of the supreme  Sakti that constantly tends toward the manifestation of the visible reality, the  counterbalancing reabsorptive pulsation of consciousness, and the supreme</p>
<p>pulsation or adya-spanda that abides beyond such polarizing movements].  Here, the yogin achieves the One reality, the domain whose nature is essen tially the pure light of consciousness, devoid entirely of all externality, the  supreme spirit, the true principle, the abode of the highest, the supreme es sence. More than this, what is there to be said of it?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In that state, whatsoever words may emerge from the mouth of such a yogin  are, indeed, transcendentally charged mantras. The aggregate form of the  body - within which the experience of pleasure and pain are constantly aris ing - that very bodily form [of the illuminated yogin] is indeed nevertheless</li>
</ol>
<p>the mudra or seal that reveals [the experience of the Absolute].  The spontaneous and natural flow of the breath [which produces the natural  mantric sound hamsa continuously] - that, indeed, is the extraordinary and  highest yoga itself. Having directly experienced the unparalleled splendor, the  illuminating glory of the divine Sakti, in truth, what will then not reveal itself  to me?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The [true and highest] mantra that then reveals itself in that state has no  distinguishable arrangement of syllables or phonemes to be seen within it [for  it is of the nature of the potency of the ultimate consciousness aham itself.]  When the entirety of the [separative or contractive] bodily activities have  dropped away or when the practice of all bodily techniques [engaged strate gically by the yogin] has stopped, then the [true and highest] mudra or seal of  the absolute rises up to reveal itself. As soon as the [separative and dualizing]  flow of the breath has ceased or when the [practice of the] flow of the breath  [that is, pranayama techniques of yoga] have stopped being performed, that,  indeed, is [the true] yoga which then appears.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the magnificent festival of mystical illumination that leads to the attaining  of your splendor, what, indeed, does not then reveal itself to the enlightened  wise ones as completely extraordinary?34</p>
<p>Vajrayoga in the Kalacakra Tantra</p>
<p>John Newman</p>
<p>The Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism is the second of two modes of Mahayana  Buddhist practice. In the first of these - the &ldquo;system of the Perfections&rdquo; (paramita naya) - the bodhisattva strives to attain the supreme awakening of buddhahood  by means of a lengthy and gradual training in generosity, morality, forbearance,  perseverance, meditative concentration, and wisdom. In the &ldquo;Mantra system&rdquo;  (mantra-naya), a synonym for Vajrayana, the bodhisattva develops the same vir tues and knowledge, but uses special magical ritual meditative techniques that  greatly accelerate the process. Because the Vajrayana is primarily a type of mystical  praxis, its sacred scriptures and exegetical literature are mostly devoted to prac tical matters rather than to philosophical doctrine. This has sometimes led to the  misconception that the Vajrayana is merely a body of techniques, and that phi losophy is marginal or irrelevant to its central concerns. In fact the opposite is  true. Vajrayana can only be correctly understood as a ritual-meditative imple mentation of insights developed within the common Mahayana philosophical  tradition.</p>
<p>The principal philosophical view underlying Vajrayana mysticism is Madhya maka (&ldquo;the Middle&rdquo;), which was originally taught by the Buddha in the Perfection  of Wisdom Sutras and later elucidated by Nagarjuna (ca. second century C.E.) in  his Madhyamaka-sastra (&ldquo;Treatise on the Middle&rdquo;). Madhyamaka steers a middle  course between the two ontological extremes of a realism that ascribes inherent  existence to phenomena and a nihilism that denies phenomena&rsquo;s causal efficacy.  It does this by asserting that although phenomena are utterly devoid of inherent  existence, they nevertheless originate in dependence on causes and conditions,  and function in an entirely regular and predictable fashion. Thus any given phe</p>
<p>nomenon can be viewed from two perspectives. When one scrutinizes a phenom enon in search of its intrinsic, independent identity, no such identity is found.  This absence of inherent existence, or &ldquo;own-being&rdquo; (svabhava), is its &ldquo;emptiness&rdquo;  (sunyata). On the other hand, when one observes a phenomenon as it ordinarily</p>
<p>588 JOHN NEWMAN</p>
<p>appears, without engaging in an investigation of its ultimate status, it is seen to  arise within a specific matrix of causes, and it in turn serves to produce specific  effects. This causal regularity of phenomena is called &ldquo;dependent origination&rdquo;  (pratitya-samutpada). According to the Madhyamaka view, emptiness and depen</p>
<p>dent origination mutually entail one another: things are empty of inherent exis tence because they originate in dependence on extrinsic factors, and things are  able to originate and function in causal relationships because they are devoid of  an absolute nature that would preclude such relationships.</p>
<p>The Madhyamaka ontology of emptiness and dependent origination is closely  related to its epistemology of two truths, &ldquo;conventional truth&rdquo; (samvrti-satya) and  &ldquo;ultimate truth&rdquo; (paramdriha-satya). Conventional truth is the world of appear ance. For ordinary people - that is, those who have not gained insight into emp tiness and dependent origination - phenomena appear to possess inherent exis tence, and such people hold these appearances to be real, to exist as they appear.  Buddhist adepts who have realized emptiness alternate between two modes of  cognition: while absorbed in meditative concentration on emptiness they perceive  only emptiness, and conventional appearances do not appear to them at all; when  they arise from meditation conventional phenomena reappear and appear to exist  inherently, but adepts understand that these appearances are illusory, and thus  do not cling to them as real. Buddhas, finally, see conventional truth (appearance)  and ultimate truth (emptiness), simultaneously.</p>
<p>In Vajrayana practice, Madhyamaka doctrine is realized through yogic control  of the mind. Whereas mind in its samsaric state generates and is infatuated by  mundane illusory appearances, the first phase of the Vajrayana path, the &ldquo;gen eration stage&rdquo; (.utpatti-krama), harnesses the creative power of mind to produce a  new divine vision of reality. This imaginative vision, called a mandala, is a trans formation of the practitioner&rsquo;s perception, so that ordinary appearances of self  and environment are replaced by an ideal universe inhabited by deities. The  elaborate symbolism of the mandala is a divinization of basic Buddhist psycho logical and metaphysical categories: the deities of the mandala are the phenomena  that make up the practitioner&rsquo;s personality purified through recognition of their  emptiness. During the generation stage, the practitioner first dissolves ordinary  perception into perception of emptiness. Then within this perception of empti ness, the practitioner&rsquo;s mind manifests in the form of the mandala. By conditioning  him- or herself through the mandala practice of the generation stage, the Vajrayana  practitioner gains a deeper understanding that phenomena are devoid of indepen dent inherent existence, that they are instead the products of mental fabrication.</p>
<p>Whereas the generation stage uses imagination to produce an alternative vision  of conventional reality, the second phase of the Vajrayana path, the &ldquo;completion  stage&rdquo; (utpanna-krama), cognizes the ultimate nature of mind itself. The Tantric  yoga of the completion stage ceases sensory perception and ideation. When these  coarse forms of mental activity have been shut down, the &ldquo;connate luminosity&rdquo;  (sahaja prabhasvara) of mind appears. Through yogic conditioning, this most sub</p>
<p>tle form of mind can be awakened so that it becomes aware of its own emptiness.</p>
<p>VAJRAYOGA IN KALACAKRA TANTRA 589</p>
<p>This special kind of direct realization of emptiness, unique to Vajrayana, is called  the &ldquo;transcendental mahamudra siddhi.&rdquo; Mahamudra can be roughly glossed as  the &ldquo;Great Seal.&rdquo; It is gnosis realizing the mind&rsquo;s own emptiness in a nondual,  nonconceptual fashion: mind is &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; by emptiness, and emptiness is &ldquo;sealed&rdquo;  by mind. Mahamudra is likened to a divination in which a maiden perceives a  hidden object in a mirror. The appearing object is a manifestation of the maiden&rsquo;s  own mind; the maiden does not &ldquo;think&rdquo; of the object, yet she directly perceives  it. Similarly, for the yogin or yogini practicing mahamudra, the subjective aspect  of mind (gnosis) and the objective aspect of mind (the appearance of the mind&rsquo;s  own emptiness) are blended in a single essence so that it is impossible to distin guish knowledge from object of knowledge. This gnosis is called &ldquo;the gnostic  mind of imperishable bliss&rdquo; (aksara-sukha jnana-citta).</p>
<p>The perfect integration of the conventional truth of the mentally fabricated  mandala and the ultimate truth of the connate luminosity realizing emptiness is  called vajrayoga, &ldquo;adamantine union,&rdquo; in the text translated below. Vajrayoga is  the inseparable fusion of wisdom realizing emptiness and compassion sponta</p>
<p>neously manifesting appearances in order to guide living beings to freedom from  samsara. Personal names for this transcendent reality include Adibuddha (Primal  Awakened One), Bhagavan Kalacakra (Lord Wheel of Time), and Vajrasattva (Ad amantine Sentient Being). Because vajrayoga surpasses the limitations of dichot omizing, dualistic thought, language cannot fully encompass its true nature. Nev ertheless, language can point toward the transcendent, and the second half of our  text describes vajrayoga in terms designed to undermine reification of the cate gories that define ordinary conceptions of reality.</p>
<p>The transcendent vajrayoga is heterogeneous because it is the integration of  purified conventional appearance and emptiness. Whereas appearance is a posi tive phenomenon that functions in accordance with the causal law of dependent  origination, emptiness is a mere negation, the simple absence of inherent exis tence. Ordinary thought cannot grasp both aspects of reality simultaneously, yet  &ldquo;the conventional is embodied in emptiness, and emptiness is embodied in the  conventional&rdquo;: vajrayoga confounds conceptual thought, which is based on the  dichotomy existence/nonexistence. Our text quotes the Astasahasrika Prajnapar amitd (&ldquo;Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Eight Thousand Lines&rdquo;) to illustrate this  point: &ldquo;Mind that is non-mind exists.&rdquo; The perfection of wisdom - the compas sionate wisdom realizing emptiness - is &ldquo;non-mind&rdquo; because it is free from con ceptual elaboration and is fused with spacelike emptiness, mind&rsquo;s mere lack of  intrinsic existence. Yet this non-mind &ldquo;exists&rdquo; because it is directly perceived by  the awakened person, and it displays myriad forms that serve to awaken others.</p>
<p>Vajrayoga is &ldquo;without relation&rdquo; (niranvaya) because it pervades everything. It  cannot be localized within mundane existence (the &ldquo;desire,&rdquo; &ldquo;form,&rdquo; and &ldquo;form less&rdquo; existences of Buddhist cosmology) or nirvana (the cessation of the three  realms of existence) because thought defines mundane existence and nirvana as  contraries, and vajrayoga transcends such reifying, dualistic thinking. Similarly,  when fire is generated by spinning a fire-drill on its base, the fire is inseparable</p>
<p>590 JOH N NEWMA N</p>
<p>from the totality of the causes that produce it; it cannot be localized in any  particular cause. Like that, vajrayoga pervades the entire universe of the outer  world (bahya), the self (adhyatma), and the transcendent (para).</p>
<p>As initial realization, vajrayoga is called &ldquo;supreme, perfect awakening in one  moment&rdquo; (ekaksanabhisambodhi). When the Vajrayana practitioner first realizes  vajrayoga he or she experiences a moment of &ldquo;supreme imperishable great bliss&rdquo;  (paramaksara-mahasukha): blissful connate luminosity embraces its own naked  emptiness. In the Vajrayana system treated here, supreme imperishable great bliss  is repeatedly developed in order to produce 21,600 moments of gnosis. This  number - a conventional designation for the number of human respirations in a  day and the number of years in a cosmic cycle - is a symbol of temporal totality,  the embodiment and transcendence of time. Cultivation of supreme imperishable  great bliss serves as a path that purifies the mind of contaminating stains, even tually culminating in the achievement of perfect buddhahood. From the point of  view of perfect buddhahood, we cannot speak of the conventional momentary  origination, duration, and disintegration of phenomena because awakened mind  is free from erroneous discrimination that reifies cause and effect, one and many,  being and nonbeing, and so forth. Such mind is said to be &ldquo;devoid of own-being&rdquo;  (nihsvabhava) because it knows dependent origination and emptiness in a totally  integrated, nondualistic way. This gnosis is also called &ldquo;reality&rdquo; (tattva).</p>
<p>The following translation is a dewdrop lifted from the ocean of the Vimalaprabha  (Stainless Light), the great commentary on the Sri Kdlacakra (Splendid Wheel of  Time), the primary Tantra of the Kalacakra (Wheel of Time) system of Vajrayana  mysticism. The Kalacakra was the last major Tantra produced by the Indian Vaj</p>
<p>rayana tradition, and the Sri Kalacakra and Vimalaprabha contain a date that  enables us to determine that these texts were completed between 1025 and ca.  1040 C.E. The earliest masters of the Kalacakra included Pindo, a brahman Bud dhist monk born in Java, and Naropa, the famous Vajrayana guru of Naalandaa  monastic university. During the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, the Kalacakra  flourished among the Buddhist elite of northeastern India, whence it was trans mitted to Tibet. In Tibet, the Kalacakra became an important item in the spiritual  repertoire of most Buddhist lineages, and it continues to be studied and practiced  today.</p>
<p>The translation, &ldquo;A Summary of the Vajrayoga&rdquo; (Vimalaprabha 1.3.1 [commen tary on Sri&quot; Kalacakra 1. Id]), is based on my unpublished edition of this passage,  which relies on Asiatic Society of Bengal manuscript G. 10766 and on the printed  edition of the Vimalaprabha, which was edited by Jagannatha Upadhyaya and  published in the Bibliotheca Indo-Tibetica Series, no. 11 (Sarnath, Varanasi: Cen tral Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, 1986), pp. 42.15-45.3. In the course of  his discussion, the author of the Vimalaprabha cites the following works, in some  cases anonymously: the Sri Kalacakra, which was edited and published together  with the Vimalaprabha, as cited above; the Astasdhasrika Prajadparamita, which  was edited by P. L. Vaidya and published in the Buddhist Sanskrit Texts Series,</p>

Davidson and published in Melanges chinois et bouddhiques, vol. 20 (Bruxelles:  Institut Beige des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 1981); and the Paramadibuddha, the  Kalacakra mulatantra (&ldquo;basic Tantra&rdquo;), which has come down to us only in frag</p>

<p>A Summary of the Vajrayoga</p>
<p>Now &ldquo;yoga in the Sri Kalacakra&rdquo; [in Sri Kalacakra l.ld] summarizes the vaj rayoga.</p>
<p>In the Mantra system, the Bhagavan Buddha, depending on worldly and  transcendental truth, indicated two types of meaning in this and other Tantras:  one with worldly convention, the second in accordance with the ultimate.  Provisional meaning is indicated with worldly convention. Definitive meaning  is indicated in accordance with the ultimate. Disciples should understand these  two meanings from a guru&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>Likewise, in all the other Tantras the subject matter is of two types: one in  accordance with worldly convention, the second in accordance with the ulti mate. That which is in accordance with worldly convention is characterized  by the colors, arms, symbols, and shapes [of the deities in the mandala]. That  which is in accordance with ultimate truth is devoid of the colors, arms, sym bols, and shapes [of the deities in the mandala].</p>
<p>Of these two, that which is taught in accordance with worldly convention  is [the mandala of deities], a phenomenon of one&rsquo;s own mental fabrication that  produces the worldly siddhis in order to achieve the worldly siddhis in the  outer world and in the self. That which is taught in accordance with ultimate  truth is free from the phenomena of one&rsquo;s mental fabrication in order to achieve  the transcendental mahamudra siddhi that possesses the best of all aspects. It  is directly perceived: an appearance of his own mind manifests in the sky for  the yogin, just as a divination appears in a mirror for a maiden. It produces</p>
<p>592 JOHN NEWMAN</p>
<p>the result that is the desired aim. The result is the gnostic mind of imperishable  bliss.</p>
<p>The unity of these two minds - the vajrayoga consisting of wisdom and  method, the supreme imperishable great aim, the Adibuddha without relation,  Bhagavan Kalacakra - is renowned in all the other Tantras as Vajrasattva. That  very Bhagavan is called the &ldquo;Nature Body&rdquo; in the Perfection of Wisdom - in  the Perfection system that is designated as the cause. Thus, when determining  the four functions [of buddhahood] in the Abhisamayalankarakarika [1.17],  Maitreya says:</p>
<p>[The buddha bodies] are said to be fourfold: the Natural [body], Dharma  body, Enjoyment [body], and Emanation [body], with Activity as well.</p>
<p>That very Bhagavan is called &ldquo;connate joy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;connate body&rdquo; in the  Mantra system that is designated as the effect. It has abandoned object and  subject; it is beyond the phenomenality of limited consciousness; it is not fix ated in existence or nirvana; it is the assembly of the buddhas and the congre gation of the goddesses. The definitive meaning of this is that it has the same  essence as the gnosis body.</p>
<p>This vajrayoga is without relation. It has abandoned eternity and annihila tion. It is beyond worldly examples. It has thoroughly forsaken ideas about  existence and nonexistence. Like a divination in a maiden&rsquo;s mirror, it is not  imagined by one&rsquo;s mind - it is directly seen, an object of experience. It is all  aspects; it originates from the sky. It is completely good, the total cognitive  faculty. It is the connate joy that dwells in the self of everyone. It has completely  abandoned logical reasons and examples.</p>
<p>The heterogeneity of the unity of existence and nonexistence serves as an  example for this vajrayoga for yogins so that they may destroy all grasping at  positions. It is like the following worldly example: &ldquo;Since it is heterogeneous  with &lsquo;pot,&rsquo; &lsquo;sky-flower&rsquo; does not exist, because it is entirely nonexistent. Like</p>
<p>wise, since it is heterogeneous with &lsquo;sky-flower,&rsquo; &lsquo;pot&rsquo; exists, because it is en tirely existent.&rdquo; Because these two are mutually heterogeneous, they are an  example.</p>
<p>Similarly, since it is heterogeneous with annihilation, existence exists, be cause it is entirely existent. Since it is heterogeneous with existence, annihi lation does not exist, because it is entirely nonexistent. The word &ldquo;annihilation&rdquo;  indicates nirvana that is characterized by nonexistence.</p>
<p>Similarly, the unity of these two, pot and sky-flower, serves as an example  for the transcendent because it is heterogeneous. These two, pot and sky flower, are not unified from the point of view of worldly convention because  they are mutually contradictory. For due to the nature of existence and non existence, that which exists does not not exist, and that which does not exist  does not exist. Since it is contradictory, that which makes mind characterized  by existence does not make it characterized by nonexistence; that which makes</p>
<p>VAJRAYOGA IN KALACAKRA TANTRA 59 3</p>
<p>mind characterized by nonexistence does not make it characterized by exis tence.</p>
<p>Here too, the image that consists of emptiness and compassion - the purified  mind that is like a maiden&rsquo;s divination - is not characterized by form because  it is not made of atoms. It is not characterized by formlessness because it is  present in the void.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conventional is embodied in emptiness, and emptiness is em bodied in the conventional. Since it is beyond worldly examples, &ldquo;mind that is  non-mind exists&rdquo; [Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita 3]: it is free from the charac teristics of eternal and annihilated phenomena, it is indivisible emptiness and  compassion. Because of the heterogeneity of both minds from the point of view  of ultimate truth, nondual vajrayoga is beyond &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;is not&rdquo;, and it is the  termination of existence and nonexistence, because the speech of the Tathagata  is without relation.</p>
<p>Here, the Bhagavan said in the Basic J antra [the Paramadibuddha]</p>
<p>Nondual vajrayoga, the great bliss, is beyond &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;is not&rdquo;. It is the ter mination of existence and nonexistence; it is indivisible emptiness and com passion. (1)</p>
<p>The vajrayoga without relation is beyond the nature of atoms and it has  abandoned void phenomena. It is free from eternity and annihilation. (2)</p>
<p>Thus, in other Tantras the Tathagata has said that vajrayoga accomplishes  the mahamudra.</p>
<p>That pure vajrayoga, being the supreme perfect buddhahood in one moment,  is the great aim, the supreme imperishable, connate joy. It does not abide in  the desire existence, it does not abide in the form existence, it does not abide  in the formless existence, it does not abide in the desire nirvana, it does not  abide in the form nirvana, and it does not abide in the formless nirvana, because  it is not fixated in existence or nirvana. It does not abide in both because they  are mutually contradictory; like sun and shadow, existence and nirvana are not  identical. Just as fire does not abide in the base of the fire-drill, in the fire-drill,  or in the effort of the person&rsquo;s hand, a yogin should comprehend the vajrayoga  everywhere in the outer world, in the self, and in the transcendent.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;supreme, perfect awakening in one moment&rdquo; is a moment of  supreme imperishable great bliss. That supreme buddhahood in one moment  develops all the moments through to the end of the count of the breaths. Then  the supreme, perfect buddhahood completed in that moment is the true, perfect  buddha. After that moment of completion in which all tathagatas obtain su</p>
<p>preme, perfect buddhahood, all phenomena do not originate, do not abide, and  do not disintegrate, because they are without relation.</p>
<p>During the moment all phenomena originate they do not abide and do not  disintegrate. During the moment they abide they do not disintegrate and do</p>
<p>594 JOH N NEWMA N</p>
<p>not originate. During the moment all phenomena disintegrate they do not origi nate and do not abide. Also, all phenomena do not momentarily originate,  momentarily abide, and momentarily disintegrate in sequence. And this does  not happen simultaneously: at a single time when all phenomena exist, the</p>
<p>moments of origination, abiding, and disintegration are not identical.  However, you might say: In sequence, the moment of abiding arises from  the moment of origination, the moment of disintegration arises from the mo ment of abiding, and the moment of origination arises from the moment of  disintegration. But that is irrelevant from the point of view of reasoning about  the ultimate: here, another moment does not arise from a prior moment that  has not ceased; likewise, it does not arise from a moment that has ceased. For  example, a sprout does not arise from a seed that is destroyed, and a sprout does  not arise from a seed that is not destroyed. Similarly, since ultimate being does  not exist, there is no one moment, because one and many are contradictory.  With regard to &ldquo;the supreme, perfect buddhahood in one moment that de velops all the moments&rdquo; [Namasangiti 141cb]: Being first fully awakened in a  moment of supreme imperishable bliss, one develops the 21,600 moments of  supreme imperishable bliss. After that, when all moments are nonexistent, the  supreme nondual yoga of the buddhas - separate from one and many - is ul timate because it is separate from being and nonbeing. As long as there is  worldly being, phenomena are discriminated by means of one and many be cause of the appearance of momentary mind. When mind is separate from  momentary phenomena, it is called &ldquo;devoid of own-being.&rdquo;  Therefore, the Bhagavan said that the position devoid of own-being is a  nonposition. So-called &ldquo;positions&rdquo; are: existent/nonexistent, being/nonbeing,  is/is not, one/many, eternity/annihilation, existence/nirvana, form/nonform,  sound/nonsound, moment/nonmoment, desire/nondesire, hatred/nonhatred,  delusion/nondelusion. These and others are positions because they are mutu ally dependent. The buddhas&rsquo; nonfixated nirvana that is separate from this  position is devoid of own-being. Gnosis that is separate from one and many  moments is called &ldquo;reality&rdquo; by the victorious buddhas.</p>
