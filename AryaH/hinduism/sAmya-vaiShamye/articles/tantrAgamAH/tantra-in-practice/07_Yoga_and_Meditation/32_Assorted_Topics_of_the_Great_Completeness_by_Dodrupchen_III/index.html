Oral commentary by Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche
The Great Completeness tradition is considered the highest of the hierarchically arranged ninefold path described by the most ancient order of Tibetan Buddhism, known as Nyingma. Great Completeness, or Dzogchen (rDzogs chen) entails, above all, discovery of one’s actual, and utterly natural, condition. This condition is also known as the base, and the process of coming to recognize it is the path. Through such recognition the fruit, one’s own buddhahood, becomes manifest. All three - base, path, and fruit - are in important ways identical, not causally related or sequential. This text describes base, path, and fruit in terms of three delightful and spontaneous qualities: smoothness, splendor, and freshness.">

<p>Oral commentary by Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche</p>
<p>The Great Completeness tradition is considered the highest of the hierarchically  arranged ninefold path described by the most ancient order of Tibetan Buddhism,  known as Nyingma. Great Completeness, or Dzogchen (rDzogs chen) entails,  above all, discovery of one&rsquo;s actual, and utterly natural, condition. This condition  is also known as the base, and the process of coming to recognize it is the path.  Through such recognition the fruit, one&rsquo;s own buddhahood, becomes manifest.  All three - base, path, and fruit - are in important ways identical, not causally  related or sequential. This text describes base, path, and fruit in terms of three  delightful and spontaneous qualities: smoothness, splendor, and freshness.</p>
<p>Dzogchen is sometimes even called a path without meditation because once  one fully realizes one&rsquo;s own mind-nature or base there is no need for effort of any  kind. Until then however, practice is necessary for clearing away the internal  obstructions that prevent one from clearly experiencing the profundity of one&rsquo;s  own being. Nyingma is the only Buddhist tradition in which Dzogchen exists,  though Dzogchen is also prominent in the Tibetan Bon tradition, where it is  likewise regarded as the most exalted of the nine vehicles described there. Both  Buddhism and Bon Dzogchen emphasize simplicity, purification, and the possi bility of uncovering enlightenment in this lifetime. We will say more of this  shortly; first, a bit of background.</p>
<p>Medieval and Modern Masters of the Great Expanse Practice</p>
<p>A variety of Buddhist textual traditions elaborate the practice of Dzogchen. One  of the best-known bodies of literature, and the one from which the following</p>
<p>558 ANNE CAROLY N KLEIN</p>
<p>selection is taken, is the Essential Heart of the Great Expanse (kLong chen snying  thig). This lineage traces its spiritual roots to one of the most revered figures of  Tibetan religious history, the fourteenth-century scholar and meditation master  Longchen Rabjam (kLong-chen pa Dri-med-&lsquo;od-zer, 1308-1363), said to be the  author of 263 works, 25 of which are still extant. In the late 1700s, the renowned  yogin-practitioner, Jigme Lingpa (&lsquo;Jigs-med-gling-pa Rang-byung rdo-rje, 1729- 1798) had three visions of Longchen Rabjam, as well as powerful visions and  overwhelming awe with respect to Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), whereby  he was inspired to codify the Great Expanse liturgies into their present form. It  was the power of his devotion and confidence in these two masters, rather than  his intellect or scholarly endeavors, that gained him full realization of Dzogchen  practice and philosophy. To this day, Longchen Rabjam&rsquo;s brilliant philosophical  structuring of Dzogchen realization, his evocative verses, and the poetically ex pressed devotation of Jigme Lingpa remain hallmarks of the Heart Essence of the  Great Expanse style of study and practice.</p>
<p>The Great Expanse relies significantly on a unique literary genre of special  importance in the Ancient (Nyingma) school. These are works said to have been  hidden either in the ground or, as in the case of Jigme Lingpa, in the minds of  special persons who are prophesied to discover them, usually through visionary  experience. Through such Treasures (gTer ma), which include major works of  Great Expanse literature, Nyingma continually renews itself, while still maintain</p>
<p>ing allegience to the past.</p>
<p>In Tibet, each lineage, and even each monastic college, has textual and Treasure  traditions unique to it. The historical background and monastic context of our  text is therefore of interest. Its author is the third in a line of reincarnate lamas  that began with the first lama in the Dodrupchen lineage, Jigme Thrinley Ozer  Cjigs-med-sphrin-las-&lsquo;od-zer, 1745-1821), who at the age of thirty-nine was  named principal holder of the Essential Heart of the Great Expanse lineage by  Jigme Lingpa himself, from whom he received the Great Expanse teachings in  their entirety. Thus, he is referred to as the first Dodrupchen Rinpoche; Rinpoche  is a title of honor that literally means &ldquo;Precious One,&rdquo; and is used mainly in  referring to recognized reincarnations and sometimes to persons regarded as very  highly accomplished in this life. Subsequently, the first Dodrupchen Rinpoche  founded Drodon Lundrup Monastery in the Do Valley and Pemako Tsasum Khad riling Monastery in the Yarlung Valley. His successor, the second Dodrupchen  Rinpoche, known as Jigme Phuntshog Jungnay, established Dodrupchen Mon astery on the Tsangchen plain of the Do Valley.</p>
<p>This monastic college occupies a key place in the intellectual and intersectarian  history of Tibetan Buddhism. By the time of the third Dodrupchen (rDo Grub  chen Jigs-med-bstan-pa&rsquo;i-nyi-ma), author of the text translated here, this mon astery&rsquo;s curriculum incorporated Gelugpa authors of philosophical texts, in par ticular Jamyang Shayba, as preparation for its study and practice of the Great  Completeness. As discussed by Tulku Thondup in Masters of Meditation and Mys tery, this intersectarian tradition was continued in the nineteenth century by Shab-</p>
<p>TOPIC S O F THE GREA T COMPLETENES S 559</p>
<p>gar Tshogdrug Rangdrol (1781-1850), a teacher of Alag Dongag Gyatso. Alag  had also studied with the great Patrul Rinpoche (1808-1887), author of the  recently translated Words of My Perfect Teacher, a richly storied discussion of the  foundational practices of Dzogchen. Alag and his own student, our author, the  third Dodrupchen, were both teachers of the four great abbots of Dodrupchen  Monastery. Dodrupchen himself studied with three of the most famous Nyingma  masters of the past century; in addition to Patrul Rinpoche, the prolific and bril liant philosopher Ju Mipham (1846-1912) and Mipham&rsquo;s extraordinary student,  Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892), were his teachers.</p>
<p>In all these ways, the narrative of Dodrupchen intertwines with the illustrious  history of Nyingma masters in eastern Tibet. Especially in the context of an eso teric and often philosophically abstract tradition like Dzogchen, it is important to  remember that its most venerated examplars, like Tibetan practitioners in general,  were deeply embedded in a familial and social context that grounded their en deavors.</p>
<p>The father of the third Dodrupchen was prophesied by Guru Rinpoche to be  Dudjom Lingpa, the first Dudjom Rinpoche (1835-1903). In this way, his family  position combined with his reincarnation lineage to allow him to be intimately  connected with both the Great Expanse and the Dudjom traditions, this latter  being another important Dzogchen lineage within Nyingma. The connection be</p>
<p>tween these lineages is replicated in the person of Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche,  whose oral commentary expands on the text translated here. Khetsun Rinpoche  teaches the Essential Heart tradition and constructed the Dudjom Temple in  Baudha, outside Kathmandu, now the site of a sacred reliquiry containing remains  of the second Dudjom Rinpoche, who died in 1987.</p>
<p>The third Dodrupchen incarnation, known as Jigme Denba Nyima (&lsquo;Jigs-med bstan-pa&rsquo;i nyi-ma, 1865-1926), was especially renowned for his ability to make  connections between the Tantric systems of Nyingma and the later schools of  Tibetan Buddhism. In Tibet it was common for even great scholars to restrict their  focus to works of their own orders, but Dodrupchen studied the writing of all  four Buddhist orders; the present Dalai Lama has called him the best scholar of  the commentarial literature in any of the Tibetan orders. The oral interpretative  tradition that began with Jigme Lingpa is still alive today. The fourth Dodrupchen,  Thubten Thrinley Palzang, is based in Gantok, Sikkhim, and visits the United  States every two years to teach at his center in western Massachusetts; the great  Dilgo Khentze Rinpoche was among the most prominent modern bearers of this  tradition.</p>
<p>Other important recent and contemporary teachers in this tradition include  Lama Gompo Tsayden (d. 1991) (himself a student of Dilgo Khentse Rinpoche)  whose students, especially a number of nun retreatants, still practice at his mon astery in Amdo; Tulku Thondup, considered a reincarnation of Konchog Dronme  (one of the four great abbots of Dodrupchen Monastery), currently a close asso ciate of the fourth Dodrupchen, and author/translator of the most authoritative  English works on this tradition; and Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche of Baudha, author</p>

<p>of a thirteen-volume work on Tibetan history who has taught widely in Japan,  France, and the United States, and has established a monastic training institute  outside Kathmandu, where he supports and trains Nyingma monks. Trulzhig  Rinpoche was invited by the Dalai Lama to represent the Nyingma school at the  historic Year of Tibet program held in New York&rsquo;s Madison Square Garden in  1991. He is currently abbot of Thupten Choling in Solo Kumbu, Nepal, the largest  monastery and nunnery in Nepal. Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche and Trulzhig Rin poche are the only senior lineage holders of certain Soaring Path practices which  originated with a former incarnation of Trulzhig Rinpoche known as Dongag  Trulzhig Lingpa.</p>
<p>Another senior yogin whose repertoire importantly includes the Heart Essence  tradition is Chatrul Rinpoche, now eighty-six and famous for, among many other  accomplishments, having spent six years prostrating his way from eastern to cen tral Tibet. He resides and teaches above the Kathmandu Valley, an area sacred to  Nyingma since Padamsambhava meditated in its caves in the seventh century. His  student Lama Tharchin Rinpoche founded a practice and study center near Santa  Cruz, California. Lama Tharchin is tenth in a lineage begun by Palchen Namkha  Jigme, who studied with the first Dodrupchen; he also teaches and maintains  practices from the Dudjom lineage. Nyo Shul Khen Rinpoche is another contem porary figure whose main tradition is the Essential Heart; he belongs to a branch  of the Kathog Monastery in East Tibet. Founded in 1109 by Kathogpa Tampa  Desheg, this is the oldest of the four principal Nyingma monasteries of Kham; its  main lineages are those associated with two great Treasure discoverers of the  seventeenth century, Dudul Dorje and Longsel Nyingpo. Active in Tibet today  are Khenbo Jigme Phuntsok Adzom Choktul Paylo Rinpoche, considered an in carnation of Jigme Lingpa as well as the son of the famous Adzom Drukpa (early  twentieth century), who received visionary transmission of the Heart Essence from  Jigme Lingpa. Essential Heart is also the lineage of Sogyal Rinpoche, founder of  Rig pa Fellowship. In the West, groups centered on this lineage include the  Dzogchen Foundation in Boston and Dawn Mountain in Houston; Tara Mandala  near Pagosa Springs, Colorado, often hosts teachers from this tradition as well.  The worldwide Dzogchen Community based in Conway, Massachusetts, founded  by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, also incorporates practices from this line age into its diverse liturgies</p>
<p>Introduction to the Text</p>
<p>In the Tibetan context, religious texts are not treated, like much of Western lit erature today, as independent emissaries, carrying their information to anyone  who takes them home and makes of them what she or he will. Rather, one is  introduced to a text - such as the one translated here - by a lama trained in its  traditions, whose oral commentary embroiders on the written words and whose  person is understood to embody the text&rsquo;s essential meaning of compassion and</p>
<p>TOPIC S O F THE GREA T COMPLETENES S 561</p>
<p>wisdom. On the advice of the Dalai Lama, I studied the present text in 1980, and  was fortunate to do so in conjunction with the oral instruction of Khetsun Sangpo  Rinpoche.</p>
<p>Assorted Topics of the Great Completeness (rDzogs chen thor bu) is one of Dod rupchen&rsquo;s shorter works. It contains three essays, the first of which is translated  here. In it, as the author himself states, he has &ldquo;amply applied&rdquo; what surfaced in  his mind without the apparatus of sutra quotations. In this way he crystallizes  basic principles of Great Completeness. Most important among these is that this  tradition, like Chan or Zen, understands the complete path to be already present  in one&rsquo;s own mind. The actual nature of the mind is regarded as the womb  igarbha) of one&rsquo;s own buddhahood, for a buddha is by definition one who has  gone (gatha) through and to that very nature. Such enlightened beings are there fore known as &ldquo;Ones [who have] Gone Thus&rdquo; (tathagathas), and one&rsquo;s own nature  is known as the tathagathagarbha. It is to be uncovered through meditating in  accordance with a text like this one.</p>
<p>The Great Completeness is a path of discovery, not the cultivation of newly  emerging qualities. It is a path that allows full openess to the mind-nature, or  base. It also involves becoming free from all the tendencies, or predispositions,  that are said to stain the mind-basis of all unenlightened beings. These predis</p>
<p>positions are the residue of past mental, verbal, or physical actions. Above all,  then, one seeks to discover one&rsquo;s own open awareness (rig pa). In this way, one  becomes aware of the base, one&rsquo;s actual nature, which is described as a union of  primordial purity, sometimes described as similar to the emptiness taught in Mid</p>
<p>dle Way (Madhyamika) philosophy, with the spontaneous occurence of whatever  qualities display themselves within the base. To discover this is to allow the nat ural, but usually thwarted, process of self-settling to unfold, in the same way that  the waves of a lake, which, if unstirred by winds or engines, will naturally subside.</p>
<p>This point is clear from the opening verses of the text. In accordance with time honored Buddhist custom, Dodrupchen begins with a verse of refuge in Manjusri  (also known as Manjughosa) usually described as the embodiment of all buddhas&rsquo;  wisdom. The author then immediately reframes this as a refuge not in an external  figure but in one&rsquo;s own open awareness. The full manifestation of this open aware ness, together with all its spontaneous good qualities, is tantamount to enlight enment. Because primordial wisdom (ye shes in Tibetan, jnana in Sanskrit) is a  full and natural settling into one&rsquo;s own deepest being, this open awareness is the  source of enlightenment. Through practice, this naturally open awareness (rig pa  in Tibetan, vedana in Sanskrit) can be distinguished experientially from the or dinary contrived and conceptual mind. Dodrupchen therefore points out that  recognizing rig pa is the true meaning of refuge in Manjughosa.</p>
<p>Like other Buddhist schools, Dzogchen often presents its teachings under the  three main headings of the base, path, and fruit. Our text focuses on the special  meaning of these terms in this tradition. Dodrupchen explains each in terms of  three adjectives associated with the name Manjughosa (&lsquo;Jam-dpal-ye-shes-sems</p>
<p>pa in Tibetan, Manjughosa or Manjusrl-kumara-bhuta in Sanskrit): smooth</p>
<p>562 ANNE CAROLYN KLEIN</p>
<p>(manju), splendid (ghosa), and fresh or youthful (gzhon nu in Tibetan, kumara in  Sanskrit). Like other Mahayana schools, Dzogchen recognizes that each buddha  has three dimensions or bodies (kayas). The emanation body, such as that dis played by Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, is what ordinary persons like our selves can see. Resplendent Dimension (sambhogakdya) buddhas manifest their  own pure lands, and there teach bodhisattvas who are highly developed enough  to see and hear them. Like the buddhas&rsquo; own bodies, these lands and all they  contain are made entirely of light, and are conjoined with the buddha&rsquo;s own mind nature, the formless Actual Dimension (dharmakaya) buddha from which the</p>
<p>other two emanate. All buddhas exist in all three dimensions.  The nature of the mind, also called the base, is the same whether one is en lightened or not: its natural freedom from conceptual dualistic appearance is its  smoothness; its external luminous manifestations are its splendor; and its unifi cation of primordial and spontaneous qualities are its freshness. To be fully pres ent to this basic nature is to recognize the great completeness of one&rsquo;s own being.  Such presence is always direct and experiential, never discursive or intellectual.  There are two methods for discovering and fully manifesting open awareness.  The first is known as the primordially pure Setting Free path, meaning that the  mind frees itself from its bonds of dualistic focusing on objects. This, according  to Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, is like cutting the rope around a stack of kindling - in one sense nothing changes, but the wood is no longer bound. This ease of  being is the path&rsquo;s smoothness. The path&rsquo;s splendor has to do with the second of  the Great Completeness practices, known as the Soaring path because, within the  primordial purity that characterizes the Setting Free path, a variety of appearances  spontaneously emerge, multicolored and moving. These are the light and splendor  intrinsic to one&rsquo;s own being. They are most elaborately described in the more  esoteric Dzogchen teachings of the Soaring path, and in descriptions of the various  light visions, especially of peaceful and wrathful deities, which occur in the in termediate state (bardo) between death in one life and birth in another. The Tibetan  Book of the Dead is the most famous exposition of these experiences in the West.  (In Tibet, it is only one, relatively obscure, volume in a vast literature devoted to  this topic). Indeed, the iconography of vision and a detailed concern with near death, bardo, and rebirth experiences, is a special feature of the Dzogchen school,  which was probably the first to introduce them in Tibet.</p>
<p>Dzogchen teaches that because these Soaring Path appearances are fundamen tally the same in nature as ordinary sensory appearances, it is possible for a fully  accomplished yogin to transform the physical body into a body of light, known  as a rainbow body. The accomplishment of such a rainbow body is considered a  unique effect of the Dzogchen path. The path&rsquo;s freshness refers to the vitality of  meditative experiences that emerge through Setting Free and Soaring. The fruit  or effect of the path is an open awareness in the continuum of one who has  smoothed away the obstructions to enlightenment: that open awareness is splen did because it is now embodied in the form of enlightened beings, and it is fresh  because it has a continuous clarity that never grows dull.</p>
<p>Our text combines language unique to the Great Completeness tradition with</p>
<p>TOPIC S O F TH E GREA T COMPLETENES S 563</p>
<p>occasional references to classic Middle Way philosophy. It is addressed primarily  to the yogin, rather than to the philosopher. It briefly indexes the types of med itative experience associated with the paths of Setting Free and Soaring. In ad dition to its descriptions of one&rsquo;s nature as smooth, splendid, and fresh, all of the  important terms of this text - open awareness mind nature (sems nyid), the natural  condition ignas lugs), appearance of light Cod), dynamic display (rtsal) - refer to  specific meditative experiences that have been known and described by practi tioners for centuries. It is obvious, yet worth reiterating, that these experiences  cannot be had by reading about them. Indeed, for most of us these special  Dzogchen words have no actual referent, or at best only an imaginary one. For  persons who have experientially identified their mind nature, the section describ ing the smoothness of the fruit is read as a set of explicit instructions for medi tation.</p>
<p>These later sections of the text also touch on the physiology fundamental both  to Tibetan esoteric practices and Tibetan medicine - descriptions of channels  within the body that are associated with the process of meditation. How exactly  does one gain open awareness, and what is its relationship to the ordinary mind?  Our text does not tell us; it assumes that this knowledge will have been received  already through other means, both oral and meditative. Thus, in a traditional  Tibetan context, none but initiated meditation practitioners would read a text  such as this. Nor would they read it on their own, left to construe it as they might.  Rather, they would study it with a teacher accomplished in both scholarship and  meditation, who would provide oral commentary, like the one included interli nearally here. And they would meditate. For such practitioners, the text helps  clarify the relationship and significance of their own meditative experiences. In  the altogether different academic context in which this text is now presented - through the generosity of several teachers of this tradition, especially Khetsun  Sangpo Rinpoche - it serves the entirely different function of providing a glimpse  into the vocabulary and structure of an ancient esoteric tradition that will be  taking its place among the vital living traditions of the twenty-first century.</p>

In order to give some flavor of the interplay between written  and oral traditions, small segments of Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche&rsquo;s commentary  on this work are included interlinearly. I have also included some remarks from  Lama Tharchin, who in 1984 kindly entertained numerous questions arising  from my work on this text, as well as insights provided by Tulku Thondup, author  of numerous works on this lineage; and the Dzogchen master Namkhai Norbu  Rinpoche.</p>

<p>Assorted Topics of the Great Completeness</p>
<p>Salutation</p>
<p>Acknowledging open awareness, I give homage to the primordially pure, stain less, and authentic (nyug ma) Manjughosa who is endowed with the splendor  of excellent, spontaneous appearance.</p>
<p>People like ourselves offer homage within a conventional perspective, bowing  down in a conventional sense with body, speech, and mind. The author&rsquo;s homage</p>
<p>TOPICS OF THE GREAT COMPLETENESS 565</p>
<p>is enacted within a recognition of the indivisibility of base and the fruit. These  are actually one taste, indivisible. Thus, although the author here makes homage  to Manjughosa, if he were thinking of a conventional Manjughosa, this would not  be an homage concordant with the ultimate or actual view; it would be an homage  made within a conventional perspective.</p>
<p>Promise to Compose</p>
<p>I will discuss the meaning of the name, Manju-sn-ghosa-jnana-manas-vira, &ldquo;he roic glorious mind, the smooth and splendid primordial wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Non-dualistic primordial wisdom, the enlightened mind of all Conquerors  [buddhas] without exception, is known as heroic mind, a primordially fresh  wisdom that is smooth and splendid. Because the buddhas&rsquo; primordial wisdom</p>
<p>is none other than the primordially free, spontaneously occurring, open aware ness, taking it as the path from now on is the way of the natural Great Com pleteness.</p>
<p>This path does not function as a cause (of wisdom) in the sense of virtuous action  leading to a positive effect, as in the theory of karma. In the Great Completeness,  to take the effect (wisdom) as the path means to recognize that the natural con dition of one&rsquo;s mind is obscured only by the adventitious obstructions that prevent  liberation (nyon sgrib) and omniscience (shes sgrib). These obstructions, consisting  of everything from gross nonvirtue to the most subtle tendency to perceive objects  as real, are in no way intrinsic to the mind. Like the sky, which is without any  obstructions whatever, the mind&rsquo;s actual nature is utterly clear. Because adven titious obstructions obscure our actual nature, practitioners seek to abandon them  and accumulate the collections of merit and wisdom. However, from the view point of its own way of being, the actual nature is beyond conventions of &ldquo;some thing to be abandoned or achieved&rdquo; and &ldquo;someone who abandons or achieves.&rdquo;  The topics to be understood regarding this state are the base, path, and fruit.</p>
<p>A. EXPLAINING THE MEANING OF THE BASE AND ITS DESCRIPTION AS SMOOTH,  SPLENDID, AND FRESH</p>
<p>SMOOTH</p>
<p>Smoothness is the primordially pure essence (ngo bo), the actuality (chos nyid)  of all phenomena. It is beginninglessly free from the eight elaborated extremes  [described in detail in Madhyamika] of production, cessation, permanence,  annihilation, coming, going, being one, or being many because [the base and  its primordial purity] impartially pervade, without any bias, all phenomena,  from forms through to omniscient consciousnesses. There is no phenomenon,  not even the merest atom, which is otherwise.</p>
<p>566 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN</p>
<p>The base is the same for unenlightened sentient beings and for buddhas. The  &ldquo;time of the base&rdquo; (zhi dus) occurs when one is neither in cyclic existence nor  nirvana; neither a buddha nor a sentient being. When primodial wisdom arises  from this base, one is a buddha; when ignorance arises, a sentient being. (Lama  Tharchin)</p>
<p>The difference between being enlightened or not lies with whether or not one  realizes the natural state which is the actuality of one&rsquo;s base. However, even when  we are born into cyclic existence, born into the mud of desire, hatred, and ig norance, the actuality of our own minds, like the lotus flower, is not covered by  the defilement of mud. The mind&rsquo;s natural state is utterly without contrivance,  and self-settled. It is [the ordinary consciousness] relaxed into its own nature.  The emptiness that is the actuality of one&rsquo;s own mind (rang gi sems gyi chos nyid  stong ba nyid) is the nature of all buddhas. It is not newly established but has  existed all along, for it is the completely present base which is the tathagatagarbha  element in all living beings.</p>
<p>Since [the essence] has neither production nor true establishment, how would  even lack of production be imputed in relation to it? In the view [of the Great  Completeness], this essence is beyond conventions of understanding, expres sion, and use.</p>
<p>All worldly beings live within the conventions of knowing, expressing, and un derstanding. To say &ldquo;the name of this is water&rdquo; allows you to understand some thing as water; it is a correct convention. However conventions cannot express  the ultimate, actual state.</p>
<p>This base is free from the various predispositions on the basis of all (kun gzhi  in Tibetan, alayvijnana in Sanskrit), and from all that remains of those predis positions [that is, the body]. It is also free from the minds and mental evolutes</p>
<p>(sems las byung ba) of the three realms, as well as from ignorance.  Even though errors arise as its dynamic display, [open awareness] is not  covered by the stains of error, just as even when clouds arise in the sky, the  sky is not covered by them. Because the internal sky (dbyings in Tibetan, dhatu  in Sanskrit), having no foundation and no root, is free from the roughness of  any sign [of conceptuality, therefore the base that is united with one&rsquo;s own  aware presence] is called smooth.</p>
<p>SPLENDID</p>
<p>What is splendid? Your own spontaneous nature [is splendid]. The ocean of  divine figures and the primordially fresh consciousness is neither sought else where nor newly established, but is complete where it rests. Thus, even though,  in terms of how [phenomena] appear [apparent] impurities do arise; in terms  of how it is (gnas tshul), [open awareness] is established as a great primordial  wisdom. [Therefore, the way the mind appears and its genuine state are dif-TOPICS OF THE GREAT COMPLETENESS 567</p>
<p>ferent.] The mind&rsquo;s essence neither improves when errors are purified nor  worsens when adventitious obstructions occur due to error.  In terms of its appearance, because [open awareness] dawns as outgoing  energy (thugs rje), compassion (snying rje) emerges for all living beings. Be cause [open awareness] dawns as light, there shine rays having the nature of  the five primordial wisdoms. Because [open awareness] dawns as primordially  fresh consciousness, it dwells in an innate open awareness purified of mental  stains. Because [open awareness] dawns as the figures of deities, space brims  with deities of purest (dangs ma) clear light.</p>
<p>To say that open awareness &ldquo;appears as light&rdquo; refers to a meditative experience  (mnyam) of light shining forth. This light is actually the radiance of the five pri mordial wisdoms that shine through the empty actuality of one&rsquo;s own mind. They  are the glow of primordial wisdom.</p>
<p>Because open awareness dawns nondualistically, there is no holding onto same ness or difference. Because open awareness is free from extreme positions, the  primordial wisdom which is the complete base appears in its own clarity. Be cause it dawns as primordially pure wisdom, the appearance of nirvana is un ceasing; because it dawns as impure cyclic existence, the six realms of rebirth  appear like illusions.</p>
<p>The precious interiority - that is, the spontaneously occurring base - serves  as a base for appearances through the eight doors. Because this becomes the  base for the good qualities of liberation, it is known as &ldquo;splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FRESH</p>
<p>Internal karmic winds act as the root of the contaminated mind. Due to their  movement, you are trapped in cyclic existence as if inside a vase. Yet, contam ination does not enter one&rsquo;s actual nature (chos nyid in Tibetan, dharmata in  Sanskrit). Your actual nature has a freshness that is a deathless permanence, a  stability without illness, freedom from aging and deterioration; a freshness that  is utterly beyond momentary change. Because [the natural condition of mind  is] an amalgamation of all unsurpassed good qualities, it has the meaning of  heap or kaya, this is what it means to call [a buddha manifestation] a body.  The word &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; in the [Dzogchen] phrase, &ldquo;fresh and vaselike body&rdquo; signifies  the union of primordial purity and spontaneous occurrence.</p>
<p>It is called a &ldquo;vase&rdquo; in the sense of containing everything, with nothing lacking.  (Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche)</p>
<p>B. AN INDICATION OF PATHS AS SMOOTH, SPLENDID, AND FRESH</p>
<p>SMOOTH</p>
<p>The first of these, smoothness, has to do with the principle of the path of Setting  Free (khregs chod). One gains certainty in the view that the mind of enlight-</p>
<p>568 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN</p>
<p>enment itself - the open awareness in which there is no occurrence whatever  of anything that goes under the rubric of either the afflicted or the purified - is a great expanse free from extremes. For one who relies on the essential  precepts on meditation and behavior, all appearances (such as sights, sounds,  and other knowable things) emerge as aids [to one&rsquo;s practice, rather than as  distractions from it].</p>
<p>Once you have experienced your own open awareness, you seek to maintain  unwaveringly the continuum of mindfulness and awareness of the natural state  of your own mind, regardless of what types of conceptual thoughts arise. All  these thoughts, like wood taken for fire, only help your awareness: they do not  do it any harm.</p>
<p>When one relaxes freely in the great primordial spacious expanse of an au thentic self-settling, [one is] unimpeded and without activity. Like a thief en tering an empty house [which he neither harms nor helps], there is neither  the establishment of good thoughts nor the elimination of bad ones; these are  the dynamic display [of open awareness].</p>
<p>Therefore, like whirling a lance in empty space, [such thoughts] neither help  nor harm [open awareness], nor does one have any grasping inclination either  to be free of appearing objects or to engage with them or anything whatsoever  that appears at the [sense] doors. Like a lion at whom a stone is thrown, one  investigates the source [of conceptuality] itself. In this way, all thought accu</p>
<p>mulations are primordially liberated and smoothly vanish into the expanse of  equality, so that appearances to the six collections [of consciousnesses, con sisting of the five senses and the mind] become aids to the primordial wisdom.</p>
<p>If one throws a stone at a lion, he goes after the person who threw it, unlike a  dog, who ignores the threatening person and just chases after the stone. In a  similar fashion, if when thoughts arise one thinks &ldquo;This is an excellent thought&rdquo;  or &ldquo;This is a terrible thought&rdquo; one is like the dog who observes where the stone  has fallen. Correct meditation will not come at all. Like the lion, we should attend  to the source, where the thoughts came from.</p>
<p>At that time, do not bind with [a beginner&rsquo;s] stringent mindfulness the pure  meditative experiences which are the sapience of Samantabhadra, and do not  provide causal conditions for ordinary error. Without placing yourself in chains  of stubborn bondage, and without entering through the narrow aperture of a  meditation focused on objects, maintain a continuity of great ease, looseness,  self-settling, relaxation, and liberation. Because [the path-aware open aware</p>
<p>ness which maintains the mind-and-body continuum in this way] is free from  the rough touch of a conception which adheres [to objects], it is called smooth.</p>
<p>When the eyes focus, you have valid cognition in the sense that the object you  observe is valid. However, although such seeing is valid in terms of the world,  when it comes to the view of Dzogchen, it is like a harmful poison. Whenever</p>
<p>TOPIC S O F TH E GREA T COMPLETENES S 569</p>
<p>valid cognition focuses on an object, some conception of a self still remains. Even  this valid cognizer is a grasping; therefore, it is necessary to eliminate completely  all valid cognizers that focus on objects.</p>
<p>Conceptual thoughts are always arising. We cannot be free of them. You need  to distinguish between the [ordinary] way of thinking and the instructions on  mindfulness of the natural state.</p>
<p>SPLENDID</p>
<p>The meaning of &ldquo;splendid&rdquo; has to do with Soaring. When one takes up any of  the postures - that of the lion, elephant, or sage - the very clear channels of  light that are the [1] watery luminosity of expansiveness [that is, the eyes] are  directed upward, downward, or straight ahead. Thereby the [2] pure-space luminosity initially appears as a pervasive deep blue light. Then, from this,  within a circle of five colored lights are arrayed the five groups of [3] empty  orbs of luminosity. In between these are the [4] self-arisen-wisdom luminosi</p>
<p>ties [a series of shapes appearing as] a vajra (diamond-like) chain, laid out like  a string of pearls, or as a golden chain. These are the radiance of the innately  clear, spontaneously perfected open awareness which is the primordial wisdom  of open awareness in its own place.</p>
<p>These last three [namely, the pure-space-luminosity, the empty-drop lumi nosity, and the self-arisen wisdom luminosities that appear as the vajra chain]  will become, respectively, causes for the pure land, palatial residence, and body  of [yourself as] a buddha. In addition to these four luminosities there is the  [5] heat-flesh luminosity and [6] the luminosity of the soft white channel, also  called a &ldquo;crystal piping.&rdquo; When one adds these two, which have clear hollow  insides, there come to be six luminosities.</p>
<p>In addition to these six, there are three [additional luminosities], adding up  to nine. These are: [7] the precious primordial wisdom that is a union of  emptiness and clarity - this is renowned as the basic luminosity, the natural  condition; [8] the intermediate state (bardo) luminosity, whose internal radi</p>
<p>ance, shining externally, is an appearance of the base during the intermediate  state; and [9] the effect luminosity, which is the hollow interiority of the spon taneously occuring completion. However, the luminosities occasioned on the  path are those explained above [as the nine luminosities].</p>
<p>In this way, through the hidden and manifest doors, and through the treasure  comprised of the secret qualities of the Ones Gone Thus, you manifestly see  the appearance of the body and land of a Conqueror, and hear the intrinsic  sound of your actual nature. Therefore, [the open awareness that is the path]  is called &ldquo;splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FRESH</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freshness&rdquo; is a meditative experience of union. The current open awareness  is not illustrated by ordinary examples. Beyond verbal exprssion, it is free from</p>
<p>570 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN</p>
<p>the bondage of hope and fear, a union of open awareness and emptiness that  dwells [in a manner] free from [the ordinary] mind.</p>
<p>The initial seeing of the vajra chain-continuum, which is the radiance of  open awareness, is the actual nature [of open awareness] become manifest [and  is the first of the four levels of the spontaneous Soaring path (thod rgal)]. When  the appearances, which are light, become clearer, and appearances of orbs of  light increase further, the vajra chain-continuum becomes steady. When, at  the end [of this level], one sees the unaccompanied [Buddha] bodies, one has  arrived at the second level of the spontaneous Soaring path known as the  &ldquo;increase of experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When there is only one figure appearing, this is like half of the increase of clear  appearance. It is not the end. This has to do with the degree to which the mind  is accustomed to this practice.</p>
<p>From the time when the bodies become joined in union until all appearances  are perceived as clear light is the third level of the Soaring path called the &ldquo;full  measure of open awareness.&rdquo; [At that time] the external, the internal, as well  as the secret (respectively, the material body, the mind&rsquo;s mass of thoughts, and  the manner of appearance of the bodies and luminous orbs) are extinguished  into the actual nature. This is an extinguishing into what is beyond mind [and  the fourth level of the Soaring path known as] the extinguishing into the actual  nature.</p>
<p>At this time, one&rsquo;s own material body becomes almost like a rainbow. Sun light passes through it, leaving no shadow. Thoughts and predispositions for  thoughts are extinguished, as are the appearances of deities&rsquo; form, the drops,  and primordial wisdom, and so forth. This is the extinguishing that is beyond  mind.</p>
<p>If one who has gained power over birth [and death] wishes to effect the  welfare of all beings through arising in the body of the Great Transformation  (&lsquo;pho chen), then at the time of gradually extinguishing appearances, one arises  in a rainbow form. One does this by focusing open awareness on the five fingers  of one&rsquo;s hand, which appear as light.</p>
<p>Nyingmas consider the body of Great Transformation to be the superior of three  types of rainbow bodies; it is this that Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra are said  to have attained. This rainbow form (ja&rsquo; sku) is not to be confused with &lsquo;ja&rsquo; lus,  usually translated as &ldquo;rainbow body.&rdquo; Those with rainbow bodies are said to  disappear into another dimension, whereas the practitioner of the Great Trans</p>
<p>formation creates a unique body of light that can appear to others for their benefit,  and even if, due to lack of suitable disciples, it does not manifestly appear for  some time, it does not entirely disappear. (Tulku Thondup)</p>
<p>If one&rsquo;s body does not effect great waves [of activities] for others&rsquo; benefit  through gaining power with respect to engagement, one at that point disap-</p>
<p>TOPIC S O F TH E GREA T COMPLETENES S 571</p>
<p>pears into the spacious expanse of the original sphere, just like mist evaporat ing. This is extinguishment into the natural state, the aware presence ready to  unite with the final fruit. Because stainless and extraordinary meditative ex periences open up at those times like a fresh young flower, open awareness,  the path which is a union of primordial purity and spontaneous occurence is  called &ldquo;fresh,&rdquo; like a youthful person of great zest.</p>
<p>C. HOW THE FRUITS [OF THE PATH] ARE SMOOTH, SPLENDID, AND FRESH</p>
<p>SMOOTH</p>
<p>What is its smoothness? Abandonment of (1) desire and so forth that obstruct  liberation and (2) adherence to uncontaminated phenomena and so forth that  obstruct omniscience, together with the very subtle karmic inner winds [as sociated with them]. Smoothness is [also] the progressive pacification of all  characteristics of [a grasping] mind, the clearing away of all adherence to du alistic conceptions right where they are.</p>
<p>Because one is free of that which obstructs the actual nature of the natural  nirvana [through which one attains buddhahood], the nirvana purified of ad ventitious [obstructions] becomes manifest. The four demons are overcome.  These are: (1) the demon that is the contaminated aggregates, (2) the demon  that is the lord of death, cutting off one&rsquo;s lifetime; (3) the demon of the afflic tions, that prevents liberation, and (4) the god-child demon that is the inter ferences [preventing] attainment of enlightenment. One is freed from all elab orations of existence, nonexistence, &ldquo;is,&rdquo; &ldquo;is not,&rdquo; and so forth, and is immersed  in the total attainment of the great spacious sphere of neither production nor  cessation. Being free from the rough feel of obstructions [to liberation and  omniscience], the resulting open awareness is smooth.</p>
<p>SPLENDID</p>
<p>What is splendid? [A Buddha&rsquo;s omniscience that] simultaneously knows how  and what things are and that manifests the twenty-one types of primordial  wisdom knowing the stainless. In the Magnificently Ornamented Highest Pure  Land [oneself, as a buddha] appears in great resplendence (sambhoga), pos</p>
<p>sessed of the seven qualities of being (1) greatly enjoyable, (2) a conjoining  [of method and wisdom], (3) great bliss, (4) without inherent existence, (5)  fully compassionate, (6) an uninterrupted continuum, and (7) ceaseless.</p>
<p>In the Pure Land of Natural Emanations, the appearances of the teacher - the Form Conqueror, Feeling Conqueror, Compositional Factor Conqueror,  Discrimination Conqueror, and Consciousness Conqueror - appear in their  own way. Thereby, by acting for the sake of pure disciples who appear in other  retinues, a Resplendent Buddha which is half an Emanation Buddha [appears];  and, for the sake of impure disciples, there are emanations such as art [trees,  statues, images], rebirth and so forth, effecting the welfare of living beings.</p>
<p>572 ANN E CAROLY N KLEIN</p>
<p>The five Conquerors refer to the purification in their own place of the five ordinary  aggregates - form, feeling, and so forth. The effect of this purification is that they  now appear as buddhas. The last, the Consciousness Conqueror, refers to the  purification of all thoughts, in their own place.</p>
<p>This Resplendent dimension is a great spontaneous activity; it is neither spo radic, biased, nor bound by effortful thought. Finding this very profound and  extensive body is an unsurpassed treasure of good qualities, and for this reason  [the aware presence which is the effect] is called splendid.</p>
<p>FRESH</p>
<p>The meaning of [the fruit&rsquo;s] freshness is this. The dissolution of all appearances  of dynamic display into the spacious expanse free of extremes and center - into the actual nature - is the very secret, precious, spontaneously perfected  interiority. It is also the great unchanging, unceasing, indestructible subtle  wisdom. Moreover, one&rsquo;s great omniscience is completed as a clarity undar</p>
<p>kened by the obscurations of sleep, fainting, lack of discriminatory capacity,  or the two absorptions. One has abandoned even the most subtle production  [of thoughts] in the manner of ordinary mentality as well as inconceivably  subtle movements [of the winds]. Therefore, [the open awareness which is  your own omniscient mind] is permanent and pure, possessing an unchange</p>
<p>ability as extensive as space.</p>
<p>Consider this somewhat extreme example: if you meet a person who does  not age, it is suitable to say that such a person remains perpetually youthful.  The completed fresh and vaselike body is said to be like that.</p>
<p>Through these [explanations], I have indicated the Great Completeness  which is smooth and splendid.</p>
<p>The Great Completeness, open awareness and emptiness,</p>
<p>Free from mind, smooth and splendid,</p>
<p>Unspeakable, inconceivable, inexpressible,</p>
<p>Is the actual profound and natural condition.</p>
<p>In consonance with Words provided by my omnipresent Lama  I have made a very brief clarification</p>
<p>By which virtue may those with minds, extensive as space,  Become Conquerors over all bonds of mental analysis</p>
<p>And see, in the manner of sightless vision,</p>
<p>Manjusri, in whose aware presence</p>
<p>Cyclic existence and nirvana are not separate.</p>
<p>Due to the injunctions that came my way from the mouth of the precious  omnipresent Lama to do this I, Jigme, leaving aside elaborations such as the  use of scriptural quotations, amply applied whatever I remembered.</p>
