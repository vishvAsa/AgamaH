<p>Death and dying are significant topics for all religions, including Buddhism. When  Tantra was the dominant form of Buddhism in both northern India and Tibet,  Buddhists displayed a voracious curiosity about this topic. Ritual and meditational  materials show a variety of methods for dealing with the process of decline and  death.</p>
<p>Sometime before the year 1000, Tantric teachings that dealt with preparation  for death, cremation, and so forth, had been organized into cycles. One group is  a set of teachings by Atisa, an eleventh-century Buddhist master from Bengal, on  the goddess Tara, called the &ldquo;Thirteen Spells.&rdquo; These teachings provide instruction  in recognizing and preparing for death, as well as in perpetuating the practice of  merit making, a process that allows a Buddhist to accrue merit for spiritual im</p>
<p>provement and then selflessly to transfer that merit to beings who are not in a  position to obtain such merit. (Tara and the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara are Bud dhist deities who model and display selfless compassion to suffering sentient  beings, and thus are especially to be sought at times of physical danger and  distress.) Six of these teachings, including one entitled &ldquo;Cheating Death&rdquo; (mrtyu vancana in Sanskrit, &lsquo;Chi bslu in Tibetan) deal with the human lifespan, its length ening, decline, and end. The first teaching is an introduction to the significance  of the spells; the last is on the casting and distribution of tsha tshas, small, usually  circular pressed sacred images made in part from the ashes of the dead, which  are designed to generate merit continuously. By the fourteenth century, such ritual  instructions had attained great size, as exemplified by Karma Gling-pa&rsquo;s gatherings  in the Bar do thos grol cycles. The literal title of these texts, which teach people  how to avoid an evil rebirth, is &ldquo;Release from the Intermediate State by Merely  Hearing These Teachings.&rdquo; Selections from this cycle have been studied and pub lished as &ldquo;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&rdquo;; in fact, the cycles total many hundreds  of pages in length. It is these cycles that include sections devoted to &ldquo;cheating  death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to eight texts on &ldquo;cheating death&rdquo; found in the Tantra commentary</p>
<p>606 MICHAE L WALTER</p>
<p>section of the Tibetan canon - all taught by or connected with Vagisvarakirti, a  predecessor of Atisa as abbot at the Nalanda monastery and the author of the text  studied here - various recipes, instructions, and rites, with accompanying anec dotal materials and fulsome praises, are also found embedded in medical, al chemical, and Tantric ritual materials. In addition, much supporting anecdotal  and mythological material is also found in histories of Tibetan Buddhist traditions,  biographies of yogins, and even general sketches of the development of Buddhism.  This is because &ldquo;cheating death&rdquo; helps one to continue exercising the vows of a  bodhisattva, a Buddhist who has taken a vow to aid suffering sentient beings to  achieve enlightenment.</p>
<p>The goal of Mahayana Buddhism is enlightenment, with a view to universal  enlightenment: that is, to become enlightened, but to do so in order to help fill  the universe with other enlightened sentient beings who see existence as it is, and  who act selflessly and with compassion because they share the realization of the  Buddha about the nature of all things. The Mahayana view of the nature of things  is that samsara, the endless cycle of births that unenlightened sentients go  through, and nirvana, release from samsara, are ultimately mere concepts of the  unenlightened mind, and are empty of reality. They are, instead, of the nature of  Voidness (sunyata). Insight into the true nature of Voidness is achievable because  we have the Buddha nature within us, and there is a variety of ways in which  Mahayana Buddhist traditions teach its realization. The present text comes from  the Tantric tradition, which aims its followers at buddhahood itself, at realizing  the fully developed Buddha nature within us.</p>
<p>Tantra, which has been practiced in Hinduism and Buddhism for centuries, is  a set of practices based on two principles. The first is that of subtle physiology.  The body exists on a series of vibrational levels, and our physical body is the  lowest of those levels. We also contain what might be called a subtle body, which  consists of channels through which flow our life energy and our consciousness,  the latter in what are described as &ldquo;winds.&rdquo; To understand our true nature - the  goal of this yoga - we must gain control over the elements (water, air, fire, earth,  and &ldquo;ether,&rdquo; that is, space) of which we are made, and the winds just described.  The cosmos is made up of these same elements, and the second principle states  that the structure and function of our subtle body parallels the greater structures  of the cosmos: the planets, stars, constellations, and so forth. This second prin ciple, sometimes referred to as a system of macrocosmic and microcosmic cor</p>
<p>respondences, allows the yogin to escape human finitude by understanding how  both his individual body and the cosmos are ruled by the same processes.  In terms of dying, a yogin must know how to overcome his internal &ldquo;time&rdquo;  mechanism - what we call aging - by controlling it in the same way that Bud dhism and Hinduism believe that external time can be stopped: by stopping the  motion of the sun and moon. The yogin does this internally, in the present text,  by meditating on deities who represent the reality behind the internal sun and  moon, respectively: red Amitabha, the buddha of infinite light, and white Abhaya  Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. (Of course,CHEATIN G DEAT H 607</p>
<p>people also die from accidents, and so on; such deaths are explained in this text  as death &ldquo;coming from the gods.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The sun dries, burns, and robs beings of their energy. Thus, the yogin&rsquo;s &ldquo;internal  sun&rdquo; also causes the desiccation of his life force; at one point this text advises the  yogin to shield his nutritive moisture, called &ldquo;ambrosia,&rdquo; from that sun, since we  are all born with this ambrosia and it has the potential to give us eternal life if  we protect it from our internal sun and open the body up to its flow. Similarly,  our ambrosia originates near the top of our skull, dripping from our internal  moon. Thus, the way Tantra visualizes internalized universal processes is by ori</p>
<p>enting them around the body, especially in power centers aligned along the spinal  cord.</p>
<p>Astrological correspondences are an important part of Tantra yoga. The spinal  cord is a &ldquo;cosmic pillar&rdquo; as well, perhaps (from an astrological point of view), as  the Milky Way, around which two &ldquo;veins&rdquo; representing the paths of the sun  (heating and drying) and the moon (cooling and moist) twine themselves. These  paths are actually the channels by which breath enters, in the yogin&rsquo;s practice,  through either the left or right nostril, and exits through the opposite nostril. The  breath thereby passes through both the solar and lunar paths, as well as through  the constellations, which are conceived to be located on the twelve &ldquo;petals&rdquo; of  that circle which, at the level of the heart, is usually conceived to be a lotus. When  the yogin controls the powers of the sun and moon, and then unites them, he  overcomes their grip on his life-breath and ambrosia, and takes in his grasp the  very process of time in the universe. This also provides the yogin with the ex perience of ultimate transcendence (&ldquo;enlightenment,&rdquo; in Buddhist terms). Tantric  yogins with perfect practice do not, in fact, die, but pass into subtle bodies that  are eternal; the Knowledge Holders in Part Three below are one such group of  yogins.</p>
<p>The yogin must calculate the time at which the sun passes through the twelve  houses of his zodiac; as the text shows, it has a set time for transiting, or crossing,  each of these; variations can affect the power or length of life of the yogin. The  yogin should also analyze both outer and inner astrological systems to understand  propitious and nonpropitious times for meditations, and so on, as well as personal  traits (such as susceptibility to illness, and preferred seasons and times of the day  to do things) and changes in his internal states. The yogin&rsquo;s universe becomes  divided into two-hour intervals (the six transits of both the sun and mooon  through the signs of the zodiac in a twenty-four-hour day) as well as time intervals  based on the control of the circulation of this breath. Through continual attention  to these processes, he escapes the control of the sun and signs of the zodiac, and  controls the winds that suppport his mind and consciousness.</p>
<p>In fact, the ultimate reason why the yogin engages in this yoga is to purify his  consciousness; he uses his control over the heat of his inner sun to cleanse the  impurities in the winds that shape that consciousness. Unenlightened conscious ness is prevented from realizing its enlightened nature because of these impurities,  whereas through these practices they are gradually removed, if the yogin controls</p>
<p>608 MICHAE L WALTER</p>
<p>each inhalation and exhalation in what Buddhism calls a mindfulness yoga cen tered on the observation and regulation of breathing.</p>
<p>Mention was made above of the Buddha nature within us; Buddhist Tantra  develops this through spiritual cultivation (sadhana). A repetition of the &ldquo;seed&rdquo;  syllable of a deity will actualize it and bring it clearly into the yogin&rsquo;s conscious ness, so that the deity will merge with the yogin, and become the true &ldquo;self of  the yogin. This process is accompanied by yogic postures (asanas) and gestures  (mudras), and sometimes dance. This deity represents enlightened being, and the  consciousness of the yogin also becomes enlightened, through two stages of prac tice: these are the development and perfection of the presence of the deity, fol lowed by the dissolution of that deity, such that the yogin comes to realize the  Voidness (sunyata) from which all things - even Buddhas - emerge and back into  which they dissolve.</p>
<p>It is partly because of the refined state of a yogin&rsquo;s consciousness through this  practice, and partly due to the homologous system described above, that dreams,  omens, and such as presented in the text here provide insight into the yogin&rsquo;s  physical and meditative states. Furthermore, Tantric &ldquo;subtle physiology&rdquo; provides  the link between an individual&rsquo;s meditative and visionary experiences and the  external signs that are meaningful for events transpiring in a yogin&rsquo;s practice.</p>
<p>Buddhism does not depend solely on Tantra and its yogic practices to lengthen  life, or even to attain immortality. Elixirs based on organic ingredients, as well as  mercury- and sulphur-based compounds, are also used, as in Western alchemy.  Even Buddhist medical traditions contain compounds designed to lengthen life.  The effectiveness of many of these preparations rests either on the meditative  practices that accompany their creation or on the &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; of compounds  through a blessing by a master, such as when he blows on it. Power over life is  also attained by the yogin through sexual activity with an accomplished consort.  By retaining his semen, the yogin reverses the normal bodily processes; and, here,  as described in Part Three, special power comes from bodily fluids generated  during sexual union. Acts of devotion also have a place here: we see that building  and restoring stupas, circular structures that are circumambulated to gain merit  and show respect for the Buddha, are also means to achieve a longer life. (Stupas  have a central wooden pole, analogous to the spinal column and here called the  &ldquo;life-tree pole,&rdquo; which is an auspicious object when viewed in a dream). In Part  Three, we see that simply contributing a robe to a monk creates sufficient merit  to hold death at bay.</p>
<p>In addition, it is maintained in many sources that advanced yogins can create  elixirs or obtain other powers (as mentioned here, an enchanted sword and med icine for the eyes afford the yogin the power to see through matter and the ability  to travel long distances rapidly) as a routine benefit of advanced practices. These  are known as &ldquo;accomplishments&rdquo; (siddhis), which the yogin is eventually to dis card as he procedes to complete enlightenment, since to concentrate on them  would be a sign of the yogin&rsquo;s clinging to his ego rather than eradicating it totally.  Much of what has been presented here applies to both Hindu and Buddhist</p>
<p>CHEATIN G DEAT H 609</p>
<p>Tantra. The truly Buddhist elements in these teachings come out both in the  visualization of Buddhist spiritual beings, such as Amitabha (buddha of infinite  light), and Amrtakundalin (who represents the process of uniting the sun and  moon, and causing the ambrosia to flow), as well as in the centrality of Sunyata  and belief in the creation and transfer of merit.</p>
<p>The selections below come from the most extensive teaching in the Tibetan  canon on &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; or &ldquo;tricking&rdquo; death. It was composed by Vagisvarakirti, and  must have been a standard Buddhist work on the subject - first in India, and  later, through Atisa, in Tibet - but one filled with uncertainties of interpretation,  since a second translation of this text, also found in the canon, is supplemented  with many interlinear notes. The material here is presented with some interpre tation from those notes and other commentaries. These teachings mix divinatory  practices, astrological guidance (most of the materials not included here were  detailed astrological calculations), and Tantric practices, in a set of indications of  death and how to avoid it, especially intended for yogins but also for lay Buddhists  in their analysis of dreams, visions, internal changes, and so on.</p>
<p>The material presented here is a translation of excerpts from the Teaching on  Cheating Death (&lsquo;Chi ba bslu ba&rsquo;i man ngag in Tibetan, Mrtyuvancanopadesa in San skrit) by Vagisvarakirti, as found in The Tibetan Tripitaka, Bstan-hgyur, vol. 59,  pp. 103-110, and in the Sde-dge Bstan &lsquo;Gyur, Rgyud &lsquo;Grel, vol. 27, columns 236- 66, along with a few elucidations from various commentaries. This work is di vided into four parts: external signs of death; internal signs of death; instructions  for cheating death by external means; and instructions for internal means for  cheating death.</p>

<p>PART ONE</p>
<p>[The work opens with an homage to Manjusri, the bodhisattva who bequeaths  wisdom, especially that connected with traditional sciences.]</p>
<p>The Lord of Death manifests all variety of illusion; the answer to this is to  achieve power over old age and death. This teaching being difficult to grasp  by those of inferior intellect - whose minds vacillate - attaining power over  the Lord of Death and the signs of death, the texts on death, and their com</p>
<p>mentaries, will be explained here.</p>
<p>Total cheating of the Lord of Death is the realm of liberation itself; extending  for some short time the lives of all sentients is not being liberated. The ceasing  of life-duration, the senses, and the working of the mind is the characteristic  of death. Living on for some time through various means has been explained  to be &ldquo;the cheating of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disciplining the senses through practicing the Dharma, one will live as long  as he wishes in samsara; for that long, one accumulates merit, and so on. Acting  so as to cultivate the thought of enlightenment, it will truly arise. So, not seeing  anything more dear than life in samsara, quickly and by many means one will  act habitually to deceive death. Applying means in the right way to this end,  it is not at all difficult to achieve. By the powers of precious stones, spells, and  medicines, a person realizes anything he wishes.</p>
<p>Signs that death is approaching should be understood by any means neces sary. Although some develop the desire to know the signs of death, there may  also well be hesitation by others about such objects of knowledge, because  these latter are then in a state of well-being. However, when those people who  were well become controlled by painful states, passions, dimness of mind, and  so on, and as a consequence of the fear, suffering, and so on that arise from  those symptoms, signs of death will of course manifest themselves to those  people, as well.</p>
<p>Through a division into outer and inner, it is intended that the signs of death  are to be analyzed as twofold, the upsetting of the gods and the upsetting of  the elements. Dying from the total upsetting of the gods is explained to be  &ldquo;coming from the gods&rdquo;; famine and so on, and lightning, hail, and so on, are  the signs of their being upset. Dying from the total upsetting of the elements  is explained to be &ldquo;coming from the elements.&rdquo; When the elements are upset,  bile, and so on, and the fire and water elements, and so on, are damaged. When  both are upset, death is explained as &ldquo;coming from both.&rdquo; When both are upset,  [there is] thunder, and so on, and bile, phlegm, and so on, are damaged.</p>
<p>Although one may see signs of death at any time, at some times they show  that death is not coming; in an unerring way, they can be examined [by the  yogin] for impediments that damage one&rsquo;s practice of the Dharma. Likewise,</p>
<p>CHEATIN G DEAT H 611</p>
<p>any time that one does not see signs of death, even at some of those times  death will appear. At such times, in the lack of [appearance of] a fixed time  for death, it is not that there is a lack of signification concerning a fixed time  for one&rsquo;s death [that is, there are always signs, if one knows how to look for  them].</p>
<p>When the yogin is permanently established in equanimity, with his mind  accordingly placed in one-pointedness by that practice, he should first closely  examine, briefly, the external signs.</p>
<p>[What follows here is an excursus on searching for external signs of death.]</p>
<p>The transiting of the sun, the fifteenth lunar day, and so on, may result in that  illness, and so on, suddenly becoming one&rsquo;s master.</p>
<p>When the time of death is explained to be &ldquo;certain,&rdquo; it is not certain only  insofar as there is a mistaken understanding of the signs of death. [For ex ample,] when the far side of one&rsquo;s left cheek shakes, that is a very strong  indicator of death. When one&rsquo;s inner winds and a feeling of cold rush together,  however, one must search elsewhere for any signs of death.</p>
<p>Signs of death appear in the house of Cancer, in the middle summer month,  and in Capricorn, proceeding through the middle month of winter. On the day  of the sun&rsquo;s transit, in the middle month of summer, the measure of its foot  [that is, the angle of its rays] is at midday; when one looks to the north then,  the shadow there is the true nature [of his lifespan]. On the exact day of transit  in the middle winter month, there are seven measures to its foot; at noon of  that day, if the sky is clear, one should examine his shadow.</p>
<p>For each month there is an increase of one foot, and [then] there is a decrease  of one. If anything other than this is seen, the yogin should truly fear death.  From the middle summer month until Capricorn, the sun&rsquo;s foot increases.  From Capricorn until Cancer, the sun&rsquo;s foot diminishes. From the middle sum</p>
<p>mer month they increase in degrees; likewise, from the middle winter month  they decrease in stages. If one sees a change in his shadow [at those times],  one will truly die in one month. If there is an increase of one&rsquo;s shadow when  it should diminish, and a diminishing when it should increase, then, calculating  from that time, one will truly die in one month. If there is too much increase  [of one&rsquo;s shadow] at the time of increase, one will be harmed by various ill</p>
<p>nesses. Likewise, if there is too much diminishment at the time of diminishing,  death will undoubtedly occur.</p>
<p>At the end of the middle summer and winter months, timely and untimely  death are accurately calculated from the first six days each of Cancer and Pisces.  The twenty-four-hour days of the middle and last summer months and the  extra days of the middle and last winter months may be either good or bad for  calculating death.</p>
<p>If someone feels a depression [in the flesh] somewhere between the inner most soles of the feet and the tip of the nose, then, truly, three days hence one  will die at once. At the time of defecating and urinating, if one is simultaneously</p>
<p>612 MICHAEL WALTER</p>
<p>seized by [a fit of] sneezing, then, from the moment of being seized, one will  age and die in one year. If one experiences a depression [in the flesh] at the  nape of the neck, after five days he will die. If one cannot see the tip of his  tongue, he will then die in three days.</p>
<p>If one feels that something is continuously stinging the tip of the nose, he  will die in four months. If one imagines a depression in the spot between his  eyebrows, death is truly imminent. Whenever there is pain simultaneously in  both nostrils, one will die one month hence. For this reason, merit should be  gathered [during that month], cheating death [that is, lengthening this period].</p>
<p>At night, while uniting the wind from both channels, if one sneezes during  and at the end of the session, one will die five months after equanimity of  meditation has been achieved.</p>
<p>If one feels pain at the same time in the joints of the little fingers and toes,  death will come in one month&rsquo;s time. If pain occurs at the same time all the  way from the heart to the throat, and if one is not grounded in Dharma practice,  death will occur in half a month. If pain occurs at the same time on three of  one&rsquo;s palms and soles, then, even if one is equal [in strength] to Indra, he will  die in three days.</p>
<p>Whoever cannot see his left eye in a mirror, and doesn&rsquo;t act to correct this  situation, he will truly die in seven days. When engaging in sex, if someone  doesn&rsquo;t hear a bell when it is rung, even though he is equal to Brahma, he will  die three months from that time.</p>
<p>On the first day of the waxing moon, if one&rsquo;s semen is black, he will die in  six months; if red, he will be struck with an illness. If pain occurs between the  tip of the nose and the space between the eyes, or at the top of the head, death  is imminent and cannot be averted.</p>
<p>If there is pain with fever, starting at the toes and going to the navel, one  will certainly die in six months. If there is pain from the toes to the heart,  throat, or even as far as the head, developing by degrees from half a month to  three month&rsquo;s time, one will be dead within one day.</p>
<p>If one&rsquo;s heart suddenly sinks in the body, death will occur after two weeks.  If the two veins on the sides of the neck are cut, death will also occur in two  weeks.</p>
<p>If a black spot suddenly appears in the middle of the tongue, then, gritting  one&rsquo;s teeth tightly, one will die in two days from that time.  If the veins behind, inside, and around the ears appear cut, if not on that  day, then in five days, one will die. If the red color of one&rsquo;s nails suddenly  disappears, and if one then doesn&rsquo;t practice mantra, and so on, he will die in  six months.</p>
<p>If one is meditating and making a threatening gesture, and is suddenly dis turbed by fear and anger, then, to the extent that he is not grounded in the  Dharma, he will die in one or two years.</p>
<p>Fluid dripping constantly from the eyes, causing one to be mistaken in what  one sees; not seeing one&rsquo;s shadow in water, or in a mirror; also, seeing rainbows</p>
<p>CHEATIN G DEAT H 613</p>
<p>at night or groups of stars in the daytime; seeing lightning in a clear sky in the  south, or the Milky Way in the daytime; likewise, seeing a star fall in the  daytime; and seeing geese, crows, and peacocks mixing together: after seeing  these, death will come in two months and two days.</p>
<p>Likewise, seeing a glow around one&rsquo;s head; a gandharva city [gandharvas are  spirits who dwell in the air and live on scents] at the top of a tree or at the  base of a mountain, or seeing pretas (ghosts) and pisacas (ghouls) or other  fearsome beings; shaking violently; falling down again and again; seeing gold  and silver coloring in vomit, feces, and urine - one who sees each of these  things will die within a month.</p>
<p>If semen, feces, and urine flow from the body at the same time, the per son who suffers that will die in one year; however, he can be healed by  medicines. Whoever has half his body hot while the other is cold, since  death will come after seven days, that person should begin thinking about  the world beyond.</p>
<p>That yogin who experiences himself as filled with the letter ha, and whose  breath has become like fire, will see the Lord of Death after ten days. If one  sees a black spot at the base of the ring finger, then, at the end of eighteen  days, he will truly die. If a three-colored chameleon climbs onto someone&rsquo;s  head and then runs away quickly, that person will truly die after five months.</p>
<p>If no sound comes from the yogin&rsquo;s body when he rubs it with his hands,  and all his limbs feel cold, he will die in ten days. If someone&rsquo;s calves and hands  suddenly twitch and move, and he lacks the thread of the twice-born [castes],  he will die after one or two years.</p>
<p>When someone fills his mouth each day with water warmed while the sun  is hot, and then blows out his breath, he will see various rainbows that persist  in stages in the midst of that breath. Such people, who are generally very long lived, will fail to see that they have only six months to live.</p>
<p>All these things are general knowledge; these particular points need to be  made:</p>
<p>One will die in six months from a change in one&rsquo;s basic nature. If one cannot  see the tip of his nose, he will die in five months. If one becomes deaf, one will  die after four months. If the senses become dispersed and one falls off his seat,  he will die in three months. If one sees light between his eyebrows, he will see  Yama [the Hindu and Buddhist god of death, who gathers the spirits of the  dead in his house] in two months. If one&rsquo;s testicles shrink, he will die after  one month. If the yogin doesn&rsquo;t see his reflection in another&rsquo;s eyes, he will die  in two weeks. If someone can&rsquo;t move his tongue, he will die after ten days. If  one turns away from food, he will meet Yama after five days. If one feels a  pulling at his sides, he will die after three days. If one&rsquo;s whole body becomes  stiff, that person will die in one day.</p>
<p>During the waxing or waning of the moon, if one&rsquo;s semen becomes black  and this isn&rsquo;t cured, he will die in six months. However, if someone completely  avoids doing things in the dark half of the month, and turns to doing things</p>
<p>614 MICHAEL WALTER</p>
<p>in the bright half, then, when the breath exits from the left nostril and enters  [the right nostril], he will be healed again.</p>
<p>Although one&rsquo;s body may be firm, if his shadow is crooked, he will die in  four months.</p>
<p>Those learned in such things have taught the following:</p>
<p>If one sees his shadow going in the southern direction, he will die, it is said.  In such ways, one sees the signs of his perishability. Although such signs  have been explained [by some] to be meaningless, misleading, perverse, and  so on, even if all dreams were untrue, such a criticism would not apply to this  path, which involves a mind strengthened in faith through practice of the  repetition of spells. The gods [that is, the personal deities of yogins] teach in  dreams, and yogins who see the truth in dreams will develop faith in them and  then will look for signs of death in them.</p>
<p>Whenever lac, kovidara (Bauhinia) or open karavira (Nerium indicum) flow ers appear at the end of a dream, that person will die in six months. When an  offering-lamp to whatever god, or [when] sand or a pile of ashes arises in a  dream, that person will also die in six months. If one heads off to the south,  riding a donkey [in a dream], and does not return, one again has six months  left [to live]. Whoever mounts a monkey and rides toward the south, if he  awakens while he is still there, he will die as above. If one dreams of climbing  up a long stick, the life-tree pole of a stupa, an anthill, or a heap of dust, he  will not live more than six months. Anyone bound [in a dream] by an angry,  black girl will die; she is called &ldquo;The Mark of Time&rdquo; and causes death after  seven days. The person who dreams of a woman wearing black clothing and  enjoying a black man, or who dreams of a garland of karavira, will go to the  place of Yama.</p>
<p>If one dreams of a darkness, a wide-open place, or, likewise, being thrown  into prison; or, if one dreams of falling from a tree, that person will reside with  the Lord of Death. During sleep, if one sees a great tree, grass, or fruitless trees  on his head and body, he will not live beyond six months.</p>
<p>A body rubbed with red aromatics, ornamented with a red rosary, or smeared  with sesame is to be much feared. Likewise, cutting off of hair, wearing red,  riding an ass, or a person heading quickly to the south - if someone sees such  [visions] as these in a dream, he will die in six months. Incense with a red  rosary, or red clothing - if these are [seen] in someone&rsquo;s dreams, he will die  in eight months.</p>
<p>The externals of death are beyond number. Since these have been made  known, a yogin should quickly strive to cheat death through spells, and so on,  when he experiences these signs.</p>
<p>PART TWO</p>
<p>Now will be discussed clearly the internal signs of death, which are understood  from the appearance of the vital wind. The mouth and the nose are the spheres  of action of the wind.</p>
<p>CHEATIN G DEAT H 615</p>
<p>To whatever extent one does not understand well and truly the internal  signs, to that same extent the reality of death will not be truly comprehended  in its external signs.</p>
<p>The certainty we can have about death is twofold: [Its time] having been  established with certainty, [the signs] can then be explained completely.  If a person, upon reflection, makes an accurate analysis of one twenty-four hour day in some appropriate way, then, calculating from that day, he will  know how much time will elapse until he will die. [This is because] the life force possessed by ordinary sentient beings wanders constantly and in all of  them [in the form of] the vital wind that is based for each of them in their  right and left nostrils. Those [paths] that we call &ldquo;sun&rdquo; and &ldquo;moon&rdquo; are that  wind, [which] circulates every ninety minutes. The wise yogin will analyze the  wind, since death, and so on, result from a deviation from this regularity.  When death is coming in six months, one should practice mindfulness of  the Dharma. When the order of the wind is disturbed in the last month, friends  and relatives will become troubled. In the last two weeks, because one&rsquo;s mind  has become deranged, the illness will appear to be intolerable. When the mo tion of the wind has been disturbed during the last one, three, four, five, or  six days, contention and quarreling will appear. When the natural state [of the  wind&rsquo;s movements] has been lost, and it moves along the three paths to try to  gain perception, there is no power to become healthy again, and one will die  after half a day has passed.</p>
<p>[Using the movement of the vital wind to calculate death:]</p>
<p>Calculating from the time of the sun&rsquo;s transiting in the first month of winter,  if the wind travels five days in the sun, one will die eighteen years after that  time. Calculating from the time of the sun&rsquo;s transiting in the middle fall month,  if the wind travels [in the sun&rsquo;s path] for a period of five days, one will die  after fifteen years. Carrying out the same calculation from the last month of  summer, one will die after twelve years; from the first summer month, one will  die after nine years. Calculating from the time of the transiting of the middle  spring month, if the wind travels [in the sun&rsquo;s path] for five days at that time,  one will die after six years; from the middle winter month, after three years.</p>
<p>Perceptions about the inner wind and all the paths of the sun should be  examined by learned ones for either timely or untimely death.  Whenever the wind, traveling [through] the body, suddenly enters another  path and so, at that time, quickly exhausts one&rsquo;s life-force, there will no doubt  be death at that time.</p>
<p>If the yogin perceives his wind to be in the sun [path, that is, the right  nostril], and it travels for half a solar day at the time that the sun is at its  maximum distance from the horizon, it should be understood that he will die  fourteen years after that time. If, for one solar day, a day and night, two twenty</p>
<p>four-hour days, or three, or four [days], the wind travels on the sun path, one  will die within twelve years. If it travels in such a way through five, ten, or</p>
<p>616 MICHAE L WALTE R</p>
<p>fifteen twenty-four-hour days, then, one will die in three, two, or one years,  respectively.</p>
<p>Likewise, if it travels there for twenty or twenty-five twenty-four-hour days,  then one will die in six or three months. If it travels there for twenty-six,  twenty-seven, twenty-eight, or twenty-nine such days, then one will die in two  months, one month, one-half month, or ten days. If it travels there for thirty,  thirty-one, or thirty-two such days, then one will die after three, or two, or one  day(s), respectively. When the wind travels the sun path for thirty-three days,  one will die that very day; even if one is Visnu, without a doubt.</p>
<p>This is the appearance of the signification of death.</p>
<p>Developments regarding the vital wind are to be known through the senses.  There are no indicators more important than the senses.</p>
<p>I have thus explained the inner signs of death, otherwise known as &ldquo;omens  of death.&rdquo; Having made those signs known to himself, the yogin should there fore strive to cheat death through meditative concentration, and so on, as  quickly as possible.</p>
<p>PART THREE</p>
<p>Having made known to the yogin the collection of omens of death relating to  both the outer and inner signs, I will now make known a condensed set of  indications for cheating death that relates to both sets of signs.</p>
<p>Because of the workings of body and speech, internal cheating is accom plished through the action of meditative concentration. External cheating  through wealth, spells, and medicines becomes internal as well through the  power of yoga.</p>
<p>Faith makes possible one&rsquo;s efforts to cheat the Lord of Death, so one should  make oneself firm in faith. Otherwise, even if a yogin tires himself from practice  through body and speech [that is, postures and chanting], no benefit will result.  Indeed, the faithless god Indra will not find any subtle Dharma with his hoards  of wealth for his bodily sufferings. Faith is the most subtle Dharma; it is the  release to Paradise [in the use of] ascetic practice, fire offerings, and wisdom.  Faith is the basis for success in all these methods. One may have wealth, life,  everything - such things mean nothing if one has no faith. Even though there  seems to be some small result due to one&rsquo;s wealth and so on, nothing will  ultimately be accomplished if one has no faith.</p>
<p>Acting to protect oneself from death by means of the Dharma [that is, by  studying the teachings of the Buddha] has been explained to be &ldquo;cheating  death.&rdquo; By delighting in irreligiosity and by being heedless, a person behaves  as if he would not remain in this life for even an instant. Even though one  were Brahma, when there is no Dharma practice there is no power to cheat the  Lord of Death. The Dharma of the Holy Ones is true; they delight in giving,  and in enduring ascetic practices. They have the highest love for all - what do  they need from the many other teachings? When one&rsquo;s heart drips with com-CHEATING DEATH 617</p>
<p>passion for sentients at all times (and because the Dharma is a liberating wis dom), what does one need from the many other teachings? Human life is  asserted in all religious and philosophical systems to be the most excellent of  the elements of existence; if one studies that constantly, he will gradually in crease his distance from the Lord of Death.</p>
<p>If one eschews nonvirtuous acts, takes the Three Vows for refuge [that is,  the vow to be a lay supporter of Buddhism, the vow of an ordained monk, and  the vow of a Tantric yogin], and keeps the temporary vows or the vows of a  layperson as his Buddhist practice, his distance from the Lord of Death will be  lengthened.</p>
<p>People are afraid of such things as being thrown into prison or struck [down]  by a great disease; if they are protected from such dangers, their lives are truly  lengthened, and the Lord of Death is cheated. In the devotion that the lowly  and the lordless have in accepting the wonderful moral teachings of the Bud</p>
<p>dha, they realize the goals of their desires, and their lifetimes truly increase.  By understanding one&rsquo;s father, mother, and elder guru, one has reverence for  the aged, and so on; when one bestows offerings and honor upon them, the  Lord of Death will not approach them. One should likewise revere one&rsquo;s per</p>
<p>sonal deity. The life [span] of the yogin is increased when, with equal devotion  in undertaking ascetic practices for that being, he constantly and faithfully pays  inward obeisance to it.</p>
<p>If one repairs cracked or broken stupas with bricks, and so on, a short life  will be lengthened, and this will create the same merit as that of giving alms  to a monk. Life is perpetually extended by creating temples, images, stupas,  and so on, by establishing pleasure groves, and by offerings, and so on, at the  eight great stupas. If one offers feasts, with supplies collected by supplication,  to the sangha, then, after seven days, one will acquire power over a long life  equal to that of Dharmaraja Asoka [a Buddhist &ldquo;King of Dharma&rdquo; who ruled  India in the third century B.C.E.].</p>
<p>When one creates stupas of sand, and casts tsha tshas in the same way, and  then pays homage to those stupas and tsha tshas, the length of one&rsquo;s life will  truly be extended.</p>
<p>In reading the Mahasamaya (the Sutra on the Teachings of the Great Bodhi sattva Vow) [and other sutras], if someone intones them with reverence, long  life will be achieved and the Lord of Death will be cheated. Likewise, if one  reads all of the Yoga Tantras, and so on, taught by the Buddha, or through the  rites taught in the five texts of protective spells known as the Pancaraksa, one  will come to cheat the Lord of Death. Likewise, by making circumambulations  of such a stupa as that which is constructed with a top-knot, or causing the  recitation of spells, one counters the efforts of the Lord of Death.</p>
<p>The wise ones who practice such methods cause death and the sun to dwell  far from them. Likewise, drawing mandalas and making fire offerings, mudras,  strewn offerings, and food offerings to yogins will also cheat the Lord of Death.  When one offers food, drink, and bedding, or even merely a robe, for the</p>
<p>618 MICHAE L WALTER</p>
<p>possession of the Arya Sanghas [the monks and nuns of the Buddhist com munity] of the four directions, one cheats the Lord of Death.  Undertaking such actions that should be done is the signifier of Dharma and  merit. Through merit, life is extended and, accordingly, the Lord of Death is  cheated. In the same way, even considering increasing the teaching of the  Dharma by a small amount has been taught by the learned to cheat the Lord  of Death.</p>
<p>Making efforts such as these at practicing the Dharma causes immediate  confidence in spells of accomplishment, medicines, and other matters that  completely clear away the Lord of Death. When one apprehends that the Lord  of Death [can be] kept away from our world by the power of spells of wealth,  medicines of accomplishment, and medical elixirs, one also realizes [the state  of being of a] Knowledge Holder.</p>
<p>If a yogin understands all the texts there are on testing jewels, then that  learned one will find himself in the possession of a jewel for realizing any wish,  and will even be fit to hold the Jewel of Life of Vajradhara, which is just the  same as the jewel for realizing all of one&rsquo;s wishes. Because these teachings can  bring one precious sapphires as well as other great jewels, there is no doubt  that all the Lords of Death will be repulsed. For these reasons, one should not  raise doubts about the power of such jewels; everyone wishes to have a jewel  with inconceivable powers.</p>
<p>If one makes offerings in a desolate place before a figure of one&rsquo;s personal  god on cotton cloth, and so on, then, by merely reciting the proper spells, the  cheating of death will come about.</p>
<p>[An example of this follows:]</p>
<p>If a yogin repeats this spell 100,000 times, with faith, to Lokesvara, for that  one to truly appear before him, [then] death will truly be cheated. First, say  vairocana; after that, say tare three times; then tuttare and ture two times each;  finishing with svaha - death will be deceived. As it is said in the Tarabhava</p>
<p>tantra [the &ldquo;Tantra on the Arising of Tara&rdquo;]: &ldquo;When one recites this spell  100,000 times before the eyes of Tara, with curds and honey placed before her,  and with a sprout of durva grass to the east and a fire offering showing its  flames to the north, then the yogin will truly cause death, which has sprung  from the totality of former actions, to be averted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would really do things just this way.</p>
<p>The spell that is the heart of the Arya Pratisara is the bestower of all magical  powers. One should recite the ten letters of this secret spell, called &ldquo;Victor over  Death,&rdquo; 100,000 times in the presence of Lokesvara. After that, offer 100,000  fire offerings with white flowers lifted up and cast into melted butter as a means  of pacification for bringing down Avalokitesvara. Following this, by the power  of this spell, the deceiving of the Lord of Death will truly occur: First, say om,  then am; after that, om and am again; then, om mrtyun ja ya (&ldquo;victory over  death&rdquo;), and after that, again, om - these are the ten syllables of that spell. This</p>
<p>CHEATING DEATH 61 9</p>
<p>was taught by the tathagatas [buddhas] for living a kalpa [the duration of a  universe] or longer.</p>
<p>Along with the rites explained by those who know, and other preparations  the yogin may wish to use, he should [also] combine medicines [derived from]  Sophora flavescens and urine for regions with great hunger. Sophora flavescens  should always be used either by itself or together with the three myrobalans.  After that, one&rsquo;s body will become firm and he will not see the gate of Yama.  Although there are other such medicines of realization, when one has true faith  in any of them, one&rsquo;s life is extended and one does not see death, because the  power that illness and old age hold over him has come to an end.</p>
<p>If one eats mercury with gold and silver in it, prepared according to the  correct ritual, it will possess the nature of a medical elixir, and will cheat death.  After a day, or about a month or so, when it has overcome the [mortal] con dition of the body, then, one will, by the rite of administering it as a medicine  through the nose, come to deceive death.</p>
<p>Some who have died in a number of ways can be seen to live again. One  example [of a method for achieving this] would be that of a man, or of a woman  having her menses: their blood and other bodily elements, which have become  mixed when they emerge in the course of their mutual exchange, are not con</p>
<p>nected strongly together. Extract two drops of such blood immediately upon  the death of someone. These two drops will be released via a small, hollow  cylinder smeared with butter, so as to be injected into the nostrils. When one  drop emerges from a nostril, it should be rolled into the other. This is done,  in turn, for each nostril. It has been seen that people become alive again in this  way, so this is a recommended procedure for stopping death in this life.</p>
<p>An indestructible [literally, vajra, &ldquo;diamond&rdquo;] body possesses a pleasing  form. When one attains through it a lifetime matching the years in kalpa, such  is truly a turning back of death.</p>
<p>Some urines protect the body when magically realized according to the rele vant teachings. They will cheat death immediately when drunk or rubbed on  [the body]. Someone who habituates himself to the constant practice of such  teachings, along with the correct use of butter and honey, will cause both  timely and untimely death to be averted.</p>
<p>It is not proper to cast doubt on the power of such medicines; their potency  appears, in a manner that is inconceivable, everywhere. There is a direct rela tionship between the reverence one shows these teachings in his external re ligious actions and the extent to which one can cheat the Lord of Death in this  life. There is a great degree of fear attached to death, which has great power;  accordingly, there are inner religious actions given here for that fear.</p>
<p>PART FOUR</p>
<p>Now, with regard to cheating death:</p>
<p>Death is explained to be truly cheated when some learned one possessing  inner greatness exerts himself. Such a person is fearless before a king, a thief,</p>
<p>620 MICHAE L WALTER</p>
<p>a great mara [there are four maras: these are beings who attempt to seduce  bodhisattvas and yogins into attachment to the world], a tiger, and so on. He  is a mountain, or something like that, free from human bustle, abiding by  himself, wherever it pleases him. Eating-moderately and speaking little, he finds  no pleasure in a strong desire for things. Much of the time, he remains in  meditation and sleeps little, exerting himself greatly in the repetition of spells.  The action of making offerings to a personal deity, and so on, of reading holy  texts, casting strewn offerings, and so on, are efforts he makes with a compas sionate mind for sentient beings of the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>He realizes what he wishes for through his merit; to accumulate merit, he  must avoid distractions. Because everything is realized through faith, he works  to increase his faith. Through diligence, what one begins is finished; therefore,  he makes diligence a preliminary practice. Because wished-for results can be  assured through meditation, he makes one-pointed effort in that [meditation].  By avoiding distractions, he develops his practice; thus, he diligently avoids  [distractions]. Since everything can be achieved by means of perfect knowl edge, he possesses all knowledge through his great faith and diligence. Because  he sees that suffering arises in the act of dying, he also sees that Dharma  originates from the act of living. Free of all doubt, he practices at all times the  cheating of death through veneration of Amrtakundalin.</p>
<p>[Now follows the invocation of Amrtakundalin, which opens thus:]</p>
<p>For that cheating, there are first 100,000 recitations of a spell that, performed  through meditation, is an enemy of obstacles. When it is properly recited, and  when one has made 10,000 fire offerings during this recitation, all obstacles  are repelled.</p>
<p>These spells remove all maras and obstacles; the yogin who wishes to practice  fearlessly in this way will meditate day and night while reciting them. Residing  in the abode of Ghanavyuha [a Buddhist paradise], he acts as a buddha again  and again through peaceful means. Atop a lotus-moon seat, in a squatting  posture and with a mudra that represents the highest thought of enlighten</p>
<p>ment, he emanates clusters of white light. While the yogin is meditating in this  way on White Vairocana [a buddha who, although a solar deity, originates  from the lunar center], it is not deserving that he should die and return to the  cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>Meditating on Aksobhya [a buddha associated with winter and the sun] and  the other tathagatas, with their colors and mudras, when the yogin bases him self in their divine pride, his body will truly become indestructible. When the  yogin then resides in the union of the sun and moon, there is white Abhaya  Lokesvara, peaceful like the moon and decked out with all possible ornaments,  and red-bodied Amitabha, holding all the marks of complete buddhahood, atop  [his] two lotus feet in a squatting posture. When this lord of yogins centers  his mind on ever more subtle forms of Lokesvara, the Lord of Death himself</p>
<p>CHEATIN G DEAT H 621</p>
<p>will die, and illnesses born for the skandhas [the aggregates from which we  construct our illusion of a self] will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Chant this spell of ten syllables with a mind unwearied by other practices:  Having established first Om, join tare to it immediately; then, tuttare ture; svaha  completes it. Brahma, Siva, Visnu, the Sun, the Moon, the rudras [a group of  spirits who represent storms and wind], dikpalas [the guardians of the direc</p>
<p>tions], and even Kamadeva [the god of sensual love] - will all conquer death  in this way, [even] as the Lord of Death himself had [done], without so much  as damaging the tips of one of their hairs. White hair, wrinkles, pernicious  conditions, illness, and poverty - all will disappear. The eight great fearful  things - such as fear of a lion, and so on - as well as entire aggregates of  miseries, will be destroyed. Food and drink, clothing, and so on, will be ob</p>
<p>tained without the effort of gathering them. Magical powers, such as the en chanted sword, eye medicine, quick-foot salve, the good vessel for all wishes,  and others; having a skillful mind; knowing how to speak in verse; immaculate,  unique insight; and other desired magical powers as well - all will arise from  this circle of magic syllables. This is taught in the Cakrasamvaratantra [a teach ing on Heruka, a form of the buddha Aksobhya]:</p>
<p>Meditate on the form of Heruka [a form of Aksobhya who frightens away  evil spirits and helps yogins]. Having accomplished this, when one has really  become him, meditate on the form of a skull, on a skeleton, or on the form of  an ascetic&rsquo;s staff. Since it is wrong to kill a yogin, death will not come to him.</p>
<p>All the parts of a yogin will be satiated by drops of ambrosia dripping, in  the form of the moon, at the top of the head, which then appear from all the  pores of his body.</p>
<p>Completely avoiding all distractions, the yogin should meditate in this man ner for six months; having thereby conquered all illnesses, he will conquer  death, even in the form of the Lord of Death.</p>
<p>Likewise, practicing mindfulness meditation on inhalation and exhalation  of the breath itself, the yogin should direct his efforts toward other divisions  of the respiratory process. Being certain about the increasing number of  breaths, the yogin will become ageless and deathless. The breath of sentient  beings travels [is breathed in and out] over 21,600 times in the course of a day  and night: the number of these breaths should be called aloud. Because the  syllable by which we bring the deity into our consciousness is the source of  ambrosia, that syllable is repeated each time the wind enters the yogin. And,  since ambrosia is the means by which we remain alive, when one is mindful  of these breathings [in and out], death will not find a hold in his body.</p>
<p>One should number the breaths that enter the body. According to one  method, [when one is] in one-pointed concentration one counts the breaths  that enter the body up to 100,000 or another [higher] number, in increments.  It is taught that this should be a silent recitation. When one finishes counting  [by] using such a method, he will theft certainly live another five years, even  if his life span has been diminished [for some special reason]. If one repeats</p>
<p>622 MICHAE L WALTER</p>
<p>that recitation 200,000 times, and so on, the extension of his liftime will then  be multiplied. Becoming learned in the means for doing this, the yogin should  strive in the recitation of his breaths. [By] enumerating the breaths constantly  and correctly 1,000 times in their inner, rising, one is freed from all illness and  will live as long as the sun and moon remain [in the sky].</p>
<p>Since the yogin enjoys nothing other than adhering to these teachings, he  will strive not to sleep for even a moment until he has conquered sleep; then,  he will do the same for food, drink, and so on. Because the yogin makes the  travels of the wind manifest in his body, the yogin who strives, in an appro</p>
<p>priate manner, to attend to its movements will truly conquer death. If he de parts from this but once, for some pleasure, because his mind has become  obscured, he will die because his means have become inappropriate. The  yogin&rsquo;s own body shall become an appropriate means; if the yogin turns away  from that means, his methods will not be appropriate [for realizing his goal].</p>
<p>One can obstruct the wind by binding it with the &ldquo;Gesture of the Lion&rsquo;s Play&rdquo;  [the gesture used by the Buddha to show the fearlessness his teachings instill].  In other words, by conquering death through blocking the wind, the yogin  creates &ldquo;the cheating of death by obstruction.&rdquo; The yogin should fill up his  body, in stages, with wind, all the way to the bottom of his feet, and then hold  it; this is called &ldquo;the pot&rdquo; (kumbhaka). When breath-holding is divided into  small and middling, and so on, it is to assert that there are three sorts of  stoppage of the upper wind. What is called &ldquo;stopping the upper wind&rdquo; is ex plained as follows to make its meaning clear: The small [breath-holding] is  thirty-six units in measure; the middling is two times that; the great, three  times. Through such holdings, the yogin becomes victorious over death. When  the yogin has filled himself with breath from this stoppage, he will then lightly  rest his hands on his kneecaps and snap his hand six times, and then begin  the practice again.</p>
<p>Further, if the yogin suspends his wind for a long period, and examines its  nature constantly during that time, he will render himself victorious over  death, mara, and other enemies. All evils being completely pacified, all virtues  will then spring up in their place. A yogin who is victorious by such methods  will realize his most fervently desired things.</p>
<p>When one does not meditate on meditation or the lack of meditation, sun yata is realized. The wise one, not meditating on existents, and not meditating  on the absence of existents, completely abandons both. Such meditation is free  of meditating. When a yogin meditates continually on &ldquo;the sunyata that com pletely avoids grasping,&rdquo; he becomes invisible to the Lord of Death. The dying  that comes from the merest discursive thought will also not see him; indeed,  the many maras and their retinues, and others, will not see him.</p>
<p>As it has been taught, &ldquo;This discursive perception known as &lsquo;dying,&rsquo; which  has no place in any existents, is overcome by the miraculously transformed  perception of ordinary beings [that is, through yogic practice]. All the suffer ings of discursive perception are explained as &rsquo;the mara of perception.&rsquo; Over-</p>
<p>CHEATIN G DEAT H 623</p>
<p>coming mistaken perception by that understanding, the yogin acts in a state  of nonperceptivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meditating constantly [on the yogin&rsquo;s personal deity], with special emphasis  on reverence based in faith, and so on, the yogin is comfortable in whatever  arises [in meditation] - that this and that are becoming clear, and that, for  example, desire and misery are manifestations of the mind. Treatises are hard  to find wherein these practices are easy to achieve; it is not hard to find these  practices, however, in the world of those who know them. Being skilled in such  practices, and truly established in [the perfections of] patience and heroism,  the yogin who knows how to strive in constructive meditation is a fit vessel  for cheating death.</p>
<p>Using butter, the heart of a person who has died in old age, and other items,  the yogin uses butter lamps and such for acts of destruction; again, by using  materials such as grain and butter offerings, he will abide [in his body] for the  duration of a kalpa. The same applies to dying from old age in this body: why  shouldn&rsquo;t one live to the end of this kalpa if he has procured these teachings  of realization? Old houses, for example, will stand a long time through main</p>
<p>tenance, so why shouldn&rsquo;t the bodies of the elderly also endure for a long time  through maintenance?</p>
<p>There is nothing difficult to achieve through effort; so, do not shirk in your  effort for something that is precious. In time, even slabs of stone are perforated  by the gentle, constant fall of water; fire comes from rubbing sticks together;  water rises out of the earth when it is ploughed. If someone takes pains, there  will certainly be realization. Realized through effort, and correctly, one will  have all results he strives for.</p>
<p>Human beings in the mouth of the Lord of Death are like boats in the mouth  of a sea monster; if their religious actions are not perfect, they will fall into the  waves of his realm. In a like way, any means of cheating death is taught to be  an enemy of the Lord of Death. A yogin should cultivate the work of meditation  that is realized on the basis of benefiting oneself and others. He should put his  effort into means that will free people from the fear of dying without being  loved. For this reason, there is nothing more pleasing than life.</p>
<p>When the yogin will have endeavored [to gain understanding] in the texts  on these teachings, and will have understood them, the complete deception  of the Lord of Death will have been explained, with loving care, for future  generations.</p>
