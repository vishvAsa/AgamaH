Lay communities of itinerant yogins and yoginis have been a vital dimension of  Tibetan Buddhist culture from at least the ninth century onward. These com munities were almost always irreducibly Tantric in character, in their ritual and  contemplative practices, their textual traditions, and the very structure of their  communal life. Although much of our information about early Tantric Buddhist  . communities in India and Tibet is fragmentary and heavily mythologized, detailed  biographical and historical narratives that emerged in in later centuries in Tibet  give a fuller portrayal of the nature of these communities, and afford us a glimpse  of actual male-female relationships. We have chosen to translate a depiction of  the fourteenth-century Tibetan saint Longchenpa's (Klong chen pa, 1308-1363)  ritual empowerment of a group of Tibetan yogins and yoginis into esoteric Tantric  practices. The action portrayed here occurred in the spring of 1339. The work is  signed by Longchenpa himself in the colophon and is specifically referred to as  his composition in his own catalogue to The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis,  which is the larger cycle of his texts in which it is found. It refers to him through 

out in the third person, however, usually calling him "the lama"; it is possible  that the text was actually recorded by a disciple on the basis of Longchenpa's oral  autobiographical account, or that Longchenpa actually wrote it in the third per son, a practice not unknown in this period of Tibetan autobiographical writing;  or, finally, that the text was recorded by a disciple some time after the events  reported in it. Whatever the case, it seems fair to conclude that the basic sequence  of events reported, at least in their bare outer appearance, in fact occurred, and  that the interpretations offered were current in the early community of Long chenpa's followers. This exceptional narrative offers much to ponder with regard  to the social dynamics of an esoteric Tantric community, to claims that were made  regarding the production of sacred Tantric scriptures, and to the transic practices  in which members of the community engaged, and which yielded extraordinary  performances that were then interpreted within the context of an elaborate system  of Tantric beliefs.

The broader Tibetan Tantric Buddhist movements within in which Longchenpa  and his disciples participated are at least three in number. One consists of what  was by then the standard set of Indian and Tibetan scriptures and practices sur rounding the Tantric practice of deity yoga: the procedures in which people vi sualized themselves as Tantric deity/buddrta figures and participated in what was  thought to be those figures' experience. Another is the Seminal Heart or Nyingthik  (snying thig) form of the Great Perfection (rdzogs-chen) movement, which is a  Tibetan syncretic Tantric tradition consisting of Chan-like practices of formless  meditation combined with exercises that cultivated spontaneous visions of bud dhas. The third salient tradition that informs the account translated below is called  Treasure (gter ma). A few comments concerning this uniquely Tibetan Tantric  tradition of scriptural revelation will aid in understanding the distinctive concep tions about personal identity, time, and sacred scripture that lie at the heart of  the activities in which Longchenpa engages in the narrative to follow.  

The Tibetan "Treasure discoverers" (gter ston) were part of a movement in Tibet  that had its origins in the tenth to eleventh century in Tibet, alongside other  movements centered on the figure of the lotsawa, or translator. The discoverers  were often exceptional yogins and teachers who revealed special texts and other  objects that, they maintained, had mainly been concealed in the eighth- and ninth 

century imperial period of Tibetan history for the express purpose of being re vealed at the "right time" in the future. Furthermore, a distinction was made  between "Earth Treasures" (sa gter) and "Mind Treasures" (dgongsgter), the former  being actual material manuscripts recovered from the earth and the latter being  visionary revelations with no physical substrate. Regardless of the modality, how ever, Treasures usually consist of collections of works, most of which contain  instructions for special forms of Tantric practice. As discussed below, Longch enpa, in addition to being a renowned academic scholar, was also intimately  involved in the revelation of Treasure. He inherited the two main streams of  Treasure scriptures of the Seminal Heart - among the most important products  of early Treasure revelations, which derived from the eighth-century Indic saints  Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava, respectively - and went on to produce new  revelations that extended both and integrated them into a single stream. In es sence, the events that Longchenpa describes here trace out the process of how he  first came into possession of new Padmasambhava revelations entitled The Seminal  Heart of the Dakinis, and then gradually came to reveal - in a very distinctive  manner - his own exegetical revelations, entitled The Seminal Quintessence of the  Dakinis. This process most notably involved a series of encounters with women  who were understood to be possessed by certain Indic and Tibetan deities and  humans, all of whom play critical roles in authorizing Longchenpa's involvement  with these past and future revelations of the dakinis.  

Treasure discoverers typically display doubts about whether they are the person  who has been prophesied to reveal the Treasures that they have found, and  Longchenpa is no exception. He repeatedly checks the identity of his spiritual  informants to determine if they are indeed the rightful "protectors" of the Trea-LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 241  

sure. Most centrally, he asks questions about his own identity and prophesied  destiny. One of the main reasons why Treasure revealers like Longchenpa talk  about their self-doubt is precisely to demonstrate their care and caution in as suming the exalted role of scripture revealer. Many sectors of Tibetan Tantric  society had grave concerns about the validity of the Treasure tradition as a whole,  to say nothing of the authenticity of any particular individual's claim to have  found such ancient materials. Even in Tibetan society, in which most persons  firmly believed in reincarnation, many were skeptical of the claim that someone  could recall a special teaching that they had been entrusted - by a master such  as Vimalamitra, or more often, the "Precious Guru" Padmasambhava (circa 800  C.E.) - to bring to light five hundred years hence, in a future lifetime. Padmasam 

bhava is the Indian Tantric master who introduced Tantric Buddhism to Tibet,  and who is the source credited with of most of the Treasure texts in Tibet. Critics  went so far as to doubt that figures such as Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra  would have ever designated and then concealed special materials for future rev 

elation in the first place. It is important to remember that such critics of the  Treasure tradition were in many ways acting to protect the claims to legitimacy  of their own Tantric corpora. The Treasures were probably often formulated pre cisely as an alternative to the more mainstream Tibetan Tantric materials that  were transmitted in the large monastic institutions of central Tibet. In many ways,  then, we can understand that the situation in Tibetan Tantric religion in which  Longchenpa was participating was a conflict between Tantric corpora - between  the mainstream canonical Tantric texts and their commentaries and ritual cycles  and those introduced through the more unconventional modes of the Treasure  tradition.  

The Visionary Autobiography  

It is because of the Treasures' controversial claims of origins that their discoverers  often wrote detailed accounts, like the one by Longchenpa translated here, of  their individual odysseys to revelation. Often written as glorified diaries with  precisely recorded dates, the detailed events reported in such autobiographical  works served to "engender confidence" in the authenticity of the revelatory pro 

cess, and to convince their readers that the protagonists were in fact not the  charlatans that everyone, even the Treasure proponents themselves, believed  many so-called Treasure discoverers to be. Among the principal events that such  autobiographical accounts report - and again, we see many examples in the pres 

ent account - are the visions of the original concealers of the Treasure, including  Padmasambhava, his Tibetan consort Yeshe Tsogyel (Ye shes mtsho rgyal), and  other masters. Many of Longchenpa's encounters with local deities such as Remati  and Vajra Turquoise Lamp (rDo rje g.yu sgron ma) also attest to the authenticity  of the discoverer and the Treasure he is purporting to introduce, for such deities  are said to have been appointed to protect the Treasure during the period of its 

242 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

interment, and to assist the appointed discoverer in locating it at the proper  moment. It is in this context that we are to understand the many passages in  which such deities speak directly to Longchenpa and give him information con cerning the history of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis as well as his own rela tionship to that history in the past, present, and future.  

Another type of experience that is typically reported in Treasure "autobiogra phies" such as this is the attainment of special Tantric meditative states. This  connected with one of the other principal Tantric founts of Longchenpa's expe rience, the Great Perfection tradition. States of Great Perfection insight might be  reported in any work of the "secret autobiography" genre; but the relevance of  these experiences to the Treasure narrative lies in the fact that Treasure discovery  is in fact closely related to those states themselves. Experiences akin to "the rain bow colored visions of radiant light" frequently referred to here are often singled  out as having been salient in that past moment in which the discoverer-to-be  originally had the Treasure implanted in this deep level of consciousness. That  initial concealment was made in a highly encoded form, which would have been  both covert and durable enough to remain in deep memory over many lifetimes  until the time for revelation was at hand. In order, then, to bring out the Treasure  in its fully unfolded form in that future moment, the discoverer needs to gain  access to that deep state of consciousness again; hence, his ability to realize such  states of consciousness serves to demonstrate that he is a person capable of re vealing a Treasure.  

The reader should also bear in mind the extent to which the Treasure tradition  is dependent upon the more general Tibetan belief that humans can be emana tions, or even reincarnations (tulkus; sprul sku), of past Buddhist masters. In  general, the buddhas' and bodhisattvas' mastery of the Buddhist principle of emp tiness is thought to allow them self-consciously to manifest "emanations" (sprul  pa) to different parts of the cosmos, in the service of the Buddha's teachings. In  the Tibetan Buddhist world, there is a more specialized belief that historical figures  who were religious masters could also reincarnate deliberately in the right place  and time to accomplish particular compassionate goals. These ideas underlie the  Tibetan institution of the tulkus, a word that literally means "the emanated body  of a buddha," but which in practice refers to the person who is discovered through  the distinctive practice of seeking out the young reincarnation of a recently de ceased saint, in order that that child be "reinstalled" in the religious community  that the old master had left behind. Alternately - and this is the case in the  selection translated here - adults can claim such a mantle for themselves later in  life. Thus we witness Longchenpa reincarnationally recreate himself before our  eyes, or at least before the eyes of the dakini.  

It is usually said that other "secondary conditions," beyond the discoverer's  mastery of the succession of his or her lives and memory of the one in which the  Treasure was first received, also contribute to the discovery of Treasure scriptures.  The discoverer will often be granted certain props, such as a fragment of a text  buried in the ground, or even a fascicle of writing handed to him in a dream. 

LONGCHENPA AND THE pAKINIS 243  

Once such materials are in hand, the discoverer is often unable to understand  them or decode them from their encrypted form. Advanced Tantric teachings and  practice are said to be necessary for one to be fully qualified to codify the main  Treasure scriptures, compose the necessary commentary texts, transmit the cod 

ified scriptures in a ritual Tantric empowerment, and finally teach their content  in detail. At an even more esoteric level, discoverers are often said to engage in a  form of sexual consort yoga as a means of accessing the necessary states of mind  for Treasure revelation and decoding. Although such practices are not referred to  explicitly in this text, it is quite possible that Longchenpa engaged in them during  the period he is reporting. In this context we should also understand the active  role of yoginis, who are possessed by female deities. These members of the larger  Tantric retreat community in which Longchenpa wrote and taught during the  years reported here seemed especially gifted for channeling the spirits of the  Treasure protectors and communicating their intimate messages, in esoteric form,  to the discoverer. In the account we read here, Longchenpa shows a certain dis dain for the revelation of Treasures out of the ground, and instead eventually  identifies his own authorial voice with the voice of his dakinl-mediated Treasure  inspiration. In other words, his extension of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis,  rather than being a revelatory core of other-voiced texts fleshed out by his own  compositions, reflects an inseparable unity of personal intention and transcendent  inspiration, a subject to which we shall return.  

The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis  

Beyond the general role of the feminine in Treasure revelation, The Seminal Heart  of the Dakinis, the tradition that Longhcenpa is engaged with here, has much to  do with the particular feminine roles. This is patent in the work's title: dakini is  an Indic term, translated by the Tibetan term Kandroma (mkha' 'gro ma), which  means "one who goes in space." It signifies a female spirit who can either be a  transcendent buddha or a vengeful demoness; in addition, the word can also  signify an historical female saint in Tibet. Seminal Heart is the name for a syncretic  Tantric tradition that came to be the most normative variant of the Great Perfec tion. What The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis Treasure did, in fact, was to bring a  greater focus, in its meditative practices, on the distinctively Tantric practice of  sexual yoga as integrated with the Seminal Heart. The latter include the belief in  dynamically active buddhas within the ordinary body which, when cultivated,  flow spontaneously out through the eyes and into the surrounding visual field.  As the rainbow-colored light gradually shapes itself of its own accord into man dates, the practice culminates in visions of pure lands.  

The Seminal Heart literature prior to Longchenpa consisted of three major  collections, all of which emerged, between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries  and through the revelatory processes of the Treasure movement, as Tibetan-lan guage literature. They are The Seventeen Tantras, The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra, 

244 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

and the very The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis that is of principal concern in the  material translated below. The Seventeen Tantras are largely Tibetan syntheses, and  function as the primary texts upon which the other two collections are based. The  Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra is a three-volume collection that also contains a few  Tantras, but consists mostly of ritual, contemplative, and philosophical texts at 

tributed to Vimalamitra and other Indian teachers. Vimalamitra and his disciples  are said to have buried both The Seventeen Tantras and The Seminal Heart of  Vimalamitra as Treasure, where they remained until the late tenth or early eleventh  century, at which time their excavation began, a process that culminated in the  mid-twelfth century. It appears, however, that these texts were in fact largely  composed by their Tibetan discoverers themselves.  

In any event, the Seminal Heart tradition had little to do with Padmasambhava  until the early fourteenth century, when against the backdrop of the increasing  predominance of a larger revelatory cult organized around Padmasambhava, an  obscure Tibetan by the name of Tsultrim Dorje (Tshul khrims rdo rje, 1291- 

1315/1317) produced a two-volume collection known as The Seminal Heart of the  Dakinis. Although clearly indebted to its predecessors, its narrative frames claimed  that the collection had been authored by Padmasambhava in eighth-century Tibet  and concealed as Treasure by Padmasambhava's Tibetan consort Yeshe Tsogyel.  The important role of the Tibetan queen Yeshe Tsogyel in the burial of Treasure  is one of the reasons for which female consorts, not to mention female epiphanies,  play such an important role in the revelatory processes of the Treasure discoverers.  In particular, emanations of this supreme Tantric female consort are believed to  be essential in helping the discoverer decode the Treasure, since it was Yeshe  Tsogyel herself who encoded the Treasure in special "dakini sign-language" at the  moment of the Treasure's burial. Yeshe Tsogyel receives special attention in The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis Treasure, inasmuch as it is she who originally re quested Padmasambhava to grant the many texts and teachings contained in this  Treasure.  

Another female figure in The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis is of paramount sig nificance for Longchenpa. This is the eighth-century Tibetan princess Lhacam  Pemasel (Lha lcam pad ma gsal) who, according to the story, died suddenly at  the tender age of eight in Samye Chimphu (bSam yas mchims phu), in the pres ence of both her father, the Tibetan Emperor Trisong Detsen (Khri srong lde'u  btsan, 742-c. 798) and Padmasamabhava. Padmasambhava explains to the griev ing emperor the karmic reasons for this sudden death - namely, her transgres sions of past lives - but then discloses that he has decided that the princess will  reveal his own Seminal Heart teachings in a future life. He proceeds to bring her  back to life in order to give her an initial transmission of those teachings: this is  The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis. Padmasambhava annoints her as Pema Ledreltsel  (Pad ma las 'brel rtsal), "The one with the Dynamism of a Karmic Connection to  Padma," That is, Padmasambhava.  

These events are central to the the fourteenth-century narratives of Tsultrim  Dorje, who claimed to be the prophesied reincarnation of the princess and thereby 

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKlNIS 245  

the inheritor of the mantle of Pema Ledreltsel. However, following his stunning  revelations of 1313, when he was in his early twenties, Tshultrim Dorje himself  abruptly died under mysterious circumstances, in which an ill-fated sexual liason  with a woman and an inability to keep his Treasure revelations secret while he  mastered his own contemplative practice of their teachings were rumored to have  played a part. He left behind no institutional basis for the perpetuation of his  revelations, the first new Seminal Heart cycle in over a century. However, Long 

chenpa, following his reception of the older traditions of The Seminal Heart of  Vimalamitra in his early thirties, came into possession of this major Seminal Heart  work. How he came into possession of this cycle, the concomitant possession of  his female disciples by the dakinis who redacted, concealed, and guarded the  cycle, and Longchenpa's own eventual visionary extension of the tradition lie at  the heart of our story.  

Overview of the Translation  

The passages excerpted here mark Longchenpa's emergence as a teacher, trans mitter, and revealer of the Seminal Heart. When Longchenpa was in his late  twenties, Kumaraja, his principal lama, gave him an array of teachings that high lighted The Seventeen Tantras and The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra. Longchenpa  followed these transmissions with a three-year period of retreat. At the opening  of our translated passage we find him emerging as a teacher of the Seminal Heart  in his own right, as he takes on a circle of disciples of his own. Not surprisingly,  he chooses the famous Chimphu Valley to inaugurate this new identity. Chimphu  is a retreat center in the mountains above Samye, the first Buddhist monastery in  Tibet, which also bears strong associations with Padmasambhava, who is believed  to have been instrumental in its construction. Samye was also the site of important  events relating to The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, including the death and res surection of Princess Pemasel. Here Longchenpa began ritually to initiate a non monastic group of eight yogins and yoginis into the tradition of The Seminal Heart  of the Dakinis, after which he gave them detailed contemplative instructions on  the tradition's esoteric meditative system.  

Against the backdrop of these rituals, transmissions, and celebrations, Longch enpa and his disciples enter a spiritually excited state, which gives rise to a stream  of visions and states of possession in the group. The visions are often seen by  everyone present, but the possessions are performed exclusively by the women.  We can also note that the overwhelming majority of the visionary apparitions and  possessing spirits that enter into this exceptional milieu are female, whether they  be Buddhist goddesses, Dharma protectresses, or historical Tibetan women. The  possessions are characterized as the "descent" (babs) of the spirit into the yogini,  after which the latter begins to "perform" ('khrab) in the identity and voice of the  former.  

The first such spirit appears abruptly during an empowerment ritual. She iden-

246 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

tifi.es herself as the Dharma protectress Ekajati, a famous wrathful female figure  particularly associated with the Seminal Heart tradition. Dharma protectresses are  generally depicted as indigenous spirits wrathfully subjugated by Padmasambhava  or other masters, both to prevent them from hindering Buddhist activities and to  bind them into the ongoing service and defense of Buddhism. They therefore have  a hybrid nature that retains traces of their origins in the violent and unpredictable  nature of certain older, non-Buddhist spirits, now reinterpreted in Buddhist eth ical terms. Indeed, such protectresses are often viewed as emanations of buddhas  or bodhisattvas, with their ferocity subliminated into a kind of playful creativity,  as we see here repeatedly. Ekajati chides Longchenpa on the quality of his per 

formance of the ritual, imparting nuanced revisions of the master's teachings and  actions. The other disciples present are skeptical and taken aback by the yogini's  daring actions before their respected guru, but he reassures them that she is  indeed possessed by an authentic and enlightened spirit, and also that he himself  has the knowledge and charisma to keep the performance under control. The  episode marks an important breakthrough for the small community, as its mem 

bers begin to recognize the special insights and information that these possessed  women are able to offer their teacher. These positive results reinforce the value  of what might otherwise have been viewed as dangerous - or inauthentic - trance  states.  

The next possession episode provides even more crucial information. A yoginl  is taken over by Vajra Sow (rDo rje phag mo, in Tibetan, Vajravarahl in Sanskrit),  one of the most famous Buddhist Tantric buddhas and Longchenpa's own per sonal deity. Vajra Sow tells him about the other Tibetan spirits bound into the  service of Longchenpa's teachings who have come to visit him as well, and also  reassures him about the current state of health of his teacher Kumaraja. She then  settles into an extended dialogue with him concerning his true identity. She begins  by revealing that Longchenpa's teacher, Kumaraja, is one of the prophesied cen tennial emanations of Vimalamitra in Tibet, which implies that Longchenpa had  received The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra from Vimalamitra himself, in reincar nate form, just a few years earlier. Still more dramatically, she goes on to disclose  that Longchenpa is none other than the contemporary reincarnation of Tsultrim  Dorje, who was in turn the reincarnation of Princess Lhacam Pemasel, who had  originally received, from Padmasambhava, the very Seminal Heart teachings  Longchenpa now is transmitting. She thus identifies him as the principal heir and,  in fact, the original revealer of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, the second great  stream of the Seminal Heart. As a consequence, she gives him the prophesied  names Drime Ozer (Dri med 'od zer) and, by extension, Pema Ledreltsel (Pad ma  las 'brel rtsal). The former, literally "Stainless Light Rays," comes to be one of  Lonchenpa's most important authorial names invoked in colophons, while the  latter, literally "The One with the Dynamism of a Karmic Connection to  Padma(sambhava)," is employed throughout Longchenpa's own subsequent com mentary, entitled The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis.  

Vajra Sow then discusses his present lifespan and his future lifetimes and Trea-

LONGCHENP A AND TH E DAKINI S 247  

sure revelations, and gives critical instructions on when, where, and by what  means the revelations would transpire. This passage thus works to accomplish a  momentous feat, namely, the recreation of Longchenpa into a authorized revealer  and teacher of the esoteric Seminal Heart of the Dakini, who in a future life would  attain buddhahood in the sacred land of Oddiyana to the west of Tibet. It should  be recalled that all of this self-transformation takes place in the very valley where,  in a distant past life, the subject in question had already been resurrected and  blessed as a dakini him/herself by Padmasabmhava.  

These grand claims, however, are undermined by two seeming contradictions,  which actually are noted by Longchenpa himself: Tshultrim Dorje's death date  (1315/1317) seems to have come after Longchenpa's birth date (1308), and the  prophecies in the Treasure cycle itself indicate that Tsultrim Dorje's next rebirth  will be in Bhutan, whereas Longchenpa was born in southern Tibet. As the passage  proceeds, we see the dakini ingeniously solving these problems. Her strategy turns  on a skillful interpretation of a seemingly irrelevant detail in the prophecy,  namely, that Tsultrim Dorje would, prior to rebirth, spend a "brief sojourn in a  pure land." This would seem to indicate that the few years' gap separating the  saint's death and rebirth would have been passed in a buddha's pure land outside  of the ordinary world system. The dakini, however, interprets the statement as  referring to Longchenpa's own life, in which he is immersed in visions of Buddhist  pure lands through his contemplative practice of the Seminal Heart. This renders  the prophesied Bhutanese rebirth as one yet to come. As for the incongruous  death date of Tsultrim Dorje, she exploits the obscurity of his life to push his  death date back by eight or ten years to 1307, just in time to coincide with the  conception of Longchenpa. This passage ends with Longchenpa in a state of in spiration, singing a Tantric song about the interior reality of the five Tantric  buddhas.  

The next major episode of possession involves a distinctively Tibetan Dharma  Protectress by the name of Vajra Turquoise Lamp (rDo rje g.yu sgron) who, again,  descends into a female disciple of Longchenpa. She first invites him to her domain,  which refers to the retreat place of White Skull Snow Mountain (Gangs ri thod  dkar) to which he would eventually repair and compose most of his major works.  The two then discuss various doctrinal and meditational points, reiterating the  nonconceptual, immediate, and even "nonmeditational" nature of the kind of  enlightened realization most valued in the Seminal Heart tradition. They also  review a range of pedagogical problems that relate to the transmission of certain  esoteric Tantric empowerments. She further reminds Longchenpa of a former  vision he had had of her, revealing that in reality she is Vajra Sow who has only  temporarily taken the form of Vajra Turquoise Lamp; in this way, this local Ti betan deity becomes identified with the famed Indic Buddhist goddess.  

In the course of their conversation, Longchenpa critically displays anxieties  about his own qualifications and about the necessity of teaching the Seminal Heart  at all: the teaching had already bean transmitted by one of the most famous  tulkus of the time, the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (Rang byung rdo rje, 1284-

248 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

1339), as well as by a well-known Treasure finder Rinchen Lingpa (Rin chen gling  pa, 1295-1373). The deity again bolsters Longchenpa's sense of confidence. She  immediately dismisses his doubts, making a clever pun based on the dual sense  of lung as both "handle" of a vessel and "verbal transmission" in which a teaching  is ritually read out loud to disciples prior to its study. She thus implies that  Longchenpa's two perceived rivals are simply mouthing the words of the texts  without real comprehension - they are mere "handles" of a reality that only  Longchenpa fully "owns." Thus does the yogini, speaking in the voice of the  dakini, play a crucial role in reinforcing Longchenpa's sense of legitimacy and  self-worth for the throne of Seminal Heart transmission.  

Soon after this self-empowering exchange, Longchenpa commissions his most  trusted disciple, Ozer Gocha ('Od zer go cha), to retrieve the actual manuscript  of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis Treasure. Upon his return with the text, we  have another extensive possession episode that endures for several days, this time  by none other than Yeshe Tsogyel, the queen of Treasure concealment and the  principal dakini of the Treasure tradition. As on the previous possession, the  yogini-as-dakim intervenes in some of the ritual proceedings, at one point even  granting teachings and empowerments to the teacher, and engages in mysterious  symbolic actions and performances that are meant to impart an esoteric message  to her audience. She also reiterates the essential importance of nonattachment  and openness, pronouncing phat, a mantric utterance designed to cut off obsessive  thinking whenever such small-mindedness occurs. Again, the more cautious dis ciples are not sure how to take these strange and supremely self-confident female  performances, but the lama Longchenpa assures the doubting disciples of the  performances' worth.  

The inspired yogini proves her prescient powers in the next episode when she  is able to give a nuanced assessment of a deep meditative experience that Long chenpa has just had. She approves heartily of his perception - classic for this  school of Tantra - that beholds the apparitions of samsara and the visions of  nirvana simultaneously. Nonetheless, she is critical of a previous moment in his  experience when he had momentarily swooned. With its insistence on the ne cessity of engaging with all appearance, the Great Perfection tradition repeatedly  resists the temptation to retreat into a near-unconscious cocoon of formless medi tation. Rather, the meditator is advised to perfect the skill of "emanation" in order  to work most effectively in samsara and aid sentient beings.  

This esoteric guidance is followed by further ritual interventions and attempts  to bolster Longchenpa's self-confidence. There are a number of explicit references  to the dakini authorizing and announcing his enthronement or investiture as the  regal inheritor of Padmasambhava's legacy. She offers him the texts of The Seminal  Heart of the Ddkinis (evidently the copy that Ozer Gocha has just procured), along  with its transmission, though presumably in a somewhat condensed manner. In  addition, she is portrayed as guiding his hand, with help of Vajra Turquoise Lamp,  as he composes some explanatory notes associated with the Treasure, which  would appear to be an allusion to the seminal inspiration which at the end of the 

LONGCHENP A AND TH E DAKINI S 249  

text yields his own masterly extension of the Treasure entitled The Seminal Quin tessence of the Dakinis.  

In the next episode of possession, we witness the kind of repartee that often  ensues between the sometimes unruly protector deities and the Tantric lama.  Remati is another female guardian deity who descends, yet again, into an unspe cified yogini disciple, this time with a retinue of other female deities. She begins  by rebuking Longchenpa for his supposed lapses in devotion to her. However,  he eventually responds with a defiant dismissal of any need to be fully dependent  upon her. It appears that he is beginning to assimilate the messages of encour agement he has been receiving, and is no longer willing to value every channeled  message sent to him, especially those sent by less than fully trustworthy local  protector deities. Particularly interesting in this light is his explicit criticism of the  unqualified valorization of Treasures - particularly the material Treasures pulled  out "of the cracks of rock mountains" - and his claim to transcend any concern  for their revelation by himself, since he has "revealed the gateway to the Treasure  of radiant light within myself." This is a critical moment in which we witness not  only his own growing self-confidence in the face of these imposing dakinis who  descend suddenly into his world (and depart just as abruptly) but also his asser 

tion of his own authorial voice and its intrinsic value amidst the dramatic land scape of Treasure revelation and the channeling of sacred voices of the past.  

The final episode translated here shows the Tantric community engaged in the  celebratory rituals that are appropriate to the conclusion of a profoundly mean ingful retreat period. With the playfully magical assistance of Longchenpa, they  produce the customary pints of beer out of their meager resources and proceed  to become inebriated. In the midst of the festivities, Turqoise Lamp returns to  invite Longchenpa to her residence on White Skull Snow Mountain, and he has  to hold off the jealous intervention of Remati, who also reappears to take issue  with his impending move to that mountain retreat. Her dangerous nature is re vealed when she admits to taking a toll on the livestock of the northern Tibetan  pasturelands as her deserved tithe, but this unpredictable spirit nonetheless re mains part of the protective organization of Longchenpa's Treasure pantheon.  

The community begins to part company, many fulfilling Longchenpa's wishes  by promising to go into meditative retreat. The narrative also refers to certain  violations and disturbances caused by at least one member of the lama's circle  from eastern Tibet, but provides no detail on their nature. Longchenpa proceeds  to White Skull Snow Mountain located in the headlands of Shukseb, on the col  of which he builds his small hermitage, named Oddiyana Fortress (U rgyan  rdzong). This is to become his most favored hermitage, and he retreats there  continually over the final two and half decades of his life to write many of his  greatest masterpieces. Shortly after establishing the hermitage, at the urging of  the devoted Ozer Gocha, Longchenpa composes his own textual extension of The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, which brings to fruition the fragmentary inspirations  and multiple allusions to his own impending Treasure revelation that one finds  woven through his dialogues with dakinis at Chimphu. The seminal insights of 

250 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

Chimphu thus become the three volumes of The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis  at White Skull Snow Mountain.  

Although the text's composition takes place amid a continuing flow of visions  and omens stemming from the dakinis, and represents the culmination of the  dakinis' and Padmasambhava's inspirations conveyed in the numinous headlands  of Chimphu, Longchenpa's account leaves no doubt that it is his own composi 

tion. Indeed, colophon after colophon of The Seminal Quintessence of the Dakinis  uses the language of Treasure revelation, but ultimately clearly ascribe its com position to Longchenpa himself, albeit in his reincarnational identity as Pema  Ledreltsel, "the one with the dynamic karmic connection to Padmasamabhava."  Unlike his previous life's revelations, which involved earth Treasures attributed  repeatedly in framing narrative and colophon to the literal authorial agency of  Padmasmabhava and Yeshe Tsogyel, Longchenpa in his present life discloses the  same bravado and self-assertion he had increasingly exhibited in the headlands  of Chimphu, in a literary form. He is the Treasure revealer and the author, thereby  incarnating a moment in which revelation and inspiration, reincarnation and in carnation, Treasures and compositions coincide on shifting registers. Never be fore, and perhaps never again, was the Tibetan Treasure tradition of channeled  authorial voices so exquisitely invoked and deconstructed, simultaneously, in the  same voice and the same texts. This multivalent identity, on authorial grounds,  of the possessed and the possessor constitutes the textual landscape on which  Longchenpa perhaps most adequately responds to the enigmatic possessions of  the dakinis, the result being a text of intertwined voices, human and dakini, past  and present, Tibetan and Indian, which mirrors the intertwining of dakini and  yogini at Chimphu.

The Luminous Web of Precious Visions  

At the age of twenty-seven, [Longchenpa] encountered the glorious lord of  religion Kumaraja, from whom he obtained the empowerments, guidances, and  instructions for the esoteric Seminal Heart of the Great Perfection. The next  year [Kumaraja] gave him the seal of entrustment for the higher empower 

ments, along with their Tantras, scriptures, and esoteric precepts. [Long chenpa] then practiced contemplation for three years. At the age of thirty-one  he decided to leave at the conclusion [of the retreat]. At that time a traveler to  Nyiphu Shukseb (sNyi phu shug gseb) came to see him, and he was supplicated  by many disciples with the right fortune. Hence he gave them guidance on the  Seminal Heart of the Great Perfection. At that time the yogin Ozer Gocha  offered the lama a totally intact manuscript of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis,  which he had obtained after great hardships from Loro (Lo ro). [Longchenpa]  dreamt at the same time that the goddess Vitality Accomplishing Mistress (Srog  sgrub ma) hand-delivered the manuscript [to him].  

Then at the age of thirty-two in the following year, in the middle spring  month of the year of the earth female hare [ 1339], [Longchenpa] began giving  instruction in the esoteric Seminal Heart of the Great Perfection to eight male  yogins and female yoginis with the right fortune in the forest of Rimocen (Ri  mo can) at Chimphu valley. Upon the descent of blessings during his perfor 

mance of the nonelaborate empowerment, the glorious and great Mantra Pro tectress [Ekajatl] descended into on&of the yoginis, and she began to perform.  When everyone else became full of doubt, the lama said, "Because a dakini has 

252 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

actually descended here [in her], get over your worries! I am a yogin who has  realized the single flavor of appearances and mind, and thus no obstacles will  ensue!"  

The yogini prostrated to the lama, and having gazed at the offering cakes,  she inquired, "Why haven't you included'the peacock [feather?]" He replied,  "I have conjured it mentally!" She in turn said, "What use is doing it mentally  in the symbolic doctrine? [that is, one needs the actual object to function as a  symbol in these teachings]. [Also] this [basin] isn't necessary." She then put  aside the basin from the platform atop the vases, and placed there three vases  linked together. Then when the lama performed the ritual in full detail, she  joined her palms together, said "excellent!" and kept nodding her head [in  approval]. But when [Longchenpa] left off the final letters in pronouncing the  word rigs, she said, "No, no! You should say rigs!" When he was reciting the  [mantra] letters - Om and so forth - she said, "Imitate me!" and proceeded to  sing the mantras in a sweet melody in Dakini language, connecting them with out mixing them up.  

During the eight words in the context of the main phase [of the ritual], she  made restitution for the omission of no-meditation, singing it as a song: "When  the intellect is free from meditation, joy! When meditation is free from the  intellect, how happy!" Saying that the offerings were of poor quality, and more 

over that nothing would ensue by means of them, she again sang a sweet  melody as an offering. When a large bowlful of ambrosia was presented to the  lama at the time of the ritual communion (ganacakra), she said, "This is the  sacrament of the dakinis, and thus must be relied upon no matter what!" She  thus invited him to consume all of it without remainder.  

At this time the yogin Rinchen Otro (Rin chen 'od 'phro) also saw the blue black Glorious Savior (dPal mgon po) with his complete set of ornaments.  Then special blessings of the dakinis occured right up until daybreak. There upon, until [Longchenpa began] the guidance [in the morning], the yogins  and yoginis sang and danced in a state of intense exhilaration. Their experi ences blazed with cognitive experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality,  all day and night. They entered a special visionary state that was neither asleep  nor awake.  

[The intervening passages describe further visions of various dakinis and other figures  who appear on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of the lunar month.]  

After a while [still on the twenty-fifth], one yogini also saw gathering cloud  banks of dakinis showering all over the land and space. Therefore [we] dedi cated the cakes of the feast offering to them. Then after a while, that yogini  was shaking her long tresses and had the experience of Vajra Sow with a dark  blue-colored body filling up the sky and then dissolving into [her]. Then she  began to perform [as the goddess].  

She said: "Its coming, its coming." [We] asked: "What is coming?" She re-

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 253  

plied "Tomorrow morning obstacles are coming; if not then there will be many  high guests." [We] asked, "Who has come?" She replied: "The seven medicinal  goddess (sman mo) sisters have come. They are white, youthful in complexion,  wearing multicolored silk garments adorned with various gold, turquoise, and  jeweled ornaments, and are surrounded by immeasurable medical goddesses  as retinue. There are still more to come. Ode Gungyel ('0 de gung rgyal) has  come surrounded by many retainers similar in appearance - a black man with  a black horse, black cloak, black spear, and with his long hair forming a turban  wrapped around his head. There are still more to come. Nyenchen Thanglha  (gNyan chen thang lha) - a white man with white horse, and surrounded by  many similar retainers is here. Offer them torma!" [We] offered them torma.  

Then the yogini said, "I have come here newly - why don't you offer me a  torma?" [The lama] asked, "Who are you?" She replied, "I am the lama's per sonal deity, Vajra Sow." At that time [the lama] asked everyone, "What do you  see her as?" The yogin Ozer Thaye explained that he saw a dark blue woman  larger than the others, adorned with bone, and adorned by nets of jewels and  bones.  

Then the lama asked her, "Why have you come here? Is [my] holy lama  [Kumaraja] healthy?" The yogini replied, "Since tonight is a wild night, I have  come to spy on these karmically worthy disciples. Your lama is in excellent  health." [Longchenpa] then asked, "Well, if that's the case, since this year is a  dangerous point in his life, should we be worried?" She responded, "What  obstacles could there be to an emanation of the Buddha? It merely depends on  his perception of the needs of disciples. Don't you understand that [in him]  Vimalamitra has come to Tibet?" He then asked, "Then how long will he live?"  She replied, "He will live until the next year of the sheep. After that it is un certain, since [his life span ] depends upon his disciples."  

[Longchenpa] then asked, "Well, if that's the case, are you now urging me  [to act] for the welfare of others as the lama himself urged me to do [previ ously]?" She replied, "Yes, precisely!" He then inquired, "Should I stay in sol itude to accomplish the body of light, or bring benefit to sentient beings  through acting for the welfare of others? How much longer have I to live?" She  replied, "Though you could accomplish the body of light, you must benefit  sentient beings - much welfare to others will ensue. You will be able to live  for thirty more years beyond the present." At that point, the yogin Ozer Gocha  said, "Please stay for a long life!" The lama responded, "This dakini has no  obessive fixations - it may be that [my life span] can be calculated in terms of  days, months, and years, but I have no idea what that would be."  

Again, the lama questioned her, "How many Word Protectors (bka' srung)  do I have?" She replied, "Many! You have all of those of your lama, and in  particular Goddess Vajra Turquoise Lamp." He then inquired, "Where will I  benefit other beings?" She answered, "That will be in the southwest. To expand  on that, it will be in the areas of Dra(Grwa), Drachi (Grwa phyi), and Trengpo  ('Phreng po)." He asked, "Well, is it definite that I will benefit others?" She 

254 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

replied, "From this point onward much [benefit] will ensue. In your next life,  [you will bring] even vaster benefit than that to beings." [Longchenpa] asked,  "Where will my future life [transpire]?" She replied, "[Your activities] will be  very vast in the Lhodrak (Lho brag) region, and in the border areas between  Mon, Tibet, and India." He asked, "Will that be Mon Bumthang?" She replied,  "Precisely! The Guru is named Drimay Ozer." He then asked, "Is that [the  rebirth of Tshultrim Dorje] explained in The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis?" She  replied, "Yes, precisely! You're not mistaken at all!"  

He asked, "Well, if that's the case, am I now allowed to give the empower ments and guidance just as explained from The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis?"  She replied, "Since [these teachings] are yours, certainly!" He asked, "Won't  people come to see me as a charletan?" She replied, "What's the point in those  people's gossip? The fortunate ones will gather [around you] out of faith, while  those without the fortune wouldn't show up even if no one at all slandered  you. They would slander even the Buddha himself."  

I asked, "Well then, where should I disclose these sacred precepts of the  Seminal Heart? Should I disclose them at the site of the Goddess Vajra Tur quoise Lamp?" She replied, "Since this is a place where dakinis naturally gather,  you should disclose them up here." I asked, "Will I extract the Treasure at  Bumthang in this life?" She replied, "If you have three or four disciples with  exceedingly immaculate commitments, you will extract it." I asked, "Do I have  such disciples now?" She replied, "No. A Tantric practitioner named Karsang  who is slender and exceedingly beautiful will come. At that time you will  extract it."  

I asked, "And the Treasure letters?" She replied, "At that time a prophet will  manifest - you needn't ask." I asked, "And the rock moutains where the Trea sure is located?" She replied, "There are rock moutains on the eastern side near  the end of the valley where the central river in Bumthang flows to the south west. At their edge, at the border of the neck [of the mountains] running up  to its head [top], projecting outward like a sitar standing upright, there is some  swamp water coming hither. Atop that is [an outcropping] resembling a leaf  of a rhododendron flower. If you tie a rope to it and go twelve fathoms [up ward] , you'll find a square rock in the manner of a vessel. It has a triangular  crevice in its lower center, which is where [the Treasure] is."  

[Longchenpa] asked, "When will I meet the Great Master [Padmasam bhava] ?" She replied, "In the uplands of three valleys, in the lowlands of three  mountains, is a small rock formation facing southwest. Beneath the right corner  of the third rock mountain, you will meet him and he will give prophecies."  [He] asked, "When will I meet Vimalamitra?" She replied, "You have already  met him [i.e., Kumaraja]. [He] asked, "Does my realization reach the ultimate  meaning of the Seminal Heart?" She replied, "It is the ultimate."  

[He] asked, "What about other Treasures?" She replied, "In the northwest  border from here is an exceedingly high rock mountain - from its side resem bling spears' tips pointing upward in disarray, you will extract [Treasures]. But 

LONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINI S 255  

don't go there [now]." [He] asked, "Well, if that's the case, should or should I  not take out the Treasures of Tramo Rock Mountain in the east at present?"  She replied, "You have already taken them out [that is, The Seminal Heart of  the Dakinis, extracted in his previous incarnation]." The yogini Ozer Gocha  asked, "Where is Pagang Rinchen Dorje (sPa sgang pa rin chen rdo rje, another  name of Tshultrim Dorje)?" Saying "Pagang Rinchen," she was unclear for a  while. [He again] asked, "Master Rindor?" (sLob dpon rin rdor, a contraction  of Rinchen Dorje), and she replied: "Yes, yes. He is that one, he is sitting right  here." And she pointed her finger [at Longchenpa].  

The lama asked her: "It is said that after that birth he was to be reborn in  Bumthang. So how could that [rebirth] be me [since I was born instead in  southern Tibet]?" She replied, "[The prophecies say] that following that incar nation, he will be reborn in Bumthang after a brief sojourn in an Enjoyment  Body pure land, rather than being reborn directly there [in Bumthang]. Now  you [represent] that sojourn in an Enjoyment Body pure land." [He] re sponded, "Why do [you say] I now [represent] the sojourn in an Enjoyment  Body pure land?" She answered, "When Master Rindor took out the Treasures,  if he had kept them secret for several years and practiced, he would have refined  his skill [during that life] during a sojourn in a luminous Enjoyment Body  land for his own welfare, while benefit to others would have ensued through  the Seminal Heart teachings. Since in fact he didn't keep them secret, he wasn't  able to live out his full life span. Thus now in this birth your meditation and  practice of the rainbow-colored visions of radiant light should be understood  as that period of 'a brief sojourn in an Enjoyment Body pure land.' Others don't  understand how to interpret the intention of that statement, but in fact your  life right now is the intent of that prophecy."  

[Longchenpa] then asked, "At what point will I achieve [liberation] without  any remaining residue?" She replied, "If you meditate in solitude you will  achieve it in this current [life], whereas if you act for the welfare of others you  will be liberated within the [postdeath] intermediate state. Your emanation will  take rebirth in Bumthang, display many magical powers, and act for the welfare  of others. Then that emanation - surrounded by the five types of dakinis - will also depart to the land of Oddiyana, to the northwest of the Vajra Seat  (rDo rje gdan in Tibetan; vajrasana in Sanskrit) in Magadha, where he will act  as if becoming awakened into buddhahood."  

[He] asked, "Where did the Master Rindor die and how many years have  gone by?" She replied, "He died in Kek, since which thirty-two years have  passed [that is, 1307]." [He] asked: "Which Seminal Heart tradition will be  most beneficial for me to teach - The Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra or The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis? And how long will each last?" She replied, "Both  will be beneficial, but the Vimalamitra will be more vast. The Vimalamitra will  last one hundred years, and the Dakini Seminal Heart will last five hundred  years, beginning from this year."  

At that time, she made prophecies concerning the lifespan and beneficial 

256 DAVID GERMANO AND JANET GYATSO  

actions of the [gathered] yogins and yoginis as well. After a while, the yogin  Ozer Thaye ('Od zer mtha' yas) had a vision of a white woman with multicol ored silk clothes, a silk turban, and adorned with gold and turquoises. He saw  her dissolve into the lama, who then stood up and said, "I will sing a previously  unknown vajra song." [Longchenpa] then "sang the following:  

I prostrate to and praise the Blissful One [Buddha] All Good consort  pair,  

Spontaneity which is primordially empty and originally pure!  

1. As the condition of reality which is Mind as such beyond all  elaboration,  

The very essence of the purity of ignorance right where it stands,  [Buddha] Vairocana exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the buddha affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of the unborn beyond all mental objects!  

2. As the mirror of the unceasing ground for the shining of awareness's  dynamism,  

The very essence of anger's liberation right where it stands,  [Buddha] Aksobhya exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the vajra affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of mentation in its empty radiance devoid of  grasping!  

3. As the sameness devoid of acceptance and rejection as well as  affirmation and negation,  

The very essence of the purity of pride right where it stands,  [Buddha] Ratnasambhava exists internally, not externally - I supplicate the jewel affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The sameness of abiding reality evenly pervading everything!  

4. As the complete realization of [all] subsiding in the expanse of bliss  and emptiness,  

The very essence of the purity of desire right where it stands,  [Buddha] Amitabha exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the lotus affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of dualistic apprehension subsiding in bliss and  emptiness.  

5. As the efficacious action of awareness's penetrating emergence and  self-liberation,  

The very essence of the purity of jealousy right where it stands, 

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 257  

[Buddha] Amoghasiddhi exists internally, not externally - 

I supplicate the action affinity of the Blissful Ones:  

Inspire me with blessings to self-recognize as self-manifestations  The abiding reality of whatever manifests in its unceasing dynamic  flow.  

When dakinis deliver prophecies tonight  

On the tenth day of the waning half of the lunar month  

[A day in which the dakinis' influence is believed to be very strong],  This is a sign of the internal conjunction of auspicious factors  A sign of pure commitments among the faithful,  

A sign of the nonbiased emergence of welfare for the living,  

And a sign of traversing the ocean of cyclic existence!  

Joy! Happiness! A pure field,  

This world realm in its external environment of radiant light,  Is like arriving at the site of the Highest Heaven {'Og min, in Tibetan;  (Akanistha, in Sanskrit)  

With everything having the identity of gods and goddesses:  

I feel self-awareness transcends misery,  

I feel acceptance and rejection as well as affirmation and negation are  destroyed,  

I feel delivered from the treacherous path of hopes and fears,  

And I feel primordially free from the three fictive states of existence.  

Conceptuality in its projections and contractions subsides within the  five lights,  

And the visions of five lights subside into the primordial.  

Appearances and mind having the identity of the groundless Reality  Body,  

Even this life is blissful, the next life will be blissful,  

And through self-recognition, bliss will also be in the intermediate  state - 

Now I go from bliss to bliss.  

I offer this song as worship, O Three Jewels!  

Rejoice, O host of Dakinis!  

[Longchenpa] performed a dance, and then, after a while, up in the sky  opening, a red woman with jeweled ornaments manifested three times. Several  saw her and greeted her, after which she dissolved into the lama. When a white  woman also came in similar fashion and dissolved [into him], the entire land 

scape and space was seen to be filled with dakinis. . . .  

[Omitted sections describe the ensuing rituals and visions from the twenty-fifth through  the twenty-ninth of the lunar month, including many more dakinis as well as Padma-

258 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

sambhava himself. This culminates in a yogim's vision of Padmasambhava and many  dakinis dissolving into Longchenpa, at which point he again sings a lengthy vajra song.]  

. . . The next day [the thirtieth] the yogins and yoginis in general saw im measurably many dakinis all over the sky. At twilight, the yogin Ozer Thaye  saw a woman with braided hair filling the sky, who said, "Present an offering  cake to me!" Then, after a while, everyone heard "kiki soso" ("hail," used in  addressing deities), roaring sounds, the sound of cymbals, thudding sounds,  and so forth, from all directions. After a while, [we] presented feast-offering  cakes, upon which the guests, who had previously manifested during the day time on the twenty-eighth, arrived.  

Rinchen Otro thus saw a dark blue woman dissolve into the crown of a  yogini, who then began to perform. The yogini [herself] saw the trio of the  Master Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and Yeshe Tsogyel arrive. At this time,  the seven white Turquoise Lamp goddess sisters arrived, wavering and modest.  Prostrating to the lama, each dissolved into the yogini, who then said, "I am  Vajra Turquoise Lamp, and I request you come to my place!" The lama re 

sponded, "I want to stay forever in your place." She replied, "I would be happy '  if you stayed [there] forever, but you won't even be able to stay beyond the  first winter month." He then asked, "What do you want with me?" She replied,  "Guru [Padmasambhava] bound me to an oath of allegiance, and hence I have  

come to look after his Treasure precepts." He inquired further, "[But] the pre cepts are yonder, and their revealer has passed away. So what are you doing  here?" She responded, "Though the precepts are yonder, their meaning is here.  Since your good fortune didn't pass away even after you passed away [in your  former incarnation], I have come."  

[Longchenpa asked], "How many Word Protectors do [these Treasures]  have?" She replied, "They have many. In particular, there is glorious Vajra Sow,  Black Vitality Accomplishing Mistress, Dark Red Harm Giver (gNod sbyin  dmar), and Vajra Turquoise Lamp. In addition, there are the Nine Divine Gen 

eration Siblings (lha rabs mched dgu), the Twelve Teaching Guardian goddesses  (bstan ma bcu gnyis), and the Dang deities (Idang lha)." [Longchenpa] followed  by asking, "How many people should be introduced to the guidance? How  many guidances are there to give?" She replied, "There are eleven [guidances;  she then specifies a total of twelve]. Since the first three are fraught with danger,  you should sequentially introduce three, four, and then five individuals to  them. The remaining nine [guidances] should be done for groups of seven  [disciples]. Since in general [these Treasures] are fraught with danger, they  could pose obstacles to your lifespan. If you give guidance on them only a little,  I would be happier." [Longchenpa] asked, "Do you have my Treasure scrolls?"  She replied, "They'll come slowly - we'll make sure to remind you!"  

Then, after a while, she asked, "Do you remember my granting you a spiritual  attainment on your head?" The lama responded, "When I was practicing medi tation at Cokla (ICog la), at daybreak one day a dakini with golden mail came.  She put a diadem on my head, thereby engendering a wonderful experiential 

LONGCHENPA AND THE DAKINIS 259  

realization in me. Was that you?" She answered, "Yes!" He asked, "Are you  Turquoise Lamp"? She replied, "No, no! I am Vajra Sow! Don't you recognize  me?"  

[Longchenpa] asked, "When the seminal nuclei (thig le in Tibetan; bindu in  Sanskrit) are explained as primary in this [system], the third empowerment is  conferred to one with a sexual partner - how is this?" She replied, "That is  intended for engaging those given to desire. It is conferred only mentally for  those without desire." He further inquired, "In the context of the introduction  [ritual], what is 'settling concepts into the unborn,' and 'settling mentality  beyond into the incalculable' all about?" She answered, "What can antidotes  do to conceptuality? Introduce them to the intention of the extremely expan sive matrix, which is primordially free!"  

Longchenpa asked, "Well, then, there are many explaining these Seminal  Heart [teachings] - what is the point of myself explaining them as well?" She  replied, "It is said that there are such figures as the Karmapa and Rinchen  Lingpa giving verbal transmissions (lung), but I don't like their explanations.  Even a clay pot has a handle (lung); how could that be sufficient? Because each  [pot] also has an owner, these [teachings] need one [as well]!" Longchenpa  further inquired, "How are the Treasures of Rinchen Lingpa?" She replied, "Of  course they exist, but they aren't pure or authentic." He then asked, "How is  it that I have actualized you without meditating upon you?" She answered,  "Am I simply a deity who must be meditated upon, a mantra to be recited, an  object of offerings? Don't you understand that I am always present for all yogins  and yoginis with intact commitments and realization? I have been in seamless  union with you in all your rebirths."  

Then [Longchenpa] inquired, "What does the location of Princess [Pema sel]'s wealth that is concealed in Chimphu look like?" She replied, "It is in a  flat area in a rock mountain that resembles an offering of divine foods. But the  time has not come for it yet." He then asked, "How long will it be until that  Treasure of Vimalamitra is extracted?" She answered, "Fifteen years from now,  it will be extracted by a white Tantric adept, who will translate them and spread  them. In it will be the four profound volumes, which will come into your  hands."  

Then on the first of the next month, he sent the yogin Ozer Gocha to get  the text [of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis]. When he was on the road back,  the tip of a rainbow touched and encircled the text. In particular, all the male  and female yogins saw it linked to Rimocen by a five-colored rainbow on the  night that he arrived at Chukpo ('Phyug po) rock mountain. In a dream of  Geshe Lorin (dGe bshes blo rin), a woman told him, "Though he is considering  departing to the border area, I must not allow it." On the ninth [Ozer Gocha]  escorted the texts [back]. That evening when [Longchenpa] was enjoying the  communal feast offerings after performing ritual confessions as part of fulfill ment rituals, a dakini descended. Saying, "The lama and disciples have con 

gregated for instruction," she performed many dances.  

Then on the tenth, many yogins and yoginis saw an even vaster gathering 

260 DAVID GERMAN O AN D JANET GYATSO  

of dakinis than before. During the day of the eleventh, when the earlier guid ance finished and the yogins and yoginis who were senior students were dis persing, Yeshey Tsogyel descended into one yogini. She gave voice to a lot of  dakini sounds. When a grand fire ceremony was done at twilight, she gave a  little siddhi [substance] one by one to some people, and then told them, "Don't  talk at all [and stay] to one side." [She] opened all the vessels and prepared  auspicious connections for the siddhi to descend, and [she] sequentially di rected all the siddhi substances to the lama. He said, "Great benefit to living  beings and sublime prosperity will ensue [from this]." The siddhi substances  were then carried to the lama's quarters, and dawn broke. When the sun rose,  and a yogin and yogini went outside to demarcate borders for a strict retreat,  

she [again] gave voice to various dakini sounds and danced.  Then on the twilight of the twelfth, she was contemplating opening the  gateway for these teachings, and performed all the dakini-empowerment sym bols with a skull cup, mirror, and vase. At that time, she taught the instructions  on the manifestation of all appearances and beings as luminous visions by  means of an introduction to the space of the female consort (yum mkha'). That  night the introduction to the fourth [empowerment] was born in the Lama's  heart for the first time. At that time, he asked, "What are these - the stars in  the sky and so forth?" She replied, "They are lamas who think they are gods,  and so forth." One person thought to himself that she was lying, but that  [despite this] whatever she did was permitted [by Longchenpa]. She acted in  the same way for all five senses [which were being evoked in this ritual intro duction] - in the context of sound, she strung a bell on her staff and beat it  on the ground, questioning insistently, "What do you hear it as? What is being  said?" Some voiced their doubts [about her] as before. [However], at that time  the lama himself obtained the introduction to [the realization that] all phe nomena are impossible to pinpoint as such; they appear in the manner that  they are imputed.  

During this, the yogini was able to read [everyone's] mind, and when they  became attached to mental states of faith and so forth, she said, Phat to the  demon of exultation! Phat to the demon of arrogance! Phat to the demon of  dualistic grasping!" and raised a great commotion. Everyone thus became  frightened and panicky. The Lama [however] understood all phenomena as  serving to refine his skill in being divested of presumptions and objectification,  and knew it as the mirror of realization. That night [he transmitted] the ritual  introduction into the way of gazing for the empowerment to primordial gnosis  and so forth. Similarly, she danced the next day and gave voice to a lot of  dakini sounds. At daybreak the next day, as the lama was sleeping, his mind  spaced out into radiant light: upward was the vision of original purity, in  between were clusters of Enjoyment Bodies, downward the modes of manifes tation of the six types of living beings; and he heard a variety of sounds and  languages. He was aware of all of this with his mind, yet it appeared devoid of  any coarse [substantiality]. The continuity of his ordinary memory and thoughtLONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINI S 261  

had become broken in the preceding moment, and he spaced out as if fainting  in a state of intense red vision with a blue tinge. Then his awareness projected  out into the coarser manifestations of spontaneity, and he spaced out within  the upper original purity, the intermediate Enjoyment Bodies, and the lower  Emanational Bodies. After a while, the yoginl came, and said, "That previous  [experience] was an introduction to remaining without ignorance [as every 

thing] dissolves into internal radiance within primeval original purity. The so called 'fainting' was a fainting within the state of reality, and hence you must  raise [yourself out of it.] The subsequent [experience] was an introduction to  the external radiance of emission of Emanational Bodies along with the manner  of gradually straying." Then many rainbow colors previously absent manifested  all over the sky in forms resembling the individual Word Protectors. When he  asked what they were, she replied, "It is those [Word Protectors themselves]."  When the sun rose, she gave an introduction to many different symbols and  their meanings.  

At noon, as the lama was sitting on the throne, [Yeshe] Tsogyel put three  layers of garments [on him], and said, "Everyone offer donations and prostrate!  Today [you] sons must be diligent!" When each [of the disciples] prostrated  and made offerings, she made prayers for immeasurable auspiciousness, and  the sky was filled with rainbow colors. At that point she said, "This type of sky  appears when a lama who is a spiritual guide who will accomplish vast benefit  for others is appointed to his religious seat of authority." When she gave the  lama some siddhi [substance], he asked, "What is this?" She replied by saying  such things as, "It is an ocean of glorious wealth! It is the spontaneous accom plishment of others' welfare!" He asked, "How many if they are counted?" to  which she responded by saying, "innumerable hundreds of thousands." Because  of these answers, [Longchenpa] said, "Sublime benefit will come to living be 

ings!" In the afternoon, holding [it] to the five clusters of guests [miniature  images of the five buddhas?], she hung a diadem of blue and red silk on the  lama's head as a crown, and performed an investiture of him with many aus picious verses. At twilight he made auspicious connections for the emergence  of sublime benefit for others. There was an intense commotion of dakinis after  the introduction, and so he asked, "Would such [manifestations] accompany  the opening up of any other dharma Treasure?"  

Just as the sun was about to arise during the subsequent introduction, he  saw in the sky above the facing mountain to the west a lion throne with a soft  seat of the finest silk, adorned with a backing curtain of delicate lattice designs,  decorated with a variety of jewels, and topped by a peacock canopy. The yoginl  said, "This is the throne of the great knowledge-holder Master [Padmasam 

bhava]. It is a sign that you should sit on it. Look at it further!" And when he  looked, he saw in all directions a great vision of the nature of the five [-colored]  lights adorned by seminal nuclei. "It is an apparition of the field of buddha  bodies and primordial gnosis," he said.  

Then when the lama was sitting on the throne at noon, [she] offered to him 

262 DAVID GERMANO AND JANET GYATSO  

the volumes of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, a scroll painting of the peaceful  and wrathful [buddhas], a Vajrasattva mirror, a [long-] life vase, and a skullcup  [filled] with ambrosia. She also had each of the others offer a gift [to Longch enpa]. Having then prostrated and invoked [prayers] of auspiciousness, she  implored [him], "I request that you act for the welfare of others." So he per formed a permission [ceremony]. That afternoon, the lama said, "I need to  compile a guidance course," and opened up the text. One yogini saw the Guru  [Padmasambhava] come in the fashion [described in] his mind-evocation [rit ual] and dissolve into the lama, while [Yeshe] Tsogyel [appeared] on his right  and Turquoise Lamp on his left, dictating the words of the guidance. At that  time, he separated out the texts of two guidance courses, and composed them  as notes.  

In this way, Yeshe Tsogyel descended in actuality for six days, from the first  to the thirteenth, and she gave to the holy lama [Longchenpa] Drime Ozer  Pema Ledreltsel (Pad ma las 'brel rtsal) the complete threefold introduction to  the symbols, meaning, and analogies of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis, along  with the seal of entrustment. She then departed to Oddiyana. . . .  

[Over the next sixteen days there are further visions of Padmasambhava and other  figures. Various women appear who assist in some of the ritual performances, and there  are signs of meditative success among several of Longchenpa's disciples.]  

At midnight on the twenty-ninth, Namdru Remati descended and said, "Why  haven't you given me an offering cake? I've endured hardship for a long time!"  Everyone was panic stricken, and [Longchenpa] asked, "Who are you?" She  replied, "I am in all phenomena! I am present right up to the top of your head!"  He asked again, and she said, "I am Namdru Remati. Since I have been guarding  your Treasure, [I] am going to give it to you." He inquired, "What do you  have?" and she responded, "I have some clothes along with the Master [Pad masambhava's] religious robe and skull cup. I have come [here] with the in 

tention of conferring these upon you. I showed you a miracle before, but you  didn't recognize me. The other day you gave everyone else an excellent com munal feast of offering cakes, but there was nothing for me. I was thus ashamed,  and felt like stealing everything!" As she said this, she seemed to become quite  reduced in presence. He asked, "How many are you?" and she replied, "We are  five [in number]." He further inquired, "What are your body color and hand held accoutrements?" She replied, "I, Namdru Remati, am black and ride on a  four-footed mule. My right [hand] holds a sword and my left [hand] holds a  bag of disease. Red Mistress of the Desire Realm ('Dod khams dbang phyug)  rides a three-legged mule, green Vajra Creature-Headed Goddess (rDo rje phra  men ma) rides a bear while waving her hand, yellow Vajra Mistress (rDo rje  dbang phyug) [rides] a three-legged mule, and white Vajra Action Lamp (rDo  rje las sgron ma) [rides] a three-legged mule - all of them hold skulls and 

LONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINl S 263  

ritual daggers as hand-held accoutrements. I am the Mistress of the Desire  Realm holding a saber and bag of disease."  

Then for three days she performed many miracles relating to Treasures and  caused an intense commotion. Then she descended again on the night [that  Longchenpa was transmitting] [teachings on] breakthrough, and displayed  miracles. At that point, the lama said,  

Having revealed the gateway to the Treasure of radiant light within  myself,  

I have no need for Treasures in the cracks of rock mountains.  If I have Treasures, that's fine; if I don't that's fine, too.  

If I have the right fortune, it's fine; fine, if not.  

There is no point in bartering your boasts of guarding Treasure  With me, a yogin who has exhausted phenomena, exhausted intellect.  

They each responded, and conversed back and forth a few times. Then the time  came, and [he] accepted [the duty to] extract [the Treasure], so [that they]  were pleased. . . .  

[The text proceeds to describe Longchenpa's transmission of further empower ments relating to the Great Perfection visionary techniques, which causes some  of these abstract visions to be seen by all in the sky. The figure of Yeshe Tsogyel  is sighted again, and predictions are made about Longchenpa's successors.]  

Then after a while, when the sun was setting, the lama said, "Since the em powerments and guidances of The Seminal Heart of the Dakinis have all been  completed [and it is time for the communal feast], be careful tonight!" When  he said that, [someone replied], "There is no beer." [The lama said], "The other  day the dakinis gave us siddhis. Let's call them tonight and see if they come.  Pour water in the malt dregs jug and collect [the beer that is thereby produced].  I will bless it." By thus straining out the beer, they obtained one jugful and  asked, "Isn't this enough?" He replied, "Since this won't even suffice for what  is needed tonight, collect [more]!" They strained more, yet all of it came out  as fresh as a first straining of beer from malt. When all the yogins and yoginis  were intoxicated, [Longchenpa] said in a playful manner, "This represents my  activity of emanating and transforming material things!"  

Then Turquoise Lamp requested, "I entreat you to come to my place [that  is, White Skull Snow Mountain]." [Longchenpa] pleased her by assenting, say ing, "Let me go first," and she departed. Then the Mantra Protectress de scended, and when leaving, said, "Something that you will find upsetting is  approaching." Namdruma came down after a while, and said "I request that  you not depart." The lama refused her, saying "I explain such profound teach ings to all of you nonhuman spirits but you don't understand. Being pleased  or displeased are [both] a miraculous show of mind. You can come to wherever 

264 DAVID GERMAN O AND JANET GYATSO  

I am." He then performed the conferral of an empowerment for meditative  contemplation. She said, "That was amazing; I am bound to [your] heart-mind."  He asked her, "Where did you go since the other day?" "I went to the pasture  lands to collect a first-fruit tithe offering" she said. In fact, at that time there  had occurred considerable disease among the cattle.  

Then all the yogins and yoginis offered a mandala of their own clothes,  ornaments, and jewels, and made vows to practice [the teachings he had trans mitted]. The lama rejoiced, saying "Many will emerge who will strive to be  generous and to practice in these teachings of mine." He then taught very  profound instructions on entering into the sheath of radiant light. At that time  he said, "Since my instructions are very rare in this world, you will be able to  accomplish rapidly a body of light."  

Then on the thirteenth, when performing the higher empowerment, a pre vious disciple from eastern Tibet (Khams) upset [Longchenpa] with inappro priate behavior. [Longchenpa] said "Some disciples in these teachings will have  impaired religious commitments." He thus performed ritual confessions as part  of fulfillment rituals, and departed [for Shukseb]. [Turquoise Lamp's] previous  statement that someone would come to upset him just as he was leaving re ferred to that [situation].  

Then, on the road by which he was coming, he performed a communal feast  offering at Chukpo (Thyug po) rock, and there were many rainbow-colored  lights and portents of the dakinis. Then, on the road along which he was going  it was sunny without clouds, and he suffered from the heat. He prayed and at  once clouds gathered and a wind, not too strong, arose and he also had a vision  of Turquoise Lamp welcoming him. When doing a communal feast at Chilmo  (mChil mo), again there were many omens of the dakinis. Then, when he was  invited to Shukseb, a dakini descended into one yogini and for six days she  gave voice to dakini sounds, and said, "I beseech the lama to come to Oddi yana." During this period, rainbows continuously appeared every day.  

Then he built a hermitage on White Skull Snow Mountain [above Shukseb]  which he named Oddiyana Fortress, and stayed there. He gave empower ments, guidances, and instructions, and again dakinis spontaneously descend ed. There were many omens and the sky was filled with rainbows. Periodically  his residence was linked to five-colored rainbows in the sky, which everyone  witnessed.  

Then the one with the deepest spiritual attainments from the empowerment  crowd, the yogin Ozer Gocha, requested that he compose a text on the em powerment, guidance, introduction, and so forth for the instructions of The  Seminal Heart of the Dakinis that had been previously [transmitted], and spon sored a communal feast offering with tormas [for that purpose]. [Longchenpa  then] stayed in retreat from the eighth of the first autumn month, and from  the tenth began the [composition] of the text. The sky was filled with rainbows  and expressions of the dakinis. In his dream, many crowds of supplicating men  and women were prostrating [to] and circumambulating [him]. They be-

LONGCHENP A AND THE DAKINI S 265  

seeched him, "We are bound to your heart-mind! Please look after us com passionately!" At night there was the sound of dakinis in all directions. Also  many unprecedented miraculous displays manifested to the great meditators  in the area. The first [autumn] month was like that, and up until the second  autumn month the lama spent his time supplicating dakinis and composing  the text day and night. Throughout this period, there occurred immeasurably  many auspicious connections that would benefit others, dreams, and visionary  experiences. Every day, rainbow-colored light swirled above his residence on  the col of White Skull Snow Mountain, and many amazing visions of light  occurred. Then, on the first of the third autumn month, he performed a cele bration for the full completion [of the text entitled The Seminal Quintessence  of the Dakinis]. All the yogins made prayers of auspiciousness, at which point  the sky was filled with rainbows, and inconceivably many auspicious signs  occurred. . . .  

[The text then concludes with lengthy celebratory verses].  

The Luminous Web of Precious Visions is set forth here by Yogi Pema Ledrel tsel - the one illuminated by the light rays of the sun, who is the glorious  Oddiyana Master [Padmasambhava] - through summarizing a portion of the  chronicle of the manifest emergence of the profound Treasures. It is completed.
