Ismailism, a form of Shi’a Islam, entered the Indian subcontinent toward the end of the eighth century C.E. In 1094 it underwent a major split, from which there emerged two main branches. The Nizari sect, originally known as the “new mis sion,” was first based in Iran, but soon spread to Syria and Central Asia, as well as into the subcontinent, perhaps as early as the twelfth century. As Daftary and Corbin have shown, Isma’ilism can be broadly defined as a well-organized rev olutionary type of movement, undergirded by a complex esoteric philosophy. Persecuted by the Sunni rulers of Delhi, who cast themselves as the representatives of an “orthodox” or “normative” Islam, the Indian Isma’ilis, viewed as heretics, generally resorted to the Shi’a custom of precautionary concealment of one’s true faith (taqiyya). At the same time, they adopted a strategy that involved accepting most of the beliefs and practices of the people they sought to convert while gradually transforming the same to fit the requirements of their own doctines. This method, however, should not be viewed solely as a tactic for conversion but rather as an essential part of Isma’ili philosophy: not merely a later evolute of Islam, their faith was also a “culmination of Hinduism.” Rather than rejecting the established beliefs and practices of local populations, the Nizari missionaries ab sorbed and adapted them in order to create what Maclean has righly called “an innovative synthesis,” in which Muslim and Hindu elements were harmoniously combined.">

  <p>Conversation between Guru Hasan Kabiruddm and  Jogi Kanipha: Tantra Revisited by the</p>
<p>Isma&quot;ili Preachers</p>
<p>Dominique-Sila Khan</p>
<p>Ismailism, a form of Shi&rsquo;a Islam, entered the Indian subcontinent toward the end  of the eighth century C.E. In 1094 it underwent a major split, from which there  emerged two main branches. The Nizari sect, originally known as the &ldquo;new mis sion,&rdquo; was first based in Iran, but soon spread to Syria and Central Asia, as well  as into the subcontinent, perhaps as early as the twelfth century. As Daftary and  Corbin have shown, Isma&rsquo;ilism can be broadly defined as a well-organized rev olutionary type of movement, undergirded by a complex esoteric philosophy.  Persecuted by the Sunni rulers of Delhi, who cast themselves as the representatives  of an &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; or &ldquo;normative&rdquo; Islam, the Indian Isma&rsquo;ilis, viewed as heretics,  generally resorted to the Shi&rsquo;a custom of precautionary concealment of one&rsquo;s true  faith (taqiyya). At the same time, they adopted a strategy that involved accepting  most of the beliefs and practices of the people they sought to convert while  gradually transforming the same to fit the requirements of their own doctines.  This method, however, should not be viewed solely as a tactic for conversion but  rather as an essential part of Isma&rsquo;ili philosophy: not merely a later evolute of  Islam, their faith was also a &ldquo;culmination of Hinduism.&rdquo; Rather than rejecting the  established beliefs and practices of local populations, the Nizari missionaries ab sorbed and adapted them in order to create what Maclean has righly called &ldquo;an  innovative synthesis,&rdquo; in which Muslim and Hindu elements were harmoniously  combined.</p>
<p>In fact, the syncretic form of Isma&rsquo;ilism that developed on the subcontinent  closely resembles many other religious movements of the medieval period, and  as such, was referred to as Satpanth (literally the &ldquo;true path&rdquo; or &ldquo;true sect&rdquo;) - a  name retained until recent times. This&quot;historical phase of acculturation came to  a gradual end toward the close of the nineteenth century. The first changes oc-</p>
<p>286 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN</p>
<p>curred with the arrival of the Aga Khan (the living Imam of the Isma&rsquo;ilis) on the  subcontinent in the 1840s. As increasing numbers of Isma&rsquo;ilis, convinced that  they were no longer subject to persecution, came out of concealment and began  searching for a new identity, the whole movement was gradually re-Islamicized - a process that has continued down to the present day. Nonetheless, the &ldquo;syncretic&rdquo;  phase - some six to seven centuries in duration - has left a lasting mark on the  Nizari sect, in the form of readily accessible rituals and texts. This &ldquo;innovative  synthesis&rdquo; was clearly the fruit of extensive exchanges and interactions with the  many indigenous (Jain and Hindu) belief systems that were prevalent in the me</p>
<p>dieval period. Because of the practice of taqiyya, as well as of a typical conversion  strategy, Nizari missionaries on the subcontinent never revealed themselves for  whom they were: as Nanji has stressed, they presented themselves, according to  the context in which they were preaching, as Sufi dervishes, or as Hindu jogis  (yogi in Hindi, from the Sanskrit yogin, &ldquo;practitioner of yoga&rdquo;).</p>
<p>On the Hindu side, the Nizari preachers drew from a variety of sources, both  Vaisnava and Saiva. They developed their own doctrine of Visnu&rsquo;s descents (ava taras), equating Kalki, the tenth of these, with their Imam who, apart from being  a religious leader, was considered to be a manifestation of Divine Light. Of greater  impact, however, were Saiva ideas and practices, most particularly those involving  Tantric forms of yoga. It is obvious, from numerous references found in the Nizari  textual sources, that the followers of Gorakhnath and other of the Nath masters  (also referred to as jogis) deeply influenced the literature and rituals of subcon tinental Isma&rsquo;ilis.</p>
<p>The Nizari literature is revealing in this regard. So, for example, the Agakhani  Khojas who now form the majority of Nizari Isma&rsquo;ilis in India and Pakistan, have  preserved a rich and wide-ranging corpus of sacred texts generally referred to as  ginans (the word ginan means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo; and is derived from the  Sanskrit jnana). Composed in a blend of north Indian vernacular languages, most  of these were intended to be sung (and many still are sung ) in jamat khanas,  their sacred assembly and prayer halls. Ginans may be replete with terminology  proper to Tantric yoga, and at times entire ginans will be devoted to hatha yoga  and the Nath tradition. These include an Isma&rsquo;ili version of the story of the  illustrious royal renouncer Gopicand and his sister (a work signed by Pir Shams,  a famous thirteenth- or fourteenth-century missionary and saint); a series of po ems explicitly referred to as Jogvanis (&ldquo;discourses on yoga,&rdquo; attributed to Imam  Shah, a fifteenth-century figure); and the text that will be presented here, a meet ing between Jogi Kanipha and Imam Shah&rsquo;s father, Hasan Kabiruddin.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to say a few words about the rituals of the subcontinental  Nizari Isma&rsquo;ilis, insofar as they have been influenced by Tantric practices. As  Shackle and Moir have noted, the organization of religious life in the Satpanth  (the acculturated form of subcontinental Nizari Isma&rsquo;ilism) differs from the fa</p>
<p>miliar patterns found in &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; Sunni Islam. Traditionally, Nizarrs neither  went to mosque nor recited the five daily prayers, but rather maintained and  continue to maintain their own jamat khanas, open exclusively to members of</p>
<p>ISMAIL I PREACHER S 28 7</p>
<p>the community, the &ldquo;assembly of the faithful&rdquo; (jamat), where they recite the morn ing, evening, and nighttime prayers, and sing ginans. Their most characteristic  ritual is the ghat-pat ceremony (ghat means &ldquo;pot,&rdquo; and pat refers to the low wood en table on which this vessel is placed), which centers on the distribution of  sacred water from the pot, which is either mixed with clay from Karbala (a Shi&rsquo;a  holy site) or blessed by the imam. As Ivanow has rightly stated, this rite may be  viewed as a symbol of conversion and participation in the religious life of the  community. Typically, the holy water of which all the followers partake - in a  kind of communion - is referred to in the sacred literature as ami (from the  Sanskrit amrta, the &ldquo;ambrosia&rdquo; or &ldquo;nectar of immortality&rdquo;); the same term is used  in Hinduism for the sacred fluid in which the feet of a divine image or one&rsquo;s guru  have been bathed.</p>
<p>A number of scholars consider this ritual to have been inspired by Tantric or  Sakta cults, especially those &ldquo;of the left-hand&rdquo; (vammarg; vamamarga in Sanskrit),  which may well have been prevalent among such major convert groups as the  Lohanas (a trading caste of the Sindh region) and untouchables. By accepting  certain of their practices, and recasting them into a new mold to meet the re</p>
<p>quirements of Nizari Isma&rsquo;ili ideals, the process of conversion was presumably  made smoother. Let us briefly mention the elements of the Satpanth! ritual which  recall the Vammargi ceremonies.</p>
<p>secrecy: those who had not been initiated into the Satpanth were not allowed to attend  their ceremonies</p>
<p>joint participation of men, women and children</p>
<p>caste mixing: all communities, including untouchables, commune in the assembly halls  communal drinking of consecrated water which, as Ivanow has observed, is intended  to replace the semen partaken of in Sakta or left-handed Tantric rituals  the pot itself in which the water is kept is traditionally worshiped by Hindus as the  Goddess, of whom it is a symbol</p>
<p>Here, it is worth noting that, perhaps due to the secrecy that surrounded the  Nizari rituals, Indian Isma&rsquo;ilis, viewed as heretics by the Sunni rulers (including  the fourteenth-century Sultan Alauddin Khilji), were accused of indulging in &ldquo;free  licence and incest&rdquo; - an accusation more accurately leveled against Vammargi  practitioners.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it may be said that, in conformity with the spirit of Isma&rsquo;ilism,  the ritual complex of the Satpanthis ought not to be regarded solely as a &ldquo;revision&rdquo;  of Tantra, but also as its &ldquo;consummation,&rdquo; in the same way that the Nizari sect  as a whole, in its Indian form, may be viewed as the culmination of earlier Hindu  systems. This is further corroborated by the fact that the spiritual message of the  Satpanth and its religious literature were considered to be a secret &ldquo;fifth Veda,&rdquo;  called the Athar Ved (literally, the &ldquo;immobile, stable Veda,&rdquo; not be confused with  the fourth Veda, the Atharva Veda). Here as well, we may detect a reference to  Tantric revelation, which is also viewed as a fifth Veda that, unlike the four original  Vedas, is accessible to women as well as men from every caste.</p>
<p>288 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN</p>
<p>The text translated here deals with the imaginary encounter between two presti gious religious figures: a Nath jogi who is an exponent of Tantric yoga, and a  Nizari missionary. In spite of its obvious anachronisms and other implausible  elements, this dialogue - in which the representatives of two different spiritual  paths exchange their views - undoubtedly reflects an historical situation in which  interactions took place between Nath jogis and Isma&rsquo;ili pirs (even if this ginan in  its written form is the creation of a much later period, the eighteenth or nineteenth  century). It is worth noting that some of its parts are still sung in the sacred  assemblies of the Khojas, as Zawahir Moir, who remembers entire portions of it,  has informed me.</p>
<p>The choice of Kanipha Nath as the central figure of the text, in the role of the  jogi, is certainly not a concidence here. On the one hand, he is one of the foremost  masters of the Kanphata (&ldquo;split-eared&rdquo;) jogis and is listed as one of the renowned  Nine Naths. In addition, as Briggs has noted, there is a tradition that traces the  origins of the Vammarg to this disciple of Jalandhar Nath, who was himself one  of the original Naths. Even today Kanipha is revered as the head guru of the  Kalbelya jogis of northwest India, a community of snake charmers who have  preserved various traditions and customs connected with Tantric yoga.</p>
<p>The story opens with Kanipha being cursed by his guru, Jalandhar Nath. With  the curse, however, the jogi predicts that his disciple&rsquo;s salvation will eventually  come through a saint named Guru Hasan Kabiruddin who was, as we know, a  famous Isma&rsquo;ili missionary. According to Isma&rsquo;ili tradition, Hasan Kabiruddin  concealed his identity in the course of his missionary activities, appearing either  in the guise of a Sufi pir (a Muslim &ldquo;saint&rdquo; - he continues to be revered by the  Sunni Suhrawardi order of Sufis as Hasan Darya); or, as Upanga has noted, as a  vegetarian Hindu sadhu dressed in white or saffron robes.</p>
<p>Jalandhar Nath adds that his disciple will recognize his new master when Kan ipha&rsquo;s miraculous chariot, now suspended in mid-air, suddenly falls from the sky.  This happens on the day that the jogi reaches the city of Uch (at that time the  center of the Nizari mission on the subcontinent). Although Hasan Kabiruddin is  but a child, he has attained true wisdom. The dialogue begins when, surprisingly  enough in a Nath context, Kanipha&rsquo;s new guru reveals to him the &ldquo;true&rdquo; secret of  Visnu&rsquo;s ten avataras. (Here, as in other cases, it is obvious that the prestigious  Vaisnava model is being used to counterbalance the Saiva and Sakta idioms of  the Kanphata jogis). This new revelation, however, concerns the &ldquo;true&rdquo; (according  to the Nizari doctrine) identity of the tenth incarnation of Visnu. This is Kalki,  whom he equates with Imam Ali (the Prophet&rsquo;s son-in-law) and, as such, with  every living Imam considered to be his cyclic reincarnation. Guru Hasan Kabi ruddin claims that &lsquo;Ali, the manifestation of Divine Light, is the original founder  of the Satya Dharm, the &ldquo;religion of truth,&rdquo; an equivalent of the term Satpanth.  Oddly enough, this appears in the manuscript form of the ginan as Saiv Dharm,  the &ldquo;Saiva religion&rdquo;; once more, this may be viewed as an allusion to the fact that  the Nizari spiritual message does not contradict or negate the faith of the Saiva  Naths but ought rather to be viewed as a kind of &ldquo;super-Saivism,&rdquo; a new revelation  that supercedes the earlier one.</p>
<p>ISMAIL I PREACHER S 289</p>
<p>Although he is impressed at first by his new guru&rsquo;s knowledge, Kanipha still  considers himself to be the wiser of the two, and seeks to please the pir by  asserting that he will be rewarded for his wisdom and will obtain miraculous  powers (riddhi-siddhi), liberation (mukti), and immortality (acal pad). To his sur</p>
<p>prise, the child-guru retorts that all these achievements (typical of Tantric yoga)  are devoid of value. There then follows a discussion of the four yugas (cosmic  ages); the nature of the world and of God; and the role played by Hasan Kabi ruddin&rsquo;s predecessor, the great pir Sadruddin, who is credited with most of the  syncretic features of the Satpanth. Recognizing the differences between this new  teaching and his former beliefs, Kanipha wishes to know to which sect (panth,  literally &ldquo;path&rdquo; or &ldquo;way&rdquo;) Hasan Kabiruddin belongs. Everyone, answers the guru,  belongs to a sect (or follows a path), but it is he who will reveal the &ldquo;true path&rdquo;  (Satpanth). He begins with a stinging criticism of all the outward signs by which  the Kanphata jogi distinguishes himself: &ldquo;What kind of jogi are you,&rdquo; asks Kabi ruddin, &ldquo;if you shave your head but do not shave your mind?&rdquo; The true jogi  should don &ldquo;mental&rdquo; earrings (mudras), smear the &ldquo;ashes of truth&rdquo; on his body,  and so on. Emphasis is thus given to &ldquo;inner religion,&rdquo; which actually coincides  with the essential Isma&rsquo;ili doctrine of the superiority of the esoteric truth (batin)  over the externals of religion (zahir). The dialogue continues in question-and answer form, the answers being much longer than questions, and often takes the  form of short devotional songs (like the ginans sung in Ismaili assemblies).</p>
<p>The passage translated here corresponds to the second and final portion of the  text and represents sightly less than half of its total length. Differing in its content  and tone from the first portion, it treats of what might be termed &ldquo;inner yoga&rdquo;;  that is, everything a yogin should be and do, according to Satpanthi philosophy.  Curiously enough, direct references to Islamic or typically Nizari terminology are  scarce; however, a few bear mentioning: Allah and the Prophet; paradise depicted  as Amrapuri, the &ldquo;City of Immortality&rdquo;; Islam Shah, the living Imam who was a  contemporary of Hasan Kabiruddin; the &ldquo;true believer&rdquo; (momin, a term that refers  to a Muslim in general and, in the Isma&rsquo;ili context, to a member of the Nizari  community); and the community of the faithful (gat).</p>
<p>In contradistinction, the passage is replete with words belonging to the sphere  of Hinduism and of Tantric yoga. These include: intellect (cit); consciousness  (caitan); the elixir (rasa, literally &ldquo;essence,&rdquo; &ldquo;flavor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;), the three prin cipal channels of the yogic body (ida, pingala and susumna) and the moon (canda,  identified with the ida channel), the stage in which the yogin experiences the  &ldquo;inner sound&rdquo; (surat-nirat), the mystical sound (nad), supernatural powers (riddhi siddhi), and so forth. The soul is called hansa (literally, &ldquo;migratory bird&rdquo;), and the  Spiritual Master the Hansa Purus, literally, the &ldquo;Man of the soul or breath.&rdquo; The  body is also described as navsar (literally &ldquo;nine-head&rdquo;), and inhabited by &ldquo;five  ministers,&rdquo; probable allusions to the yogic image of the nine bodily orifices and  the five senses.</p>
<p>The lesson that is transmitted by the Isma&rsquo;ili pir to his Nath disciple does not,  therefore, deny the value of such purely hatha yogic techniques as postures (as anas), breath control (pranayama), and meditation (dhyan). However, it simulta-</p>
<p>290 DOMINIQUE-SIL A KHAN</p>
<p>neously emphasizes the necessity of true knowledge and of following a guru who  alone can show the true path. &ldquo;Search with your breath, and place your hope in  the Invisible Master (Alakh Purus, literally, the &ldquo;Cosmic man who defies descrip tion&rdquo;) is a message comprehensible to Nath and Nizari alike. The Isma&rsquo;ili Guru  is also represented by alchemical symbols, which are an essential part of Tantric  yogic imagery: &quot; If you find the Guru you will be transmuted&rdquo;; and &ldquo;The true  Guru is like mercury, the sadhu is like copper: if the two are rubbed together one  obtains gold.&rdquo; As will be seen throughout, characteristically Tantric &ldquo;intentional  language&rdquo; (sandha bhasa) is also used extensively, for example to describe the state  experienced by the accomplished yogin: &ldquo;sound (nad) is resounding without a  mouth . . . without feet you come and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final portion of the text, immediately preceding the brief conclusion (in  which it is related that Kanipha is released from his guru&rsquo;s curse and granted  liberation) is actually a devotional song, a short ginan that, in the Nizari tradition,  is also attributed to an earlier missionary, Pir Shams, and which appears in Kas</p>
<p>sam&rsquo;s selected translations of the ginans. It seemingly sums up the entire message  of the Satpanthi preachers, asserting what a &ldquo;true jogi&rdquo; or fakir (holy man, literally  &ldquo;poor man&rdquo;) should be. Therefore, in accordance with the imaginary vision of the  poets who composed this text, one could say that Kanipha does not, by becoming  a member of the Isma&rsquo;ili community, cease to be a yogin, because the Satpanth  is a kind of &ldquo;super-yoga&rdquo; that encompasses and complements the traditional val</p>
<p>ues of Tantra.</p>
<p>The Conversation between Guru Hasan Kabiruddin and Jogi Kanipha exists in both  manuscript and printed form. The manuscripts are written in the sacred (and  once secret) alphabet of the Nizari Khojas known as Khojki, whereas the printed  texts use both the Khojki and the Gujarati scripts. No critical texts have yet been  established, and the publications that are available are more or less revised copies  of a collection of ginans brought together by an Isma&rsquo;ili named Lalji Devraj at the  beginning of the twentieth century; these constituted the official canon at that  time. Here we have used a version published in Bombay in 1921; no other pub lication data are available. I am deeply indebted to Zawahir Moir, who not only  provided me with the text in Gujarati script but also helped me to understand its  meaning and establish the translation.</p>

<p>The jogi says: Impurity says, &ldquo;I am the queen of the world.&rdquo; Impurity is  removed by water, and the impurity of water by wind - but who will remove  the impurity of the soul, O Pir?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guru says: The body is like a pot, the mind is like musk, and knowledge  is the light of the soul. The man in whose heart Allah and the Prophet dwell - why should he be affected by impurity, O Jogi?</p>

<p>The guru says: the mind is called the pandit; the body our pind; we are the  children of the venerable Islam Shah; in the assembly of the pious, meditation  should be your food: in this way you shall reach the City of Immortality, O  Jogi</p>

<p>The jogi says: What is your sacred thread? What is your loincloth? What is  your word? What is your sacred book, O Pir?</p>

<p>The jogi says: What is the city? What is the place? Who are the ministers?  Who is the king? Who is the vizier? Tell me this, O Pir!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guru says: The city is the body; navsar [&ldquo;nine-head&rdquo;] is the place, and  there are five ministers within. The soul (hansa) is the king, the breath (pavan)  is the vizier: know [the secret of] this city, O Jogi!</p>

<p>The jogi says : Who is asleep? Who is awake? Who identifies the ten  directions? Who recognizes the Guru? Who brings one to the [true] path, O  Pir?</p>

<li>
<p>The guru says: The soul is awake; the flesh is asleep; cosmic illusion (maya)  identifies the ten directions and knowledge recognizes the Guru. It is therefore  knowledge that brings one to the [true] path, O Jogi!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The jogi says: Which are the pilgrimage centers of the four cosmic ages,  and which are the pilgrimage sites of the true believers? Which is the pilgrim age site of the running river, and which is that of the six philosophical schools,  OPir?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guru says: The pilgrimage sites of the four cosmic ages are nonexistent;  the pilgrimage sites of the true believer are [composed of] knowledge; the  pilgrimage site of the running river is within [you]; the Satpanth is the true  pilgrimage, [replacing] the six philosophical schools, O Jogi!</p>

<p>The jogi says: How many years will the clouds give rain? Who will obtain  salvation, heaven, or the inner world?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guru says: The clouds will give rain for thirty-six years; both heaven  and the inner world will be saved. Therefore, take heed in your mind, O sadhu:  there is no other salvation - it is ahead, it is far away where there is no teaching,  no sound, no ego, no primeval chaos. So says Pir Hasan Kabiruddin, O Jogi!</p>

<p>O renouncer, if you conquer the mind you can fulfill your desires, and if  you conquer the mind you will experience great bliss. If you conquer the heart  you will experience happiness; in this way [the fruit of] the yoga is ripened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, if you conquer lust and anger then the truth will become  sacred. If you conquer the intellect the moon will become pure - it becomes  totally pure, O sadhu!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, they ask for the elixir, and they wish to taste the nectar of  immortality, and they seek the lord of knowledge. The king of heaven has  made the body a throne, yet they go on searching for the Supreme Master  [outside of themselves]!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, the body is full of lust and desire is a goddess. But it is con sciousness that is the abode of the Supreme Master. Anger and selfishness are  the kings of the armies, and meditations on the inner sound are his ministers,  O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Above everything it is the Name that leads you to your inner depth. Action  (karma) is the true throne of the Master. When both yoga and practice are  conjoined, O Lord, then any action you perform is done well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, slay your desires, keep your mind concentrated, and do your  own cooking [work for your own transformation]. Control the postures, do  not fall asleep - and all will take place as the Lord ordains, O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, if you find your Guru he will tell you the meaning, and the  doubts of your mind will be removed. Without water the lotus flower does not  bloom: only the fool would laugh at this, O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, if you find your [true] Guru, you will be transmuted! O sadhu,  without a guru you cannot find the path. Within the circle of knowledge shin ing lamps appear: therefore without a guru [whose knowledge provides light  to his disciple], this will remain out of reach, O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, the night is dark! Your companions are your enemies, and  you are dwelling in another man&rsquo;s house! How will you find the path without  a guide? Make haste and consider this, O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, the true Guru is like mercury, the sadhu is like copper: if  the two are rubbed together one obtains gold. Just as you see yourself mirrored  in water, so your vision is made pure, O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, purity is the door to the true Guru&rsquo;s dwelling and compassion  is the Supreme Master&rsquo;s fragrance. The heart is like a pot - search with your  breath, and place your trust in the Invisible Master!</p>

<p>O renouncer, it is easy to slip in the narrow passage of the heart! There  even a needle cannot find its way, so ride the chariot of your breath and be  like a king on a throne. Control it, letting it enter in and exit regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, blossoms are blooming and there is no tree; sound (nad) is  resounding without a mouth! Without speech the praises of the Lord are sung;  without feet you come and go, O renouncer!</p>

<p>O renouncer, make your mind your seat, strap in your consciousness, and  enjoy the giddy ride! Ida, pingala and susumna are your slaves - they are the  servants of the true Guru, O renouncer!</p>

<p>Search your body to find its silken thread and do what the Guru says. Like  the mother-of-pearl that anxiously waits for the rain [that produces the pearl],  so the soul swells with eagerness to meet the Lord, O renouncer!</p>

<li>
<p>O renouncer, when the Spiritual Master appears before you the body is  purified. Meditate without the body, O you whose limbs are smeared [with  ashes], then [you will not be a god] but will reach a divine state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, both sound and the absence of sound are the manifestations  of the Guru. Intellect and truth are your companions. The Guru&rsquo;s renewed  miracles will be yours to experience. [Learning to practice true] knowledge  and meditation is like [riding] an elephant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, those who wake to enjoy the divine elixir will ripen, while  those who remain asleep will lose it. They will therefore lose the path, O Gu sain! It is only fools who wish to sleep, O renouncer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O renouncer, it is in the inner self that the miraculous powers dwell and  it is there that the eternal play goes on. In the inner self the Lord has planted  a garden and therein the gardener dwells.</p>
</li>

<p>O renouncer, in the inner self is the earth with its nine continents; within  it is Mount Kailasa; and within it are the seven seas. Without a guru the cup  [of the nectar of immortality] is lost!</p>

<p>O renouncer, the Lord has said, &ldquo;Look into your inner self!&rdquo; Only then  will you gain the sacred vision of the Master. Pir Hasan Kabiruddin says, &ldquo;Lis ten, O people of the jamat, you will then have no more rebirths!</p>

<li>
<p>O renouncer, stop both the moon and the sun [the left and right channels],  choosing concentration as your staff. Then the susumna [the central channel]  will begin to reverberate: few indeed are those who know this secret!</p>
</li>

<p>Thus, in various ways, the path to liberation was revealed to him by Guru  Hasan Kabiruddm - and he enjoyed it.</p>
