  <p>Richard H. Davis</p>
<p>Near the head of the Mahuar River in Madhya Pradesh, in the small backwater  village of Rannod, sit the ruins of an ancient Hindu monastery built sometime in  the tenth century C.E. On a wall of the veranda, carved on a stone tablet, a lengthy  inscription praises the community of Saiva monks who built and inhabited this  monastic retreat in medieval times. The poet speaks of the Saiva lineage called  the &ldquo;Drunken Peacocks&rdquo; (Mattamayura) as a stalk, &ldquo;free of knots, its strong  branches spreading widely.&rdquo; The poetic figure is historically apt, because other  inscriptions from the same period found in many different parts of the subcon tinent speak of more ascetics and teachers linked to the same lineage. The  Drunken Peacocks appear to have been a broadly dispersed, celebrated, and in</p>
<p>fluential group of religious specialists in early medieval India of the tenth and  eleventh centuries.</p>
<p>Here I translate selections from three inscriptions praising the Drunken Peacock  lineage. The first is from Rannod, ancient Aranipadra, about five miles from Kad waha, which archeologists believe to be the ancient Mattamayura, the &ldquo;Town of  Drunken Peacocks.&rdquo; Filled with the remains of some fifteen medieval Hindu tem ples, the hamlet of Kadwaha was probably the capital of a minor dynasty of  Calukya rulers in the tenth century, and became the prime seat of the community  of Saiva sages who derived their name from the town. The other two come from  monasteries located about 200 miles to the east, in the villages of Chandrehe and  Gurgi, along the Sona River in eastern Madhya Pradesh. In the tenth and eleventh  centuries, this area was controlled by the Kalacuris, a powerful dynasty of rulers  based in Tripuri, near present-day Jabalpur. As the inscriptions tell us, Kalacuri  kings persuaded eminent teachers of the Drunken Peacock lineage to resettle in  the Kalacuri dominion, where the monks were treated royally. A poet named  Devadatta composed the Rannod epigraphical poem. The inscription at Chan drehe was composed by one Dhamsata, a Kalacuri court poet, Damodara wrote  it out, and Nilakantha engraved it into the Temple porch stone on Friday, February  10, in the year 973. The praiseworthy poet Madhu wrote the Gurgi poem a few  years later.</p>
<p>132 RICHAR D H. DAVI S</p>
<p>Courtly poets like Devadatta, Dhamsata, and Madhu speak in the intricate and  highly laudatory rhetoric typical of medieval Indian inscriptional verse. Most often  the poets direct their tributes toward kings, but in the examples here they single  out religious specialists for special praise. Hyperbolic as the inscriptions may be,  they nevertheless allow us to retrace some of the activities and travels of these  Saiva monks and to reconstruct a kind of collective portrait of this remarkable  lineage. The poets describe the mythical origins of the lineage and its transmission  from teacher to pupil, in disciplic succession over many generations. They praise  the ascetic practices and virtuous conduct of the Drunken Peacocks, and their  knowledge of Saiva teachings. Most important for the court poets, these monks  also come to interact with kings and queens. Drunken Peacock preceptors teach  and perform rites like Saiva initiation for Hindu rulers, and in return receive the  royal patronage that enables them to construct temples and substantial stone  monastic centers. Of course, it is also thanks to their intimate relations with  royalty that we have these contemporary accounts of the Drunken Peacocks, for  court poets celebrated only those religious specialists the court deemed worthy  of royal favor.</p>
<p>The preceptors of the Drunken Peacock lineage adhered to the medieval Hindu  school of Saivism known as Saiva Siddhanta, the &ldquo;completed&rdquo; form of Saivism.  By the tenth century it had become conventional to speak of four main categories  of Saivas: Pasupatas, Kapalikas, Kalamukhas, and Siddhantins. Of these, the Pa</p>
<p>supatas appear to be the oldest distinct school. Followers of Siva as Pasupati, the  &ldquo;Lord of All Creatures,&rdquo; the Pasupatas most often followed a renunciatory regimen  of yogic practices along with certain special vows such as bathing in ashes, and  conduct that was often intentionally provocative to orthodox sensibilities. More  unconventional still, the Kapalikas named themselves after the skull each carried  as begging bowl, much like the one attached to Siva&rsquo;s hand after his slaying of  the god Brahma. Kapalikas tended to frequent cremation grounds, and used meat,  wine, and other noramlly polluting substances in their propitiations. The Kala mukhas, &ldquo;black-faced&rdquo; Saivas, constituted a branch of Pasupatas prevalent mainly  in southern India. Of the four schools, Saiva Siddhanta was the most respectable  according to standards of ordinary Indian society. Followers of the Siddhanta  based their practices and their theology on a group of texts called the Agamas,  revelations of Siva himself (see Davis 1991). Like their fellow Saivas, they prac ticed yogic austerities, and they were closely affiliated with Siva temples, which  became prominent in the religious life of early medieval India. As the inscriptions  of the Drunken Peacocks indicate, these Siddhantins were respectable enough to  compete successfully with other long-established groups of religious specialists  such as Vedic brahmans for royal support. The monks of the Drunken Peacock  lineage gained their name from the monastic center Mattamayura, apparently,  and not by emulating the kind of wild behavior we might expect of inebriated  peacocks.</p>
<p>All things must have a beginning, and an eminent medieval Hindu lineage of  sages required a suitably ancient and holy source. In the Rannod inscription,</p>
<p>THE DRUNKE N PEACOCKS 133</p>
<p>Devadatta provides a brief origin myth. Once in the Pine Forest, a famous Him alayan hermitage, the orthodox god Brahma approached Siva with all due devo tion at the completion of a sacrifice. Siva was so pleased by this sign of respect  that he initiated Brahma. This act of divine favor, claims the poet, engendered  the line of Saiva ascetics later to be known as Drunken Peacocks, as a fruit might  contain a seed that grows into a far-reaching tree. The inscription goes on to trace  a number of teachers of the lineage, culminating with the sage Purandara, who  initiated King Avantivarman of Mattamayura. Thus Haridatta traces the lineage&rsquo;s  trajectory from forest retreat to royal capital, from the mythical interactions of  gods to the worldly domain of kings and priests.</p>
<p>All the Drunken Peacock inscriptions describe interactions between sages and  rulers. The Rannod inscription narrates what can be taken as a paradigm for  proper and respectful reciprocal relations between ascetic preceptor and king.  King Avantivarman hears about Saiva initiation and immediately travels to visit  Purandara at his ascetic retreat. The king shows his profound respect to the sage  and finally persuades him to travel to his own domain. When the sage has been  resettled, the king asks to receive Saiva initiation (diksa), the most significant and  efficacious ceremony in the Agama system of ritual. Purandara performs the rites,  and the king subsequently becomes successful in all his endeavors. As a gift for  his guru, the king offers Purandara the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of his kingdom, and Purandara  utilizes some of these royal resources to construct a great monastery in the capital  city, Mattamayura. Subsequently he builds a second monastery, identified as a  &ldquo;retreat for ascetics,&rdquo; some distance from the capital at Rannod, on whose veranda  this account was inscribed. The remains at Mattamayura and Rannod are among  the very earliest Hindu monasteries archeologists have identified.</p>
<p>Although most inscriptions portray relations between sages and royalty in an  equally ideal light, an inscription found in the Mattamayura (modern Kadwaha)  monastery (too fragmented to be included among the translations here) allows us  to see some sensitive points in these interactions (see Mirashi and Shastri 1968).  An emperor named Hariraja visits the monastery to receive an audience (darsana,  literally, a viewing) with the pontiff, probably Sadasiva, second in disciplic suc</p>
<p>cession after Purandara. However, Sadasiva first makes diplomatic enquiries into  his identity: &ldquo;Who is this king, who seems so full of life?&rdquo; Only after an officer in  the royal retinue has assured the sage of the king&rsquo;s pure descent within the Pra tihara clan - the Pratiharas being the most powerful dynasty of northern India in  the tenth century - does the sage agree to confer Saiva initiation upon Hariraja.  The king then tries to give Sadasiva some of the royal elephants, apparently, as a  preceptor&rsquo;s gift. Understandably Sadasiva considers this inappropriate, and forces  the king to make repeated offers before he finally acknowledges that &ldquo;villages  would satisfy me.&rdquo; The annual revenue from agricultural villages, of course, could  support a community of monks in a way that no elephant, no matter how distin guished, possibly could.</p>
<p>More intriguing, the Kadwaha inscription also seems to describe a magical  vendetta carried out by Dharmasiva, Purandara&rsquo;s successor, against an intrusive</p>
<p>1 3 4 RICHAR D H . DAVI S</p>
<p>local ruler. King Gobhata comes to Dharmasiva&rsquo;s hermitage and apparently causes  the death of one of the monks. Giving way to rage, Dharmasiva arms himself with  magical weapons and emulates the god Siva in his destructive capacity. For Saivas,  Siva is simultaneously the agent of creation and destruction, the one who brings  new worlds into being and who also annihilates them when their time has run  out. Here, the poet tells us, Dharmasiva defeats his enemy completely, as Siva  destroys the world at the end of the eon. Unlike Siva, Dharmasiva apparently dies  in his effort, for the next verse compares him to the sun sinking behind the  western mountain as his successor, like the moon, rises to dispel the ensuing  darkness. The Kadwaha inscription is too dilapidated for us to reconstruct this  event fully, but we are left with a fascinating fragmentary glimpse of a seemingly  weaponless ascetic gaining revenge on a king who had failed to observe proper  decorum toward religious seekers.</p>
<p>The inscriptions from Gurgi and Chandrehe trace one branch of the far-spread ing Drunken Peacock lineage. As Dhamsata tells us in the Chandrehe eulogy, one  of Purandara&rsquo;s successors at Mattamayura was Prabhasiva, who became famous  far and wide as &ldquo;crown jewel&rdquo; among Saivas. So esteemed was he that the Kalacuri  ruler Yuvarajadeva declared him &ldquo;master of all ascetics&rdquo; and managed to bring  him some two hundred miles to his own kingdom, where at great expense he  constructed a monastery to accommodate the sage and his students. Yuvaraja deva&rsquo;s wife Nohala had much to do with this invitation, for she was apparently  granddaughter of the king Avantivarman initiated by Purandara, and she appears  in other inscriptions as a great patroness of Saiva institutions. Prabhasiva and his  followers constructed more monasteries and temples, making the Drunken Pea cock lineage a powerful religious presence throughout the Kalacuri kingdom.</p>
<p>The Kalacuri branch was not the only limb growing from the Drunken Peacock  stalk. During the early medieval period, religious figures affiliated with this mo nastic order appear in inscriptions found in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Or issa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamilnad, as well. The Drunken Peacocks were evi dently at the center of a mobile pan-Indian network of Saiva Siddhanta teachers  and ascetics.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to discern the sages described in these inscriptions as  distinct individuals, one can see in the laudatory poems a collective portrait of  the Drunken Peacocks as a distinctive community of religious specialists, differing  from other religious figures who receive royal favor. During the early medieval  period independent Hindu kings, members of the royal courts and other wealthy  elites patronized worthy religious specialists by giving them land, gold, and live</p>
<p>stock, and by setting up religious institutions like temples and monasteries for  them. They did so, in the typical phrase, to acquire merit for themselves and  others, or as the poet Madhu puts it, &ldquo;to gain the great fame that comes from  serving the good.&rdquo; But there were many who claimed the mantle of the good.  Kalacuri inscriptions, for example, honor orthodox Vedic brahmans, courtly brah</p>
<p>man ministers, and Pasupata yogins as well as the Saiva Siddhanta sages of the  Drunken Peacock lineage. All are described as virtuous, but their virtues differ.</p>
<p>THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 135</p>
<p>The sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage are, first of all, ascetics. They are  renouncers who have left their homes and families. We do not hear of their caste,  clan, or parents, as we do in inscriptions praising orthodox Vedic brahmans.  Drunken Peacocks trace their genealogy from guru to disciple, in spiritual suc</p>
<p>cession, rather than from father to son. As renouncers, they practice sexual con tinence, and the poets often remind us that the sages have extinguished all sexual  desire through their austerities. They also fast or otherwise restrict their diets.  Even as a young child the precocious ascetic Prabodhasiva eats only fruits, roots,  seeds, and greens. In addition to these bodily abstentions, the Drunken Peacocks  practice yoga and meditation. In meditation they especially focus their minds  upon the god Siva. They seek to &ldquo;perceive&rdquo; Siva or visualize him in meditation,  rather than seeking to gain a state of objectless contemplation, as in classical yogic  meditation. These ascetic practices are collectively known as tapas, a key term in  these inscriptions that I have generally left untranslated. The poets envision tapas  as a source of brilliant, fiery energy (often called tejas) that emanates outward  from the ascetic. Like those other energy sources, fire and the sun, tapas produces  both heat and light: it burns up impurities and sins and it dispels the darkness  of ignorance and delusion.</p>
<p>Although the Drunken Peacock sages are renouncers, they are not as rigorous  in their ascetic regimen as Pasupata ascetics like Bhavabrahman, who appears in  another Kalacuri inscription (Mirashi 1955: 186-95). Whereas Drunken Peacocks  sleep securely in their monastic retreats and receive regular stipends from their  land holdings, Bhavabrahman wears only a loincloth, makes his bed on a heap  of ashes, eats only scanty alms, and is &ldquo;addicted&rdquo; to his practice of yoga. His yoga  is the classical eight-limbed yoga outlined in Patanjali&rsquo;s Yogasutras. The Drunken  Peacocks seem less attached to the full scope of Patanjali&rsquo;s prescriptions, and more  flexible in adapting specific yogic techniques to their own needs. Bhavabrahman&rsquo;s  Pasupata austerity may place him farther from the hand of royal favor than the  Saiva Siddhanta sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage, for when he builds a Siva  temple near the Kalacuri capital, he does not rely on gifts from the king, but  rather obtains the necessary resources by begging.</p>
<p>Second, the Drunken Peacock sages are knowledgeable teachers. They under stand the great doctrine of Saiva Siddhanta, which they have acquired through  meditation on Siva and through study of the Agamas. The poets often compare  the sages&rsquo; knowledge and their beautiful elucidation to such sources of illumi nation as the sun and the moon, in their capacity to overcome darkness and  ignorance. Like Tolstoy&rsquo;s proverbial hedgehog, the Drunken Peacocks know only  one thing, but they know it very well. The poets seldom praise the Saiva sages  for their mastery of other traditional Indian disciplines of knowledge like gram mar, or for knowing other genres of religious texts such as the Vedas. Compare  this focus with the foxlike comprehensiveness attributed to Somesvara, an ortho dox brahman who served as minister at the Kalacuri court: &ldquo;He never felt doubt  when it came to the Vedas. His knowledge of grammar was complete, he sur passed all reason in his logic, and he was not bad in his understanding of the</p>
<p>136 RICHAR D H . DAVI S</p>
<p>Tantric path either. He was first in Vedanta, and adroit when it came to remem bering poetry&rdquo; (Mirashi 1955: 305-9). Somesvara also knew about painting, mu sic, the evaluation and care of elephants and horses, and the science of gemology.  The Drunken Peacocks would respond to the challenge of such autodidacts by  asserting the sufficiency of the one doctrine they did know. As Devadatta says of  Purandara, &ldquo;Even today scholars expert in worldly ways have still not refuted his  teachings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inscriptional poets praise the Drunken Peacock sages for their good and  pious conduct. Here the sages follow ideals of conduct largely accepted by ordi nary Indian society, as well. They are selfless, benevolent, and pure. The personal  purity of the sages seems to emanate outward from their persons and act auton omously on the world. When Prabhasiva walks from Mattamayura to the Kalacuri  kingdom, his footsteps &ldquo;purify the earth&rdquo; along the way. Notwithstanding their  name, the Drunken Peacocks do not engage here in deliberately provocative or  challenging behavior, as Pasupatas or Kapalikas might.</p>
<p>The Agamas divide their teachings into four main rubrics: yoga, theology,  proper conduct, and ritual action. In Agama texts the section on ritual is often  the most extensive and detailed, reflecting the great emphasis Saiva Siddhanta  placed on the efficacy of ritual activity. In the Drunken Peacock inscriptions we  hear surprisingly little about rituals performed by the sages - with one exception.  The sages repeatedly perform the rite of initiation (diksa) for kings. The Agamas  consider initiation to be the most potent of all ritual acts. There are two (or more)  levels of initiation, suitable to aspirants at different stages of attainment. The first  is &ldquo;common initiation,&rdquo; which awakens the initiate to the knowledge and presence  of Siva and brings one into the Saiva community. The Agamas convey esoteric  knowledge; only those who have undergone this common initiation may learn  their teachings. More advanced seekers may subsequently undergo &ldquo;liberating  initiation&rdquo; (nirvanadiksa), a much more ambitious ceremony that is said to burn  up all one&rsquo;s fetters, as a blazing fire consumes a heap of cotton. According to  Saiva Siddhanta, only those who have been initiated in this way may attain the  highest degree of final emancipation from all worldly impurities. The initiation  that kings receive in these inscriptions is common initiation. Anything more  would be inappropriate for rulers who continue to exercise sovereignty in the  everyday world. This initiation is powerful enough, however, to bring them suc cess in all their endeavors. The Saiva sages who perform the royal initiations, on  the other hand, have necessarily undertaken liberating initiation, as well as a  supplementary &ldquo;preceptor&rsquo;s consecration,&rdquo; which together confer on them the  capacities to act as preceptor and priest for others.</p>
<p>For their great religious attainments, the sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage  receive great fame (kirti). The poets seem particularly fascinated by the charisma  of these religious specialists, and describe it with many hyperbolic tropes. The  reputation of the Drunken Peacocks shines forth to reach all people in the world.  Note here again the use of light imagery, to evoke the glittering, glowing, ema</p>
<p>nating quality of celebrity. It is also reflected figuratively in their feet, glowing in</p>
<p>THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 137</p>
<p>the beams of light that radiate from the gems set in the crowns on the heads of  kings who bow before them. Here the poets turn a common Indian act of eti quette, where a powerful political figure bows to show respect for a religious  teacher, into an elaborate image of the universal fame of the Drunken Peacocks.  According to the Chandrehe inscription, even the residents of heaven get into the  act of celebrating Prasantasiva&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>Fame and glory bring us back to the king and court, for it is the fame resulting  from their spiritual practices that first brings these sages to the attention of  political authorities and court poets. The collective narrative of the Drunken Pea cock lineage begins far from such royal centers, in the forests and caves where  Saiva ascetics initially practice austerities and meditate on the god Siva. Once they  come to royal notice, however, their lives may well change. Kings bow, propitiate,  flatter, and ultimately persuade them to resettle in or near the royal capital. New  associations with the elite allow the sages to receive substantial resources in the  form of preceptors&rsquo; gifts and royal land grants. They construct temples and mon asteries, and increasingly take on administrative roles as priests and preceptors in  these new religious complexes. The institutionalization of the Drunken Peacocks  offers great opportunities for the promulgation of Saiva Siddhanta. It enables the  sages to transmit the teachings of the Agamas to a wider audience, to maintain  disciplic succession by training new monks, to worship Siva in temples on a  much grander scale, and to be available to the royal family for special spiritual  counseling.</p>
<p>For some of the Drunken Peacocks, however, such responsibilities must have  interfered with the simpler, purer ascetic practices with which the lineage began.  We hear of preceptors like Prasantasiva who build special retreats for adepts  (siddhas) and ascetics far from the madding crowd, where he could meditate  peacefully on Siva and converse with his more austere Saiva cousins, the Pasu</p>
<p>patas. I end these selections with the poet Madhu&rsquo;s celebration of Prasantasiva&rsquo;s  happy retirement in his spiritual retreat, while his disciples carry on the public  works in the Kalacuri capital.</p>
<p>The story of the Drunken Peacocks, then, reflects an ambivalence toward  worldly conventions and court life, a theme that runs through much Indian re ligious literature. The Drunken Peacocks are renouncers, but respectable ones.  They move from the periphery to the royal center, but are then tempted to return  to the more peaceful margins. They interact successfully with royalty, and use the  patronage that comes their way to construct considerable religious institutions,  but in the final reckoning a sage like Prasantasiva appears happier conversing  with Pasupata yogis than with courtiers and kings.</p>
<p>Were the sages of the Drunken Peacock lineage Tantric? When the Kalacuri  minister and scholar Somesvara refers to his understanding of the &ldquo;Tantric path,&rdquo;  was he referring to the Saiva Siddhanta teachings of his religious competitors?  Much depends, of course, on how broadly or narrowly one defines the term  &ldquo;Tantra.&rdquo; It is clear that, among the four Saiva schools of early medieval times,  the Pasupatas and the Kapalikas were the most direct precursors (in style, if not138 RICHAR D H . DAVI S</p>
<p>necessarily in theology) to later Saiva tantrikas such as the Nath Yogis and the  Siddhas. By this measure, Saiva Siddhanta and the Drunken Peacocks appear on  the conventional side. On the other hand, these sages distinguished themselves  from Vedic brahmans and orthodox religious categories. They relied on the Aga</p>
<p>mas revealed by the god Siva, not the Vedas, as their primary textual authority.  Through ascetic practices they sought to harness for themselves special super normal energies or powers. They used initiation as a central act in their ritual  system, and initiation acted as a necessary condition for receiving the esoteric  teachings of the Agamas. Finally, the system outlined by Saiva Siddhanta em ployed many of the ritual actions that formed the basis for later Tantric practice - mantras, mudras, the imposition of powers onto the body (nyasa), meditative  visualization, and the like. However we define Tantra, though, the collective por trait offered by these and other inscriptions of a far-flung community of sages  and teachers who initiated kings in Saivism and constructed monasteries to house  their many disciples may give us a revealing sense of the diversity among the  nonorthodox religious specialists wandering and teaching throughout India in  early medieval times.</p>

<p>who always turned his face from pleasure to seek the Highest.  But when she received his command to serve others,</p>
<p>She dwelled faithfully in the homes of good people dear to him,  Like a devout wife who follows the vow of absolute truth.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Supported by the stake of his beneficence, sprinkled with the water  Of his gleaming knowledge, protected all round by the power of his  spreading tapas,</li>
</ol>
<p>The tree of plenty made up of his fame grew in time until  It forcibly filled the whole hollow of Brahma&rsquo;s egg, this universe.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>North of the temple glittering like Kailasa&rsquo;s peak built by  Yuvarajadeva</li>
</ol>
<p>He too built a temple for Siva. People thought it a rival</p>
<p>For the tip of Mount Sumeru, and all three worlds called it a  marvel -</p>
<p>A stairway of his own fame leading up to heaven.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>In the shrines connected to the main temple</li>
</ol>
<p>That learned man of far-flung fame placed Parvati,</p>
<p>Siva and Parvati together, and six-faced Skanda.</p>
<p>At the gates he posted Ganesa and Sarasvati.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>And after he had satisfied seekers of wealth with gifts of burnished  gold</li>
</ol>
<p>He built a place for the Siddhas, away from the temple on the Sona  River bank.</p>
<p>Yogis enter there and - inner commotions curbed in discipline,  peaceful,</p>
<p>Undeterred in meditation, clear in mind -</p>
<p>they go straight to the land of the liberated.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>For the complete rest of those whose minds are intent  On staying at a holy place the sage built a retreat for ascetics  on the banks of the holy river Ganges.</li>
</ol>
<p>THE DRUNKEN PEACOCKS 145</p>
<p>Those who live in Varanasi, who love to worship Siva, after they visit it  Consider the ocean of worldly existence, though weighty, to be as  slight as the water in a cow&rsquo;s hoofprint.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>The generous master of yoga sat still in solitude, tasting inner joy,  His firm mind fixed meditating on the Firm One, Siva, at the center  of his heart,</li>
</ol>
<p>And passed the days with those virtuous self-deniers</p>
<p>Wise in the Pasupata philosophy of the Self.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Meanwhile, his pupils by their own lights lit things up as brightly  as all the rays of the sun -</li>
</ol>
<p>Daily enlightening those who had fallen into the deep darkness,  Their fame ripening as they served others with the gift of vision,  the splendor of their commands carried by kings on their heads - They moved about honored by the best sages and the people.</p>
