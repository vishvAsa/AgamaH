the Kularnava Tantra  

Douglas Renfrew Brooks  

Few Sanskrit texts within Saiva and Sakta Hindu Tantra provide as clear and  concise a vision of basic tenets, beliefs, and values as the "Ocean of the Kula" or  Kularnava Tantra. Traditionally regarded as the fifth section of the Urdhvamnaya  Tantra, a work that has never been recovered, the Kularnava Tantra as we know  it today consists of some 2,060 verses divided among seventeen chapters called  ullasas or "waves." Usually dated between about 1000 and 1400 C.E., the text is  as much a repository of traditional materials defining the movement or school  called the Kula or Kaulism as it is a singular, original document.  

Although there are dozens of verses, sometimes entire chapters, that require  technical and deeply esoteric knowledge to grasp even the first layers of meaning,  the Kularnava has much to say in broader terms about what it means to live one's  life immersed in the practice of Hindu Tantric yoga as a worshiper of Siva and  Sakti. The Kularnava does not contain all the materials of this broad Tantric  tradition, or even more of them than other texts within Saivism and Saktism, but  it offers a primer and a base to which various elaborations of lineage understand ing and practice are later added. In this way, the Kularnava seeks to create far 

reaching principles of generalization even as it defines and distinguishes a "nar row" vision of the Kula path.  

Certainly the Kularnava Tantra creates its own particular vision of the Kula as  a distinctive school or "clan"-as the word kula suggests-of esoteric initiation and  practice. The Kularnava appears to view itself as the quintessential Kula text, the  single authoritative source that defines both particular and universal aspects of  the path. And yet the Kularnava has been regarded as an authoritative resource  and compendium of essential teachings by tantrikas who subscribe neither to its  doctrinal definitions nor to its prescriptions. In this way, the word kula refers to  the highest or the most secret teachings of the "heart," a meaning of the term that  suggests yet another set of broad metaphorical connotations. I have throughout 

348 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

my translation used the English word "heart" as the term that suggests the widest  possible meaning of kula. This translation is based, in no small part, upon a  passage from the Paratrimsikavivarana of Abhinavagupta, which states that there  exists a set of meanings that link kula to a reality that is the very core, the center,  the heart of the Tantric deity Bhairava himself. That passage reads as follows: "For  truly the kula, because it is identical with the essential self of the Supreme, grants  that perfection. Kula is called the circle of rays of the splendor of the supreme  Lord Bhairava, made up of the fullness of his own light."  

Thus, when the Kularnava discusses such seminal topics as initiation, ritual  practice, discipleship, and the nature of divinity, we gain insights and perspectives  that apply across many different sectarian lineage traditions. Specific or general  points made within the text are subject to further interpretation within the con 

texts of particular lineages. There is to my knowledge no lineage, historical or  current, that defines itself according to the specific data found in the Kularnava  Tantra, despite the text's own narrower self-definition.  

The single common link among Kula lineages is their association with the term  kula as a means of designating their brand of spirituality. Certain philosopher theologians, such as the famous Abhinavagupta, further differentiate the "Kaula"  or "Kaulika" from the tantrika. But this is not a distinction of importance to the  Kularnava, and not the sort of distinction that applies to later interpreters who  identify themselves as Kaulas or who cite the Kularnava Tantra. It is the wish of  all different sorts of Kaulas to define their own versions of the Kula path. The  Kularnava is no different in this sense: it creates its own kula and yet that is not  all it imagines itself to be nor what it becomes to later interpreters.  

In addition to meanings that imply association by initiation, this Tantra suggests  that kula means "the essence of reality one takes to heart," and this is the meaning  that clearly captures its larger intent. In this sense, the heart of the Kularnava is  its secretive body of teachings and practices meant for an initiated spiritual elite.  To enter the kula, to practice the kula, to learn or achieve the goals of the kula  is to engage the secrets of the heart and to penetrate the heart of the divine. To  overemphasize the sociocultural aspect of Kula Tantra-as a school or movement  of secret initiations and practices meant for a spiritual elite-can lead us to over look its most fundamental claim: that there is a path leading to the heart of the  divine and an experience of the divine that leads one's heart to the source of  happiness in the world and liberation from death and rebirth. Although this  spiritual goal may not itself distinguish the Kula path, it is no less the Kularnava  Tantra's most important claim.  

The selection presented here intends to capture the Kularnava Tantra's broadest  theological and practical teachings. I have selected verses that any Kaula might  cite for the sake of defining the Kula path in the broadest sense. To these verses  one would then add any number of more specific sectarian ideas and interpre 

tations and, in this way, capture the flavor of a given Saiva/Sakta Kula Tantric  lineage. Kularnava verses are quoted by tantrikas both to support general prin ciples and in the context of very specific arguments and ideas. This is, in fact,  one of the text's most appealing characteristics: it can and has been used for nearly 

OCEA N OF THE HEART 349  

every purpose to which one might quote a "scripture." I have not limited the  selection to the verses that "all" Saiva and Sakta tantrikas might somehow hy pothetically agree represent common ideology, but rather have chosen those that  provide enough commonly mentioned material to permit a basis for comparison  with other texts, lineage practices, and claims of authority. I have avoided a se lection that reflects the apparent preference of the Kularnava itself to define a very  

particular and authoritative Kula tradition and practice of its own design.  All Hindu Tantras present themselves as very specific and usually highly de tailed secret teachings. Saiva and Sakta Tantras most often appear in the format  of revelations of Lord Siva to his beloved Sakti in answer to her particular queries.  In this guise, the Tantras emphasize that what is to be held in general is expressed  most precisely by the very particular points of view prescribed in the text. So, for  example, by way of demonstrating how Kula practice requires initiation into man tras, the Kularnava goes into exquisite detail regarding different mantras and the  implementation of those mantra practices it regards as defining the path. At stake  here is more than the revelation of specific teachings or distinctive Kaula forms  of knowledge; at stake is the way a tantrika learns to generalize, to see the whole  from the parts, to become visionary by focusing on a particular subject. In this  way, the tantrika learns generalization not by learning things in general but by  extrapolating the general from the particular. The Kularnava has a penchant for  levels of generalization that lead one through the particular.  

Historically we find Kaula practitioners, sometimes speaking for lineages, who  regard selections of the Tantra's very specific teachings as their own and who  vehemently disavow or passively disregard other specifics. At the same time, these  individuals may cling to equally selective aspects of the Tantra's broader vision,  picking and choosing as their own the themes, issues, attitudes, and practices  that the text commends. However, the Kularnava Jantra is neither definitive nor  exhaustive in its presentation of basic Saiva/Sakta Tantric materials, no matter  how authoritative it appears to be for so many traditionalists of different lineage  traditions.  

What is presented here is, like the full extant text, a feast of the general and  the particular, the common and the controversial, the accessible and the esoteric.  It would seem that the text presumes selective readings, expansions, emendations,  and elisions even as it lays out its specific views and broad sweeping generaliza 

tions. Certainly the tantrikas who today engage the Kularnava as an authoritative  resource are as often reluctant to consider its specifics as they are welcoming of  its generalities; however they regard the text as a whole, they select what they  wish to emphasize or concentrate upon, and simply leave the rest.  

The Tradition of the Kula: Teachings and Practices  

The Kularnava Tantra's interest in practical methods of self-realization stem from  its basic cosmology. The universe is nothing other than the singular, undivided  consciousness of God, Siva, who by his own free will chooses to delimit his nature 

350 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

to experience the joy and ecstasy of his own otherness - his divine complement  and consort, Sakti. Siva is both the material and the efficient cause of creation;  nothing exists which is not Siva. Sakti is his own experience of his original illu minative Self as true reflection or vimarsa. Siva chooses to experience his otherness  as Sakti for sheer delight, joy, and by the play of his own consciousness. He  

remains unfettered and unconditioned by the conditions he chooses.  Human beings, however, caught in the web of karma and deluded by the  exercise of their own free will, experience themselves as limited, conditioned, and  therefore disconnected from the ecstasy of divine consciousness. To put it simply,  what God does in limiting himself so that he may enjoy the experience of plurality  and diversity, unenlightened human beings experience as their own separateness  from the One who becomes the Many.  

The universe is God's body and creation is the process by which God assumes  two bodies, as Siva embraces Sakti. The Kularnava makes clear that human beings  must regard their own assumption of embodiment not as a curse of karma but  as an opportunity to experience the divine's own forms of embrace. This embrace  is the perfect relationship: Siva in union with Sakti, the guru protecting the loving  disciple, the Kula adept committed entirely to the spiritual discipline by which  the truth of the Self as God within, and guru as the divine outer form, is fully  revealed.  

This Tantra maintains that one needs to look to one's own experience as the  fundamental test by which the divine relationship and its joys are confirmed.  Although texts may instruct and reveal this truth, it is only the example of the  guru and the guru's own transmission of this experience that will enable the  committed disciple to transform his or her own life into a life of joy and liberation.  Thus, the Tantra commends the twin goals of human existence, bhukti, worldly  enjoyment, and mukti, ultimate liberation, as its promise to those who keep its  secrets and take up its disciplines. The Kula path, it goes on to say, is the sole  path that can promise both of these aims in this very lifetime; it is therefore  superior to all others. One becomes capable of true enjoyment only to the degree  that one is advancing toward liberation; similarly, the liberated are the only ones  who experience life's true enjoyment.  

To enact this vision of reality, the Kularnava Tantra places strict requirements  on both the aspirant and the Kula guru. The means to achievement are also spelled  out in detail. At the heart of the Kula path is initiation into the subtle form of  divinity itself: the mantra. Kularnava teaches specific mantras-several of which  are included in this selection and all of which are commended as forms of the  supreme consciousness. Its most basic teaching, however, is that these secret  mantras form the highest path to divine realization. More than mere means, man 

tras placed in their proper meditative and ritual contexts are none other than  Sakti, whose divine consciousness awakens as the realization of one's own Self in  identity with guru and God.  

In addition to the mantra, this Tantra endorses the empowerment created by  ritually employing the five M words (makaras), so called because each begins with 

OCEAN OF THE HEART 351  

ma in Sanskrit - wine, fish, meat, fermented grain, and sexual intercourse. The  makaras, which induce states proximate to divine ecstasy, reveal divine conscious ness as a form of experience that transcends the boundaries of ordinary conven tion. The heroic adept, in contrast to the mere animalistic person, achieves union  with his Sakti by experiencing fully their embodied relationship as a recognition  of the one Self in each other. Just as the divine couple are inseparable, so too the  true Kula adept experiences all forms of this perfect relationship. With these  experiences come the constancy of a state that appears in whatever form or man ner of life the perfected yogin adopts. Such uninterrupted states of perfect aware ness do not, however, exempt the Kula adept from his vows of secrecy or the  need to sustain a practice that reflects outwardly his inward recognition. It is, in  the end, the grace of the guru - who from initiation forward has led the Kula  disciple to the point where his freedom is as absolute as his discipline is uncom promised - that liberation is realized.  

Entering the Ocean of the Heart  

The selected verses for translation follow generally the evolution of the Kula teach ings as this Tantra presents them in the order of chapters. Certain themes are  reiterated in nearly every chapter, and key points are made over and over again.  As one studies more deeply the Kularnava Tantra's teachings, one experiences  more fully the radical nature of this path. The Kula is radical in the sense of its  unremitting demands on the adept to make extraordinary efforts and to use ex traordinary means to achieve its goals. The goals it sets forth are, in its own view,  the most worthwhile, real, and fulfilling one could imagine; one makes every form  of consciousness another aspect of the divine's own consciousness of itself. To  enter the kula, to penetrate the heart of the divine, is the divine's explicit wish to  be united in the ecstasy of its own creative, sustaining, and dissolving experi ence - at once a unity and a union with its own otherness.  

The Kularnava Tantra was edited with an introduction by Arthur Avalon (Sir John  Woodroffe) (reprint Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1965). The verses translated be low are based on that edition.

352 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  SELECTIONS FROM THE KULARNAVA TANTRA  

THE NATURE OF THE ABSOLUTE AND EMBODIMENT'S CONFUSION  

1.7 Siva, O Goddess, is by his own nature the supreme absolute, without as pects; He is omniscient, the agent of all, lord of all, without any taint and  without a second.  

1.8 He is his very own light, beginningless and endless, without change, the  supreme of the supreme, without qualities, being, consciousness, and bliss.  Sentient beings are but a portion of that Siva: they have come about from their  own beginningless ignorance, just as sparks indicate the fire from which they  arise.  

1.19 One should protect oneself who is the Self of all; the Self is the vessel of  the all. For the sake of protection one should make every effort [toward Self realization] , for there is otherwise no true vision of reality.  

1.24 For one who does not make every effort for suggestive cures of hell-like  bodily diseases here in this body, and so has gone to a place without medicines,  what could a person do when such diseases are in place?  

1.35 He does not see what he sees, nor even hear what he hears, nor does he  know what he recites, and so he is deluded by your maya.  

THE TRUE SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE: THE SOURCES OF TRUTH AND ERROR  

1.42 One should do today what is for tomorrow and what is meant for the  latter part of the day in the earlier part of the day. Death does not wait around  to see what has been done or has not been done.  

1.96 Not knowing that the truth is situated within one's Self, the deluded is  confused by looking for it in treatises. One whose judgment is so poor is like  the shepherd who sees his goat in a well when it is actually already within the  flock.  

1.107 The one true knowledge that gives liberation comes from what the guru  teaches; all else is imitative, bearing confusion and error. The supreme is the  one reality that embodies.  

1.109 However, the nondual truth has been spoken by Siva, freed from rituals  and tormenting efforts. Obtained directly from the guru's mouth, it is not  otherwise obtained, even by studying tens of thousands of scriptures.  

1.115 So long as there is false attachment to the body and so long as there is  sense of "mine-ness"; so long as there is no compassion from the guru, how  then can there be truth?OCEAN OF THE HEART 353  

THE KULA TEACHING: THE HEART'S SECRET TEACHING  

2.6 You must keep this teaching secret; it is not to be given to just anyone but  given only to a disciple and to one truly devoted. Otherwise one will surely  fall into disaster.  

2.7 The Veda is superior. Higher than the Veda is the path that worships Visnu;  the worship of Siva is superior to worship of Visnu; and the Right path is  superior to Siva worship. The Left path is superior to the Right; the Doctrinal  path of Saivism superior to the Left. The Heart path is superior to the Doctrinal,  and there is nothing higher than the Heart.  

2.9 The most secret of the secret, O Goddess; the most essential of the essen tial; the best of the best. The Heart path, which comes directly from Siva, O  Goddess, is transmitted from ear to ear.  

2.23 In other paths, if one is a yogin, then one cannot be an enjoyer of life.  Nor can an enjoyer of life be a yogin. The Heart path has the nature of being  for both enjoyment of life and yoga and so, beloved, it is greater than all others.  

2.33 The knowledge of the Heart shines in one whose consciousness is pure,  peaceful, whose actions serve the guru, who is extremely devoted, and who  can keep a secret.  

2.50 Even if one performs no other rituals or actions, leaving aside what is  commanded according to one's social estate and stage of life, the one who  dwells within the Heart is a vessel of enjoyment and liberation, O Goddess of  the Heart.  

2.68 One yoked to the compassion of the guru, for whom a fallen state has  been shaken off by initiation, who finds delight in the worship following the  Heart - such a person, O Goddess, comes from the Heart [he is a Kaula], and  not another.  

2.80 The followers of the Heart, knowers of the essence, do not consider other  religion, just as bees who serve themselves the blossom of the coral tree don't  seek to obtain other flowers.  

THE PATH OF THE MANTRA, THE HIGHEST PATH IS THE HEART PATH  

3.49 The supreme mantra that bestows the grace of the Auspicious One (Sri)  is the foundation of the highest path (urdhvamnaya). He who knows this as  our supreme form is himself Siva.  

3.50 This mantra is performed, O beloved, with each exhalation [which makes  the sound ham] and inhalation [which makes the sound sa] of breath, repeated  by all breathing beings, from Siva all the way down to the worms. 

354 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

3.56 Just as the fig tree exists in its subtle form in its incipient seed, so too the  three worlds that make up the universe exist within this supreme mantra that  bestows supreme grace.  

3.63 He who attains loving devotion to the auspicious guru who is my own  form is said to achieve the supreme, knowing the supreme mantra that bestows  the grace of the auspicious one.  

3.82 He who knows the mantra that bestows the grace of the auspicious one  knows all mantras, including those belonging to Siva, Visnu, the Goddess, the  sun, Ganapati, and the moon.  

The esoteric etymology of the mantra, that is, why it is called prasada-para ("grace giving supreme") is given next, focusing on the two elements of the mantra's  name, the prefix pra- and the word para. Next follow the instructions for "laying  down" or nyasa of the divinities in the form of mantra-names, invoking and  placing them within the subtle body. The mudras or gestures that should accom pany the nyasa process are next mentioned. In this way, the mantra in all its  subtle divine forms is identified and invoked onto the subtle body of the Kula  practitioner. The details of nyasa involve the recitation of mantras, gestures of  placement on the physical body, and mental identifications. The process of inter identification brings the ritual of the Kula Dharma into its distinct focus: specific  mantras, specific actions and intentions, and specific goals are enunciated. These  ritual details need not detain us; more importantly, the text implies their distinc tiveness and superiority.  

4.12 Performing this inter-identification, O Goddess, wherever a human being  goes he shall experience preeminence, benefits, esteem, and human dignity,  beloved one.  

4.127 Why say too much, O Goddess? This inter-identification is beloved to  me. It should not be spoken about to one who is not like a son, nor should it  be explained to one who is not a true disciple.  

Next follow the ritual prescriptions for the vessels and offerings, including the  five M-word substances - mamsa (flesh), matsya (fish), madya (wine), mudra  (fermented grain), and maithuna (sexual intercourse). These and other offerings  are called the kula-dravyas, or heart oblations. They are strictly regulated and  their qualifications and benefits detailed. Considered privileged and dangerous,  these ritual actions are a distinctive (but not unique) aspect of the Kula path.  

THE FIVE M-WORD OBLATIONS ON THE RITUAL PATH OF THE HEART  

5.71 Those who offer with loving devotion to us both flesh and drink, they  create a blissful experience and, being beloved by us, are the followers of the  Heart. 

OCEAN OF THE HEART 355  

5.72 Our supreme mark - characterized as being, consciousness, and bliss - manifests effulgently when there occurs the true enjoyment of the Kula obla tions [the five M-word offerings], and not otherwise.  

5.75 For example, just as a dwelling enveloped in darkness becomes lit by a  lamp, so the Self covered in Illusion is seen by drinking the oblation [of wine].  

5.77 Wine truly is the Terrifying Divinity (Bhairava) and wine is even called  Power (Sakti). Ah yes! The enjoyer of wine can delude even the immortals!  

5.78 A man who, having drunk a potent wine, is not adversely affected and  has become supremely one-pointed in meditation on us, he is liberated and he  is the true Follower of the Heart.  

5.79 Drink is Power, Sakti; and flesh is Auspicious, Siva: the Enjoyer becomes  the Terrifying One, Bhairava himself. The bliss that arises from this union of  the two is called liberation.  

5.88 One who serves oneself for the sake of pleasure with wine and the rest  is fallen. Having dispensed with one's own lassitudes one should indulge only  for the sake of pleasing the gods.  

5.89 It is said that indulging in intoxicants such as fish, flesh, and drink, and  so on, other than at the time of ritual sacrifice, is prohibited and errant, my  beloved.  

5.90 Just as the brahman is enjoined to drink intoxicating soma on the occa sion of Vedic sacrifice, so drinking wine and the like at prescribed times gives  enjoyment and liberation [on the path of the Heart].  

5.91 Only when one knows the meaning of the Heart treatises directly from  the auspicious guru should one take upon oneself the practice of the five im printing ritual acts [that is, the five M words], for otherwise one becomes fallen.  

5.105 He who practices the five imprinting ritual acts without the proper im primatur, O Goddess of the Heart, becomes contemptible even though he may  experience the Absolute.  

5.111 The divine Sakti of animalistic persons is unawakened and that of the  follower of the Heart is awakened. One who offers service to that awakened  power truly serves Sakti herself.  

5.112 One who experiences the bliss of union in sexual relationship as being  between the Supreme Power (Parasakti) and the Self - such a person knows  the meaning of sexual relations; others are inferior, indulging only to pursue  women.  

5.113 Knowing, O entrance of the Heart (kula-nayika), the true condition of  the five imprinting ritual acts in all these ways directly from the mouth of the  guru, O Goddess, one truly serves and is liberated. 

356 DOUGLA S RENFRE W BROOK S  

6.6 Pure in Self and deeply joyous within, bereft of anger and greed, having  turned away from the avowed ways of animalistic persons, one should offer  sacrificial ritual with a sweet disposition, my beloved.  

6.7-8 When by my grace a person has,after a long time, become firm in his  feelings of devotion, he should perform the rituals, offering the libations to gether with the offerings as it has been taught by the Auspicious Terrifying  Lord (Sri Bhahava) and according to the instructions of the guru - for other wise he will fall.  

6.9 One should perform the worship of the auspicious wheel (Sri Cakra) with  the discipline of mantras, O Goddess of Light. Being then in your company I  accept that [worship] myself.  

6.10 With the experience, "I am the Terrifying Lord," and so possessed of  qualities such as omniscience, the lordly yogin should become a performer of  the Heart worship.  

WORSHIP AND DEITY PRESENCE WITHIN A YANTRA  

6.85 A yantra or diagrammatical form is said to consist [actually] of mantras;  the deity has the form of mantras as well. The Goddess worshiped in the yantra,  O Goddess, is pleased spontaneously.  

6.87 As the body is for an embodied soul like oil for a lamp, my beloved, so  likewise the yantra is the place of all divinities.  

6.88 Therefore, drawing the yantra and meditating on Siva in the proper man ner, and gaining knowledge directly from the guru, one should worship all  according to the prescribed rules, my beloved.  

Chapters 7 and 8 detail the worship of various deities including Siva as Batuka  and the accompanying forms of the Goddess. Included are many of the specific  mantras, the yantra prescriptions, and procedures of worship, as well as the bene fits and prohibitions of such worship.  

AS ARE THE GODS, SO ARE THE WORSHIPERS OF THE HEART  

8.106 Just as We the Divine Couple are inseparable; just as the goddess Laksmi  [is inseparable] from Lord Narayana, or the goddess Sarasvati from Lord  Brahma, so is the Courageous Practitioner with his Sakti consort.  

9.3 Meditation is said to be of two sorts, divided accordingly as gross and  subtle. The gross sort is said to include a particular form, while the subtle  centers on the formless.  

9.9 When there is no longer any reflective consciousness and one is as calm 

OCEA N OF THE HEART 357  

as the still sea - the innate form itself being empty - such meditation is called  samadhi or Equanimity Consciousness.  

9.10 The purely self-illuminating truth is nothing like a cognitive process; one  can become that self-illuminating truth instantaneously.  

9.22 For one immersed in the state of the singular Self, whatever is done is  worship, whatever is recited is a mantra, whatever one sees is a meditation.  

9.23 When one has experienced the Supreme Self (Paramatman), the sensation  of identifying with bodily consciousness ceases; wherever such a heart goes,  there consciousness is in equanimity.  

9.24 When the knot of the heart is severed, so all doubts are cut away; and  karmas, actions, and intentions - past, present, and future - are destroyed  when one sees the Supreme Self from within.  

9.41 The body is the abode of God, O Goddess; the embodied self is God,  Ever-abiding Siva (Sadasiva). Abandon ignorance as if it was old flowers offered  in worship and perform worship with the contemplation "1 am He," so'ham.  

9.42 The embodied self is Siva; Siva is the embodied self; that embodied self  is only Siva. The experience of bondage to one's animal nature is how one  thinks of the embodied self; liberated from this animal nature identity one has  the experience of the Ever-abiding Siva.  

9.52 Drinking wine, eating flesh, carrying out the practices of one's own ini tiatory teaching, contemplating the unitive experience of both "I" and "That,"  so the Heart yogin dwells in true happiness.  

9.55 Valuing what is devalued in the world and devaluing what the world  values, this the Terrifying Lord who is the supreme Self has pointed out is the  path of the Heart.  

9.59 There are no commands; there are no prohibitions. There is neither merit  nor fall; no heaven and truly no hell for the followers of the Heart, O Goddess  of the Heart.  

9.62 What is poorly characterized becomes well characterized; otherness be comes one's own heart and what is contrary to righteousness becomes righ teous for the followers of the Heart, O Goddess of the Heart.  

9.65 Living anywhere, taking on any disguise, and [living] unrecognized by  everyone, in whatever social position he may be, he remains a Heart yogin, O  Goddess of the Heart.  

9.66 Yogins in various guises act for the sake of humanity; they wander the  earth, their true nature unrecognized by others.  

9.67 They do not reveal their true experience immediately, O Goddess of the 

3 5 8 DOUGLAS RENFREW BROOKS  

Heart, living in the midst of the world as if they were intoxicated, mute, or  just idiots.  

9.73 The yogin goes about his own life while the world looks upon him laugh ing, reproaching, and with contempt, keeping its distance from him.  

9.74 The yogin wanders about the ordinary world in different guises, acting  on some occasions like a dignified person, sometimes like a vagrant, sometimes  like demon or a ghoul!  

9.75 The yogin enjoys the pleasures of life only for the sake of serving the  world, [and] not out of his own desire. Offering grace to all people, he traverses  the earth out of compassion.  

9.77 Just as the wind touches everything and space extends everywhere, just  as all who bathe in rivers become pure, so the yogin is always pure.  

9.81 Wherever the elephant walks becomes a path, and similarly wherever the  Heart yogin goes becomes a path, O Goddess of the Heart.  

9.88 Whosoever knows the truth of the Heart and is well-versed in the treatises  on the Heart should perform the worship of the Heart; he is truly the Heart  follower [and] not another, my beloved.  

9.90 By initiation (dfksa) one is a Heart follower who knows the triadic truth  [as supreme, ordinary, and both], who surrenders to the auspicious feet of the  divine, who possesses the meaning of the root mantras, and who offers loving  devotion to God and guru.  

9.94 I do not dwell on Mount Kailasa nor on Meru or Mandara: wherever  reside the Heart knowers, I reside there, O my divine contemplation!  

9.131 Just as a tree gives up its flowers regardless of [whether it has] once  obtained its fruit, so the yogin obtaining the truth gives up attachment to  actions and rituals.  

Given this statement concerning the state of absolute freedom in which the yogin  abides with respect to worldly life and religious requirements, Chapter 10 next  describes at length the different occasions for ritual worship and different ritual  benefits, violations, and prohibitions. Also mentioned are specific deities, mantras,  and manners of worship that the Heart follower may enjoy as part of his privileged  spiritual practice.  

ULTIMATE IDENTITY AND IDENTIFICATION  

13.64 Just as words such as "pot," "vessel," and "jar" all mean the same object  [artha: goal, meaning, thing], so too are god and mantra and guru said to be  the same object. 

OCEAN OF THE HEART 359  

13.65 Just as divinity is, so is the mantra; just as there is mantra, so there is  the guru.  

13.66 The fruits of worship are the same for god, mantra, and guru. For the  sake of establishing myself in the form of Siva, I seize upon worship, O Goddess  of the Mountain (Parvati); for the sake of taking on the form of the guru I  break the stranglehold of fear.  

SECRECY, INTIMACY, AND PRIVACY ON THE HEART PATH  

10.44 One should not enunciate the guru's name except at the time of ritual  recitation, my beloved, calling him instead over the course of spiritual life by  such titles as Auspicious Lord, Deity, and Svami, and the like.  

10.45 One should not tell anyone other than one's own disciple the mantras  praising the guru's sandals, the imprinting gestures, the root mantra, and one's  own grace-giving sandal mantra.  

10.46 Lineage, scripture, levels of teaching, the practice of mantras, and such  must all be obtained directly from the guru in order to bear fruit - and not  otherwise.  

14.3 Without initiation, there can be no liberation: This has been said in the  sacred Siva teachings. And there can be no initiation without the preceptor of  a lineage.  

14.7 Therefore one should make every effort to seek always the guru of un broken lineage who is in origin the immediate Supreme Siva.  

14.14 The experiential knowledge of the mantra cannot establish itself in the  unworthy. So there should be an examination of the disciple; otherwise [ini tiation, worship, and knowledge] bear no fruits.  

14.30 Those persons who at the outset have no true loving devotion, who then  in the midst of their spiritual practice gain loving devotion, and at the end  experience the expansion of loving devotion, they assimilate the inner practice  of yoga.  

14.34 Initiation, you will recall O Goddess, is threefold: It is given by touch,  by deliberate sight, and by mere mental intention without acts, ritual, efforts,  or any other such things, great Goddess!  

14.38 The disciple becomes worthy of grace by stepping into the current of  the divine Sakti's initiatory power; where Sakti does not descend, no accom plishment can be claimed.  

14.78 Initiation is said to be twofold, divided accordingly as outward and in ner. Initiation into actions such as ritual the outer; the inner one creates the  experience of pervasive penetration into one's being.

14.86 That initiation by which those who indulge themselves in their animal istic nature become Sivas, opening the eyes to the Self, O Goddess: that is  liberation from the noose of being a mere animal.  

14.97 O Goddess, for one who is without initiation there is no fulfillment nor  true path. So by every effort one should seek initiation from a guru.  

LIBERATION IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HEART  

15.19 There are innumerable hundreds of thousands of mantras and they un settle the heart of one's own divine consciousness. The one mantra obtained  by the grace of the guru will provide every goal and accomplishment.  

15.34 Placing oneself in postures such as the lotus, the cross-legged, or warrior  pose, one should perform repetition of the mantra and offer worship. Otherwise  [initiation, grace, and effort] will bear no fruit.  

15.113 One should perform the recitation of the mantra by fixing oneself on  it, with life breath coursing through it, setting it within one's consciousness,  and making the deep connections that form the meaning of its syllables.  

THE NATURE OF THE DIVINE AS MANTRA IMPARTS THE SUPREME GRACE  

16.40ab Male divinities' mantras are called mantras while those of female di vinities are called vidyas, my beloved.  

16.116 One who knows the mantra of supreme grace is liberated whether he  dwells in a place of true pilgrimage, or a place without means to ford across  the world, or even in the midst of the ocean of worldliness - there is no doubt  about it.  

17.102 This treatise called the Ocean of the Heart exists within the heart of  divine yoginis. 1 have illumined it today; and with true effort it should be kept  secret.
