The Vaisnava Sahajiyas were Hindu tantrikas who lived in northeastern India, especially in the region of greater Bengal (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam), from approximately the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Many things about the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas remain unclear to modern scholars, including their origins, social standing, major personalities, esoteric practices, authorship of texts, and their continued existence into current times. Although much about their beliefs and practices is elusive - we have, for example, no existing written commentaries to help us in understanding key words and phrases, and apparently no living connections to the medieval teachers - what we do know suggests a truly distinctive approach to Tantric expression and experience. This chapter explains why the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas are unique, and selected passages from an important text, The Necklace of Immortality (Amrtaratnavali) of Mukunda dasa (ca. 1650 C.E.) will illustrate this distinctiveness.">

  <p>Glen A. Hayes</p>
<p>The Vaisnava Sahajiyas were Hindu tantrikas who lived in northeastern India,  especially in the region of greater Bengal (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam), from  approximately the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. Many things about  the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas remain unclear to modern scholars, including  their origins, social standing, major personalities, esoteric practices, authorship  of texts, and their continued existence into current times. Although much about  their beliefs and practices is elusive - we have, for example, no existing written  commentaries to help us in understanding key words and phrases, and apparently  no living connections to the medieval teachers - what we do know suggests a  truly distinctive approach to Tantric expression and experience. This chapter  explains why the medieval Vaisnava Sahajiyas are unique, and selected passages  from an important text, The Necklace of Immortality (Amrtaratnavali) of Mukunda dasa (ca. 1650 C.E.) will illustrate this distinctiveness.</p>
<p>The goal for Sahajiyas was to achieve the ultimate state of sahaja, a Sanskrit  and Bengali term that literally means &ldquo;together (saha) born (ja),&rdquo; and by extension  of the semantic domain, &ldquo;innate,&rdquo; &ldquo;easy,&rdquo; &ldquo;spontaneous,&rdquo; or &ldquo;primordial.&rdquo; In the  translations that follow, I use &ldquo;primordium&rdquo; or &ldquo;primordial.&rdquo; Basically, sahaja is  the original state of cosmic unity and bliss; a state that transcends the realm of  samsara (phenomenal reality), in which all created beings exist, subject to pain  and endless rebirth. Sahajiya ritual practices (sadhanas) were developed to guide  both men and women to the realization of this state of liberation. These groups  of Tantric practitioners are generally called &ldquo;Vaisnava&rdquo; Sahajiyas, as their worship  focused on one of Visnu&rsquo;s most important manifestations: the playful and erotic  cowherding god Krsna, the &ldquo;Dark Lord.&rdquo; To Sahajiyas, Krsna was not regarded  simply as a supreme being. Like most tantrikas, the Sahajiyas connected human  and divine natures, so the Dark Lord was reinterpreted as the inner divine aspect  of a man, and Krsna&rsquo;s mythical consort, Radha, was reinterpreted as the inner</p>
<p>THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 30 9</p>
<p>divine aspect of a women. Furthermore, some Sahajiya beliefs and practices, in cluding concepts of religious love and the use of devotional songs, were adapted  from the famous medieval devotional (bhakti) tradition known as Bengali (Gau diya) Vaisnavism, which grew up around the famous Bengali religious leader  Krsna Caitanya (ca. 1486-1533 C.E.). It is largely due to their historical (and  controversial) connections to Bengali Vaisnavas that the label of &ldquo;Vaisnava&rdquo; Sa hajiyas has been used by scholars like Manindramohan Bose, Shashibhushan Das gupta, Edward C. Dimock, and Paritos Dasa. In Sahajiya texts themselves, the</p>
<p>religion is typically referred to as the Primordial Way (sahaja-dharma).  There was much more to the Vaisnava Sahajiyas than their reinterpretations of  Bengali Vaisnavism and the Caitanya movement. Sahajiya gurus adapted a wide  range of beliefs and practices into complex ritual systems and elaborate views of  the universe, and composed hundreds of texts of varying length in Bengali (with  occasional Sanskrit passages), many of which have survived to this day. A few  manuscripts have been edited and published, but most remain unstudied in ar chives in West Bengal and elsewhere. Discernible in these texts are hints of San skrit aesthetics and dramaturgy, classical and medieval Hindu devotionalism,  Samkhya philosophy, Ayurvedic medicine, Siddha Tantra and alchemy, hatha  yoga, and perhaps even Sufi Islam and Tantric Buddhism.</p>
<p>The Vaisnava Sahajiyas are distinctive partly because most of their texts were  composed in the Bengali vernacular; Sanskrit passages, when they do occur, are  typically only quotes from earlier works, mantras, or opening invocations,  whereas most other Hindu Tantric traditions rely extensively on Sanskrit. This  choice of language reflects the regionalism and local flavor of Sahajiya beliefs and  practices. In Bengal, Sanskrit never attained the prominence that it did elsewhere  in India, and although some Sahajiya gurus may have been versed in Sanskrit,  the evidence suggests that they preferred to convey their teachings in Bengali. In  The Necklace (v. 13), Mukunda-dasa goes further, rejecting the Vedas and Vedic  rituals, the ancient foundations of Sanskrit authority and religious life. The most  popular works of Bengali Vaisnavism, especially the Caitanya-caritamrta of Krsna dasa Kaviraja (ca. 1575 C.E.), were composed mainly in Bengali - (although some  important treatises were composed in Sanskrit). In The Necklace (v. 4), Mukunda dasa even claims that Krsnadasa was his own guru, so this choice of the local  vernacular may have been a matter of tradition, also deemed appropriate for the  majority of Bengali devotees.</p>
<p>Before we discuss the more obvious Tantric and yogic dimensions of the Sa hajiyas, we need to emphasize the ways in which Sahajiya gurus adapted Bengali  Vaisnavism - much to the chagrin and outrage of the rather orthodox followers  of Caitanya then (and even now). Orthodox Bengali Vaisnavas developed much  of their belief system from classical Sanskrit devotional texts such as the Bhagavata  Purana and medieval poems like Jayadeva&rsquo;s Gitagovinda. Their basic view is that  Krsna is the supreme god and creator of the cosmos, and that his creative powers  (sakti) extend to the vast reaches of the universe. Human souls (jivas), created by  Krsna, long to return to a loving and blissful relationship with him. Fortunately,</p>
<p>310 GLE N A. HAYES</p>
<p>Krsna wants to experience the love and devotion (bhakti) of the souls, and so he  has used his cosmic powers of magic (maya) and playfulness (lila) to fashion an  eternal heavenly abode (dhaman) that is identical to the idyllic setting of the  Bhagavata Purana: the pastoral village of Vrndavana, in the forested region of  Vraja. These gorgeous heavenly realms are also called Goloka (&ldquo;Cowland&rdquo;) and  Gokula (&ldquo;Cowhouse&rdquo;) Here, Krsna grows up as a handsome youth, enticing the  lovely young milkmaids (gopis) to leave their husbands for furtive lovemaking in  the groves and gardens of Vraja. Many Bengali Vaisnavas quickly allegorize these  figures: the milkmaids represent the human soul, and their desires to frolic with  Krsna in the woods is understood to be the quest of the soul to rejoin the creator.  Since Krsna has thoughtfully reproduced this mystical scene in all of its details  in a blissful heaven, it is possible for devout Vaisnavas to travel there if they take  on the role of one of the characters in that heavenly abode. Much of Bengali  Vaisnavism is dedicated not only to singing and dancing praises to the Dark Lord,  but also to developing an inner spiritual identity as one of the Vraja residents. As  David L. Haberman has shown, this process of &ldquo;acting as a way of salvation&rdquo;  allows one to adopt the identity and &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; of fellow villagers of Krsna,  especially one of the impassioned milkmaids. Those who choose to &ldquo;become&rdquo;  female attendants to Krsna&rsquo;s beloved consort Radha (herself a married woman)  experience the most intense love, as they visualize the divine couple&rsquo;s erotic sports  in the inner heavenly worlds. But for Bengali Vaisnavas, this means that their  souls are returning to an eternal relationship with god. And although in the mythic  drama and in heaven Krsna seems to be involved in adulterous affairs, they are  not really adulterous, since this is really god just playing with his creation. Human  beings, on the other hand, following Hindu caste rules and good family values,  should never be adulterous. Human beings are not divine, only Krsna is; their  souls were made by god, but they themselves can never become god. This dualistic  theological relationship was aptly phrased by the later Bengali poet Ramprasad  Sen when he argued that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to become sugar, I want to taste sugar&rdquo; - with the &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; standing for the divine, and the taster as the human soul.</p>
<p>The Vaisnava Sahajiyas had their own interpretations of the erotic drama of  Krsna, the milkmaids, and Radha. For Tantric Sahajiyas, as noted above, Krsna  is not regarded as a supreme god, a creator who dwells in a distant heaven, and  Radha is not merely his chosen consort or emanation of blissful energy. In contrast  to Ramprasad, Sahajiyas have wished to transform &ldquo;tasting sugar&rdquo; into &ldquo;becoming  sugar.&rdquo; They therefore have adapted the sophisticated theological dualism of Ben</p>
<p>gali Vaisnavas (which is not a pure dualism) into their own monistic system, in  which humans reunite with their inner divine natures. According to Sahajiyas,  every man has within himself his &ldquo;true form&rdquo; (svarupa) as Krsna, the divine mas culine principle, and every woman has within herself her divine feminine prin ciple as Radha. And rather than trying to visualize and then participate in the  lovemaking of a god and his consort in heaven, Sahajiyas call upon all men and  women to make love themselves in order to unify their essences and get to heaven.  In doing so, Sahajiyas are using the physical world and their human bodies as  platforms and tools for their experiments with the sacred. Both of these Sahajiya</p>
<p>THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 31 1</p>
<p>claims - that men and women are really Krsna and Radha, and that adulterous  relationships and ritual sexual intercourse can be salvific - have caused some  scandal or at least discomfort in Bengali Vaisnava communities. Regarded by the  orthodox Vaisnavas as loathsome heretics, and transgressive to the extreme, Sa</p>
<p>hajiya practitioners, who may have seemed on the surface to be regular devotees  of Krsna, have often felt compelled to perform their ritual practices without the  knowledge of their neighbors or risk certain public condemnation. In various  sources from the sixteenth century to the present day, outraged Bengalis and  shocked European colonial administrators have written of what they regarded as  the depraved sexual practices of various Tantric groups, including the Sahajiyas.</p>
<p>Although the influence of Bengali Vaisnavism on the Sahajiyas is clear enough,  the Tantric influences are harder to trace; many Vaisnava Sahajiya texts claim that  their own gurus were noted Bengali Vaisnavas like Krsnadasa Kaviraja, Nitya nanda, and even Caitanya himself. And although one text claims that a legendary  writer on dance and drama, Bharata, was the founding Sahajiya guru, virtually all  Vaisnava Sahajiyas see themselves as intimately connected to Bengali Vaisnavas.  Although Sahajiya texts were clearly influenced by earlier Tantric yogic traditions,  most existing manuscripts seem to have been composed after the time of Caitanya.  How can this be? Part of the problem has to do with the claims of Caitanya and  his followers in Bengal that the renowned leader was himself the &ldquo;incarnation&rdquo;  (avatara) of both Krsna and Radha in one body. The belief is very Tantric in  nature: the idea that both male and female cosmic principles are latent within the  microcosm of the human body. But it is also a plausible reading of Bengali Vais</p>
<p>nava theological views concerning the ultimate relationship between the divine  Krsna and his creative female powers. Much like the Saiva and Sakta tantrikas,  who saw the existence of both the god Siva and the goddess Sakti within the  human body, Sahajiyas utilized the Caitanya model to argue for a similar in</p>
<p>dwelling of both Krsna and Radha. And since the Caitanya movement was growing  in popularity at the time, it was perhaps inevitable that Sahajiya gurus would  adapt what they saw as a congenial tradition - giving it, however, their own  &ldquo;Tantric&rdquo; reinterpretation. By adopting the Caitanya traditions, however, Sahajiyas  also appropriated something that most other Hindu tantrikas did not: the fun</p>
<p>damental roles of human passion (raga), divine love (prema) and devotion (bhakti)  in practice.</p>
<p>In The Necklace, Mukunda-dasa presents the outlines of a basic Sahajiya world view and ritual system, although he does so in a language that is highly technical,  difficult to translate, and challenging to understand. To begin, the words are often  grammatically uninflected, lacking the usual markers for noun case, number, and  verb tense. This means that the relationships between adjectives, nouns, and verbs  are often unclear. I have tried to render the most inclusive reading of each passage,  but many passages could be read in alternative ways. This is fairly typical of  Tantric language in general; due to its grammatical indeterminacy, however, the  form of the Bengali language adapted by the Sahajiyas creates additional hurdles  to scholarly interpretation. In choosing passages for this volume, I have tried to  use material that presented a basic picture of Sahajiya beliefs and practices. For</p>
<p>3 1 2 GLEN A. HAYES</p>
<p>translations and studies of other Vaisnava Sahajiya texts, readers may consult the  recommendations for further reading.</p>
<p>Of the complete text of The Necklace of Immortality, only four verses are in  Sanskrit: the opening invocation and three quotations from earlier Vaisnava  works. Following these invocations (w. 1-5) to Krsna, Caitanya, famous Bengali  Vaisnavas, and his own guru Krsnadasa Kaviraja, Mukunda-dasa sketches out  some of the basic beliefs and practices of his system. In simplest terms, the process  of realizing sahaja requires the yogic mastery of one&rsquo;s emotions, mental states,  physical body, and sexual energies in order to create a type of subtle inner yogic  body or &ldquo;divine body&rdquo; (rupa, deva-deha) - that provides a vehicle for the soul  (jiva) to travel to the blissful realms of sahaja. The basic system revolves around  the complex and important term rasa, which literally means &ldquo;juice,&rdquo; as from fruit  or sugarcane, but which has several levels of meaning for Sahajiyas. Although rasa  is a term already found in Sanskrit aesthetics and Bengali Vaisnavism, it can also  be used to describe an elevated state of religious rapture, in which one experiences  the purified emotion of love for the divine. Drawing on more obscure Tantric and  alchemical influences, Mukunda-dasa plays with the additional significant mean ing of rasa as &ldquo;male semen&rdquo; and &ldquo;mercury,&rdquo; and it is this meaning - of an essential  fluid - that predominates in the text. I have translated it as &ldquo;Divine Essence,&rdquo; but  the multiple referents should be kept in mind. By performing ritual sexual inter course (sambhoga) with a female partner (rati), the male Sahajiya is understood  to yogically &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; his rasa-semen and propel it, along with the sexual fluids  of his partner, along his urethra into a mystical yogic channel, the Crooked River  (bankanadi), that flows upward and inward into the inner body and worlds. Only  by sexual ritual can the vital fluids of men and women be transformed into vastu,  a technical term meaning &ldquo;truth, essence, thing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;object,&rdquo; but which I translate  as &ldquo;Cosmic Substance,&rdquo; the most fundamental constituent unit of the universe. It  is this Cosmic Substance, created only through Sahajiya rituals, which forms the  subtle inner body, in much the same way as the physical body is made of flesh  and blood. As indicated in verses 7-12, this realization of rasa as Divine Essence,  and its transformation into the Cosmic Substance of the Inner Body (rupa) is  needed to reach the ultimate state of sahaja. One can only learn about this from  those who have already experienced rasa, advanced practitioners called rasikas,  which I translate as &ldquo;Experienced Ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This powerful and liberating process of ritual sexual intercourse is controver sial; it is a tool that is not universal and a modality of religious ritual that takes  years to cultivate. As with all tantrikas, one must first receive initiation and a  mantra from a guru (w. 14-15). Additional and subsequent instructions are  received from a second person, the siksa (&ldquo;teaching&rdquo;) guru, who according to  another Sahajiya guru, Akificana-dasa, should be a woman. There are three stages  of Sahajiya practice (v. 18): beginner (pravarta), accomplished (sadhaka), and  perfected (siddha). Beginners should start their practices using the standard ritual  devotions (vaidhi-bhakti) of Bengali Vaisnavas (w. 20-23), including singing  hymns, chanting, dancing to Krsna, and developing an alternative spiritual bodyTHE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 313</p>
<p>and identity as one of Krsna&rsquo;s followers. At this level, Sahajiya practices resemble  those of orthodox Vaisnavism. Such devotional actions result in the experience  of a mystic emotional state called a bhava (&ldquo;mood, condition&rdquo;), which I have  translated as &ldquo;Divine Existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After using these techniques from Bengali Vaisnavas, clearly discussed by Ed ward C. Dimock, Jr., and David L. Haberman, the more obviously Tantric di mensions of Sahajiya practice begin. During the second and third stages of prac tice, the rituals involving coitus and erotic activities are gradually introduced - after all, the Sahajiya couple are acting out the divine loveplay of Krsna and Radha.</p>
<p>Like rasa, the term rati, which I translate as &ldquo;Female Partner,&rdquo; also comes from  Sanskrit and Vaisnava traditions and has a distinctive Sahajiya meaning, as well.  It does mean an actual female ritual partner, and in Vaisnavism generally refers  to a woman loved by Krsna. However, consistent with the fluid-based cosmology  of Sahajiyas and other tantrikas, it can also mean female sexual fluids, which are  &ldquo;reversed&rdquo; along with male semen in order to create the inner body. The Female  Partner must also be visualized (w. 33-39) as having an &ldquo;Inner Damsel Body&rdquo;  (rupa-marijan), which is an elegant blend of Caitanyaite and Tantric visualization  techniques. As adapted from the erotic adventures of Krsna, the ideal female  partner should not be one&rsquo;s own (svakiya) spouse, but rather one &ldquo;belonging to  another&rdquo; (parakiya). Such a dangerous liaison, risky in itself, only serves to  heighten the passions of forbidden love, as the relationship could end if known  to others. Underlying this process, however, is the need to transform worldly  passions (raga) and lust (kama) into pure divine love (prema). These basic posi tions are complicated by amplifying the roles of emotions and by including vari ous erotic games (vilasa) as part of the sexual ritual. These features help to dis</p>
<p>tinguish the Sahajiyas from most other practitioners of Tantra.</p>
<p>The Sahajiya model of the inner or subtle body is also quite different from most  Saiva and Sakta Tantric systems. In addition to incorporating ideas from the  mythology of Krsna with its beautiful gardens, forests, and villages, the basic  structure of the subtle body in The Necklace consists of the Crooked River and  four inner lotus ponds (sarovaras) - rather than the more typical six or seven  cakras, susumna-nadi, and fiery kundalini-sakti of other Tantric traditions. This  emphasis on rivers and ponds clearly reflects the watery deltaic geography and  topography of Bengal, and it also expresses the Sahajiya emphasis upon physi cality, substances, and fluids. In contrast to other South Asian traditions, such as  the philosophy of Vedanta, which regarded the natural world and the human  body as illusory obstacles to liberation, the Sahajiyas saw the world and body as  very &ldquo;real&rdquo; and useful for salvation - a basic Tantric understanding. This allowed  them to transform the human body, its parts, and processes, using them to give  &ldquo;birth&rdquo; to the inner subtle body, thereby reaching the blissful realms of the pri</p>
<p>mordial state of sahaja.</p>
<p>There are several realms and states of consciousness associated with sahaja, all  of which are said to be places of bliss (ananda). The Necklace has often vivid  descriptions of such places (w. 43, 45-47, 54-57, 96-99), visualizing them as</p>
<p>314 GLEN A. HAYES</p>
<p>particular villages and gardens alongside a mystical river. The Crooked River is  of great importance, since it connects the four inner ponds. For the Sahajiyas,  this subtle physiology functions in much the same way as the cakras and susumna nadi of other Tantric systems; but the river and ponds convey the reversed sexual  fluids, not the fiery kundalini. These four ponds (VV. 97-98) may be thought of  as a set of holding tanks within the male body, and each one represents a different  level of purity, consciousness, and bliss. The lowest, the Pond of Lust (kama sarovara), is said (v. 96) to be reached through the &ldquo;ninth door&rdquo; of the human  body, probably a reference to the urethra, where the Crooked River begins. Next  is the Pond of Arrogance (mana-sarovara), where lingering feelings of egotism and  selfish desire must be purified - again, through continuation of the sexual and  other rituals. The third reservoir is the Pond of Divine Love (prema-sarovara),  where the pure and selfless affection between the two partners is developed.  Reflecting influences from Tantric alchemy, each of the ponds also serves as a  type of alchemical vessel, into which the base sexual fluids are drawn through  sexual intercourse. It is out of these yogically transformed sexual fluids that the  immortal elixir of Cosmic Substance is fashioned. The uppermost vessel is the  Pond of Immortality (aksaya-sarovara), which has such features as a thousand petaled lotus and is the abode of the cosmic mountain Sumeru (similar to the  highest cakra in other Saiva and Sakta systems). The fourth pond is thus closest  to sahaja, the realms of bliss, and the realization of the androgynous state of the  Primordial Inner Being (sahaja-manusa) - the complete union of male/female and  Krsna/Radha.</p>
<p>Many details of these yogic processes and visualized realms are difficult for us  to understand, as the text was composed with the intent of concealing such cosmic  secrets and powers from outsiders. Some verses seem impossible to understand  at all. But we can still glimpse some salient aspects of practice. For example, it  seems that the word rasa itself is used as a mantra during sexual intercourse (VV.  55-56), and uttering ra-sa helps the practitioners to reach sahaja. But difficulties  and dangers lurk along the way: if one can bypass the pitfalls of passion and lust,  described as the flower arrows of the love god or as a deadly serpent (VV. 104- 7), then one may discover the myriad yogic channels of the inner body (v. 110)  and use coitus and eroticism to escape ordinary worldly decay (v. 115), that is,  to overcome mortality, the goal of many yogic sadhanas.</p>
<p>Each of the four ponds is described in varying detail in the complete text, with  multicolored and multipetaled lotuses, bathing and entry steps, surrounding vil lages, and mystical qualities. Each is beautiful and adorned with precious gems  (VV. 162-63), a typical Tantric reference not only to their great value but also to  the fact that each pond is fashioned out of Cosmic Substance - a commodity that  is most difficult to obtain. Some of this imagery is derived from Bengali Vaisnava  visualization techniques involving the ponds and other locations where Radha  and Krsna met for their secret loveplay. But the Sahajiya depictions of the ponds  are also based upon the gurus&rsquo; experiences of these ponds as important realms of  the subtle body. As such, the ponds are vital reservoirs for the yogically manip-</p>
<p>THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 315</p>
<p>ulated sexual fluids, and reflect a standard Tantric motif of the reversal (ulta) of  the cosmic process. For the Sahajiyas, this process requires a journey along the  Crooked River as it flows &ldquo;upward against the current&rdquo; (v. 180) to sahaja. Found  in these inner realms are a variety of different beings and special places, such as  the Self-perfected Inner Being (svatah-siddha-mdnusa), the Primordial Inner Being  (sahaja-manusa), the Place of the Hidden Moon (guptacandrapur), and the Pri</p>
<p>mordial Citadel (sahajapur). Attaining these places also entails mastery of breath  control, which leads to mystical visions of different colors and objects (VV. 184- 90). Like other tantrikas, Sahajiyas must visualize inner forms of the Female  Partner, known as the eight Heroines (nayikas), enthroned in the delicate lotuses  of the ponds (VV. 242-44). Although few details of the Heroines or the Female  Partner are given (in one passage she is described as a lovely sixteen-year-old  maiden), the process of coitus is likened to the &ldquo;churning&rdquo; (mathana) of the part</p>
<p>ner (VV. 256-58). Although this image possibly refers to the vigorous mixing of  the sexual fluids, it also recalls the mythical effort of the gods to extract nectar  from the cosmic ocean, the making of butter, and the preparation of alchemical  elixirs.</p>
<p>The concluding passages of the text emphasize the centrality of the Female  Partner in the attainment of sahaja (VV. 309-10), review basic dimensions of the  cosmos (VV. 311, 317-19), and extol the importance of The Necklace itself (VV.  329-30); the text ends with &ldquo;Blessed Mukunda-dasa presents The Necklace of  Immortality.&rdquo; Some scholars, such as Paritos Dasa, have argued that this text and  several others were originally composed in Sanskrit by one Siddha Mukunda deva, and that various disciples such as Mukunda-dasa prepared the Bengali trans</p>
<p>lations that have come down to us. Until more evidence is found, this argument  must remain unproven, leaving us further mystified by the Vaisnava Sahajiyas of  medieval Bengal.</p>
<p>So what do we learn from a text like The Necklace of Immortality? To begin, it  suggests that human beings have experienced their bodies and sexuality in many  different ways, and that some have used these experiences as the basis for ex pressing vivid, sensual, religious worlds. The Sahajiyas used all of their sense  capacities - sight, sound, taste, touch, and scent - to bring together the spiritual  and the material. But this is true of many other Tantric traditions. The Vaisnava  Sahajiyas are distinctive in the ways in which they combined the physicality of  the body, sexual energies, emotions, passions, and senses in order to express their  elaborate models of reality. In simplest terms, gurus like Mukunda-dasa attempted  to blend the best of the complex worlds of Tantric yoga and bhakti devotionalism,  offering both men and women a powerful means of liberation from the apparent  limitations of the ordinary world and their bodies. Such a bold use of sexuality  definitely has the power to offend. Yet such a dangerous rejection of social norms,  found throughout Tantra, is deemed necessary for salvation.</p>
<p>Beyond the controversies surrounding sexual practices, the text also raises pro found questions about perceptions of gender and power. Most Sahajiya texts seem  to have been written by men, from a male perspective, and privilege the male</p>
<p>3 1 6 GLEN A. HAYES</p>
<p>body by locating the ponds within the man (v. 169). If anything, ritual coitus is a  form of what some scholars have called &ldquo;inverse intercourse,&rdquo; in which the man  takes the fluids from the woman and draws them into his body. The subtle body  is &ldquo;born&rdquo; within the male body, unlike the physical body, which is born in a  womb. It should be pointed out that although these are clearly male-centered fea</p>
<p>tures, they are not therefore anti-female, since the Sahajiya system is dependent  upon the harmonious interaction of both male and female cosmic principles.  Without the Female Partner and her fluids, the male can never reach sahaja; with out the man and his essences, she is also denied final liberation. In the end, both  must experience the ultimate state of sahaja, or it does not happen. Sahaja itself is  transcendent, beyond the duality of male and female, but unobtainable without  their interaction. The Vivarta-vilasa (&ldquo;Erotic Games of Transformation&rdquo;) by Akift cana-dasa (ca. 1700 C.E.) states that the siksa or teaching guru, who provides in struction on the advanced ritual practices, is identified with Radha and should  thus be a woman. This reflects the Sahajiya view that all woman are teachers, and  that men must learn from them. And though much of Bengali society at the time  was dominated by men, Bengal was still the center of the worship of such great  goddesses as Durga, Kali, and Sakti. We see this regional emphasis on the divine  feminine reflected in Sahajiya texts like The Necklace, as well: in the importance  given to the Female Partner and the Damsel, to Radha and the milkmaids, the vi sualized Heroines, and the female gurus. Much about the medieval Vaisnava Sa hajiyas will remain a mystery to outsiders, as gurus like Mukunda-dasa seem re luctant to loosen their grasp on the jewels in The Necklace of Immortality.</p>
<p>The Necklace of Immortality exists in two manuscript editions found in the archives  of the University of Calcutta, and a printed version edited by the Bengali scholar  Paritos Dasa. The manuscript version used for these translations is Bengali ms.  no. 6451 in the collection of the University of Calcutta. Another version exists as  ms. no. 595 in the same collection. I would like to thank the University of Cal</p>

<li>
<p>You must master these different ritual devotions as a beginner.  The initial awareness of Divine Existence will continue for so long as  no Female Partner (rati) is actually present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sixty-four types of ritual devotion for the physical body  are intended for the beginner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Devotions that are influenced by worldly karma should be avoided by  the Adept.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>One joins the spiritual lineage of the guru at the precise moment  one receives a mantra.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this initiation, however, you must continue your practices  under</p>
<p>the guidance of a teaching guru.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Through such sustained practices, the adept will develop the finest  physical body.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even older men and women can benefit from the consciousness  of Divine Existence.</p>
<p>TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE BODY</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>
<p>A Divine Body (devadeha) must be born within the physical body.  So how may men and women come to know that they possess a  Divine Body?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With effort, you will discover the Divine Body within the physical  body.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>One may produce the Cosmic Substance of the Divine Body  by following the teachings.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>By performing ritual practices with a woman, the Divine Body will be  discovered within the physical, body.</li>
</ol>
<p>A woman who has realized her divine inner nature should serve as  the passionate Female Partner.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>When both the male and female principles are brought together  within the physical body,</li>
</ol>
<p>then one is ready to perform the advanced practices</p>
<p>leading to consciousness of Divine Essence and Divine Love.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Without following these steps, you will never acquire the Cosmic  Substance.</li>
</ol>
<p>How then will you know about the transcendent Cosmic Substance?</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>
<p>That transcendent Cosmic Substance seems to be very remote.  The person who is able to obtain it is a hero in the ways of passion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The form of that blessed Inner Body must be without impurity, as  must the Female Partner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One can&rsquo;t reach the Vraja heaven without traveling the way of  passion.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>The blessed Inner Damsel Body (srirupamanjari) leads the adept to  the Vraja heaven.</li>
</ol>
<p>With her body of eternity, she helps the adept to master the passions.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Without her, you&rsquo;ll never taste the passion-filled Cosmic Substances  of the Vraja heaven.</li>
</ol>
<p>For adepts seeking Vraja, she is the very essence of the way of  passion.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>The Female Partner who is imbued with Divine Love shimmers with  erotic energies, and is herself a well of Divine Essence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having a splendid body like Radha, she is the well of both Divine  Essence and Cosmic Substance.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>The Female Partner who is imbued with Divine Love is the vessel  of shimmering Divine Essence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Inner Body was born in that ocean of Divine Essence.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>
<p>In the Vraja heaven, the adept acquires an eternal Inner Body.  That is why it is called the blessed Inner Damsel Body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through Divine Essence, the Inner Body is born, becoming a vessel of  Divine Love.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And through that inner body one becomes conscious of the true  nature of passion.</p>
<p>THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 32 1</p>
<p>COSMIC REALMS OF BLISS</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>Along the far shores of the Viraja River is a place called the  Homeland.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a village there called the Primordial Place, a realm of eternal  bliss.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>In that region there is a Tree of Emptiness, and lotuses  of one hundred and one thousand petals.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Homeland spreads out around that tree and the waters of a pond.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>To its north is a village called the Place of Bliss.</li>
</ol>
<p>The abode of the god of love, it has a lovely grove</p>
<p>where the Experienced Ones taste Divine Essence.</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>
<p>Forever blissful, forever overwhelmed, forever desirous,  The Primordial Being (sahajamanusa) makes its home there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that realm there is a lake called Moon Pond.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is located near the left side of the inner ocean.</p>
<ol start="55">
<li>The Pond of Lust (kama-sarovara) is to be generated out of that  Moon Lake.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through uttering the syllable sa [of the mantra ra-sa: Divine Essence]  a vast empty space is revealed within the human body.</p>
<ol start="56">
<li>In the making of the other syllable, ra, the Female Partner  becomes the secret vessel of semen.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Place of the Hidden Moon, the male and female principles  are joined together.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>That Place of the Hidden Moon is apprehended</li>
</ol>
<p>by joining the two principles together.</p>
<p>Behold how all the regions of the vast cosmos emerge in that special  place.</p>
<ol start="96">
<li>The Pond of Lust is reached through the ninth door of the human  body.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a subject that has been revealed by all the holy books.</p>
<ol start="97">
<li>
<p>There are four ponds within the body: the Pond of Lust, the Pond of  Arrogance, the Pond of Divine Love, and the Pond of Immortality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four ponds exist within the human heart.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Only if you have a physical body can you reach the other shores of  reality.</p>
<ol start="99">
<li>The Pond of Lust is the most sought-after thing of all.  Without fail, you must be diligent in your ritual practices.</li>

<p>RITUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND EROTICISM</p>
<ol start="104">
<li>
<p>The five flower-arrows of the god of love are the enchanters of Krsna.  But a deadly serpent of death and time lurks within the human body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That deadly serpent can strike day or night.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even a mind in total control of the body cannot prevent the serpent  from striking.</p>
<ol start="106">
<li>But, a mind in control of the physical self is really the cause of  Phenomenal Reality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a soul is of the lowest kind, unable to prevent lust.</p>
<ol start="107">
<li>
<p>That is why such conditions hinder the worship of Krsna.  The soul&rsquo;s thirst for a Female Partner can drive one mad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When engaged in these kinds of practices, you must be very, very  careful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should visualize an inner mental form of the Female Partner.</p>
<ol start="109">
<li>Performance of religious rituals with a devout woman belongs to the  second stage of the practitioner.</li>
</ol>
<p>The god of erotic love helps to transform the Female Partner  into her inner visualized form.</p>
<ol start="110">
<li>Within the physical body there are nine major yogic channels  and 320 million finer channels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Who is the person who knows which one goes where?</p>
<ol start="115">
<li>The ultimate ritual is ritual sexual intercourse and eroticism with a  Female Partner.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you perform such practices with a Female Partner,</p>
<p>you will escape worldly decay.</p>
<p>INNER WORLDS AND A CROOKED RIVER</p>
<ol start="154">
<li>This path of practices is difficult to travel; it seems to be near, but  then remote.</li>
</ol>
<p>From a distance it seems close, from close up it seems distant.</p>
<ol start="155">
<li>
<p>You must be able to come to know the principles of your own body.  Whoever does not learn about the body suffers the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ponds and all of Phenomenal Reality exist within the body.  Who can truly worship without knowing the principles of the body?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without the instruction of the guru, you cannot know the guru&rsquo;s  principles.HE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 32 3</p>

<p>Distracted day and night by so many things, just eating and  defecating.</p>
<ol start="162">
<li>
<p>Those ponds should be visualized as having a pleasing shape.  I will tell you about them, please listen carefully!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those ponds are adorned with precious jewels.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those eternal abodes are encrusted with gems.</p>
<ol start="168">
<li>You must perform your practices with the physical body of your  Female Partner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through such practices, you will attain your own Cosmic Substance.</p>
<ol start="169">
<li>The ponds are within the man, but the woman becomes conscious of  them.</li>
</ol>
<p>A Female Partner suitable for such practices should be</p>
<p>a desirable and joyful woman.</p>
<ol start="170">
<li>During sexual intercourse, the ponds and lotuses shimmer with  erotic energies.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pond of Divine Love, where Divine Love blossoms, is eternal.</p>
<ol start="179">
<li>The Village of Eternal Bliss is located along the far shores of the  Crooked River.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Crooked River flows in a northerly direction.</p>
<ol start="180">
<li>Its undulations are pleasing and well formed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Its waters flow upward against the current.</p>
<ol start="181">
<li>
<p>To its west is the village called the Primordial Place.  That eternal abode is the place of the Self-Perfected Inner Being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The community of Experienced Ones dwells in the Place of Eternal  Bliss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Experienced Ones are youthful; the Experienced Ones are  numerous.</p>
<ol start="183">
<li>The people of the Primordial Place perform the rituals of the  Primordium.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Primordial Being is the vessel of all Divine Essence.</p>
<p>MYSTICAL LIGHTS AND BREATH CONTROL</p>
<ol start="184">
<li>
<p>Following the sunrise, nothing remains in that Land.  Please hear, all Experienced Ones, about the truths of that place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please hear, all devotees, the story of the Land of Eternal Bliss.  In that place, neither the moon nor the sun rise; the wind moves not  at all.</p>

<li>There is blue light, white light, and yellow light.</li>
</ol>
<p>The three lights glow like the rising sun.</p>
<ol start="187">
<li>The vessel of nectar is carried along by the rippled waters of the  Crooked River.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nostrils force air into that vessel of nectar.</p>
<ol start="188">
<li>
<p>The nose quickly exhales the air that has been inhaled.  The rising sun doesn&rsquo;t glow, yet there are different kinds of light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rising sun is absorbed by the brilliance of the lights.  These matters have been covered by other books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as the breath is quickly exhaled through the nose,  so too I narrate this book, The Necklace of Immortality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>HEROINES OF DIVINE LOVE</p>
<ol start="242">
<li>
<p>The eight Heroines appear in the eight petals of a lotus.  They float in blue lotuses, yellow lotuses, and white lotuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus the Heroines are visualized in the eight petals.  The eight Heroines who appear in the eight lotus petals are  the Inner Bodies of the Female Partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If by this you are able to understand the principles concerning  the realization of the body,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>then, with great devotion, you will know the nine major yogic  channels and the 320 million finer channels within the body.</p>
<ol start="256">
<li>Divine Love came into being through the churning of the Female  Partner during intercourse.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus there comes into being a place</p>
<p>called the Pond of Divine Love (prema-sarovara).</p>
<ol start="257">
<li>
<p>Krsna&rsquo;s home is in that pond, which contains drops of Divine Love.  A Female Partner who embodies Divine Essence is a woman suitable  for Krsna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continually churning the Female Partner produces the essence  of the Female Partner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Deeply entranced day and night, a state of wonder develops.</p>
<p>THE FEMALE PARTNER AND THE COSMIC REGIONS</p>
<ol start="309">
<li>The Female Partner and Divine Essence will lead you to the heavens  of Goloka and Vrndavana.</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding these principles, you will master your own lusts.</p>
<p>THE NECKLACE OF IMMORTALITY 325</p>
<ol start="310">
<li>
<p>You should carefully realize the Female Partner in the Pond of Lust.  Through such practices with a Female Partner, you will attain  the Primordial Cosmic Substance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Land of the Hidden Moon is the essence of everything.  There is no Cosmic Substance beyond this Cosmic Substance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are seven heavens, seven hells, and eight protectors of the  directions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are the nine major yogic channels, 320 million finer channels,  the cosmic mountain Sumeru, and the jungle.</p>
<ol start="318">
<li>
<p>The Crooked River spirals around them in the four directions,  as the eight Heroines wrap themselves around the trees like creeping  vines.</p>

<li>
<p>There is a village called the Place of Eternal Bliss.</p>

</ol>
<p>You must certainly make your home in that land.</p>

<p>This is not paradoxical for the followers of the blessed Inner Body.</p>
<ol start="329">
<li>That Inner Body is made of eternal Cosmic Substance and is  the essence of practice.</li>

<p>This book, The Necklace of Immortality, is the vessel of Divine  Essence.</p>
