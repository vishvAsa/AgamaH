title = "04 A Parody of the Kapalikas in the Mattavilasa"

+++

David N. Lorenzen  

The Mattavilasa is a one-act comic farce written in Sanskrit and Prakrit and at tributed to a Pallava ruler of south India named Mahendra-varman, who ruled  from his capital at Kanchi from about 600 to 630 C.E. The principal character in  the play is a drunken Kapalika adept named Satyasoma.  

The Kapalikas or Kapalins are one of the earliest mentioned sectarian groups  of Tantric adepts. Unfortunately no texts survive that can unambiguously be as signed to Kapalika authors. We have, instead, many texts written by their op ponents who criticize or parody Kapalika beliefs and practices, and a few inscrip tions that record donations to or from Kapalika adepts.  

The Mattavilasa is one of the oldest works that features a Kapalika adept. As  such, it has undoubtedly influenced many later portraits. One cannot, however,  assume that the Kapalikas found in Sanskrit literature are simply fictional stereo types. The inscriptions prove that the Kapalikas really did exist, and many ele ments of their literary portraits correspond to what we know about Tantric reli gion from other sources. Reading between the lines of parodies such as the  Mattavilasa, then, we can arrive at a plausible picture of the nature of Kapalika  beliefs and practices.  

A central feature of Kapalika practice was their Great Vow or Mahavrata. To  fulfill this vow, the male adept would obtain his livelihood by begging for alms  with a skull bowl. Since the Sanskrit word for skull is kapala, this made him a  Kapalika or Kapalin, while the performance of the Mahavrata made him a Ma 

havratin. The rationale for this Great Vow is found in a myth about the gods Siva  and Brahma. Although the details vary in different versions, the key episode is a  quarrel between the two gods about who is the most powerful. Siva, in his anger,  cuts off the fifth head of Brahma. Since Brahma is the archetypal representative  of the social class of the brahmans, this means that Siva has committed the major  crime of killing a brahman (brahma-hatya). To atone for this crime, Siva has to  wander about as a Kapalin for twelve years, using Brahma's skull as his begging  bowl. 

82 DAVID N. LORENZEN  

In the Mattavilasa, the action centers around the Kapalika's attempts to find  his lost skull bowl. When he falsely accuses a Buddhist monk of having stolen it,  the monk displays his own bowl, which has a quite different shape and color.  The Kapalika's female companion, Devasoma, laments that their skull - which  was once "endowed with all the auspicious marks and was as holy as the skull of  Brahma" - has become black and ugly. The Kapalika consoles her with the  thought that his penance, like that of Siva, can make it pure again: "Our master  Siva, who wears the crescent moon, was freed of the sin that arose when he cut  off the head of Brahma through undertaking this Great Vow."  

We have no information about how the human Kapalikas obtained their skulls,  but it is most likely that they found them in cremation grounds. In a few sources,  however, Kapalikas are said to engage in human sacrifice. This seems unlikely,  but the Kapalikas' association with cremation grounds and other inauspicious  places is in keeping with the ritual practices of more extreme Tantric ascetics.  The basic aim of wandering about in such places was to overcome the duality of  pure and impure, and the fear of death, by constant contact with impure places  and things such as cremation grounds and corpses. This constant association with  impurity would also force the adepts to learn to endure the scorn and disgust of  persons who were still tied to the rules of proper social behavior.  

Other social rules that the Kapalikas and other Tantric adepts purposely trans gressed concern sex and food. In literary works such as the Mattavilasa, the Ka palikas are often described as hedonists addicted to sexual play with beautiful  female companions and to drinking liquor and eating meat. In the Mattavilasa,  the Kapalika Satyasoma's lovely companion Devasoma is presumed to be his sex ual partner and also attracts the lustful glances of the Buddhist monk and the  Pasupata ascetic. Together Satyasoma and Devasoma also enjoy the meat kabobs  that they receive as alms in the skull bowl and the liquor that they drink from  the same vessel.  

From what we know about Tantric religion, it is unlikely the Kapalikas were  simple hedonists. Some Tantric adepts did engage in extramarital sexual inter course and the consumption of foods prohibited to upper-caste Hindus, such as  meat and liquor. Such behavior was, however, displayed in the context of a con trolled ritual, not as simple hedonistic enjoyment. In the best-known ritual, the  adept took the five prohibited things whose names begin with the letter M: liquor,  meat, fish, parched grain, and sexual intercourse (madya, mamsa, matsya, mudra,  maithuna). The female partner in the act of sexual intercourse is usually described  as a low-caste woman who is not the male adept's own wife. The basic aim of all  this, as in the case of the association with cremation grounds and corpses, was  to rise above the duality of the pure and the impure through the transgression of  the rules of proper social conduct.  

One other aspect of the ritual act of sexual intercourse is often suggested in  Tantric sources. The ritual is regarded as a reenactment of the sexual intercourse  between Siva and his wife, the goddess called Parvati or Uma. The bliss of this  union is compared to the bliss of liberation or moksa, and the Tantric adepts  were expected to recreate this divine bliss in their own acts of ritual intercourse. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 8 3  

The theological system of the Kapalikas is often called Soma-siddhanta, the  doctrine of Soma. Several commentaries on another Sanskrit drama with a Ka palika character gloss the Soma of Soma-siddhanta as implying "Siva united with  Uma" (sa-Uma = soma). In fact, we have no way of knowing the nature of the  doctrines of Soma-siddhanta, but the name appears both in literary texts and in  inscriptions. In many sources, Soma-siddhantin, like Mahavratin, is another title  given to the Kapalikas. In the Mattavilasa, the word soma appears in the names  of both Satyasoma and Devasoma. It is also barely possible that the name also  suggests some sort of connection with the ancient Brahmanical worship of the  intoxicating sacred drink called soma.  

The physical appearance of Kapalika adepts is only hinted at in the Mattavilasa,  but other sources give more detailed descriptions. One of the most interesting is  from an inscription from Andhra Pradesh dated about 1050 C.E. It records a  donation by a Brahman (vipra) named Somi-bhattaraka who was the abbot of a  local SaiikareSvara (Siva) temple. The inscription calls him an expert in Soma 

siddhanta and a Mahavratin. He is described as "sprinkled with ashes; adorned  with the six insignia; and holding a khatvahga club, a skull (kapala), damaru and  mrdahga drums, and a trumpet." The six insignia are not listed, but the south  Indian Vaisnava theologians Yamunacarya and Ramanuja identify the six insignia  of the Kapalikas as two different kinds of earrings, a necklace, a jeweled crest,  ashes, and the sacred thread. They add the skull and khatvahga as secondary  insignia. The khatvanga consists of a pole about fifty to seventy-five centimeters  (twenty to thirty inches) in length, on which a complete skull is impaled.  

It is impossible to know how the Kapalikas were organized as a religious group,  but their association with a specific vow, a specific doctrine, and a special dress  code suggests some definite institutional tradition. By the thirteenth or fourteenth  centuries, however, whatever organization they once may have had apparently  had already disappeared. The Kapalikas survived mainly in the literary and reli 

gious texts of their opponents as stereotypical villains, buffoons, or heretics.  

The translation given below follows the text, Mattavilasaprahasana, edited by T.  Ganapati Sastri (Trivandrum: Government Press, 1917). More recent editions are  available, but all seem to be based on this one. Here and there, I have added a  short phrase or extra stage direction to explain things that might not be imme 

diately obvious to readers. The translations of the numbered verses use English  rhymes and/or meters to mark them off from the prose text. In the original, the  women, the Buddhist, and the madman all speak in different varieties of Prakrit  rather than in Sanskrit.  

One additional point concerns two somewhat confusing references to the Ka palika that appear in the text shortly after verse 20. He is called first a Great  Brahman (mahabrahmana) and then a Great Pasupata (mahapasupata). At least one  translator has assumed that these terms should refer to the Pasupata and not to  the Kapalika. In fact, the term Great Brahman is commonly used to refer to the  untouchables who help officiate during the highly polluting rite of cremation. The  term Great Pasupata is evidently a similar ironic title. 

84 DAVID N. LORENZEN  

Another point easily missed is the confusion of myths and legends in the mad man's speech just before verse 19. Such mixed allusions will be lost on most  modern readers, but they must have amused the cultured audience of Mahendra varman's court.

After the verse of blessing, the Director enters.  

Director:  

The god who carries a skull, the divine Kapalin,  

Whose languages, costumes, forms, and actions are many,  

Whose dance reveals beauty through intense emotion,  

Whose power moves the cosmos, of infinite wisdom,  

Who is also the silent spectator watching the show,  

May he grant you fame that fills the entire earth. (1)  

Ah, at last I have found a suitable way to please my older wife, who has been  out of sorts ever since I appointed myself a younger wife. Today the royal  assembly finally appointed us to put on a public show. I must go tell her the  news, [looking behind the scenes]. My dear, please come here.  

Actress: [entering, angrily] Have you at last come to play the drunken games  of adolescents?  

Director: It is as you say.  

Actress: Then you should go play with her to whom you wish to make love. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 85  

Director: I want to perform it with you.  

Actress: Were you told to do this?  

Director: Yes, I was. What's more, if you join us you will be well paid.  Actress: You must be really pleased about this.  

Director: My dear, aren't you pleased as well? If the assembly is satisfied by  your performance, it will reward you generously.  

Actress: [happily] Have I really won the honorable gentlemen's favor?  Director: I'm sure you've won it.  

Actress: In that case, what favor can I offer to you?  

Director: What's all this talk about favors?  

My sweet love, your bright smile,  

Curving eyebrow, and downy cheek,  

Once I've seen your perfect face  

What more is there for me to seek? (2)  

Actress: What play are you about to present?  

Director: The one you just mentioned, the farce called "Drunken Games."  Actress: It seems that my anger has spoken for me in this matter. Sir, who is  the poet who has composed this work?  

Director: Listen, my dear. In the lands ruled by the Pallava family there was  the mighty scion Simhavisnu-varman. Using many different tactics, he won  a wide circle of vassals. In courage, he was the equal of Indra. In generosity,  he outdid even the god of wealth. The author is his son, King Mahendra 

vikrama-varman, a man who has conquered all personal vices and is dedi cated to providing for the welfare of others.  

Now, when the Kali Age is here,  

And lofty virtues disappear,  

Wisdom, compassion, and honesty,  

Art, generosity, truth, and beauty,  

Dignity, firmness, and modesty,  

Seek refuge with this virtuous king.  

As, when the universe began,  

The countless fragments of creation  

Sought refuge with the Primal Man. (3)  

His eloquence is a mine  

Of priceless gems, a presence  

That brings praise to songs  

Of good but lesser talents. (4)  

Actress: What are we waiting for? Let the premier performance be begun.  Director:  

By adding to this illustrous poet's fame,  

My own humble songs have been put to shame.86 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  [From behind the scenes.] My love, Devasoma!  

Director:  

And so, the Kapalika, with lovely wench and skull,  

Finds shame under the spell of alcohol. (5)  

[The two exit. The Kapalika then enters with his female companion.]  

Kapalika: [acting drunk] Devasoma, my love, it's true. The power of changing  form at will is won by means of penance. The proper performance of the  Great Vow has made you irresistibly beautiful:  

Your soft laughter and gentle sighs,  

Your falling garlands and flowing hair,  

Your playful smiles and dancing eyes,  

Your moist cheeks and lazy stare. (6)  

Devasoma: My lord, you seem to be saying that it's 1 who am drunk.  Kapalika: What did you say?  

Devasoma: I'm not saying anything.  

Kapalika: Is it possible that I'm drunk?  

Devasoma: My lord, the earth is spinning all around. I think I'm falling. Please  hold me up.  

Kapalika: I've got you, my love, [trying to support her and jailing] Somadeva,  my love, are you angry at me? Every time I try to hold you up, you move  away.  

Devasoma: Hah! It must be this Somadeva who gets angry and moves away,  even when you bow and scrape before her.  

Kapalika: Aren't you Somadeva? [thinking] No, you're Devasoma.  Devasoma: If you love this Somadeva so much, you shouldn't call her by my  name.  

Kapalika: My dear, this was just a simple slip of the tongue. I'm drunk. No  offense to you was intended.  

Devasoma: How convenient that it's not you who's to blame.  Kapalika: How can I let vile drink get control over me? All right. All right.  Starting from today, I will stop being a slave of alcohol.  

Devasoma: My lord, please don't interrupt your penance by breaking your holy  vow because of me. [falls at his feet]  

Kapalika: [happily raising her up and embracing her] Dhrrna dhrrna, homage  to Siva. My love,  

Drink up until intoxication,  

Look deep into your lover's eyes,  

Wear fancy clothes from every nation:  

Long life to the god who found  

So fine a path for our salvation. (7) 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKA S 87  

Devasoma: Is it proper to speak in this way? The Jain saints describe the path  to salvation in quite another way.  

Kapalika: Dear, their views are completely mistaken.  

The Jains argue that each effect  

Resembles the cause from which it came.  

But against this they also expect  

That the bliss of our eternal salvation  

Comes from penance and its pain.  

These fools defeat this curious claim  

With their own logical argumentation. (8)  

Devasoma: May their sins be ended.  

Kapalika: May their sins be ended. There is no point even to revile these sin ners. They torment living beings by making them remain celibate, tear out  their hair, refuse to bathe, eat only at certain hours, and wear dirty clothes.  Even mentioning them makes me now want to wash out my mouth with  liquor.  

Devasoma: Then let's go off to another liquor shop.  

Kapalika: My love, let's do it.  

[Both walk about.]  

Kapalika: Ah, the city of Kanchi is incredibly beautiful. The sounds of drums  mix with thunder from the clouds that sit on the top of the tall palaces; the  flower markets create their own spring season; the rustle of young girls  moving about announces the immanent victory of the God of Love. Likewise,  

The infinite, incomparable bliss  

That wise sages first discovered  

Is now as close as one could wish.  

For we have added a special measure,  

No need to abandon the life of a lover  

This bliss includes all sensual pleasure. (9)  

Devasoma: My lord, just like the goddess of liquor, Kanchi is irreproachably  sweet.  

Kapalika: My love, just look. This liquor shop equals the majesty of the sac rificial enclosure. Here the flag pole equals the sacrificial post; the liquor  equals the soma; the drinkers, the priests; the liquor glasses, the soma cups;  the snacks such as meat kabobs, the various oblations; the drunken chatter,  the sacrificial formulas; the songs, the sacrificial hymns; the liquor vats, the  sacrificial ladles; the thirst of the drinkers, the sacrificial fire; and the owner  of the shop, the sponsor of the sacrifice.  

Devasoma: And the alms we get here will be the offering to Rudra.  Kapalika: Ah, the dances of these drunken games create such a beautiful, con fused uproar. The dancers move to the rhythm of the drums, gesture, shout, 

HO DAVI D N. LORENZE N  

flirt, lift up their shirts with one hand, and lose the beat for a second as they  hike up their falling garments.  

Devasoma: Ah, my teacher is a true connoisseur.  

Kapalika: When poured into glasses, the goddess of liquor puts jewels to  shame, reconciles angry lovers, and gives courage to youth. She is the very  soul of pleasure. What more can I say?  

It's just not true what they claim  

About the way the fiery ray  

From Siva's eye burned to ashes  

The body of our god of love.  

What really happened I prefer to think  

Is that Siva's penance was so intense  

The heat produced could not be controlled,  

So when love came too near to the flame  

He melted like wax, and ever since  

Has fueled the fire of our desire. (10)  

Devasoma: This is true, my lord. Siva is devoted to the world's welfare and  would never destroy it.  

[Both drum on their own cheeks.]  

Kapalika: Madam, please give us alms.  

[From behind the scenes.] My lord, here are some alms. Please accept them.  

Kapalika: I accept them. My love, where is my skull bowl?  Devasoma: I don't see it anywhere.  

Kapalika: [thinking] Hm, I guess maybe I forgot it in the liquor shop? Oh well,  we'll have to go back and see.  

Devasoma: My lord, it is against our rule to not accept alms that have been  offered with respect. What do we do now?  

Kapalika: We will have to resort to the rule for emergencies and accept them  in this cow horn.  

Devasoma: So be it. [He accepts the alms. ]  

[Both then walk about looking for the skull bowl]  

Kapalika: How can it be that even here we cannot find it? [acting depressed]  Listen, all you Mahesvaras, have any of you here seen our alms bowl? What  did you say? You haven't seen it? Ay, I'm ruined. My penance is broken.  How can I still remain a Kapalika? Alas,  

My spotless skull was a very dear friend.  

With it in my hand I drank and was fed  

And used it at night to pillow my head.  

Its loss is a hurt that just won't mend. (11) 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 89  [Falls and beats his head on the ground. ]  

Let it be. The skull is merely a symbol. I can still keep the title of a Kapalika.  [stands up]  

Devasoma: My lord, who could have grabbed the skull?  

Kapalika: My love, I suspect that it was stolen by a dog or by a Buddhist monk  for the meat kabobs that were in it.  

Devasoma: To find it, then, we're going to have to search the whole city of  Kanchi.  

Kapalika: So we will, my love.  

[Both walk about. Then a Buddhist monk enters with a bowl in his hand.]  

Buddhist: Ah, the house of the lay devotee and merchant Dhanadasa provides  the most magnificent charity. There I obtained these abundant morsels of  all sorts of rich smelling, tasty fish and meat. Now I'm going off to the royal  monastery.  

[walking about, he says to himself] The compassionate Lord Buddha grat ified the community of monks with teachings that instruct them to live in  mansions, to sleep on well-constructed beds, to eat in the morning, to take  well-flavored drinks in the afternoon, to chew betel leaves mixed with five  perfumes, and to wear comfortable clothes. But what I haven't seen are the  rules for taking a wife or drinking liquor. Is it possible that the Omniscient  One did not envision this? I suspect that these tired, evil Buddhist elders  removed the rules about women and liquor from the holy books out of their  jealousy of us young folk. Where can I find an unmodified original text? If  I find it, I will gratify the community by making known to all the complete  words of the Buddha.  

[He walks about.]  

Devasoma: My lord, look. Look at that fellow in the red robe scurrying about  in the middle of this royal road filled with crowds of happy people. He is all  hunched over, looking this way and that, and moving as if he's scared of  /'something.  

Kapalika: My love, you're quite right. And his hand is inside his robe as if he  is hiding something.  

Devasoma: My lord, let's go and grab him and find out.  

Kapalika: So be it. ]approaching] Hey, monk. Stop!  

Buddhist: Who's calling me? [turning and looking] Ay, it's the evil Kapalika  who lives at the temple of Ekamranatha. Well, I have no intention of being  the target of his drunken violence, [goes off in haste]  

Kapalika: Aha. My love, we've found our skull. Did you see him run away in  fear when he saw me? This is clear evidence that he is the thief. [Quickly  cutting him off, the Kapalika stops htm.] Hah! Where will you go now, you  bastard? 

90 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  

Buddhist: Kapalika, please don't. What's this? [aside] Hm, this female devotee  is really beautiful.  

Kapalika: Listen, monk. Show me right now. I want to see what you have in  the hand hidden beneath your robe.  

Buddhist: What is there to see? It is only a begging bowl.  

Kapalika: That's precisely what I want to see.  

Buddhist: No, Kapalika, please don't. It is proper that this bowl should be kept  hidden.  

Kapalika: Aha, then it was for the sake of hiding things that the Buddha first  taught you to wear such ample robes.  

Buddhist: This is true.  

Kapalika: This is the relative truth. But I want to hear the absolute truth.  Buddhist: Enough of this mockery! The hours for begging are over. I have to  go. [He sets off.]  

Kapalika: Ha, bastard, where are you going? Give me the skull.  [He grabs the end of the monk's robe.]  

Buddhist: Hail to the Buddha!  

Kapalika: What you should say is "Hail to Kharapata!" He's the one who wrote  the sacred book of thieves. Or was the Buddha even more an expert in this  topic than even Kharapata? Why's this?  

The ideas he stole, that thieving Tathagata,  

From the Upanisads and Mahabharata,  

He brazenly claimed as original thinking,  

While foolish brahmans stood there blinking. (12)  

Buddhist: May your sins be ended.  

Kapalika: How is it possible that the sins of a well-behaved ascetic like myself  not be ended?  

Devasoma: My lord, you look tired. This cherished skull is not going to be  easy to obtain. You should drink some liquor from this cow horn in order  to recover your strength before you get into a fight with him.  

[Devasoma gives some liquor to the Kapalika. ]  

Kapalika: [drinks] My love, you too should remove your fatigue.  Devasoma: Thank you, my lord. [drinks[  

Kapalika: This Buddhist has offended us. But sharing is the chief thing in our  own doctrine. Let this teacher have the rest.  

Devasoma: Whatever my lord commands. Take this, Sir.  

Buddhist: [aside[ Ha, how easy it was to get a good result. But this is so sinful,  and a big merchant might see me. [aloud] No, no, madam. This is not proper  for us. [licks the corners of his mouth]  

Devasoma: Go to hell! What makes you so smug?  

Kapalika: My love, his mouth is watering so much that his words, so opposed  to his desire, can barely be understood. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 91  

Buddhist: You still have no compassion.  

Kapalika: If I had compassion, how could I be an ascetic free of passion?  Buddhist: One who is free of passion should also be free of anger.  Kapalika: I'll be free of anger if you give me what belongs to me.  Buddhist: And what's that?  

Kapalika: My skull!  

Buddhist: How your skull?  

Kapalika: "How your skull?" he says. But this is quite appropriate.  

If you are really a son of the Buddha,  

Who wrongly tried to insist  

That visible things, huge and imposing,  

Do not in fact exist,  

Even earth, mountains, rivers, and ocean,  

What could stop you from denying  

The skull you hold in your fist? (13)  

Deyasoma: My lord, He'll never give it back with such gentle treatment. Let's  just go and grab it from his hand.  

Kapalika: Let's do it, my love. [They do their best to grab it]  Buddhist: Go to hell, you evil Kapalika! [He pushes him with his hand and kicks  him with his foot.]  

Kapalika: How's this? I've fallen.  

Devasoma: [to Buddhist] You're a dead man, son of a slave girl! {She tries to  grab him by the hair, but since he has none, she falls.]  

Buddhist: [aside] How wise was the Buddha when he foresaw the need to have  a shaven head, [aloud] Get up, sister, get up. [He helps Devasoma to get up.]  Kapalika: Look at this, Mahesvaras. This evil monk named Nagasena is grab bing the hand of my sweetheart.  

Buddhist: No, brother, I'm not. Our rule is to help those fallen into distress.  Kapalika: Is this yet another rule of the Omniscient One? Wasn't I the first  one to fall? But let it be. It doesn't matter. Now your head is about to become  my skull bowl.  

[All of them make a big uproar.]  

Buddhist: Help, help!  

Kapalika: Look, Mahesvaras. This evil so-called monk first robs me of my skull  bowl, and then he calls for help. Let it be. I too can make a scandal. Sacrilege,  sacrilege!  

[A Pasupata then enters. ]  

Pasupata: Satyasoma, why are you calling for help?  

Kapalika: Ah, Babhrukalpa, this evil so-called monk Nagasena has stolen my  skull bowl and doesn't want to give it back.  

Pasupata: [aside] In this matter I should act like the Gandharvas and try to get  the girl for myself. 

92 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  

The barber's wench who I quite fancy  

This Buddhist rogue has lured his way  

Offering her coins from beneath his robe,  

As if tempting a cow with a fist of hay. (14)  

But I will now defeat my rival by inciting this pimp against him. [aloud]  Nagasena, is it true what he said?  

Buddhist: My lord, How can you say this? It is a Buddhist precept that one  should abstain from taking what is not given. It is a precept that one should  abstain from false speech. It is a precept that one should abstain from sexual  intercourse. It is a precept that one should abstain from taking a life. It is a  precept that one should abstain from eating at inappropriate times. I take  my refuge in the religion of the Buddha.  

Pasupata: Satyasoma, such is their moral code. What can you reply?  Kapalika: Well, our code is that one should not tell lies.  

Pasupata: Both these codes are quite appropriate. But how can we decide the  case?  

Buddhist: What possible motive can there be for one who takes the Buddha's  word as his authority to grab a bowl full of liquor?  

Pasupata: A disputant cannot win a case by mere affirmation.  Kapalika: When we have direct evidence, what is the point of disputation?  Pasupata: What sort of direct evidence?  

Devasoma: My lord, he has the skull in his hand hidden inside his monk's  robe.  

Pasupata: You heard what she said.  

Buddhist: This so-called skull doesn't belong to anyone else.  Kapalika: Let us see it then.  

Buddhist: There! [He shows it]  

Kapalika: [sarcastically] Look, Mahesvaras. Look at the injustice perpetrated  by the Kapalika and the excellent conduct of this Buddhist monk.  Buddhist: It is a Buddhist precept that one should abstain from taking what is  not given. [He again recites the precepts. ]  

[Both the Kapalika and Devasoma dance. ]  

Buddhist: What's this? When he should be ashamed, he dances instead.  Kapalika: Hah, who's dancing? [looking all around] He thinks he sees dancing  in the display of my delight, like a flower swaying in the wind, at once again  seeing my lost skull bowl.  

Buddhist: My lord, why don't you take a closer look at this bowl. Tell me, what  color is it?  

Kapalika: What do you want me to say? Do you think I can't see? This skull  is blacker than a crow.  

Buddhist: Then you yourself admit that this is mine and not yours. 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKAS 93  

Kapalika: What I really admit is that you know how to change its color.  Look . . .  

Once your robe was as white as chalk,  

As bright as the silk of a lotus stalk,  

And didn't you slyly make it one  

With a tint as red as the rising sun? (15)  

And besides . . .  

Since you are stained, inside and out,  

With a blood-red hue,  

How could my skull not acquire  

The same stain too? (16)  

Devasoma: Ay, I'm ruined! How terrible! How did this skull get such a changed  condition by coming into contact with stained cloth? Endowed with all the  auspicious marks, it was as holy as the skull of Brahma. It shone like the  full moon and was always full of liquor. [She weeps.]  

Kapalika: My love, don't cry. It will become pure once again. The sacred scrip tures say that great beings have their faults removed through penance.  

Our Master Siva, the god of the crescent moon,  

Once undertook the vow called Mahavrata  

To free himself from the heavy sin that befell,  

When he cut off one of the heads of the god of creation.  

Likewise, Indra, king of the thirty gods,  

Once killed the three-headed son of mighty Tvastar  

But managed to get the burden of his sin removed  

Through the merit of a hundred sacrifices. (17)  

Babhrukalpa, is this not so?  

Pasupata: This is what the sacred Agamas declare.  

Buddhist: Sir, if I changed its color, who made it this shape and size?  Kapalika: Did you Buddhists not spring from the lineage of Maya?  Buddhist: For how long do I have to curse you? Here, you take it.  Kapalika: Did not the Buddha himself perfect the supreme virtue of generosity?  Buddhist: Now that this is over, where will I find refuge?  

Kapalika: Isn't your refuge the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sahgha?  Pasupata: I am unable to decide this case. We will have to take it to the court.  Devasoma: My lord, if we do this, it's goodbye to the skull.  Pasupata: What do you mean?  

Devasoma: This Buddhist has behind him the wealth of many monasteries. He  can fill the mouths of the officials of the court at will. But we are servants  of the poor Kapalika, whose wealth is merely a snake skin and ashes. With  what wealth do we enter the court? 

94 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  Pasupata: This isn't so.  

The law, like the palace, has strong foundations,  

Upright, solid, polished, and firm,  

The one good pillars, the other good persons. (18)  

Kapalika: Enough of this! A person who obeys the law need not fear anything.  Buddhist: [to the Pasupata] My Lord, you should lead the way.  Pasupata: So be it.  

[All of them walk about. Then a madman enters. ]  

Madman: This evil dog! You've grabbed the skull full of meat kabobs and run  away with it. Son of a slave girl, where are you going to go? Now, he's  dropped the skull and is coming running to bite me. [looking in all directions]  I'll break his teeth with this stone. Why have you left the skull and run  away? Crazy, evil dog, do you dare to get angry even with someone as brave  as me? The ocean has mounted the boar of the village and flown up to the  sky. It has conquered Ravana and has seized by force Indra's son Timingala.  Ay, castor oil tree, what did you say? "It's not true. It's not true." Is not this  cloud, with its hands as long and wide as a club, my witness? But why should  a person like me, whose bravery is renowned throughout the three worlds,  need any witnesses? This is what I'm going to do. I'll eat the leftover morsel  of meat that the dog bit into. [He eats and then looks confused.[ Ay, ay, I've  been killed by tears. [He weeps and looks.] Who is this who's beating me?  [He looks.] Evil dog, I am the nephew of someone important, as Ghatotkaca  was the nephew of Bhlmasena. Besides . . .  

My belly is full of a hundred demons  

In many guises, shapes, and sizes,  

And from my mouth come flying out  

Giant snakes and a hundred lions. (19)  

Why are they harassing me? Be kind, be kind to me, my young lords. Don't  harass me because of this morsel of meat. [He looks ahead. ] This must be  my teacher Suranandin. I'll go up to him. [He runs.]  

Pasupata: Ay, this madman is coming toward me.  

His robe is tattered and secondhand,  

His hair a wild and tangled mess,  

Around his neck a withered garland,  

His body covered with dust and ash.  

Above his head are crows and hawks,  

ready to scavenge whatever they can  

It looks as though before us walks  

A garbage heap in the form of a man. (20) 

A PARODY OF THE KAPALIKA S 95  

Madman: I'll approach this one. [He approaches.] My lord, please accept this  skull obtained from an excellent dog belonging to a Candala.  Pasupata: [looking with disdain] Let this be accepted by a more worthy person.  Madman: Great Brahman [approaching the Buddhist], please do me this favor.  Buddhist: [indicating the Kapalika] This Great Pasupata is more worthy.  Madman: [Approaching the Kapalika, he places the skull on the ground, circu mabulates, and falls at his feet. ] Great saint, please do me this favor. This  homage is for you.  

Kapalika: My skull!  

Devasoma: So it is!  

Kapalika: By the grace of god I have again become a true Kapalika.  Madman: You son of a slave girl, may you eat poison. [He grabs the skull and  goes off]  

Kapalika: ]chasing after him] This servant of Death is stealing my life itself!  Help me you two!  

Both: As you wish. We'll be your helpers.  

[All try to stop the madman.]  

Kapalika: Stop you, stop!  

Madman: Why are they stopping me?  

Kapalika: Give me my skull and be gone.  

Madman: You fool, can't you see that this is a gold bowl?  

Kapalika: Who would ever make a gold bowl like this?  

Madman: I tell you, this is a gold bowl made by the bastard of a goldsmith  who wears golden clothes.  

Buddhist: What are you saying?  

Madman: It's a gold bowl.  

Buddhist: Is he a madman?  

Madman: "Madman. . ." I keep hearing that word. Take this and show me the  madman. [He hands the skull to the Kapalika. ]  

Kapalika: [grabbing the skull[ He's over there hidden behind that wall. Go  quickly and follow him.  

Madman: You have been most kind.  

[The madman hastily exits.]  

Buddhist: It's a miracle! I have been saved by the success of my opponent.  Kapalika: [hugging the skull]  

Unbroken penance for years I suffered,  

And devotion to Siva alone I offered.  

Now the madman has gone away  

And you, my skull, are back, hooray! (21)  

Devasoma: My lord, when I see you today, looking like the evening reunited  with the moon, my very eyes rejoice.96 DAVI D N . LORENZE N  

Pasupata: How lucky you are.  

Kapalika: Is this not a good result for all of you?  

Pasupata: [aside] What's true is that those who have no fault need not fear.  Today this monk escaped from the mouth of the tiger, [aloud] Now that I  have been made happy by the success of my friend, I will go and wait for  the evening worship at the eastern temple of the Lord. And starting from  today. . .  

May the quarrel that once bound you two together  

Now become the source of mutual love  

As once it was when Kirata fought with Arjuna. (22)  

[The Pasupata exits.]  

Kapalika: Honorable Nagasena, if I have done you any offense, I hope you will  forgive me.  

Buddhist: Need you even ask? What can I do for you?  

Kapalika: If I have your forgiveness, what thing better than that can I request?  Buddhist: It is time for me to go.  

Kapalika: I hope I will see you again.  

Buddhist: May it be so. [He exits.]  

Kapalika: Devasoma, my love, let us go also.  

[Epilogue]  

May the sacred fires always lift up to heaven  

Oblations offered on the people's behalf.  

May the brahmans serve the Vedas and cows give milk,  

May the people be happy, each intent on his dharma.  

May King Mahendra subdue his enemies' power  

And rule for as long as the sun and moon exist. (23)  

[Both exit]
