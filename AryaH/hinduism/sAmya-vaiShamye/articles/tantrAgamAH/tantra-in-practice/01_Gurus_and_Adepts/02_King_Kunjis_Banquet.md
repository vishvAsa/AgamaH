Matthew I. Kapstein  

The traditions concerning the Indian Tantric adepts known as the Siddhas ("per fected ones") have long fascinated scholars of the Tantric religions. This reflects  the great popularity of these traditions in the arts and literature of India, Nepal,  and Tibet, and the fact that several of the living Tantric communities, both Saivite  

and Buddhist, trace themselves back to the inspiration of the Siddhas.  Although some of the Siddhas were no doubt purely mythical personages, many  were famed teachers and adepts who lived in India during the last centuries of  the first millennium C.E. and the first centuries of the second. The tales concerning  the lives of all of them, however, are entwined in sacred legend, so that in most  cases it is very difficult to arrive at precise historical conclusions about these  figures. Several traditions speak of a collective grouping of eighty-four Mahasid dhas ("Great Siddhas"), and though the precise enumeration of the eighty-four  differs somewhat from one lineage to another, a Buddhist version of the Lives of  the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas, as compiled by the Indian adept Abhayadatta and  preserved in a Tibetan translation done close to the year 1100, has become the  most widely known source for the legendary accounts of their lives.  The Lives is itself only one part of a larger collection of Buddhist literature  relating to the Mahasiddhas that was introduced into Tibet during the same pe riod. Also important is a short verse collection, the Anthology of the Essential Re alizations of the Eighty-four Siddhas, compiled initially by an Indian teacher named  Viraprabha. This work parallels the Lives and has an extensive commentary re cording the oral commentary of Abhayadatta upon it. The three works just men tioned, however, do not yet constitute the totality of the collection. Unnoticed by  scholars so far is a peculiar text called the Garland of Gems, translated for the first  time below, which is also accompanied by a commentary attributed to the col laboration of Abhayadatta and his Tangut disciple Mondrup Sherap (Smon-grub shes-rab). This work, like the commentary on the anthology of songs, was cer tainly written in Tibetan, possibly on the basis of the Indian master Abhayadatta's  instructions, but it is not the direct translation of an Indian text. 

KIN G KUNJI' S BANQUE T 53  

The Garland of Gems presents itself as a summary of the systems of Tantric  yoga and meditation taught by the eighty-four Siddhas, though the commentary  in fact only mentions some of the eighty-four by name. According to the legend  of its origin, the Garland of Gems was first taught on behalf of a yaksini, a type of  female spirit who in this case is said to have haunted a cremation ground. The  efficacy of its teachings is accentuated by this tale, for it is claimed that by prac 

ticing them a tormented, inhuman creature achieved in the end a state of physical  and psychic well-being. The text was first promulgated among ordinary human  beings after the strange banquet hosted by a certain King Kunji, as recounted in  the first extract translated below. The actual content of the Garland of Gems is  consistent with later Tibetan Tantric accounts of the teaching of the Mahasiddhas,  and accordingly emphasizes instructions concerning the ultimate nature of mind,  often referred to elsewhere as the "Great Seal" (mahamudra), and the major tech 

niques of Buddhist Tantric yoga called the "six doctrines": the Inner Heat, or Wild  Woman, whereby one masters the subtle physical energies of the body; Appari tion, through which the illusion-like nature of ordinary experience becomes  known; Dream, in which one achieves the ability to explore consciously and to  transform the dream experience; Radiant Light, referring to the luminous dimen sion of the mind; Transference, the means to cause one's consciousness to leave  the body abruptly at the moment of death, and to seek rebirth in a pure realm;  and the Liminal Passage (bardo in Tibetan), which here refers primarily to the  state of consciousness in the course of migration between death and rebirth. The  first four enable one to attain enlightenment swiftly during this very lifetime, the  last two to achieve it at death.  

The most widely known part of the Buddhist Siddha literature, however, has  been Abhayadatta's Lives, which consists of an exotic collection of stories, not  exactly fairy tales, speaking of strange and eccentric saints. As an example, we  may summarize the first episode, which recounts the life of Luipa, the "eater of  fish guts." In this case, as in many others, the "name" of the Siddha is actually a  sobriquet, referring to an outstanding characteristic or, as in the case of Tantipa,  the weaver, the Siddha's occupation. "Pa," which is affixed to the names of many  of the Siddhas, is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word for "foot" (pada) and  in this context means "venerable," that is, one whose feet are worthy of veneration.  

Luipa, it is said, was a Sri Lankan prince, and the reluctant heir to his father's  throne. After several failed efforts to flee the palace he succeeded at last, and  became a wandering ascetic in India. By chance one day, while begging, he en countered a prostitute who was in fact a dakim, a woman embodying enlightened  wisdom, and she, being clairvoyant, detected that despite his outward saintly  deportment, there was still a smidgen of pride in his heart. She poured some vile  slop into his begging bowl and he, disgusted, threw it out. At this the dakini  exclaimed, "how are you ever going to get enlightened, if you're still such a picky  eater?" Luipa, recognizing that indeed he was covertly preoccupied with mundane  judgments, resolved to uproot the last of his attachments, and dwelling near a  fishermen's settlement on the banks of the Ganges, he practiced austerities for 

54 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

twelve years while living on the entrails and other refuse discarded after the catch.  So it was that he eventually freed himself from all mundane patterns of thought,  and was able to transmute even the foulest matter into the deathless nectar of  gnosis.  

As we have seen above, the collection of which the Lives is one part also includes  various songs and teachings attributed to the Siddhas. The relationship, in any  given case, between a Siddha's life, song, and teaching is not always straightfor ward, but the verses attributed to Luipa do seem to correlate with his story, and  so may be taken to exemplify those cases in which such a correspondence is to  be found. At the beginning of Viraprabha's anthology he sings:  

When honey's smeared on the snout of a wild, mad dog,  

it eats whatever it meets.  

Likewise, when the guru bestows precepts on a luckless fool,  

his spirit is scorched.  

But the fortunate, who realize the unborn in whatever appears  

thereby destroy common thought.  

They become like mad battle elephants, swords tied to their trunks,  demolishing enemy legions.  

And the particular teaching attributed to Luipa in the The Garland of Gems,  translated below, is called the "the instruction that applies to all appearances you  meet." All of this seems to fit neatly together with the tale of his overcoming his  finicky tastes by adopting a diet of rubbish.  

Much of the modern scholarship concerning the lives of the Siddhas has fo cused either upon the quasi-historical dimensions of these traditions or upon  allegorical readings of them. Both approaches, to be sure, were in some sense  sanctioned by the traditional Buddhist schools in which the collection was known.  One author has gone so far as to tabulate a "lineage tree," arranging the eighty four Siddhas into a single complex geneology. This tendency to historicization  continues to inform Western interpretation, despite the observation, clearly artic ulated a half century ago by Shashibhushan Dasgupta, that eighty-four is a mys tical number and that the grouping of eighty-four Siddhas is "complete" only in  the sense that it fills out this mystical number. Accordingly, in Dasgupta's words,  there is justifiable "doubt about the historical nature of the tradition of the eighty four Siddhas." Dasgupta also provided a long and suggestive list of classifications  that use the number eighty-four in Indian religious traditions; I add here only  that, from a numerological point of view, the number eighty-four has the inter esting property of being the product of the sum and the product of three and  four:  

(3 + 4) X (3 X 4) = 84  

Thus, symbolically it encompasses the range of possible relationships obtaining  among the innumerable magical and natural categories involving threes and fours. 

KING KUNJI'S BANQUET 55  

That the number eighty-four is entirely arbitrary from a historical perspective is  further underscored when the various traditional lists of Mahasiddhas are com pared, even if we restrict ourselves to the lists found within only the Buddhist  

tradition; for there are a great many significant discrepancies among them.  If the tales and traditions of the Siddhas are to be regarded not as historical  but as constituting a mythic collection, then just what is this a myth of? Despite  the tendency to incorporate the traditions of the Siddhas into those sanctioned  by the mainstream monastic orders of Tibetan Buddhism, it is clear that margin ality and idiosyncracy are powerful themes; this, indeed, accounts for the appeal  these tales have had in the contemporary Western religious counterculture. The  quasi-canonical status of the tradition, the often enigmatic language of its poetry,  the eccentricities of the iconography associated with it, its apparently strong con nections with other medieval Indian religious traditions that arose outside the  bounds of high-status society, and similarly with such Tibetan Buddhist traditions  as the Kagyu (Bka'-brgyud) yogic lineages - all of this seems to reinforce the view  that this is a myth of freedom from convention, of the rejection of rigid norms.  But this interpretation is clearly simplistic, for the force of tradition has been to  normalize the apparently rebellious Siddhas, and to incorporate them and their  teachings within a program of well-ordered religious discipline. The tale of King  Kunji's banquet seems to underwrite just such a perspective, by freezing the  Siddhas in the form of statues worshiped by a royal patron. Perhaps we can speak,  then, of the institutionalization of idiosyncracy through the cooperation of myth  and normative practice. In other words, in the case of the Siddhas, a myth of  idiosyncratic freedom undergirds an enduring ethos of order.  

The Tibetan texts translated below are found in the great nineteenth-century  encyclopedia of Tibetan esoterica: 'Jam mgon Kong sprul Blo gros mtha' yas,  Gdams ngag mdzod: A Treasury of Instructions and Techniques for Spiritual Realization  (Delhi: N. Lungtok and N. Gyaltsan, 1971), vol. 11, pp. 9-11 ("King Kunji's  Banquet) and 92-143 ("The Garland of Gems"). Because the cryptic style of the  original does not lend itself to literal English translation, I provide a rather free  rendition of the verse text of the Garland of Gems. In the case of the commentary  accompanying the verses, I supply here an abridged restatement of the Tibetan  original, supplemented by my own occasional remarks intended to clarify the  meaning of the verses. For further clarification of the text as a whole, I have added  a topical outline.

King Kunji's Banquet  

In the western part of India, in Kantamara, a district in Saurastra [modern  Gujarat], the religious king Kunji governed his realm righteously. At some  point his mother took ill and was fast approaching death. The king lovingly  asked her, "Now it seems you will not live for long, Ma. For your benefit in  future lives, I will do whatever you command and will offer donations for the  worship of the community of monks, the brahmans, and the temples, and for  charity and so forth."  

His mother replied, "You needn't bother with the other virtues on my behalf.  Just host a Tantric banquet for the eighty-four yogins and yoginis who have

become Siddhas, and pray to them for my sake!" With these last words, she  died.  

The king then thought, "Those past Siddhas are no longer seen among men,  so how can I invite them? But I cannot violate mother's dying wish. Because  the Mahasiddhas are compassionate, all I can think to do is to pray." He prayed  one-pointedly, and the two gnostic dakinis, Kokali and Dharmavisva ["Dha 

madhuma" in the Garland of Gems], became visibly manifest and said, "We two  will help you! Let's invite the Siddhas and prepare a banquet hall!" The king  arranged a great hall for the Tantric feast, while the two dakinis, through their  miraculous abilities, journeyed to the various sacred lands in an instant to  invite the Siddhas. Luipa was the first to arrive, and the other Siddhas also  arrived momentarily, in their appointed order, and took their seats. The king  generously served up the delights of the banquet, and they remained assembled  in the Tantric feast for a long time. In the end, although the king asked the  Siddhas to remain for a while so that he could continue to worship them, they  would not permit this. Instead, each Siddha sang for the king one of his or her  own vajra-songs, called dohas, and then vanished into the unknown. The king  constructed images to represent each of the Siddhas, before which each one's  song was written, and there he worshiped them.  

At the same time, a scholar named Viraprabha, who was traveling far away  to the east, heard that the eighty-four Siddhas had actually come to be wor shiped by King Kunji, and he made haste to come there, but arrived a week  after the Siddhas had left. He grew disconsolate and prayed fervently for seven 

58 MATTHE W T. KAPSTEI N  

days, whereupon the two dakinis visibly appeared, and transmitted to him the  Garland of Gems, the very songs that had been sung at the royal feast, and other  teachings, together with the tales of the eighty-four. He meditated upon their  significance and thereby gained special realization, becoming himself a lord  among Siddhas. He also authored a book in which the various dohas were  collected together, and later he transmitted these teachings to the brahman  scholar Kamala. The latter taught them to the Siddha and hermit Jamari, and  he to the scholar from Magadha, Abhayadatta, who composed the collection  of the tales of the eighty-four Siddhas and the commentary on the dohas. All  of texts mentioned above were brought together and translated here in Tibet  by that same scholar and his disciple, the Tangut translator Mondrup Sherap.  

The Garland of Gems  

In the Indian Language: Ratnamala [-noma]  

In the Tibetan Language: Rin chen phreng ba zhes bya ba  

According to Tibetan custom, in order for future generations to recall the efforts  of past translators and scholars, the title must be given in both Sanskrit and  Tibetan. In this case, it is explained that because each of the teachings of the  Siddhas has many precious facets, they are like gems (ratnas), and because many  such teachings are strung together here, they form a garland (mala).  

Salutations to the Transcendent Lord of Speech [the bodhisattva Manjusri]

Manjusri, the bodhisattva of wisdom, is invoked before the beginning of the  verse text in order to remove obstacles to the understanding of the text as a whole.  

Introductory Verses  

1. Your black hair is piled in a topknot,  

Your eyes deep blue like the blue lotus  

Your body is convulsed in your terrible roar - 

To you, Acala, I bow in homage.  

Acala is one of the foremost divinities of Tantric Buddhism, and is depicted in  many forms, usually ferocious or wrathful, and wielding a sword. In later Buddhist  Tantrism he became particularly popular in Nepal and in Japan, where he is often  seen as a temple protector and is called Fudo.  

2. I will not set down here all that was seen and heard  

At the assembly of eighty-four Siddhas  

In the heaven of manifest delight, 

KIN G KUNJI' S BANQUE T 5 9  

That then was well practiced by Dhamadhuma;  

But I shall explain the Garland of Gems  

That was given as an instruction to the yaksini.  

Because those fortunate enough to encounter or even hear of the assembly of  the Siddhas become delighted by it, that assembly is known as the "heaven of  manifest delight." The dakini Dhamadhuma thoroughly mastered a great many  teachings that the Siddhas bestowed there, but here only the Garland of Gems,  which was taught on behalf of a yaksini, will be discussed. What, then, is the  story of that teaching?  

Once upon a time, in the cremation ground called Sama Grove (sa-ma'i tshal),  there lived a yaksini who was condemned by her own misdeeds to dwell there  feeding on carrion. In the northeastern quarter of the cremation ground there was  a great hollow tree, inhabited by a family of seven bears. A huge rhinocerous 

demon went to sleep there and fell over, crushing the tree and killing its inhab itants. At that point the yaksini arrived, killed the rhinocerous-demon, and found  the flesh of the dead brood of bears. An ogre, however, was attracted by the odor  of flesh and blood, and seeing that the yaksini had reached the feast first, became  greatly enraged at her. Flying above, he poured molten copper upon her, so that  she was horribly burned and suffered terribly. This was karmic retribution for the  suffering she herself had caused other beings during her previous lives. Two  dakinis, named Kokila and Dharmadevi [the "Dhamadhuma" mentioned above],  took pity upon her and healed her wounds with mantras, except for one place  where she had been burned right through to the bone. However, the two were  the disciples of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas, who at that very time were gathered  together in the pure land of manifest delight, where they recognized the yaksini  to be receptive to the Buddha's teaching. They therefore composed a short text,  the Garland of Gems, epitomizing their own religious instructions, and transmitted  it to the two dakinis, who in turn taught it to the yaksini. [In the commentary,  however, the text is presented as a teaching given in direct dialogue with the  yaksini.] By the power of this teaching she finally came to be fully healed in both  body and spirit, and went on to become a great dakini in her own right, named  Sumati.  

Luipa's Teaching: "The Instruction That Applies  

to All Appearances"  

The foregoing remarks serve as an introduction. The actual teaching of the Garland  of Gems begins with an instruction of Luipa, "The Instruction That Applies to All  Appearances You Meet," which was delivered to benefit the ailing yaksini.  When she requested this teaching, he said to her,  

"Your fault is not knowing your own nature. If you know that, you'll be freed  from appearances, not to speak of bodily appearances alone." 

60 MATTHE W T. KAPSTEI N  

"What's it to know your own nature?"  

"It is a luminous gnosis, in which the continuum of mundane reality comes to  an end."  

When she replied that she still didn't get the point, he said:  

3. In what is insubstantial and incessant,  

Without boundary or center, and thus pervasive,  

The fact of the matter is really profound,  

Like the fire of Malaya Mountain.  

Here "insubstantial" means that in the nature of things there is no substantial  being. For instance, though one may speak of a "sky-flower," nevertheless, no  such thing really exists, above and beyond the naming of it. Therefore, neither it,  nor its supposed attributes, such as color and form, can be said to exist substan 

tially. It is when the entire continuum of the attributions of existence, appearance,  emptiness, idea, mind, and thought comes to an end that we speak of "luminous  gnosis." Like the radiance of a precious gem, it is "incessant," and for this reason  is characterized as "without boundary or center, and thus pervasive." Like un 

compounded space, it embraces everything, from the highest heavens to the  depths of hell. And because the yaksini has the potential to realize her pain, her  mental activity, and her apprehension of appearances to be in fact that luminous  gnosis, "the fact of the matter is really profound." It is "like the fire of Malaya  Mountain" that incinerates all it encounters.  

The yaksini, however, did not understand this, and so asked the Siddha Lilapa  for clarification. He responded:  

4. You are as one born from the ocean of things,  

Longing to rest in the mire of things;  

But what is experienced in the absence  

Of the bee, nectar and flower?  

The second couplet refers to the conditions for realization. Just as a sweet taste  occurs when a flower, its nectar, and a bee come together, but not so long as they  remain apart, so too, so long as you have not yet realized gnosis and remain  clinging to bodily apprehensions, unable to detach yourself from objects, you will  not experience the blissful taste of your inherent nature. And until you experience  that taste, you will not be free of your pain.  

The Siddha Kokala then taught her how that understanding becomes firm:  

5. Like Brahma to the external world and its inner inhabitants,  Like timely warmth and yogurt culture,  

And like oil in mustard seed,  

If you really realize it, you'll be certain of it.  

Just as the creator-god Brahma knows the entire universe and all its inhabitants,  similarly the luminous gnosis, which is the nature of mind as taught by the guru,  pervades all that you may know. But once it is known, how is that knowledge to 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 61  

grow firm? This is explained by the three examples that follow. "Timely warmth"  refers to the warmth that occurs in the spring, which spreads throughout the  natural world; so too, the individual who knows the radiant light of mind finds  that it spreads through the range of experience. And just as a small amount of  "yogurt culture" completely transforms a large quantity of milk, without ever  getting rid of the milk, in the same way radiant light transforms mundane con 

ceptual activity, without actually abandoning it. Similarly, as oil is present in a  "mustard seed," and only needs to be brought out, but not newly created, you  come to realize that the mind in its natural state is pervaded by its radiant light.  

But what is the fruit of such realization? To answer this question, the Siddha  Camaripa was the next to speak:  

6ab. In that which is inevident, invisible, and clear,  

That space itself is revealed.  

This refers to the body of reality, the dharmakaya, which is like space, and so  "inevident, invisible, and clear." Thus, it is not to be thought of as an entity or a  nonentity, or as intellect, mind, or thought. But just as space, though not itself  shaped or colored, provides a clearing in which sun, moon, and stars, as well as  clouds, mists, rainbows, and more become manifest, so too in the invisible space  of the dharmakaya, there is an incessant outpouring of compassion, taking form  as the Buddha's bodies of rapture and emanation.  

To this Saraha added these verses:  

6cd. The body apprehended by no one is most beautiful,  

Like a treasure-vase, a wishing gem, or a jewel.  

It is in fact the nature of mind, free from the conceptions of apprehended object  and apprehending subject, that is here described as "most beautiful."  

Virupa's Teaching: "The Empty City"  

Then master Virupa sang of an instruction entitled "The Empty City":  

7. As for the city that is entirely empty,  

Ask your self: who is the creator  

Of body and speech in the three realms, the three spheres?  The self-nature of the self is nothing;  

It rests within no bounds whatsoever.  

The "city" refers outwardly to the three realms, or three spheres of the world,  and inwardly to the three spheres of body, speech, and mind, as well as to past,  present, and future. As all of this depends upon a concatenation of causes, and  does not exist independently, the entire city, whatever we conceive it to be, is  empty. To establish this, review its possible causes in turn, and ask your self who  its creator might be. You must ask your self, for you must also examine the reality 

62 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

of that self: it, too, is empty, devoid of self-nature. Perhaps you will conclude that  all there is is emptiness, but that is not so. In the final analysis, one can speak  neither of emptiness, nor nonemptiness, nor both, nor neither - "it rests within  no bounds whatsoever."  

To affirm the meaning of this, Dombipa sang:  

8. In the city that is emptied of everything  

Where is any substantially existing thing?  

This may be understood without further comment. Goraksa added:  

9. In the city of appearance, sound, and thought,  

Owing to apprehended objects, or to the apprehending of them,  The unhappy silkworm is ensnared in its own saliva.  

You'll find happiness when, without apprehending, you let go.  

The appearances and sounds of the world are imputed through conceptual  activity - in truth, nothing goes beyond conceptual activity, so that this is a "city  of thought." As you bind yourself therein, it may be exemplified by a silkworm,  wrapping itself up in its own saliva. But if you let go, and abide in the natural  condition of reality, you'll find happiness. Tantipa then said:  

10. Without renunciation, without possession,  

If you come to know, you'll not enter the city.  

But like Nanda and the gemstone light,  

You'll find the city to be supreme bliss.  

When you have abandoned both acceptance and rejection, and become free of  bewilderment, you no longer enter the city of bewilderment, but neither do you  hold to not entering it as if that were a hard fact. Instead, bewilderment itself  discloses the nature of reality, so that it becomes the city of supreme bliss. Then,  like Nanda, the king of the serpents (nagas), who perceives the wish-granting gem  that is invisible to all others, you will see that the city of thought is the city of  bliss.  

Saraha's Teaching: "Remembrance Alone"  

Following Virupa's instruction on the blissful city, Saraha again sang to the yaks ini":  

11. When someone speaks of any phenomenon,  

That speech is an act of remembrance.  

So is it not also the faculty of remembrance  

That speaks even of nirvana?  

This is the teaching of the great brahman Saraha's "Instruction on Remem brance Alone": all acts of speech are bound up in remembrance. This is the case 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 63  

whether one speaks of samsara or nirvana, tranquillity or insight, meditative equi poise or what follows after meditation, appearance or emptiness, and so on. But  what follows from that?  

12. Whatever appears - earth, water, fire, or wind - 

Simultaneously occurs within emptiness.  

The splendid appearance of gnosis  

Occurs in remembrance alone.  

Although all those phenomena are bound up in remembrance, at the moment  of their appearance they are simultaneously innately empty. Thus, all appearance  is the appearance of the gnosis of emptiness. In this way, there is no independent  phenomenon of remembrance, but it is, rather, indivisible from the appearance  of gnosis. Being indivisible, they are one: this is what is meant by "remembrance  alone."  

The Siddha Sabari then sang:  

13. If you do not know the conjunction of sun and moon,  Things are as many as waves in the sea.  

When just that which is unique occurs,  

It is not possible to find division here.  

Here, the sun symbolizes appearance, or method, and the moon emptiness, or  discernment. If you do not understand the conjunction of these, things appear as  multiplicity, like waves in the sea: despite the underlying union, conceptual acts  of remembrance become manifold. But when the essential nature of remembrance,  which is unique, and no different from the natural state, occurs, then "it is not  possible to find division here."  

To this Caurahgi added:  

14. There is not even a particle of fault here.  

It does not arise through composition.  

That is to say that the natural state of reality is entirely free from all independent  acts of remembrance, which are bound up with conceptual activity. The realiza tion of "remembrance alone" is not a conditioned phenomenon, dependent upon  causal composition.  

Then Vinapa, too, sang:  

15. The mountain of conceptual thought  

Sinks into the sea of nonconceptualization.  

As the subject is an appearance in the sphere of reality,  

Where can there be objective conceptualizations?  

The remembrance of reality becomes like a vast ocean, into which all indepen dent acts of remembrance dissolve. When The appearance of the subject is known  to be just reality, there is no conceptualization of objects as real entities. 

64 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

Minapa's Teaching: "Elemental Food and Clothing"  

Following Saraha's instruction, master Minapa conferred an instruction on feeding  and clothing oneself with the elements:  

16. The bodily vessel becomes elemental light,  

A melting stream of divine ambrosia above.  

In the mass of reality's light,  

Conceptions of the six aggregates are exhausted.  

Primarily, this refers to the creative visualization of the deity. At the start of  such meditation, the bodily mansion becomes like a vase, filled with the light of  the elements: from the seed-syallable yam comes fire-wind, like a solar orb, red  in color and half a mile in diameter. Owing to its agitation there appears the red  ram, from which fire radiates to the extent of the wind. From this steam and mist  arise, red in color: this is the fire-water, but it is contemplated as being of the  nature of light. From its condensation there appears the yellow syllable su, from  which is projected fire-earth, to the same extent as those mentioned above.  

Atop that mansion of elemental light, you then contemplate a white hum which  is in its nature a divinity embodying the essence of mind, radiating light, and  from which there is a melting stream of ambrosia. It dissolves into the elements,  intermingling thus with the bodily vase. Mind itself, in essence a divinity, of the  nature of the elements, now dissolves into light, having emanated in the form of  a hum. Present as the mass of reality in the vase of light, it is like the self-luminous  orb of the sun - concentrate upon this. The conceptual activity of the sensory  fields reaches cessation herein, and if you examine the senses themselves, they  are realized to be like lamps within a vase of light. The sign of contemplative  success is an experience of outer warmth, and in this way one is clothed by the  elements, while inner awareness is nourished by this contemplation, so that one  is thus fed.  

The yaksini, however, was unable to achieve this contemplation of elemental  food and clothing, at which point the exalted Nagarjuna sang to her:  

17. The varied conceptions of the six classes of beings  

Have arisen through the accumulated power of errant desire.  Through the power of knowledge which turns that around  You awaken as Buddha, so that all desires are fulfilled.  

The beings who inhabit the three realms of the world may be embodied in any  way whatsoever, according to the diversity of their conceptual activity, and  through the accumulated power of their perverse desires and thirsts. Thus, the  yaksini experienced her body and its pains as she did, but this would certainly  be changed to bliss if she had the power to realize the nature of mind to be a  mass of light, a solar orb.  

To this master Santipa added his instruction on the "six views, outer and inner,  which turn ephemeral cognitions around": 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 6 5  

18. The appearance of objective conditions is ceaseless,  

Just like bubbles in water.  

This is reversed by the antidote that follows meditation,  

That is just like a staff in the water.  

Sensory objects belonging to the six fields of sight, sound, taste, odor, bodily  feeling, and thought arise incessantly. These ephemeral objects continue to arise,  like bubbles in water, and so long as ephemeral appearances thus continue to  arise they won't be stopped by the mounted spear-bearing cavalry of ephemeral  cognitions (which, however forceful and impressive, have no power to stop them).  Such is the view of the six outer objects.  

To grasp the six objects, however, as independently existing things is an er roneous view, which is reversed by a cognition following meditation, which rec ognizes ephemeral occurrences to be of the nature of reality. That cognition,  which cuts through all sensations, is like a staff that passes through water. This  antidote, indeed, becomes gnosis, and is referred to as the "inner six views" (for  it applies to the same six fields of experience and cognition mentioned above).  

In the first instance, the ephemeral states are afflictions that should be re nounced. Then they are renounced by gnosis, the antidote following meditation,  which moves like a knife through the water. Finally, owing to that, what is to be  renounced and its renunciation are realized to be no different - there is gnosis  alone, known here as the "inner six views."  

The Teaching of the Two Dakinis  

After that, the two dakinis encouraged the yaksini to seek the attainments of the  Tantric divinities through five practices which they asked the Siddhas to impart  to her: master Khagarbha's abbreviated rites of Lord Acala; Kanaripa's rites of the  Mother of Wisdom; Dombipa's rites which combine the tantric divinities Cakra 

samvara and Hevajra; Caloka's rites of Amitayus, the buddha of longevity; and  Naropa's instructions on the hundred-syllable mantra of purification and repen tance. The yaksini practiced these instructions, but desired quick results and so  seized on object and subject as real. When the longed-for attainments were not,  therefore, forthcoming, she complained that there were no such attainments to  be realized, that the divinities were nonexistent, and that to persist in reciting  mantras really pissed her off.  

The two dakinis replied, "All those who have gone before have realized the  attainments. If you have not, it's only because you've failed to purify your own  continuum of being."  

"I still don't understand what this 'continuum of being' business is about."  To explain it, they said:  

19. That which possesses the seed of beauteous youth  

Abides pervading all beings.66 MATTHE W T. KAPSTEI N  

This is grasped where the best faculties appear,  

In the appearance of a unique act of gnosis.  

20. This is the shifting shape of clouds in the sky,  

The reflection appearing in a mirror.  

When you examine this, just so,  

No purpose is gained by the appearance of obscuration.  

It is enjoyed through the power of secrets.  

These two verses teach two topics, called "the little nail of the creative visual ization of the deity" and "the methodical precept of symbolic significance." Con cerning the first, "beauteous youth" characterizes the visualized deity whose body  is not of the coarse elements and is therefore free from the aging process. Because  there are no flaws owing to false imputations, the deity is beautiful. "That which  possesses its seed" is that which resembles it, has the potential to engender it,  that is to say, all beings of the six classes, who are thus pervaded by it, without  regard to class or status. Those of "best faculties," in this context, are those who  recognize the various forms of the deities to be the magical projection of mind,  the unique appearance of gnosis, but not an independently existing god. The  deity, pictured in the mind, is the body of rapture, whereas the unfabricated mind  itself is the body of reality. The two bodies of rapture and emanation, appearances  of that single gnosis, may appear as anything, ceaselessly. If you know this, the  creative visualization of the deity is mastered.  

Verse 20 then treats the second topic, "the methodical precept of symbolic  significance." Here, the sky and the mirror are symbols for the body of reality,  while clouds and reflections are indicative of the bodies of rapture and emanation.  Obscuration, or ignorance, serves no purpose with respect to the appearance of  these two bodies of the Buddha. To dispel such obscuration, the individual who  is cultivating the path must adhere to the appropriate Tantric vows, and thus the  result may be "enjoyed through the power of secrets."  

The Teachings of Tilopa  

The foregoing teachings hammer home the little nail of the creative visualization  of the deity, so that now the essential instructions, the little nail of the subtle  channels and vital energies, may be taught. The dakinis gave many instructions  on the channels and energies to the yaksini, but however much she practiced,  though her past pain was at once relieved, she became disturbed because she  could not achieve bliss. She then turned to Tilopa for further instruction.  

On the Vital Energies  

Tilopa's first teaching to her was this:  

21. The seal which clarifies gnosis 

KING KUNJl' S BANQUE T 67  

Is solely impressed on the vital points of the body.  

That apparitional machine  

Develops the force of the faculties.  

In respect to the clarification of gnosis, these paths are taught in the way of  secret mantras: there is the path which transforms the ground, so that by realizing  conceptual activity to be of the nature of gods and goddesses, the modalites of  gnosis are clarified in visualization practice; and there is the path of passion, which  is dissimilar in that it relies upon the seals, or vital points, of the body, and so  focuses upon the realization of the body's subtle channels and vital energies. Then  there is the path of liberation, which determines gnosis to be mere apparition,  and the great path of liberation, which determines that gnosis itself is not and  that this is no further gnosis, and that there are no afflictions or conceptualizations  and that this too is no further gnosis - it is like a flower in space.  

Now, then, what is "the seal which clarifies gnosis"? In this verse, this refers to  the Wild Woman, the inner heat that rises below the navel, relying upon which  the significance of gnosis comes clear. In cultivating it through exercises that make  use of the body's channels and energies, the body becomes like an apparitional  mechanism, developing the force of the sensory faculties. Tilopa added this  example:  

22. Like a banana tree,  

But with flesh, bone and marrow,  

Its growth is generated  

Just so by the channels and winds.  

Just as a banana tree, depending upon the growth of its roots, trunk, and so  on, finally produces its fruit, so in this case, it is the channels and energies within  a body of flesh and bone that give rise to the appearance of gnosis, the triple body  of enlightenment. Because that is the goal of the instruction on the body's vital  channels and energies, Tilopa then conferred his precepts on the ultimate view  and meditation upon it.  

On the Ultimate View  

He sang:  

23. In that which is causeless and without result,  

All is clearly revealed.  

There is no example, no designation.  

In what is without separation, what clarification is needed?  It is not generated by errancy or detour;  

Not straying, it is opposed to unmoving passivity.  

Natural, luminous gnosis is the final significance of the view. It is the skylike  body of reality, which is not engendered by any cause, and is therefore without  any result. Nevertheless, though not a causally compounded result, in its cease-

68 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

lessness the two resultant bodies of rapture and emanation are "clearly revealed."  And in its essential nature, the skylike radiant light of mind can neither be ex emplified nor designated.  

So, then, can no experience be cultivated of it?  

There is an experienceless cultivation of experience, meditationless meditation,  incessant absorption, a result that is never to be attained, but from which one is  never separated. Hence, "in what is without separation, what clarification is  needed"? It does not drift off in errancy, or wander into any detour, or stray into  apathy, or remain fixed should you seek to freeze it in immobility.  

On Integrating Radiant Light with the Apparitional Body  

The foregoing teaches the ultimate view of luminous gnosis. Its meditative cul tivation, so that its realization becomes inseparable, is taught in the remainder of  the text. Here, the view is that mind is radiant light, body is apparition, their  connection is revealed in dream and in the liminal passage from death to rebirth,  and the samadhi taught here is the transference of consciousness and the "pen etration of the city." The following verses emphasize these teachings, discussing  them in relation to five topics: liminal states, types of embodiment, potential  disclosure, intermingling of the teachings, and their relevant connections. The  first concerns the realization of radiant light during the liminal state between birth  and death, that is to say, during this lifetime.  

24. During the liminal passage from birth until death,  

With respect to conceptions of the body of karmic maturation,  Desire is purified in luminousness - 

This is the amazing instruction of the guru.  

The liminal passage from birth to death is the period during which all sorts of  conceptions become concretely manifest, so that one is embodied in the "body  of karmic maturation." But conceptual activity may be disclosed as luminous in  nature, and this luminosity in turn may be intermingled with the emotions and  passions, purifying them. How so? On the path of transformation one holds the  conceptions to be gods and goddesses, while on the path of desire one engenders  bliss while relying upon the subtle channels and fluids, and on the path of lib eration engenders bliss relying upon the Wild Woman; but here, on the path of  great liberation, one does not hanker after those sorts of bliss at all, but realizes  them to be luminous and so intermingles luminousness with passion. Owing to  what relevant connection may these teachings be realized? This is the amazing  instruction of the guru!  

On the Yogas of Dream and the Liminal Passage  

The yoga of the dream is to be mastered during this lifetime. It is summarized as  follows: 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 69  

25. There are the preliminaries and the main practice:  

[The latter includes] apprehension and refinement,  

Training in apparition, until one abandons fear,  

And meditation that does not step beyond the nature of reality.  

As for the preliminaries, the individual who embarks upon this path must not  be lacking in karmic propensities, or have violated the Tantric vows, or be without  merit, or be disrespectful to the guru; otherwise, he or she will not succeed in  grasping his or her dreams. For this reason, the preliminary practices are those  of repentance and purification, such as the hundred-syllable mantra, and devotion  and worship directed to the guru and the Three Precious Jewels.  

The main practice then has four parts: "apprehension," in which you learn to  grasp your dreams, to become aware when you are dreaming; "refinement,"  whereby you learn to transform your dreams, and to travel freely within them;  "training in apparition," through which you realize the truthlessness of dreams,  and so come to abandon all fears; and, finally, knowing that dreams are the  bewildering projections of mind, you apply your guru's instruction to whatever  thoughts arise, and so cultivate "meditation that does not step beyond the nature  of reality."  

This is to be practiced during this life, and pertains to the liminal passage of  the dream, which is described in this way:  

26. In the liminal passage of the transformations of consciousness,  One is impelled by the body of latent dispositions.  

The relevant preparation is actualized dreaming,  

Wherein ignorance is dissolved in radiant light.  

One applies oneself with fervent devotion.  

Of the five topics mentioned earlier [verse 24], the liminal passage is here that  of the dream, the body is that of latent dispositions, that which is to be disclosed  is the potentiality of dreaming, which is to be intermingled primarily with the  obscuration of ignorance as its antidote, while the relevant connection is formed  through mindfulness and fervent devotion. In sleep itself one comes to realize the  luminous nature of mind, so that sleep partakes of the essence of bliss and emp 

tiness, giving rise to the experience of radiant light.  

The liminal passage between death and rebirth, then, is taught in the following  verse:  

27. When this body of karmic ripening is destroyed,  

[There remains] the mental body, with its latent dispositions,  Desire should be disclosed as radiant light,  

And attachment to parents should be abandoned.  

Here, the liminal passage is the liminal passage of the possibilities of existence;  the body is the mental body; radiant light is to be disclosed and then intermingled  with the obscuration of aversion; and the relevant connection is formed by the 

7 0 MATTHE W T . KAPSTEI N  

potential parents who are thus abodes for rebirth, for which reason "attachment  to parents should be abandoned."  

The mental body, between death and rebirth, unhampered by the physical  body, is propelled by its confused dispositions. Those who have accumulated  positive dispositions through meritorious action may nevertheless recollect the  divine, or recall the true nature of things, and so be freed from the path of evil  destinies. As in the yoga of the dream, one should not be bewildered by incessant  apparitions, but attain instead the luminous body of reality.  

The Transference of Consciousness  

The foregoing verses have summarized the yogas of the dream, the liminal pas sage, apparition, and radiant light. Tilopa's final teachings concern samadhi, the  transference of consciousness and the "penetration of the city." In order to realize  these, one must cultivate mastery of the vital energies and radiant light, as indi cated below:  

28. Time, bodily exercise, and object of concentration - 

These are the first application.  

The essential point of the Wild Woman is said to be the four vital  winds,  

And these are explained as four radiant lights.  

At appropriate times, when the vital winds circulate through the central chan nel, one adopts the vajra posture as a bodily exercise, and concentrates upon the  movement of the energies in relation to the four cakras at the crown, throat, heart  and navel. The essential teaching of the inner heat, or the Wild Woman, then  stresses the fourfold control of the breath. When proficiency in the inner heat is  achieved by day, radiant light is grasped in four ways by night: there is the natural  radiant light, which is the purity of all phenomena; the meditational radiant light,  arising in the contemplative experience of the yogin in union with his consort;  the radiant light of sleep, when coarse mental activity comes to a halt in deep  sleep; and the radiant light of death, arising when, during the liminal passage,  the bodily elements are deceased.  

29. In general, the transference of consciousness, a special form of yogic exer cise, is said to cause the consciousness of the dying individual to depart suddenly  from the body through a forced opening at the crown of the skull, and to travel  immediately to a pure land, often the Sukhavati [the "Pure" or "Happy Land"]  realm of the Buddha Amitabha, in which enlightenment can then be swiftly at tained. The "penetration of the city" is an especially high-powered version of this,  permitting one to project one's consciousness into the recently deceased corpse  of another. The yaksini to whom Tilopa taught this technique soon achieved  mastery of it, taking possession in this way of the body of the yogini Sumati.  According to Tibetan tradition, the actual technique was lost not long after it was 

KING KUNJI' S BANQUE T 71  

transmitted in Tibet during the eleventh century, and it has not been successfully  practiced since. The yoga of the transference of consciousness, however, remains  a fundamental practice of Tibetan Buddhism, and is widely practiced in connec tion with Tibetan funeral rites.  

The verses in passage 29 in which The Garland of Gems discusses these tech niques are, unfortunately, almost indecipherable and even the commentary fails  to clarify the text at this point. For this reason these verses are left untranslated  here. Perhaps one who prays earnestly to the eighty-four Siddhas will once again  encounter the two dakinis, and so come to recover this passage from the heaven  of manifest delight.  

Concluding Dedication  

30. May the full realization of the entire teaching,  

Bestowed for the sake of the yaksini,  

And well practiced by Dhamadhuma,  

Bring all creatures to the stage of perfection!  

The small text of the instructions of The Garland of Gems is now concluded.
