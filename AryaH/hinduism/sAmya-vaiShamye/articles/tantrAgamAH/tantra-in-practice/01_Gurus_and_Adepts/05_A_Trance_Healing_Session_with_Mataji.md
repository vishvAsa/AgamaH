Bimla Devi, or Passu Mataji (Respected Mother from village Passu) as she is called  by her clients and devotees, is a female trance healer living in a village near  Dharamsala, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh. She is regularly possessed by the  Hindu Goddess Vaisno Devi. Mataji maintains a small temple attached to her  home, where three days a week she goes into trance and, as the Goddess Vaisno  Devi, answers questions and offers cures for people. Those who come, mostly  women, consult her for a variety of problems including mental and physical  health, family relationships, employment, and spiritual concerns.  

Possession by many types of deities and spirits, benevolent and malevolent, is  widespread among women and men throughout South Asia. Divine possession  by goddesses, primarily among women, is prevalent in the northwest part of India,  which includes Kangra, as well as in some other areas. The Sakti or divine power  of the goddess enters into (or "plays," khelti hai) and temporarily blots out the  consciousness of the human medium. While in this possession trance, the me 

dium speaks with the voice of the goddess. Afterward, most people, like Mataji,  have no memory of what they said in trance, and they return to their "normal"  state of consciousness. By word of mouth, these women begin to attract followers  who come to them for help with problems and address them as Mataji, a term  that not only means "mother" in the ordinary sense, but also "goddess." There is  a transformation that takes place through repeated possession, such that the  woman becomes more and more "goddess-like," more and more divinized. Some  of these Matajis have adopted a renunciant lifestyle and have become gurus in a  broader sense, teaching meditation to their devotees, building ashrams, and giving  discourses on bhakti (devotion) and other spiritual paths.  

I learned the details of Passu Mataji's life, a sketch of which I give here, from  her and some of her devotees. She was born around the time of Indian indepen dence (1947), the youngest of six children to an impoverished family of the  Giraths, a low-caste cultivating community of Kangra. She has no formal educa tion and has never learned to read or write. As a child, she never played with

other village children but only with another little girl who was always with her,  but whom only she could see. When she told her mother about this little girl,  her mother became concerned and brought her to a healer, a harijan (untouchable  caste member) who made "tantra-mantra" on her and gave her holy water and  cardamon. After that, she "went crazy," and a wandering holy man came by her  house, saying that the Goddess had wanted to come there, but that it was con 

taminated. Her parents arranged a marriage for her when she was very young and  tried to send her off to her husband's home at about age twelve. When she was  placed in the palanquin, the Goddess entered into her and said, "don't go there.  Stay here and build a temple for me." She followed the Goddess's order and some  years later, again ordered by the Goddess, moved her temple and residence to its  present location in another village. She never married again, and characterizes  herself as "not a householder," though she does maintain a household and has  brought up several relatives' children. She is also active in the local women's  organization.  

In practical terms, Tantra has as much to do with the fulfillment of mundane  desires as with soteriological aims. The powers gained through Tantric practice  can be used for both worldly (bhukti) and spiritual (mukti) purposes. In the non dualist ontology of Tantra, these two are part of the same reality. Mataji and her  devotees are part of a broadly based grassroots religious expression, a kind of  "folk Tantra" that connects the more formal textual and esoteric Tantric traditions  with exoteric village religion.  

I present below a transcription, with a few explanatory comments, of a trance  session I recorded during field work in 1997. The original language was primarily  Hindi with some Punjabi and the local Kangri dialect, with an occasional English  word thrown in. I have not attempted to show this mix of languages in my  translation. Indian languages allow for a much greater degree of ellipsis than is  possible in English. Indirect constructions, omission of subjects and/or objects,  gender-neutral pronouns, interchangeability of singular and plural in colloquial  speech, all contribute to a discourse of vagueness that is highly appropriate to a  trance session in which information of a personal and often delicate nature is  being conveyed to devotees in a public arena where it can be overheard by ev eryone present. In my translation, I have preserved as much of this ambiguity as  English usage will allow. Mataji's linguistic register is at times highly colloquial,  at times highly formal. In order to give some sense of the flow of language in the  performance context, I have purposely not deleted the frequent repetition of stock  phrases and formulas in Mataji's trance speech. Typically, she will describe the  problem, tell the cause, prescribe a remedy, and predict the outcome. Mataji, like  other healers in the area, focuses on a personal object, such as an item of clothing  or jewelry, that belongs to the person seeking help and that is placed in front of  her at the start of the session. The reader will note that Mataji's diagnoses fall into  several categories, including sorcery (jadu tona, opari), the evil eye (nazar), and  astrological influences (graha) such as that of the inauspicious planet Saturn  (Sani), whose day, as in the West, falls on Saturday. In the case of sorcery, she 

TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 99  

will never pinpoint the evildoer by name but will answer questions concerning  gender, caste, place of residence, and status within the family. The three most  common cures are cardamon seeds, holy water, and threads of three, five, or  seven colors (or sometimes plain black). When eaten or worn, these simple  blessed items carry the Goddess's Sakti (power) and function as amulets to neu 

tralize negative forces and protect against further harm. Other cures include mak ing donations, offerings to a deity, or the performance of specific rituals.

A Trance Healing Session with Mataji  

It was a chilly Sunday morning in February 1997. By eleven o'clock, about a  dozen people were seated on the veranda outside the temple. This number would  gradually swell to over fifty, as people continued to drift in. Because it was a  holiday, there were more men present than there would have been on a weekday,  about one-third of the total, and more school-age children. The devotees ranged  from Dharamsala professionals to landless laborers from neighboring villages. The  temple door was open, exposing the red-clad and garland-bedecked image of  goddess Vaisno Devi. As devotees arrived, they would wash their hands at the 

100 KATHLEE N M . ERND L  

nearby tap, approach the Goddess with folded hands, and bow in front of her.  After a few minutes, Mataji emerged from an adjacent building, wearing an or ange-red flowered salwar-kameez, red shawl, and a red stocking cap on her head.  She greeted me, as well as a middle-aged man who went inside with her. She  called me in a few minutes later to sit next to her. She said something about a  tape recorder. I had been there several times before without recording anything  and asked if this time I could use it. Both she and the man readily agreed. I said  that if anyone objected, I would turn it off. The man said no one minded. But I  said that since people were asking personal things, that if someone objected, I  would turn it off while that person was there. Mataji agreed, but, in fact, no one  seemed to mind. The people outside, who had been sitting in a line along the  wall, turned and sat lined up in rows facing the temple. Mataji started out by  leading a devotional song to the Goddess, after asking someone outside to bring  the dholak (a drum) and chaine (a tong-like percussion instrument) from inside  the house. People from the congregation had already placed their "question" items  and offerings of money on the floor in front of her. Those who came later entered  the temple, touched her feet, placed their things in front of her, and took a seat  outside. The congregation sang several devotional songs, a few of which are trans lated below, for about half an hour, after which Mataji gradually went into trance,  her head and body shaking to the beat of the music.  

Song (repeated many times)  

Give us darsan, Vaisno Mata  

The whole congregation has come  

With cries of "Victory," we have come  

Give us darsan, Vaisno Mata  

Mataji begins "playing," her body shaking in time with the music, her hair flying  around her face, her eyes glazed over. The devotees sing a new song, welcoming  the appearance of the Goddess.  

Song (repeated many times)  

Riding on a yellow lion,  

Look, the Mother-Queen has come.  

O, Mother we've built a temple for you  

We wave the chowrie before you.  

Look, the Mother-Queen has come  

The Lion-rider has come  

The Gracious One has come.  

The five Pandavas built a temple

Look, the Lion-rider has come

A saffron mark adorning her brow  

Look, the Mother-Queen has come  

Riding on a yellow lion, the Queen-Mother has come  

The Flame One has come.  

O Mother, we offer betel leaf and nut, flags, coconuts, and songs.  Look, the Mother-Queen has come  

The Gracious One has come  

My Mother has come.  

Song (repeated many times)  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Now she's come, the Gracious One  

Now she's come, the Gracious One  

Get darsan now, devotees  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Now she's come, the Lion-rider  

Say: Victory to the true court!  

Mataji, still in trance, stops shaking and begins to speak. The singing stops im mediately. She is now fully possessed by the Goddess and signals her presence  by saying something that sounds like jay kares, jay karakand," a phrase that no  one, including her close devotees and Mataji herself, could decode beyond the  word jay, which means victory and is part of such slogans as "victory to the  Mother." I have translated this utterance, which punctuates all of Mataji's trance talk simply as "victory." She will point out one by one the items devotees have  placed in front of her, make the diagnosis, and prescribe the remedy, until all the  questions have been answered. Each devotee approaches Mataji in turn when her  or his item has been selected, touches her feet, engages in a brief verbal exchange,  then steps away. Each will return at the end of the session to receive the blessed  articles that Mataji has prescribed as remedies. The middle-aged man, referred to  below as her "Helper" steps in from time to time to pick up the items and call  devotees inside.  

QUESTION ONE  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Devotees, for I have come. Victory! The one with the  red cloth is here to ask . . . 

102 KATHLEE N M. ERND L  

Helper: Whose red cloth is this?  

Woman: It's mine, Ji.  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Victory! Devotees, you want to ask about your dis tress.  

Woman: Yes,JT.  

Mataji: Victory! Because you want to ask, "Why is there this distress; what is  the matter?"  

Woman: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, you have already been to doctors. Even so, there  has been no improvement. Therefore, you want to ask, "Why is it like this?  What is the reason? Is it my own fault or is it someone else's doing?"  Woman: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Victory, victory, O devotees, victory! There's pain in your head. Vic tory! Pain in your stomach. Victory! Your body feels as though someone has  beaten it. You don't feel like eating. You don't even feel like talking to any one. You think, "I should leave everything and go off somewhere. I should  just go and sit somewhere alone." For this reason, you want to ask, "Why is  this? What's the reason? Is it my own fault, or is it someone else's doing?"  Woman: Yes,JI.  

Mataji: Victory! Innocent daughter, this is a mighty enemy's doing. Because  of this, you have already wasted your time in so many doctors' houses. Even  so, there has been no cure. For this, take a five-colored string, cardamon,  and holy water. It's the enemy's might! It was fed to you in your food. The  one who fed you is a widow. Victory! Next question . . .  

QUESTION 2  

Mataji: Victory! The cloth in the middle . . .  

Helper: This one? {picking up one of several pieces of clothing]  Mataji: In front of it; the second one you lifted up.  

Helper: This one? Whose is this? [A man steps forward and touches Mataji's  feet]  

Mataji: Victory! Have you come to ask about your distress?  Man: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent son, how much distress have you borne for three years? In nocent son, you have already wasted time in so many doctors' houses. There  is pain in your chest. Victory! It is also as if a load has fallen on your mind.  You don't ever feel like talking with anyone. You don't even feel like eating  your food. Your heart says, "I should leave everything and go off somewhere  and sit alone." For this reason, you want to ask, "Why is this? What is the  reason? Is it my own fault or someone else's doing?" Innocent son, there  had also been a quarrel over property.  

Man: How many years ago, Ma?  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Innocent son, five years have passed. 

TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 103  

Man: Five years?  

Mataji: Why not? Victory! For this, innocent son . . . Victory! The one who  did it is a woman. The one who made and brought it is a man. This deed  has been done by those of low caste. For this take cardamon, holy water,  and a seven-colored thread.  

Man: All right, but how much longer will the illness last now?  Mataji: Victory! Innocent son, if you keep devotion, then within a year there  will be benefit. . . . Next question; the yellow cloth over there . . .  

QUESTION 3  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! Innocent son, you want to ask about your health.  Man: Yes, Ji, Mataji.  

Mataji: Innocent son, you want to ask why you are having difficulty with your  health.  

Man: Yes, Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent son, the reason is . . . Victory! It's because the one who did  it has put you through an ordeal.  

Man: Is the one who did it one of us [a relative] or an outsider?  Mataji: Victory! It's an outsider, not a relative.  

Man: Is it someone from here or from back there?  

Mataji: Victory! Someone from back there, not from here.  

Man: What's the cure, now?  

Mataji: Innocent son, for this, take some cardamon, and you can drink holy  water.  

Man: Mataji, will there be any happy outcome from this?  

Mataji: Innocent son, why not? But you must first reap some impure fruit.  Man: All right, Mataji, whatever has happened to me, has it born fruit yet?  Mataji: Innocent son, it is best.  

Man: Mataji, will there be good fortune?  

Mataji: Why not? After this is over, you will definitely benefit. Victory! Vic tory! Next question . . . The handkerchief. . .  

QUESTION 4  

Helper: Whose handkerchief is this?  

Mataji: The one you started to pick up . . . Victory! Victory! Victory! Have  you come to ask about your health?  

Woman: Mataji, it's not myself I'm asking about.  

Mataji: You're asking about someone else. You've come asking about health  and work. Why are you troubled?  

Woman: Mataji, it's about my child. It's about his studies.  

Mataji: Why are you troubled? What is the matter?  

Woman: He can't focus his mind. 

104 KATHLEEN M. ERNDL  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, I am Kanyakumarl, the Virgin Goddess. I can figure  it out for myself. Victory! How much trouble he's gotten into! Innocent  daughter, he embraces knowledge then breaks away from it. Now he doesn't  even want to look at it.  

Woman: Yes, Mataji, it's just like that.  

Mataji: Victory! Sometimes he feels like this: "I'll leave everyone and go and  sit alone."  

Woman: Yes, that's it, Mataji.  

Mataji: Darkness has come over his eyes. So, you want to ask, "Why is this  happening? Is it our fault, or is it someone else's doing?" Victory!  Woman: Victory to the Mother!  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, the reason for this is the action of a mighty enemy.  Woman: Mataji, he's quarrelsome . . .  

Mataji: He's been uprooted from knowledge. For this, give him cardamon, holy  water, and a three-color thread. And, innocent daughter, make a book do nation on Tuesday.  

Woman: To whom, Mataji?  

Mataji: To anyone.  

Another Woman: To anyone. Give a book to a child or to a poor person on a  Tuesday during the month of Jyestha [May-June] or any Tuesday.  Mataji: Any Tuesday of any month. Victory! Take a three-color thread, car damon, and holy water. Victory!  

Woman: All right, Mataji, very well.

QUESTION 5  

Helper: Whose is this?  

Mataji: Victory, victory, victory! Do you want to ask about your health?  Woman: Yes,Ji, Mataji.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, your legs are numb and as if lifeless.  Woman: Yes,JI, Mataji.  

Mataji: Sometimes you can't even tell if they're on the ground or in the sky.  Because of this, you want to ask, "Why does this happen? What's the matter?"  Woman: Mataji, the pain is terrible.  

Mataji: Victory! Sometimes when you put your foot on the ground, it feels as  is your leg is breaking, the right leg.  

Woman: Yes, Mataji.  

Mataji: Victory, victory! Below the knee, there is a lot of pain. Innocent daugh ter, the reason is the bonds of karma pressing down on you. For this, take  a black-colored thread. You'll get happiness.  

Woman: Mataji, will my legs get better?  

Mataji: Take some pure oil, put on the thread, then after eight days, apply the  oil. 

TRANCE HEALIN G SESSIO N 105  

Woman: All right, Mataji.  

Mataji. Victory! Victory! In front there is a white-stoned ring.

Mataji: The one farthest in front, on this side.  

QUESTION 7  

Mataji: Victory! This is a question about a man.  

Woman: Yes,JI.  

Mataji: You want to ask about your man's distress. And you want to ask, "Why  is this distress occurring? What is the matter? Is it our fault or someone  else's doing?" Victory! Innocent daughter, victory! Because it has gotten to  the point that he doesn't even feel comfortable at home.  

Woman: Yes, Ji.  

Mataji: When he comes into the house, it's obvious that he wants to go away.  And it's as if the people at home are enemies. But he'll sit and talk with  outsiders in a friendly way, as though they were family. Therefore, you want  to ask, "Why is this happening? Is it one's own fault or someone else's do 

ing?" Innocent daughter, this is a mighty enemy's doing. For this, take some  cardamon. Victory! In the back, there is a cloth . . .  

QUESTION 8  

Mataji: Victory! It's a question about a boy. You want to ask about his future.  Man: Yes, Ji, Mataji. He doesn't focus his mind on his studies.  Mataji: Victory! Innocent son, with him it's, "If it's to be done today, then I'll  

do it tomorrow. If it's to be done tomorrow, then the following morning."  That's the way it is with him these days. Therefore, you want to ask, "Why  is this going on with him? What is the reason? Is it one's own fault, or is it  someone else's doing?" Innocent son, the reason for this is that it's a mighty  enemy's doing.  

Man: Where is he from?  

Mataji: Innocent son, someone has passed his hand over the boy's head. The  one who has passed his hand lives nearby and is of a different caste. For106 KATHLEE N M . ERND L

Mataji: Victory! Therefore you want to ask, "Now I'm running forward; will I  reach my goal or not?" Innocent son, the influence of Saturn [Sani] has come  over you. An astrological influence has come over you. For Sani you should  donate something black, however much you can afford without difficulty,  and innocent son, within eleven months you'll reach your goal.

Innocent son, she doesn't feel like  talking. She doesn't feel like eating her food. Sometimes her heart tells her,  "I'll leave everything and go off somewhere. I'll sit alone." Therefore you  want to ask, "Why is this happening? What is the reason? Is it one's own  fault, or is it someone else's doing?" Innocent son, she went into the garden  to pick some flowers. Innocent son, someone put something into her food,  into her corn bread and wheat bread. For this, definitely give her cardamon  and holy water. .. . A torn handkerchief in front. . .  

Helper: Whose handkerchief is this?

[An adolescent girl steps forward.]  

Mataji: Victory! You want to ask about your future. You also want to ask . . .  Victory .. . if in the future your karma will be bright or not and if you'll be  rid of obstacles or not. Victory! Innocent daughter, it will take some time,  but you will have good fortune. Victory! Definitely offer a libation to the  Sun of water mixed with red sandalwood paste. Innocent daughter, your  mind is fixed less on knowledge, and more on useless things. It's the plight 

TRANCE HEALING SESSION 107  

brought on by the astrological influence of the Sun. Offer a libation to the  Sun, along with sesame, rice, and red sandalwood.  

Girl: Has the enemy's influence ended?  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, why not? Now there is some change from your  previous state.  

Girl: Now it is time for exams, and I can't focus my mind on studying.  Mataji: Innocent daughter, you will have good fortune, but you have to keep  discipline for some days. . . . Now the next question .. . in front there is a  red-stoned ring . . .  

QUESTION 12  

Mataji: Victory! You want to ask about your health. You want to ask, "Why  am I experiencing distress? What's the matter?" Innocent daughter, some times you don't even feel like talking.

Woman: Yes, Ji.  

Mataji: Victory! You don't feel like talking and neither do you feel like eating.  Innocent daughter, you have given up eating, and you won't even touch  food.

Sometimes there's no pain at all. Innocent  daughter, because of this you want to ask, "Why is this happening?" Innocent  daughter, a mighty enemy is the cause of this. Because you have had a new  residence built for yourself. Innocent daughter, you have had a very beautiful  residence built. For this very reason, they turn on those who become great.  They turn on those who become fortunate. They think, "We'll grind them  to dust." For this, take cardamon, holy water . . .  

Woman: Who is it?  

Mataji: He's of your own caste. He has quarreled with you also.  Woman: Mataji, will we be all right?

108 KATHLEEN M. ERNDL  

Last year, too, you profited well. Did you or didn't you? Innocent daughter,  what lies ahead is also good.  

This watch belongs to the author, who placed it there before the session began.  She is a scholar who has come to study Mataji, her devotees, and her practices,  and is consulting Mataji concerning the success of her research project. She re mains silent and simply nods in response to Mataji's questions. At this point in  their acquaintance, she has told Mataji very little about herself except that she is  a university professor and has certainly not mentioned the fact that the previous  year was a good one professionally.  

Mataji: Victory! Victory! There's a white handkerchief in the back.

Woman: Mata, does the enemy have a job, or is he in business?  Mataji: He has his own business, not a job. Innocent daughter, she'll be all  right soon. I protect my devotees who are attached to me. I become their  servant and protect them. Victory! Victory! Next question .. . In the back  there's a bangle.  

QUESTION 15  

Mataji: Victory! Innocent daughter, you want to ask about your health. You  want to ask, "Why am I having problems with my health?" Innocent daugh ter, how much trouble you've borne. Innocent daughter, both of your arms  have broken. Victory! Your body has become leaden. You don't even feel  like talking. You don't feel like eating. Innocent daughter, your whole body  feels numb. It feels heavy. Sometimes it feels as though it is bound in a  noose.  

Woman: Yes,Ji.  

Mataji: Innocent daughter, you have been taking medicine, too. Even so, there  is no difference. Sometimes, peace comes by itself. Other times the pain  increases by itself. Therefore, you want to ask, "Is this my fault or someone  else's?" Innocent daughter, this is caused by a mighty enemy. For this take

She smiles at those  around her and begins to greet the devotees who have lined up outside. She  knows many by name and inquires about their family members. One by one they  come into the temple to collect the items she has prescribed. She dispenses the  cardamon seeds in small newspaper-wrapped packets and cuts the threads in  neck-length sizes. The holy water, which earlier in the day has bathed the stone  Goddess image, has collected in a small chamber underneath. Mataji scoops up  some of this water, mixing it into a bucket of tap water. She then taps it with a  flower while reciting a mantra under her breath. At Mataji's direction, the helper  uses this water to fill containers that devotees have brought. Mataji distributes  prasad (consecrated offerings) of candies or bananas to everyone. Some of the  devotees circumambulate her temple or visit the adjacent temple to Lord Siva.
