The importance accorded to the spiritual master, the guru or acarya, was a general  characteristic of Indian culture from very early times, and the trait was developed  and intensified in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism. It goes back to the Vedic  period and is still visible in India today.  

A reason for the guru's importance may lie in the fact that Indian traditions  always gave precedence to the oral/aural/verbal, rather than to the written, form  of religious or spiritual teachings. The Vedic Revelation is not scripture. It is sruti,  that which has been heard and which is transmitted by word of mouth. The  Buddha and the Jina taught orally, and their teaching was long committed to  memory only. The various Tantric doctrines, though they seem to have been  written down early (by the fifth or sixth century C.E., perhaps, for Hindu Tantras,  earlier for the Buddhist ones), were also deemed to have been revealed - that is,  told, orally expressed - by a deity to a first master and then transmitted in the  same oral fashion to initiates alone, through a succession of masters (gurupar amparya), to succeeding generations of believers or adepts. Tantric texts that  embody this sort of teaching in writing are therefore often couched in the form  of a dialogue between a deity and a mortal, or between two deities speaking in  mythical times - one asking to be taught, the other revealing orally his/her teach ing.  

In this Indian context, the highest wisdom, liberating truth, can issue only from  the mouth of the master: gurumukhad eva. All such teaching, moreover, is nec essarily esoteric. It is given, orally, only to those whom the guru considers worthy  of receiving it and capable of keeping it secret. The esoteric transmission of doc trine by the guru to his chosen disciple includes the (necessarily oral) transmission  of a mantra that is believed to be all-powerful, superhuman in nature: only some one endowed with superhuman powers can have access to and transmit such a  power. This is a further reason why the Tantric guru is regarded as divine.  Tantric texts often do not expressly state that the guru is divine. They take it

for granted, so obvious is such a notion to them. This identification with the deity  goes so far that in some cases it is not clear whether the Tantra refers to the master  or to the deity. For example, there is a passage in the Yoginihrdaya (a Saiva text  dating probably from the tenth or eleventh century C.E., but still read and used  in Srividya circles today) which exhorts the adept to invoke and perceive mentally  in one of the centers (cakras) of his "subtle" imaginary body the presence of the  "footprints or sandals of the Master" (gurupadukas); these, says the text, "pervade  the universe and fill it with celestial ambrosia," that is, with bliss. Now, the com mentary explains this paduka to be that of the guru, but it goes on to quote a  stanza that mentions only the deity, while alluding further on to the paduka of  "the guru whose nature is that of the supreme Siva." To realize mystically the  supreme nature of the gurupaduka, says the Yoginihrdaya, is also to realize one's  total identity with the supreme deity. What the adept is to experience is thus both  the spiritual presence in his heart of his guru and the presence of the deity: they  are both there but as one and the same, both transcendant and immanent reality.  As appears in the translation given below of excerpts from the Kularnavatantra,  this is what is generally implied by the term paduka.  

Admittedly, the Yoginihrdaya belongs doctrinally to the nondualistic form of  Saivism for which the supreme godhead forms the essence and omnipresent sub strate of the cosmos, a divine essence that pervades the guru as well. However, it  goes further than that. For this Tantric text (as for many others) there is a real,  active, all-powerful and grace-bestowing presence of the deity existing in, or rather  as, the guru. He has to be divine because in spiritual matters one gives not so  much what one has as what one is.  

The reverence and respect paid to the guru are reflected in the fact that Tantric  ritual worship usually begins by an invocation of the guru (gurusmarana) by which  the worshiper places him/herself mentally within his/her own tradition: rather  than one's own guru, it is the succession of the gurus of one's tradition, the  guruparamparya or gurupahkti, which is thus made spiritually present.  

In the Saiva Kaula traditions, this gurupahkti is sometimes described as con sisting of a threefold succession or "flow" (ogha) of masters, the first group being  "divine" (divya), the second "accomplished" (siddha) and the last "human" (man ova). If not historically then at least mythically, this flow links all the succeding  gurus to the supreme godhead by whom the tradition is supposed to have been  originally revealed. In this threefold succession (sometimes considered to corre spond to the yugas, the succeeding ages of the world), the gurus are progressively  less perfect as they pass from a divine to a mere human condition. However, even  human gurus are incarnations of the godhead and are to be worshiped as such  by their disciples.  

Tantric traditions are not alone in viewing the guru as divine. It could be said  that Indian gurus of whatever persuasion, and whether living in the past or the  present, are regarded by their disciples as divine. A well-known and remarkable  non-Tantric instance of such divinization is that of Caitanya, who came to be  regarded as an androgynous incarnation of Radha and Krsna. It is well known 

T HE TANTRI C GURU 43  

that Ananda Moyi, who died a few years ago, used to be worshiped in Varanasi  as an incarnation of the goddess Durga. More curious is the case of Sobha Ma,  who lives in Varanasi now, and who is considered by her disciples as a manifes tation of the (Tantric) goddess Kali. But once a year, she is worshiped by them  as an incarnation of the non-Tantric god Krsna. One is also tempted to refer to  the famous Bengali guru Ramakrsna, who came from a Tantric milieu, was a priest  of Kali, and was initiated by two Tantric ascetics. But he stopped halfway, lacking  the will to act as a real tantrika. Such instances (and many others could be quoted)  are clearly due to the diffusion, throughout India, of the Tantric conception of  the guru. As a well-known stanza from the Kularnavatantra (12.45) puts it, "Who 

ever regards the guru as a human being, the mantra as mere letters, and the images  [of deities] as stone, goes to hell." The proper attitude toward the guru is sum marized by another oft-quoted stanza from the same text (12.49): "The guru is  the father, the guru is the mother, the guru is God, the supreme Lord. When Siva  is angry, the guru saves [from his wrath]. When the guru is angry, nobody [can  help]." Many such quotations could be cited. The Tantrarajatantra (The King of  All Tantras), an undated - perhaps seventeenth-century - text belonging to the  Srividya tradition, includes in its first chapter a brief hymn to the guru, identifying  him with different aspects of the deity or of the cosmos; the human condition  appears to be utterly transcended.  

A richer and more detailed description of the Tantric guru is that of the twelfth  chapter (ullasa), "concerning the footprints [of the guru]," of the Kularnavatantra.  This Saiva Tantra is an important text of the Kaula tradition, and one of the best  known. Its date is unknown, but it is certainly earlier than the fifteenth century.  It was edited by Arthur Avalon and commented upon by him. The chapter in  question, 129 stanzas in length, is too long to be translated here in its entirety.  But the excerpts below show how far the extolling of the guru can go. Excessive  praise is of course an ancient Indian literary practice, and it was never to be taken  literally. But in its excess the Kularnavatantra expresses a widespread, typically  Tantric perception of the spiritual master. The eulogy is reinforced in the following  chapter of the same text, all 133 stanzas of which deal with the qualities, good  or bad, of the guru and of the disciple. It describes especially the traits a disciple  must exhibit in order for him to be chosen and then to serve his master properly:  absolute devotion and submission are the rule.  

Considered to be drvine, deserving of praise, and treated as a deity, the Tantric  guru is naturally a figure to be worshiped. Indeed, a gurupuja, ritual worship of  the guru, is sometimes prescribed. It is to be carried out by the newly initiated  disciple for the master who has initiated him, and by the newly consecrated acarya  for the master who has consecrated him and whom he is to succeed. The puja  may consist of a mere recitation (japa) of the gurumantra, which is sometimes a  long formula, and sometimes simply Om Om sri gurave namah. Whether short or  long, the gurumantra, when its japa is completed, is to be "offered" by the per former of the rite and symbolically placed in the guru's right hand. This is pre 

scribed in all Tantric cults for the final japa of the deity's mantra. This rite is 

44 ANDRE PADOU X  

interesting as a symbolic offering both of one's prayer and of oneself to the god head - or to the guru.  

The gurupuja may also be a complete ritual program during which the guru,  seated on a throne (asana) that symbolizes the whole cosmos (which he is thus  deemed to transcend), is worshiped "with his mantras" and with the same offer ings as those made to a deity, with the remainder of the offered drinks or food  then being consumed (as in any puja) by the disciple, who must also worship the  "wheel of power" (sakticakra) presumed to encircle the guru. If all this is not done,  it is said, the whole initiation ritual would be void and without effect.  

Such being the divine nature ascribed to the Tantric guru and the worship  shown him, we would expect him to appear mysteriously, as a supernatural being  spontaneously endowed with all manner of perfections and uncommon powers.  But in fact only the founding masters of Tantric traditions, Hindu or Buddhist,  are ever described in such a way. This is often the case with the Siddhas. Well 

known examples are those of Matsyendranatha and Goraksanatha, the mythical  founders of the Natha tradition. On the other hand, whenever human rather than  mythical gurus are concerned, Tantric texts carefully describe and emphasize the  necessity of their ritual initiation (diksa) or consecration (abhiseka). The guru,  though essentially divine, is a human person who in fact becomes divine only  after a ritual empowerment by which his master transmits to him his own super 

natural excellence, together with his spiritual powers and ritual qualifications.  There is such a thing as the "making of a master" (acaryakaranam).  As a rule the acarya- (or guru-) diksa or abhiseka is the highest in a series of  initiations and is therefore given only to persons who have already received lesser  initiations. To become a guru one must, in addition, have a number of social,  physical, and mental qualities. These vary according to the doctrines, preferences,  or prejudices of the different Tantric traditions. They concern caste (often the  guru must be a brahman, he must at least be of good family, a kulin), gender  (usually only males can be gurus), family (a guru is normally married), knowledge  of the scriptures (the Sastras) and the ability to explain them, and so forth. Texts  often insist on the beauty, majestic appearance, deep voice, and other physical  traits a guru ought to possess. Some Tantras say a good guru cannot come from  certain parts of India. The thirteenth chapter of the Kuldrnavatantra mentions  different kinds of guru, with different capacities and different ways of teaching  and practicing different rituals. It lists the particular subjects with which a guru  ought to be conversant. It also mentions and warns against bad gurus. Only the  sadguru, the real guru, the embodiment of absolute truth, saves and is to be  worshiped. All of this goes to show that though extolled as divine, the Tantric  guru is also viewed a mere mortal who is not above human frailties. A point worth  noting is that the guru takes over his office and his powers from the master, who  initiates him and thereby transfers and relinquishes to him his own role and  authority. According to the Mrgendrdgama, the initiating master says to his suc cessor: "The power and authority I resign to you now, you will henceforth wield  until you transmit them to another." The rule is that there are never two masters  officially active at the same time in the same guruparamparya.

The importance thus attributed to ritual notions and practices should not come  as a surprise. The Tantric world is permeated and fundamentally characterized  by ritual. Contrary to what some believe, tantrikas are not antiritualists or trans gressive mystical seekers of supernatural powers and liberation. They are first and  foremost super-ritualists, "specialists in intensified ritual." Ritual, however, cannot  be separated from the doctrine that accompanies and justifies it: in the case of  Hindu Tantra, the prevailing ideology is that of the pervasive presence of divine  power, sakti, a power conceived of differently in different Tantric systems, but  one that can be mastered and deployed ritually to gain mundane or supramun 

dane ends. These two aspects of the Tantric reality come together in the acary abhiseka, in which the guru is spiritually consecrated and is invested (thanks to  the mantras he ritually receives) with supernatural powers, powers of such inten sity that he is divinized.  

Some Tantric traditions, notably the dualist Saiva Siddhanta whose scriptures  are the Sanskrit Agamas, insist on the absolute and total efficacy of ritual. Such  is also the position of the Vaisnava tradition of the Pancaratra, despite the im portance given there to devotion to the Lord. Others, notably the nondualist  Saivas, consider that the principal element in the making of a guru is not the  ritual of the diksa, but rather the divine influx of power: the grace of God (anu graha) or the "descent of power" (saktipata).  

Thus, the Kashmiri philosopher Abhinavagupta (tenth to eleventh century)  contrasts the ritually initiated, "fabricated" (kalpita) gurus with those who are "not  fabricated" (akalpita) but spontaneously and directly illuminated (and hence ini tiated) by Siva's grace. This is a position, Abhinavagupta says, that was already  held by such earlier Tantras as the Brahmayamala and even of Agamas such  as the Kiranagama. The highest guru, according to him, is the one called "spon taneous" (svayambhu) because he is spontaneously and divinely schooled in all  the traditional sciences. Such a master is absolutely perfect (samsiddhika), omnis cient, and divine; he destroys ignorance and spreads bliss by his mere presence.  Illuminated by the light of intuitive knowledge (pratibham jnanam), he is some times called pratibhaguru. This guru, Abhinavagupta explains, is in fact initiated  by the "goddesses of his own consciousness" (svasamvittidevibhir diksitah). This  is interesting, since it identifies the powers and movements that sustain and an imate a person's spiritual, mental, and physical life with divine entities. This  perception of one's powers as identical with, or reflecting, a set of deities (the  Kalis), this conception of these "goddesses as the blissful, uncontracted awareness  which is within and behind one's individuality" (to quote Alexis Sanderson), was  taken over by Abhinavagupta from the Kashmiri form of the ancient Saiva Krama  tradition.  

An akalpitaguru, according to him, may also be ritually initiated, in particular  so as to learn (and be able to teach) certain doctrines or practices. He is then said  to be an akalpitakalpita ("fabricated and not-fabricated") guru. Such a master,  says Abhinavagupta, is really the god Bhairava. Continually deepening his perfect  knowledge of all the Tantras and religious treatises, following the teaching of his  own Master but also remaining constantly immersed in the light of divine Con-46 ANDRE PADOUX  

sciousness, he reaches such a degree of plenitude (purnata) that he is identified  with Bhairava, that fearsome form of Siva. The Brahmayamalatantra further  teaches that a person can be initiated and enlightened (that is, liberated) thanks  only to the effulgence or power (sphuratta) of a mantra. By means of this method,  says the Tantra, one may become an acarya in a month. This may be taken as yet  another example of the power ascribed to mantras in Tantric Hinduism. But the  Tantra explains that this sort of direct mantric initiation is obtained while one  performs a particular ritual of worship of the goddess Rakta: "Raktadevi initiates  progressively through the japa of her mantras. This however can be done only if  one has found such a guru as can transmit the mantra." Even divine action some times needs the help of human power. Here, however, the idea is to exclude the  possibility of obtaining a mantra by finding it for oneself in a text: a written  mantra, as is well known, is powerless.  

Emphasis on the divinity of the guru is proper to Hindu Tantric traditions. The  Buddhist Tantric conception is naturally different. Buddhist Tantric spiritual mas ters are also regarded as superhuman. But there seems to be more emphasis on  the strangeness or eccentricity, as well as the supernatural origins and extraor dinary feats and powers, of these "accomplished" beings (called Siddhas or Ma hasiddhas), than on their divine nature. In Tibetan Buddhism, they may be sprul sku, incarnate lamas, which also places them on a higher plane than that of  ordinary people. Their disciples as well must obey and serve them slavishly. The  sufferings and acts of self-denial of such disciples form part of the biographies of  the great spiritual masters (especially the Tibetan ones). The trials endured by  Milarepa as the disciple of Marpa, or of Naropa as the disciple of Tilopa are well  known. The tales are largely imaginary or allegorical, but their raison d'etre is to  underline the supernatural nature and powers of these exceptional, quasi-divine  beings. The Tantric guru is always held to be superhuman.  

The Kularnavatantra, edited by Arthur Avalon [Sir John Woodroffe] (Madras:  Ganesh, 1965) includes a long introduction, two chapters of which provide a  partial translation and commentary on chapters 12 and 13 of that work. The two  sections of verses translated below are based on that edition, from chapters 12  and 13, respectively.

On the Paduka of the Guru  

2. Listen, O Goddess, to what you wish me to tell you and which, when heard,  quickly fosters devotion.  

4. Better than millions of gifts, millions of ritual observances, millions of the  greatest sacrifices is the mere invocation of the holy paduka [of the guru].  

5. Superior to millions of mantras, millions of bathings at pilgrimage places,  superior even to the worshiping of millions of deities is the mere evocation of  the holy paduka.  

6. The paduka, when called to mind in time of distress, protects against all  evil and all calamity; it dispels the greatest fear as well as all harm or illnesses.  

7. The paduka, when remembered, dispels difficulty in thinking, moving,  speaking, intercourse, communication, or action. Indeed, memory, knowledge,  wishing, or giving are done by him alone who ever keeps the holy paduka on  the tip of his tongue.  

8. O Goddess! he who, full of devotion, freed of all evil, does the japa of the  holy paduka reaches immediately the supreme state of being.  

10. Immediately, O Goddess! he who devotedly does the japa of the holy pa duka attains effortlessly the [four aims of life: ] religious merit, wealth, pleasure,  and liberation.  

11. In whatever direction shine the lotus feet of the Lord, thereto one must  bow every day, O Dear One!  

12. There is no mantra higher than the paduka, no god superior to the holy  guru, no [valid] initiation other than that of sakti, no merit higher than that  accruing from Kaula worship.  

13-14. The form of the guru is the root of meditation (dhyana), at the root of  worship are the feet of the guru, the root of mantra is the word of the guru,  the root of liberation is the compassion of the guru. All actions in this world  are rooted in the guru, O Mistress of the Kula! The guru therefore is constantly  to be served with all marks of devotion.  

15. Fear, distress, grief, perplexity, delusion, error, and so forth exist only as  long as one does not take refuge in reverent devotion to the guru. 

48 ANDRE PADOU X  

16. So long as they have no devotion to a perfect master (sadguru), human  beings wander in samsara, suffering from all forms of pain and delusion.  

17. The glorious mantra that bestows the fruits of all accomplishments is  rooted in the grace of the guru. It leads to the supreme Reality.  

18. Just as the boon-conferring guru, satisfied and happy, gives the mantra, so  one must please him with devotion, even by offering him one's own life.  

19. When the best of gurus (desikottama) gives himself to the disciple, the  latter is liberated. He will not be born again.  

20. The disciple should strive to satisfy and honor his guru so that he may  always be pleased. For when the guru is pleased the sins of the disciple are  destroyed.  

21. Yogins, sages, gods such as Brahma, Visnu, and Siva bestow their grace  when the guru is pleased. No doubt about it!  

22. The disciple, directed by the compassionate guru who is pleased with his  devotion, is liberated from [the fetters of] action and gains liberation as well  as other rewards (bhuktimukti).  

32. He who devotedly recalls "My guru is Siva in the form of the Master, who  grants rewards as well as liberation," for him perfection is not far away.  

38. Why such exertions as those of pilgrimage, wherefore observances that  emaciate the body, when the pure service of and devotion to the guru [afford  the same fruit] ?  

46. Never regard the guru as a mere mortal, for to one who thinks so neither  mantras nor the worship of gods will ever give any boon.  

47. Those who associate the holy guru with ordinary [people] either in their  remembrance or in their talk - even their good actions will turn into evil, O  Dear One!  

48. Parents, being the cause of one's birth, are to be honored with great care.  Still more particularly is to be honored the guru, for he makes known what is  and what is not the sociocosmic Order (dharmadharma).  

49. The guru is the father, the guru is the mother, the guru is God, the supreme  Lord. When Siva is angry, the guru saves [from his wrath], but when the guru  is angry, nobody [can help].  

50. By mind, by speech, by action, do what is helpful to the guru. By doing  what is bad for him, O Goddess, one becomes a prey to calamity.  

51. Those who do not act properly toward the holy guru in body, wealth, or  vital power will certainly become worms or insects [in a future life]. 

T HE TANTRI C GUR U 49  

52. Death results from the forsaking of one's mantra, misery from forsaking  one's guru. To forsake both guru and mantra leads to hell.  

53. The body must be borne for the guru's sake. For him alone should one  acquire wealth. One must exert oneself in the service of the guru regardless of  one's life.  

56. When the guru is there, no austerity (tapas) is to be practiced, nor fasting,  pilgrimage, purifying bath, or anything else.  

59. He who worships someone else when his guru is present, O Ambika, will  go to a frightful hell; and such worship would be useless.  

60. To hold on one's head the lotus feet of the guru is not to bear a burden.  One must act as he commands, for the guru is command (ajha).  

78. Destruction results from the anger of the guru, harm from treachery to  him, and evil death from criticism of the guru, and the greatest ill from his  displeasure.  

79. A man may survive after entering a fire, or after drinking poison, or falling  into the hands of death, but not one who has sinned against his master.  

80. Where the holy guru is criticized, one must turn away one's ear, O Ambika,  and leave that place immediately, so that no such thing can be heard. One must  then invoke the name of the guru so as to counteract what has been heard.  

81. One must love those whom the guru befriends and respect his spouse and  family. His practice must never be criticized, be it Vedic, Sastric or Agamic.  

82. The holy paduka is the [disciple's] ornament. To remember his name is  japa. To do what he commands is ritual action. To attend obediently on him  is indeed to worship the guru.  

Guru and Disciple  

51-52. Siva is all-pervading, subtle, transcending the mind, without attributes,  imperishable, space-like, unborn, infinite: how could he be worshiped, O Dear  One? This is why Siva takes on the visible form of the guru who, [when]  worshiped with devotion, grants liberation and rewards.  

53. I am Siva without any form, O Goddess, imperceptible to the human  senses. This is why the virtuous disciples can worship [Me] in the form of the  guru.  

54. The guru is the the supreme Siva himself, manifestly perceptible as en closed in human skin. Remaining thus concealed, he bestows grace (anugraha)  on the good disciple. 

50 ANDRE PADOU X  

55-56. It is to protect and help his devotees that Siva, though formless, takes  on form and, full of compassion, appears in this world as if he were part of the  cosmic flow (samsara). Concealing his third eye, the crescent moon [on his  head], his energies, and two of his arms, he appears on this earth in the form  of the guru.  

57. Siva without his three eyes, Visnu without his four arms, Brahma without  his four faces, such indeed is what is called a guru, O Dear One!  

60-61. The guru is none other than the Eternal Siva. This is the truth. No  doubt about it. The guru is Siva himself . Who, otherwise, would bestow lib eration as well as other rewards? There is no difference, O Parvati, between  the guru and the god Sadasiva. He who distinguishes between them is sinful.  

99. Difficult to find is the guru who, when pleased, immediately affords the  treasure of liberation, thus saving from the cosmic flow.  

104. Many are the gurus who shine [feebly] like lamps in a house. Difficult to  obtain is the guru who, like the sun, illuminates everything.  

105. Many are the gurus well versed in the Veda, the Sastras, and so forth.  Difficult to find is the guru who has mastered the supreme Truth (paratattva).  

107. Many are the gurus who know bad mantras and medicinal herbs, but a  guru who knows the mantras given in the Tantric and Vedic traditions (aga manigama) and in the Sastras is difficult to find on this earth.  

108. Many are the gurus who despoil their disciples of their wealth. Difficult  to find, O Goddess, is the guru who destroys the sufferings of the disciple.  

109. Many on earth are [the gurus] who follow the rules of caste and stage of  life (varnasramadharma) and who know the kula practice (kulacara), but the  guru whose mind is free of all discursive thought is not easy to find.  

110. A guru is one whose mere contact brings about supreme bliss. Such a  guru the wise man choses, not another one. Verily, by the mere sight of him  one gains liberation.  

114. As blades of grass are blown away by a great wind, so the sins of the  disciple are destroyed by the gaze of the guru.  

115. As a lighted fire burns away all fuel, moist or dry, so by the compassion  of the guru are all sins destroyed.  

116. As darkness is dispelled at the sight of a lamp, so the mere sight of the  perfect master (sadguru) destroys ignorance.  

117. He who has all the proper characteristics, who knows all the precepts of  the Veda and the Sastras as well as the rules governing the ways [to liberation]  (upaya), he indeed is a guru. 

T HE TANTRI C GUR U 51  

121. Even [a guru] who does not have all the [proper] qualities is still a guru  [if he] knows the supreme Truth, for only one who knows the Truth is liberated  and can liberate [others].  

After having enumerated different kinds of gurus, the chapter ends as follows:  

129. Though gurus are numerous, only one who performs the full consecra tion (purnabhiseka) is to be worshiped. No doubt about it!  

130-32. Having found a holy guru endowed with all the proper qualities, one  who destroys all doubts and bestows knowledge, O Goddess, one should not  stay with another one. If, however, one happens to have a guru who has no  real knowledge and who causes doubts, no harm would be incurred by leaving  him. Indeed, as the bee eager for honey flies from flower to flower, so the  disciple eager for knowledge goes from master to master.  

133. Thus have I told you briefly the qualities of the guru and of the disciple,  O Mistress of the Kula. What else do you wish to hear?
