<p>Bimla Devi, or Passu Mataji (Respected Mother from village Passu) as she is called  by her clients and devotees, is a female trance healer living in a village near  Dharamsala, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh. She is regularly possessed by the  Hindu Goddess Vaisno Devi. Mataji maintains a small temple attached to her  home, where three days a week she goes into trance and, as the Goddess Vaisno  Devi, answers questions and offers cures for people. Those who come, mostly  women, consult her for a variety of problems including mental and physical  health, family relationships, employment, and spiritual concerns.</p>
<p>Possession by many types of deities and spirits, benevolent and malevolent, is  widespread among women and men throughout South Asia. Divine possession  by goddesses, primarily among women, is prevalent in the northwest part of India,  which includes Kangra, as well as in some other areas. The Sakti or divine power  of the goddess enters into (or &ldquo;plays,&rdquo; khelti hai) and temporarily blots out the  consciousness of the human medium. While in this possession trance, the me</p>
<p>dium speaks with the voice of the goddess. Afterward, most people, like Mataji,  have no memory of what they said in trance, and they return to their &ldquo;normal&rdquo;  state of consciousness. By word of mouth, these women begin to attract followers  who come to them for help with problems and address them as Mataji, a term  that not only means &ldquo;mother&rdquo; in the ordinary sense, but also &ldquo;goddess.&rdquo; There is  a transformation that takes place through repeated possession, such that the  woman becomes more and more &ldquo;goddess-like,&rdquo; more and more divinized. Some  of these Matajis have adopted a renunciant lifestyle and have become gurus in a  broader sense, teaching meditation to their devotees, building ashrams, and giving  discourses on bhakti (devotion) and other spiritual paths.</p>
<p>I learned the details of Passu Mataji&rsquo;s life, a sketch of which I give here, from  her and some of her devotees. She was born around the time of Indian indepen dence (1947), the youngest of six children to an impoverished family of the  Giraths, a low-caste cultivating community of Kangra. She has no formal educa tion and has never learned to read or write. As a child, she never played with</p>
<p>98 KATHLEEN M. ERNDL</p>
<p>other village children but only with another little girl who was always with her,  but whom only she could see. When she told her mother about this little girl,  her mother became concerned and brought her to a healer, a harijan (untouchable  caste member) who made &ldquo;tantra-mantra&rdquo; on her and gave her holy water and  cardamon. After that, she &ldquo;went crazy,&rdquo; and a wandering holy man came by her  house, saying that the Goddess had wanted to come there, but that it was con</p>
<p>taminated. Her parents arranged a marriage for her when she was very young and  tried to send her off to her husband&rsquo;s home at about age twelve. When she was  placed in the palanquin, the Goddess entered into her and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go there.  Stay here and build a temple for me.&rdquo; She followed the Goddess&rsquo;s order and some  years later, again ordered by the Goddess, moved her temple and residence to its  present location in another village. She never married again, and characterizes  herself as &ldquo;not a householder,&rdquo; though she does maintain a household and has  brought up several relatives&rsquo; children. She is also active in the local women&rsquo;s  organization.</p>
<p>In practical terms, Tantra has as much to do with the fulfillment of mundane  desires as with soteriological aims. The powers gained through Tantric practice  can be used for both worldly (bhukti) and spiritual (mukti) purposes. In the non dualist ontology of Tantra, these two are part of the same reality. Mataji and her  devotees are part of a broadly based grassroots religious expression, a kind of  &ldquo;folk Tantra&rdquo; that connects the more formal textual and esoteric Tantric traditions  with exoteric village religion.</p>
<p>I present below a transcription, with a few explanatory comments, of a trance  session I recorded during field work in 1997. The original language was primarily  Hindi with some Punjabi and the local Kangri dialect, with an occasional English  word thrown in. I have not attempted to show this mix of languages in my  translation. Indian languages allow for a much greater degree of ellipsis than is  possible in English. Indirect constructions, omission of subjects and/or objects,  gender-neutral pronouns, interchangeability of singular and plural in colloquial  speech, all contribute to a discourse of vagueness that is highly appropriate to a  trance session in which information of a personal and often delicate nature is  being conveyed to devotees in a public arena where it can be overheard by ev eryone present. In my translation, I have preserved as much of this ambiguity as  English usage will allow. Mataji&rsquo;s linguistic register is at times highly colloquial,  at times highly formal. In order to give some sense of the flow of language in the  performance context, I have purposely not deleted the frequent repetition of stock  phrases and formulas in Mataji&rsquo;s trance speech. Typically, she will describe the  problem, tell the cause, prescribe a remedy, and predict the outcome. Mataji, like  other healers in the area, focuses on a personal object, such as an item of clothing  or jewelry, that belongs to the person seeking help and that is placed in front of  her at the start of the session. The reader will note that Mataji&rsquo;s diagnoses fall into  several categories, including sorcery (jadu tona, opari), the evil eye (nazar), and  astrological influences (graha) such as that of the inauspicious planet Saturn  (Sani), whose day, as in the West, falls on Saturday. In the case of sorcery, she</p>
<p>TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 99</p>
<p>will never pinpoint the evildoer by name but will answer questions concerning  gender, caste, place of residence, and status within the family. The three most  common cures are cardamon seeds, holy water, and threads of three, five, or  seven colors (or sometimes plain black). When eaten or worn, these simple  blessed items carry the Goddess&rsquo;s Sakti (power) and function as amulets to neu</p>
<p>tralize negative forces and protect against further harm. Other cures include mak ing donations, offerings to a deity, or the performance of specific rituals.</p>

<p>A Trance Healing Session with Mataji</p>
<p>It was a chilly Sunday morning in February 1997. By eleven o&rsquo;clock, about a  dozen people were seated on the veranda outside the temple. This number would  gradually swell to over fifty, as people continued to drift in. Because it was a  holiday, there were more men present than there would have been on a weekday,  about one-third of the total, and more school-age children. The devotees ranged  from Dharamsala professionals to landless laborers from neighboring villages. The  temple door was open, exposing the red-clad and garland-bedecked image of  goddess Vaisno Devi. As devotees arrived, they would wash their hands at the</p>
<p>100 KATHLEE N M . ERND L</p>
<p>nearby tap, approach the Goddess with folded hands, and bow in front of her.  After a few minutes, Mataji emerged from an adjacent building, wearing an or ange-red flowered salwar-kameez, red shawl, and a red stocking cap on her head.  She greeted me, as well as a middle-aged man who went inside with her. She  called me in a few minutes later to sit next to her. She said something about a  tape recorder. I had been there several times before without recording anything  and asked if this time I could use it. Both she and the man readily agreed. I said  that if anyone objected, I would turn it off. The man said no one minded. But I  said that since people were asking personal things, that if someone objected, I  would turn it off while that person was there. Mataji agreed, but, in fact, no one  seemed to mind. The people outside, who had been sitting in a line along the  wall, turned and sat lined up in rows facing the temple. Mataji started out by  leading a devotional song to the Goddess, after asking someone outside to bring  the dholak (a drum) and chaine (a tong-like percussion instrument) from inside  the house. People from the congregation had already placed their &ldquo;question&rdquo; items  and offerings of money on the floor in front of her. Those who came later entered  the temple, touched her feet, placed their things in front of her, and took a seat  outside. The congregation sang several devotional songs, a few of which are trans lated below, for about half an hour, after which Mataji gradually went into trance,  her head and body shaking to the beat of the music.</p>
<p>Song (repeated many times)</p>
<p>Give us darsan, Vaisno Mata</p>
<p>The whole congregation has come</p>
<p>With cries of &ldquo;Victory,&rdquo; we have come</p>
<p>Give us darsan, Vaisno Mata</p>
<p>Mataji begins &ldquo;playing,&rdquo; her body shaking in time with the music, her hair flying  around her face, her eyes glazed over. The devotees sing a new song, welcoming  the appearance of the Goddess.</p>

<p>Say: Victory to the true court!</p>
<p>Mataji, still in trance, stops shaking and begins to speak. The singing stops im mediately. She is now fully possessed by the Goddess and signals her presence  by saying something that sounds like jay kares, jay karakand,&quot; a phrase that no  one, including her close devotees and Mataji herself, could decode beyond the  word jay, which means victory and is part of such slogans as &ldquo;victory to the  Mother.&rdquo; I have translated this utterance, which punctuates all of Mataji&rsquo;s trance talk simply as &ldquo;victory.&rdquo; She will point out one by one the items devotees have  placed in front of her, make the diagnosis, and prescribe the remedy, until all the  questions have been answered. Each devotee approaches Mataji in turn when her  or his item has been selected, touches her feet, engages in a brief verbal exchange,  then steps away. Each will return at the end of the session to receive the blessed  articles that Mataji has prescribed as remedies. The middle-aged man, referred to  below as her &ldquo;Helper&rdquo; steps in from time to time to pick up the items and call  devotees inside.</p>

Woman: Who has done this, Mataji?</p>

<p>Woman: Is she a widow or an auspicious married woman?  Mataji: Innocent daughter, she is a widow, not an auspicious married woman.  Woman: All right, Mataji.</p>
<p>Mataji: For this, take cardamon, holy water, and a seven-colored thread.  Woman: Where should I put the pure oil, Mataji?</p>

<p>QUESTION 25</p>
<p>Mataji: Innocent daughter, you want to ask about your distress. You want to  ask, &ldquo;Why am I experiencing distress; what is the matter?&rdquo; Victory! For,  innocent daughter, the affairs of the household were going on as usual, but  all of a sudden, there is this. That&rsquo;s why you want to ask, &ldquo;When things have  been peaceful, why has an obstacle befallen us? Must we continue to bear  this difficulty, or will we again have peace?&rdquo; There is affliction in your home;  there is no prosperity.</p>
<p>Woman: Yes, Mataji.</p>
<p>Mataji: It comes from one side and goes off in another. One can&rsquo;t tell where  it&rsquo;s coming from or how it&rsquo;s snatched away. Therefore, you want to ask, &ldquo;Is  this our own fault or someone else&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; Victory! Innocent daughter,  this is an enemy&rsquo;s might over your household. Innocent daughter, there is  no shortage of money coming into the house, but no one knows how it is  all spent.</p>

<p>QUESTION 29</p>
<p>Mataji: A &ldquo;leaf question.</p>
<p>Helper: Who put this leaf here?</p>
<p>114 KATHLEE N M. ERND L</p>
<p>Mataji: It belongs to a woman wearing a Coca Cola-colored suit. [A middle aged peasant woman wearing a brown outfit steps forward.] It&rsquo;s a question  about the household. You want to ask a question about an animal of the  household.</p>
<p>Woman: Yes.</p>
<p>Mataji: Victory! Victory!

<p>QUESTION 30</p>
<p>Mataji: Victory! Victory! You want to ask about distress; you want to ask why  this distress is occurring.</p>
<p>Woman [who has already asked a question] :Yes, Ji.</p>
<p>Mataji: Innocent daughter, I have already given you a remedy. Do it, and you  will have good fortune.</p>
<p>Woman: Mataji, this is a question for someone else.</p>
<p>Mataji: Innocent daughter, you want to ask about distress. Victory! There is  pain in the stomach, pain in the head, nervousness. The right side of the  body is numb.</p>
<p>Woman: Yes,JI.</p>
<p>Mataji: Innocent daughter, someone has bound her with coercion. Victory!  For this, give cardamon, holy water.</p>
<p>Woman: Mataji, who has bound her with coercion?</p>
<p>Mataji: The binder is from another jat, from another caste.  Woman: Should we give it [the cure] to her now?</p>
<p>Mataji: Why not? There will be good fortune. Devotees, I am gone!</p>
<p>Mataji shudders and then relaxes. Her eyes gradually refocus as she takes a few  deep breaths, straightens her clothing, and smooths her hair. She smiles at those  around her and begins to greet the devotees who have lined up outside. She  knows many by name and inquires about their family members. One by one they  come into the temple to collect the items she has prescribed. She dispenses the  cardamon seeds in small newspaper-wrapped packets and cuts the threads in  neck-length sizes. The holy water, which earlier in the day has bathed the stone  Goddess image, has collected in a small chamber underneath. Mataji scoops up  some of this water, mixing it into a bucket of tap water. She then taps it with a  flower while reciting a mantra under her breath. At Mataji&rsquo;s direction, the helper  uses this water to fill containers that devotees have brought. Mataji distributes  prasad (consecrated offerings) of candies or bananas to everyone. Some of the  devotees circumambulate her temple or visit the adjacent temple to Lord Siva.</p>
<p>TRANC E HEALIN G SESSIO N 115</p>
<p>Some stay awhile to chat with her, ask advice, or seek a blessing for their chil dren. Others leave monetary offerings. A family that has traveled some distance  unpacks their lunch and sits down to eat on the veranda. When everyone has  left, Mataji tidies up her temple, says a prayer to the Goddess, and retires to her  own quarters.</p>
