  <h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>1 Tantra is esoteric since its adepts, tāntrikas, are supposed to have been initiated. The sectarian initiation, <em>dīkṣā</em>, being held as a first step towards liberation. All Tantric adepts or believers, however, are not initiated, But with or without initiation Tantric teaching is always described as secret. On the role of secrecy, see studies by Hugh Urban, notably <em>The Economics of Ecstasy. Tantra, Secrecy and Power in Colonial Bengal</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001).</p>
<p>2 In some cases, as we shall see (for <em>mantroddhāra</em>, for instance – see chapter 1, pp. 12ff.), mantras are to be written, or to be visualised mentally in their written form, but these are exceptions to the general rule of orality.</p>
<p>3 A most common form of those mantras – a form current in Tantric practice too – is for instance <em>OṂ HAUṂ śivāya namaḥ</em>.</p>
<p>For an overview of mantras in Hinduism, see chapter 22 in G. Flood, ed., <em>The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism</em> (Oxford: Blackwell, 2003). On mantras generally, the only comprehensive study remains to this day H. Alper, ed. <em>Understanding Mantras</em> (Albany: SUNY Press, 1989).</p>
<p>4 The word <em>mantra</em> is of the masculine grammatical gender.</p>
<p>5 On these exclamations – or inflections, as they are technically called – see the entry <em>jāti</em> of the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa (TAK), vol. 2.</p>
<p>6 On these, see A. Padoux, <em>Vāc. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras</em> (Albany, SUNY Press, 1990, repr. Delhi, Sri Satguru Publications, 1992); this, however, being a translation of a 1964/1975 French thesis, reflects the state of knowledge of the subject at a time when many tantras now being studied were unknown or not available.</p>
<p>7 These alphabets are also forms of Bhairava or of the goddess: they are alphabetdeities.</p>
<p>8 ‘The <em>mātr̥kā</em>, the unknown universal Mother who gives birth to the cosmos through the [Sanskrit] phonemes from <em>A</em> to <em>KṢA</em>’, to quote from Kṣemarāja’s commentary on Śiva Sutrā 1.4. See here, chapter 4, on <em>nyāsa</em>: the ritual placing of the alphabet is called <em>mātr̥kānyāsa.</em> The conception of the goddess Mātr̥kā and of her role is not the same in all tantras. This subject is being studied by Judit Törzsök: paper read in Pondicherry in 2009.</p>
<p>9 For instance, <em>Ajtāgama</em> 1.13–14, the <em>tantrāvatāra</em> chapter, on the ‘descent’ of the tantra, not a chapter on mantras.</p>
<p>10 Not so surprising, however, if one refers to the Vedic <em>stobhas</em>, such as <em>ī hā bu hvā</em>.</p>
<p>11 <em>pārameśvare’pi avyaktadhvaner mukhyatayaiva prāyaśo mantratvam nirūpitam.</em> This work has been edited with an Italian translation by R. Gnoli (Roma, IsMEO, 1985). There also exists a (less scientific, and difficult to use) English translation by Jaidev Singh (Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1988) – a new edition is being prepared by Bettina Bäumer).</p>
<p>12 The utterance of the mantra, that is. On <em>uccāra</em>, see A. Padoux, <em>Vāc The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras</em>, chapter 7; or the entry <em>uccāra</em> of the TĀK, vol. 1. See too, here, chapter 3 on <em>japa</em>. In Tantric usage, the <em>uccāra</em> of a mantra is often a yogic practice where the mantra moves upward together with the <em>kuṇḋalinī</em> – such is the case of the <em>japa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> described here, pp. 40–41. On this subject, see A. Padoux, ‘Corps et mantra. la présence des mantras dans le corps’, in O. Botto, <em>et al</em>., eds., <em>Du corps humain au carrefour de plusieurs savoirs en Inde</em> (Bucarest-Paris, de Boccard, 2004, <em>Studia Asiatica</em> vols. IV–V), pp. 563–578.</p>
<p>13 This was already stated in the Laws of Manu (2.85) and remains valid to this day. See chapter 3, on <em>japa</em>, p. 25.</p>
<p>14 It may be interesting to quote here the Tamil poet Tirumular’s (<em>c</em>. seventh century) definition of mantra as ‘perfect concentration of the mind on anything’.</p>
<p>15 In the dualistic Śaivasiddhānta, mantras are often called <em>aṇu</em>, that is, atom or rather individual soul. Mantras appear also as discrete, different, entities in the system of <em>pramātr̥</em>.</p>
<p>16 Such is the case, for instance, of the <em>japa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> which takes place at the end of the cult of Tripurasundarī described in chapter 3 of the <em>Yoginīhr̥daya</em> (YH) where the <em>śrīvidyā</em>, which is the mantric aspect of the goddess, ascends along the <em>suṣumnā</em> in the body of the worshipper, or of the ‘subtle’ meditation of the Netramantra described in chapter 7 (pp. 15–51), both briefly described here, chapter 3.</p>
<p>17 <em>mantrā varṇabhattārakā laukikapārameśvarādirūpā mananatrāṇarūpā vikalpasaṃ vinmayyāḥ</em>. (PTV, p. 243).</p>
<p>18 Nor were they the same in the śaivāgamas and in the earlier Pāñcarātra saṃhitās, and still less in the later ones.</p>
<p>19 These elements were taken over from the indexes of Vedic hymns (<em>anukramaṇikā</em>). They are completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>20 It is fair to say, however, that <em>mudrās</em>, as parts of a ritual or used otherwise, are sometimes held to be by themselves effective. This is the case in many rituals where, for instance, a deity is invoked and placed on a ritual support with a <em>mudrā.</em> Such is also the case of the <em>mudrās</em> described in chapter 1 of the <em>Yoginīhr̥daya</em> (1.56–71). These <em>mudrās</em> are also aspects of the power of the goddess, and deities worshipped during the <em>pūjā</em>. On this, see chapter 4.</p>
<p>21 Though <em>japa</em>, especially when made using the rosary, includes rites – see here chapter 5.</p>
<p>22 This is done by the <em>astra</em> (weapon or arrow) mantra <em>PHAṬ</em> or the <em>kavaca</em> (cuirass) mantra.</p>
<p>23 In the <em>prāṇapratiṣṭhā</em> ritual.</p>
<p>24 They may therefore be described as performative utterances or as illocutionary forces, in the sense of J.L. Austin.</p>
<p>25 Then come, in decreasing importance and value, the <em>vijñānākalas</em>, the <em>pralayākalas</em> and finally the <em>sakalas</em>. On this system, see H. Brunner’s ‘Mantras et <em>mantras</em> dans les tantras śivaïtes’, in R. Torella, ed., <em>Le parole e i marmi, Studi in onore di Raniero Gnoli</em> (Roma, IsIAO, 2001), pp. 185ff., or <em>Vāc</em>, p. 104 n.</p>
<p>26 Which was the case of <em>vāc</em> in the Veda: ‘the Word that speaks and is the harmonious ruler of the gods’ (R̥V 8.100,10).</p>
<p>27 My position differs in this from Hélène Brunner’s in her 2001 study referred to in note 25, where she distinguishes clearly betwen ‘Mantras’ as powers and ‘mantras’ as sound units, this distinction corresponding to two different uses of mantras. The distinction of uses, I believe, does not necessarily imply a distinction of nature.</p>
<p>28 The <em>mūlamantra</em> of a deity is the deity itself. The <em>mūrtimantra</em> evokes the deity’s form; the <em>aṅgamantras</em> of a deity symbolise and evoke the <em>aṅgas</em>, the ‘limbs’, that is, the constitutive parts or qualities (<em>guṇa</em>) of that deity. The ‘weapons’ (<em>āyudha</em>) of a deity have also mantras used to evoke them or to place them on the deity’s image.</p>
<p>29 See the <em>uccāra</em> of <em>OṂ, SAUḤ</em> or of the <em>saṃhārabīja KHPREṂ/HSHPHREṂ</em> described in <em>Vāc</em>, pp. 401–426.</p>
<p>30 <em>dhyāna</em> in Tantric context is the word for the mental visualisation of a deity – in addition, of course, to its usual meaning of meditation.</p>
<p>31 On this subject, see chapter 2.</p>
<p>32 Two such well-known manuals of iconography are Mahīdhara’s Mantramahodadhi (sixteenth century) and the somewhat later <em>Mantramahārṇava</em>. The former has been translated with introduction and notes by G. Bühnemann, <em>The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities</em>, vol. 1 (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2000). The second volume deals with the pantheons of the <em>Prapañcasāra</em> and of the <em>Śāradātilaka</em> (ibid., 2001).</p>
<p>33 This ritual is described in several texts, notably in chapter 15 of the <em>Kulārṇavatantra</em> (KT), on which see G. Bühnemann’s study in T. Goudriaan, ed., <em>Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism</em> (Albany: SUNY Press, 1992), pp. 61–106.</p>
<p>34 The rituals thus performed are therefore classified among the <em>kāmya</em>, ‘desiderative’ rites.</p>
<p>35 On these see T. Goudriaan, <em>Māyā Divine and Human</em> (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978), pp. 251–412.</p>
<p>36 This subject is approached more fully in chapter 7, on mantras, of <em>Vāc</em>, quoted in note 12.</p>
<p>37 Or should we say ‘mantra-deity’? Or ‘mantra <em>qua</em> deity’?</p>
<p>38 <em>tasya yā sattā aśeṣaviśvābhedamayapūrṇāhaṃvimarśatmā sphurattā sā mantrāṇāṃ rahasyam upaniṣat</em> (ŚSV 2.3, comm., p. 50 of the KSTS edition, Srinagar, 1911).</p>
<p>39 In this perspective, mantras, made of phonemes ‘extracted’ from the Sanskrit alphabet, are also (or at least one of them can be) at the source of the alphabet.</p>
<p>40 <em>tadākramya balaṃmantrāḥ sarvajñabalaśalināḥ/</em></p>
<p><em>pravartante ‘dhikārāya karaṇām īva dehinām //26//</em></p>
<p><em>tatraiva saṃpralīyante śāntarūpā nirañjanāḥ /</em></p>
<p><em>sahārādhakacittena tenaite śivadharminaḥ //</em> 27//</p>
<p>41 This, the Saiddhantika authors would see differently since for them the mantras are powers that act by themselves. Their position is explained by H. Brunner in the article quoted in note 25.</p>
<p>42 mahāhradānusaṃdhānān mantravīryānubhavaḥ /.</p>
<p>43 See infra, p. 58 for <em>nyāsa</em> or p. 46 for <em>japa.</em></p>
<p>44 New York: Peter Lang, 1990/93; Indian edition, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1996.</p>
<p>45 Vedic recitation, too, was governed by the rule of the absolute respect of the phonetic content of the recited mantra. The Vedic reciter concentrates on the sounds he emits, not on the meaning of the words he utters: this is still the case today. The Tantrika is heir to the Vedic <em>r̥ṣi</em>.</p>
<p>46 Such views are briefly reviewed in A. Padoux, L’énergie de la parole, pp. 178–190 (Paris, Le Soleil Noir, 1980, reprint Fata Morgana, 1994).</p>
<p>47 On mantras in general I would refer the reader to <em>Understanding Mantras</em>, quoted in note 3 and, perhaps, more specially, to the article I wrote as a (far from definitive) conclusion to that book: ‘Mantras, what are they?’ (pp. 295–318).</p>
<h2 id="2-the-extraction-and-examination-of-mantras">2 The extraction and examination of mantras</h2>
<p>1 This is a new version of a paper ‘La sélection des mantras’ published in the <em>BEFEO</em>, LXV, 1978, pp. 65–85.</p>
<p>2 As is often said: <em>mantrāḥvarṇātmakāḥsarve varnāḥ sarve śivātmakāḥ</em>, ‘all mantras are made of phonemes which are all made up of Śiva’.</p>
<p>3 vidyās are feminine mantras (or female mantradevatās), or mantras of female deities. On the nature of mantras, see the Introduction.</p>
<p>4 See Padoux, <em>Vāc</em>, chapter 1 on <em>vāc</em>, and chapter 7 on mantras.</p>
<p>5 On the term <em>uddhāra</em>, see the entry on this word in vol. 1 of the <em>Tāntrikābhidhānakośa</em> (henceforth referred to as TAK), p. 231.</p>
<p>6 In chapter VIII of Teun Goudriaan and Sanjukta Gupta, <em>Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature</em> (Leiden, Brill, 1981).</p>
<p>7 A well-known one is Dakṣiṇāmūrti’s <em>Uddhārakośa</em>, edited by Raghu Vira and Shodo Taki, Delhi, 1978. Or the <em>Tantrābhidhāna with Vīja-nighantu</em>, edited by Tāranātha Vidyāratna (‘Tantrik Texts’ vol.1, Calcutta 1913).</p>
<p>8 The reason for this identification, as well as that for <em>M</em> and time, is not clear for me.</p>

<p><em>tritīyaṃ brahma suśroni hr̥dayaṃbhairatmanaḥ:</em></p>
<p>10 In the <em>varṇasamāmnāya</em> (notably in the case of the phonematic emanation, the <em>varṇ aparāmarśa</em> as expounded in the <em>Tantrāloka</em> (TĀ)), the additional phonetic signs <em>bindu</em> and <em>visarga</em> are included among the vowels which are thus considered as being sixteen in number. (I follow here the traditional practice of considering the diphtongs as vowels. See Padoux, <em>Vāc</em>, pp. 223ff.).</p>
<p>11 <em>tritīyaṃbrahma sakāraḥ</em>, says Jayaratha <em>ad</em> TĀ 30–.167 – this because of <em>Bhāgavadgīta</em> 17.23: <em>oṃ tat sad iti nirdeśo brahmaṇas trividhaḥ smr̥tah</em>, where <em>sad</em> (therefore, here, <em>SA</em> or <em>S</em>) is quoted as the third of the three phonemes (<em>oṃ tat sat</em>) that are the <em>brahman</em>. The esoteric play on words goes here quite far, but the more obscure, the better! (The use of words in more than one sense (<em>śleṣa</em>) is a current Indian traditional interpretative practice – on the subject, see for instance Sanderson’s remarkable study, ‘A commentary on the opening verses of the <em>Tantrasāra</em> of Abhinavagupta’, in S. Das and E. Fürlinger, eds. <em>Sāmarasya, Studies in Indian Arts</em> (New Delhi, D.K. Printworld, 2005) pp. 89–148.</p>
<p>12 See the articles <em>ācārya, guru</em> and <em>deśika</em> in vols. 1 and 2 of TAK.</p>
<p>13 On this process, see Hélène Brunner’s article, ‘Le <em>sādhaka</em>, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’ (<em>JAs</em>, 1975, pp. 411–443, and Gudrun Buhnemann, ‘On Puraścaraṇa: Kulārṇavatantra, Chapter 15’ in T. Goudriaan ed., <em>Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism</em> (Albany, SUNY Press, 1992), pp. 61–106.</p>
<p>14 Admittedly, alphabet is not the best term to name the ensemble of the 49/50 Sanskrit phonemes, <em>varṇas</em>. I use it however for simplicity’s sake since it is familiar to us. As is well known, the Sanskrit alphabet includes 14 vowels (<em>svara</em>) and two additional phonetic units, 4 semivowels (<em>antaḥstha</em>), 25 consonants (<em>vyañjana</em>), and 4 sibilants, a total of 49 letters to which, in Tantric traditions, is added the consonant group <em>KṢA.</em></p>
<p>15 The whole alphabet is also sometimes considered as a mantra. There are, too, alphabet-goddesses.</p>
<p>16 Note to his edition of the <em>Mahānirvānatantra</em>, III, 11–12 (p. 33), a passage where the <em>mantroddhāra</em> is very much simplified, but Avalon’s formula is nevertheless generally valid. Arthur Avalon was no expert in Sanskrit, but the pandits he worked with were. His contribution to the Tantric field was important – and remains useful. The Mahānirvāṇatantra is a late (18th c.) fabrication. It includes elements showing British influences, but it is still worth quoting on some specific points.</p>
<p>17 We shall see later on the technical meaning of this term.</p>

<p>19 A Śaiva text; one of the early (perhaps eighth century) Bhairavatantras. It was commented upon, according to the non-dualist Trika system, by Abhinavagupta’s disciple Kṣemarāja (the <em>Uddyota</em>). Text and commentary are published in the ‘Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies’ (Bombay, 1921–1933).</p>
<p>20 <em>mātr̥kāṃ paśunām ajñātāṃ viśvamātaraṃ sarvamantratantrajananīṃ ādikṣābtām …</em> (SvT-Uddyota, vol. 1, p. 26). See <em>Śivasūtravimarśinī</em> 1.4 (p. 16): <em>tasya ādiksāntarūpā ajñātā mātā mātr̥kā viśvajananī</em>: ‘its unknown mother, <em>mātr̥kā</em>, begetter of the universe, formed of [the phonemes] from <em>A</em> to <em>KṢA</em>’.</p>
<p>21 <em>prastaret</em>, says SvT 1.31b, verbal form explained by Kṣemarāja (ibid., p. 277, l.1) as an <em>ārṣa</em> form for <em>prastr̥ṇīyāt.</em></p>
<p>22 <em>ekacittaḥ</em> is explained in the <em>Uddyota</em> (vol. 1, p. 26) as <em>mantrodayanibhālanapravaṇaḥ</em>, intent upon the perception of the production (creation or coming up) of the mantra.</p>
<p>23 The Mahāmātr̥kā or Mahāmātaraḥ are in fact usually seven: the so-called Saptamātr̥kā – and this is the number mentioned in this passage of the SvT and in Kṣemarāja’s <em>Uddyota</em>, in spite of the fact that the text actually enumerates not seven but eight goddesses.</p>
<p>24 The <em>mūrtimantra</em> is the mantra which, in the ritual, serves to invoke the subtle bodily aspect (<em>mūrti</em>) of the deity being worshipped – or which is, or represents, on a subtle plane, the body of the deity.</p>
<p>25 <em>ante’syā uddharen mantrān yathākramaniyogataḥ//</em> 37//</p>
<p>Comm.: <em>asyā – mātr̥kāpūjāyāḥ, yathakramam – āsanamantramūrtimantrādikramena yo niyogaḥ – tattanmantramūrtimantrādikramena yo niyogaḥ – tattanmantrāvācya devatānusaṃdhānaparatvaṃ tena.</em></p>
<p>26 See for instance <em>Rauravāgama, kriyāpada</em>, 1.1–21.</p>
<p>On the notion of <em>aṇga</em>, I refer to Hélène Brunner’s study, ‘Les membres de Śiva’, <em>Asiatische Studien/Etudes Asiatiques</em>, XL-2, 1986, pp. 90–132.</p>
<p>27 This is composed usually of milk, curds, ghee, cow urine and dung. Another group of five offering substances is that called <em>pañcāmr̥ta</em>, which, in ordinary rituals, consists of five ‘innocuous’ substances such as molasses, honey, ghee, curds and milk, but, in Kaula rites, is made up of human fluids and excreta mixed with alcoholic liquor (<em>vāmāmr̥ta</em>). On these, see A. Sanderson, <em>op. cit.</em>, note 63, p. 113.</p>
<p>28 The officiating person is, if not an <em>ācārya</em>, at least an initiated <em>putraka</em> or <em>sādhaka.</em> Note that here as in the case of the NT, the adept is to act ‘with devotion’: the manipulation of the sacred does not exclude faith, devotion, nor does it exclude its correlate, divine grace.</p>
<p>29 In the Pāñcarātra tradition (as in other ones), each of the fifty phonemes – as a phoneme and as a deity – has a name or names. <em>A</em> may thus be called <em>aprameya, prathama, viṣṇu</em>, etc. <em>Śl.</em> 32 to 58 of this chapter enumerates these names. Such lists of names are given as appendices in the Sanskrit editions of the <em>Jayākhyasaṃhitā</em> or of the LT (see also app. XIII of the English translation of that tantra). See too Dakṣiṇamūrti’s <em>Uddhārakośa</em>, or chapter 347 of the <em>Agnipurāṇa</em> (<em>ekākṣarābhidhānam.</em>).</p>
<p>30 The LT, chapter 25, <em>śl</em>. 30–37 (p. 86, p. 136–137 of the English translation) expresses itself in a similar fashion: ‘The phonemes made powerful by the <em>śakti</em> of Lakṣmī are the source of all mantras. They must be intensely worshipped, praised and meditated upon using their names …, they participate mutually in each other when used in mantras. There is nothing in this movable and immovable world that is not produced by them. Although the forms of mantras are supreme, divine and eternal, they are yet conceived of as produced by the phonemes … Just as one imagines divisions in space which is one, so, for convenience’s sake, one imagines that there are divisions between phonemes [though they are indivisible sound-units] … Having thus clearly realized in his mind this presence of the phonemes in the mantras, and having worshipped them on the ground, in the lotus [the diagram] and in the body of the goddess, he should extract them (<em>mantrān samuddharet</em>)’. The LT, chapters 23–24, describes in details how to display the <em>mātr̥kā</em>, the mother of the mantras (<em>mantramātr̥kā</em>), the divine power creating and pervading the cosmos, and how to worship her before extracting the mantras. The tantra adds that once the lotus-shaped <em>cakra</em> has been drawn, the adept is to visualize the <em>mantramātr̥kā</em>, who is the Self of Viṣṇu as seated on the pericarp of the lotus, her body being made of the fifty phonemes. He is to worship her before extracting the mantras. The <em>Sanatkumārasaṃhitā</em> (Indrarātra, chapter 2), gives a similar description.</p>
<p>31 A good summary of this passage is given by Marion Rastelli, <em>Philosophisch-theologische Grundanschauungen der Jayākhyāsaṃhitā</em> (Vienne, 1999), pp. 126–128.</p>
<p>32 There are fifty-one letters when the vedic l̥ is added after <em>KṢA.</em></p>
<p>33 LT 24, 1–34, pp. 80–82; pp. 127–130 of the English translation.</p>
<p>34 In the LT, chapters 23 and 24, there is a very complete and interesting description of how to display the <em>mātr̥kā</em>, the mother of mantras (<em>mantramātr̥kā</em>, the divine energy pervading the cosmos she has begotten, and how to worship her before extracting the mantras. The tantra adds that once the diagram has been drawn, one must visualise the <em>mantramātr̥kā</em> who is the very Self of Viṣṇu as being on the pericarp of the lotus, her body adorned by and made of the fifty phonemes. She is to be worshipped by the master who must identify himself with her before extracting the mantras (LT, pp. 77–81). The <em>Sanatkumārasaṃhitā</em>a (Indrarātra, chapter 2: <em>mantroddhāra</em>, pp. 228ff. of the Adyar, 1969 edition) gives a largely similar description.</p>
<p>35 On <em>mātr̥kā</em> and <em>śabdarāśi</em> as on <em>mātr̥kā</em> and <em>mālinī</em>, see Padoux, <em>Vāc</em>, chapter 5, pp. 305–329.</p>
<p>36 On the <em>prastāras</em> and <em>gahvaras</em>, see Appendix I of <em>The Ṣaṭsāhasra Saṃhitā</em>, chapters 1–5 (Leiden, 1982), edited and translated by J.A. Schoterman: it is a very complete and interesting study of the <em>prastāra</em> and <em>gahvara</em> system, based on an as yet unedited text of the Kubjikāmata Kaula tradition, the <em>Saṃvartārthaprekāśa</em> of Mukundarāja, where a large number of such diagrams are reconstructed.</p>
<p>Appendix II of Schoterman’s study (pp. 210–221) is on Mālinī, both as an order of letters and as a goddess, and on Śabdarāśi, both as the Sanskrit alphabet and as the god Śabdarāśibhairava.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter of the <em>Kubjikiāmatatantra</em> – KMT (75–106) describes the extraction of mantras from the <em>mālinīgahvara. mālinī</em> being feminine, it is the energy aspect of phonemes that prevails here. The goddess Mālinī is said in the tantra to be the supreme matrix (<em>parā yoni</em>) of the Rudras and Yoginīs.</p>
<p>There is a <em>Yonigahvaratantra</em> where a <em>gahvara</em> is said to be the matrix (<em>yoni</em>) of all mantras. <em>Gahvaras</em> are also described in the <em>Gorakṣasaṃhitā</em>.</p>
<p>37 One finds frequently in India prescribed processes that are as theoretically or apparently constraining as they are in actual practice flexible and adaptable. This is met with continually in Āgamic ritual prescriptions. But it corresponds, in fact, to a very general attitude in Hinduism, where, very often, the general prescribed ruling is accompanied by so many circumstantial precisions or exceptions that it can eventually be adapted to any issue. In the same way, in purāṇic hinduism, to quote Madeleine Biardeau (‘<em>Etudes de mythologie hindoue</em>’ BEFEO, LVIII, pp. 63–65), ‘while the official aim is to be freed of rebirth, all functions so as to allow the world to go on existing eternally’. This seems to be a characteristic trait of the Hindu religious-social consciousness, one of the ways in which Hinduism integrates and resolves its contradictions.</p>
<p>38 Two texts that I happen to have at my disposal: others could as well have been quoted.</p>
<p>39 Pp. 1–26, vol. 4 of the KSTS edition of the SvT.</p>
<p>40 This is Ksemarāja’s gloss.</p>
<p>41 <em>śl.</em> 3 to 10 enumerate various deities or supernatural beings of whom the adept might be an <em>amśa</em> and the efffect this will have. Thus the adept who has <em>brahmāmṣa</em> will be devoted to the Veda, with <em>rudrāṃśa</em> he will be <em>rudrabhakta</em>; the adept with <em>amśa</em> of <em>the</em> Gandharvas will sing constantly, that of Kāma will love courtesans (<em>gaṇikapriya</em>), and so forth. In all these cases, explains Kṣemarāja, the deity will give the adept the fruit corresponding to its power after being meditated upon, its mantra being recited and being offered an oblation (<em>svasiddheḥ phaladāḥ sarve svadhyānajapahomataḥ – śl.</em> 11a).</p>
<p>42 Pp. 8–9, vol. 4; the process is not described in the Tantra but in the commentary.</p>
<p>43 There are many periphrases for designating human flesh used as ritual offering. Used here are the two rather unusual terms <em>vaihāyasa</em> and <em>dhvaja</em>, which, according to Kṣemarāja’s explanation, are used as meaning [the flesh] of a man who has been hanged (<em>udbaddha</em>), and of a man who has been executed by impalement (<em>śūlāropita</em>). However, as Professor Alexis Sanderson (whose help in this matter I gratefully acknowledge) suggests Kṣemarāja may have interchanged the meanings of these two terms which are sometimes to be met with, the two sorts of human flesh being paired for option, in Hindu and Buddhist tantras.</p>
<p>Common terms for sacrificial human flesh are <em>mahāmāṃsa</em> (great flesh), <em>mahādhūpa</em> (great incense), <em>mahākṣmā</em>, etc.</p>
<p>44 The same practice is described briefly (and more clearly) in Kṣemarāja’s commentary of NT 8. 59b–63, vol.1, pp. 208–209.</p>
<p>45 On this see for instance the ŚT, 2. 127–128 and its commentary (vol. 1, p. 102). This <em>cakra</em> is shown and explained in G. Bühnemann’s study of <em>puraścaraṇa</em> in T. Goudriaan, ed., <em>Ritual and Speculation in early Tantrism.</em> Albany: SUNY Press, 1992, p. 100.</p>
<p>46 This <em>cakra</em> is mentioned in the KT 15, 86. It is reproduced on p. 97 of G. Bühnemann’s study quoted above.</p>
<p>47 It is shown and explained in Bühnemann, <em>op. cit</em>., p. 101.</p>
<p>48 See Bühnemann, <em>op. cit</em>., p. 96.</p>
<p>On all these methods, see the commentary of ŚT, 2.129–131 (vol. 1, pp. 102–112) which refers and quotes several tantras: MVT, <em>Mantramukāvali</em>, and (frequently) <em>Piṇgalāmata</em>. The <em>Tārabhaktisuddhārṇava</em> (TBhS), a seventeenth century manual, in its section on <em>aṃśa</em>, quotes in its tenth chapter (pp. 359–366) many such texts.</p>
<p>Krsṇa-vaiṣṇava practices of this sort (very similar to the Śaiva ones) are described, in French, with reference mainly to the <em>Rāmārcaṇcandrik</em>ā, in R.V. Joshi, <em>Rituel de la dévotion kr̥ṣṇaïte</em> (Pondichéry, 1959), pp. 20–22. The diagram with four squares is shown there. This diagram and those used in other <em>aṃśa/ka</em> practices (often called <em>śuddhi</em> in the sense of discharge) are to be found in most contemporary ritual manuals, in all Indian tongues. For example, in Hindi: <em>Mantrasiddhi kā upāya</em>, by Bhadraśīla Śarma (Allahabad, 1968).</p>
<p>49 The <em>kūrmacakra</em> is described in the ŚT, 2.133–137 and in pp. 114–117 (vol. 2) of the commentary, without, however, the way to use it being clearly explained. This is an important diagram used also in other ritual circumstances, in <em>puraścaraṇa</em> notably. It is also described in the short chapter 20 of the <em>Pheṭkāriṇītantra</em>, where it is explained how to use it to determine the <em>aṃśa</em>; the tantra also mentions the mantras whose validity has not been checked.</p>
<p>50 It is sometimes also called <em>mantrārādhana</em>. The term <em>puraścaraṇa</em> can also be applied to the worship of the mantra – <em>sādhanaṃ mūlamantrasya puraścaraṇam ucyate</em>, says a text quoted in the TBhS, p. 315 – since it is the preliminary act (<em>puraskriyā</em>) of the mastery of the mantra. On <em>puraścaraṇa</em>, see G. Bühnemann’s study ‘On Puraścaraṇa: Kulārṇavatantra, chapter 15’, in T. Goudriaan, ed., <em>Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism.</em></p>
<p>51 See for instance the cult of two Yoginīs prescribed in YH 3 166.</p>
<p>52 The SvT, in chapter 8, <em>śl</em>. 3–10, enumerates the different powers the adept will possess if he has the <em>aṃśa</em> of the mantra of various deities: see above, note 36.</p>
<p>53 On these magical acts, see T. Goudriaan, <em>Māyā Divine and Human</em> (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978), which is according to its sub-title ‘a study of magic in its religious foundations in Sanskrit texts, with a particular attention to a fragment on Viṣṇu’s Māyā preserved in Bali’ – a very interesting study.</p>
<p>The TBhS, chapter 10 (pp. 359–366) gives the rules for <em>mantravicāra</em> to be practised with different diagrams for the ‘six [magical] acts’.</p>
<p>54 The KT 15.97 excludes thus <em>kūṭamantras</em>, these being however, according to the tantra’s commentary, mantras consisting of a group of consonants. The same tantra (15.97–99) excludes also different mantras, such as those given by a woman, received in a dream, or those originating from the four Kula traditions (<em>caturāmnāyaja</em>) – which would exclude at least the <em>mūlamantras</em> of all the Kaula deities – and so forth. In this case, as in other ones, exceptions are invoked to blunt the edge of the general rule.</p>
<p>55 These mantras are among those excluded by the KT, as said in the preceding note.</p>
<p>56 For instance in the Sanatkumārasaṃhitā, Indrarātra, 2.</p>
<h2 id="3-japa">3 Japa</h2>
<p>1 This is an English version, corrected, emended or when necessary updated of the paper <em>japa</em>, published in the <em>BEFEO</em>, LXXVI, 1967, pp. 117–164.</p>
<p>2 The <em>Amarakośa</em> 2.7,47 says: <em>svādhyāyaḥ syaj japaḥ</em>, underlining thus either the role of <em>japa</em> in the <em>svādhyāya</em> or the fact that all <em>japa</em> is a sacrifice of the word, and thus, like the <em>svādhyāya</em> a <em>mahāyajña</em>, a very important ritual action.</p>
<p>3 The Brāhmaṇas relate silence (<em>tuṣṇīm</em>), mumbling (<em>jalpa</em>), speaking in a low voice (<em>upāmśu</em>) to the indefinite or illimited (<em>anirukta</em>): ŚBr.5.4.4,13). The mumbling or murmur (<em>jalpa</em>) is associated with life (AiTBr. 2.39,1. See L. Silburn, <em>Instant et cause</em>, Paris, 1995.</p>
<p>4 According to the LT (39.35), the <em>vācikajapa</em> is to be used for minor rituals; the <em>upāmṣu</em> for rituals which bring success or power (<em>siddhikarmāni</em>), the mental (<em>mānasa</em>) one, for rites which bring both success and liberation. The <em>japa</em> done by <em>dhyāna</em> (meditation or visualisation of a deity?) is for achieving success in all cases (<em>sarvasiddhi</em>).</p>
<p>The three sorts of <em>japa</em> are sometimes related to the three levels of <em>vāc</em>: <em>paśyantī, madhyamā</em> and <em>vaikharī</em> – thus Kṣemarāja <em>ad</em> SvT 2.146–7. Or the commentary of Kṣemarāja on SvT 2. 146–7:</p>
<p><em>ātma na sr̥ṇuteyaṃ tu mānaso ‘sau prakīrtitaḥ</em></p>
<p><em>ātmanā śruyate yas tu tampāṃśuṃ vijānate</em>/146/</p>
<p><em>pare ṣr̥ṇvanti yaṃ devi saśabdaḥ sa udāhr̥taḥ</em>/</p>
<p>where he explains:</p>
<p><em>manaso madhyamāyam vāci/upāmśusaśabdau tu</em></p>
<p><em>sūkṣmasthūlaprayatnayāṃ vaikharyam.</em></p>
<p>5 These aspects of <em>japa</em> in the MBh are studied by V.M. Bedekar, ‘The place of <em>japa</em> in the Mokṣadharmaparvan (MBh XII. 189–193) and the Yogasūtras’, <em>ABORI</em>, vol. XLIV, 1963 (pp. 63–74). On the relationship of <em>japa</em> with Yoga, see J.W. Hauer, <em>Der Yoga</em> (Stuttgart, 1958), pp. 198–199.</p>
<p>6 <em>hotr̥ japaṃ japati retas tat siñcatyupāmśu. japaty upāṃśviva vai retasaḥ siktiḥ</em>. The same text (2. 31–32), regarding the recitation of the silent praise, <em>tūṣṇīṃ śaṃsa</em>, which consists in the <em>japa</em> of <em>bhur bhuvaḥ svar</em>, considered as the essence of the sacrifice, parallels it, too, with the emission of semen. See L. de La Vallée Poussin, <em>Etudes et matériaux</em> (London, 1898), pp. 120–123.</p>
<p>7 On Hindu conceptions concerning sexual energy, its spending or its storing, see Sudhir Kakar, <em>The Inner World. A Psycho-analytic Study of Childhood and Society in India</em> (Delhi, 1981). See too, A. Padoux, ‘Le monde hindou et le sexe’, <em>Cahiers Internationaux de Sociologie</em>, vol. LXXVI, 1984.</p>
<p>8 I refer to Alexis Sanderson, ‘The Śaiva Age – The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period’, <em>in</em> Shingo Einoo, ed., <em>Genesis and Development of Tantrism</em> (Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009, pp. 41–350).</p>
<p>9 A unity that reflects the unity of the Hindu world. Buddhist ṭantric practices, too, are marked by the same representations (on the creative efficacy of consciousness or on the image of the body notably).</p>
<p>10 ‘It has come to designate, in classical India, all types of prayer’, see L. Renou, ‘La valeur du silence dans le culte védique’, <em>JAOS</em>, 1979, pp. 11–18.</p>
<p>11 Hélène Brunner, who read a first draft of this chapter and made a number of useful suggestions, remarked that it would have probably been more rational, and clearer, for me to distinguish between the cases where the worship is the main portion and raison d’être of a rite, <em>japa</em> being accessory, and those where the <em>japa</em> is the essential part, the worship being accessory. She also drew my attention to the fact that it is in <em>kāmya</em> rites – especially those performed by the <em>sādhaka</em> – that <em>japa</em> takes the larger place, which is true, see note 16.</p>
<p>12 As, for instance, for Gaṇeśa: <em>OṂ HRĪṂ ŚRĪṂ ṄLAUṂ GAṂ Gaṇapataye vara varda sarvagaṇaṃ me vaśa ānaya THAḤ THAḤ</em>.</p>
<p>13 <em>akārādi kṣakārāntam aksaramālā vidur budhāḥ</em> (<em>Japalakṣaṇam</em> – ms. no. 545, Gov. Orl. Library, Madras). The <em>Nityotsava</em> (NU), p. 127, enumerates thus the rosaries made of the <em>varṇas</em> of the <em>mātr̥kā</em> ‘from the letter <em>A</em> to the letter <em>KṢA</em>’ and those made of <em>rudrākṣa</em>, pearls, rubies, crystal and so forth. The <em>japa</em> of the <em>varṇamālā</em> is prescribed in a number of texts. A Śaiva Upaniṣad, the <em>Akṣamālikopaniṣad</em>, describes this <em>japa</em>, which is done with a rosary and includes various mental visualisations.</p>
<p>14 See <em>Pheṭkāriṇī</em> (PheṭkT) 18.1–8:</p>
<p><em>bhūtalipyā pūṭīkr̥tyā yo mantram bhajate naraḥ /</em></p>
<p><em>kramotkramācchatāvr̥ttyā tasya siddho bhaven mantraḥ</em> //1//</p>
<p>The following <em>ślokas</em> describe this action and its effects. This technique is also prescribed by the KT 15.16. On <em>saṃpuṭīkaraṇa</em>, see here, chapter 7, note 5.</p>
<p>15 <em>mātr̥kājapamātreṇa mantrāṇāṃ koṭikoṭayaḥ/japitāḥ syur na sandaho yataḥ sarvaṃ tadudbhavam</em> //18// – KT 15.18).</p>
<p>16 See, for instance, the <em>japa</em> of the <em>gāyatrī</em> among Brahmins of Gujerat described by L. Sinclair Stevenson, <em>The Rites of the Twice-Born</em> (New Delhi: Orl. Books Reprint Corporation, 1971), p. 223. Or, more generally, R.B.Ś. Chandra Vidyarnava, <em>The Daily Practice of the Hindus</em>, chapter IV, <em>Sandhyā</em>,, especially pp. 39–42.</p>
<p>17 Various prescriptions on favourable periods for <em>japa</em> are to be found in TBhS, pp. 316–317, where several texts are quoted. The JayS 14.188–189 prescribes different periods according to the nature (<em>sātvika</em>, etc.) of the adept. See also AgPur 292.31ff.: <em>mantrasya devatā tāvat tithivāreṣu vai japet</em>:/ etc.</p>
<p>There is also a rule in several texts (AgPur, ŚT, TRT, etc.) saying that <em>japa</em> is fruitless when done while the mantra ‘sleeps’: <em>svāpakāle tu mantrasya japo na phalapradaḥ</em>, says the <em>Rudrayāmala</em> quoted in TBhS, p. 324. But the times when a mantra is ‘asleep’, or ‘awake’ are not to do with the time of clocks. For the AgP (292.8) they are linked with the flow of <em>prāṇa</em> in the <em>nāḋis idā</em> and <em>piṅgalā</em> (see Padoux ‘On Mantras and Mantric Practices in the <em>Agni</em>-<em>Purāṇa</em>’, <em>Purāṇa</em>, vol. XX/1, 1978, p. 59). Other texts say that the ‘sleeping’ state of the mantra is the effect of a <em>doṣa</em> due to its phonetic structure – so ŚT 2.84: <em>trivarṇo haṃsahīno yaḥ suśuptaḥ sa udīritaḥ</em> – this defect is cured, the ŚT says, by showing the <em>yonimudrā</em> together with the <em>udāna prāṇa.</em> The commentary on this <em>śloka</em> (ŚT 2.110, vol. 1, p. 94), however, says that the correction of the defect is necessary only in <em>kāmya</em> rites. This point would tend to justify Hélène Brunner’s suggestion I mentioned previously (note 10) that insofar as <em>japa</em> is a manipulation of the power of the word for particular ends, <em>japa</em> would especially be used by <em>sādhakas</em> rather than by liberation-seekers (<em>mumukṣu</em>).</p>
<p>18 <em>Infra</em>, p. 42.</p>
<p>19 This is also called <em>pūrvaseva</em>, which designates more generally the preliminary propitiation of a deity by the <em>sādhaka</em> to obtain supernatural powers – see the entry on that word in TAK3.</p>
<p>20 I will come back on this later (see pp. 34–35). On the <em>mantrasādhana</em>, see Hélène Brunner’s study, ‘Le <em>sādhaka</em>, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’, <em>J.As.</em>, 1975, pp. 411–443, where, for the choice of the place, the author refers notably to the Mr̥g <em>Cp</em>. 1.95ff.</p>
<p>21 KT 15.22–30. Similar prescriptions are to be found in the PRKS 3.2.35–3/1 (p. 544), or in the TBhS, p. 317, which quotes three different texts; or in the <em>Makuṭāgama</em> 2.766–768 (information H. Brunner).</p>
<p>22 See A. Sanderson, ‘Power and Purity among the Brahmins of Kashmir’, in M. Carrithers, <em>et al</em>., eds., <em>The Category of the Person</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 200–202.</p>
<p>23 See, for instance, the prescriptions of the JRY 2.11 for the <em>sādhana</em> of the goddess Mahājhaṇkariṇī: the <em>japa</em> is done at night, in a cremation ground, a temple to the Mothers or a place for ‘Heroes’ (<em>vīrasthāna</em>), while wearing black clothes, etc.</p>
<p>24 Before a ritual is performed it is necessary to enclose the ritual area by means of a rite named <em>digbandhana</em>, which both delimitates and protects it from dangers coming from outside. On such a rite, see, for instance, TBhS pp. 317–348.</p>
<p>More generally, on the question of the protection of the ritual area against dangers and impurity felt as always menacing – on the Hindu preoccupation with boundaries, see D. Shulman, ‘The enemy within: idealism &amp; dissent in South Indian Hinduism’, in S.N. Eisenstadt <em>et al., Orthodoxy, Heterodoxy and Dissent in India</em> (Berlin: Mouton, 1984), pp. 11ff.</p>
<p>25 In principle, one must not be lying nor standing – see KT15.032–33, or the MatP <em>Kp</em>. 11.12b–13 where other references are given (information H. Brunner).</p>
<p>26 See Mr̥g <em>Cp</em>. 75b: <em>sādhakaḥ. sādhyaveṣadharaḥ.</em> The same text, <em>Kp.</em> 3.1–45b–47, mentions the colours of the different aspects of Ṣiva (inf. Brunner). All worship (as well as many other rites) are to be performed wearing the proper sort of clothing. Usually it must be pure and clean; but in Tantric context it may, on the contrary, be chosen so as to mark the transgression: rags, black material for the Kāpalikās, transvestism in goddess cults, and so forth.</p>
<p>27 Such <em>pavitras</em> are usually rings of sacred herbs bound around the finger. On the subject, see the SP, vol. 2.</p>
<p>28 On all these points, see Rāghavabhaṭt .a’s commentary on ŚT 16.54–56 (vol. 2, pp. 656ff., which is on <em>puraścaraṇa</em>, and quotes a number of texts. Detailed prescriptions are also found in recent works, which shows that these instructions are still valid: see, for instance, Karanidan Sethiya, <em>Mantra-vidyā</em>, Calcutta, sam. 2033 (in Hindi), pp. 10–16 – the directions given concern <em>japa</em> in general. For the author, the colour of the clothes to be worn must be in accordance with the <em>bhāva</em> of the deity. Sewed garments are often prohibited – which is a general rule among observant Brahmins, for all rituals.</p>
<p>29 The <em>Brahmayāmalatantra</em> is as yet (2009) unpublished, It has been studied and partly edited by Shaman Hatley (thesis, 2007).</p>
<p><em>Bhrūkuṭi</em>, contracted brow, is a facial expression typical of wrathful deities – Bhairava, here. <em>Aṭṭahāsa</em> is the laugh of Bhairava or other wrathful deities (such, for instance, as the corpse-like Sadāśiva imagined by the yogin as lying at the base of the <em>triśūla</em> on top of which are the three supreme goddesses of the Trika – Parā, Parāparā and Aparā.</p>
<p>30 This still unpublished tantra is being studied and is in the course of edition by Judit Törzsök.</p>
<p>31 On these <em>nyāsas</em> see the next section.</p>
<p>32 NU, p. 93; <em>Prāṇatoṣiṇī</em>, p. 421, quoting the <em>Sarrasvatītantra</em>, which prescribes a preliminary purification of the mouth, <em>mukhaśodhana</em>. The GT prescribes the utterance of the <em>setu OṂ</em> before and after the <em>japa</em>. Other prescriptions in the JS, chapter 14.</p>
<p>33 NU pp. 93 and 94.</p>
<p>34 See for instance the LT 28.47–50 already quoted which prescribes alternate <em>japas</em> and meditation.</p>
<p>35 ŚT 16.56, comm. (pp. 655–6). For Kr̥ṣṇa rites, see R.V. Joshi, <em>Le rituel de la dévotion kr̥ṣṇaïte</em> (Pondichéry, 1959). Many informations given there come from the <em>Haribhaktivilāsa</em>, an important ritual manual. See too the <em>Nāradapañcarātra</em> – <em>Ṣrī Nārada Pañcaratanam</em> (Sacred Books of the Hindus, 23, reprint, New York 1974).</p>
<p>36 The comm. on Mr̥g, <em>Cp</em> 1.76 prescribes audible, murmured or mental <em>japa</em> depending as to whether the mantra to be mastered by <em>mantrasādhana</em> is of an inferior, middling, or superior sort (without saying what are these three sorts of mantras).</p>
<p>37 Thus NU, pp. 129–130, quoting the <em>Svachandatantrasāra</em>: <em>japas tu ṣaḋvidhaḥ vācika mānasa yogavācika yogamānasika vaṇmānasikayaugikaḥ</em> – the four last sorts corresponding to the association of the utterance of the mantra with yogic practices. On <em>japa, prāṇa</em> and yoga, see further down. The Makuṭāgama 2.760 lists <em>japas</em> in descending order as follows: <em>mānasa, kaṇṭhoṣtha</em> (?), <em>upāṃśu</em> and <em>vācika.</em></p>
<p>TĀ 29. 82–88, quoting the <em>Yogasaṃcāratantra</em>, describes different sorts of <em>japa</em> which are yogic practices involving the movement of <em>prāṇa.</em></p>
<p>38 ‘Hasty <em>japa</em> brings about sickness and slow utterance destroys wealth’ writes a contemporary author: introduction to an edition of the <em>Mantramahodadhi</em> (Mud) (Delhi, 1981)</p>
<p>39 YS 1.28: <em>tajjapastadarthabhāvanam</em> ‘Its [<em>sil</em>. of the mantra] repetition and concentration on its meaning [should be made]’.</p>
<p>40 One may well ask oneself, in such cases, whether the mind of the practitioner is fastened on this mental image, or on the sound of the mantra he recites. Perhaps, the sound forms, as it were, a basis whence the visual image arises.</p>
<p>41 On this subject, see the studies of J.F. Staal (for whom rites are without meaning), <em>The Science of Ritual</em> (Poona, 1982), and <em>Ritual and Mantras</em>: <em>Rules without Meaning</em> (Indian edition, Delhi, 1996).</p>
<p>42 See YH 3.191, and Dī, p. 332. The <em>japakāla</em> may last a fraction of a second: there is no real duration. But such <em>japas</em> are in fact a mental attitude, a <em>bhāvanā</em>, of the practitioner. Many such instances are to be found – see, for instance, the <em>Kulamūlaratnapañcakāvatāra</em> of the Kubjikā tradition, 3.17.</p>
<p>43 In the Mahādevayajña ritual of Tanjore, for instance (in 1951, as reported by C.G. Diehl in <em>Instrument and Purpose</em>, Lund, 1956), were performed a hundred thousand repetitions of the thousand Names of the Goddess, a hundred million recitations of the <em>śrīvidyā</em>, etc.</p>
<p>44 PRKS, p. 550. The form or the material of the seat, the clothes, the bodily posture, etc., vary according to the context and circumstances of the <em>japa</em>. See, for instance, MatP <em>Kp</em> 11.12ff. (vol. 2, p. 198). In all cases one is to follow the prescriptions given for the ritual which includes the <em>japa</em>.</p>
<p>45 One could say here that insofar as we may consider mantras to be performative utterances in the sense of Austin and Searle, the circumstances mentioned previously in which the <em>japa</em> is to be made to produce the desired effect are merely an intensely meticulous case of the necessity of the appropriate social conditions of utterance for it to be effective as defined by these two authors. On performative utterances, one may refer to J.L. Austin, <em>How to Do Things with Words</em> (Oxford, 1975), and to J.R. Searle, <em>Speech Acts</em> (Cambridge, 1980).</p>
<p>46 Śākta texts sometimes prescribe counting on eight phalanxes only, which results in sixty-four (8 × 8), an important number in Tantra: there are sixty-four Bhairava tantras, sixty-four Yoginīs, and so forth. See for instance <em>Yoginītantra</em> 2.30, Another method (on nine phalanxes), GT 18.11–12.</p>
<p>47 The JayS 14.72–76 (<em>meror taṇghananiṣedhaḥ</em>) explains how to do this. For <em>japa</em> of the <em>varṇamālā</em>,, <em>KṢA</em> is considered as the Meru, but it can be included in the count: see <em>Mantrakaumudī</em> of Devanātha Thakura (Darbhanga, 1960), 14: <em>anulomavilomais tair binduvāṇmātr̥kākṣaraiḥ/kṣamerukaiḥ sāṣṭvargaiḥ kl̥iptayā varṇamālayā</em> //13//.</p>
<p>If one uses the hand for counting (<em>karamālā</em>), the second of the middle finger (at least according to some texts) is to play the role of the Meru. But the counting is not done going forward and backward (see <em>Yoginītantra</em> 2.40: <em>anulomavilomabhyāṃ sarvamālāsu saṃjapet</em>/<em>kevalaṃcānulomena prajapet karamālayā</em>). For the JayS 14.72ff., the rosary is always to be counted in the same way, a particular gesture avoiding the overstepping of the Meru.</p>
<p>When one does <em>japa</em> of the phonemes (<em>varṇamālā</em>), from <em>A</em> to <em>KṢA</em>, one recites it twice, <em>anuloma</em> then <em>vilomena</em>, the first phonemes of each of the eight <em>varga</em> (<em>A, KA, TA</em>, etc.) so as to reach a total of 108. According to the JayS, the <em>akṣamālā</em> has 108, 54 or 27 beads.</p>
<p>48 This is a case of the rule prevalent in the Hindu world that the index is never to be used except in destructive or malignant rites. See GT 18.27–30 which prescribes the use of different fingers for different aims. Prescriptions of the same sort in the <em>Śivārcaṇacandrikā</em> quoted in SP1, pp. 216–217: one must use different fingers depending on the the <em>japa</em> being audible, whispered, or mental.</p>
<p>49 PRKS, p. 551: <em>vastreṇācchādya tu karaṃ dakṣiṇaṃ yaḥ sadā japet.</em></p>
<p>50 See YH 3.189b: ‘the <em>japa</em> once thus accomplished, it must be offered in the left hand of the Goddess’, <em>evaṃkr̥tvā japaṃ devyā vāmahaste nivedayet.</em></p>
<p>51 If a new rosary breaks, one is to repeat a thousand times the Aghoramantra, but merely a hundred times if the rosary is an old one (see <em>prāyaścittavidhiḥ</em>, 48, SP2, pp. 260– 261). The breaking of the rosary is <em>karmachidrakaraṇam</em>: it causes the destruction of the [good] <em>karman</em> (JS 14.93).</p>
<p>52 <em>OṂHŪṂ VAUṂ Viśvakṣeṇāya namaḥ</em>.</p>
<p>53 Pp. 325–329 of the TBhS are on <em>puraścaraṇa</em>., enumerating or describing its rites. See too Rāgahvabhaṭṭa’s commentary on ŚT 15.54 (vol. 2, pp. 656ff.) which quotes many texts; or GT. 18. For the vaiṣṇava rite, see the <em>Nāradapañcarāttra</em>, III, chapters 10 to 14. Kane, <em>History of Dharmaśāstra</em>, vol. 5/2, pp. 1008–1112 are on <em>puraścaraṇa</em>, with many textual references. See also H. Brunner’s study, ‘Le <em>sādhaka</em>’ quoted in note 13 of chapter 2.</p>
<p>54 KT 15.18, the <em>pūjā</em> of this list is the threefold daily <em>sandhya</em> – a <em>nitya</em> ritual.</p>
<p>55 See Hélène Brunner’s (French) translation, and her notes, pp. 282–284 of the study quoted in notes 16 and 44.</p>
<p>56 The ŚT 18.14 (vol. 2, p. 716) prescribes 24 million (<em>tattvalakṣaṃ japan mantram</em>) repetitions of the <em>mūlamantra</em> of Śiva, followed by 24,000 oblations, which implies that the ritual lasts several days or months. Manuals of ritual discuss such details and the time necessary for such practices.</p>
<p>57 See thus the <em>Nāradapañcarātra</em>, III. chapter 14, <em>śl</em>. 15ff., where the <em>japa</em> of two mantras of Kr̥ṣṇa protects children against demons (15), keeps away harmful astral influences (19), gives long life (28), brings rain (45), protects from illnesses and from sudden death (52), etc. This <em>japa</em> is to be accompanied by offerings in the fire whilst meditating and visualising the child Kr̥ṣṇā in his ‘games’ (<em>līlā</em>).</p>
<p>58 Cf. GT 18.68: <em>agnir eva mukhaṃ devyās tasmād agnau hutet sadā</em>. Those are ancient notions.</p>
<p>59 Kane (<em>op. cit</em>., p. 1109) says thus that, according to the <em>Kaulāvalinirṇaya</em>, a rite of <em>japa</em> is to be done during the night in a cremation ground with a corpse. The TBhS (p. 334), quoting the <em>Svātantratantra</em>, describes another nocturnal rite where the <em>japa</em> accompanies sexual ritual practices.</p>
<p>60 The same prescription (but without the <em>mudrā</em>) is found in the Mr̥g. <em>Kp</em>. 4, 5 (p. 42, where Bhaṭṭanārāṇayakaṇṭha’s commentary is very explicit).</p>
<p>61 This is at least how the rite appears to me. H. Brunner, who knows the subject much better than I do, feels that I stretch unduly the meaning of this action. For her, the flower symbolises the whole <em>japa</em>, this symbol being what is given to the deity (see Mr̥g’s French translation, p. 55, note 2).</p>
<p>62 But a Tantric <em>pūjā</em> is always seen as a process of identification with the deity that is worshipped, an identification that is ritually achieved (or played out) several times during the cult.</p>
<p>63 On these elements, see here chapter 4 on <em>nyāsa</em>.</p>
<p>64 <em>devīnāṃ vāmahaste tu devānāṃ dakṣiṇe ‘rpayet</em>, says the <em>Rudrayāmala</em> quoted in the <em>Tāriṇīpārijata</em>, p. 94: this eighteenth-century work gives a number of details on the <em>japa</em> (<em>japamālā</em>), of the phonemes of the alphabet, pp. 87–89.</p>
<p>65 The LT 40.18 says (the goddess is speaking): ‘having completed the <em>japa</em> according to the prescribed method, he should give it over to Me and imagine the ś<em>akti</em> in the form of <em>japa</em> as being in my mouth’. Here too the deity absorbs the power of the word when the utterance of the <em>japa</em> ends. The officiant is now to ring a bell identified with Sarasvatī, the goddess of speech, which will cause the mantras to come and thus contribute to the efficacy of the recitation. There follows a ritual worship which will ensure the mantrin’s mastery of the mantra or the fruitful result of its use (<em>mantrasiddhiṃ nigacchati – śl.</em> 29).</p>
<p>66 See for instance <em>Daily Practice of the Hindus</em>, chapter 9, ‘Sandhyā of the Yajurvedins’, section 23, <em>japanivedana</em>: having recited the <em>gāyatrī</em> 108, 28 or 10 times, the officiant, seated in front of the image of the deity, pours some water in the palm of his right hand while saying <em>anena</em> (<em>daśa, aṣṭaviṃśati</em>, etc.) <em>saṃkhyayā japam. bhagavan</em> (<em>Brahmā Visṇu</em>, etc.) <em>svarūpi sevitā priyatāṃ namaḥ</em>, and pours that water in the hand of the <em>devatā</em> (ibid., p. 109).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the private cult that the temple officiant performs at home (or in the temple) for himself, where the <em>japanivedana</em> we have seen takes place, is entirely Tantric.</p>
<p>A mental <em>nivedana</em> linked to the movement of <em>prāṇa</em>, at the end of the <em>japa</em>, is prescribed in SvT 2.136–143.</p>
<p>We may, apropos of the practices described above, underline once more the fact that Tantric practices, far from contradicting the Brahmanic tradition (even if it often runs counter to it), takes place within this tradition: Tantra, I believe, brings to light the inner virtualities of Brahmanism.</p>
<p>67 Here is, as an example, how a small modern manual (<em>Śrīkāīīnityārcaṇa</em>, Prayāg, Kalyan Mandir, saṃ 2030, p. 89) describes (I have shortened a little) the <em>japa</em> at the end of Kālī’s <em>pūjā</em>: after the preliminary rites, pay homage (<em>tarpaṇa</em> and <em>pūjā</em>) to the rosary with the mantra <em>Śrīdakṣiṇakālikā-akṣamālāṃ tarpayāmi pūjāyāmi namaḥ</em>; then pray to the rosary to give success (<em>me siddhidā bhava</em>). One holds it then with the right hand and says another prayer to remove all obstacles. Having saluted the rosary, one will place it on the middle phalanx of the middle finger and touch it with the thumb saying <em>OṂ</em>, which is done while ‘meditating’ (<em>dhyāna</em>) the form of the goddess. Then one will pray to the rosary, asking it to grant happiness and success. Having held it to his head while reciting as before the <em>setu</em> and <em>mahāsetu</em>, the adept or devotee will practise a <em>prāṇāyāma.</em> He then does a <em>r̥ṣyādinyāsa</em> and a <em>karāṇganyāsa.</em> Then the <em>japa</em> itself is to be done. Once finished, it is to be offered, together with a special <em>arghya</em> and <em>amr̥ta</em>, in the left hand of the goddess, while saying <em>OṂ guhyātiguhyagoptri tvaṃ gr̥hanas matkr̥taṃ japaṃ. siddhir bhavatu me devi tvatprasādānan maheśvari. idaṃ japaṃ śrīdakṣiṇakālikādevyā samarpayāmi svāhā.</em> Then one salutes her making the <em>yonimudrā</em> and saying <em>HRĪṂ siddhayai namaḥ.</em> After which the rosary is to be kept in a secret place. The <em>japa</em> is to be followed by a <em>homa.</em></p>
<p>The TĀ 29, describing a <em>pūja</em> according to the <em>Mādhavakula</em> and quoting the <em>Yogasaṃcāratantra</em>, prescribes a <em>japa</em> of a 100,000 to 1,200,000 repetitions, linked to the ascent of <em>kuṇḋalinī</em>; it is said to be a murmuring (<em>saṃjalpa</em>) whose essential nature is an awareness of the subtle phonic vibration (<em>nādāmarśasvarūpiṇī</em>).</p>
<p>68 In the case of the <em>japa</em> (as part of the <em>mantrasādhana</em>) prescribed in the NṢA 5, according to the number of repetitions (from 100,000 – one <em>lakh</em> – to 900,000), the mantrin would be freed from the sins of his previous lives, would be granted the eight ‘great powers’ (<em>mahāsiddhi</em>), or, for nine <em>lakhs</em>, the fusion with the deity (ibid., *śl.*5–6).</p>
<p>69 The fact that <em>śānti</em>, a favourable rite, is among the six magical actions (and is even often quoted first), as well as the fact that these acts are usually described in mythical and religious texts, show that the distinction religion/magic which I make here is problematic and, in fact, quite difficult to apply in the Indian context. This would also raise the more technical problem of the distinction between <em>kāmya</em> rites (that of *śānti *notably) and <em>nityā</em> rites – on which see H. Brunner’s observations in her seminars at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Sciences Religieuses, in 1984.</p>
<p>70 See also <em>Vīṇaśikhatantra</em> (ed. Goudriaan, Delhi, 1985), <em>śl.</em> 224ff.</p>

<p><em>śāntipuṣṭivaśākr̥tyucāṭana māraṇe</em> /</p>
<p><em>svadhāsvahāvaṣaṭ hūṃ ca vauṣaṭphaṭ yojayet kramāt</em> //</p>
<p>See too the explanatory note 62 in SP3, p. 166, or ibid., pp. 532–533, on <em>astrābhiṣeka</em> (ritual sprinkling). In the <em>māraṇa</em>, etc. rites, one utters the mantra without <em>bindu</em> or <em>nāda.</em></p>
<p>72 One finds prescriptions of the same sort in the <em>Śeṣasaṃhitā</em> (14.58–64,a,d 15, pp. 79–83) in a passage concerning the <em>ṣaṭkarmāṇi.</em> Concerning the use of fingers, that of the index for destructive rites is normal (see above). In fact, prescriptions vary largely according to texts. The relationship between some physical aspects of <em>japa</em> and the nature of the rite does not appear to us <em>prima facie</em> to be logically grounded – though, admittedly, a more precise research on the subject may uncover symbolic reasons for this situation.</p>
<p>On the magical uses of mantras in contemporary India, one may refer to C.G. Diehl’s study, <em>Instrument and Purpose</em>, previously quoted.</p>
<p>73 See the observations of Hélène Brunner in SP3.</p>
<p>74 The omissions or errors repaired by <em>prāyaścitta</em> are, so to speak, technical accidents during the utterance. They are not the procedural errors or omissions – the ‘infelicities’ – which, in Austin’s then in Searle’s theory, make the speech acts ineffective. (On mantras as illocutionary or perlocutionary acts, see A.C.S. McDermott, ‘Towards a pragmatics of mantra recitation’, <em>Journal of Indian Philosophy</em>, vol. 3, 1975, pp. 283–298.)</p>
<p>75 See H. Brunner’s study ‘Le <em>sādhaka</em>.’, <em>JAs</em>, 1975, previously quoted.</p>
<p>76 <em>Sāttvatasaṃhitā</em>, with a commentary by Alasinga Bhatta, edited by V.V. Dvivedi (Varanasi, 1982).</p>
<p>77 Thus the <em>brahmavidyā</em> recited in the ear of a dying person, the <em>dīkṣā</em> being in that case limited to the repetition of a mantra, according to the TĀ 19. 31–33 – the recitation, in that case, is a mere ‘reading’ ((<em>paṭha</em>) of the mantra.</p>
<p>78 See, for instance, SP3, note 54a, p. 221, where is quoted the Mr̥g, <em>Kp</em> 7, 98–110, prescribing a <em>japa</em> of the Svapnamāṇavakamantra, an invocation of the god of dreams (necessary to be known for the <em>dīkṣā</em>).</p>
<p>79 In the funerals, <em>antyeṣṭi</em>, for instance (see SP3, pp. 372–3 and 610), but it is in fact a <em>prāyaṣcitta</em>; or, in the cult of ancestors, the <em>ṣrāddha</em> (ibid, pp. 656–657. The MatP <em>Cp</em> 10.73 prescribes 108 repetitions of the Bahurūpamantra to purify those who bear the corpse of an ascetic (<em>yātin</em>) to the place where he will be buried.</p>
<p>80 On this point, see Milton Singer, ‘The Radhâ-Krishna <em>bhajanas</em> of Madras city’ in M. Singer, ed., <em>Krishna</em>: <em>Myths, Rites and Attitudes</em> (Honolulu: East-West Press Center, 1966). See too the observations of Hélène Brunner in the Supplément of vol. 3, ‘Rites et Fêtes’, Fr. L’Hernault &amp; M-L. Reiniche, eds. of the study carried out and published by The Ecole Française d’Extrême Orient, Paris, 1990–1999, <em>Tiruvannamalai, Un lieu saint sivaïte du Sud de l’Inde.</em></p>
<p>81 See pp. 377–392 of that translation; a chart is given on p. 378 of the ascent of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> along the <em>suṣumnā</em>.</p>

<p>83 Infra, p. 46.</p>
<p>84 Commenting on the passage of the YH 3 on the <em>japa</em> of the <em>avasthās</em> and on the <em>śūnyas</em>, Amr̥tānanda uses the term <em>bhāvanā</em> to describe this process. On <em>bhāvanā</em>, see F. Chenet, ‘<em>Bhāvanā</em> et la créativité de la conscience’, <em>Numen</em>, vol. XXXIV, 1987, pp. 45–96.</p>
<p>In an analogous though somewhat different perspective, the TRT 38.18, apropos of the cult of the Yoginīs in the <em>śrīcakra</em>, mentions three different ways for identifying with the deity: <em>nyāsa</em>, which makes the body of the adept similar to that of the deity, <em>japa</em>, which creates this similarity (<em>japas tanmayatārūpabhāvanam</em>), and <em>homa</em>, as a symbolical offering of the universe which dissolves the multiplicity of the created world into the unity of the Self.</p>
<p>85 This sort of <em>japa is</em> sometimes described as a remembrance (<em>smaraṇa</em>). Thus YH 3.184, on the <em>japa</em> of the <em>avasthās</em>, or the <em>Varivasyārahasya</em> of Bhāskararāya, 52, on the <em>japa</em> of the <em>avasthās, śūnyas</em> and <em>viṣuvas</em>. This is due to the influence on these authors of the Pratyabhijñā system for which <em>smaraṇa</em> is a means for the realisation of the Absolute since, by linking the past to the present, it focuses the attention on the supreme reality underlying all phenomena.</p>
<p>86 This information I owe to Alexis Sanderson.</p>
<p>87 F.D. Lessing and A. Wayman, <em>op. cit</em>., p. 187.</p>
<p>On another analogous Buddhist practice, see Stephen Beyer, <em>The Cult of Tārā</em> (Berkeley, 1973), p. 450–452, ‘Reciting the mantra’. Simpler is the <em>japa</em> of chapter 3 of the <em>Mahāvairocanasūtra</em> (ed. Tajima, pp. 117ff.) where a meditative recitation (<em>bunsho manju</em>) is done by contemplating in one’s heart the shape of the letters of the mantra: one sees there the importance of the written sign in Sino-Japanese culture.</p>
<p>88 See Padoux, <em>Vāc.</em></p>
<p>89 The <em>Yogīśvarīmata</em>, also called <em>Siddhayogeśvarīmata, Siddhamata, Siddhatantra</em>, etc., is often quoted in the TĀ. Its doctrine is said to be expounded in the MVT. A critical edition of selected chapters of this tantra, with an annotated translation, was done by Judit Törzsök in an unpublished habilitation thesis (Paris, 2010). However, few of the quotations of this tantra given in the TĀ are to be found in this edition, which is perhaps that of a shorter version.</p>
<p>The <em>Yoginīkaula</em> is quoted only once in the TĀ: is it the same text as the <em>Yoginītantra</em> mentioned in the JRY?</p>
<p>90 He quotes the following <em>śloka</em>:</p>
<p><em>japet tu prānasāmyena tataḥ siddhir bhaved dhruvam</em> /</p>
<p><em>nānyathā siddhim āpnoti hāsyam āpnoti sundari</em> // (vol. 4/2, p. 30).</p>
<p>91 Here is Jayaratha’s commentary: <em>tattadekapiṇḋādyātmakamantrarūpatayā bahir ullasantī varṇakuṇḋalinyākhyā parameśvarī śaktir yadi nāma prāṇasamā prāṇasāmyenodayam iyāt tadunmanā śvaikātmyena prasphured ityarthaḥ (p. 32).</em></p>
<p>92 This at least is how one usually translates <em>haṃsa</em>, this bird being in fact a duck of sorts.</p>
<p>93 See for instance, SvT 7.54–55 or VBh 155: ‘21.600 time by day and night this <em>japa</em> is prescribed as that of the Goddess’. See too TĀ 7.47–50, where various divisions of the mantra and of its utterance all result in 21,600. This number of breaths per twenty-four hours is in fact perfectly real.</p>
<p>94 Thus SvT, VBh, TĀ, ŚSV, such Upaniṣads as <em>Dhyānabindu, Mahāvākya, Yogaśikhā</em>, and so forth. In the <em>Brahmavidy</em>ā Up., the <em>japa</em> of <em>haṃsa</em> is combined with that of OṂ and is associated to the ascent of <em>kuṇḋalinī</em></p>
<p>95 <em>Gāyatrīs</em> can be composed on the model of the <em>savitrī</em> for all divinities.</p>
<p>96 A Tamil author who may have lived in the sixteenth century. This work was edited and translated in French and commented on by Tara Michael (Pondichéry: Institut Français d’Indologie, 1975).</p>
<p>97 Here is SvT 7.59:</p>
<p><em>nāsyoccarāyitā kaścit pratihanta na vidyate</em>/</p>
<p><em>svayam uccārate haṃsaḥ prāṇinām urasi sthitaḥ</em>//</p>
<p>The <em>ślokas</em> of VBh run as follows:</p>
<p><em>sakāreṇa bahir yātihakāreṇa viṣet punaḥ</em>/</p>
<p><em>haṃsahaṃsety amuṃ mantraṃ jīvo japaḥ nityaśaḥ</em>//</p>
<p><em>ṣaṭśatāni divā rātrau sahasrāṇy ekaviṃśatiḥ</em>/</p>
<p><em>japo devyāḥ samuddiṣṭaḥ sulabho durlabho jaḋaiḥ</em>//</p>
<p>They can be translated as follows:</p>
<p>With the letter <em>sa</em> [breath] flows out; with the letter <em>ha</em> it flows back.</p>
<p>Thus the living being recites this mantra <em>haṃsahaṃsa</em>.</p>
<p>Twenty-one thousand times, night and day, is this <em>japa</em> of the supreme goddess,</p>
<p>it is very easy [but] difficult for the ignorant.</p>
<p>98 See, for instance, the <em>Gorakṣaśataka</em> quoted by Briggs, in <em>Goraknāth and the Kanphata Yogis</em> (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982), pp. 292–293; or the <em>Yogaviṣaya</em>, 29, p. 47 of Kalyan Mallik’s <em>Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati &amp; Other Works of Nāth Yogis</em> (Poona: Oriental Bookhouse, 1954; or the <em>Yogamārtanda</em>, 33ff. (ibid., pp. 58–59). The <em>ajapājapa</em> is still in current use even in non-yogic or ascetic milieus. An analogous practice is to be found (with <em>so’ham.</em> instead of <em>haṃsa</em>) in the <em>Haṃsopaniṣad</em>, 10–13, the <em>Brahvidyopaniṣad</em>, 78–79, among the Sants, etc.</p>
<p>99 See the texts quoted by S.B. Dasgupta in <em>An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism</em> (University of Calcutta, 1950), pp. 122–125, and in <em>Obscure Religious Cults</em> (already quoted here), pp. 96–99.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><em>samyendriyasañcaraṃ proccaren nādam āntaram</em> /</p>
<p><em>eṣaiva japaḥ prokto na tu bāhyajapo japaḥ</em> //</p>
<p>This stanza comes perhaps from the <em>Saṇketapaddhati</em>, an important work of the Śrīvidyā known only by quotations.</p>
<p>101 Except probably insofar as the inner perception of the <em>nāda</em> can be actually perceptible as some sort of subtle inner phonic vibration. Several works describe different sorts of <em>nāda</em> accessible to yogins, some of which appear as perceptible. There is thus a division into sixty-seven <em>nādas</em>, eleven of which are ‘unstruck’ (<em>anāhata</em>) sound: see Vidyānanda, <em>Artharatnāvalīū</em>ī <em>ad</em> NṢA 1.12. The subtle form of <em>nāda</em> is often compared to the end of the vibration of a bell which becomes ever more fine untill it disappears altogether in utter silence.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><em>bhūyo bhūyaḥ pare bhāve bhāvanā bhāvyate hi yā</em> /</p>
<p><em>japaḥ so’tra svayaṃ nādo mantrātmā japya īdr̥śaḥ</em> //</p>
<p>103 The I is <em>aham</em>, which written <em>a</em>+ <em>h</em> +<em>ṃ</em> symbolises the totality of the cosmic manifestation which, going from the first (A) to the last (HA) letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is brought together into a unique dot, the origin of everything, the <em>bindu Ṃ.</em></p>
<p><em>A</em> and <em>Ha</em> are sometimes taken as symbolising the manifestation and the resorption of the cosmos; thus Ksemarāja <em>ad</em> SvT7, 29.</p>
<p>104 This tantra, also named <em>Triśirastantra, Trśiromata</em>, etc., is often quoted by Abhinavagupta. It is known only by quotations. It apparently expounds the conception of the supreme godhead as made of the three goddesses Parā, Parāparā and Aparā.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><em>kalmaṣakṣīmanasā smr̥timātranirodhanāt</em> /</p>
<p><em>dhyāyate paramaṃ dhyaṃ gamāgapada sthitam</em> /89/</p>
<p><em>paraṃśivaṃ tu vrajati bhairavākhyaṃ japaḋ api</em> /</p>
<p><em>tatsvarū paṃjapaḥ prokto bhāvābhāvapadācyutaḥ</em> //90//</p>
<p>106 <em>Parāmarśa</em>, this essential notion of the Trika, is very difficult to translate; see the entry on that word in TAK, Vol. 3.</p>
<p>107 This text seems to be known only through quotations by Kṣemarāja and a few other authors. It is likely to be a Krama text.</p>
<p>108 <em>mahāmantrātmakākr̥takāhaṃvimarśārūḋhasya yad yad ālāpādi tat tad asya savātmadevatāvimarśānavaratāvartanātmā japo jāyate.</em></p>
<p>109 For Bhāskara (<em>ŚSVārttika</em>), <em>japa</em> appears in this case as an enunciation resting on energy (<em>vīrya</em>) and leading to identification with the supreme Being. According to him, it can be of four sorts: ‘of energy’ (<em>śākta</em>), identifying the soul with the Self, ‘without parts’ (<em>niṣkalā</em>), which seems to be the utterance of <em>OṂ</em>, that of the <em>haṃsa</em> ‘made of the <em>klaās</em> of <em>nāda – nādātmika</em> – and finally the <em>japa</em> of the living being (<em>jīva</em>), or of the body (<em>paudgala</em>) which is probably the movement of respiratory breath. This commentary is earlier than Ksemarāja’s, and probably nearer to the spirit of the ŚS.</p>
<p>110 We might say of <em>haṃsa</em> with Lilian Silburn: ‘All human beings recite it perpetually, without their knowing it, whether awake or asleep. But the <em>jñānin</em>, different in that from the ignorant, is aware of this <em>haṃsa</em>; he enjoys the presence of Śiva united with his energies, powerful, omniscient’ (my translation from p. 178 of L. Silburn’s French translation of the <em>Śivasūtras</em> with Kṣemarāja’s <em>Vimarśinī</em>).</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><em>akr̥trimataddhr̥dayārūḋho yat kiṃcid ācaret</em> /</p>
<p><em>prānyād vā mr̥śate vāpi sa sarvo’sya japo mataḥ</em> //</p>
<p>112 In the fourth chapter of the <em>Tantrasāra</em>, which gives a shortened version of TĀ 4, Abhinavagupta says that pure intuitive reasoning (<em>sattarka</em>), the pure gnosis (<em>śuddhavidyā</em>) which is the way towards the Absolute can be attained by sacrifice, by oblation in the fire (<em>homa</em>), by <em>japa</em> or by yoga, all of which he defines as an immersion in divine Consciousness. Of <em>japa</em>, he says: ‘it is an inner intense awareness of the fact that the supreme Reality exists by its own nature, independently from the existence of the diversity of the cognisable, for all that is then to appear is a consciousness which grasps and transcends all this dichotomy’ (<em>ubhayātmakaparāmarśodaya</em>).</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><em>matparaṃ nāsti tatrāpi jāpako’smi tadaikyataḥ</em> /</p>
<p><em>tattvena japa ityaksamālayā diśasi kvacit</em> //</p>
<p>114 When commenting on this stanza, Kṣemarāja adds: ‘You teach that this <em>japa</em> which in essence is an awareness of the Unsurpassed … is to be accompanied by the placing [on the body] of the letters of the alphabet’ (<em>japaḥ … anuttaravimarśasāro … varṇalipinyāsena yuktyā śikṣayasi</em>).</p>
<p>In fact, all <em>japas</em> are oriented towards an identification with the deity. This is obvious for the devotional <em>japa</em>, as we shall see. But even in the <em>puraścaraṇa</em> preliminary to <em>kāmya</em> rites, this identification is described as necessary: without it the <em>japa</em> is useless.</p>
<p>115 See, for instance, the YH 3.3 where Bhairava justifies the daily practice of the <em>pūjā</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> by saying: ‘It is performed perpetually by me’ – <em>cakrapūjā ca sadā niṣ padyate mayā.</em></p>
<p>116 On this, one may refer to C.G. Diehl’s study, <em>Instrument and Purpose</em>, quoted here, note 43. See notably, pp. 267–324, on ‘Mantirikam’, where many prophylactic healing rites, rites for success and so forth are described, of which <em>japa</em> is an important element.</p>
<p>117 A difference which of course does exist up to a point in non-dualistic context, where the essential unity of the human being and the godhead, of the <em>ātman</em> and of the <em>brahman</em>, is effectively experienced at the end of the ascesis by the liberated in life. The Śivastotrāvalī is an instance of non-dualistic devotional literature.</p>
<p>118 Elsewhere he writes about <em>japa</em> in <em>āṇavopāya</em>: ‘shall we say that the repetition of a religious formula plays the same part in bringing about the liberation as does a lullaby in putting a child to sleep, a state of physical quiescence’. Further on, he compares the effect of the two other <em>upāyas</em> to autosuggestion (<em>śāktopāya</em>) or deep sleep (<em>śāṃbhavopāya</em>) where the loss of consciousness is complete – but sleep, in this case, is taken in the sense of the second <em>avasthā</em>, therefore as a state superior to wakefulness, which is not our perspective. The case is nevertheless worth considering.</p>
<p>119 See RV 10.63, 2: ‘For all your names are worthy of homage, worthy of praise, Gods, [your names] are also worthy of sacrifice’, <em>viśvā hi vo namaśyāni vandyā devā utà yajṇiyāni vaḥ.</em></p>
<p>120 The same sort of <em>japa is</em> prescribed in Śaiva Upaniṣads (<em>Atharvaśiras, Kaivalya, Jābali</em>).</p>
<p>121 <em>kiṃ japyenāmr̥tatvaṃ brūhīti/sa hovāca yajṇāvalkyaḥ śatarudriyeṇeti /</em></p>
<p>122 Cf. SkPur 1.1.14:</p>
<p><em>śiveti dvyakṣaṃ nāma vyāhariṣyanti ye janaḥ /</em></p>
<p><em>teṣāṃ svargaś ca mokṣaś ca bhaviṣyati na cānyathā</em> //</p>
<p>123 Such practices seem to have existed earlier in Buddhism for the worship of Amitābhā. But both the ‘spirit’ and the actual practice of such a <em>japa</em> differ very much from those of the Hindu <em>japa</em>.</p>
<p>124 This according to Ch. Vaudeville, <em>Kabir</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974). Curiously, the Haripāṭh of Jñāndev (8.2) says that the <em>japa</em> of Rama’s name is the ‘breath’ of Śiva: <em>ātmā jo śivācā/rāmajapa:</em> Ch. Vaudeville, <em>L’Invocation. Le Haripāth de Dyāndev</em> (Paris: EFEO, 1969), p. 64. See note 120.</p>
<p>125 See Milton Singer, ed. <em>op. cit</em>., note 80, ‘The Radha-Krishna <em>bhajanas</em> of Madras City’, especially pp. 118–121.</p>
<p>126 Adh.R, I.6.69; II.5.25; IV.1.78 – this reference is found in F. Whaling, <em>The Rise of the Religious Significance of Rāma</em> (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1988), p. 160.</p>
<p>127 Tulsidas, while affirming that no other name than Rama’s saves, admits however the efficacy of other names, notably those of Sītā and Bharata ‘for many are the names of the Lord’.</p>
<p>We may note that for Tulsidas Rāma is the mantra of Śiva who, at Kaśi (Varanasi), saves all beings by giving them this mantra. The <em>Haripāth</em> says (8.2) that the <em>japa</em> of Rāma’s name is the breath of Śiva – is this an allusion to the <em>ajapājapa</em>? ‘Hari, Hari, such is the mantra of Śiva’ says also the <em>Haripātth</em> quoted by Ch. Vaudeville, <em>op.cit</em>., p. 64–65.</p>
<p>128 <em>Caitanyacaritāmr̥ta</em> of Kr̥ṣṇadāsa, <em>ādilīlā</em>, 8.22, quoted in E.C. Dimock, <em>The Place of the Hidden Moon</em> (Chicago University Press, 1966), p. 226.</p>
<p>129 See A.K. Majumdar, <em>Caitanya. His Life and Doctrine</em> (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1969), p. 226. Rūpagosvamin, in his <em>Bhaktirasāmr̥tasindhu</em>, 1.2,48, defines <em>kīrtan</em> as follows: <em>nāmalīlāguṇādinām uccair bhāṣā tu kīrtanam</em>, ‘the fact of saying or singing the name, the play and the virtues or qualities of the Lord’ (ibid., p. 143).</p>
<p>130 On the Naths as they exist now in India, the most recent study is that of Véronique Bouillier, <em>Itinérance et vie monastique. Les ascètes Nāth Yogīs en Inde contemporaine</em> (Paris: Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l’Homme, 2008).</p>
<p>131 The Haripath recommends also the silent <em>japa</em> (26.4): ‘Dñyandev has taken the vow of silence. He wears his rosary in his heart. This is where he invokes the Name of Hari’ (ibid., p. 146). This, however, does not prevent the Haripāth from recommending mainly the collective singing of the Name: ‘the [only] means of salvation is the company of the saints’ (5.4).</p>
<p>132 <em>to karī tetulī pūjā/to kalpi to japi majhā /… /samādhi majhī</em> // This quotation, like all cited here on the subject is taken from Ch. Vaudeville’s study of the <em>Haripāth</em>, quoted in note 124.</p>
<p>133 See Ch. Vaudeville, <em>Kabir Granthāvali</em> (<em>Doha</em>), (Pondichéry: Institut Français d’Indologie, 1957), pp. XVIII and 36.</p>
<p>134 Ibid., pp. XVII–XVIII. See also passages from the <em>Gorakhbāni</em>, the sayings of Goraknāth quoted by Ch. Vaudeville in the introduction to her <em>Kabir</em> (Oxford, 1974), p. 138: ‘Get hold of the <em>śabda</em>, O Avadhūt ! Get hold of the Śabda! The ‘stages’ (<em>sthāna</em>) are useless obstacles.’</p>
<p>135 This was, for instance, the belief of the Rāmanandins, whose mantra is <em>OṂ Rāmāya namaḥ</em>, or merely <em>rāmāya namaḥ</em>, for <em>OṂ</em> is considered as the equivalent of Rāma. On this and on Tantric elements in Kabir, see Ch. Vaudeville, <em>op. cit</em>., especially section V of the Introduction, ‘Tantric concepts in Kabir’s verses’.</p>
<p>136 One may mention here the persisting use of <em>sumiran</em>, mental <em>japa</em> (<em>mānasajapa</em>), in the contemporary sect of the Radhasoamis: a modern variant of a very ancient tradition. On the Radhasoamis, see H. H. Sahabji Maharaj Sir Anand Sarup, <em>Yathārtha Prakāśa</em> (Dayalbagh, Agra, Radhasoami Satsang Sabha, 1984).</p>
<p>137 On <em>dhikr</em>, see the interesting study of G.C. Anawati and L. Gardet, <em>Mystique musulmane, aspects et tendances, expériences et techniques</em> (Paris: Vrin, 1970), pp. 187– 258, which notes analogies between <em>dhikr</em> and <em>japa.</em></p>
<p>138 According to Anawati and Gardet, <em>op cit</em>. p. 197, the existence of the practice of <em>dhikr</em> made in common is not attested before the twelfth century, and could have appeared under the influence of <em>japa</em>.</p>
<p>139 There are in Bengal Muslim Baùls, the Fakirs.</p>
<p>140 Their case, but also the whole question of the rapports between Islam and Hinduism, was studied by Sayid A.A. Rizvi, <em>A History of Sufism in India</em> (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 2 vol., 1978–1983): vol. 1, ch. 6, ‘Interactions between Medieval Hindu Mystic traditions and Sufism’, vol. 2, ch. 8, ‘The Sufi Response to Hinduism’. Other more recent studies on the subject could be quoted; for instance Thomas Dahnhardt, <em>Change and Continuity in Indian Sūfism</em> (New Delhi: D.K. Printworld, 2002).</p>
<p>An interesting case of syncretism is that of the Ismaelis, see T. Kassam and Fr. Mallison, <em>Ginans. Texts and Contexts. Essays on Ismaeli Hymns from South Asia in Honor of Zawahir Moir</em> (New Delhi: Matrix Publishing, 2007); or Dominique Sila Khan, <em>Conversions and Shifting Identities. Ramdev Pir and the Ismaelis of Rajasthan</em> (New Delhi: Manohar, 1997).</p>
<p>141 A paragraph on the subject in the original French version of this article is not translated here.</p>
<p>142 But what is a prayer strictly speaking, if not what one uses to consider as such in the traditionally Christian Western world? Not a generally valid definition, therefore. Using the word prayer for <em>japa</em> cannot but lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<h2 id="4-nyāsa">4 Nyāsa</h2>
<p>the ritual placing of mantras</p>
<p>1 This is an English version by Gavin Flood of the article ‘<em>nyāsa</em>: l’imposition des mantras’, published in the <em>BEFEO</em>, vol. LXVII, 1980, pp. 62–102. The original text was, where necessary, corrected and updated by the author.</p>
<p>2 We also find the terms <em>vi-ny-AS</em>: ‘to put or place down in different places, spread out, distribute, arrange …; <em>vinyāsa</em> (masc.), putting or placing down … arrangement, disposition, order …, scattering, spreading out, putting together’ (Monier-Williams <em>Dict</em>. – we also need to retain the nuances of these senses).</p>
<p>3 The Brāhmaṇa and the Kalpasūtra testify to the ancient use of ritual touching: we meet them quite often in the <em>Śatapathabrāhmaṇa</em>, accompanied with mantra recitation (e.g. ŚB I.1,2, 10–11; I.2, 2, 4–11; III.2, 1, 4–6 etc.). The word used is <em>abhi-MṚŚ</em>, that is, to touch.</p>
<p>We note that it is the more recent <em>smṛti</em> texts which prescribe <em>nyāsa</em>, although certain authors condemn their use as non-vedic (<em>avaidika</em>): cf. Kane <em>History of Dharmaśastra</em> vol. 2, p. 319. From a certain period the use is general.</p>
<p>4 The <em>nyāsas</em> have not, to my knowledge, been the object of study in any European language except for Aghehananda Bharati ‘Symbolik der Berührung in der hinduistisch-buddhistischen Vorstellungswelt’, in <em>Studium Generale</em>, vol XVII, no. 10, 1964, Heidelberg, pp. 609–620. This article which places the practice in a general anthropological perspective is somewhat brief about the <em>nyāsas</em> themselves.</p>
<p>5 See, for example, ‘hand’ in Hasting’s <em>Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</em>. For India we can observe that hand gestures have a protective value and are used for consecration or homage, as witnessed on ancient Buddhist monuments down to our own day. On this point see the study by Ph. Vogel <em>The Sign of the Spread Hand or ‘five finger token’ (pañcāṇgulika) in Pali literature</em> (Amsterdam, 1919). See also J. Auboyer <em>Le Trône et son Symbolisme dans l’Inde ancienne</em>, pp. 11–15.</p>
<p>6 Cf. my <em>Vâc. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras</em> (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990).</p>
<p>7 On the <em>karanyāsa</em> (or <em>karāṇganyāsa</em>), see later p. 70.</p>
<p>8 This is a natural connection insofar as mantras are a variety of speech-act, and that speech is bound to gesture. If this form of speech which is mantra can be regarded as relevant to language, it is naturally also bound to gesture since in many respects language is in gesture as much as in speech. <em>Mantra</em> and <em>mudrā</em> are systems of coordinated signs. It could be interesting to make a semiotic study of them, without losing sight of the fact that both are grounded in a deeper level of meaning to which they merely give an expression.</p>
<p>9 It is a fact that tantric <em>pūjā</em>, yoga, etc. are complex acts whose sense and scope are at the same time human, cosmic <em>and</em> divine, but which one can also consider in some cases or to a certain extent as taking place entirely on the divine plane, the gestures and operations accomplished by the officiant or adept being then only figures. (Unless it is the sacrificial act which supports the worlds – an ancient brahmanical idea that <em>pūjā</em> has not entirely abandoned.)</p>
<p>10 We find this in a number of passages of <em>śruti</em> (from Veda to Upaniṣads). Tara Michaël has underlined the fact in the introduction to her translation of the <em>Haṭhayogapradīpikā</em> (Fayard, 1974), pp. 65f.</p>
<p>11 We will further see how <em>nyāsa</em> can be used to impose a mantra which symbolises the supreme <em>brahman</em>: in this case one goes (or one tries to go) directly from the empirical plane to pure transcendence.</p>
<p>12 Tara Michaël, <em>op cit</em>. p. 73.</p>
<p>13 On the practices associated with <em>prāṇa</em> and <em>nyāsa</em>, see below. <em>Prāṇa</em> forms somehow a bond between the subtle and gross body of man.</p>
<p>14 On the nature of mantras, see the Introduction. See too <em>Vāc</em>, quoted above, note 6.</p>
<p>15 <em>Pārameśvarasaṃhitā</em>, Kriyākhaṇḋa (ed. U.V. Govindacarya, Śri Vilasam Press, Srirangam, 1953). The text is essentially on ritual.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Ibid. <em>śl</em>. 4: <em>vyāparo mānaso hyeṣa nyāsākhyo yadyapi smṛtaḥ /</em></p>
<p><em>na badhnati sthitiṃ samyak tathā ‘pi kriyayā vinā</em> //</p>
<p>17 See, for example, SP1, II, <em>śl.</em> 2–3 on the Sūryapūjā. ‘One must imagine oneself transformed into the sun’ etc. <em>ātmānaṃ ravirūpeṇa saṃcintyā</em> (vol. 1, pp. 72–73). These operations are described more clearly in chapter 15 of Abhinavagupta’s <em>Tantrāloka</em>, summarised below (pp. 60–63).</p>
<p>18 The level of <em>manas</em> and <em>prāṇa</em> in the sense of vital breath is that of the <em>liṇgaśarīra</em>, composed of three ‘envelopes’: the <em>prāṇamaya, manomaya</em>, and <em>ānandamaya-kośas</em>. Cf. below, note 35.</p>
<p>19 TĀ 15, 159: <em>nyāsakrameṇa śivatāladātmyam adhiśerate</em>. The sacrificer, the sacrifice etc. come to identify with the condition of Śiva by the process of <em>nyāsa</em>, that is, by the execution of the ritual procedures.</p>
<p>20 Or at least after a ritual activity which presupposes a certain concentration.</p>
<p>21 Cf. above p. 56.</p>
<p>22 We see here that if India does not make a clear break between body and spirit, the <em>nyāsa</em> is a means to integrate these two elements.</p>
<p>23 For example, TĀ 15, 295f. summarised below pp. 60–63. One can also refer to the third chapter of the YH, where <em>śl</em>. 83 indicates that the adept, who has performed the <em>nyāsa</em> of the <em>śrīcakra</em> on his body, must consider the goddess as inseparably united to himself (<em>svābhedena vicintayet</em>); see below p. 64).</p>
<p>24 There are cases, however, where meditation, evocation, or mental representation, appear distinct from placing itself. The texts can, besides, designate or not as <em>nyāsa</em> the operations they prescribe.</p>
<p>We should recall that the <em>nyāsa</em>, as with <em>japa</em>, can be considered as also having in certain cases (sometimes above all) a psychological aspect: to turn the attention towards the divinity rather than towards the actions one is performing – such is the case, for instance, for the <em>nyāsas</em> performed during the daily ritual bath, etc.</p>
<p>25 Notably by using as ink particular substances such as orpiment, sandal and so on, or by using a particular script. This, we especially meet in Chinese and Japanese Buddhism where the <em>bījas</em> are drawn in so-called <em>siddha</em> characters according to a peculiar technique which links the writing of the letters to mental concentration and control of the breath. Cf. <em>Shuji-shu, a collection of siddham bījas, the original work of Chozen Bikshu</em>, published by Matsumo Etasu, Koyasan, 1978. Here it is the user of the <em>bījas</em> who draws them.</p>
<p>But the adept can also use a <em>yantra</em> made by an other who has already written the <em>bījas</em> or the whole <em>mātṛkā</em>, so that it is enough to touch them during the ritual so as to perform the prescribed placing.</p>
<p>26 In his translation of these <em>ślokas</em>, M.N. Dutt writes that these entities ‘should be contemplated as written in fire inside the different parts of the body,’ which has no connection with the Sanskrit texts but gives a possible solution to the problem. One practitioner of <em>nyāsa</em> I consulted on this point told me that in the <em>mātṛkānyāsa</em> ‘one touches the concerned part of the body with the <em>mahāmudrā</em> (joining the ring finger with the thumb). While touching, one has to meditate that the letter is there in blazing form.’</p>

<p>28 Abhinavagupta, in these two chapters, follows a more ancient text, the <em>Mālinīvijayottara Tantra</em> (MVT), a work held in special esteem by Kashmiri Śaivism, in which chapters 6 and 8 explain, briefly, the same practices intended for initiation to attain supernatural powers and salvation.</p>
<p>29 The <em>samayadīkṣā</em> is the less elevated of the initiations. After this comes the <em>putraka</em>(or <em>nirvāṇa</em>-) <em>dīkṣā</em>, then that of the <em>sādhaka</em> and finally that of the <em>ācārya</em>. On the subject, refer to the entries on <em>dīkṣā</em> of vol. 3 of the TAK. See also the article by H. Brunner ‘Le sādhaka, personnage oublié de l’Inde du sud’, <em>Journal Asiatique</em>, 1975.</p>
<p>30 <strong>Note added 2011</strong>: on this alphabetical order, see Somdev Vasudeva, ‘Synaesthetic Iconography: the Nâdiphântakrama’ in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, eds., <em>Tantric Studies in Memory of Hélène Brunner</em> (Pondicherry, 2007), pp. 517–550.</p>
<p>31 One sees here that a mantra, the sound aspect or form of the deity (and in this respect more essential than the deity) can also be considered – meditated upon – as a visible, extant, form: that of the deity itself.</p>
<p>The <em>astra</em> is the weapon of Śiva (his cult is described in the same chapter 15 of the TĀ, to <em>śl</em>. 378f.) – cf. <em>infra</em> p. 39, n. 77.</p>
<p>We note that a mantra can be meditated, conceived visibly in spirit, not only in the more or less anthropomorphic form of the deity or one of his attributes, but also in a written form as luminous letters, or else only as a coloured light or a luminous disc (this is especially the case in so-called Tantric Buddhism).</p>
<p>32 He will activate here a non-visual, phonic image which will be the subtle form of Śiva. All the gods have in principle a <em>mūrtimantra</em>. This is not confined to Śaivism.</p>
<p>33 See below p. 63.</p>
<p>34 Here it is the mantra itself which is the god. This is a phonic form of Śiva – but Navātman has also an anthropomorphic aspect, as a beautiful young man. It is the same for the mantra gods Bhairavasadbhāva and Ratiśekhara as, accompanied by their energy, for Mātṛsadhbhāva etc; for all deities, in fact; tantric pantheons are pantheons of mantras rather than of deities.</p>
<p>35 Situated precisely at the level of the energy Parāparā and forming the energy (<em>śākta</em>) aspect of the phonemes. See <em>Vâc</em>, pp. 320ff. and above, note 30.</p>
<p>36 Pure, says Abhinavagupta, because born from the <em>mūrtimantra</em> which appears (ibid., <em>śl</em>. 238 and 261–262) when consciousness is immersed in the pure Reality.</p>
<p>On the emanation within Siva, see chapter 3 of the TÂ and <em>Vâc</em>, pp. 306ff.</p>
<p>A purely spiritual and metaphysical interpretation of a <em>nyāsa</em> is given in the PTV, p. 20, a passage commenting <em>śl</em>. 27 of this text attributed to Abhinavagupta.</p>
<p>37 <em>Tathā śivo’ haṃ nānyo’ smītyevaṃ bhāvayatas tathā / etad evocyate darḋhyam vimarśahṛdayāṇgamam // 270 śivaikātmyavikalpaughadvārikā nirvikalpatā /</em></p>
<p>38 This <em>nyāsa</em> is described in <em>śl.</em> 295–312 of chapter 15, which develops the information of the eighth chapter, <em>śl.</em> 54f. of the MVT. They are part of a section on the ‘mental sacrifice’ (<em>manoyāga</em>) which is to take place before the ‘external rites’.</p>
<p>39 The SP 1 (vol 1. p. 154f.) describes a cult of the throne of Śiva where the same series of energies and entities are invoked to make the whole cosmic manifestation the throne of Śiva. Here, the cult being mental, the adept is at the same time the seat of the divine, the divine itself, and the worshipper.</p>
<p>40 But laughing, conscious, his body shining like ‘ten million fires of time’ (<em>kālāgni</em>): MVT 8, 68, SvT 2.81.</p>
<p>41 <em>Unmanā</em>, for the Śaiva traditions, is the transcendental Void, <em>śunyatiśunya</em>, the supreme principle without a second (<em>nirābhāsaṃ paraṃ tattvam anuttamam</em>, NT 12, 23).</p>
<p>42 On this installation of the trident in the body for the initiation, see A. Sanderson, ‘Mandala and Agamic identity in the Trika’, in A. Padoux, ed., <em>Mantras et diagrammes rituels dans l’hindouisme</em> (Paris: Editions du CNRS, 1986), pp. 169–205.</p>
<p>43 A procedure analogous to the purification of the <em>adhvans</em> is described in chapters 84 and 85 of the <em>Agni Purāṇa</em> dealing with the <em>nirvāṇadikṣā</em>, chapters which are Śaivite. As described there, these rites are related to the process, in fact general in Hinduism, of the <em>bhūta</em>-(or <em>deha</em>-)<em>śuddhi</em>, where the elements constituting the body and cosmos are reabsorbed the one in the other up to where only pure divinity exists (for example, the LT. chapters 30 and 54: <em>bhūtaśuddhi</em>; <em>Jayākhya Saṃhit</em>ā chapter 10; <em>Kālika</em>-<em>Purāṇa</em> chapters 54–55, etc.). The operation is essentially mental: it is through a meditation based on the image of the body that the elements are reabsorbed; but insofar as the process is accompanied by mantras placed on different parts of the body, <em>nyāsas</em> can play a role. On the process of <em>bhūtaśuddhi</em>, see the article by Gavin Flood, ‘The purification of the body in Tantric ritual representation’, <em>Indo-Iranian Journal</em>, 45, 2002, pp. 25–43.</p>
<p>The complex <em>nyāsas</em> are well represented in the texts, thus there is the <em>mahāṣoḋhānyāsa</em> of the fourth chapter of the <em>Kulārṇavatantra</em>, or the <em>nyāsa</em> described in the second chapter of SvT or in the eleventh chapter of the GT. The chapter 25 of the AgPur also provides an example.</p>
<p>The <em>Parameśvara Saṃhitā</em> (4, <em>śl.</em> 53, and chapter 54) describe a purification (<em>śuddhi</em>) of the body by <em>nyāsas</em>. On the system of the six <em>adhvan</em>, see <em>Vâc</em>, pp. 330–371.</p>
<p>44 One may note the frequent occurrence of the sixfold <em>nyāsa</em> in the Śaiva and Śākta texts. The <em>ṣoḋhānyāsa</em> (<em>gaṇeśa, graha, nakṣatra, yoginī, rāśi, pīṭha</em>) is described for example in the <em>Vīra-tantra</em>, the GT (chapter 10) and the <em>Mantramahodadhi</em> (11.48). It involves imposing six forms or aspects (<em>rūpa</em>) of the goddess. Cf. VMT I.1.</p>
<p>The TBhS 5, p. 163f. gives variants. The KT (chapter 4) has a different <em>ṣoḋhānyāsa</em>, the same being given by the <em>Prapañcasārasārasaṅgraha</em> (chapter 8).</p>
<p>But why the number six? The <em>kara-, aṅga</em>- and <em>karāṅganyāsa</em> which are the most current, are encountered in all traditions (see below p. 70) are also six.</p>
<p>45 The GT chapter 10 describes a sixfold <em>nyāsa</em> of the <em>śrīvidyā</em> composed of the six same same series of <em>rūpa</em> of the goddess. But this is a modern work that borrows entire passages from other texts, notably the YH. The introduction of this text published in Srinagar in 1934 is, however, interesting because it gives a table of different <em>nyāsas</em> with their <em>mantra, bīja</em> and phonemes, the points of placing and so on. This edition has run out and is difficult to find.</p>
<p>The <em>Nityotsava</em> (G.O.S. 1923, vol. 23) describes in a detailed way a <em>laghuṣoḋhanyāsa</em> (p. 98) which is made on the fingers, the palms and the back of the hands. It follows the complete <em>ṣoḋhānyāsa</em> (pp. 98–109) made on the entire body and where the placings are always preceded by <em>dhyāna</em>, that is, a mental visualisation of the visible aspect, described by the texts, of the imposed entities. The same text furthermore expounds (pp. 109–117), under the name <em>mahāṣoḋhānyāsa</em>, a placing on the body of the officiant of the <em>śrīcakra</em>.</p>
<p>On the placing of the <em>pīṭhās</em> see below p. 74.</p>
<p>46 In all this ritual, it is in effect the <em>cakra</em> itself that is imposed (in chapter 2, <em>śl.</em> 6–12, pp. 93–97, of the same text, it is the <em>nyāsa</em> of nine divinities presiding over nine parts of the <em>cakra</em> – the <em>cakreśvarī</em> – which is prescribed). These mantras therefore invoke parts of the <em>cakra</em>, and not the deities which reside there. Sometimes, however, in operations of this kind, the mantras used refer both to the <em>cakra</em> imposed and to the deity concerned. It also often quotes the part of the body on which a placing has been made.</p>
<p>47 This is only effective in the case of an adept very advanced in spiritual life: for the majority of adepts the identification remains only in the realm of representation – an observation that applies to all rites of identification described here or elsewhere.</p>
<p>48 There are many descriptions of the imposition of a diagram. For the <em>śrīcakra</em> we may quote the VM 1.112, or the <em>Nityotsava</em>, pp. 109–117 of the GOS edition, where the adept imposes successively the deities of the <em>cakra</em> on his body meditatively perceived as identical with the <em>śricakra</em>, as having the same shape: <em>śarīraṃ cintayed adau nijaṃ śrīcakrarūpam</em>. Jayaratha says similarly in his commentary on the VM, p. 60: <em>evam tripurīkṛtavigrahaḥ sādhakaḥ</em>.</p>
<p>As an instance of contemporary practices, we can quote (among many others) the ritual booklet <em>Śrīvidyānityārcana</em> (ed. Kalyan Mandir, Prayag, 1967). It prescribes two impositions of the <em>cakra</em> during the cult: first external (<em>bahiścakranyāsa</em>) on the body from feet to head; then internal (<em>antaścakranyāsa</em>) on the <em>cakras</em> which is purely mental.</p>
<p>49 In the GT, chapter 9, which is the first of the section on <em>nyāsa</em> of this tantra, begins with a purification of the hands (<em>karaśuddhi</em>) made with the <em>mahāvidyā AṂ ĀṂ SAUḥ</em> (<em>śl</em> 3–4). After this the adept purifies his fingertips with the same mantra and a red flower which he then throws away. The <em>ṛṣyādinyāsa</em> of the mantra (see below p. 68f.) and all the rest of the ritual are described afterwards.</p>
<p>In the <em>Mantramahārṇava</em>, a vast collection of Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava mantras which describes worship and practice, the <em>ṛṣyādinyāsa</em> – which places as it were the preliminary mantras on the body of the celebrant – comes first, but it is immediately followed by the <em>karāṅganyāsa</em> preceding the worship itself.</p>
<p>50 That is, makes full or complete (<em>sakala</em>), or which provides the body of the officiant with parts (<em>kalā</em>). This is another name for the <em>karāṅganyāsa</em>. This can be found in a Sanskrit text quoted by Aghoraśiva, with a French translation, in appendix 1 (pp. 322–325) of the first volume of the edition of the SP by Hélène Brunner.</p>
<p>In a general manner, the rite of the <em>sakalīkaraṇa</em> consists of imposing the <em>aṅgas</em> of the deity on the body of the disciple to divinise it and to create, in the course of the <em>pūjā</em>, the body with its diverse parts (<em>sāṅgam</em>) as the deity to be worshipped.</p>
<p>51 On the different meanings of this term, and especially on the notion of portions or parts of a deity, see the long entry on <em>kalâ</em> of the TAK, vol. 2.</p>
<p>52 Twelve is, in fact, a solar figure. It is the number of <em>kalās</em> of the sun, whereas sixteen is the number of <em>kalās</em> or digits of the moon.</p>
<p>53 <em>Pārameśvara-saṃhitā</em> 4.5–22 (p. 18): I have translated the passage, simplifying it a little. The JayS 11.10–22 (pp. 94–95) prescribes practically the same <em>nyāsa</em>: from the <em>mūla</em> and <em>mūrtimantra</em>, then the <em>aṅgamantras hṛdaya</em> etc. and the attributes and aspects of Viṣṇu. The three final <em>śloka</em> are analogous to those which end the passage translated here. The LT 25.61–63 (pp. 135–136) prescribes <em>nyāsa</em> first on the fingers with five <em>śakti</em>, then with the <em>aṅgamantras</em>, and following with the placing of the <em>aṅgas</em> of Viṣṇu on the palms. See also <em>Agastyasaṃhita</em> 2, chapter 12 etc. In the Śaiva domain, one can cite the <em>Tantrasāra</em> of Kr̥ṣṇānanda, p. 74 etc, A <em>karaśuddhi</em> made with the <em>mūlavidyā</em> of the Goddess is also prescribed before the <em>pūjā</em> in the VMT 1.109 (p. 57). A <em>mūrtinyāsa</em>, distinct from the <em>karanyāsa</em>, is prescribed in the JayS. 20.180–181 (p. 212).</p>
<p>The placings can be of deities, of aspects of a god or, in the case of a mantra, of different words of the mantra etc. One can also place serially groups of phonemes of the <em>mātr̥kā</em>, this is one of the forms of the <em>mātṛkānyāsa</em>. The procedures differ according to the schools, traditions etc; it does not seem, at first sight, that they can be reduced to a general rule. There is even in the <em>Mantramahārṇava</em> 1.6 (folio 95f.) a mantra of Tryambaka of a vedic type: <em>Oṃ tryambakam yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardanam urvarukamiva bandhanānmṛtyor kukṣīya māmṛtāt</em>, of which the <em>karanyāsa</em> is made in the following way: <em>oṃ tryambakam aśṅguṣṭhabhyāṃ namaḥ, yajamahe tarjanibhyāṃ namaḥ, sugandhiṃ, puṣṭivardhanaṃ madhyamabhyāṃ namaḥ</em> etc. up to: <em>māmṛtāt karatalabhyāṃ namaḥ.</em></p>
<p>54 TĀ 15.456–459 (vol. 9 pp. 230–231).</p>
<p>55 SP2, pp. 52–53. The text is brief, a single śloka, but Helene Brunner explains it in a note, referring to the <em>Purusaṃhitā</em> itself cited in the commentary of the Mrg, <em>kriyāpāda</em> 7.14, which mentions the rite. One washes the right hand, anoints it, imposes the <em>brahmamantra</em> on it, then one draws, with the thumb of the left hand on the palm of the right, a <em>maṇḋala</em> where one places Śiva, to which one pays homage. See also SP3, p. 289. or the <em>Suprabhedāgama</em>, chapter 4 analysed by Brunner (<em>Journal Asiatique</em>, 1967).</p>
<p>The Buddhist <em>hastapūjā</em> (Finot, ‘Manuscrits sanskrits de Sādhana,’ <em>Journal Asiatique</em>, 1934), includes the <em>nyāsa</em> of <em>bījas</em>, mentally placing them on the hand together with a lotus and divinities; this is a rite akin but different. The <em>hastābhimantraṇa</em> mentioned in the <em>Adikarmapradīpika</em>, edited by L. de La Vallée Poussin (<em>Études et Matériaux</em>, pp. 192 and 217) appears, on the contrary, as a <em>hastanyāsa</em>, although the word <em>nyāsa</em> is not used: <em>hastam abhimantrya [mantraṃ] vibhāvya</em>.</p>
<p>56 In the sense, it is explained, of being opposed (<em>vāma</em>) to transmigration (<em>śl</em>. 278) and of secrecy (<em>śl</em>. 279) as is normally the case of the practices of the so-called left hand, in particular in the Kaula schools.</p>
<p>57 A gesture one sees often made by Indians outside of a ritual context. Generally, thepositions or movements of the hands of Indians differ from those observable in Western societies.</p>
<p>58 According to the commentary of the SP1 – III.41 (vol. 1, pp. 142–143 note), the <em>āsanamantra</em> involves putting a flower on the throne which is thus consecrated. This resembles the <em>Nityotsava</em> (<em>nyāsaprakaranam</em>, p. 95) where a triple <em>āsana</em> must be imposed with flowers on the <em>śricakra</em>.</p>
<p>The GT as cited in <em>Principles of Tantra</em>, p. 158f., seems to have a rite of installing a <em>devatā</em> in a <em>yantra</em> by means of flowers to which the adept has transmitted divine energy with his breath and the <em>vāyubīja</em> YAṂ.</p>
<p>59 See, for example, Dale Saunders <em>Mudrā</em> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1960), or Stephen Beyer <em>The Cult of Tārā</em> (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1973).</p>
<p>60 The SP, for example, prescribes a number of <em>mudrās</em>, and in the first volume of Hélène Brunner’s edition there is an appendix of descriptions and photographs. One can also cite āgamas and saṃhitās etc. In volume V of the <em>History of Dharmaśātra</em> (pp. 1123–1131), P.V. Kane presents a brief study with an abundant – but still far from complete – Sanskrit bibliography. For Buddhism, one must add to India, Tibet, China and Japan.</p>
<p>61 I have not checked their provenance. There are several texts, from the non-dualist Śaiva Krama tradition, of that name.</p>
<p>62 As the royal seal is a symbol of authority, the <em>mudrā</em> symbolises the power of the divinity; or as the seal authenticates a contract, the <em>mudrā</em> seals a pact between the worshipper and the worshipped. Cf. Dale Saunders, ‘Symbolic Gestures in Buddhism’ <em>Artibus Asiae</em> vol. 21, 1957.</p>
<p>63 In the context of Buddhism, a justification of the mantra-<em>mudrā</em> association has sometimes been based on the theory of the three bodies, <em>vāk-kaya-citta</em>: these being three coordinated and complementary aspects of an ensemble.</p>
<p>64 <em>Bhāvayati</em>, causative of <em>BHU</em>, means to make become, give birth, but also to consecrate, to control and to have in mind, to consider, and to know. The word <em>bhāvanā</em> (f.), derived from <em>BHU</em>, designates intense, mental concentration, the creative power and efficacy of imagination, and mystical realisation (in the ‘way of energy’, the <em>śāktopāya</em> according to the TA). On <em>bhāvanā</em>, François Chenet, ‘<em>Bhāvanā</em> et créativité de la conscience’ (<em>Numen</em>, vol. xxxiv, 1987, pp. 45–96).</p>
<p>65 In this I entirely disagree with Frits Staal’s position: see his <em>Ritual and Mantras. Rules without Meaning</em> (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1996).</p>
<p>66 We know that the word <em>mudrā</em> has several senses, one of which is that of a mystical attitude; <em>mudrā</em> is thus the seal of the ineffable, purely spiritual; in this sense see <em>Mahārthamañjarī</em> (MM), cited in the next note; see also TĀ 32.1–3 – on which A. Padoux, ‘The body in tantric ritual: the case of the <em>mudrās’</em>, in Teun Goudriaan, ed., <em>The Sanskrit Tradition and Tantrism</em> (Leiden: Brill, 1990).</p>
<p>67 <em>Avikalpatayā marś vikalpavargasyāṅgasannāhaḥ / Arghyaṃ vedyavilāsaḥ puṣpāṇi svabhāvapoṣakā bhāvāḥ</em>. The reference is: <em>Maheśvarānandapraṇitā mahārthamañjarī svopajñānaparimalākhyavyākhyopetā</em> (Varanasi: Vārāṇaseya, Sanskrit Viśvavidyālaya, 1972), pp. 112–113.</p>
<p>68 These elements are not always mentioned. The <em>ṛṣi</em>, the <em>chandas</em>, and the <em>devatā</em> are indispensable and their mention is ancient (along with the <em>viniyoga</em>), dating back to the <em>anukramaṇi</em> of the Veda. The other elements are Tantric and they do not always appear; they cannot therefore be considered as necessary elements of all Tantric mantras.</p>
<p>The <em>ṛṣi</em> is, of course, entirely fictitious; it is in fact sometimes a deity. As for the <em>chandas</em>, it can be real if the mantra is of Vedic origin or if the Tantric mantra’s structure corresponds to a certain meter. But the non-Vedic mantras are often formed from a group of short syllables (often unpronounceable) or even consist in one <em>bīja</em>, such as <em>HRĪṂ</em> or <em>SAUḤ</em>, or the fifty <em>varṇas</em> of the <em>mātṛkā</em>, which do not, strictly speaking, have a meter. There are, however, lists of <em>ṛṣi</em> and <em>chandas</em> for each of the fifty <em>varṇas</em>. In other cases, several meters are given. This mention is therefore preserved in many cases only as a kind of reference to the Vedic tradition. The reference is real when elements of a Tantric mantra are derived from a Vedic text, in which case these will be given the same meter as the Vedic passages from where they come. Otherwise, the reference seems to be purely theoretical; although, for contemporary followers, the <em>chandas</em> appears to expresses, if not really a meter, at least a number, an inner rhythm particular to the mantra: for such adepts, this is nothing theoretical.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that the <em>bīja</em> is formed from one or from several words, which is contradictory. The <em>śakti</em> is, in theory, the central part of the mantra and is believed to concentrate in itself its energy; its place in the mantra is in fact variable. As for the <em>kīlaka</em>, a pin, bolt or wedge, it should normally be at the end of the mantra as in an arrow so as to pierce its target, but its place and form also varies.</p>
<p>Another element, the <em>kavaca</em> (in the sense of amulet or protective formula) is sometimes added.</p>
<p>69 This is the principle, valid even if this transformation is generally only theoretical and imagined.</p>
<p>70 We see here the usual dialectic of the tantric <em>pūjā. deva eva yajed devam, nādevo devam arcayet</em>, that one finds constantly and which also explains the purifications during the <em>pūjā</em> as well as the succession of deifying <em>nyāsas</em> (those which we have previously seen for example). One must be already deified to be permitted to ritually worship a deity by a cult which is deemed to lead to deification, and one must be already ‘mantricised’ in order to use and assimilate more completely a mantra. It is necessary to have, in some measure, at the beginning that towards which one strives.</p>
<p>Should we not see there a sign of what is, it seems to me, a well-pronounced intellectual tendency in India: a tendency not to admit (or a difficulty to conceive) a first beginning or a progress which would be a new advent: before starting, things are as it were already there. This is the view, so widespread, of the <em>satkāryavāda</em>, for which the effect pre-exists in the cause or, for cosmology, of all cyclical cosmologies.</p>
<p>Of course, insofar as the <em>pūjā</em> continues – and preserves certain elements of – the old, brahmanical sacrifice, the preliminary divinisation of the tantric officiant can be regarded as continuing, under a different form, the rites by which the Vedic sacrificer and the victim were preliminarily consecrated in order to enter into communication with the gods in the sacrificial area. Perhaps we should add that, in the course of the ritual, the <em>nyāsas</em> seem to have only a temporary role and effectiveness: in each part of the rite, placings are done that are cancelled by those which follow, or by the <em>ācamana</em> which separates them (an observation that I owe to Hélène Brunner). The cancellation of a rite by the following one(s) is also one of the reasons of the redundancy so characteristic of Hindu rites.</p>
<p>71 This according to the <em>Mantramahārṇava</em> 1.6 (folio 91).</p>
<p>Some texts specify the <em>mudrā</em> to be used for these placings. Thus in the <em>Śārasaṅgraha</em> cited in the TBhS, 5, p. 70: the placings of the <em>ṛṣi, chandas</em> and <em>devatā</em> are done with four fingers excluding the thumb – the same way for the <em>bīja</em> and the <em>śakti</em>. But the <em>kīlaka</em>, according to another author, is imposed with both hands on all the body: it is the same if, as is generally the case, the <em>viniyoga</em> finishes the series.</p>
<p>72 For a better view of the <em>mūdra</em>s shown during a <em>pūjā</em>, see for instance G. Bühnemann, <em>The Worship of Mahāganapati according to the Nityotsava</em> (Witrach: Institut für Indologie, 1988); or Richard H. Davis, <em>Ritual in an Oscillating Universe. Worshipping Siva in Medieval India</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991).</p>
<p>A small modern treatise, the <em>Yoga-mantra-saṃhitā</em>, explains: the <em>ṛṣi</em> who has ‘seen’ the mantra is for the adept as his master: that mantra is placed on the head with respect; the meter being made of words and of syllables is placed on the mouth; the deity, residing in the heart of all creatures, must be placed in the heart; and the seed on the genitals.</p>

<p>This <em>nyāsa</em> is also called <em>ṣaḋaṅganyāsa, hṛdayādinyāsa</em>, or <em>hṛdayādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa</em> and, for the hands, <em>anguṣṭhādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa</em>.</p>
<p>The adept must make the <em>aṅgamantras</em> according to the rules at the same time as he places them, thanks to which he deifies his hands and body. Sometimes <em>netra</em> does not appear among the <em>aṅga</em>, which are then only five: this is the <em>pañcāṅganyāsa</em> prescribed in various texts – thus the <em>Nāradapañcaratra</em> 3.3,10–11.</p>
<p>74 There are also secondary aspects called <em>upāṅga</em>: accessory limbs which are placed after the first ones.</p>
<p>75 They are also sometimes represented as separate deities that one ritually places on or around the image being used for worship – thus SP1 (vol. 1 pp. 208–210). On the <em>aṅga</em> and their symbolism in Śaivism see SP1, introduction, p. xxxiv and pp. 194–197), also vol. 3, pp. 400–404 (note 440), and Hélène Brunner, ‘Les membres de Śiva’, <em>Asiatische Studien/Etudes Asiatiques</em>, XL.2 (1986), pp. 89–132.</p>
<p>76 In the Śaiva tradition, this is the third eye of Śiva, that of consciousness, situated on the forehead between the two others eyes: the word <em>netra</em> in the <em>aṅgamantra netra</em> is in the singular (for the third eye) or in the plural (for the three eyes), but never in the dual.</p>
<p>77 The consonants which serve to form these <em>bījas</em> vary according to the deity, the school etc. But the vocalic element is stereotyped – <em>saḋdhīrghair ādyādyabījena karāṅganyāsam</em> says the <em>Phetkāriṇitantra</em>, as cited in the TBhS (p. 170). One forms the <em>bījas</em> on the basis of the <em>bīja</em> or of the principal <em>vidyā</em> (<em>ādyabījena</em>) of the mantra while associating it, in due order, with the six long vowels <em>Ā</em> etc. (<em>ṣaḋdīrghair ādi…</em>), in fact with <em>ā, ī, ū, ai, au</em>, and <em>aḥ</em>. One will thus have, starting from the <em>vidyā SAUḤ</em>: <em>sāṃ, sīṃ, sūṃ, saim, saḥ;</em> starting from <em>HṚĪṂ</em>: <em>hrām</em> etc.</p>
<p>The <em>vaktra</em> mantras, on the other hand, are done with short vowels. The same instructions are in the <em>Agni Purāṇa</em> 25, 5 fl. (Vaiṣṇava chapter); the same (for only the <em>aṅgamantra</em>) in the JayS 6.105ff. etc.</p>
<p>78 In the Pāñcarātra tradition, the LT (ch. 33) gives the <em>aṅgas</em> of the <em>tārikāvidyā</em> of Tārā used in the cult of Lakṣmī: one adds to the <em>aṅga</em> a term (<em>jñāna, aiśvarya, śakti, bala, tejas</em>) whose invocation carries to the adept, through <em>nyāsa</em>, each of the qualities enumerated – the <em>aṅgas</em> are of the model <em>Oṃ hrāṃ jñānāya hṛdayāya namaḥ</em> (we note that the <em>aṅgamantra</em> for <em>netra</em> is <em>netrabhyām</em>, the two eyes, instead of the three eyes of Śaivism). The commentary on the Śaiva ST 18.6 (p. 713) associates in the same way to the six <em>aṅgas</em> the enunciation of the six qualities (<em>guṇa</em>) or infinite glories of Śiva, omniscience, etc. The SP1 quoted above associates the <em>aṅgamantras</em> with five other attributes of Śiva (the <em>netra</em> is sometimes omitted – cf. above note 68.</p>
<p>79 <em>Phaṭ</em> is usually called the <em>astra</em> (or <em>heti</em>) mantra – it is the weapon, the missile, especially the arm of Agni. It shines, says the TĀ (15.232), as the flame of the fire of time, destroying and purifying the gross and subtle body of the adept. The same designation of <em>phaṭ</em> occurs in Buddhism – cf. Finot, ‘Manuscrits sanskrits de sādhanas’, <em>JAs.</em> 1934, p. 60: <em>phaṭ phaṭ sarvāṅgeṣvastram … arpayet.</em></p>
<p>80 The rule often allows exceptions in certain traditions. See, for example, the notes of N.R. Bhatt in his edition of the <em>Raurāvāgama</em> (I.1.4, vol. 1, p. 18); see also the commentary of the <em>Haṃsopaniṣad</em> by Upaniṣadbrahmayogin (ed. Adyar, p. 566). There may also exist variants in the case of optional rites (<em>kāmyakarmāṇi</em>).</p>
<p>81 Preceded sometimes by a bīja formed as indicated above.</p>
<p>82 This is according to the TBhS (p. 170). But there are other ways of doing it: thus the <em>Nāradapañcarātra</em> III.3.24. This triple <em>nyāsa</em> has the main sense of symbolising the threefold activity of the divinity and therefore of placing it with all its cosmic dynamism. But each of the three <em>nyāsas</em> can also be supposed to have a particular effect (cf. <em>Nāradapañcarātra loc. cit</em>.) or else can be prescribed for different categories of adepts (cf. <em>Tāriṇīpārjāta</em>, p. 23).</p>
<p>83 One finds the <em>aṅga</em>-or <em>karāṅganyāsa</em> described or prescribed as well in texts other than those presented above or in the preceding notes. For example, the TĀ (chapter 30), the SvT 1.71–72, the NT 12.28–33, the <em>Kālīkāpurāṇa</em>, the JayS 6.105ff. etc.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><em>Mantrā mūkatvam āyānti vinyāsena vinā lipeḥ/</em></p>
<p><em>Sarvamantrasiddhyarthaṃ tasmād adau lipiṃ nyaset//</em> (TBhS p. 159).</p>
<p>A small modern manual (<em>Śrīvidyānityāḥnika</em>) describes the <em>mātṛkā</em> as a great mantra serving to place the goddess Mātṛkāsarasvatī: <em>śrīmātṛikāsarasvatīnyāsamahāmantra</em>.</p>
<p>85 ‘The <em>mātṛkā</em>, mother of the gods, origin of all mantras’, says the GT 9.14, in the exposition of <em>nyāsa</em>. And Abhinavagupta in the TĀ 15.130–31: ‘This inner energy born from Bhairava under the aspect of the mass of sound (<em>śabdarāśi</em>), one calls <em>mātṛkā</em>, because it is the mother of all that appears’ (TĀ vol. 9, p. 58).</p>
<p>86 The formula used is generally of the type: a group of consonants (<em>varga</em>) framed by two vowels (one short, one long), these and the others with the <em>bindu</em>: <em>aṃ, kaṃ</em> etc. + part of the hand or <em>aṅga</em> + the appropriate <em>jāti</em> (<em>namaḥ</em> etc.); this allows the placing of twelve vowels (6 × 2) and all the other phonemes. Cf, for example, <em>Nityotsava</em> (<em>nyāsaprakaraṇam</em>), p. 73.</p>
<p>87 <em>Vaiṣṇava Gautamīya</em> cited in TBhS p. 160. The placings on the lotuses are not necessarily made in the order from bottom to top, as in the <em>Dakṣinamūrti-saṃhitā</em> cited by TBhS p. 160. This saṃhitā, which is a text of the Śrīvidyā and not of the Pāñcarātra, contains in its eighth <em>paṭala</em> the description of a <em>mātṛikāpūjā</em> including <em>ṣaḋaṅga</em>- and <em>bahirmātṛkānyāsa</em>, thanks to which, it tells us (<em>śl</em>. 16), the mantrin will become <em>varṇa-svarūpa</em>, thus identified in his essence with the divine energy of the phonemes. This <em>pūjā</em> continues with the <em>dhyāna</em> of the <em>mātṛkādevī</em>, then by the drawing of a <em>yantra</em> where worship will be performed to her.</p>
<p>88 TBhS p. 160. The same in the <em>Nityotsava</em> p. 94: <em>iti dhyatvā manasā puṣpāñjaliṃ dattvā mātr̥kāḥ … svāṅgeṣu nyaset</em>.</p>
<p>89 TBhS citing the <em>Vaiṣṇava-Gautamīya</em>. This description, as the name of the text would suggest, is a Vaiṣṇava work. I have not, however, found in the Vaiṣṇava texts I have consulted a description of the <em>mātṛkānyāsa</em> being exactly the same as that of the Śaiva texts I quote here, which is more complex.</p>
<p>90 Citations of another tantra (<em>tantrāntara</em>) in the TBhS 5, p. 159.</p>
<p>91 The prescriptions are varied. But often the vowels are placed on the face and head, the consonants on the body, and the semi-vowels, spirants and <em>KṢA</em> on the heart, associating them there with the elements that constitute the body, the breath, and the self. Thus the GT 9.25–31; AgPur, chapter 293, 37–39; <em>lipinyāsa</em>; <em>Tāriṇīpārijāta</em>, pp. 18–19 etc.</p>
<p>92 TBhS, pp. 160–162.</p>
<p>93 Cf <em>Vāc</em> pp. 320–327, based on TĀ 15.120–142 – vol. 9, pp. 62–74. The <em>mālinī</em> is also mentioned in other, earlier tantric works, such as the <em>Siddhayogesvarimata</em>, the <em>Tantrasadbhâva</em>, the <em>Satsāhasrasamhitā</em>, etc.</p>
<p>On the subject I refer to Somdev Vasudeva’s interesting and novel study, ‘Synaesthetic Iconography: 1. the Nâdiphântakrama’, in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, eds., <em>Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner</em>, Pondichéry: Institut Français de Pondichéry et Ecole Française d’Extrême-Orient, 2007, pp. 517–550. Note that the above paragraph on <em>mālinīnyāsa</em> was re-drafted in 2009.</p>
<p>94 Cf. the study of D.C. Sirkar, <em>The Śākta Pīṭhas</em> (JRASB letters, XIV, 1948, pp. 1–108 and MLBD). It is a presentation and edition of a text, the <em>Pīṭhanirṇaya</em>, or <em>Mahāpīṭhanirūpaṇa</em>.</p>
<p>A special number of the Hindi periodical <em>Kalyān</em> dedicated to pilgrimage (‘Tīrtā<em>ṅ</em>k’, Gorakhpur n.d.) gives (pp. 513–528) a list of 108 places of the cult of Śakti, then of the fifty-one <em>pīṭha</em> of the goddess, with a map and descriptions of the places, followed by a study of the secret <em>pīṭha</em> of the goddess: <em>śaktipīṭharahasya</em>.</p>
<p>The TĀ (15.81–98) enumerates the <em>pīṭha</em> ‘external’ or ‘internal’, that is, situated in the world or interiorised in different points of the physical or ‘subtle’ body.</p>
<p>95 The system of 108 <em>pīṭha</em> has in effect been taken over and adapted in the Vaiṣṇava tradition.</p>
<p>We may note, apropos of <em>pīṭhas</em>, that some texts (thus the ŚT 2.134 comm; vol. 1, p. 115) call the sixteen vowels <em>pīṭha</em>, as contrasted with the consonants then called <em>kṣetra</em>. We see here the connection between phonemes and space. Jayaratha, in fact, commenting on the first <em>śloka</em> of the VM where the goddess is described as assuming six aspects (Ganeśa, <em>rāśi</em> etc.) which are placed in the <em>ṣoḋhanyāsa</em>, stresses the point that the <em>pīṭhas</em> correspond to extension since the goddess also appears in this form (<em>deśrūpatayā</em>): ‘The Lord,’ says Abhinavagupta in the ĪPV 2.1,5, ‘manifests spatial succession by the diversity of forms (<em>mūrtivaicitrya</em>)’; this corresponds to the path of space (<em>deśādhvan</em>) in the theory of the six ways (TĀ 6.34–36).</p>
<p>The <em>diṅnyāsa</em>, the placing of the directions of space, which is a part of several rites, does not seem to be associated with the same notion since it consists in reciting the formulas of the <em>nyāsa</em> and showing a <em>mudrā</em> while turning to the eight directions of space in order to win the favour of the <em>devatās</em> of the directions; this is not really a <em>nyāsa</em>.</p>
<p>96 We also find a brief description in the <em>Mantramahodadhi</em> which concludes: <em>iti dehamaye pīṭhe dhyayet svābhīṣṭa-devatām</em>: ‘he should meditate his own deity on the seat which has become his body’. Also see <em>Tāriṇipārijāta</em> pp. 34–37, which enumerates the entities and mantras to be placed; <em>Tārarahasya</em> 3, p. 119; <em>Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati</em> 2.1–9; or a recent manual <em>Balārcanapaddhati</em> and so on.</p>
<p>97 That is to say, from the twenty-sixth to the thirty-fourth <em>tattva</em> in the system of thirty-six <em>tattvas</em> of Tantric Hinduism.</p>
<p>98 It is perhaps interesting, from the point of view of the range or psychology of the <em>nyāsa</em>, to mention here a poem cited in the <em>Principles of Tantra</em> (p. 1142), where the sixth verse, recalling the unity of the worshipper with the divinity he worships, adds: ‘otherwise, how does Nyāsa on Thy limbs affect Me or Nyāsa on my limbs affect Thee?’ ‘They are one and the same,’ comments A. Avalon, ‘and therefore when the sādhaka does Nyāsa on himself, he does Nyāsa on the Devatā also’ (ibid. note 4).</p>
<p>Another point of view, contemporary but undoubtedly exactly traditional in sentiment, is that of R.K. Ray <em>Encyclopedia of Yoga</em> (Varanasi, 1975) which, in relation to <em>pīṭhanyāsa</em>, writes: ‘Nyāsa is useful in effecting the proper distribution of the Śaktis of the human frame in their proper positions so as to avoid the production of discord and distractions in worship. The actions of Nyāsa on the body, finger and palms stimulate the nerve centres and nerves therein. Thus, for the attainment of that state in which a Sādhaka feels that the <em>Bhāva</em> (nature, disposition) of the Devatā has come upon him, Nyāsa is a great auxiliary. It is, as it were, the wearing of jewels on different parts of the body. The Bījas of the Devatā are the jewels which the Sādhaka places on different parts of his body. By Nyāsa he places his Abhiṣṭadevatā (Iṣṭa-devatā) in such parts, and by Vyāpaka-nyāsa (comprehensive Nyāsa) he spreads His presence through himself and he becomes permeated by Him, losing himself in the divine Self.’ (See too MNT 5.105 and passim; ŚT 6.1ff; <em>Prapañcasāra Tantra</em> p. 138 and passim; <em>Yoginī Tantra</em> 2.1.1 and passim).</p>
<p>99 The <em>nyāsa</em> can be made with a flower or blades of grass as said before – see p. 71.</p>
<p>100 SP1 (vol. 1, pp. 124–125): <em>darśayitvāmṛtīmudrām</em> ‘and one shows the <em>mudrā</em> which transforms into nectar’ (Brunner examines this problem in the introduction, p. xxxvi).</p>
<p>101 The <em>Tāriṇīpārijāta</em>, pp. 18–19, describes, after expounding the <em>bhūtaśuddhi</em>, a <em>jīvanyāsa</em> made with the <em>prāṇapratiṣṭhāmantra</em> of the goddess Tāriṇī along with a whole series of placings (<em>ṛṣyādi, kara, ṣaḋaṅga</em> etc.) with <em>dhyāna, japa</em> etc. The structure of the rites is the same as that of the <em>prāṇapratiṣṭhā</em> such as those found in diverse modern manuals (<em>Śrīkapadruma</em> or some other).</p>
<p>The <em>jīvanyāsa</em> is mentioned in the same way in the MNT (5.105). The adept places by this rite the divine breaths in his own body: <em>taddehe devyāḥ prāṇān nidhāpayet</em> (the commentary glosses <em>taddehe</em> by <em>tasmin navīne dehe</em>: ‘in this new body’, in this body renewed, transformed by the <em>bhūtaśuddhi</em>.</p>
<p>The same occurs in SP 1 (vol. 1 pp. 128–133).</p>
<p>102 The <em>vyāpakanyāsa</em> consists usually in passing the two hands several times on the entire body, from feet to head, while repeating the <em>mūlamantra</em> (see TBhS 5, p. 171). We have seen that this can also be done differently. But it always consists in the placing of a <em>mūlamantra</em>, or of a fundamental entity or diagram, on the entire body, which must be entirely impregnated and penetrated (<em>vyāpta</em>).</p>
<p>Cf. <em>Principles of Tantra</em> p. 1140: ‘and then by means of Vyāpaka, or comprehensive Nyāsa, to feel the presence of the devatā as one undivided entity whose substance is Mantra all over one’s body from the feet to the crown of the head’.</p>
<p>103 See, for example, the LT chapter 46: <em>pūjā</em> of the <em>laksmīmantra</em>. Three other chapters of this text (47, 48, 49) describe the cult of other mantras: the <em>nyāsas</em> are identical. For the <em>tārikā-mantra</em>, the principal mantra of the Tantra (chapters 42–43), different <em>nyāsas</em> are prescribed, but this is because there is no ‘external’ worship here but a <em>sādhana</em> where mental elements, visualisations, <em>japa</em>, and <em>mantrayoga</em>, play an essential role.</p>
<p>Other Vaiṣṇava examples include: the <em>pūjā</em> of <em>Vasudeva-mantra</em> with eleven <em>akṣara</em> in the <em>Varśakriyākaumudī</em> pp. 182f.; or the placings of the <em>mūlamantra</em> of eight and twelve <em>akṣara</em> in the <em>Sanatkumārasaṃhitā</em> I, <em>adhyaya</em> 9 (p. 72f. ed. Adyar, 1969).</p>

<h2 id="5-a-hindu-rosary-ritual">5 A Hindu rosary ritual</h2>
<p>1 The French original version of this paper, ‘Un rituel hindou du rosaire (<em>Jayākhyasaṃhitā</em>, chapitre 14)’ was published in the <em>Journal Asiatique</em>, CCLXXV, 1987, pp. 115–129.</p>
<p>2 Tantric texts are normally meant for the instruction of initiates, these being generally <em>sādhakas</em>, adepts looking for rewards or powers (<em>bubhukṣu</em>). On the <em>sādhaka</em>, H. Brunner’s study, ‘Le sādhaka, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’ (<em>J.As</em>, 1975, pp. 411–443), is still very much worth consulting. The Śaiva <em>sādhaka</em>- or <em>nirvāṇa-dīkṣ ā</em> is described in vol. 3 of H. Brunner’s edition of the <em>Somaśambhupaddhati</em> – SP (Pondichéry, 1977).</p>
<p>3 One may of course acquire a fully constituted rosary: this is what all non-initiates – the majority of devotees – do. But such a rosary must be consecrated before it is used.</p>
<p>4 Perhaps surprisingly in a Vaiṣṇava context, the <em>rudrākṣa</em>, the berries of Śiva’s tree, are considered the best ones.</p>
<p>5 Tantras usually count women and children among those seeking <em>mokṣa.</em></p>
<p>6 <em>Astra</em>, the Weapon mantra, is used in many ritual contexts, being placed (<em>nyāsta</em>) or ‘sprinkled’ (<em>saṃprokṣya</em>).</p>
<p>7 <em>saṃpūjya puṣpadhūpādyais tasya śuddhim athā caret</em> //28// <em>dagdham astreṇa saṃcintya varmaṇā māruteritam / āplavyamūlamantreṇa paramāmr̥tarūpiṇā</em> //29//. Astra and Varman are two of the six ‘limbs’ (<em>aṅga</em>) of Viṣṇu (or Śiva). Astra, the Weapon, is a divine destructive arrow. Varman, or Kavaca, the Cuirass, is protecting: it safeguards the purity given by the fire of the Astra deemed to burn away all impurities. Bathing and fanning are two of the usual services (<em>upacāra</em>) offered to a deity. We may note here the important role of mental representations in the Hindu cult, the <em>pūjā</em>, which is to a large extent a play of imagination.</p>
<p>8 <em>Caturbhujaṃ tu virajo nārāyanam ivāparam</em> //30// <em>varadābhayahastaṃ ca baddhāñjalidharaṃ smaret/brahmadvārasthitaṃ tac ca sūtraṃ dhyayecchikhopamam</em> //31//. The mentally conceived divine anthropomorphic figure of the rosary is imagined as bearing it also on its head as is the case of the <em>āyudhapuruṣas</em> who represent symbolically the ‘arms’ of a deity and bear them on their heads.</p>
<p>9 On the ritual for the Tantric worship of a deity, see SP, vol. 1, pp. 90ff.</p>
<p>10 On the <em>uddhāra</em> of mantras, see the first paper, above,</p>

<p>14 <em>sr̥ṣṭikrameṇa</em>, since the power of the deity is entering the image of the rosary, a process analogous to that of the cosmic process of emanation (<em>sr̥ṣṭi</em>).</p>

<p>21 The four stages from thought to action thus correspond to the planes of consciousness, from <em>turya</em> to <em>jāgrat</em>. The inverse movement is that of the return from discursive waking state to pure inner consciousness.</p>
<p>22 <em>smaraṇa</em> is not mere remembrance or memory. It is a recalling to mind and a mental concentration on a thought or on a mantra. In the Trika, <em>smaraṇa</em> is used to designate the intuitive consciousness of the highest Reality. In the PTV (p. 245), Abhinavagupta glosses <em>smarati</em> with <em>anusaṃdhatte</em>, that is, one-pointed attention. This sense given to <em>smarati</em> goes back to the ancient meaning of <em>SMR̥</em>: on this, see L. Silburn, <em>Instant et Cause</em> (Paris: Vrin, 1955, pp. 374–346).</p>

<p>25 Such a rite for the so-called ‘outer worship’ (<em>bāhyayāga</em>) of the deity is described in chapter 13 (ś<em>l</em>. 100ff.) of the JS. A similar ritual is to be found in the Śaiva context – (see for instance the SP1 – similitude due to the fact that the Pāñcarātra was strongly influenced by shaivism.</p>
<p>26 This is carefully described in <em>śl.</em> 73–76a. It appears to be done by a particular movement of the thumb which moves the rosary along the finger (the index, normally) on which it rests, the counting going on in the same sense. To avoid crossing the Meru, other texts prescribe counting the beads alternatively in one sense and then in the reverse.</p>
<p>27 There are variant lists of these acts, some including nine acts. On the <em>ṣaṭkarmāṇI</em>, see T. Goudriaan’s study, <em>Māyā Divine and Human</em>, already quoted, pp. 251–412.</p>
<p>28 The passage I allude to is as follows: « <em>paradehepraveśe ca tattvānāṃpreraṇe dvija/ krūrakarmaṇī siddhyarthaṃ japo jyotirmayas smr̥taḥ</em> // 79// <em>tatrāntarlīnam amalaṃ śabdaṃ tu paribhāvayet / bhuktimuktiprasiddhyarthaṃ doṣaduhkhakṣayaṅkaram</em> //80// <em>śāntau tu sarvakāryāṇāṃ siddhyartham avicārataḥ / sukhasaubhāgyasiddhyarthaṃ tataḥ ‘py ādhānakarmaṇi</em> //81// <em>japo bhavati śabdākhyas tatrāntaras tu vibhāvayet / niśāmbukaṇasaṅkāśaprakāśātma janārdana</em> //82// <em>hr̥tpadmāt tu svamantreṇa bhāvayeccchabdam utthitam / nityoditaṃtu tenaiva prayatnarahiteṇa tu</em> //83// <em>praṇāpannapadasthena bhāvanāmiṣritena / japyamānas tu vai mantras sarvakāmaphala pradaḥ</em> //84//.</p>
<p>29 In all ritual worship, the deity first installed in the icon by the rite of <em>āvahana</em> so as to be worshipped is removed from the ritual icon by the <em>visarjana</em> rite, once the worship is over. The same process is used for the rosary. The mantra being used is: <em>OṂ bhagavanmantramūrte svapadam āsādya kṣamasva kṣamasva OṂ namo namaḥ.</em></p>
<p>30 This mantra is: <em>OṂ ḤRŪṂ VAUṂ viṣvakṣenāya namaḥ.</em></p>

<h2 id="6-on-the-defects-and-the-perfecting-of-mantras">6 On the defects and the perfecting of mantras</h2>
<p>1 A paper on the same subject was published as pp. 499–510 of the <em>Pandit N.R. Bhatt Felicitation Volume</em>, P-S. Filliozat, S.P. Narang and G.P. Bhatta, eds., Delhi, 1994.</p>
<p>2 On this dual aspect of mantras, see Hélène Brunner’s study ‘Mantras et <em>mantras</em> dans les Tantras śivaïtes’ in <em>Le parole e i marmi. Studi in onore di Raniero Gnoli nel suo 70° compleano</em>, Raffaele Torella et al., Rome: IIAO, 2001, pp. 183–212.</p>
<p>3 See Introduction, p. 95, and the next chapter.</p>
<p>4 On this tantra of the śākta Yāmala tradition (existing only in manuscript form), and on its commentaries, see A. Sanderson ‘The Sulva Exegesis of Kashmir’ in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, <em>Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner</em>, Pondichéry, 2007, pp. 231–424. On this tantra, and on the (perhaps thirteenth century) <em>Mantramuktāvali</em>, as well as on the ŚT, see also T. Goudriaan and S. Gupta, <em>Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature</em>, Wiesbaden, 1981, pp. 49, 134–137,</p>
<p>5 1.75–78 refers to the Tantrik Texts edition of the TRT (reprint Delhi, 1981); 1.73–81 to the edition of its first chapter with the Sudarśana commentary of Prāṇamañjarī (Calcutta, 1940). This Tantrarāja is a different text from the tantra quoted by Abhinavagupta in the Tantrāloka as Tantrarājabhaṭṭāraka, which is the 24.000 <em>śloka Jayadrathayāmala</em>.</p>
<p>6 The absence of <em>aṃśa</em> is a serious defect since, as we have seen previously (see chapter 2, pp. 19–21, on <em>mantravicāra</em>, a mantra can only be made use of by a <em>sādhaka</em> if there is an <em>aṃśa.</em></p>
<p>7 This is a different case from that of a mantra which is ‘asleep’ without being defective, and is to be ‘awakened’ before being made use of.</p>
<p>8 See Introduction, pp. 3–4.</p>
<p>9 On these practices, see the next chapter.</p>
<p>10 According to the <em>Śivārcanacandrikā</em>, the mantra in such a case is purified by repeating it thrice whilst raising the <em>kuṇḋalinī</em> and then doing a <em>pūjā</em> to the devatā.</p>
<p>11 See <em>Agnipurāṇa</em>, chapter 292 or Tārābhaktisudhārṇava (p. 324) quoting the <em>Rudrayāmala</em>.</p>
<p>12 This tantra is perhaps the same as the <em>Mahocchuṣma</em> quoted by Jayaratha in his Viveka on TĀ 1.18 as one of the eight Brahmayāmalatantras (<em>ibid</em>. vol. 1, p. 42), a group of texts where Kapālīśabhairava has Mahocchuṣmā among the four goddesses of his retinue (see A. Sanderson, ‘Saivism and the Tantric traditions’, in C. Carrithers et al. eds, <em>The Category of the Person</em>, London, 1988, pp. 660–704).</p>
<p>13 It is unclear how this is to be done.</p>
<p>14 On this term, see chapter 7, p. 96.</p>
<p>15 The term <em>mātr̥kā</em> for the letters of the alphabet is used when their nature of powers (<em>śakti</em>) is to be underlined – for instance, when they are ritually placed on the body by <em>nyāsa</em>.</p>
<h2 id="7-mantric-practices-and-the-nature-of-mantric-utterance">7 Mantric practices and the nature of mantric utterance</h2>
<p>1 The author is grateful to the authorities of the Kuppuswami Research Institute in Chennai for permission to reprint this article which first appeared in vols. LVI–LXII, 1986–92, of the <em>Journal of Oriental Research</em>, Madras, 1992 (pp. 65–76). This version includes, when necessary, a few corrections and emendations to the original text; the references given in the notes have, when necessary, been updated.</p>
<p>2 The NT, with Kṣemarāja’s <em>Uddyota</em>, was published as vols. 16 and 61 of the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies (KSTS), Bombay, 1926–1939. This edition is reprinted in one volume edited with an introduction by V.V. Dvivedi, Delhi: Parimal Publications, 1985.</p>
<p>3 On this practice, see the entry on <em>pratyaṅgira</em> of the <em>Tāntrikābhidhānakośa</em> (TAK), vol. 3 (forthcoming).</p>
<p>4 These nine practices are as follows: <em>dīpana, bodhana, tāḋana, abhiṣecana, vimalikaraṇa, indhananiveśana, santarpaṇa, guptībhāva and āpyāya.</em> This list is partly the same as that of the usual ten <em>mantrasaṃskāras</em> used to counteract the <em>mantradoṣas</em> quoted, for instance, in the <em>Śāradātilaka</em> 2.112–123, or in the <em>Kuārṇavatantra</em>: on the subject, see here chapter 6.</p>
<p>5 The action of encasing is <em>sampuṭīkaraṇa/kr̥iti</em>, a term used more often, I believe, metaphorically, especially in the Trika, to describe the mutual encasement (that is, the conjunction or fusion) of two metaphysical entities, usually Śiva and Śakti. It is also used to express the mutual inherence of Śiva and the cosmos (see MVT 11.07; TĀ 3.205–206; <em>Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa</em>, pp. 264–265, etc.). The term is used in the NṢA (1.29–30) to describe the coincidence of the first two (inner) triangles of the <em>śrīcakra</em>: one identified with Śiva, the other with Śakti.</p>
<p>6 These two works are the same text under two different names: <em>Vāmake</em>ś<em>varīmata</em>a, with the commentary of Rājanaka Jayaratha, KSTS, LXVI, Srinagar, 1945. <em>Nity</em>ā<em>ṣoḋaśikārṇava</em>, with two commentaries, <em>R̥ijuvimaśinī</em> of Śivānanda and <em>Artharatnāvalī</em> of Vidyānanda, edited by V.V. Dvidedi, Varanasi, 1968.</p>
<p>7 This is a magical practice: <em>cakra, bīja</em> and letters are to be inscribed on gold leaf to be worn as a protective amulet (<em>rakṣā</em>).</p>
<p>8 The meaning of <em>grasta</em> in this context is not to be linked with its meaning in grammar/phonetics, where it is a fault of pronunciation due to the utterance of a letter hindered or held back at the throat – cf.<em>R̥kprātiśakya</em> XIV,3: <em>jihvāmūlavigrahe grastam etat.</em></p>
<p>9 In their commentaries on NṢA or VMT, Śivānanda and Vidyānanda explain: <em>aṅkuśaḥ kromkāraḥ.</em></p>
<p>10 This is clearly stated in Prāṇamañjarī’s commentary on TRT 1.72 where she describes several practices and says that there are still other ones. Cf. TRT with the commentary <em>Sudarśana</em> of Prāṇamañjarī critically edited for the first time by Jatindrabimal Chaudhury, Calcutta, 1940. Prāṇamañjarī lived in Varanasi in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>11 See ‘Un terme technique de <em>mantraśāstra, vidarbha</em>’, <em>JAs</em>, CCLXV (1977), pp. 345–349.</p>
<p>12 These are usually <em>pallava, yoga, rodha, grathana, sampuṭa</em> and <em>vidarbha</em> (order of the PheṭK). The longer list of the NT originates perhaps – like the one previously given of nine mantric practices – in the <em>Ucchuṣmatantra</em>, that is, in an earlier stratum of Tantric texts.</p>
<p>13 In the PTV, p. 243 – see above, Introduction, p. 8 and note 17.</p>
<p>14 On the nature of mantras as well as on the non-dualistic Śaiva conceptions of the word, refer to my <em>Vāc. The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras</em> (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990; Indian edition, Delhi: Satguru Publications, 1992), and to H.P. Alper, ed., <em>Understanding Mantras</em> (Albany: SUNY Press, 1988), which includes an – at that date – exhaustive bibliography on the subject.</p>
<p>15 On <em>nyā</em>sa, see here chapter 4.</p>
<p>16 The YH with Amr̥tānanda’s commentary, the <em>Dīpikā</em>, was edited by V.V. Dvivedi, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1998. I refer here to this edition which is the only reliable Indian edition of this work. French translation with introduction and notes by André Padoux: <em>Le coeur de la Yoginī</em>, Yoginīhr̥daya, <em>avec le commentaire</em> Dīpikā <em>d’Amr̥tānanda</em>, Paris: Collège de France, 1994.</p>
<p>17 An explanatory note with a drawing of the <em>kāmakalā</em> is given on p. 202 of my translation of the YH. On the <em>kāmakalā</em>, and especially its sexual connotations, see David G. White, <em>Kiss of the Yoginī. ‘Tantric Sex’ in its South Asian Context</em>, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2000.</p>
<p>18 We saw above (p. 97) a <em>nyāsa</em>, on the image of the goddess Tripurasundarī, of her <em>mūlavidyā, aṅkuśena vidarbhitā</em>: intersected and bound up with the <em>aṅkuśabīja KROṂ</em>.</p>
<p>19 This is Sarasvatī, also called Vāgīṣī. The name Lipidevī, however, implies that this is a <em>written</em> alphabet goddess. Sarasvatī, in fact, holds a book in one of her hands; the written word is thus associated with her, on the divine plane.</p>
<p>20 It is described in several tantras, the <em>Siddhayogeśvarīṃata, Mālinīvijayottara, Kubjik</em>ā<em>mata</em>, in the PTV, as well as in the AgP 145.</p>
<p>21 On the Mālinī, see the <em>ṇādiphānta</em> entry of the TAK, vol. 3. An interpretive study of this letter-deity is that of Somdev Vasudeva, ‘Synaesthetic Iconography: 1. The N. ādiphāntakrama’, which quotes several texts, published in D. Goodall and A. Padoux, eds., <em>Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner/Tantric Studies in Memory of Hélène Brunner</em>, Pondichéry: Institut Français de Pondichéry, 2007, pp. 517–550.</p>
<p>22 This is described in Jayaratha’s commentary on TĀ 3.67. On this, see my <em>Vāc</em> (quoted above, note 14), pp. 241–243.</p>
<p>23 On these diagrams, see the appendix of J.A. Schoterman’s edition of the <em>Ṣaṭsāhasrasaṃhitā, op cit</em>.</p>
<p>24 On <em>mantroddhāra</em> and the quest for <em>aṃśa</em>, I wrote an article published in the <em>BEFEO</em> 65, 1978, an English (revised) version of which is published here as chapter 2.</p>
<p>25 On should perhaps underline in this respect that the same Sanskrit term, <em>pāṭha</em>, is used for reading and for reciting. The coalescence of these two meanings is interesting, and is surely not accidental.</p>
<p>26 Transposed in another civilisation where the written sign is fundamental, mantras have evolved differently, as instanced by the <em>siddham</em> script of the Japanese Shingon sect, where Sanskrit <em>bījas</em> are used in meditation very much like Chinese characters. See on this R.H. van Gulik, <em>Siddham. An Essay on the History of Sanskrit Studies in China and Japan</em>, New Delhi: Sharada Rani, 1980.</p>
<p>ADDENDA 2009: On the nature of mantras and especially on the oral/written relationship, see A. Padoux, ‘L’oral et l’écrit. mantra et <em>mantraśāstra</em>’, translated here as chapter 9.</p>
<p>On the role of writing in India, see Charles Malamoud, ‘Noirceur de l’écriture. Remarques sur un thème littéraire de l’Inde ancienne’, in <em>Paroles à dire, paroles à écrire</em>, Paris: Editions de l’EHESS, 1997, pp. 85–114.</p>
<h2 id="8-body-and-mantra-mantras-in-the-human-body">8 Body and mantra: mantras in the human body</h2>
<p>1 In this paper I take up again, but more briefly, a subject on which I wrote an article</p>
<p>‘Corps et mantra. De la présence des mantras dans le corps’ published in Oscar Botto, <em>et al</em>, eds., <em>Du corps humain, au carrefour de plusieurs savoirs en Inde. Mélanges offerts à Arion Roṣu par ses collègues et ses amis à l’occasion de son 80e anniversaire</em>, Bucarest et Paris, 2004, pp.563–578.</p>
<p>2 On this important notion, see Paul Schilder’s classical work on the subject: <em>The Image and Appearance of the Human Body</em>, first published in 1935.</p>
<p>3 One says, too, that the yogin attains a state of mantra: <em>mantratvam.</em></p>
<p>4 This important text of the Pāñcarātra contains many ritual prescriptions. It was edited in the Gaekwad Oriental Series (vol. 54), Baroda, 1967. See on this Marion Rastelli, <em>Philosophisch-theologische Grundanschauungen des Jayākhyasaṃhitā. mit einer Darstellung des Täglichen Rituals</em>, Vienna, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1999. Though very interesting, this text has not been translated.</p>
<p>5 This mental worship is studied and carefully commented upon in chapter 12 of the thesis of M. Rastelli, quoted in the preceding note.</p>
<p>6 There are, as far as I know, no serious systematic studies of Hindu <em>mudrās</em> used in ritual. On a particular Tantric case, see A. Padoux, ‘The body in Tantric ritual: the case of the mudrās’, in T. Goudriaan, ed., <em>The Sanskrit Tradition and Tantrism</em>, Leiden, 1990, pp. 60–75.</p>
<p>7 This assertion is to be qualified, for a deity can very well be conceived as being ‘made of’ letters only. The mantra-god Navātman, for instance, is made up of the nine phonemes <em>HSKŚMLVRYŪṂ</em>, A Tantric deity having always one or several ‘faces’ (<em>vaktra</em>) and ‘members’ (<em>aṅga</em>), its mantric form will also include theses additions, which will also be made up of phonemes – see TĀ 30.15–16a. Are we faced, then, with mental images or with mentally evoked phonetic enunciations? As for Navātman, this god is also described as a beautiful young man, associated with different goddesses, notably the hunchbacked goddess Kubjikā: what is evoked in his case? The anthropomorphic figure, or the syllabic enunciation? On the <em>navātman</em> mantra, see the <em>navātman</em> entry of the TĀK, vol. 3.</p>
<p>8 On this, see the <em>Somaśambupaddhati</em>, vol. 3, edited and translated in French by Hélène Brunner (Pondicherry, 1977), on the Śaiva initiations. Plates in the appendix to that book show how such cosmic elements are placed on the body of the initiand.</p>
<p>9 Such, for instance, as those illustrating the <em>Ṣaṭcakranirūpaṇa</em> edited by A. Avalon as <em>The Serpent Power, being the Shat-Chakra-Nirūpana and Pādukāpañcaka</em>, Madras: Ganesh &amp; Co., 1953.</p>
<p>10 The process is described in full detail by M. Rastelli, in pp. 246–270 of her study <em>Philosophisch-theologische Grundanschauungen der Jayākhyāsaṃhitā</em> (Vienna, 1999).</p>
<p>11 This mental rite is studied by A. Sanderson: ‘Meaning in Tantric ritual’, in A.M. Blondeau and Fr. Schipper, eds., <em>Essais sur le rituel</em> III, Paris: Bibliothèque des Hautes Etudes, Sciences Religieuses, vol. CII, pp. 15–95.</p>
<p>12 This worship of the goddesses is described and commented by A. Sanderson, ‘Maṇḋala and Āgamic Identity in the Trika of Kashmir’, in A. Padoux, ed., <em>Mantras et diagrammes rituels dans l’hindouisme</em> (Paris 1986), with a drawing showing the body of the adept drawn by Stefanie Sanderson – printed again on p. 308 of the 1999 reprint of R. Gnoli’s translation of the TĀ (Milano: Adelphi, 1999).</p>
<p>13 I am not sure ‘lived body’ is good English – probably not. What I wish to refer to here is the distinction put forward by Max Scheler (and taken over by existential psychoanalysis, the Daseinanalyse) between the <em>Leib</em>, the body as it is experienced, lived, and the <em>Körper</em>, which is the perceived, physical, anatomic body; both of course are never separated – one does not ‘live’ merely with one’s physical body.</p>
<p>14 On <em>uccāra</em>, see the entry on this word in vol.1 of the TĀK. <em>prāṇa</em> is not the respiratory breath, but a ‘subtle’ inner vital ‘breath’. L. Renou defined it as ‘l’aspect vital de l’<em>ātman</em>’. On this subject, see the entry <em>prāṇa</em> of the TĀK.</p>
<p>15 In S. Gupta, D.J Hoens, T. Goudriaan, <em>Hindu Tantrism</em> (Leiden, 1979). Though purely imaginary, the yogic body, being ‘intraposed’ within the anatomic body, is both very largely delineated on it and linked to it when its aspect and functioning are visualised: all this ‘happens in the body’. This authorises some – Mircea Eliade, for instance – to speak in such a case of ‘physiologie mystique’: the expression is debatable, but it underlines well the link, the interaction of those two ‘bodies’.</p>
<p>16 This important tantra is often quoted or referred to by Abhinavagupta. It deals mostly with the cult of mantra-goddesses possessing magical powers. A shorter version of this work was edited and translated in English by Judit Törzsök for an Oxford (unpublished) thesis. A fuller edition is now expected.</p>
<p>17 The SvT describes this in the cosmic and soteriological perspective of the six ‘ways’ (<em>adhvan</em>).</p>
<p>18 The NT completes the series of twelve <em>kalās</em> with those from <em>nādānta to unmanā</em> as corresponding to different, ever higher, planes of the deity. A precise and very usefully commented description of this passage of the NT is given by Hélène Brunner in her study of that tantra: ‘Un tantra du nord: le Netratantra’, <em>BEFEO</em>, LXI (1974), pp. 125–197.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><em>kūṭatraye mahādevi kuṇḋalinītraye ‘pi ca</em>/</p>
<p><em>cakranāṃ pūrvapūrveṣāṃ nādarūpeṇa yojanam</em>//</p>
<p>20 For the <em>Yoginīhr̥daīya</em>, as for many Śaiva texts, the <em>kuṇḋalinī</em> is considered as comprising three sections: igneous, solar and lunar. The first, igneous, section starting from the lowest <em>cakra</em>, the second part, solar, extends from the heart-<em>cakra</em> to the <em>bhrūmadhya</em>, where begins the third one. To this threefold division corresponds that of the ś<em>rīvidyā</em>; it is also present in the nine <em>cakras</em> constituting the <em>śrīcakra</em> which are also distributed into three groups. During the <em>japa</em>, all these three groups are brought together by the ascent of the <em>nāda</em> which prolongs the <em>uccāra</em> of the three <em>HRĪṂ.</em></p>
<p>21 For the Śaiva cultic practice as described in the āgamas (and as it is still, in some cases, performed in India today), see R.H. Davis, <em>Ritual in an Oscillating Universe. Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991. We, of course, do not know if a real mystical union with the deity in ritual was current among Śaiva adepts in the tenth to fourteenth centuries. We know, on the other hand, that officiants often limit themselves to the mere enunciation of the prescribed mantras – mantraprayoga – without trying to do anything else than follow formally the prescriptions of the ritual handbooks: this is indeed very far from the world of the ancient texts – but we do not know much about that world.</p>
<p>22 The big toe of the right foot is the spot where Kālāgni, the (destructive) Fire of Time which burns the cosmos to cinders, comes forth. We see here that the destruction of the body of the adept is foreseen.</p>
<p>23 The <em>cakras or granthis</em>, spots, ‘nods’ where the power, the <em>prāṇa</em>, concentrates are in a way obstacles for they are thresholds to be passed. This is why, to progress, they are to be cut or pierced: <em>granthiccheda</em>. See the entries on these terms in the TĀK, vol. 2.</p>
<p>24 On <em>khecara</em> and the state of being <em>khecara</em> (<em>khecaratā/khecaratva</em>), see the corresponding entries of the TĀK, vol. 2,</p>

<p>2 They are, in fact, deities: Tantric pantheons are pantheons of mantras.</p>
<p>3 On the ‘circulation’ of a mantra in the <em>nāḋīs</em>, see, for instance, chapter 7 of the NT which describes the ‘subtle meditation’ (<em>sūkṣmadhyāna</em>) of the Netramantra <em>OṂ JUṂ SAḤ</em>. This mantric practice is briefly described in Brunner, 1974, and Padoux, 1990, pp. 411–406.</p>
<p>4 The recordings on cassettes (or otherwise) of the mantras of the <em>pūjā</em> that one finds nowadays in India show another aspect of the ‘vulgarisation’ of mantras. The ritual formulas of the usual daily Hindu worship, however, are not secret – differing in this from those for the worship of esoteric Tantric deities.</p>
<p>5 We must not forget, on this subject, that silent, purely visual, reading is a comparatively modern usage. Earlier, reading was pronouncing, thus giving back to the oral its rightful place. See Ong, 1982.</p>
<p>6 <em>uddhāra:</em> from <em>ud-DHR̥</em>, take out, raise up, select, extract, See, here, chapter 2 on the extraction and selection of mantras.</p>
<p>7 On prastaras and gahvaras, see J.G. Schoterman, <em>The Satsahasrasamhita</em>, Brill, 1982.</p>
<p>8 On the rites through which an adept – a <em>sādhaka</em> – masters the mantra he has received, see Brunner 1974a, pp. 411–443.</p>
<p>9 On these rites, see here chapter 2, pp. 18–22.</p>
<p>10 That is, the imaginary structure of centres (<em>cakra</em>) and channels (<em>nāḋī</em>) conceived as present in the physical body. It is usually, but wrongly, called ‘subtle body’; the subtle body (<em>sūkṣma</em>- or <em>liṅgaśarīra</em>) properly so-called being something else.</p>
<p>11 On this sense of <em>dhyāna</em>, see the entry on that word in the TAK, vol. 3 which refers to G. Bühneman, <em>The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities</em> (two vol., Groningen. Egbert Forsten, 2000–2001). By <em>nyāsa</em> one may also place divine entities, cosmic divisions, <em>yantras</em> or <em>cakras</em>, etc.</p>
<p>12 When tantras, etc., name a mantra, they generally quote the <em>r̥ṣi</em> who has first ‘seen’ it, its metre (<em>chandas</em>) – which gives it a ‘vedic’ air – then the deity (<em>devatā</em>) it expresses, and the syllable which is its seed (<em>bīja</em>). To these are sometimes added the power (<em>śakti</em>), the point (<em>kīlaka</em>) and the use (<em>viniyoga</em>) of the mantra.</p>
<p>13 A triangle (point down) is the symbol of the goddess, of the feminine. The phoneme <em>E</em> is thus in essence the locus of creation – and of bliss. It is, Jayaratha says (<em>ad</em>, TĀ 3.94), the ‘mouth of the Yoginī’ (<em>yoginīvaktra</em>) where one receives initiation and experiences the bliss of liberation. But <em>vaktra</em>, in this case, is not the mouth, but the sexual organ of the Yoginī, where the yogin in sexual union with his ritual partner attains bliss and fusion with the Absolute. The deity, in this case, is above all form, whilst being also (at least metaphysically) triangular.</p>
<p>This sort of practice is described in chapter 29 of the <em>Tantrāloka</em> – on which see Silburn, <em>Kundalinī. The Energy of the Depths</em>, Albany, 1988.</p>
<p>14 On the <em>uccāra</em> of <em>OṂ</em>, see Padoux, 1990, chap. 7, pp. 402–411. On the <em>kāmakalā</em>, see Punyānanda’s <em>Kāmakalāvilāsa</em>, edited and translated by A. Avalon, or, for a study and interpretation of this diagram, David G. White, ‘Transformation in the Art of Love. Kāmakalā Practices in Hindu Tantric and Kaula Traditions,’ <em>History of Religions</em>, 18/2, 1998, pp. 172–198.</p>
<p>15 Buddhist <em>dhāraṇis</em> were translated in Chinese, written therefore since the fourth century. But the cult and homage paid to the <em>sūtras</em> as holy ‘Scripture’ seem to have existed earlier in the Mahāyāna traditions. The most marked cult of the Book is that of the Sikh <em>Adigranth</em>, but it is by reciting it that it is honoured and that a beneficial result is produced. See Dusenbery 1992.</p>
<p>In the Hindu field, a purāṇa, as a book or, better, in manuscript, may be honoured. Such is the case notably of the <em>Devīmāhatmya</em>: see Coburn, 1991.</p>
<p>16 On the <em>mantiravatis</em>, see Diehl, 1956.</p>
<p>17 On the <em>anārthakya</em> (lack of meaning) of mantras, see Renou, 1960, specially, pp. 70ff.</p>
