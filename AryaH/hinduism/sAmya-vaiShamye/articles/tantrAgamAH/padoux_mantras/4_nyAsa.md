The ritual placing of mantras*1*





In practice, mantras are nearly always used in the context of ritual, indispensable, as we have seen, to their extraction or selection, to their transmission, or to their efficacy in action. We intend here to inquire into one ritual practice, that of *nyāsa*.

The word *nyāsa* is formed from the prefix *ni* \(‘below’, ‘under’\) and the verbal root *AS* \(‘to throw’, ‘to project’\) – from which the verb *NYAS, nyāsati*, to throw, to project, is derived along with the masculine substantive *nyāsa*, translated in Monier-Williams *Sanskrit–English Dictionary* as ‘putting down or in, placing, fixing, inserting, applying … drawing, painting, writing down … depositing, intrusting, delivering … mental appropriation or assignment of various parts of the body to tutelary deities’ – a diversity of definitions one also finds in the St Petersburg Dictionary: ‘niedersetzen, hinsetzen, aufsetzen … das Auftragen mysticher Zeichen auf verschiedene Teile des Körpers’. P.V. Kane \(*History of Dharmaśāstra*, vol. V.2, p. 1120\) writes: ‘*nyāsa* … means mentally invoking a god or gods, mantras and holy texts to come to occupy certain parts of the body in order to render the body a pure and fit receptacle for worship and meditation’. He adds a little further on: ‘The *Kulārṇava* explains it as follows: “*nyāsa* is so called because therein riches that are acquired in a righteous way are deposited or placed with persons, whereby all-round protection is got”’ \(*nyayoparjitavittanām aṅgeṣu viniveśanāt/sarvarakṣakarād devi nyāsa ityabhidhīyate*\) \(KT 18.56, p. 352\).

We can also cite Bhāskararāya who, in his commentary on the *Lalitasahasranāma* \(*śl*. 4\) defines *nyāsa* as the placing of divinities on different parts of the body, this placing being made through mental concentration \(*bhāvanā*\): *nyāso nāma tattaddevatānāṃ tattadavayaveṣvavasthāpanam, avasthitvena bhāvaneti yāvat*.2

We can see emerging in these definitions – apart from the ordinary, banal sense of the word ‘to place’, ‘to deposit’ – different meanings or nuances which appear in the *mantraśāstra* and which we shall meet here later, meanings that are all around the notion of placing or depositing on the body or on an object a mantra or some other sign that brings the presence of a deity, the transmission of a subtle or ritual entity, of an energy or spiritual power. This transference is accomplished by placing – generally but not necessarily – the fingers, hand, or hands on the part of the body, or on the object or substance, where the entity must penetrate and by which placing it is transformed. The operation is thus both mental and corporeal.

*Nyāsa* is usually considered to be a rite typical of Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism, since it is used for the manipulations and assimilations into the body of the sacred that are characteristically tantric. We find indeed a considerable variety of such practices in all ritual texts, in the tantras, āgamas and so on, as in the treatises on yoga and spiritual practices \(see the *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\) by Abhinavagupta for example\). The word itself in this technical sense, however, hardly ever occurs before the āgamic and purānic works \(which are already ‘tantricised’\), nor does it occur in ancient Buddhist texts. Some placings are prescribed in relatively ancient ritual works whose spirit is not Tantric. One thinks here of the Gṛhyasūtras and above all their *pariśiṣṭa* \(thus, for example, the *Baudhayānagṛhyasūtra* II, 18 or IV, 7 which does not use the word *nyāsa* but *sam-spṛś*\), or a number of *stotras*. Moreover, as is the case for other practices and words, we can hardly base an argument about their origins on the silence of the texts: these practices could well have existed before being textually attested. We are therefore permitted to think that these are elements from very ancient times that certainly existed in one form or another in a non-Tantric context well before the tantras and āgamas.3

The practice of transmitting a spiritual or magical force by touching not only exists in Hinduism and Buddhism \(Tantric or not\) but also in other Indian religions. It is almost universal.4 We find a number of examples in the Judeo-Christian tradition where we have the transference of the sins of Israel to a scapegoat \(Lv., XVI, 21\), the transmitting of the spirit of wisdom \(Deut., XXXIV, 18\), or the bestowing of the holy spirit on the apostles through the laying on of hands \(Acts, VIII, 18–19\), etc. We find analogous acts in other traditions along with speculation on magical power or the symbolism of the hands and the symbolic value of gesture.5 *Nyāsa* is one case among others, however with the particular association of belief in the power of gesture and in the efficacy of speech such as developed in India.6

The *nyāsa*, then, can appear as a gesture in support of speech, as a gestural and corporeal participation in speech. The act of placing carries and posits on a point of the body – or on an object, although this is less frequent and the object is usually an image of the corporeal aspect of a deity – a mantra which will impregnate this body or object with its energy thereby transforming or divinising it.

We have already noted in this regard, and we will return to this later, first that the hand which performs the *nyāsa* is itself often the object of a preliminary *nyāsa* \(*karanyāsa*\) which purifies it and charges it with a force that it can transmit.7 This hand must make a particular gesture – a *mudrā* – when it imposes a mantra, ‘sealing’ it thus as it were on the proper place. We could here raise the question of the origin of the *mudrās* which, like mantra and *nyāsa*, are both typical of Tantric ritual and probably as old as the religions of India. But there is also the problem of the deep connection between mantra and *mudrā*, between gesture and speech.8 Finally, if one is interested in the archaeology of signs, there is the problem of the first origins of the link and that of the precedence of one element over the other: in the beginning was there word or action …? Many questions we cannot tackle here; we simply note that they exist.

But the problem of *nyāsa* – we repeat – must not be limited to ritual touching, which is an important aspect, certainly, but not the only one. In so far as *nyāsa* consists in placing divine entities on \(or in\) the body, in divinising or cosmising it, and, by transforming it, in giving it a role in the cosmic and/or9 divine dimension of such acts as the *pūjā*, yoga or Tantric meditation, we find ourselves in the complex Indian problematic of the relationship or connections of body– universe–divinities–God. We know that this universal, total vision of the whole mass of cosmic manifestation, is very ancient. Tantrism insofar as it underlines and organises – or re-organises – these correspondences, refers back to a vedic conception: ‘All the gods reside in the human body as the cows in a cowshed’ says the *Atharvaveda* \(AV XI, 8, 32\). We can add that in this ancient and always persistent Indian conception, if the body reproduces the structure of the cosmos, the cosmos in turn is modelled on the human body,10 both being governed by a principle, at the human \(*ātman*\) or cosmic \(*puruṣa*\) level, which is, in essence, identified with the Brahman to which one is eventually to achieve identification through asceticism without leaping over the intermediate stages, notably that of the gods. Hence the usefulness of *nyāsa*11 as a means to achieve this identification.

The *nyāsa*, as all the practices of Tantric yoga focused on the body, underlines its importance in achieving liberation. In a system of thought in which there is no total distinction between the human condition and other states of existence \(animal, notably, but also divine\), it is often underlined that only in the human body can liberation be attained: this is one more justification of corporeal ritual practices – practices which must be understood in the context of another basic Indian conception of humankind: the absence, namely, of a division between the bodily and the mental, or between gross \(*sthūla*\) and subtle \(*sūkṣma*\); the difference between them being one of level rather than one of nature. Man is thus not separated from the cosmos, which itself emanates from a divinity that operates in the fashion of a yogin, the whole being founded on an absolute without form, at the same time transcendent and immanent. Such a man, too, from the highest level of his individual consciousness to his physical body, is constituted by more or less subtle ‘bodies’, namely causal, gross, subtle bodies \(*kārana, sūkṣma* and *sthūla śarīra*\) whose structures correspond. Thus, if *nyāsa* is made by human hands on the body’s surface, the effect of this action which is mainly mental or spiritual bears as much, or even more, on the subtle body than on the gross body. This appears clearly in the case of placings \(*antarmātṛkanyāsa*, for example\) done on the *cakra*s, which do not have a physical reality but are ‘localisations’ in the gross body of elements of the \(so-called\) ‘subtle body’,12 as we shall see later.

We shall also see *nyāsas* associated with Tantric yoga, which, while using physical methods, rests theoretically as in its practical application on the ‘mystical physiology’ of the *cakra*s and *nāḋis* where circulate the various currents of *prāṇa*, the ‘breaths’, whose nature is both bodily and subtle, and also cosmic insofar as *prāṇa* is a form of divine energy \(*śakti*\).13 We could say that we are here in a psychosomatic domain, were it not that this term implies a dichotomy between *psyche* and *soma* which India ignores and always adds a cosmic dimension.

But if the *nyāsa* is in practice, and most often in the *mantraśāstra*, the placing of phonic elements on the body, we must not lose sight of the fact that in ritual, where their usage is so frequent, *nyāsas* serve also to place divinities or entities on the instruments of worship or on various points of the ritual area. That is, they also appear as a way of placing materially \(if one can say this in spite of the fact that the mental and linguistic aspect is present\) something, without reference to the body of the officiant.

Finally, an essential element of *nyāsa* is the form of speech which it serves to place on a body or an object which it penetrates and impregnates by its energy. One must therefore recall the importance of speech \(*vāc*\) in Tantra and how it is conceived. Speech, which is the divine energy itself or the energy aspect of the deity which is supreme Being and supreme Consciousness, emits the universe, animates it and reabsorbs it. It is difficult to be precise about the essential and ultimate nature of this speech – is it sound or consciousness? Explanations vary according to the different schools. Perhaps it is possible to say – if one may adopt a non-dualist Śaiva perspective – that there is on the highest level an ultimate Reality, pure consciousness, where speech is in seed, being co-essential with it and being its aspect as energy. This speech, which is at the same time consciousness and energy, evolves becoming more explicitly sound, then discourse, manifesting thus the universe, bringing it into existence by saying or naming it. Speech is ‘that which says or expresses’ \(*vācaka*\) all things, which are ‘that which is to be said, or expressed’ \(*vācya*\). Such is the correspondence between mantras, or phonic seeds \(*bīja*\) and the divinities which they represent \(or rather of which they are the subtle and essential form\).14 In *nyāsa*, it is this phonic or consciousness element – we can say this spiritual force – having a sonorous form for support \(itself the essential form of the deity\), that is transported and deposited by the hand with the ritual gesture of placing \(or through the mental concentration which accompanies, or replaces, this gesture\).

If there is a gesture in *nyāsa*, how is one to understand the link between this purely physical act and the transfer of spiritual energy? Of course, seen objectively, this is merely one form among others of the manipulations of symbols or of organs which many cultures use to transform the body \(or to modify its image\), or to act upon objects, practices which are cases of symbolic effectiveness. But if this is for us a clear and simple explanation of the functioning of *nyāsa*, it was felt as an important problem within Indian thought for the practitioners of *nyāsa*, in terms of their problematic: there was for them an effective – one could say material – transfer of the phonic and spiritual force of the mantra and a ‘sealing’ of it through a gesture on the chosen place; not simply an accompanying gesture and still less a symbolic operation. The question, in fact, is hardly discussed, the practitioners not being accustomed to putting in doubt the received tradition. Some of them, however, did ask themselves what is really the nature of *nyāsa*: is it a mental or spiritual operation, or a material one? Or rather, what is the part of each of these two elements? This is done, for instance, at the beginning of chapter 4 of the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*, entitled ‘Rules concerning the placing of mantras’ \(*mantranyāsavidhi*\)15 where we read:


The mantrin, his body purified, is to perform the placing of mantras which identifies him with the god of gods \(*devadevasamo bhavet*\) and makes him qualified to accomplish all ritual action such as *pūjā* and so on, \[placing\] thanks to which he will appear \[in or for himsef\] all perfections or supernatul powers \(*siddhi*\). Having accomplished this, he will be without fear among wicked people and will be able to triumph over all dangers. Although what is called *nyāsa* must be considered a mental operation, it does not create a \[new\] situation immediately and outside of the \[material\] action \[which constitutes it\].16


This last sentence is very explicit. The intellectual, ‘mental’ \(*mānasa*\) component of *nyāsa* is what the tradition considers essential. It is the concentration of the practitioner’s spirit that is effective: it is the concentration of his mind on what he is doing, that is, his one-pointed mental concentration on the phonic and spiritual assemblage comprising the mantra \(or the *bīja*\) that he places, or the mental representation, the visualisation \(*dhyāna* or *bhāvanā*\) of the entity to be imposed, or the inner experience or feeling in the self of the transformation effected by the *nyāsa*.17 Since the placing acts on the plane of the so-called ‘subtle body’,18 or that of consciousness, and due to the element of speech \(the imposed mantra\) whose nature is divine energy, there is a natural pre-eminence of the mental or spiritual element. Parallel to this, there are actions \(*kriyā*\) described in the manuals, that is, the gestures of the placing of which there can be many \(for example, if one must impose all the *mātṛkā*\), gestures which are equally indispensable as nothing is effective without their being performed.19 But these actions are subordinated to the most important element which is spiritual or mental, and without which they would remain without effect: what is mental is always superior, in India, to that which is material or perceptible to the senses. This, however, without losing sight of the fact that there is no difference in nature between the bodily and the mental, but rather a difference of level. Without forgetting too that the *nyāsa* is generally carried out by the adept after a ritual or spiritual exercises which purify his body20 or which purify and divinise the hand which performs the *nyāsa* so as to render it capable of serving this spiritual manipulation.21

This nature of *nyāsa*, without being clearly explicated, is clearly implicit in many texts. All, for example, which prescribe before the *nyāsa* to concentrate on the divine or otherwise entity to be placed, or which say that one must first reabsorb and assimilate the mantras in oneself \(that is to say, what they symbolise\) before imposing them. Thus in the ŚT \(chapter 5, śl. 118–120, in relation to the *varṇamāyī dīkṣā*\), the master first identifies with the divinity, uniting himself with the supreme self, and then imposes the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet on his disciple, impregnating him with their spiritual force and identifying him with the divinity: he transmits through *nyāsa* the condition which he had previously brought about in himself.22 In all cases, too, where what is imposed is not a *mantra* or *bījā* but a figure \(the *śrīcakra* for example – thus in YH, chapter 3\), or when a mantra is made of a group of unpronounceable letters such as the *navātmamantra RHRKSMLVYUM* \(TĀ 15, 239f. see also here, p. 60\), the essentially mental or spiritual character of the operation of *nyāsa* is evident.

There exists, finally, complex *nyāsas* which are more tantric meditations than placing properly so called, where the adept must first visualise \(and feel\) that all or part of his body is transformed by the imposed mantras and becomes identified with energies, cosmic divisions, etc. There is also the case where the *nyāsa* of various energies is done in the ‘breath’ \(*prāṇa*\) of a yogi whose body has first been divinised by other *nyāsas*,23 etc. In cases of this sort we can ask whether we are still in *nyāsa*, but this would be to forget that *nyāsa* always has a mental or spiritual aspect which is often \(notably in more complex cases\) an operation almost uniquely intellectual. This explains why the texts prescribing the placings, in place of *nyaset* or *vinyaset*, use the verbal forms *smaret, cintayet, dhyayet, bhāvayet* or *kalpayet*.24

Let us finally note that alongside such terms as underline the mental aspect of *nyāsa*, we also encounter in ritual texts, so as to underline the act of placing, other words for *nyāsa*. Thus the verb *KṢIP* \(to project, to place, to pour\) can serve to indicate the placing of certain entities on the body or on an object \(for example, TĀ, 16, 231, for the imposition on previously imposed *tattvas*; or TĀ 17, 2–3, the projection of the three *malas* on the body of the disciple after the placing on him of the *adhvans*\): in effect these are *nyāsas*. The Indian lexicographers often gloss *nyāsa* with *kṣepa* or *nikṣepa*: thus Kṣirasvāmin in *Amarakośa* II, 9, 81, *nyasyatenikṣepyate nyāsaḥ*. One also finds *niveśa* and *viniveśa, viniyoga, samarpaṇa* \(or *YUJ: yojayet*, or *ni-DHĀ*: *nidhāpayet* etc.\). All these terms have near meanings: the sense of to deposit, to place, to install, to apply, to put, or to consign to a place, or else, to join, to conjoin – the words differ but refer to the same thing.

There are also texts using the verb *LIKH*, to write, when prescribing or describing *nyāsa*. This is very natural when it refers to placing *mantras* or *bījas* on a diagram: one places and traces them there according to precise rules.25 Or, in certain rites where one must draw a *yantra* and *bījas* on a liquid while reciting the *bījas* in order to consecrate the liquid, thus for the preparation of the *arghya* for the *pūjā*. But there are cases where the texts are more ambiguous. For example, in chapter 293 \(*mantra-paribhāṣa*\) of the AgPur \(*śl*. 39–47\), the ‘Lords of the letters’ \(*lipīśvara*\) and the energies of Rudra \(represented by phonemes\) must be written then imposed \(*likhyā … vinyaset*\), without the text indicating how or where the phonemes are to be written before being imposed. We do not have, it is true, an entirely reliable text of this purāṇa: the passage in question is perhaps corrupt or incomplete: the uncertainty remains.26

To gain a complete sense of what *nyāsas* are, their nature and role, we must examine several types and different usages \(their range and diverse effects\). In effect, as in nearly all Tantric ritual, Hindu or Buddhist, the *nyāsas* are used in a wide variety of circumstances and conditions, from the highest spiritual practice to the most vulgar magic \(including an important zone where it is difficult to know if one is in the religious or the magical, the two domains being difficult to separate, especially in India: ‘There is no religion without magic and no magic that does not contain a grain of religion’\).

As the more complex *nyāsas* are those which best show the sense and scope of this practice, we will first consider this type of procedure. We will then examine more rapidly diverse sorts of simpler *nyāsas* which we find in ritual worship \(*pūjā*\), in spiritual practices or magic, as well as in the ritual acts of daily life. Not that the sense of these diverse types of *nyāsa* differs: it is always the same, the impregnation of the body or of an object touched by a divine or cosmic entity or a spiritual force. But this ‘metaphysical’ dimension is more or less noticeable and in particular more or less explained in the prescriptive texts: it is only for this reason that I distinguish them.

Let us now look at the texts rich in ritual developments and in religious and cosmic implications. I will resort mainly to two works which are easy to have access to, both of them Śaivite: the one Kashmirian, Abhinavagupta’s TĀ, the other also connected to Kashmir and commented upon in the spirit of the Pratyabhijñâ by Amṛtānanda, the *Yoginīhṛdaya* \(YH\).27 For the TĀ we will look at passages from chapters 15 and 16, the former dealing with the so-called regular initiation \(*samayadīkṣ ā*\), the latter with the *putradīkṣā*, the initiation of a ‘spiritual son’.28 It may be useful to recall in this connection that, in the TĀ, initiation is not limited to the transmission of a mantra by a master to his disciple, a type of rite of passage giving access to a particular form of spiritual life, but is a procedure enabling the initiated disciple to realise, from the particular point where he finds himself \(hence the diversity of *dīkṣās*29\), his identity with Śiva. These rites being all the more complex as the disciple has a longer road to travel and more elements to transform and purify. Moreover, the goal aimed at being usually liberation in life \(*jīvanmukti*\), being in all cases the liberation of an incarnate being, the body \(or rather, the bodies, gross and subtle\) of the initiand, as well as his thought must be transformed and divinized. Hence the important role, in this process of that fundamental means of corporeal transformation, and of interiorised action, that is *nyāsa*.

The ritual of the *samayadīkṣā* as described in chapter 15 of the TĀ is particularly long and complex. *Nyāsas* are used there in nearly all the rites and there are moments when they are the essential part of the rite. To begin with, we find a general placing \(*sāmānya nyāsa*\) of the fifty phonemes of the *mātṛkā* and of the *mālinī*,30 after which the disciple to be initiated purifies his body and his ‘breath’ \(*prāṇa*\) \(that is, destroys in himself all that binds him to empirical life and duality\) through meditating on the flaming image of the *astramantra PHA:Ṭ*31 \(*śl*. 232–36\). He thus finds himself in the pure, divine Self \(*tiṣṭhecchuddhātmani*\), immobile and without waves, but where there nevertheless appears as a primordial wave the image \(*mūrti*\) of Śiva formed by the *mūrtimantra OṂ HAṂ*.32 It is in this state, the adept being already very purified and detached from empirical life, that the ‘special placings’ \(*viśeṣa nyāsa*\) that interest us here will be performed.

These comprise, first, a ‘great sixfold *nyāsa*’33 of the ‘god Navātman’,34 that is to say of the *navātmamantra* formed from nine letters *RHRKṢMLVYUṂ*. These are imposed on nine points of the body; followed by *nyāsa* on fifty points of the body of the *mātṛkā*; then of the *śiva*-, *vidyā*- and *ātma-tattvas* \(which cover the whole manifestation\) on the tuft, the heart, and the feet; then of the eight gods or mantras Aghora etc. on the head, face, neck, heart, navel, generative organs, thighs and feet; of the mantra god Bhairavasadbhāva, with his ‘limbs’ \(*aṇga*\) on the usual places for *nyāsa* of the *aṅgamantras* \(heart, head, tuft of hair, chest, eyes – sometimes also the ‘weapon’\); and finally, on the same places, of the mantra god Ratikśekhara, *RYLVUṂ*, which must be specially worshipped at this moment in the rite.

This first *mahānyāsa* is that of the various aspects of Śiva. It is followed by a second series of six placings: of aspects of the Energy \(*śāktaṃ nyāsam śl*. 248\) which must be made ‘on the preceding ones’, that is, on the same places. This is important: it is necessary to exactly superimpose the two series of *nyāsas* in order to make the two categories \(male and female\) of cosmic or divine entities coincide and so to unite Śiva and Śakti \(and thus have the divinity in its totality\) in the body of the adept. One therefore imposes on the *navātmamantra* the energy Parāparā with her ‘limbs’ and ‘faces’ \(*sāṅgavaktra*\); on the *mātṛkā*, the *mālinī*,35 on the three *tattvas* of Śiva etc., the three aspects of divine energy \(or, more exactly, the three goddesses\) Parā, Parāparā and Aparā; on Aghora etc., the eight energies Aghorī etc.; on Bhairavasadbhāva and his *aṅga*, the five Vidyāṅga; finally one must place on the same spots the Energy as Mātṛsadbhāva, Mistress of Yoga, in her plenitude, supreme and unwavering, destroyer of time, the initiating master having at the same time \(as for Ratiśekhara\) to worship her specially, mentally evoking her ‘limbs’ and ‘faces’ and her retinue of twelve energies. For this is, in fact, the energy at her most high and pure level, the supreme Consciousness, present without any division in all other deities or entities previously imposed. It is this supreme Śakti united with Śiva that the double *mahânyāsa* infuses in the body and spirit of the disciple.

Abhinavagupta \(*śl* 259–61\) makes clear the scope of this operation in putting in parallel the six parts of the double *nyāsa* and the five modalities of consciousness \(from *jāgrat* to *turyātīta*\) to which he adds *anuttara*, the first principle, ‘without second’, each of these six states being considered as being formed by itself along with the five others. This makes 6 × 6, that is 36: the number of *tattvas* from Śiva to earth. The *nyāsa* therefore has the effect of imposing on the body of the adept all the modalities of consciousness \(from the ordinary waking state to supreme consciousness\) along with the group of thirty six principles that constitute the cosmos. He thus is identified with the totality of consciousness and the pure, cosmic emanation paradigmatically present in Śiva. The adept is thus identified with the Supreme Śiva united with Śakti, pure,36 total Consciousness, dazzling, where appears in all its diversity; but archetypally and without duality, the totality of the cosmic manifestation \(*śl*. 262–68\).

It is interesting to note that at this point Abhinavagupta thought it useful to approach the problematic of *nyāsa*. He notes in effect \(*śl*. 268–269\) that it is paradoxical that an empirical method such as the placings can produce a result of a transcendent order: the transformation of a man into a god. But this is, he says, because *nyāsas* are operations of an interior, spiritual order: that which one thinks, for good or bad, that one becomes. Whoever therefore thinks intensely \(*bhāvayati*\) ‘I am Śiva and nothing other’ becomes Him \(*śl*. 269–270\). ‘He creates for himself there an unwavering certainty, an awareness in the depth of the heart, associated with a thought without duality which, itself, generates a flood of thoughts bound to duality \[but all\] orientated toward the identity \[of the empirical subject\] with Śiva’.37 One thus comes to destroy all belief of another \(mundane\) kind and to have only the unshakeable conviction that our nature is pure, eternal and divine. The spiritual character of the activity of *nyāsa* cannot be better underlined.


Having by this sacrifice thus transformed his body, full of bliss, entirely away from the world, the adept should meditate on the body as identical with Śiva. Any connection with the world once destroyed and the limited condition being dissolved, what remains in his body other than the essence of the bliss of Śiva? Worshipping his body day and night and carrying in himself the thirty six *tattvas*, the adept is identified with Śiva. Perfectly content he lives in peace in this cosmic body.

\(*śl*. 238–236\)


Thus Abhinavagupta sums up the condition of the person who has received the double *mahānyāsa*. What else, indeed, could he want?

This is not, however, the end of the rite of initiation, but only a necessary condition for its complete accomplishment. The process therefore continues, first, with a new group of *nyāsas* which is also worth summarising.38 There again the initiand is to identify himself with Śiva. One could believe that this condition has already been attained through the previous *nyāsa*. But it is completed here through an ‘interiorisation’ by the adept of a group of aspects of the divinity or, more precisely, of an ascending movement of energy which he will integrate with his ‘breath’ \(*prāṇa*\). He imposes, in effect, on his ‘breath’ a series of entities representing the rise of energy from its lower base to the supreme level, a series visualised as a trident extending from the point of departure of the breath in the area of the navel, to a point twelve fingers above the head. This ‘breath’, conceived as present in the physical body, is an element of the yogic structure of centres and veins imagined as present \(‘intraposed’ to use T. Goudriaan’s term\) in the physical body. The *nyāsa* thus, even if accompanied by hand gestures which impose the entities, is essentially internal, mentally visualised. It completes the preparation of the adept to the mental and material acts of worship that are to follow by making his ‘breath’ and his consciousness – and not only his body – the seat \(*āsana*\) of the deity.39

He first places the Power that supports \(*ādhāraśakti*\) four fingers below the navel, then on top of that the four elements: earth, water, fire and air together with the fifth one, ether, the whole occupying four fingers and being imagined as forming the swelling \(*āmalaka*\) near the base of the trident. The latter, called *ananta*, rises above the swelling through twenty-four finger-spaces from his navel to the uvula \(the *cakra* of the palate\), being made up of the twenty-four *tattvas* from *tanmātra* to *kalā*. Then, on the knot formed by the *māyā tattva*, one finds the eight qualities of consciousness \(*dharma*, etc.\) placed on a square *maṇḋala* in the four directions of space and their intermediaries. Just above this knot \(between the uvula and the *brahmarandhra*\), the initiand is to meditate on \(*dhyāyet* – not *nyaset*\) the *śuddhavidyā tattva* in the form of a lotus with eight petals: on these and in the calyx one places and worships the nine energies Vāma, and so forth, from right to left \(*pradakṣina*\), then the nine energies Vibhvī, etc. in the reverse order. After this the adept is to evoke \(*smaret*\) the sun, moon and fire with the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Hara placed respectively on the petals, the stamen and the calyx of the lotus. Above these he places Īśvara, then above him \(at the level of the top of his skull\) Sadāśiva, the *mahāpreta*, lying as a blazing corpse, emaciated but filled by the laugh of destruction.40 He should then evoke \(*smaret*\) three shafts of light which, rising up from the navel of Sadāśiva, go up from the *brahmarandhra* – these are the three energies *śakti, vyāpinī* and *samanā –* forming the trident \(*trisūla*\), they spread out and up to the plane of the *dvādaśānta*, twelve finger-spaces above the head, reaching the level of *unmanā*.41 where the three supreme goddesses of the Trika are seated each on a Bhairava lying on, a white lotus. The initiation ritual goes on, a cult being then to be performed on the lotuses to this supreme plane of the deity.42

We have here, then, a *nyāsa* where cosmic and divine entities are imposed \(placed, seen, and felt\) and the image to be visualised of a trident. This implies a double identification with the one and with the others and implies that the visualisations and meditation occupy the main place, with physical touching, insofar as there is any, having only a secondary role. This passage well illustrates the role that *nyāsa* has in a spiritual practice that rests on mental representations; and how the hand gestures on the body \(when there are such gestures\) bring about, through the representations and mental effort which accompany them, a transformation of the body image, the ‘cosmicisation’ of the performer and his assimilation to the divine.

In chapter 16 of the TĀ, on *putrakadīkṣā*, there are interesting passages \(*śl*. 77–163 and 207–247\) where the cosmic sixfold division of the ‘ways’ \(*adhvan*\) and the mantras which express and are used to purify them are imposed on the body of the adept. There is here again a complex *nyāsa* in which mental representations play a crucial role. It would merit being examined, but to do this here would give too much space to this kind of operation.43 On the subject of complex *nyāsas*, it will be better to look at those which are more directly linked with the cult and use of a *maṇḋala* \(or *cakra*\).

There is a good example of this in chapter 3 of the YH \(*śl*. 8 to 92\), which describes the cult of the goddess Tripurasundarī which, as with the rites we have seen, has as a goal not only her worship but also the identification of the performer with the deity. The ‘external’ cult allows – thanks to the ritual and above all thanks to the *nyāsas* – the adept to attain this identification that those more talented or more favoured by divine grace would attain merely by contemplation \(*bhāvanā: śl*. 5–6\).

The adept must first make a sixfold *nyāsa* \(*ṣoḋhānyāsa*\)44 of: 1\) the fifty Gaṇeśa, placed where one normally imposes the *mātṛkā*; 2\) the nine planets, imposed on various points of the body with each of the eight series of phonemes plus *kṣa*; then 3\) the *nakṣatra*, associated with phonemes; 4\) the six groups of Yoginīs on the six *cakra*s from *mūlādhāra* to *ājñā*, with syllabic *bījas*; 5\) the twelve signs of the zodiac with groups of phonemes; 6\) finally the fifty *pīṭhās* associated with the fifty *mātṛkās*.45 One thereby achieves a first ‘cosmicisation’ of the body of the officiant since one finds there the stars, places of sacred geography, together with such forms of divine energy as are the *mātṛkā* and the *bījas*. The officiant thus already transcends his human condition.

He must, however, still identify with the Goddess and, to this end, he will become assimilated to her as she resides, surrounded by secondary deities, in the *śrīcakra* used to worship her \(since she abides at its centre\), but which also, and mainly, symbolises her cosmic dynamism as she eternally emits and reabsorbs the universe. The adept therefore imposes the *cakra* on his body, the *nyāsa* bringing him to merge with the deity in total non-duality \(therefore going back to the origin\). The ritual process unfolds going from the outer part of the *cakra* to its centre.

First, the process requires the outside line of the square surrounding the *cakra* to be placed on ten points of the body with the mantra ‘homage to the outside line of *bhūpura*’. Then, invoking in the same way the two other lines of the square, he imposes on the same points of the body these lines as well as ten *siddhis*, then the ten *mudrās* which also reside there. In the same way he imposes the other parts of the *cakra* \(the two lotuses with sixteen and eight petals, then the four concentric series of small triangles formed by the intersections of the nine triangles that are within the *cakra*\) on various points of the body, with a mantra of homage to each of these parts. He then imposes on the same points the divine entities residing in each part of the *cakra*. This is thus a double operation, identifying the body with the *cakra* by the placing of its nine parts, then achieving the divinisation by placing all the aspects of the goddess associated with the *cakra*.

Then the adept imposes in his heart, with the mantra ‘homage to the triangle’,46 the central triangle of the *cakra* on the outside of which are the three goddesses Kāmeśvarī, Vajreśvarī, and Bhagamālinī and in the centre the goddess Tripurasundarī.

But the process does not stop there; another series of impositions must still be made on the body, this time going from the centre to the exterior, from the *mūladevī* to the secondary divinities and to the *siddhis*, from the central *bindu* to the outer square. This being done, the adept comes to realise that the goddess, Mistress of the gods – says the commentator – and his own self are identified, inseparably united, the supreme reality, dazzling and vibrant, ‘the unifying fusion of light and consciousness’ \(*prakāśavimarśasāmarasyarūpa*\). Being the cause and foundation of the process of *nyāsa*, the goddess brings the adept to unity with the divine self \(*śl*. 83\); it is therefore with her that the *nyāsa* reaches its ultimate aim.47 The process, in fact, does not end there, but it is not necessary to follow it further.48

If *nyāsa* is essentially a mental or spiritual practice – especially in cases where its scope and aim are the most profound – it is nonetheless, as a general rule, accompanied by a gesture and consists, in the most common practice, in the manual act of placing a mantra – hence the importance, already mentioned above \(pp. 55–56\), of everything relating to the hand; though, probably, as we have already seen with the theory of *nyāsa*, the role of the hand appears as subordinate to the mental operation. One can say that above all it is a symbolic act \(which would not be disparaging, for anything related to *mantra* is precisely of symbolic effectiveness\). It is, on the other hand, in more elaborate philosophical texts \(not very frequent in a Tantric milieu – except, of course, in the Saiva exegesis\) that the spiritual foundation of *nyāsa* is expressed. A less intellectual thinking will naturally give the hand a directly effective role. It goes without saying that, for most adepts of yore or of today – be they devotees, *mantrins*, or magicians \(very numerous, those\!\) – the hand is really charged with the influx that it places. But in Tantric texts too \(the TĀ, for instance\) one often finds side by side these two levels of practice or of religious discourse. These works thus prescribe nearly all the rites for purifying the hand which performs the *nyāsa* and for charging it with the effective force it must transmit. This is in particular what justifies the rite of *karanyāsa* or of *karāṅganyāsa* \(placing on the hands, or placing of the *aṅgamantra* on the hands\) often prescribed first when a series of placings is required.49 One thus finds at the beginning of the Śaiva *samdhya* the *sakalīkaraṇa*50 rite, whose goal, according to Aghoraśiva, is first to penetrate the hand with divine energy \(*sakalahastavy āptaśaktitvena*\), then with this transformed hand, to identify different parts of the body of the officiant with the ‘parts’ \(*kalā*51\) of Śiva.

The fourth chapter of the *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* \(after the fourth *śloka*, which we have seen given a definition of *nyāsa* as a mental process\) describes a *karanyāsa* \(or *hastanyāsa*\) characteristic enough to merit being reproduced here:


Given the role of the hands in the placings, one should begin with their *nyāsa*. Thus ‘imposed’, the hands are charged with a luminous force. One places there, indeed, twelve phonemes52 from wrists to fingertips, that are thereby as full of light and heat as the sun \(*ādityatapavat*\). The rule is that *nyāsa* is done three times: according to emanation, conservation and resorption. In the *sṛṣṭinyāsa* \(emanation\), one imposes the *tāra* \(*mantra*\) on the palm of the right hand, then on the thumb, etc.: the ten fingers, in order, up to the left little finger, thus receive ten phonemes, the twelfth being placed on the left palm. In the *nyāsa* of conservation \(*sthiti*\), one begins with the left thumb, then the four other fingers, and ends with the palm, imposing six phonemes beginning with the *tāramantra*. Then follows in due order the six other *akṣara* on the left hand, from the thumb to the palm. \(The *saṃhāra* – resorption – *nyāsa* is made from the left palm to the right.\) After this, one must impose the rest of the phonemes ending with the *praṇava*. The *nyāsa* must be made with the index finger on the thumb of the same hand, then with the thumb on the index and the other fingers, going from the right thumb to the left little finger, then the two palms, right and left. One must then impose the *mantras hṛdaya* etc., the twelve luminous members \(*aṅga*\) \(of Viṣṇu\) right in the middle, the lotus with shining rays, the club shining with its own brilliance on the left palm, in the right the luminous disc, the conch in the left palm, the *kiriṭa* on the right hand, the *śrīvatsa* in the middle of the left, the *kaustubha* on the right palm and the rosary on the left, Śrī on the right hand and Puṣṭi on the palm. He must then impose the *garuḋamantra* on the ten fingers, going from the right thumb to the left little finger. This is the rule of the *hastanyāsa*. By this the supreme energy of the Lord will penetrate to the centre of the lotus of the heart where it is transformed into vital breath; then, dividing itself into ten, it extends up to the hands \(*pāṇimārgena nirgatā*\), where it fills the ten channels \(*nāḋī*\) which reach to the fingers.53


In the Śaiva context one finds, as well as the *karanyāsa* already mentioned, a particular rite of the ‘hand of Śiva’ \(*śivahasta*\) used, above all, for initiation \(and sometimes in worship\): it transforms the right hand of the master into a divine hand. Abhinavagupta mentions it in relation to the *samayadīkṣā* in the fifteenth chapter of the TĀ:


The master should, with the left hand, worship on the right hand the luminous wheel of mantras, containing all the ‘ways’ \(*adhvan*\) and destroying all the bonds. He places it on the head of the disciple, on which the ‘ways’ have been first imposed, then touching his whole body, this hand shall destroy all bonds which bind him, and \[the disciple\] will then be an initiated *samayin*, shining, united in his lifetime to the Supreme Lord.54


In the offering of the *pavitras*, described in the SP, the master transforms his hand by means of various anointments and imposes there the *aṅgamantras*.55 This ritual of *śivahasta* can appear as outside the domain of *nyāsa*, but it is not. One is still within the problematic of placings, mental or manual, and of the transmission through thought or hand of a transforming power.

The hand, as we have seen, is generally the right hand but it can be the left or both. A *nyāsa* can also be made in a different way, with a flower for example. Being a beneficial ritual, the *nyāsa* should normally be made with the right hand. The texts sometimes make it clear. They especially mention the cases, rather rare, in which the left hand is to be used. Thus the fourteenth chapter of the TĀ, in a passage previously summarised, indicates the practice expounded being ‘of the left’ \(*vāmācāra*\),56 all the rites prescribed there are to be performed with the left hand \(except where both hands are prescribed\) using the thumb and ring finger.57 The left hand, hand of impure activities, is also to serve in harmful magical practices \(*abhicāra*\). Finally, there are several cases of using both hands together or separately. Such is the case \(cf. p. 76\) of the *vyāpakanyāsa*. There are others cases, those notably of *nyāsa* on symmetrical parts of the body, or when \(in the *karanyāsa*\) the placings are made separately on each hand.

Whatever hand is used, the *nyāsa* is done with a particular gesture of the fingers, a *mudrā*: usually \(as said above\) the thumb and ring finger joined, which is often called *mahāmudrā*. The TBhS says:


The sage must perform the placing with flowers, with the ring finger, or mentally, says another text on *mantra*. \[‘ring finger’ being understood as:\] with the ring finger united to the thumb. The *Padyavāhinī* says in effect: it is everywhere understood that *nyāsa* is made with the thumb and ring finger joined. It explains further: with flowers on the image,58 with the ring finger and thumb on his own body and mentally on the *mūlādhāra* and other *cakras*. This is excepting the *nyāsa* of the *ṛṣi* etc., of the *karāṅganyāsa* and of the external *nyāsa* of the *mātṛkā* for which other *mudrās* are prescribed.


These *mudrās* are enumerated in the same work \(p. 163\): they vary not only with regard to the phonemes imposed but according to the place where the placings are made: ring finger and middle finger on the forehead and the mouth, index, middle finger and ring finger on the eyes, etc. Other texts give different prescriptions – and there are evidently other prescriptions in Buddhist texts \(or in Jain ones\).59

*Mudrās* are continually used in Tantric ritual; they have coded meanings and accompany or support speech – above all mantras – uttered in *pūjā* as well as during other ritual or magical actions. There are lists or descriptions in a number of works.60 As noted above, *mudrās* like mantras surely go back a long way: they are archaic quasi-universal forms of behaviour that India has particularly developed and codified. As previously mentioned, the relationship existing between mantra and *mudrā* does in several respects pose problems that go beyond the scope of this brief study. Remaining in its frame, we have already seen that the Indians did ask themselves the question of the relationship between the effect of *nyāsa* and its material performance. On the subject of *mantras* and *mudrās* in general, the following formulas, usually ascribed to the *Mahānayaprakāśa*,61 are sometimes quoted: *svarūpajñānapanarūpaṃ mudrā-samsthānam* and *svavimarśātmanā trānam īṣyate mantralakṣanam*; the mantra would thus bring liberation by reflexive awareness of the self, whereas the role of the *mudrā* would make known the nature of reality. We may consider these formulas as largely arbitrary since they are based in part on a play of words; we must, however, retain the distinction they set between, on the one hand, the awareness and, on the other, the visible expression or sign of the essential nature, for this is certainly the manner in which mantras and *mudrās* are understood and experienced by those who use them. We may note too that among other meanings the term *mudrā* means ‘seal’ \(or ‘imprint’ made with a seal\) and that, in the case of *nyāsa*, the hand gesture appears precisely to seal in the prescribed place the entity or mantra being imposed \(*mudrā* is also translated into Chinese as *yin* which designates an official seal\).62

As a gesture, *mudrā* is an essential element in the bodily participation of the adept in the transformation of his body that *nyāsa* is to bring about: the movement reinforcing and concretising in a visible manner the action accomplished by mantra and mental concentration.63

But although corporeal by nature, the *mudrā*, too, can be done internally. Thus the LT 35.74, in a chapter describing the rites to be performed for the internal worship \(*antaryāga*\) of the deity, says: ‘The *sādhaka* should meditate on the *mudrās* in spirit’ \(*manasā bhāvayen mudrāḥ*\). The *mudrās*, in this case, are mentally performed or, more exactly, intensely meditated upon and ‘realised’.64 Cases of this sort, of mental or interiorised ritual worship, where no gesture is made, are not exceptional and they are always considered as of a higher nature than materially performed rites. The *mudrā*, too, in such cases, acquires a higher value.

*Mudrās*, in fact, necessarily have a mental aspect since they are not merely performed, but also thought, held in mind, mentally imagined by the adept at the same time as he performs them bodily.65 But there may also be something more: they can be ‘lived’, experienced, by him on a metaphysical plane. When, for example, the YH 1.57–71 describes the divine energy as taking the form of nine *mudrās*, the *sādhaka* must at that time make the prescribed, symbolic gestures, the *mudrās*, with his hands, and realise them as being forms of the Energy \(*kriyāśakti*\) – deities also – thus closely associating the bodily, theological and metaphysical planes.66

We can cite on the same subject another work of the Krama tradition of Kashmir, but by an author of South India, Maheśvarānanda \(tenth century\), who put forward an interesting metaphysical interpretation of *nyāsa* in stanza 45 of his *Mahārthamañjarī*. Here is an approximate rendering of this text: ‘The network of gestures pertaining to the domain of dualistic thought brings about a contact with non-duality. The water of the offering is the play of the knowable; the flowers are the nourishing states of our own essence.’67 Maheśvarānanda, in his own commentary, the *Parimala*, explains that this ‘network of gestures’ is the *aṅganyāsa* effected by the adept who, when making these placings on his body, becomes aware of the Self, which destroys all duality. In effect he unites the awareness of the absolute with the parts of his body touched by the *nyāsa* which are thus understood in spirit through a synthetic, undifferentiated intuition whose nature is the realisation of the total plenitude of the absolute ‘I’. Maheśvarānanda cites then a verse from his *paramaguru* Śivānanda:


I accomplish the purification – the total purification of the two hands – which is pure consciousness expanding to the fingers and where the action being done coincides exactly with its Cause. I realize and make present by the practice of the *ṣaḋaṅga \[nyāsa\]* the surging of the noble energies, the Omniscient and the others, which abide in the Self of the Lord.


Neither these stanzas, nor their gloss, are easy to grasp; the terminology, the metaphysics, are those of the Krama of Kashmirian Śaivism. But the interpretation of *nyāsa* as an operation of a metaphysical order where gesture is subordinated to consciousness, itself dominated by the non-dual awareness of divinity, is clear: the scope and field of action of *nyāsa* is transcendent, its nature is spiritual. The formula of the *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* – *vyāparo mānaso hyeṣa nyāsaḥ* – appears in comparison to be modest; but all the formulations encountered – and I think I have made an impartial choice – put the placings on the same side, that of consciousness.

It remains, to complete this study, to review briefly some examples of *nyāsa* prescribed in the texts and the manuals \(examples, of course, that we have not already seen\).



## Ṛṣyādinyāsa
– the placing of ***ṛṣi*** etc.

When a text prescribes the use of a mantra for certain ends, the announcement is almost always followed by an indication of the sage \(*ṛṣi*\) to whom it was revealed, by its meter \(*chandas*\), the *devatā* it ‘expresses’, the syllable or word which is its seed \(*bīja*\), that is, its abbreviated form or essence. Sometimes, too, its energy \(*śakti*\) is indicated along with its pointed end \(*kīlaka*\) and, finally, its use \(*viniyoga*\).68 Now, the first thing to do, if one wants to use the mantra, is to impose on oneself those of these elements that are quoted: an obligatory rule to be followed even when it is not expressly prescribed. This may take place at the beginning of the ritual, if only one mantra is concerned \(as in most cases cited in the *Mantramahārṇava*\); but if a longer rite requires the use of several mantras, the *ṛṣyādinyāsa* can be prescribed each time – thus the placing of the *mātṛkā*, which very often must follow the *ṛṣyādinyāsa* and the *ṣaḋaṅganyāsa* of the principal mantra, begins with the placing of the *ṛṣi* etc. \(see below p. 79\). \(This is so much so that even the *hamṣa* mantra of the *ajapājapa*, which in many regards is only the natural movement of the breath accompanied by the two syllables *ham* and *sa*, is supposed to have its *ṛṣi* etc. that it is necessary to place initially: at most it is sometimes admitted that there is a spontaneous placing–*sahajam nyāsam*, cf. *Dakṣinamūrtisaṃhitā* 7.17–20\). The raison d’être of this rite is that the practitioner thus begins his assimilation of the mantra by effecting a first general identification with it through taking into himself its principal elements, after which comes the rest of the ritual \(of which we have seen examples\), at the end of which the adept will attain a perfect identification with the supernatural entity of which the mantra is the phonic form and through which the sought after goal is reached. But to be able to effect a complete transformation, a veritable ‘change of ontological status’ \(to speak like Mircea Eliade\), since it is a question of passing from ordinary life to a state of liberation in life, of identification with the absolute69 – or even, more modestly and more usually, when the aim of the rite is merely to become able to use the mantra for utilitarian ends – it is necessary for the adept to have from the outset a body and mind prepared and already somewhat modified and purified by assimilating something of the mantra. This is why this preliminary *nyāsa* is useful.70 ‘Without the placing of the *ṛṣi*, the metre and the *devatā*, the recitation of a mantra, even indefinitely multiplied, would remain fruitless’ \(a tantra cited in the TBhS, p. 189\).

This *nyāsa* is always done in the order given above and on the same points of the body, successively: the head, the mouth, the heart \(which are the three obligatory points corresponding to *ṛṣi, chandas* and *devatā*\), then genitals \(or *mūlādhāra*\), feet and/or navel and on the entire body \(*sarvāṅga*\). The formula used is of the type: \(*Om*\) \+ the utterance of the *ṛṣi* etc. in the dative \+ *namaḥ* \(the part of the body touched being sometimes also stated in the locative\). Thus, for the mantra *Om namaḥ śivāya*, the *ṛṣi* etc. are presented as follows:


*ṛṣī Vāmadeva, paṇktichandas Īśānadevatā oṃ bījam, namah. śakti, śivāya kīlakam, caturvidhapuruṣārthasiddhyarthe nyāse viniyogaḥ.*


We have thus:


*om vāmadevārṣaye namaḥ*, on the head

*paṅktichandase namaḥ*, on the mouth

*Īśānadevatayai namaḥ*, on the heart

*om bījāya namaḥ* on the genitals

*namaḥ śaktaye namaḥ* on the feet

*śivāyeti kīlakāya namaḥ* on the navel

*caturvidha … viniyogāya namaḥ* on the body.71


One might ask what motivates the choice of one or another part of the body for the *nyāsa*. Perhaps comparing *nyāsas* in several different traditions would make it possible to discover permanent elements and to reach conclusions: such an enquiry \(if it is worth the trouble\) remains to be carried out. For the present case, the selection of the places where to impose mantras seems to be that of important points of the image of the body as it is mentally experienced in ritual worship, in yoga, and in mantric practice.72

Sometimes this series of placings is to take place after the *karanyāsa*, but it normally precedes another series, also a general occurrence: the *aṅganyāsa* or *karāṅganyāsa*.



## Aṅganyāsa or karāṅganyāsa

The placing on the body – or on the hands, then on the body – of the *aṅgamantras* is also one of those somehow preliminary operations which, taking place at the beginning of a rite, serve to impregnate the body and the mind of the officiant with the energy and powers of the mantra or of the deity of whom the *aṅgas* represent qualities or fundamental aspects. Necessary at the beginning of all mantric practice, included therefore in the obligatory rites, it is part – as the *nyāsa* of the *riṣyādi* and that of the *mātṛkā* – of the everyday practices of Hinduism.

This rite is also called *sakalīkaraṇa*. The SP defines it thus: ‘One must understand by *sakalīkaraṇa* the placing on the body, beginning with the heart and ending with the hands, and on the fingers beginning with the little finger, of the mantras of which the first is *HṚD*’.73

The six *aṅgamantras* \(with which are associated, in Śaivism, the five *vaktras*, faces or mouths of Śiva, to form the eleven *samhitāmantra*\) are perhaps originally a Śaiva conception, but one finds it in all of purānic or tantric Hinduism and also with the Jains. In spite of their name, the *aṅgas* are not limbs or parts of the body, but elements with symbolic value, corresponding to parts of the mental \(visualised\) image of a divinity or a mantra – or else to the powers which emanate from deity or mantra, such as the rays from the sun74 – and which are placed by *nyāsa* on different points of the human body which is thus put in correspondence with them. These elements are ‘lived’ by the adept and experienced as such and as pervaded by divine powers.75 ‘One must perform the *ṣaḋaṅganyāsa* to acquire perfection of body \(*dehasya siddhaye*\),’ says the *Pārameśvara-saṃhitā* \(7.21\). \(This is apropos the *ajapājapa* of the *hamsamantra* which has no limbs nor body, since it is nothing else than the breath assimilated to the divine energy: besides, the placing of the *aṅgas* of this mantra is in fact done with luminous entities: the sun, moon etc. – the *Hamsopaniṣad*, 12, gives a similar prescription\). The *aṅgas* are the heart \(*hṛdaya*\), the head \(*śiras*\), the tuft of hair \(*śikhā*\), the ‘cuirass’ \(*kavaca*\), the eye \(*netra*\)76 and the weapon \(*astra*\). They are placed respectively on the heart, the head, the place of the tuft, the upper part of the arms close to the shoulders, the eyes or the forehead, and the hands; or, in the case of placings upon the hands, on the fingers and the palm. They are always enumerated and placed in the same order and the way they are formed obeys precise rules, the same, apparently, in all traditions. These mantras are uttered in the following manner: one first utters \(although not always\) *Om* which is followed by one or several monosyllabic *bīja*s77 and sometimes by another element78 – these varying according to the principal mantra. After which comes the enunciation of the *aṅga* in the dative, then the final exclamation, which is, according to the *aṅga* and in order: *namaḥ, svāhā, vaṣaṭ, huṃ, vauṣaṭ* and *phaṭ*.79 This order being fixed, the placings are made sometimes with only this part of the mantra – called *jāti*, that is, species or category – which suffices to represent and identify the *aṅga*.80

Here is, by way of example, the *aṅgamantra* of the triple *vidyā Parā, Parāparā* and *Aparā* according to the MNT, a modern fabrication, to be sure, but propounding many traditional notions:



*Oṃ sāṃ hṛdayāya namaḥ, oṃ sīṃ śirase svāhā*,

*Oṃ sūṃ śikayai vauṣat, oṃ saiṃ kavacāya hum*,

*Oṃ sauṃ netrebhyaḥ vaṣaṭ, oṃ saḥ astrāya phaṭ*


\(ibid., III, 60–61\)


According to certain texts \(as in a tantra cited in the TBhS p. 170\), the hand forms different *mudrā* according to the *aṅgamantra* being placed.

This sixfold placing is sometimes made on the hands before being made on the body: the hand, naturally, receives the *aṅgas* before it places them elsewhere. One has then a variant of the *karanyāsa* mentioned previously – where sometimes \(in the *sakalīkaraṇa* for example\) the *aṅgas* are also placed.

The formula used is a little different from that of the *aṅganyāsa*. It is either a short formula, of the type *anguṣṭhabhyāṃ namaḥ, tarjanibhyām svāhā*, etc.,81 or a more complex one, of the pattern: *bīja* \+ divinity and *aṅga* with the dative, \+ finger or palm with the locative, \+ final exclamation, as, for instance, *hrīṃ śrīmadekajaṭayai hṛdayāya aṅguṣṭhabhyāṃ namaḥ*. The placing is normally made from the thumb to the little finger, then on the two palms. As with other *nyāsas*, it must sometimes be done three times: according to emanation, from the thumb to little finger; according to resorption in reverse; or according to maintenance, going from the base of the middle finger to the index finger.82 Certain texts prescribe different *mudrās* for different placings \(TBhS, p. 170\). The formulas use the locative dual for the fingers and palms because the *nyāsa* must be made simultaneously and separately on the two hands: with the thumb on the fingers of the same hand, with the index finger on the thumb, then with the four fingers of the right hand on the left palm and vice versa.83



## Mātṛkānyāsa

We remain, with the *mātṛkānyāsa*, in the placings which ensure the preliminary divinisation of the officiant, essential for effectively worshipping a deity or a mantra. One thus finds it almost always in the first part of the *pūjā*, although in principle not in the worship of a mantra where, on the contrary, the *nyāsa* of the *ṛṣi* etc. and of the *aṅgas* is always present. This last, however, is usually associated with the placing of all letters of the mantra \(*mantramātṛkānyāsa*\), an operation which one can be all the more tempted to parallel with the *nyāsa* of the *mātṛkā* since the latter, when imposed, is treated as a mantra \(one sometimes says *mātṛkāmantranyāsa*\) with its *ṛṣi, aṅga* etc: all these procedures are repetitive and tend to interpenetrate. The TBhS underlines this when it begins the section of the *mātṛikānyāsa* by citing the *Pheṭkāriṇītantra*: ‘without the placing of their letters, the mantras are dumb. To ensure the success of all the mantras, one must therefore first place the letters’.84 In many cults, we find series of *mātṛkānyāsas* added to the *antar*- and *bahir-nyāsa* which form the *mātṛkānyāsa* in the strict sense, which we describe here, the imposition of the same fifty or fifty-one phonemes associated to cosmic elements \(for example, the *kalās –* see the *kalāmātṛkānyāsa* cited below p. 77\) or the *nyāsa* of the letters of a mantra itself sometimes associated with that of the *mātṛkā*. One obtains in this way series of *mātṛkānyāsas*: nine are enumerated later \(p. 78\) and many other examples could be given.

The *mātṛkā* – or the *mātṛkās*: the ‘little mothers’ – are the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet regarded as discrete aspects of divine energy or, taken all together, as the totality of this energy under the form of speech \(the ŚT 6.2, calls this the phonetic body, *varṇatanu*, of the goddess\) which ‘expresses’ the cosmic manifestation, bringing it into existence by enunciating it. They are the basic phonic elements being used to form the mantras as well as to create, support, animate \(and to reabsorb\) the universe.85 Their placing can therefore appear as an essential factor in the divinisation of the officiant, this they may be in theory if not in practice. The *mātṛkānyāsa* may seem to have a more important role in the traditions where – as in the Śaiva non-dualistic systems of Kashmir – speculations on the cosmic role of the phonemes were particularly developed. The importance and role of the *mātṛkā* is, however, part of a shared Tantric fund, it is therefore not surprising that this *nyāsa* is also found in one form or another in all traditions. It is, however, especially in the Śaiva and Śākta texts that one finds the *mātṛkānyāsa* in the complete form that we will describe now.

The placing of the *mātṛkā* usually follows the *ṛṣyādi*- and *karāṅga-nyāsa*. It is normally divided into three parts. First, since the *mātṛkā* is considered as a mantra, the *ṛṣi* etc., then the *aṅga*, will have first to be imposed. This is arbitrary and is due only to the idea that the *mātṛkā* is, in this context \(insofar as one imposes it?\), to be treated exactly as a mantra. Of course, *ṛṣi*, metre, etc. vary according to the texts and the schools. The *nyāsa* is done in the usual way. It is followed by *karanyāsa* and *aṅga*;- or *karāṅganyāsa* on the hands and/or on the body.86

Then the internal placing, *antarmātṛkānyāsa*, takes place in general a process entirely mental, consisting of concentrating mentally on the six *cakras* \(or *ādhāras*, of the yogic body\) which are tiered from the base of the spinal column to the summit of the head and which must be visualized as lotuses, each with a different colour and a particular number of petals from two to sixteen, on each of which one places mentally one of the fifty phonemes: ‘That which is called the internal *nyāsa* consists of placing and \[mentally\] uttering \(*uccārya*\) each phoneme followed by the word *namaḥ*, going from the *mūlādhāra* to the *brahmarandhra*’.87 The texts in general underline the importance of mental concentration, of the image mentally evoked, of the centres of the yogic body and of the phonemes. The adept must – at least in theory – clearly visualise the *cakras* of his body and ‘see’ there the phonemes he has placed as brilliant letters forming drops of energy whose presence transforms him by awakening these centres of vital and cosmic energy. This mental representation can be accompanied by the recitation, audible or murmured, of the phonemes placed. To this is sometimes added a visualisation of a divinity also mentally perceived in the body.88 ‘This *nyāsa* must be made in meditation, the mind well concentrated. One must visualize Viṣṇu, pure Consciousness, extending from the *mūlādhāra* to the *brahmarandhra* and place the *mātṛkā* with the essence of nectar flowing from the supreme *bindu*, while separately uttering each of the letters’.89 Some texts prescribe, to accompany the placing \(or to precede it\), a *prāṇayāma* where the breath is imagined as associated with different categories of phonemes, then as circulating with them in the entire body which they impregnate with their energy.90 The *antarmātṛkānyāsa* reflects, in this regard, the same spirit as the complex *nyāsas* that we have seen above \(p. 59f.\) where the image of the body mentally evoked plays an essential part.

Finally comes the external placing \(*bahirmātṛkānyāsa*\) of the fifty phonemes in grammatical order from *A* to *KṢA*, on fifty points of the ‘gross’ body, made with the hand – generally with a different *mudrā* according to the part of the body and by enunciating either only the phoneme ‘decorated’ with the *bindu* and followed by *namaḥ*, or these elements preceded by a *bīja* variable according to different schools.91 The external *nyāsa* is often made three times in a different order, according to whether the phonemes are placed emanationwise, from *A* to *KṢA* \(since that is the order which manifests the universe\), or according to conservation, or from *KṢA* to *A*, and in this case it is the process of phonetic resorption which is imposed. We have already seen the triple *sṛṣṭi-stithi* and *saṃhāra-nyāsa* and explained its meaning \(see above p. 65\). The rules of external *nyāsa* vary also according to the texts: the *Tārābhaktisuddhārnava* quotes several.92

There is another placing of the fifty phonemes which is less frequent: the *mālinīnyāsa*, that we have already seen \(above p. 60\) as part of a complex *nyāsa* described in the TĀ. The *mālinī* is a particular order of phonemes, the first being *NA* and the last *PHA* \(it is therefore called *nādiphāntakrama*\): it is the alphabetical form of the goddess Mâlinî, an ‘alphabet deity’ \(see above p. 60 and note 30\). It is found especially in the non-dualist Kashmirian Śaiva system of the Trika \(being described in particular in the third chapter of the MVT, quoted and paraphrased by Abhinavagupta in his PTV\), and also in the Kubjikā tradition. The *mālinī* is considered as an especially effective and energetic form of the phonemes in, the passage that I have just recalled \(TĀ 15.121–142\), its *nyāsa* is prescribed to charge the body with energy \(*nyasecchāktaśarīrārthaṃ bhinnayoniṃ tu mālinīm*\), which is a citation from MVT 3.36. We also meet it in chapter 145 of the *Agni-Purāṇa* \(which is a sign, among others, of the influence of the *kulāmnaya* on this text\). In these cases, the *nyāsa* is not described as part of a complete rite of *mātṛkānyāsa* that we have just seen, and does not take place necessarily at the beginning of the rite. A particular aspect of those *nyāsas* is that the letters of this alphabet are conceived as being disposed vertically from head to feet in the shape of a human body – that of the goddess Mâlinî, and thus, if imposed on the body of an adept, the phonemes are placed in the same way on his body. The operation is therefore somewhat different, but its meaning and effect – a transfer of power embodied in an alphabet – remains the same.93

The three *nyāsas* that we have seen are probably the most frequently and most generally used in Hinduism \(they even appear to some measure in Jainism\). They help us to underline some traits of the theory or practice of the placings. There are, however, other *nyāsas*, probably less common but not uninteresting. We will therefore mention some of them chosen among the most characteristic.

We have already encountered the *pīṭhanyāsa* when dealing with the *ṣoḋhānyāsa*, of which it usually forms a sixth part, having the effect of placing in the body of the adept the fifty-one sanctuaries of the goddess, thereby identifying the body with a sacred world where, on pilgrimage, one goes from one sanctuary to another. One could say in this regard that the pilgrimage is internalised together with the fifty or fifty-one divine places, or centres of divine energy, distributed at different points of Indian territory. This *nyāsa* is both Śaiva and Śākta since it refers to the myth of the dismemberment of the body of Satī.94 There are variants corresponding with variants in the numbers of *pīṭha* being invoked which goes from four to fifty-one \(and according to a later tradition up to 108\). It may be found also in other traditions.95 In fact, the expression *pīṭhanyāsa*, in its most current sense, designates the placing of entities serving as seat or throne \(*pīṭha*\) of the divinity on the lower part of the icon being used for worship. This is well attested in ritual texts \(for example, for the Pāñcarātra in the JayS, chapter 20, pp. 223–227\).96

We have previously seen other placings which divinise or ‘cosmicise’ the adept, as with the placing of the *tattvas* or the *adhvans*. There is also the *nyāsa* of the *kalās*, etc. We can also mention, among such notions, the *mūrtinyāsa* prescribed in the SvT \(1.59–60, vol. 1, p. 50\), where the adept must place on his entire body \(*sarvaṅgeṣu*\) the nine *tattvas* from *kalā* to *śiva*,97 then the *tritattva* \(*ātma, vidyā* and *śiva-tattva*\) covering the thirty-six *tattvas*. He thus places in himself the divinity as it manifests the universe: this is a process of deification.

The *nyāsas* examined so far are essentially those that the adept makes on his own body to purify or transform it. But placings are very often made on objects to which they transmit the power of a deity or mantra; a power that the adept must in theory first assimilate by an initial and more or less complex *nyāsa*.98 This is continually met in the ritual: the placing of a mantra on water used for worship \(*arghya*\) and which, when thus ‘sacralised’, becomes the nectar of Śiva, etc. But there are several more curious ways of proceeding. One could thus mention the ritual for the invocation of Śiva \(*śivāvāhana*\) of the SP1 \(III, 61–64, vol. 1, pp. 184–91\), where the officiant, meditating on the supreme Śiva, utters internally the *bīja Hauṃ*, making it go up from the *mūlādhara* to the *brahmarandhra* and, from his face where it shines like the moon, he visualises it descending in a flower kept in the cup of his hands \(*puṣpāñjaligataṃ dhyatvā*\); he then unites it to the icon \(*mūrti*\) which is used as support for the worship, where the divinity itself will consequently reside: a process which is made entirely mentally \(*dhyāna* or *bhāvanā*\), then by *mudrās*, without there being, strictly speaking, *nyāsa*. We can ask, here, again if we are still in the domain of the placings. In fact, the ritual seems to provide instances where mantras produce an effect without any *nyāsa* being really performed: sometimes a *mudrā* or a gesture accompanies them, sometimes touching with a flower.99 There are also some cases where the *mudrās* seem to be active by themselves.100 It would probably be too much to consider these practices as being strictly speaking placings. They are, however, very near, be it only because they fall within the same problematic: that of the transfer of energy by mental concentration and/or gesture. Or, from a more general point of view, partake of the problem of the efficacy of gesture which in fact lies at the centre \(or in the background\) of the practice of *nyāsa*.

It should be noted also that, in a ritual close in spirit and in its effect, the *jīvanyāsa* \(a term that could be translated as ‘the placing of life’\), such as described in the AgPur \(chapter 96, *śl* 90–93\), the master enunciates the mantras, making them go up from the navel *cakra* to the *dvādaśānta* where they dissolve in the effulgence of the supreme Śiva, who is carried by mental concentration and placed on the *liṅga* being used for the worship, where from now on the god will abide. This purely mental ritual process \(*manasā … dhyatvā*\) is called *nyāsa* \(*jīvanyāso bhaved evam*\). It is followed by other placings on the base of the *liṅga*. Chapter 59 \(this one Vaiṣṇava\) of the same purāṇa, describing the rite of the *adhivāsana* of Viṣṇu, says in a similar way that the deity is installed \(*sthapana*\) in the image which is vitalised \(*sajīvakaraṇa*\) by placing on it the *mūrtimantra*.

The *jīvanyāsa* is normally used for infusing the icon used in worship with life. It can, however, also be used for the adept after the rite of *bhūtaśuddhi* or *dehaśuddhi* \(purification of the elements of the body\), by which the adept reabsorbs the elements of which his body is composed one in the other \(a resorption that makes the gross body disappear\). His vital principle \(*jīva*\) finds itself thus outside of him because it resides, for a moment, in the *dvādaśānta* or in the *bindu*. To this ancient body it is necessary to substitute a new body, pure, subtle, into which one will bring back the principle of life previously displaced. This is done through the rite of *jīvana*, or *sakalīkaraṇa*, where some *nyāsas* are used.101

When a *pūjā* is made to a deity using a diagram, it is by *nyāsas* – normally done using blades of *darbha* grass – that the deity, then his/her *aṅgas*, attributes, and the secondary deities who surround him/her, and so on, are placed in the *cakra* or *maṇḋala* \(see for example, LT chapter 38 or SP3\). It is the same for any rite where a *maṇḋala* is used in which deities are placed \(cf. SP2, vol. 2 p. 320 with regard to *prayaścitta*; or various passages of SP3, etc.\).

In more current use, mantras are put on objects to make them sacred, to purify and protect them etc. Thus the *astramantra* is placed on the doorframe of the door to the sanctuary or on the threshold to protect the place of worship \(SP2, vol. 2, pp. 48 and 356\); or nine deities are placed on the blades of grass used to make a *pavitra* \(ibid. p. 102\); or the mantras *astra, kavaca* and *hṛdaya* are deposited on a receptacle where they constitute a phonic and spiritual ‘casket’ so as to protect these same *pavitras* \(ibid., pp. 130–131\). Examples could be multiplied indefinitely.

But rather than pursue this enumeration, it would now be better, after having seen separately different *nyāsas*, to try to follow – briefly – a whole ritual where placings play a role, whether the ritual is centred on a mantra or is the *pūjā* of a deity.

In the cult of a mantra, the *mantrasādhana* or *puraścaraṇa*, the adept, who has received a mantra from his master through initiation, is to perform rites and follow observances which will give him, in the end, control of the mantra from which he will be able to draw all possible spiritual \(or material\) benefit. Hélène Brunner, in her study already cited \(above, note 29\) on the *sādhaka*, has summarised this ascesis according to the *Mṛgendrāgama* and several other āgamas. There are very similar prescriptions in other Śaiva, Śākta and Vaiṣṇava texts. The schema is generally the same, comprising a certain number of *nyāsas* placed especially at the beginning of the practice in order to communicate to the adept, by several series of placings, the energy of the mantra which will serve him as instrument of action and/or of salvation. As it is usually necessary, during the *sādhana*, to perform a worship to the mantra, this is done using a diagram, on which *nyāsas* will also be made.

The placings are in general in the following order. The *ṛṣyādinyāsa*, a *vyāpaka-nyāsa*102 on the entire body, the *kara*- or *karāṅganyāsa* on the hands, the *hṛdayādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa* \(sometimes also the placing of the five *brahma*- or *vaktra-mantra, sadyojāta* etc.\); then the placing on the body of the letters and/or the words of the *mūla-mantra* \(*mantravarṇa* and *mantrapada-nyāsa*\) follow from those of the *aṅga, upāṅga* and secondary elements.

After this comes the *pūjā* of the mantra, normally done with a *maṇḋala* where the *mūrtimantra* must be placed in the centre by *nyāsa*, which installs there the image of the *mantradevatā*, then, of course, around it, the *aṅga, upāṅga, āvaraṇa*-, or *parivara-mantras* etc.103 The *pūjā* itself and all that follows it then remain to be performed, during which rites other *nyāsas* will take place and where, in particular, it might happen that the *sādhaka* must place the *cakra* on his own body \(cf. YH 3 cited above p. 64\): the succession of the *nyāsas* is considerable, and even quasi-infinite if one thinks that the operations are repeated hundreds or thousands of times.

It is, however, in the *pūjā* of the divinities that the series of *nyāsas* are longest and where they take place most often. This is quite natural considering the number of elements playing a role in the worship at the same time which it is necessary to purify or consecrate, and all the more in the context of manipulation of divine energy and of internalisation or ritual identification which is that of the Tantric *pūjā*. Evidently, we do not meet here as complex *nyāsas* those which took place in initiations: those which are supposed to involve a total spiritual and bodily transformation of the disciple and which, quite naturally, require the most complex and effective procedure for the transfer of energy. The case of the *pūjā* is different and, one could say, simpler. But even here the number and the diversity of the placings are considerable because the worship is often a long process, sometimes involving a number of deities. Now, rites as well as divinities vary according to traditions and sects and even according to worshippers; it would therefore be vain to try to draw up a complete list. It will suffice to end this overview of *nyāsa* by giving a few brief elements concerning the usual succession and function of some of the placings made during the *pūjā*.

There is a brief exposition of *nyāsa* in the cult of Kṛṣṇa, pp. 90–92 of the thesis of R.V. Joshi, *Le rituel de la dévotion kṛṣṇaïte*.104 They are part of the worship of the already consecrated image \(without *nyāsa* apparently\) and are done on the image itself. They are limited to very few elements: *antarmātṛkanyāsa* on six parts of the image which correspond to the six *cakras* of the body; *keśavanyāsa*: the placing of fifty-one phonemes with fifty-one different names of Kṛṣṇa and his Śakti \(*am Keśavāya Kīrtyai namaḥ* etc.\); and lastly a *tattvanyāsa* considered to be particularly important. Mantras accompanied by *mudrās* are used during the rest of the ritual but they are not strictly speaking *nyāsas*, which appear to be remarkably few in number.

Appreciably longer are the following lists which seem much more characteristic. These are drawn from manuals of different epochs. The *Pūjāvidhinirūpaṇa* of Trimalla105 first enumerates only eleven placings, performed at the beginning of the *pūjā*:


1.*ṛṣyādinyāsa;*

2.*ṣaḋaṅganyāsa;*

3.*antarmātṛkānyāsa;*

4.*bahirmātṛkā- \(saṃhāra-sṛṣṭi* and *sthiti*\);

5.*mūlavidyāsaṃpuṭitamātṛkānyāsa*;

6.*nyāsa* of six goddesses;

7.*nyāsa* of five *vaktras* of Śiva, followed by:

8.*ṣaḋaṅganyāsa*;

9.*yoni-nyāsa*: two placings of nine divinities;

10.*nyāsa* of the eight mothers Brahmī etc.

11.lastly, we have the *vyāpakanyāsa* of the *mūlamantra* of Bhuvaneśvarī; followed by various offerings, the *dvārapūjā*, the *pīṭhapūjā*, then the cult of the divinity.


If we look at the *Tāriṇīpārijāta* \(which quotes several Tantras\), we find, in the *pūjā*, after the preliminary libations, the construction and offering of the throne, *prāṇāyāma* and *bhūtaśuddhi*, a series of eleven *nyāsas*:


1.*jīvanyāsa* comprising several elements \(see above note 101\);

2.*antarmātṛkānyāsa* comprising first several placings on the body, then *ṛṣyādi*- and *aṅganyāsa, dhyāna* of the goddess, ending with placings of fifty phonemes in the *cakra*;

3.a triple *bahirmātṛkānyāsa* \(*sṛṣṭi sthiti* and *saṃhāra*\), each comprising *ṛṣyādinyāsa* and *dhyāna* of a *devatā* with the placing of the *mātṛkā*;

4.*kalāmātṛkānyāsa*: the placing of the *mātṛkā* associated with fifty-one *kalās*, preceded by the *ṛṣyādi* and *aṅganyāsa* and a *dhyāna*;

5–10.*ṣoḋānyāsa* \(described according to the *Tantracūḋamaṇi*\) comprising the placing of fifty Rudras, nine *graha*, eight *lokapāla*, Śiva and Śakti on the six *cakras*, Tārā \(*nyāsa* of fifty phonemes on the six *cakra*\), and lastly ten *pīṭhas* with groups of phonemes on ten points of the body;

11.*nyāsa* on the body of the *ṛṣi* etc., then of the *aṅga* \(*karāṅganyāsa*\) *mantra* of Tāriṇi on the hands. After this the adept must trace the *yantra* used for the worship, followed by *nyāsa* of fifty *pīṭha* \(seen previously, p. 74, lastly the rest of the *pūjā*.


The two series do not differ much except by the presence in the second one of the *jīvanyāsa* and of the sixfold *ṣoḋaśanyāsa*. These are simple models. An example of a longer series can be found in the *Balārcanapaddhati*, a Śākta ritual manual published in 1933 in Surat.106 This work is taken simply as an example among others of contemporary prescriptions where the placings are multiplied one could say for pleasure’s sake, without this abundance adding anything to the significance or interest of the operation; it is typical of the Tantric tendency to ritual multiplication and redundancy.

The part of the text concerning *nyāsas* begins with the *bhūtaśuddhi* which is made by placing the fifty phonemes from *A* to *KṢA* on different parts of the body \(ending with the thousand petal lotus at the top of the cranium\). This purification is followed \(as already seen, p. 75: *jīvanyāsa*\) by the ‘infusion of breath’ *prāṇapratiṣṭhā*, realised by *ṛṣyādi-, karāṅga*-, then *vyāpakanyāsa*, followed by a *dhyāna* of the *devatā*, after which the placing of the vital breath itself is made on the body of the adept with the *prāṇapratiṣṭhāmantra*. Then come the following *nyāsas*:


1.*antarmātṛkānyāsa*: first a *prāṇāyāma* – inhaling with the vowels, retaining the breath with the *pavarga* \(the occlusives from *pa* to *ma*\) and expiration with *ya* etc.; *ṛṣyādinyāsa*, then *karanyāsa* with the vowels and the *vargas* of the consonants followed by their *hṛdayādiṣaḋaṅganyāsa. Dhyāna* of the *kuṇḋalinī* coiled up in the *mūlādhāra* with all the phonemes, then mounting with them along the *suṣumnā* – one must visualise the six *cakras* and mentally place there the vowels and the groups \(*varga*\) of consonants.

2.*bahirmātṛkānyāsa*: first, as previously, the *ṛṣyādi-, kara*, and *ṣaḋ aṅganyāsa, then placings of the sixteen vowels \(oṃ aṃ namaḥ to oṃ aḥ namaḥ*\) and of the eight groups of consonants to which one adds two supplementary ‘groups’: *ham-ḥam* and *kṣam* placed on the two hands.

3.*śuddhamātṛkānyāsa*: *ṛṣyādi-, kara* and *aṅganyāsa. Dhyāna* of the goddess associated with fifty phonemes, then *nyāsa* of them on fifty points of the body.

4–5–6.*mātṛkānyāsa* according to *saṃhāra, sṛṣṭi* and *sthiti*.

First, the *ṛṣyādikaraṣaḋaṅganyāsa*. Then a *dhyāna*, different in each of the three cases. Then *nyāsa* of the phonemes ‘decorated’ with *bindu* \(*oṃ kṣaṃ namaḥ* to *om aṃ namaḥ*\) on different points of the body for the *saṃhāranyāsa*; or the phonemes with the *visarga* \(*oṃ aḥ namaḥ* etc.\) for *sṛṣṭi*, or, for *sthitinyāsa*, the phonemes with *bindu* and *visarga*, going from *ḋa* to *ṭha* \(the three placings are to be done in a different order according to whether one is a brahmacārin, a householder or a renouncer\).

7.*śaktimātṛkānyāsa*: *ṛṣyādinyāsa, ṣaḋaṅga*- then *karanyāsa. Dhyāna* of the Śakti, then *mātṛkānyāsa* \(*oṃ aṃ hrīṃ namaḥ* on the head, *oṃ āṃ hrīṃ namaḥ* on the mouth etc.\).

8.*śrīpraṇavakalāmātṛkānyāsa: ṛṣyādi*, then *hṛdayādinyāsa. Dhyāna* of Praṇavakalāmātṛkāsarasvatī, to whom homage is to be paid; then invocation of the fifty *kalās* and their placing with fifty phonemes from *A* to *KṢA*.

9.*Śrīkaṇṭhādimātṛkānyāsa*: *ṛṣādi*, then *hṛdayādinyāsa* of a rather long formula: ‘*oṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ namaḥ śivāya aṃ brahmāṇi māṃ rakṣa rakṣa haṃsavahane mām rakṣa rakṣa padmahaste māṃ rakṣarakṣa hāṃ hrīṃ hrūṃ. aṃ kaṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ aṃ hrāṃ hrīṃ hrūṃ hsauḥ saṃjīvāni hṛdayāya namaḥ’* etc. Next *dhyāna*, then placing of the fifty phonemes according to the pattern: *oṃ hsauḥ aṃ śrīkaṇṭheśa pūrnendarībhyāṃ namaḥ* \(on the head\) etc.

10.*Keśavādinyāsa*: *ṛṣyādinyāsa, dhyāna*, then the placing, after having made mentally the offerings, of the *pūjā* \(*mānasopacaraiḥ saṃpūjyanyaset*\). *Nyāsa* of the fifty phonemes as: *oṃ klīṃ aṃ* etc.; next a *prapañcayāgamātṛkānyāsa* with *ṛṣyādi* and *karanyāsa*, and then an ‘oblation’ \(*homa*\) of phonemes \(*varṇamayam homam*\) with the formula *oṃ hrīṃ kṣam hamasaḥ so’haṃ svāhā* \(for *KṢA*\) up to *oṃ hrīṃ aṃ haṃsaḥ so’haṃ svāhā* \(for *A*\) on different parts of the body.

11.*mūlamantranyāsa*, that is, the main, basic \(*mûla*\) mantra of *Bālātripurasundarī*: *ṛṣyādinyāsa*, then a triple placing of *aiṃ, klīṃ* and *sauḥ* \(which are the *bīja*, the *śakti* and the *kīlaka* of the mantra\). Then a triple *nyāsa* of fifty phonemes by encasing \(*saṃpuṭa*\) each one of them successively between one of the three monosyllables \(e.g. *aiṃ aṃ aiṃ, klīṃ aṃ klīṃ* etc.\).

12.*navayoninyāsa*: nine placings of *aiṃ, klīṃ* and *sauḥ* on the body.

13.*Rityādinyāsa*: ‘*aiṃ rityai namaḥ* on the *mūlādhāra, klīṃ rityai namaḥ* on the heart and *sauḥ mano bhavayai namaḥ* between the eyebrows, such is the *nyāsa*’.

14.*amṛteśvaryādinyāsa: sauḥ amṛteśvaryai namaḥ* between the eyebrows, *klīṃ yogeśvaryai namaḥ* on the heart and *aiṃ viśvayonyai namaḥ* on the *mūlādhāra*.

15.*mūrtinyāsa*: placing on the head, mouth, heart, genitals and feet of the five *brahma*- or *mūrti-mantras:shrauḥ īśanāyamanobhavāyanamaḥ, shreṃ tatpuruṣāya makaradhvapāya namaḥ, shrīṃ shrum aghorāya kandapāryāya namaḥ shrīoṃ vāmadevāya manmathāya namaḥ and shrīoṃ sadyojātāya kāmadevāya namaḥ*

16.*cakranyāsa*: same placing of the five mantras *īśāna* to *sadyojāta* on the five faces \(*pañcavaktāni*\) of, probably, a *liṅga*.

17.\[*nyāsa* given as uncertain: *mūlamantraṣaḋaṅganyāsa: aṃ klīṃ sauḥ*, two times on the heart, tuft etc.\].

18.*bāṇanyāsa*: five placings on the head, neck, face, genitals and heart: *draṃ dravaṇabhānāya namaḥ, driṃ kṣobhanabāṇāya namāh, klīṃ vaśīkaraṇabāṇāya namaḥ, blūṃ ākarśaṇabāṇāya namaḥ* and *saḥ sammohanabāṇāya namaḥ*.

19.*devatānyāsa*: eightfold placing with the *bījas aiṃ, klīṃ, blūṃ, strīṃ* of eight female divinities \(Subhaga, Bhagā, Bhagamālinī, etc.\) on different points of the head, heart, navel and *mūlādhāra*.

20.*pīṭhanyāsa*: placings on different points of the body of entities forming the seat or base \(*pīṭha*\) of the divinity. Then *dhyāna* of Bālātripurasundarī, which completes and ends the whole series of *nyāsas*.


It would have been useful to complete this exposition, which rests on Hindu examples only, with an examination of *nyāsas* such as those practised in Jainism and Buddhism. We have already quoted several examples of practices similar for Hindus, Jains or Buddhists, but it would be interesting to do more and notably to mark in what ways the two last traditions, especially the Buddhist, differ from the first. I have, however, not been able to gather enough documentation to enable me, as for Hinduism, to give a kind of general outline of usual uses in the Jain of Buddhist milieus. What would be especially worth examining are the practices \(along with the discourses that accompany them\), rather than the general problem of the *nyāsa* which, it seems to me, is in many regards the same – *mutatis mutandis* – in all traditions: it is always a matter of making the body or an object sacred by the placing of entities which carry a divine or spiritual force. But this not a topic I can enter into now.

Limited thus to Hinduism, this brief examination of *nyāsa* will, I hope, contribute to show the importance of this ritual practice in the Tantric or ‘tantricised’ forms of the Hindu religion. In the developed and organised form we have described \(and which is still used in India\), the practice is perhaps comparatively recent. But it is very likely that its origin goes back to an ancient past, and, above all, that it is founded on an ancient way of conceiving, apprehending and ‘living’ the body in religion and asceticism. India, indeed, has always invested the religious and the cosmic in the body. It is the place where the sacred geography, the levels and structure of the cosmos, the gods \(‘like cows in a cattle shed’\) are reflected and incarnated, where is played out again on a human scale – but in connection with the divine – the cosmic process of creation, manifestation and resorption. The role and raison d’être of the *nyāsa* is precisely to actualize the cosmic potentialities of the body, to structure it in cosmic correspondences or equipollences, an actualization that is the very goal aimed at by the rites and the religious or spiritual practices. Hence the importance of *nyāsa* as one of the essential components of the practice of the Indian religious man who seeks release not only in spirit but ‘in this life and this body.’
