Those receiving mantrashAstra education should acquire special stava-s beyond those meant for lay devotees. These stava-s are essentially core to the personal practice of the deshika along with his yoga. These are very important for the development of the deshika as a mantra-vAdin. E.g. for saiddhAntika-Shaiva I would say the pa~nchAvarNa stava and vyapohanastava are a must. gUDha-dhyana on the deities unfolding in them is of highest importance to the practice. 

In the end we have to realize that many of our old mantravAdin-s were polymaths of high standing. Think of bhojadeva, aghorashiva, shivadAsasena, vyomashiva etc.  Hence, we should aim high with the objective of also providing an education system for supporting such.
