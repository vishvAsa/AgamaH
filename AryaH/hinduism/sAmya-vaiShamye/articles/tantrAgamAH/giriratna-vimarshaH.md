When the word _Tantra_ is uttered, a layman visualizes a gory scenario of human skulls, blood, alcohol, meat, _śmaśāna_ and copulation in the presence of a mystic in a mysterious atmosphere. The real picture of Tantra is quite different and much more profound than the one mentioned above. The Mandirās across Bhārata i.e. Śrī Śaradā Pīṭha of Kaśmīra to Śrī _Tirupati BālāJī_ and _Śrī Mīnākṣī Ambala Devī_ of south or _Śrī Kāmākhyā Kāmarūpa_ of Assam and _Śrī Jagannātha Svāmī_ of East to _Śrī Somanātha_ and _Śrī Dvārakādhīśa_ of west; all of them subscribe to the Tantra mārga during nitya pūjā and other temple rituals. It shall be noted that the practice of Tantra sādhāna is an inherent part of every school of thought in Bhāratavarṣa, as we will see in subsequent sections of this piece.. Whatever is mentioned in the beginning is merely the glimpse of big Tantra sect. The complet_e sādhanā paddhati_ of _Bhāratavarṣa_ is _Tantra_ based.

Even if this statement receives objection, we observe that the sādhāna of Śaṅkara Vedānta, i.e. Śravaṇa, Manana and Nididhyāsana is a Tāntrika procedure. The former two have aspects of Aparā and Parāparā Tantra pūjā and Nididhyāsana comprises Parā _pūjā._

The paddhati of _Bhakti_ and _Karma_ Yoga also include significant aspects of Tantra sādhanā. On the path of Yoga sādhanā, the supreme objective is the realisation of Parā tattva through the awakening of Kuṇḍalinī also involves Tāntrika vidhi.

> तदोकोऽग्रज्वलनं तत्-प्रकाशित-द्वारो  
> विद्या-सामर्थ्यात् तच्-छेष-गत्य्-अनुस्मृति-योगाच् च  
> हार्दानुगृहीतः शताधिकया 17॥

> The heart of erudite splendours at the time of departure. Being glorified with splendour and graced by _Parameśvara_ the soul thinks of _Brahmaloka_ by the virtue of _Vidyā_. Then it leaves body from 101st _Mūrdhanya_ artery.

The fundamental motive of all traditions in _Sanātana Dharma_ is _mokṣa_. There are two ways of achieving such noble departure, first, by following the vows (anusthānās) of Dharma to leave the body via _suṣumnā_ at time of death, and second, by gaining spiritual attainment while alive. The energy that graces us with spiritual awakening is _Kuṇḍalinī_ – the supreme mother of this world. Now the question is, why is mokṣa attained only when the _ātman_ leaves the body through the _suṣumnā_? The answer is given in various _Veda_ and _Āgama_ scriptures in details. Here, we will take a brief dive into _Mahāmaheśvara Ācārya Abhinavagupta Jī’s_ explanations from his magnum opus _Śrī Tantrāloka_ Ch. – 6 and onwards.

This entire creation (whose dust particle is this universe) is made of two _kāla_ (time) and _deśa_ (space) _adhvā_. The _Kāla adhvā_ has three further parts:

- _Varṇa_
- _Pada_
- _Mantra_

The _Deśa adhvā_ has three parts too:

- _Kalā_
- _Tattva_
- _Pura_

All of them reside in _prāṇa_:

> अध्वा समस्त एवायं  
> षड्विधोऽप्य् अतिविस्तृतः।  
> यो वक्ष्यते स एकत्र  
> प्राणे तावत् प्रतिष्ठितः॥5॥

There are two modes of _kalama_ of these _adhvās_. One is _krama_ and another one is _akrama_. This _Kāla_ of the form of _krama_ and _akrama_ is called as _Parā Saṁvid_.She alone is the _Parā Śakti Bhagavatī Śrī Kālī,_ exalted by the Devās:

> क्रमाक्रमात्मा कालश्च  
> परः संविदि वर्तते।
> काली नाम परा शक्तिः  
> सैव देवस्य गीयते॥7॥

This _Parā Śakti Saṁvid_ only vibrates as _prāṇa vṛtti_ in external world. While deliberating the world as separate from her, she resides as _Viśvottīrṇa,_ like the vastness of space and hence she is called as _śūnya_. When the _yogī_ deliberates _netī_–_netī_ (neither _bhāva_ nor _abhāva_; the mid-stream _suṣumnā_) he earns the supreme state.

> नेति नेति विमर्शेन  
> योगिनां सा परा दशा॥10॥

The great _Gurus_ have said that this _Parā_ _Saṁvid_ alone transformed herself into _prāṇa_ upon which the manifest world is dependent for its sustenance:

> तेनाहुः किल संवित्  
प्राणे परिणता तथा।
अन्तःकरणतत्त्वस्य  
वायुर् आश्रयतां गतः॥12॥

Hence, the _kāla adhvā_ is merely a display of _Saṁvid Śakti_ who could be realised when the seeker traverses through the _suṣumnā_. In 8th chapter _Mahāmaheśvara Ācārya Abhinavagupta Jī_ further says that all _adhvās_, entire creation, arteries and _cakra_ etc. are evolved from _Saṁvid_ only.:

> संविद्द्वारेण तत्सृष्टे  
शून्ये धियि मरुत्सु च।
नाडीचक्रानुचक्रेषु  
बहिर्देहेऽध्वसंस्थितिः॥4॥

Hence, it is must for the seeker to know about all the _adhvās_ and then to dissolve them in reverse order (dissolve subordiante in the Lord of _adhvā_). The _deha_ shall be dissolved in _prāṇa_ and the _prāṇa_ shall be dissolved in _Buddhi_. This _Buddhi_ dissolves in _Saṁvid_ and the seeker is liberated from this web of world baked by fire of _pralaya_:

> ज्ञात्वा समस्तम् अध्वानं  
तदीशेषु विलापयेत्।
तान् देहप्राण-धी-चक्रे  
पूर्ववद् **गालयेत्** क्रमात्॥7॥  
तत् समस्तं स्व-संवित्तौ,  
सा संविद्-भरितात्मिका।  
**उपास्यमाना** संसार-  
सागर-**प्रलयानलः**॥8॥

Life enters the body through the _suṣmnā_, hence that is also the path of liberation. The scriptures tell us that the _suṣmnā_ evolved first, followed by other essential arteries which constitute the body.

## Kuṇḍalinī

_Kuṇḍalinī_, the _Visarga Śakti_ of _Śiva_ rests in the _Mūlādhāra_. She is coiled 3½ times over the _paścimābhimukha_ _liṅga_. The 3½ coils represent _prameya_, _pramāṇa_, _pramātā_ and _pramā_ respectively. _Kuṇḍalinī Śakti_ comprises various types like _Śakti Kuṇḍalinī, Prāṇa Kuṇḍalinī_ and _Parā Kuṇḍalinī_. Further classifications exist based on how the seeker wishes to attain her grace.

## Tantra Sādhanā

Tantra practice is divided into two ways: extrinsic and intrinsic. The extrinsic practices include various practices like _japa, pūjā, śravaṇa_ and _manana_ whereas _Nirvikalpa_ stage and _Nidadhyāsana_ are intrinsic procedures. Hence, we can say that every method of worship has basic to advanced elements of _Tantra sādhanā_.

Apart from other religions like _Buddhism_, _Sikhism_ and _Jainism_, in _Sanātana dharma_ under _sākāra_ worship there are five principle Deities. All other forms of Devatā are manifested from these five alone. These five are:

- _Śiva_
- _Śakti_
- _Viṣṇu_
- _Gaṇeśa_
- _Saura_

These five together are called as _Pañcamahādeva_ or _Pañcāyatana_:

> गणेशश्चापि सूर्यश्च  
विष्णू रुद्रस्तथैव च।
पूजयेन् मध्य ईशानी  
पञ्चायतनमीदृशीम्॥

The destination of all the _sādhanā_–_s_ is to lead the _sādhaka_ to the formless _nirvīkalpa_ _samadhi_ state. The _Sādhanā_ of these five deities have multiple variations within the tradition. We will look at those schools one by one.

## Śaiva mata

The _Śaiva_ traditions are of three types i.e. _Dvaita_ (Dualistic), _Dvaitādvaita_ and Advaita. They have evolved from the permutation and combination of five heads of _Bhagavān Śiva_ which are _Īśāna_, _Tatpuruṣa_, _Sadyojāta_, _Vāmadeva_ and _Aghora_. _ParamaŚiva_ discoursed ten _Dvaitaāgamas_, eighteen _dvaitādvaitaāgamas_ and sixty-four _Advaitaāgamas_ from these heads. The three streams have various schools within amongst them a few are as given below. These names are as given in _SarvaDarśanaSaṁgraha_:

- _Lakulīśa Pāśupata_
- _Māhśevara Darśana_
- _Pratyibhijñā(Trika)_
- _Raseśvara_

Apart from it there are other schools also which are _Siddhānta Śaiva_, _Vīraśaiva_ and _Ekavīra Śaiva_. _Nātha Sampradāya_ and _Siddha_ schools are also part of _Śaiva_ dar_śana._

## Śakta mata

> नम॑स्ते अस्तु वि॒द्युते॒ नम॑स्ते स्तनियि॒त्नवे॑।
नम॑स्ते अ॒स्त्वश्म॑ने॒ येना॑ दू॒डाशे॒ अस्य॑सि॥१॥  
नम॑स्ते प्रवतो नपा॒द॒ यत॒स्तपः॑ स॒मूह॑सि।  
मृ॒डया॑ नस्त॒नूभ्यो॒ मय॑स्तो॒केभ्यस्कृधि॥२॥  
प्रव॑तो नपा॒न्नम॑ ए॒वास्तु॒ तुभ्यं॒ नम॑स्ते हे॒तये॒ तपु॒षे च कृणमः।  
वि॒द्मे ते॒ धाम॑ प॒रमं गुहा॒ यत् स॑मु॒द्रे अन्तर्निहि॑तासि॒ नाभिः॑॥३॥  
यां त्वा॑ दे॒वा असृ॑जन्त॒ विश्व॒ इषुं॑ कृण्वा॒ना अस॑नाय धृ॒ष्णुम्।  
सा नो॑ मृड वि॒दथे॑ गृणा॒ना तस्यै॑ ते॒ नमो॑ अस्तु देवि॥४॥**

The concept of the worship of divine Energy is as old as Bhārata is. The worship of _Śakti_ is to worship the real _Citi_ or _Sva_ of _Śiva_ which when transformed as _citta_, leads to a union with the _Śiva-tattva_. The motive of _Śakti Sādhanā_ is to attain the same _Śiva_ being of self.

She is worshipped as the _Vidyut_, the one who echoes as word, she only appears as _Vajra_ which slays the bonds of avidyā. Being _Vidyut_ she only resides as _Kuṇḍalinī_ in _Mūlādhāra_ while being coiled 3½ times.

She manifests in nine forms as the _nava-nāda_, the primordial sounds of the universe –

> गौ॒रिर्मि॑मायसलि॒लानि॒तक्ष॒त्येक॑पदीद्वि॒पदी॒साचतु॑ष्पदी।
अ॒ष्टाप॑दी॒नव॑पदीवभू॒वषी॑स॒हस्रा॑क्षरापर॒मेव्यो॑मन्॥

The nine _pada_ or steps of _Śakti_ are akin to nine _nāda_. It is also She who becomes the one with thousand feet in _Sahasrāra_. This _Nāda_ only appears as _Vāk_ which are _Parā_, _Paśyantī_, _Madhyamā_ and _Vaikharī_.

> च॒त्वारि॒वाक्परि॑मिताप॒दानितानि॑विदुर्ब्राह्म॒णायेम॑नी॒षिणः॑।
गुहा॒त्रीणिनिहि॑ता॒नेड्ग॑.यन्तितु॒रीयं॑वा॒चोम॑नु॒ष्या॑वदन्ति॥४५॥

There are four _Vāk_ which are known by the _Yogīs_. Three reside in subtler forms while humans speak the fourth one. These _Vāk_ only are called as _Kāmarūpa pīṭha_ or _Svayaṁbhūliṅga_, _Pūrṇāgirī Pīṭha_ or _Bāṇaliṅga_, _Jālandhara Pīṭha_ or _Itaraliṅga_ and _Uḍḍīyāna Pīṭha_ or _Paraliṅga_ respectively. These four are also called as _Śāntā_, _Vāmā_, _Jyeṣṭhā_ and _Raudrī_. Being in _Dvaita_ stage it is must for seeker to earn the merits of _Yoga_. When someone surrenders self to her, he never treads on wrong path. _Bhagavatī_ herself protects her children; this is the meaning of second _Śruti_ mentioned in the beginning. When the _Yogī_ worships this mighty mother, she bestows upon him all her grace for she resides in the great ocean of the cavity of his heart. We offer salutations to the weapons of this mighty _Śakti_ for she holds them for our protection. It is the same Śakti who resides in one or the other form in various devatās, and appears as the One whenever required.

These four _śrutis_ of a _sūkta_ as given in _Atharvaveda_ show the complete cycle of delusion of _Śiva_ and then his recognition of his _Sva_.

There is one more _Sūkta_ in _Vaidika_ scriptures, _Ākūti sūkta_ which talks about the _Icchā_, _Jñāna_ and _Kriyā Śakti_ and says that they are the _Śakti of one Devī Ākūti._

_Śakti_ is the manifestation of _Citi_ of _Brahma_ that first appears as _Cid_ then _Ānanda_, _Icchā_, _Jñāna_ and _Kriyā_. These are written as अ, आ, इ, उ and ए respectively. These are the vowels and with consonant they are called as _Mātṛkā Cakra_. This _Mātṛkā Cakra_ manifests as this world as a display of the _Śakti_ of _Śiva_. The world is an image that is displayed by Śakti in Śiva’s own heart. She becomes the mirror of this magnificent display. It shall be understood that there is no _Bimba_ (object) whose _Pratibimba_ the world is. This is merely the amorous play of _Śiva_ and _Śakti_. The only reality is you who resort in the body. Eternally, it is you within whose heart the _Śakti_ has created the world. _Icchā_, _Jñāna_ and _Kriyā_ are also known as _Parā_, _Parāparā_ and _Aparā_. These three are the three spikes of a trident called Trika _Triśūla_. Above this trident resides _Bhagavatī Śrī Unmanā_, who is also hailed as _Parābhaṭṭārikā,_ she only is _Citi_. This trident manifests as _Pañcapretāsana_. The _Bhagavatī Śrī Tripura Sundarī_ graced on the _Pañcapretāsana_ is the pictorial depiction of this stage of _Śakti_. However, that is a subject of separate discussion. The _Parābhaṭṭārikā Bhagavatī_ mentioned here is of _nirākāra_ form (Formless); _Parābhaṭṭārikā_ only appears in _sākāra_ forms as _Daśa Mahāvidyā_:

- _Bhagavatī Śrī Kālī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Tārā_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Mahātripura Sundarī_
- _Bhagavatī Srī Bhuvaneṣvarī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Tripura Bhairavī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Ccchinnamastā_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Dhūmāvatī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Bagalāmukhī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Mātaṅgī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Kamalā_

The _Krama Daraśana_ of _Kāśmīra_ talks about twelve forms of _Śrī Kālī_. These are mentioned in scriptures like _Cidgagana Candrikā_, _Śrīmat Tantrāloka_ and _Śrīmat Kramanaya Pradīpikā_. The references pointed in this article are to direct seekers to deeper reading and reflection.

_Parābhaṭṭārikā_ alone appears as _Nava Durgā_:

- _Bhagavatī Śrī Śailaputrī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Brahmacāriṇī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Candraghaṇṭā_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Kūṣmāṇāḍā_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Skandamātā_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Kātyāyanī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Kālarātrī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Mahāgaurī_
- _Bhagavatī Śrī Siddhidātrī_

_Parabhāṭṭārikā_ only appears as _Trī Śakti_:

- _Śrī Mahākālī_
- _Śrī Mahālakṣmī_
- _Śrī Mahāsarasvatī_

She also manifests as _Bhagavatī Śrī Kubjikā_ whose _sādhanā vidhāna_ is unique though the _Siddhānta_ is same.

All these forms of _Bhagavatī_ are a representation of the stage of _Dvaitādvaita_. As the _sākāra svarūpa_ of _Brahmavidyā_, they might appear different but are essentially manifestations of the same Supreme tattva. When any of these forms is worshipped by a seeker, while knowing the fact that he is worshipping _sākāra svarūpa_ of _Brahmavidyā_ he finally attains the _Anuttara_ stage.

The worship practices of these forms are divided by _Parama Śiva_ in six ways, for the sake of seekers. These six paths are called as _Ṣaḍāmnāya_, the six _Āmnāya_ evolved from the mighty heads of _Bhagavān_ are:

- _Pūrva Āmnāya_
- _Paścima Āmnāya_
- _Dakṣiṇa Āmnāya_
- _Uttara Āmnāya_
- _Ūrdhva Āmnāya_
- _Anuttara Āmnāya_

All of them have their different attributes which are mentioned in scriptures like _Śrīmat Tantrāloka_. There are infinite _āmnāya_ to reach to the supreme stage. These six are mentioned as per our eligibility as sādhakas. _Mahāmaheśvara Ācārya Abhinavagupta Jī_ says that even if some _sarvaVāk siddha_ attempts to explain all the _srotas_, he would get tired but would not be able to explain all the _srotas_:

> अपि सर्वसिद्धवाचः क्षीयेरन्दीर्घकालमुद्गीर्णाः।
न पुनर्योन्यानन्त्याद् उच्यन्ते स्रोतसां संख्याः॥३१४॥

Hence, it is the duty of pupil to ask his _Guru_ for his _āmnāya krama_ and then shall begin the worship with full devotion for _Guru_ and _Bhagavatī_. Seeker shall never discriminate between the _Guru_ and _Bhagavatī_ if the seeker aims the _Para tattva_.

The _Śakti sādhanā_ makes you realize that this entire world is your own play. This ization dawns through _jñāna_. J_ñāna_ is again of two types, _Śāstra jñāna_ and _Pauṁsna jñāna_ (earned by realisation in short). There are various solutions to realise this fact, these are:

- _Anupāya_
- _Śāmbhavopāya_
- _Śāktopāya_
- _Āṇavopāya_

The first one means, no solution. This is the objective of _sādhanā_. The second stage is the Nirvikalpa stage, this again is a high-level stage in which someone rarely reaches. The next two stages are for the seekers. These have furthermore solutions which shall be known from the respective texts only. The able _Guru_ only decides at what level the disciple is and makes him begin the _sādhanā_.

The _Śakti sādhanā_ can also be categorized as follows:

- _Parā_: The state in which seeker resorts as one with _Parama Śiva_
- _Parāpara_: The state in which the seeker shall contemplate that he is one with _Parama Śiva_.
- _Apara_: All extrinsic _sādhanā_ including hymn recitation, _Yoga_, _japa_, devatā-pujan, _Śaiyā sādhanā_, _Śmaśāsna sādhanā_ and extrinsic _Cakra_ worship of all types. These practices slowly removes the notion of duality however as per _Śrī Gurudeva_ the _japa_ is the most simple and full proof way to attain the objective.

_Śakti_ _Sādhanā_ tradition comprises various ways, which are called as _ācāra_. The famous _ācāras_ are:

- _Vedācāra_
- _Śaivācāra_
- _Vāmācāra_
- _Dakṣiṇācāra_
- _Kulācāra_
- _Kaulācāra_
- _Trikācāra_

There is another category which is as:

- _Vedācāara_
- _Vaiṣṇavācāra_
- _Śaivācāra_
- _Dakṣiṇācāra_
- _Vāmācāra_
- _Siddhāntācāra_
- _Kulācāra_

All these _ācāras_ have their separate lineages and definition of _Parātattva_, the seeker any _ācāra_, no matter what his stage is, shall first take _dīkṣā_ of another _ācāra_ he wishes to adopt and then he shall begin his _sādhanā_ anew.

Interestingly, seekers also are categorised as per their _bhāva_:

- _Paśu_
- _Vīra_
- _Divya_

These _sādhanā_ techniques awaken the _Kuṇḍalinī_ of seeker, this makes seekers eligible for realisation of supreme truth. The _Kuṇḍalinī jāgaraṇa_ is for sure, no matter seeker is follower of _Jñāna mārga_, _Bhakti mārga_, _Karma mārga_, _Prema mārga_, _Raja Yoga_ etc.

These varied aspects of _Śakti Sādhanā_ are great boon to humanity, which are treasured by our great _ṛiṣis_ since ages. Those who are blessed to tread on this path only are called as _Śākta_. The beauty of _Śakti_ _Sādhanā_ is that no matter what you call yourself, if you are practising any _sādhanā_ within _Sanātana dharma_ you are somehow doing _Śakti sādhanā_. One will also find the presence of Śākta darśana in Buddhism and its influence in Jainism and Sikhism. For instance, in Sikhism, the 10th Guru of the order himself wrote the scripture on _Śakti sādhanā_ titled _Śrī Daśama Grantha Sāhib_, published from Lucknow and available with a Hindi translation today.

## Vaiśṇava Mata

There are three schools of _Tantra_ in _Vaiṣṇava Mata_. These are:

- _Bhāgavata_
- _Pāñcarātra_
- _Vaikhānasa_

These three continue to be practiced world-wide by the followers of the _Vaiṣṇava Mata_. The _Āgama_ scriptures of these schools are widely available with us.

## Gāṇapatya

The worshippers of _Śrī Gaṇeśa_ are called as _Gāṇapatyas_. The tradition of _Śrī Gaṇeśa_ worship is quite common and there are a lot of scriptures available which comprise of _Mantra, Stotra, Sahasranāma_ and _Kavaca_ as well as Yogic sādhanās. The _Śrī Śakti Saṁgama Tantra_ (1.6.139) talks about the eight schools of _Śrī Gaṇeśa Sādhanā_ however the names are not given. There is list of _Śrī Gaṇeśa Tantra-s_ also in the _Paryāya Nirṇaya section of the_ same scripture. He is also worshipped as per _Advaita_ traditions. The _Diṇḍima_ commentary of _Śaṅkara Digvijaya_ of _Ānandagiri_ talks about six schools of _Śrī Gaṇeśa_. These are:

- _Śrī Mahāgaṇapati_
- _Śrī Haridrā Gaṇapati_
- _Śrī Uccchiṣṣṭa Gaṇapati_
- _Śrī Navanīta Gaṇapati_
- _Śrī Svarṇa Gaṇapati_
- _Śrī Santāna Gaṇapati_

## Saura Mata

Once upon a time, the _Saura sādhanā_ prevailed in _Bhārata_. There were prominent places of Saura _mata_ and the _Siddhāśrama_ is one such place where even today the seekers practice _Saura Sādhanā_. The _Veda Gāyatrī sādhanā_ is essentially the worship of _Savitā Deva Sūrya_. _Śrī Śakti Saṁgama Tantra_ talks about the five schools within this tradition, however, does not mention the names. Nowadays, the _Saura sādhanā_ is restricted to a very few esoteric _Siddhas_. This tradition also comprises Advaita and _Dvaita sādhanā_ etc.

Apart from these there are _Tāntrika_ practices of Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs also.

To conclude, the elaborations are a glimpse of the pervasiveness of _Tantra_ as a _sādhanā-paddhati_ and why it is imperative that we begin to understand what its key principles are.
