  <p>The Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena</p>
<p>Reconsidered</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The hill near the village Ramgarh, on whose top (height 184 m) the so-called ‘Muṇḍeśvarī Temple’ is found, 1 belongs to the northern spurs of the Kaimur Range, the eastern embranchment of the Vindhyas. It is situated in the Kaimur District of southwest Bihar, 70 km SE of Vārāṇasī, 170 km SW of Patna, 60 km NW of Rohtasgarh on the River Son, and 8 km SW of Bhabua, as the crow flies.</p>
<p>The present octogonal temple has attracted the attention of scholars since the early days of Francis Buchanan, whose description had been used by Mont gomery Martin in his Eastern India, which appeared in 1838. Buchanan reports that his description is based on the drawings of a painter whom he had sent up to the place, which might have taken place in January 1813. 2 A print based on this was included in Martin’s Eastern India (Plate 78). Earlier a drawing of the temple had been made by Thomas Daniell (Plate 79), who probably visited the site in February 1790, 3 and whose engraving, published in 1808, might have been known to Buchanan. 4 As can be derived from both pictures, the temple was largely covered by a mound of rubble overgrown with plants and trees. The site was excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) after a visit of Theodor Bloch in 1902. 5 Bloch was also the first to report on the inscription that is the subject of this paper. He notes the following (op. cit. 43):</p>
<p>[. . . ] Among the d´ebris the second half of an inscribed stone has been found, the first half of which had been sent to the Indian Museum Calcutta in 1891.</p>
<p>∗ The first version of this article was published in Indo-Iranian Journal 56.3–4 (2013), 263–77. This double issue of IIJ contained the articles based on papers given at the symposium Epigraphical Evidence for the Formation and Rise of Early Saivism ´ , which was held at the University of Groningen, 4–5 June 2012.</p>
<p>1 The temple and hill are named after the goddess who today is the central focus of worship (see Jayasal 2017, 117 Fig. 340).</p>
<p>2 Nuess 2003, 533 (based on Oldham 1926). Martin 1838 I, 456: ‘I could not conveniently visit the place, but sent a painter, who drew the most remarkable part. The temple, now very ruinous, has been an octagon supported by four columns (E).’</p>
<p>3 Nuess 2003, 533 (based on Archer 1969).</p>
<p>4 The drawing was engraved by Thomas and his brother William and published in Antiq uities of India, December 1808.</p>
<p>5 Bloch 1902–03, 42 f. Neuss 2003, 533 f.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>This stone is dated year 30, the 22nd of Kārttika, which must be referred to the Harṣa Era, thus corresponding with 635 A.D.</p>
<p>Plate 78 Plate 79</p>
<p>Buchanan: sketch ad 1813 6 Daniell: drawing ad 1790 7</p>
<p>The two halves of the stone have been combined and were first edited and published by R.d. Banerji in Epigraphia Indica IX (1907–08).</p>
<p>This Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription of the Time of Udayasena, Year 30 has gone through altogether five editions (R.d. Banerji 1907–08, ṇG. Majumdar 1920, P.K. Agrawala 1987, P.R̥Srinivasan 1991, J. Neuss 2003), but in spite of the work done by these excellent epigraphists, I think there is still room for improvement. 8</p>
<p>The temple on Muṇḍeśvarī Hill</p>
<p>Before discussing the inscription in more detail, however, a few words should be said about the temple. Joanna Williams gives the following assessment.</p>
<p>Fragments at the site extend from the sixth century until the eighth or later. On stylistic grounds the surviving octagonal shrine should belong to the first half of the seventh century. [. . . ] 9</p>
<p>6 Martin 1838, Vol. I, opposite p. 474 (Pl. V No. 1, ‘Temple of Mundeswari’). 7 ‘The Temple of Mandeswara near Chaynpore, Bahar’. C f. Archer 1980, Plate 76. 8 A recent new edition was made by Arvind Kumar Singh, which is included in Jayaswal et al. 2017. I will refer to this as Singh (2017).</p>
<p>9 Williams 1982, 166 f. Cf. Deva 1988 in EITA II.1, 119: ‘If the foundation inscription</p>
<p>20 / The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin 393</p>
<p>The interior of the temple consists of a central pavillion supported by four rucaka pillars and encircled by a pradakṣiṇapatha, which enshrines a tall, c. 13th-century caturmukhaliṅga.10</p>
<p>Plate 80 Plate 81</p>
<p>Daniell: drawing ad 1790 11 The liṅga in ad 2008</p>
<p>The hill, temple, surrounding d´ebris, and the inscription have been thoroughly examined by Jürgen Neuss (2003). 12 Neuss subscribes to the almost universally accepted theory that dates the oldest elements of the architecture of the present</p>
<p>refers to the Harṣa Era, yielding a date of A.D. 636, the temple stylistically can be assigned to the same period.’</p>
<p>10 Deva 1988 in EITA II.1, 119.</p>
<p>11 ‘Interior of the temple of Mandeswara near Chaynpore, Bahar.’ Cf. Archer 1980, Plate 77.</p>
<p>12 More recently another inventory of the remains on the hill was made by Fiona Buckee (2008). She generously shared her photo documentation with me. In 2018 Buckee presented a paper The Curious Case of the Octagonal Temple: A Revised History of the Temples of Mundeshvari Hill in the 24th Conference of the EASAA in Naples, 2–6 July 2018. I refer to this as Buckee forthcoming. Again another extensive survey of the archaeological remains of the hill, in situ and in museums, was made by Meera Sharma 2017. It is included in Jayaswal et al. 2017. This latest inventory is not incorporated in the present essay. Finally an extensive treatment of the historic evidence regarding Muṇḍeśvarī Hill is found in Bakker 2014, 221–39.</p>
<p>temple to the first half of the seventh century. 13 However, Neuss rejects one piece of evidence used to endorse this theory, viz. the alleged contemporaneity of the temple and the inscription. 14</p>
<p>The date of the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription</p>
<p>Neuss’s main arguments run as follows. Firstly, there is no reason to assume that ‘the year 30’ refers to the Harṣa Era, as has been done by all scholars following Bloch (see above), apart from Majumdar, who takes it to refer to the Gupta Era. Nuess refers to Asher, who had argued ‘that in the ancient written documents of eastern India, time was almost invariably marked according to the regnal year of a current monarch’, 15 and, Neuss continues, ‘that there is thus no basis to connect the date of our inscription with any known era’. 16</p>
<p>Secondly, a detailed palæographic investigation leads him to the final obser vation that,</p>
<p>As the Muṇḍeśvarī record still uses the older tripartite ya, I would suggest that the Muṇḍeśvarī inscription must have been engraved between A.D. 570 and A.D. 590, and that the script shows influences from writing habits developed in Western India. 17</p>
<p>I subscribe tentatively to Neuss’s analysis and would therefore propose to date the inscription to the second half of the sixth or early seventh century. It follows that the otherwise completely unknown Mahāsāmanta Udayasena was a feuda tory, not of Harṣavardhana, but of the Maukharis of Kanauj, and most likely ruled under Avantivarman, the last of the great Maukhari kings of Kanauj, whose reign spanned the final decades of the sixth and beginning of the sev enth century. The inscription is not the foundation charter of the main temple itself, but it testifies to a historical process in the second half of the 6th century, in which the building of a new religious complex on the hill was in full swing.</p>
<p>Neuss presents a new edition of the inscription and his interpretation thereof has important consequences for his understanding of the type and development of the sacred complex on the hill. The reading and interpretation of the in scription that I present here differ significantly from the one given by Neuss. Our disagreement is mainly the result of a different interpretation of the signs that are found at the end of line 6 and 11 and in the middle of line 16:   . Neuss, following Majumdar, takes these as daṇḍas that conclude a sentence.</p>
<p>13 Neuss 2003, 543. The temple has a long history of reconstructions. Its architectural history has been investigated by Adam Hardy and Fiona Buckee. Buckee (forthcoming) concludes that the present octagonal shape of the temple may go back to a reconstruc tion, influenced by nearby Suri tombs, made in the 16th or 17th century. The present appearance of the temple is due to a ‘creative restauration’ made between 1913–1916.</p>

<p>20 / The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin 395</p>
<p>In my view this interpretation is untenable, because it would break up the sentence constructioṇIn line 6 the Sanskrit syntax requires that we do not read a pause after ◦devakulasya, since this is the adject of upanibandhaḥkāritaḥin line 9. If we would take this sign as a daṇḍa in line 11, it would separate the subject from the predicate: . . . ◦upakaraṇāni &hellip; dattāni (l. 12). For these reasons I follow the suggestion first made by Banerji to the effect that, ‘The sign at the end of this line has been added in order to fill up the vacant space.’ 18 Similar scroll-work is, for instance, found at the end of line 3 (after the dou ble daṇḍa that concludes v. 4) of the so-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśānavarman’. 19 In line 16 of our inscription the double scroll sign is used to fill up the line and, concomitantly, to mark a new paragraph, uktaṁca, so that the concluding, exhortative verse could begin on a new line.</p>
<p>My edition is presented in two ways: first, a literal transliteration of what is readable; second, an edited version with conjectural emendations and stan dardized orthography. My study is based on the estampage supplied by Sten Konow and published by Banerji in Epigraphia Indica IX (Plate 82).</p>

I do not see the na (according to Banerji added above the line), but rather think that this is the vowel mātrā i (similar to the i above the n in nikāyaṁin the next line) of the akṣara ya, of which the third vertical stroke may have broken off. It looks as if there is an anusvāra above this i-mātrā, but this may be just damage or there might have been one more akṣara on this line, pressed together due to lack of space (cf. the haplography that occurs at the end of line 8 where ◦dvayaṁshould be read as ◦dvayasya).</p>

<p>22 Irregular for triṁśattame, maybe under influence of the following dvāviṁśatime, which is haplographic for dvāviṁśatitame (Oberlies 2003, 127). As argued above the year 30 is best explained, if we assume that it refers to regnal years. The only dated Maukhari inscription (the Haraha Inscription of Īśānavarman, EI XIV, 110–20) is assigned to the Vikrama Era, 611 (ad 554). The dates on the Maukhari coins are problematic: difficult to read and difficult to assign to any known era (see Burn 1906; EI XIV, 113; HCI III, 70). I presume with Asher, Neuss, and Singh that the present ‘year 30’ refers to the thirtieth year of Udayasena’s governorship (rājya).</p>
<p>23 Maybe to be emended to asyām. . As it stands, I take this synonymous with atra or iha. 24 The reading ◦rājodayasena◦ was first proposed by Banerji and taken over by all later editors. That we are here concerned with a feudatory rather than a sovereign king follows from his titles (three (of five) Mahāśabdas), bestowed upon him by a suzerain: mahāsāmanta, ‘feudatory’; mahāpratīhāra, ‘chief chamberlain’; mahārāja, ‘viceroy’. The monarch who had bestowed these titles may have been either Sarvavarman or Avanti- ´ varman, Maukhari kings of Kanauj, who were themselves called great on account of their overlordship of Magadhā’ (magadhādhipatyamahatām), in the Sirpur Lakṣmaṇa Temple Stone Inscription of the time of Sivagupta Bālārjuna ´ (Shastri 1995 II, 143; EI XI, 191). 25 For this reading see above n. 20 on p. 396. As has been remarked by Sanderson (e mail 15-2-2012), the beginning with bhā suggests a Pāśupata name, but no satisfactory interpretation has suggested itself. I conjecture bhānūdayim. , assuming that the curve to the left at the bottom (note also the little vertical stroke above the akṣara) indicate the long vowel ū; cf. nu in line 18. The noun udayin is declined here as a vowel stem in i (Oberlies 2003, 94).</p>
<p>26 Banerji reads maṭham etat kāritaka ˙m, but Majumdar noted that the inscription actually reads mayetat kāritakam. . We agree with Banerji, just as Neuss (cf. Srinivasan 1991, 315). The end of this sentence kāritakaṁremains noticeable (cf. Fleet in CII III, 69, 113, 135; Oberlies 2003, 267 n. 3).</p>
<p>27 The syntax requires that we read ◦dvayasya, as first suggested by Majumdar.</p>
<p>28 The reading copanibandhaḥ, proposed by Banerji, was taken over by all later editors.</p>

<p>Success!</p>
<p>In the thirtieth year, at the twenty-second day of Kārttika; here, at the above year, month and day—within the reign of the illustrious Mahāsāmanta, Mahāpratīhāra, Mahārāja Udayasena—after having requested the permission of the head of the community (kulapati), Bhānūdayin (?), and the Temple Council, General Gomibhaṭa has commissioned the building of this accomo dation as part of the Vinīteśvaramaṭha, in order to increase the merit of his father, mother, and himself.</p>
<p>He has made an assignment to the temple of the illustrious Nārāyaṇa of a pala of lampoil and two prasthas of rice for the daily food-offering (to the deity), permanently, for as long as sun and moon exist, to be taken from the storeroom that belongs to the temple of the illustrious Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin.</p>

<p>29 This is a real crux interpretum. Banerji (followed by Singh) proposed to read: vicchitti viśrānta◦. Majumdar read vicchitti nta◦ and acknowledged that he was ‘unable to interpret this passage’. Srinivasan reads: vici (chehitti) . . . . Agrawala: vicchitti nimitta◦; Neuss: vicchittimānta◦. I tentatively read: vicitrakarmāntatantra◦.</p>
<p>30 The reading gobalisrajabhaktādy◦ was first proposed by Majumdar and was taken over by Neuss. After this follows scroll-work to fill up the line.</p>
<p>31 Banerji proposed to read here (see also beginning of next line): dattam etad evam, corrected by the editor of EI (Sten Konow), to dattāny etad evam, which was taken over by Majumdar and Neuss. I see no reason to conjecture etad. If there is room for one more syllable I would conjecture: dattānītyevam.</p>

<p>34 saha narake first conjectured by Banerji and taken over by all later editors. 35 The akṣara preceding dhā (just after the gap) was read as va by Banerji and Srinivasan (reading ava◦), and vā by Majumdar, who conjectures yathāvadhāraṇayā, taken over by Neuss. None of the editors has been able to restore this sentence.</p>

<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>General Gomibhaṭa made altogether three donations, for which he had to make two formal requests, namely one to the head (kulapati) of the Vinīte- śvara(maṭha), and the other to the Temple Council (devanikāya), of which he himself may have been a member. 37 The task of the Devanikāya may have been to supervise and administer the temple properties on the hill and that of the Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin temple complex (devakula) in particular. The mem bership of general Gomibhaṭa of such a council would not be surprising, if we consider the people who are reported to sit on such a council. To this effect the Taleśvara Copperplate Grant of Dyutivarman provides information. 38 The latter grant was made at the request of the Mahāsattrapati Trāta and the Deva nikāya, ‘which was headed by the minister Bhadraviṣṇu, the governor of the fort, the officer in charge of the king’s betel-box, the custodian of the sacrificial fire, and the head of the royal guard’. 39</p>
<p>Gomibhaṭa needed the permission of kulapati Bhānūdayin for his first dona tion, viz. accomodation or housing (maṭha) for the ascetics, since that was to be built on the premises of the Vinīteśvaramaṭha. The word kulapati poses a problem. Literally it signifies ‘head of a community’. Because the community here is defined as that of a maṭha, a likely interpretation is that the kulapati is</p>
<p>37 If we read with Neuss svadevanikāya in l. 4, this membership would be explicit. 38 EI XIII No. 7, 109–21: Two Talesvara Copperplates by Y.R̥Gupte (1915–16). These two copperplates have been found in Taleśvara in the Almore District, United Provinces (modern Uttarakhand). Though they appear to be forgeries, they are nevertheless doc uments pertaining to the period ‘between the middle of the 6th and second quarter of the 7th century’ (Gupte op. cit. 113), i.e. to the same period as to which the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription belongs.</p>
<p>39 EI XIII, 115 ll. 6–8: rājadauvārikāgnisvāmikāraṅkikakoṭādhikaraṇikāmātyabhadraviṣṇu puraḥsareṇa ca devanikāyena vijñāpitam. , which is rendered by Gupte as ‘preceded by royal doorkeepers, the attendants of the sacred fire, the kāraṅkikas, the superintendent of the female (temple) slaves, the minister Bhadraviṣṇu’.</p>
<p>the Mahant or abbot of the community of ascetics (tāpovanikas) of the Vinī teśvaramaṭha. 40 Alternatively, as was pointed out to me in the conference, kulapati may be shorthand for devakulapati, ‘head of the temple’, in which case probably the temple connected to the maṭha was meant.</p>
<p>He needed the approval of the Temple Council for his second donation, viz. a daily offering of lampoil and rice meant for the Nārāyaṇa Temple (devakula), since this was to be taken from the storeroom (koṣṭhikā) connected to the Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin Temple. How this was paid for remains unclear, unless we assume that the third donation to the Temple Council was considered to be sufficient to cover the costs of this as well.</p>
<p>His third donation to the Temple Council, for which he also needed approval, was meant for the worship of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin himself and is said to have had a value of 50 dīnāras. For this amount he provided the means needed for worshipping the deity, such as milk (a cow), food and garlands, epitomized in the words vicitrakarmāntatantra◦ (regular set of various observances), if our conjecture (l. 10) is correct.</p>
<p>The inscription attests to the existence, in the second half of the 6th cen tury, of a main Saiva temple complex, called Man ´ . ḍaleśvara. Connected to this temple was a storeroom, which could also supply the daily offerings for a minor Vaiṣṇava sanctuary dedicated to Nārāyaṇa. In addition, and possibly closely connected to the Maṇḍaleśvara complex, was a monastery of Saiva ascetics, ´ named Vinīteśvaramaṭha. Whether there was a temple or shrine of Vinīte- śvara cannot be deduced from this inscription with certainty, but the existence at the time of such a temple is very likely indeed. The monastery or/and its temple was headed by Bhānūdayin.</p>
<p>Maṇḍaleśvara and the Skandapuraṉ .a</p>
<p>This is as far as epigraphy (and archaeology) can bring us. It does not tell us why ascetics and pilgrims flocked to this hill in great numbers. Why the site was considered holy. In order to answer these questions we need texts, and such a text has become available. I refer to the original Skandapurāṇa.</p>
<p>In the context of the Kauśikī Cycle the Skandapurāṇa contains a Maṇḍa leśvara Māhātmya.41 This Māhātmya tells the story of the demons Sunda and Nisunda and the nymph Tilottamā, also known from the Mahābhārata,42 which serves as an aetiological myth of the origin of the caturmukhaliṅga.</p>
<p>40 Cf. Vallabhadeva ad Raghuvaṁśa 1.94, who glosses kulapatinā as āśramaguruṇā. Par allels for this usage are also found in Khmer inscriptions (Cœdes 1937–66) K 95, K 309, K 362.</p>
<p>41 The credit for the discovery of the relevance of this text for the Muṇḍeśvarī Hill goes to Yuko Yokochi (Yokochi 2005, 88 n. 28).</p>
<p>42 MBh 1.200.18–204.26; Mbh 13.128.1–6. See Bakker 2001; below, pp. 489 ff.</p>
<p>20 / The Temple of Maṇḍaleśvarasvāmin 401</p>
<p>Tilottamā, her creator Brahmā, and the other gods assemble in the Vindhyas for worshipping Siva, but he is invisible at first. Then ´ Siva appears on the scene ´ in the form of a liṅga. When Tilottamā makes her pradakṣiṇā around him (and the gods), four faces emerge on the four sides of the liṅga, which gives her the power of sexual desire, the tejas, namely, that had been stored within Siva ever ´ since he had burnt Madana. Thus the caturmukhaliṅga comes into being (SP 62.8–26). Then Siva says that, ´</p>
<p>Because she [Tilottamā], as well as the gods, has circumambulated Him in a circle (maṇḍala), this place on Mt. Vindhya, which is sacred to Him, will be called Ma ṇḍaleśvara, and He will always be present here. 43</p>
<p>The story continues, again in the words of Yokochi.</p>
<p>After sending Tilottamā to the demons, all the gods huddle together. They see Parameśvara in their midst. Because He appeared in the midst of the gods while they were huddling together (piṇḍyamāna), He was called Piṇḍāreśvara there. 44</p>
<p>A holy place called Piṇḍāraka is known to the Mahābhārata (MBh 13.26.54), and other places with this name are known to several Purāṇas. The Piṇḍāreśvara at issue, however, must be located in the vicinity of Maṇḍaleśvara. The word piṇḍāra means mendicant and the aetiological myth told in the Skandapurāṇa probably refers to a local liṅga that was worshipped by Saiva ´ ascetics.</p>
<p>The place where our text locates these two liṅgas is in the northern part of the Vindhyas, since Tilottamā is said to go to the south to find the two demons in the foothills of the Vindhya (vindhyapādeṣu). Our investigation thus seems to corroborate Yokochi’s hypothesis, to the effect that both Skandapurāṇa liṅgas are to be situated on the Muṇḍeśvarī Hill— the Maṇḍaleśvara being the ancient caturmukhaliṅga preserved on the site near the main, octagonal temple and named as such in the Muṇḍeśvarī Inscription, Year 30, and the Piṇḍāreśvara being one of the many of 5th to 7th century liṅgas that are scattered all over the hill, possibly the 5th or 6th century ekamukhaliṅga found at site A. 45</p>

<p>Old caturmukhaliṅga 46 Ekamukhaliṅga of site A 47</p>
<p>Once the hill had established its reputation, it began to attract patronage of the elite. Gomibhaṭa exemplifies this development and we have suggested elsewhere that the Vinīteśvara temple may have been founded by someone named Vinīta, who may have ruled from the stronghold of near-by Rohitāgiri, Rohtasgarh. 48 The inscription and earliest archaeological material on the hill belong to the period in which we date the beginning of the Skandapurāṇa composition, that is after ad 550, when North India became united again, for the first time since the fall of the Gupta Empire, under the Maukhari rulers, whose homeland was in the near-by valley of the River SoṇIt is the period in which the Saiva movement was beginning to organize itself through sectarian settlements ´</p>
<p>46 This liṅga is found in the temple compound, near the entrance. Neuss 2003, 546 n. 37: ‘This caturmukhaliṅga seems to be the model for the one which is at present in the temple and which most likely is a substitute for the former.’ Photo by the author (2011).</p>
<p>47 This liṅga is presently stored within the temple. For its history see Neuss 2003, 546 f. It came from ‘site A’. Photo courtesy of F. Buckee (2008).</p>
<p>48 In inscriptions of the Tu˙nga dynasty, ruling in the tenth century as feudatories of the Bauma-Kara kings of Orissa in the Yamagarta-maṇḍala in the Dhenkanal District of Central Orissa, this dynasty of petty kings claims that its ancestor, named Vinīta, came originally from the Rohitāgiri.
