The So-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman’∗ 

Preamble 

Few scholars can claim mastery of such a wide range of different fields within the discipline of Indology as Prof Dr Oskar von Hinüber. One of the branches of learning that owes a great deal to his studies is Indian epigraphy. My con tribution here is meant as a humble tribute to Oskar and his work. 

Introduction 

We possess two inscriptions that undisputably belong to that branch of the Maukhari family which eventually turned the ancient Kānyakubja (Kanauj) into their new capital, viz. the well-known Haraha Stone Inscription of Īśānavarman of Vikrama Samvat 611 (ad 554), in which Īśānavarman’s son Sūryavarman records his renovation of a dilapidated Siva temple, and an ´ inscription found in Jaunpur. 1 The Jaunpur Inscription is merely ‘a fragment of a very much larger inscription’. 2 It deserves a detailed examination. 

It is estimated that only about one-third of the width of the inscribed stone has been preserved (Plate 77), and it is unknown how many lines would have been below the last line extant. Fleet remarks that ‘the probability is [. . . ] that the larger number (seventy-two) has been lost at the beginning of this (i.e. first) line, and in proportion all the way down’. 3 The other option considered by Fleet is that only thirty-eight syllables are missing at the beginning of each line. This option is invalidated by the Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita verse in line 3, of which the end coincides with the right side of the stone. From this and the preceding incomplete Mālinī verse of line 2 it can be deduced that altogether 69 syllables have been lost in line 3. This would bring the total number of akṣaras in line 3 

∗ The first version of this article was published in Indo-Iranian Journal 52.2–3 (2009), 207–16. The article in this double issue of IIJ was dedicated to Oskar von Hinüber. 1 For the Haraha Inscription of the Reign of Īśānavarman, Year [VS] 611 see: Sāstri 1917– ´ 

18; Sircar SI I, 385–389; Thaplyal 1985, 141–146. For the Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman see: J.F. Fleet in CII III (1888), 228–230; Thaplyal 1985, 139–40. 2 CII III (1888), 228.

to 91. 4 Since the whole inscription consists of verses, it should be possible to estimate how many akṣaras have been lost in each line, notwithstanding Fleet’s admittance that he has ‘tried several ways of arranging the verses, [. . . ], but without being able to satisfy myself’. 5 It appears that the number of akṣaras per line varied between 91 and 99. 

The inscription was published again in Thaplyal 1985, but he too refrained from a restoration of the distribution of verses. Earlier Sircar had reconstructed three verses along the lines we propose to follow here for the inscription as a whole. 6

4 That a line could contain slightly more syllables than 91 emerges from ‘scroll-work to fill up the line’ that follows the punctuation mark that concludes the Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita verse (CII III (1888), 229 n. 7).

19 / The So-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman’ 383 

The inscription had been ascribed to Īśvaravarman, on account of the fact that he is the only king mentioned by name in the fragment. When we collate our reconstruction with the Haraha Inscription, it appears that a similar pattern underlies both praśastis and that it is highly unlikely that Īśvaravarman was the last king mentioned, a conclusion also reached by Sircar 1964, though on other grounds. 7 Both praśastis, however, are independent compositions and it is impossible to say which one of them is the older, although the Haraha Inscription seems to be slightly more ornate, having e.g. two maṅgala verses (the second one apparently drawing inspiration from the Kṣemeśvara Temple, the object of the inscription) against one in the Jaunpur InscriptioṇIn the underlying pattern two verses are reserved for Harivarman and Adityavarman ¯ in both inscriptions; Īśvaravarman has three verses in the Haraha Inscription and three or two in the Jaunpur one, depending on whether one assigns verse 8 to him or to his son ĪśānavarmaṇThe latter possibility is the most likely, in view of the explicit mention of the ‘lion throne’, which we also encounter in the Haraha Inscription verse 13. In the Haraha Inscription Īśānavarman has five verses dedicated solely to him, whereas in the sixth his son Sūryavarman is introduced. The pattern we conjecture in the Jaunpur Inscription gives to Īśānavarman at least five verses, while it remains unclear whether a son is introduced in verses 12 or 13. The Jaunpur inscription may therefore have belonged to either Īśānavarman or to one of his successors. 

An edition of the thus reconstructed text of the inscription is presented be low, which is followed by my translatioṇIn the footnotes to this translation the parallel verses of the Haraha Inscription are given together with my translation thereof. 

The Jaunpur Stone Inscription 

The reconstruction follows basically the text of Fleet with some minor adap tations, using, for instance, standard orthography. The bold figures between square brackets are the line numbers. Angular brackets (in edition and trans lation) are used to indicate that the reading is conjectured. Commas indicate the end of uneven pādas. The verse numbering is mine. 

7 Sircar 1964, 129 draws this conclusion from verse 11, in which the king’s victory over the Andhras is celebrated. This victory was obtained by Īśānavarman, as Haraha Inscription verse 13 tells us (see below, n. 26 on p. 388).

He who is the cause of the acting deities that effect the manifestation, destruction and preservation of the world; the one on whom yogis, for whom the mass of darkness (i.e. tamas) has been destroyed and who have overcome their passions (rajas), meditate; the one in whose heart passion has no place, although a woman occupies half (his body); he, the soul of (all) living beings, the destroyer of the Triple City, the fountainhead of bliss on earth, is victorious. (1) 

May that figure of Andhaka’s Foe, on whose body snakes glimmer, offer you a stable abode—a figure who wears a lion skin that is slightly crimsoned by the light of the jewel in the hood of the serpent that is his sacred thread, and who reddens the white line of skulls that is the chaplet by the radiance from his third eye, and who bears on his crest the slender, darkness dispelling digit of the moon. (2) 

The verse describing the mythic descent of the Maukharis is found in the Haraha In scription verse 3: 

sutaśataṁlebhe nr̥po ’śvapatir vaivasvatād yad guṇoditam | 

tatprasūtā duritavr̥ttirudho mukharāḥkṣitīśāḥkṣatārayaḥk 3 k 

The Mukhara kings, who destroyed their enemies and stopped evil doing, descended from that eminent century of sons which king Aśvapati obtained from Vaivasvata. (3)

22 For the verses 2 and 3 compare the Haraha Inscription verse 4: 

teṣv ādau harivarmaṇo ’vanibhujo bhūtir bhuvo bhūtaye, 

ruddhāśeṣadigantarālayaśasā rugṇārisampattviṣā | 

saṁgrāme hutabhukprabhākapiśitaṁvaktraṁsamīkṣyāribhir,

Among them (there arose) at the beginning, for the well-being of the world, a ruler of the earth, the (powerful) being (called) Harivarman, (a powerful being) measured by his fame, by which all quarters of space were besieged, and his brilliance, which destroyed the happiness of his foes; for whom the enemies bowed in fear, when they saw his face at the battlefield, as this was aglow with the lustre of (sacrificial) fire, and who for that reason obtained the name Jvālāmukha (Flame-face) on earth. (4) 

23 Cf. Kirātārjunīya 13.14: cāpanāma prathamaṁpauruṣacihnam. 

24 Cf. the Haraha Inscription verse 7: 

hutabhuji makham adhyāsaṅgini dhvāntalīlam. , 

viyati pavanajanmabhrāntivikṣepabhūyaḥ| 

mukharayati samantād utpatad dhūmajālam. ,

When his (Adityavarman’s) fire was kindled for sacrifice, the thick smoke, black as the ¯ night, rising up to the sky on all sides and swelling through its whirling and tossing in the wind, continuously made the peackocks cry (mukharayati), since they mistook it for a large rain-cloud. (7) 

25 Cf. the Haraha Inscription verse 8:

By him (i.e. Adityavarman) was begotten, destined to gain the power of nobility, the ¯ lord of the earth Īśvaravarman, whose soul was well-disciplined and who invoked the Enemy of Vr̥tra (i.e. Indra) in many sacrifices; other kings, no matter how they tried, were unable to match his way of conduct, he whose deeds eradicated the very nature of the Kali (Age) and who equalled Yayāti in fame.

Conclusion 

From the collation of the Jaunpur fragment and the Haraha Inscription it be comes clear that both Maukhari inscriptions follow a similar traditioṇThis tra dition assigned to Harivarman great military prowess, to Adityavarman piety, ¯ 

26 For the verses 8 to 11 compare the Haraha Inscription verse 13: 

jitvāndhrādhipatiṁsahasragaṇitatredhākṣaradvāraṇam. , 

vyāvalganniyutātisaṁkhyaturagān bhaṅktvā raṇe sūlikān | 

kr̥tvā cāyatim(o)citasthalabhuvo gauḍān samudrāśrayān, 

adhyāsiṣṭa natakṣitīśacaraṇaḥsiṁhāsanaṁyo jitī k 13 k 

[Īśanavarman] ¯ is victorious, he who has ascended the lion throne, his feet bowed to by the rulers of the earth, after having vanquished the sovereign of Andhra of whom the elephants, counted by the thousands, were passing triple fluid (scil., temple-must secretion, urine and faeces, due to excitement), after having routed in battle the Sū likas and their galloping arrays of innumerable horses, and after having made the Gauḍas, driven from their territory by (his) might, take refuge at the ocean. (13) 

27 Sircar 1964, 130 is right when he notes that, ‘The word dhārā commonly means khaḍgāder niśitamukham (Medinīkoṣa), so that the passage dhārāmārgavinirgatāgnikaṇikā means “the sparks issuing from the passage of the [hero’s] sword” and has nothing to do with the city of Dhārā.’ However, the use of the word mārga in this interpretation remains problematic. For dhārā in the sense of ‘rim of an (iron) wheel’ see Raghuvaṁśa 13.15. 

28 Sircar 1964, 128 conjectures that it was an unknown enemy, other than the Lord of Andhra, who fled to the Raivataka hill. The hill has not satisfactorily been identified. To go by its name it may have been a hill along the Revā (= Narmadā) River. A hill of this name is mentioned in the Junāgaḍh Rock Inscription of Skandagupta. Fleet identifies this Raivataka with the hill ‘opposite to Urjayat or Girnˆar’ in Kathiawar, ˆ Gujarat ( CII III (1888), 64 n. 1). 

29 This seems to refer to an expedition to the northwest, possibly corresponding with the Sūlikas mentioned in the Haraha Inscription (see above, n. 26 on p. 388). 







19 / The So-called ‘Jaunpur Stone Inscription of Īśvaravarman’ 389 

to Īśvaravarman virtuousness, and to Īśānavarman emperorship. The latter was credited with the title Mahārājādhirāja in the seals of his successors and in the inscriptions he is said to be seated on the lion throne. His son Sūryavarman was a young man in Vikrama Saṁvat 611 (=ad 554), the date of the Haraha Inscription. Īśānavarman’s exploits may therefore have taken place in the se cond quarter of the 6th century. Whether or not the heroic deeds of one of Īśānavarman’s descendants were described in the missing part of the inscrip tion will forever remain unknown. 

By placing the two Maukhari inscriptions side by side, we have won a more secure basis from which the individual achievements of each of the Maukhari kings and the Maukhari history as such can be studies. The results of this study are found in Bakker 2014, The World of the Skandapurāṇa. The sixth century is generally considered as a ‘dark age’ and for that reason every piece of evidence should be treasured. It is hoped that the present preliminary study of the source material will contribute to the historiography of the Maukharis in general and may be of use to scholars who, like the present author, are fascinated by an age that started with the fall of a great empire and culminated in the magnificent rule of Harṣavardhana.
