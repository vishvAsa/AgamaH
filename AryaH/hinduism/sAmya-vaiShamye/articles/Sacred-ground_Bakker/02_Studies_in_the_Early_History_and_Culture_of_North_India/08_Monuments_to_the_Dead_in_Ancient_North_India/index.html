  <p>Preamble</p>
<p>The scope of this study is limited to funerary practices within the brahmini cal (Hindu) fold of the ancient period, i.e. North India from the Vedic Age to the reign of King Harṣavardhana (7th century). Funerary practices in South India, Dravida country, and Southeast Asia seem to have differed significantly from those in North India. 1 They deserve a study of their owṇIn late me dieval North India new forms of commemoration (samādhis, chatarīs) emerged, possibly under Islamic influence. 2</p>
<p>The funerary monument in Sanskrit literature</p>
<p>We possess a moving literary description of what the death of a king—great in the eyes of his contemporaries—brought about, how it was experienced by the court, and which ritual and ceremonies were performed to cope with the calamity. Bāṇa in Harṣacarita 5 tells us that, even before the actual demise of Harṣa’s father, Prabhākaravardhana, the latter’s first wife, Queen Yaśovatī, was so overwhelmed by grief and the prospect of widowhood that she, against the express wish of her son, committed herself to the flames (i.e. became a satī), while her husband was still alive.</p>
<p>After the death of his mother Harṣa goes to his dying father and clasps his feet in dispair. The latter comforts him, recommends him to his royal duties, and utters his last words: ‘enemies should be exterminated’. 3 The body is brought to the bank of the Sarasvatī on a bier, a funeral pyre is built and the cremation ritual is performed at dusk. It is suggested that the remaining ladies of the king’s harem also commit satī. Harṣa keeps a vigil and next morning goes to the Sarasvatī to bathe, offers an oblation of water to his father, and goes home in distress (p. 293). A brahmin eats the first piṇḍas offered to the ghost (preta) and the period of impurity passes.</p>
<p>The deceased king’s paraphernalia are given to the brahmins; the collected bones are brought to holy places. Then it is said that a ‘stab of pain’ is set up</p>
<p>∗ The first version of this article was published in Indo-Iranian Journal 50.1 (2007), 11–47. 1 See below, n. 23 on p. 410, n. 27 on p. 411, and n. 84 on p. 431.</p>

<p>in the form of a monument at (the place of) the funeral pyre made of a mass of bricks. 4 Finally the royal elephant is set loose and gradually the lamentations subside. The metaphor used by Bāṇa, ‘a stab of pain’ (śokaśalya)—the primary meaning of śalya being ‘dart’—suggests that the monument had the form of a needle. 5 Such a monument seems to be known from the Sanskrit literature, viz. the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa’s chapter on the so-called aiḍūka.</p>
<p>The aiḍūka of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa</p>
<p>Viṣṇudharmottara 3.84.1–15 describes the aiḍūkarūpa as follows. 6 A structure is built of three (receding) square platforms (bhadrapīṭha), with steps on four sides. On the third platform a liṅgarūpa is erected, but one not decorated with lines (rekhā, i.e. without the brahmasūtra and the pārśvasūtra). In the middle of this liṅgarūpa an immovable square column (yaṣṭi) is fixed. On that thirteen bhūmikās are made. 7 On top of this is an āmalasāraka (=āmalaka?) and on that again a round column, yaṣṭi, is fixed. This col umn is decorated with a medallion (candraka). 8 In between the bhūmikās and the liṅga (i.e. on the square column?) the four Lokapālas are situated, Virūḍha, Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, Virūpākṣa, and Kubera, with lances (śūla) in their hands, wear ing armour and ornaments. 9 It is said that in this construction Virūḍha is Sakra, Dhr ´ .tarāṣṭra is Yama, Virūpākṣa is Varuṇa, and Kubera is Rājarāja. This aiḍūka is named ‘Prajāhita’; men who worship it obtain happiness and heaven after death.</p>
<p>Shah in her commentary emphasizes that this Aiḍūka structure is not a particular deity but is designed to embody the whole universe. As to the names of the Lokapālas she remarks: ‘These are known to Buddhist mythology as the four Buddhist Yakṣas who do the work of the Lokapālas.’ 10 Shah assumes that</p>
<p>4 Harṣacarita (HC* 6 p. 300): kalpitaśokaśalye sudhānicayacite citācaityacihne, which Sam ´ . kara glosses: citāyāṁcaityacihnas tadākāraṁcihnam, śmaśānadevagr̥haṁvā | 5 Cf. Aṅguttara-Nikāya III, 62, Sokasallaharaṇa, name of the discourse (dhammapariyāya) that takes away the grieve of bereavement, taught to king Muṇḍa.</p>
<p>6 For the Sanskrit text of VDhP 3.84.1–15 see Appendix.</p>
<p>7 It is unclear whereon exactly, the liṅgarūpa or the yaṣṭi; liṅgarūpa is neuter, yaṣṭi feminine. tasyopariṣṭāt (84.5c) refers to the liṅgarūpa, unless we assume double sandhi. A similar sloppy construction is seen in 6a. Shah cites Kramrish, who interprets the bhūmikās as ‘steps’.</p>
<p>8 I read samārdhacandra◦ instead of samārkacandra◦, meaning that the medallion is situ ated in the middle of the horizontal (sama) crescent mooṇThe thirteen bhūmikās and the āmalasāraka are said to represent the 14 bhuvanas. The liṅga represents Maheśvara, the round column Pitāmaha and the square column Janārdana. The three platforms represent the three guṇas.</p>
<p>9 In accordance with the oldest MS C, I take ‘the apparel of the sun (Sūrya)’ in 12b singular, corresponding with Kubera.</p>
<p>10 See Barhut Inscriptions (CII II, pṭii), p.73:</p>
<p>As Kupira (Kubera) and Viruḍaka (Virūḍhaka) are the guardians of the Northern and Southern region respectively we can assume with certainty that on the lost corner pillars of both the quadrants Virūpakkha and Dhataraṭṭha, the guardians of the West and East, were represented, each one with two companions.

<p>the aiḍūka of the VDhP is without ashes or bones and is therefore acceptable to be worshipped, whereas originally such monuments would have contained bones or relics. This plausible assumption as well as the naming of the four Buddhist Lokapālas strongly suggest that Buddhist examples lie at the root of the Purāṇa’s description of the aiḍūka.11 We may add that the use of the word aiḍūka, instead of eḍūka, could also point to this, meaning ‘derived from/related to/of the nature of the eḍūka’, not the original (Buddhist) ‘ossuary’. The view that sees in the aiḍūka an appropriation by the author of the VDhP of a Buddhist architectural tradition finds support in the outcome of Gustav Roth’s investigation into the Symbolism of the Buddhist Stūpa.12</p>
<p>The eḍūka</p>
<p>We have some more literary evidence regarding the eḍūka. The Mahāvastu refers to an anticipated funerary monument of Princess Sudarśanā, who tells her mother:</p>
<p>Mother, when the seven Kṣatriyas, after fighting one another, shall have caused my death, then, after having performed the cremation rite and collected the bones, you should next erect for me a monument (elūkā). And at the entrance of that monument you should plant a karṇikāra tree. Thereupon, when the first month of the rainy season has come after the hot season, that karṇikāra tree will be wrapped in a golden colour as it is covered abundantly by blossoms. Then you shall remember me, thinking to yourself: ‘I had a daughter whose complexion was beautiful (sudarśanā) like this’. 13</p>
<p>Lore, p. 212, is of the opinion that the names of the four world-guardians do not occur in the older Pāli texts, but they are given in the Mahāsamayasutta (D II, 257–258) and in the At ¯.ānāṭiyasutta (D III, 197 ff.) in accordance with their fixed distribution in the four directions.</p>
<p>In the Aiḍūka construction it seems that Virūḍha represents the East (= Sakra) and ´ Dhr̥tarāṣṭra the South (= Yama). This would make a pradakṣiṇā: Virūḍha East, Dhr̥tarāṣṭra South, Virūpākṣa West, Kubera North. This is a deviation from the stand ard Buddhist doctrine; cf. Banerjea 1956, 521 f.:</p>
<p>In Buddhist mythology too we find a group of four divine beings associated with the four principal quarters, and the Sanskrit Buddhist texts give us a stereotyped list of four; they are Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, the Gandharva king (east), Virūḍhaka, the king of the Kumbhāṇḍas (south), Virūpākṣa, the Nāga monarch (west) and Vaiśravaṇa, the Yakṣa king (north). They are the Catur-mahārājas of some Buddhist texts, and Pāṇini seems to have had them in his mind when he referred to their bhaktas in one of his sūtras (P 4.3.99): mahārājāṭṭhañ.</p>
<p>11 If we compare this description with that of the Divyāvadāna (see below, n. 77 on p. 428) we observe another correspondence: the stairs at the four sides. The three bhadrapīṭhas may reflect the three medhīs or platforms (see Roth 1980, 200 f.).</p>
<p>12 Roth 1980. In a Postscriptum Roth draws a comparison between the description in the VDhP and some Buddhist texts and refers, for instance, to a bronze stūpa (ca. 10th century) kept in the Patna Museum (Plate XIV/3; cf. op. cit. 208). Roth concludes that the VDhP ‘follows an older Buddhist tradition which is found in the above quoted chapters of Caityavibhāgavinayodbhāvasūtra, Stūpalakṣaṇakārikāvivecana, and Kriyā saṁgraha’ (op. cit. 200). 13 Mahāvastu II, p. 486 l 5:</p>
<p>Evidently the word used here for the monument, elūkā, refers to a funerary monument of laymeṇEmeneau, discussing the word in a review of Mayrhofer’s kewa,14 and referring to Edgerton’s bhsd ṣv. eluka, remarks:</p>
<p>The word in Buddhist texts seems clearly to be eluka or elūka and to mean ‘mon ument containing the ashes or bones of a dead person’. [. . . ] Considering the clear meaning in the Buddhist texts (bones are specifically mentioned in one pas sage) and the l of the word there, one must at least consider again Kittel’s old suggestion. . . of connection with the Dr[avidian] words for ‘bone’. . . .</p>
<p>Shah quotes Helmer Smith who derives it from the Canarese root el.- ‘to stand up, to rise’. 15 This meaning of the word eḍūka is confirmed by the Amarakośa, in which it occurs in connection with ‘wall’: ‘An eḍūka is (a wall) wherein bones are placed, i.e. an ossuary.’ 16</p>
<p>From the evidence surveyed above it seems to appear that the erection of funer ary monuments was not strictly limited to the heterodox traditions. However, being from its inception connected with the remains of the dead, the eḍūka</p>

<p>Kane IV, 255 n. 580 draws our attention to a passage in the Brahmanical literature where a tree and eḍūka are mentioned. It concerns a passage found in Aparārka’s commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti (vol. II, pp. 885 f.) ascribed to the Brahmapurāṇa:</p>
<p>It is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and water, that a puṣkaraka tree should be planted there or an eḍūka (a structure) should be built over it.</p>

<p>14 Emeneau 1988 (Selected Papers), 184 f. See also Allchin 1957.</p>
<p>15 Shah VDhP p. 173. She further speculates about the etymology and concludes: ‘If this is correct, it would lead us to the conclusion that the Deśya word eḍūka, which later on became sanskritised and accepted in sanskrit lexicons, originally must have meant a</p>
<p>structure containing bone relics.’ (p. 172). Allchin 1957, 3 refers to Tamil √iṭu, meaning ‘bury’ since very early times and iṭu-kāṭu, ‘burial ground’. The same author refers to the ubiquitous stone cists found in Dravida country: ‘The stone cists have been found to contain almost every possible combination of relics including the collected bones of many persons.’. . . ‘The cist was sometimes built on the bare rock, or sometimes partly or entirely buried in a pit. Over and around it was placed a cairn of small stones, granite chips, etc. and around the cairn was frequently placed one or more circles of large boulders.’ (op. cit. 3); cf. Falk 2000, 73.</p>

<p>was, for obvious reasons, not much in vogue in orthodox circles, as the follow ing passage demonstrates. Mahābhārata 3.188 pretends to describe the period of total disruption at the end of the Kali Age, but, as is often the case with such passages, its hidden agenda seems to be to attack contemporaneous prac tices. 17</p>
<p>And this perverted world shall be upside down: at the dissolution of the yuga (people) will venerate charnel-houses (eḍūkas) and abandon the gods, (whereas) śūdras will not serve the brahmins. When the yuga expires, the earth shall no longer be decorated by temples, but marked by charnel-houses (eḍūkas): in the hermitages of the great seers, in the settlements of brahmins, in the dwellings of the gods, in hallowed places (caitya), and in the abodes of the Nāgas. That is the sign that the yuga has come to an end. When men, fierce and devoid of dharma, will be constantly eating meat and drinking liquor, then the yuga will collapse. 18</p>
<p>Although not popular with the orthodox, the custom of erecting a monument for the dead goes back to megalithic times and was partly sanctioned by Vedic literature. 19 Kane, dealing with funerary rites, observes (IV, 255): ‘It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages, viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites (called Sāntikarma) and erection of a monument ´ over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case.’ Caland in his Die altindischen Todten- und Bestattungsgebräuche describes this optional procedure. On the ground where the cremation had taken place (śmaśāna) a plot of land of the size of a man is demarcated, square or, according to others, round. The land is ritually ploughed.</p>

<p>Despite the attention paid to these barrows (citi) in the Kalpaśāstra, we, pace Giuseppe de Marco, find little hard evidence that this Vedic tradition was continued in historic times in classical North India. Disposal of the remains in holy water (tīrtha)—be it the ashes/bones, or the body as a whole (as in the case of ascetics)—seems to have replaced the older practices of inhumation and exposure. 21 This tallies with the virtual absence in the Mahābhārata of any reference to the erection of monuments to the dead, apart from the quoted passage regarding the alleged worship of eḍūkas.22</p>
<p>The Sanskrit literature knows, however, yet another type of monument to commemorate the deceased; it is said to appertain in particular to the kṣatriya class. 23 The Pratimānāṭaka, traditionally ascribed to Bhāsa, describes how Bharata on his return to Ayodhyā pauses at a building, outside the city, tucked away amidst the trees, on the walls of which sandal imprints of hands are found, of which the doors are decorated with floral wreaths, and where he finds offerings (bali), evident from flowers and parched rice grains that are well arranged, and a floor strewn with sand. 24 Little wonder that, when he also fails to see a dhvaja or other emblem of a god (cihna), Bharata is puzzled: could this be a ‘house of the gods’ (devakula)? Inside there are images, well made and true to life, which makes one believe that they are human beings. And this they</p>
<p>20 Caland 1896; cf. Falk 2000, 75 ff. Saindon 2000.</p>
<p>21 Cf. de Marco 1987, 219 ff.</p>
<p>22 In an interesting study, Disposal of the Dead in the Mahābhārata, Tiwari 1979, 23 f. observes the following:</p>
<p>It has already been remarked that the Mahābhārata seems to contain no clear refer ence to the rite of asthi-sañcayana, which formed an essential element of antyeṣṭi as described in several ritual texts. This rite involved the collection of charred bones and ashes some days after the cremation and disposal of them in various ways—hanging in a bundle on the branch of a tree, or recremating in some special cases, or depositing at the foot of a tree, or, more generally, burying them in a hole dug in the ground and sometimes also building some kind of memorial mound (śmaśāna) over them. Apparently this practice gradually went out of vogue, and, already towards the close of the epic, the custom of depositing the bones in holy river had probably become more common.</p>
<p>23 The South-Indian Dīptāgama Paṭala 52, Kṣatriyasthāpana, gives a description of the installation of images of the king, his queen and the ministers (Dīptāgama II, 347–56). For the South-Indian tradition of royal portraiture see also Lef`evre 2006, Part 3 Ch. 8. See also below, n. 27 on p. 411.</p>
<p>24 sādhumuktapuṣpalājāviṣkr̥tā balayaḥ, dattacandanapañcāṅgulā bhittayaḥ, avasaktamā lyadāmaśobhīni dvārāṇi, prakīrṇā bālukāḥ| (Pratimānāṭaka 3.5).</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 411</p>
<p>prove to be. Bharata has come upon a statue gallery, pratimāgr̥ha, in which images of the deceased kings of the Ikṣvāku race are set up; his uncertainty seems to indicate that it is an uncommon phenomenon. 25 The keeper tells him that a brahmin should not salute or worship them as they do not represent gods (daivata), but kings (kṣatriya) who have passed away. When Bharata discovers an image of Daśaratha among them, he understands that his father has died. 26</p>
<p>The problem with this testimony, however, is its date and place of origiṇThe issue has been discussed by many scholars, and Tieken 1993, summarizing much of this discussion, argues that the so-called ‘Trivandrum Plays’, to which the Pratimānāṭaka belongs, may be late and of South-Indian origin. 27</p>
<p>The archaeology of the funerary monument</p>
<p>If we turn to archaeology, it becomes immediately clear that, despite the lit erary evidence, material testifying to the actual practice of erecting funerary monuments in the Brahminical tradition in ancient India is rare. 28 A. Ghosh</p>
<p>25 Pratimānāṭaka 3.6.</p>
<p>26 Pratimānāṭaka 3.7–9.</p>
<p>27 On account of a formal statistical analysis, van der Geer 1998 dates this particular play to the 4th or 5th century ad (op. cit. 177) and also thinks a South Indian author most likely (op. cit. 187). The Pratimānāṭaka may reflect a South-Indian custom. That South-Indian funerary practices differed from the ‘Aryan’ North may also be deduced from the description of a cemetery in the early Tamil epic Maṇimekalai (Dani´elou 1989, 24 ff.). The practice to install commemorative images of Sivabhaktas is prescribed in the ´ relatively late South-Indian redaction of the Ajitāgama, not known to (12th-century) Aghoraśiva (Goodall 2004, cx), which text tells us that this sort of images may be installed at holy places or in a Siva temple where they should be worshipped. According ´ to Dīptāgama 52.59 images of bhaktas should follow the rules of the images of the king (above, n. 23 on p. 410). The Ajitāgama gives the following description 63.39–42:</p>
<p>śivālaye viśeṣeṇa śivabhaktān kr̥tāñjalīn k 39 k savālacāmarakarāṁl liṅgahastān sa lakṣaṇān | bimbarūpān vidhāyātha mahāmaṇṭapadeśataḥk 40 k maṇimaṇṭapadeśe vā prākārābhyantareṣu vā | tasmāt sarvaprayatnena pratiṣṭhāpya yathāvidhi k 41 k śivāgamavidhānena nityapūjāṁsamācaret | pratiṣṭhānāṁbhaktānām ālaye bimba rūpiṇāṁk 42 k nityaṁnaimittikaṁkāmyam utsavaṁca samācaret |</p>
<p>The editor of the Ajitāgama, ṇR̥Bhatt, quotes the Acintya- and refers to the Uttara kāmikāgama ad loc. The underlying idea seems to be that these bhaktas have reached sārūpya with Siva and can therefore be depicted with four arms, though they keep the ´ distinct (iconographic) characteristics of the devotee: two hands forming an añjali, as a true devotee should, two others holding liṅga and chowry.</p>
<p>Along with this South Indian custom one may consider funerary practices in Indianized Southeast Asia. Thus there is substantial evidence that in Cambodia as well as on Java and Bali temples and statues were erected for deceased kings and their families; see i.a. Cœd`es 1940, 320 ff. (I thank Arlo Griffiths for this reference).</p>
<p>28 Cf. Malamoud 1982, 442:</p>
<p>Or, la suppression physique du cadavre s’accompagne de proc´edures qui aboutissent <code>a l’abolition du souvenir de la personne du mort. Notons d’abord qu’apr</code>es la dispersion des restes du d´efunt nul tombeau, bien sˆur, mais aussi nul c´enotaphe n’est mis en place qui pourrait prolonger son existence terrestre en lui r´eservant un morceau d’espace.</p>
<p>observes the following: ‘As by the time cremation had virtually replaced inhu mation there is hardly any archaeological evidence of the practices concerning the disposal of the dead. [The Buddhist (and Jaina) stūpas form an entirely different category.]’ 29 From the following it will emerge that this sweeping statement should be qualified on two points: the Buddhist and Jain customs are not so categorically different from the Hindu ones (see p. 425), and there is more archaeological evidence of Hindu funerary practice than supposed by Ghosh (see below, p. 430).</p>
<p>In discussions regarding this apparent absence reference is often made to excavations at Lauriya–Nandangarh (W. Champaran District, Bihar), 30 which, since ṬBloch’s excavations in 1905, 31 are supposed to show ‘Vedic burial mounds’. Ghosh assesses the evidence unearthed by Bloch, refers to the re examination by ṇG. Majumdar, 32 whose excavation he himself continued after the demise of Majumdar, and concludes:</p>
<p>He (i.e. Majumdar) found that all of them were earthen burial memorials with burnt-brick revetment, two being faced with a brick lining in a double tier, so that there was no justification for regarding them as more earthen barrows. He also pointed out that the gold leaves found by Bloch [containing a female figure in frontal pose] had their exact replica in the stūpa at Piprawa, which is definitely a Buddhist stūpa of 300 bc or earlier. The respective Lauriya stūpas might be of a comparable date and there is nothing to connect them with Vedic burial rites. 33</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the question is justified whether cremation completely replaced inhumatioṇIt certainly did not for certain categories of persons such as chil dren, yogins or ascetics (yati), and pregnant women. 34 The evidence of eighteen Gandhāra reliefs containing depictions of cemeteries and burial monuments dis cussed by de Marco 1987 seems to indicate that burial was still customary long after the Vedic period at least in certain parts of India and for certain categories of persons. We shall come back to this below (p. 424 ff.).</p>
<p>In order to improve our understanding of the phenomenon of memorials to the dead it might be useful to distinguish between categories of monuments. 1 Temples dedicated to a particular god, erected in order to transfer the merit thereof to the deceased, often recorded in epigraphs. Many temples may actu ally fall into this category, for which there is, to the best of my knowledge, no</p>

As to the burial of pregnant women he concludes (op. cit. 222, n. 59): ‘Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the practice of burial for deceased pregnant women, even if not explicitly traceable in the texts, has always been considered, from an unspecifiable epoch, as both necessary and legitimate.’ Cf. Kane IV, 227–233.</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 413</p>
<p>specific Sanskrit word, but which in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription is referred to with the generic term prāsāda.35 A special relation between the god and the deceased indicates that this type of buildings has a commemora tive function, at least for contemporaries, and I therefore propose to refer to this type of monuments as ‘memorials’.</p>
<p>2 Sanctuaries/buildings that contain an image/images of the deceased. They are known in Sanskrit as pratimāgr̥ha, or ‘statue galleries’.</p>
<p>3 Hero-stones, including satī-stones, which are found in particular in the Dec can in great number, and which commemorate the place where a heroic death took place. They could be classified as ‘memorial stones’.</p>
<p>4 Structures that have some formal correspondences with the funerary mon uments of the following category (5), but which do not contain the actual mortuary remains; these seem to have been described in the Viṣṇudharmo ttarapurāṇa under the name of aiḍūka. 5 Burial mounds or sepulchral monuments that actually contain the ashes and/or bones, or the bodies of the deceased, in Sanskrit literature referred to as eḍūka.</p>
<p>Memorials</p>
<p>This category may be illustrated by two examples, the first one being the Vākāṭaka temples on the top of the Rāmagiri, the other a temple built by Skandagupta for his father Kumāragupta in Bhitarī. 36</p>
<p>As I have argued elsewhere (Bakker 1992b and 1997, 30 f.), the 5th-century Vākāṭaka temples on the Rāmagiri were erected to transfer merit to the dead. The choice of the temple-deity was not arbitrary; it was made on the basis of an envisaged similarity or affinity of the god and the deceased queen and kings (Bakker 1992b). This theory builds on the evidence of the inscription found in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on the Rāmagiri, in which Prabhāvatī’s daugh ter, Princess Atibhāvatī, widow of Ghaṭotkacagupta, records the good works she has done. The text is very fragmentary and problematic. A translation of the relevant passage may run as follows.</p>
<p>Then (the princess) commissioned the splendid ‘Master of Prabhāvatī’, (the image of the) Lord of the World, within the temple, for the sake of undecaying merit of</p>
<p>35 Above, p. 125; Bakker 1997, 167. Granoff 1992, 187 refers to a temple built after the cre mation of the Jain minister Vastupāla on Mt Satruñjaya called ‘Svargārohanaprāsāda’. ´ Granoff 1992 (passim) proves that the building of memorial temples was just as pop ular in Jainism as it was in Hinduism. This type of memorial temple seems to be referred to under the Cōḷas as paḷḷi-paṭai in Tamil: ‘temple erected in memory of kings’. Huntington 1985, 310 conjectures that the famous Dharmarāja shrine in Māmallapuram may have been such a paḷḷi-paṭai, since it contains a portrait image of the Pallava king Nr̥siṁhavarman I himself on its southern face.</p>
<p>36 The wide-spread practice to install liṅgas in commemoration of the deceased, which could be comprised in the category of ‘memorial’, is left out of account here. An example hereof is e.g. attested by the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61, above, p. 287, below, p. 494. For this practice in Nepal, centering around Paśupatinātha, see Mirnig 2016.</p>
<p>(her) mother. (21) . . . [text lost]</p>
<p>After she of extreme hlustrei (Atibhāvatī), had made in the village Kadalīvāṭaka a water reservoir Sudarśana (‘lovely to behold’) and (installed) the beautiful (su darśana) god, . . . for the sake of merit (24, 25) . . . [text lost]</p>
<p>Half of the merit (she) assigned to the gods, for (her) father and mother . . . ac cruing from the deed . . . (27)</p>

<p>Reflecting that that temple for her beloved . . . is transitory, she free of sins, for the sake of a mass of merit for her mother alone, . . . (30) [text lost]37</p>
<p>On account of this evidence we assume that either the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem ple, in which the inscription is found to date, or the adjacent Trivikrama Tem ple, to which the inscription originally may have belonged, 38 had been erected around the middle of the 5th century to transfer merit to the Vākāṭaka queen Prabhāvatī Guptā, who may have died a little earlier. This queen took great pride in her descent from two famous families, her father being the Gupta em peror Candragupta II, her mother Kuberanāgā born in the Nāga House and belonging to the Dhāraṇa gotra (Bakker 1997, 12). It may therefore not be coincidence that in front of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple entrance an image of a serpent, Nāga, is found. We will come back to this below, (p. 434).</p>
<p>A reference to another specimen of a memorial temple erected to transfer merit to a deceased king can be found in the Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta.39 The inscription of Prabhāvatī’s nephew, Skandagupta, is not without difficulties. The temple to which it may refer has been excavated, 40 but the image installed has not been found. Though somewhat elliptical, verse 12 may be read as follows.</p>
<p>Hence the manifestation of the Lord (Bhagavat), this (image/manifestation) here (i.e. Kumārasvāmin) and that which here has been consigned (to it) (i.e. the grāma), he (i.e. Skandagupta) has destined both for the merit of (his) father, since he is determined upon merit. 41</p>
<p>The inscription tells us that Skandagupta installed an image, probably of Vāsudeva and possibly named Kumārasvāmin, 42 a deity who is said in verse 10 to be a great archer, Sārṅgin, and as such reflects the qualities of the emperor ´</p>

<p>and his father. In verse 8, in which his victory over the Hūṇas is reported, the twanging sound of a bow (śārṅgadhvanih.) is referred to in a simile that seems to express Skandagupta’s prowess. For the maintenance of the image/temple Skandagupta assigned a community/village (grāma) to the deity, that is to say, he exempted this community from taxes, so that its surplus production could be used for worship and maintenance. Both beneficial acts were performed to increase the merit of the deceased father, Kumāragupta.</p>
<p>Pratimāgr̥has</p>
<p>When searching for galleries where effigies of kings were installed, the pra timāgr̥ha, our second category, two sites spring to mind: Māṭnear Mathurā, and a cave at Nāṇeghāt., a pass leading from the Konkan to Junnar (Pune Dist.). The latter site has been discussed by Ajay Mitra Shastri. In this cave two sets of inscriptions are found: 43</p>
<p>One of them, a large but fragmentary one is inscribed partly on the left and partly on the right walls. On its [i.e., the cave’s] back wall were put up statues of eight personages which have all disappeared almost completely and over their heads there were inscribed what may be called labels of which also only six are now extant enabling us to identify the figures originally carved below them. Going by the preserved labels there were installed statues of Simuka Sātavāhana, the founder of the dynasty, queen Nāganikā and her spouse king Sātakani (Sātakarṇi), Kumāra (prince) Bhāya, Mahāraṭhi Tranakayira, Kumāra Hakusiri and kumāra Sātavāhana. 44</p>
<p>According to Shastri the gallery was initiated by King Kr̥ṣṇa, who set up the image of his elder brother Simuka, and continued by Vediśrī, who set up the images of his father and mother Sātakarṇi and Nāganikā. Shastri argues, on the basis of the Pratimānāṭaka, that all images were erected after the death of the person involved. If his identification of these early Sātavāhana kings is correct, it would mean that this pratimāgr̥ha predates the one at Māṭand therefore cannot have been inspired by the Kuṣāṇa example. The epigraphs found in Nāṇeghāṭdo not give any reason to believe that these images were worshipped. The long inscription enumerates many Vedic sacrifices and their dakṣiṇās, but is silent as to the images.</p>
<p>The situation seems different at Māt.. The archaeological remains of a build ing and the inscribed images of the Kuṣāṇa kings Vima/Vema (Kadphises), Kaniṣka, Huviṣka (?) and others, belong to the most well-known India has produced. The epigraphs have been competently dealt with by Lüders (posthu mously published by Janert 1961). The building that housed these images is referred to as devakula in the inscriptions themselves. About this Lüders re marks:</p>
<p>43 For these inscriptions see also Sircar SI I, 190–197.</p>
<p>44 Shastri 1998, 102. Cf. Verardi 1983, 244–50.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the devakula at the Māṭsite, similarly to ‘Bhāsa’s’ devakula, served chiefly as a hall for the statues of members of the royal Kuṣāṇfamily, although, as proved by the life-size image found together with the Kaniṣka statue, images of gods were mixed up with them. 45</p>
<p>The latter concessive clause may mark a significant difference with the situation in Nāṇeghāṭand the depiction in the Pratimānāṭaka. It may account for the term devakula used in the Māṭinscriptions. ‘Bhāsa’ speaks also about a devakula, but that word is used when Bharata does not yet know whether he has to do with a ‘house of the gods’ or not. When he discovers the true nature of the monument the text uses the word pratimāgr̥ha.46 Another important difference may be related to this. Lüders remarks,</p>
<p>In one respect, however, the collection of the Kuṣāṇstatues seems to have differed from the gallery described in the Pratimānāṭaka. Bhāsa tells us that only deceased kings were honoured by setting up their images. This restriction does not seem to have prevailed in the case of the Kuṣāṇdevakula. The present inscription was engraved on the pedestal of a statue, and we may reasonably assume that, in addition to the repair of the devakula, the gift of the statue was recorded in the inscriptioṇThe statue cannot have represented the grandfather of Huviṣka, nor is it likely that it was the second image of Kaniṣka. As the donation was made for the increase of the life and strength of Huviṣka, it becomes very probable that it represented that king, but that benedictory phrase shows at the same time that the statue was set up during the lifetime of Huviṣka. 47</p>
<p>From this combined evidence it may appear that the images of the Kuṣāṇa kings were worshipped like those of gods, even when still alive. The true nature of the devakula was the subject of an interesting essay by G´erard Fussman, who compared the Māṭsanctuary with a similar one in Surkh-Kotal, also containing images of Kuṣāṇa kings. 48 He argues that we should conceive of these temples as ‘shrines where the king, his family and high officials worshipped the deity who protects the king and his family, not the temple of the godlike king’. 49 A devakula is, according to the French scholar, ‘a royal family shrine’. 50 This</p>

<p>46 Pratimānāṭaka 3. 5, 6. Cf. ibid. 3.1 paḍimāgeha, 3.13 idaṁgr̥haṁtat pratimānr̥pasya. It has to be admitted, though, that the keeper is called devakulika.</p>
<p>47 Lüders 1961, 144 f.</p>
<p>48 Fussman 1989; cf. Rosenfield 1993, 154–172. Shastri 1998, 109 refers to similar ‘small sanctuaries in the Swāt region of Afghanistan’.</p>
<p>49 Fussman 1989, 199.</p>
<p>50 Fussman 1989, 198. Cf. Frantz Grenet 2015, 209 f. discussing the Rabatak Temple and its inscription:</p>
<p>The temple is said to contain images of Kani˘ska’s three direct ancestors and prede cessors (Kujula Kadphises, Vima Taktu, Vima Kadphises), and of himself: as in the Surkh Kotal temple, and also at Māṭin Mathura, another royal foundation, the royal statues are commemorative and not in themselves an object of worship (despite the enduring theory of the Kushan dynastic cult). In the Rabatak inscription gods, clearly distinguished from deceased kings, are mentioned in two contexts.</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 417</p>
<p>connotation accords well with the use of the term in the Vākāṭaka inscriptions, in which the state sanctuaries are referred to as ‘places’ (sthāna) of the devakula (above, p. 332). However, the idea of installing in these sanctuaries life-size images of the royal family itself is clearly imported into North India. Fussman’s contention that these royal images were not meant for worship in their own right remains open to doubt; the word devakula may have been used precisely because the Kuṣāṇa kings thought of themselves, or wanted their subjects to believe that they were members of the divine family (kula). 51 Their title, devaputra, also seems to endorse this. 52 Apparently the Brahmanical tradition represented by ‘Bhāsa’ found this too much to swallow, in view of the shift from devakula to pratimāgr̥ha, and, to judge by our archaeological evidence, the idea of a statue gallery as a whole became obsolete, at least in North India during the period under review. 53</p>
<p>Memorial stones</p>
<p>The third category, ‘hero-stones’, has been the subject of a seminar at Dhar wad, the papers of which have been edited by ṢSettar &amp; Günther d. Sont heimer (1982). In this volume ḌR̥Patil studies The Origin of Memorial Stones. Patil (op. cit. 48) observes that ‘. . . a memorial stone, in its basic conception, is commemorative in character, raised in memory or honour of the dead, and did not form part of the actual practice of the disposal of the dead’. Nevertheless Patil traces its origin back to this very practice by referring to early Buddhist monuments containing mortuary deposits, because in some of them a wooden post was found (Lauriya-Nandangarh), whereas an inscription in another Buddhist monument (Sui Vihar) seems to refer to such a post as a yaṣṭi raised in honour of the deceased (see below, p. 426). Typical of this type of stones seems to be that they contain a visual representation or symbol referring to the fate of those commemorated, in addition to, occasionally, a brief text.</p>
<p>Early specimens of ‘memorial stones’ as defined above seem to have been the so-called chāyāstambha or chāyāskambha (‘shade-pillar’) from Nāgārjunakoṇḍa</p>
<p>51 Von Hinüber 2004, 172 n. 234. Rosenfield 1993, 202 thinks that Iran is the most likely source of the tendency to deify the Kuṣāṇa kings. The term devakula literary means the ‘family seat of the god(s)’. When one installs a life-size image of oneself in this ‘seat’, does that not suggest that one wants to be regarded as part of that family?</p>
<p>52 Cf. Rosenfield 1993, 202 ff. Differently Grenet 2015, 209 n. 27:</p>
<p>The Kushan royal title ‘son of the god(s)/son of the lord(s)’, Bactr̥bagopouro, Indian devaputra, are no more real proof of a claim to divine filiation as theopatōr on some Arsacid coins, probably corresponding to a genuine Parthian word *bagpuhr. It can just as well allude to the legitimate royal filiation, eventually to the divine election.</p>
<p>A critical examination of this difficult issue is found in Verardi 1983.</p>
<p>53 Cf. above, n. 27 on p. 411. Granoff 1992, 190 reports that ‘. . . images of tīrthaṅkaras were often made for the welfare of the dead. Bharata’s funerary monument to his father also bears striking resemblances to actual funerary monuments for Jain monks in having a portrait image of the deceased. . . ’ See also below, n. 72 on p. 425. Von Hinüber 2004, 172 refers to the inscribed portrait images of Pallava kings and queens (7th century ad) in South India (see above, n. 35 on p. 413; Huntington 1985, 310; Lef`evre 2006).</p>
<p>discussed by ḤSarkar in the same volume. 54 These pillars were raised during the rule of the Ikṣvākus in the third century ad. They commemorate the death of members of the ruling class, religious personages and soldiers. One may serve as an example. King Rudrapuruṣadatta erected in the 11th year of his reign a memorial stone (chāyakaṁbha) for his mother, Mahādevī Varmabhaṭā (Vaṁmabhaṭā) belonging to the Bahaphala (i.e. Br̥hatphalāyana) gotra, who was the daughter of the Mahākṣatrapa, probably a Saka king from Ujjain. ´ 55 The pillar on which the inscription is found is decorated by one panel depicting the queeṇThe queen ‘is seated on a stool [and] holding a mirror in her hand. She is dressed like a foreign lady, accompanied by two female attendants’. 56 Sircar (op. cit. 20) argues that the word chāyā in this context means ‘image’, and thus refers to the portrait of the deceased queen above the inscription. 57 Most chāyāstambhas belong to a Buddhist milieu, but this pillar seems to be the only one that ‘was found in the precincts of a Buddhist monastery’ (Sarkar op. cit. 202). 58</p>
<p>The Saka connection is reinforced by a find in Paunī, a Sātavāhana site in the ´ Bhandara District of Maharashtra. The inscription on a memorial pillar (chāyā khaṁbha) mentions a prince (kumāra) Rupiaṁma of the Mahākṣatrapa. 59 Shas tri (1998, 66) does not believe that Rupiaṁma actually ruled over Vidarbha, as does Mirashi, but surmises that ‘he might have come over there as a pilgrim as Paunī was an important religious centre, especially for the Buddhists. . . ’. In view of this evidence, Sarkar (1982, 205) tentatively suggests that the memorial in this form, i.e. our third category, may have originated in and spread from the area under Saka rule in the first centuries of the Christian era. ´</p>
<p>54 Sarkar 1982, 199–207.</p>
<p>55 Sircar in EI XXXIV, 21.</p>
<p>56 Sarkar 1982, 202. Cf. Sircar in EI XXXIV, 21: ‘She has a head-dress; but her locks are not tied in a knot. She wears an upper garment covering her bust and a long scarf covers her right shoulder and upper right arm and also her left forearm. The queen appeared to be dressed like a foreign lady which she really was. . . ’.</p>
<p>57 For an illustration see Fig. 1 of Sarkar’s contribution to Settar &amp; Sontheimer 1982. The usage of the word chāyā in this funerary context has a close parallel in the related Greek         , (‘shade’). For chāyā meaning ‘portrait’ see Granoff 2001, 68 n. 10.</p>
<p>58 Another, somewhat later (5th century?), specimen of a memorial stone with portrait has been found in Sangsi (Kolhapur District). It depicts a funeral scene showing the figure of the queen and attendants. The inscription on it reports the erection of a stone funerary monument (śailaṁcaityakam) (i.e. the slab of stone itself, referred to by idam) by her loving husband, King Pu. . . , in order to protect/preserve (her) merits/virtues. The Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita verse runs (EI 28 (1949–50), 132 f., emended):</p>

<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 419</p>
<p>It is indeed in the Saka territories that we find corroborative evidence for ´ this hypothesis. It has the form of six ‘long narrow slabs of stone’ that were discovered ‘standing as monuments on a hillock’ at the village Andhau on the Rann of Cutch (Gujarat). 60 These stones had been erected in the (Saka) ´ year 52, i.e. ad 130, under the rule of Rāja Rudradāman, who is none other than the Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman I. 61 Four stones still carry inscriptions, one of which records that the inscribed slab of stone, referred to as laṣṭi (= yaṣṭi) in the inscription itself, had been erected (uthāpita), by Madana for his sister Jeṣṭhavīrā belonging to the Opaśati (Aupaśatika) gotra. This Madana erected in the same year similar monuments for his brother R. ṣabhadeva and his wife Yaśodattā, who is called a novice nun (śrāmaṇerī). Patil and Sarkar (op. cit. 54 f., 204 ff.) discuss a number of similar pillars, all of them from ar eas ‘where the Sakas were ruling’, and Patil concludes that they are ‘funerary ´ monuments. . . presumably intended to commemorate the dead’. 62 We have no indications that the memorial stones (yaṣṭis), such as found in Andhau, marked the spot where mortuary remains were deposited, although this may be decep tive, since the sites have not been subject to archaeological scrutiny. 63 If this is correct, however, and there are no deposits, we are here concerned with fu nerary monuments that may be thought of as forerunners of the ‘hero-stones’ (category 3), not yet carrying a picture; strictly speaking, they should be clas sified in our fourth category: funerary monuments without mortuary deposits. On the other hand, although the term yaṣṭi is used to refer to these steles, these monuments differ widely from the constructions composed of square and circular yaṣṭis as described under the heading aiḍūka in the VDhP.</p>
<p>Aiḍūkas</p>
<p>Ahicchatra</p>
<p>There exists a brick monument that has been thought to conform to and has been identified as an aiḍūka in the sense of the VDhP. This is the ‘Siva temple’ ´ at Ahicchatra (AC I), which is, in the words of Agrawala (Plate 85):</p>
<p>A massive brick structure unique of its kind in North India. On plan it is similar to the quadrangular Buddhist stūpas raised in several tiers, diminishing upwards like a gigantic staircase. The structure answers closely to what the Viṣṇudharmo ttarapurāṇa describes as an eḍūka (sic) built in three terraces (bhadra-pīṭhas), one above the other, with four stepped approaches and surmounted on the top by</p>
<p>60 EI XVI (1921-22), 19 ff.</p>
<p>61 Shastri 1998, 156 f.</p>
<p>62 Perhaps the stone slab with inscription, in which a Kosala king called Dhana(deva) is said to have erected a ketana for his father Phalgudeva, falls within the same category, as suggested by Shastri 1998, 108 (see Bakker 1986 I, 21 n. 5).</p>
<p>63 The Central-Asian tribes of the Alta¨ı Mountains, variously known as Scyths or Sakas ´ and related to the Indian Sakas, are known for their extraordinary burial practices. ´ Reference may be made to the burial mounds, or ‘kurgan’, found in Pazyryk (Korolkova 2017; cf. Het Rijk der Scythen, 74 ff.).</p>
<p>a Siva-liṅga. The monument, still having a colossal ´ Siva-liṅga on its top, must ´ therefore be identified as an eḍūka dedicated to Siva. ´ 64</p>
<p>Plate 85</p>
<p>Ahicchatra (AC I) during excavation (1940–44)</p>
<p>The identification of this structure as an eḍūka or aiḍūka, is open to doubt. Within the structure in AC I a few terracotta sculptured panels were found with depictions of Saiva mythology, such as Gan ´ . as destroying Dakṣa’s sacrifice (No. 298), a ‘Bhairava’ figure (No. 300), and the so-called ‘Dakṣiṇāmūrti’ of Siva (No. 302b; below, Plate 149), which are supposed to have decorated ‘a ´ frieze running round its upper terrace’. 65 The aiḍūka of the VDhP, on the</p>
<p>64 V.ṢAgrawala in Ancient India 4 (1947–48), 167. This identification has been taken over by several authors, among whom Shah in the ‘critical notes’ to her edition of the Third Khaṇḍa of the VDhP (1994), I p. 405.</p>
<p>65 Agrawala 1947–48, 167.</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 421</p>
<p>other hand, is explicitly not a temple and not dedicated to one god in partic ular. Moreover, there seem to be more terraces than the three bhadrapīṭhas of the VDhP, whereas there is apparently not a trace of the four Lokapālas, the thirteen bhūmikās, the āmalasāraka, and, worst, the square and circular yaṣṭis seem to be missing. A note of caution is in place here. I have not visited the site myself and base my assessment on the excavation reports. The ‘colossal Siva-liṅga’ originally may have been enshrined, as foundation walls found atop ´ the uppermost terrace seem to indicate. In view of these incongruities and uncertainties the structure crowning mound AC I and a similar one at mound AC II may therefore have been more adequately characterized by A. Ghosh who describes them as:</p>
<p>Terraced temples of brick, each terrace made on foundation cells round a square frame, filled with earth. Both of them underwent many restorations and exten sions resulting in the increase of their dimensioṇThe larger of them [i.e. AC I] was founded on a layer with typical Stratum IV (Kushan) pottery and could not therefore have been founded before the early Gupta age. 66</p>
<p>On the other hand, the mass of bricks ordered in a pyramidal, i.e. tapering framework, ending in a column or liṅga has an outward similarity with the structure described in the VDhP. It could be that Bāṇa (above, n. 4 on p. 406), describing the ‘funerary monument’ (citācaitya) of King Prabhākaravardhana in Thanesar as a ‘mass of bricks’ (sudhānicaya) resembling the form of a dart or needle (śalya), was thinking of a monument similar to the one uncovered in Ahicchatra, 300 km to the southeast of Thanesar, 150 km north of Kanauj. According to Bāṇa the ashes and bones (kīkasa) had been sent off for dispersal in holy places (tīrthasthāna), and this too would conform to the description of the aiḍūka in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, which does not mention nor refers to mortuary deposits. As far as one can tell—the description of this monument in the excavation report being very brief indeed—this would agree with the archaeological state of affairs in AC I, where no mortuary deposits have been reported. 67</p>
<p>Mansar</p>
<p>‘Unique’ as the structure may have appeared to the excavators at the time, I would like to draw attention to a recent excavation that has surprisingly much</p>
<p>66 Ghosh in EIA II, 7. Cf. Shrimali 1983 I, 149: ‘Even if it was an eḍūka, the existing structure could not be identified with that of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa. The nucleus of the structure appears to be pre-Gupta—even the sizes of the bricks used are those, which were popular in the period between c. 100 bc and c. ad 300.’</p>
<p>67 Ahicchatra has most recently been investigated by Laxshmi Greaves (2015). She con cludes (p. 219):</p>
<p>Neither the shaft at the heart of the monument, nor the foundations of AC I have been fully excavated so we cannot be entirely sure that no mortuary remains exist. Nevertheless, without further evidence being brought to light, we cannot designate AC I at Ahichhatra an aiḍūka with any confidence.</p>
<p>in common with the Ahicchatra one. These are the excavations at Mansar: MNS 3 (Plate 86). The brick structure uncovered at a mound there, the so called Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī, has been interpreted by the excavators, who failed to refer to Ahicchatra, as a mixture of Hindu temples and Buddhist stūpas.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have shown the untenability of this conflation (Bakker 2004a). As in Ahicchatra, the Mansar mound shows a series of terraces built of brick, constructed over and against a natural hillock, which makes the whole thing look like a pyramid of brick. As in Ahicchatra, the various platforms are constructed over brick boxes filled with rubble, earth and stones, a construction device also know from stūpa domes. The mistake the Mansar excavators have made is that they have confounded similarity with identity. Mansar, like Ahi cchatra, is definitively a Saiva sanctuary, identities corroborated at both sites ´ by beautiful 5th-century Saiva sculptures, of terracotta in Ahicchatra, of red ´ sandstone in Mansar. Are we to classify the Mansar structure as an aiḍūka?</p>
<p>Plate 86</p>
<p>Mansar (MNS 3)</p>
<p>The same reasons that speak against such an identification in Ahicchatra also apply to Mansar, but the Mansar site is characterized by some intriguing fea tures of its own.</p>
<p>One of these is ‘the figure of a Puruṣa made of lime’ (Plate 87). 68 This figure is truly out of the ordinary and various interpretations are possible. In Bakker 2007b and 2009a (below, p. 458) I have made a case for seeing this Man</p>
<p>68 Joshi &amp; Sharma 1999-2000, 128. Cf. Bakker 2004a, 81.</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 423</p>
<p>of Mansar as part of a construction sacrifice, in which the clay man replaced a human victim. The excavators report that ‘a vedi in the chest portion with a hole for fixing a yaṣṭi over it was made [below, Plate 105], and an earthen lamp was found nearby’. 69 Two pots have also been found near the knee of the Puruṣa, but we do not know what they may have contained. Could they have been filled with ashes? Near the figure’s left foot a small iron image of a snake was found (Plate 104).</p>
<p>In addition, though not mentioned in the excavation report, during my stay at the site (1999) some bones were said to have been recovered from one of the two natural caves in the rock at the northern side of the hill. In the excavation report these caves are identified as a ‘shrine’ and ‘meditation chamber’ (ibid. 129); due to lack of any further information, it is impossible to say with what sort of bones we are concerned and to which period they may have belonged. Anyway, there seems to be no intrinsic connection with the brick monument on top of the mound.</p>
<p>Plate 87</p>
<p>MNS 3: ‘The Man of Mansar’</p>
<p>69 Joshi &amp; Sharma 1999-2000, 128. Cf. Bakker 2004a, 81. The Puruṣa lies with his head towards the west or southwest; his trunk is partly twisted and his knees are bent. This posture seems to resemble that of some of the skeletons found in Ujjain, especially ‘skeletons Nos. 14 &amp; 38’ depicted in Plates VIIIc and IXa (AAR 1938–39, p. 16); see below, n. 82 on p. 430 and Plate 127.</p>
<p>Despite the Puruṣa, the urns, the hole to fix a yaṣṭi (here meaning ‘sacrificial post’ or yūpa), the alleged bones, and the terraced, pyramidal structure, I would be very reluctant to speak of this temple complex, referred to in inscriptions and seals as ‘Pravareśvara’ (above, p. 373, Plate 75) and called a devakulasthāna, in terms of an aiḍūka, or eḍūka for that matter.</p>
<p>For the time being our conclusion should be that so-far there have not been discovered in the Hindu sphere structures that conform, more than superficially, to the description of the aiḍūka in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa.</p>
<p>Funerary monuments with mortuary deposits</p>
<p>It remains to discuss the funerary monuments in which actual mortuary de posits have been found, the eḍūka, our fifth category.</p>
<p>As has been briefly noted above, Giuseppe de Marco brings together in an interesting article eighteen Gandhāra reliefs in which we find depictions of funerary monuments. Fifteen of them relate to the Buddhist legend of Sudāya, known form the Chinese canon. 70</p>
<p>The story is briefly given by Zwalf in his catalogue of Gandhāra Sculpture in the British Museum (I, p. 202, ad 225 = below, Plate 88):</p>
<p>A king of Candravatī (?), his mind poisoned by the jealousy of his other wives, caused his pregnant youngest wife to be killed and buried. A posthumous son [name restored as Sudāya], however, nourished himself from one breast on a half of his mother’s corpse not decomposed; when he was three the collapse of part of the tomb released him, and when he was six he met the Buddha and became an arhat.</p>
<p>The reliefs depict Sudāya in the tomb</p>
<p>at his mother’s side and his meeting</p>

<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 425</p>
<p>The funerary monuments shown on the reliefs are divided by de Marco into four types. The most common one (de Marco: type 1) is described as a (closed) ‘tumulus’ made of bricks. De Marco does not explicitly link this type with the (loṣṭa)citi, but it would seem to me that the burial mound made of bricks, known from the Kalpaśāstra, may be considered as its prototype. The other common type (de Marco: type 3) is described as a ‘hut’, ‘vihāra’, or ‘caityagr̥ha’. De Marco (op. cit. 232) observes: ‘It is difficult to determine why the funerary monuments displayed on these reliefs are this shape.’ It appears to me that some influence from outside the Indian world could be considered as a possible explanation: the sarcophagus or stone coffin, moulded according to the sim pliest form of a ‘dwelling’ in the Indian artistic idiom, the kuṭi or ‘hut’—the heavy, arched cover of the sarcophagus being interpreted as the ‘attic story’ or vault above a cubical chamber. 71 However, apart from these reliefs, no archae ological attestation of either of these two types is known to me. The question seems justified whether we are here concerned with a real historic phenomenon or an artistic convention.</p>
<p>The above two types of tombs are particularly appropriate to burial of the body. This is less obviously the case in the two remaining types (de Marco’s types 2 and 4), which consist each of one specimen only (A-2 and B-10). In one of these instances (B-10), the subject of the Sudāya legend requires the depiction of a corpse, but the monument seems incongruous (below, p. 436 and Plate 94). The other specimen (A-2), illustrating the śmaśāna, does not show a corpse at all. We shall treat these two in more detail below, when we deal with what still remains to be discussed: funerary monuments connected with the remains of cremation, i.e. ashes. It will appear that, if conceived in this way, a link of these two types with other archaeological evidence can be made.</p>
<p>Since we are particularly concerned with monuments in the Hindu sphere, we will not dwell upon the Buddhist stūpas at great length. 72 But, since the Buddhist cult of the stūpa developed out of more general South-Asian practices</p>
<p>71 See Foekema 2003, 11. Zwalf (op. cit. I, 202) describes the tomb on the relief (Plate 88) kept in the British Museum (No. 225 = de Marco’s B-2) as: ‘The hut is a cubic structure with a high arched roof covered with a leaf pattern and surmounted horizontally along its ridge by a hemi-cylindrical element supporting a large bird; it seems double-roofed like the structures underlying the false gable panel but with the upper part unusually small.’</p>
<p>72 Jaina stūpas are left out of account altogether. Jaina texts refer to stūpas and ‘stūpa worship has been depicted in a number of sculptures. . . Actual Jaina stūpas were very few, but the most important of them was that of Mathurā at Ka˙nkālī T.īlā’ (Joshi 1989a, 333). For this stūpa and its interpretation see also Folkert 1989. Phyllis Granoff, asked about this subject, kindly wrote to me the following (email 22-5-05):</p>
<p>In the Jain stories there is no relic worship. The gods take the relics to heaven and worship them there [cf. Granoff 1992, 189; Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra I, 364]. In the medieval period stūpas are regularly built for monks and images of the monks are made. They are both worshipped. The story about the first Jain images is that they are funerary images, but the accounts are pretty late [e.g. Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra I, 365–370]. It is a very interesting topic. There are also the memorials constructed where Jain monks fasted to death.</p>
<p>of mortuary ritual and disposal of the dead, and the Brahmanical or Hindu tradition evolved from the same breeding ground, it may be informative to begin with an example from the Buddhist fold, the interesting case of the Sui Vihar stūpa in Bahawalpur (Pakistan).</p>
<p>Sui Vihar</p>
<p>In the remains of this stūpa a copperplate inscription has been found, dated in the 11th year of the reign of Kaniṣka, i.e. ad 138. The inscription attests the word yaṣṭi in a funerary context and this time there is an actual connection with mortuary deposits.</p>
<p>Plate 89</p>
<p>Sui Vihar Stūpa in Bahawalpur</p>
<p>The inscription tells us that the wife of Balanandin, an upasika who was mis tress of the vihara, raised in Damana a yaṭhi for the bhikṣu Nagadatta and that</p>
<p>It seems that in later Jainism the cult of image worship is explained and justified by the doctrine that the images of the tīrthaṅkaras are actually memorial statues. Granoff 1992, p. 191:</p>
<p>The fact that temples are memorial monuments and images of the tīrtha˙nkaras are funerary statues has a certain appropriateness in the Jain traditioṇThe tīrthaṅkaras are above all martyrs, who have suffered what others might have found unendurable in their quest for religious salvation: they have also died a special death, in meditation and voluntary renunciation of all food and water.</p>
<p>This ideology did not remain uncontested (Granoff 1992, pp. 194 f.; 2001, 64 f.).</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 427</p>
<p>the mother of Balajaya, after having established the ‘foundation’ (pratiṭhana) of the yaṭhi, donated the ‘enclosure’ (anuparivara). 73</p>
<p>From the not all too clear description by Major Stubbs quoted by Konow and a drawing in Indian Antiquary (Plate 89), 74 it appears that out of an earthen mound rises a brick tower of 15 m high. About half way up the tower is a room of 8 fṭsquare, i.e. measuring c. 85 by 85 cm; its height seems to have been 2ft., i.e. 60 cm. The inscription was found at the bottom of this chamber, apparently covering a square brick shaft of 16 inch, i.e. 40 by 40 cm, going down to the mound, i.e. having a length of at least 6 m. In the chamber were found ‘coins, mixed with some pieces of iron, a few beads, fragments of ornaments, all mixed up with ashes and earth’. 75 It is unknown whether the shaft ends precisely at the mound or continues into it. The chamber may have been the relic chamber, as Konow surmises, but, in view of the other occurrences of the word yaṣṭi, we cannot follow him when he takes over Hoernle’s suggestion (Hoernle 1881, 327) and proposes that the word here refers to the monk’s staff of Nāgadatta ‘set up’ or ‘assumed’ (like a bishop’s staff) at the occasion when he assumed ‘a high clerical office’. Rather it would seem, as has been proposed by Schopen, 76 that the yaṣṭi mentioned refers somehow to the brick shaft on top of which the chamber is found and which forms the central axis or yūpa of the monument. If this is the case, the structure of the Sui Vihar monument resembles closely the two mounds M and N of Lauriya-Nandangarh, in which was found,</p>
<p>A hollow shaft, about 10 in. (25.4 cm) in diameter, running right through the centre from the bottom up to a little below the deposits of burnt human bones and a gold leaf. The shaft most probably indicates the position of the wooden post which had perished. At the bottom of the mound N, which was dug down to the natural soil, was actually found the stump of a wooden pillar in situ [Plate 90]. Significantly</p>
<p>73 This interpretation follows mainly Sircar’s rendering in SI I, 139 f.</p>

I diverge from Sircar et aḷby taking anu in composito with parivāra, a noun related to anuparivārayati: ‘to encircle’ (see Edgerton’s BHSD ṣv.).</p>

<p>76 Schopen 1997, 50 n. 61, where also textual sources and the secondary literature regarding yaṣṭi/yūpa are given and briefly discussed.</p>
<p>enough, the Divyāvadāna mentions the setting up of a pillar, called yūpa[yaṣṭi], in the interior of the dome. 77 King Devāna ˙mpiyatissa, Ceylonese contemporary of Aśoka, is stated in the Mahāva ˙msa, a Ceylonese text, to have erected a stone column to mark the site of the Mahāthūpa to be constructed in future by King Duṭṭhagāmaṇī. 78</p>
<p>It remains uncertain whether the brick</p>
<p>shaft in the Sui Vihar monument origi</p>
<p>nally enclosed a wooden column, though</p>
<p>the use of the word yaṣṭi in the in scription strongly suggests that. If</p>
<p>this is the case, it may be conjectured</p>
<p>that the yaṣṭipratiṣṭhāna that was built</p>
<p>refers to the still present brick ‘case</p>
<p>ment of the column’. 79 The building ac</p>
<p>tivity described in the inscription may</p>
<p>thus be conceived as follows: On an</p>
<p>earthen mound a wooden pole or col</p>
<p>umn (yaṣṭi) of a diameter of c. 40 cm and</p>
<p>a height of 6 m was erected (āropayati)</p>
<p>by Balanandin’s wife; then the brick</p>
<p>casement (yaṣṭipratiṣṭhāna) around the</p>
<p>column was built (sthāpayitvā) by the</p>
<p>mother of Balajaya; subsequently the</p>
<p>same mother donated (dadāti), on top</p>
<p>of the casement or shaft, a chamber or</p>

<p>The second yaṣṭi is clearly the post on top of the dome (aṇḍa). The yūpayaṣṭi is the pole within the aṇḍa.</p>
<p>78 Mitra 1971, 24 n. 12. Cf. Bloch 1906–07, 123, plate xl (= Plate 90). A difference between the shaft in Lauriya and Sui Vihar is that the one in the latter site is square and made of bricks, whereas the one in Lauriya is circular, apparently informed by the wooden column itself.</p>
<p>79 If pratiṣṭhāna would have its common meaning and refers to the ‘pedestal’ or ‘foundation’ of the yaṣṭi, the inscription does not record the exact sequence of building activities; in that case anuparivāra may refer to the casement (plus chamber?).</p>

<p>per se. This must have been the cardinal phase of the constructioṇThe en veloping brick construction, which remains today in the form of a ‘tower’, and which always may have had a more tower- than dome-like appearance, 80 was built after the donation recorded in the inscription.</p>
<p>It is evident that in the case of Sui Vihar we are concerned with a mon ument belonging to our fifth category: funerary monuments containing ashes of the deceased. Is anything similar to be found in the non-heterodox tradi tions? Or, we may ask, what had become of the Vedic option to build a citi, a pile of bricks over the bones and ashes? The citi may have occasionally lived on in burial mounds as these are attested in the Gandhāra reliefs, but when the Mahābhārata (above, n. 18 on p. 409) describes the situation at the end of the Kali Age by saying that eḍūkas have replaced temples, this expresses the concern of the author that too many people are being converted to heterodox religions, 81 not the fear that eḍūkas would eventually be worshipped all-out by those who were supposed to belong to the Brahmanical traditioṇThe few Gandhāra reliefs aside, evidence of monuments containing mortuary deposits belonging unambiguously to the Hinduized tradition in the period under inves tigation is very rare indeed.</p>
<p>The archaeology of the śmaśana ¯</p>
<p>We shall leave the monuments aside for the moment and will focus on archaeo logical sites that attest the practice of cremation and inhumatioṇIn his Burial Practices in Ancient India, Singh (1970, 131) sums up the situation of iron-age burials in North India as follows:</p>
<p>Evidence regarding the disposal of the dead during this period has been obtained from Sonepur, Rajgir and Lauria Nandangarh—all in Bihar; Rajghat (district Varanasi, U.P.) and Amreli in Gujarat. Besides, a large number of megalithic graves, tentatively datable to this period and later, have been located in the Vin dhyan ranges, Chotanagpur plateau, the Aravalli ranges and north-western India. The predominant mode of the disposal of the dead seems to be cremation and a limited quantity of charred human bones have been found buried either in urns or pits in the habitation-area itself.</p>
<p>80 See Franz 1978, 1–18, Figs. 1–17 illustrating the ‘Turmstupa’.</p>
<p>81 Allchin 1957, 1:</p>
<p>Since Lassen it has been generally accepted that this description of the Kali-yuga refers to the spread of Buddhist practices and the popular desertion of Brahmanical temples.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that the composer of this passage was exclusively thinking of Buddhism. He might have lashed out at all pan-Indian practices frowned upon by the orthodox that involved the erection of monuments over mortuary remains. Eḍūka thus seems to be a wider term than, for instance, stūpa, and it clearly has here, if not in all cases where it occurs, a pejorative connotation (cf. discussions in Goswamy 1980, 5 ff.; de Marco 1987, 228 f.).</p>
<p>One of the major sites seems to have been missed by Singh, who does not refer to the excavations at Ujjain.</p>
<p>The Kumhāra T. ekḍī in Ujjain</p>
<p>The archaeological findings at the Kumhāra T. ekḍī in Ujjain are interesting enough to deserve our attentioṇThis mound has been the subject of a pre liminary exploration by ṀB. Garde in the season of 1938–39. It is a longish mound of about 67 m long, 33 m wide and 3 m high. Trial excavations exposed about forty-two skeletons, some of them laying on their bellies others on their backs, most of them north-south with the head towards the north, but two of them with heads pointing to the southwest (below, Plate 127). 82 Garde reports the following (AAR 1938–39, 16):</p>
<p>One large urn with the neck broken off, another small urn complete, and pieces of two or three large urns were found buried in the midst of skeletons. The large urn contained a few bones, ashes and smaller pottery mostly cups and dishes. The contents of the small urn consisted of ashes and bones. A large stone mortar and quite a number of stone pedestals were found in association with the burials. [. . . ] Innumerable fragments of large and small jars, cups and dishes with which the mound is literally made up can be easily explained by this custom of burying a large number of earthen vessels and cups along with the dead body.</p>
<p>Signs of cremation were also unearthed along the lower stratum reaching down to four or five feet below the surface of the mound. Thus the customs of cremation, post cremation partial burial, and simple and complete burial appear to have been in vogue almost simultaneously during the period to which this cemetery belongs.</p>
<p>On account of the coins found—‘cast coins notably with the elephant or tree in railing on the obverse and the chaitya or mountain with a crescent above on the reverse’— Garde dates this śmaśāna to the 3rd or 2nd century BC (ibiḍp. 16), but the actual time it may have been in use could be many centuries longer. In addition to the skeletons and earthenware, ornaments were found, such as earrings and beads, and one wonders which purpose the ‘pedestals’ may have served. However tentative Garde’s excavation may have been, there can be little doubt that the mound revealed a prominent śmaśāna in the sense of ‘burial-cum-cremation ground’. We know of one prominent śmaśāna at Ujjain from the Sanskrit literature: it was allegedly the birthplace of the Pāśupata</p>
<p>82 Annual Administration Report of the Archæological Department Gwalior State (AAR) 1938–39 p. 16:</p>
<p>The faces of many were turned to the West, of some to the East, and of others upwards to the sky. The poses of a few were quite unusual for ordinary burial. Thus two skeletons had the knees bent and raised up. One of them was in a seated posture with the trunk folded and the head bent forward. Another again had the trunk twisted to right, the knees bent, and legs folded to the left. Still another was seated in a meditating attitude almost like a Buddhist monk or a jain Sadhu. A few of the skeletons, judging from their short stature and the development of pelvic cavity appeared to be females, while a few others distinctly represented youngsters.[. . . ]</p>

<p>movement, the site where Kuśika/Kauśika was believed to have been initiated by the Lord (bhagavat) Himself. 83</p>
<p>Although this accumulation of evidence may seem substantial, if we take stock of the extent of the Subcontinent and the many centuries involved, it indicates that burial, of the complete body or partial after cremation, was a marginal rather than a central phenomenon in classical India. And, unfortu nately, it does not furnish us with factual information on the monuments to the dead outside the Buddhist sphere. 84 We don’t know how the Ujjain śmaśāna looked aboveground when it was still in use. The following find in Mansar may not solve this question definitively, but it has enough fascinating characteris tics to warrant a separate treatment, which, in combination with the material collected by de Marco, may give us some idea as to what a funerary monument of a person of consequence may have been.</p>

<p>84 I find it difficult to be so sure about the scene on the eastern gateway of Stūpa 1 at Sanchi, which, according to de Marco (1987, 226, Fig. 22), ‘is certainly the tomb of a yogin belonging to the same community represented in the relief’. How to explain that we have no archaeological evidence of this sort of ancient monuments of yogins, whereas we have innumerable ones of Buddhist saints? And even if it were a tomb of a yogin, I find it hazardous to conclude from this piece of ‘evidence’ (and this tentative piece alone), that the samādhis of yogins found in South Asia to date existed all throughout Indian history (de Marco 1987, 228 n. 76).</p>
<p>The situation appears significantly altered in the later (post ad 1200) period, in which we find samādhis, chiefly of yogins and saints—e.g. the ‘śmaśāna of Pāśupatanāth’ il lustrated in de Marco 1987, Figs. 18 f., or the samādhis of Gorakhnāth yogis, ibid. Figs. 20 f.—and mausoleums or chatarīs of princes (Mishra 2003). This change may be partly due to Islamic influence; it falls outside the scope of the present investigatioṇFor the burial practice of the Gorakhnāth yogis see Briggs 1938, 39–43. For the development of the (esoteric) Saiva tantric concept of the ‘eight (nine) great cremation grounds’ (Sander- ´ son 2003–04, n. 208) in the syncretistic religion of Nepal see Bühnemann 2007 (cf. Mirnig 2016).</p>
<p>For South India this practice is attested in the Ajitāgama (see above, n. 27 on p. 411), which reports that a liṅga may be erected for Sivabhaktas ( ´ op. cit. 63.44 f.):</p>

<p>This practice is confirmed by other (late) sources (e.g. Varṇāśramacandrikā) given in Bhatt ad Ajitāgama 63.44 ff.</p>
<p>The eḍūka at Mansar</p>
<p>I have dealt with the Vākāṭaka site of Mansar in several earlier publications. In Bakker 2004a I have drawn attention to the important publication of ṬA. Wellsted in the jasb xxix, in which he reports that,</p>
<p>In 1928 a certain amount of interesting material came to light and led to the examination of the whole area surrounding Mansar tank, with the result that the traces of an extensive townsite were discovered. 85</p>
<p>Wellsted carried out a careful archaeological survey and some of the finds de scribed in his report were donated to the British Museum. In the present context Wellsted’s site ‘T’ (Figure 11) deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Figure 11</p>
<p>Wellsted’s survey map of Mansar</p>
<p>This site (encircled on the map) is situated on a direct line between the Pravareśvara Temple on the Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī (MNS 3), about 2 km to the west, and the Vaiṣṇava monuments of the Rāmagiri, 3.5 km to the east, that is to say, virtually in the middle of these two great Vākāṭaka state sanctuaries, the for mer built by King Pravarasena II, the latter by his mother, Prabhāvatī Guptā, both in the first half of the fifth century ad. The site as described by Wellsted concerns a brick shaft, uncovered and destroyed during mining work.</p>
<p>85 Wellsted 1934, 161.</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 433</p>
<p>This shaft reached to within 2 feet [60 cm] of the surface and extended downwards to the junction of the surface soil with bedrock 14 feet [4.2 m] from the surface, its total height therefore was 12 feet [3.6 m]. Of square plan, with walls of single brick construction, the space enclosed was about 4.5 sq ft [≈ 65 × 65 cm]. The bricks were of large size, 18” × 9.5” × 3.5” [≈ 45 × 24 × 9 cm]. Near the bottom, making a lower chamber 15” [38 cm] deep, was a false floor of brick. The bottom of the lower chamber was paved with brick and rested directly on bedrock. In the upper part of the shaft was filled earth from which was recovered a small snake image of greenish soapstone and some pottery. Beneath the false floor was a large spherical pot, 1 ft [30 cm] in diameter containing ashes; with it also were several small pots. (Wellsted 1934, 164)</p>
<p>On the face of it, the brick construction described resembles a mirror image of the Sui Vihar monument, but there are fundamental differences. There is no subterranean tower- or dome-like construction, something hardly to be expected, whereas another, possibly more significant difference is, that the burial gifts that accompany the urn with ashes are not so much beads and ornaments as in Sui Vihar, but ritual implements such as vessels, pots, bowls (Plate 92), a lamp, two tubular, subconical pieces of red-polished ware, 86 and the Nāga image (Plate 91).</p>
<p>Plate 91</p>
<p>Nāga (front and back) found at site T in Mansar</p>
<p>86 BM 1930.10.7.2, 3. The measurements of these two objects are 3.6” (= 9.14 cm) and 3.8” (= 9.65 cm) in height respectively (the tops of both are damaged).</p>
<p>Plate 92</p>
<p>Pottery found at site T in Mansar</p>
<p>It is important to note that partly the same items have been found at the adjacent site of MNS 3, in the hypogeum which contains the so-called Man of Mansar, viz. two pots, an oillamp and an image of a snake (Bakker 2004a, 81 f.; above, Plate 87). And, finally, in contrast to Sui Vihar, no dedicatory inscription has been discovered in the burial chamber. There might have been nothing to dedicate. The shaft is likely to have ended in a monument above the ground, not an object of worship.</p>
<p>The pottery and the Nāga image were stored in the British Museum in 1930, 87 but not the urn with ashes, which has disappeared. The coarse red ware, the size of the bricks and the smooth, perfectly sculptured soapstone im age of a rising cobra (Nāga), its central hood crowned by the typical Vākāṭaka flower cap, leave little doubt that the finds are Vākāṭaka. 88</p>
<p>As to the form of the Nāga sculpture, this differs completely from the iron snake found near the Man of Mansar (Plate 104), but it conforms to an im age found in front of the entrance of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on the Rāmagiri. 89 The size of the two Nāga images is different, but the similarity of concept is rather striking (Plate 93).</p>
<p>The function of the Nāga may have been a protective and supportive one, representing the Vāstunāga, a concept somewhat parallel to that of</p>
<p>87 The pottery: BM 1930,10.7.2–25; the Nāga image: BM 1930,10.7.1.</p>
<p>88 The height of this Nāga image including pedestal is 7.6” (= 18 cm).</p>
<p>89 For the iron snake found in MNS 3 see Bakker 2004a, Plate 6.24 = below, Plate 104: it is a crawling snake. The Nāgas found in front of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple and at site T, on the other hand, are frozen in a position in which the hood is raised and expanded to ward off danger; the snake hood in this position may be imagined to support what is placed on top of it (ādhāraśakti).</p>

<p>the Vāstupuruṣa: a local snake-deity of the site, ritually converted to the guardian of the vāstu, homologized with the cosmic Ananta, who carries the building/earth on his hoods. The major difference between both images is the number of the hoods (heads)—three in the case of the burial shaft Nāga, five in the case of the temple one—which may be explained by the difference in status of the two: one protecting a funerary monument, the other the house of a god, i.e. temple.</p>

<p>The idea that a site belongs to and is protected by a Nāga, who underlies it, is common to the Hindu as well as the Buddhist traditions. 90 However, I conjec ture that at site T we are not concerned with a Buddhist or Jain monument, but with a funerary monument belonging to the mainstream tradition, to which the Vākāṭaka royal family belonged, and this on the following grounds: 1) the significant differences with the Sui Vihar monument; 2) the burial gifts, which at site T show correspondences with those found next to the Man of Mansar in MNS 3—viz. the pottery and the serpent—and the finds at the śmaśāna in Ujjain—the urn with ashes and the pottery; 3) the striking similarity of the Nāga of the burial shaft and the one found at the entrance of the Kevala– Narasiṁha Temple; 4) the situation of the site in between two Hindu state sanctuaries (devakulasthāna).</p>
<p>90 E.g. Bose 1932, 29: ‘According to the Silpaśāstras, it is imagined that a great serpent ´ (Nāga) lies encircling every building-site.’ Rāmacandra Kaulācāra’s Silpaprakāśa ´ 1.55– 60 (Boner &amp; Sarmā 1966, 4 f.

<p>The aboveground monumental part of this grave is irretrievably lost and thoughts as to what it may have looked like are necessarily of a speculative nature. The plausibility of such speculation would be increased, though, if we could connect what still remains with other instances of funerary monuments. As such I would like to adduce the two Gandhāra reliefs left out of account so far, in particular the monument shown in de Marco’s relief B-10, a spec imen that by itself makes up this author’s type 4 (Plate 94). 91 This is the only specimen that shows a subterranean and an aboveground part, and the subterranean part consists of a brick shaft.</p>
<p>Plate 94</p>
<p>Tomb of the mother of Sudāya and the latter’s meeting with the Buddha</p>
<p>At the lower end of this shaft is an arched opening out of which sticks the body of Sudāya’s mother, but, as de Marco justly remarks, as in the case of the tumuli (type 1), this ‘is clearly a representational device’ (de Marco 1987, 234). The brick shaft seems badly fitted to contain a body anyway, and the thought thrusts itself upon us that we are here concerned with what is actually a burial shaft meant to contain an urn with ashes and/or bones appropriated by the artist to illustrate the legend of Sudāya. The aboveground structure is described by de Marco as follows:</p>
<p>A high podium (adhovedikā) quadrangular in form (cāturāṣra sic), framed at the extremities by a moulded plinth and cyma, a basement with two tambours moulded</p>
<p>91 This relief had been photographed when it was in the Karachi antique market; its present location is unknown (de Marco 1987, 210).</p>
<p>21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 437</p>
<p>at the summit, and a cupola (aṇḍa or kumbha) from the centre of which rises a short pole (yaṣṭi) supporting a single umbrella ‘disc’ in the form of a spheroidal vault, similar to the topmost element (uṣṇīṣa) of the stūpa itself. 92</p>
<p>De Marco argues laboriously that we are here concerned with a sort of Buddhist memorial, but his argument is not entirely convincing. It seems to me that the structure as such is non-denominational. Aside from a general resemblance with a stūpa, there are conspicuous resemblances with the aiḍūka structure of the VDhP: three receding platforms (bhadrapīṭhas), admittedly the upper two circular (the ‘tambours’) and not square, on which stands an aṇḍa (the ‘cupola’), which, in another context, could also be interpreted as a liṅga-like (liṅgarūpa) column; from this rises again a column or yaṣṭi that is crowned by a spherical element, interpreted by de Marco as a (single) ‘umbrella’ (chattri). Note, not the triple umbrella usual for a Buddhist stūpa.93</p>
<p>Since Gustav Roth’s Symbolism of the Stūpa (Roth 1980), we may take it for certain that the author of the VDhP calqued his Hindu aiḍūka on a Buddhist example, but by doing this he elaborated on what must have been a monumen tal tradition that was common to all Indian religions, most pronounced within Buddhism, less in Jainism, and inconspicuous in the Hindu mainstream.</p>
<p>It might be useful to draw a comparison here with the monument depicted in de Marco’s relief A-1, classified by him again as a type by itself (type 2: ‘square plan monuments’), which lacks the subterranean part of B-10, since the myth represented did not require its depiction (Plate 95). The śmaśāna scene of this relief makes it clear that it represents a funerary monument. 94 It consists of,</p>
<p>A high quadrangular stone podium, decorated, on the visible side, with a sort of disc or circular emblem. From the platform rises a cylindrical structure terminating in a cupola, slightly compressed at the sides and flattened at the top, with a similar element of smaller dimensions rising from the summit. 95</p>
<p>92 De Marco 1987, 212.</p>
<p>93 Similar structures are depicted in the petroglyphs found in Oshibat on the upper Indus River in northern PakistaṇBemmann &amp; K¨onig (1994) classify these pictures, given in Tafel 24–27, as ‘stūpas’, but they may rather be funerary monuments of a more general nature, as the crowning with a trident (18:227), the crescent and sun (18:127, 18:199, 18:156), or a pennant (18:269, 20:2) seems to indicate. Also the pictures in Tafel 32, classified as ‘Scene’, are monuments rather than Buddhist stūpas.</p>
<p>94 This regards a relief that is kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum (IS.1-1945) and has been described by Ackermann 1975, 107–109. The scene is found in the lowest of three registers that make up this relief; it depicts the episode of a boy bound in the cemetery (i.e., śmaśāna) who takes refuge with the Buddha. For the identification of this scene see Santoro 1980, 106 f., who bases herself on the Chinese Tripiṭaka (Tsa p’i-yü ching II, 20 = Taishō Issaikyō IV, nr. 205, pp. 507, c, 7-508, a, 1), translated by P. Daffin`a. Ackermann 1975, 107 had described this funerary monument as a ‘miniature vihāra’.</p>
<p>95 De Marco 1987, 196. Cf. the description given by Ackermann 1975, 107 f.:</p>
<p>The vihāra between the Buddha and the boy stands on a cubic block of stone, its visible side is decorated by a round, shield-like protuberance. The vihāra itself consists of a cylindrical body and the double, vaulted roof, decorated with a rhomboid patterṇThe opening of the vihāra is assumed to be on the side turned towards the child.</p>
<p>This structure too, with its alternation</p>
<p>of square and round vertical elements—</p>
<p>there seems to be one more quadrangu</p>
<p>lar podium below the one that is deco</p>
<p>rated by the ‘protuberance’—echoes the</p>
<p>VDhP description, or rather the other</p>
<p>way round. Although certainly differ</p>
<p>ent in many details, I think that the</p>
<p>structures of A-1 and B-10 are basically</p>
<p>the same, and that they are variants of</p>
<p>the modest beginning that in the Viṣṇu dharmottarapurāṇa, under Buddhist in fluence, has evolved into the phantas</p>
<p>tic aiḍūka. Another variant of such a</p>

<p>Funerary monument in Smaśāna ´</p>
<p>structure, a true eḍūka, might have once crowned the burial shaft in Mansar, as it might have done the śmaśāna at Ujjain.</p>
<p>A funerary monument to Prabhāvatī Guptā?</p>
<p>The prominent situation of the findspot of the burial shaft, site T in Mansar, in between the two Vākāṭaka (Hindu) state sanctuaries, suggests the pres tigious character that the funerary monument must have had in the eyes of contemporaries; it may have called to mind an important public figure. In an earlier publication I have conjectured, on account of the Nāga guarding the burial chamber, that this public figure may have been Prabhāvatī Guptā her self, ‘Pravarasena’s remarkable Bhāgavata mother, the queen who styled herself as belonging to the Dhāraṇa gotra, a princess who was, on her own account, an ornament of both dynasties, the Gupta and the Nāga’. 96</p>
<p>I would like to be more cautious here. If the ashes were those of Prabhāvatī she would have had two monuments, a memorial temple on the Rāmagiri and the eḍūka at issue. The latter may have marked the spot where she was cre mated, the former was the place where merit was transferred to her in the next world. The two similar Nāgas found at both sites seem to underpin this hypothesis. However, a serpent underneath a structure is a common rather than a specific feature, and, apart from that, there is little that points to any person in particular. It is therefore possible altogether that the burial shaft belonged to someone else, another king, another important person of the fifth century. The anonymity of this grave illustrates again what Malamoud sees</p>

<p>as the ‘l’id´eologie fun´eraire dans le brˆahmanisme’: ‘La dur´ee de vie des mˆanes est br`eve. Le culte qui leur est rendu n’est pas fait pour leur donner ou leur permettre de garder un visage’ (Malamoud 1982, 449).</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The natural human inclination to erect monuments to the dead has been recog nized within the Brahmanical tradition since Vedic times. However, it did not really take root within Hinduism. Abhorrence of everything connected with death owing to its pollutive potential may be one of the explanatory factors. 97 Worship was reserved for those powers which could enhance the human con dition and mortuary remains were not counted among them. In this respect the Buddhist tradition with its human founder distinguished itself fundamen tally from the Hindu mainstream. The funerary structures pertaining to the Brahmanical sphere that we have surveyed were all, with the exception of the last one at site T in Mansar, ‘cenotaphs’ in essence. In order to reconcile the inclination to commemorate the dead with the religious propensity to increase merit through worship, the memorial temple, our category one, came into be ing. This became a resounding success. Literary and archaeological evidence for the other four categories, however, remains meagre within the period under review, the ancient and classical age.</p>
<p>To erect stone steles (yaṣṭis) in memory of a dear one who had passed away may have been a wide-spread custom in South Asia from neolithic times or earlier. It was apparently unknown to Vedic religion, but was accommodated to Hindu and Buddhist practices; within both religions, however, it developed in quite divergent ways. The yaṣṭis of Andhau and the one of Sui Vihar have in common that both commemorate the death of a venerated person; one of the Andhau steles was erected for a novice nun (śrāmaṇerī). A significant difference, however, is that in Sui Vihar the deceased was an initiated Buddhist monk (bhikṣu), whose ashes were deposited on top of the yaṣṭi, thus turning the monument into an object of (relic) worship, comparable to the cult of saints in Christianity; accordingly the monument was expanded into a stūpa.98 The yaṣṭi, combined with bones or ashes and appropriating, as it would seem, the Vedic idea of the burial mound (citi), thus became the stūpa of the heterodox traditions; without mortuary deposits it evolved into the memorial stones of</p>
<p>97 Malamoud 1982, 451 n. 3:</p>
<p>Le cadavre est une source majeure d’impuret´e, pour les objets et les lieux, mais aussi pour les hommes. Les survivants sont atteints d’une souillure d’autant plus grave et durable qu’ils sont plus ´etroitement apparent´es au mort.</p>
<p>98 The difference between monks and laymen should not be taken to be absolute. ‘Burial ad sanctos’ was, as Schopen 1997, 114–147, has shown, a common phenomenon in Indian Buddhism.</p>
<p>Indian folk religion. 99 The former development is earlier than the latter. The Saka tribes, who came from a background with a rich funerary tradition, may ´ have acted as a catalyst of the second development, which did not meet with great acclaim from the side of the orthodox.</p>
<p>Foreign influence may also account for another exceptional phenomenon in ancient and classical North India: the installation of human effigies within holy space, i.e. a temple. Although one indigenous example of a statue gallery has been found, this cave at Nāṇeghāṭdiffers substantially, as we have argued, from what the Kuṣāṇa kings had made for themselves. The devakulas at Māṭand Surkh Kotal are sui generis.</p>
<p>Finally the aiḍūka and eḍūka. The latter, if not a pejorative for a Buddhist stūpa, is nearly as elusive as the former. In both cases we should think of vertical, elongated or needle-like constructions, mostly of brick (in which one could see an echo of the Vedic citi), combined with one or more yaṣṭis, round or square pillars or poles, raised by way of a commemorative columṇThe general Hindu reluctance to connect it with actual remains of the dead rendered it futile: being neither temple nor relic sanctuary there were not enough incentives to construct, worship and maintain it; the Hindu funerary monument or aiḍūka never really came off the ground. The only specimen recognized as such by some scholars is the one preserved in Ahicchatra, where no mortuary deposits seem to have been found (for this we reserve the word ‘aiḍūka’), but this identification is spurious. The aiḍūka of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa is a hybrid product of śāstric imagination, calqued on a Buddhist example.</p>
<p>The remains of an eḍūka seem to have been preserved at site T in Mansar, where ashes have been found (hence our reference to it as ‘eḍūka’) and a sub terranean brick shaft was excavated, but where there is no longer a column above the ground. With the help of some Gandhāra reliefs we have made an attempt to visualize a structure that possibly once stood on top of the burial shaft and which to contemporaries may have been a ‘stab of pain’ (śokaśalya), reminding them of one of the great (wo)men of their age.</p>
<p>99 Cf. Irwin 1980, 12:</p>
<p>In my first lecture—entitled The Stūpa and the Cosmic Axis: the archaeological evidence [not available to this author]—it was shown that the primary component of the early stūpa had been an axial pillar of wood. In the earliest stage, this pillar had not been erected simply to mark the centre of the mound: it had taken structural precedence over the raising of the mound itself, the latter serving as an envelope to enclose it. Later, when earthen stūpas were superseded by more permanent structures in brick or stone, the axial function of the original type of monumental pillar was taken over by a comparitively slender pole or staff (yaṣṭi) bearing one or more umbrellas at its summit.</p>

<p>Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa∗ The Image of Man in the Sacrificial Context</p>
<p>The image of man</p>
<p>To the Greek philosopher Xenophanes (6th century bc) the following insight is ascribed:</p>
<p>But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves. 1</p>
<p>One of the fascinating aspects of early Indian thought as come down to us in the tenth book of the R. gveda is that such naive representation of the divine or of the anthropomorphic nature of the gods of the conventional religion had been transcended centuries before Xenophanes, in the masterly, mystical vision of the poet of the Hymn of Creation who observed:</p>
<p>Non-existent there was not, existent there was not theṇThere was</p>
<p>not the atmospheric space, nor the vault beyond. What stirred, where,</p>
<p>and in whose control? Was there water, a deep abyss?</p>
<p>Nor death nor immortality (mortals nor immortals) was there then;</p>
<p>there was no distinction of night or day. That One (tad ekam) breathed</p>

<p>who knows whence it came into being? [. . . ] 2</p>
<p>Yet, in the same book we encounter another cosmogonic idea which makes it clear that transcendental thought and human imagery could exist side by side; to which of these two visions preference was given depended evidently on the</p>

<p>It is to this sphere of sacrifice that we shall confine ourselves in the following essay. And, as may be derived from the Hymn of Cosmic Man, sacrifice of Man or human sacrifice, real or symbolic, is an integral part of the Indian ritualistic world. Philosophers may draw the forms of the world like abstract principles, ritualists prefer to draw them like tangible substances of flesh and blood or their homologous substitutes. But as we will see, the Indian genius of speculation and abstraction operated not only in the philosophical sphere. It may also take credit for the transformation of the cruelest of all sacrifices into a vision that synthesizes the realms of god and maṇWhat evidence, the sceptic may ask, do we have for human sacrifice in India?</p>
<p>Human sacrifice in India</p>
<p>William Crooke, one of the great connoisseurs of the living traditions of India of his time and reporter of many a crooked thing, notes in his delightful book Things Indian under the heading ‘House’:</p>
<p>Very similar to these [sciḷhouses] was the earliest Indo-Aryan house, the form of which has been handed down in the marriage shed of our days. The mate rials were wood, basket-work, and clay. The main feature was the corner-posts, which were fixed in the ground with rites, sometimes including human sacrifice, intended to conciliate the earth-spirits, and were always regarded as, in some sense, sacrosanct. 4</p>
<p>Sub voce ‘Human Sacrifice; Cannibalism’ Crooke adds to this,</p>
<p>3 R. gveda X.90.1–2,6–7; translation by F. Edgerton in: Edgerton 1965.</p>
<p>4 Crooke 1906, 258.</p>
<p>22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 445</p>
<p>All through the later course of history we meet occasional instances of the custom [i.e. of human sacrifice]. First we find the foundation sacrifice, either, as some believe, intended to appease the earth-deities of the place, or as a deliberate piece of god-making, to create a divine protector of the building. Many a fort and tank, as legend tells us, were guarded in this way. [. . . ] Whenever we [i.e. the British] build a great bridge or harbour mole, our engineers are suspected of being on the look-out for victims, and people are careful not to wander abroad at night during the time the foundation is being laid. 5</p>
<p>It is evident that all this ‘information’ is merely based on hear-say, but the fact that it was said and heard may be an indication that at least the notion of killing a human victim in the context of a construction sacrifice or Bauopfer was well-knowṇThat the practice was actually wide-spread in the rest of Asia, SE and E Asia including Japan, is well attested in the scholarly literature regarding the subject. 6</p>
<p>With regard to South Asia, however, the evidence is apparently more prob lematic, as already indicated by the title of a recent article by two Dutch anthropologists, Jordaan and Wessing—calqued on the title of an article by the French scholar Paul Mus 7—Construction Sacrifice in India ‘seen from the East’.8 The reason why it is ‘seen from the East’ is that, on the one hand, the two anthropologists find abundant (archaeological) evidence for the practice in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia; this leads them to infer (op. cit. 229) that this violent custom may actually have received impulses from South Asia, the cradle of the Indianized cultures and religions of Southeast Asia. In South Asia itself, on the other hand, the two anthropologists have ‘seen’ compara tively little hard evidence that could support their inference. They suspect, however, that this is not so much due to the absence of the practice itself, than to prejudice on the part of indologists—after all South and Southeast Asia share, according to them, ‘common prehistoric origins in Mus’ monsoon Asia’ (op. cit. 229), a dubious argument on which the two anthropologists set great store. Hence their exhortation: ‘Further archaeological research is obviously needed into various aspects of (human) sacrifice, without dismissing possible indicators out of hand as has been done in the past’ (op. cit. 228 f.).</p>
<p>Jordaan and Wessing make a distinction into two types, which partly over lap,</p>
<p>Namely appeasement sacrifice, aimed at gaining title to the land to be used from the spirits that are believed to own it, and animation sacrifice used to give the structure strength and protection by animating it with the spirit of the sacrificial victim. 9</p>

<p>6 See i.a. Winternitz 1887, 40; Jordaan &amp; Wessing 1999, 211–47. Bremmer 2007. I take ‘construction sacrifice’ as synonymous with ‘foundation sacrifice’.</p>

<p>In the Indian context the former type of rites could be subsumed under the category of Vāstuśānti or Vāstuśamana (‘Appeasement of the House’) ritu als. These rituals, to be performed whenever one begins the construction of and/or enters a newly built house are summarized by Kane in his History of Dharmaśāstra, Volume V, 790 f. They derive from prescripts in various texts pertaining to the Vedic tradition dealing with domestic sacrifices—the Gr̥hyasūtras—and develop in later digests to ‘a very elaborate affair’, which we, like Kane, pass over here, not ‘for reasons of space’ though, but because human sacrifice is not touched upon in this context.</p>
<p>Installation of the house or Vāstupratiṣṭha</p>
<p>The second type of sacrifice may be subsumed under the category of Vāstupratiṣṭhā (‘Installation of the House’), which is described by Kane (op. cit.) in Volume II, 833–36 (conflated with Vāstuśānti rites). This type of ritual also reaches back to Vedic times and is canonized in the same Gr̥hyasūtra literature.</p>
<p>A central role in these rituals is reserved for the ‘Lord of the Homestead’, Vāstoṣpati, already hymned in R. gveda 7.54.1-3, a power who is represented by a firm post. Kane gives the following description of this House Sacrifice (Vāstuyajña).</p>
<p>On an auspicious day and moment, the stone should be laid over jewels and all seeds; similarly the post is to be worshipped at the hands of four brāhmaṇas; the priest who should wear white garments, should be master of the Veda and should be accompanied by the artizans, should fix the post that is washed with water mixed with all herbs and covered with many whole rice and decked with clothes and ornaments to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras and the tunes of auspicious music; he should perform a homa with honey and clarified butter and should repeat the mantra ‘vāstoṣpate prati’ (R̥V 7.54.1); then the owner should feed brāhmaṇas with a dish of rice-milk. 10</p>
<p>All this appears to give us little more than the usual harmless Brahminical ritualism, and seems remote from the gruesome practices in which animals or humans are slaughtered in order to lend their strength to the construction, as reported by Crooke and surmised by Jordaan and Wessing. Yet, appearances may be deceptive, especially in India.</p>
<p>The two anthropologists have recourse to an authority, Stella Kramrisch, who refers to Satapathabrāhman ´ . a 1.2.3.6–7, in order to underpin the homol ogy of, on the one hand, the seeds placed underneath the foundation-stone and the rice offered to the Vāstoṣpati, and, on the other, the sacrificial animal (paśu). This homology is believed to exist, because the grain ‘has the nature of the sacrificial victim; this essence passed to sacrificial animals, it entered into</p>
<p>10 Kane II, 834 f. Gonda 1980, 154: ‘An offering (sthālīpāka cooked in milk) is made to Vāstoṣpati with the formula “drive away evil; make our wealth increase; protect us always etc”.’ Cf. Bodewitz 1977–78, 59–68; Ray 1960, 311.</p>

<p>the horse, ox, sheep and goat, and lastly into the earth with its rice and bar ley, etc’. 11 This at first sight curious doctrine goes back to early brahmanical speculation regarding the life-sustaining substance (medha) embodied in the sacrificial victim and transmitted in the sacrificial act. The primordial cosmic Puruṣa (R̥V X.90, see above) is the fountain-head of the medha. By his being sacrificed in the cosmic Puruṣamedha the medha of the Puruṣa passed on to the horse, empowering the horse-sacrifice (Aśvamedha) etc., a lineage that fi nally makes the seeds of the earth fit for sacrifice (medhya). 12 Speaking of this conception, the French scholar Charles Malamoud warns against misinterpre tation, observing that, rather than with a historical development, we are here concerned with a peculiarity of brahmanical thought, in which each part of a structure is at the same time equivalent of and comprising the whole. 13</p>
<p>All the same, it seems possible, if we take an orthodox brahmanical view, to see in the innocent vāstuyajña, House Sacrifice, its link with a less gentle, more bloody prototype, which, however, as far as house and temple building is concerned, is not attested in the texts, unless perhaps wrapped up in highly symbolic language that can be decoded only by learned brahmins and well trained indologists. Yet, to infer from this the unhistoric nature of such a bloody prototype may be a fallacy.</p>
<p>The Vedic text corpus knows of an ‘animation sacrifice’, to use Jordaan and Wessing’s terminology, not to install a house or other permanent building, but to build a make-shift sacrificial fire-altar in the Agnicayana ceremony. Archae ological evidence confirms the historic reality of this type of altars in ancient India. I refer to the three Agnicayana altars found in Jagatgram (Dehra Dun District, UP). 14</p>
<p>The building of the fire (agnicayana) and its altar is an elaborate and com plicated affair, which is comparatively well researched. The following summary therefore does not pretend to add anything new, but rather serves as an aide de-m´emoire.</p>

<p>Excursus upon the construction of the</p>
<p>Agnicayana altar</p>
<p>The ritual of placing a golden (i.e. immortal) man at the base of the fire-altar is i.a. described in Apastamba ¯ Srautasūtra ´ 16.22.3-4. Taken by and large, the procedure is as follows (leaving out the mantras to be recited with every act).</p>
<p>After preparing the ground of the fire-altar, a knobbed, gold disk or plate is laid on a lotus-leaf; on this (plate) a man of gold is laid, directed towards the east, stretched out on his back, to the right of the hole (in the plate). Then the Puruṣasāman should be sung. 15 According to the Taittirīya Saṁhitā:</p>
<p>He puts down a gold disk; gold is immortality; verily in immortality he piles the fire, for propagatioṇHe puts a golden man, to support the world of the sacrificer; if he were to put it over the perforation in the brick, he would obstruct the breath of cattle and of the sacrificer; he puts it down on the south side with head to the east: he supports the world of the sacrifice; he does not obstruct the breath of cattle and the sacrificer. 16</p>
<p>Next, after the golden man has been ‘touched’ by a verse—‘The drop hath fallen on the earth, the sky, on this seat, and on the one which was aforetime; the drop that wandereth over the third seat I offer in the seven Hotrās’ 17—the serpents (sarpa) should be saluted with three verses.</p>
<p>Homage to the serpents which are on the earth, the serpents in the atmosphere, in the sky, to those serpents homage etc. [. . . ] 18</p>

<p>22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 449</p>
<p>Ghee is sprinkled over the maṇOn either side of the man a sacrificial ladle is laid. 19 Hereafter the laying of the bricks is begun, the first one being the svayamātr̥ṇṇā (‘the naturally pierced one’) placed on the gold man to allow him to breathe. Within the altar also a living tortoise is built.</p>
<p>Then, after a square mortar (ulūkhalaka) made of udumbara wood is installed at the ‘northern shoulder’ (uttare ’ṁse) (of the fire-altar) and the fire-pot (ukhā) is placed in the middle (madhye), 20 the heads of the five sacrificial victims (paśus) are installed, the human head in the middle of the fire-pot, the head of a horse towards the west, of a bull towards the east, of a ram towards the south, and of a goat towards the north, while seven gold pieces are laid in the seven orifices of the human head.</p>
<p>Hereafter Apastamba prescribes that a snake head ( ¯ sarpaśiras) should be put on the right shoulder (dakṣiṇe ’ṁse, i.e. south side) of the fire-altar (with the same verse ‘Homage to the serpents’), which is turned away from the other sacrificial heads lest, the Taittirīya Saṁhitā (5.2.9.5) remarks, it should bite these domesticated animals instead of wild ones. 21 After the snake, Apastamba ¯ (ASS 16.28.1–3) enjoins that a human figure ( ´ puruṣākr̥ti) should be assembled (cinoti) by means of twelve ‘turns’ (paryāya) each spoken trice, a (virtual?) body stretching from east to west, the head of which coincides with the head of the golden man (puruṣaśiras). The sacrificer gives praise to this construction (upahitā) by the Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa.22</p>
<p>Though they seem to differ with respect to where exactly the puruṣa and the sarpaśiras are to be constructed, 23 both Black Yajurveda branches (the</p>
<p>19 āSS 16.22.4: ´drapsaś caskandeti puruṣam abhimr̥śya namo astu sarpebhya iti tisr̥bhir abhimantrya kr̥ṇuṣva pāja iti pañcabhir uttaravedivat puruṣaṁvyāghārya srucāv upadadhātīty u ktam k 4 k 20 According to the tradition of the Vājasaneyins it is placed on the mortar (see SBr ´ 7.5.1.26).</p>
<p>21 āSS 16.27.22: ´ namo astu sarpebhya iti dakṣiṇe ’mse sarpaśira upadadhyād viṣūcīnaṁpaśuśīrṣaih.. The verb upadhā is used for piling bricks as well as for the installa tion/placing of other items. It is therefore not clear whether a representation in brick (citi) or a real snake head is intended here. Tsuji 1983, 156 takes Mānavaśrautasūtra 8.3 to mean ‘piling of a serpent head’. Baudhāyana speaks of a ‘real’ snake head (BSS´ 10.9, Agni II, 499) that should be placed on the right (southern) part of the forehead. It may be directed towards the direction from which danger threatens the country (BSS´ 10.30; Agni II, 539).</p>
<p>22 The Puruṣa Hymn, TaiAr 3.12 (= R ¯ . V X.90; above, p. 444). As has been observed by Ca land, this element may have been derived from the tradition of the Maitrāyaṇīyas (Mai trāyaṇī Saṁhitā 3.5.1), as it is not found in the Taittirīya Saṁhitā nor in Baudhāyana Srautasūtra ´ . The Srautasūtra of the Maitrāyan ´ .īyas, the Mānava Srautasūtra ´ , indeed reads as follows (6.1.8.1, 3): ‘He should construct the ‘man-layer’ (puruṣaciti) on the northern shoulder (uttarasminn aṁse). [the same formulas] Aloof from the upper part of the body (uttarārdhāt) he should construct the head of the snake (sarpaśiras) turned away (from the body) by means of the ‘Homage to the serpents’ verses (sarpanāma); or he should assign it (only) and not (actually) construct it.’ (The same alternative in āSS´ 16.27.23).</p>
<p>23 The Hiraṇyakeśi Srautasūtra ´ places the serpent head on the left shoulder (see Caland</p>
<p>Maitrāyaṇīyas and Taittirīyas) differ from the Vājasaneyins (represented by the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a and Kātyāyana Srautasūtra ´ ) in that the Srautasūtras of ´ both Black Yajurveda traditions prescribe this human figure and serpent head to be part of the first layer of the fire-altar. The uncertainty regarding the positioning, however, the alternative allowed by two Srautasūtras ( ´ Apastamba ¯ and Mānava) to construct the serpent head only virtually, by means of formulas, and the omission of the human figure in Baudhāyana bespeak the idiosyncrasy of this part of the ritual. 24</p>
<p>It is clear that the central role of the human head (and the four animal heads) in the piling up of the fire-altar presuposes sacrificial slaughter of some sort. According to the Srautasūtras of the Black Yajurveda, the human head ´ should be cut off of a kṣatriya or vaiśya killed by an arrow or the thunderbolt, 25 after which it has to be covered with clay and set aside. 26 The tradition of the White Yajurveda is more explicit that this ritual requires a human sacri fice. The Satapathabrāhman ´ . a (6.2.1.18) unambiguously declares that ‘a man (puruṣa) should be sacrificed first, for man is the first of the sacrificial animals (paśu)’. The Kātyāyana Srautasūtra ´ states that the victim, a vaiśya or rājanya (16.1.17), should be suffocated in a special secluded place, 27 after which his head is taken (16.1.18), though it allows the option that a head of gold or clay is used as a substitute. 28 This may have become common practice when animal</p>
<p>ad āSS 16.27.22). As to the place of the human figure Caland ( ´ ad loc.) remarks: ‘Art und Weise ihrer Schichtung sind undeutlich.’</p>
<p>24 It is conceivable that the theologians of the White Yajurveda, the Vājasaneyins (as well as Baudhāyana), in view of their identification of the altar with the Puruṣa (SBr ´ 6.1.1.3-7), took the totality of the bricks of the first layer itself as a representation of the puruṣa, which would render another puruṣa figure, in addition of the man of gold and the altar itself, redundant. On the other hand, though, the omission of the serpent head remains intriguing. As we have seen, the serpents were earlier invoked, by the same verses but without the examplifying head, after the man of gold had been installed and the Puruṣasāman had been sung.</p>
<p>25 āSS 16.6.2-3; cf. V ´ SS 2.1.1.50 and M ´ SS 6.1.2.23 ( ´ vaiśya and rājanyabandhu). According to Baudhāyana Srautasūtra ´ 10.9 it should be the head of a vaiśya killed in battle (Agni II, 499).</p>
<p>26 mr̥dā pralipya nidadhāti, āSS 16.6.7; cf. B ´ SS 10.10 ( ´ Agni II, 501). The ritual according to Caland’s translation of Apastamba (A ¯ SS 16.6.2–4) is as follows: ´</p>
<p>Dann geht er mit sieben oder einundzwanzig Bohnen in der Hand, um einen Men schenkopf zu holen, der von einem Vaiśya oder Kṣatriya herrührt, welcher durch einen Pfeil (im Kriege) oder durch den Blitz get¨otet worden ist. Nachdem er die Bohnen in der Nähe (des K¨orpers) hingeworfen hat, haut er den Menschenkopf ab mit der Formel: ,Der du hier bist, dem dir dieses Haupt angeh¨ort, durch dieses Haupt sollst du dort im Besitze eines Hauptes sein’ und legt dann an die Stelle des Kopfes einen siebenfach durchl¨ocherten Ameisenhaufen nieder. Er singt, während er rechts um das Haupt herumgeht, die drei an Yama gerichteten Verse. [. . . ]</p>

<p>28 KSS 16.1.32: ´ anyāni vā hiraṇmayāni vā mr̥nmayāni vānālabhyaitāṇCf. Dvaidha Sūtra (BSS 22.2): ‘As for the preparation of the heads of the sacrificial victims: Baudhāyana ´ says they should be either real or made of clay. Sālīki says that they should be real ones ´ only. Aupamanyava says that they should be made of gold.’ (Agni II, 613)</p>
<p>22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 451</p>
<p>sacrifice, not to speak of human sacrifice, had become tabu. The bodies of the four animal victims are thrown into the water from where the clay is taken to make the bricks. 29 What is done with the decapitated human corpse remains unclear in the Srautasūtras. The ´ Satapathabrāhman ´ . a strongly suggests that all trunks are thrown into the water: 30</p>
<p>As to these glories (śriyah.), [identified with the elixir of life (rasa) in SBr 6.1.1.4.], ´ they are these very heads of the sacrificial victims and these trunks are the five (altar) layers (citi). Therefore, after having placed the heads of the sacrificial victims, one piles up the layers; then one unites these trunks with these same heads. 31</p>
<p>Although the obvious interpretation takes the layers as a substitute of the trunks, it cannot be excluded that, especially in the case of the human paśu, the body of the victim was, occasionally perhaps, interred into the altar, to the effect that the Puruṣa, i.e. 1) the Demiurge Prajāpati, 2) the sacrificial victim, and 3) the sacrificer (yajamāna), became reintegrated in the sacrificial sphere, a reintegration that is the alpha and the omega of the Agnicayana, for instance reflected in the golden man.</p>
<p>In total the altar consists of five layers of brick, which may have the shape of a bird, especially the śyena (hawk), which is the default, but optionally also that of a triangle, a chariot-wheel, a trough, a circle, or a burial mound (i.e. square). 32 When this brick altar has been completed the āhavanīya fire is established on it.</p>

<p>Preliminary conclusion</p>
<p>From their inception the Indian higher, i.e. literate, religions (I am limiting myself here to Vedism and Hinduism) know of and prescribe construction sac rifices, mostly of a highly symbolic nature. To judge by the texts, human sacrifice seems only to have played a role in the construction of a make-shift fire-altar, not in that of permanent constructions.</p>
<p>Theoretically, it is quite possible to conceive of an Indian construction sacri fice, including human victims, that evolved from ideas and practices developed in the context of the building of the Agnicayana altar, but if such an evolution took place, it did not find expression in Sanskrit texts dating from before the sixth century ad. It is remarkable, for instance, that the classical Indian Book of the State, the Arthaśāstra, though elaborately describing the lay-out and building of cities and fortifications (2.3), does not spend one word on construc tion sacrifices. It is of course perfectly conceivable that blood-sacrifices of this sort belonged to a realm less well represented by Brahmanical and Hindu scrip tures, but if this were the case on the scale suggested by Jordaan and Wessing, this would have become obvious long time ago through archaeology. Of course, we subscribe to their exhortation to do more unbiased archaeological research, but much of this type of research has been done, and its outcome seems to be that human remains as part of the foundations of stone buildings in India occur only rarely. 34</p>

<p>Yet, unnoticed instances do occur, and I wish to draw attention to two of them here. Both of them have so far not been seen as examples of construction sacrifices, but I would like to argue that their evidence is best explained by interpreting them as such. And both could be seen as ‘construction variants’ of the Agnicayana altar, the intellectual feasibility of which was postulated above.</p>
<p>Kauśāmbī</p>
<p>In his report of the excavations in Kauśāmbī, G.R̥Sharma claims to have uncovered the remains of a genuine Agnicayana altar, outside of the eastern gate, within an enclosure-wall, sandwiched between the ramparts and the moat of this ancient towṇThis structure is assigned to the 2nd century bc.</p>

<p>in the excavation of a mound known as Meḍh in the village of Gokul near Mahāsthān in the District Bogra, West Bengal. In addition to this skeleton, a gold leaf with the figure of a bull has been found. The excavation is reported by ṇG. Majumdar in ASI Annual Report 1935–36, 67–69. This very interesting site requires another study, especially because there seem to be striking parallels with the Mansar excavations (see below).</p>
<p>The second site is at Keesargutta, District Hydarabad of Andhra Pradesh, reported in IAR 1978–79, 63 f.: ‘The skeleton, the head facing down and hands joined together above the head, in anjali-mudra, probably represents narabali performed before the construction of the shrine.’</p>
<p>Within the alleged five layers of the altar ‘a large number of human skulls and bones of animals of different species, meticulously arranged’ were found. 35</p>

<p>Layer three ‘yielded the largest number of bones with a preponderance of hu man bone’: ‘three complete human skulls, ten skull pieces and other skeletal material’. 37 Summarizing, Sharma states that,</p>

<p>22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 455</p>
<p>Sharma’s conclusions have been challenged by Schlingloff, whose criticism is in particular directed against the alleged historicity of the human sacrifice (puru ṣamedha). 38 The criticism of Romila Thapar takes a different route. She not so much doubts the historicity of the puruṣamedha, but calls the ‘fire-altar’ itself into question.</p>
<p>The identification of the site as a fire-altar does raise some problems. The location of the altar so close to the ramparts of the city seems unusual. [. . . ] The shape of the bird as presently reconstructed appears to be rather curvilinear, whereas the bricks used for the altar would indicate a more rectilinear form. The interpretation of the objects found is also not convincing. [. . . ] The frequency of human skulls and bones would also seem to suggest a ritual different from that described in the texts and it certainly is in excess of what is required. [. . . ] there can be little doubt that the structure did represent some kind of sacrificial or funerary site. 39</p>
<p>Comparison of the Kauśāmbī brick structure with the fire-altar remains in Ja gatgram makes it clear at a single glance that the two are completely different. Thapar is right when she notes that the location where this brick construction was found, at the foot of the ramparts, is unusual and I would like to go one step further, saying that this location virtually excludes the possibility that we are here concerned with an Agnicayana altar, which has to and can only be con structed in an open field. The great number of animal and human remains also seems incompatible with the Agnicayana ritual. Neither can I accept Schling loff’s suggestion that we may here be concerned with a ritual ‘Grabstätte’ or cemetery just like that. The location speaks against it and what to do with all the animal bones? The excavation is in need of a thorough reassessment, but my tentative suggestion would be that the uncovered brick structure rep resents the material remains of a construction sacrifice performed to ‘animate’, i.e. strengthen the defence constructions of the towṇTaking its clue from the paradigmatic Agnicayana, this sacrifice entailed that animals and humans were slaughtered and bricked into an altar-like structure, yielding a ‘Grabstätte’ of a very peculiar kind. And what remains valid of Sharma’s conclusions, against Schlingloff, is that the site does indeed testify to the practice of a Puruṣamedha, human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Mansar</p>
<p>My other example is taken from the excavations in Mansar, 5 km west of the Rāmagiri/Ramtek, Maharashtra. We shall focus here on the excavation of the site MNS 3, the so-called Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī, where a large and complicated temple complex has been unearthed. I have dealt with this excavation extensively at other occasions. 40</p>

<p>Here I shall concentrate on the alleged ‘two sacrificial altars, one in the shape of a śyena-citi [hawk] and the other a kūrma-citi [turtle], made of bricks’, 41 exposed by the excavators A.K. Sharma and J.P. Joshi in excavations carried out between 1998 and 2000. 42 These two putative ‘altars’ have been found half-way up a natural hill that is completely covered by brick constructions, the nature of which is controversial, but the most plausible interpretation of which takes them as the remains of a large Hindu temple complex (above, p. 421, Plate 86). The ‘altar’ layer is assigned to the 3rd century ad by the excavators, but, as we have argued, may be one or two centuries later.</p>
<p>Plate 102</p>
<p>MNS 3 (Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī): Altar Site</p>
<p>As in the case of Kauśāmbī, the location—on a hillock, at the foot of, or underneath a Hindu temple—makes it very unlikely a priori that we have to do with a Vedic Agnicayana altar, as suggested by the excavators. No animal or human bones have been found in connection with these ‘altars’, but the area has yielded a most extraordinary and unique find (see above, p. 422, Plate 87).</p>

<p>In the śyenaciti, [a more than life-size] figure of a Puruṣa made of lime has been found sacrificed with his head smashed. The head of the figure is oriented towards west, whereas the legs are put towards east. A vedi in the chest portion with a hole for fixing a yaṣṭi over it was made and an earthen lamp was found kept nearby. Two pots have also been kept near the knee region of the figure which lies on his right side with an iron snake kept near his left toe, looking towards the human figure. 43</p>

<p>When we collect all the unearthed evidence carefully and compare this with the ritual of building an Agnicayana altar as described in the literature, only one conclusion is possible: the Mansar site is not an Agnicayana locatioṇThe most serious objection against such an identification is perhaps that the ‘altars’, though fantastic constructions, do not consist of five layers of bricks. All the same, like in Kauśāmbī, much of the evidence seems to reflect an Agnicayana paradigm. One of the conspicuous points in common with Kauśāmbī (Plate 101) is the discovery of a little iron snake (Plate 104, cf. Plate 101).</p>

<p>MNS 3: snake at the left foot of the Manasarapuruṣa</p>
<p>Whereas in Kauśāmbī in the 2nd century bc the foundation structures may still have been reinforced by real animal and human victims, 600 years later, in the heyday of India’s classical culture, when the doctrine of no-injury, ahiṁsā, was fully developed, the same effect may have been thought obtainable by an effigy, the Man of Mansar, or Manasarapuruṣa. To cut a long story short, I believe that the excavators of Mansar hit upon the remains of a construction sacrifice.</p>
<p>The meaning and function of the Man of Mansar, the ceremony with which he was installed, and the purport of his makers may have comprised elements from the interpretation schemes that we have discussed:</p>
<p>1 The idea of reintegration of man and God through the sacrificial insertion of a (substitute) human figure into the brick fundament of an altar or sacred building, as the case may be.</p>
<p>2 The idea of a (human) sacrifice to safeguard the building, by warding off genii loci, on the one hand, and by embedding it in a recreated micro macrocosmic unity, on the other.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Homestead, Vāstoṣpati, who was subsequently installed and worshipped, may have been represented by a firm wooden post that was placed in the hole in the breast of the clay figure (Plate 105).</p>
<p>Earlier we envisaged the theoretical possibility that a new concept of a con struction sacrifice could have evolved from ideas and practices developed in the context of the Agnicayana altar, but added that, if such an evolution took place, it did not find expression in Sanskrit texts that date from before the</p>
<p>22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 459</p>
<p>sixth century ad. We have seen next that the evidence of at least two archaeo logical sites is indicative of such an evolution: Kauśāmbī and Mansar, to which, maybe, Gokul (above, n. 34 on p. 452) is to be added.</p>
<p>Plate 105</p>
<p>Breast of the Manasarapuruṣa with hole to fix the Vāstoṣpati</p>
<p>Discussing this material with my friend Phyllis Granoff, she made a significant observation which I would like to quote. She refers to Jain stories,</p>
<p>In which people have to undergo tremendous troubles in order to build a temple. In fact, they often have to die. I think this may also be a reworking or memory trace of a construction sacrifice. Sometimes the donor or yajamāna has to die; in a few cases he has to give up the possibility of having children, which is also a kind of death. 44</p>
<p>On the other hand, Granoff (op. cit. 316) refers to the ‘common belief that a temple built over bones of a dead person was doomed to collapse’. This belief may reflect the historical process, in which blood sacrifice gradually became tabu and was replaced by symbolic representations as described here.</p>
<p>The Vastupurus ¯ .a</p>
<p>The restrictive clause limiting our search to texts from before the sixth cen tury ad is deliberate. This is because I am of the opinion that from that century onwards we see a new concept gradually taking shape in the religious literature, an idea which raises the Kauśāmbī–Mansar progression that we ten tatively elaborated to a higher level of doctrinal abstraction, so characteristic</p>
<p>44 See Granoff 1992a, 315.</p>
<p>of medieval Hinduism. I mean the idea of the Vāstupuruṣa, the ‘Man of the Homestead’, first encountered in the Br̥hatsaṁhitā.45</p>
<p>The author Varāhamihira (mid 6th century) begins his chapter on ‘Archi tecture’ with the following two verses, after having said that the science of house-building (vāstujñāna) came down from Brahmā.</p>
<p>To be more precise, there was a being that by his body obstructed the earth and the sky; that being was forcibly seized by the immortals, who felled him, head dowṇAnd wherever a god held it, there that god became established; the Creator ordained that the House Man (vāstunara) was to consist of those immortals. 46</p>
<p>This myth, which still strongly shows the mark of the Vedic concept of the Cosmic Man (Puruṣa), became the basis of an ideology that we find in nearly all Sanskrit texts dealing with the Hindu temple, be they sectarian religious scriptures (Agamas), or technical treatises concerned with architecture and the ¯ like, Silpaśāstra. The central idea is that underneath the Hindu temple lies a ´ diagram, a maṇḍala, that embodies the cosmic Puruṣa and houses all divinities. The temple, thus founded on a macrocosmic grid, is a junction of this world and the other, a fusion of micro- and macrocosm. Seen in this way the ideology of the temple continues that of the Agnicayana altar. 47</p>
<p>The ritual application of the theoretical concept of the Vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala is described by ṇR̥Bhatt as follows.</p>
<p>The performer of the installation ceremony then draws a diagram called Vāstu maṇḍala on the site made even and clean and performs a fire ritual to please the deities of the lords of this maṇḍala. Vāstu means a site for dwelling. Vāstu puruṣa is a deity who governs the site and is lying on the site, and his limbs are occupied by different deities. Before construction, these deities are to be pleased and permission to use the site is to be obtained. This ritual is named vāstupūjā.48</p>
<p>Kandhar</p>
<p>Occasionally a human-shaped figure in lieu of a maṇḍala may be found. Such a stone structure has been discovered, for instance, at Kandhar (Dist. Nanded, Maharashtra) in excavations conducted by ṀK. Dhavalikar and A.P. Jam khedkar. 49</p>
<p>Excavation revealed the remains of a unique stone structure which is human shaped (22 m long and 7 m wide) and is enclosed by a double stone wall (37 m × 33 m). It is provided with an entrance on the east. [. . . ] The structure is built of dressed</p>
<p>45 Shastri, 1991, 143–157.</p>
<p>46 Varāhamihira, Br̥hatsaṁhitā 53.2–3:</p>

<p>stones in mud masonry, the intervening space being filled in with pebbles. The maximum length from head to toe is 23.05 m and the head portion, which is in the northwest, is 6.35 m long and 4.85 m wide. The legs, which are in the southeast direction, are 10.88 m long and their maximum width at the thigh is 2.20 m. [. . . ] The left-half of the head is destroyed. Around the head was a pavement of stone rubble in mud masonry which is 0.88 m wide. Near the legs was noticed a circular pit, which is now full of fallen stones. (IAR 1983–84, 58 f.)</p>

<p>Human figure underneath temple in Kandhar</p>
<p>This remarkable structure may be half a millennium later than the Manasarapuruṣa—dating from the Rāṣṭrakūṭa period—and lacks the lat ter’s sophistication, but it more clearly reflects the literary idea of the Vāstupuruṣa. A conspicous agreement between both figures is the direction of head and legs: northwest/southeast.</p>
<p>Curdi</p>
<p>Finally I would like to discuss briefly a figure found in Curdi (Goa). I am obliged to my friend Frans Janssen for sharing this information with me. The more than life-size image is made of laterite stone and is situated between a temple and a tank. In between the left arm and the trunk is the effaced image of a child still visible.</p>
<p>The featuring of the child proves that we are here concerned with another type of image that may rather be classified as a fertility icoṇIn that respect</p>
<p>the brief description of Dr Shirodkar in the Purabhilekh-Puratatva 50 may be correct, when he calls the image a Lajjā Gaurī, although we usually understand a completely different type of icon by that term.</p>

<p>Final remark</p>
<p>Apart from a few rare exceptions, the idea of the Vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala is first and foremost a mythological and theoretical, ritualistic concept, which has hardly, if at all, had demonstrable effects on the actual architecture of the temple, or its archaeology for that matter.</p>
<p>As such it is one more ingenuous product of brahmanical ritualistic specu lation, and it carries its hallmark: abstractioṇTaking its origin from the con struction sacrifice, such as represented by the Manasarapuruṣa, and ultimately from the Puruṣamedha in the context of the make-shift fire-altar, the sacrifice of Man or sacrifial man is thus preserved in the concept of the Vāstupuruṣa. It testifies to the civilizing force of brahmanical culture, which first banned human and then animal sacrifice, and which teaches us that even the most gruesome of religious practices can be viewed under the perspective of the sublime.
