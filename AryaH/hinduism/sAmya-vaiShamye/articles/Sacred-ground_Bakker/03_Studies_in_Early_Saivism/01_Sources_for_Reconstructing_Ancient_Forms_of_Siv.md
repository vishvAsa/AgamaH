Siva Caturmukha ´ 

The myth of Tilottamā 

In chapter 203 of the Adiparvan ¯ of the Mahābhārata we are told that, in order to kill the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, who could only be killed by each other, Viśvakarman, ordered by Brahmā, creates a woman of unparallelled beauty. The Grandfather tells her to go to the two demons and to seduce them in order that they may kill one and other in their rivalry over her. This beauty, named Tilottamā, promises to do so and takes her leave of the gods by making a circumambulatioṇAmong those gods is Bhagavat Maheśvara, who sits to the south (sciḷof Brahmā) with his face turned east, whereas the gods sit to the north (of him) and the r̥ṣis all around (see below Textual Sources No. 2 (TS 2) v. 21). Only Indra and Bhagavat Sthāṇu (i.e. Maheśvara) are able to preserve their composure, but the latter’s excessive desire to watch her (draṣṭu kāmasya cātyartham. ) leads to the coming forth of three more faces (mukha), one directed towards the south, which is possessed of curling lashes (añcita pakṣmāntam), one to the west and one to the north, the latter two not further qualified (TS 2 vv. 22–24). In this way Sthāṇu Mahādeva became four-faced (caturmukhah.). Indra, on the other hand, issues forth eyes on all sides up to a thousand (TS 2 vv. 25–26). 

The curling eyelashes apart, the myth in this form does not yet refer to dif ferent aspects of Siva that are represented by these faces, but his qualification ´ of ‘Post’ (sthāṇu) may hint at his ithyphallic nature. That the appellation ‘Sthāṇu’ may have a phallic connotation emerges from the ambiguous and rather obscure nirukti in MBh 7.173.92 (TS 5 v. 92): ‘Because he burns (/de stroys) when standing erect, and, because his standing (erect) is the arising of the vital breath, and, because his phallus is always standing, therefore is he known as “Post”.’ 1 

The myth of Tilottamā is taken up in the Anuśāsanaparvan, where signif icant iconographic features are added. An allusion to his ithyphallic nature

is absent here. Instead it is explained how Siva assumed a quadruple form ´ (caturmūrtitva), which may not be exactly equivalent to ‘a form with four heads’ (TS 7 vv. 3–6). 

Wherever she with beautiful teeth (i.e. Tilottamā) came into my vicinity, there, O Goddess, emerged a lovely head of mine. Wishing to watch her, I assumed a quadruple form with the help of yoga. Having become four-faced, while showing my own yoga, I exercise sovereignty (indratva) with my eastern face, with my northern one I sport (ramāmi) with you, O blameless one (Umā); my western face is gentle (saumya) and conveys happiness to all living beings; my southern face, which has a terrifying appearance and is fierce (raudra), destroys the creatures. 

Translating this description into iconography, we may tentatively infer that the main head, which faces east, has the stern countenance of the yogin, that the southern face expresses the ferocious (ugra) aspect, that the northern face ex presses delight(√ ram), whereas the western benevolent (saumya) face, which bestows happiness to the world, may have, by virtue of this function, a regal appearance, which may be symbolized by the turban (uṣṇīṣa), although the text does not explicitly specify this headgear. The Mahābhārata text seems to assign these four aspects—asceticism (yogin), ferociousness (ugra/raudra), benevolence (saumya) towards the world (i.e. uṣṇīṣin), and delight—to an an thropomorphic form of Siva Maheśvara, who describes himself further as pos- ´ sessed of matted hair (jaṭila), celibate (brahmacārin), with the Pināka bow in his hand, and with a lustrous throat, śrīkaṇṭha (TS 7 vv. 7–8). It is this quartet of aspects that seems to underly, admittedly with some variations, the early sculptural representations of Siva, no matter whether we are concerned with a ´ caturmukhaliṅga (aniconic) or with an anthropomorphic image. This may be illustrated by some early examples. 

Images of Siva in his quadruple form ´ 

In the statue found in Bhita, datable around the beginning of the Common Era, 2 Siva’s main characteristic, viz. his ascetic, i.e. ´ yogin nature, is repre sented by the central anthropomorphic figure, who is provided with matted locks (jaṭila) and penis erectus (Plate 109). Unlike his description in the Mahābhārata quoted above this central figure does not carry the bow Pināka, but rather seems to conform to devotional demands in that he carries the vessel (kalaśa) of amr̥ta in his left hand, while the right hand seems to be raised in abhayamudrā.3 

This main deity is further characterized by four distinctive aspects symbol ized by a ‘girdle’ of four heads around his waist, only partly in conformity with the Mahābhārata descriptioṇOne of the heads clearly represents

his ferocious aspect (ugra) and may therefore be directed towards the south, which would entail that the main central figure is facing southwest. 4 The head to the left of the ugra face— 

i.e. the one directed towards the east, if   

the main image faces southwest—is de 

scribed by Kreisel in Die Siva-Bildwerke der ´ 

Mathurā-Kunst as follows. 

Als einziger der Häupter ist er ohne Ohr 

und Halsschmuck dargestellt. Der Haar 

ansatz ist nur als leichte Aufw¨olbung erkenn 

bar, das offenbar kurzgeschorene Haar liegt 

ohne Zeichnung glatt am Schädel—sofern 

nicht ein Kahlkopf (muṇḍa) gemeint ist. Die 

schmucklose Darstellung läßt auf den aske 

tischen Charakter dieses Kopfes schließen, 

allerdings in einem anderen Sinne als beim 

ekstatischen Yogin. 5 

The ‘ecstatic yogin’ differs from the ‘as 

cetic’ one, according to Kreisel; with 

the latter ‘scheint der gelehrte brahmani 

sche Asket, wahrscheinlich der—nicht not 

wendig jugendliche—keusche Brahmacārin 

oder Saṁnyāsin gemeint zu sein’ (ibid.). 

Kreisel and others consequently arrive at a 

fivefold scheme, which is supposed to un 

derly the Bhita sculpture. 

However, the differentiation of the yogin into two forms within the context of a spa 

Plate 109 

Image found in Bhita 

tial ramification fails in the Mahābhārata description and in any other early text and it may hence be doubtful whether a fivefold scheme really informed the early sculptures. The image seems rather to express the idea of one central deity not counted as an aspect, a deity who is possessed of or shaped by four aspects, the ones specified in the Mahābhārata, of which the yogin aspect in the present image is symbolized by the head of the saṁnyāsin/ muṇḍin, which is facing east in case of a southwestern orientation of the main deity. 6 

4 If the main figure faces east, the ugra head would face northeast, which is not plausible See below, p. 507. 

5 Kreisel 1986, 58. 

6 This orientation of the Bhita sculpture is based on the assumption that the ugra head faces south. Kreisel op. cit. 60 f. takes as the most likely direction of the main figure the south, which entails that the four heads are facing the intermediate quarters. Kreisel explains this unusual orientation by the hypothesis, earlier proposed by J.ṇBanerjea 1935, 36 ff., that the Bhita sculpture represents an ancestor monument (Kreisel 1986, 55, 60). This assumption would not be contradicted, but rather reinforced, by an orientation 









The aspects represented by the remaining two heads of the Bhita sculpture, described by Kreisel as saumya and uṣṇīṣin, agree with the two other aspects assigned to Maheśvara in the quoted Mahābhārata passage, if we are allowed to equate the face qualified as saumya by Kreisel with the one that in the Mahābhārata is said to sport with Umā (ramāmi). The relation to the quar ters remains problematic however; evidently the orientation of the uṣṇīṣin and saumya faces were not yet fixed. On the basis of the text one would expect that the head with which he sports with Umā (said to face north), is placed opposite of the ugra face (said to face south), which position in the Bhita sculpture, how ever, is occupied by the turbaned head, which, according to our interpretation of the Mahābhārata text, should face west. An uṣṇīṣin head in the western quarter is indeed found in an early caturmukhaliṅga to which we turn now. 

The probably oldest Caturmukhali˙nga that   

has been found is the Mathurā liṅga pre 

served in the National Museum Delhi (NM 

65.172), which according to Kreisel is dat 

able to about ad 100 (Plate 110). 7 Its faces 

in eastern, southern and western directions 

conform to the Mahābhārata description in 

that they express Siva’s ´ yogin, ugra and 

uṣṇīṣin aspects. The northern head devi ates from the text as well as from the Bhita 

sculpture in that it shows a shaven head 

and as such may be denoted as muṇḍin. 

This head replaces ‘the one that sports with 

Umā’ of the epic, but again we are basically 

concerned with a differentiation of four as 

pects. 

Attempts to explain these earliest Saiva ´ 

images according to a fivefold scheme should 

be considered as anachronistic (Bakker 

Plate 110 

Mathurā: Caturmukhaliṅga 

1999). The liṅga or central figure itself was, when Saiva theology developed, interpreted ´ as the ‘fifth’ (invisible) aspect in order to 

bring the fourfold spatial arrangement into line with the non-iconographic five fold division known from the Taittirīya Araṅyaka (TS 1), which associates five mantras, i.e. five cosmic dimensions or functions with Sadāśiva; the first word of each mantra is explained by the commentator Sāyaṇa as the name of a face (vaktra) of God (Parameśvara), viz. Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, 

of the main figure to the southwest (nairr̥ti). According to the Gobhilagr̥hyasūtra 4.7.41 a bali offering to the pitr̥s should be made to the southwest. Cf. Gonda 1980, 55 f. on ‘the region of Nirr̥ti (southwest), the awful goddess of decay’.

and Īśāna. 8 This synthesis of a spatial and a cosmological order postdates our earliest Saiva sculptures; it is, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time ´ presented in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 3.48.1–7 (TS 16). Consequently, there is in our view nothing remarkable (‘auffallend’) about the absence of the fivefold form of Siva in the ´ Mahābhārata as observed by Kreisel, since this form is equally absent in the early sculptures. 9 

  



Plate 111 

Mathurā: Architrave with scene of liṅga worship 

What, on the other hand, is very remarkable is the comparatively little atten tion paid to the liṅga as a Saiva cult object in our early Sanskrit texts. There is ´ ample evidence which demonstrates that aniconic Siva worship was widespread ´ throughout the Indian continent at the beginning of the Common Era. Not only do we have, for instance, the testimony of the unequivocally phallic rep resentation of Siva from Gudimallam, ´ 10 which possibly dates from before the Common Era, but we also have an architrave from Mathurā, datable to the late Kṣatrapa period (middle of first century ad), which shows a liṅga sanctuary (Plate 111). 11 To this may be added the late-Kṣatrapa Caturmukhali˙nga that we have just discussed and numerous liṅgas pertaining to the Kuṣāṇa period &c. 12 

Epigraphic sources attesting the worship of Siva ´ 

Due to this rich archaeological evidence of liṅga worship, some other data of the early period have also been interpreted as referring to Siva’s ´ liṅga, such as the 

8 These five aspects, known in the scriptures of the Saiva Siddhānta as ‘the five Brahmans’, ´ are conceived of as being comprised in or as being the embodiment of Sadāśiva, an idea also reaching back to the Taittirīya Araṅyaka, which concludes the fifth formula of Īśāna with the words sadāśivom, glossed by Sāyaṇa as sa eva sadāśiva om.

two cult objects mentioned in the Mathurā Pil   

aster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61 (ad 

380/81), 13 named Upamiteśvara and Kapileśvara, 

which were installed in a sanctuary dedicated 

to the Pāśupata masters in the guruparaṁparā 

of Kuśika (Plate 112). The latter may have 

been thought to be the pupil of Siva’s Kārohan ´ . a 

avatāra, known as Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa from the 

fifth century onwards (above, p. 287). Probably 

on account of the ending ‘īśvara’, which later in 

deed mostly refers to a liṅga, these two objects are 

unanimously assumed to have been liṅgas, be it, 

according to ḌR̥Bhandarkar (followed by ḌC. 

Sircar), liṅgas of a very peculiar type, viz. those 

that contain the ‘portraits of the teachers’. 14 The 

text on the pillar reads (TS 12): 

[. . . ] āryoditācāryeṇa svapuṇyāpyāyananimittam. 

gurūṇāṁca kīrtyartham upamiteśvarakapileśvarau 

gurvāyatane guru . . . pratiṣṭhāpito [ |*] 15 

Plate 112 

Mathurā: Pilaster 

The illegible portion indicated by . . . provides room for four, possibly five syllables of which the second seems to have been a ligature; Bhandarkar 

conjectured to read five: ◦pratimāyutau, evidently conceived as an attributive adjunct of upamiteśvarakapileśvarau. To me this conjecture does not appear very plausible, for reasons of Sanskrit construction—one would expect the con jectured adjunct before and not after gurvāyatane. On the other hand, the po sition of guru . . . directly before pratiṣṭhāpitau suggests an adverbial adjunct, saying that the installation was for the benefit/to the memory of the gurus or something like that. Moreover, to my knowledge, we do not possess archaeo logical evidence of liṅgas that are adorned with portraits of human teachers. Nor is Sircar’s speculation to the effect that, ‘the representations showed as if Upamita and Kapila were standing each with a Liṅga on the head’, more plau sible, in want of any archaeological basis. 16 Apart from the names ending in īśvara, there is no evidence that the two objects installed were actually liṅgas. 

That iconic images of Siva were installed as main objects of worship in ´ temples of this period may not only follow from the great number of early iconic images of Siva (Maheśa) from Mathurā as described by Gerd Kreisel (Abb. 65– ´ 126), it may be illustrated also by an image commissioned by a Māheśvara for a Saiva temple in the first half of the fifth century, viz. the image installed by ´ 

13 Kreisel 1986, Abb. 126a–b. For the figure carrying a stick (Daṇḍapāṇi) at the bottom see below, p. 558 and Plate 126.

Plate 113 

Mansar: Caturbhuja Siva ´ 

Candragupta’s grandson, the Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II (Plate 113). This king refers to the deity in inscriptions as ‘Pravareśvara’. 17 As I have argued else where, there are reasons to assume that this beautiful, four-armed Siva image ´ discovered on a hillock called the Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī, 5 km due west of Ramtek Hill, in 1972, which to date embellishes the entrance hall of the National Museum in Delhi, represents this deity Pravareśvara. It may have been the main object 

17 CII V, 19 l. 13: pravareśvara-ṣadviṁśakavāṭaka, and op. cit. 65 l. 1: pravareśvaradeva kulasthāna. See also the sealing of Pravareśvara that came to light during the excavation of the Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī (MNS 3); above, pp. 373 f., Plate 75. 







of worship in the Vākāṭaka state sanctuary (vaijayikadharmasthāna) named after the king ‘Pravareśvaradevakulasthāna’ (TS 13), which was situated on this hillock, near the present-day village of Mansar. 18 

Though in recent years a wealth of Saiva sculptures have come to light ´ pertaining to the eastern Vākāṭaka kingdom, no liṅga has been found among them. 19 The Vākāṭaka kings were brahmins and the majority of them Māhe- śvaras, but their apparent reserve to patronize liṅga temples tallies with the Sanskrit texts of this period, in which liṅga worship is only reluctantly acknowl edged. 

Early Sanskrit sources of linga worship ˙ 

The Pāśupatasūtra and its commentary 

First of all, the authoritative text of the Pāśupata sect itself, the Sūtras and their commentary, do not mention liṅga worship with a single word. On the contrary, the commentator Kauṇḍinya describes a manifestation of Siva ( ´ mūrti) in iconic terms; his form (rūpa) is said to be characterized by the bull-banner etc.: 

‘Image’ (mūrti): Either this (yad etad) form (rūpa) that is perceived by him who is standing at the right side of God, his face turned north, in (His) proximity, a form that is characterised by the bull-banner, the lance in hand, Nandin, Mahākāla, erect phallus etc., or to which (yad vā) the laymen resort. 

The sanctuary is ‘of the Great God’ (mahādevasya). This is the answer (iti). There is the object to be worshipped. 20 

The Mahābhārata 

Though Rudra’s phallic aspect is recognized in MBh 10.17.21, 12.160.46, and 13.17.74, there are only a few passages in the Mahābhārata where liṅga worship as such is acknowledged, the oldest of which may be the verses in Droṇaparvan 172 and 173 (TS 3, 4 and 5), although these too are a matter of dispute. Discussing these passages Jacques Scheuer remarked, 

Hopkins consid`ere que la fin du Droṇaparvan est une addition tardive `a ce livre. D’ailleurs, tout ce qui se r´ef`ere au liṅga, ´ecrit-il encore, n’appartient pas aux 

18 Bakker 1997, 4 f., 87 f. 

19 Excavations in Mansar after the writing of the present article have shown me wrong. Although I still think that the Mansar Siva image in the National Museum has been ´ the main image of the temple complex unearthed at the Hiḍimbā T. ekḍī, this complex contained at least six minor liṅga shrines. In the immediate surroundings of this complex also at least two other liṅga sanctuaries have been found. See Bakker 2004a and Bakker 2008. 

20 Below, Textual Sources 10. This difficult passage deals with the concept of the Dakṣiṇā mūrti. It is the vision of the initiated Pāśupata at the right side of the object of worship. This does not preclude that the latter itself is an aniconic representation of Siva. This ´ will be the subject of further discussion below, pp. 516 f.

couches les plus anciennes de l’´epop´ee. Dans une “critical note” de l’´edition cri tique, ṢK. De rejette la “conjecture” de Hopkins: le passage n’est pas si r´ecent qu’il ne soit attest´e par les principales familles de manuscrits. Cela est ind´eniable. A notre point de vue, cependant, il est plus int´eressant de remarquer que le culte du liṅga ne semble jamais intervenir dans des passages se rattachant imm´ediate ment au mythe central. Qu’il suffise ici de noter ce clivage. Il serait sans doute pr´ematur´e d’en proposer une explicatioṇLa mention du culte du liṅga est rela tivement claire. Les relations de Kr̥ṣṇa et de Rudra le sont moins. 21 

The Mahābhārata passages at issue run (TS 3 and 4): 

Birth, karman, tapas, and yoga of these two (i.e. Nara and Nārāyaṇa) and of you (i.e. Aśvatthāman) are eminent; God has been adored by these two in the phallus (liṅga), by you in an image, during the various world-periods. He who adores the Lord in the liṅga, knowing Bhava to assume all forms, in him the disciplines concerning the self and the disciplines concerning learning are everlasting. For the gods and Siddhas and great seers, by worshipping in this way, strife to attain the highest in the world and the everlasting statioṇAnd this very Keśava (Kr̥ṣṇa) is a votary of Rudra, being born from Rudra; this Kr̥ṣṇa who is eternal is also to be worshipped with sacrifices. He who adores the Lord in the phallus, knowing Him to exist in all creatures, in him the One whose emblem is the bull (i.e. Siva) takes ´ an extraordinary delight. 

Because his phallus stands erect in perpetual celibacy and the people worship greatly (mahayanti), (therefore) is he known as the Great Lord (Maheśvara). Seers, gods, Gandharvas and Apsarases also have adored his phallus, and that one also stood erect. Therefore that Great Lord (Maheśvara) rejoices when his (phallus) is worshipped; Sam ´ . kara becomes happy and gratified and he is delighted. 

The latter text is with some minor variants found again in Anuśāsanaparvan 146.15-18 (TS 8), which may indicate that the Droṇaparvan passage belongs to an older stratum of the epic. An explicatory śloka, which is also found in the Droṇaparvan but in another context (MBh 7.173.94; TS 5), and which seems to echo MBh 7.172.87 and 90 (TS 3), has been inserted (MBh 13.146.16), somewhat disturbing the syntax, since the relative pronoun yo in 16a lacks a clear antecedent. 22 This verse unequivocally refers to the liṅga as a particular cult object distinct from an iconic image (vigraha). It says (TS 8 v. 16), 23 

One who worships the body (i.e. image) of the magnanimous one (i.e. Siva), or ´ otherwise his phallus (liṅga)—the constant worshipper of the phallus shall obtain great prosperity. 

The fourth, or, if we count the Droṇaparvan passage and its reprise in the Anuśāsanaparvan as one, third passage advocating liṅga worship is also found 

21 Scheuer 1982, 277. 

22 This also holds true for MBh 7.173.94. 

23 Cf. the Gr̥hyapariśiṣṭasūtras of Baudhāyana (3rd–4th centuries ad?), which say that if Siva is worshipped in an image there is an eye-opening rite, when in a ´ liṅga there is not (TS 11). Cf. ibid. II.17 (Harting 1922, 10 l. 23). 









in book thirteeṇOn the question of Sakra why he does not wish ´ prasāda from anybody but Siva, Upamanyu answers (TS 6 vv. 100–102), ´ 

What other reasons do you need, the Lord is the primary cause. It has not been revealed to us that the gods adore the phallus (liṅga) of anybody else; of whom else than Maheśvara is the phallus worshipped by all gods, or has ever been worshipped? Tell me if it has been revealed to you. Whose phallus Brahmā, Viṣṇu and you too with the gods should always adore, that one is the chiefest for that reason. 

The Rāmāyaṇa 

The Rāmāyaṇa confirms the impression obtained from the Mahābhārata: though a later tradition ascribes to Rāma the foundation of the Rāmeśvara liṅga, this is not found in the critical edition of the Adikāvya itself. ¯ 24 Liṅga worship is only ascribed to the Rākṣasas led by Rāvaṇa (TS 9), who worships with incense and fragrant flowers a golden liṅga, which he had installed on an altar of sand on the bank of the Narmadā River. ‘And after the worship he sung and danced, waving and spreading his hands’ (TS 9 v. 40). It may be significant that in the Mahābhārata passages great emphasis is laid on the fact that gods and other divine beings also worship Siva’s ´ liṅga,25 which sounds like a sort of justification, whereas the Rāmāyaṇa confines liṅga worship to Rākṣasas in a tone of scarcely concealed dismay. 

Concluding observations 

The overall impression that we may gather from the material surveyed is that, during the first centuries of the Common Era, the brahmanical elite, whether priest, king or renouncer, preferred to venerate Maheśvara in iconic form and frowned upon liṅga worship. 26 Its gradual acceptance in the 5th and 6th cen turies by those circles that earlier rejected it may be illustrated again by the myth of Tilottamā. 

The evidence of the Skandapurāṇa 

This myth recurs in what we think is the original Skandapurāṇa, which we date in the sixth or seventh century, and which may have been composed in Pāśupata circles. 27 Here explicit reference is made to Siva in his ´ liṅga form (TS 14): ‘There arose amidst these celestials a liṅga, solid, massive, a bundle of tejas as it were.’ From this liṅga four faces emerged when Tilottamā made her circumambulation, the eastern one lustrous, with lips gracious as the bimba

fruit (prasannabimbauṣṭha) and with three eyes (tryakṣa) (TS 15 vv. 16–17); the southern one ‘possessed of the colour of a languid cloud laden with water, having a ferocious voice, with dreadful teeth shining (in an open mouth), and the corners of the eyes bloodshot and glittering’ (v. 19); the western face was perfect (anuttama) having three eyes, and the northern one was very full (su saṁpūrṇa) and very gracious (suprasanna) (vv. 21–24). Thus runs the oldest description of the Caturmukhaliṅga in the Sanskrit literature known to me, at least half a millennium after the Indian sculptors had begun to materialize the idea in stone (see also below, p. 521). 

Conclusions 

The various sources surveyed above lead to the following conclusions. 

1 The historic reality of ancient Siva worship, which is taken here as a spec- ´ imen of a wider issue, cannot be reconstructed by relying on one type of source only. If we would base ourselves on texts alone, we would hardly be aware that liṅga worship was practised on a large scale throughout the Subcontinent during the first centuries of the Common Era. If, on the other hand, we would not have texts, we would be at a loss how to interprete the phallic stones provided with four heads of different countenances. 

2 When the visual material is interpreted with the help of written sources it is of paramount importance that both sources date from about the same time. More often than not art-historians describe their visual material on the basis of textual material that dates from half a millennium later, such as when early sculptures are explained by having recourse to the iconographic treatise of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa or still later texts, while, as we have seen, contemporaneous descriptions are sometimes to be found in, for instance, the Mahābhārata. 

3 The incongruity that is frequently found between the archaeological material and textual descriptions may have its root in the different sections of the society to which these sources pertaiṇThis makes us realize how tentative our assessments are and how little we actually know about the early history of the religions of India. 

4 If these three conclusions are accepted it follows finally that, in view of the scarcity of sources at our disposal, we simply cannot afford to disregard any of them. When, however, we evaluate them and try to construe an integral picture of the past, we should never lose sight of their innate differences and we must proceed with the utmost caution, in the knowledge that the complexity of the historic reality of ancient India is far greater than we can ever hope to recover.
