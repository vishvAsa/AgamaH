  <p>Studies in the Skandapurāṇa IX</p>
<p>The tradition of the four pupils of Lagud ¯ .i</p>
<p>By the middle of the sixth century the city of Kanauj seems to have emerged as the capital of the rising dynasty of the Maukharis under its king Īśānavarman. 1 This town, in the Sanskrit tradition named Kānyakubja/ Kanyakubja, is known from the Skandapurāṇa, and from this text only, as the seat of one of the Pāśupata lineages.</p>
<p>The Skandapurāṇa (SPS 167.123–29) informs us that the fourth pupil of Lāguḍi was a brahmacārin who came from a distinguished family in the (Land of the) Kurus. 2 He received initiation in Kanyakubja and, as implied by SPS 167.130, established the fourth lineage of Pāśupata teachers there. Lāguḍi bestowed on him (and the other three pupils) ‘His own doctrine’ (and) yoga.3</p>
<p>∗ The first version of this article was published in Journal of Indological Studies 19 (2007), 1–16.</p>
<p>1 As far as I am aware, there exists no direct evidence for this statement. There is circumstantial evidence, though, which has led the majority of historians to accept it as the most plausible hypothesis. Tripathi 1964, 32–36; Majumdar in HCI III, 69 f.; Goyal 1967, 363; Thaplyal 1985, 19 f. Among this evidence is the clay seal-matrix, probably to be ascribed to Avantivarman, that was found in Kanauj (Thaplyal 1985, 153). The major argument for Kanauj being the Maukhari capital, at least at the time of Grahavarman, is based on the evidence of Bāṇa’s Harṣacarita (see Tripathi 1964, 32–36).</p>
<p>2 We deduce from this evidence that the name of the fourth pupil was unknown to the composer of the SP, but that there was a living tradition that connected him with the Kurus or Kurukṣetra. In order to supply a name for the founder of this lineage, this tradition later invented the name Kauruṣya (LiP 1.7.51, 1.24.131, SiP´ Satarudrasam ´ . hitā 5.49) or Kauruṣa (see above, n. 16 on p. 287).</p>

<li>The reading of SPS 167.123d is uncertaiṇThe syllables ku-ru are relatively certain as they are attested in all manuscripts: both SPS mss (S1and S2) and all SPRA mss (R before</li>
</ul>
<p>527</p>
<p>The route along which the Pāśupata movement had reached the Land of the Kurus may also be deduced from the Skandapurāṇa: 1) Kārohaṇa (where Siva’s ´ incarnation took place), 2) Ujjayanī (initiation of Kauśika), 3) Jambumārga between Ujjayanī and Puṣkara (initiation of Gārgya), 4) Mathurā (initiation of Mitra), 5) Land of the Kurus, 6) Kanyakubja (initiation of the Kuru). 4</p>
<p>The major city in the ‘Land of the Kurus’ in the 5th and 6th centuries was Thanesar. In his Harṣacarita Bāṇa depicts Thanesar (Sthāṇvīśvara) under (the legendary) King Puṣyabhūti as a country completely devoted to Maheśvara. 5 It is therefore not impossible, at least it is suggested by the Skandapurāṇa, that the Pāśupata movement had reached Kanauj from Gujarat via Kurukṣetra and had thus passed through Thanesar.</p>

<p>correction). The S mss read the corrupt ◦ṣvava instead of ◦ṣveva, but the latter reading is supported by all A mss. The latter mss read sa gotrajaḥinstead of sugotrajah.. ** In 129d S1 reads lāguḍiḥ: S2 lākulī.</p>
<p>‘And’ (SPS 167.129d) Lāgudi declares:</p>
<p>rahasyaṁparamaṁhīdaṁpañcārtha iti saṁjñitam |</p>
<p>viprān mocayituṁdatto yuṣmabhyaṁmartyabandhanāt |</p>
<p>anayā dīkṣayā viprān prāpayadhvaṁparaṁpadam k 130 k</p>
<p>SPS 167.130 thus defines the svasiddhānta doctrine as ‘Pañcārtha’ and explicitly declares that these four pupils have the right to initiate, i.e. that they are established as the founders of four lineages.</p>
<p>4 Above, n. 3 on p. 527. For a discussion of this route see below, p. 563.</p>
<p>5 HC* p. 164 gr̥he gr̥he bhagavān apūjyata khaṇḍaparaśuḥ| A seal reading ‘śrīrudrah.’ in ‘first-second century characters’ was reportedly found in the Kushana layers of the so-called Harṣa kā T.īlā in Thanesar (IAR 1987–88, 29).</p>
<p>27 / Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa 529</p>
<p>Some information about this ‘Kuru lineage’ seems to have survived the ages. The (Jaina) tradition—preserved in Guṇaratna’s (fourteenth century) commentary on the S. aḍdarśanasamuccaya of Haribhadra (ninth century) and Rājaśekharasūri’s S. aḍdarśanasamuccaya (fourteenth century)—records the first four names of the teachers in each of the four lineages that are said to derive from Lakulīśa. The fourth teacher, here named Kauruṣa, was succeeded by Manuṣyaka, Puṣpaka and Rāśīkara. 6</p>
<p>Lāguḍi</p>
<p>The idea of a guru with four pupils named Lāguḍi/Lākulin or Lakulīśa seems to be an example of ‘invention of tradition’. Kauṇḍinya does not know a teacher (incarnation) by the name of Lakulīśa, but speaks only about the Lord (bhaga vat) descending in Kāyāvataraṇa (= Kārohaṇa), who initiated only one pupil, Kuśika, in the city of Ujjayanī. 7 Nor does the name Lakulīśa, or any of its vari ants, occur in the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61. 8 It may have been coined in the fifth century to refer to the (divine) teacher who carried a club (laguḍa), portrayed in several fifth-century images, and as such came to be attested in the Skandapurāṇa.9</p>
<p>The apparently oldest image of an ithyphallic Saiva teacher with a ´ lakula resting against his left shoulder is accompanied by only two pupils and may date from the 5th century (Plate 118). 10</p>

<p>For an elaborate discussion of this paraṁparā see Bisschop 2006, 48 ff. The commentator of the Pāśupatasūtra, Kauṇḍinya ad PS 4.10, apparently placed himself in the lineage of Kuśika and Īśāna: kuśikeśānasambandhāt. No doubt the lineage of Kuśika is the oldest Pāśupata tradition (Indraji 1881–82, 322 f., 327; Sircar: SI I, 278), a fact corroborated by the Skandapurāṇa itself (see above, n. 3 on p. 527).</p>

The image (below, Plate 121) of a (non-ithyphallic) Saiva ascetic holding a staff or club in his right hand and vessel ( ´ kalaśa) in his left, dating from the Kuṣāṇa period and preserved in the Mathura Museum, may be ‘a prototype of the figure of Lakulīśa’ (Shah 1984, 97, Pl. 80).</p>
<p>Plate 118</p>
<p>Mathurā: Lakulīśa with two pupils</p>
<p>In the first half of the 6th century images of Lakulīśa surrounded by four pupils began to appear, such as the one in the Yogeśvarī Cave near Bombay (below, Plate 128). 11</p>
<p>In short, at some stage in the process by which the Pāśupata movement was gathering momentum, the avatāra of Siva/Paśupati received the name ´ Lāguḍi/Lākulin/Lakulīśa. It became an article of faith common to various traditions, on the one hand serving to account for the spread of several guru lineages that claimed to go back to Siva’s incarnation and, on the other hand, ´ uniting these into one coherent religious movement.</p>
<p>The Kuru lineage</p>
<p>Puṣpaka in the Kuru (Kauruṣa) lineage evokes the name of the (alleged) founder of the Paśupatinātha Temple in Nepal, Supuṣpa. 12 It may also remind one of</p>
<p>11 Shah 1984, 98, Pl. 88.</p>
<p>12 The foundation of this temple is credited to a (legendary) king of the Licchavi dynasty, named Supuṣpadeva in the (corrupt) Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī (ff. 19v–20r):</p>
<p>rājā śrīsupuṣpadeva varṣa 76 k tena hi nepālabhūmiś cāturvarṇakr̥tā k śrīpaśupati bhaṭārakasya devālaya kr̥taṁsaṅkhalīsaṁchādanam k tata sundarīṇirmitanagaram sakalarājyamarjjādā kr̥tyaḥnyāyena prajāḥsamasta pratipālitāniḥsvasvasvakīyena bhumi ˘ ˘ saṁtha ˘ ˘ vyavahāra pravartate k</p>
<p>This Supuṣpa is also known from the genealogy of King Jayadeva, the same who recorded the name of his maternal grandfather, the Maukhari prince Bhogavarman (see below, p. 538): tasmāl licchavitaḥpareṇa nr̥patīn hitvā parān dvādaśa śrīmān puṣpaśarākr̥tiḥkṣitipatir jātaḥsupuṣpas tataḥ| (Verma &amp; Singh 1994, 238). According to Slusser 1982, 227 this king is ‘alternately known as Paśuprekha (he who has seen Paśupati)’. A later (equally legendary) Licchavi king, Supuṣpavarman, is said in the Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī to have renovated the temple of Paśupati:</p>
<p>27 / Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa 531</p>
<p>Puṣyabhūti, a name spelled in some mss as Puṣpabhūti, the legendary founder of the dynasty of Thanesar to which King Harṣavardhana belonged. 13 Puṣyabhūti is depicted in the Harṣacarita 3 (pp. 49–55) as being deeply involved in a Saiva ritual of black magic (Vetālasādhana) in the cremation ´ ground (Mahāśmaśāna), under the guidance of a Mahāśaiva preceptor (bhu vanaguru) hailing from the South (dākṣiṇātya), Bhairavācārya. 14 In this ritual the deity (vāstunāga) of the land (janapada) Srīkan ´ .ṭha, in which Sthāṇvīśvara (Puṣyabhūti’s capital) is situated, 15 the Nāga Srīkan ´ .ṭha is conjured up by the ācārya;16 he is forced into submission by the king, who is about to kill him with the magic sword Aṭṭahāsa, a gift of Bhairavācārya. Then, when the king is prepared to let him go because of his brahminhood, a goddess dressed in white, evidently Lakṣmī (Rājyaśrī), 17 emerges from the sword, annoints the king and grants Puṣyabhūti to become the founder of a mighty dynasty. This dynasty is therefore believed to have acquired its legitimicy and authority over the land of Kurukṣetra thanks to the magic of the Saiva preceptor. ´ 18</p>
<p>The fourth teacher in the Kuru (Kauruṣa) lineage, Rāśīkara, is known from the Ratnaṭīkā (9th century?). 19 It would seem a plausible hypothesis to</p>
<p>rājā śrīsupuṣpavarmā varṣa 56, tena nepālabhūmi dharmeṇa vr̥dhikr̥tam k puna śrī paśubhaṭārikasya devālaye atisundara ṇirmitam k (ibiḍf. 20v) The first firm evidence of Pāśupata presence in Nepal comes from the reign of King Jiṣṇugupta (ad 624–632 ). It is found in the Paśupatinātha Temple in a shrine called Chatracaṇḍeśvara, in which the pillar next to the image of Chatracaṇḍeśvara is engraved with an inscription, which records a donation by a (Pāśupata) teacher (ācārya) called Bhagavat Pranardanaprāṇa Kauśika (Verma &amp; Singh 1994, no. 119). The donation was made to some ascetics of the muṇḍaśr̥ṅkhalikapāśupatācāryaparṣad (the assembly of Pāśupata teachers belonging to the Muṇḍa–Sr ´.ṅkhalikas). See Bakker 2014, 149 f. The ācārya Bhagavat Pranardana informs us in another inscription on the pedestal of the same image that he is varṇāśramodvāsita, i.e. living outside the varṇāśrama confines of society (Verma &amp; Singh 1994, no. 120). The Licchavi inscriptions further provide information about the Sr ´.ṅkhalika-Pāśupatas who care for the sick (Verma &amp; Singh 1994, no. 132), and Pāśupata ācāryas (Verma &amp; Singh 1994, no. 147 l. 8), for whom see below, n. 44 on p. 539.</p>
<p>13 The Nalanda Clay Seal of Harṣa describes Harṣa as: paramamāheśvaraḥmaheśvara iva sarvasattvānukampakaḥparamabhaṭṭārakamahārājādhirājaśrīharṣah. (Thaplyal 1985, 186). The report on the excavations of the Harṣa kā T.īlā at Thanesar informs us that the ‘Pushyabhuti or Vardhana period (middle of the sixth to end of seventh entury) was distinguished by a massive brick building and other structural remains’ (IAR 1987–99, 29; see Plate 117).</p>
<p>14 Bāṇa gives a flowery description of this teacher (HC* 3, pp. 169–73). See also Bakker 2014, 78.</p>
<p>15 The Gaüḍavaho refers to Srīkan ´ . ṭha, as Siriäṁṭha (v. 484). Vākpatirāja describes it as the site where Janamejaya’s serpent sacrifice took place (vv. 472–484). Verse 485 makes it clear that Kurukṣetra is meant.</p>
<p>16 The Nāga or goblin/deity (vetāla), whose submission is sought, is evoked by the japa of the Mahāmantra named ‘Mahākālahr̥daya’ (HC* 3, pp. 178, 184 ff.).</p>

<p>connect the branch of Pāśupata teachers with names ending in ◦rāśi to this Rāśīkara, and it might perhaps be not too far-fetched to imagine that, by the time that the SP was composed, Kanauj/Kanyakubja possessed a Pāśupata Maṭha of the Rāśi branch, which derived its authority from a paramparā that was conceived of as going straight back to Lakulīśa through the guru who came from Kurukṣetra. 20</p>
<p>Rāśi ascetics and ‘His own doctrine’</p>
<p>Rāśi ascetics are known from inscriptions to have been living in various places. The first epigraphical attestation (c. ad 600) is that of an ascetic called Udbha varāśi, said to be a Rudra, in an inscription from the Gandharveśvara Tem ple in Sirpur (Srīpura) of the time of King Mahāśivagupta Bālārjuna, who ´ ruled from c. ad 590 to 650. 21 This Udbhavarāśi Rudra, called ‘an ocean for the streams of his own doctrine’, might have reached Dakṣiṇa Kosala in the train of Bālārjuna’s mother Vāsaṭā, who was a Maukhari princess, daughter of Sūryavarman, and who had come from Kanyakubja to Srīpura as the wife of ´ the Pāṇḍuvaṁśi prince Harṣagupta in the last quarter of the sixth century. 22</p>
<p>rāśīkarāntāṁś ca tīrthakarān anukrameṇa yathāvad bhaktyā namaskuryāt tad anu pra dakṣiṇam ekam iti | 20 The Skandapurāṇa (SPBh 162.45) refers to Siva as ´ rāśividāṁvaraḥ, ‘Best of the As trologers’, or a reference to the Rāśi ascetics? In this connection attention should be drawn to a passage in the Skandapurāṇa, SP 32.103–110. It tells us that the gods out of fear for Kālakarṇī, a personification of death, dive into a heap (rāśi) of ashes (bha sman), due to which they become Pāśupatas and enjoy the protection of Siva. Could ´ this myth reflect the initiation rite in which the novice takes his first bath in a heap of ashes (bhasmarāśi) and receives a sectarian name ending in rāśi? (this was suggested to me by Peter Bisschop).</p>
<p>21 EI XXXIX, 151, v. 3 (metre Indravajrā):</p>
<p>śrīmān svasiddhāntadhunīpayo , paprabhodbhāsitaśuddhabhūtiḥ|</p>
<p>atrābhavad vāgamr̥tena lokān, yas t[oṣa]yaty udbhavarāśirudraḥk 3 k</p>
<p>3ab conieci: ◦payodhis, tāpa◦.</p>
<p>There (i.e. in Srīpura) arose Udbhavarāśi, a Rudra, the one who is an ocean for the ´ streams of his own doctrine, whose pure splendour/ash was illuminated by the light of his asceticism, and who satisfies the people with the nectar of his speech.</p>
<p>I take ‘Rudra’ as a title, which, on the one hand, may be connected to the doctrine, attested in the Malhar (Junvānī) Plates of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57 (l. 15; above, p. 290), which acknowledges a lineage of sixty-six Rudras (embodiments on earth of Gahaneśa, the Rudra who, in Saiva cosmology, reigns the ‘net of bonds’ ( ´ pāśajāla)), on the other hand, with a development within the Pāśupata fold of a Bhairava tradition, to which the ‘Rudra’ teachers in particular belong (see above, p. 292, and below, n. 22 on p. 532).</p>
<p>22 Bakker 1994b, 14 ff. (above, p. 252 f.). Another early attestation of a Rāśi ascetic is found in the Indragarh Stone Inscription of VS 767 (ad 710/11) found in the Mandasor District, which records the erection of a Siva temple, Guheśvara, by a Pāśupata named ´ Dānarāśi. He is said to be a disciple of the Pāśupata ācārya Vinītarāśi, the foremost of the Rudra Sr ´.ṅkhalikas (rudraśr̥ṅkhalikāgraṇīh. ) (JBRS XLI (1955), 260 vv. 5–7). To mention one more instance of Rāśi ascetics in the kingdom of Kanauj, we may refer to the stone inscription found in Sirsa (Haryana) of the time of the Pratīhāra king of Kanauj, Bhojadeva (middle of the ninth century), which features the name of Ratnarāśi: ratnarāśis tapomayapāśupatāgraṇīś ca (EI XXI, 295 l. 4).</p>
<p>27 / Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa 533</p>
<p>Although, admittedly, ‘his own doctrine’ (svasiddhānta) would normally be taken to mean ‘the doctrine of/adhered to by Udbhavarāśi’, it may be signif icant to note that SPS 167.129–30 refers to the Pañcārtha doctrine imparted by Lāguḍi to his disciples as ‘His own doctrine’: svasiddhānta (above, n. 3 on p. 527). Possibly the phrase ‘his own doctrine’ within this lineage was a shib boleth, a denomination signifying ‘His own doctrine’, thereby claiming that the doctrine was the only true one, revealed directly by Lord Lāguḍi himself. The phrase ‘an ocean for the streams of his own doctrine’ makes sense, if the ‘ocean’, i.e. the ascetic, is conceived a receptacle of the streams that make up the Pāśupata/Pañcārtha traditioṇWe will come across another Pāśupata ascetic who was devoted to ‘his own doctrine’ below, (p. 539).</p>
<p>The Skandapurana and the P ¯ āśupata movement</p>
<p>Vārāṇasī</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Skandapurāṇa is an important source for reconstructing the history of the Pāśupata movement, a text composed during the second half of the 6th and first half of the 7th century. 23 The holy town of Vārāṇasī plays an important role in this text and its Vārāṇasīmāhātmya shows detailed knowledge of the local situatioṇIt is the only holy place that is eulogized in much detail and at great length. 24 The Māhātmya describes a kṣetra that seems to correlate with the historic situation in the late Gupta and early medieval period. The sanctuary of Avimukteśvara takes centre stage. Around it are said to be twelve liṅgas of lesser importance (above, p. 471; Figure 12), none of which is known from seals.</p>
<p>The Skandapurāṇa testifies to the establishment of a Pāśupata community of ascetics and ācāryas in Vārāṇasī, who may well have been in charge of most of the sanctuaries described in the text. Being united in the kingdom of Kanauj by the time the SP was composed, 25 the Vārāṇasī Pāśupatas entertained probably manifold relations with their brethren in Kanyakubja. This sectarian affilia tion may partly explain why, with the exception of Avimukteśvara, the tīrthas mentioned in the SP do not feature in other sources, before their inclusion in the Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa of Lakṣmīdhara who, by quoting the Skandapurāṇa,</p>
<p>23 Above, pp. 185 ff., p. 469. See also Bakker 2014, 137f.</p>
<p>24 See Introduction to SP II A.</p>
<p>25 Being so near to their homeland in Baghelkhand, Vārāṇasī may have been part of the Maukhari territories from the moment that these kings began to assert themselves in the Ga˙ngā Valley, that is during the course of the first half of the 6th century. The three inscriptions of the Maukhari kings were found within a circle of 220 km around Vārāṇasī: in Shankarpur, 200 km SW (Harivarman), Jaunpur, 52 km NW (ascribed to Īśvaravarman, but probably of Īśānavarman or one of his successors), Haraha, 220 km NW (Sūryavarman/Īśānavarman).</p>
<p>canonized them, so to speak. 26 The spread of the Pāśupata order itself towards the east, to Vārāṇasī and Magadhā, may have taken off from Kanyakubja earlier, during the period when North India was united in the Gupta kingdom.</p>
<p>In view of the learned tradition of the town, duly observed, for instance, by Xuanzang, it has a certain probability per se that the Skandapurāṇa was composed either in Vārāṇasī, or in a (Pāśupata) centre that had close contacts with this city. If the above dating is correct, the text was composed under the rule of either the Maukharis or Harṣavardhana of Kanauj (see below, pp. 601 ff.).</p>
<p>The Māhātmya of Sthāneśvara</p>
<p>The historic relations between the Pāśupatas of Vārāṇasī and those in Kanauj and Thanesar at the time of its composition also seem to emerge from the Skan dapurāṇa itself. It might be significant in this respect that—after a brief inter mezzo (SP 31.15–47) in which Siva makes Mount Mandara his House (named ´ Vr̥ṣan) and the question arises why, after having first made Yajña in the form of a cloud his vehicle, he has exchanged him for Vr̥ṣa, the bull (which again is a prelude to the myth of the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice told in SP 32)— the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya is followed by a section (SP 31.48–115) that tells the mythology related to and the Māhātmya of Sthāneśvara. 27</p>
<p>This mythology relates that the Saiva sage Dadhīca (son of Cyavana, grand- ´ son of Bhr̥gu), whose āśrama is on the Sarasvatī River, defeats his Vaiṣṇava rival Kṣupa with Siva’s help. ´ 28 To commemorate this victory the site (sthāna) named ‘Sthāneśvara’ is established, one krośa in circumference, full of flowers (puṣpa) and creepers. 29 It is evident that the foundation myth of Sthāneśvara, i.e. Thanesar, is told.</p>
<p>26 TVK pp. 130–135. An exception is Svarlīna, which had passed into the hands of ācāryas of the Saivasiddhānta, at least by the 12th century. One of its incumbents left us an ´ inscription (the National Museum Kathamandhu Stone Inscription of NS 264 (ad 1144), edited in Acharya 1997), in which an Acārya Rudraśiva reports, among other things, ¯ that he initiated several princes in Nepal. See SP II A, 72 ff., SP 29.28. The modern Svarlīneśvara Mandir is situated at Prahlāda Ghāṭin the north of Benares (A 11/29).</p>
<p>27 This Māhātmya is intricately positioned between the prelude to the Dakṣa myth (SP 31.15–47) and this myth itself (SP 32); see SP II B, 27. It provides the cause (kāraṇa, SP 31.49) of Siva’s victory over all the gods in the Daks ´ .a myth. This cause is the boon asked by Dadhīca after his victory over the Vaiṣṇava Kṣupa: bhagavan yadi tuṣṭo ’si yadi deyo varaś ca me | icchāmi viṣṇunā sārdhaṁsarvān devāṁs tvayā jitān k 31.101 k</p>
<p>28 The fight (vaira) between Dadhīca and Kṣupa, who argue about the superiority of either the brahman or the kṣatra principle, resembles in many respects that between Vasiṣṭha and Vis´vāmitra, whose āśramas are also said to be in Sthāṇutīrtha (MBh 9.41.4). MBh 3.81.163–64 locates Dadhīca’s āśrama in Kurukṣetra, where also the Sthāṇuvaṭa is said to be (MBh 3.81.54).</p>

<p>SP I (p. 26), one of the few direct</p>
<p>borrowings from the Mahābhārata by</p>
<p>the Skandapurāṇa is this description</p>

<p>Bāṇa’s relationship with Dadhīca, the founder of Sthāneśvara</p>
<p>The Māhātmya in the Skandapurāṇa thus reformulates the significance of Sthāṇutīrtha and adds to its glory the newly established site Sthāneśvara. In his Harṣacarita Bāṇa ingeniously adapted this mythological complex by linking his own descent to Dadhīca, when he made the latter’s son (by his divine wife Sarasvatī), viz. Sārasvata, the foster brother of another scion of the Bhārgava lineage, namely Vatsa; Vatsa again is the ancestor of the Vātsyāyanas to whom the author of the Harṣacarita belongs on his own account (see Figure 13). When he embroidered on the story of Dadhīca’s mother Sukanyā, told in Mahābhārata 3.121–25, Bāṇa and his audience may have been aware of the mythology that attributed the foundation of Harṣa’s native city Thanesar to Dadhīca as told in the Skandapurāṇa.33 It may actually have been the very reason why he gave</p>

<p>34 The pedigree constructed by Bāṇa not only links the Vātsyāyanas to the collateral Bhārgava branch of Dadhīca, it seems also to have a geo-political dimension in that it connects two regions: the one along the Sarasvatī and the one along the Son ´ . a River. The Puṣyabhūtis belonged to the former area, the Maukharis to the latter. Bāṇa’s hero Harṣa united both regions within his kingdom. Cf. HC* 4 (p. 244), where the wise brahmin Gambhīra says to Harṣa’s brother-in-law Grahavarman, when the latter is about to enter the house of his bride Rājyaśrī:</p>

<p>The Skandapuraṉ .a reaches Nepal</p>
<p>It has been argued by Yokochi in the Introduction to SP III, taken up in Bakker 2014, 137 f., that a major new redaction of our text, the ancestor of the RA recension, came into being in the ninth century. 35</p>
<p>It is likely that before this major new redaction took place the Skanda purāṇa had reached Nepal, where it became our S recensioṇThis so-called S or ‘Nepalese recension’ has a few particularities of its owṇThe end of chapter 167 in this recension features two remarkable passages in what is in all probability an accretion to the original text (SPS 167.163–187), two passages that may betray the background against which this recension S came into being: in one it is said that there are eight places in the country of Magadhā where Laguḍīśvara (Lakulīśa) roamed about together with his pupils (cf. below, p. 564), and in the other, at the end of this interpolation, Paśupati in Nepāla is mentioned together with another sanctuary called Naikatuṅgādhipeśvara, which calls forth associations with the king of Nepal, the lord supreme of many mountain peaks/thrones. 36 Could it be that there is a nexus that links both additions to the original text?</p>
<p>It has been argued by Yokochi that this interpolation in what would even tually develop into our ‘Nepalese recension’ was made ‘in an early text of the S recension in northeastern India before it bifurcated and came to be transmitted to Nepal’. 37 Since the earliest transmission to Nepal relates to an ancestor of our ms S1, this transmission must, according to Yokochi’s theory, have taken place before ad 700. 38</p>
<p>We know of a formal exchange between North India and Nepal in the decades before ad 700, namely when the grand-daughter (dauhitrī) of the Later–Gupta</p>
<p>35 As noted in Bakker 2014, 138 n. 425 this is ‘a slight modification of the date proposed for this redaction in the Introduction to SP II A, p. 54, where we had argued that it may have taken place in the eighth, possibly first half of the ninth century’. The earlier date featured also in the original version of the present article, published in 2007.</p>

<p>See Bisschop 2006, 15–17, 222 f. Bisschop 2006, 218 observes about this interpola tion: ‘Although the list starts with places in the northwest, the number of toponyms in the northeast is striking’, e.g. Gr̥dhrakūṭeśvara and Pāṭalīputra in Magadhā, where the Prahasiteśvara liṅga is mentioned (SPS 167.166–169). The same Prahasiteśvara is apparently mentioned in a Khmer inscription (Sanderson 2003–04, 408).</p>
<p>37 Yokochi in SP III, 52. The ‘bifurcation’ refers to the ancestors of our mss S1 and S2. 38 Yokochi in SP III, 57 f. Cf. Bakker 2014, 138.</p>
<p>king Adityasena of Magadhā (3rd quarter 7th cent.), Vatsadevī, married the ¯ Licchavi king of Nepal, Sivadeva II, father of Jayadeva. This Jayadeva and ´ his Indian mother recorded this fact in their Paśupati Temple Inscription, [Aṁśuvarman] Saṁvat 157 (ad 732). 39</p>
<p>Vatsadevī was the daughter of a Maukhari prince, called Bhogavarman (see Figure 14). 40 The inscription, ipso facto, proves that the family of the Mau kharis outlived the reign of Harṣa, in one way or the other. If our conjecture above is right and the composition of the SP was begun under the Maukharis of Kanauj, it is conceivable that the princess, or someone in her entourage, took this text to Nepal as part of the Maukhari heirloom. And her Magadhā background was also not forgotten, as the interpolation shows.</p>

<p>39 IA IX, 178 ff. Indraji &amp; Bühler read 153 ( = ad 728); Verma &amp; Singh 1994, 238 f. (see ibiḍpp. xlix f.). Verse 13 (Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita):</p>

<p>40 This Bhogavarman cannot be the same as the son of Sūrasena and nephew of the Mahā- ´ sāmanta Aṁśuvarman, who is mentioned in the Deopāṭana Inscription, Saṁvat 39 (ad 615); Verma &amp; Singh 1994, 140.</p>
<p>27 / Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa 539</p>
<p>The Later Guptas of Magadhā, from whose family the princess stemmed, were well familiar with the Pāśupata tradition. 41 This follows from an inscrip tion of the time of another grandchild of Adityasena (Vatsadevī’s cousin), the ¯ Later–Gupta king Viṣṇugupta. In this inscription we are told that the pilgrim Avimuktajja (Skt. Avimuktārya), 42 who had visited numerous Saiva holy places ´ inhabited by Siddhas (anekaśivasiddhāyatana◦), was devoted to ‘his own doc trine’ (svasiddhāntābhirata). 43 It is therefore possible, even likely, that one or more Pāśupata teachers from Magadhā had traveled to Nepal, some of whom may have reached it in the company of the Later–Gupta princess. 44</p>
<p>When the Skandapurāṇa text was thus brought to Nepal, it had undergone the two additions quoted above, (n. 36 on p. 537 f.) as part of a wider inter polation, in order to make good for what were, in the eyes of its conveyers and receivers, two neglected issues: the authenticity of the Pāśupata tradition within Magadhā, now said to have been founded by Lakulīśa himself, and the prominence of the holy state sanctuary of Nepal, Paśupatinātha.</p>
<p>Matrimonial alliances and the spread of culture</p>
<p>Historians are used to judge royal matrimonial alliances by their political im plications. If our reconstruction holds any water, the cultural implications may also have been significant and may have had a more lasting effect than the po litical ones. Next to their husbands, princesses on their way to the residences of their grooms were accompanied by a cort`ege of ladies-in-waiting and dignitaries of all sorts. Among these there may have been religious virtuosi and literati, who, in the train of the two newlywed queens, Vāsaṭā and Vatsadevī, brought the Pāśupata order to Dakṣiṇa Kosala and the Skandapurāṇa to Nepal.</p>
<p>41 A post-Gupta Lakulīśa image was found in Benisagar, southeastern Bihar (Panigrahi 1956, 3). Other Lakulīśa images in Bihar are reported in Mitra 1984, 116, n. 16.</p>

<p>43 EI XXVI, 246; Thaplyal 1985, 168. Cf. above, n. 3 on p. 527.</p>
<p>44 Vatsadevī’s Nepalese husband, King Sivadeva, is known from the ´ Laganaṭola Inscription (ad 694/95) to have himself patronized the ācāryas of the Pāśupata order, since he handed over to the Pāśupata ācāryas the village of Vaidya as an agrahāra settlement for the maintenance of the temple (devakula) of Sivadeveśvara Bhat ´ .ṭāraka, which the king had built himself. Verma &amp; Singh 1994, no. 147, ll. 5–9:</p>
