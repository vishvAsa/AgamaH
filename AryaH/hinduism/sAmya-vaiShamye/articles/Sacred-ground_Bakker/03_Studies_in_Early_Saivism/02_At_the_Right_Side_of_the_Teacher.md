Imagination, Imagery, and Image in Vedic and Saiva Initiation ´ 

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, 

Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom 

prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 

Matthew 25: 34 (cf. Ecclesiastes 10: 2) 

Introduction 

The transformation of the Vedic religion into new systems of belief and prac tice, early Hinduism for short, is a process of cultural change that, despite two centuries of research, has only partly been understood. The replacement of the sacrificial fire by images of wood and stone is among the most obvious innovations. As has been convincingly argued by Phyllis Granoff (2006), this in novation was only reluctantly accepted in some circles of brahmanic orthodoxy. On the other hand, there can be little doubt that Vedic imagination informed the concept of God and His image (mūrti) in the newly emerging religions. It found expression in the Sanskrit texts of early Hinduism. The confrontation of this textual evidence with the material images of the archaeologist is often perplexing, however. 

An example of such a conundrum is the so-called Dakṣiṇāmūrti, mentioned in the Pāśupata texts, the Mahābhārata, and the later Saiva literature of the ´ Mantramārga. In this essay, we will examine the Vedic origins of the imagery of the Dakṣiṇāmūrti. This mūrti appears first and foremost to be an ideal image embedded in the ritual of initiatioṇThe Vedic upanayana ceremony laid the structural foundations for the initiation rites of the later religious orders. The Dakṣiṇāmūrti appears to be a token of the theistic transformation of the Vedic imaginatioṇIt illustrates how literate Saiva brahmins took the Hinduistic ´ turṇAt first material images played, if at all, only a secondary role in this transformatioṇHowever, in a religious world that was increasingly pervaded by material images of the divine, it was bound to happen that the visionary

image became an archetype of visual representation, the Dakṣiṇāmūrti as an iconographic category. In this process, an essential characteristic of the vision of God as revealer was reinterpreted: His right side became interpreted as His southern face. The incongruity of this representation with the age-old religious idea of the south as being terrifying, inauspicious, 1 was to make a conundrum. 

The sitting position of teacher and pupil in the Vedic Upanayana ritual 

The Satapathabrāhman ´ . a 

The Satapathabrāhman ´ . a 11.5.4 is our earliest source for the ancient upanayana ritual; a brief summery may highlight its major features. 

1 The pupil approaches a teacher and expresses the wish for apprenticeship by saying: I have come for brahmacarya (brahmacaryam āgām). He commits himself to be a brahmacārin. 

2 The teacher (ācārya) asks his name. The question implies the answer: ‘who’ (ka) conceived as another name of Prajāpati. 

3 The teacher takes the pupil by the hand, implying that he accepts him as a student, saying indrasya brahmacāry asy, agnir ācāryas tavāham ācāryas tavāsāv iti. Thus the ācārya and Agni are seen as homologous. 

4 He consigns the student to Prajāpati and Savitr̥and to all beings in heaven and earth. 

5 He consigns him to brahman, that is, he makes him a brahmacārin by saying brahmacāry asi, while he lets him sip water, which embodies the elixir of life (amr̥ta). Thus the pupil is initiated into the life eternal, and becomes a ‘wanderer in brahman’. 

6 After this initiation—with or without delay (see below n. 11 on p. 508)—the ācārya teaches the Veda by making him repeat its quintessence, the Sāvitrī. 

The importance attached to the position of pupil and teacher during the Veda instruction is apparent from the fact that it is singled out for specification in the Brāhmaṇa; there appear to be two different traditions. According to one tradition the student sits or stands at the right side (dakṣiṇatas) of the teacher, who, as is understood, is facing east. The position of the pupil is characterised by the term bulva/bulba. This word, apparently a hapax legomenon, is given by Mayrhofer ewa ṣv. as ‘etwa “seitwärts”’ (with the remark: ‘nicht klar’). Because of this sideway position, this tradition is rejected in the Brāhmaṇa, which opts for the alternative: the student should sit opposite the teacher looking at him from east to west. 2 

1 Cf. Bodewitz 2000, 22 f. 

2 SBr 11.5.4.14: ´ 







26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 507 

Which direction, we may ask, faces the pupil in the situation that is rejected? The commentary of Sāyaṇācārya does not resolve the question. 3 There can be little doubt that the teacher, homologous to Agni, is facing east; 4 the student, on the other hand, may be thought to be looking at his teacher in profile, i.e. he may be facing north, for that is the region of the gods, 5 the region of living men as opposed to that of the deceased. 6 Or, he may face the northeast, since standing towards that direction Prajāpati created the creatures, there the gate of heaven is believed to stand. 7 The northeast may be particularly appropriate in the present case, because it not only is the direction into which Prajāpati issued the beings—Prajāpati to whom the student has just been consigned— but also is the point of the compass where the Sun (Savitr.) rises at the summer solstice to begin a new year, the Sun to whom the student has just as well been consigned and into whose mantra (Sāvitrī) he is actually being initiated, that is, whose mantra he is reciting. If directed to the northeast, the student is seated obliquely, not transversely, with respect to the teacher. It is difficult to determine whether bulva means ‘oblique’ or ‘transverse’. 

Consequently, the first of the two alternatives discussed in the Satapatha- ´ brāhmaṇa, the one that is rejected by the Brāhmaṇa itself, namely that the student is sitting at the right side (dakṣiṇatas) of the teacher, allows for two interpretations: (1a) teacher is facing east and student is facing north, or (1b) 

´atha ha´ıke dakṣiṇat´ah.[ | ] tiṣṭhate vāśīnāya vā´nvāhur n´a t´athā kuryād y´o hainaṁt´atra brūyād bulb´aṁnv ā´ ay´am im´am ´ajījanata bulbo bhaviṣyatī´tīśvar´o ha t´athaiv´a syāt t´asmāt pur´astād ev´a pratī´ce samī´kṣamāṇāyā´nubrūyāt k 14 k 

Now some recite (to the pupil) while the latter is standing or sitting at the right side (of the teacher). One should not do so. One would be able to say to him in that case: ‘Yes indeed, he (the teacher) has begotten him (the student) sideways, and sideways (i.e. wayward) he (the student) will be’; and so, indeed, it will come to pass. Therefore he should recite to (the pupil) sitting in front of him, while the former is westwards looking. 

3 Sāyaṇa glosses: ayam ācārya imam śiṣyam atha bulvaṁtiraścīnaṁprāṅmukham ajījanat tathā cāyam. [b]ulvaḥparāṅmukho bhaviṣyatītier I take prāṅmukham, like bulvaṁtiraścīnam. , as an adverb qualifying ajījanat: ‘bulva, i.e. transversely, while facing forward/eastwards (prāṅmukham), he has begotten (the pupil)’; this adverb, referring to the position of the teacher, serves to pronounce the contrast with the pupil, who will turn away (parāṅmukha), will be adverse. Bulva thus means transverse (tiraścīna), adverse (parāṅmukha), which, again, suggests that teacher and pupil sit at right angles. 

4 This is the default position. ‘In the domestic rites the sacrificer stands to the west of the fire facing the east’ (Gonda 1980, 52). Cf. Bodewitz 2000, 25, 49.

Gonda 1980, 53; Bodewitz 2000, 24. 









teacher is facing east and student is facing northeast. (1b) is clearly a variant of (1a) and a combination of both is perfectly feasible: the pupil faces north, but, if appropriate, may look towards the northeast. 8 

That the Brāhmaṇa prefers alternative (2)—teacher and pupil sitting oppo site to one another, directed to the east and west respectively—-may above all have practical reasons, since the teacher bestows more than only learning upon the neophyte at this occasion; a change of position may have been thought to be cumbersome. 9 The first alternative (1a–b), on the other hand, because it makes sense in terms of the mystique of the quarters, may have preserved original traits. Moreover, the right side of the teacher has symbolic meaning. ‘There is ample evidence that the right hand or the right side of the body was decidedly preferred to the left.’ 10 We will return to this below. 

The Satapathabrāhman ´ . a does itself refer to earlier modalities of the ritual recitation of the Sāvitrī, when it reads: ‘In former days, however, they recited that same verse (the Sāvitrī) at the end of the year (saṁvatsare), thinking “being as old as a year, indeed, children are born; as soon as born, we impart speech to him”.’ 11 The appropriate direction in this ritual is, or so it seems, the northeast, in which direction Prajāpati gave birth, Prajāpati who is equated with the year (Gonda 1984). 

The Gr̥hyasūtras 

The two traditions indicated briefly in the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a can be followed in the Gr̥hyasūtra literature. As one would expect, the only Gr̥hyasūtra that 

8 Gonda 1980, 54 gives a confusing rendering of this position: 

On the other hand, the brahman (priest) is placed or sits south. . . . The same position is prescribed to the boy who is to be initiated before a girdle is tied round his waist, which is to protect him against evil influences. 

The boy is not said to sit in or face the south, but to sit at the right side of the teacher. That this coincides with the south is secondary and as such does not play a symbolic role, as I will argue in this article (cf. Bodewitz 2000, 26). 

9 According to the Gr̥hyasūtras the pupil receives, among other things, a girdle and a staff, to which the sacred thread may be added. All three items are missing in the SBr account. ´ It seems that bestowing the yajñopavīta upon the novice at this occasion is a relatively late addition (see Gopal 1959, 296). There is obviously a loss of symbolic significance in this second position of the pupil compared to the first alternative. Surveying the meaning of the western direction in Vedic ritual Gonda 1980, 55 observes: ‘It follows that facing eastwards whilst standing in the west [as does the ācārya, ḤṬB.] results in a desired effect, so that in the west one can be prosperous; facing the west does not however produce results.’ 

10 Gonda 1977a, 624; Gonda 1980, 57–60. ‘In the case of male beings the right side was auspicious, most probably because it was the ‘male’ side. Atharvavedapariśiṣṭa 70 c 25, 5 a royal sacrificer seeing that the flame of a (sacrificial) fire points to the right will be victorious. The side of strength and auspiciousness is also widely regarded as that of benignity, allegiance, benediction’ (op. cit. 60). 

11 SBr 11.5.4.6: ´ tā´ṁha smaitā´ṁpurā´ saṁvatsar´e ’nvāhuḥsaṁvatsar´asaṁmitā va´ı g´arbhāḥpr´ajāyante jāt´a evā`smiṁs t´ad vā´caṁdadhma ´ıti | Sāyaṇa ad loc. takes this to mean that the teaching of the student of the Sāvitrī took place a year after the initiation (or after a shorter period as specified in the following paragraphs). 







26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 509 

belongs, like the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a, to the White Yajurveda, the Pāraskara gr̥hyasūtra, follows the accepted tradition of the Brāhmaṇa, though it mentions the alternative. The place where the teaching takes place is specified: north of the sacrificial fire. 

After (the pupil) has made a pradakṣiṇa around the fire he takes his seat. The teacher, touched (by the pupil), pours oblations of ghee into the fire; when the remains have been eaten, he instructs him: ‘You are a brahmacārin, drink water, do your service, may you not sleep in the daytime, restrain your speech, put fuel on the fire, drink water.’ Then he recites to him the Sāvitrī, north of the sacrificial fire, while (the pupil) is sitting near him with his face turned west, looking (at him) and being looked at. Some: ‘to him while standing or sitting to his right side’. 12 

The Gr̥hyasūtras of the R. gveda, the Aśvalāyana- ¯ and Sāṅkhāyanagr ´ .hyasūtras, although different in details and sequence, seem basically to follow the accepted tradition of the White Yajurveda with regard to the place of teaching, to the north of the fire, and the vis-`a-vis position of teacher and pupil. 13 The same goes for the Gobhilagr̥hyasūtra of the Sāmaveda. 14 

12 PārGS 2.3.1–5: 

pradakṣiṇam agniṁparītyopaviśati k 1 k anvārabdha ājyāhutīr hutvā prāśanānte ’thainaṁsaṁśāsti k 2 k brahmacāry asy apo ’śāna karma kuru mā divā suṣupthā vācaṁyaccha samidham ādhehy apo ’śāneti k 3 k athāsmai sāvitrīm anvāhotta rato ’gneḥpratyaṅmukhāyopaviṣṭāyopasannāya samīkṣamāṇāya samīkṣitāya k 4 k dakṣiṇatas tiṣṭhata āsīnāya vaike k 5 k 

Words in bold face are literal quotations from the SBr 11.5.4.5, 14. Stenzler in his ´ translation (1878, 44) leaves dakṣiṇatas out altogether. Oldenberg in his translation (1886, 306) takes dakṣiṇatas as referring to the fire: ‘to the south (of the fire)’, which, since we are here concerned with a literal quote from the SBr, is certainly wrong. ´ 

13 The Aśvalāyana ¯ gives the following procedure. The teacher, touched (by the pupil), after having poured (oblations of ghee into the fire), stands to the north of the fire, his face turned east; opposite of him, with his face turned west the other (AśvGS ¯ 1.20.2–3: samanvārabdhe hutvōttarato ’gneḥprāṅmukha ācāryo ’vatiṣṭhate k 2 k purastāt pratyaṅmukha itaraḥk 3 k ). Then, while pouring the water of his añjali into that of the pupil, the teacher consigns the pupil to Savitr̥and to Prajāpati. After this the pupil puts on fuel and touches the fire. Then, without mentioning another position, the text continues by saying that the pupil, while reciting mantras, ‘approaches (the teacher), bends his knee, touches (the feet of the teacher), and should say: “O lord, teach the Sāvitrī, O lord, recite”.’ (AśvGS 1.21.4: [. . . ] ¯ upasthāya jānv ācyopasaṁgr̥hya brūyād adhīhi bho sāvitrīṁbho3 anubrūhīti k 4 k ). Cf. Sā˙nkhāyanagr ´ .hyasūtra 2.5.8–12:

The other tradition, rejected in the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a, we find in some Gr̥hyasūtras affiliated with the Black Yajurveda, though not in all. 15 For an assessment of the upanayana ritual according to this tradition, we turn to the elaborate description in the Bhāradvājagr̥hyasūtra. Its procedure may be epit omized (with cross-references to the Hiraṇyakeśigr̥hyasūtra). 

The teacher prepares for the homa sacrifice by consecrating the implements etc. (BhGS 1.3). He prepares west of the sacrificial fire a seat of grass (kūrca), of which the grassblades are turned to the north. There the teacher takes his seat, his face turned to the east; the pupil (kumāra), who has put on the yajñopavīta and sipped water, takes his seat at the right side (of his teacher) (dakṣiṇatas). 16 

The teacher performs the homa sacrifice (BhGS 1.4). Then he gives the pupil a new cloth, a girdle of muñja grass (mauñjī mekhalā), and a skin of the black antelope (ajina) (BhGS 1.5–6). Next (BhGS 1.7) (the teacher) strews to the west of the sacrificial fire darbha grasses, on which the two (teacher and pupil) take their stand, one facing east, the other west. The one facing east takes the hand of the one facing west and vice versa. A servant fills the añjalis of both with water. By his añjali (the teacher) transfers the water into the añjali (of the pupil). 17 

A formal interview takes place in which the teacher asks for the name of the pupil and subsequently leads him (upanayāmi) to Prajāpati (Ka) (BhGS 1.7). 

15 Not, for instance, in the ApGS 4.11.7–8: ¯

This evidently hybrid version of the ritual appears to be a conflation of the tradition of the White Yajurveda (and R. g- and Sāmaveda, as we saw above) and the alternative tradition (see below). The Gautamadharmasūtra adds to the confusion when it declares that the student should sit at the right side of the teacher, but may face either east or north; in the former case he sits parallel to the teacher: prāṅmukho dakṣiṇataḥśiṣya udaṅmukho vā . . . (GauDhS 1, in Dutt 1988).

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 511 

The teacher consigns the pupil to several other deities. The teacher asks him to step on a stone (aśman) and to put fuel on the fire (BhGS 1.8). 

Then the pupil makes a pradakṣiṇa around the fire, takes his seat at the right side (dakṣiṇatas), sciḷof the teacher, while he turns to the north, touches (the feet of the teacher), and asks: ‘O lord, recite the Sāvitrī’. 18 The place where the teacher is seated is not again specified, but presumably he is still seated west of the fire facing east, that is the place where he performed the homa sacrifice, took the interview accompanied by the añjalis, and consigned the pupil to Prajāpati etc. This is corroborated by the Hiraṇyakeśigr̥hyasūtra.19 

The sitting position of the preceptor and his audience 

Veda study is of course not restricted to the brahmacāriṇOutside the village, retreated into the wilderness (araṇya), brahmins devoted themselves to study and, if they became known for their learnedness, attracted students. In this way we conceive of the origin of the different Upaniṣad teaching traditions and of other early Indian schools of philosophy (above, p. 230). The subject of study and teaching may have changed accordingly, but the setting is traditional and had a long life. We find such an idyllic setting, for instance, in the Sāṅkhāyana- ´ gr̥hyasūtra, where it describes ‘the rules for the forest-dweller regarding his (Veda) study’. 20 

For this study (svādhyāya) the forest-dwellers should go to a pure spot in the northeast that is open at the eastern side. The site is circular or marked by a circle with an entrance to the east or the north. After some preliminary rites, they may take up their studies. 21 

The next section describes the teaching situation.

Then, after having entered the circle, the teacher is seated with his face turned to the east; the others sit with their faces turned to the north at the right side (of the

teacher), according to rank; if this is impossible (i.e., if there is not enough space) they may face all directions. They should wait for the rising of the suṇAnd when they have seen it (rise) in all its splendour, they say: ‘Sir, recite’, while touching with their right and left hands the hallowed feet of the teacher—his right (foot) with their right, his left (foot) with their left hands. 22 

The Sāṅkhāyanagr ´ .hyasūtra, which, as we have seen, agreed with the tradition of the White Yajurveda in opting for the face-to-face position of teacher and pupil north of the sacrificial fire in the upanayana ritual (see above n. 13 on p. 509), reserved the alternative position, in which the student sits at the right side of the teacher facing north, for the traditional school of the hermitage. 

It is to be expected that this time-honoured traditional setting of religious education may be met again in the Mahābhārata. The practice to stand with one’s face turned to the east when making a solemn pronouncement or to reveal a secret is attested in the great epic, as the following example may show. 

But then, when Kr̥ṣṇa, haven of brahmins, heard the cause of Pārtha’s (i.e. Arju na’s) sorrow, he touched water and stood still, his face turned to the east; and the mighty lotus-eyed one spoke this word for the benefit of Pāṇḍu’s son, intent upon killing the army of Jayadratha: ‘O Pārtha, there is a supreme unfailing weapon called “Pāśupata”, by which god Maheśvara killed all the Daityas in battle.’ 23 

However, I have not found in the Mahābhārata an exact parallel of the situation described in the Sāṅkhāyanagr ´ .hyasūtra, in which the position of the audience is specified. 

The sitting position of guru and novice in early Saiva ´ initiation ritual 

We may next investigate whether the tradition of Vedic initiation and instruc tion informed similar rites in the emerging religious communities. In his Change

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 513 

and Continuity in Indian Religion Jan Gonda elaborates the theme of the book with regard to the Vedic upanayana and the initiation (dīkṣā) in the monastic orders. 

Instead of upanayana and the renewable dīkṣā we find in the monastic orders an ordination proper—sometimes called dīkṣā—which is to be preceded by a noviciate beginning with a ceremony which is a parallel of the upanayana, and in various Hindu sects and communities an admission to full membership, to priesthood or guruship, which is also known as dīkṣā. (Gonda 1965, 317) 

And describing the initiation ritual of ascetics, he makes the following re mark. 

... dīkṣā. This term is translated by ‘consecration’ and ‘renouncement of the world’. On this occasion one is inter alia given a new name. During important acts, such as study, confession, one has to turn east- or northward; as is well known these directions are of special importance in brahmanic rites, the ‘door of heaven being in the northeast’. (Gonda 1965, p. 385) 

We shall confine ourselves here to the Saiva orders and investigate whether ´ these traditional directions of teacher and student can actually be found in their early texts. 

Initiation in the Pāśupata tradition 

The earliest text of a Saiva order that we have is the ´ Pāśupatasūtra with the commentary of Kauṇḍinya. The initiation in the order is briefly described by Kauṇḍinya when he explains the future tense used in the first Sūtra (vyākhyāsyāmaḥ, ‘we shall expound’). 

‘Shall’ (syā) refers to the time required, namely the time that is required (before the exposition can begin) by the ācārya, to consecrate a brahmin at Mahādeva’s ‘southern mūrti’ with ashes that are consecrated with the (five) mantras, ‘Sadyojāta’ etc., and to initiate him in the mantra, after he has made him relinquish the signs of his origin—a brahmin whose (antecedents) have earlier been screened, as follows from the word ‘therefore’ (atah.) in the Sūtra, who comes (to him) from amongst the householders etc., and who has (already) engaged himself in fasting and observances. 24 

The other Pāśupata text that has survived is the Gaṇakārikā. The Ratnaṭīkā, commenting on Gaṇakārikā 5, in which the elements of the initiation are 

24 Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1 (p. 8): 

syā ity eṣye kāle | yāvad ayam ācāryo gr̥hasthādibhyo ’bhyāgataṁpūrvam atah.- śabdāt parīkṣitaṁbrāhmaṇaṁvratopavāsādyam. * mahādevasya dakṣiṇasyāṁmūrtau sadyojātādisaṁskr̥tena bhasmanā saṁskaroti utpattiliṅgavyāvr̥ttiṁkr̥tvā mantraśrā vaṇaṁca karoti tāvad eṣyaḥkālaḥkriyate | * read: ◦āḍhyam. , instead of ◦ādyam. . 

I consider the interpretation that takes the locative mūrtau as depending on ◦saṁskr̥tena, rather than on saṁskaroti, possible, though less likely in the present context for reasons given below (cf., however, the T.īkā quoted in n. 38 on p. 518). 









summed up—the (right) materials, the (right) time, the ritual (of consecration), the image (mūrti), and the preceptor (guru) 25 —explains what in the context of the consecration ritual (saṁskāra) is meant by mūrti. It reads: 

The word image (mūrti) in the Kārikā aims at (abhipretah.) the spot (bhūpradeśah.) a little to the right (dakṣiṇa) of that, which [by Kauṇḍinya], in [his commentary on] the ‘Sūtra on offering’ [i.e. PS 1.8–9], is described (vyākhyātam. ) as the locus (sthāna) of worship of Mahādeva that is characterized by the erect phallus etc.—a spot not separated from it by a wall (kuḍya) or the like. 26 

‘Mūrti’ is here to be interpreted as a location, ‘at the mūrti’, referring to the site of consecration, said to be by the right side of (◦dakṣiṇa◦), close to ◦samīpa◦ and not separated ◦avyavahito from that which in Pāśupatasūtra 1.8–9 is qualified as Mahādeva’s manifestation (rūpa). If we assume that the commentator of the Gaṇakārikā and Kauṇḍinya both describe the same initiation tradition, we may deduce from the T.īkā that the words of Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1, mahādevasya dakṣiṇasyāṁmūrtau, are to be understood as saying that the novice is seated on the right side of Mahādeva. 27 

Though the esoteric intention of both authors clearly hampers our under standing, I would hazard the conjecture that the guru, who initiates the student into the Pāśupata observance (vrata) by communicating to him the doctrine as revealed by Siva himself in the ´ Pāśupatasūtra, embodies Siva. The novice is ´ seated next to him on his right-hand side, that is, he is situated ‘at the mūrti’; and this designation is understandable as it refers to a situation in which the neophyte envisages the image (mūrti) of the divine preceptor in his guru, that is, he sits at Mahādeva’s visual manifestation and sees Him, His rūpa, His benign epiphany, in front of him, in profile. The two natures of the teacher, the learned and pious person of flesh and blood, and the divine archetype are explicitly stated in the T.īkā on the word ‘guru’. 

‘Guru’ is the preceptor (ācārya); he has two forms, on account of the distinction supreme and not-supreme. With regard to these (two forms) not-supreme is he as 

25 Gaṇakārikā 5cd: dravyaṁkālaḥkriyā mūrtir guruś caiveha pañcamah.. 

26 Bhāsarvajña (?) ad Gaṇakārikā 5c (p. 9):

As Harunaga Isaacson has suggested to me, we should read kuḍyādya◦, instead of kuṭyā dya◦. I cannot subscribe to the translation of Oberhammer (1984, viii), which makes mūrti- śabdena the logical subject of vyākhyātam. (‘Mit dem Wort mūrtiḥ, das im Verehrungs sūtram [vorkommt], wird der große Gott als [sichtbares] Object der Verehrung (mahā devejyāsthānam) genannt, das [ikonographisch] durch das aufgerichtete Glied gekenn zeichnet ist [ūrdhvaliṅgādilakṣaṇam]’). The commentator’s wording seems to me on the other hand a sign that he tried to avoid saying that the mūrti meant here is a sculpture that has the actual iconographic characteristics of ūrdhvaliṅgādi. 

27 To interpret the word mūrtau here (above, n. 24 on p. 513) in conformity with the com mentary on the Gaṇakārikā was first suggested to me by Dr G´erard Colas. 







26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 515 

being circumscribed by the knowledge of the five categories. The supreme guru is the lord Maheśvara, who empowers the former. 28 

If we turn to the Svacchandatantra, describing the samayadīkṣā, we find the above interpretation confirmed. 

After he has performed the (preliminary) rites, he [i.e. the guru], rejoiced at heart, makes the pupil, whose eyes are full of joy, stand up and, taking him by his hand, leads him towards the ‘southern mūrti’: Having made a circle there into a seat (consisting) of the syllable om with the help of a flower, he places the pupil upon it, his body erect, his face turned to the north. After the guru has installed himself whilst facing east, he performs the sprinkling and subsequent rites. 29 

The Dakṣiṇam¯ urti ¯ 

From the place of initiation where Siva manifests himself to the novice for the ´ first time in that He assumes the form of guru, we now proceed to the public domain of the temple. In that context the word mūrti is used to refer to the physical object of veneratioṇThis connotation underlies the T.īkā’s description of the daily worship of the initiated Pāśupata, who, after his bath in ashes, 

enters slowly the sanctum. Then he falls to his knees on a spot to the right of the image (mūrtidakṣiṇe bhūpradeśe), makes an añjali before his heart, and looks at Siva in the image as if He were there in His very person, ´ 

and which means that, 

he, fully concentrated and with his head turned towards the north, practises japa with the aim of that (viśeṣa) detachment from the sensual world, after which japa he sinks into meditation on Siva; only then ( ´ eva) he should burst into repeated boisterous laughter. 30

Analogous with the situation of initiation, the Pāśupata envisages Siva in front ´ of him, this time, however, in the physical object of worship. It is towards this manifestation of God that the Pāśupata turns and in whom he is sunk, an idea we also find in the following passage of the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata where broad-minded Vāsudeva teaches. 

The holy man who has reached Me (i.e. Vāsudeva) fixes himself upon My body (mūrti), or on Rudra’s Dakṣin.(ā)mūrti, especially on the fourteenth (tithi). He, the great ascetic, while he is venerated by Siddhas, Brahmarṣis and celestial folk, and while his praises are sung by Gandharvas and choirs of Bhūtas, he of great splendour enters either Me or Sam ´ . kara. 31 

We thus observe that the term mūrti in the Pāśupata context on the one hand refers to the ‘image’ (meaning bodily manifestation) and, on the other hand, when used in the locative (or when the locative is meant), refers to ‘a particular spot near the image’, that is not to the image itself. Both meanings are, as we will argue, comprehended by the technical term dakṣiṇāmūrti, literally ‘south ward/rightward image/body/figure’. This term is explained by Kauṇḍinya when he comments on Pāśupatasūtra 1.9: mahādevasya dakṣiṇāmūrteḥ| 

‘Of the God’ (◦devasya) is a genitive. This is a syntactic feature that expresses the relationship of owner and property; it signifies possession/ grace (parigraha) only. 

‘Southern’ (dakṣiṇā◦) in the Sūtra is in the sense of a specific point of the compass. The sun divides the quarters and the quarters divide the mūrti. 

‘Image’ (mūrti): Either this (yad etad) form (rūpa) that is perceived by him who is standing at the right side of God, his face turned north, in (His) proximity, a form that is characterised by the bull-banner, the lance in hand, Nandin, Mahākāla, erect phallus etc., or to which (yad vā) the laymen resort. 

The sanctuary is ‘of the Great God’ (mahādevasya). This is the answer (iti). There is the object to be worshipped. 32 

hāsaṁpunaḥpunaḥkuryāt | 

The commentator rejects the view of some (ity eke) who say that he may burst into boisterous laughter as soon has he got to the temple, if his detachment has not ceased (yady anivr̥ttapratyāhāras tadā gatamātra eva hasitaṁkuryād ity eke).

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 517 

For the initiated Pāśupata like Kauṇḍinya the term dakṣiṇāmūrti thus seems rather to refer to a situation or state than to a particular ‘image’, namely the state in which God appears to him who sits or stands at His right side and sees Him in front of him (for instance in the temple image). It is the situation in which Siva reveals himself ‘towards him who is at His right side’ ( ´ dakṣiṇā), 33 namely, by turning His auspicious, gracious side towards him who is facing north—the sitting position of the novice since Vedic times. 

The strength of this tradition obviously rests on the religious idea of the right side. To turn one’s right side upon someone is an auspicious act; in the case of God it is an act of grace in which He reveals Himself and His doctrine ‘unto them on his right hand’. It happens to the blessed ones in His proximity, that is in heaven on the Himavat, and as such to the initiated Pāśupata in his yoga with God, who may be represented either by the image or by the guru. In sum, the Pāśupata Dakṣiṇāmūrti is a state in which God reveals one quarter of Himself, the form to which He grants access, i.e. yoga; it is Siva’s figure of ´ grace. 34 

In spite of the use of the word mukha, used here in figurative sense, I think the Svetāsvatara Upanis ´ .ad 4.21 expresses this very idea: 

‘Unborn is He’, so saying, Let a man in fear approach Him: O Rudra [show] thy right [auspicious] cheek, Protect me with it ever! 35 

In the direct vision that is granted to the Pāśupata the ideal image of Mahādeva is visualized as being accompanied by his acolytes Nandin and Mahākāla, the 

mūrtir nāma yad etad devasya dakṣiṇe pārśve sthitenodaṅmukhenopānte yad rūpam upalabhyate vr̥ṣadhvajaśūlapāṇinandimahākālordhvaliṅgādilakṣaṇaṁyad vā laukikāḥpratipadyante [ | ] mahādevasyāyatanam iti tatropastheyam | 

I propose to read a daṇḍa after pratipadyante. 

33 The adverbial dakṣiṇena (cf. MBh 1.203.21, above, p. 500) is equivalent to dakṣiṇā, which is the oia instrumental in ā preserved in some adverbs. Wackernagel 1930, III § 41b ṣv. d´akṣiṇa: ‘dakṣiṇā´ zur rechten Seite.’ The phrase dakṣiṇāmūrtigrahaṇāt in his commen tary ad PS 1.9 shows that Kauṇḍinya takes dakṣiṇāmūrteḥas a compound, altough he does not explain it. However, his speaking of ‘eastern’, ‘northern’, and ‘western’ mūrtis (below, n. 34 on p. 517) implies that he takes the compound as a Karmadhāraya. In the gloss (above, n. 32 on p. 516 f.) he makes clear that ‘southern’ is to be understood as ‘at the right side of’ (dakṣiṇe pārśve). This is his explanation of the adverbial dakṣiṇā (cf. below, n. 39 on p. 518). 

34 In this way the dakṣiṇāmūrti continues the R. gvedic idea that the supreme deity manifests only one fourth of himself. R̥V 10.90.3–4: 

etā´vān asya mahimā´ ´ato jyā´yāṁś ca pū´ruṣaḥ| 

pā´do ’sya v´ıśvā bhūtā´ni tripā´d asyāmr´tam . . div´ı k 3 k

This seems to be the purport of Kauṇḍinya’s remark (ibiḍp. 15): dakṣiṇāmūrtigrahaṇāt pūrvottarapaścimānāṁmūrtīnāṁpratiṣedhaḥ| 

35 R̥C. Zaehner’s translation in Hindu Scriptures, p. 197: ajāta ity evaṁkaścid bhīruḥprapadyate | rudra yat te dakṣiṇaṁmukhaṁtena māṁpāhi nityam k 21 k 









bull-banner etc., in short, a ‘tableau de la troupe’. The physical image in the sacred compound is not defined. If our interpretation is correct, it may be any image, most often a liṅga, considered by the Pāśupata laymen as ‘the image’ (mūrti) of Mahādeva, a designation that for the initiate is true only in metaphorical sense. 36 

The definition of God’s figure of grace 

The concept of dakṣiṇāmūrti thus comprises the manifested form (rūpa) of God, the (physical) image or body (mūrti) in which it may be envisaged, and the right side (dakṣiṇe pārśve), which indicates the Pāśupata’s position with respect to Mahādeva and his embodiment. As such the term is applicable to every situation in which the Pāśupata enters into contact with his object of worship. And this appears to have been the intention of the author of the Pāśupatasūtra when we read PS 1.8–9 coherently (as also the author of the T.īkā seems to have done: upahārasūtra, above, p. 514): ‘He should worship with offerings of laughter, singing, dancing, bellowing, obeisance, and muttering to the figure of grace (dakṣiṇāmūrti) of Mahādeva.’ 37 The same idea underlies the Ratnaṭīkā, where it says that the Pāśupata should consecrate the ashes with mantras in the temple ‘at Siva’s Daks ´ .iṇāmūrti’, 38 or the Skandapurāṇa when it advises that one should offer rice pudding with ghee at the ‘southern mūrti’ during one year in order to become like Nandin. 39 

It seems obvious that the same idea underlies the initiation rite, in which the place of the physical image, i.e. the mūrti, may be taken by the guru who 

36 This position conforms best with the view of images maintained in the Nyāya school, which is generally believed to have had close links with the Pāśupata. In Colas 2004, 163 this author describes Udayana’s point of view as follows: ‘The rite does not specifically invest the image with a divine presence or power through a mechanical process, but occasions the conscious reflection, by deities, of themselves as being present in the image.’ In other words, Siva’s presence in the Daks ´ .iṇāmūrti is an act of grace (parigraha). 

37 PS 1.8–9: hasitagītanr̥ttaḍuṁḍuṁkāranamaskārajapyopahāreṇopatiṣṭhet mahādevasya dakṣiṇāmūrteḥk 8–9 k I take dakṣiṇāmūrteḥhere as genitivus pro dativo depending on upahāreṇa (see Speijer 1889, § 132). Alternatively, we may read an accusative, dakṣiṇā mūrtim, in accordance with the Benares and Calcutta mss of the Sūtras and some testimonies. See Bisschop 2006a, 5. 

38 Ratnaṭīkā at Gaṇakārikā 7 (p. 18): . . . śivadakṣiṇamūrtau mantraiḥsaṁskr̥tya . . . . Cf. Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1 (above, p. 513).

Cf. SPS 167.15 (Bisschop 2006, 92):

divaukasas tam abhyarcya bhavanti gaṇapādhipāḥk 15 k 

When the compound dakṣiṇāmūrti is dissolved, dakṣiṇa is taken as an adjective— sometimes inflected nominally (above), sometimes pronominally (e.g. Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1, quoted in n. 24 on p. 513)—which shows again that we should read dakṣiṇāmūrti as a Karmadhāraya compound. However, when dissolved, the original use of the adverb dakṣiṇā´ (= dakṣiṇena) is ignored. 







26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 519 

represents Siva (as the ´ ācārya represents Agni in the upanayana). In fact, it appears most likely that the concept of dakṣiṇāmūrti originated from this ritual in which Siva as supreme teacher reveals himself. To this primordial ´ figure—a god who is facing towards the east, but who confers his blessings, that is his ‘right’ side, on his creatures, be they gods, Siddhas, or worshippers in Bhāratavarṣa—the pseudo-Sam ´ . kara pays homage: 

tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁśrīdakṣiṇāmūrtaye k 

This obeisance is to Him who has the form of the illustrious teacher, 

to the illustrious figure of grace. 40 

The Dakṣiṇam¯ urti and iconography ¯ 

Having thus established the original meaning of Dakṣiṇāmūrti, we may proceed to its current iconographic denotation. 

Among the earliest texts that describe the dakṣiṇāmūrti in iconographic terms may be the two Upajāti verses that are quoted by Gopinatha Rao, which he ascribed to the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, but which are not found in the printed text of that name. 

His right (lower) hand shows the (jñāna) mudrā and in his (right) upper (hand) he (holds) a white rosary; in his left (lower hand) he is holding a book comprising all the Agamas and more, and with his upper (left hand) he holds the cup with ¯ nectar. 

He is seated on a white lotus, his colour is white, powerful, with white cloth and ointment, and crowned by the crescent, teaching knowledge to the sages: that is what they call his Dakṣiṇāmūrti. 41 

On this and other, predominantly late South-Indian texts Rao based his de scription, which was repeated without any significant change by almost all later indological writing on this subject. It may be significant to note, though, that in the above passage the southern orientation of the image is not mentioned. To substantiate his view, however, Rao wrote: 

One account gives an explanation regarding the etymology of this name; it states that because Siva was seated ´ facing south when he taught the r̥ishis yōga and jñāna he came to be known as Dakshiṇāmūrti. This aspect of Siva is always ´ invoked by students of science and arts. 42 

40 ṬṀP. Mahadevan (1980), The Hymns of Saṅkara ´ , p. 2 ff. Sam ´ . kara’s authorship of this hymn is doubtful, see Potter 1981, 317. 

41 Rao 1914, II.2, Appendix B, p. 140 (cf. Mayamata 36.98–101): 

dakṣeṇa mudrāṁpratipādayantaṁsitākṣasūtraṁca tathordhvabhāge | 

vāme ca pustām akhilāgamādyāṁbibhrāṇam ūrdhvena sudhādharaṁca k 

sitāmbujasthaṁsitavarṇam īśaṁsitāmbarālepanam indumaulim | 

jñānaṁmunibhyaḥpratipādayantaṁtaṁdakṣiṇāmūrtim udāharanti k 

42 Rao 1914, II.1, p. 273 (bold face mine). 









Unfortunately, however, we are not informed about this ‘account’, 43 but Rao, without any doubt, was following an Indian iconographic convention, which prescribes ‘that in all Hindu temples, both Saiva and Vaishn ´ . ava, the niche on the south wall of the central shrine should have the figure of Dakshiṇāmūrti enshrined in it’. 44 Bruce Long, who devoted an article to the subject, relied heavily on Rao, but he put his finger on the problem, when he professed that he was puzzled, 

As to why the southern direction, which is believed almost everywhere in India to be sinister and inauspicious, should in this instance be evaluated as auspicious and benign. 

It is not beyond reason that we explain this curiously positive evaluation of the southern direction on the basis of the same religious principle by which the Furies in Greece came to be called the ‘Eumenides’, and Rudra, the ferocious Howler, came to be addressed as Siva, the Auspicious. Perhaps the worshippers of ´ Siva ´ hoped that by having the Divine Preceptor face the southern direction, that area would, thereby, lose its sinister qualities and become benign. 45 

Although I shall not deny that considerations such as the above may have played some role, at least in coming to terms with the apparent incongruity once established, it is important to recognize that, if they played a role, they did so in retrospect. The cause of the alleged incongruity, I would like to argue, is a reorientation of the traditioṇA cult concept was transposed to iconography. Part of the original meaning was retained—Siva as the source of knowledge— ´ part of it was reinterpreted, namely, the direction God faces when expounding His wisdom: His ‘right side’ became his ‘southern face’. The southern temple walls were consequently thought most suitable for showing images of Siva in ´ his role of teacher. 46 Thus the dakṣiṇāmūrti entered the textbooks of Indian architecture, for instance the Mayamata, which divided Kauṇḍinya’s vision into two. 

A chacun des paliers des temples il faut disposer aux points cardinaux des (images des) dieux. Au rez-de-chauss´ee on place `a l’Est les deux guardiens de la porte, Nandi et Kāla; au Sud c’est la Dakṣiṇāmūrti, `a l’Ouest Acyuta ou Li˙ngasambhūta et au Nord Pitāmaha. 47 

43 I could not find this ‘account’ in the texts at issue presented in Rao’s Appendix B (II.2, pp. 137–146). 

44 Rao 1914 II.1, p. 273. 

45 Long 1971, 69; ibiḍn. 1. 

46 Harle 1986, 301: 

All the principal images of the Brahmanical pantheon are represented in South India during the Coḷa period. There is a particular predilection for Bhikṣāṭana, Siva as the ´ naked young ascetic, and for Siva as Daks ´ .iṇāmūrti, the expounder of yoga, music and the śāstras, who is always, where possible, facing south (dakṣiṇa means ‘south’, and although there is no very convincing explanation of the name, it may account in part for the popularity of this image in South India).

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 521 

The development of a cult concept into an iconic image 

Finally the question must be briefly addressed when and where this cult concept turned into an iconographic one. This development may actually have had two moments. 

1 An anthropomorphic (iconic) representation of Siva who through attributes, ´ a book for instance, a mudrā (vitarka-, vyākhyāna-mudrā), or some other gesture, or because he sits alongside a pupil, is identifiable as the supreme teacher. This image, or at least Siva as its main character, faces the east. ´ 

2 An anthropomorphic representation of Siva, two- or four-armed, with one ´ or more of the attributes of (1), but whose main characteristic is that he is directed towards the south without showing the terrifying aspect. 

The transition of 1 to 2 calls forth the ‘incongruity’. 

This incongruity may be considered to have been solved when the image of the Dakṣiṇāmūrti began to evolve an autonomy of its own, next to and indepen dent of that of Aghora/Bhairava. Given the fact that the central image in the garbhagr̥ha is orientated towards the east, the image at the southern wall may be seen as an original ‘visualisation’ of the right side, expressing one aspect of the god enshrined, from whom it became spatially detached. Buddhist influ ences (e.g. the deer at Siva’s feet, the tree above his head) are discernible in ´ this process of iconographic composition. 48 

The genesis of the iconic representation of the teaching Siva thus ended with ´ his ‘banishment’ outside the cultic sphere. The idea of the guru as the locus (sthāna) or support of the divinity was transferred onto the central cult object in the sanctum, the liṅga. Therewith the Dakṣiṇāmūrti on the southern outer temple wall lost its original ritual setting. It became part of the iconographic programme of the Siva temple. ´ 

The process of transformation from cult concept into an iconic image seems to have been completed (in South India at least) by the tenth century (i.e. the early Coḷa period), but may have started much earlier. An early textual testimony of this process is found in the Skandapurāṇa. It tells the myth of Tilottamā that we discussed above, pp. 498 f. When the nymph bows to Siva’s southern appearance ( ´ dakṣiṇāṁmūrtim. ), the face of the guru of the gods (mukhaṁsuraguros) emerged, ‘possessed of the colour of a languid cloud laden with water, having a ferocious voice, with dreadful teeth shining (in an open mouth), and the corners of the eyes bloodshot and glittering’ (SP 62.18– 19). The ‘incongruity’ is obviously not yet solved, since the description of this face suits the figure of Aghora/Bhairava, not that of the teacher or guru.

To assess the above-sketched develop   

ment properly requires an art-historical 

scrutiny of the available archaeological 

material examined for the above fea 

tures; this cannot be done here. Mate 

rial representing moment 2 is not hard to 

find. A relatively early example dating 

from the late Pallava period (ad 875– 

900) is illustrated in Plate 114. It shows 

a four armed Siva as teacher on the outer ´ 

southern wall of the garbhagr̥ha of the 

Vīraṭṭāneśvara Temple in Tiruttaṇi. His 

hands show the vitarkamudrā combined 

with rosary, abhayamudrā, book, and 

lotus-stalk. 49 

The question when and where exactly 

this type of ‘southern image’ is found 

for the first time is more difficult to es 

tablish, partly for the same reasons as 

why the material representing moment 

1 proves so hard to identify. It is often 

Plate 114 

Tiruttaṇi: Dakṣiṇāmūrti 

difficult to establish which direction the teaching Siva is facing, if the image or ´ relief is no longer part of a spatial con 

struction or has been reemployed. It may even be doubted, whether our mo ment 1 is an historic reality at all; possibly, the teaching Siva, the Daks ´ .iṇāmūrti as an iconographic category, was from the beginning conceived of as facing the south. 

A Dakṣiṇāmūrti on a crossbar found in Nagarī 

To conclude I wish to present an image that may alleviate our doubts somewhat. It concerns a crossbar found in Nagarī (Rajasthan) illustrated in Williams 1982, Pl. 216. On p. 140 f. this scholar gives the following description. 

The most impressive carvings at Nagarī are the remains of a gigantic gateway or toraṇa that must belong to the early sixth century on the basis of its relationship to works from Mandasor. 

The lintel has sculptures on both sides. The reliefs on what appears to be the reverse (mistakenly said in op. cit. 141 to be illustrated in Pl. 216) are identified by Williams as scenes from ‘the story of the encounter between Arjuna and the kirāta or hunter’. After his fight with Siva incognito, Arjuna receives the ´

Pāśupata weapon, a scene that is unfortunately missing, but may have been depicted in a relief that belonged to the part of the crossbar that has broken off and is missing. 50 

  



Plate 115 

Nagarī: Crossbar of toraṇa 

About the obverse side of the lintel (Plate 115; see also below, Plates 141–142) Williams observes: 

The subjects of the [obverse] of this same crossbar remain to be identified. The third panel from the right (not the center of the lintel) [below, Plate 154] shows a seated figure with twisted locks in meditation, surrounded by four worshippers; despite the lack of the club, this might represent Lakulīśa. If so, the remaining scenes are presumably Saiva. ´ 51 

50 The end of the story may be supplied as it is told in the Mahābhārata (see also below, pp. 592 ff.). Mahādeva reveals himself and Arjuna falls to his knees MBh 3.40.55–56: tato devaṁmahādevaṁgiriśaṁśūlapāṇinam | 

dadarśa phalgunas tatra saha devyā mahādyutim k 55 k 

sa jānubhyāṁmahīṁgatvā śirasā praṇipatya ca | 

prasādayāmāsa haraṁpārthaḥparapuraṁjayaḥk 56 k 

Arjuna asks for forgiveness and receives a booṇArjuna asks for the terrible Pāśupata weapon also called ‘Brahmaśiras’ (MBh 3.41): 

bhagavan dadāsi cen mahyaṁkāmaṁprītyā vr̥ṣadhvaja | 

kāmaye divyam astraṁtad ghoraṁpāśupataṁprabho k 7 k 

yat tad brahmaśiro nāma raudraṁbhīmaparākramam | 

yugānte dāruṇe prāpte kr̥tsnaṁsaṁharate jagat k 8 k 

This is granted. Then Arjuna, purified, embraces the feet of the Lord and the latter says ‘learn’: 

tac chrutvā tvaritaḥpārthaḥśucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ| 

upasaṁgr̥hya viśveśam adhīṣveti ca so ’bravīt k 17 k 

Though the text omits it, we have to assume, after the above and in view of the other side of the lintel, that Arjuna takes his seat at the right side of the Lord. Then Siva explains the ´ secrets of the weapon: 

tatas tv adhyāpayāmāsa sarahasyanivartanam | 

tad astraṁpāṇḍavaśreṣṭhaṁmūrtimantam ivāntakam k 18 k 

51 Williams 1982, 141. 









In a letter (e-mail ḍd. 10-3-2001) Joanna Williams informed me that she ‘won ders whether the scene at the left end of this face (below, Plates 145–146) might not represent the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice’. This proposition is further pursued in the present article, but an elaborate study of the crossbar by Bakker & Bisschop 2016 intends to show that it is untenable after all. 52 

Dakṣa’s sacrifice and his instruction in the Pāśupata observance 

The story of Siva’s destruction of Daks ´ .a’s sacrifice is told in Mahābhārata 12 App. I No. 28 (= Northern Recension); it may be briefly recapitulated here. Vīrabhadra and Bhadrakālī etc. destroy Dakṣa’s sacrifice in Gaṅgādvāra. Dakṣa takes refuge with Maheśvara (ll. 123 ff.). Devadeveśa himself appears (ll. 140 ff.). Dakṣa begs him that not all his sacrificial toil may have been in vain (l. 151). This is granted by Hara. Then the text reads (ll. 154 f.): 

jānubhyām avanīṁgatvā dakṣo labdhvā bhavād varam | 

nāmnām aṣṭasahasreṇa stutavān vr̥ṣabhadhvajam k 

Dakṣa fell to his knees, having received (this) boon from Bhava. 

Then he praised Vr̥ṣabhadhvaja by his Thousand-and-eight Names. 

The stotra of Siva’s thousand-and-eight names follows (ll. 160–389). ´ Siva ex- ´ presses his satisfaction and promises Dakṣa that he will gain the benefit of thousand Aśvamedha and hundred Vājapeya sacrifices, thanks to his grace (ll. 390–94.). Then Mahādeva bestows upon him another boon (ll. 395–409): the vrata, based on the Veda with its six aṅgas and on the Sāṁkhya-yoga, arduous on account of its tapas, which is transgressive of, in some cases con formable to the ordinary dharma, which is practised by those who are nearing the end, and which is beyond the (ordinary four) stages of life (atyāśrama). 53 Mahādeva promises him the reward of this vrata (ll. 407–09): 

mayā pāśupataṁdakṣa yogam utpāditaṁpurā | 

tasya cīrṇasya tat samyak phalaṁbhavati puṣkalam | 

tac cāstu te mahābhāga tvajyatāṁmānaso jvaraḥk 54 

52 See below, pp. 567 ff. and pp. 576 ff. 

53 MBh 12 App. I No. 28 ll. 395–406:

26 / At the Right Side of the Teacher 525 

Long ago, O Dakṣa, the Pāśupata yoga was created by me: that (tat, sciḷyoga) is the eminent reward of properly practising that (tasya, sciḷvrata), and that (yoga) shall be yours, O blessed one. Throw off the fever of (your) soul! 

In other words: Mahādeva instructs/initiates Dakṣa in the Pāśupata obser vance; this is the boon that will lead him eventually to the end of suffering (duḥkhānta), the Pāśupata yoga or union with God. 

In view of the material discussed in the present article, it is obvious to see in the first panel from the right on the lintel (Plate 116; cf. Plate 156) an example of a Dakṣiṇāmūrti. If we assume that the toraṇa was facing east and that this is the obverse side of the lintel, Maheśvara, accompanied by his wife, 55 sits facing east, leaning towards the right, where his suppliant sits on his knees, facing north. 

This interpretation is corroborated by our later study of the crossbar. How ever, although the two panels to the left (above, p. 524) initially suggested that the suppliant in question might be King Dakṣa (Bakker 2004c, 133), there are good reasons to reconsider this interpretation and to see in the person who receives instruction, not Dakṣa, but Arjuna. 56 

  



Plate 116 

Nagarī: a Dakṣiṇāmūrti 

(cf. MBh 13.17.18). Yoga in the Pāśupata system is defined by Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1 as ‘union with god’: ucyate yogam | atra ātmeśvarasaṁyogo yogaḥ| My interpretation differs from that of Mertens 1998, 76 f., who assumes a conflation of concepts: ‘Im selben Satz wird das pāśupatavrata als yoga bezeichnet (407); die beiden Begriffe tapas und yoga werden hier also synonym verwendet. Für bestimmte Schichten des Mahābhārata ist die Vermischung beider Begriffe üblich.’ However, no examples from the MBh are adduced to corroborate this contention. 

55 Cf. MBh ibiḍl. 410: evam uktvā mahādevaḥsapatnīko vr̥ṣabhadvajaḥ| 

56 Bakker & Bisschop 2016, 239 f.; below, p. 586. 







It thus appears that the central theme of both sides of the crossbar is the acquisition of a Pāśupata good: the instruction in the Pāśupata observance and the procurement of the Pāśupata weapoṇThe toraṇa may have stood at the entrance of a Pāśupata temple. The depiction of the instruction scene, the Dakṣiṇāmūrti or Siva’s figure of grace, would therefore be appropriate, if our ´ analysis is correct.
