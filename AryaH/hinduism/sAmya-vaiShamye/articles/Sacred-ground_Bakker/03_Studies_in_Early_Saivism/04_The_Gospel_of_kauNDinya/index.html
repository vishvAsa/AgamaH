Kauṇḍinya’s Panc˜ arthabh ¯ as¯.ya
Kuśika and the divine revelation
When we speak of the gospel of Kauṇḍinya, we call forth an association with texts which describe the birth, life, and deeds of a saviour, texts which are meant to bring good news, an evangelium, into the world. This evocation is deliberate. As a tribute to Jan Bremmer’s life-long engagement, scholarly and otherwise, with gospels and kindred texts that have just failed to reach that status, I would like to show, that a text called ‘The Five Topics’, Pañcārtha, which has the form of a commentary (bhāṣya) on the Sūtras of the Pāśupata school (the Pāśupatasūtras (PS)), resembles a gospel in many respects. Not only by the dramatic facts which it professes to report, but also by its apodictic style, and its pretence to communicate a divine revelation, presenting a unique path (sādhana), which alone is able to promise and deliver hope and salvation to the faithful. Its author, Kauṇḍinya, who may have lived in the 4th century ad, puts himself in the lineage of preceptors that descends directly from the divine teacher’s first disciple, Kuśika. 1">

  <p>The Descent of God in Gujarat and the Practice of Imitating God</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya’s Panc˜ arthabh ¯ as¯.ya</p>
<p>Kuśika and the divine revelation</p>
<p>When we speak of the gospel of Kauṇḍinya, we call forth an association with texts which describe the birth, life, and deeds of a saviour, texts which are meant to bring good news, an evangelium, into the world. This evocation is deliberate. As a tribute to Jan Bremmer’s life-long engagement, scholarly and otherwise, with gospels and kindred texts that have just failed to reach that status, I would like to show, that a text called ‘The Five Topics’, Pañcārtha, which has the form of a commentary (bhāṣya) on the Sūtras of the Pāśupata school (the Pāśupatasūtras (PS)), resembles a gospel in many respects. Not only by the dramatic facts which it professes to report, but also by its apodictic style, and its pretence to communicate a divine revelation, presenting a unique path (sādhana), which alone is able to promise and deliver hope and salvation to the faithful. Its author, Kauṇḍinya, who may have lived in the 4th century ad, puts himself in the lineage of preceptors that descends directly from the divine teacher’s first disciple, Kuśika. 1</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that this Kuśika has been a historic person, who may have lived in the 2nd century ad. He is mentioned by name as the fountainhead of a lineage of ten teachers in the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61 (i.e. ad 380/81, or ad 388, according to Falk 2004, 173). 2 Kauṇḍinya describes how and why this Kuśika came to be elected to receive and spread the divine word. He begins by defining the nature of God.</p>
<p>And accordingly, since His nature is play (krīḍā) . . . (it is certain that) the activity of God is springing from play. And (His) activity, insomuch as this consists in pro claiming the doctrine, is for the sake of bestowing favour (anugraha). (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1)</p>
<p>∗ The first version of this article was published in Dijkstra, Jitse, Justin Kroesen, &amp; Yme Kuiper (eds.), Myths, Martyrs, and Modernity. Studies in the History of Religions in Honour of Jan ṇBremmer. Brill, Leiden – Boston 2010. pp. 517–529. Numen Book Series. Studies in the History of Religions 127.</p>
<p>1 Kauṇḍinya ad PS 4.10: kuśikeśānasambandhāt. Cf. above, n. 6 on p. 529 and Bisschop 2006, 49 f.</p>
<p>2 CII III (1981), 240. See above, p. 287 and p. 494.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p>The emphasis Kauṇḍinya lays upon the true nature of God as play is to safe guard His sovereignty, His omnipotence (prabhutva). This nature of God, here defined for the first time, will remain an integral feature of nearly all Hindu conceptions of god, and we will meet it again below in this essay. Bestowing favour is God’s free choice, not induced by anything outside Him. His absolute freedom is without beginning and end, but, in order to fulfil His wish, He takes birth.</p>
<p>So, on account of His ability to do whatever He wishes, and His being unborn, God, having taken upon Him a body of a brahmin, has descended in Kāyāvataraṇa in human form. And He has reached Ujjayanī by foot. How do we know that? (We know that) on account of the authoritativeness of learned persons (śiṣṭa), and because we (still) see and hear the proofs thereof. (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1; above, n. 7 on p. 529)</p>
<p>This event is of a completely different nature as the mythic avatāra stories that we know from the Vaiṣṇava religioṇIts measure is human and it has a ring of historicity. Imagine Viṣṇu’s descent as the Boar or the Tortoise, going on foot from one historical site to another, a distance of 290 km as the divine aerial chariot (vimāna) flies!</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya continues by telling that this divine brahmin smeared himselves with ashes and selected a sanctuary in Ujjain as his place of residence. Unfor tunately the name of the sanctuary is not mentioned and the later tradition of the Skandapurāṇa locates this residence in the cremation ground (śmaśāna) of Ujjain.</p>
<p>Thereupon Lord Kuśika arrived, impelled by God; he saw the signs of perfec tion, such as complete contentment, in the preceptor and the opposites thereof in himself; falling at his feet he informed him properly about his caste, gotra, Vedic affiliation, and his being free of debts; then, at an appropiate moment, (this) pupil, who was like a patient, consulted the preceptor, who had bided his time, and who was the doctor as it were: ‘Lord, is there a remedy that is effective and final for all those pains which fate, the world and we ourself afflict upon us, or not?’ (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1)</p>
<p>On this pertinent question, the holy brahmin, the incarnation of God, said: atha, ‘well’. Kauṇḍinya explains:</p>
<p>Here the word ‘well’ relates to what earlier had happened. In what way [a student may ask] ? He has said ‘well’ in relation to the earlier question put by the pupil. Thus this word atha (‘well’) signifies the answer to what has been asked: that end to suffering (duḥkhānta) does exist. (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1)</p>
<p>‘Well’ is the opening word of the gospel, being the first word of the first Sūtra. It is followed by the word ataḥ, for which see above, p. 513. Then follows the word paśupateḥ, ‘of Paśupati’, i.e. ‘of God’. This expression Kauṇḍinya takes as the answer to a further question: ‘due to what is this “being without suffering” reached?’ It is reached, Kauṇḍinya preaches, due to the grace (prasāda) of God, which initiates union (yoga) with Him.</p>
<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya 543</p>
<p>That (union), (according to some), comes about by the act of one only—as in the case of a post and the falcon—because it is (said to be) effected by meditation, study etc. of a human being (puruṣa). [However, we believe that] it comes about by the act of both—as in the case of (two fighting) rams. (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.1)</p>
<p>This mystical union, therefore, lies not entirely in the hands of the aspirant. The difference, Kauṇḍinya observes, between his and other salvation doctrines is precisely this: only Siva’s grace saves. In order that man may receive it, God ´ has descended in an act of mercy and taught the doctrine as worded in the Pāśupatasūtras. In biblical terms: ‘And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth’ (John 1:14). These Sūtras are therefore seen as divine revelation and Kauṇḍinya’s task it is to proclaim and explain them, that is, like Kuśika before him, to bring the good news. When its contents is fully understood and put into praxis (viddhi), the believer becomes qualified (adhikārakr̥tatva) to receive that grace, which is concomittant with the removal of his separation (viyoga) from God. United with God he shares in His omniscience and omnipotence, and all his suffering comes to an end. He experiences, in Byzantine terms, theˆosis (             ).</p>
<p>The power of the word</p>
<p>Intrinsically connected with the soteriological claim of the Pāśupata faith is the tradition that the holy word is passed down a lineage of accomplished teachers, who all, at the moment that they divulge the truth in the appropriate ritual setting, impersonate the divine incarnation, a doctrine not altogether different from Jesus’ message to his apostles: ‘For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you’ (Matthew 10:20).</p>
<p>However, in my view the Indian type of religion, to which the Pāśupata faith belongs, pushes this idea further than Catholicism, notwithstanding the Fourth Lateran Council and that of Trent on the Eucharist, and this has to do with its concept of primordial sound (śabda). Despite some similarity, but essentially unlike the evangelist John’s logos, the revealed word, or rather its sound, is conceived of as an embodiment of divine power that has, we could say, the magic potency to actualize or reify the divine and to deify those by whose mouths it is pronounced. This feature of the Indian religions, the idea of śabdabrahman, is the legacy of the Vedic brahmins. It has given rise to much hocus-pocus, on the one hand, and to sublime monuments of spirituality on the other. 3</p>
<p>At the same time, this magic potency accounts for the fact that the revelation is not thought to be meant for everybody’s ears. After pronouncing the word</p>
<p>3 As an instance of the former I see the doctrine of the school of the Saiva Siddhānta, ´ which assumes that final release may be obtained through the ritual of initiation, in which the bodily and mental flaws are articulated and magically (i.e. through mantras) collected on a rope in order to be burnt in the sacrificial fire. As an example of the latter may pass Kashmir Saivism, which culminates in the work of the intellectual giant Abhinavagupta.</p>
<p>‘well’ and promising to reveal the divine doctrine, the teacher performs the ini tiation ceremony of the pupil, who has to take off all his worldly insignia (above, p. 513). From now on he should go naked or with a loincloth only, smeared with ashes, and without any personal belongings. Only then the teacher will impart the revelatioṇThis divides the community of Siva worshippers (Māheśvaras) ´ into two, just as in Buddhism—which seems to have been a major source of inspiration to the Pāśupatas anyway: the laymen (laukikas), whose task it is to gather merit by supporting the order of initiates and by worshipping God in the temple, and the elite group of consecrated ascetics. Only these ascetics are entitled to practise in order to obtain union (yogavidhi), which is the main subject of the subsequent Sūtras.</p>
<p>The Pāśupata praxis</p>
<p>The imitatio dei</p>
<p>When we have thus seen the lofty religious ideals promulgated by Kauṇḍinya’s gospel, we may be in for a surprise, when we learn more about the specific practices by which these were believed to be realised. On the whole, these practices can be described as an ever steeper staircase to complete effacement of the phenomenal self. In this respect Kauṇḍinya shares many of the ascetic aims and practices that are known from other Indian religions. In all ascetic movements, whether in India or abroad, self-mortification serves to destroy the ego in the expectation that it makes one more susceptible to the divine. In the brahmanical tradition this is generally seen as the unveiling of a true Self, which is itself thought to be godlike. The Pāśupata doctrine is no exception to this.</p>
<p>The first of five ‘steps of ascension into God’ (gradus ascensionis in Deum), to paraphrase Bonaventura, 4 requires that the initiated ascetic identifies himself with the deity of his devotion by imitating him, an imitatio dei that is en acted in the liturgy within the temple. This concerns some aspects of Siva that ´ are known from the corpus of mythological Sanskrit texts, and this mythol ogy clearly informs the conduct of the ascetic. In this corpus of mythology Siva often appears as a trickster god, whose loud laughter ( ´ aṭṭahāsa) puts his subjects, including his wife, in their proper place.</p>
<p>But there is another side of Siva, more ancient, going directly back to the ´ Vedic form of him as Rudra, namely his association with cattle and the bull in particular. Paśupati, though in Kauṇḍinya’s gospel used as a metaphor for</p>
<p>4 Bonaventura, Itinerarium mentis in Deum, 1.5–6. The five steps in the career of the Pāśupata ascetic are: 1) living within the precincts of a sanctuary and worshipping Siva, 2) moving about and seeking dishonour, 3) retreating within a lonely place for ´ meditation, 4) living in the cremation ground until death, 5) the end of suffering through God’s grace.</p>
<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya 545</p>
<p>‘Lord (pati) of the bound human soul’ (paśu), literally means ‘Lord of Cattle (paśu)’. This is a god of nature and fertility, powerful and terrifying, who joined in with the indigenous phallus cult, which sophisticated brahminical thinking transformed eventually into the abstract liṅga. In this aspect, Siva ´ is associated with the bull, nay, he is the bull. This aspect of his character explains the, at first sight, puzzling injunction in the Pāśupatasūtras where it says, that the initiate should offer, along with laughter, the sound huḍum. (PS 1.8). Kauṇḍinya explains: ‘The word huḍum. : the auspicious noise which resembles that of a bull and which originates from holding the tip of the tongue against the palate, that is what (is meant).’ 5</p>
<p>Just as serious is Siva’s role as ´ fons et origo of the fine arts, in particular of music and dance. 6 One of the Hindu gods best known to Western audiences is probably Siva, king of the dance ( ´ naṭarāja). A God who himself dances and sings, then we have really left the world of the Abrahamic religions! The imitatio dei practice of the aspirant consists in laughing loudly, bellowing, and singing and dancing in trance at the right side of the cult image in the sanctum in worship of God. 7 How could one worship Him better than by mimesis?</p>
<p>The temple worship of the initiated ascetic ends with complete absorption in God by the constant muttering of a prayer (japya), which, seen as a mantra, is, as we have observed above, to be conceived of as His quintessence actualized in the form of sound. This prayer runs:</p>
<p>I resort to the Eternal, Primordial One, Who is Unborn (sadyojāta), glory, glory to the Eternal, Primordial One, Who is Unborn!</p>
<p>In existence after existence, not in too many existences, You should be merciful to me, You from Whom existence springs. 8</p>
<p>The seeking of dishonour</p>
<p>Although the initiate ‘looses himself’, so to speak, in his mimetic worship, this is a temporary state. For the second stage of the ascetic’s career Kauṇḍinya prescribes a behaviour that deepens the effacement of the person by a process of self-mortification that goes further than most of the rivalling practices. I</p>
<p>5 Kauṇḍinya ad PS 1.8. This practice may go back to a Vedic govrata or anaḍudvrata; see Acharya 2013.</p>
<p>6 Bhāratīya-Nāṭyaśāstra, chapter 4. Cf. Long 1971, 77.</p>
<p>7 For the significance of ‘the right side’ in this context see Bakker 2004c; above, pp. 505 ff. 8 My translation follows Kauṇḍinya’s interpretation of PS 1.40–44:</p>
<p>sadyojātaṁprapadyāmi sadyojātāya vai namaḥ|</p>
<p>bhave bhave nātibhave bhajasva mām bhavodbhavaḥk</p>
<p>This verse (Anuṣṭubh) corresponds to Taittirīya Araṅyaka 10.43. It has some variants (see Bisschop 2006a, 7 f.), the most important of which is the reading bhavasva instead of bhajasva. The Mahā-Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad 17.1 (Varenne 1960, 277–78) reads bhavasva. This verse is translated by Varenne 1960, 71, with a little too much Cartesian flavour, as: ‘Je cherge refuge aupr<code>es du nouveau-n´e; hommage au nouveau-n´e! Hommage! Je suis! Je suis! Je n’excelle pas! Sois pour moi! Hommage </code>a celui qui est l’origine de l’existence!’</p>
<p>refer to the notorious doctrine of seeking dishonour (avamāna). To initiate its discussion in his commentary on PS 3.3, reading ‘despised’ (avamatah.), Kauṇḍinya quotes two verses which are in slightly modified form known from older sources, the Mahābhārata (12.222.20–21) and the Manusmr̥ti (2.162– 163).</p>
<p>The wise brahmin should seek dishonour as if it were ambrosia and he should always beware of honour as if it were poisoṇFor, while being despised, he rests in happiness, excluded from all society; a sage should not think of the faults of the other, (but) always of his own evil. (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 3.3)</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya’s quotation of older sources in this context and the fact that this stage of the path to salvation dealing with dishonour disappears soon from the repertoire of Saiva soteriologial texts seem to indicate that we are here con- ´ cerned with an archaic practice accommodated to the early Pāśupata move ment. 9 The practice involves that the aspirant seeks dishonour when, in public and without making himself known as a Pāśupata ascetic,</p>
<p>He should go about as a mad man, who snores, trembles, limps, leches, and acts and speaks improperly, so that he may come to be ill-treated. For a wise man, being ill-treated, accomplishes thereby all asceticism. (PS 3.11–19) 10</p>
<p>It is to the credit of Daniel Ingalls to have put this weird doctrine into a wider perspective by pointing out its similarity with the practice of dishonour (             ) of the Greek Cynics, in an article that appeared in the Harvard Theological Review in 1962, but which remained largely unknown outside a select group of indologists. As Ingalls points out,</p>
<p>Diogenes’ [‘the Dog’ (         )] favourite method of attracting attention and oppro brium, if we are to believe the anecdotes, was by performing in public those acts of nature which should remain hidden: spitting, defecation, and the act of sex. By means of public censure the Cynics sought to attain hardness, apathy and freedom. 11</p>
<p>And we could go further along the path pointed out by Ingalls. I trust that the reader allows me to take him on a little excursus into the Realm of the Holy Fools, a realm explored most recently in a thesis by Jan Hofstra (2008).</p>
<p>Fools through the Ages</p>
<p>A letter of Paul to the Corinthiers is often seen as a point of departure of this phenomenon in Christianity:</p>
<p>9 Oberlies 2000 points out that this practice, as part of the wider context of the brahmodya, is already attested in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2.3.9.9 and that an influence of Cynicism as argued by Ingalls (see below, p. 554) is very unlikely. Cf. Acharya 2013. In Bakker 2011 (below, p. 553 ff.) I argue that the Pāśupata doctrine, practice and iconography (Lakulīśa) are to be conceived as orthogenetic.</p>

<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya 547</p>
<p>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to meṇWe are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. (1 Corintheans 4:9–10)</p>
<p>To what extremes this could evolve, we read, for instance, in the Life of Symeon the Holy Fool by Leontios, bishop of Neapolis, Cyprus (first half of 7th century ad):</p>
<p>His entry into the city of Emesa was as follows. Outside the city the illustrious one found a dead dog on a dunghill. He unleashed his cord, tied it to a leg of the dog, and tugged the animal behind him, while he was running through the city gate near the school. 12 . . . By everything he did he suggested to be mad or unbecoming. . . . He made it his habit, sometimes to limp, sometimes to spring around, or to shuffle on his bottom, or to trip someone up. Sometimes he watched the sky at new moon, upon which he dropped to the ground and began kicking around; sometimes he acted as if he were raving mad. . . . He had become completely incorporeal and innocent with respect to what is appropriate among meṇWhen he wanted to answer a call of nature, it often happened that he was ashamed of nobody and defecated at the market square in full view. . . . The blessed one had reached such a degree of purity and sacrosanctity that he often danced and sprung around, having a harlot on each hand. Etcetera. 13</p>

<p>12 Contra Hofstra 2008, statement 3 (publicly defended at the University of Groningen on 18 September 2008), this scene cannot be explained from the Scala Paradisi 29/ 14, but is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Cynics.</p>
<p>13 English paraphrase after the Dutch translation from the Greek by Aerts and Hokwerda 2006, 90, 92, 98.</p>
<p>We could continue to the yurodivyj ( rodivyi˘) of the Russian Orthodox Church, but it might be wise to return to the Pāśupata and to explain what is common to its tradition of seeking dishonour (avamāna) and apparently similar practices in the Greek and Christian traditions, and what is different. Common to all traditions, it would seem to me, is the feeling of ecstatic power, when freedom from all forms of (social) bondage is experienced, when the social ego is destroyed. It is the         and of which the Cynics speak, and which, for modern man, has been worded brilliantly by Thomas Mann in his Magic Mountain (Der Zauberberg):</p>
<p>Da seine Betrachtungen dumpf und verworren waren, so ist es schwer, sie zu prä zisiereṇHaubtsächlich schien ihm, daß die Ehre bedeutende Vorteile fur sich habe, ¨ aber die Schande nicht minder, ja daß die Vorteile der letzteren geradezu grenzenlo ser Art seieṇUnd indem er sich probeweise in Herrn Albins Zustand versetzte und sich vergegenwärtigte, wie es sein musse, wenn man endg ¨ ultig des Druckes der Ehre ¨ ledig war und auf immer die bodenlosen Vorteile der Schande genoß, erschreckte den jungen Mann ein Gefuhl von w ¨ uster S ¨ ußigkeit, das sein Herz vor ¨ ubergehend ¨ zu noch hastigerem Gange erregte. 14</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya describes at length the supernatural powers that the aspirant at tains in the course of his ascetic training. However, the Sūtras that form the introduction to his treatment of dishonour run: ‘He gives his bad karma to them and from them he takes their good karma.’ (PS 3.8–9). The provocations that apparently heap shame upon the practioner induce a transfer of merit: the provoked bourgeois, who is tricked into mistaking the ascetic for a madman, looses good karma due to his mistake, which karma is booked at the karma credit side of the Pāśupata: a sort of credit swap avant la lettre. This highly individualistic motive, or should we say immoral, selfish ideology, although still well recognizable in its present-day forms, makes the gospel of Kauṇḍinya stand out amongst its sort.</p>
<p>The question arises whether this second stage of the Pāśupata praxis is also to be seen in the perspective of the imitatio dei, which so clearly informed the first one. I think this is possible, although the antinomian praxis evidently had a long history outside the Pāśupata movement. But antinomian behaviour suited certain aspects of Siva very well. From Vedic times Rudra- ´ Siva has been seen as ´ an outsider, a dangerous god that should be kept at a distance. To propitiate him he was given the name ‘the auspicious one’ (i.e. śiva). His provocative and nonconformist conduct is well expressed in one of the paradigmatic Saiva ´ myths: ‘Siva in the Pine Forest’ (Devadāruvana). This myth differs significantly ´ in various sources, but I present here the epitome given by O’Flaherty: 15</p>
<p>Siva then wandered into the Pine Forest, and the wives of the sages there fell in love ´ with him and followed him everywhere. Siva was naked, ithyphallic, dancing, and ´ begging with a skull in his hand. The sages became furious and cursed his liṅga</p>
<p>14 Thomas Mann (1952), Der Zauberberg, 115.</p>
<p>15 O’Flaherty 1973, 32. Cf. below, p. 578.</p>
<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya 549</p>
<p>to fall to the ground. The liṅga fell but began to cause a terrible conflagration; Brahmā and Viṣṇu tried in vain to find the top and bottom of it, and peace was only restored when the sages agreed to worship the liṅga, together with their wives.</p>
<p>Antinomian conduct has remained a feature of Saiva ascetics until the present ´ day.</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya’s eschatology</p>
<p>Like the aspirant, we should leave this provocative, foolish phase in the dis cipline behind us and move on towards the final goal. The next step in the career of the practitioner is to retreat into solitude, which ends in his move to the cremation ground. By chosing this, for ordinary Hindus most pollutive and horrifying place, as his last residence on earth (while still alive), the accom plished Pāśupata saint proves his complete detachment from all earthly things. Like God Himself, he has transcended the relative world of opposites, of pure and impure, of good and evil, and as a monad, steeped in meditation, he awaits the moment that God’s grace will fall upon him and his suffering comes to an end. This signals in the completion of the practice of imitatioṇWith this, at the moment of death, the saint becomes god.</p>
<p>The Pāśupatasūtras finish when the divine speaker, that is Siva the author ´ of the Sūtras, instructs the practitioner in the penultimate stage to meditate on Him by repeating the following prayer:</p>
<p>The Lord of all knowledge/ spells, the Master of all beings/ spirits;</p>
<p>the Overlord of brahman, God (Brahmā), (who is) the Overlord of the demiurge (Brahmā), Eternal Siva (Sadāśiva), He must be (for ever) auspicious ( ´ śiva) toward me! 16</p>
<p>This is followed in the Calcutta manuscript by the syllable om. ,17 which should be seen in this context as a declaration of affirmation, amen, from the side of God. Kauṇḍinya too, although he apparently omits this syllable om. , seems to take this prayer in an eschatological way. The fact that God Himself instructs the devotee to entreat Him to be gracious holds a great promise: the end of suffering is at hand; it will be realized at the moment of death (the last stage) and will be for ever. Typical for Kauṇḍinya’s style, this vision of hope is prompted by a question:</p>
<p>16 TaiA 10.47 (= ¯ Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad 17.5 (Varenne 1960, 285–86)). This mantra/ bra hman is found in PS 5.42–47 with some variatioṇI follow the Calcutta ms (C) that conforms to the TaiA text (Bisschop 2006a, 18): ¯</p>
<p>īśānaḥsarvavidyānām īśvaraḥsarvabhūtānāṁbrahmādhipatir brahmaṇo ’dhipatir brahmā śivo me astu sadāśivom |</p>
<p>17 See Bisschop 2006a, 18. oṁalso in the TaiA text, see note above. ¯</p>
<p>‘Is it so that here (in this gospel), that is in this prayer, only the majesty of the Creator 18 with respect to the created world (kārya) is considered, but not the as pirant’s longing for or obtaining of (Sivahood)?’ The answer is ‘No’. Just because ´ He sees that those who are not yet in His ultimate grace, due to their office of being aspirant, lack Sivahood/blessedness ( ´ aśivatva), while those who have reached (the ultimate) state of being without suffering possess Sivahood/ blessedness, He pro- ´ claims this last Sūtra. The words in this Sūtra ‘(He) must be’ express a wish: he wishes, he is longing, he pursues. . . . And because it is the Eternal Siva (Sadāśiva) ´ who gives the instruction, the state of being without suffering (duḥkhānta) is eter nal. (Here) ends His office of Creator. Therefore it is certain: this end of suffering is for good. (Kauṇḍinya ad PS 5.45–47)</p>
<p>This doctrine, scholastic, technical, and elitist as it may be, of a personal gracious God, who has descended to earth in order to save all those from suffering who have the courage and stamina to give up their own person for the sake of attaining Him, was something of a religious revolution in the first centuries ad in northern India.</p>
<p>In one important aspect the imitatio dei of the Pāśupata differs from other practices of this sort in later Hinduism as well as in Christianity. The imitation of the ascetic is meant to efface all human individuality, to destroy the ego and all worldly sensual experiences. Along this path, accessible only to ascetic virtuosi, the imitatio ends in an aequatio. The human soul, the paśu, as such ceases to exist; it has ‘transubstantiated’ into god. As so many products of the Indian mind, this ideal has never vanished, but remained part and parcel of the Indian cultural heritage. However, it has become relatively marginalized and eclipsed by modern forms of mass devotion, in particular by Vaiṣṇava bhakti.</p>
<p>Modern forms of Hindu devotion</p>
<p>I would like to finish with a few words on these modern forms of Hindu worship. We may say that the idea of the imitation of god as a path to reach him has retained a normative value in Saivism, Vaisnavism and Hinduism in general, ever since its earliest formulation in the Pāśupata religioṇWe have limited ourselves here to an early Saiva movement, but instances of the ´ imitatio dei practice within modern Vaisnavism are not hard to come by.</p>
<p>One could even maintain that the modern devotional schools of Viṣṇu wor ship are nothing but imitations of the divine play (līlā/ krīḍā), be it the sports of Rāma and Sītā in Ayodhyā, or those of Kr̥ṣṇa and Rādhā in Braj. In order to enact the eternal līlā, devotees make pilgrimages to the places where the mythology is believed to be topographically embedded. It is a strategy prac tised by hundreds of millions to remove the painful separation (viraha) of the human soul and God. In contrast to what the Christian pilgrim may experience</p>
<p>18 I read kāraṇa instead of karaṇa.</p>
<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya 551</p>
<p>on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, the imitation of Kr̥ṣṇa in Braj and Vrindavan usually results in great exuberance. Modern Hinduism, in particular Vaiṣṇava bhakti, is a religion celebrating the joys of life rather than its sufferings (cf. above, p. 17). It is this character, unexpected as it may be to some readers, especially after reading this essay—it is this life-affirming attitude, which seeks to imitate the sports of a happy god, that sat in the way of a warm reception by Christian missionaries. It made Hinduism in the eyes of many of them a shallow, silly, and naive religion, a too childish way of life to compare in earnest with the grave and deadly serious, revealed religion whose ceremonialism em phasized the doleful side of life and banished, like the Pāśupata faith, the end of suffering to a realm beyond death.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Comparison is central to the systematic study of religioṇThe comparative method, however, carries a great risk. As the scope widens, the collected insights tend to become more shallow and this not infrequently results in an arid display of learnedness. A balance should be struck between collecting comparable phenomena in different religions and bringing to light the great divisions that do exist, despite superficial resemblances. It will not lead us to the essence of religion, but it will enhance our understanding and debunk absolute claims, since it is due to explode naive ethnocentricity and academic parochialism. Thus is the task of the historian of religion, and this task has been accomplished in an exemplary way by Jan Bremmer in his distinguished career as professor of religious studies.</p>
<p>Many scholars in the humanities today will agree that god as an entity is unwarranted. God is not an ontological category in the sense of an ens realis simum, but a human ideal, that is a mental, social and cultural figuration that gives meaning to life and guides the conduct of the community of believers. As such, the idea of god, which a community creates and sustains, is quintessen tial to the culture of that community. For this reason the study of religion is such a rewarding enterprise: it allows us access to key notions of a culture. A comparative perspective may help to bring these notions into prominence.</p>
<p>I wrote, the conception of god guides the conduct of the believer, and nowhere is this more obvious than in the practice of imitating god. Look at the ritualized behaviour of the believers and you will find their idea of god. Look at the idea of god and you will understand the behaviour. Imitation of god is at the heart of every traditional, religious society, of Christianity as much as of Hinduism. To emulate a happy god brings greater happiness among the faithful; to emulate a suffering god may offer more consolation in our dark est hours, or, in the words of the Goncourt brothers (1 December 1860): ‘La religion chr´etienne sert quand on pleure.’ 19</p>

<p>Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement∗ About Heracles, Lakulīśa and Symbols of Masculinity</p>
<p>Lagud ¯ .i</p>
<p>The study of the origins of organized Saivism received a completely new per spective with the publication of the Pāśupatasūtras (PS) and Kauṇḍinya’s com mentary thereon, the Pañcārthabhāṣya, by R̥Ananthakrishna Sastri in 1940. Research by Minoru Hara, Daniel Ingalls, Alexis Sanderson, Thomas Oberlies, Peter Bisschop, and Diwakar Acharya, to mention just the major players in this field, built on this new evidence and has paved the way for our present investigation, which draws heavily on their work. 1</p>
<p>For the last fifteen years we have also been fortunate to possess another source that comes from the same Pāśupata tradition and is chronologically not too far removed from Kauṇḍinya. This text reflects the layman’s, laukika, view, rather than that of the initiated ascetic, who is the primary person treated by Kauṇḍinya. This text is the Skandapurāṇa (SP), whose composition we date between ad 550 and 650, which means that the text is probably about 200 years later than Kauṇḍinya’s commentary. Much had happened in India in those 200 years: it saw the rise and fall of the great Gupta Empire, the intrusion of Hunnic peoples, and the gradual recovery of centralized power in the new capital Kanauj (Kanyakubja) under the Maukharis and the great Harṣavardhana of Thanesar.</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes us, when we compare the Skandapurāṇa’s account of the well-known descent of Siva in Kāyāvataran ´ . a (called Kārohaṇa in SP and known today as Karvan in Gujarat) with that given by Kauṇḍinya, is that the uniqueness of this mystical event is no longer maintained. Reflecting the general Hindu and Buddhist conception of the time, viz. that a Buddha or a god incarnates on earth again and again in various forms and persons, the Skandapurāṇa makes Siva’s descent in Gujarat a cyclic event: each world period ´</p>

<p>(yuga) had its own incarnation: Bhārabhūti in the Kr̥tayuga, Diṇḍimuṇḍa in the Tretā, As ¯ .āḍhi in the Dvāpara, and Lāguḍi in our Kali Age. 2 Another development that apparently took place or gained prominence in the 5th to 6th centuries is that the avatāra story in Kārohaṇa itself was revised. God is said in the Skandapurāṇa to have been born into the house of a certain Somaśarman, who is said to belong to the lineage of the r̥ṣi Atri, father of Soma, the Moon. 3 This new tradition may have been invented to account for a lineage of Pāśupata teachers who traced their pedigree back to Somaśarman, a topic that I have discussed in my paper Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and So masiddhānta (above, p. 283 ff.). The Skandapurāṇa is, in all likelihood, the first extant text that attests the name Lāguḍi (variant: Lākulin), meaning ‘club bearer’ (laguḍa/lakuṭa: ‘club’; see above, p. 529). However, this relatively late first attestation of the name ‘club bearer’ does not preclude the possibility that the association of this incarnation with the attribute of the club is much older. For this we have some indications.</p>
<p>Early images of a club bearing ascetic or teacher</p>
<p>To begin with, there is an image found in Mathurā, 4 usually dated to the third century ad on stylistic grounds, of a rather glum-faced, club-bearing ascetic. This figure might represent, either an ascetic associated with the Pāśupata sect, or—less likely, because characteristic iconographic signs are absent—the incarnation of Siva himself (Plate 121). ´ 5</p>
<p>Secondly, the American scholar Daniel Ingalls, who compared the Pāśupata sect with the school of the Greek Cynics, broke new ground in his paper Cynics and Pāśupata: the Seeking of Dishonor, when he conjectured that the name Lakulīśa, the Lāguḍi of the Skandapurāṇa, may have been derived from the Greek name Heracles,           , ‘if it lost its first syllable in order to help out a folk etymology’. 6 If this were correct, it might point to an (iconographic) influence of the Hellenistic school of the Cynics, whose patron saint was the club-bearing Heracles, on the movement of the Pāśupata.</p>
<p>Ingalls’ wider suggestion, namely that the Pāśupata practice of seeking dis honour may have originated under the influence of the Cynics, has been met with scepticism by contemporary scholarship. Thomas Oberlies (2000) argued in his Kriegslisten und ungeziemendes Benehmen: Die Askesepraktiken der Pāśupatas that antinomian praxis, as part of the context of the brahmodya, is already attested in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (2.3.9.9); the influence of Cynicism in this particular respect, something that was conjectured by Ingalls, is there fore not required to explain the phenomenoṇThough it may indeed be the case that the Pāśupata antinomian praxis in the second stage of the ascetic’s</p>

<p>Mathurā: Club-bearing ascetic Mathurā: Lakulīśa</p>
<p>career is an orthogenetic Indian development, the eponymous attribute of the saint, the laguḍa or club, remains as yet unexplained. Let us reconsider the earliest iconographic evidence.</p>
<p>The laguḍa or club</p>
<p>The first unquestionable visual representation of the divine Saiva teacher with ´ the attribute of the club is a fifth-century image from Mathurā. This sculpture is understood to be an image of Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa (Plate 122). 7 For rea son of comparison, and in order to explore further Ingalls’ supposedly Greek connection, I would like to draw attention to an image of Heracles found in A¨ı Khanum on the Darya-i Pandj River. This little bronze statuette (height: 18.2 cm) from the National Museum of Afghanistan (G 04.42.8) has been on display in the Mus´ee Guimet (Paris) in 2007 and has since been touring in Europe and the USA (Plate 123). 8</p>
<p>The natural gnarls, which usually characterize Heracles’ cudgel and which in stylized form are visible on the club of the A¨ı-Khanum Heracles, resemble the phallic line pattern on the club of the Mathurā image (Plate 125): a Greek symbol of masculinity encounters an Indian symbol of virility.</p>
<p>7 Meister (ed.) 1984: plate 82.</p>
<p>8 Afghanistan 2008, 113: plate 14.</p>
<p>A¨ı Khanum, whose excavation by a French mission began in 1965, represents an important Hellenistic city founded in the wake of Alexander’s conquests in Central Asia (329–27 bc). 9 This city, possibly Ptolemy’s ‘Alexandria on the Oxus’, 10 was once the centre of a hybrid culture in which East met West.</p>

<p>This is clear from, among other things, coins found of the Indo-Greek king Agathokles (c. 170 bc). They show two Indian deities, who have been identi fied as Vāsudeva (Kr̥ṣṇa), obverse, and Saṁkarṣaṇa (Balarāma), reverse. As Härtel has observed, ‘these coins are the oldest examples at all of the pictorial representation of Hinduistic gods, a fact which cannot be emphasized enough’. 11</p>

<p>Elements of the syncretistic culture of Bactria reached western India with the entrance into the Subcontinent of Saka tribes, who built a kingdom from ´ Mathurā to southern Gujarat in the last decades before the Common Era. That Heracles remained a popular figure there till Kuṣāṇa rule is attested, for instance, by the so-called Hercules-type of coins of the Saka ruler Rajuvula (1st ´ quarter 1st cenṭad), some of which were found in Mathurā, 12 and a second century ad image of Heracles and the Nemeian Lion, which was also found in Mathurā (Plate 124). 13</p>

<p>The head of Herakles is unfortunately wanting; but the pose and muscular develop ment of the body are infinitely superior to any purely Indian sculpture that I have seeṇHerakles has his left arm wound about the lion’s neck, while with his right he is raising the club, which appears behind his back, to strike a blow. The raised arm is also gone. The lion is rather a weak animal. The group is not cut in the round, but is an altro-relievo with a rough back, and has apparently formed one side of an altar.</p>
<p>Cf. Harle 1986, 67 f. The ‘Indian Heracles’ of Greek sources, mentioned by Megasthenes et al., is mostly identified as Kr̥ṣṇa, a deity very well at home in Mathurā (Karttunen 1989, 211 f.).</p>
<p>The origin of the Pāśupata movement</p>
<p>The Pāśupata movement originated under Saka hegemony in that part of India ´ where the figure of Heracles was known at the time. If the iconography of Heracles had exerted some influence on, or had moulded the figure of the club bearing divine teacher, we would have expected this to become apparent in the sources that date to the period in which both, the figure of Heracles and the Pāśupata teacher, existed side by side, viz. the first centuries of the Common Era. However, neither our oldest source, the Pāśupatasūtras, nor Kauṇḍinya’s commentary knows, either the club as an attribute, or the name Lāguḍi. 14 Ingalls’ hypothesis, therefore, which assumes that the Greek Heracles launched the Indian Lakulīśa, is just as unlikely as his assumption that the Hellenistic school of the Cynics influenced the development of the Pāśupata practice.</p>
<p>An orthogenetic root of the club-bearing deity seems therefore to be more obvious. The Amarakośa (3.3.42) mentions laguḍa as a synonym of daṇḍa. It is but natural to conceive of the club as a variant of the traditional stick or staff (daṇḍa) of the brahmin ascetic. The earliest Pāśupata monument known to us, the Mathurā Pilaster of Candragupta II of the Gupta Year 61, i.e. ad 380 (above, Plate 112), 15 depicts a naked three-eyed figure with a daṇḍa in his right, and what is possibly a kamaṇḍalu in his left hand (Plate 126). 16</p>
<p>Plate 126</p>
<p>Daṇḍapāṇi on Mathurā pilaster, ge 61</p>
<p>14 The Mahābhārata knows the Pāśupata sect, its vow (vrata), doctrine (jñāna), and prac tice (yoga); it also knows the Pāśupata weapon (astra), which Siva gave to Arjuna; for ´ this weapon see below, p. 567. Lāguḍi/Lakulīśa is unknown to the MBh and so is his club.</p>
<p>15 CII III (1981), 240.</p>
<p>16 The identity of this figure is disputed. That we are concerned with a divine figure follows from the third eye. Acharya 2005, 209 proposes to read the name of this deity as Caṇḍa. My designation ‘Daṇḍapāṇi’ is descriptive, it is not the proper name of the deity.</p>
<p>29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement 559</p>
<p>Admittedly, the origin of the word laguḍa/lakuṭa—attested, for instance, in Manusmr̥ti (8.315) and Mahābhārata (7.29.16) in the sense of ‘cudgel’ or ‘club’—remains as yet unclear. 17 But even if we do not accept Przyluski’s etymology that links the word to the Austro–Asiatic lāṅgula, meaning ‘stick’ or ‘penis’, 18 we may assume that phallic symbolism easily suggested itself to the Indian mind and came to be associated with this particular attribute. The phallic shape of the club in the earliest representations of the divine teacher, evident from the line pattern and its upright position (Plate 125), may have been prompted by the ithyphallic nature of this teacher and his prototype, Siva. Thus, the club may have replaced the ascetic ´ daṇḍa, by virtue of its more outspoken phallic, i.e. Saiva connotation. ´ 19 The name Lāguḍi, ‘club-bearer’, in Skandapurāṇa (SPS 167.129), Laguḍīśvara in SPS 167.169 (interpolation), Lākuli in Niśvāsamukha 3.19 (Kafle 2015, 149) and Lakulīśa, i.e. ‘Lord of the club-bearers’, in slightly later sources, e.g. the Guhyasūtra (12.18) of the Niśvāsatattvasaṁhitā, derive all from this eponymous attribute. 20</p>
<p>The four disciples</p>
<p>Another major development (in addition to the invention of the figure of Lāguḍi) that took place in the 4th to 6th centuries is also attested by the Skandapurāṇa: Kuśika is no longer the only disciple. The number of disciples that is said to have been initiated by Lāguḍi himself has increased to four. These four are considered to have a semi-divine status; our text declares them to have sprung from the four faces of God (Parameśāna), out of His desire to bestow grace (anugraha) upon the world:</p>
<p>17 See Manfred Mayrhofer, EWA ṣv. ‘lakuṭa’: ‘Nicht erklärt’.</p>
<p>18 Turner, CDIAL ṣv. ‘lakuṭa’: ‘Ac. to J. Przyluski Pre-Aryan in sense “penis” is of same origin as lāṅgula &amp;c ← Austro-as.; but prob. same word as “stick”.’ Cf. Mayrhofer, KEWA ṣv.</p>
<p>19 The Atharvavedapariśiṣṭa 40, dealing with the Pāśupatavrata, contains the following interesting passage, specifying what should be given to the initiated brahmin:</p>
<p>tato ’sya mauñjiṁprayacchati k</p>
<p>sāvitryā tu daṇḍaṁpālāśaṁbailvam āśvatthaṁvāsiṁlakuṭaṁkhaṭvāṅgaṁparaśuṁvā k (40.3.2) For translation and explicatory notes see Bisschop &amp; Griffiths 2003, 331 f. These authors date this text to the 2nd half of the 1st millennium (op. cit. 324).</p>
<p>20 Lakulīśanātha in the Malhar (Junvānī) Copperplates of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57 (above, p. 290). The names Lakulin/Lakulīśa/Lakuladhārin are also known to the Pāśupatavidhi texts discovered and published by Diwakar Acharya; for instance the Saṁskāravidhi (Acharya 2007). The name ‘Nakulin/Lakulin’ is known from the list of 28 incarnations of Siva as given in the ´ Vāyupurāṇa 1.23 and Liṅgapurāṇa 1.24. However, as Bisschop 2006, 43 ff. has argued convincingly ‘this list of twenty-eight avatāras did not yet form part of that text [i.e. the Vāyupurāṇa] at the time of composition of the Skandapurāṇa’. The earliest attestation of a group of ascetics named Lākuḍas seems to be a graffito on Mount Kālañjara (Bakker 2014, 196).</p>
<p>You four should descend to earth to become twice-born ascetics.</p>
<p>And after having led the brahmins to the supreme station,</p>
<p>you, O masters of yoga, should return to Me. (SPS 167.120)</p>
<p>The first disciple, Kuśika/Kauśika, is born in Ujjain and initiated there by Siva’s incarnation himself, just as is in Kaun ´ . ḍinya’s version of the story (above, n. 7 on p. 529 and p. 542). But the venue has changed. The initiation according to the Skandapurāṇa takes place in the cremation ground instead of a temple. The Lord, smeared with ashes, is said to hold a firebrand (ulmuka) in his left hand (SPS 167.127 f.). This seems appropriate for a cremation ground and may suggest that the initiation included branding. Although it is tempting to hypothesize that the ascetic’s club has been mistakenly interpreted for what was originally a firebrand, this hypothesis has to be discarded, not only because of what has been said above, but also, more importantly, because images of Lakulīśa with a firebrand have never come to light and the ulmuka is elsewhere never mentioned as one of his potential attributes. On the other hand, the firebrand as an attribute is found in some later images of Siva as a teacher, in ´ his so-called ‘Dakṣiṇāmūrti’. 21</p>
<p>The ancient cremation ground in Ujjain has been identified. Locally known as Kumhār T. ekḍī, this site was the subject of preliminary explorations by ṀB. Garde in the season of 1938–39. Discovered there were skeletons in sitting posture, reflecting the normal way of interning yogins. Kuśika may have been one of them. 22 The specification of these four disciples in the Skandapurāṇa allows us to catch a glimpse of the spread and ramification of the movement; it will be our subject in the final part of this essay.</p>

<p>29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement 561</p>
<p>Spread and ramification of the Pāśupata movement</p>
<p>From the Mathurā Pilaster of ad 380 we deduce that the Pāśupata movement had spread from South Gujarat to Mathurā before the end of the fourth cen tury. This is true for at least one tradition of gurus, the so-called ‘Vaimalas’, who traced their pedigree also directly back to Kuśika. In an image found in Mathurā that might be slightly later than the pilaster, the ithyphallic divine teacher—who, to judge by his attribute, is to be identified as Lāguḍi—is shown with two disciples (above, Plate 118). 23 Evidently the Kuśika lineage (param parā) as attested in Kauṇḍinya’s commentary needed to compete with one or more rival traditions that also claimed direct descent from Siva’s incarnation. ´ 24</p>
<p>The Skandapurāṇa’s account of the four disciples of Lāguḍi, which would become the standard, reflects this bifurcation, which may have started already in the 4th century, if not earlier. The earliest known image that shows four disciples seated around a divine teacher, however, comes only in the 6th century (Plate 128); it is found ‘above the doorway in the east vestibule to the great cave at Yogeśvarī near Bombay’, which is dated by Walter Spink to c. ad 525. 25</p>
<p>Plate 128</p>
<p>Yogeśvarī Cave (Mumbai): Lakulīśa with four disciples</p>

<p>24 Cf. above, n. 6 on p. 529 and p. 541.</p>
<p>25 Spink 1983, 243. Shah 1984, 88. The divine figure in the Yogeśvarī Cave seems to be four-armed: the left upper hand holds the rosary, the left lower hand the club, the right lower hand seems to make a vyākhānamudrā, whereas the right upper arm is missing (cf. Shah 1984, 98). This early Saiva monument, just as the monuments at Mandapesvar ´ and Elephanta, shows the flourishing of the Pāśupata movement in the middle of the 6th century, when the movement’s home country came under the control of the early Kalacuris, who extended their rule to the northern Konkan, where these monuments are preserved (Spink 1983; cf. Mirashi in CII IV.1, xlvi f., cxlvii f.). The Kalacuri king Kr̥ṣṇarāja in an inscription of his son (Sam ´ . karagaṇa) datable to ad 597, is said to have been devoted to Paśupati from the day of his birth (janmana eva paśupatisamāśraya paraḥ, CII IV.1, 41).</p>
<p>The account in the Skandapurāṇa tells us that the third disciple, who was initiated in Mathurā, was named Mitra. No doubt there were many Mitras in Mathurā, but the mentioning of this name in this context may betray some historical awareness of the fact that the city of Mathurā, before the coming of the Sakas, had been governed by a Mitra dynasty. ´ 26 Making a (legendary) Mitra the fountainhead of a lineage of Pāśupata gurus in Mathurā would only add to the authenticity of this tradition.</p>
<p>The Skandapurāṇa suggests that before the Pāśupata teachers had settled in Mathurā, the movement had reached the city of Jambumārga, to be located between Ujjayanī and Mathurā. 27 In this city, the divine incarnation is said to have initiated his second disciple Gārgya. The exact location of Jambumārga is unknown, but it must have been an important Saiva centre. Professor Tsuchida ´ (Tokyo) has suggested to me that it may be the town called Mo-hi-shi-fa-lo pu-lo, Maheśvarapura, visited by Xuanzang in the first quarter of the seventh century. The chinese pilgrim describes the place as follows.</p>
<p>The produce of the soil and the manners of the people are like those of the kingdom of Ujjayanˆı. They greatly esteem the heretics and do not reverence the law of the Buddha. There are several tens of Dˆeva temples, and the sectaries principally belong to the Pˆasupatas. The king is of the Brˆahman caste; he places but little faith in the doctrine of Buddha. 28</p>
<p>The itinerary of the Chinese pilgrim suggests that Maheśvarapura lay on the route from Ujjain to the north through Chitor, that is on the axis Ujjain, Mandasor, Chitor, Puṣkara, Mathurā. 29 The research of Elizabeth Cecil (2016, 150 ff.) has shown that the salt lake region north of Puṣkara, around Sikar– Sambhar, traditionally known as Sapādalakṣa, in particular the excavation site at Naliasar, 6 km from Sāmbhar (Sākambharī), may be another good candidate ´ for Jambumārga.</p>
<p>In between Puṣkara and Ujjain is the village presently known as Nagarī, corresponding to the ancient town of Mādhyamika, which is located near Chitor (Xuanzang’s Chi-ki-to) in RajasthaṇJust as in Maheśvarapura, Xuanzang reports a strong Saiva presence in Chi-ki-to: ‘There are about ten Dˆeva temples, ´ which some thousand followers frequent’ (Beal II, 271). The archaeological remains in Nagarī (Mādhyamika) testify to its importance as a Saiva centre in ´ the 5th and 6th centuries, predating Chitor. 30 We discuss the Nagarī remains in more detail elsewhere. 31</p>

<p>27 Cf. Bisschop 2006, 209.</p>
<p>28 Xuanzang in Beal II, 271.</p>
<p>29 See also Deloche 1980 I, 60 &amp; Fig. 8. This appears to be the same route that is described in the Tīrthayātrāparvan (MBh 3.80.59–71). Another candidate for Maheśvarapura has been proposed by Michael Willis (1997, 17), who identifies this place with the village of Shivpur (Shivpuri/Sipri), c. 100 km west of Jhansi (MP), c. 240 km south of Mathurā.</p>
<p>30 An image of Lakulīśa with four disciples is found built into the Rampol Gate of Chitor garh, which is dated to ‘ca. seventh century’ by Shah 1984, 97 f., Pl. 84.</p>

<p>29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement 563</p>
<p>The route along which the Pāśupata religion moved north</p>
<p>Combining the evidence and the above conjectures, tentative as much of it may be, we could try to reconstruct the route along which the Pāśupata reli gion moved north in the fourth century. Coming from Karvan in Gujarat, and after having established itself in Ujjain in Western Malwa (Madhya Pradesh), it moved northwards along the ancient caravan route that connected the port of Bharukaccha (Bharuch) at the mouth of the Narmadā River, through Uj jain, with Puṣkara in Rajasthan and the town of Mathurā further-on in Uttar Pradesh. On this route Jambumārga, Maheśvarapura, became a Pāśupata stronghold like Ujjain and Mathurā (Figure 15).</p>
<p>The movement did not end in Mathurā. The Skandapurāṇa speaks of the fourth disciple of Lāguḍi as a man born in the Kuru country, i.e. Kurukṣetra, but it stops short of mentioning him by name (see above, p. 527). This puruṣa issued from the fourth face of Siva is said to have been initiated by Lāgud ´ . i in Kanyakubja, the city of Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (SPS 167, 129). We take this as an indication that Kanauj had become another important centre of the Pāśupata sect in the 5th or 6th century. The explicit mentioning of the birth of the fourth disciple in the Land of the Kurus strongly suggests that this region too, with its capital Thanesar (Sthāneśvara), had become a mainstay of the new faith. The rise of the city of Kanauj as the political (and cultural) capital of Northern India in the 6th century, made that it became the base from where the movement spread over North India and beyond, into Magadhā, Nepal and Southeast Asia (Cambodia).</p>
<p>The origin of a pan-Indian religion</p>
<p>The Skandapurāṇa describes the four disciples, after they had been initiated (anugr̥hya), as apostles of the Pañcārtha doctrine.</p>
<p>Lāguḍi (the divine incarnation) bestowed on them ‘His own doctrine’ (Svasiddhā nta) and yoga, and spoke:</p>
<p>This is the final mystical teaching known as Pañcārtha. It has been proclaimed to you in order that you liberate the brahmins from the fetters of death. You should make the brahmins reach the highest station by initiating them (in this teaching). Your dwelling places shall be on sacred river banks, in holy sanctu aries, as well as in deserted houses and forests, excluded from society.</p>
<p>Having heard this word of Lord Paśupati Himself, all these four disciples, being enlightened by God, did as they were told. 32</p>
<p>To pursue the further course of the Pāśupata religion will remain a future task. I would like to conclude by briefly illustrating how a possibly historic, and</p>
<p>32 SPS 167.129cd–132. Above, p. 527 and n. 3 on p. 528.</p>
<p>in many respects unique, mystical event, the religious enlightenment of the brahmin saint Kuśika in Ujjain, developed into a pan-Indian cult of Lakulīśa. The author Kauṇḍinya gives the impression of still being in direct touch with the origins of the movement. He relates how the divine incarnation reached Ujjain by foot, a touching detail, and suggests that the authenticity of this event can be confirmed by the still visible traces that have been left behind. 33 In the two hundred years between Kauṇḍinya and the composition of the Skandapurā ṇa great developments had taken place. There had risen a number of gurus, no doubt rivals with one another, who claimed that their respective lineages (paramparā) hailed back to a disciple of the divine incarnatioṇTo unite them,</p>
<p>the idea of multiple disciples—first two, and then four—was invented. In an orthogenetic process—or, less likely, a heterogenetic one through the influence of the Hellenistic figure of Heracles—the divine incarnation who was believed to have initiated these four disciples somehow came to be called Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa. Once the idea was accepted that this Lāguḍi had operated not only in Kārohaṇa and Ujjain, but had initiated in Saiva centres such as Jambu- ´ mārga, Mathurā and another as far off as Kanyakubja, there was no longer a reason not to claim that he had operated in other places as well. The last vestige of historicity vanished. It was replaced by the belief that there had been incarnations of Siva in all world periods: Lakulīśa was just one of them. ´ And why should God limit his range to western India? This new view is evident in a passage in the Skandapurāṇa that has been shown by Peter Bisschop to be an interpolation in the earliest extant recension of the text, the one preserved in Nepal (SPS). 34 This passage runs as follows:</p>
<p>Tradition has it that there are eight holy places of Siva ( ´ Saśimaulin) in the land of ´ Magadhā, through which Laguḍīśvara wandered, surrounded by his pupils. When one has visited those, a man will be at once redeemed from sins. 35</p>
<p>Thus developed an elitist faith of ascetic virtuosi into a catholic religioṇThe anonymous saviour of Kauṇḍinya turned into just another manifestation of the divine, his worship into just another form of Siva devotion. ´</p>
