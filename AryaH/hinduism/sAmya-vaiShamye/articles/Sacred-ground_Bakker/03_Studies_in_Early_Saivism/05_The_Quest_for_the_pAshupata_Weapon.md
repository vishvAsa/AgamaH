The Gateway of the Mahādeva Temple at 

Madhyamikā (Nagarī) 

Hans Bakker & Peter Bisschop 

Introduction 

The village of Nagarī is situated in the Chittorgarh District (Rajasthan), 11 km north of the famous fort. The present archaeological site lies to the south of the village on the right bank of the River Berach. The original citadel along the river extended further northwards and included the space presently occupied by the village (Plate 129).

The remains of the Mahādeva Temple are found in the southern part of the archaeological site (Plate 130).

These remains consist of a reconstructed brick platform surrounded by some stray pieces of architecture: parts of a dhvajastambha (pillar), pillar capitals having bull and lion, a pedestal, an architrave of a toraṇa, a beam with gavākṣas and makara, and a toraṇa post (Plate 131).

Before we discuss the iconography of the toraṇa, we will give a brief sketch of the historical setting of the site. 

The history of the Nagarī site 

Inscriptions and coins 

Many coins are reported to have come from Nagarī. Bhandarkar found in his ex cavations sixteen legible punch-marked coins pertaining to the Sibi-janapada. ´ The legend of these coins reads: majhimikāya śibijanapadasa.2 Bhandarkar (op. cit. 123 f.), following an earlier suggestion by Kielhorn, identified this Ma jhimikā ‘with the Madhyamikā mentioned by Patañjali as having been invested in his time by a Yavana king’, 3 and takes it to be the old name of Nagarī. He 

1 For another, well-preserved example of such a gateway from the same period and area, compare the tall post found at Khilchipura, now at Mandasor Fort (below, p. 573). Joanna Williams (1982, 142) draws attention to the striking similarity; she considers the Khilchipura piece to be slightly later.

3 Patañjali ad P. 3.2.111: aruṇad yavano madhyamikām.

translates the legend as ‘Coin of the Sibi ´ janapada of the Madhyamikā country’. This distinguishes the Sibis of Nagarī from those of the Punjab. Bhandarkar ´ (and historians after him) had little doubt that Madhyamikā ‘was the old name of Nagarī and also the district around it’. 4 

Five inscriptions have been reportedly found in Nagarī and surroundings, one of them is the famous Ghoṣūṇḍī Well Stone Inscription,5 recording the establish ment of a stone enclosure around the Nārāyaṇa Vāṭikā, which was dedicated to the two gods Saṁkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva. The site of this Vāṭikā has been identified by Bhandarkar (1920, 128 ff.) with the so-called Elephant Pen of Ak bar (Hāthī-bāḍā), ‘half a mile east of the village [Nagarī]’. Bhandarkar found here, among other things, a stone with grafitto reading: śrīviṣṇupādābhyāṁin seventh-century characters. 6 

For our present purpose, the inscription reportedly found ‘not far from the shrine of Mahādeva’ is of greater relevance. It is dated 481 in the Kr̥ta (= Vikrama) Era, corresponding to ad 424. It records ‘the erection of a temple to Vishnu by the three Baniā brothers’, Satyaśūra, Srugandha (Srīgandha ?) ´ and Dāsa, and thus testifies to a Viṣṇu temple, established at or near the site of the Mahādeva temple during the reign of Emperor Kumāragupta. 7 At this time Western Mālava was under control of the feudatory Early Aulikara prince (nr̥pati) Viśvavarman, who was ruling from Daśapura (Mandasor), c. 100 km to the south of Nagarī. 8 

Some fragments belonging to the Gupta period were discovered by Bhan darkar in the area: two capitals of pillars with addorsed lions and bulls (in the Kaṅkālī Mātā shrine in Nagarī village). Other pillars and images were found c. 4 km southeast of Nagarī at the shrine of Sāḍū Mātā. 9 

One more inscribed stone relevant to our present discussion was found in Chittorgarh in 1959, ‘while clearing debris in the fort area’. This stone, con taining two brief fragmentary, but related inscriptions, was published by Sircar 

4 Bhandarkar 1920, 123 f. 

5 The Ghoṣūṇḍī village lies c. 6 km NE of Nagarī, but the inscribed stone came originally from the so-called Hāthī-bāḍā at Nagarī. There exist apparently three copies of this inscription, one still in situ. EI 16, 25–27; EI 22, 198–205; Sircar in SI I, 90 f.: ‘2nd half of the 1st cent. BC’. 

6 Bhandarkar 1920, 129; Agrawala 1987. 

7 Bhandarkar 1920, 121. The text of this inscription has not been published, although it is referred to in several publications. We only know about the basic contents of this inscription from Bhandarkar’s original descriptioṇAccording to Bhandarkar it was ‘deposited in the Rajputana Museum, Ajmer’. Although the line of the inscription that mentions the Kr̥ta Era has been extensively discussed in CII III (1981), 192 ff., and the inscription clearly falls within the category of ‘Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings’, the editors of the revised edition of Volume III of the CII (B. Chhabra & G.ṢGai) refrain from including and editing this inscription in their volume, nor do they give any more information about the inscription itself and its whereabouts. It shows again the limited value of this ‘revised edition’.

and Gai in Epigraphia Indica 34 (1961–62). The second inscription attests to the building of a temple, which was, in all likelihood, dedicated to Siva, since ´ the maṅgala verse speaks of ‘the one who hides the moon in the pile of his curling, tawny matted locks’. 10 Its construction seems to have been commis sioned by a rājasthānīya or viceroy who was ruling in Daśapura and Madhyamā. The (Siva) temple is said to be located to the north of the (Vis ´ .ṇu) temple of Manorathasvāmin. 11 

Madhyamā has been identified with Madhyamikā, and the rājasthānīya, son of Viṣṇudatta and grandson of Varāha(dāsa), belonged to the powerful mer chant (Naigama) family that kept the office of chief minister or viceroy un der the Later Aulikara kings of Daśapura, in particular Prakāśadharman and Yaśodharman (between ad 510 and 533). 12 The two Chittorgarh inscriptions belong to this period and record the importance of the Madhyamā/Madhya mikā province within the kingdom of Daśapura in the first four decades of the sixth century. They also testify to shifting religious affiliations amongst re gional rulers: the Early Aulikaras, like their Gupta overlords, were Vaiṣṇavas; the Later Aulikaras, who came to power after the turbulent period that saw the fall of the Gupta Empire, were devotees of Siva. It would seem that the ´ archaeological remains in Nagarī reflect this revolution. 

The fort of Chittorgarh dates from the post-Aulikara period, when Daśapura and Madhyamikā had lost their prominence. It is conceivable that the inscribed stone slab came from nearby Nagarī along with other materials, when the newly built fort provided safety to a successor state, possibly that of the Mori Rajputs (Mauryas) in the seventh century. 13 

Archaeology 

Excavations at Nagarī were conducted by ḌR̥Bhandarkar in the ‘second decade of the [20th] century’, and after him by K.V. Soundara Rajan in 1962– 63. 14 The archaeological situation is summed up by R̥P. Sharma in A. Ghosh’s Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, volume II ṣv. ‘Nagari’. 

[. . . ] Three periods were distinguished, the first two being anterior to the stone fortification and seemingly without baked-brick structures, though limestone struc tures were knowṇThey had both red and grey wares; the occurrence of the NBPW was negligible, though associated red ware was available. The settlement seems to have originated in c. 400 B.C. [. . . ] Period III was marked by the presence of the Red Polished Ware. The other finds of the site include terracotta human and ani mal figures in Suṅga and Gupta styles [. . . ] The fortification probably originated ´ in Gupta times.

The main site of Bhandarkar’s excavation was around the small Mahādeva Temple. This temple itself is of recent date, but the installed liṅga may be old (Plate 134).

Liṅga of Mahādeva Temple 

The structure exposed in the excavations consists of a square brick platform (Plate 135). 

  



Plate 135 

Excavated brick platform in Nagarī 







30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon 573 

It will be seen from the plan that the east side was unlike the other sides of the platform and shows that it and its superstructure faced that directioṇThe max imum height preserved of its moulded walls is 4’ [122 cm] and is found in the west wall. This seems to be nearly half of the original height of the platform. Though the upper half of its walls has fallen down, it appears from the terracottas picked up from the d´ebris, to have been covered with decorative tiles of at least three types, some of them probably arranged in string courses. One type is represented by what may be styled bird terracottas. [. . . ] 

The centre of the platform was originally occupied by a superstructure, very little of which has now survived. It is 43’ 6” [13.30 m] square at the base. Immediately below each side of this square is a foundation wall, 6’ [1.80 m] thick. [. . . ] Of the superstructure only the lowermost moulding has been preserved, which is nearly two feet high. (Bhandarkar 1920, 135 f.) 

The original temple of the Gupta period may have been of brick, but, as ob served by Bhandarkar (op. cit. 138), ‘to the second period of additions charac terised by the introduction of stone work, or possibly to a period slightly later, belong the remains of a stone toraṇa exhumed in front of the mound’. It is this toraṇa which is the subject of this article. 

The toraṇa of the Mahadeva Temple ¯ 

In describing this gateway Joanna Williams (1982, 140 f.) observed that, 

The most impressive carvings at Nagarī are the remains of a gigantic gateway or toraṇa that must belong to the early sixth century on the basis of its relationship to works from Mandasor. The decorative side face of the post bears fluted bands and medallions [Plate 136], which elaborate upon forms found at Mukundara. 

Passing through the temple gateway is entering a new world. The toraṇa as such epitomizes the rite of passage and the symbolism of this rite informs the iconography of the gateway (below, p. 599). It begins with the gatekeeper and his trident at the bottom of the gate post, eastern side, at the entry of the temple compound, which is oriented toward the east (Plate 137). 15 

15 That this is the eastern, that is entry side, follows from the fact that it has the figure of a Dvārapāla, and because it fits only the eastern face of the architrave. The latter face is the eastern one, because it contains a Dakṣiṇāmūrti, which would be without meaning if it faced west (Bakker 2004c), and an image of Siva in meditation (Yogeśvara), which ´ should likewise face east. It also seems to follow from the iconographic programme of the architrave itself, which begins, as we will see, in the panels at the entrance, that is the eastern side, and continues with the panels at the exit, that is the western side.

Just as Bhandarkar, Williams assumes that the fragment with candraśālā arches lying near the architrave is part of a second tier of the toraṇa (Plate 138). She observed that ‘the top half of the double-candraśālā arches have di agonal projections from their lower corners, a detail mentioned as characteristic of pieces found in Deogarh’. 16

Reconstruction of the architrave of the gateway, facing east 

The upper cross-beam had makara heads at each end with architectural representa tions on the cross-lintel that show dvibhūma Phāṁsanā structures [i.e. ‘tiered, pyra midal roof-type’] faced with candraśālās and with small, square, stone platforms sur porting globular āmalakas represented to either side of the upper bhūmi. Such units have been found at Bhūmarā and Sārnāth, are suggested at Sōndani and earlier at Bilsad. , are still utilized on structures in Surāṣṭra in the seventh century, and contribute conceptually to the formation of the Nāgara superstructure, where they become in corporated as bhūmikhaṇḍas. 

18 Bhandarkar op. cit. 125, Plate XIV(b) (probably upside-down). 





576 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

The full length of the architrave must have measured about 4 metres, but the southern-most panel has broken off at one-third and the concluding sculpture of a garland bearer is missing at that end (Plates 141–142; cf. Plate 115). The whole architrave consisted, in our reconstruction, of two garland bearers on either end and six panels in betweeṇThe middle of the architrave must have been between the third and the fourth panel, which we deduce from the turn of the torsion in between the third and fourth panels in the garland at the bottom of the crossbar. The height of the architrave is 65 cm, its width 38 cm. The architrave is broken at two places: in the first panel at the northern end and in the middle, between the third and fourth panels. 19 

The iconography of the eastern face of the architrave, seen by visitors when they entered the temple complex, has been discussed in Bakker 2004c, 131– 34, in particular its panel at the northern end, which, it was argued (above, p. 525), contained a Dakṣiṇāmūrti. The latter interpretation still stands, but the person who is instructed in this mūrti has to be reconsidered. 

At the time Bakker worked from a photograph kindly sent to him by Joanna Williams, which he re-published. 20 Williams (1982, 141) had observed that: ‘The subjects of the reverse [i.e. eastern face] of this same crossbar remain to be identified.’ In a letter to Bakker she added to this that she wondered ‘whether the scene at the left end of this face might not represent the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice’. 21 Bakker (2004, 132 ff.) accepted this suggestion and inter preted the Dakṣiṇāmūrti scene as representing the initiation of King Dakṣa in the Pāśupatavrata. 

The present revision of this interpretation has been prompted by a visit to the excavation site at Nagarī by Bakker and Bisschop and a study of the architrave in the field (15 January 2016). For it turned out that the panel at the southern end (E 1), although incomplete since it has broken off at one-third, 

19 Bhandarkar 1920, 139 thinks that ‘enough has been recovered to show that each broader side was originally divided into nine panels [including garland bearers]’. Bhandarkar’s reconstruction in Plate XXIII shows that he conjectures that one complete panel plus garland bearer is missing at the southern end. In view of the turn of the torsion between the third and fourth panels (E 3–4, W 3–4), we think this is less likely. An argument against our assumption, as voiced by V´eronique Degroot, is that the architrave panels show alternating indentation and protrusion: panels E 2/W 5, E 4/W 3 and (northern most) E 6/W 1 are protruding and so, assuming symmetry, one might expect a southern most panel to be protruding as well. Another argument, however, against a missing 7th panel, in addition to the change in torsion, seems to be that the breaking point in the southern-most panel (E 1/W 6) corresponds with the crack in the northern-most panel (E 6/W 1), the positions where the architrave supposedly rested on its two posts. The collapse of the toraṇa thus seems to have taken place by a break in the middle and at the two junctures. Six panels on each side makes sense according to the iconographical analysis offered in this article. If a 7th, lost panel was originally part of the architrave, the iconography of panels E 1 and W 6 that we conjecture may have been divided, broadly speaking, over two panels.

actually contains significant information that had been invisible in the above mentioned photograph. This evidence was spotted by Bisschop and debated in the field. It resulted in the acknowledgement that the earlier interpretation of the panels of the eastern face as depicting the Dakṣa myth needed to be reconsidered. 

The incomplete panel at the southern end (E 1) deserves a full discussion (Plate 143). 

Two features of this sculpture catch the eye and suggest a new identificatioṇThe pronounced ithyphallic character and the brush with peacock feathers, which is held in the ascetic’s left hand. It invites comparison to an image found at the bottom of the seventh-century doorpost built into the Deur Temple in Malhar, Chhattisgarh (Plate 144). 22

Plate 144 

Lower-most panel in Malhar doorpost 

As emerges from this and other panels of the same doorjamb, the Malhar panel depicts Siva’s entry as a naked ascetic into the Devadāruvana. The earliest ´ account of this myth is found in the Skandapurāṇa. The description of his appearance there matches the present panel: 

The Trident-bearer once entered that forest for the sake of alms. The sages saw the Lord of Gods there with his phallus erect. 23 

Like in the Nagarī panel, Siva carries the ascetic attribute of a brush and is ´ ithyphallic, while his left hand holds a begging bowl ready to receive alms. 24 These features do not figure in the Dakṣa myth. 

In the Nagarī panel E 1 the protagonist carries something in his raised right hand. The elevated position suggests the object is significant, auspicious it would seem. It is held in such a way as if it is being shown to an audience

24 Although the ascetic brush (sthalapavitra; picchikā in Jaina texts) is usually associated with Jainism, it was a mark of mendicants in general and of Pāśupatas as well. Cf. Pañcārthabhāṣya ad Pāśupatasūtra 1.6: tathā bhikṣos tridaṇḍamuṇḍakamaṇḍalukāṣāya vāsopajalapavitrasthalapavitrādi liṅgam. The sieve and brush are listed as donations to be given to the śivayogin in Sivadharmaśāstra ´ 12.70 (De Simini 2013, 291). On the adoption of the principle of ahiṁsā by the Pāśupatas, see Hara 2002, 67–76. For Bhikṣāṭanamūrtis with staff (trident) with peacock feathers see Donaldson 1986, 56. 







30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon 579 

that populated the missing two-thirds of the panel. This interpretation of the gesture is reinforced by the two following Nagarī panels (E 2 & 3), in which apparently the same object is raised, but in the left hand this time, in order to hold it away from the attackers, whereas the right hand now holds the ascetic brush. Moreover, the object seems to contain something in the first panel whereas it appears empty in the second and third, a difference that might have significance and which we will discuss below. A deer in the incomplete first panel (E 1) and a clearly visible tree in the third one (E 3) suggest a forest setting (Plates 143, 146). 

  

  

Plate 145 Plate 146 

Second panel from the left (E 2) Third panel from the left (E 3) 

That this forest in the Nagarī panel is also the Devadāruvana, follows from another significant difference between the first panel on the one hand and the second and third panels on the other: the protagonist in the latter two is no longer ithyphallic, or phallic at all. This is not due to damage, but seems to be an intrinsic part of the sculpture. This feature proves, in our view, that the myth depicted on the eastern face of the Nagarī architrave is, like its Malhar counterpart, that of Siva in the Pine Forest: ´ 

Out of envy the bewildered sages felled the great liṅga of the god, O Vyāsa, in the Pine Forest hermitage. 25 

A problem remains: what is the object that Siva holds first in his raised right ´ and then in his left hand? Erosion of the object in all three panels hampers its identificatioṇThe earlier view that saw in these panels the depiction of the Dakṣa myth naturally interpreted this object as the sacrificial cake (puroḍāś), seized from the sacrifice, but this could apply to the second and third panels only (E 2 & 3), not to the first one (E 1), in which the object is shown by Siva. ´ 26

Fertility goddess, Mathurā Gaṅgā, Ahicchatra 27 

The hand gesture in this panel recalls images of goddesses of life and natural fertility holding a vase or pot with amr̥ta, the elixir of life, such as, for instance, the maiden on the stūpa railing found in Bhūteśvara, or the terracotta image of Gaṅgā found in Ahicchatra (Plates 147, 148). This pūrṇakalaśa carried in the raised palm of the hand symbolizes vitality and natural growth. And although the Devadāruvana myth is all about life, growth and natural reproduction, depictions of this myth in which Siva carries a vase are not known to us. ´ 28 

Another terracotta piece found in Ahicchatra may be considered in this con nectioṇIt has been described by Agrawala and Banerjea as a panel depicting a Siva Daks ´ .iṇāmūrti (Plate 149), 29 an identification that is, however, unten able in our understanding of a Dakṣiṇāmūrti (Bakker 2004c). This panel shows

28 In depictions of Siva as a beggar he generally holds the begging bowl in his hand held ´ low, but a strikingly similar sculpture from Alampur shows him displaying a filled object in his raised, left hand and holding a brush in his right. See Parlier-Renault 2007, 135, fig. 89.

a four-armed deity represented as an ascetic (matted hair, rosary), holding a pūrṇakalaśa with foliage in his back left hand. Apart from the general charac teristics of the ascetic, none of Siva’s usual iconographic markers is apparently ´ present and the question is justified whether we are really concerned with an image of this god. 30 

  



Plate 149 

Terracotta panel, Ahicchatra 

There are two figures on the left of the god, one male and the other female with hands in the namaskāra mudrā. 

30 A new interpretation of this panel has recently been proposed by Laxshmi Greaves (2015, 308–13, 450–55). After a comparison of this plaque with the depiction of the sages Nara and Nārāyaṇa on the east face of the Gupta temple at Deogarh and a terracotta plaque from Bhitargaon, Greaves proposes to identify the four-armed figure in the Ahicchatra panel with Nārāyaṇa. The nymph standing to his left, Greaves argues, is the Apsaras Urvaśī, and the panel depicts the myth told in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa 1.129.1– 19, 3.35.1–18), which describes how the sage Nārāyaṇa created Urvaśī by drawing her outline in mango juice on his thigh: ‘It is apposite then that Sage Nārāyaṇa has been depicted with his left hand on his thigh, perhaps illustrating that the creation of Urvaśī has just taken place’ (Greaves op. cit. 454). We consider this interpretation interesting, but conclude that for the moment the Ahicchatra panel, whether Nārāyaṇa or Siva, ´ cannot help us to decode the iconographic programme of the Nagarī architrave. One of our doubts concerns the upanayana cord. Could this be a snake, whose head appears at the deity’s left ear? If so, this would point to Siva, rather than Nārāyan ´ . a. In the present state of conservation it is impossible to see if the deity is ithyphallic. However, his vexed look and the way the vessel in the left upper hand is kept off suggest a certain similarity with the Nagarī panels E 2 and E 3 (Plates 145–46); they may point to a Devadāruvana scene, in which the male in the background is the seer in a pose of resignation, while his wife in front of him is full of admiration for the intruder. 







582 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

We will return to the unidentified object in Siva’s raised right/left hand later, ´ but first we should have a look at the remaining panels of the architrave. The second and third panels of the eastern face of the cross-beam correspond closely to the second and third panels from below in the Malhar doorpost and thus reinforce the Devadāruvana interpretation (Plates 150–153).

In the fourth and fifth panels the Nagarī and Malhar stories go separate ways. The Malhar panels refer to the Devadāruvana myth as told in the Saromāhātmya, in which Siva in the form of an elephant plays a central role in ´ re-installing the liṅga.32 We will focus on the Nagarī story. 

When we pass from the third (E 3) to the fourth panel (E 4) we cross the middle of the architrave and therewith, it seems, we leave behind the Devadāruvana myth proper. The right half of the architrave is rather concerned with the consequences of the events told in the myth: Siva is recognized as supreme ´ god, who alone is capable of bestowing power (siddhi), grace (prasāda) and deliverance from all suffering (duḥkhānta). This is what the begging sages in the third panel (E 3) realize; the fourth panel (E 4) shows this new insight. God is depicted sitting under a tree, deep in concentration, as the master of yoga, Yogeśvara (Plate 154). 33

The reason that his Yogeśvara form and not the liṅga is chosen to represent him may have its origin in the fact that the designer of the architrave wanted to

tell another story. Realization of one’s aim in this world and the acquisition of (yogic) power is achieved by following the path (sādhana) that he contemplates and is ready to communicate to the world of meṇThe four acolytes around Yogeśvara may intimate the spread of this sādhana over the earth, since they evoke the image of the four disciples: 

And in the present age as well, when the Supreme Lord had seen the suffering in the world, He emitted four men (puruṣa) from His four faces and spoke to them, since it was His wish to bestow grace upon mankind: 

‘You four should go to earth and become twice-born ascetics; O Masters of Yoga, return to me after you have led the brahmins to the highest station. 34 

These puruṣas, the Skandapurāṇa (SP) continues, will become the four disciples (śiṣya) of Siva, whose own incarnation on earth is known as Lāgud ´ . i in the SP or Lakulīśa in later literature. This incarnation, characterised by his attribute the club (lakula), is not depicted on the architrave, but any guru pertaining to the four paraṁparās inaugurated by him, may be imagined to be implicitly involved in the last panel of the eastern face, since these ācāryas are believed to impersonate Siva when they initiate and instruct their pupils. ´ 35 The four acolytes around Yogeśvara perform different acts of veneration and they do not seem all to be of the same standing. The one at the viewer’s lower right may be a householder, indicating that not only ascetics, but the whole world had come to recognize Siva as supreme god. ´ 

The following, penultimate panel (E 5, Plate 155) shows someone set on the path towards instruction in the doctrine, which is the subject of the last panel (E 6, Plate 156, cf. Plate 116). 

The interpretation that conceived of these east-facing panels as depicting the myth of the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice obviously saw in the central figure King Dakṣa (Bakker 2004c). In our present understanding of the iconographic programme, however, this is no longer evident. 

Of the three figures in a row, the one at the viewer’s right seems to stand within a architectural structure of which roof and pillars are still partly visible. In his left hand he carries something that looks like a quiver. If this is the case, we could expect that there would be a bow somewhere, but the panel is too much eroded to make it out. Twisted locks of hair fall from under his crown-like headgear. This feature recurs in the next panel in the kneeling figure and we infer that both depict the same person.

Plate 155 

Fifth panel from the left (E 5), Nagarī 

The figure at the viewer’s left seems to be of a different standing than the two persons to the right. He is naked and of plump build. His headdress seems plain and his right hand makes the ‘do-not-fear’ gesture. His left hand is something of a puzzle. It would seem that this hand is raised and holds an object at head height, if this is not the raised right arm of the central figure. 

The tallest figure in the middle is clearly a senior persoṇHis left hand holds the knot of his dhotī. His right arm, if it is not raised, appears to lean on the left arm of his companion to the right, while his hand seems to hold something; a stick? It is clear that he wears a high crown with an ornament. 

As a working hypothesis we conjecture that the figure carrying the quiver and who reappears in the next panel is Arjuna, who is being dispatched by his elder brother Yudhiṣṭhira, the figure in the middle, on the advise of Vyāsa, who stands on the (viewer’s) left side. 

Mahābhārata 3.37–38 tells the story. 36 Vyāsa instructs Yudhiṣṭhira to pass on to Arjuna a spell, a vidyā named Pratismr̥ti, also referred to as yogavidyā or brahman, which will enable him to acquire the necessary weapons from Indra, Rudra, Varuṇa, Kubera and Dharma. 37 Yudhiṣṭhira explains to Arjuna that their enemies possess mastery in the use of all sorts of weapons and therefore, for the Pāṇḍavas to win the war, it is necessary to obtain superior weapons. He will initiate him into this secret knowledge (Upaniṣad) received from Vyāsa,

thanks to which the whole world will become visible to him and through which he should seek the grace of the gods. 38 

After these words the lord King Dharma (i.e. Yudhiṣṭhira) taught him (i.e. Ar juna) that magic, when he was ritually consecrated and controlled in word, body, and thought; then the elder brother told his heroic brother to depart. 39 

In the Mahābhārata Indra is the first person that Arjuna visits on his quest, but the Saiva world view, which conceived this temple and architrave, shifted the ´ Vyāsa–Yudhiṣṭhira line of initiation onto Siva, as we will see in the next panel. ´ It is Siva’s help that is sought first, since only instruction in the Pāśupata path ´ will enable Arjuna to reach his goal. This is the lesson that the seers on earth had learned in the Devadāruvana, illustrated in the first three panels. We move on to the last one (E 6, Plate 156).

identifies the figure to Siva’s right ( ´ dakṣiṇā), towards whom he slightly bends, as the same princely figure that we have tentatively identified as Arjuna in the preceding panel (E 5). Arjuna is on his knees now, facing north, receiving instructioṇThe scene is set on a mountain, in a forest. A powerful gaṇa-type of figure stands behind him, bending the hero’s arms behind his back by his front hands, or so it seems; his right back hand sticks up holding something above his head, whereas the contour of his raised left back arm is only vaguely visible. We will discuss below who this four-armed helper of Siva could be. ´ 

As we have argued earlier, this panel (E 6) shows a Dakṣiṇāmūrti in the orig inal meaning of the term (Bakker 2004c, 132 f.; above, p. 525). The neophyte who is instructed or initiated in the Pāśupata doctrine is not Dakṣa, according to our present understanding, but the princely figure depicted in the penulti mate panel E 5, who is there about to be dispatched by his elder brother and a saintly advisor. 

The Devadāruvana myth that is told in the first three panels (E 1–3) does not immediately suggest a figure that would be the recipient of Siva’s instruc- ´ tion, let alone the figure of Arjuna. Our tentative interpretation of this panel E 6, which sees in it Arjuna’s instruction in the Saiva ´ sādhana, needs further underpinning. This will be furnished by the iconographic programme of the western face of the architrave, which will make clear that we should read both sides of the architrave as one continuous story. 

The western face(W) of the gateway architrave

Reconstruction of the architrave of the gateway, facing west 

The panels of the reverse side of the architrave (Plates 157–158), which faced west and were seen by visitors leaving the temple complex, have been indenti fied by Joanna Williams (1982, 141); they depict scenes from the Kirātārjunīya myth. This interpretation has been accepted by Bakker 2004c and still stands. 







588 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

It accords well with the fact that the poet Bhāravi probably wrote his fa mous Kirātārjunīya at the court of the Later Aulikara king Yaśodharman, also known as Viṣṇuvardhana. 40 Either he or, more likely, his father, King Prakāśadharman, was responsible for the building of this temple and its gate way. 

The first or northern-most panel (W 1, Plate 159) shows, according to Williams, ‘Nara and Nārāyaṇa seated in the wilderness’. She compares it with the great Deogarh relief (Plate 160). 

The scene interpreted in this way may represent the dialogue between both seers as given in the Mahābhārata.41 The function of this piece of Vaiṣṇava philosophy, however, within the story told in the Nagarī architrave remains entirely obscure. In the Deogarh relief, the scene is overseen by Brahmā, who had sent both seers to earth to fight demons.

He who hates you hates me; who follows you follows me. You, invincible hero, are Nara and I am Hari Nārāyaṇa. Nara and Nārāyaṇa, the seers, have come from their world to this world.

armed. The scene is set in the mountains, where the rest of the Kirātārjunīya myth takes place. A lion is visible in a mountain cave at the foot. 

Despite the striking similarities between the Deogarh and Nagarī panels, we are not convinced that the figure to the left of Arjuna is indeed Nārāyaṇa. Instead we think it more likely that the person Arjuna is speaking to is ‘the ascetic (tapasvin), blazing with the lustre of brahman, tawny, with matted hair and lean’, 42 who is no other than Indra in disguise. This brahmin asks Arjuna why he has come in full armour and requests him to leave behind his bow (MBh 3.38.32–34). The bow may indeed be visible in the present panel to Arjuna’s right side. 

After this brahmin failed to have Arjuna give up his resolve, he reveals his true identity and offers a booṇArjuna replies: 

I do not want wishes of worlds, or divinity, still less happiness, nor the sovereignty over all the gods, overlord of the Thirty! If I leave my brothers in the wilderness without avenging the feud, I shall find infamy in all the worlds for time without end. 43 

These are the proud words of the Kṣatriya, the quintessence of the Kirātā rjunīya. Confronted with so much self-confidence, Indra can think of nothing better than to refer Arjuna to ‘the three-eyed, trident-bearing Lord of Beings, Siva’. ´ 44 

The similarity of the Nagarī panel with the one in Deogarh and other Nara– Nārāyaṇa representations is, however, not coincidence, but serves as a reminder to the onlooker that Arjuna is Nara. In Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya (12.33) Siva ´ explains to the seers that Arjuna is in fact an incarnation of Nara, a part of the Primaeval Man (Adipurus ¯ .a). And, he says, there is Acyuta. Nara and Acyuta have been asked by Brahmā to go among men to protect creation by killing demons, 45 but ‘Nārāyaṇa’ as such does not figure in Bhāravi’s work. 

Nara is said to have been created by Deva Nīlalohita in Skandapurāṇa 6. He had issued from the mirror image of Viṣṇu, who was reflected in the blood that the latter had himself donated to Nīlalohita’s begging bowl. This begging bowl is said in SP 6.1 to be Brahmā’s Head (brahmaṇaḥśirah.), that is, his fifth one, which had been chopped off in SP 5 and was then used by Siva/Nīlalohita ´ on his rounds for alms. 46 

After Deva (i.e. Nīlalohita) has seen (Viṣṇu’s) reflection in the liquid (rasa) within the skull (kapāla), he issues forth (a) man (puruṣa) resembling Viṣṇu in strength.

He says to him: You (shall) be immortal, exempt from old age and decay and invincible on the battle field; Viṣṇu will be your best friend, and you (shall) live with him performing divine tasks. 

Because you are born from the ‘waters’ (nārā) that rose from Viṣṇu’s body, you shall be called Nara (i.e. ‘man’) and be dear to him. 47 

Evidently these two sixth-century Saiva, i.e. Pāśupata, texts play down Vis ´ .ṇu’s role; the story told in the Nagarī architrave might do just the same. With Arjuna we move from Mount Indrakīla, where the meeting with Indra had taken place (MBh 3.38.30), to Mount Himavat (MBh 3.39.11), where the extreme tapas will take place, illustrated in the second panel (W 2, Plate 161). 

  



Plate 161 

Second panel from left (W 2): Arjuna’s penance 

The overall idea of this panel W 2 is clear: it shows Arjuna’s severe asceticism by standing on one leg in order to propitiate Siva. ´ 48 Nārāyaṇa does not belong to this context, nor has Indra a role to play any longer. It is not immediately clear, however, who the figure to his left could be.

30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon 591 

If we follow the Mahābhārata story, the seers, afraid of Arjuna’s ascetic powers, go to Mahādeva, who acknowledges Arjuna’s mortifications and gives his approval: 

The Great Lord said: ‘Swiftly return in joyous spirit and unwearied whence you have come. I do know the intention that is lodged in his mind. He does not desire heaven, nor sovereignty, nor long life; this very day I shall accomplish what he desires.’ 49 

We tentatively propose that it is this important moment of Siva’s consent (and ´ his resolve to put him to the test first) that has been depicted in this panel. It is also conceivable that the figure of Siva here is a representation of Arjuna’s ´ thought. 

The figure seems to be four-armed, though only three are visible; his left back hand, if that is what it is, is raised and carries an object not unlike the mysterious object in the first three panels of the eastern face of the architrave (E 1–3). We postpone the discussion of this object and move on to the third panel (W 3), in which the test starts off. 

The scene in this third panel from the left is without problems (Plate 162).   

Plate 162 

Third panel from left (W 3): Who shot the boar? 

It shows the boar and the Kirāta with his wife, a disguise that Siva and Pārvatī ´ had taken oṇArjuna and the hunter argue about whose arrow pierced the boar.

The Kirāta is about to pull out the arrow, which enrages Arjuna and a fight is inevitable (Plate 163). 50

Shouting again and again, they bored each other with arrows like poisonous snakes. Arjuna shot at the mountain man (Kirāta) a shower of arrows and Sam ´ . kara received them with a tranquil mind. (MBh 3.40.25–26; tr̥van Buitenen). 

Then, in the following panel (Plate 164): 

My arrows are gone. Who is this man who devours all my arrows? I shall attack him with the nock of my bow, as one attacks an elephant with the point of a spear, and send him to the domain of staff-bearing Yama! (MBh 3.40.37–38; tr̥van Buitenen.) 

We arrive at the d´enouement in the sixth panel (W 6, Plate 165), at the south ern end of the western face of the architrave. 

The Kirāta had been a form adopted by Siva to test his devotee Arjuna. ´ The latter is allowed a vision of the Great God. In the Mahābhārata version of the story Mahādeva reveals himself as the god carrying the trident, dwelling in the mountains together with Devī; in the Kirātārjunīya he assumes ‘his own form’, smeared with ashes and ornamented with the crescent. 51 Neither of these are visible to us, since, like its counterpart E 1, the panel is broken off at one-third. But we do see Arjuna, no longer as an ascetic, though, but as a princely figure, wearing his ornamental crown from which his locks fall down, very similar to his representation in the two panels at the end of the eastern face of the architrave (E 5 & 6). This is one of the elements that convinces us 

50 Cf. Bakker 2014, 36 f., in which Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya 14.14 is quoted to illustrate the scene. 

51 MBh 3.40.55–56, see above, n. 50 on p. 523. Bhāravi gives the following description: atha himaśucibhasmabhūṣitaṁśirasi virājitam indulekhayā | svavapuḥatimanoharaṁharaṁdadhatam udīkṣya nanāma pāṇḍavaḥk (Kirātārjunīya 18.15). 







30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon 593 

that the eastern and western faces of the architrave tell a continuous story, the story of Arjuna and his quest for the Pāśupata WeapoṇThe other element is this weapon itself. 

Just as in the first panel of the obverse   

(E 1), we cannot but speculate on what 

has been depicted in the missing two 

thirds of the reverse side (W 6). The 

motive and theme of the Kirātārjunīya 

story is Arjuna’s quest for the Pāśupata 

astra, the weapon which alone is powerful 

enough to counteract all other weapons 

and which leads its owner to victory over 

his foes. Arjuna asks Siva for it: ´ 

If it pleases you to grant me my 

wish, Bull-bannered God, then I wish 

that divine weapon (astra), the dreadful 

Pāśupata Weapon, my lord, which is called 

Brahmā’s Head (brahmaśiras), gruesome 

(raudra), of terrible power, which at the 

horrible end of the Eon will destroy the 

entire world. With it I may burn down 

in battle the Dānavas and the Rākṣasas, 

the evil spirits and Piśācas, Gandharvas, 

and Snakes. From its mouth (yatah.), when 

properly spelt (anumantritāh.), issues forth 

thousand of tridents, awful-looking, clubs 

and missiles like venomous snakes. With it I shall embattle Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and Kr̥pa, and the always rough-spoken son of the sūta (Karṇa). This is my wish, my lord, who took Bhaga’s eyes, so by your grace I may go forth competent! 52 

Plate 165

Arjuna receives the Pāśupata Weapon 

Siva gives this powerful weapon to Arjuna, ´ 53 but warns him to use it cautiously, since launched against a person of insufficient strength it may have apocalyptic consequences. If the panels of the architrave are to make any sense, this gift of the Pāśupata Weapon must have been represented somehow. Aside from final release (duḥkhānta), it is the ultimate boon for the Māheśvaras. 

52 Tr̥van BuiteneṇMBh 3.41.7–12 (above, n. 50 on p. 523). 

53 In the Kirātārjunīya 18.44 Siva gives Arjuna the Raudra Weapon, encompassed by flam- ´ ing fire (jvaladanalaparītaṁraudram astram). 







594 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

The Pāśupata Weapon 

If we work on the assumption that this boon must have been represented in the narrative of the architrave, we should answer the question how it has been de picted in its iconographic programme. The weapon (astra) is called ‘belonging to Rudra’ or ‘fierce’ (raudra), but more significantly: ‘Head of Brahmā’. This may refer, as we have seen above (p. 589), to one of the Pāśupata key myths, namely the cutting off of the fifth head of Brahmā by Siva/Nīlalohita. This ´ myth was known in the last phase of the Mahābhārata composition, where Siva ´ is called Brahmaśiropaharta (sic). 54 

The full story is first told in the Skandapurāṇa. 

Then, ordered by Parameśvara, this lord Nīlalohita, his (matted) hair coiled into a top-knot (kapardin), took the Head of Brahmā. 

After he had taken that shining head, he assumed a disguise, entered a playful state of yoga and started going around begging. 55 

This ‘Head of Brahmā’ is Siva’s begging bowl and, according to the ´ Mahābhārata, the Pāśupata Weapon seems to be just that, the Holy Grail of Saivism. 56 We should therefore look for a (begging) bowl, and this leads us to the mysterious object that we encountered in the first three panels of the eastern face (E 1–3) and in the second one of the western (W 2). 

We return to E 1, the first, incomplete panel of the eastern face. What we see in Siva’s right, raised hand could agree to the shape of a begging bowl or ´ skull. The function of the bowl/skull shown here is not so much the collecting of alms, rather than exposing it to an audience. This makes sense only if the begging bowl is more than just that. We consider it a rebus, representing the word brahmaśiras in visual (iconographic) form. 

54 MBh 13 App. I, No. 6 l. 45. Yuko Yokochi (personal communication) has questioned van Buitenen’s translation of brahmaśiras with ‘Brahmā’s Head’ in MBh 3.41.8a (above, n. 50 on p. 523). Admittedly, there is no reference to the myth of the decapitation of Brahmā here. The Brahmaśiras, like all divine weapons, is a mantra weapon and should be ‘properly spelt’ (anumantrita) to yield the desired result, that means that this skull of Brahmā (kapāla)/begging bowl has the potency to issue forth the most powerful weapoṇAs such the word may signify ‘the foremost (śiras) of the Vedic mantras (brahman)’. We consider it plausible that the ambiguity was deliberate and was made use of by the designer of the architrave.

According to MBh 3 App. 27, l. 1 the Pāśupata weapon is an arrow (śara); the brahmaśiras may be thought to be the mantra that makes this weapon so effective. SPBh 98.7–8ab seems to distinguish between the Pāśupata Weapon and the Brahmaśiras when it lists the four weapons that form the four tusks of Varāha:

brahmadaṇḍaṁtr̥tīyaṁca caturthaṁbrahmaṇaḥśiraḥk 







30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon 595 

If our analysis is correct, it represents the ne plus ultra, the power that devotees who pursue the Pāśupata sādhana aspire to obtain in this world: the Pāśupata Weapon or ‘Head of Brahmā’, the Saiva equivalent of the ´ pūrṇakalaśa, the source of life (nara) and death (antaka). 57 This equivalence is further expressed by the fact that in the first panel the bowl seemed to have been filled, whereas the bowl appears empty in the following two panels, when it is withdrawn. 

The token that was held out at the beginning in the first relief (E 1) was thus finally obtained by Arjuna in the addorsed panel at the end of the architrave’s narrative (W 6). It is the kṣatra or fighting spirit of Arjuna and his unswerving devotion to Siva that won him this award at long last, the Pāśupata Weapon, ´ and therewith the power to defeat all enemies. The Mahābhārata again de scribes the scene. 

Hearing this, the Pārtha (Arjuna) hurriedly and attentively purified himself; and when he embraced the feet of the lord of the universe, the God said to him, ‘Now learn!’ Then he taught the best of the Pāṇḍavas about the missile (astra), along with the secrets of its return, this missile that is Death incarnate (mūrtimantam ivāntakam). [. . . ] 

When the moment came, there was an outcry of conches, drums, and kettledrums by the thousands, and a huge quake occurred. The Gods and the Dānavas wit nessed how that fiercely burning dreadful missile stood bodily deployed (mūrtimat) at the side of the boundlessly lustrous Pāṇḍava. 58 

And we believe the visitors to the Mahādeva Temple in Nagarī witnessed it too. Arjuna’s pose in the final panel (W 6) is one of vacillatioṇThe ends of his cloth flutter. His knee is bent, as if he is taken aback. In front of him, we speculate, the Pāśupata Weapon may have stood in bodily form, next to Siva ´ in all his glory. What the weapon may have looked like, we know from another sculpture telling the same story. 

Joanna Williams discusses ‘a pair of pillars found at Rajaona, 60 km east (and slightly north) of Rajgir’, Bihar (Plate 166). Its subject matter, according to her, ‘resembles that of the Nagarī lintel’. ‘The remaining face shows Siva ´ seated with Pārvatī on his mountain, whilst in front Arjuna kneels before the chubby four-armed personification of the Pāśupatāstra, the weapon that has been his goal throughout the story.’ 59 

Arjuna, however, is not on his knees in Nagarī; in that pose he had been depicted when he was brought to Siva for instruction by a four-armed figure in ´ the last panel of the eastern face (E 6). 

57 Above, p. 589, and below. SPBh 84.3 compares the battle with the sacrifice. The ‘heads’ are the ‘sacrificial cakes’ (puroḍāśāḥśirāṁsi), the divine weapons are the mantras (mantrāś cāstrāṇi divyāni).

Plate 166 

Rajaona, column: the presentation of the Pāśupata Weapon 

We now conjecture that the four-armed figure in that panel E 6 (Plate 156) may be the Pāśupata Weapon personified, not waiting on the Pāṇḍava hero, but conducing him to deference. The vigorous way in which this seems to be done could point to the forceful nature of the allegorical figure. The object that he seems to hold above his head may have been the skull, although the sculpture is too much worn to be certain about it. But if so, it would make this four-armed ‘chubby figure’ in the Dakṣiṇāmūrti panel a true āyudhapuruṣa. 

A similar allegorical figure must, if our theory is correct, have been depicted in the missing part of the final panel (W 6), this time, however, ‘waiting on the great hero’ (upatasthe mahātmānam. ). 60 

The Pāśupata Weapon thus seems to be the true subject of the Nagarī ar chitrave. It is represented as a begging bowl made of Brahmā’s fifth head (Brahmaśiras), and in personified form as āyudhapuruṣa. In either form it appears throughout the iconographic programme: in the eastern-face panels E 1–3, and E 6 (embodied), and in the western-face panels W 2 and W 6 (em bodiment conjectured). A close comparison may illustrate this point (Plate 167).

The showing of the begging bowl or skull in the second panel of the western face (W 2) makes sense. It is not offered to Arjuna yet—as it had been to the ascetics in the first panel of the eastern face (E 1), who, however, rejected it in their ignorance—but raising it in the back left hand means that it is displayed as a boon that will be awarded, if Arjuna stands the test. 

Having reached this point in our analysis, we venture the suggestion that within the first panel of the western face (W 1) the figure of which only a head and a left forearm are visible (to the viewer’s right, above the ascetic who is Indra in disguise), may be the Pāśupata Weapon, presenting itself in iconic, that is bodily, and in aniconic form, as the begging bowl in his left hand (Plate 168). 61

Concluding observations 

Like the composers of epic and puranic lore, the architect of the Mahādeva Temple and the designer of the iconographic programme of the toraṇa shared in the universe of myths. Like textual composers, the designer made his se lection from this universe to compose his narrative. And like written texts, his visual narrative is inevitably an incomplete rendering of the stock of myths that circulated in his days. Like a textual author he extracted from this stock, adapted it to his needs and in this way contributed to its evolutioṇA textual source that tells exactly the same narrative as the architrave and that would

thus be considered to be its source is not likely ever to turn up. The narrative of the architrave is the text, and as such it shows instances of intertextuality, thanks to which we can try to understand its message. 

Without doubt the designer was well acquainted with the Mahābhārata, whose story of the Kirātārjunīya was at the basis of his work. 62 He could not yet know the Skandapurāṇa, since we believe that its composition only began in the second half of the sixth century, but the universe of Saiva myths had ´ substantially expanded from the days that the composition of the great epic was coming to a close. The myth of Brahmā’s decapitation by Siva, for instance, is ´ only referred to through an epithet of the Great God in an Appendix passage of the epic, but the full story must have been around in Pāśupata circles before it was put down in the Skandapurāṇa. The same is true of the Devadāruvana myth. Familiarity with this lore is to be presupposed, not only for the designer, but for the general visitor at the time. 

Arjuna’s quest for the divine Pāśupata Weapon and the Devadāruvana story are both mythical in nature and as such convey general, timeless truths. As all myths, however, they may serve as templates for human action and their depiction in art may function as historical allegory. 

It is appealing therefore to read the architrave as a metaphor and to specu late on its connection with the rājasthānīya, the Aulikara viceroy who ruled in Madhyamā/Madhyamikā under Prakāśadharman and Yaśodharman (between ad 510 and 533), and who had, according to the Chittorgarh inscription (above, p. 570), commissioned the building of a Mahādeva temple. The educated con temporary onlooker may have seen in its iconographic programme evidence of his governor or king embracing the Saiva religion by being instructed in its ´ observances; other visitors may have seen only the template, the myth, an ambiguity inherent in Indian—and not only Indian—plastic art in general. 

We have discovered the central theme of the Nagarī architrave, the one that con nects both faces. It appears to be the recovery of the Pāśupata Weapon, which alone was believed to secure victory in difficult times. It helped the Pāṇḍavas to win back their kingdom, and it may have been thought to bring victory to the Later Aulikara kings Prakāśadharman and Yaśodharman of Daśapura and their allies in Madhyamikā, when they were locked in a deadly conflict with their archenemies, Toramāṇa and Mihirakula, who were commanding the dreaded armies of the Huns. 

This theme also links the Devadāruvana myth to the Kirātārjunīya. In addition to Siva’s stark naked and ithyphallic appearance, misunderstood and ´ causing offence, it is the bowl made out of Brahmā’s head and symbolizing the Great God’s benevolence, that the seers failed to recognize in the first panel (E 1). Standing alone and being despised is, after all, the fundamental attitude 

62 We have not found references specific to Bhāravi’s Kirātārjunīya, which was being com posed at about the same time or slightly later (above, p. 588; cf. n. 61 on p. 597). 







30 / The Quest for the Pāśupata Weapon 599 

of the Pāśupata ascetic. 63 When the seers attack him in the next panel (E 2), he keeps it away from them. 

In the earliest written version of the Devadāruvana myth that we possess, 64 Skandapurāṇa 167.72–80, the ‘audience’ are the Vaikhānasa hermits. It is quite possible that only these or similar sages were depicted in the missing part of the first panel. The role of the wives of the sages may have come more to the fore in later versions, such as the narrative on the doorpost in Malhar, when the connotations of ‘Brahmaśiras’ either were no longer recognized, as ‘Brahmā’s Head’ had subsided into just a bowl to collect alms, or had come into bad grace due to its association with the Kāpālikas. 

The exclusive focus in the Pine Forest myth on the liṅga may therefore have been the result of a development, which gradually replaced the idea that underlies the Nagarī architrave. This would explain that the liṅga as object of worship does not feature in the architrave. Instead, it was the supreme good that only Siva can bestow, object of his meditation in E 4, and symbolized in ´ his Brahmaśiras attribute, that took centre stage. 

The irony that will not have been lost on the designer of the architrave and the educated Pāśupata visitor of the temple thus seems to be that, if we follow the Skandapurāṇa, Arjuna at the end of his quest recovers the fons et origo from which he, as Nara (above, p. 589), had once emerged, namely the Head of Brahmā. This cycle illustrates the superiority of the high god of the age, Mahādeva. 

When they passed through the temple gateway, the king and his subjects were reminded of the major realities of Siva’s World—asceticism, His benevolence, ´ His revelation of the doctrine. After worshipping God, they saw, while they were leaving through the gate, the path which would lead to His grace and which held out to them the prospect of the acquisition of the highest good in this world, the Pāśupata Weapon—through steadfastness, self-control and bravery. 

It was this faith, embraced by the Later Aulikara kings and their court, that was imparted to the visitors of the Mahādeva Temple in Madhyamikā, at the moment that they came to be involved in the powerful World of the Great God. 

63 Pāśupatasūtra 3.3: avamatah.. 

64 Bisschop 2006, 195 f. In MBh 13 App. I No. 4 ll. 66–67 it is only said that Siva ‘sports ´ with the daughters and wives of the sages, with bristled hair, with a great penis, naked, with distorted eyes’. No doubt, an idea like this was the source of the Pine Forest myth.

Friends, if you will permit me, let me be that kavi today. 1 Allow me to take advantage of this unique occasion to read an essay in the indicative mood. No modal auxiliaries: neither ‘would’ nor ‘should’; neither ‘may’ nor ‘could’. In other words, a thoroughly unscholarly exposition, but a, hopefully light, and delightfully careless artist’s impression, which puts ‘how beautiful it may have been, possibly’ into an apodictic style: ‘so beautiful it was, definitely’. After all, an artist’s impression is, according to the infallible Wikipedia, ‘the repre sentation of a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available’. 

So it came to pass, 

When Avantivarman ascended the Maukhari throne in Kanyakubja in the last quarter of the sixth century, it may have appeared as if the old days of stability and prosperity had returned to Madhyadeśa. Thanks to the incessant war efforts of his grandfather, Īśānavarman, the cruel intruders called Hūṇas had been driven back to the foothills of the western Himālayas after a long and devastating period of war. A close friendship had developed between the rulers in Kanyakubja and Sthāneśvara, where the dynasty of the Vardhanas guarded the western part of the kingdom. The eastern enemies, the Gauḍas and their allies the Guptas, had been forced to take refuge at the borders of the ocean, where they were being kept in check by Kanyakubja’s powerful southern allies in Dakṣiṇa Kosala, who traced their respectable pedigree straight back to Pāṇḍu and his mighty son Arjuna. 

∗ This is the text of my valedictory on the occasion of my retirement as professor of The Interpretation of Hinduism in the Sanskrit Tradition and Indian Philosophy at the University of GroningeṇIt concluded the VVIK Indologendag 2013 in Leiden, 28 September 2013. Parts of this lecture have been included in the Introduction to The World of the Skandapurāṇa (Bakker 2014). 

1 For the above Sanskrit verse see below, p. 609. 

601 









The ancient land of the Buddha and the cradle of empire was firmly un der control. Avantivarman proudly bore the title ‘sovereign of Magadhā’. A Buddhist settlement there was developing into a place of learning of high in ternational repute. The university of Nālandā attracted students and scholars from all over India and abroad, and the Maukhari king, though not a Buddhist, prided himself on being its chancellor. 

The monarch watched over the Bull of the Dharma, which was shepherded by his countrymeṇThe Bull, shown on the royal seal, had in recent years become a forceful emblem, a symbol appropriated by another religion, one to which the Maukharis had confessed ever since they had thrown off the yoke of the Imperial Guptas with their state deity Viṣṇu. Worship of Siva had opened up ´ new avenues for the imagination and enshrined royal authority in burgeoning forms of early tantric Hinduism. 

Though familiar with all sorts of asceticism, northern India in the sixth century saw a new type of strange sādhus travelling around, who smeared themselves with ashes and imitated the god of their devotion, Siva Paśupati. ´ A lineage of gurus pertaining to this movement had settled in Kanyakubja, an establishment founded in the capital by a saint from Kurukṣetra, the ancient battlefield, now firmly under the control of the friendly Vardhanas or Puṣya bhūtis, who themselves had become staunch followers of this type of religioṇAvantivarman, too, was well disposed towards them and invited some of them to his court. 

The Pāśupatas, as these Siva worshippers were called, made good use of the ´ patronage that fell to their lot. They set up religious centres (sthāna), temples (āyatana) and monasteries (maṭha) at the country’s holiest grounds, such as the Kapālasthāna in Kurukṣetra, Bhadreśvara near Ga˙ngādvāra, the great Deva temple, āyatana, in Prayāga, and the siddhasthāna, ‘home of the saints’, called Madhyameśvara, circa one kilometer north of the renowned cremation grounds of Avimukta or Vārāṇasī. 

A network of itinerant sādhus connected these centres, which became well integrated with the local religious infrastructure and developed into junctions within a fabric of yogins and religious teachers. The Pāśupatas had had a good look at their Buddhist counterparts and had copied their formula for success, namely a standing organisation of professional religious specialists— yogins, ascetics, and ācāryas—supported by a following of ordinary devotees, the Māheśvara community at large, to whose spiritual needs it catered. One of the peculiar facilities offered to the community of laukikas, by at least some of these Pāśupata ascetics, was to extend services in and around the cremation grounds. Living in the cremation ground was a highly acclaimed strategy within Pāśupata asceticism. Mahākāla in Ujjain, Mahākapāla in Thanesar, Avimukteśvara in Benares, Paśupatinātha in Nepal, to mention just the best known, were run by Pāśupatas and became key to their success. 

Avantivarman, therefore, acted in tune with the spirit of his time when he supported the movement. Earlier his uncle Sūryavarman had spent large sums 







31 / Composition and Spread of the Skandapurāṇa 603 

on the rebuilding of a dilapidated temple of the ‘Foe of Andhaka’, whose images were beginning to appear around this time. The prince had hired a poet to sing the praises of the god as well as of himself, chiselled into stone, for everyone to read: 

May that figure of Andhaka’s Foe, on whose body snakes glimmer, offer you a stable abode—a figure who wears a lion skin that is slightly crimsoned by the light of the jewel in the hood of the serpent [that is his sacred thread], and who reddens the white line of skulls that is the chaplet by the radiance from his third eye, and who bears on his crest the slender, darkness dispelling digit of the moon. 

He (the prince) had youth that was beautiful like the waxing moon and dear to all the world; he was at peace and his mind was devoted to reflection on the branches of learning; he had mastered fully (all) the arts; it was as if Lakṣmī (fortune), Kīrti (fame) and Sarasvatī (learning), among others, vied with one another for his patronage: in the world, women in love experience the feeling (of love) all the more, if their lover is beloved. 2 

Poets were held in high esteem and Avantivarman invited them to his court. Imagine the glamorous world in which plays like the Mudrārākṣasa were staged, attended by the playwright Viśākhadatta in person, or the Kaumudīmaho tsava, to mention another play, in which the entrance of the ruler himself is announced: 

A son of the House of Magadhā has arrived, thronged by hundreds of eminent ministers, like the moon enhanced by an aureole of stars, that prince, who is a feast for the eyes of his delighted subjects. 3 

This is the world in which Sanskrit flourished, the world in which the kavi Bhatsu, Bāṇa’s respected teacher, was honoured by crowned heads. This court was sustained by the inhabitants of Kanyakubja who, in the words of the famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, were ‘honest and sincere, noble and gracious in appearance, clothed in ornamented and bright-shining fabrics’, inhabitants who ‘applied themselves much to learning, and in their travels were very much given to discussion on religious subjects, whereas the fame of their pure language was far spread’. 4 To this court the leading figures of the community of Māheśvaras were also welcomed. Sanskrit was their language and in Sanskrit they composed their learned treatises and witty mythology. 

For learned treatises and religious expositions the educated classes of northern India looked to Vārāṇasī. This trading town on the River Ganges had emerged under the Guptas in the preceding century as a centre of traditional Hindu learning. The arrival of the Pāśupata movement added to its reputation for holiness, whereas the collective Sanskrit learning of the town added to the literary achievements of the Māheśvaras.

The composition of the two classic Sanskrit epics was closed by the fourth century. Some of the new religious ideas concerning the god Siva had still made ´ it into the latest layers of the Mahābhārata. After the Rāmāyaṇa had been completed, mythology related to the tutelary deity of the Gupta Empire, Viṣṇu, and his popular manifestation of Kr̥ṣṇa in particular, had found expression in an Appendix to the great epic, the Harivaṁśa, as well as in a new type of Sanskrit text styled ‘Ancient Lore’, i.e. Purāṇa. 

The Purāṇa as a literary genre in its first stages of development dealt with the creation of the universe, the origin of the world and its royal dynasties. However, as for instance the Viṣṇupurāṇa had shown, the genre also lent itself perfectly to the circulation of popular, religious and mythological material. After the civilized world had recovered from a period of devastating wars and invasions, and now that Viṣṇu had ceded his place of prominence to Siva, the ´ sixth century embraced a new form of devotioṇThe time had come to collect the mythology of the Great God. In the words of the Skandapurāṇa: ‘Having heard the story of Bhārata as well as the Ancient Lore, we wish to hear about the birth of Siva’s son, Kārttikeya.’ ´ 

A senior brahmin member of the Māheśvara community in Vārāṇasī, well versed in Sanskrit literature, an expert on the epic tradition, initiated in the Pāśupata sacred texts, in short, a brahmin with great prestige among his fellow believers, charismatic and dynamic, that man, let us call him the Sūta, took the initiative to fulfil this wish and to compose a Purāṇa text that would do justice to the rich mythology of Siva and his family, that would be accessible to ´ the whole community, and, last but not least, that would validate local claims of the sanctity of holy ground by telling their Māhātmyas. In order to possess this authority, the text should be in the anonymous, pseudohistoric style of the Purāṇa, reportedly spoken by a sage of yore with intimate knowledge of the Great God’s own thoughts and deeds. 

It happened in the days of Avantivarman’s reign that a group of kindred spirits and literary talents convened in an institution of the community in Benares. They discussed the plan and pledged their commitment. The Sūta, the editor-in-chief, began his composition in Sloka verses, while an inventory ´ was being agreed on of the myths, stories, topics and places that had to be treated in the course of the work, a narrative that was designed to lead to the birth, consecration and heroic deeds of Kārttikeya, but could not reach that point before an extensive cycle of Andhaka myths had been told first— Andhaka who, like the Mleccha foes of the Maukharis, could not be slain until after an endless series of battles. 5 

The materials were arranged in a preliminary order in versified form. This inventory or blueprint, Anukramaṇikā as it was called, has survived and come down to us in the second adhyāya of the Skandapurāṇa. The editor-in-chief was assisted by some editors who were assigned specific portions of the com

31 / Composition and Spread of the Skandapurāṇa 605 

positioṇThe Pāśupata network was called in to assemble information about places sacred to the Māheśvara community. Sometimes this resulted in new collaborators entering the group, bringing in local knowledge couched in Māhā tmya-style texts, sometimes the editor himself used the information to compose the story. Rarely were ready-made texts taken from existing literature. The Sūta guaranteed the unity of literary style and the quality of the Sanskrit, but this could not prevent minor differences remaining. He also took great care that the arrangement of stories, the complex narrative structure of the text, remained consistent and logical. However, soon it appeared that the original blueprint could not be implemented except in broad outline; the myths and stories composed had too powerful a dynamic of their own to link up with each other perfectly. Here the genius of the Sūta was most needed and he did a brilliant job. 6 

The Pāśupata network was strongest along the east-west axis, Vārāṇasī– Kanyakubja–Kurukṣetra. It had been decided to begin in the west, since it was one of the underlying aims of the work to cover, or rather to recover the entire landscape of northern India, transforming it into sacred space, a landscape on which the deeds of the Great God and his entourage had bestowed holiness at the beginning of time. The work was well under way—the myths relating to Kurukṣetra and the Sarasvatī, Sthāneśvara, Bhadreśvara and Kanakhala, and Vārāṇasī itself had been composed, and the Vindhyavāsinī Cycle was drafted— when political reality threatened to disrupt the literary activity. A joint attack from the east and the southwest brought to an end the rule of the Maukharis, just when Grahavarman had succeeded his father Avantivarman, while that of its allies in Thanesar was shaking on its foundations. For a while Benares came under the control of the easterners, the Gauḍas. 

A young prince, a kumāra from Sthāneśvara, installed as chief of the army on the banks of the Sarasvatī, as it were the embodiment of Skanda himself, came to the rescue of the kingdom of Kanyakubja. In a war that lasted sev eral years, Harṣavardhana succeeded in pushing the Gauḍas under their king ‘Moon’, Saśāṅka, back across the rivers Son ´ . a and Gaṇḍakī. 

In about ad 606, the political situation had stabilized enough to organize a magnificent royal coronation ceremony. Harṣavardhana was enthroned in Kanyakubja. It would take Harṣa six more years, however, to consolidate his sovereignty over the combined hereditary lands of the Vardhanas and Maukha ris, including Magadhā, and before finally, to paraphrase the closing metaphor of Harṣa’s Deeds sung by the greatest writer of the time, Bāṇa—‘After a day of bloody contest, at the fall of night, while the sinking sun crimsoned the sky and the waters of the ocean, the Fame of his House, the Glory of his Rule, and the Force of his Destiny united to hand over to him a pale-looking Moon.’ 

6 An illustration of this intricate process is the inclusion of the legend of the seven brahmins into the Vindhyavāsinī Cycle, for which see Yokochi’s Introduction SP III, 15–22. 







Vārāṇasī was back in the kingdom of Kanyakubja, but the new political situation had an effect on the perspective and scope of the composition in progress. 

To begin with, the historical consecration of a young prince (kumāra) on the banks of the Sarasvatī to lead an army against the Gauḍa king Moon (śaśāṅka), reflected the mythology of Skanda, the main subject of the Purāṇa—Skanda, the god of war, who, after his consecration as General (senāpati) on the banks of the same river, led the Devas against the Asuras in order to destroy the demon king Star (tāraka). 7 The composers decided to bring their work to the attention of King Harṣavardhana, soliciting his blessing. After all, Harṣa himself confessed to be a paramamāheśvara, and his court offered a venue to the most promising literary men of the country, among whom was the king himself. 

Secondly, the king’s military successes against Gauḍa called attention to the east, bringing a Saiva settlement in western Gaud ´ . a within the purview of the composers. The Sūta, or his successor, made the decision to conclude the sanctification of the sacred landscape of northern India in Koṭivarṣa, an important commercial and religious centre in the province of Puṇḍra, which was situated 80 km northeast of the army camp of King Harṣa on the Lower Ganges, the camp where the king would eventually meet the Chinese pilgrim. The concluding chapters of the Purāṇa were reserved for philosophy and an exposition of Pāśupata yoga, which, along with devotion and pilgrimage, would bring the Māheśvara, yogin and layman alike, to paradise, the City of Siva at ´ the top of the universe (SPBh 183). 

The day arrived when the composition of the Purāṇa was concluded and the text could be copied into a carefully prepared book, a pustaka, that could be offered to the Great God and donated to the king and the community of the Māheśvaras. As usual when a work of such magnitude was completed, a solemn occasion had to be found when parts of the work could be recited and the book could be consecrated and ritually entrusted to a temple. Such an occasion was King Harṣa’s ‘arena of charitable offerings’, a spectacular event that was staged every five years at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā. The great āyatana or temple of Deva there would be an excellent repository. 

The permission was obtained. In the middle of Harṣa’s reign, when he was at the pinnacle of power, a great assembly of feudatories, Sraman ´ . as, and Brah mins, convened in Kanyakubja around the beginning of the New Year, in prepa ration of the quinquennial event. The procession to Prayāga and the festivities there were part of the Festival of Spring in the month of Caitra. The king rode on his magnificent elephant Darpaśāta towards Prayāga, scattering pearls and other riches, while dressed as Indra. His mobile court offered splendid opportu nities for staging theatrical productions, first and foremost, of course, those of 

7 SPBh 163–65. 







31 / Composition and Spread of the Skandapurāṇa 607 

his owṇThe Sūtradhāra in the Ratnāvalī and Priyadarśikā introduces Harṣa’s plays: 

Today, on the occasion of the Spring Festival, I have been respectfully called by the assembly of kings, which has convened from all quarters of the world, and which is subservient to the lotus-feet of King Srī-Hars ´ .adeva. I have been addressed as follows: ‘We have heard by hearsay that a play entitled Ratnāvalī, which is embellished by an unprecedented arrangement of the material, was composed by our lord Srī-Hars ´ .a, but we have not yet seen it performed.’ 8 

The play turned out to be a great success, and would stand the test of time. But Harṣavardhana was too great a king to hear only his own voice. A date for the first recitation of the Skandapurāṇa was agreed oṇThe Sūta and his team were offered their platform. In order to sustain the illusion of its being a work from time immemorial, an essential feature of the genre of Ancient Lore, a professional reader, a pustakavācaka, was asked to recite it. The first presentation of the work went ahead before an audience including the king, courtiers, sādhus, monks, literati of all sorts, pandits and a selection of educated Māheśvaras. It was a great tamāśā, going by the consolidated words of the Sūta and his fellow kavi, Bāṇa: 

The sages, assembling in Prayāga to bathe in the confluence of the Ga˙ngā and Yamunā on the day of full moon, see the Singer of Ancient Lore coming towards them to pay his respects. 

Dressed in white silk made in Puṇḍra, his forehead marked by a tilaka consisting of lines of orpiment on a white clay coating, his topknot ornamented by a small bunch of flowers, his lips reddened by betel, and his eyes beautified by lines of collyrium, he takes his seat and begins his performance. 

He pauses for a moment before he places, on a desk made of reed stalks that is put in front of him, a pustaka, which, although its wrapping has been removed by that time, is still wrapped, as it were, in the halo of his nails, which shine softly like the fibres of a lotus. 

They ask him about the birth of Kārttikeya, a story that equals the Mahābhārata and surpasses the Purāṇa, both of which he had recited in the Naimiṣa forest on the occasion of a brahmasattra. 

Then, while he assigns two places behind him to two flautists, Madhukara, ‘the bee’, and Pārāvata, ‘the turtle-dove’, his close associates, he turns over the fron tispiece, takes a small bundle of folios, and announces the story of the birth of Skanda, of his friendliness towards brahmins, his glory and his heroism, greater than that of the gods. 

By his chanting he enchants the hearts of his audience with sweet intonations, evoking as it were, the tinkling of the anklets of Sarasvatī, as she presents herself in his mouth, while it seems as if, by the sparkling of his teeth, he whitewashes the ink-stained syllables and worships the book with showers of white flowers. 9

The performance received favourable reactions. After having done their ritual duties, attended the great potlatch ceremony at the confluence, and paid obei sance to the Great God in his temple and the king in his court, the Sūta and his entourage returned to Vārāṇasī. More copies of the book were produced. Small emendations were made and the first transcriber’s faults slipped iṇThe different versions of the text were born. 

The subsequent transmission and distribution of the Purāṇa over various centres of the Māheśvaras added more flaws. The copying took place in focal points of Sanskrit learning, to the west and the east of Vārāṇasī. In Maga dhā, some Pāśupata ācāryas were not entirely satisfied with the text. They missed in particular an account of the Lakulīśa tradition in their own country, and, in general, they felt that the holy places in the east and in the north, in Magadhā, Orissa and Nepal, had not been done justice. They decided to amend this shortcoming by inserting an additional list of tīrthas in an adhyāya that appeared to be the right place for it. 10 

While these processes were underway, the political situation in India changed dramatically. What a few years earlier had still seemed far away or down right impossible, happened. Harṣa’s empire collapsed. Chaos prevailed all over northern India, whereas the Northeast was confronted by an unprecedented military invasion from Nepal and Tibet. 

Magadhā was the first country in which order was restored under the author ity of the dynasty of the Later Guptas. The daughter of Adityagupta married ¯ the Maukhari prince Bhogavarman, a wise move, contributing significantly to political stability. And while the kingdoms of Kanyakubja, Puṇḍra and Kāma rūpa were still in disarray, the Gupta House of Magadhā consolidated its power further by re-establishing good relations with its northern neighbour, the Lic chavi kingdom of Nepal. A daughter born of the marriage with the Maukhari prince, Vatsadevī, was married off to the Licchavi king Sivadeva. ´ 

During the last two decades of the seventh century, relations with Nepal be came close and cultural exchange between the two countries intensified. Pāśu pata yogins and ācāryas wandered from Magadhā into Nepal to visit the great shrine of Paśupatinātha, which had developed into a state sanctuary and re ceived substantial financial support from Vatsadevī and her Nepalese husband. The priesthood of this temple was firmly in the hands of a local branch of Pāśupatas. They were happy with the growing reputation of their temple. It brought them pilgrims from afar and their coffers filled accordingly. At the same time the intensive traffic kept them up-to-date with new religious devel opments and informed about the latest literary productions. 

Thus the reputation of the Skandapurāṇa spread to Nepal, and friends in Magadhā were asked for a copy. They brought one, naturally a manuscript that contained the insertion mentioning Paśupatinātha in Nepāla. The new acquisition was treasured. In order to preserve the text, the manuscript was

copied in the century that followed. And so it happened that on the twelfth day of the bright half of the month of Caitra in the year 234 (= ad 810/11) a scribe in Nepal could complete his work on the Skandapurāṇa, a labour that he had undertaken for the sake of the perfection of all beings. It would become our manuscript S1. And, if it has not contributed to our perfection, we ourselves are the only ones to blame. 

I began my lecture today with a quote from Anandavardhana’s ¯ Dhvanyāloka: ‘In the boundless universe of literature the author alone is god. In it the world revolves as per his liking.’ 11 The scenario presented here is indeed to my liking, but as you have, no doubt, understood, it is just one possible scenario among others. I hope that the reader can appreciate it for what it is and will not lose sight of its speculative nature. Nevertheless, it is the most plausible one that I can come up with after twenty years of study of the text and context of the Skandapurāṇa. It was a work of the longue dur´ee, too long maybe for modern adepts of bibliometrics, but not so for building a dedicated team of fellow students. A day like this proves that I am right at least in that respect. 

Western indologists usually leave the pre-modern history of the Subconti nent to their Indian colleagues. For this there are no good arguments, espe cially not, if we realize that classical Indian culture and religion cannot be fully comprehended without situating them in their proper historical and geograph ical context. I am fortunate in having two friends who share this view with me. Michael Willis, the active curator of South Asia at the British Museum, and Ellen Raven, just as active, working in the University of LeideṇWalking together in the field, or down in the storage rooms of the BM, Michael has always surprised me with cute and innovative insights. They have influenced my view of Gupta India to no small degree. 

Without Ellen and her work I would have been a blind man in another field, one which forms a most important source of early Indian history and icono graphy, numismatics. Not only has Ellen opened my eyes for the beauty of the Gupta coinage, she has also always found time to answer my many queries and has been willing to help me out with splendid photos from her incredible database of Indian coins. But maybe most importantly, Ellen’s scholarly cau tiousness and meticulousness has often kept me from rash conclusions. As a pair, if I may say so, Michael and Ellen are a student-of-Indian-history’s best friends. 

Our study of the Skandapurāṇa has been team work from the early nineties of the last century. It is entirely to the credit of Harunaga Isaacson and Rob Adriaensen that this project got off the ground. Rob had been my mainstay and support from my college days. His spirit lives on in all we do until this very moment. And just as great a privilege it has been to have Haru among my students and soon as a great colleague and team member. The critical edition

of the Skandapurāṇa as it has crystallized over the long years of intensive collaboration is unthinkable without his genius. 

One of the wonders of my career has been that time and again generations of students showed the interest, capacity, and stamina to join our work on the world of the Purāṇa. Yuko Yokochi, Peter Bisschop and Natasja Bosma, you have brought the kalpavr̥kṣa into blossom. Without your studies hardly a word of what I have said this afternoon could have been spokeṇTo quote an old love of mine, the philosopher Aristotle: ‘In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the whole is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the totality is something besides the parts, there is a cause of unity; [. . . ].’ 12 This cause of unity, I would like to argue, is the form (           ) of scholarship that you embody. I am deeply obliged.
