The hill of Ramtek (21◦ 28´ N, 79◦ 28´ E), c. 45 km NE of Nagpur (Maha rashtra), merits special attention because it appears to be one of the few places in India where an uninterrupted historical development from the fourth century ad to the present day can be investigated through a series of archaeological monuments which, although partly restored or built over in later periods, seem never to have been exposed to destructive and iconoclastic forces. From at least the fifth century onwards the hill, also known as Rāmagiri, Sindūragiri, or Tapaṁgiri (Tapogiri), served as a regional centre of religious activity and, probably, also had a more secular function as an outstanding strategic base controlling the highway that connected, and still connects, the central and eastern part of the basin of the Ganges with the northern DeccaṇThis could possibly explain, at least in part, why the religious structures on top of the hill have attracted the attention and care of the rulers of the area from a very early date.">

  <p>Introduction</p>
<p>The hill of Ramtek (21◦ 28´ N, 79◦ 28´ E), c. 45 km NE of Nagpur (Maha rashtra), merits special attention because it appears to be one of the few places in India where an uninterrupted historical development from the fourth century ad to the present day can be investigated through a series of archaeological monuments which, although partly restored or built over in later periods, seem never to have been exposed to destructive and iconoclastic forces. From at least the fifth century onwards the hill, also known as Rāmagiri, Sindūragiri, or Tapaṁgiri (Tapogiri), served as a regional centre of religious activity and, probably, also had a more secular function as an outstanding strategic base controlling the highway that connected, and still connects, the central and eastern part of the basin of the Ganges with the northern DeccaṇThis could possibly explain, at least in part, why the religious structures on top of the hill have attracted the attention and care of the rulers of the area from a very early date.</p>
<p>Archaeological explorations in the Nagpur Plain during the last two decades have brought to light a great number of interesting sites belonging to the cul ture of the Vākāṭakas (fourth-fifth centuries), notably Nagardhan and adja cent Hamlapuri (7 km south of Ramtek), generally considered to be the area of the Vākāṭaka capital, Nandivardhana. In Hamlapuri, a splendid collection of Buddhist bronzes was recently found which seems to prove, in the words of Jamkhedkar, ‘that Buddhism was a living faith under the Brahmanical Vākāṭakas’. 1 Whereas other Vākāṭaka centres of culture fell into decay and were gradually obliterated, 2 Ramtek survived and to date still has four intact and one impaired Vākāṭaka temples (four of them still containing the original idol), besides a small cave-temple and a cave-reclusory, probably also dating back to this period. Moreover, at least one stone tank situated on the top of</p>

<p>the hill appears to preserve very old cloister constructions which could like wise go back to the Vākāṭaka period. In addition, the hill and its immediate surroundings contain at least one undamaged temple that may go back to the Cālukya period (the Kālikā Temple c. 200 m NW of the hill), and temples and tanks constructed during the Yādava period (twelfth–thirteenth centuries), the Vijayanagara period (fifteenth–sixteenth centuries), as well as the Mārāṭha pe riod (eighteenth century and later). In view of this astonishing richness in historical monuments, it is surprising to discover that the hill has been sys tematically ignored in all standard works dealing with the history of Indian art and architecture. 3</p>
<p>In two articles the present author has described the archaeological remains of Ramtek Hill on the basis of an inventory made during field-work in November 1986 and has evaluated the historical development of the religious structure of the Ramtek complex by making use of this inventory. 4 Among the collected data are several inscriptions which could be only referred to in the above mentioned articles, but which deserve a more detailed treatment. This is the purpose of the present paper. For an historical evaluation of the religious content of these inscriptions the reader is referred to the second of the two articles (Bakker 1990b).</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there are four Sanskrit inscriptions to be found in temples on the Ramtek Hill, as well as two ancient pieces of graffiti. Three inscriptions and the graffiti are found on the walls and pillars of one of the two Narasiṁha temples, the so-called Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple; the other lengthy inscription is found in the Lakṣmaṇa Temple. The latter has been published by Mirashi and Kulkarni in Epigraphia Indica, xxv (1939-40), 7– 20. However, that edition does not attempt to restore the original metrical composition of the text, nor is a translation giveṇThe publication of the oldest inscription, found in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple, cannot be presented here. Its publication is envisaged by the Archaeological Survey of India, and here we can only note what has been published about it so far. In a recent article Jamkhedkar observed:</p>
<p>During conservation (i.e. of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple), an inscription, cov ered with lime plaster, was discovered on the temple wall beneath the thick layers of white wash. This 14-line record in nail-headed Gupta Brahmi characters, caused to be carved by Prabhavati Gupta herself, refers to the god as Prabhavati svamiṇOn the basis of the internal evidence the temple as well as the image can be dated to c. 415–425 ad [. . . ] The presence of a cluster of stone temples enshrining differ ent avatāras of Viṣṇu (viz. Trivikrama, Varāha) at Ramtek has established beyond doubt the prevalence of a Bhāgavata cult on parallel lines with that popular in the Gupta court. On architectural, sculptural and epigraphical evidence these can be</p>
<p>3 I looked in vain in Cousens 1931, Brown 1976, Deglurkar 1974, Verma 1973, Deshpande 1985, Huntington 1985, Harle 1986. A short treatment of two of the Vākāṭaka temples is found in Williams 1983, 225–27.</p>

<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 81</p>
<p>firmly dated at least to the first quarter of the fifth century ad. The stylistic char acteristic observed in the images of Viṣṇu found at Nagra, Nandapuri (Ramtek) and Mandhal suggest that on art historical considerations, the introduction of Vaiṣṇavism in the Vidarbha area can be further pushed back, at least by half a century. 5</p>
<p>One may add that the other Narasiṁha temple, which is referred to as the Rudra–Narasiṁha Temple, and is not far from the first, seems to be older still. It is similar to the first in construction as well as in having the huge Narasiṁha idol installed (cf. below, Plates 56 and 57). It is, however, less refined, lacking the two small windows and the ornamentation along the doorposts and on the outer walls. However, it has eight ‘firepits’ (?) (kuṇḍas) along its sides, above which are small pedestals constructed against the temple wall on which, orig inally, dikpāla deities may have been installed. Two fragments of such images have been found and are at present stored in the Central Nagpur Museum.</p>
<p>If the statement of Jamkhedkar quoted above proves to be correct, we should assign the earliest Narasiṁha temple to the beginning of the fifth century. However, stylistic considerations would favour a somewhat later dating, say, the middle or second half of the fifth century, a date to which the two pieces of graffiti also seem to point. 6</p>
<p>The graffiti</p>
<p>The first graffito is found on a square pillar at the temple entrance. It is written in Deccani-style characters with solid triangular head-marks (Plate 6). The letter-forms, which show a tendency to roundedness, resemble the scripts of the Deccan of the fifth-century Vākāṭakas and Kadambas. 7 The inscription reads: śrīmadanalobha, evidently the name of one of the early visitors.</p>
<p>The other graffito is found on the left square pillar that stands in front of the cella (Plate 7). Its characters show a mixture of solid triangular and block head-marks and have notches in the horizontal bars. 8 The last quadrangular letter with a dot inside resembles the tha of the Western Cālukya script of the sixth century. 9 Hence the inscription may date from the fifth–sixth century. It reads: bharatanātha, probably also the name of a devotee. 10</p>

<p>The two short Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple inscriptions</p>
<p>On the same pillar on which the second graffito is found, on the side that faces the entrance, is engraved a short Sanskrit inscriptioṇAn outwardly very similar inscription is found on the parallel pillar at the right side of the cella entrance. Both pillars have recently been connected by an iron frame which screens off the entrance of that part of the temple where the image is installed. The appearance of both parallel inscriptions on the two pillars in front of the garbhagr̥ha strongly suggests that they somehow belong together and were engraved at about the same time.</p>
<p>As it happens, photographs of both inscriptions have been published in In dian Archaeology 1982–83—A Review (p. 167), but this might have been more or less accidental, since the description of these two plates (p. 137) confuses them with the reported ‘Prabhāvatī Guptā inscription’ ‘on the southern wall of the maṇḍapa’. Nothing is said as to the contents of the two parallel in scriptions, and they certainly do not endorse the statement made in the IAR that the temple ‘on the basis of these inscriptions could definitely be dated to the fifth to sixth century ad’. 11 In fact, both inscriptions belong to the Yādava period as will be shown below. I shall refer to these two inscriptions as Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Ramtek Inscription No. 1 &amp; No. 2.</p>

<p>Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Ramtek Inscription No. 1</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<p>The inscription is written in clear Nāgarī script. Only a few syllables at the margins have been effaced. The type of character agrees with other Yādava in scriptions, using occasionally pr̥ṣṭhamātrā akṣaras for non-initial vowel signs. 12</p>
<p>12 Cf. Med. Ind. Pal., II, ‘Nagari’ (W. &amp; ṢIndia, Yadava, 13th century). One of the few deviations appears to be the alternative form of ra.</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 85</p>
<p>The inscription can be dated in the Sārvarin-year (i.e. the 34th year of the ´ Br̥haspati Cycle) at the time of the reign of King Siṁhaṇa, which yields the date ad 1240. 13</p>
<p>The text is a mixture of verse (śloka) and prose (i.e. of gadya and padya). The verses appear to contain several double-entendres (śleṣa), whereas the last hemistich is to be read twice (indicated by the figure 2 between daṇḍas) in a different way in order to make a complete śloka verse. This is made explicit by the prose statement that it should be understood as a samudgayamaka, i.e. that the same akṣaras can be grouped into two ways yielding different, in fact opposite meanings. 14 Thus we can read: vaikalyatām . . . ’bhaktasya or vai kalyatām . . . bhaktasya.</p>
<p>The text testifies to the pilgrimage to Ramtek and worship of Narasiṁha (the deity of the temple in which the inscription is found) by a certain Sārṅga- ´ deva son of Kāmadeva. The Srīnr ´ .hari who is praised may, besides the obvious Narasiṁha, also be the Yādava king Siṁhaṇa whose name marks him as a ‘lion among men’. Sārṅgadeva is called ´ tārkikaśekhara, which excludes the possibility of his being identical with the musician Sārṅgadeva, author of the ´ Saṁgītaratnākara, who worked at the court of the Yādava king Siṁhaṇa and whose father we know to have been Soḍḍhala. 15</p>
<p>The first śloka is an invocation of the goddess Sarasvatī. When we resolve the śleṣa, however, we read the poet’s own praise. Moreover, it would seem that the philosopher and poet in referring to Sarasvatī’s (Goddess of Learning, i.e. ‘learning’) descent from Trivikrama (i.e. Viṣṇu) are making a pun on their own lineages. It is well-known that the members of the distinguished and learned family that traced its origin back to Trivikrama held important offices at the court of the Yādavas, notably Caṅgadeva, who was the astronomer of King Siṁhaṇa.16 Sārṅgadeva could have been a member of this family. ´ The ancestral Trivikrama, who belonged to the Sān ´ . ḍilya gotra, is called kavi cakravartin, ‘Prince of the Poets’, in the Patna Inscription, 17 and he is, in all likelihood, identical to the author of the Nalacampū or Damayantīkathā, viz. Trivikramabhaṭṭa, who flourished at the beginning of the tenth century ad.18 This excludes the possibility that the poet Trivikrama mentioned in the present inscription who is said to sing the praise of Sārṅgadeva—which might be taken ´ to mean that Sārṅgadeva commissioned him to compose this inscription for ´ him—is the same as the ‘Prince of the Poets’ who wrote the Nalacampū.</p>
<p>Consequently, there were two poets Trivikrama, one living in the tenth cen tury, the other in the middle of the thirteenth. Like the first, the second</p>

<p>Trivikrama apparently made use of the campū style of compositioṇThis result agrees perfectly with the outcome of an investigation of Mirashi with respect to the author of the Madālasācampū, who earlier had been generally held to be identical with his namesake, the author of the Nalacampū. Mirashi has argued convincingly that the poet Trivikrama who wrote the Madālasācampū, and who was a devotee of Viṣṇu rather than of Siva, as was the author of ´ the Nalacampū, was not the same as the author of the Nalacampū, who in his introduction ‘tells us that he was born in the Sān ´ . ḍilya gotra and was the son of Devāditya (v.l. Nemāditya) and grandson of Srīdhara’. ´ 19 According to Mirashi, the second Trivikrama, who does not give any particulars about his descent in his work of the Madālasācampū, is ‘much inferior’ as a poet and wrote ‘apparently in a much later age’. 20</p>
<p>If our identification of the poet Trivikrama of the inscription with the author of the Madālasācampū is correct, this ‘later age’ can now be determined as the middle of the thirteenth century; he may have been also the author of a verse quoted in Jalhaṇa’s Sūktimuktāvalī (p. 172, v. 13.), 21 which was composed in the court of the Yādavas in ad 1258. The possible hint at Trivikramabhaṭṭa in the first śloka of the inscription makes it conceivable that the second Trivikrama was well aware of his illustrious predecessor whose style he sought to imitate.</p>
<p>Finally, in the third verse the inscription testifies to the importance that was attached by that time to the worship of Rāma. Apart from the samudgaya maka, this verse, like the first two, may also contain a śleṣa, since ‘Rāma’ was also the name of the chief general of King Siṁhaṇa, who had succeeded his fa ther Kholeśvara in his military profession and who was killed in an expedition against Gujarat in the year of the present inscription or shortly before it. 22</p>

<p>Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Ramtek Inscription No. 2</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<p>The characters of the inscription are the same as in the previous one, the writing a little looser and less neat. Evidently less time and effort was spent on the engraving of this inscription, but on the whole, as we have already noted, the appearance of the two inscriptions gives the impression that they were made at the same occasion.</p>
<p>The present inscription contains one verse in Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita metre. Its connexion with the first inscription seems to be borne out by its contents. Its author evidently is Trivikrama, who calls himself a ‘jewel-mine of composition’, and this poet may be the same as the one who composed the inscription for Sārṅgadeva. Obviously, Trivikrama, after the completion of his assignment, ´ used the occasion to have his own inscription engraved. This secondariness could explain why it was apparently carried out with less care.</p>
<p>If this identification is correct, the inscription supplies us with some addi tional information about the author of the Madālasācampū. He was a brahmin, son of Srīdhara, also a poet, and grandson of Cāmun ´ . ḍa, who is said to have been an adhipati in Vainyapura.</p>
<p>Trivikrama came to Ramtek with his brother Rāghava to worship Rāma. His place of residence is not mentioned, but could have been the court of King Siṁhaṇa to which also Sārṅgadeva might have belonged. His grandfather hailed ´ from Vainyapura, his father from Kāsarapura, two unidentifiable toponyms.</p>
<p>The Ramtek Stone Inscription of the time of Ramacandra ¯</p>
<p>We now turn to the longest inscription found at Ramtek, the so-called Ramtek Stone Inscription of the time of Rāmacandra. A technical description of it has been given by Mirashi and Kulkarni, who published a first edition in Epigraphia Indica xxv. The historical conclusions reached by Mirashi, ascribing the in scription to the Yādava king Rāmacandra (i.e. ‘last quarter of the thirteenth century ad’) against the earlier opinion of Kielhorn, who identified Siṁhaṇa and Rāmacandra with homonymous princes of the Raipur branch of the Hai haya dynasty, have been corroborated by later research and need no further discussion. 23</p>
<p>I shall give a synopsis of the contents and a metrical restoration of the text. Those verses that are sufficiently legible will be translated. For technical details of the inscription (‘which is incised on a large slab let into the wall on the right hand side of the door of the garbhagr̥ha in the temple of Lakṣmaṇa’) the reader is referred to Epigraphia Indica.24 The numbering of the verses is mine. The first three lines of the inscription have suffered so much that only a few words are legible, too little to restore the metre. On account of the average number of verses contained in one line we conjecture that the first three lines contained five or six verses. Our numbering therefore starts with verse 6.</p>

<p>24 EI XXV, 7 ff.</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 89</p>
<p>Synopsis of the contents</p>
<p>Verses 1–28 describe the exploits of the Yādava dynasty (v. 8) which traces its origin back to Yadu (v. 9). Vv. 12–21 seem to be concerned with the deeds of King Bhillama and his successor Jaitrapāla (Jaitugi) ad 1191–1210 (v. 15), whose victory over Rudra (probably Rudradeva of the Kākatīyas) is mentioned in v. 12. 25 His victories against the Andhras and Colas appear in v. 14, against the Gurjaras in v. 15.</p>
<p>Vv. 22–24 seem to deal with King Siṁhaṇa (v. 22), whose exploits on the battlefield are praised (v. 23) and who is said to have reached the ultimate peace (śāntiṁparamām avāpa). Then the inscription passes on to his successor, who must be King Kr̥ṣṇa (ad 1247–60), who ruled the earth, was a tree of tranquility (viśrāmataru) for the petitioners who appealed to him never in vain (v. 25) and who finally, after pacifying the whole earth, made it forget its grief over the loss of King Siṁhaṇa (v. 27).</p>
<p>Vv. 28–29 seem to introduce King Rāmacandra (ad 1271–1310), either with or without explicitly mentioning his immediate predecessors, viz. King Mahādeva, his uncle, and Ammaṇa, the latter’s soṇtat◦ in tatsutah. (v. 29c) may hence refer to King Kr̥ṣṇa, father of Rāmacandra, whereas the epithet vāyināyaka (29a) could possibly allude to the ruse by means of which Rāmacandra wrested the throne from his cousin Ammaṇa. This episode is told in another inscription of Rāmacandra (EI xxv, 199–225 v. 14), where it is said that the young pretender to the throne succeeded in entering the palace of his cousin in the guise of a leader (or actor) (nāyaka) of a theatrical troupe which in reality consisted of his comrades. Maybe we should read vājināyaka (‘the impetuous hero’) instead of vāyināyaka, which does not seem to make sense.</p>
<p>V. 30 introduces Rāghavadeva on whom King Rāmacandra devolved the responsibilities for the welfare of the empire in order that he himself could enjoy the arts of his harem-ladies (v. 31). Of this Rāghava it is said that he held the office of ‘superintendent of the guard of the royal bed-chamber’ (sayyāpālakulādhīśa) (vv. 32, 38). He gained this new position, as it would seem, thanks to his devotion to Vaidyanātha (Siva?) (v. 33), and he was mar- ´ ried to the most lovely and virtuous lady Rājāyī, who personified happiness and beauty (v. 34). Rāghava, invested with this honourable charge, considered his foremost duty (v. 118); what this involved seems to have been expressed in the part of the inscription that has become illegible, but Mirashi’s supposition appears plausible: ‘some repairs done to the temple of Lakṣmaṇa where the inscription is put up. Māideva (Māyideva), who is mentioned in ll. 70 f., seems to have been a local official in charge of the work’. 26</p>
<p>It seems likely that this Rāghava is the same as Raghu ‘the deputy and minister of the late R´a´ı R´am Deo’ who joined the rebellion of Rāmacandra’s</p>
<p>25 Cf. Bombay Gaz. I, 239, 522; Bhandarkar 1928, 186; Yazdani 1960 I, 529.</p>

<p>son-in-law, Harapāladeva, against the Sultan of Delhi and whose miserable death at the hand of Khusraw Khān is described in the Nuh Sipihr by Amīr Khusraw. 27 There is nothing to suggest an identity with Rāghava, brother of Trivikrama, who features in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Ramtek Inscription No. 2.</p>
<p>The main part of the inscription is concerned with the eulogy (Māhātmya) of Rāma and his most holy abode, the Sindūra Mountain (i.e. Rāmagiri, or Ramtek) (vv. 39–116). As such, the text provides an early, and what is more, datable forerunner of the Sindūragirimāhātmya of which only a late eighteenth century version in 16 chapters is now available (recently edited by ṢṀAyachit and hereafter referred to by the siglum SM). 28</p>
<p>In order to discover a way of crossing the unfathomable ocean of existence, Rāghava addressed his guru (vv. 35–37). In response the latter recites the Sindūragirimāhātmya. The guru starts proclaiming that of all ten avatāras of Viṣṇu, Rāma is the foremost (v. 39). He lives on this mountain, also called Tapaṁgiri, together with Hanumat (v. 40). Before (prāg) Rāma (i.e. in the Kr̥tayuga), the mountain was resorted to by Narasiṁha, who killed the ‘en emy of the gods’ (i.e. Hiraṇyakaśipu) here. His blood gave the mountain its red colour (sindūra), hence the name Sindūragiri (v. 42). Thus Rāma and Narasiṁha appear to be the two principal gods of this tīrtha.</p>
<p>After these introductory remarks, Rāghava’s guru seems to expose the trans mission of the Māhātmya. It would seem that Agastya (‘who had protected the ocean by keeping it in his mouth’, v. 44) heard the story in Brahmā’s</p>
<p>27 Elliot and Dowson III, 557 f.; cf. Yazdani 1960 II, 556.</p>
<p>28 Ayachit 1985. It might be useful to quote here some information concerning this Māhā tmya given in Bakker 1990b, 76.</p>
<p>The Sindūragirimāhātmya as it is published by Dr. Ayachit appears to be a product of the second half of the eighteenth century. It contains sixteen chapters and is based on three MSS preserved in Ramtek and Nagpur. The Mairāl family, whom I visited in Ramtek village, claims that this text was written by one of their ancestors, Bābū Mairāl, who had lived at the court of the Gaikwars in Baroda in the service of the Peshwa. At the end of his life (c. ad 1770–1800) this Bābū Mairāl returned to Ramtek to write several books, all of which are said to have been destroyed by a fire apart from the Sindūragirimāhātmya in 16 chapters. This information is based on an unpublished biography written by his son, the autograph of which is kept in the Viṭṭhal Maṇḍir in Ramtek, which is owned by the Mairāl family. However, although this claim does not seem to be completely unfounded, it is very unlikely that the Māhātmya text was a new creation of Bābū Mairāl. Divergencies in the MS material speak against it, especially as presented by MS ‘U’ used by Ayachit for his edition (Nagpur University collection). Thanks to the help of Dr. Bühnemann, I have recently become acquainted with what seems to be the only MS of the Sindūragirimāhātmya preserved outside the region, viz. a MS kept in the Library at Trivandrum (No. 10197). This MS seems to be related to the deviating MS ‘U’. Moreover, there appears to have existed a local Māhātmya comprising 45 adhyāyas. A MS of it was kept in Ramtek village and has been consulted by Mirashi, but is now irretrievably lost (Mirashi in EI XXV, 8, 10, 11; cf. Hiralal 1908, 206). From all this we conclude that there may have existed a local Māhātmya tradition in Ramtek which produced a new up-to-date recension in 16 adhyāyas when the place was flourishing once again in the Marāṭhā period.</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 91</p>
<p>palace and subsequently communicated it to Rāma, who visited his hermitage (vv. 44–46). Agastya is also responsible for Rāma’s installation on this hill (v. 110; cf. SM 16.63). Traditionally Agastya’s hermitage is located on the southern flank of the Vindhya mountains (cf. SM 9.35: vindhyasya dakṣiṇe pārśve samīpe nandivardhanam | gautamasyāgnikoṇe vai nairr̥tye kumbhajasya vai k 35 k), and today a tirtha on top of the hill is considered as the place where Agastya practised his tapas (in the precincts of the Rāma–Kr̥ṣṇa temple near the Bhairava Darwāzā). The line of transmission of the Māhātmya, Brahmā– Agastya–Rāma–other sages, etc., corresponds to the one presented in the SM 6.8–14.</p>
<p>Vv. 47–116 contain the actual Māhātmya of Sindūragiri as revealed by Agastya. After having proclaimed the merit that accrues to one who stays on this mountain, especially after keeping a fast and vigil on a Viṣṇu-day (probably the 11th of each pakṣa) (vv. 47–51), the text goes on to mention the four dvārapālas, or guardians of the kṣetra (v. 52). They are the same as described in the SM 2.1, viz. Ghaṇṭeśvara, Sudheśvara (= Siddheśvara ?), Kedāreśvara and Añjaneya (i.e. Hanumat). ¯</p>
<p>Next the inscription describes the ‘eight tīrthas’ (cf. v. 64) that, accord ing to the SM 5.4, encircle the pond Ambatīrtha (v. 60) (in SM known as Ambakuṇḍa and now called Ambālā Tālāb). This pond lies at the eastern end of the horseshoe-shaped Rāmagiri hill and is nowadays surrounded by many temples, most of which date from the Bhonsle period. The same eight holy places are described in SM 5.1–7: Gaṅgāsrotas (which must have been men tioned in v. 55; cf. SM 5.4), Saṅkhatīrtha (v. 56), Agnitīrtha (v. 58), Ambikāpati ´ (v. 60), Varuṇatīrtha (v. 61), Suklatīrtha (v. 62), Nr ´ .siṁhatīrtha (v. 63), and the eighth, Kurukṣetratīrtha (v. 64).</p>
<p>Then a group of ‘five tīrthas’ is described (tīrthapañcaka, vv. 65–70), of which only three are known today and mentioned, not coherently, in the SṀThe first three are Lakṣmītīrtha (v. 66), Haṁsatīrtha (v. 67), Cakratīrtha (v. 68; SM 7.25–29). According to Mirashi (1959, 101) this latter could be the pond today called Cākorḍā lying one mile to the south of the hill. 29 The fourth is Dhanustīrtha (v. 69; SM 7.29–35). Here one should offer a bow, preferably of gold (cf. SM 7.31–32). The fifth is Pitr̥tīrtha (v. 70), where one should bathe and offer a pitr̥tarpaṇa. This tīrtha is described at length in SM 4.3–16, where it is said that its modern name is Rāmagayā (cf. v. 80, in which this name is mentioned). It could be modern Gāyakhurī near Khiṁḍsī Lake (Mirashi 1959, 101), or the Ambālā tank (Hiralal 1908, 205).</p>
<p>Before beginning the description of the principal holy places on the mountain itself, the text seems to make another tour around the hill, starting in the west (Vājimedhatīrtha v. 71; cf. SM 7.43 where an Aśvamedhatīrtha is located in the</p>
<p>29 The Cakratīrtha is said to have been created by Viṣṇu’s cakra called Sudarśana; the fact that this is made explicit in v. 68 may point to an awareness of the old name of the lake north of the hill, called ‘Sudarśana’ in the Vākāṭaka inscription in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple (see below, p. 144).</p>
<p>south), along the River Kalipā and its confluence with the Suranadī (vv. 72– 74), which is to be located to the north and northeast of the hill in accordance with the present situation (cf. SM 2.16–28, 3.1–31; below, n. 71 on p. 144), and Maṇikālakuṇḍa (v. 75) which, contrary to what is suggested in the inscription, in the SM 2.6 is located in the west, and ending with the Mokṣakuṇḍa in the south (v. 76; cf. SM 2.4).</p>
<p>The inscription continues with a description of the tīrthas on or by the side of the hill. The first three are tanks: Rāmatīrtha, Sindūravāpī, and Karpūravāpī. The two latter are among the most noteworthy constructions at Rāmagiri. The Karpūravāpī lies at the foot of the northern flank of the hill (v. 82). It consists of a tank of stone with arcades on four sides (its eastern and part of its northern sides now in ruins), along with a temple complex with five cellas, three of which are crowned by śikharas situated on the western side. The compound is a good example of the thirteenth-century so-called Hemādpanti style.</p>
<p>The Sindūravāpī (v. 81) is a deep, well-constructed tank of stone with an entrance gate, which may date from the Mārāṭha period, and cloisters on its northern side, which are probably earlier than the Yādava period. The tank is situated on top of the hill to the east of the main temple complex. In its vicinity (samīpatas, v. 81) the Rāmatīrtha is said to be found. We hazzard the idea that a predecessor of the tank that is situated beside the main temple complex might have been meant, a tank which nowadays is known as the Sītecī Nhāṇī (or Sītā’s Bathing Place), since no other bathing place, let alone an old one, is found elsewhere in the close surroundings of the Sindūravāpī. If, on the other hand, as is assumed by Mirashi (1959, 102), this ‘Rāmatīrtha’ is identical with the reservoir northeast of the hill, which according to the SM was formerly called Īśāla and today Rām Sāgar or Rāmatirtha (SM 15.40: īśālākhyaṁpurā nāmādhunā puṣkaraṁśubham | rāmatīrtham idānīṁtu rāma snānena te bhavet k), the fact would remain that a conspicuous tank on the Rāmagiri is not recorded in the inscriptioṇThe inscription does not make a reference to a bathing place of Sītā (a Sītākuṇḍa or a Sītātīrtha). 30 The tank near the entrance of the main temple-complex may have been restored and embellished on several later occasions. Thus the sculptured relief at its western wall seems to point to the Vijayanagara period. 31 The Rāmatīrtha is the only tank to which the inscription devotes three stanzas, and this, together</p>
<p>30 This, along with the fact that the inscription does not make any allusion to the Yakṣa of Kālidāsa’s Meghadūta (cf. below, pp. 349 f.), seems to imply that the thirteenth-century author was not aware of an identity of the Ramtek Hill with a Rāmagiri of which ‘the waters were hallowed by the bathing of Janaka’s daughter’ (Meghadūta 1). This, again, makes Mirashi’s identification more problematic. On the other hand, Rāma’s footprints occur in v. 83 and a ‘Nhāṇi Sīteci’ is mentioned in the fourteenth-century Mahānubhāva text, the Sthānapothī (p. 5). The lake to the north of the hill is known to the Vākāṭaka inscription in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple as ‘Sudarśana’ (see below, p. 144), a name evidently no longer in use in the 13th century (but see above, n. 29 on p. 91).</p>
<p>31 Bakker 1989c, 97 ff.</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 93</p>
<p>with its location in the neighbourhood of the Sindūravāpī, points to the fact that is was a prominent holy place.</p>
<p>After these three tanks, sanctuaries of tutelary deities of Saiva nature, which ´ appear to have been connected with the access to the summit, are listed: Gaje ndravadana (v. 84), Dharmeśvara (v. 85; SM 5.9), Dhūmrākṣa, which is said to be the spot where the śūdra ascetic Sam ´ . buka was killed by the sword ‘Can drahāsa’ which Rāma had taken from Rāvaṇa (v. 86; cf. Rāmāyaṇa 7.17; SM 14), but which originally might have been a yakṣa (rākṣasa) shrine, 32 and Muktīśvara (v. 87).</p>
<p>Having thus reached the top again the Māhātmya concludes with the eulogy of the main deities who have their abode on the hill and who appear to have been the principal objects of worship (vv. 88–116). Six avatāras are mentioned, the first being Viṣṇu in his incarnation of Gopāla, who is the full moon (re flected) in the ocean of bliss of the gopīs (v. 88). Then Narasiṁha is mentioned again, the fourth descent, who out of compassion protected the earth which was tortured by a torrent of heat (v. 89). As already observed, the myth of Narasiṁha is adduced to account for the name of the mountain, and no doubt the cult of Narasiṁha has old roots here, as is testified by the two fifth-century temples dedicated to him. The third incarnation described is that of the boar, Adikola (Varāha), who lifted the earth on his tusk out of the flood of the seven ¯ oceans (v. 90). That the worship of Varāha also goes back to early days is evident from the huge Vākāṭaka image of a boar not far from the Narasiṁha temples (see Plate 63).</p>
<p>The eulogy of the family of Rāmacandra begins with his father, Paṅktiratha (i.e. Daśaratha; v. 91), who lives here after his abdication, and with Rāma’s two sons, Kuśa and Lava (v. 92), but is then interrupted by two heterologous deities, Mahāsiddhi and Mahābhairava (vv. 93 f.), which can only be accounted for if we assume that the inscription follows an actual topographical patterṇThe shrine of Mahāsiddhi, where the eight Mātr̥kās were installed, no longer exists, but I found an old relief of the eight mother-goddesses, evidently displaced, in the main cella of the Karpūravāpī compound. Mahābhairava likewise has disappeared, yet a temple of his, nearby Bhogarāma, is also mentioned in the Sthānapothī.33</p>
<p>The inscription reverts to the retinue of Rāma in verse 95, describing Hanu mat (Pavanaja), partly as an incarnation of Bhairava, viz. as possessing five mouths, as moon-crested, with ten arms, three eyes, blazing ferociously like a million rising suns, and partly as Rāma’s devout servant, help and mainstay of all devotees who direct their thoughts to him. The Hanumat Temple is found in the innermost court, right next to the Lakṣmaṇa Temple which is named in the next verse (v. 96).</p>
<p>Lakṣmaṇa, in whose temple the present inscription is found, is said to be Saṅkha (the serpent/the conch), whom we suppose to be homologous with ´</p>
<p>32 See Bakker 2010a (below, p. 349).</p>
<p>33 Sthānapothi, 4.</p>
<p>Ses ´ .a, though he is explicitly denied a śaṅkha nature. 34 Does the Lakṣmaṇa Temple replace an older nāga sanctuary? In Rāma’s proximity Sītā is present, the remembrance of whose name makes a mountain of sins disappear (v. 97). And then, of course, there are several images of Rāma (Viṣṇu) himself (v. 98). They appear to be described in the next four verses (vv. 99–102).</p>
<p>The foremost (ādi) of these is referred to as Adirāma (v. 99), in all likelihood ¯ the name of the main Rāma temple just behind the Lakṣmaṇa Mandir. The second is Bhogarāma (v. 100), which is the name of the Vākāṭaka temple that nowadays is in the possession of the Mahānubhāva sect. The third, Guptarāma, (v. 101), refers to a small (Vākāṭaka) temple partly carved into a recess in the rock below the path that leads up to the hill. And, finally, Saṅkharāma which, ´ in view of Lakṣmaṇa’s designation as Saṅkha (v. 96), may refer to the Laks ´ .maṇa Temple, thus being an appropriate conclusion of the tour of the holy places of Ramtek as described in the inscription in question, found in this very temple.</p>
<p>The Māhātmya ends with a stotra, an Aṣṭaka praising Rāmacandra in eight Sārdūlavikrīd ´ . ita verses. The worn state of great parts of it makes it hard to read, but from what remains it appears that Rāma is thought identical with Viṣṇu–Nārāyaṇa, equated with the primordial Puruṣa (v. 111), the Lord of the Advaita doctrine (v. 104), who, next to the exploits known from the Rāmāyaṇa, churned the ocean of milk (v. 105), the remembrance of whose Name (rāmeti nāma, v. 108) leads his devotees to the realm of bliss, and who has been installed on the Sindūra Mountain by Agastya (v. 100).</p>
<p>The last part of the inscription is practically illegible. What it could possibly contain has already been discussed above.</p>
<p>Editorial principles</p>
<p>The following edition of this inscription is based on two publications of it by Mi rashi; the first one (together with Kulkarni) referred to as M(l), in Epigraphia Indica XXV (1939–40), the second one in an appendix of his book Meghadūta mem. Rāmagiri arthāt Rāmṭek (Nagpur 1959), referred to as M(2). Unfortu nately, I was not allowed to take photographs or a rubbing of the inscription stone and no other such material was available to me.</p>
<p>On the whole, M(1) is to be preferred above M(2), but occasionally the reading of M(2) seems more plausible. Mirashi does not account for the dis crepancies between his two editions. M(1) gives an estimate of the number of syllables erased or illegible. This made it possible to restore the metrical composition of the text. I took advantage of the metres that were suggested by</p>
<p>34 Hiralal 1908, 206 (n. 14). Saṅkha is one of the main Nāgas mentioned in MBh 1.31.8, ´ 5.101.12. But a śaṅkha nature is denied to Lakṣmaṇa, who is generally considered to be an incarnation of Ses ´ .a, to which also the first pāda of v. 96 seems to refer (‘carrying the world on his heads’). The usual absence of snake-hoods and other nāga characteristics in Lakṣmaṇa’s iconography could possibly explain this denial (cf. Mirashi 1964a, 143), but aśaṅkhātmaka may play on the meaning of śaṅkha, ‘conch’, which would deny Lakṣmaṇa a white colour.</p>

<p>M(1) in footnotes. The numbers of the lines are given in bold face. Rejected readings are given in the apparatus. In the majority of cases this applies to readings given in M(2). I have accepted most of the emendations proposed by Mirashi (these concern mostly orthographic matters such as kha instead of ṣa) and added some of my owṇThe actual reading of the inscription is given in the apparatus indicated by the siglum E. Homorganic nasals have been silently written wherever required by standard orthography.</p>
<p>Conjectural readings by Mirashi and myself are, if considered plausible enough, given in the text between angular brackets h i, or else in the apparatus. Accepted alterations (emendations) are indicated by round brackets ( ). It is not clear whether the daṇḍas that appear in Mirashi’s text are his own or actually found in the inscriptioṇOccasionally they interfere with the metre, more often they are missing at the end of a verse or hemistich. The daṇḍas given in the present edition indicate the metrical divisions and are my own without claim of authenticity. The same applies to the numbering of the verses. All emendations and conjectures by Mirashi that are metrically incorrect have been rejected and relegated to the apparatus, since, as will be proved, the author of the inscription was a skilful poet who knew his prosody.</p>

<p>Translation</p>
<p>27 Owing to the nectar stream of whose glory, the essence of the boundless ocean of existence, the earth has shed her grief at the loss of the illustrious King Siṁhaṇa &hellip;</p>
<p>29 His son, known on earth as Vāyināyaka on account of the abundance of glory . . . , became famous throughout the world, and no one that equalled him was ever heard of here.</p>
<p>30 Of him again this . . . (called) Rāghavadeva . . .</p>
<p>31 After the illustrious lord Rāmacandra had entrusted him, who was giving due weight to the virtues . . . , with the care of the magnificent prosperity of his thriving empire, he (himself), conversing in his pleasure garden with his harem-ladies, who are (skilled) in all the arts and sports of love . . .</p>
<p>34 . . . just as endurance (adorns) the steadfast and faithfulness the virtuous one of noble birth, so the most lovely Rājāyī, who is a store of virtues and embodies happiness and beauty, adorns him who is a receptacle of virtue &hellip;</p>
<p>35 Thereupon he has asked a brahmin, whose illuminating splendour resembles that of the sun . . . , (thinking): ‘he should be my guru’.</p>
<p>36 ‘O Lord, you know everything; therefore I ask you with ardent desire . . . ’ 38 O Superintendent of the Royal Bedchamber, listen to this word of mine; there is nothing superior to Hari to enable one to cross the ocean of exis tence.</p>
<p>39 Though there are ten avatars of His, Rāma is the (foremost) of them . . . 40 How can I describe that unsurpassed, wonderful efficacy of this mountain Tapaṁgiri, where he, (the scion of the Raghu race), who is the supreme object of meditation of the yogis, lives together with the Son of the Wind (i.e. Hanumat)?</p>
<p>42 Earlier, it was here that god Nr̥hari had ripped open the chest of Surāri (i.e. Hiraṇyakaśipu) with his sharp claws; reddened by the stream of his blood, this (mountain became known as Sindūragiri).</p>
<p>43 For who else, even if he resembles Br̥haspati, would thus know how to tell yonder . . . ?</p>
<p>44 The lord of the sages, who has protected the ocean by keeping it in his mouth (i.e. Agastya) . . .</p>
<p>45 . . . is known here as (Gauta)meśvara.</p>
<p>46 After the lord of the sages who was born in a pot (i.e. Agastya) had heard the wonderful efficacy of this mountain in the audience-hall of Brahmā . . . , (he told it) to Rāma.</p>
<p>47 A man who has seen with due respect . . . , he is liberated from the sin of killing a brahmin.</p>
<p>50 Those who fast on a day sacred to Viṣṇu and keep a vigil in front of Raghu nandana on Tapaṁgiri . . . 52 Ghaṇṭeśvara, Sudheśvara (Siddheśvara?), Lord Kedāra as well as Añjaneya ¯ (i.e. Hanumat), the Lord of the Gate (Dvāreśvara) . . .</p>
<p>53 People who, by taking a bath . . . , have removed their sins, they shall, by breaking their fetters, attain to freedom in the House of Lustre (i.e. the World of Brahmā) and what is beyond that.</p>
<p>55 The guru of the gods is not able to tell the wonderful efficacy of . . . (Gaṅgā srotas?), 35 who else could do it?</p>
<p>56 . . . (in the tīrtha) called the illustrious Saṅkha(tīrtha) . . . , whose lotusfeet ´ are worshipped by the inhabitants of the three worlds.</p>
<p>57 After having taken a bath in the illustrious (Saṅkhatīrtha?) . . . , he shall ´ be without fear and abide in the proximity of Saṅkhapān ´ . in (i.e. Viṣṇu). 58 . . . that splendid power that is manifest in the Agnitīrtha . . .</p>
<p>60 A man who has taken a bath in the Ambatīrtha and has worshipped the Spouse of Ambikā, he shall be the unique recipient of pleasures in the abode of Ambikānātha.</p>
<p>61 After having proceeded to the Varuṇatīrtha . . . , (he shall reach) the Refuge of (Hari) . . . , whose feet are venerated by the Guardians of the World, Varuṇa and others.</p>
<p>35 Cf. SM 5.4.</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 107</p>
<p>62 The merit that accrues to (those) excellent men who are eager to perform their ablutions in the Suklatīrtha, that merit is not (even) obtained by ´ means of many great sacrifices like the Aśvamedha, nor by severe ascetic practices.</p>
<p>63 When a man has reached the tīrtha of Narasiṁha and his brilliant image— in one way or the other, thanks to his eminent merit—which desirable thing is there in the three worlds that is not within his reach, though it is difficult to obtain by others?</p>
<p>64 A man who has bathed also in the excellent eighth tīrtha called Kurukṣetra shall reach heaven, since he is purified as a result of his wiping off of (his) sins, such as the killing of a brahmin.</p>
<p>65 Not even the accomplished guru of the gods is able to expound the wonderful efficacy of the well-known ‘Five Tīrthas’, here on this most prominent and world-famous mountain.</p>
<p>66 Among these (five) the Lakṣmītīrtha stands out; those who are subject to life-long excessive suffering, such as poverty, caused by the ripening of their sins, for them prosperity (Lakṣmī) will quickly and easily be obtainable when they take a bath here.</p>
<p>67 And could one expound the wonderful efficacy of the Haṁsatīrtha, that bright store of abundant purity, so much so, that even the goose that abides in the heart (i.e. the soul) becomes purified by drinking its water?</p>
<p>68 Would there be a man who possesses enough power to explain the greatness of the illustrious Cakratīrtha, whose equal there is not on earth, and for whose protection Lord Hari employed his own discus, called Sudarśana?</p>
<p>69 A man who has taken a bath in the water of the Dhanustīrtha and who has offered a bow made of gold, or of other material depending on his means, his pile of sins will be destroyed and he will go to the abode of the illustrious Sārṅgapān ´ . in (the Bearer of the Bow, i.e. Viṣṇu).</p>
<p>70 The man who takes a bath in the tīrtha of the ancestors, named Pitr̥tīrtha, and who offers oblations to his ancestors, after this disciplined man has (thus) purified a million of his ancestors, he will himself go to the heavenly abode of the ancestors.</p>
<p>71 That man shall quickly obtain healthy sons who takes a bath, together with his wife, in the Vājimedhatīrtha, which lies to the west of the mountain and which is a match for all tīrthas taken together.</p>
<p>72 The river that by its lotus-hands, viz. its waves, protects the dharma against the forces of the Kali Age, that river, running in the vicinity of this (moun tain) and appositely known as Kalipā, is able to take away the faults of the Kali Age.</p>
<p>73 And in the neighbourhood of this mountain runs also that (river) Suranadī, which is frequented by a great number of gods and which grants to men who perform the bathing rites, beginning with sipping its water, even if</p>
<p>they perform them only once, abundant enjoyments in the House of the Gods.</p>
<p>74 Gods, sages and men do not value the confluence of the waters of the Ganges and the Arkajā (i.e. Yamunā) higher than they do the confluence of the waters of the Kalipā and Suranadī rivers.</p>
<p>75 It is no wonder that, after having reached the Maṇikālakuṇḍa, a mortal attains all accomplishments (siddhi) in this most excellent tīrtha; and then, owing to its grace, final release itself is not far away either.</p>
<p>76 (And) though release is difficult to obtain, it comes within reach of the living at the very moment that he reaches the Mokṣakuṇḍa to the south of the mountain.</p>
<p>77 The Enemy of the Ten-necked (Rāvaṇa) (i.e. Rāma) grants a mass of merit to come forth as the reward of bathing in the illustrious Rāmatīrtha that lies here (on this mountain), a tīrtha of which the wonderful efficacy is famous for making the final goal come into view.</p>
<p>78 Those who are dedicated to stay in this holy place of the Enemy of the Ten-necked (Rāvaṇa) for goodness’ sake on an Ekādaśī day, to them release becomes humble and, captured in the cage of their hands, will serve them like a domesticated maina-bird.</p>
<p>79 When a man takes a bath in the illustrious Rāmatīrtha in the month of Kārttika and, filled with devotion, pays his respect to the Enemy of the Ten-necked (Rāvaṇa), then his soul shall not become (that of) a maggot, if he returns into an earthly frame.</p>
<p>80 If one performs on this mountain only once a śrāddha-sacrifice, a Rāma’s Gayā (as it were), then one’s ancestors will obtain the release which is extremely difficult to attain.</p>
<p>81 In the vicinity of the illustrious (holy place) of Rāmacandra is the Sindūra pond which is a reservoir of virtue; by its purifying sight one conquers heaven and attains to release.</p>
<p>82 And how could one describe the Karpūra pond in the proximity of the God who is Sītā’s beloved, which brims over with a flood of favours? For, even release acts as its servant.</p>
<p>83 The accumulation of merit that accrues from staying one day on the Sindūra mountain, which surpasses all other (mountains) because of its being touched by the lotus-feet of the illustrious Rāma, that (same amount of merit) is not even obtained by people who stay all their life in, be it Kāśī, or Ujjayinī, or Mathurā, or Dvārakā, or Purī.</p>
<p>84 Out of desire for Rāma the Elephant-faced (Gaṇeśa) abides here in person, whose pair of frontal globes, when thought of, brings worldly blessings.</p>
<p>85 And here on this mountain of Rāma also abides the Lord of the Dharma (Dharmeśvara) who, as a vehicle of compassion, protects the Dharma in jured by Kali.</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 109</p>
<p>86 Here the śūdra saint Sambuka has reached the abode of Murāri (i.e. ´ Kr̥ṣṇa/Viṣṇu) after having been killed by the sword Candrahāsa, which was wielded by Rāmacandra; and on this eminent mountain he became well-known as Dhūmrākṣa.</p>
<p>87 Those who go and see the Lord of Sivā, ´ Siva, known on this mountain ´ under the name of Muktīśvara, on a day sacred to Siva, while keeping a ´ vow dedicated to Siva, will attain to ´ Siva-hood in ´ Siva’s abode. ´</p>
<p>88 Yonder God whose unique form comprises the world lives here on this king of mountains, the one who in His form of Gopāla is the full moon in the ocean of bliss of the gopī folk and whose shining lotus eyes are wide open.</p>
<p>89 The illustrious Narasiṁha also lives on that (same mountain), who is the fourth descent of the Unshakable one (i.e. Viṣṇu), who out of compassion has fully protected the world, when it was harassed exceedingly by a torrent of heat.</p>
<p>90 And here, in the residence of the Enemy of the Ten-necked (Rāvaṇa), lives lord Adikola (i.e. Varāha) at the end of the Kalpa, the one who, while ¯ carrying on his tusk the earth which had deeply sunken into the flood of the seven oceans, appeared as a leaf in a lotus pond as it were, when he brought it up by his tooth, and whose praises were sung by the divine seers, whose excitement resided within their hairs (i.e. whose hair stood on end due to exhilaration).</p>
<p>91 The illustrious monarch Paṅktiratha (i.e. Daśaratha) has also come to live on the top of this mountain, out of love for his son, after he had forever resigned the unequalled and unique homage payed to him by the great Indra.</p>
<p>92 Here on this mountain the two rulers of the world Kuśa and Lava, sons of the illustrious Rāmacandra, act as a tree of plenty for those who are steeped in devotion.</p>
<p>93 Here reside the Eight Mothers, who are distinguished by the name Mahāsiddhi, and who bestow upon their devotees the eight occult powers, viz. that of becoming as small as an atom, etc.</p>
<p>94 And what about Lord Mahābhairava, the Place of Sport of Kālikā, whose black, gaping mouth is like a large burning net which swallows the entire universe at the end of time, and who, when he came to see the Sindūra mountain out of desire for Rāma, immediately lost his inclination to live anywhere else?</p>
<p>95 He who is Rāma’s unswerving servant, the Son of the Wind, lives here. A man who visualizes him in his heart-lotus, as possessed of five mouths, moon-crested, with ten arms, blazing terribly like a million rising suns, as having three eyes, in his hands a hatchet(?) . . . , a sword, a boon (?), an arrow, a bow, a spear, and a skull-staff, and showing the abhaya and varada handgestures to his devotees, this man gains full control over the powers in the universe.</p>
<p>96 The powerful lord who carries on his heads this world as if it were a gar land made of flowers, Hari’s companion during his descent as the illustrious Rāma, the conch/serpent (śaṅkha), though without conch/serpent nature (aśaṅkhātmaka), resides here, in the proximity of the spouse of Janaka’s daughter, as Lakṣmaṇa, who fulfils whatever desire is cherished by any of his devotees.</p>
<p>97 She is also present here in Rāma’s proximity, she by remembering whose Name the whole mountain of sins is totally destroyed, this Goddess, single river of compassion, who is a guide on the path of all women who remain faithful to their husbands, and who reduced the king of Laṇkā to ashes by a curse: ‘my husband shall effect his destruction’.</p>
<p>98 A man who has seen the images of the Enemy of the Ten-necked (Rāvaṇa) . . . here on this mountain, into him . . . of the terrifying image of the destruc tion of the world will no longer strike fear.</p>
<p>99 When a man full of ardent devotion comes and sees Lord Adirāma, whose ¯ image (body) is a garden of happiness to the world, then he shall forever attain to the state of being the principal recipient of veneration offered by the hands of the Lord of the Gods and the others.</p>
<p>100 If one sees the illustrious Bhogarāma, whose image (body) is beautiful, the whole range of sins is destroyed in Murāri’s (Kr̥ṣṇa’s) refuge; and directly one shall taste all kinds of undiminishing enjoyments for a hundred world periods, dwarfing the king of the gods.</p>
<p>101 When one, filled with inexhaustible devotion, has seen Guptarāma here, who is of superior greatness and whose abode is very secret, one gets what ever (one desires)—nay, (one becomes like) the king of the gods or even Aṅgirasa (Br ¯ .haspati), who is their guru . . .</p>
<p>102 A mortal who prostrates before the illustrious Saṅkharāma reaches, indeed, ´ the abode of Saṅkhapān ´ . in (the Bearer of the Conch, i.e. Viṣṇu) where he, being in a state of inner purity, will be respectfully welcomed by the great Indra followed by (the other) gods.</p>
<p>103 Bowing my head to the Lord who is the source of great happiness for the world, the illustrious god Rāma, who is accompanied by the illustrious princess of Mithilā and god Lakṣmaṇa, I shall sing his praise in modest words:</p>
<p>l04 ‘O God, illustrious Raghunandana, Lord who proclaims the oneness of the three worlds, you who, like a great jewel, adorn your splendid dynasty, mine of compassion, obeisance to you whose hand chops off in play the ten heads of the ten-faced Enemy of the Universe (i.e. Rāvaṇa), obeisance to you, O guardian of the universe . . . ’</p>
<p>105 ‘O God, obeisance to you whose glory of having churned the clotted waves of the milk-ocean (stirs) the heart, to you who are the unique support of all . . . , obeisance to you, illustrious Rāma, who lends lustre to a multitude</p>
<p>5 / The Ramtek Inscriptions I 111</p>
<p>of lotus-like faces such as those of Hanumat and others, to you who are the sole root of bliss for the illustrious daughter of King Janaka.’</p>
<p>106 ‘O God, we pay homage to you . . . , whose anger was calmed by the flow of sweet words of . . . (his) wife . . . , whose lotus-feet radiate with the lustre of a heap of jewels . . . ’</p>
<p>112 The mortal who praises Rāmadeva residing on top of the Sindūra mountain with a pure mind, to him grants . . .</p>
<p>116 When a man has devotedly worshipped . . . and his mind is purified, what difficult-to-obtain (occult) power will there be that he will not obtain?</p>
