Preamble 

In his Untersuchungen zum Mokṣadharma (Die sāṁkhyistischen Texte) and in the chapter on Sāṁkhya of his Geschichte der indischen Philosophie Erich Frauwallner has shown chapters MBh 12.187 and MBh 12.239–241 of the Mokṣadharma in the Sāntiparvan ´ of the Mahābhārata to be of crucial importance for understanding the development of the Sāṁkhya-system. 1 The great Viennese scholar dealt with yet another chapter (MBhB 12.286), which however has been omitted in the critical edition, but is preserved in the critical apparatus to MBh 12.187. Conceived as different versions of one and the same ‘Grundtext’, they must, Frauwallner argued, have been held to be of great significance at the time and probably led an independent existence before they were included in the collection of doctrines of the Mokṣadharma. Frauwallner attempted a reconstruction of this ‘Grundtext’ by sorting out words and passages that were judged by him not to have belonged to this text originally. He succeeded in giving a clear description of a distinctive philosophy, which he denominated ‘die epische Urform des Sāṁkhya’. 2 An important conclusion of his reconstruction is that the so called ‘evolution theory’ had not yet been developed; according to Frauwallner the evolution theory was adopted by the Sāṁkhya later from circles that taught an evolution out of Brahman. 3 

Van Buitenen (1956) also stressed the importance of these texts, but con trary to Frauwallner’s conclusions, he maintained that an evolution theory can be traced in them. Out of both texts he reconstructed a small tract, which

3 Two texts according to Frauwallner have been a major influence upon the development of the evolution theory: MBh 12.224 and the first book of the Manusmr̥ti (Frauwallner 1925a). Cf. Hacker 1961b and Rüping 1977.

somehow had come to be included in this text-group. He recovered this tract by isolating and arranging those verses in which the term bhāva has apparently an other meaning than it has in the rest of the texts. 4 He emphasized the evolution process taught in this tract, which, as he put it, has a ‘horizontal pattern’ in contrast to a ‘vertical pattern’: ‘Not buddhi into manas, manas into senses etc., but buddhi into manas, buddhi into senses’. 5 Bakker (1982) ac cepted van Buitenen’s reconstruction as a ‘working-hypothesis’, but criticized the interpretations of some passages; moreover he questioned van Buitenen’s claim to have discovered an authentic text. He drew attention to an agreement of the reconstructed tract with the teachings of Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3. 6 

Three themes 

From all these different interpretations we may infer that the chapters under discussion contain a diversity of ideas, which are not necessarily consistent with each other. In this paper we want to look at three themes central to both texts that are relevant to the question put forward by van Buitenen, viz. whether or not we encounter an evolution theory in these chapters. It will be shown that this question is related to a difference between both texts with respect to their conception of buddhi. The three themes are the following: 7 

1 A teaching about the five elements and their respective differentiation into sense-organ, sense-faculty and sense-impression. 8 

4 Van Buitenen 1956, 153: 

When we read through the two versions we are struck by the fact that the term bhāva occurs in two altogether different situations: first in connection with such ‘sensations, qualities and conditions’ as sukha/prīti, duḥkha/śoka, moha, praharṣa etc., atuṣṭi etc., aviveka etc.; secondly in connection with a process by which the buddhi modifies itself into manas as its bhāva. 

5 Van Buitenen 1957a, 22. 

6 Bakker 1982b, 144: 

[. . . ] The most striking agreement of the epic with the Upaniṣad appears from the fact that the act of consciousness itself, when it has actualized the senses, evolves the objects (epic: artha /Kaus.U.: bhūtamātra) of the latter. Or rather, at the very moment buddhi (or prajñā) actualizes the senses it evolves (epic: vikurute /Kaus.U.: abhivisr̥jate) the object that is apprehended. 

7 In addition to these three, there may be distinguished three more themes (in both texts): an introductory question concerning the self (adhyātman) which forms the beginning of both texts (MBh 12.187.1–3; 239.1–2), a teaching about the three bhāvās (‘states of mind’) sattva, rajas and tamas (MBh 12.187.14, 21–35; 239.16, 20–25; 240.6cd–8, 10– 11) and a soteriology (MBh 12.187.44–47, 51–60; 240.13–15; 241.5–14). Many of these themes, or parts of them, have parallels in other chapters of the Mokṣadharma; so, for example, part of the teaching about the three bhāvās is found also in MBh 12.212.25–31. Study of these parallels may throw light on the composition and transmission of the Mokṣadharma, as, mutatis mutandis, the Nārāyaṇīya-Studien by Peter Schreiner and others (1997) has demonstrated.

2 A teaching about the intellect (buddhi) and its relation to the ‘knower of the field’ (kṣetrajña), the mind (manas) and the senses (indriyāṇi). 9 

3 A teaching about the relationship between the sattva and the kṣetrajña.10 

The five elements 

The first theme forms a coherent whole, which can be distinguished quite easily from the rest of the texts. The five elements are regarded as the (material) cause of all sentient beings. They evolve into three modifications (guṇa): a sense organ, a sense-faculty and a sense-impressioṇSo, for instance, the element ākāśa evolves into the ears, hearing and sound. 11 The characteristic feature of this treatment of the elements is the epistemological point of view, which entails that the essential qualities of the elements are characterized by their impression on the senses. 12 

In addition to the five elements as the material cause, this section speaks of the bhūtakr̥t (‘creator of beings’) as a kind of efficient cause (Appendix: A). 13 The bhūtakr̥t appears to cause the differentiation of the elements into the triple modification of sense-organ, sense-faculty and sense-impression (MBh 187.7; MBh 239.6–7). The conclusion seems justified that in this section of both texts a consistent doctrine is presented, which considers the elements to be the material out of which sentient beings (bhūta) are made, a process set in motion by a bhūtakr̥t. This section forms a teaching of its own; this is evident also from the fact that none of the words playing a key role in the rest of the texts, such as kṣetrajña, buddhi, manas, bhāva and sattva, are used here. 

The intellectual apparatus 

The transition to the next theme can be illustrated by MBh 187.10cd–11ab (Appendix: B). Whereas 10cd enumerates the five elements with the manas as sixth, the following verse 11ab enumerates the five senses and the manas; the buddhi and the kṣetrajña being respectively the seventh and the eighth (11cd). 14 These verses indicate a transition in both texts: nothing is said about the elements any more, the senses are given and the teaching about

10 MBh 12.187.37–43, 48–50; 240.19–22; 241.1–4. 

11 MBh 12.187.8ab: śabdaḥśrotraṁtathā khāni trayam ākāśayonijam | 

12 This epistemological perspective remains in classical Sāṁkhya, where the five elements are considered to originate from the so called ‘subtle elements’ (tanmātra). These tanmātrās, in fact, are the sense-impressions: śabda, sparśa, rūpa, rasa and gandha. 

13 The Appendix contains the text of some passages of the critical editioṇIt is meant to facilitate comparison: the left column contains a passage of MBh 12.187, the right column contains the parallel of MBh 12.239–241 and vice versa. A blank means there is no parallel for a passage. 

14 That we are here concerned with a break is also evident from the parallel passage which omits 187.11ab, and instead of mahābhūtāni pañcaiva (MBh 187.10c) reads indriyāṇi nare pañca (MBh 239.14a). 





226 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

their origin out of the elements seems to be forgotteṇWhereas up to this point we had a description of material nature, after it both texts seem to be dealing with ideal nature only. Although the following teaching about the buddhi does not form such a clear section as the foregoing teaching about the elements, the verses which we consider to belong to this teaching all have one thing in common: they deal with a psychic or ideal principle distinct from the (material) elements. 

The teaching starts with an enumeration of eight principles: the five senses, the manas, the buddhi and the kṣetrajña. Their respective functions are given: 

The eye is for seeing, the mind causes reflection, the intellect serves determination, the knower of the field is called the onlooker. 15 

While both texts agree on these functions they disagree about the relationship between the buddhi and the kṣetrajña. This disagreement can be deduced from a small, but important variation in the parallel passages 187.20 and 240.6 (Appendix: C). According to both passages the ‘invisible one’ governs the senses, but whereas 187.20 uses the masculine adr̥śyaḥ, 240.6 uses the feminine adr̥śyā.16 Therefore in 187.20 the term ‘invisible one’ refers to the kṣetrajña, whereas in 240.6 it refers to the buddhi. In the parallel passages 187.13 and 239.18 (Appendix: D) there is a similar variatioṇBoth verses deal with the question: who is the one that sees everything that is above the soles of the feet and inhabits all this? 187.13 seems to teach that it is the kṣetrajña, as in the preceding verse the kṣetrajña is called the onlooker. 239.18 however explicitly states it is the buddhir uttamā (‘supreme intellect’). These variations indicate a difference with respect to the relationship between the buddhi and the kṣetrajña. Whereas according to 187 the buddhi and the kṣetrajña are utterly distinct, in that the one is the active knowledge-principle responsible for the activity of the senses and the other an absolute, non-active onlooker or subject, in some parts of 239–241 the buddhi and the kṣetrajña seem to be two sides of one and the same principle. 

The difference between the two texts can be illustrated by comparing those verses that explain the relation of the buddhi to the senses (appendix: E). In 187.18–19 the senses are characterized as instruments which the buddhi employs for apperception: 

The eye is what it sees with, what it hears with is called the ear, the nose they say is what it smells with, with the tongue it experiences flavour and with the skin it feels touches. 

In the parallel passage of 240.4–5, however, it is not the instrumental case (yena paśyati) that is used, but the active present participle together with the finite verb bhavati: 

15 MBh 12.239.15: cakṣur ālocanāyaiva saṁśayaṁkurute manaḥ| buddhir adhyavasānāya sākṣī kṣetrajña ucyate k 

16 Some manuscripts of 240.6 also read adr̥śyah.. No manuscript of 187.20 reads adr̥śyā. 







11 / Mokṣadharma 187 and 239–241 Reconsidered 227 

While hearing it becomes hearing, while touching it is called touch, while seeing it becomes sight, while tasting it becomes taste, while smelling it becomes smell. 

The buddhi does not employ the senses as instruments, but it is or becomes itself the senses. The word indriyāṇi used in both text passages (187.20; 240.6) does not seem to have exactly the same meaning: in 240 it denotes the sense faculties, whereas in 187 its connotation seems to encompass the sense-organs as well. 17 In 240 a sense is not so much an instrument, as a modification of the buddhi, viz. a state of mind characterized by sense-perceptioṇIn this way it is said that the buddhi evolves the complex of the senses, just as a tortoise sticks out its limbs (239.17). 

However, despite this occasional ambiguity, the verses in this section do not deal with material nature, but with ideal nature. The buddhi is therefore not looked upon as a material entity as it is in classical Sāṁkhya. In this connection some remarks have to be made on Frauwallner’s observation—in the introduction to his translation of the reconstructed ‘Grundtext’, published in his Nachgelassene Werke II—to the effect that the buddhi in this text-group is ranked among material nature. 

Besondere Bedeutung kommt in ihm [viz. the ‘Grundtext’] der Psychologie zu. Weltseele und Materie sind nämlich nach ihm scharf getrennt. Dabei werden nicht nur die Sinnesorgane, sondern auch die psychischen Organe, Denken (manah.) und Erkennen (buddhih.) der Materie zugerechnet. 18 

In our opinion this is certainly not true for some passages in adhyāya 240. This becomes evident when we consider MBh 240.3 (Appendix: F). After the progressive enumeration of the indriyāṇi, the arthās, the manas, the buddhi and the ātman, which we also encounter with some variations in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad,19 it is said that: 

The intellect is the self of man; the intellect indeed is the essence of the self; when it produces a bhāva it is / becomes mind. 20 

17 In classical Sāṁkhya the indriyāṇi as faculties are explicitly distinguished from the organs, which are called their ‘seats’ (adhiṣṭhānāni)—e.g. in the Yuktidīpikā (YD ad SK 26cd, p. 197): 

ucyate: adhiṣṭhānād indriyapr̥thaktvaṁśaktiviśeṣopalambhāt | yathā śarīrāsambha vino viṣayavyavasāyalakṣaṇasya śaktiviśeṣasyopalambhād arthāntaraṁbuddhir anu mīyata evam adhiṣṭhānāsambhavino viṣayagrahaṇalakṣaṇasya śaktiviśeṣasyopala mbhād arthāntaram indriyam iti | The use of the term in these texts of the Mokṣadharma, however, is ambiguous. Thus in MBh 12.239.11cd the ‘complex of the senses’ (indriyagrāma) is described as ‘derived from the five elements’ (pañcabhautika), thereby implying its material nature, whereas MBh 187.20 seems to conflate the adhiṣṭhānāni and the indriyāṇi.

228 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

The buddhi is regarded as the essence of the self in this verse. In the preceding verse however the self is stated to be higher than the buddhi. Consequently the buddhi seems to exist in two ways: 1) as an absolute, non-intentional self, corresponding to the kṣetrajña; 2) as an empirical, intentional activity, when it evolves through the manas into the senses. In the latter case the buddhi exists as a bhāva, i.e. in a ‘state of modification’. It is obvious that this doc trine differs materially from the one found in MBh 187, where the buddhi is treated as an hypostasis of empirical intellect, fundamentally distinct from the transcendental subject, kṣetrajña, as well as separated from the senses. 21 

Sattva and kṣetrajña 

The difference between the two texts can be illustrated further by comparing the passages that deal with the relationship between sattva and kṣetrajña (Ap pendix: G). If we understand sattva here, not as referring to a material principle comparable to the prakr̥ti, but as referring to the buddhi,22 a remarkable agree ment with the foregoing appears. According to both texts the sattva creates (sr̥jate) the guṇās, whereas the kṣetrajña is only their observer. The guṇās are to be interpreted here as the modifications of the buddhi, just as in the teaching about the elements the word guṇa denotes the modification of the elements. The difference between the two texts lies in the relationship of kṣetrajña and sattva to the self (ātman). For, whereas 187.40cd states that the self is the one who observes the guṇās (i.e. is the kṣetrajña) but wrongly thinks himself to be their creator, according to the parallel passage 240.19ab the self in reality (yathātatham) is both, the observer (paridraṣṭr.) and the creator (sraṣṭr.) of the 

21 This difference may also explain the parallel verses 187.23 and 240.8. According to 187.23 the essence of the buddhi consists of the three bhāvās (viz. sattva, rajas and tamas) and it never transcends them; according to 240.8 however it does transcend the three bhāvās, although its essence is said to consist in them (bhāvātmikā). In both chapters the passage at issue has variant readings—some manuscripts of 187.23 read ativartate instead of nātivartate, while some manuscripts of 240.8 read nātivartate instead of ativartate—yet this variance may be significant and point to an original difference of doctrine rather than being due to mere textual corruptioṇIn 187.23 the buddhi does not transcend the three bhāvās, because only the ‘invisible one’, viz. the kṣetrajña, transcends them. In 240.8 the buddhi does transcend them, since it is equated to the absolute self and as such is the transcendental ‘invisible one’. 

22 Frauwallner (1992) translates sattva in this part of the texts with ‘die Güte’; Edgerton (1965) translates it with ‘essential (material) reality’. Van Buitenen (1957b, 95) distin guishes five meanings of the word sattva in the context of proto-Sāṁkhya: ‘1. sattva as the material counterpart of the kṣetrajña; 2. as the buddhi; 3. as a bhāva of the buddhi; 4. as a state of well-being amounting to release; 5. as the first of the three guṇās’. Although van Buitenen takes sattva here in the first meaning, he observes that there is no real difference between the first and the second meaning: ‘In these early forms of Sāṁkhya creation does not necessarily start from a higher principle than the buddhi, e.g., avyakta, pradhāna or prakr̥ti, but from the buddhi itself; nor has the ahaṁkāra yet taken over the evolutionary functions of the buddhi. As the buddhisattva is indeed creation and thus the ‘material’ counterpart of the unaffected kṣetrajña’ (1957b, 96–97). Cf. also Johnston 1937, 50–51. 







11 / Mokṣadharma 187 and 239–241 Reconsidered 229 

guṇās. The doctrine underlying MBh 240 therefore seems to be that kṣetrajña and sattva are two aspects of one and the same principle, viz. the buddhi, which is defined as the Self of man (MBh 240.3ab). If our analysis of these chapters is correct, it may explain a statement in the Anugītā. 

Some wise men who are well established in knowledge declare the identity of the kṣetrajña and the sattva, this is not correct. 23 

This verse may be taken to refer to those passages of 239–241 that teach the unity of the kṣetrajña and the sattva within the self. This unity appears as two aspects (dialectical moments) of the buddhi: on the one hand as the tran scendental subject, styled ‘kṣetrajña’, on the other hand as the phenomenality (intentionality) of consciousness, styled ‘sattva’ (‘being’), that is intellect (bu ddhi) as activity, which comprises manas, the senses and their objects. 

The ‘evolution theory’ 

We now return to the ‘evolution theory’ that van Buitenen found in his recon structed tract. The verses van Buitenen used for his tract are those that deal with the modification of the buddhi. However, he mixes passages from 187 and 239–241, thereby blurring the difference between them. Frauwallner also con flates the texts, selecting material from all three dialogues and blending them into one ‘Grundtext’. The unacceptable consequences of this conflation can be seen when we look at the important difference between the buddhi using the sense-organs in 187 and the buddhi becoming the sense-faculties in 240, which difference is obliterated in the verses 18–19 of his ‘Grundtext’. 

Wodurch es sieht, das ist das Auge. H¨orend wird es Geh¨or genannt. Riechend wird es zum Geruch. Schmeckend ist es der Geschmack. Mit der Haut berührt es die Berührung. Vielfach wandelt sich das ErkenneṇWenn es etwas begehrt, dann wird es zum Denken. 24 

However, Frauwallner was right in his observation that the evolution theory of the Sāṁkhya is not attested in this text-group. Frauwallner has given three features of the evolution theory: 

Die Vorstellung der Urmaterie (prakr̥ti), die Lehre von den drei Eigenschaften (guṇās) der Urmaterie und die Lehre von den 25 Wesenheiten. 25 

23 MBh 14.48.9: āhur eke ca vidvāṁso ye jñāne supratiṣṭhitāḥ| kṣetrajñasattvayor aikyam ity etan nopapadyate k 

24 Frauwallner 1992, 82–83. Frauwallner’s eclectic translation finds some support in MBhB 12.286.19–20, since this text also seems to be a mixture of both theories (cf. Frauwallner 1992, 82, n. 34–36): 

yena paśyati tac cakṣuḥśr̥ṇvatī śrotram ucyate | 

jighratī bhavati ghrāṇaṁrasatī rasanā rasān k 19 k 

sparśanaṁsparśatī sparśān buddhir vikriyate ’sakr̥t | 

yadā prārthayate kiṁcit tadā bhavati sā manaḥk 20 k 

25 Frauwallner 1953, 300. 







230 Hans ṬBakker & Peter C. Bisschop 

We find none of them in these texts. What van Buitenen has styled a ‘horizontal evolution theory’ is different from what Frauwallner called an ‘evolution theory’. We would prefer to call the former a ‘teaching about the modification of the buddhi’. This teaching does not have a cosmological but a psychological status: it explains how the buddhi evolves the manas as its bhāva and subsequently dif ferentiates into the sense-faculties. The ontological implications of this teaching conflict with the teaching about the elements in the first part of both texts, where it is said that not only the sense-organs and the sense-impressions, but also the sense-faculties have their origin in the elements. These texts therefore do not contain a consistent philosophy, but display the same diversity as so much of the Mokṣadharma. 

The Mokṣadharma: a plurality of views 

The above analysis raises a number of questions, which—though, admittedly, they cannot all be answered—need to be addressed, if any progress into the early history of the Sāṁkhya philosophical tradition is to be made. These questions are closely connected with the source material from which we have to reconstruct that history; in this particular case: how do we conceive of the coming into being of the Mahābhārata text corpus, especially its largest book, the Sāntiparvan ´ . Frauwallner’s hypothesis of one ‘Grundtext’ that had been transmitted independently for a long time, had consequently developed into three different recensions, before the latter were included in the text of the Mokṣadharma by one or more redactors, only to be further mutilated in the course of transmission, that hypothesis proves untenable. As we have shown there are clearly different views underlying the dialogues of Yudhiṣṭhira and Bhīṣma (adhyāya 187) on the one hand, and that of Suka and Vyāsa ( ´ adhyāyas 239–241) on the other. An irreconcilable discrepancy had also been van Bui tenen’s starting point, but to explain it this scholar applied basically the same method as Frauwallner, though in more textual detail, when he constructed a new, smaller text out of both dialogues: ‘simply a text legitimately restored on the basis of two incomplete and corrupt versions’. 26 

However, instead of postulating or ‘restoring’ a ‘Grundtext’, we may make another assumption, namely that the redactor(s) of the Mokṣadharma was acquainted with various guru-traditions (see below, p. 511), which he aimed to represent in different dialogues. These philosophical lineages may have been closely related, enough to employ the same jargon, including technical terms, expressions, metaphors and even verses; but within them different techniques to obtain inner tranquillity (yoga) may have developed, and accordingly different views to account for these experiences. 

26 Van Buitenen 1956, 156. 





11 / Mokṣadharma 187 and 239–241 Reconsidered 231 

A scenario opposite to the one proposed by Frauwallner may be envisaged: in the course of composition, redaction, transmission, further revision, and fix ation of the Mokṣadharma a tendency may have been at work to straighten out contradicting views. If this were the case, the starting point may not have been one ‘Grundtext’ that degenerated into various distorted representations, but rather a plurality of theories and views that found textual expression and was amalgamated in a parvan or sub-parvan, which became gradually more homogeneous in a process of composition-in-transmission (cf. above, p. 177). This process may have been concomitant with the rise of the classical school of Sāṁkhya. In other words, rather than for an underlying unity we should search for diversity behind the apparent homogeneity. Paradoxically, greater philosophical homogeneity may have been accomplished at the cost of more tex tual inconsistencies. This genetic model would imply that, though the Mokṣa dharma as we have it offers already a bewildering diversity of often contradict ing views, the historical reality at the time of its first composition was still more complex—each ashram, so to speak, having its own competing version of proto-Sāṁkhya philosophy and being keen on having it canonized in the Smr̥ti. 

An original plurality may not only account for the essential differences be tween both dialogues, but also for unsolved philosophical problems within each. How does the theory of the five mahābhūtas and their differentiation within sen sitive beings concord with the psychological or ideal world treated in the rest of both dialogues? We are here apparently concerned with a cosmological theory in which God, the bhūtakr̥t mentioned in 187.7 and 239.6, plays a key role. 27 This same theory is found in other chapters of the Mokṣadharma, which by Frauwallner are not styled ‘epische Urform des Sāṁkhya’. 

This brings us to our final point. What justification, if any, is there to annex the two dialogues at issue to the Sāṁkhya tradition and not, for instance, the dialogue between Manu and Br̥haspati? If the hallmark of Sāṁkhya is a rift between the material and ideal world, all three dialogues may be said to belong to the same multifarious stream from which classical Sāṁkhya emerged.
