  <p>The literary evidence</p>
<p>Within the collection of hymns (Tirumolī) attributed to Viṭṭucittaṉ, also known as the ‘Great Saint’, Periyāḻvār (9th century ad), we find ‘a series of indepen dent songs, [in which] Periyāḻvār envisages the childhood of Kr̥ṣṇa through various games and ceremonies such as a real South Indian child would play and go through’ (Hardy 1983a, 406). Friedhelm Hardy, from whose Viraha–Bhakti I derive this information, styled this section the Bālacarita. It contains folk songs which, Hardy observes, afterwards came to form part of the genre styled piḷḷaitamiḻ, ‘songs accompanying the games etc. of children’ (Hardy ibid.), ‘de picting the child-life of a hero or god’ (Zvelebil 1974, 102). In one of the ten stages which constitute this genre, the mother, Yaśodā, calls the moon to play with the child Kr̥ṣṇa. 1 ‘Whence’, Hardy asks, ‘did Periyāḻvār derive the inspi ration for his Bālacarita?’ This scholar points to the Harivaṁśa (HV 60.15), in which, just as in one of the Aḻvār’s songs (III.5), Kr̥ṣṇa is said to eat a ‘lake of</p>
<p>curds’ with a ‘whirlpool of ghee’/‘marsh of ghee’, and Hardy concludes ‘that in the two common rūpakas we can safely assume direct literary dependence’. 2 How ‘safe’ is it, we may ask, to assume literary dependence on the basis of only two interconnected, and rather obvious metaphors (rūpaka): ‘a lake of curd’ and ‘a whirlpool/marsh of ghee’? Hardy continues,</p>
<p>Northern cultural values have deeply influenced and transformed the Southern awareness. Yet this is only one aspect of Viṭṭucittaṉ’s work. Much of Tamil culture has remained and in certain respects even developed further with him. [. . . ] The mythical events are seen through the eyes of the mythical actors, particularly Yaśodā, and their literary treatment stylizes them in such a way (by using genres of folk-songs) that a real mother can identify herself with these emotions, and can sing the songs, for example when playing with her child. Again, many of the themes depicted (like the ciṟrīl, the sand-houses) are typical of older Tamil poetry, just</p>

<p>as the connection of particular folk customs with mythical songs (which, we might say, are acted out in the custom), has been detected already in the Kalittokai and the Aycciyarkuravai ¯ . In language and idiom, Periyˆalvār comes closer to ordinary people than any other Aḻvār. It is a difficult problem to find an overall explanation for the clear Northern influence on the one hand, and the closeness of our brahmin priest to the ordinary people and his deep roots in Tamil culture on the other hand. I shall not attempt an answer here (Hardy 1983a, 411 f.).</p>
<p>I cannot try to solve this problem, first and foremost because I do not have access to the source material, Tamil literature. However, we may observe that the alleged influence from the North does not necessarily entail literary depen dence; the arguments adduced by Hardy for such dependence are rather flimsy and they are not corroborated by our investigation into the origin of one of the themes of the piḷḷaitamiḻ, baby Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the moon.</p>
<p>Baby Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the moon</p>
<p>As one might expect, the topic of Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the moon became connected with those currents in the bhakti movement that cultivated the emotions as sociated with motherhood, in emulation of Yaśodā, the vātsalyabhāva. These emotions were beautifully expressed in a poem ascribed to Sūrdās, and we may assume that by the 16th century this and similar songs were sung all over India. I present Sabhā 809 of the Sūrasāgara in the translation of Kenneth Bryant.</p>
<p>Again and again, Yaśodā coaxes:</p>
<p>‘Come, Moon! Moon, my little one’s calling you!</p>
<p>He’s going to eat honey and fruit and nuts and sweets,</p>
<p>and he might give you some too!</p>
<p>He ’ll play with you in his hand, and he won’t</p>
<p>even drop you once;</p>
<p>Just come down and live in this bowl of water</p>
<p>I ’ve got here in my hand . . . ’</p>
<p>She set the bowl upon the ground, and took him</p>
<p>and showed him the moon;</p>
<p>And Sūr’s Lord laughed and dipped his two hands</p>
<p>again and again and again. 3</p>
<p>If this topic originally hailed from the North, we could hope to find allusions to it in the early Sanskrit literature dealing with Kr̥ṣṇa’s childhood; the first text to investigate is indeed the Harivaṁśa. However, neither here nor in the</p>

<p>8 / Little Kr̥ṣṇa’s Play with the Moon 169</p>
<p>Viṣṇupurāṇa have I been able to find the topic. Bhāsa’s Bālacarita does not mention it either and even the Bhāgavatapurāṇa, which is certainly inspired by the South Indian tradition, does not seem to contain this theme.</p>
<p>A well-known collection of Sanskrit devotional verses in honour of Kr̥ṣṇa is the one ascribed to the poet Līlāśuka Bilvamaṅgala, the title of which in the South Indian mss is Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta. The identity of its author, who probably was a South Indian and who might have lived in the 14th century, is problem atic, 4 but an anthology named Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta was reportedly brought from South India to Bengal by Caitanya in c. ad 1510. 5 Neither in the South-Indian nor in the Bengali recension of this anthology do we find a verse dealing with the topic at issue. However, in addition to the Bengali one there exist other North-Indian anthologies that are attributed to Bilvamaṅgala. In Wilson’s critical edition they are represented by his mss Y. About these manuscripts Wilson remarks:</p>
<p>The Y version (Northern mss.) shows that the KK (Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta) collection reached West India and Madhyadeśa and was popular there from c. 1400–1700 ad. From a descriptive point of view the Y version is not a version of the KK: except for Y 50, the msṣof the Y version do not arrange the verses into centuries; no Y version is named Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta; finally, about one half the verses in any Y mṣare not found in the msṣnamed KK and about one half of the verses in the msṣnamed KK are not found in any Y ms. 6</p>
<p>Among the half that is not found in mss titled Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta is a verse that refers to our topic in a slightly varied form. It is preserved in a ms kept in the Chandra Shum Shere collection of the Bodleian Library (d 843), titled Srīgopālabālastuti ´ by Bilvamaṅgala, in an India Office ms (No. 564), titled Su maṅgalastotra by Bilvamaṅgala, with a commentary called Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta ṭīkā, in a ms used for a Bengali edition of 1817, 7 and in 4 mss used in the so-called Assamese version edited by ṀNeog; two of the latter mss are dated, namely ad 1803 and 1837, all other mss are undated. 8 Wilson presents this verse among his Additional Verses:</p>
<p>Kr̥ṣṇa who, seeing the moon reflected in the waters of a pot, dipped his fingers into it to taste, thinking it was fresh butter: bewildered he was, when he found none; may he protect us. 9</p>
<p>4 Wilson 1975, 16 ff.; Gonda 1977, 31.</p>
<p>5 Wilson 1975, 4.</p>
<p>6 Wilson 1975, 5.</p>
<p>7 Given in ṢK. De’s edition of the Kr̥ṣṇakarṇāmr̥ta.</p>
<p>8 See Wilson 1975, 439. The same author mentions (ibid. 315) a ms in the Scindia Oriental Institute (Ujjain) (No. 6523) as a source for this verse (his Y 31), which seems to take the place of the Oxford and London mss (his Y 13 and Y 33) that are mentioned as sources on p. 439.</p>
<p>9 Wilson 1975, p. 227:</p>
<p>ghaṭodakeṣu pratimāśaśāṅkaṁvilokya kr̥ṣṇo navanītabuddhyā |</p>
<p>ādātum antar nihitāgrahastaḥpāyāt tadaprāptisamākulo naḥk</p>
<p>It would seem that in this Sanskrit version the original character of the topic as reported in the Tamil tradition and preserved in Sūrdās’ poem, namely, that of a lullaby in which the moon is the object of Kr̥ṣṇa’s fancy, has been assimilated to the famous theme of Kr̥ṣṇa’s appetite for butter, for which he takes the moon’s reflection by mistake.</p>
<p>Wilson reports that around Ujjain Bilvamaṅgala is identified with Sūrdās, 10 and though this may be just a local tradition, it may indicate the affinity that was sensed between this Sanskrit anthology and the Sūrasāgara traditioṇBoth verses, the Sanskrit and the Braj, may have come into existence independently at about the same period, articulating the popularity of the topic in circles of Kr̥ṣṇa bhaktas of the fifteenth and sixteenth century.</p>
<p>With respect to the origin of the topic the verse ascribed to Bilvamaṅgala adds little to the testimony of the Sūrasāgara. We must conclude that our literary survey has not yielded any evidence that the topic of Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the moon was known in northern India before the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>The archaeological evidence</p>
<p>We could leave it at that were it not that Indian archaeology has its own story to tell. For that reason we go to a village called Paunar on the right bank of the River Dham, 70 km southwest of Nagpur in Maharashtra. It has several mounds testifying to a long-standing occupation of the site. Excavations were carried out in 1967 under the supervision of ṢB. Deo of the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology of the University of Nagpur. Among other things this excavation brought to light that Paunar enjoyed its days of prosperity during the Vākāṭaka period, i.e. 5th century ad, and consecutive period, the first quarter of the 6th century, when the Viṣṇukuṇḍins held sway over this area. 11</p>
<p>The major findings in Paunar, however, did not emerge from the excavation, but were recovered during the building of the Paramadhāma Aśrama of Vinoba ¯ Bhave on the left (northern) bank of the Dham. The sculptures and panels found ‘while digging in the fields round Srī Viṉobājī’s ´ āśrama’ are preserved in the Ashram. 12 They attest to the existence of several sanctuaries on the bank of the river, among which at least one large Viṣṇu temple. From the beginning, however, there has been controversy over their iconography and date. Mirashi, who was the first to give a systematic interpretation of the panels, thought they depict scenes of the Rāmāyaṇa.13 This view has proved to be untenable</p>

<p>and it is now generally believed that the majority of the panels (if not all) represent līlā scenes of Kr̥ṣṇa and his associates, for instance: ‘Kaṁsavadha’ (Plate 13), 14 and ‘Dhenukāsuravadha’ (Plate 14). 15</p>
<p>Plate 13 Plate 14</p>
<p>Paunar: Kaṁsavadha Paunar: Dhenukāsuravadha</p>
<p>Considerations of style would suggest that many of the findings preserved in the Ashram, including the panels, do not belong to the Vākāṭakas, but may date from a somewhat later period. Walter Spink ascribes them to ‘a period (c. ad 500) of Viṣṇukuṇḍin rule over Vidarbha’. 16 The Viṣṇukuṇḍins, whose homeland was the Guntur District (AP) and the region to the north of the Srīśaila Hills ´ (the present Mahbubnagar District AP), became, when their kingdom began to</p>
<p>14 The story covers Kr̥ṣṇa disposing of an elephant, named Kuvalayāpīḍa, Kr̥ṣṇa and Balarāma entering the arena and killing the wrestlers Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika, and finally Kr̥ṣṇa dragging Kaṁsa by holding his hair.</p>
<p>15 Balarāma hurling the ass-demon Dhenuka on to a palmyra tree, from which he falls down, his back broken and, dying, transmutes into his anthropomorphic demon form (Bakker 1997, 157 f.).</p>
<p>16 Spink 1981, 123 n. 8.</p>
<p>emerge at the end of the 4th century, heirs to the artistic tradition of Amarā vatī and Nāgārjunakoṇḍa (3rd century ad), the sculptural style of which may be characterized as ‘lithe and slender’. 17 It is this legacy that we may recognize in the slender, natural but sensuous figures of Paunar; it may account for the stylistic undercurrent that is responsible for the ‘South-Indian flavour’ that art-historians savour when they examine these sculptures.</p>
<p>Plate 15</p>
<p>Paunar: Little Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the moon</p>
<p>17 Huntington 1985, 180 observes:</p>
<p>The sculptural style at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa, like that at Amarāvatī, is known from the carved stone slabs that were part of the veneer of the major stūpas, as well as from free-standing images. By and large, the Nāgārjunakoṇḍa carvings are closely tied to the latest sculptures from Amarāvatī in style as well as range of subjects. If anything, the compositions of the reliefs are often more animated, the figures more lithe and slender, and the spatial arrangements more sophisticated. (italics mine)</p>
<p>8 / Little Kr̥ṣṇa’s Play with the Moon 173</p>
<p>One of the panels (Plate 15) was interpreted by Mirashi (1954, 4) as ‘the birth of Rāma. The prominent male figure is Daśaratha who has taken the baby in his hands and is looking affectionately at him’. Joanna Williams (1983, 229) surmises that it ‘may represent Vasudeva transporting the baby to Gokul’. Yet another identification has been proposed by Chandrashekhar Gupta, who describes the panel as follows.</p>
<p>The main figure standing in the centre facing right (head mutilated) is shown carrying a child. Two persons are standing on his either [sic] side and a female attendant is seated in the Garuḍakrama posture, holding an oval object in her hands in the lower right corner. One of the male figures is an attendant holding the staff of an umbrella and the other is some elderly person in the varadamudrā. The scene is described [by Mirashi] as Daśaratha receiving Rāma, brought to him by the female attendant, after the birth. The child does not appear to be a newly born one. On the other hand he looks like a 2-3 years old boy. It can be identified with the story of Kr̥ishṇa’s obstinacy for getting the mooṇThe oval object in the hands of the female attendant can be identified as a mirror or a pot filled with water to reflect the image of the moon to satisfy Kr̥ishṇa. (Gupta 1992, 146 f.)</p>
<p>Though I find it difficult to assess the precise age of the boy held by the main male figure, I think Gupta’s identification of the panel might be the correct one. At variance with Sūrdās’ description, the infant Kr̥ṣṇa in the Paunar relief is held by Nanda, while Yaśodā kneels in front of him to hold the mirror (apparently not a pot with water). The two male bystanders in the background could be inhabitants of Gokula, the one at his right holds what seems to be a staff, possibly of an umbrella. 18</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When we combine the Paunar evidence with the outcome of our literary survey, the panel thus seems to endorse the hypothesis that the topic of Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the moon originated in South India. The South-Indian Viṣṇukuṇḍins brought it with them when their influence spread over Maharashtra during the last phase of Vākāṭaka rule, when Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II was king of Vidarbha. In order to defend his kingdom against the Nalas of the Bastar region (MP), the latter king had summoned the assistence of what probably was his son-in-law, the Viṣṇukuṇḍin king Mādhavavarman II Janāśraya in the last decade of the fifth century. As I have argued in my The Vākāṭakas (Bakker 1997, 55–57), the Viṣṇukuṇḍins succeeded the Vākāṭakas after the collapse of the Vākāṭaka kingdom. Mādhavavarman II declared himself emperor (sārvabhauma) in his Khanapur Plates which were found in the Satara District of Maharashtra. 19</p>
<p>18 I do not see the varadamudrā of the figure to the left.</p>
<p>19 EI XXVII, 316 l. 3.</p>
<p>In the inscriptions of his descendents Mādhavavarman II’s kingdom is said to have adjoined the waters of the Revā, i.e. the Narmadā River. 20 In sum it may be observed that the materials that we have been able to survey all point to South India as the cradle, to use an apposite metaphor, of the topic of Kr̥ṣṇa’s play with the mooṇOf course it is very well possible that we have missed an early Sanskrit passage containing this topic. Moreover, further research is needed of the ancient Tamil tradition of folk songs or lullabies from which Periyāḻvār may have derived his inspiratioṇIf our interpretation of the Paunar pannel is correct, though, such a song must already have been around in the fifth century ad.</p>
