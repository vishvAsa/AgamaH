The first fruit of Minoru Hara’s life-task-project to clarify the early history of the Saiva religion appeared in the ´ Indo-Iranian Journal of 1958 under the title Nakulīśa–Pāśupata–Darśanam. This was followed by the submission of his dis sertation, Materials for the study of Pāśupata Saivism ´ , to the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies of Harvard University in 1966 (Hara 1967). Ever since, Hara has contributed to the research into the history of the Pāśupata religion by a continuous series of meticulous studies. 1 Thanks to these studies our knowledge of this enigmatic but fascinating branch of early Hinduism has significantly increased.

  <p>Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta A Pāśupata tradition in seventh-century</p>
<p>Dakṣiṇa Kosala∗</p>
<p>Studies in the Skandapurāṇa III</p>
<p>Haraya Namah ¯ .</p>
<p>The first fruit of Minoru Hara’s life-task-project to clarify the early history of the Saiva religion appeared in the ´ Indo-Iranian Journal of 1958 under the title Nakulīśa–Pāśupata–Darśanam. This was followed by the submission of his dis sertation, Materials for the study of Pāśupata Saivism ´ , to the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies of Harvard University in 1966 (Hara 1967). Ever since, Hara has contributed to the research into the history of the Pāśupata religion by a continuous series of meticulous studies. 1 Thanks to these studies our knowledge of this enigmatic but fascinating branch of early Hinduism has significantly increased. Paucity of sources, however, has inevitably hampered our understanding of the process of origin and spread of this religious move ment. Hara, like other scholars before him, duly recognized that the puranic text corpus contains numerous references to the Pāśupata religioṇYet, due to inconsistencies of all sorts and uncertainty as to their exact dates, he consid ered, rightly, the use of these texts for historic purposes a hazardous affair and consequently assigned them to the periphery of historical research. That is to say, for the time being, since,</p>
<p>Some day in the future, when all Purāṇic texts are critically edited and the inter relationships among them established, they may help us in tracing the history of Pāśupata Saivism. (Hara 1967, 12 f.) ´</p>
<p>This day is, after thirty-four years, still far off. Critical editions of some Purāṇa texts have indeed been prepared since, by the All-India Kashiraj Trust in Ram nagar, the Oriental Institute in Vadodara (Viṣṇupurāṇa), and the Institute of</p>
<p>∗ The first version of this article was published in Wezler, Albrecht &amp; Ryutaro Tsuchida (eds.), Harānandalaharī. Volume in Honour of Professor Minoru Hara on his Seventieth Birthday. Inge Wezler Verlag, Reinbek 2000. pp. 1–19.</p>
<p>1 A collection of his contributions appeared in 2002 (Hara 2002).</p>

<p>Learning and Research in Ahmedabad (Bhāgavatapurāṇa), but they have not really brought the progress in Purāṇa studies that one should wish. Partly this is due to the unwieldiness of the puranic text corpus, partly to the fact that no old manuscript material has been used for these editions. How valuable ancient manuscripts are for gaining insight in the puranic text tradition itself and for the assessment of these texts as historical sources may be shown by the original Skandapurāṇa (SP), the edition of which is a long-term project of the Institute of Indian Studies in GroningeṇBecause the oldest manuscript of this text is dated ad 810, we can be certain that the information it contains dates from the eighth century or earlier. But even in this particular case the use of the Purāṇa text as a source of historical information remains a venturesome undertaking. Its historical value is greatly enhanced, however, when it proves possible to relate its data to other historical sources such as inscriptions. It is a matter of good fortune that this turns out to be the case in chapter 167 of the original Skandapurāṇa, a chapter—transmitted in two old Nepalese manu scripts, among which the one dated in ad 810—which deals with the traditional history and holy places of the Pāśupata and which is, as we will show, partly in agreement with epigraphical evidence of the seventh century. In this tribute to Hara I intend to make a modest contribution to the objective envisaged by the great Japanese scholar, viz. ‘tracing the history of Pāśupata Saivism’. ´</p>
<p>Saiva cosmology ´</p>
<p>The cosmology developed in mainstream early tantric Saivism distinguishes between the Pure (śuddhādhvan) and the Impure Universe (aśuddhādhvan). Both universes are hierarchically structured; the different levels of reality or domains are called tattva. A standard hierarchy counts thirty-one domains in the Impure Universe and five domains in the Pure one. 2 The domain that forms the trait-d’union between both universes is the Māyātattva. According to the Svacchandatantra, this reality can be divided into two layers (puṭa), which are separated by a knot or barrier (granthi). 3 Each layer comprises six ‘worlds’ (bhuvana) that are reigned over by altogether twelve Rudras. The barrier or granthi seems actually to be the border between both universes and may be considered a layer or madhyapuṭa by itself (SvT 10.1122–1131).</p>
<p>2 See e.g. Davis 1991, 45. The canonical list of 36 tattvas is, as has been demonstrated by Goodall 1998, li–lv, in fact a consensus only reached ‘in the post-scriptural Saiva ´ Siddhānta of the commentators’ (ibiḍlii).</p>
<p>3 The Svacchanda is a Bhairava (Mantrapīṭha) Tantra and does not belong to the tradition of the Saiva Siddhānta, though it seems to be quite close to this tradition (Sanderson ´ 1988, 669 f.).

<p>The first Rudra on our side of the barrier is Gopati and the Rudra reign ing the lowest ‘world’ of the sub-barrier layer of the Māyātattva is Gahana. 4 Directly underneath him spreads the ‘net of bonds’ (pāśajāla), 5 the created world that emerges from the Māyā Reality, assuming material form through the tattvas including those known from the Sāṁkhya system. The first Rudra on yonder side of the barrier is Kṣemeśa, followed by Brahmasvāmin; the principal Rudra of the Māyā Reality is Ananta. 6 The Svacchanda and its commentator seem to be confused as to whether the supra-barrier layer of the Māyā Reality still pertains to the Impure or to the Pure Universe (SvT 10.1129–31); the Niśvāsamukha, however, considers it still all part of the aśuddhādhvan (4.121– 25). 7 In the middle, according to the Svacchanda, that is on the barrier itself, at the very top of the Impure Universe, reigns the bountiful lord Ananta, the Master of the World (bhagavān ananteśo jagatpatih.), who creates at will, is omniscient, maker of all, and dedicated to meting out confinement and grace (SvT 10.1127–28). Commenting on this passage Kṣemarāja observes that the Mataṅgaśāstra situates Vigraheśāna in this madhyapuṭa, who is surrounded by eight Rudras: Sarva, Bhava, Ugra, Bhīma, Bhasman, Antaka, Dundubhi, and ´ Srīvatsa. ´ 8 The Niśvāsamukha places Vigraheśa immediately above Gahana. 9</p>
<p>In the Pure Universe, above the reality (tattva) of Suddhavidyā (Vāgīśvarī) ´ are, according to the Svacchanda, the worlds of the eight Rudras who are</p>

A critical edition of the Mukha has been prepared by Nirajan Kafle and has been defended as part of his thesis in Leiden on 15 October 2015.

<p>7 In Niśvāsamukha Paṭala 4 the text deals with the Atimārga. My treatment of this intricate subject in the original publication of 2000 was based on a letter by Alexis Sanderson (Oxford) to the author (21–7–’97), in which he generously placed at my disposal a preliminary edition of a portion of this text with an elaborate apparatus of testimonia. Since then much progress has been made in the edition and study of the Niśvāsatattvasaṁhitā corpus, and a critical edition of the three oldest Sūtras of this corpus—the Mūla, Uttara, and Naya—made by Dominic Goodall and others (including Alexis Sanderson), was published in Pondich´ery in 2015. For further details I refer to the Prolegomena of this editioṇFor an assessment see Bakker 2018. See also Kafle 2015 for a critical edition of the Niśvāsamukha.</p>
<p>8 Kṣemarāja ad SvT 10.1127ab. Kṣemarāja adds that the Srīpūrvaśāstra ´ (i.e. Mālinīvija yottaratantra 5.28–29) speaks of only eight deities (īśvarāṣṭa) in the Māyātattva that form a maṇḍala of the size of a thumb, the first one of them being Mahādeva. Mata˙nga 1.8.83–85:</p>

<p>incarnated in the eight Pramāṇa texts of the Pāśupata: Pañcārtha etc. 10 Though none of these texts has come to light so far, we have a glimpse of the Pañcārthapramāṇa, as this text is quoted by Kṣemarāja ad Svacchanda 1.41–43. This fragment establishes that also the prime Pramāṇa of the Lākula division of the Pāśupata (see below)—in contrast with the system known from the Pāśupatasūtra and its commentary—acknowledges the ascending hierarchy of Rudra worlds; these are classified into three categories, namely aghora, ghora, and ghoraghoratara. Here we meet the very same Rudras again: ‘Those Rudras who have been mentioned, beginning with Gopati and ending with Gahana, they, however, are designated ‘terrible’ (ghora); they live in various worlds.’ 11</p>
<p>With regard to the fourth of these Pramāṇa texts, the Hr̥daya, Kṣemarāja makes an interesting remark. From this text six other Pramāṇa texts have been extracted that deal with ritual acts (kriyā) and in this respect differ from the other eight Pramāṇas, which deal with knowledge (jñāna). 12 These ritual Pramāṇas are said to have been revealed by a pupil of Laku(leśa), Musu lendra. 13</p>
<p>This brings Kṣemarāja to the difference between two divisions within the Pāśupata movement (referred to as ‘Tantra’), namely between the Pāśupata proper, founded by Lakuleśa, and hence designated ‘Lākula’, and the Mausula, founded by the eponymous pupil of Lakuleśa, Musula or Musulendra. These Mausulas, though Pāśupatas in the wider sense—after all they too stem from Lakuleśa—are put on a lower scale by the Svacchanda and its commentator. Whereas the observance of the Mausulas leads them finally to the Māyā Reality (SvT 11.71cd), the Pāśupatas who base themselves on the eight Pramāṇas and belong to the Lākula division reach the Īśvara Reality in the Pure Universe (SvT 10.1169cd–70ab, 11.71ab).</p>
<p>The Pāśupata movement</p>
<p>The differences between the various traditions that form the Pāśupata move ment become more clear from the treatment (in Svacchanda Paṭala 11) of the ascending hierarchy of highest stations (para(ma)ṁpadam) that can be reached</p>
<p>10 The eight Pramāṇa texts are: Pañcārtha, Guhya, Rudrāṅkuśa, Hr̥daya, Lakṣaṇa, Vyūha, Akars ¯ .a, Adarśa ¯ . Kṣemarāja ad SvT 10.1134: ete rudrā etannāmakapāśupataśāstrāvatā rakāh. (SvT II, 275). 11 Pañcārthapramāṇa: proktā gopatipūrvā ye rudrās tu gahanāntagāḥ| te tu ghorāḥsamākhyātā nānābhuvanavāsinaḥk (SvT I, 16). 12 One wonders whether these ritual acts are subsumed under the six forms of wor ship specified in the Pāśupatasūtra (PS) 1.8: laughter, song, dance, bellowing, mak ing obeisance, and muttering (PS 1.8: hasitagītanr̥ttaḍuṁḍuṁkāranamaskārajapyopa hāreṇopatiṣṭhet |). 13 The names of these texts are given as (SvT II, 275): Purakalpa, Kanaka, Sālā, Niruttara, ´ Viśva, Prapañca. They are no longer extant.</p>
<p>13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta 287</p>
<p>by the followers of the various sects. 14 The Mausula is here grouped together with the Kāruka, 15 of which Kṣemarāja only notes that it has been founded by someone else, descended in the place Kārohaṇa. 16 The followers of both sects, whose observances (vrata) deal with a multitude of rituals, reach the worlds of the Rudras Kṣemeśa and Brahmasvāmin, whom the Svacchanda (10.1125) had situated on yonder side of the barrier (granthi), though still in the Māyā Reality. 17</p>
<p>Within the Lākula division the Svacchanda seems to distinguish between the Vaimalas and those who follow the eight Pramāṇas, more specifically the Pañcārtha, according to Kṣemarāja; both reach the Īśvara Reality, but the for mer’s highest station is the world of the Rudra Tejeśa, while of the latter it is that of Dhruveśa. 18 The Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61 (i.e. ad 380/81, or ad 388, according to Falk 2004, 173) reports that a tradition of preceptors (guru) whose names end in vimala and who may have hence belonged to the Vaimala division, were affiliated to a lineage of teachers (ācārya) that traced its origin back to Kuśika, supposedly the first disciple of Lakulīśa. The sacred memory of these gurus was kept alive in a ‘preceptor’s shrine’ (gurvāyatana), where cult objects were installed bearing their names (Upamiteśvara and Kapileśvara), objects which were to be worshipped by the Māheśvaras. 19 The Vaimalas may therefore have adhered to the Pāśupata school that followed the Pañcārtha doctrine as laid down in the Pāśupatasūtra (see below, p. 295). Finally, the Svacchanda specifies a group within the Lākula division that practises the observance of the skull (kapālavrata). This group</p>
<p>14 A similar hierarchy, though unfortunately without the allocation of the Pāśupata sects by name, is given by Rāmakaṇṭha in his sub-commentary (upanyāsa) of the (lost) partial commentary on the Raurava by Sadyojyotis, the Sarvāgamaprāmāṇya, reconstructed by Goodall 1998, xxii–xxv.</p>
<p>15 SvT 11.71cd quoted by Jayaratha ad Tantrāloka 1.34 (I, 70): mausule kāruke caiva māyātattvaṁprakīrtitam k 11.71cd k</p>
<p>16 Who this founder is does not become clear. He might be ‘Karuka’ whose name evidently connects him, in the view of Kṣemarāja, with the place of his descent, Kārohaṇa. Bhan darkar 1913, 121 identifies this sect with the Kālāmukha (Kālānana) and conjectures that ‘the word Kāruka is probably a corruption of Kauruṣya, the name of the third of the four (according to the Purāṇas) pupils of Lakulīśa, or this last name may be the Sanskritised form of the original Kāruka’. Cf. Pathak 1960, 10. Lorenzen 1991, 84 rejects this identificatioṇCf. below, n. 3 on p. 527.</p>

<p>tejeśo vaimalānāṁca pramāṇe ca dhruvaṁpadam k 72 k</p>
<p>Cf. SvT 10.1174ab, where Tejeśa and Dhruveśa are both said to be the highest station for the followers of the Pramāṇas (see below, n. 20 on p. 288).</p>
<p>19 Sircar, SI I, 277–279; Bakker 1997, 68; below, p. 494.</p>
<p>seems to coincide with or to encompass the Vaimala, though Kse. marāja’s com mentary does not make this very clear. 20 So far as to the Lākula division.</p>
<p>The question now arises: who is this disciple of Lakuleśa, Musulendra or Musula, who initiated a sect designated ‘Mausula’? Evidently we are here concerned with a group within the Pāśupata movement that was chiefly en gaged in ritual (worship) activity, forsaking the more rigorous portion of the Pāśupata praxis. As such it might be a group that stood between the lay Māheśvaras (laukikas) and the tough ascetics with their transgressive prac tices. Unfortunately, none of the Pramāṇa texts ascribed by Kṣemarāja to this school has survived and little more information about the sect is known from the later Saiva Siddhānta, which, in view of its ritualistic orientation, in a way ´ may be conceived of as its successor (see below, p. 296). However, the alleged dependence of the Mausula text corpus on the Lākula Pramāṇas seems to allow the inference that this sect also ackowledged the hierarchy of Rudra worlds and as such deviated from the Pañcārtha school.</p>

<p>The quarter-verse ‘His soul is purified by initiation and knowledge’ indicates the dif ference here from the afore-mentioned Mausulas and Kārukas, who are devoted only to observances that are chiefly ritualistic. ‘His own (station)’, that is to say the afore mentioned Tejeśa or Dhruveśa; this has been stated above:</p>
<p>Tejeśa and Dhruveśa are the highest station (for those who follow) the Pramāṇas. [SvT 10.1174]</p>
<p>But those, (issuing) from the afore-mentioned Lākula stream, who practise the ob servances of bones like the skull (kapāla), on account of injunctions in the Pāśupata Sāstra such as ‘One should lie in ashes’ [PS 1.3], ´</p>
<p>They, devoted to japa, ashes, and ritual, proceed to the station of Īśvara.</p>

<p>13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta 289</p>
<p>The epigraphical evidence from Malhar</p>
<p>The antiquity of a tradition that traced its origin back to a certain Mugalisa who was initiated by Lakulīśa is secured by an inscription of which the text has recently become available. I refer to the Malhar Plates of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57 (c. ad 650), actually found in Junvānī (near Malhar) and hence also known as The Junvānī Copperplate Inscription of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57, 21 which was published by G.ḶRaykwar and Rahul Kumar Singh in Purātan (Vol. 9 (1994), 146 f.). 22</p>
<p>I take ‘Mugalisa’ to be a variant or prakritism of Mudgalīśa or Musalīśa, both names meaning ‘Club-bearing Lord’. Musalīśa again may be a variant of Musaleśa/Musuleśa and, having the same meaning, it might not seem too far-fetched to identify the ‘Musulendra’ of Kṣemarāja with the ‘Mugalisa’ of the inscription. 23</p>
<p>I present here my edition of 2000, which gave a Sanskrit text that was slightly emended according to its intended reading. Since then, however, I have reconsidered this edition and proposed some alterations in Bakker 2014, 143 f. These are presented in the notes.</p>
<p>Before discussing this inscription any further, I give the text of that portion of it that is relevant for the present study. This portion starts with the last word on the first plate (second side), line 8, and ends in line 23 on the second plate, second side.</p>
<p>21 For the early chronology of Dakṣiṇa Kosala, the Pāṇḍuvaṁśa dynasty of Srīpura and ´ the reign of Mahāśivagupta (c. ad 590–650) see Bakker 1994b; above, pp. 235 ff.</p>
<p>22 My edition of this inscription in Bakker 2000 was based, in addition to Raykwar and Singh’s edition of 1994, on a draft of a new edition by Ajay Mitra Shastri (Nagpur), which was published in 2001 (cf. Shastri 1995 II, 380 f.). Since then the original edition of Raykwar &amp; Singh has been republished in Raykwar &amp; Singh 2005, 188–192. The inscription was again edited by Susmita Majumdar in 2007. This set of three plates of copper is presently in the collection of Shri Raghunandan Prasad Pandeya (Raykwar &amp; Singh 2005, 188; Majumdar 2007, 285). Shastri, unlike Raykwar and Singh, worked from photographs. Majumdar saw the plates herself and made use of photographs provided by Rahul Kumar Singh (Majumdar 2007, 293 n. 1). The text starts on the verso side of the first plate and comprises altogether 40 lines.</p>
<p>23 I consider musula/mausula to be a variant of musala/mausala. Cf. Rāmakaṇṭha’s intro duction to Mataṅga 1.1.1 (p. 2) reading: lākulamausalādibhyah.. That we are concerned with an ancient historic tradition seems to be confirmed by grafitti found in the caves at Padaṇa Hill (Bombay), reading: sadhamusala (siddhamusala), and twice musaladatta. See Indraji 1881–82; Bakker 1991, 23; Bisschop 2006, 47. The site has been destroyed by building developments.</p>

<p>13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta 291</p>
<p>Bhāṇḍāgāra-Tulapadraka in the district of Oṇī in return—this village (scil. Pāśipadraka) together with Kurapadraka, along with the rights to hidden treasures and deposits, the right to collect all taxes, immunity from all impositions, the right to impose fines for the ten offences, and the exemption from being entered by officials and constables, starting immediately, has been bestowed by us here and now, on the day of full moon of Māgha (?) with the offering of a libation and by (this) copperplate charter, upon the feet of the illustrious Bhīmasoma, for the increase of merit of father, mother and ourselves and to be enjoyed as long as moon, stars and sun will last:</p>
<p>There are eight embodiments of Siva, the Vigraheśvaras; the embodiments of ´ Gahaneśa are the sixty-six Rudras who bestow grace (initiation) and who roam about in successive yugas. Now the Kali Age has come and Lakulīśanātha has descended. He was born in the family of a brahmin named Somaśarman; after having been initiated by him (i.e. Somaśarman) in the Great Vow he became a moon on earth. 25 And he again (i.e. Lakulīśanātha) initiated Mugalisa. Then, in due succession of the lineage that started with Soma (‘the Moon’), the afore-mentioned Bhīmasoma—the pupil of the illustrious Tejasoma and grand-pupil of the illustrious guru Rudrasoma 26 —has been (justly) raised to the position responsible for the protection of the tapovana attached to the Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka (Temple), which has been erected by ourselves. The donation is made to meet the expenses of ceremonies, initiations, teaching and housing of pupils and grand-pupils and to restore the shrines that have fallen into decay and are in need of repair.</p>
<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>The inscription is of paramount importance for more than one reasoṇOne of them is that, in addition to the lineage of preceptors, it gives doctrinal arguments to legitimize the claims of the recipient Bhīmasoma. These doctrinal arguments should be compared with what we know of Pāśupata theology. In order to follow the paraṁparā of teachers back to Siva himself, the text refers ´ first to the latter’s eight forms that are designated ‘Vigraheśvaras’. As we have seen above, Vigraheśvara is, according to one tradition, 27 the name of the deity who stands at the apex of our cosmos, in the granthi, where it borders on the Pure Universe. There he is surrounded by eight Rudras, four of whom bear names that mark the Aṣṭamūrti according to Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.2–3. Just</p>
<p>25 Having reconsidered the issue, I have accepted the reading of the epigraph in my 2014 publication, against the emendation accepted in Bakker 2000 (reproduced here). This has led to a new interpretation in Bakker 2014, 144:</p>
<p>Consecrated by the Great Vow (Mahāvrata), He (i.e. Lakulīśanātha) became a ‘Moon on Earth’ (Jagadindu). By Him again Mugalisa [was initiated].</p>
<p>26 If we follow Majumdar’s emendation we should translate: ‘the illustrious Sthānaguru Rudrasoma’.</p>
<p>27 This seems to be the tradition of the Saiva Siddhānta as represented by the ´ Niśvāsa mukha and the Mataṅga (see above p. 285).</p>
<p>like Rudra, the (grand)son of Prajāpati, through his eight forms, is the actual manifestation of God in the created cosmos, sometimes represented as the divine child, 28 so, it seems, is Siva in his eightfold form of Vigraheśvara (‘the ´ Lord of Form’) considered the fountain-head of our universe in the theology underlying the inscription at issue. Then the inscription mentions Gahaneśa (‘the Lord of the Abyss’), the Rudra who rules the lowest world of the Māyā Reality in the sub-barrier layer, directly above the ‘abyss’ or ‘net of bonds’, the material world. He is said to roam about in sixty-six embodiments in successive yugas and Lakulīśa is just the last of these incarnations in the present Kaliyuga.</p>
<p>In a letter already mentioned (see above, n. 7 on p. 285) Professor Alexis Sanderson brought an unpublished text to my notice, the Jayadrathayāmala (JRY), which belongs to the (later) Bhairava scriptures of Agamic Saivism. Sanderson kindly placed at my disposal a portion of the edition he made of this text (4.449–460), based on a ms in the National Archives in Kathmandu. 29 He drew my attention to the fact that this text describes the sixty-six em bodiments as ‘the Bhavas who reside in the sixty-six Māna (i.e. Pramāṇa) [worlds]’. 30 These embodiments or manifestations are divided into two lines of gurus (gurupaṅktis), a set of twenty-eight Sivas and one of thirty-eight Rudras, ´ which are associated with different levels of Saiva teaching. The first set, which ´ begins with Sveta and of which the last two gurus are Someśa and Lakulīśa, ´ is said to bestow both exegesis of the scriptures and, occasionally, initiation, following the division of the Pramāṇajñāna. 31 The second line of thirty-eight Rudras, which begins with Vareśvara and ends with Vaṣaṭkāra, is said to be authorized to granting initiation and is described as propounding the teachings of Bhairava. 32 It may be that the Pāśupata ascetic Udbhavarāśi, who is known</p>

<p>13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta 293</p>
<p>from an inscription from the Gandharveśa Temple in Sirpur (Srīpura) (c. ´ ad 600), claimed to belong to this lineage, since he is explicitly called a Rudra (see below, p. 532).</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the inscription at issue in mentioning the sixty-six Rudra manifestations descending from Gahaneśa, ‘who roam about in successive yugas to bestow grace (initiation)’, refers to the doctrine mentioned in the Jayadrathayāmala. This is again reinforced by the fact that the last two of the twenty-eight Siva manifestations, Someśa and Lakulīśa also figure ´ prominently in the inscription. 33 To Someśa or Somaśarman, as he is called in the inscription, we will return below.</p>
<p>Lakulīśanātha, unlike Somaśarman, is explicitly said in the inscription to be an avatāra and through him the lineage of the donee Bhīmasoma is directly connected with the divine (Rudra) paraṁparā: Gahaneśa, Vigraheśvara, Siva. ´ Bhīmasoma’s lineage, namely, is said to stem from Lakulīśa through the latter’s pupil Mugalisa, who was initiated by the ‘Moon on Earth’, Lakulīśa, and whom we have identified with Musula or Musulendra, the founder of the Mausula sect. If this identification is right, the conclusion would be natural that the lineage of Bhīmasoma belonged to the sect of the Mausulas, who, as we have seen, probably acknowledged the theology of an hierarchy of Rudra worlds, which plays such an important role in the inscription.</p>
<p>Somaśarman and the Somasiddhanta ¯</p>
<p>Here, however, we encounter a difficulty. Though Bhīmasoma and his predeces sors no doubt belonged to the Pāśupata fold, the designation ‘Mausula’ does not occur in the inscriptioṇWith the Mausulas these ācāryas may have in common, it would seem, that they were engaged with ceremonies (kriyā) and worship rather than with ascetic practices, though they were in charge of the tapovana attached to the Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka Temple in Srīpura. But how ´ do we explain that their names end in soma? On account of these names I have argued (Bakker 2000a, 1159) that these ācāryas probably belonged to the Pāśupata sect known as Somasiddhānta, a sect that hardly, if at all, features in Agamic literature where it is concerned with the Atimārga, but which in later sources is often equated with the Kāpālikas. 34 Pāśupata ascetics whose names</p>
<p>33 From this evidence we may infer that a distinct Bhairava tradition within Saivism was acknowledged by the middle of the 7th century; it would seem, however, that Bhīmasoma did not himself belong to this tradition, since he affiliates himself to the first lineage of ‘Sivas’. ´</p>
<p>34 In the play Prabodhacandrodaya by Kr̥ṣṇamiśra (c. ad 1050–1100), the doctrine of the Somasiddhānta is identified with that of the Kāpālikas (Handiqui 1965, 640–645). Fur ther see Lorenzen 1991, 82 ff., 215 ff.; Pathak 1960, 25. Alexis Sanderson pointed out to me that the Kapālin Satyasoma and his companion Devasomā feature in the Matta vilāsaprahasana of the Pallava king Mahendravikramavarman (cf. Lorenzen 1991, 53).</p>
<p>end in soma are known from several inscriptions in which they are said to be engaged in the Mahāvrata, the observance in which, according to the Malhar inscription, Lakulīśa was initiated. 35 Consequently, another question arises: who was Somaśarman?</p>
<p>The name Somaśarman was already known from the Vāyu◦ and Liṅgapurāṇas and he is evidently the same as the Someśa named in the Jayadrathayāmala as Lakulīśa’s predecessor (see above, p. 293). These Purāṇas describe him as the 27th incarnation of Siva, born in Prabhāsatīrtha, ´ a holy place in Saurashtra near the Arabian Sea, famous for its Somanātha Temple, an assignment that makes the impression of being secondary. 36 The legend told in the Malhar Plates, however, is apparently somewhat different. It says that Lakulīśanātha was born in the brahmin family of Somaśarman, who therefore may have been a senior contemporary of his. Moreover, Lakulīśa is said to have been initiated by this Somaśarman in the Mahāvrata and so became the ‘Moon on Earth’. 37</p>
<p>Somaśarman and his family (kula) thus appear, in the religious imagination of the believer, to have been the House (śarman) from which the Moon (soma) rose over the world (jagadindu). The play of words may allude to ‘Soma’ as a name of Siva and the transfiguration undergone by Lakulīśa in the initiation ´ ritual, which, when he underwent the anointment with ashes, made him shine like the moon.</p>
<p>The evidence of the Skandapuraṉ .a</p>
<p>The tradition recorded in the inscription seems also to have been known to the author(s) of the original Skandapurāṇa (SP). This text, too, places</p>
<p>35 Alexis Sanderson kindly provided me with the following informatioṇThe Indargarh Pāśupata stone inscription of ad 710–11 was engraved by a Mahāvratin with the name Cāmuṇḍasoma (Journal of the Bihar Research Society 1955, 249–261). A Mahāvratin Somibhaṭṭāraka/ Sobadeva of the Kolanupākā inscription of ad 1050 is described as proficient in expounding the Somasiddhānta (Select Epigraphs of Andhra Padesh No.4). Two inscriptions of the time of the Cola king Rājādhirāja II (Nos. 403 of 1896 and 206 of 1912 of the Madras Epigraphical Collection), mention a Somasiddhāntin, though ‘soma’ is not affixed to his name: Vāgīśabhaṭṭa (EI XXVII (1947–48), 297 f.). The predecessors of this and other priests associated with the Tiruvorriyur Temple, ‘five hundred Brˆahmaṇa Mahˆavratins’, were, according to the account of the Sthalapurāṇa, ‘brought from the banks of the Ganges’ (EI XXVII, 300 n. 1). See also Bakker 2014, 149 f. for ◦Soma priests belonging to the Muṇḍa–Sr ´.ṅkhalika Pāśupatas serving at the Paśupatinātha Temple in Nepal.</p>
<p>36 VāP 23.214–217; LiP 1.24.120–124. Another feature that makes the impression of being secondary is that Akṣapāda (=Gautama?), Kumāra (or Kaṇāda), Ulūka and Vatsa are mentioned as his pupils. Dviveda 1982 remarks about him: ‘Prabhāsatīrtham āsādya somaśarmā prādurbhūtaḥ| nāsti pāṭhāntaram atra | .’</p>
<p>37 By accepting the reading mahāvratena in l. 17 instead of the conjecture mahāvrate tena, our interpretation (Bakker 2014) has significantly changed. I now think that the inscrip tion tells us most likely that Lakulīśanātha became a ‘Moon on Earth’ thanks to his commitment to the Mahāvrata.</p>
<p>13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta 295</p>
<p>Somaśarman in the Kali Age and he and his family are said to have been the first ones blessed with Lakulīśa’s grace; the text apparently implies that the latter was born in Somaśarman’s, i.e., Atri’s House. The spot where the incarnation took place is called Kārohaṇa. 38 The relevant passage reads:</p>
<p>And God, the Lord of the gods, who is possessed of supreme sovereignty, after having assumed a white-bodied form (i.e. a body like that of the moon), went to the auspicious House of Atri, (that is to say, he went to the house of a man) named Somaśarman, who was born in the lineage of Atri. That lord, i.e. Sam ´ . kara, blessed/initiated that brahman-knowing brahmin belonging to Atri’s lineage to gether with his (whole) family by bestowing upon him perfection in yoga. There upon, after he had initiated this excellent brahmin and his family, O Vyāsa, God went to Ujjayanī (Ujjain) and entered the cremation ground. There the bull bannered God took a bath in ashes, took a torch in his left hand and sat down (in meditation). 39</p>
<p>In Ujjain the God-man accepted Kauśika as his first disciple, 40 and then this ‘white-bodied’ or moon-like incarnation went to Jambūmārga, Mathurā and Kanyakubja, where he initiated Gārgya, Mitra and a fourth person who is only said to have been born in a good gotra in the Country of the Kurus, whose name may have become Kaurus.(y)a (SPS 167.122–123). Then the Lord, here named Lāguḍi, taught them his own doctrine (svasiddhānta), known as ‘Pañcārtha’, which, as the Skandapurāṇa suggests, was different from the doctrine of his se nior, the blessed Somaśarman. 41 I take this as an indication that the author(s) of the Skandapurāṇa belonged to circles that were closer to the Lākula than to the Mausula division.</p>

<p>Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhanta ¯</p>
<p>When we return to the Junvānī inscription and combine its evidence with that of the Skandapurāṇa, we may say that there evidently was a tradition within the Pāśupata fold that recognized a, what we may call ‘Pāśupata milieu’ be fore the appearance of Lakulīśa. Somaśarman belonged to this milieu. In the Pāñcārthika-Pāśupata context he was mostly either ignored, or relegated to a previous yuga by being promoted to an avatāra of Siva himself. Both ´ our sources, however, the inscription and the Skandapurāṇa, emphasize that, though they recognize Somaśarman as a patriarch, Somaśarman is not an in carnation, and he or his tradition derived legitimacy only from the belief that Lakulīśa was born in or resorted to his House. According to the Skandapurāṇa, Somaśarman himself was favoured with initiation by Lakulīśa, according to the inscription it was the other way round, 42 but, the inscription adds, the lineage of Bhīmasoma, received its ‘certificate of divinity’ through Mugalisa, who was initiated by the incarnated Siva himself. ´</p>
<p>The combined evidence of both sources thus seems to suggest that there ex isted an early Saiva tradition that, on the one hand, recognized the uniqueness ´ of Lakulīśa’s incarnation, but that, on the other hand, distanced itself from the Pāñcārthika and Lākula divisions. In its initial stage this tradition, or one strand of it, may have been named after its putative preceptor: ‘Mausula’. In the course of time other groups may have been assimilated, and gradually a distinct theology and praxis may have been developed, which became known as the Somasiddhānta, thus preserving a reference to a distant saint who was hal lowed as its founder, SomaśarmaṇPart of this tradition, again, may eventually have merged with groups that produced the Bhairava texts such as the Jayad rathayāmala, that is to say, became indistinguishable from the Kāpālikas. 43 Others may have joined the Saiva Siddhānta, of which a ´ maṭhikā was attached to the very same temple complex of Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka in Srīpura. ´ 44</p>
<p>42 This clause is no longer valid according my 2014 interpretation; above, p. 290. 43 Sanderson 1988, 668.</p>
<p>44 A hoard of nine copperplate grants of Mahāśivagupta Bālārjuna was found in Sirpur (Shastri 1995 II, 376–379; see also Shastri 1992a and Shastri 2001). These nine charters have been edited and published by Rahul Kumar Singh in Raykwar &amp; Singh 2005, 196–217. It appears that in this Sirpur hoard there are altogether seven charters that record grants made to Saiva ´ ācāryas said to issue from Nandapura, but who were living in this maṭhikā in Srīpura. The lineage of these ´ ācāryas should therefore been seen as a subbranch of the Nandapur one; it can be reconstructed from these grants: 1) śaivācārya Aghoraśiva, 2) bhagavatpāda Dīrghaśiva, 3) bhagavatpāda Vyāpaśiva, and 4) sthānaguru Astraśiva. All the donations were made to meet the expenses on repairs, daily worship and musical performances. From these inscriptions and the names of the Saiva ´ ācāryas ending in śiva it becomes clear that the Saiva Siddhānta was firmly ´ established in Dakṣiṇa Kosala, at least from the second half of the 6th century onwards. The original headquarters may have been in Nandapura, a place not properly identified, but probably an administrative division within the Pāṇḍava Kingdom. The charters of the Sirpur hoard and their significance for our understanding of the Bāleśvara-bhaṭṭāraka Temple complex in Sirpur have been evaluated in Bosma 2018, 75–87.</p>
<p>13 / Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and Somasiddhānta 297</p>
<p>The Skandapurāṇa goes a step further in its mystification of the origins by affiliating Somaśarman to the lineage of Atri, the father of the Moon, that is to the Lunar Race, the Somavaṁśa. 45 There are indications that this powerful symbolism was not lost on the rulers of Dakṣiṇa Kosala. It can hardly be coincidence that the Junvānī inscription is a charter issued by a king who proclaims to belong to the Somavaṁśa. 46 After the theological and legendary superstructure, the actual paraṁparā of Bhīmasoma is said to begin with Soma, thus creating, possibly intentionally, a profound ambiguity: Soma who? Soma that is Siva, Soma that is the son of Atri, the Moon, Soma that is Somaśarman, ´ Soma that is Jagadindu (i.e. Lakulīśanātha), or just a preceptor named Soma who lived long after the times of Lakulīśa and Mugalisa, but who happened to start a tradition of ascetic teachers within the Pāśupata fold?</p>
<p>The intimate relationship of the royal Soma dynasty with this particular branch of Pāśupatas may thus have been endorsed by an ideology according to which both claimed descent from Soma—the dynastic one from Soma, the son of Atri, the sectarian one from the ‘Moon on Earth’ that appeared in the family of Somaśarman, that is in the House of the MooṇThis House may therefore have been conceived by the mythmakers of the time as the joint cradle of two lineages: a worldly one culminating in Mahāśivagupta, the Somavaṁśin king of Kosala, and a religious one headed by Bhīmasoma, an ācārya living in the temple complex founded and patronized by his royal counterpart.</p>
<p>45 That this tradition was not completely obliterated in later centuries, but locally survived well into the second millennium is shown by the Kāravaṇamāhātmya. This late text sings the greatness of the Kārohaṇa tīrtha, which is unanimously identified with the village Karvan c. 30 km north of Baroda (ḌR̥Bhandarkar 1906–07; Lorenzen 1991, 177). We encounter the following pedigree of Siva’s incarnation in the fourth ´ adhyāya of this far from homogeneous text, spoken by Mahādeva (edition in Dalal 1920, 51):</p>
