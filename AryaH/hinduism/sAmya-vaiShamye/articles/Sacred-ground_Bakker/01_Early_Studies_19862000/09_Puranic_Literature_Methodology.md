Some Methodological Considerations with 
Respect to the Critical Edition of 
Puranic Literature∗ 

Introduction 

Remarkably, two much-debated issues appear to have had little or no conse quence for the editing of classical Sanskrit texts. I am thinking of Paul Hacker’s methodology for the investigation of anonymous Sanskrit literature, 1 as well as of a field of study that might be referred to as ‘oral poetics’. Neither Hacker him self nor any of his pupils whose investigations were concerned with the historical development of Viṣṇu’s avatars have provided us with solid text-editions to un derpin their findings. 2 On the other hand, although Indian literature avowedly comprises one of the world’s greatest oral traditions, Sanskritists have seldom had recourse to the theories about oral poetry developed by scholars of other languages, nor has Sanskrit material been taken into account in, for instance, C.ṀBowra’ s Heroic Poetry, in A.B. Lord’s The Singer of Tales, or in such general works as Oral Poetry. Das Problem der Mündlichkeit mittelalterlicher epischer Dichtung, or Ruth Finnegan’s Oral Poetry (1977). If we think of the studies of Emeneau (1958), and Kailasapathy (1968), or John Smith, 3 we must conclude that Dravidian and New Indo-Aryan literary traditions are thought to be more appropriate for an investigation along the lines of comparative oral poetics than their Sanskrit counterparts. In this respect the neglect of classical anonymous Sanskrit literature is understandable, if we think of puranic litera ture of which the written nature (Schriftlichkeit) has never been seriously ques tioned since Kirfel’s ‘Erschütterung’ of the ‘Hypothese von der Jahrhunderte langen mündlichen Tradition gr¨osserer Texte in Indien’ in the Introduction of

his Purāṇapañcalakṣaṇa’ (PPL p. il). Before going further into the matter of critically editing these texts, a few words need to be said on some character istics of this type of literature viewed in the light of the results attained by investigators of oral literary traditions elsewhere. 

The theory of ‘oral composition’ 

Speaking of the techniques of composition of epic or similar texts inevitably means discussing the theories advanced by the school founded by Milman Parry (1971) and carried on by his pupil Albert Lord (1960). The Parry–Lord theory, as it might be called, sees the ‘formulaic style’ as the differentia specifica of orally composed epic texts. 4 The elaboration of this theory by Lord has inspired various scholars to investigate medieval epic texts on ‘formularity’ and has led them to claim oral composition for all those texts in which they found a high percentage of formulaic diction. 5 This generalisation of the original thesis of Parry to the effect that formularity is not only considered a necessary corollary of orality but an actual proof of oral composition has been criticised by several scholars among whom I wish to mention only one in the present context. 

A. Hoekstra in his Homeric Modifications of Formulaic Prototypes adduces the case of the Posthomerica, a work of Quintus Smyrnaeus (4th cenṭad), who as far as traditional formulaic diction is concerned ‘probably imitated Homer more closely than Homer followed his predecessors’. 6 Hoekstra goes on to say that: ‘If Greek history were entirely unknown to us up to the fourth century ad and if the Posthomerica were the oldest surviving piece of poetry, the argument put forth in Parry’s Studies in the Epic Technique of Oral Verse-Making would necessarily lead to the conclusion that this poem was an oral composition.’ This argument would seem to have a particular relevance for the student of Indian epic and puranic literature, since, on account of the specific nature of this literature, in which ‘originality’ and personal creativity is valued less or disguised, a text like the Posthomerica would not be just an exception or an unsuccessful imitation, on the contrary we could say that, mutatis mutandis, the Indian literary tradition knows hundreds of ‘Posthomericas’, and, worse, their authors are all called ‘Quintus Smyrnaeus’. 7 

Since formularity then does not automatically imply oral transmission, let us focus on another touchstone of oral traditions. In order to explain the formulaic and repetitive style of epic texts the Parry–Lord school holds that for texts to pertain to oral tradition they must be composed in the course of a

‘live’ performance. In view of the Indian evidence, however, this ‘composition in-performance’ might have a variant in a written tradition which could be called ‘composition-in-transmission’. 

Composition-in-transmission 

The many different versions of what basically seems to be one and the same epic or puranic text may have its origin in recomposition during the process of literary transmission rather than in a living oral tradition. 8 By the very nature of this genre, which recognizes divine inspiration as the only authentic source, the role of the individual composer is ignored to such an extent that every skilful author or transmitter may believe himself authorized to change, delete, or add to given text-material without conceiving of this as a personal contribution, distortion, or fraud. The aspiration to create something supra-individual is responsible for the fact that Indian puranic composers vie with each other in minimalizing the effect of empirical, historical and personal circumstances on the texts, making it a hard task for indologists to date and to determine the products. 

The congeniality of both phenomena, ‘composition-in-performance’ and ‘composition-in-transmission’ ensues from the style of the texts themselves. Like orally composed epic poems, puranic texts are often highly formulaic in diction and sometimes repetitive to a degree that Westerners are likely to regard as tedious and inappropriate to written form. Yet the conclusion that puranic literature as known to us must be a product of oral tradition seems to be based on a fallacy. These texts are formulaic and repetitive, first of all because this style lends authority to the texts, and secondly, because it ac counts for a process on an Indian scale of ‘composition-in-transmission’. These observations entail that the techniques of composition of oral and written texts of this sort have much in commoṇIn both instances the composer is well-trained in a traditional formulaic language and has memorized large pieces of text which he can reproduce and modify at will. The first consideration of style refers to the conservatism of the Indian cultural tradition which often disparages innovation and idiosyncracy. A puranic author who intended to present a new subject, vision, or altered situation had rather to comply with traditional style and diction on penalty of being ignored. 

Both arguments, the stylistic and the technical one, seem to point, however, to a living oral tradition from which the puranic genre once emerged, 9 and by 

8 Bonazzoli 1983, 260 f. That ‘oral transmission’ does not necessarily imply ‘composition in-performance’ but may rely ‘upon memory rather than improvisation’ is shown by Smith 1977 discussing the Rājasthānī oral epic of Pābūjī Rāṭhaur.. 

9 Cf. Smith 1977, 151; Smith 1980, 51 f. remarks: 

How, exactly, the oral epic came to form the nucleus of the inflated written text is something we shall never know; it is imaginable, but by no means certain, that at some stage there was interaction between oral and written versions. 

The theory advanced here may be seen as an attempt to elucidate something of this ‘unknowable’ phenomenon. 









which it possibly, as we may see, was sustained. Much of the technique and method of the oral composers was retained by their successors who made use of writing and written exemplars, whereas, on the other hand, the conservatism in Indian culture made the characteristics of the bygone oral tradition, such as formulaic diction, repetitiveness, and traditionality of setting and frame-stories, themes, and motives, the very yardstick of authenticity which above anything else could bestow authority upon the texts. 

The phenomenon of ‘composition-in-transmission’ does not exclude scribal activity of the sort in which exemplars are more or less faithfully copied. Both activities may have been practised since the time writing was employed as a means of transmissioṇIn the heyday of the genre, say from ad 400 to ad 1400, composition-in-transmission may have often taken the place of mere copying, and it seems likely that with the extinction of the genius of puranic creativity and fading away of its oral roots copying became the normal practice, yet, until today, specialists may feel entitled to re-compose traditional text-material with out notificatioṇThe amazing persistence of the puranic technique and style of composition may also be ascribed to the custom of reciting the text. Spe cial audiences or occasions may have required newly composed or copied texts, whereas the ambience of these sessions as well as the techniques of recitation involved preserved the professional expertise and contributed to the mnemonic capacities of the pustakavācaka or paurāṇika (see below, p. 607). 

The theory advanced here poses the question of how and when the oral tradition evolved into a written one. Since the practice of ‘composition-in transmission’ requires much of the technique and know-how of an oral tradition, and since, as we know, 10 the analogue practice of recitation supplanted the ‘composition-in-performance’, oral and written traditions may have co-existed for a long time. The general Indian preference for oral rather than written authority may also have contributed to the longevity of the system of combined oral and written transmission. 

The critical edition of epic and puranic literature 

In the first instance the question as to whether the diversity of recensions of puranic text-material is rooted in either oral or written forms of transmission has no direct relevance to the critical editor. For, just as, to quote Lord, ‘the truth of the matter is that our concept of “the original”, of “the song”, simply makes no sense in oral tradition’ (Lord 1960, 101), it is mostly futile to ask for the original or ‘Ur’ form of a text that is handed down to us through a process of ‘composition-in-transmission’. Reconstructing the original text is out of the

9 / Some Methodological Considerations 179 

question, simply because we have to do with a multiple of re-compositions. 11 The questions that the editor should answer are, whether chronological rela tions can be determined between the compositions or recensions; which specific historical and cultural circumstances prompted a re-composition; and how may differences between versions be explained in terms of functionality. The recog nition of these premises inspired Hacker to formulate his ‘Methode’. 12 

A brief evaluation of the accomplishments of critical editing of Indian epic and puranic texts may elucidate the actual state of affairs. Under the influence of Western philologists and armed with the classical method of textual criticism, the edition of the Mahābhārata was undertaken by a team of Indian scholars in the second decade of the twentieth century. 13 From the beginning critical noises were heard and some doubt was raised as to the applicability to such a text of the classical method of editing. 14 

It was, however, a long time before a frontal attack was launched. By that time the monumental critical edition of the Mahābhārata was completed, that of the Rāmāyaṇa was half finished, and the editing on the same principles of Purāṇas had beguṇSupported by the first results of the Parry–Lord school and influenced by French structuralism with its notorious disregard of historicity, Madeleine Biardeau argued for an abandonment of all so-called ‘critical’ editing and stood up for the value of each individual recension. 15 Aside from a number of emotional rather than rational objections, the attitude of the Indian critical school as voiced by V.ṀBedekar (1969) and A.ṢGupta (1970) produced one irrefutable counterargument, viz. that the edition of all different versions of texts like the Mahābhārata is practically impossible. Consequently, the preparation of critical editions was continued along the same lines, until quite recently Giorgio Bonazzoli in charge of the All-India Kashiraj Trust gave a warning that the vessel founders as a result of overloading with incongruous text-materials. 16 

In Germany on the other hand, the cradle of the Indian critical school, occu pation with epic and puranic texts took another course. At its basis lay Kirfel’s reconstruction of the five oldest constituents of puranic literature. Unlike his Indian colleagues, Kirfel recognized the futility of an attempt at reconstructing one most original text. 17 Consequently, his edition contains a synoptic presen 

11 It may be doubted whether an exception on metrical grounds such as carried out for the Mahābhārata by Mary Caroll Smith in an unpublished thesis, acclaimed by John Smith but unaccessible to me, will finally arrive at a single homogeneous text (see Smith 1980, 52 ff.).

tation of different recensions or ‘Textgruppen’ which are not further reducible. The extreme complexity of Kirfel’s magnum opus might have deterred other sanskritists from following suit. 

The matter was taken up again systematically by Paul Hacker. He pointed out that many of the Purāṇas are, as such, only secondary products, compila tions of ‘Einzelstücke’, or ‘components’, which often had existed independently before being intergrated into the superstructure of a Purāṇa. This led to the maxim: ‘Zunächts ist bei der Untersuchung von Texten der anonymen Literatur auf einzelne, inhaltlich einheitliche Stücke zu achten aus denen die überliefer ten Werke zusammengesezt sind.’ 18 The works that this line of research has brought forth are well-knowṇHowever, the limitation of the method is con tained in the words just quoted: ‘Untersuchung’ and ‘überlieferten Werke’. Evidently, for Hacker and his celās ‘Untersuchung’ did not imply ‘edition’, 19 and ‘überlieferten Werke’ referred in the majority of cases to printed editions of ‘complete’ works. That these limitations could easily give rise to short comings has recently been pointed out by Horst Brinkhaus in a review of A. Gail’s Paraśurāma. Brahmane und Krieger, in which he noticed that the au thor, 

. . . in seiner Monographie immer wieder von den überlieferten Endredaktionen der epischen oder purāṇischen Gesamtabschnitte zu Paraśurāma oder gar der Gesamtwerke als notwendig kohärenten Einheiten aus [geht] und [. . . ] von den Gesamttexten die Funktionen der Einzelstücke ab[leitet]. 20 

The crux of the matter is the concept of the ‘complete Purāṇa’ (‘Gesamtwerk’) or the ‘traditional final redaction’ (‘überlieferte Endredak tion’). In several cases a puranic text is never handed down as a ‘complete’ work at all. Thus, for instance, to the best of my knowledge, there does not exist a ms containing the collection of khaṇḍas that could pass for the complete Skandapurāṇa,21 and Bonazzoli has made it clear that on the basis of the ms evidence it cannot be decided what should be conceived of as the ’complete’ 

noch ein uns nicht erhaltenes Ur-Purāṇa liegen k¨onnte [. . . ] ist kaum mehr als eine willkürliche Annahme, da ausser ein paar sekundären Versen tatsächlich nichts Hand greifliches auf diese M¨oglichkeit hindeutet und wir nur von den realen Grundlagen der Textgeschichte ausgehen dürfen, um hinter das eigentliche Purāṇa–Geheimnis zu kommen.

21 The comprehensive catalogue of ancient mss in the National Archives (Nepal) (Br̥hat sūcīpatram) vol. 8 ‘Purāṇa and Itihāsa’ lists ṣv. ‘Skandapurāṇa’ an incomplete palmleaf ms of 700 verses (or should we read 7000?) comprising 229 folios, which is not assigned to any particular Saṁhitā or Khaṇḍa. It is written in ‘Licchavī’ characters and may hence date from before ad 1000 (information kindly provided by Prof. Dr. ṀWitzel). However, even if a closer examination of this ms would reveal that it contains a part of an integral text that is entitled Skandapurāṇa, the other, in some cases very old mss indexed in the same catalogue prove all the more that from an early date it had become common practice to signify particular texts or compilations as parts of the Skandapurāṇa

Garuḍapurāṇa.22 The texts, or so-called ‘final redactions’, which we are in the habit of referring to as the ‘so-and-so-purāṇa’ more often than not have come into existence only after they rolled off the Ve˙nkateśvara, Vaṅgavāsī, or other 19th and early 20th century presses of India. Even if mss of ‘complete’ Purāṇas exist, these are often to be considered as conflated products. How should we proceed when we want to produce a critical edition of such elusive material? This question was posed by Bonazzoli in an article in 1983 and a brave solution was proposed in a sample-edition of the Garuḍapurāṇa, handed out and discussed at the Sixth World Sanskrit Conference in Philadelphia October 1984. 23 

Alas, apart from problems of lay-out, which are considerable, I think the proposed procedure is unsatisfactory, since no text edited in this new way can lay any claim to authenticity. In fact it is a new creation which could be best designated as a vulgate, and of vulgate editions we have already enough. It is a ‘collectio lectionum’ (op. cit. 2), which, in itself, is of course a useful thing, but it is of doubtful value for historical research. It takes as the standard text the readings ‘that have been accepted by the majority of the mss and editions (op. cit. 4) and presents the variant-readings in sub-lines, on the parallel page, and in a critical apparatus. The decision to abandon the concept of the ‘orig inal’ text is to be welcomed, yet the replacement of a pedigree as the guiding principle by only a single rule, viz. that of the lectio plurium codicum potior, might lead to a phenomenon that the connoisseurs of football may know: the world-team composed of the best players of the globe looks respectable and trustworthy, yet it fails to do the trick, due to the incompatibility of its mem bers. Besides, how can we determine what should still be included? Is there a minimum of mss required for a text-portion to be accepted or will every ms that in its colophon claims to belong to the Garuḍpurāṇa be taken into account? 

It is my conviction that as long as critical editions of puranic literature aim at presenting such artificial compilations as ‘complete Purāṇas’ the results will remain arbitrary. For reasons just mentioned, in the majority of cases recon struction of an archetypal version is out of the question, 24 compilatory editions as now proposed by Bonazzoli seem inadequate to the demands of historical 

(e.g. Ambikākhaṇḍa, Utkalakhaṇḍa, Kāśīkhaṇḍa, Kedārakhaṇḍa), whereas evidently no attempt was made to compile or transcribe a ‘complete’ Skandapurāṇa comprising all (i.e. more than one) parts (khaṇḍas/saṁhitās) (cf. Aufrecht, Catalogus Catalogorum ṣv.). 

The manuscript referred to would become ms S1 of our critical edition of the ‘original’ Skandapurāṇa (see below, p. 185 ff.). 

22 Bonazzoli 1983, 255 ff. 

23 Bonazzoll 1984. 

24 An exception is to be made for some of the early Purāṇas like e.g. the Viṣṇupurāṇa, which shows a homogeneous structure and gives the impression of being composed by a single (group of) author(s). This seems to be borne out by the critical edition of this Purāṇa by ṀṀPathak (Baroda 1997–99). Another instance of a homogeneous original Purāṇa text is the Skandapurāṇa preserved in some early Nepalese mss (see below, p. 185 ff. and the Prolegomena to Skandapurāṇa, SP I. 









research, synoptic editions of all versions and recensions are more often than not practically unrealizable, and also critical editions of only one recension may mostly appear unattainable owing to the fact that what a recension is can only be defined by comparing it with the text-material that deviates or does not belong to it. 25 

The solution I would suggest is to build on the principles of Kirfel and Hacker, that is to start from the basic materials or components out of which the network of puranic literature is built up and to forget about the superstructure of ‘complete’ Purāṇas for the time being. An assessment of a khaṇḍa or Purāṇa as a whole can be made when all its components are critically evaluated. The joint editions of the components can be seen as constituting the critical edition of the whole. 

The proposed method entails the dissolution of the traditional texture of Mahā- and Upapurāṇas, and though the resulting fragmentation might appear confusing on first sight, it could be the only way to disclose the historical struc ture of this type of literature. Study of a component should be accompanied by an edition of it, because only the collation of all related ms evidence can reveal the particular text-tradition of the component. It may appear that the recension included in a certain Purāṇa represents merely one stage of its textual history. A synoptic edition of all recensions pertaining to this tradition may intersect one or more Purāṇas since, as it would seem, many a re-composition remained outside the Smr̥ti compilations. 

The critical edition of the Ayodhyam¯ ah¯ atmya ¯ 

To illustrate the proposal I may adduce my investigation into the history of the holy town of Ayodhyā (Bakker 1986). The starting point of my research was the Ayodhyāmāhātmya (AM) as it occurs in the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa. 

A collation of all available ms material that was somehow related to the AM, among which were texts bearing other titles such as Kośalakhaṇḍa or Ayodhyā khaṇḍa, yielded three different text-groups as well as an epitome. 26 First there is the recension that is found in the printed Skandapurāṇa and that is secured by Dharmanibandha testimony (the ‘Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension’). Then there is a second recension that extends the text-material and re-composes it. In the colophon of some of its mss it claims to belong to the Rudrayāmala, probably the most chimeric of all anonymous literature. 27 The third group contains longer and shorter versions, both having only very few ślokas in common with

the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension though they appear structurally akin to it. The texts pertaining to this group could, on text-critical grounds, be proven to have been meant as a kind of supplement to the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recensioṇThey lost their relevance when the second recension was composed which includes most of the materials of the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension and its supplements. This recension was, again, abridged in an epitome. The relative chronology of the text-groups was established by virtue of text-critical arguments only. In order to avoid a petitio principii, inferences from the texts regarding the historical development of the town were based on this chronology, which was subsequently given an absolute foundation by connecting it with independent evidence. 28 

The three basic text-groups are presented in three parallel columns. Al though this gives a certain amount of duplication and sometimes triplication of the text-material, it seems justified by the fact that a proper assessment of the historical purport of one recension can only be fully grasped by means of a scrupulous comparison with the other versions. It is especially the, often minute, differences between the texts that lend significance to their contents. A problem that this type of editing brings with it is that each composition has its own sequence in which pericopes or chapters are organized. The problem is solved by accepting the sequence of the most comprehensive recension as the standard one, by splitting this text in its textual units, and presenting these along with the parallel versions of the other text-groups. To enable the reader to read the units of a text-group in their original sequence references are given at the beginning and end of each chapter to the page on which the linking text can be found. The original sequence can also be recovered with the help of detailed concordances. 

A close examination of the ms evidence revealed that none of the versions was directly based upon another. They seem to represent three more or less independent re-compositions of a basic stock of text-materials. These com positions were handed down in more than one ms so that a critical edition of each of them could be attained. Comparison of several abrupt transitions and obscure references in the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension with the supplemen tary texts revealed that both must have drawn on the same source and that the Skanda- or Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension actually forms a selection and first redaction of this original pool of text-materials. 29 The latter may have been the Māhātmya as it evolved and was transmitted locally. This was not nec essarily a well-defined text, something that could be called ‘   ’, an archetype in the strict sense. Rather it would have been in a fluid state, modified and supplemented according to changes in local circumstances. Hence I prefered to designate it as an ‘   -type-of-text’. The composer of the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa may 

28 Bakker 1986 I, 125 ff. 

29 Bakker 1986 II, xxvii ff. 









have had access to this pool and have given it definite form. 30 

If, as may well be assumed, the three other regional Māhātmyas contained in the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa appear just as accurate and detailed descriptions of local circumstances as the AM proved to be, it seems impossible that the composer of the khaṇḍa himself created the texts. He might, however, have done the same as the editor of the modern Tīrthāṅk, viz. solliciting local communities to provide him with the basic materials. 31 Presumably the local tradition did not breakdown after it had issued its first acknowledged Smr̥ti product, but continued to generate text-materials which finally resulted in a new composition at the time the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension was felt to be antiquated. Thus the second recension came into being, too late to find recognition in the traditional Smr̥ti literature. It was hoped that the assignment to the Rudrayāmala would do. 

The given scheme of text-evolution confirms the well-known fact that the contents of the components of puranic texts may be considerably older than the respective khaṇḍas or Purāṇas in which they are included. These embry onic components may have evolved and been transmitted in local or religious communities, in the form of a pool of text-materials that we have called ‘   - type-of-text’, to which the Purāṇa composers had recourse. It is only on this level of the textual history of puranic literature that the question of oral versus written tradition becomes significant. Are the texts that were incorporated in a puranic superstructure the first redactions in writing? Was the genetic process of ‘composition-in-transmission’, which no doubt took place by means of writ ing, continuously sustained by small-scale oral traditions? The present state of our knowledge does not allow a general answer to these questions. However, the glimpses of the ‘   -type-of-text’ that we obtained through analysing the ms evidence of the AM showed textual fluidity as well as formularity to such a degree as to make at least the hypothesis that postulates local or religious communities as the oral fountain-heads of puranic literature worthy of further investigation. 

30 The nature of this ‘pool’ and how it evolved into an organized text is the subject of an essay included at the end of this volume (below, pp. 601 ff.). 

31 The composer of the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa may have been active in the 14th century. On the basis of independent evidence, the Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa recension of the AM reflects the historical situation in the 13th century. This tallies with the date given to the Puruṣo ttamakṣetramāhātmya contained in the same khaṇḍa, viz. c. ad 1300 (COJ pp. 36, 54, 170).

Studies in the Skandapurāṇa I 

Introduction 

As has been reported in various international meetings and in Indo-Iranian Journal (IIJ) 37 (1994), 325–331, a team at the University of Groningen (con sisting of R̥Adriaensen, ḤIsaacson and the present author) is currently work ing on the critical edition of the oldest extant text that calls itself Skanda purāṇa. Apart from the passage discussed below there seem to be few textual links between the vulgate Skandapurāṇa and the text we are presently editing. The oldest document on which this edition is based is a Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript dating from ad 810 (our siglum S1). 1 It contains a Skandapurāṇa (further referred to as SP) that does not yet consist of khaṇḍas. Of this text three recensions are knowṇThe oldest recension is the one found in three (incomplete) Nepalese palm-leaf mss (our sigla S1, S2, S3, jointly S). 2 A later recension is found in a ms that in its colophon calls itself the Revākhaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa (our siglum R), but that is entirely different from the printed Revākhaṇḍa.3 The third and probably latest recension is found in mss that in their colophons style themselves as the Ambikākhaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa. Of these we have collected to date four manuscripts (our sigla A1, A2, A3 and A4, jointly A). 4 Our edition aims at reconstructing the S recension as far as possible, while the variants of the R and A recensions will be presented each in a separate register of the critical apparatus. 5 The editio princeps of the SP (abbreviated as SPBh) was prepared by Kr̥ṣṇaprasāda Bhaṭṭarāī and appeared

The wedding of Siva and P ´ arvat ¯ ī 

The aim of the present study is to illustrate the value of our text for the in vestigation of Sanskrit literature and the mythology of Hinduism by discussing a text passage in adhyāya 13. This chapter is concerned with the wedding of Siva and Pārvatī. Four more texts appear to be relevant to this topic; they are ´ discussed below and, together with the passage in SP 13, presented at the end of this article. In the four critical apparatuses I have only given those variant readings that may be significant for the comparison of the texts. For more variae lectiones of the Skandapurāṇa text the reader is referred to adhyāya 13 in SP I. 

The myth of the wedding of Siva and Pārvatī is well known to Indologists ´ from many Sanskrit texts as well as from numerous works of art. 7 It is all the more suprising that the version of this myth that occurs in the printed texts of the Brahmapurāṇa (abbreviated as BrP; in the critical apparatus siglum Bpur), Liṅgapurāṇa (abbreviated as LiP) and the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa of the vulgate Skandapurāṇa (abbreviated as MKh; in the critical apparatus siglum Mkh), in which Pārvatī is allowed to choose her husband in a svayaṁvara, has attracted little attention of researchers of puranic literature and Saiva mythology; at least ´ we have neither found a reference to it in the secondary literature which we have consulted directly, nor in the indices of the unsurpassed Tübingen Epic and Purāṇic Bibliography. The myth of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara is, however, discussed by some historians of Indian art in order to explain images of a 

critical reconstructioṇThis modification does not directly effect the material presented here, but it may be useful to repeat the view expressed in the Prolegomena (SP I, 42). Our aim in the edition has therefore been to establish a readable text based primarily on the early palm-leaf manuscripts. But we have also attempted to go at least to some extent beyond their readings to recover, to the best of our abilities, an earlier form of the text. That such an earlier form existed cannot be called into question, nor, in our view, that one should attempt, with all due caution, to reach it. We have emended (or adopted the reading of one or both other recensions) in cases where the Nepalese manuscripts offer a reading which we had good reason to think the result of, mainly involuntary, transmissional (i.e. scribal) error or variation. 

6 The text of SP 13.28–57 adopted in this article conforms to the one presented in our critical edition of SP 13.28–57, which was published in 1998 (SP I, pp. 192–97). 7 For an elaborate survey the reader may be referred to the MA thesis (1991) of Ms Martina Stoye (Freie Universität Berlin), Die textlichen Grundlagen zu Darstellungen der Hochzeit von Siva und Pārvatī in der indischen Kunst ´ , which is as yet unpublished. 







10 / Pārvatī’s Svayaṁvara 187 

(lying) woman with child. 8 It is this svayaṁvara version of the holy wedding that is found in adhyāya 13 of the SP. In addition to the four texts mentioned, a cryptic passage in the Droṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata appears also to be of relevance, although it does not at first sight deal with Pārvatī’s ‘self-choice’. 

Siva’s exclusion from the sacrifice ´ 

We may start our investigation by having a closer look at this chapter (173) of the DroṇaparvaṇAfter the death of Droṇa and the shattering of the Kauravas, Arjuna asks Vyāsa who was the man with the lance who marched in front of him and caused such havock on the battle field. Vyāsa answers that Arjuna had seen Sam ´ . kara; Vyāsa reveals Siva’s nature in a famous eulogy, in which, among ´ other things, reference is made to his retaliation against the gods when he is not allowed his share in the sacrifice (MBh 7.173.37–51). Then Vyāsa broaches another subject. He tells how the gods asked Siva to break the power of the ´ three cities of the asuras and how Siva accomplished this by one three-pronged ´ arrow when an auspicious (astronomical) conjunction of the three heavenly cities had occurred (MBh 7.173.52–58). The next śloka makes a very harsh transitioṇApparently without any connection with the fore-going the text proceeds, 

After herself placing the little child with five tufts of hair on her lap, Umā, as she wished to know (who he was), asked the gods ‘who is this?’ (MBh 7.173.59) 9 

This verse is directly followed by another one, not less bewildering in its abrupt ness. 

The lord immobilized the arm of the infuriated Sakra that held the ´ vajra; this bountiful god, lord and ruler of the entire universe. (MBh 7.173.60) 

Two themes are juxtaposed here which, on first sight, seem to have very little to do with one another: (1) Siva’s transformation into a little child and (2) ´ his immobilisation of Indra who, it would seem, leads the gods in an act of aggresioṇThe origin of both themes can be traced back to the Brāhmaṇa literature and a short survey of their evolution may help to clarify the text. 

Discussing the function of the brahm´an priest, the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa teaches: 

Then, when the gods thereupon performed the sacrifice, they put the fore-portion (prāśitra) aside for Savitr.; it cleft his hands. They restored to him two golden 

8 My attention was drawn to this by the MA thesis of Ms Britta Zehmke (Freie Universität Berlin), published in 1994: Die liegende Frau mit Kind in der indischen Steinplastik. Zehmke refers to the work of Bhattasali 1929, Sanyal 1935, U. Agrawala 1964 and ṇP. Joshi 1989. These publications were not available to me. Zehmke’s investigation, how ever, makes it clear that the motif of the ‘lying woman with child’ can hardly have anything to do with Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara. 

9 The text of the critical edition is probably corrupt here. Below I will discuss another reading. The oddity of the passage was noted by Scheuer 1982, 289 f. 









(hands). Therefore he is celebrated as ‘the one with golden hands’. They put it aside for Bhaga; it gouged out his eyes. Therefore they say ‘Bhaga is blind’. They put it aside for Pūṣan; it knocked out his teeth. Therefore they say ‘Pūṣan is without teeth, gruel is his share’. These gods said, ‘Indra is the most powerful, the strongest of the gods; put it aside for him’. They put it aside for him. He appeased it with (his) holy power (brahman). Therefore one says, ‘the brahman is Indra’. 10 

The same theme is found in the Satapathabrāhman ´ . a with some significant changes. Here ‘the god who rules the animals’ (y`o ’y´aṁdev´aḥpaśūnā´m īś.ṭe, SBr 1.6.2.3), i.e. Rudra, is asked by the gods to pierce Prajāpati, who is the ´ sacrifice, because he had abused his daughter. 11 Rudra pierces him with the lance (śaly´a). When the lance is torn out again, the gods offer that portion of Prajāpati, i.e. of the sacrifice, that has come out with the lance—that is the fore-portion of the sacrifice (prāśitr´a), intended for the brahm´an priest—to Bhaga etc.: 

Bhaga looked at it; it burnt his eyes. And so indeed it happened. Therefore they say ‘Bhaga is blind’. They said, ‘it has not yet become appeased here, put it aside for Pūṣan’. They put it aside for PūṣaṇPūṣan ate from it; it knocked out his teeth. And so indeed it happened. Therefore they say, ‘Pūṣan is without teeth’. Therefore they prepare the rice pudding (car´u) that they make for Pūṣan from ground rice, just as for a person without teeth. 12 

Br̥haspati next passes it on to Savitr̥who appeases it. 

What is the fore-portion (prāśitr´a), that is originally this. When he cuts off the fore-portion, he metes out exactly that part of the sacrifice that has been pierced, that belonges to Rudra. 13 

10 Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.8.8–6.9.4: 

atha yatra ha tad devā yajñam atanvata | 8 | tad savitre prāśitraṁparijahruḥ| 9 | ta sya pāṇī praciccheda | 10 | tasmai hiraṇmayau pratidadhuḥ| 11 | tasmād dhiraṇyapāṇir iti stutaḥ| 12 | tad bhagāya parijahruḥ| 13 | tasyākṣiṇī nirjaghāna | 14 | tasmād āhur andho bhaga iti | 15 | tat pūṣṇe parijahruḥ| 16 | tasya dantān parovāpa | 17 | tasmād āhur adantakaḥpūṣā karambhabhāga iti | 18 | te devā ūcuḥ| 19 | indro vai devānām ojiṣṭho baliṣṭhas tasmā etat pariharateti | 1 | tat tasmai parijahruḥ| 2 | tat sa brahmaṇā śamayāṁcakāra | 3 | tasmād āhendro brahmeti | 4 | 

11 Rudra himself is the issue of this abuse, see Kaus.Br 6.1 (below p. 190). He avenges the incest by piercing his begetter, Prajāpati, i.e. the sacrifice (Deppert 1977, 267 f.). 12 SBr 1.6.2.6–7: ´

10 / Pārvatī’s Svayaṁvara 189 

Thus Rudra partly takes over Indra’s position as the god to whom this dan gerous first portion of the sacrificial offering belongs; unlike Indra, however, he does not ‘appease’ it (this function is taken over by Savitr.), but, on the con trary, he is seen as the cause of the mutilation of the sacrifice and consequently of the gods. 

The theme returns in the Sauptikaparvan 18 of the Mahābhārata, where it is connected with Siva’s exclusion from the sacrifice in general. ´ 14 When the gods have divided among themselves their share (bhāga) in the sacrifice, Rudra seizes his bow, and runs towards them. Cosmic phenomena come to a halt. Sacrifice (yajña) is shot in the heart while fleeing to heaven in the form of an antelope (mr̥ga). 15 The gods are baffled. 

The infuriated Tryambaka cut off (vyaśātayat) the arms of Savitr., (and knocked out) the eyes of Bhaga and the teeth of Pūṣan with the point of his bow (dhanuṣkoṭi). Then the gods and aṅgas of the sacrifice ran away all together; some rolled about on that very spot and became as if they breathed their last. But after he had put that entire (assembly) to the rout, Sitikan ´ .ṭha laughed, arrested the point of the bow and halted the gods. Thereupon the cry (vāc) uttered by the immortals snapped the string of his bow and, due to the shock, O king, the bow, its string broken, quivered. Thereupon the gods along with sacrifice approached the foremost of the gods, who was without bow (now), and took refuge; and the lord showed compassion. 16 

Chapter 32 of the SP, followed by i.a. the Liṅga- and Sivapurān ´ . as, applies the theme to the description of Siva’s exclusion from Daks ´ .a’s sacrifice. Here Indra and Viṣṇu are added to the group of explicitly mentioned gods that fall victim to the anger of Siva, in this case represented by his factotum Haribhadra. The ´ arms raising their weapons are immobilized (stambhana), just as the other inhabitants of heaven are said to be transfixed. 

And Haribhadra, inflamed and without dismay, immobilized Sakra’s hand when he ´ raised (it); and likewise (he immobilized the hands) of the other gods. (And) before (their) eyes he, with anger on his face, knocked out Bhaga’s eyes and Pūṣan’s teeth, striking with the point of (his) bow. And without dismay he immobilized that dreadful discus of Viṣṇu, which shone like the apocalyptic sun, and it, (remaining) in his hand, did not move (forth). 17 

So much for Siva’s mutilation of the gods. ´

Siva as the cosmic child ´ 

The origin of the other theme, viz. Siva’s transformation into a little child, ´ can also be traced back to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, in which Prajāpati begets a (grand)son through his four sons and daughter Uṣas (Kaus.Br 6.1–3). This infant (?), ‘of a thousand eyes, of a thousand feet, with a thousand fitted (arrows on his bow)’, 18 asks his (grand)father to bestow upon him eight names. 19 

A new version of this myth is found in the Purāṇapañcalakṣaṇa,20 which tells that at the dawn of creation, in the first kalpa, Mahādeva Rudra engendered a son in his own likeness (ātmanas tulyaṁsutam). This little ‘blue-red’ boy (kumāro nīlalohitah.) appeared in the lap of Brahmā and cried (ruroda) terribly (ghoram). He asked Brahmā to give him a name, and Brahmā names him Rudra. The child kept crying until altogether eight names—the same as given to Prajāpati’s son in the Kauṣītaki and Satapatha Brāhman ´ . as—were given to him, the final one being Mahādeva. Thereupon the ‘blue-red’ boy requested Brahmā to bestow a domain (sthāna) or body (tanu) to each name, which resulted in the following combinations: Rudra obtained the sun, Bhava the waters, Sarva ´ earth, Īśāna wind, Paśupati fire, Bhīma ākāśa, Ugra the initiated brahmin, and Mahādeva the mooṇIn this way the divine, primordial child in Brahmā’s lap was made to personify Siva’s cosmic dimension, his eight embodiments ( ´ aṣṭa mūrti), encompassing the entire phenomenal universe. 

When we return to the two verses in the Droṇaparvan, we may observe that it is probably this primordial, cosmic child that sits in Umā’s lap (MBh 7.173.59); his five tufts of hair (pañcaśikha) may symbolize his embodiment of the five elements that build the material world. 

This being so, one may rightly ask what, if any, is the function of the ap pearance of the cosmic child in Pārvatī’s lap at this junction of Tripura’s de 

18 Kaus.Br 6.1.13–14: tata udatiṣṭhat sahasrākṣaḥsahasrapāt | 13 | sahasreṇa pratihitā bhiḥ| 14 | Udaya comments: sahasreṇa sahasrasaṁkhyābhir dhanuṣi pratihitābhiḥsam. - hitābhir iṣubhir upalakṣitaḥ| 

19 This incestuous son of Prajāpati is ‘this great god possessed of eight names, who is com posed of eight folds’ (Kaus.Br 6.3.49–50: sa eṣo ’ṣṭanāmā | 49 | aṣṭadhā vihito mahān de vaḥ| 50 |), i.e. Mahādeva/Rudra, whose eight forms (aṣṭamūrti) are described in Kaus.Br 6.2–3 (cf. SBr 6.1.3.8–18). Apparently, the 6th ´ adhyāya of the Kaus.Br does not make a connection between this myth of the birth of Rudra (6.1–3) and the second section (6.4–11) dealing mainly with the function of the brahm´an priest, in which context the myth of the sacrifice of the gods and their injury by the prāśitra is described (see above, p. 187). 

The underlying connection, however, becomes clear when the SBr version is taken into ´ consideratioṇIt is Rudra, the son of Prajāpati, i.e. the sacrifice, who procures (and is) the first issue of the sacrifice, the ‘fore-portion’, or, in the words of the Brāhmaṇa, ‘[the portion] that belongs to Rudra’ (rudr´ıya) (SBr 1.6.2.9). The underlying identity ´ seems to be that Rudra, son of Prajāpati’s seed, is the first issue (prāśitra) of Prajāpati’s (self-)sacrifice. If we keep this identity in mind the relevance of the statement (Kaus.Br 6.10.7–8) that introduces the concluding part of adhyāya 6 of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa becomes clear: ‘Prajāpati once emitted the sacrifice; he emitted seed by installing the sacrificial fire’ (prajāpatir ha yajñaṁsasr̥je | 7 | so ’gnyādheyenaiva reto ’sr̥jata | 8 |).

struction? And why do the infatuated gods, represented by Sakra, to whose ´ rescue Siva had just come and to whose wish, viz. the destruction of the triple ´ city of the asuras, Siva had just complied, why do these gods try immediately ´ to kill their benefactor, from which evil they are only kept by the child’s magic powers (MBh 7.173.60)? Even if we accept, as we are supposed to do, that the gods were struck by blindness (MBh 7.173.61), it is hard to see why the sight of Umā with a child on her lap immediately provoked such aggresion, exactly at the moment that the world is rescued from a demonic threat. And what is she doing there anyway? 21 And how is it possible that Umā herself, mother of the world, apparently does not recognize the child? Brahmā is the only one who recognizes Siva and bows for him (MBh 7.173.62), whereupon ´ Siva undoes ´ his spell (MBh 7.173.63). 

Evidently we are concerned with a conflation of at least three myths—Siva’s ´ destruction of Tripura, his appearence as the cosmic child, and the gods’ as sault on him and their subsequent immobilisation—which, since they are all concerned with Siva’s majestic powers, were somehow, rather awkwardly, com- ´ bined in the Mahābhārata text, making the latter prone to further involuntary corruption. 

Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara 

The relevance, alluded to earlier, of the svayaṁvara myth in SP 13 for the exegesis of the MBh passage at issue becomes evident when we study this myth in more detail. The events leading to the svayaṁvara in SP 13 are told in SP 12. In short the story is as follows. 

In SP 12.1–20 Brahmā prophesies that Pārvatī (Umā) will obtain a husband of her choice when she stops practising tapas. Pārvatī ceases her tapas and resorts to the aśoka tree that has grown at the entrance of her dwelling. Hara (Siva) approaches ´ her in the form of an ugly dwarf, who announces that he wishes to marry her. Thanks to her yogic powers Pārvatī perceives that Sam ´ . kara has come to her and says that he should ask her father. Siva, still in disguise, asks Himavat for the hand ´ of his daughter, but Himavat, recognizing Rudra, becomes uneasy and foolishly, due to a curse, declares that he already intended to hold a svayaṁvara for his daughter. 

Siva returns to Pārvatī, tells her about her father’s intention and is about to take ´ his leave, when Pārvatī assures him not to despair, since she will choose him. If he has any doubt, she will choose him right there. Pārvatī plucks a flowering branch from the aśoka tree and laying it on his shoulder says ‘you have been chosen by me’. 22 

21 Nīlakaṇṭha’s commentary (MBhB) does not really help: teṣu ca vardhamāneṣu rudro bālavad rāgadveṣaśūnyo brahmavidyāparanāmnyā umāyā vaśago bhavitīty etad atra pra darśyate | 22 SP 12.21–63 continues with several other things, among which another myth in which Siva puts Pārvatī to the test. He assumes the form of a crocodile who has seized a child. ´ Pārvatī liberates the child by giving her tapas away to the crocodile, who reveals his true nature. 









In SP 13.1-27 Himavat, though aware of the engagement of his daughter with Devadeva, proceeds to organize the svayaṁvara, considering that, after all, it would bring him most honour if Parameśāna would be chosen in front of all the gods. The latter, headed by Indra, assemble in the house of Himavat. Pārvatī enters the arena in a vimāna and takes a garland of flowers to place at the feet of the man of her choice (SP 13.28). At that very moment, in order to test his bride to be (devyā jijñāsayā), Siva assumes the form of a child in her lap (SP 13.29). Due to ´ her yogic powers she recognizes the god to whom she had pledged her word and is pleased (SP 13.30–31). 

When the gods, however, see the maiden of the wedding contest with a child in her lap they, understandably enough, are bewildered, fly into passion and try to attack him (SP 13.32). Siva repels the assault by immobilizing and mutilating ´ the offenders (SP 13.33–38). Brahmā is the only god who sees through Siva’s ´ disguise, and he informs the other gods about their mistake (SP 13.39–50). The gods take refuge with Siva (SP 13.51). ´ Siva is pleased and lifts the spell (SP 13.52). ´ He assumes his supreme form, seen by the gods only after receiving a divine eye (SP 13.53–54), and is elected by Pārvatī as her husband (SP 13.56), after which the wedding is celebrated. The cosmic order, sealed by Siva’s and Pārvatī’s holy ´ wedlock, is confirmed. 

It is clear that the SP story of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara combines the two mytholog ical themes at issue, viz. (1) Siva’s taking the form of a little child (in Pārvatī’s ´ lap), and (2) Siva’s immobilisation/mutilation of the gods, though now applied ´ in a situation in which revenge of the incest or exclusion from the sacrifice is no longer the direct cause of his anger. In contrast with the Mahābhārata text, however, the encompassing myth of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara unites these two themes into a new, meaningful and logical whole. Pārvatī stands the test, as one would expect, and does not need to ask who the child is; the ignorant gods, however, go astray. Not recognizing Siva, they are embarassed by the ´ child’s presence at the svayaṁvara. They become angry and consequently are immobilized/mutilated. When their delusion is removed by Brahmā, they have no choice but to recognize Siva’s superiority and to accept that he is Pārvatī’s ´ choice. In this way the Saiva cosmic order proved to be superior to the ancient ´ world represented by the Vedic gods. The latter were crippled and, to bring out the contrast—and this distinguishes the epic and puranic versions from those of the Brāhmaṇas—this was effected by the supreme lord in the form of a newly born child. 

The Brahmapurāṇa, Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa tell basically the same myth as SP 13. In the Brahmapurāṇa the svayaṁvara episode forms part of the ‘story of Umā and Sam ´ . kara’ (umāśaṁkarayoḥpuṇyāṁkathām, BrP 34.55), which the Brahmapurāṇa has taken over from the SP in its entirety. The Brahmapurāṇa follows the text of the SP rather closely, showing only mi nor variants—often adaptation due to the fact that Brahmā has supplanted Sanatkumāra as the narrator—in addition to occasional omissions and corrup tions. From the latter it is clear that the Brahmapurāṇa is the borrower, the SP the ‘original’. The borrowed chapters in the Brahmapurāṇa, viz. 34.56 to 







10 / Pārvatī’s Svayaṁvara 193 

38.12 (= SP 11.1 to 15.12) fit neatly in between the preceding passage borrowed from the Sāmbapurāṇa (BrP 29–33) and the succeeding passage borrowed from the Mahābhārata and Vāyupurāṇa (BrP 39–40). 23 

The situation is somewhat different in the case of the Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa. These two texts show a greater distance to the SP, having numerous ommisions, additions and transpositions, whereas they are marred by textual corruptions, due to which the story has become more difficult to follow, especially in the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa. A comparison with the SP may help to restore its meaning. It ensues from a collation that the Liṅgapurāṇa is closer to the SP and that the text of the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa goes back to an original that must have been related to the text as found in the Liṅgapurāṇa. 

No such close correspondence is found between the MBh and SP, but there are some indications that, at the time the MBh passage at issue was composed, the myth of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara was not wholly unknowṇIt might actually have been the source whence the diaskeuast derived both themes, namely Siva ´ (Rudra) as a child and the injury of the gods, unified by Pārvatī’s pivot role. 24 These may have been lifted out of their context and incorporated in the eulogy of Rudra to illustrate his greatness. With the destruction of Tripura they evidently lack any intrinsic relation. 

The synoptic edition of the Svayaṁvara myth 

To facilitate a comparison I have presented the five text traditions in four parallel columns. The Brahmapurāṇa version is not given a column of its own; 

23 See the Appendices 4 and 5 of the edition of Schreiner and S¨ohneṇThough it has been known since long that the ‘Brahma◦, as presently edited, is nothing more than a loose “conglomeration of portions belonging to different periods and written by different hands”’ (Rocher 1986, 155), until now the source of the chapters 34 to 38 had not been identified. I am grateful to Mss Zehmke and Stoye (see above, n. 8 on p. 187 and n. 7 on p. 186), whose MA theses drew my attention to this BrP passage. 

While I was preparing this article for the press, it was brought to my notice that at least fragments of the (original) Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Lakṣmīdhara are found in a manu script in the Jammu & Kashmir Government Research Library (Srinagar, MṢNo. 1346), the title of which is written as ā. pu, taken to mean Adipurāṅa. On the cover of this fragment the title Mārtāṇḍamāhātmya has been written in another hand. The frag ment itself is without colophoṇThe text has been edited by Yasuke Ikari & Takao Hayashi (1994), who also give a concordance with the corresponding passages in the Kr̥tyakalpataru and Kr̥tyaratnākara where the text is quoted as Brahmapurāṇa. The same fragment corresponds partly with the text of the Nīlamatapurāṇa. 

24 The connection between (the child) Rudra and the mutilation of the gods is not com pletely new, since it underlies the myth of Prajāpati’s (self-)sacrifice and Rudra’s birth (see n. 19 on p. 190). Though the two myths are structurally akin, the trait-d’union between both themes changes from the sacrifice, i.e. Prajāpati, in the Brāhmaṇas to Pārvatī in the epic and Purāṇas. 









its variant readings are given in the critical apparatus ad the text of SP. 25 The text of MBh 7.173 actually recurs in MBh 13.145; the major variant readings of the reprise have been given in the apparatus (the sigla are those of the Critical Edition). The text of SP is basically a reconstruction of the S recension (cf. above, n. 5 on p. 185), though it should be taken into account that for the passage at issue only S2 is available. The sequence of ślokas in the Liṅgapurāṇa and the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa of the Veṅkaṭeśvara (and Vaṅgavāsī) Press editions has been adapted to the SP and this already yields a slight improvement of the story line. 26 Significant variant readings of the Vaṅgavāsī editions of the Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa have been either accepted in the text or presented in the apparatus. 27 

When we turn our attention again to MBh 173 verse 59 we see in the appa ratus that a part of the Southern Recension inserts before this verse a signifi cant hemistich: ‘Listen to another event, O Dhanaṁjaya, (which happened) at Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara.’ The insertion of this hemistich may have been prompted by the harsh transition from the Tripura battle scene to Siva’s transformation ´ into a child. Since this hemistich is only found in the Telugu and some of the Grantha mss, it may be secondary and not have formed part of the original MBh text, but, all the same, it could represent a reminiscence of the original context to which the myth told in the following verses might have belonged. 

Another significant variant is found ad 59c. This reading, although the edi tors of the Critical Edition have relegated it to the apparatus, is supported by a substantial part of the northern and southern mss as well as by some of the mss at MBh 13.145.30c, and would correspond much better with the story as told in SP. According to this reading Siva changes into a little child ‘to test ´ Umā’ (umāṁjijñāsamāno, subject Siva), corresponding to SP 29a (BrP 36.28a) ´ 

25 If one of the variant readings of the BrP text that are presented in Schreiner and S¨ohnen’s edition corresponds with SP, the other readings are ignored. Occasionally, if these variant readings resemble the SP reading, they are also given in the apparatus with siglum Bpur*. 

26 Occasionally the Veṅkaṭeśvara edition of the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa gives a variant reading— i(tarah. ) pā(ṭhah. )—which is noted in the apparatus. The commentary of Gaṇeśa Nātu in the Veṅkaṭeśvara edition of the LiP has also been presented in the apparatus. 

27 One may recall Friedhelm Hardy’s dictum (Hardy 1983a, 592) to the effect that ‘any analysis solely based on one printed edition of a Purāṇa will be onesided or even dis torted’. It would be better still, and generally of greater significance (as too often the printed editions apear to be related to one another), to consult the mss of the Purāṇa at issue. It is obvious that here practical considerations impose a limit. I am very grateful to my colleague ḤIsaacson for having taken the trouble to look at a ms of the Liṅga purāṇa in the Bodleian Library (MS Wilson 100). According to Isaacson ‘this ms does not look very old and has a large number of mistakes, but very strikingly it agrees in some places more closely with the SP than the printed Liṅgapurāṇa does’. The significant variants are given in the apparatus of Liṅgapurāṇa with siglum ‘MSBodl’. The variant readings of another Liṅgapurāṇa ms in the National Archives of Nepal (No. 6/3393) dated NS 837 (= ad 1717), available on a microfilm of the Nepal–German Manuscript Preservation Project in Berlin (reel A 1392/6), are also presented in the apparatus with siglum ‘MSNep’ (it concerns the folios 195v to 196v). I am grateful to Prof. Dr A. Wezler, through whose kind offices this microfilm was placed at my disposal.

devyā jijñāsayā (‘in order to test the Goddess’), which has a greater intrinsic probability than Umā openly acknowledging her ignorance: umā jijñāsamānā. The editors of the MBh may have been tempted into accepting this, probably corrupt version of 59c in the critical text on account of the fact that the MBh text as we have it does not explicitly state that Umā stands the test and rec ognizes Siva and because ´ Siva as the subject of ´ abravīt in 59d seems rather odd as we would expect ko ’ham iti. However, also the reading of 59d is far from certaiṇThat Umā’s knowledge of the child’s true nature was (originally) taken as understood may be deduced not only from the fact that the gods altogether ignore her question, but also from the fact that only they manifest their igno rance in the story that follows (MBh 7.173.61). 28 And neither does Brahmā, who knows the truth, inform Umā; on the contrary, Umā, together with Siva, ´ is the object of veneration in verse 63, directly after Brahmā’s discovery in verse 62. The conclusion seems inevitable that v. 59 as a whole is corrupt be yond reliable restoration and a wavy line under the entire verse in the edition would not have been superfluous. The (later) Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvara khaṇḍa have replaced the (probably) original feature of ‘Umā’s trial’ by the traditional platitude that it is just Siva’s game ( ´ krīḍārtham, LiP 1.102.28d, MKh 2.25.100d). 

Due to textual corruption MKh 101–102 has become difficult to understand, which may have led the pandits of the Veṅkaṭeśvara Press to their note given in the apparatus ad 100cd–101. The tasya in MKh 102b and tasyā in LiP 29d lack an obvious antecedent (SP reads devyā). The two pādas MKh 101cd make the impression of an interpolation, the connection of which with the immediate context is difficult to determine. The relevance of the word jaya is obscure and may point to another context, perhaps the exegetical tradition concerning the famous verse that opens the Mahābhārata and, for instance, the Māheśvara khaṇḍa.29 

In SP 34–38 (BrP 36.33–36ab), LiP 31–39 and MKh 104–110 (missing in MBh) the theme of the mutilation of the gods is worked out, adding to the immobilized Indra other victims such as Bhaga (not in LiP) and Pūṣan (not in BrP), known as such already from the Brāhmaṇa literature. A very striking elaboration is presented in SP 36, which is without parallel in the Māheśvara khaṇḍa and significantly different in Liṅgapurāṇa, whereas BrP (36.36cd) has omitted the second remarkable hemistich (SP 36cd). The deluded Viṣṇu angrily shakes his head, whereupon Siva makes his hair fall out. I have not succeeded ´ in finding any reference to Viṣṇu’s baldness in Sanskrit literature and we may have here an idiosyncrasy of the ancient Skandapurāṇa text. 30 That this ex 

28 Significant may be also that Pārvatī takes the child on to her lap (59ab), but the reading of the entire verse 59 is uncertain. 

29 nārāyaṇaṁnamaskr̥tya naraṁcaiva narottamam | devīṁsarasvatīṁcaiva tato jayam udīrayet k 

30 Note the hymn in praise of Siva after his wedding, which is borrowed by the ´ Brahma purāṇa, and in which obeisance is paid to Siva as ´ kr̥ṣṇakeśāpahāriṇe—clearly a reference 







treme Saivism was hard to swallow for later redactors of the text may follow not only from the adaptation in the Liṅgapurāṇa, where Viṣṇu’s head is immo bilized instead of made bald, and the omission of this verse or half of it in the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa and in the Brahmapurāṇa, but also from the interpolations in the R and A recensions of SP ad 39ab (only in R) and ad 50cd, 31 in which Viṣṇu’s role is mitigated when it is said, that Nārāyaṇa has known from the start that it was Siva who fooled the gods. ´ 32 

Then in MBh 62, SP 39–40 (BrP 36.36cd–39ab), LiP 40–41 and MKh 111– 112ab Brahmā sees what Siva’s game is and starts praising him. Of the five ´ ślokas that follow in SP 41–45 (BrP 36.39cd–44ab) and LiP 42cd–47, in which Brahmā reveals Siva’s true nature and coaxes him into undoing his spell, the ´ MKh has retained only one (112cd–113ab), while the Northern Recension of the MBh includes three different, though appropriate verses after 62, relegated to the apparatus by the editors. The effect of this is that according to the text of the Critical Edition the gods never are informed about the true nature of the child, which again makes it unlikely that, in spite of that, they suddenly are able to satisfy (prasādayāmāsur) Umā and Rudra in v. 63. 

The next passage, SP 46–47 (BrP 36.44cd–45) and LiP 48–49, has also been transmitted incompletely in the MKh (113cd–114). The equivalent of SP 46 and LiP 48, in which Brahmā turns to the gods, has been omitted, as a re sult of which the text has become unintelligible as it is no longer clear who are addressed. The corruption may have had its starting point, however, in the alternative sandhi mūḍhā stha for mūḍhāḥstha (SP 13.47a), which we find in the SP manuscript S2 and the Veṅkaṭeśvara edition of Liṅgapurāṇa. Al though Kātyāyana ad Pāṇini 8.3.36 allows the elision of the final s before a sibilant followed by a voiceless occlusive and this practice is found regularly in manuscripts, 33 the loss of the hiatus between mūḍhā and stha in handwriting (reflected in the Veṅkaṭeśvara edition of the Liṅgapurāṇa) may have caused that the verbal second plural indicative (‘you are fools’) was no longer under stood, which gave rise to the nominal mūḍhās tu (A1, A3) and mūḍhāś ca in 

to the episode under the discussion, since the same verse praises him also as puṣṇo danta harāya and bhaganetranipātāya (SP 14.9 = BrP 37.9). In SP 32.116 Devī is praised as viṣṇukeśāpahartrī. The SP apparently refers again to Viṣṇu’s baldness when it praises Siva as ´ śipiviṣṭakr̥te viṣṇor. About the term śipiviṣṭa we remarked in the annotation ad loc. (SP II B, 45): 

The surprising fate of Viṣṇu is actually modelled on a Vedic reference, as in the case of Bhaga and Pūṣan, though in this case the reference is a much more dubious one. It appears that one interpretation of the obscure Vedic epithet Sipivis ´ .ṭa—applied to Viṣṇu in R̥V 7.99.7 and especially R̥V 7.100.5–7—understands the word as meaning ‘bald’. 

For references to alternative interpretations of the Vedic word see our annotation ad SP 32.55. 

31 See also SP I, 303 f. App. 2. 

32 This uprating of Viṣṇu’s position is consistently found throughout the R and A recensions.

10 / Pārvatī’s Svayaṁvara 197 

BrP and MKh. The vocative devatāḥin SP was accordingly interpreted as a nominative and the nominative plural masculine of the subject, sarve (‘you all’), was taken as attributive to devatāḥand adjusted to a nominative plural feminine, sarvās (‘all the deities’) in BrP, LiP and MKh. 

In short, the transcriptive and intrinsic probability of the corruptions point to successive stages, of which the MKh represents the last. Thanks to the SP we are now in the position to understand what the BrP, LiP and MKh were supposed to convey. 

SP 48–49 show the acquaintance of Brahmā (and the authors of the ancient Skandapurāṇa) with the symbolic meaning of the child as the embodiment of Siva’s cosmic dimension, which meaning is now revealed to the Vedic gods. In ´ addition to epithets such as kapardimat, ātman, aja etc., we encounter seven of the eight names of the aṣṭamūrti; only Bhava appears to be missing or may be considered to be replaced by another name such as Sam ´ . kara or De vadeva. This revelation of the child’s eightfold nature has become lost in the course of transmission as the omission of these two verses in BrP, LiP and MKh attests. The absence of the child’s qualification as pañcaśikha in LiP 28d and MKh 100d should probably be viewed in the same light. At the instance of Brahmā the still petrified gods turn their minds towards Sarva ( ´ praṇemur manasā śarvam. ,34 whereas a minor textual inconsequence in the MKh permits them to bow (praṇatāh.) at that as well (MKh 115ab). The Māheśvarakhaṇḍa then inserts a stotra, in which the gods apologize for their behaviour (MKh 115cd–121ab), which does not occur in the other versions and therefore may be considered an accretion. 

In MBh 63, SP 52 (BrP 36.48), LiP 53 and MKh 121cd–122ab the texts converge again: the satisfied Siva restores the gods to their normal condition. ´ With this ends the episode in the MBh, which continues with its eulogy of Rudra. 

The SP, BrP, LiP and MKh continue their story of Umā’s svayaṁvara. The MKh inserted 5 ślokas (122cd–127ab) in which the daityas in their turn express their ignorance. By pronouncing the bīja hum. Siva drives them back to their ´ own city where they forget about the svayaṁvara, a fate that, unfortunately, did not remain restricted to that city and its inhabitants. 

In the following verses the great god drops his disguise and manifests him self in his supreme body (vapus), which can only be seen by the gods after having received a supreme eye. It is noteworthy that according to the Liṅga purāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa versions also the Goddess (Bhavānī) needs such an eye, 35 whereas in SP 13.54 (BrP 36.50cd–51ab)—consistent with SP 13.30 (BrP 36.29), which verse has no parallel in LiP and MKh—she evidently pos sesses this capacity (by virtue of her yogic powers). Yet, the superiority of the Goddess over the gods is acknowledged in the Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvara 

34 SP 51, BrP 36.47, LiP 52. 

35 LiP 1.102.57b, MKh 2.25.130d. 









khaṇḍa versions as well, when in these two texts ‘Brahmā and so forth’ are said to bow before Siva as well as before the Goddess. ´ 36 

In SP 56 (BrP 36.52cd–53ab), LiP 61cd–62ab and MKh 134cd–135ab Devī finally chooses Siva as her husband by placing the wreath at his feet. In the ´ next verse(s) the gods express approval by exclaiming ‘hail, hail!’ The words saha devyā in LiP 63a (MKh 136a) could be construed with sarve devāḥin 63c (MKh 136c), which would imply that the Goddess is herself honouring instead of being honoured as is the case in SP 57. Apart from the fact that the Sanskrit construction is rather cumbersome, this does not fit the situation, all the less so, since taking saha devyā with the subject of namaścakruḥwould normally entail that the Goddess is also part of the subject of saṁprocya in LiP 62c and MKh 135c, which, however, is undesirable as it is totally inappropriate. If, on the other hand, we take saha devyā with the object clause LiP 62d, MKh 135d, this would also result in an awkward construction (tayā along with saha devyā). 37 

In a nutshell, the reformulation and elaboration of the final verses in LiP and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa is rather unfortunate and illustrates once more the value of the critically edited Skandapurāṇa (SP) for the understanding of these two vulgate Purāṇa texts. 

Conclusion 

Summarizing, we may say that the corruptions and elaborations in the second part of the text which is without counterpart in the MBh confirm the tentative conclusion reached above, viz. that the Māheśvarakhaṇḍa represents a later version of the myth as told in LiP, whereas the wording of the latter devi ates again from the text as preserved in the ancient Skandapurāṇa, without improving upon it, however, in any respect. On the contrary, the collation clearly shows that the corresponding text portions of the Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa successively derived from an archetype that represented a corrupted version of SP. The Brahmapurāṇa version of the myth is an inde pendent copy of the SP text, which does not seem to have a direct connection with the archetype from which the Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa derived. Corruptions and omissions show the dependency of the Brahmapurāṇa on SP 

36 LiP 1.102.58cd, MKh 2.25.134ab; the reading of BrP 36.52a, MSNep and MKh 134a, menire, looks like a corruption (metathesis) of the text as found in SP and LiP, whereas the reading of LiP 58d seems a corruption of the reading as found in MKh 134b, possibly caused by LiP’s transposition of this hemistich. Our placing of this hemistich after 61ab, however, does not solve the problem (note that MSNep reads digīśvarāḥto avoid the awkwardness). LiP 61c has preserved the no doubt correct reading hr̥ṣṭā of SP 56a, while MKh reads dr̥ṣṭvā (134c), echoing the mistaken conception underlying LiP and MKh, viz. that the Goddess has only just now, after receipt of a supreme eye, seen her future spouse. 

37 The commentary of Gaṇeśa Nātu is equally ambiguous on this point, although it seems most natural to me that he construes saha devyā with the subject. The daṇḍa after śirobhiḥis misplaced anyway. 







10 / Pārvatī’s Svayaṁvara 199 

and not vice versa. The textual distortions that the Brahmapurāṇa has in common with the Liṅgapurāṇa and Māheśvarakhaṇḍa, notably in the passages SP 35–38 and SP 48–49, seem to point to a slightly altered version of the S recension of SP that is not, or only partly represented in our ms material. 

The wording of the SP, in its turn, does not show direct dependency on the MBh, but nevertheless elucidates it considerably, since it preserved the context from which the verses in the MBh may have been borrowed. We thus have stumbled upon a layer in the process of composition of the Mahābhārata that has been transmitted incompletely—and consequently incomprehensibly—in the ms tradition of the epic. One explanation of this phenomenon could be that in the course of this ms transmission, at an early stage, for one reason or another, a significant text passage had been lost and that only the Telugu and Grantha traditions preserved a vestige thereof. However, the hemistich devyāḥsvayaṁvare vr̥ttaṁśr̥ṇuṣvānyad dhanaṁjaya (ad MBh 7.173.58) makes the impression of being secondary, i.e. of being an explanatory interpolatioṇA copyist of the Telugu and Grantha lines of transmission may have known the myth through the Purāṇa tradition. 

On the other hand, the textual incongruity at issue could itself have been caused by an early infelicitous interpolation in the text of the DroṇaparvaṇThe interpolator may have known the myth of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara and may have carelessly used elements of it to embellish the eulogy of Siva, an example ´ of what I elsewhere have called ‘composition-in-transmission’ (above, p. 177). If this were the case, it probably was a very early interpolation, not only because the passage is found in all major mss, but also in the reprise in book 13. 

A third possibility is that a diaskeuast who worked on the Droṇaparvan composed his text by drawing upon disparate texts and that one of these texts contained the myth of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara. In this connection the question arises how we should conceive of the nature of this text, a question that may also be formulated as follows: how did the redactor of this part of the Droṇaparvan proceed? Did he have written texts at his disposal or did he collect his material from memory, that is, was he acquainted with a corpus of orally transmitted mythology out of which corpus he selected those parts that he could use? In view of the Vedic roots of two of the themes of the svayaṁvara myth, it seems likely to me that the myth of Pārvatī’s svayaṁvara circulated before it found its place in the SP, or in its garbled form in the MBh for that matter. Whether this circulation had an oral or written basis, or was actually an interplay of the two, is a question that has a direct bearing on our understanding of the process of composition of the Mahābhārata itself, a question that falls beyond the scope of the present investigation. 38 

38 A tentative answer to this question, not regarding the Mahābhārata, but the Skanda purāṇa itself is formulated in the last essay of this volume (below, pp. 601 ff.).
