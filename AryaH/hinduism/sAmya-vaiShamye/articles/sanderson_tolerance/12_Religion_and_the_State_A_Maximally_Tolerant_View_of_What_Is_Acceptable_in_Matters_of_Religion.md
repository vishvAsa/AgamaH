title = "12 Religion and the State: A Maximally Tolerant View of What Is Acceptable in Matters of Religion"

+++
In Jayanta’s play Āgamaḍambara we have seen the uncompromising Vaidika camp  attempt and fail to impose its Manu-inspired vision of a society free of all but  properly Vaidika religion. When the suppression of an extreme fringe cult leads to panic among the Śaivas, the king, a Śaiva himself, not necessarily an initiate  but a publicly declared loyal devotee of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ),93 who had at  the beginning of his reign founded temples for the installation of Śivas whose  names incorporated those of himself (Śaṇkaragaurīśvara) 94 and his chief queen (Sugandheśvara), intervenes and ensures that the status quo is maintained. The  play ends with an orchestrated debate between the Vaidikas and the preceptors  of the other faiths held in the Vaiṣṇava Raṇasvāmin temple in Srinagar on the  subject of whether the Pañcarātra and the scriptures of the other non-Vaidika  systems are or are not valid. In front of an audience of thousands, including the  former Snātaka Saṁkarṣaṇa, now turned ultra-tolerant minister of religious  affairs,95 the Naiyāyika Sāhaṭa, also called Dhairyarāśi, appointed as adjudictor  by the order of the king himself (nr̥pādeśāt), hears the various disputants put their  cases and then delivers his judgement. In this he rejects the narrow Vaidika view  of validity and advocates one with the greatest latitude, stopping short only of approving transgressive, licentious, and violent cults such as were certainly present  in Kashmir and elsewhere at this time. 

- 93. Āgamaḍambara, prose between 3.3 and 3.4; prose before 4.2. He is also described there to the  same effect as puraharahr̥dayasya ‘one whose heart is given to the destoyer of the [three] celestial  palaces’ (prose after 4.6). 
- 94. Kalhaṇa, Rājataraṅgiṇī 5.156–158. The two Śivas were installed in his new capital Śaṇkarapura or  Śaṇkarapattana (now Pattan/Paṭan in the Baramulla district of Kashmir), which he founded with his own name after coming to the throne. The two temples survive in ruins beside the road that runs from  Srinagar to Baramulla, approximately equidistant from both. 
- 95. Saṁkarṣaṇa, who in the first part of the play was the champion of the view that all non-Vaidika  views are invalid, is described by the Vaidika officiant who earlier lamented Saṁkarṣaṇa’s failure to  push this view through, when he catches sight of him in this gathering of the learned, as a champion of  the view that all (established) religions are valid; see the prose after 4.4: ‘We have direct experience  of the power of Saṁkarṣaṇa [in this matter]. For he [has become] an adherent of the doctrine of the  authoritativeness of all the religions’ (dr̥ṣṭaḥ saṁkarṣaṇapratāpaḥ. sa hi sarvāgamaprāmāṇyavādī). 

This view goes even beyond that enunciated above to recognize that not only Vaiṣṇavism and Śaivism but also Buddhism and Jainism are valid and must therefore be tolerated, holding that there is a single omniscient and nameless deity who in consideration of the differing  intellectual dispositions of human beings has manifested himself variously as the  propagators of all faiths: as Śiva, Paśupati, Kapila, Viṣṇu, Saṁkarṣaṇa, the Jina,  the Buddha, and Manu.96 The only criteria of validity from this point of view are  expressed as follows: 97 

- 96. Āgamaḍambara 4.57. These are in order the propagators of the Śaiva, Pāśupata, Sāṁkhya,  Vaiṣṇava, Pāñcarātrika, Jaina, and Buddhist systems, and the core Smr̥ti of the Vaidika tradition. 
- 97. Āgamaḍambara 4.100–101. 


> This path of validation cannot be applied to any [tradition regardless of its  character], but only to religious systems that meet the following criteria:  
>  (1)  they must have an unbroken tradition known to all; 
>  (2) the community  of the orthoprax (āryalokaḥ) must not be loth to be acquainted with them or speak about them; 
>  (3) the practices that they advocate must not be beyond  the pale of [what is acceptable to] society (janabāhyam); and 
>  (4) must not endanger [its members] (sabhayam); (5) their character must not be manifestly  new-fangled (na rūpaṁ yeṣāṁ sphurati navam abhyutthitam iva); 
>  (6) they must  not have the appearance of the teachings of madmen (pramattagītatvam);  
>  (7) they must not be teachings of Kaulas (akaulikatvam); 98 and (8) their source  must not be greed or any other [base motive] (lobhādi). 

- 98. I have tentatively conjectured the reading akaulikatvam here in place of the manuscripts’ alaukikatvam because the latter nonsensically excludes from acceptance any tradition that is not mundane  (laukika-). As we have seen, Śaṇkaravarman’s minister Jayanta was uncompromising in his condemnation of Kaula practice, but it is nonetheless surprising that this list should make so specific an exclusion. 


This position that all religious traditions (sarvāgama-) are entitled to be considered valid, if they meet the above criteria, is presented in theistic terms. A nameless supreme being is declared to have taught these various religions by assuming the form of their promulgators. However, it is clear that this dresses up in  religious language what is in effect a juridical and political view of what the state should tolerate. The issue on this level is not truth or falsity but legality and the  policy to be followed by the state in its role as guardian of the boundaries of the  permissible, or rather, to use the monarchical language used by our authors, by  the king in his role as the guardian and guide of the entire socio-religious order  (sarva-varṇāśrama-guruḥ) or, to use a phrase favoured by Jayanta, the king as the  authoritative judge (-acāryaḥ) of the boundaries (maryādā) of religious conduct  (dharmaḥ) within that order.99 

- 99. Āgamaḍambara, prose after 2.20: varṇāśramadharmamaryādācāryaḥ; prose after 4.104: varṇāś ramamaryādācāryaḥ. 


However, the king’s role was not merely to police these boundaries. It was also  to promote the peaceful co-existence of the faiths through even-handed patronage. During our period the publicly declared personal religious commitment of  kings, in addition to their commitment to preserve the Vaidika socio-religious  order, generally took the form of devotion to Śiva, Viṣṇu, the Sun-God (Sūrya,  Āditya), or the Goddess (Bhagavatī), the deities of the new initiatory religions, or  to the Buddha (Sugata, Tathāgata) of Buddhism or the Arhats of Jainism, these  allegiances being commonly announced in their inscriptions by the inclusion  amid their royal titles of epithets that mean ‘entirely (parama-, atyanta-, param)  devoted’ to whichever of these deities or religious founders they favoured. Thus  devout worshippers of Śiva/Maheśvara are identified as paramamāheśvaraḥ,  atyantamāheśvaraḥ, or paramaśaivaḥ; of Viṣṇu as paramabhāgavataḥ, parama vaiṣṇavaḥ, or atyantabhagavad-bhaktaḥ; of the Sun as paramāditya-bhaktaḥ or para ma-sauraḥ; of the Goddess (Bhagavatī) as parama-bhagavatī-bhaktaḥ; of the Buddha  as paramasaugataḥ or paramatāthāgataḥ; and of the Jaina Arhats as paramārhataḥ or paramajainaḥ.100 

- 100.See Sircar 1966, s.v. for all except paramārhataḥ and paramajainaḥ, for the first of which see, e.g.,  Kumārapālacaritrasaṁgraha pp. 28, 45, 108, and for the other, e.g., Vividhatīrthakalpa, p. 98. Also found  are epithets of the same kind expressing devotion to Bhairava (atyantasvāmimahābhairavabhaktaḥ)  or Narasiṁha (paramanārasiṁhaḥ); see Sircar 1966, s.v. 
- 101. Dani 1996, pp. 173–174. 


However, it was rarely the case that a king’s publicly declared allegiance to  one or another of these traditions was accompanied by strict exclusivity of patronage. For while a king might favour one religion over another, say Vaiṣṇavism  over Śaivism, it was common, and no doubt politic, for him to extend support  to religious traditions other than his own. Thus, the Kārkoṭakas of Kashmir,  who following the Śaiva kings of the Hephthalite Hun dynasty that had ruled  the country from early in the sixth century101 held power from the seventh to the ninth centuries, were consistently devotees of Viṣṇu, offering no support to the  cult of Śiva, yet they also supported Buddhism and the cult of the Sun.102 

- 102. See Sanderson 2009a, p. 73. 

Similarly, the Maitrakas of Valabhī were consistently Śaiva from the sixth to  the eighth centuries, yet, as we know from their copper-plate grants, Xuanzang,  and the Mañjuśrīyamūlakalpa, they were also generous patrons of Buddhism; 103 and the Pālas of Bihar and Bengal, though Buddhists, continued to support  Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism,104 as did the Candras of Arakan; 105 the predominantly  Śaiva Licchavi and ṭhākurī kings of Nepal were generous patrons of Bud dhism; 106 and simultaneous royal patronage of Śaivism and Buddhism was also a  conspicuous feature of religion in mainland Southeast Asia, in the kingdoms of  the Khmers, Chams, Sumatrans, Sundanese, and Javanese.107 

- 103. In the Alīnā copper-plate inscription of Śīlāditya VI Dhrūbhaṭa of ad 766 (cii 3:39) the account of  Lal the Maitraka lineage jumps from the Śaiva founder, Bhaṭārka, over the next four generations, which we  know from other inscriptions to have included a Vaiṣṇava and a Saura, to Guhasena. He and his thirteen  descendants down to Śīlāditya VI are identified as paramamāheśvaraḥ, with the exception of Śīlāditya  IV and Śīlāditya VI, who are given no sectarian epithet. For the Maitrakas patronage of Buddhism (in  its pre-Tantric forms) see Mañjuśrīyamūlakalpa 53.538–549; and Xuanzang on the recent conversion of  the king of Valabhī to Buddhism (Beal 1884, vol. 2. p. 267). Of the land-grant documents of the Maitrakas  of Valabhī three quarters are records of grants to brahmins, but the remaining quarter report grants  made by these kings to Buddhist institutions (Schmiedchen 2007, p. 360). On the Maitrakas support of  Buddhism see Sanderson 2009a, pp. 72–73.

In the south of India too we find examples of royal patronage of more than  one religious tradition. The Pallava Mahendravarman I Guṇabhara was a Śaiva  convert from Jainism if we may believe the Tamil Śaiva hagiography. As a Śaiva  he established rock-cut cave temples of Śivas with his biruda names: Śatrumalleśvara at Daḷavānūr,108 Avani-bhājana-pallaveśvara at Śīyamaṅgalam,109 and itāṇkura-pallaveśvara Tiruchirāpaḷḷi.110 Yet he also excavated a rock-cut temple of Viṣṇu with his name (Mahendraviṣṇu) in his town of Mahendrapura.111

We find  the same phenomenon in the dynasty of the Eastern Gaṅgas of Kaliṅganagara in  northern Andhra Pradesh, a line all of whose known rulers, from the first half of  the sixth century through to the end of our period, were declared devout worshippers of Śiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ). An inscription issued in year 79 of the Gaṅga era, which is to say, c. ad 578, records that Mahārāja Hastivarman Raṇabhīta of  this line made a land-grant for the support of a temple of a Viṣṇu incorporating  his name (Raṇabhītodaya) in spite of the declaration that the donor is a parama-māheśvaraḥ.112 The Hoysaḷa king Viṣṇuvardhana (r. 1110–1141) likewise, though  strongly influenced by the Śrīvaiṣṇava movement, was also a generous patron of  both Jainism and Śaivism.113 

There were even kings whose inscriptions depart from the convention of declaring allegiance to a single tradition by declaring them ‘entirely devoted’ to both  Śiva and Viṣṇu. This is true of the Pallava Narasiṁhavarman II (r. c. 700–728),114 the Gaṅga Anantavarman Coḍagaṅga in his Korni plates of 1081/2,115 Vaidyadeva  of Prāgjyotiṣa in his copper-plate grant probably of 1142,116 and Jayabhañja of the  Bhañjas of Kolāḍa in the eleventh or twelfth century.117

We also have evidence from the Khmer realm that there were Vaiṣṇava dignitaries within the predominantly Śaiva royal staff, that members of the same family could be of different religious allegiances, and that the state limited the  freedom of individuals to change their religion only in the special case of persons  from certain title-groups (varṇa) who had been selected for training as Śaiva officiants in the service of the king and were forbidden by a decree of Jayavarman V  (r. c. 970–1000) to become Vaiṣṇavas.118 

There are also numerous instances of royal marriages across religious boundaries in the subcontinent. In the fourth century the Vākāṭakas Rudrasena I  (r. c. 335–360) and Pr̥thivīsena I (r. c. 360–395) were Śaivas.119 But c. 388 their suc cessor Rudrasena II (r. c. 395–405) married Prabhāvatīguptā, the daughter of the  Gupta emperor Candragupta II (r. 376–415), a princess who in accordance with  the religious preference of her paternal family was a devotee of Viṣṇu (atyanta-bhagavad-bhaktā). Though Rudrasena continued to support the faith of his predecessors, he declared himself a Vaiṣṇava, no doubt under her influence,120 and  developed Rāmagiri (Ramtek) as a Vaiṣṇava state temple-complex. 

We have other examples in Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī. As we have seen above,  at the end of the ninth century, after the demise of the Vaiṣṇava Kārkoṭaka dynasty, Śaṇkaravarman (883–902) was a devout worshipper of Śiva and accordingly  founded Śiva temples with his and his queen’s names. But his queen Sugandhā, a foreigner from the north, probably a Dard (5.157), was a supporter of the Vaiṣṇava  Pāñcarātrikas,121 and while she occupied the throne from 904 to 906 after the  death of her husband and the short reigns of her sons, the boy king Gopālavarman (902–904) and his younger brother Saṁkaṭa (904), she established a Viṣṇu Gopālakeśava and a Gopālamaṭha with the former’s name (5.244). Moreover,  Nandā, Gopālavarman’s child bride, no doubt chosen for him by his Vaiṣṇava  mother, founded a Viṣṇu (Nandā)keśava and a Nandāmaṭha with hers (5.245).

After the end of the rule of this dynasty in 939 the brahmins bestowed the  crown on Yaśaskaravarman (939–948), the son of Prabhākaradeva, the trea surer of Gopālavarman, and the the secret lover of his Vaiṣṇava queen Sugandhā (5.469–477). This paramour may well have been the unnamed royal functionary  rumoured122 to have been a supporter, like the queen, of the Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātrikas. In any case his son Yaśaskaravarman was a Vaiṣṇava and one who exerted  himself to encourage orthopraxy and suppress the Śākta-leaning Śaivism then  strong in Kashmir (6.6–12, 108–112). He began the construction of a temple for  a Viṣṇu Yaśaskarasvāmin, incorporating his own name, but died before it was  finished (6.140). 

His successor Parvagupta (949–950) was a Śaiva, as we may infer from the  fact that he established a Śiva Parvagupteśvara (6.137) and at the end of his life  chose to die in the precincts of the Śaiva temple of the Sureśvarīkṣetra (6.147). His  religious conviction would not then have predisposed him to complete the Viṣṇu  temple of his anti-Śaiva Vaiṣṇava predecessor, but he was tricked into doing so  by one of Yaśaskaravarman’s widows, no doubt another Vaiṣṇava, who promised  him her favours if he did so and then when he had completed the work, committed pious suicide by offering herself into a sacrificial fire (6.140–144). 

Parvagupta was succeeded by Kṣemagupta (950–958), whose Śaiva persuasion  can be seen from the report that he founded a temple for a Śiva Ardhanārīśvara  under the name Kṣemagaurīśvara (6.172–173). But he married Diddā, the ruthless  and dissolute daughter of Siṁharāja, the Śāhi chief of Lohara, a mountainous district adjoining Kashmir on the south-west (6.176). Again a matrimonial alliance favoured Viṣṇu. It was probably through her influence – the king was so besotted  with her that he was mockingly known as Diddākṣema (6.177) – that when he fell fatally ill he chose to go to die in the Vaiṣṇava holy site Varāhakṣetra (6.186).  

During her long dominance of nearly fifty years until 1008 she enshrined a Viṣṇu  Abhimanyusvāmin with the name of her deceased son Abhimanyu (6.299), two  Viṣṇus Diddāsvāmin with her own name (6.300, 302), and a Viṣṇu Siṁhasvāmin  in Lohara (8.1822) with the name of her father (6.304); and her illustrious maternal grandfather Bhīma, the Śāhi king of Udabhāṇḍa (Hund) on the Indus, enshrined and richly endowed a Viṣṇu Bhīmasvāmin with his name in Kashmir  proper, at Bumzu near Bavan (6.178). 

- 122. Āgamaḍambara, p. 196, ll. 19–20. 

Nor does it seem that Indian courts were less tolerant than the Khmer when  
it came to the religion of their members. It seems not to have been the case, for  example, that a Śaiva could not aspire to ministerial office under a Vaiṣṇava king.  

We have a striking example of this at the beginning of our period at Udayagiri  near the ancient city of Vidiśā in central India, where an inscription records that Vīrasena, a minister of the Vaiṣṇava (paramabhāgavataḥ) Gupta emperor Candragupta II (r. c. 375–415), had a cave excavated for Śiva when he had come there  with that monarch while the latter was engaged in a military campaign.123 

- 123. cii 3:6, l. 5: ‘[Vīrasena, Minister of Peace and War of Candragupta] had this cave constructed out of  devotion for the god Śambhu when he had come to this place together with the king himself, who was  seeking to conquer the entire world (kr̥tsnapr̥thvījayārtthena rājñaiveha sahāgataḥ).’ 

The state’s support for religions other than that professed by the monarch in  the inscriptions issued by his chancellery is also clear from evidence of his participation in their major festivals. Xuanzang’s Da Tang Xiyuji, the account of his  journey to and sojourn in India from 629 (var. 627) to 645 (var. 644), completed in  646 on his return to China, tells us that in the vicinity of the city of Kanyakubja  (Kanauj) were a Buddhist monastery, a temple of the Sun-God, and a temple of  Śiva, all three of similar scale and grandeur; 124 and Huili and Yanzong’s biography of this learned Chinese pilgrim (Da ci en si san cang fa shi zhuan), completed  in 688, reports that in Kanyakubja during the Buddhist quinquennial festival  of the general distribution of alms (pañca-varṣa-pariṣat), the Puṣyabhūti emperor  Harṣa, whose Śaiva allegiance is reported by his biographer Bāṇa,125 offered worship to the Buddha on the first day, to the Sun-God on the second, and to Maheśvara (Śiva) on the third.126 

- 124. Beal 1884, vol. 1, pp. 222–223. 
- 125. Bāṇa, Harṣacarita, p. 45, l. 18: paramamāheśvaraḥ sa bhūpālo. . . 
- 126. Iyanaga 1983, p. 731a. 

This multi-faith environment, with several equally  balanced religious traditions flourishing side by side, is, I propose, the probable  cause of the great inconstancy of the declared religious allegiance of the kings  of this once great city, seen first among the Puṣyabhūtis and then among the  Gurjara-Pratīhāras. Among the Puṣyabhūtis the emperor Harṣa, as we have seen,  was a Śaiva (paramamāheśvaraḥ); but his father was a Buddhist (parama-saugataḥ),  and three preceding ascendants were Sauras (paramādityabhaktaḥ); 127 and among  the Gurjara-Pratīhāras we have successively the Vaiṣṇava Devaśakti, the Śaiva  Vatsarāja, the Śākta Nāgabhaṭa (r. c. 816–834), the Saura Rāmabhadra, the Śākta  Bhoja (r. c. 840–890), the Saura Vināyakapāla, and the Śaiva Mahendrapāla.128 

We may also point to socio-legal provisions at the eastern edge of the Indic  world, in East Java during the Majapahit period (1293–c. 1500). We know that  the state appointed clerical administrators of religion (dharmādhyakṣa) for both  the Śaiva (dharmādhyakṣa riṇ kaśaiwan) and Buddhist faiths (dharmādhyakṣa riṇ kasogatan), providing official residences for them close to the royal compound,  and that there was a board of subordinate religious officials known as the Assessors of Religion (dharmopapatti, dharmādhikaraṇa), who included persons adhering to the non-Saiddhāntika Bhairava cult (bhairawapakṣa) and the Saura cult of  the Sun (sorapakṣa).129
