      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/28/on-darshanas/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing many fellow traditional Hindus have found frustrating about me is my lack knowledge and lack of affinity for the advaita stream of vedanta, and more fundamentally me being a svatantra. My blasphemous views regarding vedas and their apauruSheyatva are also hardly appreciated in their midst. I am not shaken by their views because I am pretty firm in my convictions on these matters arising from ongoing study of the originals, and yAj~navalya always stands out as beacon. These are indeed matters of worthy of deep historical study by any Hindu and it is advisable that they take nothing for granted. The key to their study is comparative philosophy ‚Äì a term first suggested by Brijendranath Seal, a modern va~Nga scholar of early Hindu thought. Just like comparative linguistics is central to the understanding of Sanskrit, the language of Hindu thought, comparative philosophy is central to understanding the evolution of Hindu thought. It should be amply clear that the fundamental aspects of Hindu thought cannot be understood without comparative linguistics and philosophy, a point so blithely neglected by many traditional Hindus. Of course like most other sketches presented here the below ramblings are not completely worked out pieces of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/10/02/hindus-on-the-hard-problem/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had earlier mentioned the interesting discussion we had with Marc and kalashajA on what the western philosophers admit is the hard problem of &lt;a href=&#34;http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/06/we-are-zombies.html&#34;&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Our other acquaintance of the clan of the kAshyapa-s, had asked me if the Indians had contributed anything to the problem. He intuitively felt they had done so, but could not place a finger on it. Marc, R and I had some further discussion, and realized I knew less of it than I thought I did. As a result it was not certain that I had a defensive argument for all my original stances on the matter, and definitely consider it an area of my thought that is still shaping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It seems that when they say they are not religious they are mostly uninterested in H ritual practice of the saMskAra type or even personal acts of rituals towards deities. It is not entirely clear to us what kind of spirits the cleave to.  But they show an inclination towards a certain class of nonsense to borderline nonsense beliefs of mostly occidental vintage. The most bizarre thing I heard one of them tell me was that DNA was once 12 stranded!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1837320811226521926&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain Hindu religious systems, like the great shaiva institutions (both pAshupata and aishAna), were characterized by what might be termed a scale-free network architecture in terms of maTha-s and temples. They had major hubs which were which were connected to smaller hubs and so on finally ending in terminal leaves. These leaves were the small temples in the grAma-s, while examples of hubs were big maTha-shrines like the one at golagi or Amardaka. Such a network structure is susceptible to an attack on the hubs and rather resistant to an attack on the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hard problem of consciousness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A timeline of its past lives as a TikZ diagram according to GPT (messed the TikZ initially). Heard a clip of the guy in red who was awarded the Nobel prize, pontificating on consciousness on a podcast. He gave a silly thought experiment paralleling Chalmers&amp;rsquo; philosophical zombie:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Replace every neuron in your brain with an artificial neuron that does the same thing as the original.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then ask if you are conscious at every stage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You would obviously answer yes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From that, he goes on to assert that it is an emergent property of the neural connectivity and not some independent entity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that he was never able to say how it emerges beyond waving his hands. It seemed quite apparent that he was simply blind to the explanation gap and the issue of the hard problem. Almost 2 decades ago, I had the same discussion with a prolific condensed matter physicist from an Ivy League school, and he was also simply unable to perceive the gap despite multiple attempts. The same happened again with a neurobiologist and a physicist a few years ago. It is quite interesting that this insight needs something to fundamentally click that might not happen to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good points. Agree with the proposal that most H are not equipped. Anecdotally speaking I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the same &amp;ndash; a certain H fragility &amp;ndash; a newly half-educate H who might &amp;rsquo;ve picked up a tome or 2 of Dick Dawkins &amp;amp; suddenly see himself as possessing a deep insight which obviates the the need for religion. Regurgitating Dick or someone like that he would bellow on to those who might listen or not how meaningless &amp;amp; useless religion is. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen similar transformations with H who encounter Marx &amp;amp; his cohorts, Ambedkar, the canon of nayonmAda or even a physics or a biology textbook. Then those newbies would lecture about how &amp;ldquo;irrational&amp;rdquo; religion is &amp;ndash; a polycephalous or therocephalous god is deemed an impossibility of a specimen for teratological+++(‚Üêabnormalities of physiological development)+++ investigation. The size of ghaTotkacha is given an analysis in terms of speed of neuronal conductance, etc. This indeed can lead to a denudation of religion &amp;amp; consequent exposure to self-wrought or enemy-engineered social devolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Publishing your paper on your next greates discovery in Hindi or Tamil is not going to get you far. Becoming language of world system.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cons: not many understand it well in India; language of erstwhile enemy of the Indian people; does not capture certain aspects of Indian experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hindi;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;pros:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;it is the modern successor of the pan-Indian vulgar registers of Aryan speech: modern version of apabhramsha which was once understood as a pan-Indian language and the prAkR^ita-s at even earlier period.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It is a grammatically simpler than most other Indian languages once its logic is correctly taught.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Vocabulary mostly pan-Indian.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cons:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;unfair advantage to northern speakers who are close to it natively&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Not language of knowledge, education or having independent technical flourish.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;schwa deletion is aurally vulgar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sanskrit;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Pros:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;language of religion, India science, and education.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Intimately linked to the identity &amp;amp;unity of the Hindu nation.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sounds good to the ear.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Gives no undue advantage to any one group in the country.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Learning it can be a character-building experience that helps those with lower mental capacity to at least acquire some sense of educational worth.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;cons:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Difficult grammar, especially when there is a drive to adhere closely to pANini &amp;amp; his successors in entirity.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Good schemes for curricular delivery have not been done for schools,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;though paracurricular systems like SBh might be somewhat better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;d say that Skt is the best choice though it will not be without difficulty.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I think it needs some course correction&lt;br&gt;&#xA;such as willingness to impart in both nAgarI and romanized or other scripts.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Willingness to jetision the idiotic fetish for long conjunct words in writing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Deemphasizing kAvya and focussing on prose in practical education.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Being lax with more vulgar register of grammar at least to start with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When I raised the question of why the escathons need to be the same, when there is no evidence for that from within the systems, I never received a satisfactory answer. For example, is prancing as gaNa in rudra&amp;rsquo;s retinue the same as a station on the moon as pitR^i? They tend to push those away as arthavAda concealing the same basic endpoint. Of course instead of the lunar station, if we ask them if it might be same as finding a place in the retinue of viShvaksena, more than one has tried to tell has rudra = viShNu = brahman (n).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SM has raised a bit of conflict in me thus: On one hand I think H should be educated about the texts as they are rather their second hand imaginations regarding them. On the other hand I agree with the below &amp;ndash; average H education is simply too poor for them to meaningfully apprehend &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; texts that need nuance &amp;amp; historical context. While this may sound elitist, this is exactly what SM has taught me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Those are who are good at the arcana IE linguistics (its problems notwithstanding) and/or early Aryan philology &amp;ldquo;suck&amp;rdquo; at paurANika and tAntrika studies. Conversely, those who are good at the later think the world began ~ 250 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree Sanderson is a doyenne of tAntrika(+atimArga) studies but his paper titled something like &amp;ldquo;shaiva-s in atharvavedin territory&amp;rdquo; reflects a certain disconnect with an understanding of the earlier vaidika tradition, its contours and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
