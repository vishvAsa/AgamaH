One could question whether the Sandersonian term "shaiva age" is an entirely accurate term for the Indospheric religious landscape in the pre-Mohammedan medieval age (when the Indosphere peaked). A more general term could be the "tantra age" or even more generally the cosmopolitan Sanskrit age. Of course, most Occidental indologists and their Japanese and other fellow travelers are shy to tell you why this age ended (e.g., why did JS's title of "ending the shaiva age" play out). Insofar as we can define certain markers of an end (e.g., in Kashmir, the Panjab,  the Doab and central India), the answer is simple and indisputable: it is the coming down of the green curtains of marUnmAda. The mlechCha cannot accept and articulate this because he is joined at the hip with marUnmAda in the form of the mlechCha-marUnmattAbhisaMdhi.

That's why I specifically said: "...*most* Occidental indologists..." instead of all.
