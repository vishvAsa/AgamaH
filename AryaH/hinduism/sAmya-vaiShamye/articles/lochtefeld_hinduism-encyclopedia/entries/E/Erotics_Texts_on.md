One of the established genres in Indian  
literature was ratishastra, or “treatises  
on [sexual] pleasure,” of which the  
222  
Erotics, Texts on  
Erotic sculptures decorate the facade of the Kandariya Mahadev Temple in Khajuraho.  
best-known is the **Kama Sutra**. Sexual  
pleasure was seen as an established part  
of human life, which did not have to be  
hidden, and for which no excuses were  
necessary. **Kama** (as both “desire” and  
“sexual desire”) was one of the  
purusharthas or **aims of life**. Satisfying  
one’s desires was seen as a legitimate  
goal and considered a good thing, insofar as the pursuit did not interfere with  
other ends. The texts on erotics analyzed  
and classified sexuality in terms of aesthetic experience, as well as a vehicle  
for physical pleasure. For its sophisticated practitioners, such well-defined  
sexuality was intended to provide fulfillment for both partners, and here the literature is unusual for giving **women**  
equal desire and equal pleasure.
