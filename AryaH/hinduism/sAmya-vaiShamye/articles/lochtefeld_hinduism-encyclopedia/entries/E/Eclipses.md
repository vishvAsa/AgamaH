Without exception, eclipses are considered highly inauspicious and ritually

Eclipses  
dangerous times. As in many other cultures, Indian astronomers were able to  
figure out the motion of the **moon**, and  
thus could predict both solar and lunar  
eclipses fairly accurately. The traditional mythic explanation for eclipses  
comes from the story of the **Tortoise**  
**avatar**, in which the **gods** and **demons**  
agree to join forces to churn the Ocean  
of Milk into the nectar of immortality,  
which they will then share. The gods  
manage to trick the demons out of  
their share, but as the gods divide it  
among themselves, the demon **Sainhikeya**  
slips into their midst in disguise. As  
Sainhikeya begins to drink, the **sun** and  
moon alert the god **Vishnu** to  
Sainhikeya’s presence, and Vishnu  
quickly uses his discus to cut off the  
demon’s head. Yet since the demon  
drank some of the nectar, both his head  
and trunk become immortal, with the  
head becoming **Rahu** and the trunk  
becoming **Ketu**. Rahu has particular  
enmity for the sun and moon, the  
**deities** responsible for his demise, and  
tries to swallow them whenever he  
meets them in the **heavens**. He always  
succeeds, but since he no longer has a  
body to digest them, they escape  
unharmed through Rahu’s severed neck.  
This association with Rahu makes  
eclipses inauspicious and ritually dangerous times, and in popular culture  
eclipses are believed to emit malevolent rays that have a physical quality.  
Many people respond to this danger by  
remaining indoors for the duration of  
an eclipse. During an eclipse, people  
will often perform **rites of protection**,  
including giving donations (**dana**) as a  
way to give away potential bad luck.  
Pregnant **women** must take particular  
care, lest the **inauspiciousness** of the  
time affect the growing child. Some  
believe that pregnant women should  
lie completely motionless during an  
eclipse, fearing that the child will be  
born missing the body part corresponding to the one that the woman  
moved. After the eclipse, people bathe  
(**snana**) and perform other rites of  
purification to remove any possible  
lingering taint of impurity (ashaucha)  
or bad luck.
