title = "Ekmukhi Rudraksha"

+++
A particular type of **rudraksha**, which is  
a bead made from the dried seed of the  
tree *Elaeocarpus ganitrus*. The rudraksha is considered sacred to the god  
**Shiva**, and is often strung into garlands  
and worn by his devotees (**bhakta**). The  
seed itself is typically round, with a  
knobby pitted surface and a natural  
channel in the middle through which a  
thread can be easily drawn. It has natural divisions running from top to bottom, which divide the seed into units  
known as “faces” (mukhi). The Ekmukhi  
Rudraksha is one in which the dividing  
lines running from top to bottom are  
completely absent, making the whole  
seed a single and undivided piece. Such  
a rudraksha is extremely rare, as well as  
holy, for it is believed to be a manifestation of **Shiva** himself in material form.  
Their rarity also makes them extremely  
valuable, and street sellers routinely  
counterfeit them by carving reproductions out of pieces of wood, often with  
the symbol **Om** on one side.
