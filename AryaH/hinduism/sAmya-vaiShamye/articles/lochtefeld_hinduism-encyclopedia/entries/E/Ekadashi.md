(eleventh **day**) Hindu religious life is  
primarily based on the lunar **calendar**,  
in which the **year** contains twelve **lunar**  
**months**, each of which is divided  
equally into “dark” (waning) and  
“bright” (waxing) halves. Ekadashi is  
the name of the eleventh day in both  
the waning and the waxing half of the  
lunar month. Certain days during each  
half of the lunar cycle are deemed  
sacred to particular gods and goddesses, and these are days for special **worship**. The ekadashi or eleventh day in  
each half of the lunar month is deemed  
sacred to the god **Vishnu**. With one  
exception, each of the twenty-four  
ekadashis has a separate name, charter  
myth, prescribed rites, and promised  
result for fulfilling it. Pious Vaishnavas  
observe each of these twenty-four festival days. In their order of occurrence  
throughout the year, the ekadashis are:  
**Papamochani** Ekadashi and **Kamada**  
Ekadashi during the lunar month of  
**Chaitra**, **Baruthani** Ekadashi and  
**Mohini** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Baisakh**, **Achala** Ekadashi  
and **Nirjala** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Jyeshth**, **Yogini** Ekadashi and  
**Devshayani** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Ashadh**, **Kamika** Ekadashi  
and **Putrada** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Shravan**, **Aja** Ekadashi and  
**Parivartini** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Bhadrapada**, **Indira** Ekadashi  
and **Papankusha** Ekadashi during the  
218  
Eighteen Minor Works  
lunar month of **Ashvin**, **Rambha**  
Ekadashi and **Devotthayan** Ekadashi  
during the lunar month of **Kartik**,  
**Utpanna** Ekadashi and **Mokshada**  
Ekadashi during the lunar month of  
**Margashirsha**, **Saphala** Ekadashi and  
**Putrada** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Paush**, **Shattila** Ekadashi and  
**Jaya** Ekadashi during the lunar month  
of **Magh**, and **Vijaya** Ekadashi and  
**Amalaki** Ekadashi during the lunar  
month of **Phalgun**. Of these ekadashis,  
some are more important to the general  
populace than others, particularly  
Devshayani and Devotthayan Ekadashis,  
which mark the rainy **season** “sleep” of  
Vishnu during the **chaturmas** period. The  
only ekadashi to appear twice is Putrada  
(“son-giving”) Ekadashi. This promises  
that faithful observance will bring the  
**birth** of a son, and its reappearance clearly points to the traditional preference for  
**sons** over **daughters**.
