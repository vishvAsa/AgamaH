title = "Elements"

Traditional Indian **cosmology** holds that  
there are five basic elements, four of  
which are similar to those found in  
medieval European conceptions: **earth**,  
**fire**, **water**, and **wind** (as moving air that  
is perceptible to human beings). The  
fifth element, **akasha**, has no readily  
understandable correlate to European  
ideas. It is generally translated as  
“**space**” and is considered to pervade  
the environment around us, filling the  
empty spaces. An unusual feature in  
Indian cosmology is that each of these  
elements is associated with a particular  
sense: earth with smell, fire with sight,  
water with taste, wind with touch, and  
akasha with hearing.
