In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Ekalavya is a  
figure who illustrates the pervasive  
reach of the **caste** system. Ekalavya is  
a tribal boy who wants to learn  
archery from **Drona**, the royal archery  
teacher, but is refused because of his  
low **birth**. Undaunted, Ekalavya  
makes a clay image of Drona, treats it  
as his teacher, or **guru**, and through  
assiduous practice and devotion to his  
guru becomes the most skilled archer  
on the earth. When **Arjuna**, a young  
warrior-king and Drona’s best student, discovers this, he becomes jealous and complains to Drona, since  
Drona has promised Arjuna that no  
one will surpass him as an archer.  
Drona asks Ekalavya how he has  
become so skillful. When he learns  
that Ekalavya has worshiped Drona’s  
image as his guru, Drona notes that he  
is entitled to a preceptor’s fee (**dakshina**). As his fee he requests Ekalavya’s  
right thumb, a gift that will considerably diminish Ekalavya’s shooting  
abilities. Ekalavya fulfills Drona’s wish  
without hesitation, but from that day  
is no longer better than Arjuna.
