title = "Elements, Subtle"

+++
The subtle elements (**tanmatras**)  
are one of the stages in the **evolution**  
of the world and the human being in  
the **Samkhya** philosophical school.  
The subtle elements are the basis for  
the formation of the five gross elements:  
**earth**, **air**, **fire**, **wind**, and **akasha**.  
See **tanmatras**.
