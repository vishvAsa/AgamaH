(2) In its material form, one of the  
five **elements** in traditional Indian  
**cosmology**, the others being **water**,  
**fire**, **wind**, and **akasha**. In some  
philosophical schools, each of the  
elements is paired with one of the five  
senses; in this case earth is associated  
with smell. The element earth is also  
associated with certain bodily functions,  
especially the elimination of solid wastes.
