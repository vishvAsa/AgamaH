+++
In an anthropological sense, a marriage  
pattern in which members of a particular social group marry only members of  
the same group. In northern India, traditional marriages tend to be endogamous  
with regard to the **jati** (hereditary occupational group), and exogamous with  
regard to the village community and the  
**gotra** (mythic family lineage).
