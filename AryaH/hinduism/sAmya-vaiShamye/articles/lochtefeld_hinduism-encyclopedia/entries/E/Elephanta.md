Island in the harbor outside the city of  
Bombay, most famous for its temple to  
**Shiva** by the same name. The date of the  
temple’s construction is disputed, but is  
generally ascribed to the seventh or  
eighth century C.E. Elephanta is a rockcut cave temple, in which the sandstone  
hillside was carved away to form the  
temple itself, and the images of the  
**deities**. This follows the general pattern  
of the rock-cut temples at **Ellora** in  
**Maharashtra** and required careful planning, since carving errors could not be  
corrected. The Elephanta shrine displays images of Shiva in his various  
forms: as Lord of the **Dance** (**Nataraja**),  
as the Lord of **Asceticism** (Yogishvara),  
as Bearer of the **Ganges** (Ganghadhara),  
as the pillar-shaped form known as the  
**linga**, and as the combination of male  
220  
Ekoddishta  
and female known as **Ardhanarishvara**.  
The central image, and by far the most  
famous, is the three-headed, eighteenfoot-tall image of Shiva as **Maheshvar**,  
the “great Lord.” The face on the left  
shows his horrific and destructive facet  
as **Bhairava**, the face on the right his  
benevolent, creative facet as **Uma**,  
whereas the center face shows him as  
Tatpurusha—blissful, eternal, and transcending the ephemeral affairs of the  
world. Although the primary image is  
virtually untouched, many of the others  
sustained damage from Portuguese  
imperialists who considered the images  
idolatrous and used them for target  
practice. For further information see
