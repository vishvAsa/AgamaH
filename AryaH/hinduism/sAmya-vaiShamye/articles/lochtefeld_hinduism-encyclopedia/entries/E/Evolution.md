title = "Evolution"

Fundamental doctrine of the **Samkhya**  
school of Indian **philosophy**. The  
Samkhya school uses a theory of evolution to explain the human perception of  
223  
Evolution  
an inner world of subjective experience  
and the objective outer world, which it  
argues are not true aspects of the real, or  
essential, world. Samkhya metaphysics  
posits two principles as the essence of  
the universe, **purusha** and **prakrti**.  
Purusha is pure awareness, which is  
conscious but inactive and unchanging.  
Prakrti is primal matter which, in its  
most basic form, is an equilibrium of  
three different unconscious forces  
(**gunas**): **sattva** (goodness), **rajas** (passion), and **tamas** (decay). According to  
the Samkhya, the conflation and confusion of purusha and prakrti is the basic  
cause for the bondage of the soul to the  
cycle of reincarnation (**samsara**)—  
where purusha is seen as if it is acting,  
and prakrti is seen as if it is conscious.  
While this misunderstanding does not  
effect purusha, it causes prakrti to  
undergo an evolutionary process, in  
which this primal matter becomes  
increasingly differentiated, leading to  
further confusion of the nature of the  
universe. The first stage of evolution is  
called **mahat** (“great one”) and occurs  
when the original equilibrium between  
the three gunas has been disturbed;  
mahat is also known as **buddhi**, which is  
conceived as the cognitive faculty necessary for thought. The mental processes  
facilitated by buddhi spur the development of **ahamkar** (“I-making”), in  
which one finds the first feelings of egoconsciousness. With the rise of this subjective feeling comes the division into  
subjective and objective worlds: on one  
hand, ahamkar evolves the five subtle  
elements (**tanmatras**), the precursors of  
the gross **elements**, and on the other it  
evolves into the eleven faculties: five  
**jnanendriyas** or sense organs, five  
**karmendriyas** or organs of action, and  
the mind as the eleventh. At liberation  
this process of evolution happens  
in reverse, with the many successively  
devolving into the one. As in  
most Indian philosophical systems,  
liberation comes when correct understanding has replaced a mistaken  
one. For further information see
