Eroticism  
Stone columns carved into the entrance of a cave in Ellora.  
renunciation, Hindu culture has also  
fostered considerable eroticism, which  
has a recognized place in everyday life.  
One example of this is the **Kama Sutra**,  
a well-known “manual” on the art of  
love, which is but one example of a literary genre called ratishastra, or “treatises  
on [sexual] pleasure.” Other examples of  
eroticism in the culture can be seen in  
the sculptures carved on the temples  
**Konarak** and **Khajuraho**, and in the  
amount of attention given to poetry on  
love. In Hindu culture **kama** (“desire,”  
particularly sexual desire) is one of the  
purusharthas, or **aims of life**, with the  
others being **artha** (wealth), **dharma**  
(religious duty), and **moksha** (final liberation of the soul). Erotic pleasure  
is thus recognized as a legitimate goal,  
as long as it is kept in proper perspective. Although renunciation is one of  
the great themes in Hindu life, nonrenunciation has been stressed at least  
as strongly.  
In modern popular Hindu culture,  
eroticism is expressed through the esoteric ritual tradition known as **tantra**, in  
which sexual union is a symbol for liberation. Sexual intercourse is sometimes  
incorporated as an actual element in  
tantric ritual, as the most notorious of  
the **panchamakara** or “Five Forbidden  
Things.” Although tantric practice has  
strong popular associations with illicit  
sexuality, such acts are always performed within a strict ritual context. In  
tantric practice, the ultimate aim is not  
to satisfy one’s carnal desires, but to  
demolish the dualism between sacred  
and profane that is ultimately a sign of  
ignorance. The act of ritualizing normally  
taboo behavior is one way to destroy this  
duality, as well as a way to emphasize  
the superiority of tantric practice over  
other forms of religious life. In such  
practice, the adept is also imitating  
**Shiva**, who is himself both the perfect  
**yogi** and the model husband.
