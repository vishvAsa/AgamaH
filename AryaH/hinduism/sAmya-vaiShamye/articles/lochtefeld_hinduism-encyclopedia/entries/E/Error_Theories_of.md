title = "Error, Theories of"

+++
Indian philosophical schools give serious consideration to the questions of  
how and why people make errors in  
judgment. Although these schools may  
cite seemingly mundane examples, such  
as mistaking the silvery flash of a  
seashell for a piece of silver, investigating judgment errors is ultimately rooted  
in religious goals. Specifically, the religious goal is to gain true awareness of  
the actual nature of things, and through  
this to bring about final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**) from the karmic cycle of  
reincarnation (**samsara**). Each school’s  
answers to the question of truth and falsity reveal fundamental differences  
about the understanding each has of the  
inherent nature of things, which have  
clear implications for bondage and liberation. Although the differing schools  
disagree on the mechanics of “how” one  
sees silver instead of a shell, there is general agreement about why such a mistake takes place. This and other errors  
are rooted in the karmic predispositions  
stemming from **avidya**, most specifically the greed that prompts human beings  
to look for items of value. Far more  
explanation can be found in the individual entries, but in brief there are six  
major theories of error.  
In the **Prabhakara** branch of the  
**Mimamsa** school, the theory is **akhyati** or “nondiscrimination,” in which  
the source of error is the inability to  
make sharp distinctions. The theory  
in the **Naiyayika** school is **anyathakhyati**, the “discrimination of  
something else,” in which the mind  
projects an erroneous perception  
(**pratyaksha**) onto another object.  
The Mimamsa philosopher **Kumarila**  
explains error as **viparitakhyati** or  
“contrary discrimination,” in which  
the source of error is a bad assessment  
of an object’s similarities and differences. The **Samkhya** school propounds the theory of **sadasatkhyati**,  
or “discrimination of the unreal as the  
real,” in which the source of error is  
merely an extension of the original  
error to distinguish between the two basic  
realities, **purusha** and **prakrti**. **Ramanuja**,  
founder of the **Vishishthadvaita Vedanta**  
school, propounds the theory of **satkhyati**, “discrimination of the real,” in which  
one correctly perceives the silvery flash,  
but makes an incorrect assumption  
based on this. The final theory of **anirvachaniyakhyati** or “indescribable discrimination,” is advanced by the  
**Advaita Vedanta** school; according to  
this, one illusory perception is superimposed on another conventionally true  
but ultimately illusory perception. For
