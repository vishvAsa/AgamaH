title = "Eknath"

+++
(1533–1599) Poet and saint in the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
that worships the Hindu god **Vithoba**, at  
his temple at **Pandharpur** in the modern state of **Maharashtra**. Eknath was a  
**brahmin** who lived most of his life in the  
city of **Paithan**, which was an important  
trading and political center. Today, there  
is a shrine to Eknath in Paithan. In keeping with his birth as a brahmin, Eknath  
was highly learned in traditional  
Sanskritic lore. His best-known work is a  
translation into Marathi of the eleventh  
chapter of the **Bhagavata Purana**, a  
sectarian religious text that is the most  
important for the **worship** of the god  
**Krishna**. Yet Eknath also seems to have  
been intensely conscious of the spiritual  
capacities of the lower **castes** and the  
way in which social boundaries could be  
219  
Eknath  
leveled by devotion. In short poems  
known as **bharuds** he speaks in a variety  
of voices, including those of untouchables, Muslims, and **women**. Traditional  
accounts of his life describe him as  
treating **untouchable** devotees (**bhakta**)  
as his equals, and even **eating**  
and drinking with them. Such flagrant  
transgression of social boundaries  
brought trouble from more orthodox  
brahmins—who are portrayed as the villains in these traditional accounts—but  
on each occasion Eknath managed to  
escape being outcasted by them, often  
through divine intervention. For further
