title = "Elephant"

+++
In ancient India, one of the emblems  
of royalty, in part because an elephant’s  
prodigious appetite would soon  
bankrupt any individual pretending to  
have the wealth of royalty. Elephants  
also appear in the Hindu pantheon:  
The divine elephant **Airavata** is the  
**animal** vehicle of **Indra**, and the god  
**Ganesh** has an elephant’s head on a  
human body, a souvenir of his conflict  
with **Shiva**.
