Throughout the world the act of eating  
is imbued with cultural significance and  
cultural messages, and Hindu culture  
makes no exception. Given the strong  
emphasis on **purity**, Hindus pay significant attention to the preparation and  
consumption of food. Factors such as  
whom one eats with, who may prepare  
one’s food, and what types of food one  
will eat and how it should be prepared  
all send messages about the social status  
of an individual or a community. The  
groups with the highest status, particularly **brahmins**, are the strictest with  
regard to their dining habits. For the  
most part, such high-status groups  
adhere to a principle known as **commensality**—that is, only eating food  
cooked by members of their social  
group. With regard to the content of  
one’s diet, the great divide is between  
vegetarian and nonvegetarian. An exclusively vegetarian diet indicates higher  
status, and among nonvegetarians there  
are status gradations depending on  
what types of meat one eats. For orthodox Hindus, every meal is a potential  
source of ritual contamination and must  
be carefully monitored. Food cooked in  
water is seen as far more susceptible to  
pollution (**ashaucha**) and greater care is  
taken in accepting it, whereas food fried  
in oil or ghee is believed to be much  
more resistant to pollution and thus a  
lesser source of ritual danger. From a  
religious perspective, the safest meal of  
all is the meal that is cooked and eaten  
at home. See also **Vegetarianism**.
