+++
“Intended for one [person].” A particular  
type of **shraddha** or memorial service  
for the dead, which is performed for the  
benefit of a single person. An ekoddishta  
shraddha can be performed as a series  
of sixteen **offerings** performed during  
the first **year** after the person’s death.  
These sixteen offerings are more commonly collapsed into a single rite performed on the eleventh **day** after death,  
the day after the ten-day period of ritual  
impurity (**maranashaucha**) has come to  
an end.
