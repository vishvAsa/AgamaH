title = "Kanauj"

+++
Small city on the **Ganges** River, about  
fifty miles upstream from the city of  
Kanpur. Kanauj is now insignificant, but  
the city, formerly known as **Kanyakubja**,  
was once one of the most important in  
344  
Kamsa  
northern India. Its existence is documented as early as the sixth century  
B.C.E. The city was an important stop on  
the trade route running through the  
Ganges basin. It is referenced in  
Ptolemyâ€™s *Geography*, written around  
150 C.E. Kanauj was also an important  
political center; in the early seventh  
century it was the capital of the  
**Pushyabhuti dynasty**, ruled by the  
emperor **Harsha**. In later centuries the  
**Pala**, **Rashtrakuta**, and **GurjaraPratihara** dynasties fought over the city,  
with the Gurjara-Pratihara eventually  
gaining control. After suffering an attack  
by **Mahmud of Ghazni** in 1017 C.E.,  
Kanauj seems to have gone into permanent decline. Its modern legacy is being  
the location of the dominant branch of  
**brahmins** in the Gangetic Plain. They  
call themselves **Kanaujia** brahmins.
