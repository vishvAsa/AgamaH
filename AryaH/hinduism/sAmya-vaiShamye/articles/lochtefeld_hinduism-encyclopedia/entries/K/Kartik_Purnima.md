Festival during the **full moon** in the **lunar**  
**month** of **Kartik** (Octoberâ€“November),  
celebrated as a bathing (**snana**) festival.  
During the festival, an early morning bath  
in the **Ganges** or any other sacred river is  
believed to provide the bather with exceptional religious merit. People often journey  
to sacred rivers to take advantage of this  
opportunity. Also on this day, Sikhs celebrate the birthday of their religious leader,  
Guru Nanak, born in 1469.
