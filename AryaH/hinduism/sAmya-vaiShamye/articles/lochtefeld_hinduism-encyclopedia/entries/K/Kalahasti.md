title = "Kalahasti"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
southern state of **Andhra Pradesh**,  
about fifty miles east of the town of  
**Tirupati** and 125 miles northwest of the  
city of Madras. Kalahasti is famous as  
one of the **bhutalingas** (“elemental lingas”), a network of five southern Indian  
sites sacred to the god **Shiva**. At each of  
these sites Shiva is worshiped as a **linga**,  
the pillar-shaped object that is his  
symbolic form, and at each site the  
linga is believed to be formed from one  
of the five primordial **elements**  
(bhuta)—**earth**, **wind**, **fire**, **water**, and  
**space** (**akasha**). Kalahasti’s linga is  
associated with the element of wind,  
and the manifestation of Shiva there is  
Kalahasteshvar, the “Lord of Kalahasti.”  
Kalahasti is also one of the **Shakti**  
**Pithas**, a network of sites throughout  
the subcontinent that are sacred to the  
**Goddess**. Each Shakti Pitha marks the  
site where a body part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to earth, taking  
form there as a different goddess; in the  
case of Kalahasti the body part was Sati’s  
left shoulder. Kalahasti’s sanctity is thus  
reinforced by having two highly powerful and sacred sites to two different  
**deities**. See also **pitha**.
