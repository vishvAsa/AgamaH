title = "Kalamukha"

+++
(“black face”) Extinct monastic sect  
whose members were devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva** and whose name may  
refer to their practice of marking their  
heads with a black streak. Little is  
known about their doctrines or practices. While there are contemporary literary references to the **Kapalikas**,  
another extinct Shaivite **ascetic** community, the only sources for the  
Kalamukhas are a series of **inscriptions**.  
From these inscriptions we know that  
the Kalamukhas were strongest in the  
**Karnataka** region, although they were  
also present in other southern Indian  
regions. They flourished between the  
ninth and thirteenth centuries.
