(“action”) The notion of karma and its  
connection with reincarnation (**samsara**) are perhaps the most fundamental  
concepts in Indian thought and are  
ideas shared by all Indian religions:  
Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh.  
Although the literal meaning of karma is  
“action,” it is believed to encompass  
words and thoughts as well as deeds.  
The basic assumption behind the  
notion of karma is that of a dynamic  
universe, in which any action that one  
takes will have consequences that will  
eventually affect oneself. In the simplest  
explanation, good actions will have  
good consequences, and evil actions  
will have evil consequences, in an  
extended chain of cause and effect.  
Since thoughts are considered actions,  
this determination of “good” and “evil”  
actions also takes into account one’s  
motives—a laudable action performed  
for an ignoble motive is still a laudable  
action, but will not generate as much  
merit as the same action performed for  
a pure motive.  
Karma is seen as a purely physical  
process, much like the law of gravity. It  
does not require a divine overseer,  
although in devotional Hinduism, God  
is generally seen as having the power to  
nullify one’s past karma. The effects of  
one’s actions may come either in this life  
or in future lives. The former case is easy  
to believe, since most people accept that  
their actions have consequences, but  
the latter case is much more difficult to  
support with concrete evidence. Since  
the general tone of one’s life is seen as  
more important than a few isolated acts,  
one might compare the idea of karma  
with the notion of a person’s “character.”  
Both are determined by one’s habitual

ways of thinking and acting, and entail  
an overall assessment of a person. For
