title = "Kurmasana"

+++
(“tortoise-posture”) One of the sitting  
postures (**asanas**) used in **yoga**; also  
a posture in which images of the  
**deities** are portrayed in Hindu  
iconography. As described in commentaries on the **Yoga Sutras**, this posture  
has the legs crossed with the feet  
tucked under the thighs, and the crossed  
heels forming a cavity around the  
scrotum. In Indian iconography,  
the Kurmasana is sometimes represented at the base of a statue by an  
actual carving of a tortoise, forming  
the base on which the image is placed.  
In modern yoga manuals this posture  
is described as a sitting position  
in which the upper body is bent  
forward, with the arms extended  
sideways under the outstretched  
legs, so that person looks vaguely
