title = "Korravai"

+++
Fierce form of the **Goddess**, worshiped  
in southern India and originally  
believed to have been an autochthonous (“of the land”) **deity**. Korravai is  
associated with the hunt and the battlefield, and thus with **blood**, death, and  
carnage. Perhaps because of these associations, she was later identified with  
other fierce manifestations of the  
Mother Goddess, particularly the goddess **Kali**.
