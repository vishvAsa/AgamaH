title = "Kashmir"

+++
One of the three distinct cultural areas,  
along with **Jammu** and Ladakh, in the  
modern Indian state of Jammu and  
Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir is a former  
princely state, in which the Hindu Dogra  
kings also ruled over the **minority** populations of the mostly Muslim Kashmiris and  
the mostly Buddhist Ladakhis. Since  
Indian independence in 1947, this ethnic  
and religious division continues to be a  
source of trouble, and nowhere more than  
in Kashmir. At independence, Pakistan  
attempted to take the region by force and  
claimed a section of Kashmir. In the time  
since then, India and Pakistan have fought  
several wars over it; Pakistan claims it by  
virtue of their shared religion of Islam;  
India claims it by virtue of a document  
signed by the last of its kings, Maharaja  
Hari Singh. The Kashmiris themselves  
have been caught in this regional clash,  
and their demands for greater self-determination have been largely ignored.  
After the 1986 state elections, which were  
widely regarded as rigged, tensions  
in Kashmir came to a boil. Since 1990 the  
tension has turned into an open rebellion,  
assisted by covert aid from Pakistan.  
Most Kashmiris became Muslims  
during medieval times. Before that time  
the region was a Hindu cultural area.  
Kashmir still has some stunning examples of early Hindu **architecture**, such as  
the **sun temple** at **Martand**, a temple to  
the god **Shiva** at **Pandrenthan**, and the  
shrine to Shiva at **Amarnath** cave which  
356  
Kashi  
is still an important pilgrimage site.  
Kashmir also has a minority Hindu population, known as the Kashmiri Pandits.  
Recent troubles have prompted many of  
them to migrate south to other parts of  
India. Although these two communities  
profess different religious beliefs, they  
share a common language and sense of  
Kashmiri identity and culture. For general information about Kashmir and  
regions of India, see Christine Nivin et
