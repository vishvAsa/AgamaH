title = "Kichaka"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Kichaka is the brotherin-law of King **Virata**. King Virata is host  
to the five **Pandava** brothers (the epic’s  
protagonists) during the year that they go  
incognito after twelve years of forest  
exile. During this time, Kichaka becomes  
attracted to **Draupadi**, the Pandavas’  
common wife, who serves as an attendant to one of the royal ladies. Kichaka  
continues his advances despite her  
protests and strikes her when she tries to  
escape. One of Draupadi’s husbands,  
**Bhima**, is livid when he discovers what  
has happened. He tells Draupadi to  
arrange a secret meeting with Kichaka,  
on the pretense of surrendering to his  
desires. Bhima disguises himself as  
Draupadi and when Kichaka arrives,  
Bhima kills him with his bare hands.
