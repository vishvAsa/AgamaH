title = "Kaliya"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a thousand-headed  
serpent who is defeated by the adolescent god **Krishna** in one of the earliest  
acts foreshadowing the god’s future  
greatness. Kaliya has settled into a deep  
pool in the **Yamuna River**, rendering the  
pool and its surroundings uninhabitable  
because of the noxious poison he  
constantly emits. One day as Krishna  
and his companions tend the cows,  
Krishna decides to get rid of Kaliya.  
Despite his friends’ pleas, Krishna  
climbs to the top of a tall tree and dives  
deep into the pool. A tremendous battle  
ensues. Krishna finally subdues Kaliya  
by dancing on his hoods, stamping each  
of the serpent’s heads until blood runs  
out of Kaliya’s mouths. Kaliya’s wives beg  
Krishna to spare his life, and Krishna  
grants this request but banishes him to a  
more appropriate place. His mercy mirrors the Hindu world view that even  
beings such as Kaliya have a rightful  
place in the world. Although problems  
arise when such beings are in the wrong  
place, these can be corrected by sending  
them to a more appropriate one. For further elaboration of this idea, See John  
Stratton Hawley, “Krishna’s Cosmic  
Victories,” in *Journal of the American*  
*Academy of Religion*, Vol. 47, No. 2, 1979.
