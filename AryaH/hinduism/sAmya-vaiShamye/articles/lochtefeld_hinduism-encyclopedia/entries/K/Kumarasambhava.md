(“**Birth** of the Prince”) One of the  
finest poetic works written by **Kalidasa**,  
who is generally considered the  
greatest classical **Sanskrit** poet. The  
*Kumarasambhava* is an epic poem  
377  
Kumarasambhava  
based on a mythological theme. It  
begins by describing the ascendancy of  
a **demon** named **Taraka**, who receives a  
divine boon that he can only be killed by  
a son of **Shiva**. The poem describes the  
extended courtship of Shiva and  
**Parvati**, their marriage, and ends with  
an account of their lovemaking. The text  
ends before the birth of the god **Skanda**,  
who in other mythical accounts of this  
tale kills Taraka. This abrupt ending has  
led some interpreters to consider the  
play unfinished. Others simply view  
these later events as a foregone conclusion, by which the poet does not waste  
his hearers’ time.
