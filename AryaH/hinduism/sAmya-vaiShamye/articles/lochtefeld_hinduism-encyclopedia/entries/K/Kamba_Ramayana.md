title = "Kamba Ramayana"

+++
**Tamil language** version of the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics. The *Kamba Ramayana* was  
written in ninth century by the southern  
Indian poet **Kamban**. As with all vernacular renditions of the *Ramayana*,  
Kamban did not simply translate  
**Valmiki**’s **Sanskrit** epic, but adapted  
and added to it as he saw fit. Of particular interest is his heroic portrayal of  
**Ravana**, the **demon**-king, who is the villain in the original story. This shift may  
reflect feelings of regional pride, since  
Kamban was from southern Indian.  
Ravana’s kingdom of **Lanka** is generally  
identified as the island of **Sri Lanka** in  
the Indian Ocean, southeast of the  
Indian mainland.
