title = "Kautilya"

According to tradition, Kautilya was the  
author of the **Arthashastra** (“Treatise on  
Power”), a text which is a handbook on  
the exercise of royal power. The ruler  
portrayed in the *Arthashastra* cares little  
for ideals or **dreams**, but rather is willing  
to do whatever is necessary to remain in  
power. Aside from his authorship of the  
*Arthashastra*, Kautilya is also identified  
as the Machiavellian **brahmin** minister  
who orchestrated **Chandragupta**  
**Maurya**’s rise to power, but there are  
serious doubts that these Kautilyas are  
the same person.
