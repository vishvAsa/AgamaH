Traditional Indian society was as a  
collection of **endogamous** subgroups  
(in which marriage is decreed by law  
to occur only between members of  
the same group) known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group held a monopoly. The Kunbis’  
traditional occupation was farming.  
They were the dominant landholding  
community in **Gujarat**.
