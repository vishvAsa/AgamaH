title = "Karva Chauth"

+++
Religious vow (**vrat**) observed on the  
fourth (chauth) day of the dark, waning  
half of the **lunar month** of **Kartik**  
(October–November). Karva Chauth is  
taken by married **women** to ensure their  
husbands’ health, prosperity, and long life.  
There are many such vows in which  
women’s observances and sacrifices are  
355  
Karva Chauth  
channeled into maintaining the welfare  
and prosperity of the family. Although  
such vows are voluntary in the strictest  
sense, there is great social pressure for  
women to perform them, thus fulfilling  
their expected role as “good” wives. Karva  
Chauth is a very strict vow; women observing it neither eat nor drink until they see  
the **moon** rising that evening. When the  
moon appears, the women offer water to it  
and then are permitted to drink. On this  
evening, women may also **worship** the  
**deities Shiva** and **Parvati** (the divine  
example of a happily married couple) and  
**Karttikeya**, their son. Women also give  
each other small pots (karva) filled with  
sweets, hence the festival’s name.  
The charter myth for this observance  
tells how a young bride, while performing  
this fast at the home of her birth, grows  
faint and nearly lifeless. Her brothers are  
so worried about her health that one of  
them climbs into a tree with a lantern,  
while the others convince her that the  
light is coming from the rising moon. The  
young woman is greatly relieved, but as  
soon as she drinks water her husband falls  
down dead. Her brothers eventually have  
to confess what they have done. As the  
woman lays lamenting her newly gained  
widowhood, she is discovered by the **goddess** Parvati, who assures her that her husband will be restored to life if she faithfully  
observes Karva Chauth the following year.  
The young woman does as she is told and  
regains her husband.  
This tale contains significant cultural  
information, particularly on people’s differing obligations. A brother’s duty is to  
protect his sister. A wife’s primary duty is  
to her husband, and her efforts should be  
devoted to his welfare. As in many such  
tales, the consequences of failing to keep a  
religious observance are swift and severe,  
and the rewards from faithfully performing it are equally grand.
