title = "(“ear-piercing”) Samskara"

+++
The ninth of the sixteen traditional lifecycle ceremonies (**samskaras**), in which  
an infant’s ears were pierced. This rite  
was done not only for ornamentation  
but also for protective purposes.  
According to **Sushruta**, the author of  
one of the oldest Indian medical texts,  
piercing the ears protected children  
against certain ailments. Although in  
modern times most young girls have  
pierced ears, this practice is far less  
common for boys, suggesting that  
ornamentation has taken precedence  
over protection.
