+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Garhwal** region of the **Himalayas**, about  
ten miles down the **Alakananda River**  
from **Joshimath**. The temple’s presiding  
**deity** is the god **Shiva** in his manifestation as Kalpeshvar, the “Lord of the  
Cosmic Age.” The Kalpeshvar temple is  
one of the **Panchkedar**, a network of five  
sites in the Garhwal region that are  
sacred to Shiva; the other four sites are  
**Kedarnath**, **Rudranath**, **Tungnath**, and  
**Madmaheshvar**. Shiva is believed to  
dwell in the Himalayas. This network of  
five sites is seen as a symbolic representation of his body. Kalpeshvar represents  
Shiva’s matted locks (**jatas**).
