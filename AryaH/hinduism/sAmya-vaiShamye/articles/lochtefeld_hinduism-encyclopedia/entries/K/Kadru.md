title = "Kadru"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of the  
divine sage **Daksha** and sister of **Vinata**.  
Kadru gives birth to a line of serpents,  
whereas her sister’s children are born as  
eagles, the most famous of whom is  
**Garuda**. The well-known hostility  
between these species is attributed to a  
conflict between Vinata and Kadru: one  
day they are arguing about the tail color  
of a certain celestial horse, with Vinata  
arguing that it is white and Kadru asserting that it is black. The disagreement  
becomes more intense until they finally  
agree that whoever is wrong will become  
a slave to the other. To ensure her victory, Kadru persuades a number of her  
snake children to hang from  
the back of the horse. From a distance  
the tail appears to be black. (Some of  
her children disapprove of such dishonesty and refuse to participate. In revenge  
Kadru curses them to die in the snakekilling **sacrifice** performed by King  
**Janamjeya**.) When Vinata sees the black  
snakes, she believes she has been  
defeated and serves Kadru under  
extremely harsh conditions for many  
years. Vinata is finally rescued by her  
son Garuda, who discovers the fraud  
behind Vinata’s defeat and embarks on  
a program of killing snakes that has  
never stopped.
