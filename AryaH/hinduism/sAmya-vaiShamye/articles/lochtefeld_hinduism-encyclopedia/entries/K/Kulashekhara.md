title = "Kulashekhara"

+++
(9th c.) One of the **Alvars**, a group of  
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, emphasizing passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a  
personal god, conveyed through hymns  
sung in the **Tamil language**. According  
to tradition, Kulashekhara was the king  
of the Travancore region in modern  
**Kerala**. His religious commitment grew  
so strong that he eventually abdicated  
his throne. For further information see
