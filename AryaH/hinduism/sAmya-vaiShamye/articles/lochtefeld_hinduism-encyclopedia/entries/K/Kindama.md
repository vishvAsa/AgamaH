title = "Kindama"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, Kindama is a  
forest-dwelling sage, whose **curse** on  
King **Pandu** advances the epic’s plot.  
Although celibate in his human form,  
Kindama occasionally uses his **magic**  
powers to transform himself and his  
wife into animals, so that they can experience sexual pleasure. On one occasion,  
as Kindama and his wife are in the form  
of deer, King Pandu shoots the copulating pair with an arrow. In their dying  
moments the sage and his wife revert to  
their human forms. The sage curses the  
horrified Pandu to die the moment he  
takes his wife in an amorous embrace.  
Since Pandu is childless, he abdicates  
the throne in favor of his blind brother  
**Dhrtarashtra** and becomes a celibate  
renunciant. Pandu’s wives, **Kunti** and  
**Madri**, eventually bear children through  
magical means. The struggle for  
power between their children and  
**Duryodhana**, Dhrtarashtra’s son, is the  
epic’s pivotal conflict.
