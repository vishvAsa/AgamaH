title = "Kubja"

+++
(“hunchback”) In the mythology of the  
god **Krishna**, Kubja is a hunchbacked  
woman whom Krishna meets while  
journeying to the city of **Mathura** to  
reclaim his kingdom. Kubja carries a jar  
of expensive salve that is meant for the  
king, but when Krishna asks her for  
some, she willingly gives it to him. As a  
reward for her generosity and devotion,  
Krishna straightens her spine, turning  
her into a gorgeous young woman.
