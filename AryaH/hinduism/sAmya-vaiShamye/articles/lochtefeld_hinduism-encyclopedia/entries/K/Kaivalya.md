(“isolation”) In **Samkhya** and **Yoga**, two  
of the **six schools** of Hindu **philosophy**,  
kaivalya is the state of final liberation. A  
person who has attained kaivalya has  
fully comprehended the difference  
between two important principles: the  
conscious but inert **purusha**, which is  
identified as the Self, and the active but

Kaivalya  
unconscious **prakrti**. According to  
Samkhya metaphysics, confusion  
between these two eternally distinct  
principles triggers the **evolution** of subjective consciousness and the exterior  
world, in which the eternal Self becomes  
the witness to repeated rebirths. Of the  
two schools, Samkhya provides the theoretical explanation for bondage and  
liberation of the soul, whereas Yoga provides the method to liberation. The purpose in performing **yoga** is to help the  
person distinguish between these two  
principles, removing obstructions to  
understanding, particularly the karmic  
tendencies rooted in egoism. According  
to the **Yoga Sutras**, the foundational text  
for the Yoga school, those who can distinguish between these two principles  
and discern the soul’s identity with the  
purusha attain independence from all  
external causes, mastery over all states  
of being, and omniscience. For further
