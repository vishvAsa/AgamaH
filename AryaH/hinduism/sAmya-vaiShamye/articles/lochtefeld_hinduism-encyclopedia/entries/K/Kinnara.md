(“What, Man?”) Mythical creatures  
described as either having the head of a  
horse and the body of a human being, or  
the head of a human being and the body  
of a horse. The Kinnaras are described as  
servants of **Kubera**, a minor **deity**.  
Kubera is one of the **Guardians of the**  
**Directions**, a group of eight deities  
believed to rule the cardinal and intermediate directions. He is the ruler over  
the northern direction, and thus identified as living in the **Himalayas**, where  
the Kinnaras also live. The Kinnaras are  
usually considered identical to the  
mythical creatures known as the  
Kimpurushas.
