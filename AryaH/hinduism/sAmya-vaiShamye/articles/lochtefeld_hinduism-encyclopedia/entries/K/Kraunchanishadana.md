title = "Kraunchanishadana"

+++
(“curlew-sitting”) One of the sitting postures (**asanas**) described in commentaries to the **Yoga Sutras**. The Yoga  
Sutras are attributed to the sage  
**Patanjali** and give the earliest instruction of yoga. The Kraunchanishadana  
posture begins in **dandasana** or “stickposture,” in which one sits with the  
upper body erect, the arms straight with  
the hands flat on the ground and pointing forward, and the legs outstretched.  
From this posture one of the legs is folded  
back to the outside, with the heel  
pressed against the outer thigh. The  
other leg is raised straight up and  
pressed against the torso, with the  
hands clasped at the bottom of the foot.
