A bamboo yoke topped with semicircular splints of bamboo that is carried  
on a devoteeâ€™s (**bhakta**) shoulders during certain festivals devoted to the god  
**Murugan**. A kavadi is usually decorated with flowers, pictures, ribbons, and  
other ornaments. A devotee carrying a  
kavadi is inviting Murugan to descend  
and rest upon it, bestowing his **grace**
