title = "Kalivarjya"

+++
The name for a collection of about fiftyfive acts “to be avoided in the **Kali**  
[Age],” the last age in the cycle of **cosmic**  
**time** after which it is believed the world  
will be destroyed and recreated. This  
was one of the strategies used by **brahmin**  
scholars to forbid certain religious practices that were prescribed in the sacred  
literature but were no longer acceptable  
because of changing ideas. The  
Kalivarjya prohibitions first appear in  
texts around the twelfth century C.E.  
Some of the practices considered  
acceptable in earlier times but prohibited  
during the Kali age include certain  
**animal sacrifices** prescribed in the  
**Vedas** (the earliest Hindu religious texts)  
and **suicide** by a person suffering from a  
terminal illness. For further information

*History of Dharmasastra*, 1968.
