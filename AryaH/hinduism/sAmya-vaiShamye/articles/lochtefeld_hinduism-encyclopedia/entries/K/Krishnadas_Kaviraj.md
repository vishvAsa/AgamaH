Author of the most influential version of  
the **Chaitanya-Charitramrta** (“Nectar  
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account of  
the life of the Bengali poet-saint  
**Chaitanya**, written about ninety years  
after Chaitanya’s death. **Krishnadas’s**  
text is the latest and most developed  
biography of Chaitanya and focuses  
mainly on Chaitanya’s later life, particularly his visit to **Brindavan**, the northern  
Indian village were the god **Krishna**  
is supposed to have spent his  
childhood. This text is marked by the  
philosophical influence of the three  
**Goswamis**—**Rupa**, **Sanatana**, and  
**Jiva**—whose ideas played a major role in  
shaping Chaitanya’s religious followers,  
the **Gaudiya Vaishnavas**. As with the  
other traditional accounts of Chaitanya’s  
life, this text does not purport to give  
an “objective” biography, it is rather  
a hagiography (an idealizing and  
idolizing portrait) written by a  
passionate devotee (**bhakta**).
