title = "Kataka Hasta"

+++
In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual, a  
particular hand **gesture** (**hasta**), in  
which the tips of the fingers are loosely  
joined to the thumb, to create a ring (the  
word *kataka* literally means “bracelet”).  
This hasta is common in the images of  
Hindu goddesses, but also serves a useful purpose: a fresh flower may be  
inserted in her hand every day.
