title = "Kathak"

+++
One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are  
**Bharatanatyam**, **Orissi**, **Kuchipudi**,  
**Kathakali**, and **Manipuri**. Like much  
of traditional Indian culture, classical  
dances are identified with certain  
regions; Kathak is primarily found in  
northern India. Traditionally, Kathak  
descended from the **ras lilas** of **Braj**,  
devotional dances illustrating events  
from the life of **Krishna**. This claim  
has little historical support and may  
simply reflect the desire to root all of  
the Indian arts in religion. It is not disputed, however, that Kathak developed as an art form in the courts of the  
northern Indian princes, where it was  
performed for the entertainment of  
the monarch and his guests. In time,  
two major Kathak centers developed:  
Jaipur, famous for spectacular footwork; and Lucknow, known for its  
attention to acting. Stylistically,  
Kathak is marked by an upright posture, with the legs kept straight. The  
dance emphasizes rapid, rhythmic  
foot patterns, rhythms accentuated by  
strings of bells worn on the dancer’s  
ankles and complemented by multiple  
turns; the torso is kept fairly immobile.  
As with all forms of Indian dance,  
Kathak includes a well-developed  
“vocabulary” of facial expressions and  
gestures of the arms and hands that  
358  
Katha  
allow the dancer to convey a great  
range of emotions to the audience. For
