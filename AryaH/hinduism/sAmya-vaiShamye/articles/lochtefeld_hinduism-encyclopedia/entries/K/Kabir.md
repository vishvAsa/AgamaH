title = "Kabir"

+++
(mid-15th c.?) A poet who is widely  
regarded as one of the greatest northern  
Indian religious figures. Kabir is among  
a group of central and northern Indian  
poet-saints known as **Sants** who shared  
several tendencies: emphasis on individualized, interior religion leading to a  
personal experience of the divine; disdain for external ritual, particularly  
image **worship**; faith in the power of the  
divine Name; and a tendency to ignore  
hierarchical distinctions between  
castes. Kabir strongly adhered to these  
beliefs—in his writings he uncompromisingly attacks any sort of religious  
practice based on habit or tradition,  
including **asceticism**, special modes of  
dress, fasting (**upavasa**), image worship,  
**caste**, and scripture.  
In his poetry, Kabir identifies himself  
as belonging to a caste of weavers (julaha),  
and according to tradition he supported  
himself through this occupation. Kabir’s  
history makes it difficult to link him with  
a particular religion. In Arabic, the name  
Kabir (“Great”) is one of the names given  
to Allah in the Qur’an, identifying him as  
a Muslim. However, his poetry reveals  
his great knowledge of Hindu religious  
life. It is generally believed that the  
members of Kabir’s julaha community  
were recent converts to Islam who had  
not yet been fully assimilated. Kabir’s  
poetry, however, clearly shows that he  
considered himself neither Hindu nor  
Muslim. Part of Kabir’s popularity  
undoubtedly stems from his blunt,  
passionate affirmation that real  
religious attainment is only gained by  
internal, individual experience of the  
divine, to which he gives the name **Ram**.  
This is not the god-king who is the hero  
of the **Ramayana**, but a name for the  
indescribable, absolute Supreme  
Reality. Both of these emphases reflect  
the influence of the **Nathpanthi**  
ascetics, who also stressed internal  
experience and **yoga**.  
In one of his songs, Kabir once boasted  
that he had been so absorbed in the  
divine that he had never put pen to  
paper. His songs remain popular even  
today, and many of his shorter epigrams  
have become proverbial sayings. Kabir’s  
oldest attested poetry survives in three  
major collections: one in the **Adigranth**,  
the Sikh scripture also known as the  
“Primal Book”; one collected by the  
**Dadupanth**, the religious organization  
founded by the Sant poet-saint **Dadu**;  
and the **Bijak**, which was compiled by  
the **Kabirpanth**, a religious community  
that claimed Kabir as its **guru** (religious  
preceptor). The significant differences  
328  
Kabandha  
among these collections indicate that  
they have no single source. For further
