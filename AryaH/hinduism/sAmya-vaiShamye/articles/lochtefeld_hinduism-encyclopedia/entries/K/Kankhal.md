title = "Kankhal"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) three miles  
south of the city of **Haridwar** in the state  
of **Uttar Pradesh**. Kankhal is most  
famous for the **Daksha Mahadev** temple, dedicated to the god **Shiva** in his  
form as “**Daksha’s** Lord.” This temple’s  
charter myth is one of the most famous  
of all the stories of Shiva. Daksha is one  
of the sons of the god **Brahma** and the  
father of **Sati**, the **goddess** whom  
Daksha gives in marriage to Shiva. When  
Daksha feels that Shiva has not shown  
him proper respect, he plans a great **sacrifice** to which he invites all the gods,  
but purposely excludes Shiva. When Sati  
asks why her husband has been excluded,  
Daksha responds with a stream of  
abuse, denouncing Shiva as worthless  
and despicable. Humiliated, Sati commits **suicide**. Shiva is furious when he  
hears of Sati’s death, and in his rage creates the fierce **deities Virabhadra** and  
**Bhadrakali**. He then comes storming  
with his minions (**gana**) to the sacrificial  
ground, completely destroying the sacrifice, and cuts off Daksha’s head.  
Daksha is eventually restored to life,  
repents his foolish pride, and asks Shiva  
to remain at that site forever, which he  
agrees to do.  
There are numerous smaller temples  
near the Daksha Mahadev temple, some  
of which are dedicated to figures associated with this story, such as Virabhadra.  
Across the street from the Daksha temple is a large **ashram**, or religious community, built by devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the Bengali mystic **Anandamayi Ma**.  
The ashram also contains her **samadhi**  
**shrine**, or **burial** place.
