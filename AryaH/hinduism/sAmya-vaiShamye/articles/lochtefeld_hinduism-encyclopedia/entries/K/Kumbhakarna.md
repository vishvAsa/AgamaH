title = "Kumbhakarna"

+++
(“Pitcher-eared”) In the **Ramayana**, the  
earlier of the two great Indian epics,  
Kumbhakarna is the brother of **Ravana**,  
the **demon** ruler of **Lanka**. As his name  
indicates, his dominant facial feature  
is his prominent ears. Kumbhakarna is  
a reincarnation of **Vijaya**, **Vishnu’s**  
378  
Kumarila  
gatekeeper, who has been cursed to be  
reborn three times as a demon, killed  
by the god Vishnu each time.  
Kumbhakarna and his brothers have  
performed harsh **asceticism** (**tapas**) in  
their youth to gain boons from the gods.  
When the god **Brahma** finally comes to  
give him boons, Kumbhakarna means to  
demand “nirdevatvam” (that he cannot  
be conquered by any of the gods). At the  
critical moment he is foiled by the **goddess Saraswati**, who has power over  
speech. She dances on his tongue and  
confuses his speech, causing him to  
request “nidravatvam” (sleepiness).  
Because of this slip of his tongue,  
Kumbhakarna will sleep for six months  
at a time, wake up to gorge himself with  
food and drink for a short time, and then  
fall asleep again. Some of the dramatic  
tension in the battle portions of the  
*Ramayana* pertains to the violent efforts  
to rouse Kumbhakarna, so that he can  
take part in the battle. Once awakened  
he fights valiantly, but is eventually  
killed by **Rama**.  
As is true for all the **demons**,  
Kumbhakarna is not wholly evil. Before  
engaging in battle with Rama’s army,  
he rebukes Ravana for kidnapping  
Rama’s wife, **Sita**. He also notes that as  
the younger brother it is his duty to  
uphold the family honor. Here we find  
the demon Kumbhakarna upholding  
idealized Indian family values—the  
younger brother is supposed to support and defend his elder brother’s  
interests as a way to keep the family  
intact. This same virtue is in Rama’s  
younger brothers, **Lakshmana** and  
**Bharata**. Despite their enmity, the  
epic’s “heroes” and “villains” have significant shared values.
