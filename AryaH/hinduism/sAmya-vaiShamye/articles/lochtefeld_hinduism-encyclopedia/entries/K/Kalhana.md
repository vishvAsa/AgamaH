title = "Kalhana"

+++
(12th c.) Kashmiri poet and author of the  
**Rajatarangini** (“River of Kings”), a  
poetic chronicle of the kings of  
**Kashmir**. Kalhana’s chronicle is an  
unusually descriptive and accurate history of Kashmir and its political, social,  
and religious institutions. The text’s only  
shortcoming is that it pays little attention to the outside world. Kalhana’s historical emphasis is unusual for Indian  
writers, and his chronicle is one of the  
few indigenous Indian histories.
