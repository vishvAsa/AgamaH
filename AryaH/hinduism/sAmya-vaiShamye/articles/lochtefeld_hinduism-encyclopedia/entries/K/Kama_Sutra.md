(“manual on desire”) By far the most  
famous of the ancient **erotic** manuals,  
traditionally attributed to the sage  
**Vatsyayana**. This text is usually associated  
with an exhaustive catalog of sexual  
positions and pleasures, but in fact it  
goes far beyond this stereotype.  
Vatsyayana was interested in exploring  
desire in all its manifestations. The text  
begins with a consideration of the four  
**aims of life** (purushartha): worldly  
goods (**artha**), desire (**kama**), religious  
duty (**dharma**), and liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**). Vatsyayana argued that  
since desire was one of the established  
goals of human life, its pursuit was thus  
a good thing, as long as this pursuit did  
not interfere with the others.  
Having established the legitimacy of  
desire, Vatsyayana then discussed how  
to foster it. The *Kama Sutra*’s second  
book contains the text’s best-known  
material, the discussion and categorization of various types of sexual union. It  
begins by characterizing types of sexual  
endowment, both male and female.  
Next it describes different sorts of  
embracing, kissing, scratching, and biting as symbols of passion, along with  
sexual positions and oral sex. This is followed by chapters on gaining a wife,  
attracting other men’s wives (which the  
text discourages, except in cases where  
one’s passion is “too strong”), courtesans, and general remarks on the nature  
of attraction.  
The text is a manual for all phases of  
erotic life in which sex can be refined  
into a vehicle for aesthetic experience as  
well as pure carnal pleasure. The *Kama*  
*Sutra* is also notable for its perspective

on **women**, who are seen as having  
equal sexual desire and gaining equal  
pleasure. The ultimate aim is the sexual  
satisfaction of both partners, rather than  
one partner simply serving the other.  
The *Kama Sutra* has been translated  
many times.
