In Indian **philosophy**, one of the two  
great seventh-century commentators of  
the **Mimamsa** philosophy, one of the **six**  
**schools** of Hindu philosophy; the other  
great commentator was **Prabhakara**.  
The Mimamsa school was most concerned with the examination and pursuit of **dharma** (“righteous action”), for  
which members believed all necessary  
instructions were contained in the  
**Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
Consequently, much of Mimamsa  
thought is concerned with principles  
and methods of textual interpretation to  
uncover and interpret the Vedic instructions. Although both Kumarila and  
Prabhakara were committed to discovering the boundaries of dharma by  
interpreting the Vedas, there are significant differences in their philosophical  
positions, which show up most clearly in  
their **theories of error**.  
Prabhakara begins with the assumption, similar to the **Nyaya** concept of  
**inherence** (**samavaya**), that there is a  
relatively weak correspondence  
between an object and its attributes. An  
example of this would be the relation of  
the color red to a particular ball, such  
that the ball is said to be red. According  
to Prabhakara, false beliefs result from  
**akhyati** (“nondiscrimination”). This  
occurs when a person observes two different things with the same attributes  
and concludes that they are the same.  
Kumarila is closer to the **bhedabhada**  
(“identity and difference”) philosophical  
position, which holds that all things  
have both identity and difference with  
all other things. Kumarila explains error  
as **viparitakhyati** (“contrary perception”), in which one mistakenly pairs up  
the similarities between two things,  
rather than noting their differences. For  
example, a person mistakenly believes  
that a shell with a silvery color is actually a piece of silver because he or she  
chooses to focus on the similarities  
between the shell and silver rather than  
the differences. People are impelled to  
make these choices by karmic formations, such as greed for silver.
