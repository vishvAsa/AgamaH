title = "Katyayana Smrti"

+++
One of the **smrtis** or “remembered”  
texts, a class of literature deemed  
important but less authoritative than  
the other textual category, the **shrutis**  
or “heard” texts. This smrti is attributed to the sage Katyayana and is an  
example of one of the **Dharma**  
**Shastras**, manuals prescribing rules  
for correct human behavior and ideal  
social life. Unlike the **Dharma Sutras**,  
which are ascribed to recognizable  
individuals, the Dharma Shastras are  
usually credited to mythic sages as a  
strategy to reinforce the authority of  
these texts. Katyayana’s complete text  
has not survived, although more than  
one thousand verses have been compiled from later works. Katyayana’s  
text was the first to focus on the rights  
of **women**: he gave particular attention to women’s personal property  
(**stridhan**), both to explain their powers and to prescribe rules for its **inheritance** when a woman died.
