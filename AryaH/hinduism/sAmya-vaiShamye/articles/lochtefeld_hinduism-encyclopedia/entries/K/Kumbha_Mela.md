+++
(“Festival of the Pot”) A religious festival  
celebrated in four different locations:  
**Haridwar**, **Allahabad**, **Ujjain**, and  
**Nasik**. The first two sites are by far the  
most important, with Allahabad considered the holiest of all. Attendance at  
these festivals is great. In 1998, ten million people were in Haridwar on the climactic day. Both of these sites also host  
an **Ardha** (“half”) **Kumbha Mela**, generally six years after the full Kumbha Mela,  
which are smaller in scale, but can still  
draw millions of pilgrims. At Ujjain and  
Nasik, the full Kumbha Melas are not as  
well attended than at the other two sites.  
The Kumbha Mela is a bathing  
(**snana**) festival; it is for this reason  
that all the Mela sites are found near  
rivers. The Kumbha Mela’s primary  
actors are ascetics from all over South  
Asia who come to bathe in the sacred  
waters. According to tradition, the  
Kumbha Mela was organized by the  
great philosopher **Shankaracharya** to  
promote regular gatherings of  
learned and holy men, as a means to  
strengthen, sustain, and spread  
Hindu religious beliefs. The Kumbha  
Mela is also a time for these ascetics  
to display their status vis-à-vis one  
another. At each site, the order in  
which the different **ascetic** sects  
bathe is strictly enforced—the most  
important sects bathe first. In more  
recent times, this order has been  
379  
Kumbha Mela  
enforced by the government. In earlier  
times, it was the subject of much dispute,  
often degenerating into armed conflict as  
different ascetic sects vied with one  
another for the place of pride.  
The time for each Kumbha Mela festival is determined astrologically, based  
on the positions of the planet **Jupiter**,  
the **sun**, and the **moon**. The Mela is held  
at Haridwar when Jupiter is in Aquarius  
(Kumbha) and the sun enters Aries; at  
Allahabad when Jupiter is in Taurus and  
the sun and moon are in Capricorn; at  
Ujjain when Jupiter is in Leo and the full  
moon appears in the **lunar month** of  
**Baisakh**; and at Nasik when Jupiter is in  
Leo during the lunar month of **Shravan**.  
These alignments occur about every  
twelve years.  
The charter myth for the Kumbha  
Mela is taken from the story of Churning  
the Ocean of Milk. After the ocean has  
been churned and the nectar of immortality (**amrta**) has been extracted, the  
gods and their **demon** opponents begin  
to quarrel over the pot of nectar. The  
gods snatch the pot and make off with  
it, but the person carrying the pot  
grows tired, and in twelve days of carrying it sets it on the ground four times—  
namely, at the four sites where the Mela  
is held. In each place a bit of the  
nectar splashes on the ground,  
sanctifying the site. According to popular belief, at each Kumbha Mela’s most  
propitious moment, the waters in which  
people are bathing become the nectar  
of immortality, and all those who  
bathe in these waters gain immeasurable religious merit.  
Kumbha Mela is considered the  
largest religious festival in the world.  
Arrangements for the Melas at Haridwar  
and Allahabad are made by the government of **Uttar Pradesh**, coordinating  
transportation, drinking water, and sanitation for millions of pilgrims, as well as  
building temporary cities for the  
visitors. Ascetics come from all over  
the subcontinent, some staying for  
months. Many religious organizations  
set up booths in an effort to publicize  
their message.  
Recently the government has begun  
using the Mela to promote ideas such as  
family planning and cleaning up the

Kumbha Mela  
The bathing procession in Haridwar during the Kumbha Mela festival.  
The differing ascetic orders proceed toward the holy waters according to a traditionally sanctioned order.  
**Ganges**, as well as promoting the Mela  
as tourism, spurring economic development. This combination of business and  
religion has roots in the past; in the early  
nineteenth century, the annual spring  
bathing fair at Haridwar was also a trading fair, particularly for horses. For many  
people, the opportunity to view the  
spectacle of the Mela is at least as strong  
an inducement as the promise of  
bathing away their sins. See also
