title = "Krishna Janam Bhumi"

+++
Site in the city of **Mathura** believed to  
mark the spot where the god **Krishna**  
was born. The present temple was completed in the 1960s, but the site itself is  
very old. One of the most religiously  
volatile sites in all of India, the new temple abuts the Shahi Idgah, a mosque  
built on the base of an earlier Krishna  
temple. According to one tradition,  
Muslim iconoclasts destroyed four successive temples at the spot now occupied by the mosque, marking the exact  
location of Krishna’s **birth**. This claim  
seems doubtful since the mosque was  
built in 1661, and the temple it is said to  
have replaced was destroyed by the  
Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb** in 1669. In  
the 1980s the Krishna Janam Bhumi was  
one of the three sites selected by the  
activist **Vishva Hindu Parishad** to be  
reclaimed as a Hindu holy place, along  
with the **Vishvanath** temple in **Benares**,  
and **Ayodhya’s Ram Janam Bhumi**. In  
all of these places, mosques were  
claimed to have been built on the site of  
an important Hindu temple, although  
only the first two have historical evidence that this occurred. During the  
1990s there have been several campaigns to reclaim the Krishna Janam  
Bhumi, but to this point the campaigns  
have generated little support. Given the  
popular backlash after the 1992 destruction of the **Babri Masjid** in **Ayodhya**, the  
government has been far more restrictive on the activities it allows at such disputed sites. For further information see
