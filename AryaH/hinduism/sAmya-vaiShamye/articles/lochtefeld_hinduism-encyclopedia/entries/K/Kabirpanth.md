title = "Kabirpanth"

+++
Religious community whose members  
are followers of the northern Indian  
poet-saint **Kabir**. Some Kabirpanthis are  
**ascetics**, and some are householders.  
The group’s most important center is  
located in **Benares** (where Kabir is  
believed to have lived) and houses an  
ascetic community. Although in his  
poetry Kabir rejects ritual, **worship**, and  
reliance on anything but one’s own  
unmediated experience—a context  
implying the practice of **yoga**—the  
Kabirpanth has taken on all of these  
conventional religious trappings. The  
community’s sacred text is the **Bijak**, a  
collection of poems and epigrams  
attributed to Kabir. Its sacred centers  
have pictures of Kabir, who has become  
an object of worship. Elaborate rituals  
are performed on certain prescribed  
days. This situation is ironic because it  
appears that many of the practices Kabir  
condemned have been adopted by the  
community professing to follow his  
teachings. Given Kabir’s continual  
emphasis on the need for unmediated  
personal experience of the divine, the  
notion that he would be seen as the  
founder of a sect would itself have been  
outrageous to him. For further information see David Lorenzen, “Traditions of
