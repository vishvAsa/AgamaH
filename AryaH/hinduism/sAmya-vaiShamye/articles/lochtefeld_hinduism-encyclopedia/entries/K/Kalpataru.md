title = "Kalpataru"

+++
(“wishing-tree”) Extensive collection of  
writings on matters relating to religious  
law, compiled by the scholar  
**Lakshmidhara** in the middle of the  
twelfth century. The *Kalpataru* is one of  
the earliest examples of commentarial  
literature known as **nibandhas** (“collections”). The nibandhas were collections  
of Hindu lore, in which the compilers  
drew references on a particular theme  
from the **Vedas**, **dharma literature**,  
**puranas**, and other authoritative religious texts. Then they compiled these  
excerpts into a single volume. Each of  
the *Kalpataru*’s fourteen volumes is  
devoted to a particular aspect of Hindu  
religious life, including daily practice,  
**worship**, gift-giving (**dana**), vows, pilgrimage, penances (**prayashchitta**),  
purification, and final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**). As one of the earliest  
nibandhas, the *Kalpataru* formed  
a model for later writers and was also  
an important resource for them.  
Lakshmidhara’s writing is unusual  
because he used very few sources for his  
work—primarily the epic **Mahabharata**  
and a few of the sectarian collections  
known as puranas. Unlike later  
commentators, he does not cite the  
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious texts,  
or the prescriptions found in the dharma  
literature. His text also consists mostly  
of these excerpted passages with very  
little commentary of his own, whereas  
later nibandha writers often give  
voluminous explanations.
