title = "Kavikarnapura"

+++
(mid-16th c.) Author of one version of  
the **Chaitanya-Charitramrta** (“Nectar  
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account of the  
life of the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**.  
Kavikarnapura’s text was written in 1542,  
nine years after Chaitanya’s death, when  
the effort to declare Chaitanya a saint  
had already begun. Kavikarnapura freely  
acknowledges his debt to an earlier biography of Chaitanya, written by **Murari**  
**Gupta**. He diverges from the earlier text  
by portraying Chaitanya as an incarnation of **Krishna**, descending to earth to  
bestow **grace** on ordinary mortals. As  
with the other traditional accounts of  
Chaitanya’s life, the author does not  
claim this to be an “objective” biography  
but instead a hagiography written by a  
passionate devotee (**bhakta**).
