title = "Kaikeyi"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Kaikeyi is the second  
wife of King **Dasharatha**, the mother of  
**Bharata**, and foster mother to **Rama**,  
the epic’s protagonist. Kaikeyi is directly  
responsible for one of the most  
329  
Kaikeyi  
villainous acts in the *Ramayana*: She  
forces Rama into fourteen years of exile  
in the forest, a major event in the epic’s  
plot. Despite her evil action, she is not  
considered an evil person, but rather a  
person who acts out of love for her **son**  
yet who is burdened with extremely bad  
judgment and bad advice. When  
Dasharatha announces that he intends  
to anoint Rama as the heir to the throne,  
Kaikeyi is as happy as everyone else.  
Rama has always respected her as much  
as his own mother, **Kausalya**, and has  
treated Bharata as his equal. But as the  
day of the ceremony approached,  
Kaikeyi’s mind is slowly poisoned by her  
maid, **Manthara**. Manthara convinces  
Kaikeyi that after Rama has been  
crowned the heir-apparent, she and  
Bharata will be treated as little more  
than chattel, or objects, if they are  
allowed to live at all.  
Kaikeyi’s concern for her son leads  
her to drastic action. Many years before,  
Dasharatha gave Kaikeyi two boons, or  
rewards, for her help in winning a great  
battle. She has never redeemed these  
boons, but now demands that  
Dasharatha exile Rama to the forest for  
fourteen years and crown Bharata as  
ruler in his place. Dasharatha pleads  
with Kaikeyi, but she does not change  
her mind. He is finally forced to grant  
her wish. Kaikeyi’s request brings her  
disgrace not only from her husband,  
who curses her for separating him from  
Rama, but also from her son. Bharata  
rebukes Kaikeyi for depriving Rama of  
what is rightfully his, and refuses to rule  
until Rama orders him to serve in his  
place during the exile. The only person  
who does not condemn her is Rama,  
whom the epic portrays as serenely  
happy to obey his parents’ commands,  
whatever they might be.
