title = "Krittikas"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the Krittikas are a  
group of six minor goddesses who are  
the personification of the constellation  
Pleiades. Their important mythic  
appearance is as the foster mothers of  
the god **Skanda**. Skanda is considered  
the son of the god **Shiva**, but is born in  
an unusual way. When Shiva and **Parvati**  
are disturbed while making love, Shiva  
inadvertently spills his **semen** on the  
ground. In Indian culture semen is seen  
as a man’s concentrated essence.  
Because he is a **deity**, Shiva’s semen is  
inordinately powerful, capable of  
destroying the **earth**. The semen is first  
held by the god **Agni**, who is **fire** personified, but it proves too powerful for him.  
Agni puts the semen in the river **Ganges**.  
After 10,000 years, a shining child is discovered in the reeds along the riverbank.  
The child is discovered by the Krittikas,  
each of whom wants to nurse him. To  
oblige them, the child Skanda grows five  
extra heads. As a mark of their care, one  
of his epithets is **Karttikeya**.
