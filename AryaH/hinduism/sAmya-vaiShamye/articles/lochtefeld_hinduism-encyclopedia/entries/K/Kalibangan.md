title = "Kalibangan"

+++
Archeological site in the western state of  
**Rajasthan**, a short distance from the  
border with Pakistan. Kalibangan is one  
of the cities of the **Indus Valley**  
**Civilization** and is part of cluster of  
cities in what many archaeologists  
believe was the **Saraswati River** valley,  
although at present the river disappears  
into the desert. The site at Kalibangan is  
nearly as large as the cities at **Harappa**,  
**Mohenjo-Daro**, and **Lothal**. The city  
plan is virtually identical to the others,  
thus revealing the scope of this mysterious ancient culture.
