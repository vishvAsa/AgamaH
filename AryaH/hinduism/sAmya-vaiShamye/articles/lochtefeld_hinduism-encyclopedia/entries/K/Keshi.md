title = "Keshi"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Keshi is one of the  
assassins sent by **Kamsa**, the **demon**king of **Mathura**, in an attempt to kill his  
nephew, the child-god **Krishna**. In the  
form of a savage horse, Keshi attacks  
364  
Kena (“By Whom?”) Upanishad  
Krishna. Krishna easily fends him off  
and kills him, earning himself the name  
of **Keshimanthana**, “destroyer of Keshi.”
