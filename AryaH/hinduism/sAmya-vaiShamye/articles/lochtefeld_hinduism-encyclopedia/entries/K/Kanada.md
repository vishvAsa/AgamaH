(2nd c. B.C.E.?) Philosopher who is traditionally named as the author of the  
**Vaisheshika Sutras** and founder of the  
Vaisheshika philosophical school, one of  
**six schools** of Hindu **philosophy**.  
Kanadaâ€™s date is uncertain, but he is  
believed to have lived after the third  
century B.C.E. In its earliest form, the  
Vaisheshika school followed a doctrine  
of atomism, asserting that there are simple building blocks that cohere to form  
complex objects. This cohesion also  
attaches objects to their qualities. As  
Vaisheshika combined with the **Nyaya**  
school, another of the six schools, the  
Vaisheshikas gradually adopted the  
Nyaya idea of God as the regulating  
force behind these atomic relations.
