title = "Kunti"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Kunti is the elder wife  
of King **Pandu**, and the mother of  
**Yudhishthira**, **Arjuna**, and **Bhima**.  
None of these children are actually  
Pandu’s sons; they have been magically  
conceived through the effect of a  
**mantra** given to Kunti by the sage  
**Durvasas**. The mantra gives the woman  
who recites it the power to call down any  
of the gods and conceive a son equal in  
power to the god himself.  
Kunti receives this mantra before her  
marriage. In a moment of youthful  
impulsiveness, she recites it while looking at the **sun**. She is immediately visited  
by a shining figure who leaves her with  
an equally shining son. Distraught and  
desperate at the **birth** of this illegitimate  
child, she puts him in a box and abandons him in the **Ganges** River. The child  
is adopted by the charioteer **Adhiratha**  
and grows up to be the heroic **Karna**.  
Kunti’s other three sons are born  
after her marriage, with Pandu’s blessing: Yudhishthira from the god  
**Dharma**, who is righteousness personified; Arjuna from the storm-god  
**Indra**; and Bhima from the **wind**-god  
**Vayu**. Although these three grow up to  
be heroic and kingly figures, they  
develop a violent hatred for Karna  
because of his unknown parentage.  
One of the *Mahabharata*’s tragic  
themes is this bitter rivalry between  
men who do not know they are brothers. Their hostility is especially difficult  
for Kunti, aware of Karna’s identity. She  
knows that the problems are rooted in  
her impulsiveness and cowardice. On  
the eve of the great Mahabharata war  
she goes to Karna, reveals his identity  
to him, imploring him to return and  
fight with his brothers. Karna refuses,  
saying that he has taken a vow to kill  
Arjuna, but he will not harm her other  
sons. After the war Kunti becomes a  
recluse, living in the forest with several  
other people of her generation. After  
living there for some years, she is killed  
in a forest fire.
