In traditional Hindu social theory, the  
kshatriyas were the second most influential of the four major social groups  
(**varnas**). The kshatriyas’ function was  
ruling, protecting, and creating social  
order so that the other varnas could  
carry out their tasks. This image is  
reflected in the creation story known as  
the **Purusha Sukta**. The kshatriyas are  
described as being created from the  
Primeval Man’s shoulders and associated with strength and power. In actual  
practice, the kshatriya **varna** may have  
been the most permeable of all, since  
any person with the power to rule was  
usually given *de facto* kshatriya status,  
which could be solidified by a fictitious  
genealogy in the following generations.  
Perhaps the best example of this phenomenon is the subgroup known as the  
**Rajputs** (“king’s **sons**”), who at varying
