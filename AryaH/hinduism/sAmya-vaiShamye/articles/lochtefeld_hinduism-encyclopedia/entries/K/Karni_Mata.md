title = "Karni Mata"

+++
Presiding **deity** of the temple by the  
same name in the village of **Deshnok** in  
the state of **Rajasthan**. Karni Mata is a  
local form of the Mother **Goddess**; her  
name refers to the place where an ear  
(karni) of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to earth. The temple is unusual in  
that it is inhabited by thousands of rats,  
which are considered Karni Mata’s sons.  
According to the local tradition, Karni  
Mata’s son drowned in a local pond.  
When she tried to influence **Yama**, the  
god of death, to give her son a favorable  
rebirth, she was told that he had already  
been reborn as a **rat**. At her request,  
Yama allowed all of her male descendants to be born as rats in the temple at  
Deshnok. Yama agreed that in the next  
life the rats would be reborn as family  
members of the temple’s servants.  
According to this myth, the rats and the  
temple priests are all members of one  
extended family.
