title = "Kuchipudi"

+++
One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are  
**Bharatanatyam**, **Kathak**, **Orissi**,  
**Kathakali**, and **Manipuri**. Like much of  
traditional Indian culture, classical  
dance shows strong regional identification; Kuchipudi is primarily found in  
**Andhra Pradesh**. As with much of  
Indian dance, Kuchipudi has its roots in  
religious life. It was developed in the village of Kuchipudi as part of a religious  
festival. The Maharaja of Golconda was  
so pleased with the dance that he  
awarded the village as a gift to the **brahmin** families there, with the condition  
that they continue to nurture the art,  
which their descendants have done.  
Stylistically, the dance shows the influence of Bharatanatyam, and like all  
Indian dance, it shows the well-developed  
vocabulary of **gesture** that is drawn from  
the classical manuals. At the same time,  
the form is softer and less geometric  
than Bharatanatyam, showing the  
influence of folk traditions. The language for the dance-dramas is Telegu,  
reflecting the local culture. As with all  
classical dances, Kuchipudi has undergone certain changes in the past generation, spurred by the shift to stage  
performance as the danceâ€™s primary  
venue. One of the most significant  
376  
Kshemaraja  
changes has been to open the dance to  
women. For further information see
