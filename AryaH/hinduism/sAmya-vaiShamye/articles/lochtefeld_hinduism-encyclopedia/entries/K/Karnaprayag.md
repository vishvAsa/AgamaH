Himalayan town and sacred site (**tirtha**)  
at the confluence of the **Alakananda**  
and **Pindara** rivers, in the Chamoli district of the state of **Uttar Pradesh**. As  
with all the other river junctions in the  
**Garhwal** region, this is considered an  
especially holy place. Local tradition  
ascribes the siteâ€™s name to the  
**Mahabharata** hero **Karna**, who is  
believed to have worshiped the **sun**  
at this place. In return he received a  
suit of armor that could not be pierced  
and a quiver of arrows that could  
never be exhausted.
