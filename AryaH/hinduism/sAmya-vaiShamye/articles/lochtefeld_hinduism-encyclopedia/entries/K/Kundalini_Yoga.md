power that exists in every person.  
Through a combination of yoga practice  
and ritual action, it is believed that the  
kundalini is awakened and rises through  
the **chakras** in the **subtle body**. This  
action brings further spiritual capacities  
and, ultimately, final liberation (**moksha**) of the soul. One of the claims for  
kundalini yoga is that it is much quicker  
than other means of spiritual development, harnessing more powerful forces.  
For this same reason, it is viewed as  
more hazardous, and should be done  
only under the supervision of oneâ€™s religious preceptor (**guru**). According to  
tradition, those who engage these forces  
without proper supervision risk  
unleashing forces they cannot control,  
possibly bringing on insanity or death.
