title = "Kshanika (“momentary”) Linga"

+++
A type of **linga**, the pillar-shaped object  
symbolizing the god **Shiva**. A kshanika  
linga is temporarily made for immediate  
**worship**, from whatever materials are at  
hand—whether earth, sand, grain, butter, or any other substance that can be  
heaped and molded. This use of temporary images reveals an important aspect  
of Hindu religious life—that although  
God is everywhere, many human beings  
tend to work better when they have a  
concrete focus for their religious attention. This being so, God deigns to come  
into the humblest objects, if they are  
created with him (or her) in mind.
