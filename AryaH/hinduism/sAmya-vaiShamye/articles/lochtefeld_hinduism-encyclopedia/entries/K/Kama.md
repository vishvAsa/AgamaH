title = "Kama"

(2) Minor **deity** identified as the personification of kama (“desire”). Kama is  
comparable to the Greek deity Eros and  
carries similar responsibility for igniting  
human sexual attraction and sensual  
desire. Kama is represented as a young  
man riding on a parrot, armed with a  
bow and arrows. The bow is a stalk of  
sugar cane, the bowstring a line of  
buzzing bees; his five arrows are five different flowers, each bringing a different  
emotional effect to the person it pierces.  
The five flowers and emotions are: lotus,  
infatuation; **ashoka**, intoxication (with  
love); mango, exhaustion; jasmine, pining; blue lotus, paralysis. Kama’s iconography carries strong associations with  
spring, and the spring **season** (personified as another minor deity, Vasant) is  
perceived as Kama’s friend and ally in  
awakening desire through the regeneration of the natural world and the showy  
display of spring blossoms.  
The most famous episode in Kama’s  
mythology begins with the ascent to  
power of a **demon** named **Taraka**, who  
can only be killed by a son of **Shiva**.  
Taraka seems impossible to defeat, since  
Shiva has no sons and is in deep meditation, grieving over the death of his wife  
**Sati**. The other gods ask Kama to shoot  
Shiva with an arrow of desire so he will  
marry the **goddess Parvati** and produce  
a son. Kama creeps up on Shiva and  
shoots him with an arrow. When Shiva  
realizes who has disturbed his meditation, he releases a stream of fire from the  
third eye in the middle of his forehead,  
instantly burning Kama to ashes.  
Through Shiva’s **grace**, Kama is eventually brought back to life. One of Kama’s  
epithets or alternate names is Ananga,  
or “bodiless,” because of the loss of his  
340  
Kalpeshvar  
body (and the fact that desire seems to  
strike in unseen ways). Despite being  
destroyed by Shiva and seemingly foiled,  
in the end Kama achieves his goal. His  
attempt to draw Shiva out of his meditation succeeds, and eventually Shiva  
marries Parvati. For more information

Kama, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty,  
*Siva*, 1981.
