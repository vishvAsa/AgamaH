title = "Kalighat"

+++
Temple dedicated to the goddess **Kali** in  
the southern section of modern  
Calcutta. This temple is several hundred  
years old and is considered one of the  
most important temples in Calcutta.  
The city’s name is supposedly an  
anglicized version of the temple’s name.  
Local tradition claims that Kalighat  
is one of the **Shakti Pithas**, a network  
of sites sacred to the **Goddess**. Each  
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body  
part of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to **earth**, taking form there as a  
different goddess; in the case of  
Kalighat the body part was one of Sati’s  
toes. See also **pitha**.
