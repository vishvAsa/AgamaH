title = "Kumbhakonam"

+++
One of the many temple-towns in the  
**Tanjore** district of the state of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, reflecting the district’s importance as the home of the **Chola dynasty**  
kings. Kumbhakonam has several large  
temples. Built in the **Dravida** architectural style, the temple buildings are of  
modest height, cover an immensely  
large area, and are surrounded by a  
boundary wall with massive towers  
(**gopurams**) over each wall’s central  
gateway. Kumbhakonam’s most famous  
site is not a temple, but a temple bathing  
(**snana**) tank. A festival is held at the  
tank every twelve years, at which time  
the water in the tank is believed to  
become the **Ganges**. An estimated  
400,000 people attended this event in  
1992; tragically, forty-eight people were  
killed in a stampede. Outside the town is  
the **Swami Malai** temple, one of the six  
temples to the god **Skanda**.
