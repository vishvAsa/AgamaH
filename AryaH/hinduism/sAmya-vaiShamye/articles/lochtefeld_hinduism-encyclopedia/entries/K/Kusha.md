In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Kusha is one of the  
twin sons of **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist. After their mother, **Sita**, has been  
cast into exile at the **ashram** of the sage  
**Valmiki**, Kusha is born in an unusual  
fashion. One day when Sita takes her  
son **Lava** to bathe in the river, Valmiki  
notices that the child is gone and fears  
that it has been seized by a wild animal.  
To spare Sita’s motherly feelings, he  
creates an identical child out of  
kusha grass. When Sita returns with  
Lava, his twin is given the name  
Kusha. Later, Lava and Kusha go with  
Valmiki to Rama’s court in **Ayodhya**.  
It is in Rama’s court that they first  
recite the epic poem composed by  
Valmiki, the *Ramayana*. After Rama  
gives up his throne, he divides his  
kingdom between Lava and Kusha.
