+++
(“**son** of the Krttikas”) Epithet of the god  
**Skanda**, considered the son of **Shiva**.  
Skanda is not born in the usual manner  
but develops when **Shiva’s semen** falls  
into the **Ganges** River. The name  
*Karttikeya* comes from the six minor goddesses known as the Krttikas, who are the  
deified form of the constellation Pleiades.  
After Skanda is born, these goddesses  
become his foster mothers and nurse  
him, which in Indian culture is believed to  
create a mother-child bond. So that none  
of the goddesses will feel slighted, Skanda  
sprouts six heads, allowing him to nurse  
from all of them at the same time.
