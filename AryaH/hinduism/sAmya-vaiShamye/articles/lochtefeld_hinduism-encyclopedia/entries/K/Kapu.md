Traditional Indian society was modeled  
as a collection of **endogamous**, or intermarried, subgroups known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). These jatis were organized  
(and their social status determined) by  
the group’s hereditary occupation, over  
which each group held a monopoly. In  
traditional society, the Kapus were farmers. In much of modern **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**, particularly the region bordering modern **Tamil Nadu**, the Kapus are  
the dominant landholding group.
