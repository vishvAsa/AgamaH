title = "Katha Upanishad"

+++
One of the later and more developed  
**Upanishads**, the speculative religious  
texts that form the latest stratum of the  
oldest Hindu sacred texts, the **Vedas**. As  
with most of the Upanishads, the Katha  
Upanishad investigates profound questions, in particular the nature of the Self  
(**atman**). The text tells the story of a  
boy, **Nachiketas**, whose father sends  
him to Death in a fit of anger.  
Nachiketas goes to Death’s abode, but  
finds no one. He waits for three days  
before Death returns. To make amends  
for ignoring a **brahmin** guest—which  
the text describes as a serious sin—  
Death gives Nachiketas three boons, or  
wishes. Nachiketas uses the first boon  
to be restored to his father’s house and  
the second to receive instruction in  
performing a sacrificial **fire**. With the  
final boon, he asks what happens to a  
person after the death of the body.  
Death first tries to evade the question,  
then tries to bribe Nachiketas with  
other gifts. When the boy insists on an  
answer, Death begins to reveal his  
secrets; these revelations make up the  
bulk of the text. Death’s secrets focus  
mainly on the reality of the Self, its eternal and indestructible nature, its subtle  
qualities, and the difficulties in realizing it. The Self is the ultimate truth, and  
to know it is to know the only thing that  
really matters.
