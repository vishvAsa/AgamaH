title = "Kurukshetra"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the northern part of the state of **Haryana**, about  
ninety miles due north of Delhi. In  
Hindu mythology, Kurukshetra is the  
site of the climactic battle in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics. This battle is still discussed  
as if it was a recent event. Kurukshetra is  
also famous as a bathing (**snana**) place.  
A bathing pool attracts hundreds of  
thousands of pilgrims during **eclipses**,  
at which time it is believed to contain all  
the sacred waters of India.
