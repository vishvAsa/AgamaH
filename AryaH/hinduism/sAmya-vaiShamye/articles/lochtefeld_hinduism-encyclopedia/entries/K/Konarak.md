Village on the Bay of Bengal in the state  
of **Orissa**, about forty miles east of the  
state capital, **Bhubaneshvar**. Konarak is  
famous for its **Sun Temple**. Now in  
ruins, the temple was built by king  
Narasimhadeva (r. 1238–1264), a  
monarch in the **Ganga dynasty**. The  
entire temple was intended to be a likeness of the sun’s chariot. Twelve great  
wheels were carved on the sides at the  
temple’s lowest level; in front of the temple are statues of several colossal horses.  
As at **Khajuraho**, the temple’s lower levels are covered with **erotic** carvings, giving rise to diverse interpretations: Some  
claim the carvings sanction carnal pleasure as a religious path, while some  
interpret them allegorically as representing human union with the divine.  
Others view them as teaching that the  
desire for pleasure must ultimately be  
transcended to attain the divine.  
The temple was built on a massive  
scale. According to one estimate, the  
massive central spire would have been  
over 200 feet high. It is uncertain  
whether this spire was ever completed,  
since the sandy soil at its base would  
have been unable to support the weight  
of such an enormous structure. This  
unstable soil has been the greatest  
contributor to the temple’s increasing  
deterioration. The primary structure left  
at the site is the **jagamohan** (assembly  
hall). During the nineteenth century,  
the hall was filled with sand in an  
effort to prevent further collapse. For
