title = "Khandava Forest"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, the Khandava forest  
is consumed by **Agni**, a god whose material form is **fire** itself. According to the  
story, Agni becomes sick and is advised  
that he can only be healed by eating the  
creatures in the Khandava forest, many  
of whom are enemies of the gods. Agni  
makes seven attempts to “eat” the forest,  
but is always thwarted by the storm-god  
**Indra**, who rescues the forest by dousing  
it with rain. Agni is perplexed and solicits the help of the god **Krishna** and his  
companion **Arjuna**, the world’s greatest  
archer. To help Agni, Arjuna is given the  
**Gandiva** bow and an inexhaustible  
quiver of arrows. When Agni again  
begins to burn the forest, Arjuna keeps  
off the rain by shooting a flight of  
arrows so thick that it forms a canopy  
over the forest. In this way Agni is cured  
of his illness.
