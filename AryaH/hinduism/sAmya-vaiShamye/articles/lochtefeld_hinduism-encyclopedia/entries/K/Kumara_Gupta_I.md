title = "Kumara Gupta I"

+++
(r. 415–454) The fourth important ruler  
of the **Gupta dynasty**, who managed to  
keep his northern Indian empire intact  
for most of his reign. At the end of his  
reign, he had to contend with incursions  
in the west by the central Asians, known  
as the Hunas. While in battle with them,  
he was killed. Pressure from the Hunas  
continued in the years following  
Kumara Gupta’s death and was one of  
the important factors causing the eventual collapse of the Gupta empire several generations later.
