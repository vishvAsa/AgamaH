title = "Krishnadas"

+++
(early 16th c.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions  
of these eight poets were used for  
liturgical purposes by the **Pushti**  
**Marg**, a religious community of devotees (**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. In the  
Pushti Marg’s sectarian literature, all  
eight are also named as members of  
the community and as associates of  
either the community’s founder,  
**Vallabhacharya**, or his successor  
**Vitthalnath**. Traditionally, Krishnadas  
is associated with Vallabhacharya. Little  
is known about Krishnadas, although  
traditional accounts hold that he was  
born in 1497. His poetry describes the  
physical beauty of Krishna as an object  
of aesthetic enjoyment. Within the  
Pushti Marg, he is remembered as a  
capable administrator and a defender of  
the sect’s interests in **Brindavan**,  
372  
Krishnadas  
Krishna’s childhood home, against the  
followers of **Chaitanya**.
