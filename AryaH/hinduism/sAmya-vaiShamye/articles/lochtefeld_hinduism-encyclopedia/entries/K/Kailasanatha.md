title = "Kailasanatha"

+++
The largest and most famous of the  
rock-cut temples at **Ellora** in the state of  
**Maharashtra**; the temple is dedicated to  
the god **Shiva** in his form as the “Lord of  
Mount **Kailas**.” The temple was constructed late in the eighth century by  
kings of the **Rashtrakuta dynasty** and  
completed during the reign of Krishna I.  
The Kailasanatha temple is modeled  
after other contemporary temples: its  
main elements are an outer gateway, an  
assembly hall, and a central shrine  
(**garbhagrha**) surrounded by a processional path (**pradakshina**) to smaller  
shrines. It is set on a high platform base  
topped with a ninety-six-foot-high spire  
representing Mount Kailas in the  
**Himalayas** and covered with decorative  
carving. The amazing point about this  
temple is that the entire structure is a  
**sculpture**—workers carved it out of a  
single rock outcropping, starting at the  
top and working down. It is estimated  
that during construction, the builders  
had to remove three million cubic feet of  
stone from the temple and the excavated  
courtyards surrounding it. See also
