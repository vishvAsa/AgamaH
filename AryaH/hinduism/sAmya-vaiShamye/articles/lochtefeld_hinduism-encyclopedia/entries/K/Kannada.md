One of the four **Dravidian** languages,  
along with **Tamil**, Telegu, and  
Malayalam; all four languages are spoken in southern India. Kannada is the  
predominant language in modern  
**Karnataka**, one of the “linguistic” states,  
formed after Indian independence in  
1947 to unite people with a common  
language and culture under one state  
government. Despite its recent political  
significance, Kannada has a long history  
as a literary and cultural language and is  
particularly important as the language  
for the devotional (**bhakti**) poetry of the  
**Lingayat** religious community. See also  
**Tamil language**.
