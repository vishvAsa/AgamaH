title = "Krishna"

+++
Hindu **deity** usually considered as the  
eighth **avatar** or incarnation of the god  
**Vishnu**; in certain religious contexts,  
however, as in the **Gitagovinda**, he is  
described as the ultimate deity and the  
source of all the avatars. In either case,  
Krishna is one of the major deities in the  
modern Hindu pantheon. Part of his  
popularity may stem from the extraordinary breadth of his manifestations,  
allowing his devotees (**bhakta**) to **worship** him in many different ways. His  
earliest appearance comes in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics, where he is a friend and  
adviser to the five **Pandava** brothers  
who are the epic’s protagonists. His epic  
portrayal is highly complex, and his  
character is not always truthful or good.  
He is a regal king and heroic warrior, a  
cunning opponent, and a Machiavellian  
politician with his own underlying  
agenda. Here Krishna plays the role of  
a trickster, although late in the story,  
in the section of the epic known as  
the **Bhagavad Gita**, he eventually drops  
the mask to reveal himself as the  
supreme deity.  
The later sectarian literature, particularly the **Harivamsha** and the  
**Bhagavata Purana**, virtually ignore  
this exalted, royal figure, preferring to  
concentrate on Krishna’s birth, childhood, and adolescence. This latter  
stratum of Krishna’s mythology has  
been clearly imposed on the earlier,  
heroic image, rendering Krishna a character with unusual mythic depth.  
Religiously speaking, the image of  
Krishna as child and lover has been far  
more important than the stern and  
somewhat amoral hero.  
The characters in the story of  
Krishna’s life, including his parents,  
friends, and companions, are not aware  
of his divinity, and throughout the story  
they confront many surprises and bewildering events. However, none of these  
plot twists surprise the readers, since  
they are aware that all of the characters  
are taking part in Krishna’s divine play  
(**lila**). According to tradition, Krishna is  
the eighth **son** of **Devaki** and **Vasudeva**.  
He is born in a prison in the city of  
**Mathura**, where his parents have been  
confined by his uncle, the wicked king  
**Kamsa**. On Devaki’s wedding day, a  
divine voice warns Kamsa that her  
eighth child will eventually kill him. In  
an effort to forestall this prophecy, he  
puts the couple in prison, and kills all of  
370  
Kratu  
Devaki’s children as soon as they are  
born. Kamsa intends to do the same  
with Krishna, but when Krishna is born,  
a deep sleep falls on all the jailers, the  
locked prison doors are miraculously  
opened, and Vasudeva is able to spirit  
the infant out of the prison to the home  
of his foster parents, **Nanda** and  
**Yashoda**. Vasudeva returns that night,  
bearing Yashoda’s newborn baby girl,  
who is really **Bhadrakali**, the **Goddess**,  
in disguise. The next morning Kamsa  
kills the child by dashing it against a  
stone. From the body arises the Goddess,  
who taunts Kamsa, telling him that the  
person who will slay him has escaped.  
Krishna lives happily at Nanda and  
Yashoda’s home. His mythic images  
from that early time stress either his persona as the adorable child or unexpected  
feats of strength and heroism. As an  
infant he is placed under a cart, which  
he strikes with his foot and kicks into the  
air; he also slays a variety of **demon**  
assassins sent by his uncle Kamsa, most  
notably **Putana**, **Keshi**, and **Trnavarta**.  
During all these feats his companions  
are amazed but never realize that divinity is in their midst. Nor, for that matter,  
do his foster parents. In one story  
Yashoda looks in Krishna’s mouth when  
he has been eating some dirt and sees  
the entire universe inside it. Through  
the workings of Krishna’s power of illusion (**maya**), she immediately forgets  
the whole incident. The themes of forgetfulness and hidden divinity are central to Krishna’s childhood mythology.  
The people in **Braj** treat Krishna with  
easy familiarity, because they are  
unaware of his true identity. Krishna is  
said to prefer this sort of natural interaction over all other worship.  
As a boy Krishna becomes known for  
his mischief, particularly his penchant  
for stealing butter from the **gopis** (milkmaids), although when he is caught he  
can usually manage to charm his way  
out of punishment. His adolescence is  
marked by two heroic episodes—driving  
off the serpent **Kaliya**, and defeating the  
storm-god **Indra** by holding up Mt.  
**Govardhan**—and by the development of  
his persona as a lover. On moonlit,  
autumn nights, he plays his flute **Murali**  
on the banks of the **Yamuna River**.  
Hearing its irresistible call, the village  
women rush to meet him, whiling away  
the night in the circle **dance** known as  
the **ras lila**. Although she is not mentioned in the earliest texts, **Radha**  
appears as Krishna’s special companion  
and consort, symbolizing the relationship between deity and devotee using  
the imagery of lover and beloved.  
Some parts of Krishna’s mythology  
relate episodes from later in his life,  
including his return to Mathura, the  
slaying of Kamsa, taking his rightful  
place as ruler, and marrying **Rukmini**  
and a host of other wives. The earlier  
strands of his mythic identity—the king,  
hero, and cunning diplomat portrayed  
in the *Mahabharata*—can be tied in  
here, to make it seem like the account of  
a single life. Some of the most poignant  
devotional (**bhakti**) poetry details the  
exchange between Krishna’s female  
devotees, the gopis, and **Uddhava**,  
Krishna’s companion sent back from  
371  
Krishna  
Depiction of Krishna, an incarnation  
of the god Vishnu.  
Mathura. Uddhava reassures them that  
Krishna is the indwelling God and is  
omnipresent. For the gopis, this abstract  
concept is a poor substitute for the  
sweet boy they know so well. Their  
attention remains focused on the  
charming child of Braj, who never grows  
up, never grows old, and who invites his  
devotees to share his world.  
The worship of Krishna emphasizes  
relationship and communion, both  
with the deity and one another. In the  
most elaborate forms of worship,  
Krishna’s devotees envision themselves  
as entering Krishna’s world and spending the day doing the ordinary activities  
of a village cowhand, such as getting up,  
eating, taking the cows to pasture,  
and bringing home the cows. Some  
devotional manuals give detailed daily  
calendars, for which the devotees  
can visualize themselves going to particular places and doing particular  
things at certain times—building a relationship with God through sharing the  
mundane parts of everyday life.  
Another common practice is communal  
singing, usually collections of the divine  
names known as **kirtans**, as a way to  
build relationships and communion  
among the devotees.  
Another feature of Krishna’s character and worship is the notion of lila or  
“play.” As David R. Kinsley points out,  
the infant Krishna dispatches the demon  
assassins as a form of play, and they  
never pose any serious threat. His relationship with the people of Braj is also a  
sort of play. He comes as the divine presence in their midst, but keeps them  
completely unaware of this, occasionally hinting at it through his wondrous  
deeds, but unwilling to ruin their natural interactions with him by revealing  
their difference in status. In the same  
way, he is believed to be active in the  
lives of his devotees, always present, but  
dropping only teasing hints of his presence. Finally, lila is the name for a series  
of dramas performed during the **monsoon season** in the town of **Brindavan**.  
These productions, known as the ras lila,  
are not mere drama but combine both  
liturgy and drama. Krishna and his companions are played by local **brahmin**  
boys. While in costume, the boys are  
believed to have become the characters  
they portray. Part of the program is worship. The players, known as **svarups**  
(“own-forms”), gather on stage to give  
**darshan** to the audience. The most  
common religious act in modern popular Hinduism, darshan allows direct eye  
contact between the devotee and the  
image of a deity, which is considered to  
be a conscious, perceiving being. The  
second part of the program is the lila, a  
rendition of some episode in Krishna’s  
mythology. The audience participates  
by virtue of its presence, making  
Krishna’s lila part of present-day experience by performing or attending these  
productions. Given his stature as a  
Hindu deity, there are many works on  
Krishna. For further information see
