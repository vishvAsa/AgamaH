(“sword”) In Hindu iconography, the  
sword is an object associated with a  
variety of **deities**. It carries strong associations with **Kali**, symbolizing the cutting off of her devotees’ (**bhakta**)  
ignorance. Sometimes it is literally used  
to cut off heads of the **animals** sacrificed  
to her. The sword is also carried by other  
images of the **Goddess**, including **Durga**  
and **Santoshi Ma**, as well as certain  
images of **Shiva** and **Vishnu**.
