title = "Karandamakuta"

+++
(“basket-crown”) A small crown in the  
shape of a basket, notable for its lack of  
ornamentation. In Hindu art, the karandamakuta is the head covering worn by  
a lesser **deity**. In contrast, the **kiritamakuta** worn by the god **Vishnu** is  
much larger and more elaborately decorated, in keeping with his status as one  
of the predominant deities in Hindu  
religious life.
