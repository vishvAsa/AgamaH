title = "Kathakali"

+++
One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are  
**Bharatanatyam**, **Orissi**, **Kuchipudi**,  
**Kathak**, and **Manipuri**. Like much of  
traditional Indian culture, classical  
dances are identified with certain  
regions; Kathakali is primarily found  
in **Kerala**. Unlike many of the other  
classical forms, Kathakali did not  
develop in a temple setting. It  
appeared as a developed style in the  
seventeenth century, although it is  
rooted in folk and religious dramas  
dating from centuries before.  
Kathakali has traditionally been  
danced only by men—the **women’s**  
form in Kerala is **Mohini Attam**. A  
Kathakali performance is one of the  
most dramatic spectacles in the  
Indian arts. Part of this drama comes  
from the dancers’ training, stressing  
controlled facial mobility to facilitate  
ease and power of expression. The  
dancers wear flamboyant costumes  
and headdresses. The most striking  
feature of all is elaborate makeup—  
the heroes’ faces are painted a vivid  
green, with fluted ridges made of rice  
paste attached to their cheeks, while  
villains are painted in green and red  
and have knobs of pith attached to  
their chins and foreheads. Stylistically,  
the dance moves between athletic  
jumps and majestic turns, with religious texts forming the dominant  
source for stories. As with all Indian  
dances, Kathakali has a well-developed “vocabulary” of **gesture** and  
facial expression, which makes it possible for the dancers to engage in  
complex storytelling. As with all other  
classical dances, Kathakali has undergone certain changes in the past generation, spurred by a shift in the  
venue from temple courtyards to  
stage performance. For example, a  
planned stage performance requires a  
well-organized “program” and a designated time frame, whereas in earlier  
times Kathakali performances would  
often last all night long. For further information see Mohan Khokar, *Traditions of*
