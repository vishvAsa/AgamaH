title = "Kulachara"

(“family practice”) Any religious practice  
restricted to a family, either a group of  
blood relatives or people sharing a common religious or sectarian lineage. The  
authority given to kulachara allows for  
almost infinite variation in religious  
practice, particularly in the absence of  
any established religious hierarchy  
which has the authority to render judgments on such practices. For most  
Hindus, such family practice is the predominant influence shaping their individual religious lives.
