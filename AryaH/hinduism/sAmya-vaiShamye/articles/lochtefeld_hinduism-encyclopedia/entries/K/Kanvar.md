title = "Kanvar"

+++
A bamboo pole with baskets or receptacles suspended from each end. In earlier  
times a kanvar would have been a natural  
way for people to carry heavy loads. Its  
major use today is for religious rites in  
which pilgrims carry **water** from one  
place to offer to a **deity** in another. The  
kanvar is the device by which the water  
is kept elevated the entire way. This  
keeps the waterâ€™s original **purity** unbroken, preserving it as an appropriate  
**offering** for a deity. The most famous  
example of this rite is at the temple of  
**Vaidyanath** in the state of **Bihar**. It is  
also found at temples in **Haridwar** in  
**Uttar Pradesh**, **Tarakeshvar** in **West**  
**Bengal**, and the hills of **Maharashtra**.
