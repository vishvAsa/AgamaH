title = "Kshemaraja"

+++
(11th c.) Kshemaraja was the primary  
disciple of **Abhinavagupta**, the  
Kashmiri writer famous for his works on  
poetics and aesthetics, and a pivotal figure in the development of **Trika**  
Shaivism. Based on a tantric philosophy, Trika Shaivism states that the sole  
true reality is the god **Shiva**, who is both  
supreme god and the source of the emanations that constitute the material of  
the universe. Final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**) comes through a process of  
“recognition” (**pratyabhijna**) in which  
one realizes that the entire universe is  
all a manifestation of Shiva alone.  
Here one “recognizes” something that  
has always been true, but until that  
time has been obscured by a mistaken  
understanding. Kshemaraja continued the development of the Trika  
school. His most famous work is the  
*Svacchandatantra*. See also **tantra**.
