Small village in the Chattarpur district of  
the northern state of **Madhya Pradesh**,  
renowned for a magnificent collection  
of temples built about a thousand years  
ago by the **Chandella dynasty**. It is  
unclear why these temples were built in  
such an inaccessible place, although its  
remote location is believed to have  
spared the temples from iconoclasm  
during Muslim incursions. The most  
famous Hindu temples at the site are the  
**Kandariya Mahadev**, **Lakshmana**, and  
**Vishvanath**. There are many smaller  
temples to other Hindu **deities** and several Jain temples as well.  
The temples at Khajuraho were built  
in the northern Indian **Nagara** style. The  
building replicates a sacred mountain  
with the highest point directly over the  
primary image. The outside of the temples were decorated with sculptural  
images, and the most famous of these  
depict women in various explicit sexual  
encounters. The significance of the **erotic**  
sculptures is much debated. Some claim  
that the sculptures sanction carnal pleasure as a religious path, while some  
interpret them to represent human  
union with the divine. Still others view  
them as teaching that the desire for

Khajuraho  
pleasure must be transcended to attain  
the divine. For further information see
