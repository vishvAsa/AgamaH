title = "Kamandalu"

+++
A water pot traditionally used by  
**ascetics**, usually having a removable lid  
for ease in filling and a spout for pouring. Kamandalus may be made from  
various materials, such as gourds, wood,  
metal, or baked clay. They are generally  
wider than they are tall, making them  
stable and less likely to tip over. In  
India’s climate, water is an obvious  
necessity. Even ascetics with very few  
**possessions** will generally have some  
means to carry and store it. Aside from  
satisfying their physical needs, water is  
an important element in ascetic religious life, since it is often an **offering**  
used in **worship** as well as the preferred  
medium for bathing (**snana**) and other  
rites of purification. This religious  
importance makes the kamandalu a  
powerful object in its own right. A  
kamandalu is considered especially significant when it has been used for years  
by a noted ascetic—objects kept in close  
proximity to such a person are believed  
to be charged with their spiritual power.  
In modern times, kamandalus are still  
important ritual objects, but their practical function has largely been replaced  
by screw-top plastic vessels.
