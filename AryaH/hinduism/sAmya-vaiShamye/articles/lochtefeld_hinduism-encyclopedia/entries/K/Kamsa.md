title = "Kamsa"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the wicked king of  
**Mathura** who is considered the brother of  
**Devaki**, the god **Krishna’s** mother, and  
thus Krishna’s uncle. According to legend, Kamsa is born when a **demon** takes  
the form of **Ugrasena**, Devaki’s father,  
and under this guise has intercourse  
with Kamsa’s mother.  
On Devaki’s wedding day, a divine  
voice warns Kamsa that his sister’s  
eighth child will eventually kill him. In  
an effort to prevent this prophecy, he  
kills all of Devaki’s children as soon as  
they are born. Yet on the night Krishna  
is born, a deep sleep falls over the  
inhabitants of the palace, the locked  
doors magically open, and the infant is  
spirited away to the home of his foster  
parents, **Nanda** and **Yashoda**. When  
Kamsa finds out what has happened,  
he first sends his men to kill all the  
newborn children in the country. When  
that attempt fails to destroy Krishna,  
Kamsa sends various demon assassins,  
such as **Putana**, **Shakata**, **Trnavarta**,  
**Keshi**, and **Bakasur**. Krishna dispatches  
all of these with ease, and Kamsa eventually has to try other strategies. He  
announces a grand festival and dispatches his chariot to pick up Krishna  
and his brother **Balarama**, who by  
then have grown into adolescents.  
Kamsa’s plan is to lure the brothers to  
the festival grounds where they can be  
killed in a “friendly” match with some  
experienced wrestlers. The two boys  
derail this plot by killing the wrestlers,  
after which Krishna leaps up into the  
royal box and kills Kamsa as well.
