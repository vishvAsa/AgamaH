Festival falling on the eleventh day  
(**ekadashi**) of the dark, waxing half of  
the **lunar month** of **Shravan**  
(July–August). As with all eleventh-day

Kamika Ekadashi  
A kamandalu is used to hold water  
for use in religious rites.  
dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**.  
Most Hindu festivals have certain  
prescribed rites usually involving fasting  
(**upavasa**) and worship, and often  
promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. The name Kamika means  
“desiring,” a theme supported by the  
charter myth. According to this story,  
the **brahmins** in a certain village  
refuse to perform religious rites for a  
landowner guilty of murdering another  
brahmin. The landowner is freed from  
that sin by observing the Kamika  
Ekadashi and is thus able to have the  
desired rites performed.
