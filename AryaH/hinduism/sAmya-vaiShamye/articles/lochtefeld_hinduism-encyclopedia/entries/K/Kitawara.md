One of four major organizational groups  
of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**; the other three  
divisions are **Bhuriwara**, **Bhogawara**,  
and **Anandawara**. Each of these  
groups has its headquarters in one of  
the four monastic centers (**maths**)  
supposedly established by philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. Each of the groups  
are associated with one of the four  
**Vedas**, one of the “great utterances”  
(**mahavakyas**) expressing the ultimate  
truth, a particular **ascetic** quality, and  
several of the ten Dashanami divisions.  
The Kitawara group is affiliated with the  
**Sharada math** in **Dwaraka**, and is thus

the temple was designed in the shape of the chariot believed to carry the sun.

India. The Kitawara’s Veda is the **Sama**  
**Veda**. Their mahavakya is “tattvamasi”  
(“That thou art”) and their ascetic quality  
is to eat very little. The Dashanami  
divisions associated with this group are  
**Tirtha** and **Ashrama**.
