title = "Kalika Devi"

+++
Name of both a shrine in the **Shiwalik**  
**Hills** (foothills of the **Himalayas**) and of  
its presiding **deity**. Kalika Devi is one of  
the nine **Shiwalik goddesses** and is  
believed to be a form of the **goddess**  
**Kali**. The temple itself is in the town of  
**Kalka**, on the road between the cities of  
Chandigarh and Simla. As is the  
case with many of the other Shiwalik  
goddesses, the image of Kalika Devi is a  
natural stone outcropping. This is considered a self-manifested (**svayambhu**)  
form of the **Goddess**. Unlike many of the  
other Shiwalik goddesses, the **Hindi** literature on this shrine does not claim  
that the temple is one of the **Shakti**  
**Pithas**, a network of sites sacred to the  
Goddess, mythically connected as  
places where a body part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth**. Instead,  
the literature simply commends the  
temple for its power and majesty. The  
literature does note, however, that local  
priests claim it as the place where Sati’s  
hair fell to earth. This illustrates both the  
influence that pamphlet literature can  
have in channeling pilgrim traffic and  
the need to tie one’s site into the network of the Shakti Pithas.  
The stone outcropping that forms  
Kalika Devi’s image is considered to be  
her head. According to tradition, Kali  
took the form of a beautiful woman and  
came to the temple to sing festive songs  
during the festival of **Navaratri**. The  
local monarch was so smitten by  
her voice and beauty that he asked  
her to marry him. Enraged at this insult,  
Kali cursed the king to lose his kingdom.  
As a further sign of her displeasure,  
she caused the temple image to begin  
sinking into the earth. At the plea of  
an ardent devotee, she allowed the  
head of the image to remain visible.
