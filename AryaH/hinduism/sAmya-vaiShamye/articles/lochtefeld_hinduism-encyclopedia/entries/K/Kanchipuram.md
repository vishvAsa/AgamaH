title = "Kanchipuram"

+++
Temple-town and sacred site (**tirtha**)  
about forty miles southwest of the city of  
Madras in the state of **Tamil Nadu**.  
Kanchipuram is important as one of  
India’s **Seven Sacred Cities**. Dying in  
one of these cities is believed to bring  
final liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
At differing times Kanchipuram served  
as a capital for the **Pallava**, **Chola**,  
and **Vijayanagar** kings; each of these  
dynasties left its mark in the city’s  
**architecture**. Kanchipuram is filled  
with temples, many of them  
magnificent examples of the southern  
Indian **Dravida** architectural style.  
Kanchipuram’s importance as a political  
center and its concentration of temples,  
brahmins, and scholars made it one of  
the greatest centers of Hindu life, learning, and religion.  
Kanchipuram is also noted for its  
temples to each of the three major  
Hindu **deities**—**Vishnu**, **Shiva**, and the  
**Goddess**. The Vaikuntaperumal Temple  
is dedicated to Vishnu in his form as  
“Lord of **Vaikuntha**,” his celestial realm.  
The Goddess is worshiped as Kamakshi  
(“desiring eyes”). Kamakshi is identified  
with the goddess **Kamakhya**, whose  
temple in **Assam** is the most powerful of  
all the **Shakti Pithas**.  
Shiva is worshiped at the  
Kailasanatha temple, in his manifestation as the “Lord of Mt. **Kailas**,” and at  
the Ekambareshvar temple. The image  
of Shiva at the former site is one of the  
**bhutalingas** (“elemental lingas”), a network of five southern Indian sites sacred  
to the god Shiva. In each of these sites  
Shiva is worshiped as a **linga**, the pillarshaped object that is his symbolic form.  
At each site the linga is believed to be  
formed from one of the five primordial  
**elements** (bhuta)—**earth**, **wind**, **fire**,  
**water**, and **space** (**akasha**). The  
Kanchipuram linga is associated with  
the element of earth, the humblest but  
most essential of all.  
Another reason for Kanchipuram’s  
prominence is its long tradition as a  
center for **asceticism**. Kanchipuram’s  
**Kamakotipith** is an ancient center for  
the **Dashanami** sect. Its leader is considered to be one of the **Shankaracharyas**,  
the most important contemporary  
Hindu leaders. According to local tradition the Kamakotipith was the first and  
most important of the **maths**, or monastic centers, established by the philosopher **Shankaracharya**, who later  
established four other centers at  
**Joshimath**, **Puri**, **Shringeri**, and  
**Dwaraka**. This claim to primacy has  
generated fierce controversy, with opponents not only denying Kamakotipith’s  
place as the first of the maths, but also  
asserting that Kamakotipith is only a  
branch of the Shringeri math. Some  
345  
Kanchipuram  
support for these claims can be drawn  
from symbolism connected with the  
number four—the four cardinal directions, the four sacred texts known as  
**Vedas**, and the four organizational  
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis  
themselves. The number four symbolizes completion and totality, which  
makes a fifth sacred center problematic.  
Kamakotipith reflects the importance of  
Kanchipuram as a significant sacred and  
political hub in which any **ascetic** center  
could gain considerable authority. See  
also **pitha**.
