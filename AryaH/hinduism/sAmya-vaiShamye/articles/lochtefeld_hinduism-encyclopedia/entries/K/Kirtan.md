title = "Kirtan"

+++
(“repeating”) A type of devotional  
singing or chanting of short verses  
which are usually different renditions of  
the divine name. This is often done in a  
367  
Kirtan  
call and response fashion—the leader  
sings one line, and the listeners repeat it.  
The primary emphasis in this rite is the  
repetition of the divine name. As the  
identifying mark of the divinity, the  
Name is believed to contain the **divine**  
**power**, benefiting those who hear it as  
well as those who speak it. Kirtan is  
especially popular among the devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, who historically have put greater stress on the theology of the Name. Kirtan is a common  
activity during congregational meetings  
known as **satsang**, the “company of  
good people,” believed to have beneficial spiritual effects on those who take  
part in them.
