title = "Kavya"

+++
(“related to **kavis**”) The most general  
name for courtly poetry or poetic prose,  
most often composed in the **Sanskrit**  
language. Such kavya was usually  
written and performed in a court  
setting, where innovative reworking of  
traditional forms was valued more highly  
than originality or self-revelation. The  
primary building block in such poetry

Kavya  
At an altitude of almost 12,000 feet in the Himalaya Mountains, pilgrims traveling to the  
sacred site of Kedarnath must climb a steep path and contend with unpredictable weather.  
was the two-line verse, which was a selfcontained unit with regard to meaning.  
Verses were composed in meters  
ranging from four to twenty-six syllables  
per half-line, and were ornamented  
with various **alamkaras** (“figures of  
speech”) in an effort to convey the mood  
(**rasa**) appropriate to the subject matter.  
Poetic forms range from single-verse  
epigrams, such as those of **Bhartrhari**,  
to extended epic poems (**mahakavyas**),  
most notably those of **Kalidasa**.  
Although such poetry contains frequent  
references to religious life, it was  
primarily intended for entertainment  
rather than moral encouragement, an  
emphasis which reflects the court  
atmosphere in which it was composed.  
The singular exception to this trend is  
the **Gitagovinda** of **Jayadeva**, a text  
said to have been composed at the  
**Jagannath** temple in **Puri**, which focuses on devotion to the god **Krishna** as  
lord of the universe.
