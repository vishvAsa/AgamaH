title = "Krpacharya"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Krpacharya is a  
famous archer who teaches both the  
**Pandavas** and the **Kauravas**, the two  
competing families in the epic.  
Krpacharya is a supporter of the  
Kaurava leader **Duryodhana**. During  
the year the Pandavas spend in hiding,  
he sends spies to try to find them. In the  
Mahabharata war he fights on the side  
of the Kauravas. His most important act  
is setting fire to the Pandava camp during the night attack following the  
Pandava victory. All those trying to flee  
the flames are killed. After the war he  
stays for some time at the court of  
**Yudhishthira**, the eldest Pandava brother,  
but later renounces the world to live in  
the forest.
