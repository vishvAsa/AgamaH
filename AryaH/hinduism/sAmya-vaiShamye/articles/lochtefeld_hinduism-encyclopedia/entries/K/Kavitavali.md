(“series of poems”) The final poetic  
work of the poet-saint **Tulsidas**  
(1532–1623?). In the **Kavitavali**,  
Tulsidas gives a condensed version of  
the epic **Ramayana** as well as poems  
in which he clearly speaks in his own  
voice. Evidence in the text indicates  
that it was completed after 1615. The  
poems are written in the **savaiya** and  
**kavitt** meters, which are longer, more  
complex, and less accessible than the  
meters used in most of Tulsidas’s earlier works. The *Kavitavali* is divided  
into seven sections, paralleling the  
internal structure of the *Ramayana*,  
but the bulk of the *Kavitavali*’s poems  
are in the last two sections. One of  
these is the “Lankakhand,” which  
describes the climactic battle symbolizing the struggle between good and  
evil; in this section the kavitt **meter** is  
used to render vivid battle scenes. The  
final book is the “Uttarakhand,” comprising more than half of the entire  
work. In this last section, Tulsidas has  
written some autobiographical verses  
and reiterates themes found throughout much of his work: the degeneracy  
of the present age (**Kali Yuga**), a stress  
on devotion as the only means of salvation, and the power inherent in  
God’s name, through which any  
obstacles can be overcome. Parts  
of this latter section sound pessimistic, perhaps reflecting the trials  
of advancing age, but through it all  
comes a note of hope that the author’s  
trust in God’s saving power will not  
ultimately be in vain.
