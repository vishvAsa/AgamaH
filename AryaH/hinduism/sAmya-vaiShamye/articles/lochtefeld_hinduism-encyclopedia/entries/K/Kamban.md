title = "Kamban"

+++
(9th c.) Southern Indian poet most  
noted as the author of the Tamillanguage version of the **Ramayana**, the  
earlier of the two great Hindu epics.  
Kamban’s text is known as the **Kamba**  
**Ramayana**, and remains popular in  
modern times. As with all vernacular  
translations of the *Ramayana*, Kamban  
did not simply translate **Valmiki’s**  
**Sanskrit** epic from Sanskrit to a more  
common language, but adapted and  
even added to it as he saw fit. Of particular interest is his heroic portrayal of the  
**demon**-king **Ravana**, who is the villain  
in the original story. This shift may  
reflect feelings of regional pride, since  
Kamban was a southern Indian and  
Ravana’s kingdom of **Lanka** is generally  
identified as the island of **Sri Lanka** in  
the Indian Ocean, southeast of the  
Indian mainland.
