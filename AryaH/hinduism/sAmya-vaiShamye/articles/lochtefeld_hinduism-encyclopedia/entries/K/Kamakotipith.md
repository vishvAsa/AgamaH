title = "Kamakotipith"

+++
An important center for the **Dashanami**  
sect of **Sanyasi** ascetics, located in the  
southern Indian city of **Kanchipuram**.  
According to local tradition, the  
Kamakotipith was the first and most  
important of the **maths** or monastic  
centers, established by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**, who later established  
four other centers at **Joshimath**, **Puri**,  
**Shringeri**, and **Dwaraka**. This claim to  
primacy has generated fierce controversy.  
Opponents who support one of the  
other four maths, not only deny  
Kamakotipith’s place as the first of the  
maths, but also assert that Kamakotipith  
is only a branch of the Shringeri math.  
Support for these claims can be drawn  
from the symbolism connected with the  
number four—the four cardinal directions, the four sacred texts known as  
341  
Kamakotipith  
**Vedas**, and the four organizational  
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis  
themselves. The number four symbolizes completion and totality, which  
makes a fifth sacred center problematic. Despite their possible merit,  
these contentions have not diminished  
Kamakotipith’s status. It has a long history as an **ascetic** center, and its head  
monk is routinely considered one of the  
Shankaracharyas, the most important  
modern Hindu religious leaders.  
Kamakotipith’s importance probably  
reflects the importance of Kanchipuram  
itself, which was such a significant  
sacred and political hub that any ascetic  
center located there could gain considerable authority.
