title = "Ketu"

+++
A malevolent “**planet**” in Hindu astrology  
(**jyotisha**), and was originally the body  
of a **demon**. According to the story, the  
gods and the **demons** join forces to  
churn the ocean of milk to obtain the  
nectar of immortality. The gods manage  
to trick the demons out of their share.  
While the gods drink the nectar, the  
demon **Sainhikeya** slips into their midst  
in disguise. As the demon begins to  
drink, the **sun** and **moon** alert **Vishnu**,  
who uses his discus to cut off the  
demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s two halves  
become immortal, since they have come  
into contact with the nectar. The severed  
body becomes Ketu, and the severed  
head becomes another malevolent  
planet, **Rahu**. Ketu is not regarded as a  
physical planet, but as the descending  
node of the moon, or the place where it  
intersects the ecliptic while passing  
southward. Ketu is also associated with  
comets and fiery meteors, generally  
considered signs of ill **omen**. See  
**Tortoise avatar**.
