Sacred site (**tirtha**) located in the  
extreme southeastern part of **Sri Lanka**  
that is dedicated to the god **Skanda** in  
his southern Indian manifestation as  
**Murugan**. The site is notable for being  
outside of the Indian mainland and as  
an important place of **worship** for both  
Hindus and Buddhists. According to  
357  
Kataragama  
Some pilgrims to the sacred site of Kataragama participate in extreme ascetic practices,  
such as swinging from hooks that are pierced through their backs.  
mythic tradition, the site was established when Skanda went hunting in  
the jungles of Sri Lanka, fell in love  
with a tribal woman named **Valli**, and  
vowed to remain forever in her home.  
As the son of the god **Shiva**, Skanda is a  
powerful **deity** in the Hindu pantheon.  
His relationship with Valli shows his  
accessibility and his love for his devotees (**bhakta**).  
The annual Kataragama pilgrimage  
in July–August is a theater to demonstrate these qualities: Many people  
come seeking healing from physical  
ailments or deliverance from distress,  
while others come to fulfill vows for  
benefits already received. Such vows  
often take the form of extreme selfmortification—by carrying the **kavadi**,  
a yoke held in place by hooks piercing  
the flesh; by piercing the tongue or  
cheeks with tiny arrows, one of the  
symbols of Skanda; or by hanging from  
hooks embedded in the back and  
thighs. These ardent devotees are  
reportedly rewarded for their suffering  
with a state of ecstasy in which they  
feel no pain and suffer no bleeding. In  
this state of ecstasy, the devotees are  
also believed to be mouthpieces for the  
god Skanda. Other pilgrims seek their  
advice for every conceivable kind of  
problem, under the assumption that  
Skanda will give them the most appropriate answer. For further information
