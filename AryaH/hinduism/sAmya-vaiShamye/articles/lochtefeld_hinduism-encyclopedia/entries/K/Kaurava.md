+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, the Kauravas are the  
hundred sons of King **Dhrtarashtra** and  
the epicâ€™s antagonists to the **Pandava**  
protagonists. The Kauravas receive their  
name as descendants of Kuru, an ancestor of King **Shantanu**. As in many cases  
in Hindu mythology, the Kaurava sons  
are born in an unusual manner. Their  
mother, **Gandhari**, receives a blessing  
(**ashirvad**) from the sage **Vyasa** that she  
will give **birth** to one hundred sons. Her  
**pregnancy** lasts for over two years.  
When she grows impatient and tries to  
hasten the delivery, she gives birth to a  
great lump of flesh. Vyasa advises  
Gandhari to divide the lump and place  
each piece in a pot of clarified butter  
(ghee). In due time, each of the 101  
pots break open to reveal one hundred  
handsome boys, as well as a single  
daughter, Dussala. Of these hundred  
sons, the most important are the two  
eldest, **Duryodhana** and **Duhshasana**.
