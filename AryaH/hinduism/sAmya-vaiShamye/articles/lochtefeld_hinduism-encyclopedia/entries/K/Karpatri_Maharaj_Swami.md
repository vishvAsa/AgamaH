title = "Karpatri Maharaj, Swami"

+++
A modern-day **ascetic** noted for the strictness of his ascetic practices. His name  
comes from his habit of using his hands  
354  
Karnavedha (“ear-piercing”) Samskara  
Sculptures decorate the Virupaksha Temple in Pattadakal,  
one of many historical sites in the state of Karnataka.  
(kara) as the vessel (patra) in which he  
received the food he took as alms. This is  
considered one of the strictest ascetic  
practices, since the amount of food one  
can receive in this way is fairly small. The  
lack of an **eating** vessel indicates complete  
renunciation of material **possessions**.  
Swami Karpatri was also known for his  
conservative political views. After Indian  
independence in 1947, he was one of the  
founders of the political party **Ram Rajya**  
**Parishad** (“Organization for Ram’s Reign”).  
The party’s basic assertion was that people  
had to follow the division of status and  
labor found in the traditional **caste** system  
in order to have a smoothly working society. Aside from this conservative social  
platform, the party also backed Hindu  
causes such as the demand for a total ban  
on **cow slaughter**. Despite being a **Sanyasi**  
who had renounced the world, Swami  
Karpatri still maintained some residual  
attitudes from his former life. He had been  
born a **brahmin**; even after renouncing the  
world, he would only take food from brahmin houses. Swami Karpatri exemplifies  
how many ascetics still retain connections  
with the “everyday” world—both in retaining some concern for their former status  
and in taking organized political action to  
promote causes reflecting deeply  
entrenched Hindu values.
