title = "Krishnamishra"

+++
(late 11th c.) Author of the **Sanskrit**  
drama **Prabodhachandrodaya** (“Rising  
of the **moon** of wisdom”), an allegory  
celebrating the triumph of **Vaishnava**  
piety. The play is noted for the third act,  
in which four representatives of nonVaishnava sects appear: a **materialist**; a  
Jain monk; a Buddhist monk; and a  
**Kapalika**, a member of an **ascetic**  
373  
Krishnamishra  
community who worshiped the god  
**Shiva**. The last is portrayed as depraved,  
indulging in meat, wine, and sexual  
gratification, as well as having a  
penchant for violence. Although the  
reader may safely assume that this is a  
biased perspective, it is instructive in  
the attitudes it reveals toward ascetics  
and all non-Vaishnava religious groups.
