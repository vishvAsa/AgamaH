title = "Khandoba"

+++
Regional **deity** worshiped in the central  
Indian **Deccan** region, particularly in  
the states of **Maharashtra** and  
**Karnataka**. Originally believed to be a  
local deity, Khandoba is now considered  
to be an **avatar**, or incarnation, of the  
god **Shiva**; he takes this form to destroy  
two **demons** named Mani and Malla.  
After killing the demons he is persuaded  
to reside at a temple in **Jejuri**,  
Maharashtra, from where his **worship**  
spread throughout the region.  
Khandoba is an important popular deity  
because he is believed to grant people’s  
wishes, particularly in response to vows.
