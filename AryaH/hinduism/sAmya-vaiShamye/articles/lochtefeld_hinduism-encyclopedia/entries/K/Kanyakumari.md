title = "Kanyakumari"

+++
(“virgin girl”) City and sacred site  
(**tirtha**) at the extreme southern edge of  
the state of **Tamil Nadu**, at the confluence of the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea,  
and Bay of Bengal. Kanyakumari is  
important as a bathing (**snana**) place.  
Kanyakumari is also the name of the  
site’s major **deity**, a local **goddess** who  
has been assimilated into the pantheon  
as a manifestation of the goddess  
**Parvati**. According to local tradition,  
Kanyakumari set her heart on marrying  
**Shiva**; when this was prevented she  
vowed to remain a perpetual virgin  
(kanya). Her manifestation here is clearly  
different from all the other forms of  
Parvati, who are invariably married to  
Shiva, yet Kanyakumari’s unmarried status also gives her independent power.
