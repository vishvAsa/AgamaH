title = "Karana"

+++
In Indian **philosophy**, the name for an  
instrumental cause, or the cause by  
which another thing is accomplished.  
An example often given by the **Nyaya**  
philosophical school states that when  
a potter connects two pot-halves using  
a stick, the stick is the instrumental  
cause for the creation of the pot. In  
**Sanskrit** grammar, the word karana has  
a parallel sense; it designates the word  
in a sentence that shows how the  
action is accomplished.
