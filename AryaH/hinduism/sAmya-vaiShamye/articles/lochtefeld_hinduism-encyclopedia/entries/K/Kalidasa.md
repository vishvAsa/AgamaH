title = "Kalidasa"

+++
(5th c. ?) Generally considered the greatest **Sanskrit** writer, noted both for his  
command of the language and his ability  
to evoke poetic emotion (**rasa**) in his  
listeners. There is little definite information about Kalidasa’s life; even the dates  
of his birth and death have been widely  
debated. According to legend, Kalidasa  
was an illiterate village boy. As a joke he  
was presented as a suitor for a learned  
princess who had vowed that she would  
only marry a man who could defeat her  
in a silent debate—that is, a debate  
using gestures instead of words.  
Kalidasa “defeated” the princess  
through coincidence and mutual misunderstanding and became her husband. When the princess discovered the  
depths of Kalidasa’s ignorance, she  
threw him out of the house, ordering  
him not to return until he had become  
educated. In desperation he went to a  
temple of the **goddess Kali** and was  
about to offer himself as a **human sacrifice**, when Kali appeared to him and  
gave him absolute mastery of **Sanskrit**.  
Upon his return, his wife is reported  
to have asked him, “Have you gained  
proficiency in [Sanskrit] speech?” (“Asti  
335  
Kalidasa  
kascit vagviseshatah?”). Kalidasa gave  
his answer over time, using the three  
words in his wife’s question as the first  
words of his three greatest works—  
**Kumarasambhava**, **Meghaduta**, and  
**Raghuvamsha**. He is also the author of  
the dramas **Abhijnanashakuntala**,  
**Vikramorvashiya**, and the *Malavikagnimitra*.  
These works reportedly gained him  
the patronage of king **Vikramaditya**,  
with whose court Kalidasa is  
traditionally associated.  
Legend also recounts that Kalidasa’s  
miraculous gift of learning caused his  
death. Since his wife had spurred his  
search for learning, Kalidasa thought of  
her as his **guru** or religious teacher. Out  
of respect, he refused all sexual relations  
with her. Enraged at his refusal, she  
cursed him to meet his death at the  
hands of a woman. Many years later, a  
king composed a line of verse and  
offered a large prize to the person who  
could compose the best ending.  
Kalidasa heard about this contest while  
enjoying the company of a courtesan  
and effortlessly composed the perfect  
ending. In her greed for the prize, the  
courtesan stabbed and killed Kalidasa.  
Although her crime was discovered and  
she was punished, this legend illustrates  
the Hindu belief in the unstoppable  
power of fate, particularly when driven  
by a **curse**.
