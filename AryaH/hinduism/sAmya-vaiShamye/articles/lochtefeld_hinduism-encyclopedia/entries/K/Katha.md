title = "Katha"

+++
(“conversation”) Genre of public religious address based on recitation and  
exposition of a religious text. Katha is  
most often associated with the  
**Ramcharitmanas**, a version of the  
epic **Ramayana** written by the poetsaint **Tulsidas**, but may be used to  
explain other religious texts as well.  
Kathas may be delivered in a number  
of ways: The speaker may go through  
large parts of the text, give detailed  
analysis and commentary on a very  
small portion of the text, select passages from throughout the text to  
illustrate a particular theme, or present a completely spontaneous and  
free-floating exposition. For listeners,  
attending such events is not only aesthetically satisfying but also considered to be a form of **satsang** or  
religious association. Such gatherings  
were (and are) one of the major ways  
in which illiterate people memorize  
large parts of these primary texts. For  
further information see Philip  
Lutgendorf, *The Life of a Text,* 1991.
