+++
(“releasing the skull”) Bathing (**snana**)  
tank and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
northern section of the city of **Benares**.  
According to Hindu mythology, when  
the wrathful **deity Bhairava** cuts off the  
fifth head of the god **Brahma**, insulting  
the god **Shiva**, the skull sticks to  
Bhairava’s hand as a visible sign of his  
crime. Bhairava visits all the holy places  
of the earth trying to get rid of the skull,  
but to no avail. When he arrives in  
Kapalamochana, the skull spontaneously  
drops from his hand, liberating  
him from his crime. This act indicates  
that Kapalamochana is the holiest  
place on earth.
