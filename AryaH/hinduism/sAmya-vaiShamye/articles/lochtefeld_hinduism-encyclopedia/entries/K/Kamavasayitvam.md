(“suppression of desire”) One of the  
eight superhuman powers (**siddhi**), traditionally believed to be conferred by  
high spiritual attainment. This power  
gives one the ability to control desires. It  
also means that any declaration one  
makes, such as pronouncing a blessing  
(**ashirvad**) or a **curse**, will inevitably  
come to pass. The basis for this latter  
power seems to stem from the absence  
of individual desire in such a person,  
meaning that person will never be motivated by self-interest. This power  
reflects the pan-Indian belief that by  
renouncing everything, one can eventually gain power over everything.
