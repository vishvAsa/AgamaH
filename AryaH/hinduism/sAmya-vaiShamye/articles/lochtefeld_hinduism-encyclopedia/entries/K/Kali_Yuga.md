title = "Kali Yuga"

+++
A particular age of the world in one of  
the reckonings of **cosmic time**.  
According to traditional belief, time has  
neither beginning nor end, but alternates between cycles of creation and  
activity, followed by cessation and quietude. Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32  
billion years, with the active phase  
known as the **Day of Brahma**, and the  
quiet phase as the Night of Brahma. In  
one reckoning of cosmic time, the Day  
of Brahma is divided into one thousand  
**mahayugas** (“great cosmic ages”), each  
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.  
Each mahayuga is composed of four  
yugas, the **Krta Yuga**, **Treta Yuga**,  
**Dvapara Yuga**, and Kali Yuga. Each of  
these four **yugas** is shorter than its predecessor and ushers in an era more  
degenerate and depraved. By the end of  
the Kali Yuga, things have gotten so bad  
that the only solution is the destruction  
and re-creation of the **earth**, at which  
time the next Krta era begins.  
Kali Yuga is the last of the four yugas,  
lasting for “only” 432,000 years. It is  
also considered to be the most  
degenerate yuga, symbolized by its  
identification with iron—a metal that is  
sometimes useful, sometimes harmful,  
not particularly precious, and whose  
black color is associated with **Saturn**,  
the malevolent **planet**. Kali Yuga is  
considered the time when human  
wickedness runs rampant, virtue  
virtually disappears, and the world is  
inexorably falling into ruin. Hindus  
believe that the Kali Yuga began with the  
commencement of the great war  
described in the epic **Mahabharata**,  
and not surprisingly, it is the age in  
which we now live.
