title = "Karka Sankranti"

+++
Date on the Indian **calendar** marking  
the **sun’s** transition into the zodiacal  
sign of Cancer, and thus, the beginning  
of the **dakshinayana**, the six months in  
which the sun is traveling toward the  
south. In Western astrology this happens  
during the summer solstice (around  
June 21), but in Indian reckoning it  
occurs around July 14. The discrepancy  
arises due to the different ways in which  
the two systems mark the beginning of  
the astrological **year**. In Western astrology  
the beginning of the year is based on the  
sun’s position in relation to the **earth**  
and occurs during the vernal equinox  
(around March 21). In Indian reckoning  
the starting point of the **zodiac** comes  
when the sun intersects the midpoint of  
a group of stars named Ashvini, and is  
based on the position of the sun with  
regard to fixed stars. Karka Sankranti is  
not marked by significant observances,  
unlike **Makara Sankranti**, which occurs  
six months earlier, marking the  
beginning of the sun’s northward  
journey (**uttarayana**). The southern  
direction is associated with the god  
**Yama**, who is death personified. Thus,  
this southward movement is considered  
less **auspicious** than its northward  
counterpart.
