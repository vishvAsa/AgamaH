(“spiral”) Kundalini, the latent spiritual  
power that exists in every person, is one  
of the most fundamental concepts in  
**tantra**. It is the most vital element in the  
**subtle body**, an alternate physiological  
system believed to occupy a different  
plane of existence than gross matter, but  
which has certain correspondences to  
the material body. The subtle body is a  
set of six psychic centers (**chakras**),  
visualized as multi-petaled lotus flowers  
running along the spine and connected  
by three vertical channels. Each of the  
chakras symbolize human capacities,  
subtle elements (**tanmatras**), and  
sacred sounds. Above and below the  
chakras are the bodily abodes of the  
god **Shiva** (awareness) and the  
**goddess Shakti** (power), the two divine  
principles through which the entire  
universe has come into being. The  
underlying assumption behind this  
concept is the homology (or the  
similarity based on the common origin)  
of macrocosm and microcosm, an  
essential Hindu belief documented  
in the texts of the **Upanishads**.  
The kundalini is an aspect of the universal Shakti present in all human  
beings; it is visualized as a snake coiled  
three times around the **muladhara**  
**chakra**, the lowest of the psychic centers. Although kundalini can be found in  
all people, it is usually dormant, symbolized by its coiled state. The object of  
the religious disciplines (**yogas**) involving the subtle body is to awaken and  
uncoil the kundalini, drawing it up  
through the subtle body’s central channel (**sushumna**), piercing through the  
chakras on its way. Kundalini’s ascent  
represents the awakening of spiritual  
energy. This awakening must be carried  
out under a **guru**’s supervision to prevent the aspirant from unknowingly  
arousing uncontrollable forces. As each  
chakra is pierced, it is believed to bring  
either the destruction of obstructions or  
the awakening of new capacities. When  
fully extended, the kundalini rises to the  
microcosmic realm of Shiva, the **sahasradalapadma** at the crown of the head,  
to unite with Shiva in perpetual bliss.
