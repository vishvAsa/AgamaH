title = "Kalimath"

+++
(“**Kali’s** Dwelling”) Village and sacred  
site (**tirtha**) in the **Himalaya** mountains  
of **Uttar Pradesh** state. Kalimath is  
located on a small tributary of the  
336  
Kalighat  
**Mandakini** River about ten miles from  
the village of **Guptakashi**; the  
Mandakini is one of the Himalayan tributaries that combine to create the  
**Ganges**. According to local tradition,  
Kalimath is one of the **Shakti Pithas**, a  
network of sites sacred to the **Goddess**.  
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a  
body part of the dismembered goddess  
**Sati** fell to **earth**, taking form there as a  
different goddess. Local sources claim  
that Kalimath is the place where Sati’s  
vulva fell to earth. It took form there as  
the goddess Kali, thus associating a  
highly charged female body part with a  
powerful and often dangerous form of  
the Goddess. The temple’s image of the  
Goddess is extremely unusual—a brass  
plate a little more than a foot square,  
whose center is cut out in a small triangle, an aniconic symbol of the Goddess.  
This plate supposedly covers a pit—  
a clear symbol of the part of Sati’s body  
which is supposed to have fallen  
there—but the area under the plate  
is deemed so sacred that looking under  
it is forbidden.  
The claim that Kalimath is the place  
where Sati’s vulva fell to earth illustrates  
the fluidity of the Indian sacred landscape. There is a much more widely  
accepted tradition associating this specific body part with the temple of  
**Kamakhya** in **Assam**. Such competing  
claims are not uncommon in the Indian  
sacred landscape, since people often  
make these claims to enhance their particular site’s sanctity and prestige. It is  
notable that many Hindus seem little  
concerned with such apparent inconsistencies, perhaps stemming from the  
conviction that a single Goddess lies  
behind all her individual manifestations. See also **pitha**.
