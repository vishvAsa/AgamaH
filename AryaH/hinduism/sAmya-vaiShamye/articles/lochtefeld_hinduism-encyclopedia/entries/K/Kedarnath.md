title = "Kedarnath"

+++
Village and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Himalayas** at the headwaters of the  
**Mandakini River**, one of the tributaries  
of the **Ganges**. The village is named for  
its presiding **deity**, who is the god **Shiva**  
in his manifestation as the “Lord of  
Kedar.” Shiva is present at Kedarnath in  
the form of a **linga**, a pillar-shaped  
image. The Kedarnath linga is deemed  
one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network  
of sites deemed especially sacred to  
Shiva. Kedarnath’s sanctity is only  
matched by the difficulty in getting to it.  
Its high altitude—close to 12,000 feet—  
means that it is only accessible between  
late April and October, a characteristic  
also of **Yamunotri**, **Gangotri**, and  
**Badrinath**, the three other major  
Himalayan pilgrim sites. A trip to  
Kedarnath preserves some of the difficulty formerly associated with  
Himalayan pilgrimage. Pilgrims travel  
the last ten miles on foot or horseback,  
during which the path climbs five thousand feet. Those braving the trek must  
contend with the unpredictable mountain weather, but may also be rewarded  
with spectacular vistas. The temple of  
Kedarnath is surrounded by mountain  
meadows and shaded by mountains  
capped with snow year-round.  
The Kedarnath linga is a natural  
ridge of stone considered to be a selfmanifestation (**svayambhu**) of Shiva,  
and is considered to be unusually powerful. The particular shape of this linga is  
tied to Kedarnath’s charter myth. One  
version of this story is connected to the  
five **Pandava** brothers, who are the protagonists in the **Mahabharata**, the later  
of the two great Hindu epics. The  
Pandavas make their final journey into  
the Himalayas, searching for a vision of  
Shiva. They finally see him at a distance,  
but when they try to get closer, Shiva  
takes the form of a **bull** and begins running through the snow. The bull burrows  
into a snow bank. When the Pandavas  
follow, they find the body of the bull in  
the snow. The ridge of rock that forms  
the Kedarnath linga is considered to be  
the hump of this bull. The bull’s head  
continues traveling over the hills, eventually stopping in **Nepal**, where it takes  
form as **Pashupatinath**.  
A completely different charter myth  
draws on the traditional belief that Shiva  
makes his home high in the mountains.  
This myth identifies the **Panchkedar** (a  
network of five Shiva shrines in the  
**Garhwal** region) with five parts of  
Shiva’s body, thus connecting the deity  
with the land itself and making the land  
363  
Kedarnath  
holy. Of these five, Kedarnath is identified as Shiva’s back, **Madmaheshvar**  
his navel, **Tungnath** his arm, **Rudranath**  
his face, and **Kalpeshvar** his matted  
locks (**jata**).
