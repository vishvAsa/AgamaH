Traditional Indian society was as a collection of **endogamous** subgroups (in  
which marriage is decreed by law to  
occur only between members of the  
same group) known as **jatis** (“birth”).  
Jatis were organized (and their social  
status determined) by the group’s hereditary occupation, over which each group  
held a monopoly. The Kumhars’ hereditary occupation was making pottery.
