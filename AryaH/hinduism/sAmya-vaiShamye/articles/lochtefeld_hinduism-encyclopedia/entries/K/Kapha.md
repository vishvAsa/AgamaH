title = "Kapha"

(“phlegm”) Along with **vata** (“air”) and  
**pitta** (“bile”), one of the three bodily  
humours (**tridosha**) in **ayurveda**, the  
traditional system of Indian medicine.  
Every person has all three of these  
humours, but usually one is dominant;  
this marks a person in certain ways, particularly with regard to health, digestion,  
and metabolism. Kapha is associated  
with the **elements** of **earth** and **water**,  
since phlegm has both liquid and solid  
characteristics. It provides solidity and  
fluidity. Those who exhibit this humor  
are said to be strong, healthy, and have  
great stamina. At the same time, this  
solidity can take the form of inertia and  
fatigue; “phlegmatic” people must do  
their best avoid these tendencies.
