title = "Kashi"

+++
(“shining”) One of the traditional names  
for the city of **Benares**. Benares is mentioned in the list of the **Seven Sacred**  
**Cities**, where death brings final liberation  
of the soul. In a more strict local sense, the  
name *Kashi* designates the largest of the  
three traditional sacred zones in Benares.  
It includes everything within the  
**Panchakroshi Yatra** road, a circuit  
around the city that marks the outer limit  
of the region. The name Kashi refers to the  
mythic story of the **jyotirlinga**, the “pillar  
of light” in which the god **Shiva** is said to  
have first appeared. According to tradition, the pillar of light did not just land in  
Kashi but was itself a form of Kashi, thus  
indicating the city’s sanctity over all other  
places on **earth**.
