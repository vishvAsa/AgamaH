title = "Kishkindha"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, Kishkindha is a  
forest-kingdom ruled by monkeys. The  
monkey-king, **Bali**, rules when **Rama**  
(the epic’s protagonist) first comes to  
Kishkindha with his brother, **Lakshmana**,  
searching for Rama’s kidnapped wife  
**Sita**. Bali is killed by Rama, and is succeeded by his brother **Sugriva**, Rama’s  
ally. Sugriva sends his subjects on a  
wide-ranging search for Sita. One of  
them, **Hanuman**, eventually discovers  
her being held prisoner on **Lanka**.
