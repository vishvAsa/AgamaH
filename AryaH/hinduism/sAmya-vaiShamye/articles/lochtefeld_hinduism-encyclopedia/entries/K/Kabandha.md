title = "Kabandha"

+++
(“headless trunk”) A **demon** in the  
**Ramayana** (the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics) who attacks the god-king  
**Rama**, the epic’s protagonist, and  
Rama’s brother **Lakshmana**. In a previous life Kabandha has been a king of the  
**gandharvas**, or celestial musicians; but  
in a battle with the god **Indra**,  
Kabandha’s head is pushed down into  
his body. When Kabandha requests  
some means by which he can eat, Indra  
places a mouth in Kabandha’s belly.  
Indra tells him that the **curse** will be  
broken when Rama and Lakshmana cut  
off his arms.  
As Rama and Lakshmana travel  
through a forest, searching for Rama’s  
kidnapped wife **Sita**, they are set upon  
by Kabandha, who grabs each of them in  
one of his long arms. Finding they could  
not escape, Rama and Lakshmana each  
slash off one of his arms, and with his  
dying breaths Kabandha asks the brothers to burn his body. As the body is  
burning, the gandharva king arises from  
the fire in his previous form and advises  
the brothers to seek help from the monkey-king **Sugriva**.
