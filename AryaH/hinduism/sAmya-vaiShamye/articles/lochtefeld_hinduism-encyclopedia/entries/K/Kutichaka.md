title = "Kutichaka"

+++
(“delighting in staying in the house”)  
One the of four types of Hindu ascetics.  
The basis for these four types was their  
livelihood, which in practice has been  
much less important for **ascetic** identity  
than sectarian or organizational affiliation. The Kutichaka is the least prestigious of the four, with the others  
being (in order of increasing status)  
**Bahudaka**, **Hamsa**, and **Paramahamsa**.  
The Kutichaka is described as an ascetic  
who resides in a house (kuti) erected by  
himself or his sons and begs for food  
from his sons and relatives.
