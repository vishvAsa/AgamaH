title = "Kubera"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a minor **deity** who  
is one of the eight **Guardians of the**  
**Directions**, serving as guardian over the  
northern quarter. Kubera is said to live  
in the Himalaya mountains, where he is  
served by mythical creatures such as  
**yakshas**, **nagas**, and **kinnaras**. He is  
enormously fat, and because of all the  
mineral wealth contained in the mountains, he is enormously wealthy. Kubera  
is the half-brother of the **demon**-king of  
**Lanka**, **Ravana**, and **Kumbhakarna** and  
**Vibhishana**. All four are sons of the  
demigod Vishravas, but Kubera has a  
different mother. Despite their relationship, Ravana steals Kubera’s aerial chariot,  
the **Pushpak Viman**. Because of  
Ravana’s notorious misdeeds, Kubera  
supports the god-king **Rama’s** efforts to  
conquer Ravana.
