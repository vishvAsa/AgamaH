title = "Krishnamurti, Jiddu"

+++
(1895â€“1986) Modern Indian thinker  
whose teachings centered on the necessity for personal realization through  
critical self-awareness. His teaching had  
strong roots in his own life experience.  
When he was fourteen years old, one of  
the leaders of the Theosophical Society,  
Annie Besant, proclaimed him to be an  
incarnation of the future Buddha  
Maitreya. He later repudiated these  
claims, and for the rest of his life  
stressed the need to examine and  
question all authority, including  
himself. Much of his life was spent in  
Europe and the United States, where his  
books and lectures found their primary  
audience. For further information see
