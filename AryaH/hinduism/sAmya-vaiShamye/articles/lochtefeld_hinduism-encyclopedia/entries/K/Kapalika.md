title = "Kapalika"

+++
Extinct monastic sect of Shaivite  
ascetics, or devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**. Although none of the Kapalikas’  
own written records have survived,  
there are numerous descriptions of  
them by other **ascetic** groups and by  
dramatists of their time such as **Bana**  
(7th c.) and **Bhavabhuti** (8th c.). The  
sources describe the Kapalikas as worshiping the god Shiva in his wrathful  
form as **Bhairava** and as emulating  
Bhairava’s characteristics: wearing their  
hair long and matted, smearing their  
bodies with ash (preferably from the  
**cremation ground**), and carrying a club  
and a skull-bowl (**kapala**). The Kapalikas  
are cited as indulging in forbidden  
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,  
using cannabis and other **drugs**,  
performing **human sacrifice**, and  
enjoying orgiastic sexuality. Needless to  
say, most of the available sources do not  
approve of them.  
David Lorenzen argues that despite  
the disapproval of their contemporaries,  
all the Kapalika practices must be seen  
in the context of **tantra**. Tantra is a  
secret, ritually-based religious practice  
that its initiates believe is far more powerful and effective than ordinary religious **worship**. One of its most essential  
themes is the ultimate unity of everything that exists. From a tantric perspective, to affirm that the entire universe is  
one principle—often, conceived as the  
activity of a particular **deity**—means  
that the adept must reject all concepts  
based on dualistic thinking. One way to  
do this is to partake of the “Five  
Forbidden Things” (**panchamakara**),  
consciously breaking societal norms  
forbidding illicit sexuality and  
consumption of **intoxicants** and nonvegetarian food. This is always done  
within a carefully defined ritual setting,  
in a conscious effort to sacralize what is  
normally forbidden.  
Seen in this context, the Kapalikas’  
behavior is shocking but becomes more  
understandable. Lorenzen also speculates that in performing such behaviors  
(which may have only taken place during religious ceremonies), the Kapalikas  
were identifying themselves with their  
chosen deity, Bhairava. In the Hindu  
pantheon Bhairava is known for his  
uncontrolled excesses, particularly for  
cutting off one of the heads of the god  
**Brahma**, for which he has to perform  
severe penances (**prayashchitta**). In this  
understanding, the Kapalikas’ practices  
are not motivated by hedonistic selfgratification but by the desire to imitate  
their chosen deity. The only developed  
source on the Kapalikas is David  
Lorenzen, *The Kapalikas and the*  
*Kalamukhas*, 1972.
