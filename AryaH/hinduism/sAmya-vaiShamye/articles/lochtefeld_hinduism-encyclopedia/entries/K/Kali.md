(“black”) Incomprehensibly fierce and  
powerful divine form of the Mother  
**Goddess**. Kali is the awful, uncontrolled power of the divine in its most  
terrifying aspects. She is consistently  
associated with images of **blood**, death,  
and destruction; her dwelling place is  
the **cremation ground**. Her iconography portrays her as clothed with severed heads and limbs, and her form is  
lean, gaunt, and haggard, with lolling  
tongue and lips smeared with blood.  
Paradoxically, millions of Kali’s devotees  
(**bhakta**) refer to her as “mother.”  
Kali’s roots are uncertain, but she is  
generally assumed to be an autochthonous (“of the land”) **deity**. Her dark  
color—associated with low social status, her preference for dwelling in  
inaccessible places, and her **worship**  
by Indian aboriginal tribes and people  
at the margins of society, all seem to  
point to origins as a local goddess, perhaps of tribal people. Some early  
**Sanskrit** dramas, such as the poet  
**Bhavabhuti’s Malatimadhava**, mention fierce goddesses who received  
**offerings** of blood from their devotees.  
This same motif was a central element  
in the stories about the **Thugs** in the  
nineteenth century.  
One of Kali’s earliest descriptions  
comes in the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest  
known source for the notion that God is  
feminine. One of the *Devimahatmya*’s  
episodes describes the birth of Kali (in  
her form as **Mahakali**) as the anger of  
the Goddess incarnate. In the story, Kali  
first destroys the **demon** armies by stuffing them into her mouth and eating  
them whole, symbolizing her all-consuming power to destroy. Her other feat  
in this text is the destruction of  
**Raktabija**, a demon who receives the  
boon that any drop of his blood that falls  
to the earth will instantly turn into a  
clone of him—a boon that renders him  
practically unconquerable. Kali defeats  
him by drinking his blood as it is shed  
until it is completely gone. Both of these  
episodes reinforce her image as a terrifying and powerful goddess, her destructive capacity, and her associations with  
substances and practices normally  
considered to be defiling. As Kinsley  
notes, Kali can also be seen as a symbolic statement that human life is  
uncertain and that tragedy and misfortune can occur without warning, despite  
the best-laid plans.  
Worship of Kali has followed two  
paths, one in agreement with these horrific images and one in contradiction to  
them. On one hand, Kali has been an  
important deity for practitioners of the  
secret, ritually-based religious practice  
known as **tantra**. The tantras describe  
reality as resulting from the interaction  
between polar opposites, symbolized in  
the deities of **Shiva** (consciousness) and  
**Shakti** (“power”). Shiva provides the  
ordering principle and is the Ultimate  
Reality, but Shakti provides the energy  
and dynamism that actually makes  
things happen. Consequently, goddesses  
take on an important role in tantric  
practice. Among these goddesses Kali  
stands preeminent, perhaps because  
she is the most radical articulation of  
feminine power and can thus be seen as  
bringing the greatest power to bear on

Kali  
Image of the goddess Kali. Her fierce power is represented by the symbols of death and destruction  
that surround her: skulls, fire, her blood-smeared tongue, and severed heads and limbs.  
behalf of her devotees. Her power over  
all things and Shiva’s helplessness without this power is symbolized by the  
images of Kali standing over the prostrate Shiva, clearly in a dominant position. In this tradition, the tantric expert  
is seen as a heroic figure who gains  
power from the goddess.  
The tantras also stress the reconciliation of opposites as a way to destroy all  
conceptual dualism and affirm the ultimate unity of the entire universe. To  
carry this out, tantric rituals may  
include practices involving substances  
normally forbidden, such as the socalled **Panchamakara**, or “Five  
Forbidden Things,” as a way to affirm  
the provisional nature of all judgments  
of **purity** and impurity (**ashaucha**).  
Again, Kali is the quintessential tantric  
deity, since her iconography and  
mythology involve things normally considered impure: drinking blood and  
receiving **animal sacrifices**, living in the  
cremation ground, and clothing herself  
with severed limbs.  
The other dominant image for the  
worship of Kali is as a mother. This  
image is preeminent in the Bengal  
region, and has become widely established there during the past few hundred years. This image of Kali is rooted  
in Indian images of motherhood, which  
are greatly idealized in terms of a mother’s devotion to her children. The central  
belief is that if a devotee approaches Kali  
as a submissive child, ready to take  
whatever blows she gives, she will ultimately turn her awesome forces toward  
protecting her devotee. Kali’s most  
famous devotees are the nineteenthcentury Bengali figures **Ramprasad** and  
**Ramakrishna**; the former is famous for  
a poem in which he states that there are  
bad children but never a bad mother.  
Religious adepts such as Ramprasad  
and Ramakrishna have been able to  
maintain this tension between Kali’s  
horrific persona and her image as a  
mother, but in popular devotion this  
tension has been largely lost. Modern  
images of Kali tend to sweeten or ignore  
her horrific aspects, often portraying her  
as young, beautiful, and almost benevolent. For more information on Kali, see
