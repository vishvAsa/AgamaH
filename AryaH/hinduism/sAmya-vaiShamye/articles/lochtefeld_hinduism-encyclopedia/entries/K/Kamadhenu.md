title = "Kamadhenu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a **goddess** in the  
form of a **cow** (dhenu) who has the  
power to grant all one’s wishes (**kama**).  
The Kamadhenu is considered the  
mother of all cattle. She is associated  
with giving gifts of food, and thus is an  
extension of the gifts of food given by all  
cows. In Hindu mythology, Kamadhenu  
is the property of the sage **Jamadagni**.  
Her theft by a local king prompts Jamadagni’s son, **Parashuram avatar**, to circle  
the earth twenty-one times, in an attempt  
to wipe out the **kshatriya** (kingly) class.
