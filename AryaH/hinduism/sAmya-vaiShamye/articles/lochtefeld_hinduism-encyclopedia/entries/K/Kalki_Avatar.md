The tenth **avatar** or incarnation of the  
god **Vishnu**, and the only one of these  
incarnations who has not yet appeared.  
In traditional art, Kalki is portrayed as  
riding a white horse and brandishing a  
sword. It is believed that he will come at  
a time when the state of the world has  
completely degenerated. His arrival will  
signal its imminent destruction; his purpose will be to purify the world by  
destroying the wicked.
