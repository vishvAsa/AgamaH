title = "Kaitabha"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of two **demons**  
who attempt to kill the god **Brahma** (the  
other is **Madhu**). The story is recounted  
in several mythic sources, with some  
important differences among them. All  
versions agree that Madhu and Kaitabha  
are born from the god **Vishnu’s** earwax  
during the period of cosmic dissolution  
(**pralaya**). As the creation of the world  
begins, a lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s  
navel. It opens to reveal the creator-god,  
Brahma, who is immediately attacked  
by Madhu and Kaitabha. In all versions  
of the myth, Brahma appeals for help.  
Vishnu tricks the demons (who are  
strong but not too bright) and slays  
them. The difference comes in the **deity**  
to whom Brahma appeals for help. The  
story first appears in the mythology of  
Vishnu; here Brahma invokes that deity.  
Yet this same story also appears in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest mythic  
source for the cult of the Mother  
**Goddess** as the supreme divine power.  
In this version, Brahma’s hymn of praise  
is to the Goddess, who in her form as  
**Yoganidra** (“sleep of **yoga**”) has lulled  
Vishnu into a cosmic stupor, rendering  
him unable to come to Brahma’s aid.  
Pleased by Brahma’s praise, the Goddess  
withdraws her influence over Vishnu; he  
awakens and slays the demons.
