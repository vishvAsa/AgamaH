title = "Kalasha"

+++
(“pitcher”) In the **Nagara** style of temple  
**architecture** predominantly found in  
northern India, the kalasha is an inverted  
vase-shaped piece that crowns the temple towers (**shikharas**). In many cases,  
kalashas were made of gold to provide a  
decorative contrast above the stone. The  
kalasha on the highest tower typically  
has a banner fluttering from it. The

Kajari Teej  
architectural symbolism in Hindu  
temples corresponds to the structure  
of human body, so the kalashas stand  
for the crown of the head, the highest  
and purest part of the body. They are  
also a symbol of the highest human  
religious potential.
