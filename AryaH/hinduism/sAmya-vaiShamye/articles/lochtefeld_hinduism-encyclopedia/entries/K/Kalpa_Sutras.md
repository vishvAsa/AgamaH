title = "Kalpa Sutras"

+++
(“aphorisms on sacred law”) An important class of **smrti** or “remembered [literature].” The Kalpa Sutras were first  
composed around the sixth century  
B.C.E. The sutras were collected to provide a unified religious and legal worldview. According to the general scholarly  
consensus, the theory used to associate  
these sutras imposed an appearance of  
conceptual order on what was more  
likely an organic development of Hindu  
religious law. The Kalpa Sutras are all  
attributed to famous sages. In theory  
each Kalpa **Sutra** contains three separate parts: prescriptions for Vedic rituals  
(**Shrauta Sutras**), prescriptions for  
domestic rites (**Grhya Sutras**), and prescriptions for appropriate human  
behavior (**Dharma Sutras**). The real picture is far more complex since only three  
sutras contain all three parts and are  
attributed to a single author. The three  
surviving Kalpa Sutras are attributed to  
the sages **Apastamba**, **Baudhayana**, and  
**Hiranyakeshin** and are all associated  
with the same school, the **Black Yajur**  
**Veda**. There are many other collections  
that have one or another of these parts,  
but not all three. Each of the Kalpa  
Sutras is also theoretically connected  
with one of the four **Vedas**, the earliest  
Hindu religious texts. However, it is likely  
that this claim was made to give authority to the collection.
