The most important city in the Kulu  
Valley in the state of **Himachal Pradesh**.  
The city of Kulu is famous for its  
**Dussehra** festival. Dussehra celebrates  
the victory of the god **Rama** over the  
**demon**-king **Ravana**; it is a celebration  
of the victory of good over evil. Kulu’s  
festival centers around the figure of  
Rama from the Raghunathji temple in  
the nearby village of Dhalpur. When  
Rama is brought to the festival site in his  
temple car, he is celebrated by hundreds  
of **deities** who have come from temples  
up and down the Kulu Valley, as well as  
the people who have gathered to see the  
deities and the spectacle of their procession. The deities’ actions are carefully  
choreographed according to well-established rituals.
