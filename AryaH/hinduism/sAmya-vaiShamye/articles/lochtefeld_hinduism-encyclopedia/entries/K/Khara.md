title = "Khara"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Khara is one of the  
brothers of the demon-king **Ravana**.  
With his brother **Dushana**, Khara tries to  
avenge the honor of their sister  
**Shurpanakha**, whose ears and nose  
have been cut off by **Ramaâ€™s** brother  
**Lakshmana**. In a fierce battle, Rama  
destroys the demon army, killing Khara  
and Dushana. Seeing the failure of her  
two brothers, Shurpanakha goes to their  
brother Ravana to demand vengeance.  
Ravana realizes he cannot kill Rama in  
battle, but resolves to avenge his sister  
by kidnapping **Sita**, an action which drives the plot for the latter part of the epic.
