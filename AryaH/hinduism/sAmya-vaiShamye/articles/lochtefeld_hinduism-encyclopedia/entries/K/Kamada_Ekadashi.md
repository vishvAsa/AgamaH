title = "Kamada Ekadashi"

+++
**Ekadashi**, or eleventh-day, festival of  
the bright, waxing half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Chaitra** (March–April). Most  
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed  
rites usually involving fasting (**upavasa**)  
and **worship**, and often promise-specific  
benefits for faithful performance. As  
promised by its name (“wish-granting”),  
faithfully observing this festival will  
fulfill one’s desire (**kama**), whatever it  
may be.
