title = "Kena (“By Whom?”) Upanishad"

+++
One of the shorter of the early speculative texts known as the **Upanishads**,  
whose name comes from the first word  
of the text itself. The Kena Upanishad is  
unusual in that the first two sections are  
written in verse, and the third and fourth  
in prose. This change gives the text a  
somewhat disjointed feel, despite its  
brevity, and raises the possibility that it  
is a compilation of two earlier texts. As  
with many of the later upanishads, the  
Kena Upanishad propounds that the  
ultimate source of all reality is ascribed  
to a single power that can only be discovered through a flash of mystic  
insight. The verse sections describe this  
power: “It is conceived of by one who  
does not conceive of it, it is not conceived by one who conceives, it is not  
known by those who think they know it,  
it is known by those who think they do  
not know it” (verse 2.3). The prose sections are very different, narrating an  
encounter between a mysterious being  
(**Brahman** personified) and several of  
the primary gods in the earlier Vedic literature—**Indra**, **Agni**, and **Vayu**. Despite  
all their efforts, the gods are unable to  
exercise their respective powers of  
storm, fire, and wind, showing that their  
divine power is not independently  
theirs, but is derived from Brahman.
