title = "Karnataka"

+++
One of the four southern Indian states,  
whose inhabitants speak a **Dravidian** language, in this case **Kannada**. Karnataka is  
one of the “linguistic” states formed after  
India’s independence in 1947, intended to  
unite people with a common language and  
culture under one state government. The  
state was largely formed from the former  
kingdom of Mysore. In medieval times,  
Karnataka was the seat of important  
Hindu kingdoms, particularly the **Hoysala**  
and **Vijayanagar** dynasties; these dynasties built cities at **Belur**, **Halebid**, and  
**Hampi**, which are now important archeological sites. Karnataka is also the home of  
the **Lingayats**, devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**,  
whose missionary work eventually  
squeezed out the thriving Jain community.

Jain monuments, such as the massive  
statue at Shravanabelgola, still stand.  
Karnataka also contains important Hindu  
holy places, such as **Shrirangapatnam** and  
**Shringeri math**. Even though much of the  
state’s economy is still highly agricultural,  
Karnataka’s capital, Bangalore, is a worldwide center for computer software development. For general information about
