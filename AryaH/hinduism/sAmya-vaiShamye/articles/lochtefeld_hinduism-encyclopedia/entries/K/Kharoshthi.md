title = "Kharoshthi"

+++
(“ass-lip”) Name for one of the ancient  
scripts used in the **inscriptions** of the  
emperor **Ashoka** (r. 269–232 B.C.E.), the  
greatest figure in the **Maurya dynasty**.  
Ashoka’s empire encompassed all of the  
subcontinent (except the deepest parts  
of southern India) and parts of modern  
Afghanistan. Ashoka’s **Rock Edicts** and  
**Pillar Edicts** are the earliest significant  
Indian written documents, giving  
invaluable information about contemporary social, political, and religious life.  
The Kharoshthi script was used exclusively in the northwestern part of  
Ashoka’s empire and was clearly derived  
from the Aramaic alphabet used in  
Achaeminid Persia. Although the script  
was modified to adapt it to the sounds of  
Indian languages, it clearly shows  
Persian cultural influence. It was far less  
pervasive than **Brahmi** script and had  
virtually disappeared from India by the  
early centuries of the common era.
