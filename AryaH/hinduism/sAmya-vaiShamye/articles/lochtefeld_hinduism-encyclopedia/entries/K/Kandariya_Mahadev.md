title = "Kandariya Mahadev"

+++
The largest of the temples at **Khajuraho**  
in the state of **Madhya Pradesh**. It is  
dedicated to the god **Shiva** in his manifestation as “**Skanda**’s Lord”; Skanda is  
another **deity** who is considered to be  
Shiva’s son, and the general of Shiva’s  
army. The Kandariya Mahadev temple  
was built by the kings of the **Chandella**  
**dynasty** between 1025 and 1050. It was  
constructed at the end of the wave of creativity that produced all of the Khajuraho  
temples. It is the best-developed example  
of the Khajuraho branch of the **Nagara**  
architectural style, in which all of the  
temple’s smaller towers lead to and culminate in one central tower directly  
over the sanctuary. Like most of the  
temples at Khajuraho, the Kandariya  
Mahadev temple is covered with **erotic**  
**sculpture**—perhaps as a symbol for  
union with the divine, perhaps as a religious affirmation of every aspect of  
human existence.
