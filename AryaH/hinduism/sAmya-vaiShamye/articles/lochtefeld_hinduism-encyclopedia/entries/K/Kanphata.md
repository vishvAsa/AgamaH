(“split ear”) Colloquial name for the  
**Nathpanthi** sect of **ascetics**, who are  
followers of the sage **Gorakhnath**.  
This particular name stems from the  
Nathpanthi’s most characteristic  
feature: When a Nathpanthi ascetic  
is ready for final **initiation**, the cartilage  
in his ears is slit with a razor to insert  
the large earrings by which members  
of this group are easily identified.  
See **Nathpanthi**.
