title = "Kapila"

+++
(2) Philosopher cited as the traditional  
founder of the **Samkhya** philosophical  
school, one of the **six schools** of Hindu  
**philosophy**. Little is known about him;  
much of what is known has a legendary  
tone that makes its value as historical  
data questionable. Kapila may have  
lived in the seventh century B.C.E. If  
this is true, Kapila would have lived  
about a thousand years earlier than  
**Ishvarakrishna**. The latter is the first  
Samkhya figure from whom we have a  
well-attested text, the *Samkhyakarikas*,  
which is the foundational text for  
the school.
