(“[city of ] humpbacked maidens”)  
Ancient name for the site now known as  
**Kanauj**, which was the capital for several  
northern Indian dynasties in the latter  
half of the first millennium. The name  
*Kanyakubja* comes from a tale about a  
king who has a hundred daughters. One  
day the daughters’ games disturb the  
meditation of a local sage who is filled  
with desire for them. The king worries  
about angering the sage and promises  
him one of his daughters in marriage.  
Ninety-nine of his daughters flatly  
refuse to marry the sage because of his  
advanced age and gruff demeanor, but  
the youngest agrees to do so in obedience to her father. The sage accepts the  
youngest daughter and curses the others  
to become humpbacked so they will  
never be able to marry.
