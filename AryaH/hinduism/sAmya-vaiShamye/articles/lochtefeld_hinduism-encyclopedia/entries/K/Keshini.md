title = "Keshini"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of  
King **Sagar**. Through a sage’s boon,  
Keshini and her co-wife **Sumati** are  
given a choice in the number of children  
they will bear—one will bear a single son  
through whom the lineage will continue,  
whereas the other will bear sixty thousand **sons** who will die before they  
have any offspring. Keshini chooses the  
former, and through her son  
**Asamanjasa** the line of King Sagar is  
preserved. Her descendants are particularly important, since her great-greatgrandson is the sage **Bhagirath**, who  
succeeds in bringing the river **Ganges**  
from **heaven** to **earth**.
