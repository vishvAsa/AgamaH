title = "Kerala"

+++
One of the four southern Indian states,  
whose inhabitants speak a **Dravidian**  
language, in this case Malayalam. Kerala  
occupies the narrow strip of land  
between the Western Ghats and the  
Arabian sea, in the region formerly  
known as the **Malabar** coast. Kerala is  
one of the “linguistic” states formed  
after Indian independence in 1947, to  
unite people with a common language  
and culture under one state government. It was created from the  
Malayalam-speaking regions of the former Madras state, plus the princely  
states of Travancore and Cochin. Kerala  
has always been important as a trading  
center. The desire for its spices and sandalwood have brought merchants from  
the Middle East for thousands of years.  
In modern times it has had India’s first  
elected communist government, and is  
the only Indian state to have 100 percent  
adult literacy. Kerala’s most famous  
sacred site is the temple of **Aiyappa** at  
**Shabari Malai**. By custom the annual  
pilgrimage to the site is restricted to  
men as well as women past childbearing age. For general information
