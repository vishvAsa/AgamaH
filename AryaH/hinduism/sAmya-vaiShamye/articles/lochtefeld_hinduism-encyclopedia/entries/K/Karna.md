title = "Karna"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Karna is the eldest of  
the **Pandava** brothers, although he is  
not aware of his true identity until a few  
days before his death. He is born when  
his mother, **Kunti**, in a moment of  
youthful impulsiveness, looks upon the  
**sun** while reciting a **mantra**, giving her  
the power to have a son by any of the  
gods. She is immediately visited by a  
shining figure, who leaves her with an  
equally shining son. Distraught and desperate at the birth of this child, which as  
an unmarried woman she feels she cannot keep, she puts him in a box and  
abandons him in the **Ganges**.  
The child is adopted by the charioteer, **Adhiratha**, who raises Karna as his  
own son. Karna later comes to the court  
of King **Dhrtarashtra**, where he  
becomes friends with the king’s son,  
352  
Karmamarga  
The Himalayan town of Karnaprayag.  
**Duryodhana**, the epic’s antagonist. While  
at court, Karna begins a lifelong conflict  
with **Arjuna**, one of the five Pandava  
brothers. Arjuna’s comments about  
Karna’s unknown parentage are meant to  
deny Karna the recognition he deserves  
as Arjuna’s equal. As do all the princes,  
Karna studies with **Drona**, the archery  
master. When Drona refuses to teach  
Karna the secret of the **Brahma** weapon  
Karna wants to use to kill Arjuna, Karna  
goes to the sage **Parashuram avatar** for  
this instruction. He presents himself as a  
**brahmin**, since Parashuram hates the  
**kshatriya** (ruling) class and refuses to  
accept any of them as students.  
Parashuram teaches Karna all that he  
wants to know. During this period, however, Karna receives two **curses** that ultimately determine his fate. Karna kills a  
brahmin’s **cow**, so the brahmin curses him  
to have his chariot wheel stick in the mud  
and be killed upon it by his enemy. The  
second curse comes from Parashuram.  
One day as Parashuram sleeps with his  
head in Karna’s lap, a beetle bores into  
Karna’s thigh, which in the epic is a  
euphemism for the genitals. Despite the  
pain and blood, Karna remains still so he  
will not disturb his sleeping **guru**. When  
Parashuram awakens, he realizes that  
Karna’s tolerance for pain means that he is  
a kshatriya, thus Karna has gained instruction under false pretenses. Parashuram  
curses Karna that at the critical moment,  
he will forget everything he has learned.  
Both of these curses eventually come true;  
despite fighting with great valor in the  
Mahabharata war, Karna is killed by  
Arjuna when the wheel of his chariot is  
stuck in the mud.  
On the eve of the great war, Karna’s  
mother, Kunti, comes to him and reveals  
his true identity and implores him to  
return and fight alongside his brothers.  
Karna refuses, saying that things have  
gone too far for such measures, but  
promises Kunti that he will not harm  
any of his brothers except for Arjuna,  
whom he has sworn to kill. In his decision Karna is also bound by his loyalty to  
Duryodhana, whose friendship and  
support for many years overrides any  
obligation to a family he has just discovered. As a man willing to stand by his  
friends and his principles, even in a  
cause he knows to be flawed, Karna  
endures as one of the tragic heroes of  
the *Mahabharata*.
