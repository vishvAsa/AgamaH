Himalayan peak in southwestern Tibet  
renowned as a pilgrimage place (**tirtha**)  
for both Hindus and Buddhists. In  
Hindu mythology, Kailas is believed to  
be Mount **Meru**, the center of the universe. It is also believed that the top of

Kailas  
Mount Kailas, overlooking the Chiu Monastery in Tibet. Kailas is considered to be the mythic  
Mount Meru, home of the god Shiva and the center of the universe.  
Mount Kailas is the place where the god  
**Shiva** makes his home. For both Hindus  
and Buddhists, the central act of pilgrimage to Kailas is to walk around the  
mountain, thus symbolically traversing  
the entire earth. The journey begins at  
**Manasarovar**, a lake near the mountainâ€™s base, which in Hindu mythology is  
esteemed as the lake of the gods. Many  
factors combine to make the sixty-fivemile circuit an extremely difficult journey: The area is extremely remote, the  
climate is harsh and unforgiving even in  
June (the customary pilgrimage time),  
and the circuit itself is physically strenuous, with its highest point over 19,000  
feet above sea level. Storms can suddenly  
arise at any time of the year, and pilgrims who are unprepared can easily die  
of exposure. Given these difficulties, relatively few people perform this pilgrimage; it raises the status of those who do.  
For many years Chinese prohibition**s** on  
travel in Tibet made it impossible for  
people to undertake this pilgrimage.  
Since the early 1990s these rules have  
been relaxed and small groups of religious pilgrims are again making the  
sacred journey.
