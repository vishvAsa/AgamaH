Traditional Indian society was modeled  
as a collection of **endogamous**, or intermarrying, subgroups known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). The jatis were organized  
(and their social status determined)  
by the group’s hereditary occupation,  
over which each group held a monopoly.  
The Kayasths worked as scribes and  
recorders. They were mostly associated  
with maintaining business and  
mercantile records, accounting, and  
keeping businesses running smoothly  
and profitably.
