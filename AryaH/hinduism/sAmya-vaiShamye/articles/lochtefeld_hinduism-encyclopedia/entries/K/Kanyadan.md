(“gift of a virgin”) In its most specific  
sense, the kanyadan is the part of the  
traditional wedding ceremony in which  
the bride’s father (or guardian) formally  
transfers her to her husband’s family. In  
a more general sense, the word refers to  
giving a **daughter** in marriage to another  
family. This “gift” is believed to be highly  
commendable for the father, since the  
bride is supposed to be given without

Kanyadan  
asking for anything in return. At the  
same time, the status difference  
between the bride’s family (as wife  
“givers”) and the groom’s (as wife “takers”) can make this “gift” an extremely  
expensive proposition for the bride’s  
family. See **Dowry**.
