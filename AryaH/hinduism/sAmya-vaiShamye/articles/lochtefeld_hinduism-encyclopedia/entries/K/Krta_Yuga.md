title = "Krta Yuga"

+++
A particular age of the world in one of  
the reckonings of **cosmic time**.  
According to traditional belief, time has  
neither beginning nor end, but alternates between cycles of creation and  
activity, followed by cessation and quietude. Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32  
billion years; the active phase is known  
as the **Day of Brahma**, and the quiet  
phase as the Night of Brahma. In one  
reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of  
Brahma is divided into one thousand  
**mahayugas** (“great cosmic ages”), each  
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.  
Each mahayuga is composed of four  
constituent yugas, named the Krta Yuga,  
**Treta Yuga**, **Dvapara Yuga**, and **Kali**  
**Yuga**. Each of these four yugas is shorter  
than its predecessor and ushers in an  
era more degenerate and depraved than  
the preceding one. By the end of the Kali  
Yuga, things have gotten so bad that the  
only solution is the destruction and  
recreation of the earth, at which time  
the next Krta era begins.  
The Krta Yuga is the first of the four  
yugas, and at 1,728,000 years, it is by far  
the longest. It is also considered to be  
the best of all the yugas, symbolized by  
gold, the most valuable of all metals. In a  
dice game played in ancient India, the  
side designated Krta was the one for the  
winning throw, representing the best  
possible option. In the mythic descriptions of the Krta Yuga, people live  
extremely long times, are of tremendous  
physical stature, and by nature, are completely virtuous.
