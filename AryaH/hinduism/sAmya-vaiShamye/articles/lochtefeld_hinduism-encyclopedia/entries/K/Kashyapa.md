In Hindu mythology, Kashyapa is the  
chief of the **Prajapatis** (a class of semidivine beings) and the father of **Garuda**,  
the divine eagle who serves as the animal “vehicle” for the god **Vishnu**.  
Kashyapa is also one of the Seven Sages  
whose names mark exogamous clan  
“lineages” (**gotra**); the others are  
**Gautama**, **Bharadvaja**, **Vasishtha**,  
**Bhrgu**, **Atri**, and **Vishvamitra**. All **brahmins** are believed to be descended from  
these seven sages, with each family taking the name of its progenitor as its  
gotra name. In modern times, gotras are  
still important, since marriage within  
the gotra is forbidden. After her marriage, the new bride adopts her husband’s gotra as part of her new identity.
