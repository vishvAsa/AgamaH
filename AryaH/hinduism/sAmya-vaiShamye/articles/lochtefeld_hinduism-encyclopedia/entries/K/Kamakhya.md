title = "Kamakhya"

+++
(“desiring eyes”) A particular manifestation of the Mother **Goddess**, whose temple on **Nilachal Hill** overlooks the  
Brahmaputra River just outside the city  
of Guwahati in **Assam**. This temple is  
one of the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of  
sites that spreads throughout the subcontinent and is sacred to the Goddess.  
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a  
body part of the dismembered goddess  
**Sati** fell to earth, taking form there as a  
different goddess. The Kamakhya temple is the place where Sati’s vulva fell to  
earth. Its image of the goddess is a natural cleft in the rock, around which the  
temple has been built. Since Kamakhya  
sprang from the most sexually charged  
part of the female body, it is no surprise  
that she is believed to be extremely powerful. Like many powerful goddesses,  
her productive capacity must be constantly recharged through receiving sacrifices, especially the **blood** of living  
beings. In modern times the usual **sacrifice** is a goat, but in earlier times the  
**offering** of **human sacrifices** is well  
documented. Kamakhya was reportedly  
offered 140 men when her present temple was consecrated in 1565. This practice continued until the British halted it  
in 1832. The men offered as human sacrifices were reportedly volunteers who  
believed that they had been called by  
her to do this. In the time between  
announcing their intention to be sacrificed and their deaths, they were treated  
as virtual divinities, since they were considered to have been consecrated to the  
goddess. For further information see
