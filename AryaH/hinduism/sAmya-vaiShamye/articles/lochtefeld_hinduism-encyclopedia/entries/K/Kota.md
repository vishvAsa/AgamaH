title = "Kota"

+++
City on the Chambal River in the modern state of **Rajasthan**, about 100 miles  
south of Jaipur. Before India’s independence, Kota was the capital of a small  
kingdom with the same name. Kota was  
one of the centers of the **Rajasthani**  
style of **miniature painting**, a genre  
used to depict Hindu religious themes,  
particularly incidents in the life of  
**Krishna**. The Kota style is considered a  
derivative of the **Bundi** style because  
Kota was ruled by a junior member of  
the Bundi royal family. Both styles are  
marked by their attention to nature,  
shown by detailed depictions of trees  
surrounding the paintings’ subjects. The

Kota  
Kota style is marked by elements of the  
landscape looming out of proportion,  
giving the pictures a lush feel. For further information see W. G. Archer,
