title = "Krishna Deva Raya"

+++
(r. 1509â€“1530) Most important ruler in  
the **Vijayanagar dynasty**, the last of the  
great southern Hindu kingdoms.  
During his rule, Vijayanagar reached its  
zenith. Krishna Deva Raya defeated the  
Deccani sultans to the north, although  
he reinstated them as vassals. He conquered the eastern coast all the way to  
**Orissa** and maintained good trading  
relationships with the newly-arrived  
Portuguese, although he refused to  
become involved in their politics. His  
reign was a time of artistic achievement and general prosperity, evident  
in the artifacts of the time. His successors were not as successful, however.  
Less than forty years after his death,  
the coalition of the Deccani sultans  
defeated Rama Raja at the battle of  
**Talikota**. The Vijayanagar kingdom was  
completely destroyed.
