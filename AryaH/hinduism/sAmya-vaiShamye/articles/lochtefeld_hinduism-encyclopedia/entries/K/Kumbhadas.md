title = "Kumbhadas"

+++
(early 16th c.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions of  
these poets were used for liturgical purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a religious community whose members are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of **Krishna**. In the Pushti Marg’s sectarian  
literature, all eight poets are named as  
members of the community and as associates of either the community’s founder,  
**Vallabhacharya**, or his successor, **Vitthalnath**. Kumbhadas is traditionally associated with Vallabhacharya. Little is known  
about Kumbhadas, although it is believed  
that he was born in 1469. His poetry  
describes the five **modes of devotion**  
described by **Rupa Goswami**, particularly  
the mode known as **madhurya** (“honeyed”). Madhurya describes the relationship between **deity** and devotee, using the  
language of lover and beloved, in which  
each has passionate love for the other.
