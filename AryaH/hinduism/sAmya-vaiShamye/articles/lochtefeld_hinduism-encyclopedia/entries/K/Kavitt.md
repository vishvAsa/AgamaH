title = "Kavitt"

+++
A particular **meter**, or rhythm pattern,  
in **Hindi** poetry. Verses composed in  
the Kavitt meter have four lines of  
thirty-one syllables each, with the  
break in each individual line often  
coming after the sixteenth syllable.  
This is an unusually long meter, thus  
lending itself well to extended  
descriptions employing alliteration;  
in his **Kavitavali**, the poet-saint  
**Tulsidas** uses this meter with great  
affect to describe battle scenes.
