title = "Samskara"

+++
The thirteenth of the sixteen traditional  
life-cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**). The  
ceremony was performed by a young  
man in the **brahmacharin** (celibate student) **stage of life** and marked the first  
time he shaved his beard. According to  
tradition, this rite was followed by giving  
a gift to the teacher, ideally a **cow**. By ritualizing his first shave, the keshanta  
samskara was a way to mark the young  
manâ€™s changing status. After this he was  
responsible for remaining clean-shaven,  
as one more of the rules for maintaining  
ritual **purity**. In modern times this rite is  
no longer observed. See also **shaving**.
