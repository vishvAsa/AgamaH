title = "Kiritamakuta"

+++
A high crown, sometimes topped with  
a knob, studded with jewels and  
other ornamentation. In Hindu iconography the kiritamakuta is associated  
with the god **Vishnu**, particularly in  
his manifestation as **Narayana**. For  
Vishnu, the kingly imagery conveyed by  
this crown reinforces his claim to be  
ruler of the universe.
