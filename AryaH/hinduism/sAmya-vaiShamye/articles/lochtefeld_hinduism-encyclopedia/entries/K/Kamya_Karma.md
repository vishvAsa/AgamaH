title = "Kamya Karma"

+++
(“desiderative [ritual] action”) One of  
three general categories of ritual action,  
the others being **nitya karma** and  
**naimittika karma**. Kamya karma is a ritual performed solely for the performer’s  
desire (**kama**) to obtain the benefits of  
this action. Unlike the other two categories, which must be performed at specific times or occasions, this one is  
completely voluntary and based solely  
on the desire for its benefits. One example of a kamya karma is religious pilgrimage, which one is not required to do  
but which is believed to generate religious merit. Another example would be  
performing a particular **vrat**, or religious  
vow, which might be done daily, weekly,  
monthly, or yearly.
