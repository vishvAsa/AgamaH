The Nagara style is found throughout  
northern and eastern India. One of its  
prominent features is a **shikhara** or  
tower. The shikhara is often surrounded  
by smaller towers that lead the eye up to  
the highest point, which is directly over  
the image of the temple’s primary **deity**.  
Within this general pattern there are two  
variants, exemplified by the temples at  
**Khajuraho** and **Orissa**.  
In Khajuraho the series of shikharas are connected, forming a continuous rising swell that draws the eye  
upward, similar to a series of hills  
leading to a distant peak. This verticality is accentuated through the use of  
turrets (**urushringas**) on the sides of  
the towers, which replicate the shape  
of the final peak. The entire temple is  
set on a raised base (**adhishthana**).  
Within the temple there are usually  
several different zones: an entrance  
porch (**ardhamandapa**), a hall (**mandapa**), an intermediate area (**antarala**),  
and a central shrine (**garbhagrha**) surrounded by a processional path

Nagara  
Built in the Nagara style, the Triloknath Temple in Mandi consists of a series of towers,  
the largest of which contains an image of the presiding deity.  
(**pradakshina**). Despite their different  
parts, temples built in the Khajuraho  
style convey the artistic impression of  
an integrated, unified whole.  
The Orissan style emphasizes the  
contrast between the temple’s constituent parts. The two central components are the entrance hall (**jagamohan**)  
and the beehive-shaped temple tower  
(**deul**). The tower is often three or four  
times taller than the entrance hall, a difference that tends to heighten the contrast between the two. Other sections  
include a dance-hall (**natamandira**),  
traditionally used for performances, and  
a “food pavilion” (**bhogamandapa**),  
where the **prasad** was cooked. These  
architectural elements are connected  
like beads on a string, as seemingly separable parts lined up with one another.  
The most important temples in the  
Orissan style are the **Lingaraja Temple**  
in **Bhubaneshvar**, the **Jagannath**  
temple in **Puri**, and the **Sun Temple**  
at **Konarak**.
