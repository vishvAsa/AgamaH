The Nayars are a Hindu **jati** who traditionally were the primary landholding  
community in traditional **Kerala**. Jatis  
are **endogamous** subgroups of traditional Indian society whose social status  
is determined by the group’s hereditary  
occupation. The Nayars were one of the  
few groups in India to practice **matrilinear succession**, in which both descent  
and **inheritance** were passed on  
through the mother’s line.
