Traditional Indian society was modeled  
as a collection of **endogamous**, or intermarried, subgroups known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which the  
group held a monopoly. The Nai jati’s  
occupation was barbering, a low status  
job because it required continual contact with cut human hair, considered  
a source of impurity (ashaucha). In  
many instances the Nais also served  
as messengers.
