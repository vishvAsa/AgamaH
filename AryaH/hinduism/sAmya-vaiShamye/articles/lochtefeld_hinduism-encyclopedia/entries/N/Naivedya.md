(“to be presented”) The thirteenth of the  
sixteen traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to a **deity** as part of **worship**.  
To treat the deity as an honored guest, a  
person may offer food. The food is often  
returned to the worshipers as **prasad**, the  
sanctified food bearing the deity’s **grace**.  
The offering may be done in various ways,  
but the underlying motive for all the  
upacharas is to show one’s love for the  
deity and attend to the deity’s needs.
