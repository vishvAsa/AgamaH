title = "Nandigrama"

In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Hindu epics, Nandigrama is a village outside the city of **Ayodhya**, where  
Prince **Bharata** sets up the royal court  
460  
Nanddas  
Statue of Nandi, the bull who is the god  
Shiva’s vehicle.  
during his brother **Rama’s** absence.  
Bharata’s mother **Kaikeyi** uses her influence to banish Rama for fourteen years,  
putting Bharata on the throne in his  
place. At Rama’s command, Bharata  
agrees to act as the temporary king, but  
with two symbolic adjustments. The first  
is that Bharata moves the royal court  
from the capital city of Ayodhya to the  
village of Nandigrama, as a symbol of  
Rama’s exile; the second is that throughout his regency, Bharata sits at the foot  
of the royal throne, upon which is  
placed a pair of Rama’s sandals, symbolizing that Rama is the rightful ruler.  
Thus, Nandigrama is a symbol of  
Bharata’s righteousness.
