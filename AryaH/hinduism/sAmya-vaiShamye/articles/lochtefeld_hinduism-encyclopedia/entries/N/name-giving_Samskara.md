title = "(“name-giving”) Samskara"

+++
The fifth of the traditional life-cycle  
ceremonies (**samskaras**), during which  
the newborn child is given a name.  
Although some commentators believe  
457  
Namakarana (“name-giving”) Samskara  
Namakarana samskara being performed on an  
infant, who in this photo is wrapped in cloth for  
protection from the evil eye.  
that this rite should be done on the day  
of **birth**, many others insist that it  
should be on the tenth day, indicating  
a difference between birth and the  
social ritual of name-giving. Some  
believe that the child’s name should  
begin with the first letter of the  
**nakshatra** (sign in the lunar **zodiac**) in  
which the child is born; this practice is  
still widespread in northern India.  
Although the classical form of this rite  
has largely fallen into disuse, naming  
ceremonies are still an important part  
of the birth of a child.
