title = "Natya"

+++
The word *natya* refers to the genre in  
classical Indian **dance** in which the  
dancer’s movements convey a story to  
the audience. Natya is one of the two  
most basic dance genres. The other  
genre, **nrtya**, is “pure” dance, in which  
the dance conveys nothing more than  
the dancer’s skill.
