title = "Nadi"

(“tube”) In general, the word *nadi* may  
be applied to any pipe or tube,  
whether in plumbing or the human  
circulatory system. A nadi has a more  
specialized meaning with regard to  
the Hindu conception of the **subtle**  
**body**. The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system, existing on a  
different plane than gross matter, but  
corresponding to the material body. It  
consists of six psychic centers  
(**chakras**), visualized as multipetaled  
lotus flowers running roughly along  
the spine, connected by three vertical  
channels known as nadis. Of these,  
the **ida nadi** is on the left side, the  
**pingala nadi** on the right, and the  
**sushumna** in the center.
