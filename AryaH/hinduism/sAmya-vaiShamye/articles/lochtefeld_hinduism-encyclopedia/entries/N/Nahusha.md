title = "Nahusha"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a king of the lunar  
dynasty, and a paradigm for a person  
454  
Nageshvar  
afflicted with self-pride. Through  
amassing religious merits, Nahusha succeeds to the throne of **Indra**, the king of  
the gods, who has gone into hiding  
because of an evil deed. Nahusha is  
filled with lust for Indra’s wife, **Indrani**.  
He tries to act on it despite the obvious  
improprieties of approaching another  
man’s wife and a mortal making a claim  
on a **goddess**. Nahusha sets off for  
Indrani’s palace in a **palanquin**. In his  
impatience, he whips the palanquin  
bearers, saying “Sarpa, sarpa” (“Move!  
Move!”). Unfortunately for Nahusha,  
one of the bearers is **Agastya**, the sage.  
For Nahusha’s lust and disrespect,  
Agastya curses him to become a  
snake (sarpa). Nahusha remains a  
serpent for many years but is released  
from the **curse** by the sight of the  
**Pandava** brothers.
