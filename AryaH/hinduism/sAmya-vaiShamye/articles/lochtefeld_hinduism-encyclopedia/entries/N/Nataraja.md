Form of the god **Shiva** as the “Lord of  
the **Dance**.” The most famous Nataraja  
image is in the temple-town of  
**Chidambaram** in the state of  
**Tamil Nadu**. The temple was erected  
during the reign of Vira Raja (927–997  
C.E.), with Nataraja as its primary **deity**.  
However, the image of Nataraja is well  
known, particularly from the southern  
Indian **bronzes** of the **Chola dynasty**  
(9th–13th c).  
As a divinity, one of Shiva’s most  
important characteristics is that he transcends all duality; the Nataraja image  
symbolizes this concept. Shiva dances  
within a circle of fire, symbolizing birth  
and death, but remains untouched by  
these forces. As Shiva dances, his matted  
locks swing wildly, showing the force of

his activity, yet his face stays impassive  
and unmoved. One of his four hands  
holds the drum that beats the rhythm of  
creation, while a second hand holds the  
fire of destruction. His third hand is held  
palm upward in a **gesture** meaning “fear  
not.” The fourth points to his upraised  
foot, the symbol of refuge and divine  
mercy for the devotee (**bhakta**). His  
other foot crushes a **demon**, displaying  
his power to destroy the wicked. The  
image is a well-developed theological  
statement, able to be “read” by those  
who can interpret it.  
In Nataraja’s charter myth, Shiva and  
**Kali**, the **goddess**, decide to settle their

competition with a dance contest. Shiva  
finally bests Kali by manifesting as  
Nataraja and doing an athletic  
(**tandava**) dance style that Kali’s feminine modesty prevents her from copying. Mythic roots aside, the Nataraja  
temple at Chidambaram has been an  
important center for classical Indian  
dance for well over a thousand years.  
The temple’s eastern wall bears relief  
carvings of the 108 basic dance positions (**karanas**). These positions are  
central to classical Indian dance, particularly in the **Bharatanatyam** school,  
which is the major dance tradition in  
**Tamil Nadu**.
