(“without form”) Epithet of the divine  
reality in its ultimate aspect. According  
to many Hindu traditions, God is ultimately without form, transcending all  
particularity and superior to any particular image. This belief is first phrased in  
the **Upanishads**, the speculative religious texts that are the most recent part  
of the **Vedas**, and is advocated by the  
philosophical traditions based on the  
Upanishads, such as **Advaita Vedanta**.  
This concept is opposed by certain  
Hindu theistic traditions, such as the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious community,  
in which a particular **deity**—in this  
case, **Krishna**—is conceived as the  
Ultimate Reality.
