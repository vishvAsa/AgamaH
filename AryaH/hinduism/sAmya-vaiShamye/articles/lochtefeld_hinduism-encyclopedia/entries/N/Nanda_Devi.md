Nanda Devi is the name for one of the  
tallest mountains in India, rising over  
25,000 feet, in the Kumaon region of the  
**Himalayas**. Nanda Devi is also a form of  
the **Goddess** who is identified with that  
mountain. With Nanda Devi, as for  
many of the other **goddesses** of India,  
divinity and the natural landscape are  
inextricably connected. Nanda Devi is a  
local Himalayan goddess who presides  
over the **Garhwal** and Kumaon regions.  
People in the region consider her to be a  
“daughter” of the region, who had to  
change her residence when she married  
the god **Shiva**. Nanda Devi’s songs and  
rites show strong connections with the  
459  
Nanda Devi  
life-cycle journeys of Himalayan  
**women**. Songs associated with Nanda  
Devi describe the difficulty of going  
from her natal home to her marital  
home, a reality for many Himalayan  
women. In the same way, Nanda Devi’s  
pilgrimages, which emphasize journeys  
through the hills surrounding the  
mountain, imitate the women’s periodic  
journeys back to their own natal villages.  
A major part of Nanda Devi’s mythology  
is the adoption of an abandoned buffalo  
calf, which is later discovered to be a  
**demon** in buffalo form. The buffalo  
demon grows large and troublesome,  
and is eventually slain by Nanda Devi.  
This myth parallels the narrative in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest and most  
important source for the mythology of  
the Goddess; this is the most influential  
text used in Nanda Devi’s **worship**. For  
further information on Nanda Devi, her  
rites, and her connection with  
Himalayan society, see William Sax,  
*Mountain Goddess*, 1991.
