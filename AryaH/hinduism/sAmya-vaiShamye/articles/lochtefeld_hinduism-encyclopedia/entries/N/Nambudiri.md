Southern Indian **brahmin** community, which is a sub-division of the  
**Dravida** brahmins, one of five southern Indian brahmin communities  
(**Pancha Dravida**). The Nambudiris’  
traditional homeland is in the region  
that is now the modern state of  
**Kerala**. The Nambudiris are noted  
throughout India for their learning  
and piety. According to tradition, the  
great philosopher **Shankaracharya**  
was a Nambudiri brahmin. In his  
desire to revitalize Hindu religion,  
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one  
Hindu sacred center in each corner of  
the subcontinent, and at each established a **Dashanami Sanyasi** monastic center (**math**) to train learned  
monks. One of these sacred centers  
was at **Badrinath** in the **Himalayas**.  
According to the Badrinath temple  
records, for several hundred years the  
temple **worship** was performed by  
the **Dandi Sanyasis**, who were also  
Nambudiri brahmins. When the last  
of these died without a successor in  
1776, the local king, who served as the  
protector of the shrine, invited a non**ascetic** Nambudiri brahmin to serve  
as the temple’s priest. This priest was  
given the title **rawal** (“deputy”), and  
his extended family has maintained  
the shrine since then. The rawal was  
the only person allowed to touch the  
image of the presiding **deity**. As a  
consequence he was required to  
remain a bachelor, lest the ritual  
impurity arising from the **birth** of a  
child (**sutakashaucha**) render him  
unable to attend to his duties. For a  
long time the rawals had sole rights to  
the **offerings** given at the shrine, but  
since 1939 the temple has been managed by a committee, and the rawal  
has been restricted to ritual duties.
