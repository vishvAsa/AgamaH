title = "Nammalvar"

+++
(10th c.) The most prolific composer of all  
the **Alvars**, a group of twelve poet-saints  
who lived in southern India between the  
seventh and tenth centuries. All the  
Alvars were devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**. They emphasized passionate  
devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god, conveyed through hymns sung in the **Tamil**  
**language**, which transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. According to  
tradition, Nammalvar was born into a  
princely family, but was completely disinterested with life in the world. His distraught parents eventually abandoned  
him. Nammalvar crawled into the hollow  
of a giant tamarind tree, where he sat in  
silent meditation. He remained there  
until the arrival of his disciple  
**Mathurakavi**, who managed to rouse  
him by posing a question on the nature of  
the Self. Nammalvar immediately poured  
forth more than one thousand hymns to  
Vishnu, each beginning with the last  
word of the previous hymn. These hymns  
are known as the **Tiruvaymoli** (“holy  
words”). This collection of 1,102 stanzas  
is the concluding section of the **Nalayira**  
**Divyaprabandham**, the collected hymns  
of the Alvars. For further information see
