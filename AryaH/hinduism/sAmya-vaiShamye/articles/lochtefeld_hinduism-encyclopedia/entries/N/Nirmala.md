(“free from defilement”) With the  
**Udasis**, one of the two Hindu **ascetic**  
communities tracing its origins to the  
Sikh community. According to one tradition, the Nirmala sect was established  
by the tenth Sikh **guru**, Gobind Singh.  
On the whole, the Sikh tradition has not  
endorsed **asceticism**, but rather an  
active life in the world. The Nirmalas  
have a large ascetic center in the northern Indian sacred city of **Haridwar**,  
where they run a primary school. As a  
community, the Nirmalas are known far  
more for learning and study than asceticism or **yoga**. At the **Kumbha Melas**, the  
Nirmalas bathe last of all, after the  
**Sanyasis**, **Bairagis**, and Udasis.
