title = "Nayak Dynasty"

+++
Southern Indian dynasty whose capital  
was in the city of **Madurai** in the state of  
**Tamil Nadu**. The Nayaks came to power  
in the political vacuum created by the  
destruction of the **Vijayanagar dynasty**  
late in the sixteenth century. The Nayaks  
ruled the southernmost part of the subcontinent for about the next hundred  
years. The dynasty’s greatest ruler was  
**Tirumalai Nayak** (r. 1623–1659), who  
constructed large sections of the  
**Minakshi** temple, dedicated to  
Madurai’s patron **goddess**, Minakshi.
