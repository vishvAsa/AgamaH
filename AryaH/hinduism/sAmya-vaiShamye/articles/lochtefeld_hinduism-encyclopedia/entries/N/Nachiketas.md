title = "Nachiketas"

+++
A primary character in the **Kathka**  
**Upanishad**, a speculative philosophical  
text considered one of the later **upanishads**. In the text, the boy Nachiketas is  
the seeker of ultimate wisdom. In a fit of  
anger his father curses him to be given  
to Death; Nachiketas obediently goes to  
the house of Death to give himself up.  
He waits for three days at Death’s door,  
but receives none of the hospitality due  
to a **brahmin** guest. When Death returns  
he is disturbed to discover that his guest  
has been neglected. To atone for the  
lapse, Death offers Nachiketas three  
boons. With his first two, Nachiketas  
wishes to return to his father and to  
understand the meaning of a particular  
sacrificial ritual. With the final boon he  
asks what happens to a person after the  
death of the body. Death first tries to  
evade the question, then tries to bribe  
Nachiketas with other gifts. When the  
boy holds firm in his resolve, Death  
begins to reveal his secrets. This discourse makes up the bulk of the text.  
Death’s secrets focus mainly on the

Nachiketas  
reality of the Self (**atman**), its eternal  
and indestructible nature, and the difficulties in truly knowing it. The Self is  
portrayed as the ultimate truth, and to  
know it is to know the only thing that  
really matters.
