Renunciant **ascetic** community founded  
by the sage **Gorakhnath**. The  
Nathpanthis are also known by many  
names: as **jogis** (from their emphasis on  
the practice of **yoga**), Gorakhnathis  
(from the name of their founder),  
**Kanphatas** (meaning “split-ear” by  
virtue of the signature earrings placed in  
the split cartilage of both ears), **Gosains**  
(“master of the senses”), and simply as  
**Naths** (“lord”) from the characteristic  
suffix taken as part of their names upon  
ascetic **initiation**. The Nathpanthis are a  
very old organization and have a long  
tradition in northern India, but their  
historical record is relatively faint. The  
organization has no single organizing  
body; their emphasis on yoga has meant  
that their practice has been internalized,  
rather than focused on temples or other  
material objects. Although the  
Nathpanthis are usually described as  
devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**, they are distinct from the **Shaiva Sanyasis**.  
The spiritual practice of the Naths  
has traditionally focused on the mastery  
466  
Nath  
of the **subtle body** as the means to final  
liberation of the soul. The Naths believe  
that liberation is physical immortality,  
rather than escape from the cycle of  
transmigration, which is more commonly accepted. The subtle body is an  
alternate physiological system, believed  
to exist on a different plane than gross  
matter, but corresponding to the material body. It is visualized as a set of six  
psychic centers (**chakras**) running  
roughly along the spine; above and  
below these centers reside two divine  
principles, Shiva (awareness) and  
**Shakti** (power). The aspirant aims to  
join these two principles at the crown  
of the head, thus transforming the  
perishable elements in the gross body  
into immortality.  
Among the Nathpanthis, the dominant metaphor for talking about this  
process is the union of **sun** and **moon**.  
The sun, identified with Shakti, stands  
for the processes of change and destruction, whereas the moon, identified with  
Shiva, symbolizes stability and immortality. In some cases this union of sun  
and moon is described in very abstract  
terms; for example, in the definition of  
**hatha yoga** “ha” refers to the sun and  
“tha” refers to the moon. Other abstract  
descriptions of this process speak of  
gaining equilibrium of the **vital winds**  
(**prana**), or yogic union in the subtle  
body. In other cases this union is symbolized in concrete ways, as in the practice of **vajroli mudra**. This sexual  
practice uses urethral suction or the  
“fountain-pen technique,” by which a  
man, having ejaculated into his female  
partner, draws his **semen** back into his  
body. The semen has been refined  
through contact with the woman’s uterine blood.  
The Nathpanthis have been important both as an ascetic community in  
their own right, and as an influence on  
many of the northern Indian **bhakti**  
poet-saints, particularly **Kabir**. Their  
religious practice has consistently  
stressed internal religion, in which  
individual realization has been deemed  
far more important than performing  
social duties or established **worship**.
