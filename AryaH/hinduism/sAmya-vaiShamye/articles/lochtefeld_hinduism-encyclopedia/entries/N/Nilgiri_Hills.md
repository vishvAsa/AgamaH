title = "Nilgiri Hills"

+++
Range of hills formed by the conjunction of the Western and Eastern Ghats,  
located at the junction of three southern  
Indian statesâ€”**Tamil Nadu**, **Kerala**, and  
**Karnataka**. In earlier times the hills  
were occupied by a tribal people known  
as the Todas, although only a few thousand Todas are left today. This region is  
important for its hill stations, such as  
Ootacamund and Kodaikanal, which are  
popular spots for vacations, honeymoons, and movie filming.
