The Nasik Mela is the celebration of the  
**Kumbha Mela** at Nasik. The Kumbha  
Mela is a religious festival celebrated in  
four different locations: **Haridwar**,  
**Allahabad**, **Ujjain**, and **Nasik**. The festival’s focus is bathing (**snana**) in the  
sacred rivers during particularly holy  
moments. The Kumbha Mela’s primary  
participants are **ascetics**, who come  
from all over southern Asia to bathe  
in the sacred waters. According to  
463  
Nasik Mela  
tradition, the Kumbha Mela was organized  
by the great philosopher **Shankaracharya**  
to promote regular gatherings of learned  
and holy men, as a means to strengthen,  
sustain, and spread the Hindu religion.  
The timing for each of these festivals is  
determined by the position of the **sun**  
and the **planet Jupiter**; the twelve years  
between these festivals correspond to  
Jupiter’s orbit. The Nasik Mela is celebrated during the **lunar month** of  
**Shravan** (July–August), when the planet  
Jupiter is in the sign of Leo. This is the  
least important of all four Kumbha  
Melas, attended mostly by ascetics.
