title = "Nayachandra Suri"

+++
(14th c.) The author of the *Hammiramahakavya*, a **Sanskrit** drama that  
chronicles the defeat and death of the  
**Rajput** king Hammira by the Delhi sultan Alauddin Khilji in 1301. Aside from  
its historical value, this play is notable  
because Nayachandra Suri was a Jain  
monk. Although Jain monks are subject  
to a strict religious lifestyle that would  
seem to cut them off from the world,  
they have a long history of deep involvement with intellectual and literary culture. See also **mahakavya**.
