title = "Nirjala Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance on the eleventh  
day (**ekadashi**) in the bright, waxing half  
of the **lunar month** of **Jyeshth** (May–  
June). As for all the eleventh-day observances, this is dedicated to the **worship**  
of the god **Vishnu**. Most Hindu festivals  
have certain prescribed rites, which  
usually involve fasting (**upavasa**) and  
worship, and often promise specific  
benefits for faithful performance. The  
regulations for this ekadashi are more  
strict than all the others. Not only is all  
food forbidden, but the person performing this rite must not drink **water**,  
hence the name *nirjala* meaning  
“waterless.” The fast must last from  
dawn till dusk. This is no easy task,  
since this ekadashi occurs during the  
hottest part of the **year**. The rewards are  
great: Those who fulfill the vow for this  
single ekadashi receive the religious  
merit for all twenty-four ekadashis during the year, whether or not they have  
done the rites for the others. Carrying  
out the vow for this ekadashi is also  
believed to bring one a long life and liberation of the soul after death.
