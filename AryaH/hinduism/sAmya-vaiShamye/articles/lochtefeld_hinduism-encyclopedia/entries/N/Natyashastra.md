title = "Natyashastra"

+++
Prescriptive manual (**shastra**) for the performing arts written during the second  
century, whose authorship is ascribed to  
the mythical sage **Bharata**. The text is  
divided into thirty-seven sections, detailing every aspect of the three major performance forms: music, drama, and  
**dance** (which combines both music and  
drama). Some sections of the text are  
devoted to aesthetics and poetics, helping to create and convey the correct  
atmosphere for the appreciation of the  
arts. Other parts of the text discuss concrete, practical issues, such as the construction of the stage. The text is still an  
authority for these three performing arts,  
but it is particularly important for dance.  
Many of the positions and gestures found  
in Indian dance were first codified in this  
text; the *Natyashastra* remains the ultimate authority for any dance form that  
claims to be “classical” dance, rather than  
“folk” dance.
