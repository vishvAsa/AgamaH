title = "Navadvip"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) on the Hugli  
River, about sixty-five miles north of the  
city of Calcutta. Navadvip is traditionally  
regarded as the birthplace of the Bengali  
saint **Chaitanya** (1486â€“1533), although  
in the twentieth century, the same claim  
has been made for the city of **Mayapur**,  
on the other side of the river. For  
extensive information about Navadvip,  
see E. Alan Morinis, *Pilgrimage in the*  
*Hindu Tradition*, 1984.
