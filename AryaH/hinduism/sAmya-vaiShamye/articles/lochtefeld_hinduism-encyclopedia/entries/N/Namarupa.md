title = "Namarupa"

+++
Literally, this word means “name [and  
physical] form,” two of the most identifiable and enduring aspects of a person. In philosophical discourse, the  
term *namarupa* is often used pejoratively to designate all aspects of personality that are ultimately ephemeral  
but help reinforce the illusion of a  
diverse world and a Self with an independent identity. These notions of  
independence are thought to be ultimately false since one’s name and form  
will be different in one’s next **birth**. In  
this context, namarupa designates all  
that is provisionally real.
