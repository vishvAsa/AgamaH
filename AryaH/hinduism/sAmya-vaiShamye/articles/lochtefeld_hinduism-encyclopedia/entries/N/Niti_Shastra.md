(“instructions on diplomacy”) General  
name for a genre of instruction that  
taught politically astute behaviors, such  
as making friends and allegiances,  
intimidating one’s enemies, and knowing who can be trusted. This was a recognized branch of learning in the  
traditional Hindu sciences, and was  
taught to influential and royal families,  
for whom knowing the real workings  
of the world was considered essential  
to fulfilling their social functions. The  
fables of the **Panchatantra** convey  
these hard-edged lessons on selfinterest and caution through the use of  
animal characters.
