title = "Nath"

+++
(“lord”) Epithet of the god **Shiva**, based  
on his power as the ultimate lord.  
Among the **Nathpanthis**, a renunciant  
**ascetic** community whose members are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of Shiva, “Nath” is  
added to the end of one’s name after  
final ascetic **initiation** as a symbol of  
membership. This practice apparently  
dates from the Nathpanthis’ earliest  
days, since according to tradition they  
were founded by the sage **Gorakhnath**.
