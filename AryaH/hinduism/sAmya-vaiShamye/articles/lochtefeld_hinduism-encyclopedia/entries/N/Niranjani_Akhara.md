title = "Niranjani Akhara"

+++
The name of a subgroup of the **Naga**  
class of **Dashanami Sanyasis**; a particular type of renunciant **ascetic**. The  
Dashanami Sanyasis are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**, organized  
into different **akharas** or regiments on  
the model of an army. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the  
Dashanami Sanyasis’ primary occupation was as mercenary soldiers,  
although they also had substantial trading interests; both of these have largely  
disappeared in contemporary times.  
The Niranjani Akhara is one of the seven  
main Dashanami Sanyasi akharas and  
along with the **Mahanirvani Akhara** is  
one of the most powerful. This power is  
clearly shown by their respective positions in the bathing (**snana**) processions  
at the **Kumbha Mela** festivals: in  
**Haridwar** the Niranjani Akhara goes  
first, followed by the Mahanirvani; at  
**Allahabad** the order is reversed. In 1962  
the **Juna Akhara** acquired the status of a  
separate procession, rather than as a  
subsidiary of the Niranjani Akhara.  
According to the terms of the 1962  
agreement, at Haridwar the Juna Akhara  
would lead the Sanyasi processions for  
the bathing on the festival of **Shivaratri**,  
followed by the Niranjani and  
Mahanirvani Akharas. The Niranjanis  
would be first for the other two major  
bathing days, followed by the Juna and  
Mahanirvani Akharas. The Niranjani  
Akhara’s ability to command the premier  
position is based primarily on their local  
strength: the Niranjani Akhara was quite  
powerful in Haridwar, where it still owns  
significant property. The Mahanirvani  
Akhara, however, was based in  
Allahabad. Another sign of the Niranjani  
Akhara’s status is that it has as a subsidiary group, the **Ananda Akhara**.  
All of the akharas have particular features that define their organizational  
identity, especially specific tutelary  
**deities**. The Niranjani Akhara’s tutelary  
deity is **Skanda**, the son of the deities  
Shiva and **Parvati**, and the celestial general commanding Shiva’s supernatural  
army. Aside from serving as an identifying marker, the choice of a celestial warrior reflects the akhara’s influence and  
former military strength.
