title = "Natamandira"

+++
In the temple **architecture** of **Orissa**,  
one of the major forms of the northern  
Indian **Nagara** style. The natamandira is  
the section of the temple found between  
the **bhogamandapa** (“food-pavilion”)  
and the **jagamohan**, or entrance hall  
leading to the main image. Natamandira  
literally means “**dance**-house.” In many  
Orissan temples the natamandira was  
used for performance, in particular for  
the **Orissi** dance style that was developed and sustained in these temples.  
The performances were partly for the  
aesthetic appreciation of the spectators,  
but mainly as an **offering** of entertainment to the **deity** himself. Although  
dances are still performed at the natamandiras as a part of **worship**, they are  
primarily staged for entertainment.
