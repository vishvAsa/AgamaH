title = "Nirvani (“liberated”) Ani"

+++
Among the **Bairagi Nagas**, renunciant  
**ascetics** who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Vishnu**, the Nirvanis are one of the three  
Naga **anis** (“armies”). The others are the  
**Nirmohis** and **Digambaras**. In earlier  
times these anis were actual fighting  
units who made their living as traders  
and mercenary soldiers, but in modern  
times they are mainly important for  
determining the order at the bathing  
(**snana**) processions at the **Kumbha**  
**Mela**. Of the three Naga anis, the  
Digambaras are the most important and  
take precedence at the Kumbha Mela.
