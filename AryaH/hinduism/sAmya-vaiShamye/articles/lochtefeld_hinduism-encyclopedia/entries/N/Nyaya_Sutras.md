title = "Nyaya Sutras"

+++
Foundational text for the **Nyaya** school,  
one of the **six schools** of traditional  
Hindu **philosophy**. The Nyaya Sutras  
are traditionally attributed to the  
philosopher **Gautama**; the most significant commentary was written by  
**Vatsyayana** in the fourth century. The  
Nyaya Sutras begin with an exposition  
of the cause of the human bondage,  
explained as stemming from a five-part  
**causal chain**: pain, **birth**, activity,  
defect, and wrong notion. Each of  
these elements is caused by the one  
succeeding it, and is eliminated with  
the destruction of its cause. The root  
cause for bondage and reincarnation  
(**samsara**) is thus wrong notions,  
which must be corrected to attain final  
liberation of the soul (**moksha**). In  
their quest for correct understanding,  
the Nyaya Sutras devote great attention  
to the **pramanas**, the means by which  
human beings can gain true and accurate knowledge, and to the rules and  
procedures for applying them. The  
Nyaya Sutras describe four such pramanas: perception (**pratyaksha**), inference (**anumana**), analogy (**upamana**),  
and authoritative testimony (**shabda**).  
These ideas are accepted by virtually all  
Indian philosophical schools and are  
the Nyayasâ€™ major contribution to  
Indian philosophy.
