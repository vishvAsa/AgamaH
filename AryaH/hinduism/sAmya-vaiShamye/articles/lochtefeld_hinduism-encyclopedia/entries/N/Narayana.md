title = "Narayana"

+++
Epithet of the god **Vishnu**. The name is  
traditionally interpreted as meaning  
“resting on the waters,” based on the  
claim that the word *nara*, which usually  
means “man,” in this case means  
“waters.” Narayana is the image of  
Vishnu in the time of cosmic dissolution  
(**pralaya**). He is reclining on his serpent  
couch, **Shesha**, in the midst of the cosmic sea, with his wife, **Lakshmi**, seated  
at his feet, and his vehicle, **Garuda**,  
standing by. Vishnu is the sole remaining agent in the cosmos, as its beginning  
and end. When the time for a new creation arrives, a lotus sprouts forth from  
Narayana’s navel, which opens to reveal  
the creator-god **Brahma**. The cycle of  
creation begins anew.
