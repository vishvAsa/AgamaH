title = "Nilachal Hill"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) overlooking the  
Brahmaputra River, about six miles outside the city of Guwahati in the modern  
state of **Assam**. Nilachal Hill is known  
for its temple to the **goddess Kamakhya**,  
one of the most powerful goddess temples in India. This site is one of the  
**Shakti Pithas**, a network of sites sacred  
to the Goddess which spreads throughout the subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha  
marks the site where a body part of the  
dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth**,  
taking form there as a different goddess.  
The Kamakhya temple is where Satiâ€™s  
vulva is said to have fallen to earth; the  
image of the goddess is a natural cleft in  
the rock around which the temple has  
been built. Since Kamakhya sprang from  
the most sexually charged part of the  
female body, the site is extremely powerful. See also **pitha**.
