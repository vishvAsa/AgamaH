title = "Narada Smrti"

+++
One of the **smrtis** or “remembered”  
texts, a class of literature deemed important, but less authoritative than the  
other textual category, the **shrutis** or  
“heard” texts. This smrti is ascribed to  
the sage **Narada**, and is an example of  
one of the **Dharma Shastras**, which  
were manuals prescribing rules for correct human behavior and ideal social  
life. Unlike the **Dharma Sutras**, which  
are ascribed to recognizable individuals,  
the Dharma Shastras are usually  
ascribed to mythic sages, a strategy used  
to reinforce the authority of these texts.  
The *Narada Smrti* exists in several versions, one of which is much longer than  
the others. All of the versions were written later than the **Manu Smrti** (1st c.  
B.C.E.?), since this text is mentioned in  
the preface. Narada’s text deals exclusively with the administration of justice  
(vyavahara), and treats this in exhaustive detail, with a strong emphasis on  
clarity and precision.
