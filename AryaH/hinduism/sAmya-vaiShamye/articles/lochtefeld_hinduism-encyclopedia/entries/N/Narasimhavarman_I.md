title = "Narasimhavarman I"

+++
(r. 630–668) **Pallava dynasty** ruler  
during its most vibrant era, when it  
was a stronghold of Tamil culture.  
Narasimhavarman succeeded his father  
**Mahendravarman**, who had been killed  
in a battle with the forces of  
the **Chalukya** king **Pulakeshin II**.  
Narasimhavarman avenged his father’s  
death by conquering the Chalukya kingdom and killing Pulakeshin II in battle,  
but the two kingdoms were so evenly  
matched that neither could retain control over the other. Like his father,  
Narasimhavarman was a great patron of  
the arts. It was during his reign that construction commenced on the great  
sculptures at **Mahabalipuram** in the  
state of **Tamil Nadu**. The most famous of  
these is a rock-cut **sculpture** depicting  
the myth of the Descent of the **Ganges**,  
in which a natural vertical fissure is used  
to lay out the river’s path.
