title = "Naladiyar"

+++
One of the most important pieces of  
early Tamil literature, along with its predecessor, the **Tirukkural**. The Naladiyar  
is a collection of four hundred verses  
that date from the fifth or sixth century.  
Mainly concerned with moral and ethical life, the verses were written by a  
group of Jain monks who found shelter  
with a pious king in time of famine. In  
gratitude each monk wrote one verse.  
Despite the *Naladiyar*â€™s sectarian origin,  
it has become the cultural property of  
Tamils from all religious communities;  
many of the verses have come into the  
language as proverbial sayings.
