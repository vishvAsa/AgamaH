(2) In Hindu mythology, the Nagas are a  
class of minor divinities who have the  
form of serpents. Their king is **Vasuki**. In  
popular Hinduism, Nagas are often considered to be the gods of a specific place.  
Often associated with fertility and  
fecundity, Nagas are usually believed to  
live in springs, ponds, and other small  
bodies of **water**. In Buddhist and Jain  
iconography the Nagas often play the  
role of minor protective **deities**. It is  
common to see a seated figure shadowed by an “umbrella” of Nagas.  
Although this is unusual in Hindu  
iconography, there may be remnants  
of this in the iconography of the god  
**Shiva**, who is often depicted wearing  
snakes for both his ornaments and his  
**sacred thread**.
