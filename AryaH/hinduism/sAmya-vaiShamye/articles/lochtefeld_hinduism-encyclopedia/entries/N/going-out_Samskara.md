title = "(“going-out”) Samskara"

+++
The sixth traditional life-cycle ceremony  
(**samskara**), in which the infant is taken  
for his or her first trip outside the house.  
Although the traditional texts consider  
this a minor rite and the traditional textual procedures are seldom performed,  
a young child’s first outing is often still  
carefully planned. On a symbolic level, it  
represents the child’s first encounter  
with the larger world, and thus the  
child’s expanding sphere of possibilities.  
It also shows the continuing importance  
of **rites of protection**. Even in modern  
India many people believe in the power  
of the evil eye (**nazar**), and young  
children are considered particularly  
susceptible. Thus, a child’s first  
encounter with the chaotic outside  
world must be carefully structured and  
carefully supervised.
