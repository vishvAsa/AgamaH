title = "Narasimha (“Man-Lion”) Avatar"

+++
Fourth **avatar** or incarnation of the god  
**Vishnu**, in which he appears as a figure  
461  
Narasimha (“Man-Lion”) Avatar  
with the head and shoulders of a **lion**,  
but the torso and lower body of a man.  
As with all of Vishnu’s avatars, this  
appearance comes at a moment when  
the cosmos is in crisis, and decisive  
divine action is needed to restore cosmic equilibrium. See **Man-Lion avatar**.
