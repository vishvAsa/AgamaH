title = "Nala"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the King of  
Nishadas and the husband of **Damayanti.**  
The story of Nala and **Damayanti** appears  
as a story within the **Mahabharata**, the  
later of the two great Hindu epics. It is  
recounted to the five **Pandava** brothers,  
the epicâ€™s protagonists, during their twelve  
year exile in the forest, as a way to keep up  
their spirits by telling how others have  
transcended misfortune.  
When Damayanti is old enough to  
marry, her father sends invitations to the  
kings of the earth, announcing her  
**svayamvara**, a rite in which Damayanti  
will choose her husband. The kings of  
the earth come to the svayamvara to  
seek her hand, as do the gods (**devas**)  
456  
Naisthika  
themselves. Yet Damayanti has already  
decided to choose Nala after being  
advised by a swan who praises him. The  
gods try to foil this by taking on the  
physical appearance of Nala, so that  
Damayanti will not be able to tell the  
difference between them. As a last  
resort, Damayanti makes an **act of**  
**truth**, a ritual action whose efficacy is  
based on the power of truth. In her act of  
truth, Damayanti declares that she has  
never loved anyone but Nala. To prove  
that this statement is true, she directs  
the gods to resume their true forms.  
Compelled by the power of truth, the  
gods immediately do as she commands.  
Nala and Damayanti are married, and as  
a reward for her fidelity, the gods give  
Nala various divine gifts. Hearing of the  
marriage, two of the rejected suitors  
curse Nala to lose his kingdom. Because  
of the **curse**, Nala and Damayanti are  
separated and suffer long tribulations,  
which include Nala having his body  
magically changed so that no one is able  
to recognize him. In the end Damayanti  
recognizes him by his divine powers,  
which cannot be hidden, and the lovers  
are happily reunited. See also **truth**,
