(b. 1923) Modern Hindu teacher who  
claims to be an **avatar** of the primordial  
**Goddess**, and the founder of **Vishva**  
**Nirmala Dharam**, an organization dedicated to spreading her message.  
Nirmala Devi’s teaching is based on traditional ideas of **hatha yoga** and the  
**subtle body**. The subtle body is an

Nirmala Devi  
At the Kumbha Mela festival in Haridwar the Niranjani Akhara proceeds first, followed by the Mahanirvani.  
alternate physiological system, existing  
on a different plane than gross matter,  
but corresponding to the material body.  
It is visualized as a set of six psychic centers (**chakras**) running roughly along  
the spine; two divine principles, **Shiva**  
(awareness) and **Shakti** (power), reside  
above and below these centers. In practicing this yoga, the aspirant aims to  
awaken the latent spiritual energy of  
Shakti known as **kundalini**, move it into  
union with the Shiva principle at the  
crown of the head, and transform the  
perishable elements in the gross body to  
become immortal.  
Nirmala Devi claims to be able to  
arouse a devotee’s (**bhakta**) kundalini  
through an infusion of her own spiritual  
power, thus dramatically speeding up  
the path to liberation. Her Indian devotees are mainly middle-class, but she  
also claims to have a substantial following in Europe, North America, and  
Australia. For a skeptical account of an  
encounter with Nirmala Devi, see

*Shamans, Mystics*, *and Doctors*, 1991.
