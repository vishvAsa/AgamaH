title = "Niyati"

(“destiny”) Niyati was the central  
philosophical assumption for the  
**Ajivikas**, an ancient and extinct philosophical school. The Ajivikas were  
fatalists, who believed that niyati inexorably predetermined all things.  
Human beings can do nothing to influence destiny, since they can only do  
what has been preordained. The  
Ajivikas compared the process of reincarnation (**samsara**) to a ball of string,  
which would unroll until it was done,  
and then go no further. The word niyati  
still carries this sense of “fate” or “destiny,” but with one important difference: While the Ajivikas conceived  
niyati as an impersonal and uncontrollable force, in modern times one’s fate  
is believed to result from past **karma**.
