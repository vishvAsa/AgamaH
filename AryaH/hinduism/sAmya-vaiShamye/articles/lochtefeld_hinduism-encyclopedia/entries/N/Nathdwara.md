title = "Nathdwara"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) about twentyfive miles north of the city of Udaipur in  
the south-central region of the state of  
**Rajasthan**. Nathdwara has a temple  
housing an image of the god **Krishna** in  
his form as **Shrinathji**. According to tradition, the image was originally hidden  
on the top of Mount Govardhan, a  
mountain in the **Braj** region where  
Krishna is said to have lived. The location of the image was revealed in a  
**dream** to **Vallabhacharya**, the founder  
of the religious community known as  
the **Pushti Marg**. Vallabhacharya built  
a temple to house it on Mount  
Govardhan, and his descendants have  
remained the image’s hereditary servants since that time. The image was  
moved to the state of Rajasthan in 1669,  
prompted by fears that it would be  
destroyed by the Moghul emperor  
**Aurangzeb**. According to tradition  
Shrinathji revealed his wish to stay in  
Nathdwara by sinking his wagon’s  
wheels deep into the **earth**, so that  
it could not go further. Nathdwara is a  
fairly remote location, making it a safe  
place to keep the image. See also
