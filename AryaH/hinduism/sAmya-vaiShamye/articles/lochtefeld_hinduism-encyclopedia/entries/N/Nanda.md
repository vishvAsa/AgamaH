In Hindu mythology, the god **Krishna’s**  
foster father, who cares for Krishna as  
his own child after Krishna is placed in  
his care. Nanda is described as the headman of the village. Under his care

life. In Krishna’s mythology, Nanda is a  
less important figure than Krishna’s foster mother, **Yashoda**.
