title = "Narsi Mehta"

+++
(16th c.) **Gujarati** poet-saint who was a  
well-known figure in northern Indian  
devotional life. Narsi was a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna**. His poetry  
describes the love affair between  
Krishna and his consort **Radha**.  
According to tradition, Narsi’s poetry  
was rooted in a vision of Krishna’s **ras**  
**lila**, or great circle **dance**, in which Narsi  
was privileged to stand as attendant  
holding a torch to light the **lila**. Narsi is  
one of the devotees profiled in the  
**Bhaktamal**, a text that gives short biographical profiles of more than 200  
devotional (**bhakti**) saints; in the text  
Narsi is portrayed as a paradigm of generosity, an earthly imitation of Krishna  
himself. For further information see

Morality in the Lives of Three Hindu  
Saints,” in John Stratton Hawley (ed.),
