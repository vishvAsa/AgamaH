(b. Margaret Noble, 1867–1911) Irish disciple of the modern Hindu teacher  
**Swami Vivekananda**. Nivedita devoted  
much of her life to the service of the  
**Ramakrishna Mission**, particularly the  
education of Indian **women**. Nivedita  
was born in Ireland and taught in  
London, where she met Vivekananda.  
She accepted him as her spiritual master  
(**guru**) and came to India with him,  
where she founded the Nivedita Girls  
School in Calcutta. Nivedita was part of  
the first generation of Europeans who  
came to India searching for answers to  
life’s ultimate questions.
