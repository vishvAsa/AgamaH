In Hindu mythology, two of the **sons** of  
the god **Dharma**; through their **ascetic**  
practices (**tapas**) these two boys became  
sages. The place where they performed  
their **asceticism** is believed to have been  
in the region of **Badrinath**. The duo are  
still associated with the charter myths  
for that place.
