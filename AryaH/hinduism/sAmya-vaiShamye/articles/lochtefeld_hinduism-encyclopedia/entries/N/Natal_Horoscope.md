In Indian culture, a person’s natal horoscope or janampatrika (“birth-paper”) is  
believed to reveal a great deal about a  
person. One’s previous **karma** is thought  
to determine the moment when one is  
born. Thus, a natal horoscope provides a  
karmic “itinerary,” indicating where one  
has been and what he or she might  
expect in the future. Natal horoscopes  
still play a role in decision-making, particularly in arranging marriages. Natal  
horoscopes are exchanged before fixing  
an engagement in order to determine  
the couple’s compatibility. Sometimes  
this process takes place merely because  
the claim that the horoscopes are  
incompatible can provide an acceptable  
excuse to refuse an inappropriate  
or unacceptable match. Natal horoscopes are believed to reveal important  
things about a person’s future. A person  
whose horoscope indicates an early  
death—or the early death of a spouse—  
may find it difficult to marry unless he  
or she performs certain rituals to  
remove these problems.
