title = "Nageshvar"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) about fifteen miles northeast of the holy city of  
**Dwaraka**, in the eastern state of  
**Gujarat**. The temple is named after its  
presiding **deity**, the god **Shiva** in his  
manifestation as the “Lord of Serpents.”  
Shiva is present at Nageshvar in the  
form of a **linga**, a pillar-shaped image.  
The Nageshvar linga is one of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a network of sites at which  
Shiva is uniquely present. Nageshvar’s  
charter myth is based on the story of the  
demon Daruk and his wife Daruka.  
Daruka is a fervent devotee (**bhakta**) of  
Shiva’s wife **Parvati**; through Parvati’s  
**grace** Daruka gains protection for all the  
other **demons**. The demons use this  
power to oppress the righteous. As the  
demons are about to kill one of Shiva’s  
devotees, Shiva appears and slays them.  
Parvati has come along with Shiva to  
protect Daruka, her devotee. Daruka  
persuades Shiva and Parvati to remain  
in Nageshvar as a sign of their **grace**.  
Since the city of Dwaraka is also  
connected with the god **Krishna**, some  
scholars believe the Nageshvar linga  
may have been promoted to maintain a  
Shaivite presence in an important  
**Vaishnava** area.
