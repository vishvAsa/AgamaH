title = "Nimbarka"

+++
(12th c.?) **Ascetic**, philosopher, devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and attributed as the founder of the **Sanaka**  
**Sampraday**, one of the four **Vaishnava**  
ascetic orders. According to tradition,  
Nimbarka was a Telegu (southern  
Indian) **brahmin** who was born in the  
city of **Paithan** in central India, but lived  
much of his life in the northern Indian  
**Braj** region, where the god **Krishna** is  
supposed to have lived. Nimbarkaâ€™s  
philosophical position is described as  
dualism-nondualism (dvaitadvaita), a  
concept in which God and human  
beings are both identical and different.  
While earlier Vaishnavas worshiped  
**Vishnu** and **Lakshmi** as the divine  
couple, Nimbarka used the same  
concept, but changed the focus to  
Krishna and **Radha**.
