title = "Nilakanth"

+++
(“blue-throated”) Epithet of the god  
**Shiva**; also the name of a manifestation  
of Shiva who is enshrined at the  
Nilakanth Mahadev temple outside the  
city of **Rishikesh** in the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. Shiva is present at Nilakanth in  
the form of a **linga**, the pillar-shaped  
object that is his symbolic form. The  
mythic charter for this epithet (and for  
the establishment of the temple as well)  
is drawn from the tale of Churning the  
Ocean of Milk. The gods and **demons**  
churn the ocean to produce **amrta**, the  
nectar of immortality thought to be the  
finest essence of the ocean. Yet their  
action produces not only the amrta, but  
also its antithesis, the **halahala** poison.  
This is an event of great peril; the poison  
is so powerful that if left unchecked, it  
can destroy the earth. When this poison  
appears, the gods and demons are  
unable to figure out a way to contain it.  
Shiva takes care of the poison by holding  
it in his throat, but the force of the poison is so great that it turns his throat  
blue. See also **Tortoise avatar** and  
**ocean, churning of the**.
