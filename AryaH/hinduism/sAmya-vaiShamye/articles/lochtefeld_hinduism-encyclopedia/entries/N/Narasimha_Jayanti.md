title = "Narasimha Jayanti"

+++
Religious observance falling on the fourteenth day of the bright, waxing half  
of the **lunar month** of **Baisakh**  
(April–May). This day is celebrated as  
the birthday of **Vishnu’s** fourth **avatar**,  
Narasimha, although his birthday is  
different from those of Vishnu’s human  
avatars. Narasimha is not human, but a  
creature with the head and shoulders of  
a **lion**, and the torso and lower body of  
a man. He is not born in the usual  
sense, but bursts forth fully formed  
from a pillar, to destroy the **demon**  
**Hiranyakashipu** and to protect his  
devotee (**bhakta**) **Prahlada**. See also  
**Man-Lion avatar**.
