Presiding **deity** of the Naina Devi temple  
in the **Shiwalik Hills** in the state of  
**Himachal Pradesh**, and one of the nine  
**Shiwalik goddesses**. Naina Devi’s temple is located on a mountaintop close to  
the border of **Punjab**. It is nine miles  
from Anandpur Sahib, a famous Sikh  
place of pilgrimage, and about one mile  
from Nangal village. The greatest pilgrimage traffic occurs during festivals  
held on the eighth day in each half of the  
**lunar month** of **Shravan**, and also during the first nine days of the month of  
**Ashvin**, when the **Navaratri** festival  
takes place.  
According to the temple’s charter  
myth, Naina Devi is one of the **Shakti**  
**Pithas**, a network of sites sacred to the  
**Goddess** which spreads throughout the  
subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha marks  
the site where a body part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to earth,  
taking form there as a different goddess;  
**Naina Devi** was Sati’s eyes (naina). As  
with many of the other Shiwalik goddesses, the images in Naina Devi’s temple are self-manifested (**svayambhu**  
images) outcrops of stone. In a different  
version of the myth, the images were  
discovered by a herdsman named  
Naina, who heeded the command of  
the Goddess to build a temple for her.
