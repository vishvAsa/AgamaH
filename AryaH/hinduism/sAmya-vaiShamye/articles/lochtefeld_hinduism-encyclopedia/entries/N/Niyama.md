+++
(“observance”) In the **ashtanga yoga**  
taught by **Patanjali**, the second of the  
eight constituent elements of yoga practice. While the first element lists five  
injurious actions and dispositions to  
avoid, Niyama gives five positive  
instructions, shifting the focus from  
abstinence to active cultivation. The five  
observances are: **purity**, contentment,  
**asceticism**, study, and making the lord  
the motive of all action.
