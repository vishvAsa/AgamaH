title = "Naimittika Karma"

+++
(“occasional [ritual] action”) One of  
three general types of ritual action, the  
others being **nitya karma** and **kamya**  
**karma**. Naimittika karma rites follow a  
particular cause (naimittika); when particular circumstances arise, one is  
required to perform the ritual. For  
example, when a child is born, certain  
rites must be performed. However, the  
ritual is not required unless a birth has  
taken place.
