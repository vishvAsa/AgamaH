title = "Nanddas"

+++
(late 16th c.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions of  
these eight poets were used for liturgical  
purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community whose members are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. In the Pushti  
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are  
also named as members of the community, and as associates of either the community’s founder, **Vallabhacharya**, or  
his successor, **Vitthalnath**. Very little is  
known about his life, but he is mentioned in the **Bhaktamal**, a collection of  
lives of the saints written by **Nabhadas**  
in the seventeenth century. Like all the  
poetry associated with the Pushti Marg,  
Nanddas’s poetry focused on devotion  
to Krishna. His two most important  
works, written in elegant poetry, are  
extended poems on the **ras lila** and  
**Uddhava’s** message. Both of these  
themes date back to the **Bhagavata**  
**Purana** (10th c.?), the most important  
text for Krishna devotionalism. These  
have been translated by R. S. McGregor,  
*The Round Dance of Krishna and*  
*Uddhav’s Message*, 1973.
