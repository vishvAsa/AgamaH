title = "New Moon"

+++
(amavasya) In northern India, the new  
**moon** usually marks the midpoint of the  
**lunar month**, whereas in southern India  
it often identifies the end. Unlike the **full**  
**moon**, whose associations with fullness  
and completion make it always **auspicious**, the new moon’s associations with  
darkness and emptiness make it a more  
ambiguous time. One of the most  
important festivals in the Hindu religious **year**, **Diwali**, falls on the new  
moon in **Kartik** (October–November).  
The new moon can also be highly auspicious on certain other occasions, such  
as a **Somavati Amavasya**, a new moon  
falling on a **Monday**. In general, however,  
the new moon is less clearly auspicious  
than the full moon. Not only are there  
fewer celebrations during the new  
moon, but there is also a proportionately  
greater number of holidays falling in the  
light, waxing half of the lunar month.  
The new moon and the dark, waning  
half are not in themselves **inauspicious**,  
they are simply deemed less auspicious  
than the light half and the full moon.
