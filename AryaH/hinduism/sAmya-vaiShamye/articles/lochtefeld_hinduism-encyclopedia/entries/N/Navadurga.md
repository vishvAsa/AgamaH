(“Nine Durgas”) Collective name for  
nine differing forms of **Durga**, a powerful and dangerous form of the **Goddess**.  
One of the “nine Durgas” is worshiped  
each of the nine nights during the **festival** of **Navaratri**, which usually falls in  
October or November. Each goddess has  
her own identity, yet at the same time  
is a form of Durga. This fluidity is  
467  
Navadurga  
characteristic of the Goddess; all female  
divinities are ultimately seen as  
manifestations of some single great  
Goddess. The nine Durgas, in the  
order in which they are worshiped,  
are **Mahalakshmi**, **Mahasaraswati**,  
**Yogmaya**, **Raktadantika**, **Shakumbhari**  
**Devi**, Durga, **Bhramari**, and **Chandika**.
