title = "Nirukta"

+++
(“explanation”) One of the six **Vedangas**.  
These were the auxiliary branches of  
knowledge associated with the use of  
the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious  
texts. Nirukta is concerned with the etymological explanations of archaic  
words. This was apparently a serious  
problem, since almost one-quarter of  
the words in the Veda occur only once,  
and with the passage of time their precise meanings became either unclear or  
unknown. The most famous nirukta  
text—known simply as the *Nirukta*—  
was written by **Yaska** the grammarian,  
in about the fifth century B.C.E. His work  
was immeasurably helpful to later readers, but it is clear that even in Yaska’s  
time the meanings for many of these  
words had become uncertain and  
unclear. Aside from nirukta, the other  
Vedangas are **vyakarana** (**Sanskrit**  
grammar), **chandas** (Sanskrit prosody),  
**kalpa** (ritual instructions), **shiksha** (correct pronunciation), and **jyotisha** (**auspicious** times for sacrifices).
