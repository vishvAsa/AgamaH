(“**sacrifice** to human beings”) One of the  
Five Great Sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**)  
that is prescribed in the **dharma literature**, which describes religious duty.  
These Five Great Sacrifices are daily religious observances prescribed for a  
**twice-born** householder. This is a person who has been born into one of the  
three twice-born groups in Indian society—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—  
and who has received the adolescent  
religious **initiation** known as the “second birth.” Each of the five sacrifices  
(**yajna**) is directed toward a different  
class of beings—from the Ultimate  
Reality of **Brahman** down to **animals**—  
and is satisfied by different actions. The  
nryajana is directed toward fellow  
human beings, and is satisfied by showing hospitality to one’s guests. Although  
Hindu religious life has undergone significant changes and some of the other  
rites have fallen into oblivion, this rite is  
still widely practiced; the ethos of hospitality is still very strong in Hindu society.
