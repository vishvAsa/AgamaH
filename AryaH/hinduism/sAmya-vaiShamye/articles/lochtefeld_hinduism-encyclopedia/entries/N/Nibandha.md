title = "Nibandha"

+++
(“collection”) Genre of thematic commentarial literature that became prominent in medieval northern India. The  
nibandhas were compendia of Hindu  
lore, in which the compilers culled  
471  
Nibandha  
excerpts on a particular theme from the  
**Vedas**, **dharma literature**, **puranas**, and  
other authoritative religious texts, and  
then compiled them into a single organized text. Excerpts from these same  
authoritative texts on a different theme  
would be compiled into a different volume, and so on. The compilers would  
often have to reconcile conflicting texts,  
or judge which passage was preferable  
to another. Such judgments were generally done using rules for textual interpretation developed by the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** philosophical school, one of  
the **six schools** of traditional Hindu **philosophy**. The Purva Mimamsa school  
had originally developed these rules for  
interpreting the Vedas, the oldest and  
most authoritative Hindu religious texts.  
In many cases the nibandhas had  
between fifteen and twenty volumes,  
attempting to provide an exhaustive  
investigation of Hindu religious life.  
Among the most influential nibandhas  
are the **Kalpataru**, compiled by  
**Lakshmidhara** in twelfth century, and  
the **Viramitrodaya**, compiled by **Mitra**  
**Mishra** early in the seventeenth century.
