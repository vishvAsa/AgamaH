title = "Narmada River"

+++
Central Indian river that has its source at  
the sacred site (**tirtha**) of **Amarkantak**  
in the state of **Madhya Pradesh**, and  
flows almost directly west through the  
state of **Gujarat**, then to the Arabian Sea.  
The Narmada is one of the few central  
Indian rivers flowing from east to west;  
rivers further south are channeled east  
by the upthrust of the highlands known  
as the Western Ghats. It is traditionally  
considered one of the seven sacred  
rivers of India, along with the **Ganges**,  
**Yamuna**, **Godavari**, **Saraswati**, **Indus**,  
and **Cauvery**. An important site on the  
Narmada is **Omkareshvar**, one of the  
twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network of sites  
sacred to the god **Shiva**. During the  
1990s the Narmada has become a rallying point for environmentalists who  
have opposed construction of several  
massive dams, on the grounds that  
these dams have displaced too many  
people and destroyed too much prime  
farmland. Although work on these dams  
has continued, the pace has slowed. In  
1997 a minor earthquake in the  
Narmada basin prompted the call for  
further consideration of this projectâ€™s  
environmental dangers.
