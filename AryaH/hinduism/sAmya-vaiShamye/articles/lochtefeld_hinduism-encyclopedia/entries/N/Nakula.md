title = "Nakula"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Nakula is the  
fourth of the five **Pandava** brothers,  
the epic’s antagonists. Nakula’s mother,  
**Madri**, is the younger wife of King **Pandu**.  
None of the Pandava brothers are actually  
Pandu’s sons, since he has been cursed to  
die the moment he holds his wife in  
amorous embrace. Instead, they are magically created through the effect of a  
**mantra** given to Madri’s co-wife, **Kunti**, by  
the sage **Durvasas**. The mantra gives the  
woman who recites it the power to call  
down any of the gods to conceive a son  
who will be as powerful as the god himself.  
With Pandu’s blessing Kunti teaches the  
mantra to Madri. She meditates on the  
**Ashvins**, the divine twins who are the  
physicians of the gods. Thus, she bears  
twins. As the sons of the physicians of the  
gods, both Nakula and **Sahadeva** are  
skilled healers of **animals** and human  
beings. Although Nakula and Sahadeva  
are among the five Pandava brothers, they  
are less important to the *Mahabharata*  
than their three elder siblings.
