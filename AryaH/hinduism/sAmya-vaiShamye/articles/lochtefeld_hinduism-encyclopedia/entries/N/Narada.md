title = "Narada"

+++
A famous sage in Hindu mythology,  
equally renowned for his qualities as a  
musician and as a gossip. Narada plays a  
stringed instrument known as the **vina**,  
serving as the bard to the gods. His  
ambition as a musician apparently  
exceeds his actual skill, since several of  
his mythic stories describe him being  
humbled. In his capacity as wandering  
musician, he also conveys news and  
gossip. In many cases Naradaâ€™s newsbearing is the vehicle advancing the plot  
in a story. According to one famous  
story, he requests that **Vishnu** give a  
demonstration of his **magic** (**maya**).  
Vishnu sends him to a nearby farmhouse for some water, where Narada  
meets an enchantingly beautiful  
woman. Forgetting all about his errand,  
the two fall in love, are married, and have  
several children. After several years of  
wedded bliss, severe floods wash away  
his home and drown his family. As he  
mourns his loss, he finds himself back  
on the side of road with Vishnu, who is  
still asking him to go to the farmhouse to  
get some water.
