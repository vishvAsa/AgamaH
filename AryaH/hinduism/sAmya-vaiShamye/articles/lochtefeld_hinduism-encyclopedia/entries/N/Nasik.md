title = "Nasik"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) near the  
headwaters of the **Godavari** River in the  
state of **Maharashtra**, about 100 miles  
northeast of Bombay. Nasik is one of the  
four sites for the **Kumbha Mela**, a religious bathing (**snana**) festival. Nasik  
hosts this festival every twelve years.  
Nasik is an important bathing place and  
is a center of pilgrimage, piety, and  
learning. According to tradition the godking **Rama**, his wife, **Sita**, and his brother,  
**Lakshmana** lived during much of their  
twelve years in exile in the nearby village  
of **Panchavati**. Rama, Sita, and  
Lakshmana are central characters in the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics. Although claims of them  
living near Nasik are impossible to prove  
or disprove, the legend adds one more  
layer of sanctity to the site.
