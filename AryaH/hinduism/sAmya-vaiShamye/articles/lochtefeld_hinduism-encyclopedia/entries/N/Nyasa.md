title = "Nyasa"

+++
(“laying down”) A characteristic ritual  
in **tantra**, a secret religious practice.  
In the practice of nyasa, the person  
performing the ritual identifies certain sounds, often in the form of seed  
syllables (**bijaksharas**), with parts of  
the human body, **deities**, and material  
objects. This is done to create a series  
of identifications between the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of the body, such that actions in  
the microcosmic ritual sphere will  
cause results in its macrocosmic  
counterpart.
