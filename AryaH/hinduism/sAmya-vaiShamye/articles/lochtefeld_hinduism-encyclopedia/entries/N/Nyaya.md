(“method”) One of the **six schools** of  
traditional Hindu **philosophy**, concerned with the examination and validation of the objects of knowledge. It  
was the Nyayas who first developed and  
codified the notion of the **pramanas**,  
the means by which human beings may  
gain true and accurate knowledge. The  
Nyayas recognized four such pramanas:  
perception (**pratyaksha**), inference  
(**anumana**), analogy (**upamana**), and  
authoritative testimony (**shabda**).  
These ideas are accepted by virtually all  
Indian philosophical schools, and are  
the Nyayas’ major contribution to  
Indian philosophy.  
As did all schools of Indian philosophy, the Nyayas undertook the examination of knowledge not for mere  
speculation, but to find a way to release  
the soul from the bondage of reincarnation (**samsara**). The **Nyaya Sutras**,  
attributed to **Gautama**, are the  
traditional basis for the school. The  
**sutras** begin by asserting that the  
means of knowledge and its elements  
can bring a person supreme happiness.  
The text’s second sutra describes a fivepart **causal chain**: pain, **birth**, activity,  
defect, and wrong notion. Each of these  
elements is caused by the one succeeding it, and is eliminated with the  
destruction of its cause. The primary  
cause for all of this is “wrong notion,”  
hence the Nyaya were concerned with  
the investigation of the pramanas.  
The Nyayas draw their metaphysics  
from the **Vaisheshika** school, with  
whom they become assimilated in the  
early centuries of the common era.  
Their philosophical perspective is  
sometimes described as the “ordinary  
person’s conception.” The Nyayas and  
Vaisheshika are philosophical realists—  
that is, they believe the world is made  
up of many different things that exist as  
perceived, except in cases of perceptual  
error. All things are composed of nine  
fundamental substances—the five **elements**, **space**, time, mind, and selves—  
and that whatever exists is both  
knowable and nameable. The Nyayas  
subscribe to the **causal model** known as  
**asatkaryavada**, which posits that when  
a thing is created, it is a new entity,  
completely different from its constituent parts. This causal model tends  
to multiply the number of things in the  
universe, since each act of creation  
brings a new thing into being. It also  
admits that human efforts and actions  
are one of the causes influencing these  
affects, making it theoretically possible  
to act in a way that brings final liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
One of the unique features of the  
Nyaya school is their belief in **inherence** (**samavaya**), a weak relational  
force that functions like a glue connecting various things: wholes and their  
parts, substances and their attributes,  
motions and the things that move, and  
general properties and their particular  
instances. For the Nyayas, the Self  
(**atman**) is the locus for all experience.  
Inherence connects all experiences—

Nyasa  
pleasure, pain, happiness, sorrow,  
and so forth—to the Self. The philosophical difficulties with inherence—  
particularly the notion that it is one  
single principle and not a collection of  
things—caused the Nyaya school great  
difficulty. These assumptions were ultimately responsible for the rise of  
**Navyanyaya** school, which attempted  
to explain these relationships in a  
more sophisticated way. For further
