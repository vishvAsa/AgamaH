+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the state  
of **Uttar Pradesh**, about fifty miles  
northwest of the city of Lucknow. In the  
later sectarian literature known as the  
**puranas**, Naimisha is described as a forest. Today the cityâ€™s major attraction is a  
spring-fed bathing (**snana**) pool named  
Chakra Tirtha. According to tradition,  
this bathing pool contains **water** from  
all the holy places of India, and thus is  
the best place for pious Hindus to take a  
holy bath.
