In classical Indian **dance**, the word *nrtya*  
refers to the genre of “pure” dance, in  
which the dance conveys nothing more  
than the dancer’s skill. Nrtya is one of  
the two most basic dance genres. The  
other genre, **natya**, is an acting dance, in  
which the dancer’s expressions, movements, and gestures convey a story to  
the audience.
