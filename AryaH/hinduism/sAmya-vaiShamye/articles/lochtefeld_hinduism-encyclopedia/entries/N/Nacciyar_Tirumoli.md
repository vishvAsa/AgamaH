title = "Nacciyar Tirumoli"

+++
One of two collections of poetry composed by the poet-saint **Andal** (9th c.),  
the other being the **Tirruppavai**. Andal  
was the only woman among the **Alvars**,  
a group of twelve poet-saints who lived  
in southern India between the seventh  
and tenth centuries. All the Alvars were  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**.  
Their emphasis on passionate devotion  
(**bhakti**) to a personal god, conveyed  
through hymns sung in the **Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized  
Hindu religious life. Andal’s chosen  
**deity** was **Ranganatha**, the form of  
Vishnu presiding at the temple of  
**Shrirangam**. Yet both collections of her  
poetry are dedicated to **Krishna**, a different form of Vishnu. This seeming  
divergence may reflect her conviction  
that all manifestations of Vishnu are  
ultimately the same or indicate the difference between personal devotion and  
literary expression.  
The thirty poems in the *Nacciyar*  
*Tirumoli* are told by a group of unmarried girls, who have taken a vow to bathe  
in the river at dawn during the coldest  
month of the year. This vow has a long  
history in southern India, where young  
girls would take the oath to gain a good  
husband and a happy married life. In the  
poem, the girls have taken the vow to  
gain Krishna as their husband. The  
poems in the cycle describe various features of the natural world at dawn, the  
girls’ hopes in performing the vow, and  
their return to Krishna’s house to awaken  
him and beg for his **grace**. The final  
poem in the series describes the benefits  
gained by one who chants the text.
