One of the three classes of beings in the  
**Dvaita Vedanta** philosophical school,  
founded by the philosopher **Madhva**  
477  
Nityasamsarin  
(1197–1276). Madhva’s fundamental  
belief was that God was utterly transcendent, above and beyond the world  
and human beings. The strength of this  
conviction led him to stress the importance of **grace** as the sole means of salvation, since human beings were  
unable to save themselves. Given this  
dire view of human capacities, Madhva  
divided the beings of the world into  
three classes: The **muktiyogas** were  
destined for final liberation, the  
nityasamsarins were destined for eternal rebirth, and the **tamoyogas** were  
predestined for eternal damnation.
