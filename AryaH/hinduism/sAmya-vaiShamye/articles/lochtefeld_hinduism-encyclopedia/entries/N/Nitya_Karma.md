title = "Nitya Karma"

(“perpetual [ritual] action”) One of the  
three broad types of ritual action, the  
others being **naimittika karma** and  
**kamya karma**. Nitya karma is ritual  
action that is prescribed at regular fixed  
intervals, often on a daily basis; one  
gains no religious merit from performing them, but omitting them is considered a religious demerit. One example of  
a nitya karma is the **Gayatri Mantra**,  
which must be recited at morning and  
evening **worship** (**sandhya**) by every  
“**twice-born**” man who has received the  
adolescent religious **initiation** known as  
the “second birth.” Another nitya karma  
is the Five Great Sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**), which are daily religious  
duties for a “twice-born” householder;  
they are rarely performed today.
