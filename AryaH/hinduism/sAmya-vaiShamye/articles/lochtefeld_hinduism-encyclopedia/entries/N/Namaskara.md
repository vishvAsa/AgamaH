title = "Namaskara"

+++
(“reverential salutation”) Both a  
phrase and a **gesture** used to greet  
another person respectfully. The gesture is done by joining both palms,  
pointing the fingers up, with the base  
of the thumbs touching the chest.  
Namaskara is the fourteenth of sixteen  
traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”)  
given to a **deity** as part of **worship**,  
treating the deity as an honored guest.  
In this action, the deity is given a gesture of respect, which can take a variety of forms: joining the palms with  
the fingers pointing upward (**anjali**  
**hasta**), kneeling and touching one’s  
head to the floor, or a full prostration  
(**dandavat pranam**). The underlying  
motive for all the upacharas is to show  
one’s respect and love for the deity by  
ministering to the deity’s needs.
