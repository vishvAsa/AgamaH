title = "Nepal"

+++
A small Himalayan nation on the northern border of India that is deemed the  
world’s only Hindu kingdom. One basis  
for this claim is that almost 90 percent of  
Nepal’s inhabitants identify themselves  
as Hindu; the other is that since 1769  
Nepal’s ruling house has been a Hindu  
dynasty, the Shah dynasty. The present  
monarch, Birendra Bir Bikram Shah (b.  
1945), was an uncontested absolute  
monarch until April 1990, when popular  
discontent led to a movement seeking  
the restoration of democracy in Nepal.  
The king was forced to accede to democratic reforms, and since May 1991 has  
governed as a constitutional monarch,  
with the Nepali Parliament wielding the  
real power.  
Although Nepal is a small country, it  
has great geographical diversity. Its three  
major geographical regions are the submontane lowlands, the Himalayan  
foothills, and the high mountains. The  
country’s uneven topography further  
subdivides each of these regions. This  
rugged geography has a marked effect  
on the country’s economy, rendering  
agriculture impossible at anything more  
than a subsistence level. However, it  
provides the attraction for tourism,  
which is Nepal’s greatest source of foreign exchange.  
Such great geographical diversity  
promotes similar human diversity. The  
people of Nepal are an amalgam of  
many different groups, including people  
whose historical roots lie in India and  
indigenous hill tribes associated with  
particular parts of the country. Most  
Nepalese live in the fertile valleys of the  
foothills. These are the most habitable  
regions, as the climate in the mountains  
is far too harsh for permanent habitation, while the lowland regions are  
rife with disease, particularly malaria.  
In general, Nepali culture shows  
many similarities with the adjoining  
areas of India, and thus from a cultural  
perspective is firmly fixed in the Indian  
cultural orbit. Nepal is also the home to  
several important Hindu pilgrimage  
places (**tirtha**), notably **Pashupatinath**  
in the Kathmandu Valley, and  
**Muktinath**, at the headwaters of the Kali  
Gandaki River.
