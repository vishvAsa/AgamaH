title = "Nag Panchami"

+++
Festival falling on the fifth day (panchami) of the bright, waxing half of the  
**lunar month** of **Shravan** (July–August).  
This day is devoted to the **worship** of  
serpents, whether as **Nagas**—the minor  
**deities** who take the form of snakes—or  
actual cobras and other snakes. On this  
day the images of the Naga deities are  
bathed and given **offerings**. Offerings  
are also made to real serpents. On this  
day people refrain from digging in the  
earth, since snakes live there.  
This rite occurs on the fifth day  
because in astrology (**jyotisha**), the  
guardian deity for this day is **Shesha**, the  
god **Vishnu’s** serpent couch. This festival falls at the beginning of the rainy  
**season**, when the rising waters caused  
by the **monsoon** rains often drive snakes  
out of their dens, and at times into peoples’ homes and gardens. The rainy season is also the time for growing crops;  
snakes pose a real danger for people  
working in the fields. According to one  
estimate, 10,000 Indians die from  
snakebites every year. According to popular belief, observing this rite will protect one from snakebites for the entire  
year. This observance is a protective ritual, marking the advent of a dangerous  
time for many villagers.
