title = "Namdev"

+++
(1270â€“1350?) Poet-saint who is one of  
the great figures in the **Varkari Panth**, a  
religious community centered around  
the **worship** of the Hindu god **Vithoba**,  
at his temple in **Pandharpur** in the  
modern state of **Maharashtra**.  
According to tradition, Namdev was a  
cotton-printer, considered a low-status  
occupation, but the strength of  
his devotion rendered his worldly  
status irrelevant. He is said to have been  
an associate of **Jnaneshvar** and  
**Chokamela**, two other Varkari poetsaints. His songs have been preserved in  
several different collections, including  
the **Adigranth** (compiled by the Sikh  
community) and the **Panchvani** (a collection of songs by five poets compiled  
by the **Dadupanth**). For traditional  
information about his life, see G. A.  
Deleury, *The Cult of Vithoba*, 1960; and  
Justin E. Abbott and Narhar R. Godbole  
(trans.), *Stories of Indian Saints*, 1982.  
For a more critical look at his Hindu  
songs and the difficulties using them as  
biographical sources, see Winand  
Callewaert and Mukund Lath, *The Hindi*  
*Padavali of Namdev*, 1989.
