+++
(“nine nights”) Festival dedicated to the  
**Goddess** celebrated twice during the  
**year**. The spring Navaratri occurs during  
the bright, waxing half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Chaitra** (March–April), and  
the fall Navaratri falls during the bright  
half of the lunar month of **Ashvin**  
(September–October). Each Navaratri  
celebration lasts for the first nine nights  
468  
Navadvip  
Worshipers celebrating the Navaratri festival carry an image of the Goddess in the form of Durga.  
of these lunar months and concludes  
with a festival dedicated to the god  
**Rama**: **Ram Navami** in Chaitra and  
**Dussehra** in Ashvin. Of the two, the fall  
Navaratri is far more important. The fall  
Navaratri is celebrated with fervor in the  
Bengal region, where the Goddess is the  
dominant regional **deity**. The Bengali  
Navaratri is characterized by large processions featuring elaborately decorated  
clay images of the Goddess. These  
images are commissioned by individuals, businesses, trade unions, and neighborhood associations. Having the best  
image is a sign of great status. During  
the weeks around Navaratri, Bengali  
children get a holiday from school, state  
workers get paid vacation from their  
jobs, and the electricity supply  
in Calcutta runs without interruptions—  
a phenomenon dubbed the Navaratri  
“miracle,” since during the rest of  
the year shortages and blackouts  
are common.  
These Navaratri festivals are performed to gain the favor of the Mother  
Goddess, particularly in her powerful  
forms such as **Durga**. During these nine  
nights devotees (**bhakta**) perform a variety of different rites. Some fast  
(**upavasa**) and **worship** in their homes,  
often consecrating temporary images of  
the Goddess for use during this festival.  
Devotees may also worship young girls  
as manifestations of the Goddess, or  
sponsor readings of the **Devimahatmya**,  
the earliest and most important text for  
the mythology of the Goddess. They may  
also worship the Goddess in her form as  
**Navadurga**, paying homage to a different form on each of the nine nights.  
Another common practice is to harvest shoots of barley, which are sometimes worn on the final day of the  
festival. This practice hints at the festival’s purpose since, among other things,  
the Goddess represents the female  
power of fertility and procreation. In  
northern India, the spring festival  
comes before the crops are planted.  
Wearing sprouting grain is an attempt to  
please the Goddess so the crop may  
flourish. The fall Navaratri comes after  
the harvest, when this promise of  
fruition has been fulfilled, and is seen as  
a time of thanksgiving for blessings  
received. The Goddess also represents  
the triumph of good over evil; the readings of the *Devimahatmya* on these  
occasions remind the listeners of the  
Goddess’ wondrous deeds and assure  
them of her continued protection.
