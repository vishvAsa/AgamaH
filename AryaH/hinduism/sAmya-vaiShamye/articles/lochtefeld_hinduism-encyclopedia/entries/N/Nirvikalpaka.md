title = "Nirvikalpaka"

+++
In certain schools of Indian  
**philosophy**—among them certain  
Buddhists, the **Nyayas**, and the  
**Prabhakara** school of **Mimamsa**—  
nirvikalpaka is the name for a sort of  
simple non-conceptual awareness, produced solely by the operation of the  
senses. According to these schools, if the  
senses producing this awareness have  
no defect, such an awareness is believed  
to be true. However, it can be confused  
or misinterpreted through the action of  
the mind. This belief had important  
ramifications for **theories of error**,  
which seek to explain how erroneous  
judgments are possible. The schools that  
believed in this theory attributed error  
to the action of the mind.
