title = "Nandi"

+++
(“joy,” “delight”) Epithet of the animal  
vehicle of the god **Shiva**, which takes the  
form of a **bull**. Like all of the animal  
vehicles, it symbolizes the **deity**. Nandi  
is not only Shiva’s vehicle, but his devotee (**bhakta**). Statues of Nandi are often  
sculpted outside Shiva temples (usually  
facing the image) as a way of marking  
the site as sacred to Shiva. He appears in  
many places in Shiva’s mythology, but  
usually as a devoted underling advancing Shiva’s purposes, rather than an  
independent agent with a purpose and  
ends of his own.
