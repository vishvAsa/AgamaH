(“The Four Thousand Divine  
Compositions”) Title for the collected  
hymns of the **Alvars**, compiled in the  
tenth century by **Nathamuni**. The Alvars  
were a group of twelve poet-saints who  
lived in southern India between the seventh and tenth centuries. All the Alvars  
were devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu** and emphasized passionate  
devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god,  
conveyed through hymns sung in the  
**Tamil language**. Their collected hymns  
were popularly known as the “Tamil  
Veda.” They carry Vedic authority for  
many southern Indian Vaishnavas, particularly the **Shrivaishnava** school,  
which applied more developed philosophical articulation to these devotional  
ideas. See also **Veda**.
