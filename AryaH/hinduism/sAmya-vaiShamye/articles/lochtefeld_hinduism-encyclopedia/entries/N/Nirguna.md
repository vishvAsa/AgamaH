(“without qualities”) Epithet of the  
divine reality in its ultimate aspect.  
According to many Hindu traditions,  
God is ultimately without qualities or  
attributes, transcending all particularity  
and superior to any qualified form. This  
conception is first phrased in the  
**Upanishads**, the speculative religious  
texts that are the most recent part of the  
**Vedas**, and in the philosophical traditions based on the Upanishads such as  
**Advaita Vedanta**. This belief is opposed  
by certain Hindu theistic traditions,  
such as the **Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious  
community, in which a particular  
**deity**—in this case, **Krishna**—is conceived as the Ultimate Reality.
