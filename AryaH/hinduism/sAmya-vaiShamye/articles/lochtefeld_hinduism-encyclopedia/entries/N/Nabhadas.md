title = "Nabhadas"

+++
(c. 1600) Author of the **Bhaktamal**  
(“Garland of Devotees”). In this hagiographic text, he gives short (six line)  
accounts of the lives of more than two  
hundred contemporary **bhakti** (devotional) figures, some from personal  
experience. Although Nabhadas identifies himself as a **Ramanandi**—a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Rama**—his work  
includes devotees of all sectarian persuasions. The text is notably free of marvelous and miraculous events, and  
Nabhadas emphasizes the devotee’s  
personal qualities, to serve as a model of  
devotion for others. In many cases the  
*Bhaktamal* gives the earliest reliable  
account for these figures, making it an  
important source for northern Indian  
literary and religious history. Despite its  
importance the text cannot be definitively dated, although internal evidence  
suggests that it was completed early in  
the seventeenth century.
