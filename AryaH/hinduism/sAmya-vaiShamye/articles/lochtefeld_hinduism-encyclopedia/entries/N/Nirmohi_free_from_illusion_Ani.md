title = "Nirmohi (“free from illusion”) Ani"

+++
Among the **Bairagi Nagas**, renunciant  
**ascetics** who are devotees of **Vishnu**, the  
Nirmohis are one of the three Naga **anis**  
(“armies”). The others are the **Digambaras**  
and **Nirvanis**. In earlier times these anis  
were actual fighting units who made  
their living as traders and mercenary  
soldiers, but in modern times they are  
mainly important for determining the  
order in the bathing processions at the  
**Kumbha Mela**. Of the three Naga anis,  
the Digambaras are by far the most  
important and take precedence at the  
Kumbha Mela.
