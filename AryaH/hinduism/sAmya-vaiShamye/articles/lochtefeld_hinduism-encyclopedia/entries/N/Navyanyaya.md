(“new **Nyaya**”) A later branch of the  
Nyaya philosophical school. The Nyaya  
school was one of the **six schools** in traditional Hindu **philosophy**, which flourished in the early centuries of the first  
millennium, but then lost its influence.  
The Navyanyaya school developed in  
late medieval times (15th–17th c.), in an  
attempt to reinvigorate the school and  
to resolve some of the problems with the  
earlier Nyaya notion of **inherence**  
(**samavaya**). The earlier Nyayas perceived inherence as a weak relational  
force that connected objects and their  
qualities—for example, connecting the  
color red with a particular ball and thus  
making the ball red. It also connected  
material objects—the force that held a  
clay pot together once the two halves  
had been pressed against each other.  
Finally, inherence connected selves and  
their qualities—one became happy  
when inherence connected happiness  
to one’s self, and unhappy when unhappiness was connected.  
This notion of inherence explained  
many things in the perceivable world.  
However, objections were raised against  
the Nyayas’ insistence that inherence  
was a single, universal property at work  
in different places. According to this  
criticism, a universal and eternal inherence could link an object with *any*  
property, including ones that contradict—the color brown with the moon or  
the appearance of a cow with a dog.  
Other attacks questioned whether  
inherence continued to exist after one of  
the things it had been connecting was  
destroyed. If it did not, opponents  
claimed, then inherence was clearly

nothing to begin with, whereas if it did,  
then the remaining connecting power  
would exist unconnected to anything,  
which was clearly absurd. Finally, some  
attacked the need for inherence at all—  
which was cited as an example of “needless complexity” (**gaurava**).  
The Navyanyaya school attempted to  
sidestep these problems by positing a  
new class of relationship, that of “selflinking connectors.” These connectors  
were seen as an integral part of all  
things, by their very nature, and since  
they were self-linking, this eliminated  
the need for a separate inherence to  
connect things together. In this understanding, the relationship and the related  
objects are one and the same. This  
notion allowed the Navyanyayas to  
retain their fundamental assumptions  
that there are real objects in the world  
and they are connected to one another.
