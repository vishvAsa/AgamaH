title = "Nayanar"

+++
Group of sixty-three **Shaiva** poet-saints,  
who lived in southern India between the  
seventh and ninth centuries. In concert  
with their **Vaishnava** counterparts the  
**Alvars**, the Nayanars spearheaded the  
revitalization of Hindu religion vis-à-vis  
the Buddhists and the Jains. Both the  
Nayanars and the Alvars stressed passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal  
god—**Shiva** for the Nayanars, **Vishnu** for  
the Alvars—and conveyed this devotion  
through hymns sung in the **Tamil language**. The Nayanars tended to be more  
overtly hostile to the Jains. According to  
legend the Nayanar **Sambandar** was  
instrumental in the **impalement** of  
eight thousand Jain monks in the city  
of **Madurai**. The hymns of the three  
most important Nayanars—**Appar**,  
Sambandar, and **Sundaramurtti**—comprise the **Devaram**, the most sacred of  
the Tamil Shaivite texts. An important  
later source is the **Periya Puranam** by  
**Cekkilar**, which gives hagiographic  
accounts for all the Nayanars.
