title = "Nivrttinath"

+++
(1268–1294?) Elder brother of **Jnaneshvar**,  
the first great poet-saint of the **Varkari**  
**Panth**, a religious community centered  
around the **worship** of the Hindu god  
**Vithoba** at his temple at **Pandharpur** in  
the modern state of **Maharashtra**.  
Nivrttinath is traditionally named as  
Jnaneshvar’s religious teacher (**guru**),  
although his younger brother became  
more influential. According to tradition, Nivrttinath’s guru, Gainanath,  
was a direct disciple of **Gorakhnath**,  
the celebrated **ascetic**. This relationship is indicated in the **Jnaneshvari**, in  
which Jnaneshvar describes himself as  
a pupil in Gorakhnath’s line. For further information see George Weston  
Briggs, *Gorakhnath and the Kanphata*  
*Yogis*, 1973.
