title = "Narayana Bhatta"

+++
(1513–1570?) The most celebrated scholar and commentator on the **dharma literature** of his time, and the patriarch of  
a scholarly family. **Narayana’s** father had  
migrated from the city of **Paithan**, in  
central India, to **Benares**, a center of  
**Sanskrit** learning. Narayana’s work fell  
mainly in the class of commentarial literature known as **nibandhas** (“collections”), which were compilations of  
Hindu lore. Nibandha compilers collected references on a particular theme  
from the **Vedas**, dharma literature,  
**puranas**, and other authoritative religious texts, and then compiled these  
excerpts into a single volume. Aside  
from his unparalleled command of  
these traditional texts, Narayana was  
also noted for his learned interpretation  
462  
Narasimha Jayanti  
and commentary; to these texts, he  
applied the rules that the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** philosophical school had  
originally developed to interpret the  
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
According to tradition, he was a man  
whose personal holiness was equal to  
his great learning. He is reported to have  
performed a miracle by causing rain to  
fall out of **season**, convincing the  
Muslim officials ruling Benares to allow  
the **Vishvanath** temple to be rebuilt.
