title = "Narak Chaturdashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the fourteenth day (chaturdashi) of the dark,  
waning half of the **lunar month** of  
**Kartik** (Octoberâ€“November). People  
who observe this day **worship** and make  
**offerings** to the god **Yama**. In the  
evening they light a lamp in his name.  
Yama is the lord of the underworld and  
the judge of the dead; he reviews the  
deeds of the dead and inflicts punishment upon people for their misdeeds.  
Those who faithfully observe Narak  
Chaturdashi are believed to be spared  
from the torments of **hell**.
