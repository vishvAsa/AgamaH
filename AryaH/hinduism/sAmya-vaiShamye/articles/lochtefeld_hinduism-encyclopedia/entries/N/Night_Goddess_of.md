title = "Night, Goddess of"

+++
In the **Vedas**, the earliest and most  
authoritative Hindu religious texts, the  
gods and goddesses are associated with  
phenomena in the natural world. In the  
Vedas the **goddess** Ratri (Night) is mentioned both as a goddess and as the  
night itself. At times she is seen as lifegiving, allowing people the opportunity  
to refresh and renew themselves. At  
other times she is associated with the  
dangers of the night, such as wild animals and thieves. Ratri is considered a  
sister to **Ushas**, the dawn. As night and  
day alternate, the two goddesses mark
