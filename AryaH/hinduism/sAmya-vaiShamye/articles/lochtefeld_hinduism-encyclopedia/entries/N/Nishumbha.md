In Hindu mythology the name of a  
**demon** killed by the **goddess Kali** in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest and most  
important text for the mythology of the  
Goddess. Together with his brother  
**Shumbha**, Nishumbha is one of the  
generals in the army of a demon named  
**Mahishasura**. Due to a divine boon  
given to Mahishasura, Shumbha and  
Nishumbha are able to vanquish the  
gods and assume control of **heaven**.  
However, they are devoured by Kali, who  
emerges as a manifestation of the  
Goddessâ€™s anger.
