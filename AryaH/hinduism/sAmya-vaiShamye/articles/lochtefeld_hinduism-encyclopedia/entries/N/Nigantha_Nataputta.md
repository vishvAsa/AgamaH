title = "Nigantha Nataputta"

+++
In early Indian **philosophy**, a figure  
whose views are mentioned in the  
Buddhist scriptures. Nigantha advocated  
a four-fold self-restraint, although these  
sources give no further indication of  
his doctrines. It is generally accepted  
that Nigantha was the same person  
as Mahavira. Mahavira is believed to  
have been the last of the Jain  
tirthankaras, the founding figures in the  
Jain religious tradition.
