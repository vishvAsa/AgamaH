title = "Nastika"

+++
(“nihilists”) In Hindu philosophical discourse, this was a pejorative term to  
denigrate certain other religious and  
philosophical schools. The name  
*Nastika* was applied to groups who  
denied the three most basic principles  
of religion: the authority of the **Vedas** as  
religious texts, the eternal existence of  
the soul (**atman**), and the value of religious life in general. In context this term  
could be applied to the Jains (who  
denied the first of these three) to the  
Buddhists (who denied the first and the  
second) or to the **materialist** philosophical school (which denied all three).
