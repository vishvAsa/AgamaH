title = "Nirriti"

+++
(“decay, destruction”) In the **Vedas**,  
the oldest and most authoritative  
Hindu religious texts, Nirriti is a **goddess** personifying all the negative  
aspects associated with life. Nirriti’s  
personality is not well-defined, for she  
is rarely mentioned; the hymns mentioning her usually express the hope that  
she will stay away and allow the speakers to be free from misfortune. For further information on Nirriti and all the  
goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.  
Kinsley, *Hindu Goddesses*, 1986.
