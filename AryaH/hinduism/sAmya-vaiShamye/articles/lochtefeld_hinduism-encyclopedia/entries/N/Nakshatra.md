title = "Nakshatra"

+++
In Indian astrology (**jyotisha**), a nakshatra  
is one of the twenty-seven signs in the  
lunar **zodiac**. In a single **lunar month** the  
**moon** moves through each of the twentyseven lunar houses. The territory for these  
lunar houses is divided equally throughout the solar zodiacâ€”with 2.25 lunar  
houses for each of the twelve solar signs.  
The nakshatras are important in Indian  
astrology, partly because they change  
quite rapidly, but also because the character and qualities associated with each  
nakshatra are believed to color the time  
period in which they fall. One group of five  
nakshatras, the **Panchak Nakshatra**, is  
considered extremely **inauspicious**; many  
activities will be curtailed until this period  
has passed. Certain nakshatras are judged  
to be incompatible with certain everyday  
activities, which should be avoided during  
that time. Hindus who pay attention to  
astrology are keenly aware of the passage  
of time and the quality of each moment.
