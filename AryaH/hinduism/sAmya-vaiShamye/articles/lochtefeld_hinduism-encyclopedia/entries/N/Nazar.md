(“glance”) The literal meaning of the  
word *nazar* is an unobstructed line of  
sight to a person or a thing. The word  
*nazar* is also the term most commonly  
470  
Nayachandra Suri  
used to denote the “evil eye,” a malefic  
influence that is put on people  
through sight, particularly eye-to-eye  
contact. The existence of the evil eye is  
widely accepted among traditional  
Hindus. It is warded off either by  
avoiding this sort of gaze, or by performing **rites of protection**. For further consideration see David F.  
Pocock, “The Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan  
(ed.), *Religion in India*, 1991.
