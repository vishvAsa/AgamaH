title = "Rat"

+++
An animal with a prominent place in at  
least two religious contexts. On one  
hand, the rat is famous as the animal  
vehicle of the **elephant**-headed god  
**Ganesh**, and reinforces Ganesh’s identity as the Lord of Obstacles. If Ganesh’s  
elephant head represents his power to  
remove obstacles by simply knocking  
them aside, his rat vehicle shows a  
stealthier approach. Rats are famous  
for their ability to work their way  
around obstacles, slipping through the  
smallest cracks in granaries to get to  
the grain inside. In their ability to slip  
around and between obstructing  
objects, they stand as a worthy complement to Ganesh’s power.  
Rats are also important to the temple  
of the **goddess Karni Mata** in the village  
of **Deshnok**, in the state of **Rajasthan**.  
The Karni Mata temple is inhabited by  
thousands of rats, considered to be  
Karni Mata’s **sons** and thus sacred **animals**. According to tradition, when the  
rats die they are reborn as members of  
the families that comprise the temple’s  
hereditary servants, and thus the rats  
and the temple priests are all members  
of one extended family.
