General name for the “king’s **dharma**,”  
or religious duty, which fell to him (or far  
more rarely, her) by virtue of his role as  
ruler. This notion proceeded from the  
assumption in the **dharma literature**  
that every person had a unique role to  
play in society, a role that provided for  
social stability but also brought individual fulfillment. The king’s most basic  
duty was to maintain order in the realm,  
since such peace enabled all others to  
fulfill their own individual religious  
duties (**svadharma**). The dharma literature conceives of maintaining order primarily through inflicting punishment  
(**danda**), designed to remove some evildoers and frighten the rest into good  
behavior. If the king succeeded in maintaining social order, then he could otherwise do as he pleased, with the proviso  
that taxation should not be so high that  
it was burdensome to the people.  
Beyond this, the Indian theory of kingship was largely pragmatic.
