title = "Reflectionism"

+++
Theory used in later schools of **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** to explain how one single primal ignorance could afflict multiple  
ignorant selves. Reflectionism is rooted  
in the idea of an image appearing in a  
mirror; different from the original, it is  
nonetheless based on it. In the same  
way, according to this explanation, the  
ignorance affecting each individual is  
simply a reflection of a primal ignorance. For further information see Karl  
H. Potter, *Presuppositions of Indiaâ€™s*  
*Philosophies*, 1972.
