title = "Ras Lila"

+++
In the mythology of the god **Krishna**, the  
ras lila is the “circle dance” that **Krishna**  
and his devotees (**bhakta**), the **gopis**,  
perform on autumn nights on the shore  
of the **Yamuna River**. In this dance—a  
symbol of communion with the divine—  
Krishna offers a form of himself to every  
woman present, in order to convince  
each one that God is paying attention to  
her and to her alone.
