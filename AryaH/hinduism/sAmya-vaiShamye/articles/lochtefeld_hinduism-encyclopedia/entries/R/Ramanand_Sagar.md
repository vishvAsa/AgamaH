title = "Ramanand Sagar"

+++
Director of the televised production of  
the **Ramayana**, which was completed in  
the late 1980s. The episodes were aired  
each Sunday morning for about a year,  
and were wildly successful despite problems with production quality. (Some of  
these problems undoubtedly derived  
from the difficulties of preserving the  
immediacy of the oral experience of  
traditional storytelling in the modern  
medium of television.) In the mid-  
1990s Sagar devoted his attention to  
other mythological television serials,  
with an extended series on the life of  
the god **Krishna**.
