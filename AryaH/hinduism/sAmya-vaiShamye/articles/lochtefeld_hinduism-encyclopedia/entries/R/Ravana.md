title = "Ravana"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Ravana is the tenheaded **demon** king of **Lanka**. To destroy  
Ravana, the god **Vishnu** is born in his  
incarnation as **Rama**. Ravana is a reincarnation of Vishnu’s gatekeeper **Jaya**, who  
has been cursed by a sage to be reborn  
three times as a demon and to be killed  
by Vishnu each time. As a **rakshasa**, a  
type of demon, Ravana possesses enormous physical strength and various  
**magic** powers. He augments these natural abilities by performing intense physical **asceticism** (**tapas**), which in Indian  
culture is widely believed to generate  
spiritual power and bring boons from the  
gods. When the god **Brahma** finally  
appears and directs Ravana to choose his  
boon, Ravana requests that he be able to  
be killed by no one but a human being.  
This seems to make him practically  
immortal, since his powers are such that  
no ordinary human will be able to harm  
him, much less kill him. Ravana then proceeds to terrorize the gods, secure in the  
knowledge that they will not be able to  
harm him. He begins with his half-brother, the minor **deity Kubera**, who loses his  
home and all his possessions to Ravana.  
Ravana’s virtual invulnerability goes  
to his head, and the powerful demon  
begins to disregard all rules of decency  
and morality. He is particularly guilty of  
molesting and abducting women, acts  
which result in various **curses** being laid  
upon him by his helpless victims, many  
of them predicting his death. As a result  
of one of these curses his sister  
**Shurpanakha** is mutilated by Rama’s  
brother **Lakshmana**. Ravana is determined to avenge this insult, and decides  
that the best way will be to abduct

the *Ramayana*, Ravana acquires great magical powers, which he abuses until Rama kills him in battle.  
Rama’s wife **Sita**. Although his wife  
**Mandodari** and his brothers rebuke him  
for this act and advise him to return Sita  
and make peace with Rama, Ravana  
stubbornly refuses to listen. His inflated  
pride and desire to avenge the insult to  
his sister deafen his ears to their good  
counsel, and he eventually pays for his  
stubbornness with his life when Rama  
kills him in battle.  
As with all **demons**, Ravana is not  
completely villainous by nature but  
rather greatly powerful and greatly  
flawed at the same time. According to  
some stories he is a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**, and the hymn to the  
dancing Shiva known as the  
Shivatandava **Stotra** is often attributed  
to Ravana.
