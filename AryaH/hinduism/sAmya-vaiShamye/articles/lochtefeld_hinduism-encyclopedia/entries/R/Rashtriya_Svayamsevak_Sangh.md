(“National Volunteer Corps,” hereafter  
RSS) Hindu nationalist organization  
founded in 1925 by **Dr. K. B.**  
**Hedgewar**. Since its inception the RSS  
has ascribed to the ideals of **Hindutva**,  
the notion that the Hindus are a  
nation despite their regional, linguistic, and cultural differences. The RSS  
has historically characterized itself as  
a cultural and character-building  
organization and, for much of its existence, has shunned direct political  
involvement, although it has exercised  
considerable influence through its  
many affiliated organizations.  
RSS training stresses loyalty, obedience, discipline, and dedication to the  
advancement of the Hindu nation, but  
does not encourage the development of  
independent thought. The heart of its  
program are the daily meetings of its  
neighborhood units known as **shakhas**  
(“branches”). At these meetings members, known as **svayamsevaks** (“volunteers”), spend part of their time playing  
games, part of their time practicing martial drill—including sparring with  
sticks—and part of their time discussing  
and absorbing RSS ideals. The shakhas in  
any given area are overseen by a fulltime RSS worker known as a **pracharak**  
(“director”), who serves as a liaison  
between the local units and the RSS leadership and who oversees RSS activity in  
his area.  
As an organization, the RSS is profoundly elitist, and its self-proclaimed

Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh  
In their daily meetings, members of the Rashtriya  
Svayamsevak Sangh practice martial drills that  
include sparring with sticks.  
mission is to provide leadership for a  
renascent Hindu India. Most of its  
members will never advance beyond  
the local level, but those who do are  
generally remarkably efficient, effective  
leaders. Although the RSS has shunned  
direct activism that would tarnish its  
self-proclaimed cultural emphasis, it  
has exercised considerable influence  
through the formation of affiliated organizations, for which it has provided the  
leadership cadre. These organizations  
are spread throughout every level of  
Indian society, from labor and student  
unions to service organizations, religious organizations such as the **Vishva**  
**Hindu Parishad** (VHP), and political parties such as the **Bharatiya Janata Party**.  
Although the RSS has produced some  
remarkably effective leaders, it has also  
generated considerable controversy.  
One reason is that it is a highly authoritarian organization, run on the model of  
the Hindu joint family. All authority is  
vested in a single supreme leader, the  
sarsanghchalak, and proceeds downward from there. In this way the RSS is  
profoundly undemocratic, and many of  
its opponents—particularly in the political arena—have felt uneasy about having it as the controlling hand behind  
its affiliated organizations. Other  
opponents have also worried about its  
anti-Muslim and anti-Christian tone—  
non-Hindus were not allowed to join the  
organization until 1979—a tone rooted  
in the organization’s Hindutva ideals. A  
final reservation about the RSS comes on  
social grounds. The RSS has long condemned untouchability, and has also  
long asserted that **caste** distinctions did  
not exist within its ranks—in keeping  
with its Hindutva roots, it proclaims that  
all its members are Hindus and Hindus  
only. Nevertheless, critics have noted  
that most RSS members come from  
**brahmin** and other privileged castes,  
and that all of its leaders have been  
brahmins. These critics contend that  
such public disavowal of caste distinctions is a mask to perpetuate brahmin  
control and to conceal whose interests  
the RSS truly serves. For further information see Walter K. Andersen and
