title = "Ravidasi"

+++
Name taken by followers of the  
**untouchable** poet-saint **Ravidas**. The  
Ravidasis emphasize many ideas found  
in the poetry of Ravidas, such as the  
irrelevancy of ideas of **purity** and impurity (**ashaucha**), the futility of trying to  
contain the divine in texts and rites, and  
his vision of a society in which all people  
can have equal status, whatever their  
background. It is unlikely that the  
Ravidasis were established by Ravidas  
himself, nor is Ravidas an object of **worship** for them, although he is held as a  
model for religious equality, based on  
the messages in his poetry. In modern  
times the Ravidasis have focused on  
opposing all sorts of **caste**-based  
discrimination and have also taken  
up the empowerment of various lowcaste groups. This movement is very  
recent, and to date little has been  
published about it; for some information see the introduction to Ravidas in  
John Stratton Hawley and Mark  
Juergensmeyer (trans.), *Songs of the*  
*Saints of India*, 1988.
