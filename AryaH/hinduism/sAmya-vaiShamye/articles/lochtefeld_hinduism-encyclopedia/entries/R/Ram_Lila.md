Any public dramatic presentation of the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics. The epic’s basic plot  
561  
Ram Lila  
An effigy of Ravana from the Ram Lila, a dramatic presentation of the *Ramcharitmanas*.  
revolves around the unjust exile of the  
god-king **Rama**; the abduction of  
Rama’s wife **Sita** by **Ravana**, the  
**demon**-king of **Lanka**; and Rama’s  
search to regain Sita, a struggle that  
ultimately ends in Ravana’s death. Ram  
Lilas are prominent during the autumn  
in northern India, and usually correspond with the festival of **Dussehra**  
(October–November), which celebrates  
Rama’s victory over Ravana and thus the  
symbolic triumph of good over evil. Late  
in the nineteenth century the Ram Lilas  
were important symbolic vehicles for  
demonstrating pride in Indian culture.  
Additionally, they were considered a  
coded symbol of resistance to British  
rule. Today, Ram Lilas can be found  
throughout northern India in many of  
the larger cities, while neighborhood  
associations often sponsor their own  
local productions.  
The longest, most elaborate, and  
arguably the oldest Ram Lila is held at  
**Ramnagar**, the fortified town where the  
kings of **Benares** reside. The Ramnagar  
Ram Lila was begun in the early nineteenth century, during the reign of **Udit**  
**Narayan Singh**, and the Maharaja of  
Benares still plays an important symbolic  
role in the production even though he  
no longer wields temporal power over  
the city. It lasts for thirty-one days, during which the action moves to different  
places in and around Ramnagar.  
Thousands of faithful viewers follow the  
drama for the entire month, but on peak  
days the audience can reach 100,000.
