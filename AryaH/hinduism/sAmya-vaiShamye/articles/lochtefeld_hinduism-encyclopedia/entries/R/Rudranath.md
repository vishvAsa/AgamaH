Rudranath is one of the **Panchkedar**, a  
network of five sacred sites spread  
throughout the Garhwal region; the other  
four sites are **Kedarnath**, **Kalpeshvar**,  
**Tungnath**, and **Madmaheshvar**. This network of five sites is seen as a symbolic representation of Shiva’s body, since Shiva is  
believed to dwell in the Himalayas.  
Rudranath is believed to be Shiva’s face.
