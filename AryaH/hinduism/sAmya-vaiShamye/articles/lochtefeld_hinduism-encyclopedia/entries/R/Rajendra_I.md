title = "Rajendra I"

+++
(r. 1014â€“42) Monarch under whose rule  
(and that of his father, **Raja Raja**) the  
**Chola dynasty** reached the apex of its  
power, stretching its influence from the  
**Tanjore** region in **Tamil Nadu**, throughout southern India, and into southeast  
Asia all the way to Malaysia. In 1023  
Rajendra defeated one of the kings of  
Bengal to extend his empire all the way  
to the **Ganges** but was unable to maintain authority over this expansive  
domain for long. He also fought a campaign against the Shrivijaya Empire in  
modern Malaysia, to retain control of  
trade from China. Like his father,  
Rajendra was a great patron of templebuilding and other public monuments,  
including the great temple at **Gangaikondacholapuran**, built to commemorate the victory that opened the way to  
the Ganges.
