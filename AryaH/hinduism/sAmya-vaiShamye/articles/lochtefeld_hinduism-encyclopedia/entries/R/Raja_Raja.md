+++
(r. 985–1014) Monarch under whose rule  
(and that of his son **Rajendra**) the **Chola**  
**dynasty** reached the apex of its power,  
stretching its influence from the **Tanjore**  
district of **Tamil Nadu** throughout  
southern India and into southeast Asia  
all the way to Malaysia. Raja Raja directed  
the wealth that such power brought  
toward the construction of massive  
temples. Of these, he is most noted  
for the **Brhadeshvar** temple in the city  
of Tanjore, dedicated to the “Great  
Lord” **Shiva**.
