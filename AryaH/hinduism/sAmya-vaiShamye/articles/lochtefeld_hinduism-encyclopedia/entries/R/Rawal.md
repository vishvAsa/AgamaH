title = "Rawal"

+++
Title given to the head priest (**pujari**) at  
the temple of **Badrinath** in the  
**Himalayas**. The Rawal is invariably a  
**Nambudiri brahmin**, who must remain  
unmarried to retain his position.  
In Hindu belief, Badrinath is one of  
the **four dhams** (“divine abodes”)  
connected with the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. Seeking to combat the  
spread of Buddhism and revitalize  
Hindu religion, Shankaracharya reportedly chose one Hindu sacred center in  
each corner of the subcontinent, and at  
each established a **Dashanami Sanyasi**  
monastic center (**math**) to train learned  
monks. Badrinath is associated with  
the **Jyotir Math** in the Himalayan  
town of **Joshimath**, forty miles south,  
which is also the place where the **deity**  
Badrinath is symbolically transported  
for the winter.  
According to Badrinath temple  
records, for several hundred years the  
position of head priest was filled by  
**Dandi Sanyasis**, who were also  
Nambudiri brahmins, the same **caste**  
into which Shankaracharya is supposed  
to have been born. When the last of  
these died without a successor in 1776,  
the local king who served as the protector of the shrine invited a non-**ascetic**  
Nambudiri brahmin to serve as the temple’s priest. This priest was given the title  
*rawal* (from the word *raja*, “deputy”),  
and his extended family has run the  
shrine since then. The rawal was the  
only person allowed to touch the image  
of Badrinath, and was responsible for  
performing **worship** during the six  
months that the temple is open.  
Because of these duties, the rawal was  
required to remain a bachelor, lest the  
ritual impurity arising from the **birth** of  
a child (**sutakashaucha**) render him  
unable to attend to his duties. Until the  
Badrinath Temple Act of 1939 established a temple board as the ultimate  
authority, the rawals had sole rights to  
the **offerings** given at the shrine.
