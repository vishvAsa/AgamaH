(8th c.) Ruler in the **Pallava dynasty**  
who, like his predecessors, was a great  
patron of the arts. His reign saw the construction of the last of the magnificent  
shore temples built on the Bay of  
Bengal, at **Mahabalipuram** in **Tamil**  
**Nadu**. The templeâ€™s major **deity** was the  
god **Shiva**, but a smaller shrine also held  
an image of the god **Vishnu**. Although  
these temples have been weathered by  
time and the elements, they remain  
some of the most visited sites in southern India.
