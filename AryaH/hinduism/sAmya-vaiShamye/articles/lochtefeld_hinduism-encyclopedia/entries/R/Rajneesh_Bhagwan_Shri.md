title = "Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shri"

+++
(b. Mohan Chandra Rajneesh, 1931–  
\1990) Controversial Hindu teacher who  
mixed traditional Hindu teachings with  
ideas gleaned from modern psychology.  
He is most popularly associated with a  
permissive attitude toward sexuality  
that attracted many of his followers,  
both Western and Indian, although the  
former tended to predominate. This was  
part of a more generally indulgent attitude in which people were encouraged  
to act upon their desires, as a way to  
remove impediments to ultimate realization. For some time his **ashram** was  
located in Pune in the state of  
**Maharashtra**, but in 1981 he relocated  
to southern Oregon, propelled by local  
opposition and an investigation by  
Indian tax officials. For several years the  
new site was highly successful, but local  
opposition to his teachings and unease  
about his lifestyle—he reportedly owned  
ninety-three Rolls-Royces and was protected by Uzi-toting bodyguards—  
548  
Rajasuya  
caused the spectacular collapse of this  
community in 1985. Rajneesh returned  
to India, where he eventually took up  
residence in Pune again. In his last years  
he changed his name several times—  
once claiming that the spirit of  
**Gautama** Buddha had entered him—  
and at the time of his death had taken  
the name Osho.
