(“Series [of poems] to **Rama**”) A series of  
330 short poems dedicated to the god  
Rama, written in the **Braj Bhasha** form  
of **Hindi** by the poet-saint **Tulsidas**  
(1532–1623?). The *Ramavali* is one of  
Tulsidas’ longest extant works—shorter  
only than the **Ramcharitmanas**. The  
seven sections in the *Ramavali* parallel  
the structure of the **Ramayana**, but differing sections receive unequal emphasis. Tulsidas gives his greatest attention  
to Rama’s childhood and paints lyrical  
images of the child Rama’s divine play  
(**lila**). Here Tulsidas clearly borrows  
from devotional poetry to the god  
**Krishna**, in which such childhood  
images are well established. Yet the  
*Ramavali*’s portrayal of Rama deemphasizes the mischievous qualities  
associated with Krishna, to stress  
instead the generally milder nature of  
Rama, and to highlight the devotee’s  
(**bhakta**) quiet delight in sharing his  
divine presence.
