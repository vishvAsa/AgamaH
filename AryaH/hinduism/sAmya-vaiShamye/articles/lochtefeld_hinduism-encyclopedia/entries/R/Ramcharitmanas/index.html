  <meta property="og:description" content="(“Holy Lake of Rama’s Deeds”) Vernacular
retelling of the Ramayana, the earlier of
the two great Sanskrit epics. The
Ramcharitmanas was written by the
poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623), in the
language known as Avadhi, an eastern
variant of medieval Hindi. Evidence
indicates that Tulsidas began the text
in Ayodhya in 1574. At nearly 10,000
lines, this text is by far his longest work
and is generally considered to be his
greatest. For the most part the poem is
structured in groups of six to eight
verses written in the chaupai form, followed by a verse in the shorter doha
form. (The doha verse either sums up
the essence of the preceding chaupai
verses or serves to foreshadow later
developments.) There are also verses
written in longer meters such as
savaiya, as well as invocations in fluid
Sanskrit poetry at the beginning of
each of the seven sections. Tulsidas
was a masterful epic poet, as evidenced both by the sheer size of his
text and the high poetic quality of the
verses contained in it.
As with all the Ramayana’s vernacular retellings, Tulsidas did not merely
translate the story of Rama but interpreted it according to his own religious
convictions. His two most important
changes to the poem are the overwhelming emphasis on the importance
of devotion (bhakti), and the saving
power of the name of Rama, to which
Tulsidas gives greater importance than
Rama himself. Tulsidas also includes
mythic material from a variety of other
sources, most notably the Shiva Purana
and the Adhyatmaramayana. This
material is largely added to the first and
last chapters, in which Tulsidas makes
his greatest changes from the original
558
Rambha Ekadashi
epic. One theory to explain why Tulsidas
brought in this other material argues
that he endeavored to transcend narrow
sectarian boundaries, for example, by
having the god Shiva narrate much of
the text in the form of a dialogue to his
wife Parvati. Later, in part of the final
book, Shiva is supplanted as narrator by
the crow Bhushundi, who symbolizes
the power of devotion to rescue even a
common carrion-eating crow.
The Ramcharitmanas has popularly
been called the “Bible of northern
India,” reflecting its enormous influence
on ordinary people’s piety. Although
according to legend Tulsidas faced some
opposition from brahmins who thought
it sacrilegious to translate the Ramayana
into a vernacular tongue, the text has
been immensely popular with ordinary
people. Even now there are many people
who can recite large sections from
memory (“discourses” (katha) on the
text can draw hundreds or thousands
of people) and many of the verses have
become proverbial expressions in
modern Hindi. Aside from reading or
hearing the text, millions of people see
it each autumn, in the dramatic presentation known as the Ram Lila. The
oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,
held at Ramnagar in Benares, uses the
text from the Ramcharitmanas, and
takes great pride in this traditionalism.

  <p>(“Holy Lake of <strong>Rama’s</strong> Deeds”) Vernacular<br>
retelling of the <strong>Ramayana</strong>, the earlier of<br>
the two great <strong>Sanskrit</strong> epics. The<br>
<em>Ramcharitmanas</em> was written by the<br>
poet-saint <strong>Tulsidas</strong> (1532–1623), in the<br>
language known as <strong>Avadhi</strong>, an eastern<br>
variant of medieval <strong>Hindi</strong>. Evidence<br>
indicates that Tulsidas began the text<br>
in <strong>Ayodhya</strong> in 1574. At nearly 10,000<br>
lines, this text is by far his longest work<br>
and is generally considered to be his<br>
greatest. For the most part the poem is<br>
structured in groups of six to eight<br>
verses written in the <strong>chaupai</strong> form, followed by a verse in the shorter <strong>doha</strong><br>
form. (The doha verse either sums up<br>
the essence of the preceding chaupai<br>
verses or serves to foreshadow later<br>
developments.) There are also verses<br>
written in longer meters such as<br>
<strong>savaiya</strong>, as well as invocations in fluid<br>
Sanskrit poetry at the beginning of<br>
each of the seven sections. Tulsidas<br>
was a masterful epic poet, as evidenced both by the sheer size of his<br>
text and the high poetic quality of the<br>
verses contained in it.<br>
As with all the <em>Ramayana</em>’s vernacular retellings, Tulsidas did not merely<br>
translate the story of Rama but interpreted it according to his own religious<br>
convictions. His two most important<br>
changes to the poem are the overwhelming emphasis on the importance<br>
of devotion (<strong>bhakti</strong>), and the saving<br>
power of the name of Rama, to which<br>
Tulsidas gives greater importance than<br>
Rama himself. Tulsidas also includes<br>
mythic material from a variety of other<br>
sources, most notably the <strong>Shiva Purana</strong><br>
and the <em>Adhyatmaramayana</em>. This<br>
material is largely added to the first and<br>
last chapters, in which Tulsidas makes<br>
his greatest changes from the original<br>
558<br>
Rambha Ekadashi<br>
epic. One theory to explain why Tulsidas<br>
brought in this other material argues<br>
that he endeavored to transcend narrow<br>
sectarian boundaries, for example, by<br>
having the god <strong>Shiva</strong> narrate much of<br>
the text in the form of a dialogue to his<br>
wife <strong>Parvati</strong>. Later, in part of the final<br>
book, Shiva is supplanted as narrator by<br>
the crow <strong>Bhushundi</strong>, who symbolizes<br>
the power of devotion to rescue even a<br>
common carrion-eating crow.<br>
The <em>Ramcharitmanas</em> has popularly<br>
been called the “Bible of northern<br>
India,” reflecting its enormous influence<br>
on ordinary people’s piety. Although<br>
according to legend Tulsidas faced some<br>
opposition from <strong>brahmins</strong> who thought<br>
it sacrilegious to translate the <em>Ramayana</em><br>
into a vernacular tongue, the text has<br>
been immensely popular with ordinary<br>
people. Even now there are many people<br>
who can recite large sections from<br>
memory (“discourses” (<strong>katha</strong>) on the<br>
text can draw hundreds or thousands<br>
of people) and many of the verses have<br>
become proverbial expressions in<br>
modern Hindi. Aside from reading or<br>
hearing the text, millions of people see<br>
it each autumn, in the dramatic presentation known as the <strong>Ram Lila</strong>. The<br>
oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,<br>
held at <strong>Ramnagar</strong> in <strong>Benares</strong>, uses the<br>
text from the <em>Ramcharitmanas</em>, and<br>
takes great pride in this traditionalism.<br>

Lutgendorf, <em>The Life of a Text</em>, 1991.</p>
