title = "Rajabhiseka"

+++
(“royal anointing”) Royal **consecration**  
ceremony that replaced the earlier **rajasuya** rite. The Rajabhiseka includes rituals of anointing that were believed to  
have transformative power, but were  
less complex than the Rajasuya, and did  
not involve the ritual slaughter and **sacrifice** of **animals**.
