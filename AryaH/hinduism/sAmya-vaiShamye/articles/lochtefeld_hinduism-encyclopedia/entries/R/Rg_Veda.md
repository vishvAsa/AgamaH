title = "Rg Veda"

+++
The oldest and most important of the  
four **Vedas**, which are themselves the  
most ancient and authoritative Hindu  
religious texts. The Rg Veda is a group of  
1,028 hymns collected in ten books.  
Judging by their content, the hymns  
were clearly composed over a long period  
of time, but the actual dates are the subject of sharp disagreement. Traditional  
Hindus assert that the Vedas were not  
composed either by God or by human  
beings but, rather, simply heard by  
ancient sages through their advanced  
powers of perception, and then transmitted orally from generation to generation. Because of their origin, the Vedas  
thus belong to the class of religious texts  
known as **shruti** (“heard”). Scholarly  
consensus maintains that the Vedas  
were begun in the earlier part of the  
second millennium B.C.E., perhaps  
1800–1500 B.C.E., and were finished  
somewhere around the end of the  
second millennium B.C.E., perhaps  
1200–900. All these dates are highly  
speculative, since the hymns themselves  
have no internal evidence to allow precise dating, which has instead been  
based primarily on a comparative study  
of changes in the language of certain  
Vedas. Some of the hymns, for example,  
are thought to have been created relatively later than others, both because  
their language is less archaic and closer  
to classical **Sanskrit** and because the  
locations mentioned in them reflect a  
broader geographical area.  
Most of the hymns in the Rg Veda are  
addressed to a particular **deity**. The primary deities are **Indra**, **Agni**, and **Soma**,  
although **Varuna** is prominent in the  
earliest hymns. It is generally accepted  
that the hymns were chanted at sacrifices as a way to invoke these deities.  
Evidence from the hymns themselves  
describes these sacrifices as large public  
rites, usually involving the slaughter of  
**animals**, which were burned on a sacrificial **fire**, and the preparation and consumption of the mysterious beverage  
soma. In this context, the Vedic hymns  
reflect a body of sacred learning known  
to only a small group of religious specialists. Accordingly, these hymns were  
never meant for universal public dissemination, since all except **twice-born**  
men were forbidden to hear them.

Rg Veda  
The Rg Veda’s tenth and final book  
differs sharply from the preceding ones.  
Its language is closer to classical  
Sanskrit, and its content is far more  
speculative than that of the earlier  
books, hinting at a major conceptual  
shift. This book features the famous  
**Creation Hymn** (10.129), in which the  
poet speculates on how the world came  
to be, only to conclude that the answer  
may be unknown even to the creator.  
Another notable hymn in this book is  
the **Purusha Sukta** (10.90), which  
describes both the earth and human  
society as the product of a primeval **sacrifice**. The former hymn foreshadows  
the religious and cosmological speculation found in the texts known as the  
**Upanishads**. The latter, which contains  
the first known articulation of the four  
major social groups (**varnas**), along with  
their symbolic functions, is distinguished as foreshadowing the later  
**dharma literature**.
