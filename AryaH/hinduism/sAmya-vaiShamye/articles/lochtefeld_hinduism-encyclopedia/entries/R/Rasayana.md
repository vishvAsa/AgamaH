+++
(“method of essences”) Alchemical  
school specializing in the use of certain  
chemicals, particularly compounds  
made from elemental **mercury**, in a  
quest to transmute the body and render  
it immortal. Some scholars have characterized rasayana as the Buddhist school  
564  
Ramsnehi  
of **alchemy**, with the Hindu school  
known as **dhatuvada**. The reported difference is that the latter relied solely on  
the consumption of mercurials, whereas  
the former used mercurials only to prolong life until the body could be transmuted through meditation, ritual, and  
extramaterial means. Despite these differing conceptions of the end of the  
process, the two schools overlap considerably on many other points. Both also  
probably draw from a common alchemical tradition. For further information
