(“Organization for Ram’s Reign”)  
Northern Indian political party formed  
immediately after Indian independence  
in 1947. It was founded by Swami  
**Karpatri**, an influential modern Hindu  
**ascetic**. The term Ram Rajya carries  
mythical significance, referring to the  
period of righteous rule by the god-king  
**Rama**, the protagonist of the epic  
**Ramayana**, after his return from fourteen years of exile in the forest.  
According to popular belief, Rama’s  
reign was marked by perfect peace, justice, and social harmony.  
The Ram Rajya Parishad sought to  
reshape India according to the vision of  
this mythical time, and the party’s political platform was solidly rooted in conservative Hindu religious ideas. The  
party strongly supported the **caste** system, with its traditional division of  
social status and labor, and believed that  
it was essential for a smoothly functioning society. This position would have  
condemned most low-caste people to a  
life of servitude, although the party did  
leave them a few meager windows for  
advancement. One of these was managing shoe factories, since **leather** is considered religiously impure by the higher  
castes, and thus working with leather is  
the traditional occupation of certain low  
status groups. Aside from their views on  
the validity of the caste system, the Ram  
Rajya Parishad also supported other  
conservative Hindu causes, particularly  
a total ban on **cow slaughter** and a complete ban on the production and consumption of **liquor**. The Ram Rajya  
Parishad’s constituency came mainly  
from conservative, upper-class Hindus,  
particularly those in the **Ganges** River  
basin. Its conservatism gave those outside this group no incentive to support  
it. Although it had limited electoral success in years immediately after independence, within a dozen years the party  
had been reduced to a completely marginal presence.
