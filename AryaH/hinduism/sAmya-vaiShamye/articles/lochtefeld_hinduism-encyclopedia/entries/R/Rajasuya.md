Royal **consecration** ceremony that is  
one of the most famous of the sacrificial  
rites that appear in the **Vedas**, the earliest and most authoritative Hindu religious texts. The ceremony is believed to  
have developed in the latter part of the  
Vedic era. Preparations for this rite could  
last for a **year**, and the rite itself served  
to raise the king to semidivine status. As  
with many Vedic sacrifices, an important part of the rajasuya **sacrifice** was  
the ritual slaughter and **offering** of **animals**. This rite has long fallen into disuse, partly because of the trouble  
required to prepare for it and partly  
because of general disapproval over **animal sacrifices**. The coronation rite that  
has replaced it is the **rajabhiseka**.
