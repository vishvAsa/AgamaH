title = "Rajagrha"

+++
Ancient name for the city corresponding  
to modern Rajgir, in the Nalanda district  
of the state of **Bihar**. Although contemporary Rajgir is a small and insignificant  
city, at the time of the Buddha it was the  
capital of the Magadhan empire and the  
center of the region’s political and intellectual life. According to Buddhist tradition, Rajgir was the site of the first  
Buddhist council, held shortly after the  
Buddha’s death and organized to document his teachings. This story is almost  
certainly apocryphal, since the Buddhist  
scriptures went through a much longer  
period of development, but its setting  
illustrates Rajagrha’s centrality in the  
middle of the first millennium before  
the turn of the common era.
