title = "Ravidas"

(ca. 1500) **Sant** poet-saint who lived his  
life in the city of **Benares** and is traditionally believed to have been a younger  
contemporary of the poet-saint **Kabir**.  
The Sants were a loose group of central  
and northern Indian poet-saints who  
shared several general tendencies: stress  
on individualized, interior religion leading to a personal experience of the  
divine; disdain for external ritual, particularly image **worship**; faith in the power  
of the divine Name; and a tendency to  
ignore conventional **caste** distinctions.  
Both tradition and references in his  
poetry describe Ravidas as a **leather**  
worker (**chamar**), a social group whose  
contact with dead **animals** and their  
skins rendered them **untouchable**. He is  
believed to have supported himself by  
his hereditary trade, and much of his  
poetry speaks on issues of worldly **birth**  
and status. He never denied the importance of heredity but ultimately felt that  
his devotion to God had helped him to  
transcend his birth and given him status  
based on different criteria. His poetry  
reflects this staunch personal faith, as  
do his frequent warnings to his listeners  
that life is short and difficult, and that  
they should pay great attention to religious practice.  
Given his low social status, Ravidas  
was almost certainly illiterate. His poetic songs were likely first transmitted  
orally, though their personal appeal  
made him one of the most popular sant  
poets. The two oldest attested sources  
of his work are the **Adigranth**, the scripture for the Sikh community, and the  
**Panchvani** collections, compiled by the  
**Dadupanth**. In modern India, Ravidas  
has also served as a model for the  
depressed classes; his followers call  
themselves **Ravidasis**. For further
