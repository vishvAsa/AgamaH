title = "Radha Soami"

+++
Modern Hindu religious community  
founded in 1861 in the city of Agra by  
Shiv Dayal Singh, more commonly  
referred to as Soamiji Maharaj. Soamiji’s  
family had been influenced by **Tulsi**  
Saheb, a devotional (**bhakti**) saint who  
lived in that region, and Soamiji’s teachings reflect the importance of that  
contact. The two pillars of Radha Soami  
doctrine are the importance of the  
spiritual teacher (**guru**) and the practice  
of a spiritual discipline called **suratshabd-yoga.**  
According to Radha Soami teachings,  
contact with a guru is the single most  
important factor in a person’s spiritual  
development, and this spiritual progress  
hinges on complete surrender to the  
guru’s **grace**. It is essential for the devotee (**bhakta**) to be associated with a  
“true guru” (**satguru**), since not only  
does such an individual have access to  
the divine, he is considered a manifestation of the divine itself. Surat-shabdyoga stresses joining (yoga) the  
devotee’s spirit (surat) with the Divine  
Sound (shabd). The Divine Sound  
emanates from the Supreme Being and  
is always present. Most people cannot  
hear it, due to their preoccupation with  
worldly things, but with proper training  
and devotion to a true guru, anyone can  
eventually become attuned to the  
Divine Sound and resonate in harmony  
with it.  
In the era since Soamiji Maharaj, the  
Radha Soami **Satsang** has split numerous times, usually based on disagreements over spiritual authority. Given the  
Radha Soami emphasis on the satguru  
as the Supreme Being, disagreements  
over spiritual succession—in effect, disagreements over the identity of the  
Supreme Being—made schisms virtually  
inevitable. It also seems clear that the  
underlying forces in many of these  
schisms were disagreements over  
far more mundane things, such as  
power, status, and property. Various  
branches of the Radha Soamis  
have made successful missionary  
efforts and established centers in  
Europe and the United States. For
