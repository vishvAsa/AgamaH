(“**Raghu’s** Lineage”) One of the great  
poetic works by **Kalidasa**, who is generally considered to be the finest classical  
**Sanskrit** poet. The *Raghuvamsha* is a  
quasi-historical epic in nineteen cantos,  
devoted to the kings of the **Solar Line**,  
and particularly to its most eminent  
member, the god-king **Rama**. The story  
of Rama in Kalidasa’s poem is fairly close  
to that of the epic **Ramayana**, although  
Kalidasa describes Rama as an **avatar** or  
divine incarnation in a way that **Valmiki**  
does not. Kalidasa’s poem also uses the  
kings of the Solar Line as examples of  
devotion to the four **aims of life**  
(purushartha): wealth (**artha**), pleasure  
(**kama**), religious duty (**dharma**), and  
release (**moksha**). In Kalidasa’s portrayal,  
the kings at the end of the line are  
completely immoral and devoted  
solely to pleasure. Such abject neglect  
of their duty to rule righteously brings  
on the destruction of the line and  
provides a exemplary lesson for hearers  
of the poem.
