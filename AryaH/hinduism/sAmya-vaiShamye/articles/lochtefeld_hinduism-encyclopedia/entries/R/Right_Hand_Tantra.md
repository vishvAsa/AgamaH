title = "Right Hand Tantra"

+++
Name for a type of **tantra**, a secret, ritually based religious practice. Certain  
tantric rituals make use of substances  
that are normally forbidden, such as  
**liquor** and nonvegetarian food, in an  
effort to unify the world by destroying all  
conceptual dualities, including that  
between sacred and forbidden. These  
substances are used in their actual  
forms in “left hand” (**vamachara**) tantric  
ritual, and by substitution in “right  
hand” (**dakshinachara**) tantric ritual.  
See **dakshinachara**.
