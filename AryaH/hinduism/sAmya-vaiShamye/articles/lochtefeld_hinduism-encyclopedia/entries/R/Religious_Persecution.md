title = "Religious Persecution"

+++
In popular belief India is visualized as a  
land of perfect religious tolerance in  
which all schools of thought have been  
allowed to grow unchecked. Although  
true in its basic form, this picture is  
greatly simplified. There is a long history  
of competition between differing religious communities and schools of  
thought, sometimes fueled by scathing  
polemics designed to persuade listeners  
that one was correct and the others  
false. What has been quite rare, however,  
are acts of violence accompanying these  
arguments, or the notion that people  
should have to fear for their lives  
because of their ideas. In the literature  
of the **Nayanar** and **Lingayat** communities—both devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**—language toward the Jains has a  
genuinely hostile edge, and the Nayanar  
leader **Sambandar** has been persistently  
implicated in the **impalement** of 8,000  
Jains in the southern Indian city of  
**Madurai**. In the same way, the northern  
Indian king **Sashanka**, who was also a  
devotee of Shiva, harbored a pathological hatred of Buddhists. Sashanka  
reportedly not only persecuted  
Buddhists themselves, but also tried  
to destroy the tree in Bodh **Gaya**  
under which the Buddha purportedly  
gained enlightenment.  
Sectarian competition aside, people  
whose religious faith has led them to  
ignore generally accepted social conventions have been quite likely to  
encounter stiff opposition. Stories of the  
devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saints are  
replete with tales of the troubles they  
faced from guardians of conventional  
morality, usually said to be **brahmins**. In  
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries  
there was a running and often bloody  
conflict between two groups of militant  
ascetics—the **Naga** class of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, and the **Bairagi**  
**Nagas**—although in that case the  
motives might just as well have been  
economic, namely, the control of trade  
in the **Ganges** valley. A final example of  
religious persecution appears in the rise  
of **Hindutva** in the 1980s. Propelled by  
verbal attacks on Muslims and  
Christians, this persecution has all too  
often prompted physical violence.
