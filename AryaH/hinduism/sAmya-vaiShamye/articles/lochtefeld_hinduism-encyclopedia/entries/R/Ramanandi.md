title = "Ramanandi"

+++
Renunciant ascetics, devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Vishnu**, who are by far the  
most numerous and most influential of  
the **Vaishnava** ascetics. The Ramanandis  
claim that their order was founded by  
the religious teacher **Ramananda**, about  
whom little is definitely known. For  
some time the Ramanandis maintained  
that Ramananda had been a disciple of the  
southern Indian philosopher **Ramanuja**,  
and thus that their sect had sprung out  
of Ramanuja’s **Shrivaishnava** religious  
community, but this claim was formally renounced after a dispute at the  
**Kumbha Mela** festival in the city of  
**Ujjain** in 1921. Ramananda is also traditionally thought to have been the  
**guru** of many northern Indian **bhakti**  
figures, most notably **Kabir**, **Ravidas**,  
**Pipa**, and **Sen**, although on this matter  
too there is little hard historical evidence.

Ramanandi  
All of the stories about Ramananda,  
however, point to someone who was  
firm in his commitment to devotion and  
was willing to initiate people from all  
walks of society.  
The tutelary **deity** for the Ramanandi  
ascetics is **Rama**, particularly as described  
in the **Ramcharitmanas**, a vernacular version of the epic **Ramayana** written by  
the poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623?).  
Tulsidas portrays Rama as God incarnate, come to **earth** for the benefit of his  
devotees, and the text’s primary theme  
is on the power of devotion. Yet within  
the larger confines of the Ramanandi  
fold there are several distinct variations  
on practice, which have little or nothing  
in common with one another. One  
strand is that of the **tyagis**, who stress  
renunciation and **asceticism**. A second  
strand is that of the **Nagas**, who in earlier times were fighting ascetics but  
whose military organization is now  
important only during the bathing  
(**snana**) processions for the Kumbha  
Mela. The final strand is that of the  
**rasiks** (“aesthetes”), whose religious  
practice is based on highly complex  
patterns of visualization in which they  
imagine themselves as present in the  
court of Rama itself; this sort of visualization was undoubtedly imitated  
from the patterns of **Krishna** devotion  
as practiced in the **Braj** region. The  
rasik tradition is by far the most literate and sophisticated; the tyagis and  
the Nagas perform similar sorts of rites  
as other ascetics, although their interpretation and their chosen deity is  
unique to their order. For further
