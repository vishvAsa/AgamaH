title = "Ranade, Mahadev Govind"

+++
(1842â€“1901) Lawyer, judge, and one of  
the great Hindu social reformers of  
nineteenth-century India. Along with  
his younger contemporary, **Gopal**  
**Krishna Gokhale**, Ranade was marked  
by his commitment to reform Hindu life  
by seeking the cooperation of the British  
government and by working within  
established institutions. Ranade was  
among the first generation of Indians to  
be educated in British schools and, after  
earning his degree at Bombay  
University, chose a career in law. In thirty  
years as a judge Ranade worked diligently to reform certain religious practices that were deemed social abuses,  
particularly issues concerning child  
marriage and **widow** remarriage. He was  
also a founding member of the  
**Prarthana Samaj**, a Hindu reformist  
organization that sought to attain similar goals. In addition to his interests in  
law, Ranade applied himself to the study  
of economics, to provide practical guidance for economic development.
