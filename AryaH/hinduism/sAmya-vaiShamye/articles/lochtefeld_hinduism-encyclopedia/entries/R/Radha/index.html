  <meta property="og:description" content="In later devotional (bhakti) literature,
Radha is the woman portrayed as the
god Krishna’s lover and companion.
Radha’s love for Krishna is a symbol of
the soul’s hunger for union with the
divine, expressed through the poetic
conventions of erotic love.
Although a few references to Radha
in poetry date back to the seventh century, her first developed portrayal is in
Jayadeva’s lyric poem the Gitagovinda,
written around the twelfth century. The
Gitagovinda tells the story of Radha and
Krishna’s passion, their conflict and separation, and their eventual reconciliation. Jayadeva’s portrayal of Radha is
unique. In the poem Radha wishes to
have Krishna all to herself, as his sole
lover and companion. She sulks jealously
when he flirts with other women and
angrily dismisses him when he comes to
her marked with the signs of another
tryst. In the end, however, they reconcile
and make passionate love as a symbol of
their union.
This picture of love, separation, and
reunion between Radha and Krishna
gains a sharper focus through the context set by Jayadeva’s hymn Dashavatara
Stotra. In it Jayadeva lists the achievements of Krishna’s ten incarnations
(avatars) immediately after the text’s
introductory verses. The concluding
verses of the hymn explicitly refer to
Krishna as the ultimate source of the
ten avatars, reminding hearers that the
person taking part in this drama of
jealousy, repentance, and reconciliation is none other than the Lord of the
Universe Himself, who in ages past has
acted to preserve the world from
destruction. Unlike earlier depictions
of Krishna in which his connections
with his devotees (bhakta) are portrayed as a form of “play” (lila), the
Krishna found in the Gitagovinda
seems less lofty and detached, more
intimately and intensely involved with
Radha as the object of his affection.
The poem renders Krishna as one who
feels emotions deeply and truly and
meaningfully reciprocates the feelings
of his devotee.
Jayadeva’s poetic focus is on the
inner dynamic between the two lovers,
and he reveals little about Radha outside
this relationship. In the time after the
Gitagovinda, Radha’s character developed in various ways. Some poets
describe her as married to another man,
thus giving Radha’s trysts with Krishna
the color of adulterous, forbidden love.
This love is considered more intense in
Indian poetics, since the lovers have
nothing to gain from the liaison but the
love itself and stand to lose everything
should they be discovered. Here Radha
stands as the symbol of one willing to
risk and lose all for the sake of love itself.
The other way in which Radha’s character is developed runs contrary to this
adulterous portrayal. In some traditions
Radha is not drawn as a simple woman
consumed with love for Krishna, but as
his wife, consort, and divine power
(shakti), through whose agency Krishna
is able to act in the world. This deified
image of Radha was particularly important for the Nimbarka religious community, which conceived of Radha and
Krishna as forms of Lakshmi and
Narayana. Another group espousing
this equality was the Radhavallabh
community, whose members particularly
stressed the love Krishna felt for Radha.
For further information about Radha,
see Barbara Stoller Miller (ed. and
trans.), The Love Song of the Dark Lord,
1977; and David R. Kinsley, Hindu

  <div id="post_content">
  <p>In later devotional (<strong>bhakti</strong>) literature,<br>
Radha is the woman portrayed as the<br>
god <strong>Krishna’s</strong> lover and companion.<br>
Radha’s love for Krishna is a symbol of<br>
the soul’s hunger for union with the<br>
divine, expressed through the poetic<br>
conventions of <strong>erotic</strong> love.<br>
Although a few references to Radha<br>
in poetry date back to the seventh century, her first developed portrayal is in<br>
<strong>Jayadeva’s</strong> lyric poem the <strong>Gitagovinda,</strong><br>
written around the twelfth century. The<br>
<em>Gitagovinda</em> tells the story of Radha and<br>
Krishna’s passion, their conflict and separation, and their eventual reconciliation. Jayadeva’s portrayal of Radha is<br>
unique. In the poem Radha wishes to<br>
have Krishna all to herself, as his sole<br>
lover and companion. She sulks jealously<br>
when he flirts with other women and<br>
angrily dismisses him when he comes to<br>
her marked with the signs of another<br>
tryst. In the end, however, they reconcile<br>
and make passionate love as a symbol of<br>
their union.<br>
This picture of love, separation, and<br>
reunion between Radha and Krishna<br>
gains a sharper focus through the context set by Jayadeva’s hymn <strong>Dashavatara</strong><br>
<strong>Stotra</strong>. In it Jayadeva lists the achievements of Krishna’s ten incarnations<br>
(<strong>avatars</strong>) immediately after the text’s<br>
introductory verses. The concluding<br>
verses of the hymn explicitly refer to<br>
Krishna as the ultimate source of the<br>
ten avatars, reminding hearers that the<br>
person taking part in this drama of<br>
jealousy, repentance, and reconciliation is none other than the Lord of the<br>
Universe Himself, who in ages past has<br>
acted to preserve the world from<br>
destruction. Unlike earlier depictions<br>
of Krishna in which his connections<br>
with his devotees (<strong>bhakta</strong>) are portrayed as a form of “play” (<strong>lila</strong>), the<br>
Krishna found in the <em>Gitagovinda</em><br>
seems less lofty and detached, more<br>
intimately and intensely involved with<br>
Radha as the object of his affection.<br>
The poem renders Krishna as one who<br>
feels emotions deeply and truly and<br>
meaningfully reciprocates the feelings<br>
of his devotee.<br>
Jayadeva’s poetic focus is on the<br>
inner dynamic between the two lovers,<br>
and he reveals little about Radha outside<br>
this relationship. In the time after the<br>
<em>Gitagovinda</em>, Radha’s character developed in various ways. Some poets<br>
describe her as married to another man,<br>
thus giving Radha’s trysts with Krishna<br>
the color of adulterous, forbidden love.<br>
This love is considered more intense in<br>
Indian poetics, since the lovers have<br>
nothing to gain from the liaison but the<br>
love itself and stand to lose everything<br>
should they be discovered. Here Radha<br>
stands as the symbol of one willing to<br>
risk and lose all for the sake of love itself.<br>
The other way in which Radha’s character is developed runs contrary to this<br>
adulterous portrayal. In some traditions<br>
Radha is not drawn as a simple woman<br>
consumed with love for Krishna, but as<br>
his wife, consort, and divine power<br>
(<strong>shakti</strong>), through whose agency Krishna<br>
is able to act in the world. This deified<br>
image of Radha was particularly important for the <strong>Nimbarka</strong> religious community, which conceived of Radha and<br>
Krishna as forms of <strong>Lakshmi</strong> and<br>
<strong>Narayana</strong>. Another group espousing<br>
this equality was the <strong>Radhavallabh</strong><br>
community, whose members particularly<br>
stressed the love Krishna felt for Radha.<br>
For further information about Radha,<br>

trans.), <em>The Love Song of the Dark Lord</em>,<br>
1977; and David R. Kinsley, <em>Hindu</em><br>
