title = "Rock Edicts"

+++
Name for a set of **inscriptions** commissioned by the Mauryan emperor **Ashoka**  
(r. 269â€“32 B.C.E.). The inscriptions were  
official pronouncements on royal policy,  
and advice and instructions to his subjects on a variety of topics, including  
religious tolerance. In general, the rock  
edicts were carved into large boulders or  
rock faces in places that would have  
been at the borders of the Mauryan  
Empire, thus symbolically defining its  
boundaries. The text was fairly consistent throughout the empire, even  
though different examples of these  
edicts were found in widely separated  
places. The other major class of Ashokan  
inscriptions, the **pillar edicts**, were  
inscribed on pillars of polished **Chunar**  
sandstone and set up on the major  
roads running through the empire,  
where they would have been visible to  
passersby. See also **Maurya dynasty**.
