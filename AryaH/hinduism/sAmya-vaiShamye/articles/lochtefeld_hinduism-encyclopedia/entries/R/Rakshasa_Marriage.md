title = "Rakshasa Marriage"

+++
One of the eight ways to perform a marriage recognized in the **dharma literature**, the treatises on religious duty. The  
**rakshasas** are a class of **demon**, and the  
rakshasa form of marriage took place  
when a man had intercourse with a  
woman after carrying her away by force.  
Not surprisingly, this was one of the four  
reprehensible (**aprashasta**) forms of  
marriage and was forbidden because of  
the woman’s lack of consent, even  
though it was deemed a valid marriage.  
(Here the writers’ concern seems to have  
been to give the “bride” legal status as a  
wife rather than to legitimate the actions  
of the “groom.”) Theoretically valid, this  
form of marriage has been forbidden  
since the dharma literature was first  
codified in the centuries before the  
common era. Although the rakshasa  
marriage has never been one of the  
accepted forms of marriage, there are  
groups in which a ritualized battle and  
capture of the bride is part of the wedding ceremony. One could even interpret the **barat**, the procession of the  
groom and his family to the wedding  
location, as a ritualized triumphal entry  
following conquest. See also **marriage,**  
**eight classical forms**, **marriage ceremonies**, and **marriage prohibitions**.
