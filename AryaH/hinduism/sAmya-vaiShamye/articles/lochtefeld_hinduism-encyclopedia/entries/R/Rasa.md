(“tastes”) In Indian aesthetics, the nine  
moods that can be generated in an audience by various types of artistic expression: **erotic**, comic, compassionate,  
cruel, heroic, terrifying, loathsome,  
marvelous, and peaceful. These nine  
rasas correspond to the nine **bhavas**  
(“states”): sexual excitement, laughter,  
grief, anger, energy, fear, loathing, wonder, and peace. The nine bhavas are  
considered to be the most basic unadulterated emotions, and although each of  
the rasas corresponds to one of the  
bhavas, there is an important difference.  
Human emotive states come and go in  
response to circumstances largely  
beyond our control. Such emotive states  
often cannot be sustained, and they are  
generally not objects of aesthetic satisfaction. The case is very different for an  
aesthetic mood (rasa), which can be sustained, since it is artificially generated  
through artistic expression. This  
emphasis on creating and sustaining  
such a mood for an audience is the  
dominant goal of the performing arts in  
the Hindu tradition.
