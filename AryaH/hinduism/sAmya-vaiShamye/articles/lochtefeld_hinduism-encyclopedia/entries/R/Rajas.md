(“passion”) One of the three fundamental qualities (**gunas**) believed to be present in all things, the other two gunas  
being **sattva** (“goodness”) and **tamas**  
(“darkness”). According to this model,  
differing proportions of these qualities  
account for differences in the properties  
of concrete things, and in the range of  
individual human capacities and tendencies. Unlike sattva and tamas, which,  
respectively, carry exclusively good and  
bad associations, rajas and its effects can  
be either positive or negative, depending  
on context. Rajas is negative, for example,  
when it leads to an enslavement to the

passions that may blind one to careful  
and conscious thought. Alternately, the  
energies derived from passion can also  
engender useful activity and industriousness. The notion of the gunas originated in the metaphysics of the  
**Samkhya** school, one of the **six schools**  
of traditional Hindu philosophy, and  
although much of Samkhya metaphysics connected with the gunas has  
long been discredited, the idea of the  
gunas and their qualities has become a  
pervasive assumption in Indian culture.
