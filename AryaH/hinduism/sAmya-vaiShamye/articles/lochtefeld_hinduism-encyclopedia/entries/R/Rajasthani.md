One of the two influential “schools” of  
Indian **miniature painting**, the other  
being the **Pahari**. Distinctions between  
the two schools are largely geographical  
and thus somewhat arbitrary, since the  
547  
Rajasthani  
A miniature painting in the  
Rajasthani style, circa 1730.  
**Basohli** paintings of the Pahari school  
are stylistically closer to those of  
**Rajasthan** than to works in the later  
Pahari style.  
The Rajasthani was the earliest  
developed school; it flourished in the  
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in  
the small kingdoms of the **Malwa** region  
such as **Mandu**, and in the kingdoms  
that now comprise regions in modern  
Rajasthan—particularly **Bundi**, **Kota**,  
and **Mewar**, but also Jaipur and  
Bikaner. The Rajasthani style is generally characterized by a flat perspective  
and by visual power derived from vivid  
colors, bands of which often serve as a  
backdrop to the painting. For further  
information see W. G. Archer, *Indian*  
*Painting*, 1957.
