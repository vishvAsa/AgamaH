Festival falling on the **full moon**  
in the **lunar month** of **Magh** (January–  
569  
Ravidas Jayanti  
February), celebrated as the birthday of  
the medieval **bhakti** poet-saint **Ravidas**,  
born near **Benares**. Ravidas’s birth into  
the **untouchable caste** of **leather** workers (**chamar**) afforded him a very low  
social status. His poetry is set in a personal voice and contrasts this lowly status with the honor and renown he  
gained through his devotion to God. In  
modern times many members of the  
depressed classes see Ravidas as a  
model, and his birthday is celebrated  
with great fervor.
