title = "Ramana Maharishi"

+++
(1879–1950) Modern Hindu sage, whose  
life and message reiterated the fundamental insight of the ancient speculative **Upanishads**, namely, that the inner  
Self (**atman**) is identical with Supreme  
Reality (**Brahman**). Ramana was born  
into a middle-class Indian family and  
during his youth demonstrated no  
unusual abilities. In 1895 he obtained a  
copy of the **Periya Puranam**, a text  
chronicling the lives of the poet-saints  
known as the **Nayanars**, and in reading  
about their lives Ramana began to desire  
to renounce the world. This inclination  
was realized the next year, when he  
imagined the death of his body and  
reached the conclusion that his real  
identity was the Self. He left his family  
and went to the temple of **Tiruvannamalai**, also known as Arunachala,  
where he remained until his death fiftyfour years later. For some time at the  
start he was deep in meditation and  
barely attended to his physical needs.  
Soon he attracted disciples, through  
whom his family eventually discovered  
his whereabouts, although Ramana  
refused to return home with them when  
they came to see him. His mother  
moved to Tiruvannamalai in 1916, and  
after her death five years later Ramana  
relocated his dwelling to be near her  
grave. Although he spoke very seldom,  
he managed to compose two short  
works—*Self-Enquiry* and *Who am I?*—in  
which he stated his basic insights. For

Mahadevan, *Ramana Maharshi*, 1977.
