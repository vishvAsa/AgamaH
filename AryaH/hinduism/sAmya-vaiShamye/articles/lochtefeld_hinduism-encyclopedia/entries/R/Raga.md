title = "Raga"

+++
In Indian music, a concrete melodic  
mode of at least five notes. Any musician  
playing a raga is limited by the constraints of its established form. The  
order of these established notes in the  
raga does not follow their musical order  
but differs according to whether the  
note sequence is ascending or descending. There are over 200 recognized ragas,  
but only about thirty are in general use.  
Each raga has very particular symbolic  
associations—particularly with the time  
of **day** or with the **seasons**—and is also  
believed to convey a particular aesthetic  
mood (**rasa**) to listeners. As in all the  
Indian arts, the musician who plays a  
raga endeavors to convey a certain  
mood to an audience and to awaken  
corresponding feelings within them.
