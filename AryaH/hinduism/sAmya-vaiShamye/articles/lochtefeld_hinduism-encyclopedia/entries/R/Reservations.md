Modern government policy designed to  
rectify the long-standing economic and  
social disadvantages faced by certain  
poor or low-status groups by offering  
them preferential treatment in employment and education. This is usually  
done by setting aside, or “reserving,” for  
such groups certain percentages of

Reservations  
government jobs or places in institutions of higher learning, which admit  
people from disadvantaged communities under much lower standards than  
those for the general public. Those  
groups who qualify for such reservations  
are generally referred to as Scheduled  
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, after the  
“schedule” or official government list on  
which the names of these groups  
appear. The Scheduled Castes are lowstatus **caste** Hindus, who in earlier times  
would have been called **untouchables**,  
while the Scheduled Tribes are aboriginal peoples (**adivasis**), who mainly live  
in central India.  
Although the reservations policy has  
been implemented for some time, it  
remains a continual source of controversy. Proponents claim that it is moving  
socially disadvantaged people into  
the mainstream of Indian life and helping to correct centuries of injustice.  
Opponents decry the fact that lessqualified people are being deliberately  
chosen, making a mockery of the notion  
of merit. Critics also argue that the people who benefit the most from such policies are the best-off members of such  
communities—the so-called creamy  
layer, designating their position at the  
top—whereas the truly disadvantaged  
remain in the same positions as they  
have always been. Aside from the philosophical debates about this policy, it has  
had a recognizable impact on people’s  
livelihoods. Such reservations have  
made competition even more ferocious  
for the remaining spots, and made  
reservations a politically volatile issue.  
Given the benefits derived from reservations, there has also been considerable  
lobbying to include other, less-disadvantaged groups under its rubric, as a  
way to spread benefits to other sectors  
of Indian society.
