A. The Solar Line of Kings  
B. Rakshasas (Epic’s Antagonists)  
C. Monkey Lineages  
wish, Rama immediately prepares to  
leave, refusing to seize the throne by  
force, and Sita and Lakshmana  
announce their intention to accompany  
him. Bharata is put on the throne but  
only as a regent in Rama’s place, and the  
heart-broken Dasharatha dies of grief.  
In the Aranyakhanda (“Forest section”), Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita settle  
into life in forest exile. Rama and  
Lakshmana kill many of the **demons**  
(**rakshasas**) who plague the forestdwellers, thus bringing peace to the  
area. One day the female demon  
**Shurpanakha** comes to their dwelling,  
is smitten by the two young men, and  
asks them to marry her. The brothers  
first mock her, then mutilate her by cutting off her ears and nose. Shurpanakha  
goes to her brother **Ravana**, the demonking of **Lanka**, and demands revenge for  
the attack. When frontal assaults fail,  
Ravana commands his uncle **Maricha** to  
assume the form of a golden deer in  
order to lure Rama away from his hut. At  
Sita’s behest, Rama pursues the deer  
after giving Lakshmana strict orders not  
to leave Sita’s side. Rama slays the deer,  
which with its dying breath calls out  
Lakshmana’s name in a voice that mimics Rama’s. Sita hears the call and flies  
into a rage when Lakshmana refuses to  
leave her. She finally drives him off, in  
an uncharacteristic show of temper, by  
accusing him of neglecting his brother  
in a time of peril so that he can have Sita  
to himself. When Lakshmana departs,  
Ravana comes to Sita disguised as a  
mendicant **ascetic**. He lures her out of a  
protective **magic** circle that Lakshmana  
has drawn around her, then kidnaps her.  
Ravana’s escape is briefly delayed by a  
virtuous vulture named **Jatayu**, who  
attempts to rescue Sita. In the ensuing  
combat Jatayu is mortally wounded, but  
he lives long enough for Rama and  
Lakshmana to find him and learn the  
identity of Sita’s abductor.  
The Kishkindhakhanda (“**Kishkindha**  
section”) narrates Rama’s and Lakshmana’s trip south to the Kishkindha  
forest. There they become allies with  
the monkey-king **Sugriva**, whose lost  
kingdom Rama helps to regain by slaying Sugriva’s brother **Bali**. After enjoying the spoils of kingship, Sugriva and  
his monkey subjects, particularly his  
lieutenant **Hanuman**, begin searching  
throughout the country for any trace  
of Sita. Hanuman decides to leap over  
the sea, to Lanka, to see if he can find  
her there.  
The Sundarakhanda (“Beautiful section”) begins with Hanuman leaping the  
sea to Lanka and describes how, after  
much searching, he finally manages to  
locate Sita. Meanwhile, Ravana unsuccessfully tries to convince Sita to accept  
him as her husband. The demon’s  
actions are motivated by his desire  
to avoid a curse, which states that he  
will drop dead if he ever rapes a woman  
who resists him. Hanuman reassures  
Sita that all will be well, and after  
many adventures makes his way back  
to Rama, to inform him that Sita has  
been found.  
The Lankakhanda (“Lanka section”)  
describes the beginning of a war  
between the forces of Rama and Ravana.  
Aided by armies of monkeys and bears,  
Rama builds a causeway across the sea  
to Lanka and begins to besiege the city.  
In his struggle he is helped by Ravana’s  
youngest brother **Vibhishana**, who  
opposes Ravana’s evil deeds and casts in  
his lot with Rama. Ravana is assisted by  
his brother **Kumbhakarna** and his son  
**Indrajit**, but in the end Ravana and his  
demon allies are killed in battle. After  
being rescued, Sita undergoes a trial by  
**fire** to prove her chastity, and when the  
fire refuses to burn her, she is shown to  
have been completely faithful to Rama.  
They return in triumph to Ayodhya,  
where Bharata renounces the throne,  
and the couple rule happily.  
In the “Final section” (Uttarakhanda),  
which was almost certainly added later,  
Rama has further doubts about Sita’s  
virtue. While roaming the capital one  
night, he hears a washerman abusing  
his wife for staying out all night. The  
washerman says that he is not as big a  
fool as their king. Rama is troubled by  
this and, although he is supposedly  
557  
Ramayana  
convinced of Sita’s innocence, sends her  
into exile to please his subjects—here  
showing a distrust uncharacteristic of a  
figure who supposedly represents the  
epitome of virtue. While in exile, Sita  
gives birth to twin sons, **Lava** and  
**Kusha**, whose prowess makes them  
known to Rama, and they are eventually  
acknowledged as his heirs. Yet after all  
her suffering, Sita is not amenable to  
reconciliation. As a final proof she calls  
on her mother, the **Earth**, to bear witness to her virtue, and as a sign that this  
is true Sita sinks beneath the earth,  
never to be seen again. Soon after, Rama  
himself leaves his body and takes again  
his true form as Vishnu.  
The *Ramayana* has been an extremely  
influential text, primarily because of the  
social virtues modeled by its characters.  
The epic is known throughout the subcontinent, and its popularity can be  
seen by its numerous retellings in vernacular languages, of which the most  
famous are the Tamil *Ramayana* of  
the poet **Kamban** (9th c.), and the  
**Ramcharitmanas** of the poetsaint **Tulsidas** (17th c.). The epic  
continues to be a prominent text in  
the modern day, as witnessed by its  
astounding popularity as a weekly television serial produced in the mid-1980s  
under the direction of **Ramanand**  
**Sagar**. The Valmiki *Ramayana* has been  
translated numerous times, the most  
recent partial translation of the work is  
by Robert Goldman and Sheldon  
Pollack. See also **Tamil epics**.
