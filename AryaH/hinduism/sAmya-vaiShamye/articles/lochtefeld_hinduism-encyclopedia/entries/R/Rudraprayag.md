+++
Himalayan town and sacred site (**tirtha**)  
at the junction of the **Mandakini** and  
**Alakananda** rivers, two Himalayan tributaries of the **Ganges** River. As with all the  
other river junctions in the **Garhwal**  
region, Rudraprayag is considered an  
especially holy place for bathing (**snana**),  
although the raging currents make it  
dangerous. Above the junction of the  
rivers is a temple to **Shiva** in his form as  
**Rudra**. According to local tradition, this  
marked the place where the sage **Narada**  
performed physical **asceticism** (**tapas**) to  
gain his skill as a bard. Shiva, pleased  
with Naradaâ€™s efforts, instructed Narada  
in music and remained at the spot.
