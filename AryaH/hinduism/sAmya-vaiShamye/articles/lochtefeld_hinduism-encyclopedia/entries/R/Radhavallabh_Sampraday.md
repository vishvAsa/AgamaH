title = "Radhavallabh Sampraday"

+++
Religious community whose members  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**  
(that is, **Vaishnavas**), and whose founder  
was the sixteenth-century poet-saint  
**Harivamsh**. Harivamsh held distinctive  
views on the status of **Radha**, which his  
community has preserved. Whereas  
earlier poetry had often portrayed  
Radha as the god **Krishna’s** adulterous  
mistress, the Radhavallabhans conceive  
of her as his lawful wife and as a **deity**  
whose status was equal with Krishna’s.  
Their devotion was focused on Krishna  
and on his status as the “beloved of  
Radha” (Radhavallabh).
