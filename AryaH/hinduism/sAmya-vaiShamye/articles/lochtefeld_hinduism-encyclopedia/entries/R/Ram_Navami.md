title = "Ram Navami"

+++
Festival celebrated on the ninth day of  
the bright (waxing) half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Chaitra** (March–April). Ram  
Navami is celebrated as the birthday of  
the god **Rama**, the seventh **avatar** of the  
god **Vishnu**, and this festival also ends  
the spring **Navaratri** festival of the  
**Goddess**. The Goddess festival of  
Navaratri, observed twice yearly in the  
spring and in the fall, ends each time  
with a celebration for Rama. The reason  
for this festival sequence is not entirely  
clear but probably reflects cultural  
imperatives to contain the explosive but  
uncontrolled fertile feminine energy  
personified by the Goddess with the stable and predictable masculine energy of  
Rama. Ram Navami is widely celebrated  
across India, but especially in **Ayodhya**,  
the city traditionally deemed his birthplace. In their celebrations, devotees  
(**bhakta**) may **worship** in their homes,  
fast (**upavasa**), attend religious discourses (**katha**), or go to temples for  
**darshan** and worship. With the recent  
growth of **Hindutva** (militant, politicized Hinduism) this holiday has  
become a day for large demonstrations  
and political action. This has been  
particularly true in Ayodhya, where the  
continuing struggle to build the **Ram**  
**Janam Bhumi** temple at the site of  
Rama’s birthplace has made this day  
particularly significant.
