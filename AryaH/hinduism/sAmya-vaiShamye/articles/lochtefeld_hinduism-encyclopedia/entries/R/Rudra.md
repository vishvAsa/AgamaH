title = "Rudra"

+++
(“howler”) Fearsome **deity** who first  
appears late in the **Vedas**, the oldest  
Hindu religious texts, later identified  
with the god **Shiva**. Several hymns in the  
**Rg Veda** are dedicated to Rudra, where  
he is identified with the storm-god  
**Indra**, and the fire-god **Agni**. A more  
developed picture of Rudra appears in  
the **Shvetashvatara Upanishad**, one of  
the later speculative texts known as the  
**Upanishads**. In the third chapter  
(adhyaya) of this text, Rudra is identified  
as the ruling power in the universe and  
the source and origin of the gods themselves. Rudra’s depiction in this upanishad shows considerable ambivalence,  
both mentioning the destructive arrows  
that he bears and imploring him to  
appear in a form that is auspicious  
(shivam) and peaceful. This ambivalence  
perhaps reflects the religious tension  
associated with the figure of Shiva, who  
was a deity outside the Vedic sacrificial  
cult but was gradually absorbed into  
established religion and is now one of  
the primary Hindu deities.
