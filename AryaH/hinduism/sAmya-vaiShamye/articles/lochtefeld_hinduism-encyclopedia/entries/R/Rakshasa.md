title = "Rakshasa"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a particular type of  
asura (**demon**). Rakshasas are generally  
considered to be extremely powerful—  
not only in terms of their prodigious  
physical strength but also in their considerable skill in the magical arts. They  
are also generally characterized as  
malevolent toward human beings,  
whom they not only kill but also eat.  
According to one myth, rakshasas are  
born from **Brahma’s** anger when he  
becomes hungry while reciting the  
**Vedas**. The capital of the rakshasas is in  
**Lanka**, and their most celebrated leader  
is **Ravana**, whose death at the hands of  
**Rama** is the climax of the **Ramayana**,  
the earlier of the two great Hindu epics.
