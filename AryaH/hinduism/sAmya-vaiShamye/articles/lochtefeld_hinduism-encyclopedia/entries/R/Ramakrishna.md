title = "Ramakrishna"

+++
(1836–86) Bengali mystic and saint who  
was one of the most remarkable figures  
in the nineteenth-century revival of  
Hinduism. Ramakrishna was the son of  
a village priest and received little formal  
education during his life. He retained  
much of his rustic simplicity and spent  
his adult life as a temple priest at the  
**Kali** temple at **Dakshineshwar**, outside  
the city of Calcutta. From his childhood  
Ramakrishna had been devoted to the  
**Goddess** Kali, and characterized himself as being “intoxicated with God.”  
He sought and found the divine, first  
through Kali but later through a variety  
of other religious paths, including the  
abstract monism of the speculative  
**Upanishads**, devotion to the god  
**Vishnu**, Christianity, and Islam. Out of  
these experiences came his conviction  
that the inner experience in all religious traditions was the same and led to  
the same divine presence. Although  
Ramakrishna did not publicize himself,  
he became known in Calcutta’s religious  
circles through his association with  
**Keshub Chander Sen**, the leader of the  
reformist **Brahmo Samaj**. This association brought him disciples who would  
spread his teachings, particularly  
Narendranath Datta, better known as  
**Swami Vivekananda**. For a devotee’s  
perspective on Ramakrishna, see  
Christopher Isherwood, *Ramakrishna*  
*and His Disciples*, 1965; for a modern  
psychological reading, see Jeffrey Kripal,  
*Kali’s Child*, 1995.
