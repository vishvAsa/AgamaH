title = "Reciprocal Dependence"

+++
In Indian logic, one of the **fallacies** to  
be avoided in constructing an argument. Reciprocal dependence occurs  
when two things each stand as cause  
and effect to the otherâ€”when A depends  
on B, and B in turn depends on A. This  
is seen as an extended case of **selfresidence**, and equally objectionable.
