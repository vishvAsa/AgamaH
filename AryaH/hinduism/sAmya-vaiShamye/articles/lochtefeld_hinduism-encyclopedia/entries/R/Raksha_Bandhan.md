title = "Raksha Bandhan"

+++
Festival **day** celebrated on the **full moon**  
in the **lunar month** of **Shravan**  
(July–August); this festival’s theme is the  
bond of protection (raksha) between  
brother and sister. On this day sisters tie  
(bandhan) a string around the brother’s  
right wrist, which is sometimes just a  
simple thread and sometimes an elaborately constructed ornamental bracelet.  
Sisters then mark a tilak (**tika**) on the  
brother’s forehead as a sign of respect  
and feed their brothers sweets. For their  
part, brothers give their sisters money,  
clothing, jewelry, or other gifts.  
As with the festival of **Bhaiya Duj**,  
Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the protective bond between brothers and sisters.  
In the long term, brothers are seen as  
the family members who will protect  
their sisters’ interests—since in many  
cases daughters long outlive their  
fathers and their brothers are the natal  
relatives on whom they must depend.  
Sisters perform these rites to protect

Raksha Bandhan  
their brothers from misfortune—the  
string tied around the wrist is believed  
to ward off evil. The festival of Raksha  
Bandhan is also performed by men and  
**women** who are not related by blood but  
who are close to one another. Tying on  
the string “makes” them brother and sister, and thus rules out the potential for  
any romantic involvement, which would  
be seen as a form of incest.
