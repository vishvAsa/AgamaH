title = "Ramdevra"

+++
Village and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
northwest corner of the state of  
**Rajasthan**, about sixty miles east of the  
city of Jaisalmer. Ramdevra is famous for  
the grave of the fifteenth-century saint  
**Ramdev**, as well as the grave of his low**caste** disciple Dadi Bhai. During his lifetime Ramdev was famous for his piety  
and generosity, and was credited with  
performing various miracles to aid those  
in need. Since his death he has come to  
be regarded as an incarnation of the god  
**Krishna**. Although pilgrims can come  
throughout the **year**, most come during  
the annual religious fair (**mela**), at which  
time the near-deserted town takes on  
the semblance of a bustling city. Many  
of the visitors come to ask Ramdev  
for something, often related to  
concerns over health or prosperity.  
Others come to show gratitude, especially those whose past wishes have  
been granted, and to maintain their  
relationship with him.
