title = "Rudra Sampraday"

+++
One of the four branches (**sampraday**) of  
the **Bairagi Naga** ascetics. The name  
*Bairagi* denotes ascetics who are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**. The name  
*Naga* describes a class of fighting ascetics  
recruited to protect the other Bairagi  
ascetics who, because they were saintly,  
scholarly men, could not protect themselves. Bairagi Nagas were organized in  
military fashion into different **anis** or  
“armies.” Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the Nagas’ primary occupation was as mercenary soldiers,  
although they also had substantial trading interests. The Nagas lent money at  
interest, engaged in trade, and often  
owned large amounts of property. They  
were particularly powerful in parts of the  
country where the centralized government had broken down. Their roles as  
mercenaries and in trade have both largely disappeared in contemporary times.  
The Rudra Sampraday traces its spiritual lineage through the philosopher  
**Vallabhacharya** and the earlier religious  
teacher, **Vishnuswami**. The followers of  
Vallabhacharya tend to be householders  
rather than ascetics; Vallabhacharya  
himself was married and had many children. It is the smallest and least important of the Bairagi Naga sampradays,  
and the only event at which it figures is  
the bathing (**snana**) processions at the  
**Kumbha Mela**.
