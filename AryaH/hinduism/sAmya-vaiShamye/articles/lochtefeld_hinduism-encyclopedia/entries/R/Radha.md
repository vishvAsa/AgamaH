title = "Radha"

+++
In later devotional (**bhakti**) literature,  
Radha is the woman portrayed as the  
god **Krishna’s** lover and companion.  
Radha’s love for Krishna is a symbol of  
the soul’s hunger for union with the  
divine, expressed through the poetic  
conventions of **erotic** love.  
Although a few references to Radha  
in poetry date back to the seventh century, her first developed portrayal is in  
**Jayadeva’s** lyric poem the **Gitagovinda,**  
written around the twelfth century. The  
*Gitagovinda* tells the story of Radha and  
Krishna’s passion, their conflict and separation, and their eventual reconciliation. Jayadeva’s portrayal of Radha is  
unique. In the poem Radha wishes to  
have Krishna all to herself, as his sole  
lover and companion. She sulks jealously  
when he flirts with other women and  
angrily dismisses him when he comes to  
her marked with the signs of another  
tryst. In the end, however, they reconcile  
and make passionate love as a symbol of  
their union.  
This picture of love, separation, and  
reunion between Radha and Krishna  
gains a sharper focus through the context set by Jayadeva’s hymn **Dashavatara**  
**Stotra**. In it Jayadeva lists the achievements of Krishna’s ten incarnations  
(**avatars**) immediately after the text’s  
introductory verses. The concluding  
verses of the hymn explicitly refer to  
Krishna as the ultimate source of the  
ten avatars, reminding hearers that the  
person taking part in this drama of  
jealousy, repentance, and reconciliation is none other than the Lord of the  
Universe Himself, who in ages past has  
acted to preserve the world from  
destruction. Unlike earlier depictions  
of Krishna in which his connections  
with his devotees (**bhakta**) are portrayed as a form of “play” (**lila**), the  
Krishna found in the *Gitagovinda*  
seems less lofty and detached, more  
intimately and intensely involved with  
Radha as the object of his affection.  
The poem renders Krishna as one who  
feels emotions deeply and truly and  
meaningfully reciprocates the feelings  
of his devotee.  
Jayadeva’s poetic focus is on the  
inner dynamic between the two lovers,  
and he reveals little about Radha outside  
this relationship. In the time after the  
*Gitagovinda*, Radha’s character developed in various ways. Some poets  
describe her as married to another man,  
thus giving Radha’s trysts with Krishna  
the color of adulterous, forbidden love.  
This love is considered more intense in  
Indian poetics, since the lovers have  
nothing to gain from the liaison but the  
love itself and stand to lose everything  
should they be discovered. Here Radha  
stands as the symbol of one willing to  
risk and lose all for the sake of love itself.  
The other way in which Radha’s character is developed runs contrary to this  
adulterous portrayal. In some traditions  
Radha is not drawn as a simple woman  
consumed with love for Krishna, but as  
his wife, consort, and divine power  
(**shakti**), through whose agency Krishna  
is able to act in the world. This deified  
image of Radha was particularly important for the **Nimbarka** religious community, which conceived of Radha and  
Krishna as forms of **Lakshmi** and  
**Narayana**. Another group espousing  
this equality was the **Radhavallabh**  
community, whose members particularly  
stressed the love Krishna felt for Radha.
