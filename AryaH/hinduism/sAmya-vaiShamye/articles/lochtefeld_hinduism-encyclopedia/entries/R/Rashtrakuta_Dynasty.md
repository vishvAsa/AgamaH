title = "Rashtrakuta Dynasty"

+++
(8th–10th c.) Central Indian dynasty  
whose core area was in the middle of  
**Maharashtra**, and whose capital was  
the Maharashtrian city of Achalpur. The  
**Rashtrakutas** were originally vassals of  
the **Chalukya dynasty**, but overthrew  
them in the middle of the eighth century  
and remained the premier power south  
of the **Vindhya Mountains** until the  
middle of the tenth century. The dynasty  
directly ruled most of the modern states  
of Maharashtra and **Karnataka**, along  
with parts of the states of **Andhra**  
**Pradesh** and **Tamil Nadu**, but had vassal  
states through the entire **Deccan**  
plateau, southern India, and Ceylon.  
Their hegemony ended in 973, when  
they were overthrown by the later  
Chalukya dynasty. The Rashtrakutas’  
greatest monument is the **Kailasanatha**  
temple at **Ellora** in the state of  
Maharashtra, which was completed late  
in the eighth century.
