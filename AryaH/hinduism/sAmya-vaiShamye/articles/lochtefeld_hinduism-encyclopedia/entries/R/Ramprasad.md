title = "Ramprasad"

+++
(early 19th c.) Bengali poet-saint and  
devotee (**bhakta**) of the **goddess Kali**,  
who is justly renowned for the power  
562  
Ramnagar  
and expressive quality of his poems. As  
with many of the devotional (**bhakti**)  
figures, little is definitely known about  
his life. According to tradition, he  
worked for a short time as a clerk before  
his indulgent employer, finding him  
spending his days composing poetry to  
Kali, became his literary patron to allow  
him to write full time. Ramprasad’s  
poetry invokes the Goddess in many of  
her different personae—as the goddesses  
**Uma**, **Durga**, and **Bhairavi**—but the  
majority of his poems are addressed to  
Kali. Despite Kali’s fearsome qualities,  
Ramprasad persistently addresses her as  
“mother,” and, like a child, clings to her  
despite all her attempts to discourage  
him. The end result is that his unflinching and unquestioning devotion to Kali  
removes all fear and brings him liberation. For further reading, see David R.
