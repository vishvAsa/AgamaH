Festival falling on the second day of the  
bright (waxing) half of the **lunar month**  
of **Ashadh** (June–July). The primary  
**deity** worshiped in this festival is  
**Jagannath**, who is considered a form of  
the god **Krishna**. This festival is celebrated all over India but especially in the  
sacred city of **Puri**, where the principal  
temple of Jagannath is located. During  
the festival in Puri, Jagannath, his brother  
**Balabhadra**, and his sister **Subhadra**  
are carried in procession through the  
city’s main street to another temple  
about a mile away. They stay in this  
nearby temple for a week, and then  
return to the Jagannath temple.  
The deities are processed by their  
devotees (**bhakta**) in three enormous  
wooden chariots (rath), which the devotees pull using long ropes. The largest of  
the three, belonging to Jagannath, is  
forty-five feet high, thirty-five feet broad  
and wide, and travels on sixteen wheels  
each seven feet high. The English word  
“**juggernaut**” is a corruption of Jagannath,  
and the connotation of a juggernaut as  
an unstoppable force undoubtedly  
derives from the momentum that these  
carts attained once they began to  
move. One of the staple fictions of  
British colonial lore described Jagannath’s  
frenzied devotees committing **suicide**  
by throwing themselves under the  
car’s wheels, so that they would die in  
the sight of God. Despite such tales  
being widely repeated, suicides of this  
sort were extremely uncommon. Still,  
there was some risk in pulling the  
carts, since people losing their footing  
in the massed crowd would be unable  
to get up, and could potentially be  
crushed by the wheels. For further  
information see T. N. Madan (ed.),
