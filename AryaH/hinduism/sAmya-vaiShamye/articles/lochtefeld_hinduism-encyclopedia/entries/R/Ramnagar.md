title = "Ramnagar"

+++
Fortified city just south and across the  
**Ganges** from the sacred city of **Benares**  
in the state of **Uttar Pradesh**. The  
Maharajas of Benares built their fort on  
this site because it was relatively easy to  
defend, and continue to live there,  
although they no longer possess ruling  
power. Ramnagar is famous as the site of  
the oldest and most traditional **Ram Lila**,  
a production of the epic **Ramayana**  
dramatized in a month of nightly  
shows. Aside from sponsoring this Ram  
Lila and underwriting its costs, the  
royal family also continues to play an  
important symbolic role in the production itself. For further information see  
Anuradha Kapur, *Actors*, *Pilgrims*,  
*Kings*, *and Gods*, 1990.
