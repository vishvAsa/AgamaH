title = "Ramdev"

+++
(1404–58) According to legend, a **Rajput**  
prince whose piety and ability to perform miracles won him renown during  
his lifetime, and who was considered an  
incarnation of the god **Krishna** after his  
death. His tomb in the village of  
**Ramdevra**, east of the city of Jaisalmer  
in the western part of the state of  
**Rajasthan**, has become a pilgrimage site  
for devotees (**bhakta**) who come seeking  
various favors. Little is known about  
Ramdev’s life, and unlike many of the  
other medieval saints, he has no poetry  
or body of literature attributed to him,  
nor did he serve as the leader of any  
organized religious community. His  
original followers came to him because  
he was able to meet their needs, and for  
this reason pilgrims come to him still.
