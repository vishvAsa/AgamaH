title = "Rameshvaram"

+++
(“**Rama’s** Lord”) Sacred site (**tirtha**) on  
an island off the coast of the state of  
**Tamil Nadu** in the Palk Strait, which separates **Sri Lanka** from the mainland.  
Rameshvaram is one of the most important sacred sites in India, for several different reasons. It is one of the **four**  
**dhams** associated with the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**, which mark the geographical boundaries of the subcontinent. It also has specific mythic  
associations that make it holy both to  
devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva** and **Vishnu**,  
two of the most important Hindu  
**deities**. For Shiva’s devotees, the pillarshaped image (**linga**) of Shiva there represents the god in his manifestation as  
**Rameshvar** (“Rama’s Lord”). This image  
is also one of the **jyotirlingas**, a network  
of twelve lingas deemed especially holy  
and powerful, and at which Shiva is said  
to be uniquely present. For Vishnu’s  
worshipers, Rameshvaram is held to be  
the place from which the god Rama  
staged his attack on the **demon** kingdom of **Lanka**. According to tradition,  
upon Rama’s return with his rescued  
wife **Sita**, the image of Rameshvaram  
was consecrated in gratitude for his success. Rameshvaram also has very old  
connections with the sacred city of  
**Benares**, and even today pilgrims come  
from there bearing **Ganges** water to  
offer to Shiva.
