title = "Ram Janam Bhumi"

+++
Site in the city of **Ayodhya**, where some  
claim the god **Rama** was born; since the  
early 1980s this spot has witnessed some  
of India’s most intense postindependence religious conflict. The site has  
long been a source of controversy  
between the Hindu and Muslim communities, and British sources record  
hostilities there in 1855 and 1934. Until  
1992 Ram Janam Bhumi was occupied  
by the **Babri Masjid**, a mosque constructed in 1528 by command of Mir  
Baqi, a general of the Moghul emperor  
Babar (1483–1530). Local tradition holds  
that the mosque was built after the razing of an existing Hindu temple there,  
although there is little evidence for this  
claim. A few months after India gained  
independence in 1947, several local  
Hindus secretly installed images of the  
child Rama, his wife **Sita**, and his brother  
**Lakshmana** in the mosque, claiming  
that the images had miraculously  
appeared in a ball of light. The government, having only recently quieted the  
Hindu-Muslim massacres that accompanied the partition of British India into  
India and Pakistan, was loath to ignite  
religious passions, and its solution,  
therefore, was to padlock the compound’s gates and send the case to the  
courts for resolution, where it languished for almost forty years.  
The early 1980s saw renewed controversy over the site, when the **Vishva**  
**Hindu Parishad** (VHP), a Hindu nationalist organization, first began calling for  
the site’s “liberation,” proclaiming that  
the existing mosque was an insult to all  
Hindus. The VHP’s campaign portrayed  
the mosque as a symbol of Muslim iconoclasm and depicted government efforts  
to protect it as an attempt to appease  
the Muslim community and retain their  
votes. In 1986, the VHP’s drive to liberate  
the site was aided by Rajiv Gandhi’s  
national government. Together, the VHP  
and the Gandhi administration  
560  
Rameshvaram  
succeeded in unlocking the compound’s gates so that Hindus could  
**worship** there, though observers called  
the action a clear bid to attract the  
Hindu vote.  
Pressure throughout the 1980s, culminated in a series of campaigns to  
begin construction of a new temple at  
Ram Janam Bhumi. Many of these campaigns coincided with national elections, and the emotion that they  
generated boosted the electoral fortunes  
of the **Bharatiya Janata Party** (BJP), a  
political group with close links to the  
VHP. The final campaign came on  
December 6, 1992, a day that was scheduled to have “symbolic” meaning, and  
ended a little over five hours later with  
the mosque’s demolition. The whole  
operation was carefully planned—  
demolition crews ordered the destruction of all television cameras prior to  
leveling the building in order to prevent  
any media coverage by outsiders. The  
razing was also carried out with the  
blessing of the BJP-led state government,  
which made no attempt to protect the  
temple. Riots ensued, particularly in the  
city of Bombay, where over three  
thousand people were killed, most of  
them Muslims.  
Even after the destruction of the  
Babri Masjid, the site remained an area  
of contention between Muslims and  
Hindus. Immediately after the demolition, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao  
promised to rebuild the mosque but did  
nothing to accomplish this during the  
next five years he was in office.  
Meanwhile, various Hindu groups have  
been calling for the construction of a  
Ram Janam Bhumi temple, including  
traditional religious leaders such as the  
**Shankaracharyas**. Seeing nothing but  
trouble ahead, the government again  
sent the matter to the courts for resolution, where it remains to this day and  
may remain for decades to come. For
