title = "Rta"

+++
In the **Vedas** (the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu texts) rta is the cosmic order and regularity that allows the  
rhythms of time and the **seasons** to  
occur in orderly succession. According  
to the texts, rta also had a moral dimension, which human beings had an obligation to support. One such moral  
dimension was truth, which was seen  
as upholding the cosmos, whereas its  
opposite, **anrta**, came to signify falsehood. The connection between natural  
and moral world came through the  
Vedic god **Varuna**, who was both  
the guardian of rta and the **deity** who  
punished untruth, usually by affliction  
with **dropsy**.
