(“Holy Lake of **Rama’s** Deeds”) Vernacular  
retelling of the **Ramayana**, the earlier of  
the two great **Sanskrit** epics. The  
*Ramcharitmanas* was written by the  
poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623), in the  
language known as **Avadhi**, an eastern  
variant of medieval **Hindi**. Evidence  
indicates that Tulsidas began the text  
in **Ayodhya** in 1574. At nearly 10,000  
lines, this text is by far his longest work  
and is generally considered to be his  
greatest. For the most part the poem is  
structured in groups of six to eight  
verses written in the **chaupai** form, followed by a verse in the shorter **doha**  
form. (The doha verse either sums up  
the essence of the preceding chaupai  
verses or serves to foreshadow later  
developments.) There are also verses  
written in longer meters such as  
**savaiya**, as well as invocations in fluid  
Sanskrit poetry at the beginning of  
each of the seven sections. Tulsidas  
was a masterful epic poet, as evidenced both by the sheer size of his  
text and the high poetic quality of the  
verses contained in it.  
As with all the *Ramayana*’s vernacular retellings, Tulsidas did not merely  
translate the story of Rama but interpreted it according to his own religious  
convictions. His two most important  
changes to the poem are the overwhelming emphasis on the importance  
of devotion (**bhakti**), and the saving  
power of the name of Rama, to which  
Tulsidas gives greater importance than  
Rama himself. Tulsidas also includes  
mythic material from a variety of other  
sources, most notably the **Shiva Purana**  
and the *Adhyatmaramayana*. This  
material is largely added to the first and  
last chapters, in which Tulsidas makes  
his greatest changes from the original  
558  
Rambha Ekadashi  
epic. One theory to explain why Tulsidas  
brought in this other material argues  
that he endeavored to transcend narrow  
sectarian boundaries, for example, by  
having the god **Shiva** narrate much of  
the text in the form of a dialogue to his  
wife **Parvati**. Later, in part of the final  
book, Shiva is supplanted as narrator by  
the crow **Bhushundi**, who symbolizes  
the power of devotion to rescue even a  
common carrion-eating crow.  
The *Ramcharitmanas* has popularly  
been called the “Bible of northern  
India,” reflecting its enormous influence  
on ordinary people’s piety. Although  
according to legend Tulsidas faced some  
opposition from **brahmins** who thought  
it sacrilegious to translate the *Ramayana*  
into a vernacular tongue, the text has  
been immensely popular with ordinary  
people. Even now there are many people  
who can recite large sections from  
memory (“discourses” (**katha**) on the  
text can draw hundreds or thousands  
of people) and many of the verses have  
become proverbial expressions in  
modern Hindi. Aside from reading or  
hearing the text, millions of people see  
it each autumn, in the dramatic presentation known as the **Ram Lila**. The  
oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,  
held at **Ramnagar** in **Benares**, uses the  
text from the *Ramcharitmanas*, and  
takes great pride in this traditionalism.
