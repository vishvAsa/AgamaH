According to Jain tradition, Rishabha  
was the founder of the Jains. He is considered the first of the Jain tirthankaras,  
the founding figures in the Jain religious tradition. He is one of three Jain  
tirthankaras who are mentioned in  
the **Yajur Veda**, one of the earliest  
Hindu religious texts. The figure most  
often credited with developing the  
teachings used by the Jains today is  
Mahavira, who is considered the twentyfourth tirthankara.
