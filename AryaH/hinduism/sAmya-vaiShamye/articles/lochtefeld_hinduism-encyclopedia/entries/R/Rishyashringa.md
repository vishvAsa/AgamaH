title = "Rishyashringa"

+++
A sage in the **Ramayana**, the earlier  
of the two great Indian epics. King  
**Dasharatha** commissions Rishyashringa  
to perform a great **sacrifice**, to enable  
the king’s wives to conceive. At the conclusion of Rishyashringa’s sacrifice, a  
shining figure emerges from the sacrificial fire, places a pot of milk-rice before  
Dasharatha, and directs him to feed it to  
his wives. Dasharatha divides the contents among his wives **Kausalya**,  
**Kaikeyi**, and **Sumitra**, and in due time  
they all bear **sons**. Kausalya is the mother of **Rama**, the *Ramayana*’s protagonist.  
Kaikeyi is the mother of **Bharata**, and  
Sumitra is the mother of **Lakshmana**  
and **Shatrughna**.
