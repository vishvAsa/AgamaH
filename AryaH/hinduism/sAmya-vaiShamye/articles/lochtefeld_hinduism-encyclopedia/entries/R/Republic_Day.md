title = "Republic Day"

+++
Indian national holiday, falling on  
January 26, that marks the day the  
Indian constitution was adopted in  
\1950. As a holiday connected with  
Indian independence, it is one of the few  
celebrated according to the common  
**calendar**. Republic Day is comparable  
to the Fourth of July in the United States  
and is celebrated with massive parades  
in India’s major cities. The largest occurs  
in New Delhi—from which it is televised  
to the rest of the nation—and includes  
singers and performers from all over the  
country, as well as large displays of military hardware, including fly-overs by the  
newest jet planes.
