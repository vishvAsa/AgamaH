title = "Ramakrishna Mission"

+++
Hindu religious organization founded  
in 1897 by **Swami Vivekananda** to propagate the religious message of Vivekananda’s teacher, **Ramakrishna**. Since  
its inception, the Ramakrishna Mission  
has been equally dedicated to spiritual  
uplifting and to social service, based on  
Vivekananda’s realization that India  
needed material development as much  
as it needed religious instruction. The  
mission has sought to fulfill part of this  
charge by publishing inexpensive editions of religious texts, including but not  
restricted to the teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, and by sponsoring social service in the fields of  
552  
Ramakrishna  
education, medical care, and other  
charitable works. For further information see George M. Williams, “The  
Ramakrishna Movement: A Study in  
Religious Change,” in Robert D. Baird  
(ed.), *Religion in Modern India*, 1998.
