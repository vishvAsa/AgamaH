Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli  
Radha, the god Krishna’s lover and companion.  
of his generation, Radhakrishnan was  
educated at Christian missionary  
schools, and the contrast between the  
Hindu piety of his home and the  
Christian doctrine he encountered at  
school sparked his interest in comparative **philosophy**. He spent the rest of his  
life as an interpreter and apologist for  
classical Hindu thought, particularly  
the **Vedanta** school, and as a proponent  
of philosophical idealism, the notion  
that absolute truth can be found  
through intuition alone. Aside from his  
work as a college teacher and administrator, he also served as the vice president of India from 1952 to 1962, and as  
president from 1962 to 1967. For further
