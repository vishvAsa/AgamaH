title = "Rambha Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waning) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Kartik** (Octoberâ€“November). As with all  
the eleventh-day observances, this is  
dedicated to the **worship** of the god  
**Vishnu**, on this particular day in his  
form as **Krishna**. As with most Hindu  
festivals, Rambha Ekadashi requires that  
certain rites be performed. These rites  
involve fasting (**upavasa**) and worship,  
and promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. This ceremony is named  
after Rambha, a famous **apsara** or celestial damsel. Its charter myth tells how, by  
faithfully observing this rite, a certain  
king was born in **heaven** and served by  
Rambha and other apsaras.
