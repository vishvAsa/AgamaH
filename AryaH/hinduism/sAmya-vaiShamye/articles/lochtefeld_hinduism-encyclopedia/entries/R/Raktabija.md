title = "Raktabija"

+++
In the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest and  
most important textual source for the  
**worship** of the **Goddess**, Raktabija is the  
name of one of the **demons** vanquished  
by the goddess **Kali**. Raktabija has  
received the boon that any drop of his  
blood falling to the earth will instantly  
turn into another version of himself,  
rendering him practically unconquerable. Kali defeats this demon by drinking his blood as it is shed, until finally it  
is completely gone, and so is he.
