title = "Roy, Ram Mohan"

+++
(1774–1833) First major Indian proponent of Hindu social and religious  
reform, who founded the organization  
**Brahmo Samaj** for this purpose. He  
came from a wealthy Bengali family and  
was a successful businessman and civil  
servant. He moved to Calcutta in 1815,  
at the time when the British were first  
beginning to take serious notice of traditional Indian society, especially the  
aspects they considered “evil.” Roy’s  
reformist interests largely meshed with  
that of the British. From an early age Roy  
had rejected the practice of using images  
in **worship**, perhaps through exposure  
to Sufi ideas, and his first public crusade  
was against such worship of gods and  
goddesses. Like most Indian reformers,  
Roy used **Sanskrit** texts selectively, and  
for him the most important ones were  
the speculative **Upanishads**, which  
(under the influence of the English  
Unitarians) he translated to reflect a  
monotheism (belief in the existence of  
only one God). In his later years he promoted many different educational and  
social works, but is especially known for  
his opposition to **sati**, the custom of  
burning a **widow** on her husband’s  
funeral pyre. Although later seen as too  
heavily influenced by the British, his  
reinterpretation of the past provided a  
575  
Roy, Ram Mohan  
model for others to use. For further consideration see Robert D. Baird (ed.),
