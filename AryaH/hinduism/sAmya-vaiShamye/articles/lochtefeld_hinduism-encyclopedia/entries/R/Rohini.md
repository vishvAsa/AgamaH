title = "Rohini"

+++
(2) In Hindu mythology, birth mother of  
**Balarama**, the god **Krishna’s** brother.  
Balarama’s birth is unusual. After his  
conception the fetus is magically transported from the womb of **Devaki** to that  
of Rohini. This is done to protect him  
from harm, as Devaki’s wicked uncle  
**Kamsa** has already killed her first seven  
children and will certainly do the same  
to Balarama if she carries him to term.
