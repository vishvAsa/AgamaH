(“king’s son”) Traditional Indian society  
was modeled as a collection of **endogamous**, or intermarried, subgroups  
known as **jatis** (“birth”). These jatis were  
organized (and their social status determined) by the group’s hereditary occupation, over which each jati had a  
monopoly. The Rajputs were a martial  
Hindu jati that at times ruled large parts  
of western India, and have always  
claimed to be **kshatriyas**—buttressing  
this claim by creating genealogies linking their families to the mythical Solar or  
**Lunar Lines** of kings. Their origin is  
uncertain, for they first appear around  
the end of the first millennium, and  
many scholars speculate that they were  
descended from the Hunas and later  
assimilated into the small kingdoms.  
The four main Rajput clans were known  
as the **Agnikula** (“fire lineage”), because  
they claimed descent from a single  
mythical king who had arisen from a  
sacrificial fire pit in Mount Abu,  
**Rajasthan**. These four ruling clans were  
the Pariharas in southern Rajasthan, the  
Chauhans in the region around Delhi,  
the Solankis in **Gujarat**, and the Pawars  
in western **Madhya Pradesh**.  
Whatever their origin, the Rajputs  
were warrior princes whose martial  
code stressed death before dishonor  
and swift reprisals against any insult.  
During the Moghul Empire era  
(1525–1707) Rajput kings were often  
feudal vassals, given kingdoms in  
exchange for their loyalty and service.  
After the breakup of the Moghul Empire  
many of them continued to reign as the  
rulers of small princely states. They  
remain an important ruling class even in  
modern times, through the medium of  
parliamentary politics.
