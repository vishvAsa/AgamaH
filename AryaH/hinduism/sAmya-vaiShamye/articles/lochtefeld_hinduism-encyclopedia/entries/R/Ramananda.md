title = "Ramananda"

(14th c.?) **Sant** poet-saint who is traditionally cited as the spiritual teacher  
(**guru**) of the poet-saints **Kabir**,  
**Ravidas**, **Pipa**, and others. The Sants  
were a group of poet-saints from central  
and northern India who shared several  
general tendencies: stress on individualized, interior religion leading to a personal experience of the divine; disdain  
for external ritual, particularly image  
**worship**; faith in the power of the divine  
name; and a tendency to ignore conventional **caste** distinctions. Ramananda is  
said to have been a charismatic spiritual  
leader, and is claimed to have been a  
direct disciple of the southern Indian  
philosopher **Ramanuja**, who sent  
Ramananda north to help spread the  
devotional movement. The latter claim  
is almost certainly false, given that the  
only verse incontestably attributable to  
Ramananda is found in the **Adigranth**,  
the scripture of the Sikh community.  
This verse does not reflect Ramanujaâ€™s  
**Shrivaishnava** tradition, in which the  
primary **deity** is **Vishnu**, but instead  
shows the influence of the **Nathpanthi**  
ascetics, who stressed **yoga**. There are  
other verses ascribed to Ramananda in  
later sources, but their authenticity is  
doubtful, and little can be definitely  
known about his life.
