(“eye of **Rudra**”) The dried seed of the  
tree *Elaeocarpus ganitrus*, which is considered sacred to the god **Shiva**.  
Rudrakshas are often strung into garlands and worn by Shiva’s devotees  
(**bhakta**). The seed itself is round with a  
knobby, pitted surface, with a natural  
channel in the middle through which a  
thread can easily be drawn. Each seed  
also has natural longitudinal lines running from top to bottom, which divide  
the seed into units known as “faces”  
(mukhi). The most common rudrakshas  
have five faces, but they can have up to  
fourteen. Each differing number of faces  
has been given a symbolic association  
with a particular **deity**. The rarest form  
is the **ekmukhi** rudraksha, which has no  
faces at all and is considered to be a  
manifestation of Shiva himself. This  
rudraksha is so valuable that street sellers routinely make counterfeit versions  
by carving them out of wood. Another  
rare form is the **Gauri-Shankar**, in  
which two rudraksha seeds are longitudinally joined; this is considered a  
manifestation of Shiva and **Shakti**.  
Aside from the number of “faces,” the  
quality of rudrakshas is judged by their  
color and size. The color runs from  
reddish brown to a light brown, with the  
former considered more desirable, while  
the smaller sizes are preferable to the  
larger ones.
