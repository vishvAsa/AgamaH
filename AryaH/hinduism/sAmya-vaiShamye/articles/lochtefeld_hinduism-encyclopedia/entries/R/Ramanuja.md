(11th c.) Southern Indian philosopher  
who was the greatest exponent of the  
philosophical position known as  
**Vishishthadvaita** (“qualified nondualism”) **Vedanta**, and the most important  
figure in the **Shrivaishnava** religious  
community. Ramanuja lived most of his  
life at the temple-town of **Shrirangam**  
in the state of **Tamil Nadu**, in service of  
the temple’s resident **deity**, **Ranganatha**,  
a form of **Vishnu**. Ramanuja was convinced that **Brahman**, or Supreme  
Reality, was a personal deity rather than  
an impersonal abstract principle, and he  
was also convinced that devotion  
(**bhakti**) was the most important form of  
religious practice. **Vishishthadvaita**  
**Vedanta**, his philosophical position,  
stressed both of these convictions.  
According to Ramanuja, in his essential  
nature God is completely transcendent  
and free from imperfections. The world  
develops from God through a process of  
**evolution**, an idea adapted from the  
**Samkhya** philosophical school. The  
world is thus similar to God, since it  
proceeds from him, but also different,  
since matter is unconscious and  
insentient. In the same way, human  
beings are similar in nature to God,  
because they have him as their source,  
though unlike God they are subject to  
ignorance and suffering. For Ramanuja  
and his followers, God is not identical  
to human selves or to the world, all of  
which are perceived as having real and  
independent existence. The differences in capacity between God and  
human beings makes devotion the  
most effective means to gain final liberation (**moksha**) of the soul, a liberation that is conceived of as eternal  
communion with God. For further
