title = "Rameshvar"

+++
Manifestation of the god **Shiva**, in his  
form as “**Rama’s** Lord” at **Rameshvaram**  
in the state of **Tamil Nadu**. The image of  
Rameshvar at this site is a **linga**, a pillarshaped object said to represent Shiva’s  
symbolic form. The Rameshvar linga is  
one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network  
of twelve lingas deemed especially holy  
and powerful, and at which Shiva is  
thought to be uniquely present. The  
site’s mythic charter is drawn from the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
**Sanskrit** epics. According to tradition,  
Shiva is worshiped here by the god  
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, although  
there are differing accounts of when this  
happened. In some stories, it is to gain  
Shiva’s blessing immediately before  
559  
Rameshvar  
Rama’s attack on the **demon** kingdom of  
**Lanka**. In other accounts the **worship**  
comes after the conquest of Lanka, as a  
rite of thanksgiving. In either case, both  
sets of stories portray Rama as a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of Shiva and thus buttress  
Shiva’s status as the greatest god of all.
