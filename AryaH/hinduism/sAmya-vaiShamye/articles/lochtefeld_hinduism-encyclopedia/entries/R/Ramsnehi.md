title = "Ramsnehi"

+++
Renunciant **ascetic** community made  
up of devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**—in his form as the god **Rama**—  
whose practice stresses the love (sneha)  
of Rama. The Ramsnehis have three  
main centers, all located in the state of  
**Rajasthan**. These centers are unique in  
that each pays homage only to its own  
founder, and no founder or preceptor is  
honored by all three. Ramsnehi religious  
practice focuses on the repetition of the  
name of Rama, but has also been influenced by the Jains. Because of this latter  
influence the Ramsnehis voluntarily  
take on many restrictions to avoid  
destroying life.
