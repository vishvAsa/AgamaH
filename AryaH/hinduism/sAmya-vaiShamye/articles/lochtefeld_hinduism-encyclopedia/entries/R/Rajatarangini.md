title = "Rajatarangini"

+++
(“River of Kings”) Historical chronicle of  
the kings of **Kashmir**, written in verse by  
the Kashmiri poet **Kalhana**. The  
*Rajatarangini* is an unusually descriptive and accurate history of Kashmir and  
the region’s political, social, and religious institutions; the text’s only shortcoming is that it pays little attention to  
the outside world. Kalhana’s historical  
emphasis is unusual for Indian writers,  
and the *Rajatarangini* is one of the few  
indigenous Indian histories.
