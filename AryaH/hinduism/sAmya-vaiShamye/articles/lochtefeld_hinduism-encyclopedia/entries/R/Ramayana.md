title = "Ramayana"

+++
One of the two great **Sanskrit** epics, traditionally ascribed to the mythical sage  
**Valmiki**. The *Ramayana* is much shorter  
than the other great epic, the  
**Mahabharata**, and in many ways is a  
less complex work. The *Ramayana*’s text  
was composed later than the core story  
of the *Mahabharata*, but the  
*Mahabharata*’s final recension was  
compiled after the *Ramayana* had been  
fixed. The *Mahabharata* is the story of  
an “evil” royal family for whom greed  
and power-mongering ultimately lead  
to destruction. In contrast, the  
*Ramayana* is the tale of a “good” royal  
family, and many of the epic’s characters  
are symbols of established Indian family  
values: **Rama** is the perfect son and the  
virtuous king, **Lakshmana** and **Bharata**  
his ideal younger brothers, and **Sita** the  
model wife. Despite this, the story is not  
without some troubling moral issues,  
particularly connected with Rama’s  
treatment of Sita.  
The story has been altered somewhat over the years, with the most  
important change being the elevation  
of Rama to divine status as an **avatar** or  
incarnation of the god **Vishnu**. The earliest *Ramayana*, attributed to the sage  
**Valmiki**, mentions Rama’s divinity only  
in the first and last books, whereas in  
other portions of the poem he is  
described merely as a great hero. Given  
the position of these references to  
divinity, scholars speculate that they  
could easily have been added to the  
original core story of exile, abduction,  
and revenge.  
The text of the *Ramayana* is divided  
into seven sections (khandas), each of  
which has a different focus. In the opening section, the Balakhanda (“childhood  
section”), the text describes the birth of  
Rama and his brothers (Lakshmana,  
Bharata, and **Shatrughna**) to King  
**Dasharatha**, and their lives as young  
princes. Rama and his brothers take part  
in an archery contest, sponsored by  
King **Janaka**, at which Rama’s prowess  
as an archer wins the hand of Janaka’s  
daughter Sita. They are married and live  
happily at Dasharatha’s court.  
The Ayodhyakhanda (“**Ayodhya** section”) tells how Dasharatha makes  
preparations to anoint Rama as his successor but how, on the night before the  
ceremony, these plans are spoiled by  
Rama’s stepmother **Kaikeyi**. Many years  
before, Kaikeyi receives the offer of two  
favors from Dasharatha, which she has  
never used. At the suggestion of her  
hunchback maid **Manthara**, Kaikeyi  
demands of Dasharatha that Rama be  
banished to the forest for fourteen years,  
and that her son Bharata be crowned in  
his place. This disaster seems grounded  
in malice but is presented as the culmination of a **curse** placed on Dasharatha,  
which predicts he will die bereft of his  
sons. When informed of his stepmother’s
