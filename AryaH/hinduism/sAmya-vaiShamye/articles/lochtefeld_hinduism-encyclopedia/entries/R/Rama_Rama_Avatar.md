title = "Rama (Rama Avatar)"

+++
The seventh **avatar** or incarnation of the  
god **Vishnu**, the crown prince of the  
**Solar Line** and the protagonist of the  
**Ramayana**, one of the two great Indian  
epics. As with all of Vishnu’s avatars,  
Rama is born to destroy a being powerful enough to throw the cosmos out of  
balance, in this case **Ravana**, the  
**demon**-king of **Lanka**. The focal conflict  
550  
Rakshasa  
in the *Ramayana* is **Rama’s** quest to  
regain his wife **Sita**, who has been kidnapped by Ravana. The climactic  
sequence of the epic features Rama’s  
struggle with Ravana, Ravana’s death,  
and the reestablishment of cosmic equilibrium, signified by Rama’s ascension  
to divine kingship.  
Unlike the god **Krishna**, whose  
divine play (**lila**) often subverts or  
ignores accepted social values, Rama is  
a pillar of society. As a whole the  
*Ramayana* tends to espouse and uphold  
the traditional social values of religious  
duty (**dharma**), social hierarchy (**varna**),  
and the **stages of life** (ashrama). As the  
epic’s protagonist, Rama is the epitome  
of all these values. He is solid, dependable, stable, righteous, and predictable.  
In Hindu culture Rama is the model of  
the perfect **son**, and he shows this by  
being utterly devoted to his parents,  
giving far greater weight to his duties  
as a son than as a husband. Unlike  
Krishna, who has multiple liaisons  
with his female devotees (**bhakta**), all in  
the name of divine play, Rama is  
married and monogamous. When  
the time comes for battle, he is the  
fiercest of combatants, incarnating  
the warrior (**kshatriya**) ideal of using  
strength to uphold justice, protect  
the righteous, and punish the wicked.  
In all these things he personifies some  
of the most deeply embedded values  
of Hindu culture.  
Yet there are also some unsettling  
incidents, particularly in the **Valmiki**  
*Ramayana*, the epic’s earliest version.  
These incidents either feature Rama  
inexplicably stepping out of character  
or else point to problematic tensions in  
traditional Hindu values. In an attempt  
to help the monkey-king **Sugriva**  
against his rival **Bali**, Rama shoots Bali  
in the back from a concealed place—  
an action incompatible with the notion  
of fair and honorable warfare. His  
actions in enforcing the existing social  
order also show its oppressive and  
restrictive nature. In one incident, Rama  
kills a low-status **shudra** whom he finds  
performing physical **asceticism** (**tapas**),  
a privilege reserved for his betters, and  
has molten lead poured in the ears of  
another shudra who was discovered listening to the sacred **Vedas**—a forbidden act for such a person. Both  
incidents show the hierarchical nature  
of idealized Hindu society, and the  
king’s role in preserving and sustaining  
this hierarchy. When Rama and his  
brother **Lakshmana** are propositioned  
by Ravana’s sister **Shurpanakha**, they  
first mislead and ridicule her, then  
mutilate her by cutting off her ears  
and nose. These actions seem incompatible with the kshatriya ethic of  
respect for **women** and the righteous  
use of force, and prompt Ravana to kidnap Sita in revenge.  
Perhaps the most troubling questions arise from Rama’s behavior toward  
his wife Sita. Immediately after being  
liberated from enslavement, she undergoes an **ordeal** by **fire**, from which her  
emergence unscathed upholds her

Rama (Rama Avatar)  
The god Vishnu’s Rama avatar. In the Hindu epic  
the *Ramayana*, Vishnu appears as Rama to defeat  
Ravana, the demon king.  
claim that she remained chaste while  
being held captive. Despite this definitive proof, Rama later insists on a  
second test, in which Sita, in protest, is  
swallowed up by the **earth**. Thus, the  
picture of Rama conveyed by the epic  
is of a figure righteous by the standards  
of his time but on occasion rigid  
and inflexible.  
In later versions of the *Ramayana*,  
particularly the **Ramcharitmanas** by  
the poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623?),  
this picture subtly shifts, possibly in an  
attempt to soften or remove these troubling incidents. Certain changes in  
Tulsidas’s text also highlight the centrality of devotion (**bhakti**) over all other  
religious attitudes. Tulsidas’s Rama is  
more explicitly portrayed as God incarnate, a figure who is aware of his divine  
status and whose actions are undertaken  
for the benefit of his devotees. This  
Rama is still concerned with social values, particularly the kshatriya obligation  
to uphold and protect religious duty  
(dharma). Yet this ethic is in tension  
with—and sometimes in opposition  
to—the importance of bhakti, which is  
portrayed as the ultimate religious goal.  
These subtle shifts in the later text point  
to an occasional conflict between two  
differing ideals—dharma and bhakti—  
both of which are affirmed as essential.
