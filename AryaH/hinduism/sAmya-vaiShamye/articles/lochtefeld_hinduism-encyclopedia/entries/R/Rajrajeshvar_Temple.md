title = "Rajrajeshvar Temple"

+++
Massive temple in the city of **Tanjore** in  
state of **Tamil Nadu**, dedicated to the  
god **Shiva** in his form as “Lord of Kings.”  
Tanjore was the capital of the **Chola**  
**dynasty**, and this temple, built approximately 1000 C.E. by the Chola king **Raja**  
**Raja**, conveys the confidence of a kingdom on the rise. Architecturally speaking, the temple is an enlargement of the  
simplest sort of Hindu temple, with a  
**garbhagrha** covered by a spire, but it is  
breathtaking in its scale. The tower over  
the central shrine is 190 feet high and  
looks even higher, since the construction minimizes any distracting elements  
that would arrest the eye’s upward  
journey. It is capped by a single piece  
of stone weighing an estimated  
eighty tons, which required a four-milelong ramp to put in place. See also  
**Moghul dynasty**.
