+++
Person able to appreciate a developed  
artistic mood (**rasa**); someone who is  
cultured and sophisticated. In the context of religious practice, the word refers  
to a person who has transposed this  
appreciation of aesthetic mood into a  
devotional setting. Rasik devotees  
(**bhakta**) would engage in elaborate  
visualizations of their chosen divinity  
and mentally accompany that divinity  
during the day. These meditative visualizations were said to give the devotee a  
sense of participation in the divine play  
(**lila**) of Godâ€™s presence on earth and  
thus sharpen his or her enjoyment of  
it. The two religious communities that  
laid the greatest stress on this ability  
were the **Pushti Marg** and the **Ram**  
**Rasik Sampraday**, whose objects of  
devotion were the gods **Krishna**  
and **Rama**, respectively. This type of  
**worship** is almost exclusively focused  
on these **deities**, or on other forms of  
the god **Vishnu**.
