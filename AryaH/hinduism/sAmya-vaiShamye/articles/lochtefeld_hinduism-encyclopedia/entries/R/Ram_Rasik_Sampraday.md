title = "Ram Rasik Sampraday"

+++
Religious lineage among the **Ramanandis**,  
a community of renunciant ascetics. All  
Ramanandis are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Rama**, but members of the  
Ram Rasik Sampraday stress the **worship** of Rama and his wife **Sita** as the  
divine couple. They focus their worship on the time of domestic bliss  
when the newly married couple lived in  
**Ayodhya**, before Rama’s unjust banishment from that city. Rasik (“aesthete”)  
devotion involves complex forms of  
visualization, in which devotees imagine themselves to be servants and companions of Rama and Sita, and spend  
their days in service to the divine couple. Rasik devotees also draw up exacting “schedules” of the **deities’** daily  
routines—in some cases, down to the  
quarter-hour—so that through this  
imaginative exaltation they can savor  
the bliss of being God’s companions.  
(This form of dedication is clearly influenced by devotional patterns to the god  
**Krishna**, particularly the divine reverence found in the **Gaudiya Vaishnava**  
563  
Ram Rasik Sampraday  
religious community.) Because Rasik  
worship is complex and highly developed, it has remained an elite phenomenon largely confined to a small  
group of ascetics. For further information see Peter van der Veer, *Gods on*  
*Earth*, 1988; and Philip Lutgendorf,
