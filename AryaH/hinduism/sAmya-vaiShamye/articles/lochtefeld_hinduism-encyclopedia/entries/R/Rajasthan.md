title = "Rajasthan"

+++
(“land of kings”) Modern Indian state on  
the border of Pakistan between the  
states of **Punjab** and **Gujarat**, created by  
combining a network of princely states  
with Ajmer, formerly under British control. These principalities were the remnants of small kingdoms, usually  
maintained by force of arms, giving  
Rajasthan its well-entrenched martial  
tradition. Many cities in Rajasthan have  
large forts originally built as defensive  
strongholds, which in modern times  
have been popular tourist attractions.  
Geographically, the state is split diagonally by the **Aravalli Hills**, creating two  
distinct climatic zones. The south gets  
more rainfall and has traditionally been  
more thickly settled, whereas the north  
blends gradually into the Thar Desert—  
rendered cultivable in recent years by a  
system of irrigation canals. While the  
state’s most important pilgrimage site is  
the city of **Pushkar**, other locales of  
interest abound. Among them, the temple of **Hanuman** at **Mehndipur** has  
gained regional importance as a site for  
curing mental illness, and the **Karni**  
**Mata** temple in the village of **Deshnok** is  
noted for its sacred rats. For general  
information about Rajasthan and all the  
regions of India, an accessible reference
