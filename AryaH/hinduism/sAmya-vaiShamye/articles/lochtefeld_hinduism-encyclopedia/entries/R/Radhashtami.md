(“**Radha’s** eighth”) Festival falling on the  
eight **day** of the bright (waxing) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September); this day is celebrated as the birthday of **Krishna’s** consort Radha. Radha is seen differently by  
various **Vaishnava** religious communities: For some she is a human woman,  
the symbol of the perfect devotee  
(**bhakta**) who forsakes all else to be with  
her lover, for others she is considered  
the queen of heaven and an equal to  
Krishna himself. In either case, her  
closeness to him is shown by her birth  
on the same month and lunar day as  
Krishna, but in the opposite half of the  
month. Radhashtami festival is celebrated  
with particular fervor in **Barsana**, the  
village in the **Braj** region in which Radha  
is said to have been born.
