title = "Raskhan"

+++
(late 16th c.) Poet-saint and devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna** who was  
born a Muslim, specifically a Pathan  
(Afghan) and whose name may have  
been Saiyid Ibrahim. According to legend, Raskhan spent the early part of his  
life in Delhi, where he became enamored of a handsome boy. When the  
object of his affections proved unattainable, he migrated to **Brindavan**, the  
566  
Rasik  
town where Krishna is said to have lived  
as a child, and spent the rest of his life  
sublimating that attraction through his  
devotion to Krishna. The main themes  
in his poetry are the attraction of the  
cowherd women (**gopis**) to Krishna,  
sparked by Krishnaâ€™s physical beauty  
and, especially, the enthralling music  
of his flute. With Raskhan one finds  
a person who was a Muslim by birth  
but who used images and attitudes  
belonging to Hindu culture in an  
absolutely genuine manner.
