title = "Rahu"

+++
A malevolent “**planet**” in Hindu astrology  
(**jyotisha**) that has no counterpart in  
Western astrology and was originally the  
head of a **demon**. According to the story,  
as the gods drink the nectar of immortality they have churned from the ocean  
of milk, the demon **Sainhikeya** slips into  
their midst in disguise. As the demon  
begins to drink, the **sun** and **moon** alert  
**Vishnu**, who uses his discus to cut off  
the demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s two  
halves become immortal, however, after  
coming into contact with the nectar. The  
severed head becomes Rahu, and the  
decapitated body another evil planet,  
**Ketu**. Rahu is regarded not as a physical  
planet, but as the ascending node of the  
moon. This is the point where the  
moon’s northward path intersects the  
path of the sun in the sky, causing an  
**eclipse**. Rahu has particular enmity for  
the sun and moon, as the **deities**  
responsible for his demise, and tries to  
swallow them whenever he meets them  
545  
Rahu  
in the **heavens**. He always succeeds, but  
since he no longer has a body to digest  
them, they escape unharmed through  
Rahu’s severed neck. This, of course, is  
the traditional explanation for solar and  
lunar eclipses; their association with the  
malevolent Rahu has led eclipses to be  
seen as highly inauspicious times. See  
also **Tortoise avatar**.
