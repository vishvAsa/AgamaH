(“[one whose] arm is upraised”) Name  
for a person practicing a particularly  
severe form of physical mortification, in  
which one or both arms are kept continually raised. After some time the muscles atrophy, and the arms cannot be  
lowered again. Although urdhvabahu is

Urdhvabahu  
not very common, it has a long-attested  
history as an **ascetic** practice. As with all  
such harsh physical **asceticism**, this is  
believed to give one the great benefits of  
spiritual awareness and magical power.  
This belief is based partly on the culturally accepted notion that the willingness  
to endure physical suffering generates  
such spiritual power, but this belief  
could also stem from the strength  
of will needed to carry this out—a  
strength of will that would presumably  
have correlates in other dimensions  
of one’s personality.
