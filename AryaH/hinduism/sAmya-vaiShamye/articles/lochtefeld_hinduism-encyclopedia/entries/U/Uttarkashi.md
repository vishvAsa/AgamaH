+++
(“northern **Benares**”) Himalayan town  
and sacred site (**tirtha**) on the  
**Bhagirathi River** in northern **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. As its name indicates,  
Uttarkashi is claimed as the northern  
form of the city of Benares, the city of  
the god **Shiva** that is one of the most  
sacred sites in India. Uttarkashi’s charter  
myths also claim that in the present age,  
Shiva no longer dwells in Benares, but  
instead lives in Uttarkashi. To buttress  
the claim to being the northern Benares  
Uttarkashi shows many parallels and  
homologies with Benares itself: In both,  
the **Ganges River** flows in a northern  
direction through the city; both have  
their core region defined as the area  
between the **Varuna** and Asi Rivers;  
both are enclosed by a **panchakroshi**  
pilgrimage route; and in both, the primary **deity** is Shiva in his form as  
**Vishvanath**. Uttarkashi is a site of great  
antiquity—**inscriptions** have been discovered from the seventh century C.E.—  
and although these parallels to Benares  
might seem slavish, the basis of this  
claim is not just that Uttarkashi is a holy  
place, just as Benares is a holy place, but  
that the holiness of Uttarkashi is equal  
to that of Benares. Aside from its importance as a pilgrimage town, Uttarkashi  
is also the district headquarters and  
a major supply point to the other sites  
in the region. The town was severely  
damaged in an earthquake in early 1993  
and has been rebuilding slowly since  
that time.
