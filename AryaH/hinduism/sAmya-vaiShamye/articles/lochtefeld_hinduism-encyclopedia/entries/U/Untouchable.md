title = "Untouchable"

+++
Name denoting certain **jatis** who were  
considered so impure that their very  
presence was polluting to **caste**  
Hindus, that is, Hindus belonging to  
the four **varnas** (major social divisions). Jatis are **endogamous** social  
subgroups—groups in which members  
are forbidden to marry outside of their  
particular group—that were often  
defined by the group’s hereditary occupation. Untouchability usually stemmed  
from occupations considered impure or  
debased, such as working with **leather**,  
in the case of the **Chamars**, or the  
groups whose hereditary occupation  
was to remove night soil, often by carrying it in baskets balanced on their heads.  
In traditional society, untouchables  
were subject to numerous restrictions  
and prohibitions on where they could  
live, work, draw water, and even move  
about. In many cases they had to  
announce their presence to allow caste  
Hindus to remove themselves from the  
area. Although untouchability has been  
illegal since independence, social attitudes supporting it persist, and in a  
country in which one’s name often conveys one’s jati, such discrimination is  
difficult to escape. In many places these  
people are still underprivileged and  
desperately poor, as a legacy of the past.  
In recent years they have become more  
militant—among other things, adopting  
the name **dalit** (“oppressed”) to describe  
themselves—and have begun to  
exercise their power at the ballot  
box, trying to take advantage of their  
considerable numbers.
