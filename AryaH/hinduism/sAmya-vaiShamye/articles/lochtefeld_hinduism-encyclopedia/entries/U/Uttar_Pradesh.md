title = "Uttar Pradesh"

+++
(“northern state”) Modern Indian state  
running along the border with **Nepal**.  
Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous  
state and is thus one of its most politically important. The state has a range of  
different ecosystems, from the high  
**Himalayas** to the rice-growing plains in  
its eastern basin, which gives it  
immense natural and social variety.  
Uttar Pradesh also contains the sources  
and much of the length for both the  
**Ganges** and **Yamuna Rivers**, and the  
state thus contains many of the holiest  
sites in India. Although a full catalog  
would be difficult to give, some of  
the state’s major sacred sites (**tirthas**)  
are the four Himalayan Dhams  
(“[divine] abodes”), **Yamunotri**,  
**Gangotri**, **Kedarnath**, and **Badrinath**;  
the sacred cities of **Haridwar**,  
**Allahabad**, and **Benares**; the city of  
**Ayodhya**, the mythic home of the  
god **Rama**; and the **Braj** region south  
of Delhi, which is mythically associated  
with the god **Krishna**. For general  
information about Uttar Pradesh and  
all the regions of India, an accessible  
reference is Christine Nivin et al.,  
*India*, 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998. See  
also **four dhams**.
