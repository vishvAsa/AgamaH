(“upside-down language”) Word denoting paradoxical language in which the  
speaker’s utterances are reversals of  
“normal” events, such as “The cow is  
sucking the calf’s teat,” “Mouse stalks  
cat,” “Rain falls from **earth** to sky.” The  
most famous composer of such utterances was the devotional (**bhakti**) poetsaint **Kabir**, who inherited a tradition of

the **Nathpanthi** and **Sahajiya** religious  
communities. Ulatbamsi utterances are  
not intended to be simply nonsensical,

beyond right side up and upside  
down. For a long discussion of
