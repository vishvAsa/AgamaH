title = "Uddhava"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the god  
**Krishna’s** friends and companions. In  
717  
Uddhava  
the devotional (**bhakti**) literature,  
Uddhava is most famous for the message he carries from Krishna back to the  
**gopis**, the cowherd **women** of **Braj** (a  
northern Indian region on the **Yamuna**  
**River** south of the modern city of Delhi)  
who are Krishna’s devotees (**bhakta**) and  
who love him more than life. Uddhava  
tells the gopis not to be concerned with  
Krishna’s physical absence, since as the  
supreme divinity, Krishna is always with  
them, even though he may not be visible. The gopis reply that such talk is fine  
for intellectual folk such as Uddhava,  
but that for simple women like themselves, who have had the delight of associating with Krishna in the flesh, such  
abstractions are absolutely useless.  
Uddhava and the gopis are symbols for  
two different types of religious life: one  
cool and abstract, focused on an impersonal divinity, and the other based on  
passionate love for a particular **deity**.  
Differing accounts of this story give different endings, according to the writers’  
inclinations. In some of the stories,  
including the earliest version in the  
**Bhagavata Purana**, the story ends in a  
standoff, with each side unable to convince the other. Yet in at least one of the  
accounts, Uddhava is converted to the  
gopis’ point of view. For further information see R. S. McGregor (ed. and  
trans.), *Nanddas*, 1973.
