(“obstruction”) In Indian logic, a counterexample that renders an inference  
(**anumana**) invalid by showing that the  
reason (**hetu**) given as evidence for the  
initial assertion (**sadhya**) is not invariably true. For example, the inference  
that “there is smoke because there is  
fire” was judged invalid because of the  
counterexample of the red-hot iron ball,  
which was considered fiery but not  
smoky. Since the red-hot iron ball was a  
class of fiery things that did not smoke,  
it showed that the reason given for the  
inference did not account for every case  
of the thing to be proved (sadhya)—and  
thus raised the possibility that there  
were other such cases as well. This  
invalid inference fails the requirement  
known as pervasion (**vyapti**), in which  
the reason must account for every  
possible case; this is critical for validity  
in an inference. Needless to say, the  
search for such counterexamples was an  
essential part of Indian logic, since  
one such example could discredit an  
opponent’s argument. For further  
information and elaboration, see
