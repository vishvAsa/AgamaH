title = "Ukhimath"

+++
Himalayan town on the **Mandakini**  
**River** in the hills of **Uttar Pradesh**,  
across the river from **Guptakashi**.  
Ukhimath is the winter seat of  
**Kedarnath**, a form of **Shiva** whose summer home is a temple in the village of  
Kedarnath, high in the mountains at the  
Mandakiniâ€™s headwaters. The village is  
at such high altitude that it is only accessible between late April and October,  
after the snows have melted; in October  
the temple is ritually closed until  
the next spring. When the temple at  
Kedarnath has been closed for the  
winter, the **deity** (symbolically represented by a movable image) takes  
residence in Ukhimath for the winter  
and then moves back to Kedarnath the  
following spring.
