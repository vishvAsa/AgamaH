**Ascetic** community founded by  
**Shrichandra** (traditional dates 1492â€“  
1612), the elder son of Guru Nanak, the  
first of the ten Sikh gurus. According to  
one tradition, Nanak passed over  
Shrichandra as his successor because  
Shrichandra had become an ascetic.  
Guru Nanak disapproved of this, believing that his followers should live married lives in society. The Udasis have  
always been an ascetic sect, and since  
their formation they have been seen as  
distinct from the two other major  
ascetic communities, the **Sanyasis** and  
the **Bairagis**. The latter are separated on  
sectarian grounds: The Sanyasis **worship** the god **Shiva**, and the Bairagis the  
god **Vishnu**, whereas the Udasis worship the Panchayatana grouping of five  
Hindu **deities** (Shiva, Vishnu, **Ganesh**,  
**Surya**, and **Durga**) rather than one or  
another alone. During the bathing  
(**snana**) processions at the **Kumbha**  
**Mela**, the Udasis march third, behind  
the Sanyasis and the Bairagis. Through  
the legacy of their founder, they have  
retained some informal connections  
with the Sikh community, but by and  
large they have always been considered  
to belong in the Hindu fold. There was  
considerable friction between the  
Udasis and the Sikh community in the  
early twentieth century because the  
Sikhs were more self-consciously asserting their separate identity. See also
