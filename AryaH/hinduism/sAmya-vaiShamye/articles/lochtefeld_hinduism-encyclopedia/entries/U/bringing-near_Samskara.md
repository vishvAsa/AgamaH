title = "(“bringing-near”) Samskara"

+++
Traditionally, the eleventh of the life  
cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**), in which  
a young man received a religious **initiation** that functioned as a symbolic “second birth,” conferring on him new  
capacities and responsibilities. This ceremony marks the symbolic end of childhood and, as with many such rites of  
passage, the creation of a new social  
identity. After this rite the initiate  
becomes a **brahmacharin**, the first of  
the **stages of life** (ashramas) for a  
“**twice-born**” man. This initiation gives  
the entitlement and the obligation to  
study the **Vedas**, the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu religious texts, and  
according to the traditional model, the  
young man would have done this while  
living in the household of his **guru**. With  
721  
Upanayana (“bringing-near”) Samskara  
this entitlement came responsibilities,  
particularly to observe **purity** laws, to  
which younger children were not  
subject. If nothing else, this rite is an  
essential prerequisite to marriage, since  
without it the young man is still  
considered a child, and in some  
contemporary cases it is performed  
immediately before the wedding.  
According to the **dharma literature**,  
this rite was restricted to young men  
from the three highest traditional social  
classes (**varnas**), namely, **brahmins**,  
**kshatriyas**, and **vaishyas**. Indeed, it is  
the entitlement for this rite that makes  
these three the “twice-born” groups. For  
each group, a different age was prescribed for initiation and a different  
duration fixed for study, with brahmins  
being both earliest to start and the  
longest to study. The heart of the  
upanayana samskara is investing the  
young man with the **sacred thread**  
(janeu), which he must wear from that  
day forth, and teaching him the sacred  
formula known as the **Gayatri mantra**.  
This rite is still important and still widely  
performed, although it tends to be  
stressed most by brahmins. This is not  
surprising, given their traditional position as teachers and scholars and their  
concern for conserving that status, even  
in modern times. For further information see Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.),  
*A History of Dharmasastra*, 1968; and Raj  
Bali Pandey, *Hindu Samskaras,* 1969.  
The former is encyclopedic and the  
latter more accessible; despite their  
age, they remain the best sources for  
traditional Hindu rites.
