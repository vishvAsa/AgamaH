(“junior **Indra**”) Epithet of the god  
**Vishnu**. It is first used in some late  
hymns in the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu  
religious texts, in which Vishnu is portrayed as a subordinate and companion  
of the storm-god Indra, who is the primary Vedic **deity**. The epithet continues  
to be used later despite Indra’s eclipse as  
a significant deity, and thus its literal  
meaning is no longer true. See **Vishnu**.
