The Mahakaleshvar Temple in Ujjain.  
It is dedicated to the god Shiva  
in the form of the “Lord of Death.”  
**Pradesh**, about 100 miles west of  
Bhopal, the state capital. Ujjain is the  
traditional center of the **Malwa** plateau  
and has a long history as a commercial,  
political, cultural, and sacred center. In  
earlier times Ujjain was a major stop on  
the central trade route, through which  
goods from southern India were funneled to other places farther north. Just  
before the common era, Ujjain is said to  
have been the capital of King  
**Vikramaditya**, after whom the **Vikram**  
**era** was named. Vikramaditya’s stepbrother, **Bhartrhari**, reportedly renounced  
the throne to become an **ascetic** but is  
best known for his poetry. In later days  
Ujjain was the *de facto* capital of the  
Gupta ruler **Chandra Gupta II** (r.  
380–414 C.E.), under whose patronage  
the greatest **Sanskrit** poet, **Kalidasa**, is  
said to have worked.  
As a sacred center, Ujjain has multiple attractions, and this is its major  
source of contemporary importance. It  
is one of the **Seven Sacred Cities** of  
India. Dying in one of these cities is said  
to bring liberation. Every twelve years  
Ujjain plays host to the bathing (**snana**)  
festival known as the **Kumbha Mela**,  
although the **mela** there is smaller than  
the ones at **Haridwar** and **Allahabad**.  
Given its history, Ujjain is studded with  
important religious sites. The most  
important site is the temple to **Shiva**  
in his form as **Mahakaleshvar**, the  
“Lord of Death.” Shiva is present at  
Mahakaleshvar in the form of a **linga**,  
the pillar-shaped image that is his symbolic form. The Mahakaleshvar linga is  
one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network  
of sites deemed especially sacred to  
Shiva and at which Shiva is uniquely  
present. Ujjain is also famous for a temple associated with **Matsyendranath**,  
the religious preceptor (**guru**) of  
**Gorakhnath**, the founder of the  
**Nathpanthi** ascetics. In addition, Ujjain  
has a temple to the nine **planets**, as  
well as one of the **baithaks**, a group of  
108 sacred sites associated with the  
life and activity of the philosopher  
**Vallabhacharya**. Ujjain’s most unusual  
site is the temple to the **deity** Kal  
Bhairav. Kal Bhairav is another name for  
**Bhairava**, a horrific form of Shiva,  
and the traditional **offering** at the temple is **liquor**—a substance proscribed  
and condemned by “respectable”  
Hindus and thus the ideal offering for a  
marginal deity such as Bhairava. See
