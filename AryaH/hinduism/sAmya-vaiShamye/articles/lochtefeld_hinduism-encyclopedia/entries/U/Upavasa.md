title = "Upavasa"

+++
General term denoting fasting, which  
is sometimes performed as a prescribed action for particular religious  
observances such as festivals and vows  
(**vrats**), and which is also done as  
a means of expiating one’s sins.  
Although upavasa can refer to total  
abstinence from food and drink, it  
usually entails modification of one’s  
diet. In some cases, as on the festival of  
**Shivaratri**, such “fasting” entails  
abstaining from cooked grains, which  
are considered such an essential element in a meal that in parts of India  
the word rice is also used to mean  
“food.” In other cases one will abstain  
from certain types of food, such as for  
the **Santoshi Ma Vrat**, in which the person must not eat anything containing  
sour or bitter flavors.  
When fasting is performed as expiation (**prayashchitta**), the prescriptions  
are usually concerned with the amount  
of food eaten rather than the particular  
type. The best-known rite of this kind is  
the **chandrayana**, a penitential rite lasting for one **lunar month** in which the  
penitent’s food consumption mirrors  
the monthly course of the **moon**. The  
performer begins by eating fourteen  
mouthfuls of food on the first day  
of the waning moon, then one less  
mouthful on each successive day, with  
a complete fast on the **new moon** day.  
On each successive day during the  
waxing moon, the penitent eats one  
more mouthful, finishing at fifteen on  
the day of the **full moon**.
