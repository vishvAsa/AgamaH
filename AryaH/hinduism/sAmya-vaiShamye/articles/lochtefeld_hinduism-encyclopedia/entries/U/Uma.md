title = "Uma"

+++
Epithet of the **goddess Parvati**, wife of  
the god **Shiva**. The name supposedly  
comes from the exclamation uttered by  
Parvati’s mother, **Mena**, when Parvati  
announces that she intends to perform  
**asceticism** to win Shiva as a husband.  
According to the story, Mena covers her  
ears with her hands and replies “U Ma!”  
(Oh, don’t!) As with all forms of Parvati  
(and all married goddesses), Uma is  
a beneficent and benevolent presence,  
maternal and life affirming, although  
at times she can be capricious and  
spiteful if insulted. For more information on Uma and all the goddesses  
of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,  
*Hindu Goddesses*, 1986.
