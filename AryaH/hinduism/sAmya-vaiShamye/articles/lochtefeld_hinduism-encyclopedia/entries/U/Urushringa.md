Architectural detail in the temple **architecture** of **Khajuraho**, one of the major  
forms of the northern Indian **Nagara**  
style. The Nagara style’s primary feature  
is a **shikhara**, or tower. This primary  
shikhara is often surrounded by smaller,  
subsidiary towers, to lead the eye up to  
the highest point, which is directly over  
the image of the temple’s primary **deity**.  
The urushringas are turrets built on the  
sides of these towers, whose shape replicates that of the tallest central tower and  
that serve to draw the eye upward to the  
highest tower.
