The latest textual stratum in the **Vedas**,  
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu  
religious texts. The literal meaning of the  
word *upanishad* is “to sit near [a  
teacher],” but a better sense of its true  
meaning would be “secret teaching.”  
The Upanishads mark a clean break  
from the immediately preceding Vedic  
literature, the **Brahmanas**, in which the  
essential concern was to lay out the  
concrete procedures for performing  
highly complex **sacrificial** rites. In contrast, the Upanishads were concerned  
with more speculative and abstract  
questions: the essential nature of the  
cosmos, the essence of the human  
being, and the relationship between  
these two. The conclusion in the  
Upanishads is that the essence of the  
universe is an impersonal reality known  
as **Brahman**, and that the essence of the  
human being is called the “Self”  
(**atman**). The fundamental insight and  
essential teaching in the Upanishads  
is the identity of Brahman and atman,  
and thus of the macrocosm and the  
microcosm. This identity is one of the  
most fundamental Hindu religious ideas  
and underlies religious thought up to  
the present time.  
The twelve or thirteen oldest upanishads are not a cohesive set but a series  
of independent documents, although  
the later ones were clearly influenced by  
the earlier ones. The two oldest are the  
**Brhadaranyaka Upanishad** and the  
**Chandogya Upanishad**. Each is much  
longer than all the others combined,  
they are written in prose as a series of  
dialogues between famous sages, the  
**Sanskrit** language in them is clearly  
more archaic, and their ideas are embryonic and undeveloped. Later upanishads—such as the **Isha**, **Kena**, **Katha**,  
**Prashna**, and **Mandukya**—are much  
shorter, are written in verse, and have  
well-developed ideas. Some of these  
introduce the notion of theism, but not  
until the **Shvetashvatara Upanishad** is  
the Supreme Being identified as a god,  
in this case **Rudra**. For much of their  
history, the Upanishads would have  
been transmitted orally from master to  
student; this makes it unlikely that these  
texts were widely known because they  
would have been secret and carefully  
guarded teachings.  
The Upanishads are important  
because of the speculative questions  
they ask and because many of their  
teachings are fundamental assumptions  
in Hindu religious life, even today: the  
notion of an eternal Self that gives a  
722  
Upanishad  
being continuous identity; the idea of  
reincarnation (**samsara**) commensurate  
with one’s deeds; the concept that some  
single unifying power lies behind the  
world’s apparent diversity; and the conviction that this can be attained only  
through individual realization, usually  
described as a flash of mystic insight. As  
texts carrying the religious authority of  
the Vedas, the Upanishads were also  
extremely important in the development of Hindu philosophical schools,  
particularly **Advaita Vedanta**, which  
shares this overriding emphasis on  
inner realization. For information on the  
Upanishads themselves, see Robert  
Ernest Hume (trans.), *Thirteen Principal*  
*Upanisads*, 1965. See also **philosophy**.
