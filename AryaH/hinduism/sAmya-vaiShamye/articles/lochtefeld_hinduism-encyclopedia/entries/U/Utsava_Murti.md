title = "Utsava Murti"

+++
(“festival image”) Image of a **deity** that is  
able (and intended) to be moved. These  
are used mainly during festivals, when  
the image of the deity is paraded around  
the town or city on the model of a kingly  
procession, symbolically surveying his  
or her realm. The other general class of  
Hindu images is the **sthala murti**,  
which is fixed in one place and never  
moves from it.
