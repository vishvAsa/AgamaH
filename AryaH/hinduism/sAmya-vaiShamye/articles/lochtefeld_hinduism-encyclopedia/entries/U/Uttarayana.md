title = "Uttarayana"

Term denoting the six months of the  
solar **year** in which the **sun** is believed to  
be moving northward. In the common  
era, this would be the period between  
the winter solstice and the summer solstice (roughly December 20 to June 20)  
and would be based on the actual  
motion of the sun with respect to the  
**earth**. The Indian solar year is based on  
the motion of the sun through the **zodiac**,  
which is calculated differently than in  
Western astrology. The uttarayana  
begins on **Makara Sankranti** (the **day**  
726  
Utpanna Ekadashi  
the sun is calculated as entering  
Capricorn, usually January 14) and ends  
the day before **Karka Sankranti** (the day  
the sun enters Cancer, usually calculated as July 14). The uttarayana is considered a more **auspicious** time than the  
**Dakshinayana** (in which the sun is traveling toward the south) because the  
guardian **deity** for the southern direction is **Yama**, who is death personified.
