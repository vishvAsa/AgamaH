title = "Utpanna Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waning) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Margashirsha** (November–December).  
As for all of the eleventh-day observances, this is dedicated to the **worship**  
of **Vishnu**, and on this day especially, in  
his form as **Krishna**. Most Hindu festivals have certain prescribed rites, which  
usually involve fasting (**upavasa**) and  
worship and often promise specific benefits for faithful performance. Those  
observing this vow should fast completely on the tenth and perform full  
worship during the **brahma muhurta** of  
the eleventh. On this ekadashi, only  
fruits should be offered as food for the  
**deity**. Faithfully keeping this festival is  
believed to bring liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). The name *Utpanna* means  
“born,” and the charter myth for this  
celebration is that of **Anasuya**, wife of  
the sage **Atri**. Anasuya is famous for her  
devotion to her husband, and the wives  
of the gods become jealous of her.  
**Lakshmi**, **Parvati**, and **Saraswati** send  
their husbands (Vishnu, **Shiva**, and  
**Brahma**) to try to compromise her  
fidelity; the gods come **begging** for food,  
but they refuse to accept it unless  
Anasuya gives it to them naked. Through  
the power she has gained from her devotion to her husband, Anasuya turns the  
three gods into infants and then nurses  
them until they are satisfied; these three  
gods are later “born” into her household:  
Vishnu as **Dattatreya**, Shiva as **Durvasas**,  
and Brahma as **Chandra**.
