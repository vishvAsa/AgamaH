Northern Indian **brahmin** group that  
makes up one of the five northern brahmin communities (**Pancha Gauda**); the  
other four are the **Kanaujias**, the  
**Maithilas**, the **Gaudas**, and the  
**Saraswats**. Utkala brahmins are found  
only in the coastal regions of **Orissa**, on  
the Bay of Bengal, but their ritual control over the pilgrimage sites there, particularly the city of **Puri**, have helped  
them remain a significant group.
