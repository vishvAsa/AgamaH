title = "Uttararamacharita"

+++
(“Later Acts of **Rama**”) Drama written by  
the **Sanskrit** playwright **Bhavabhuti**  
(8th c.), which retells the story of the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
Sanskrit epics. Bhavabhuti’s play largely  
follows the plot of the original **Valmiki**  
*Ramayana*, with one important difference. Valmiki’s text ends with Rama’s  
banishing **Sita** because of suspicions  
about her virtue and Sita’s being swallowed up by the **earth**, which is her  
mother and witness to her chastity. The  
*Uttararamacharita*, on the other hand,  
ends with a complete reconciliation  
between Rama and Sita. This change  
may have been prompted solely by the  
desire for a happy ending, which is one  
of the characteristic features of Sanskrit  
drama. It may also indicate that some  
people were not comfortable with the  
moral ambiguities of the original text, in  
which Rama, although claimed to be  
divine, sometimes acts in unscrupulous  
and disturbing ways.
