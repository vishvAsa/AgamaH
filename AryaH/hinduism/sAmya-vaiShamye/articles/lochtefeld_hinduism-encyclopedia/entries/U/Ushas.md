title = "Ushas"

+++
In the **Vedas**, the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu religious texts,  
Ushas is a **goddess** associated and  
sometimes identified with the dawn.  
She is described as lighting the path for  
the **sun** and driving away the darkness  
and evil; her presence is thus associated  
with the regularity of the cosmic order.  
Ushas is most notable not for what she  
does—she is a minor **deity**, mentioned  
in only a handful of the Vedic hymns—  
but because she is one of the few goddesses in the Vedas. The virtual absence  
of female divinities in the Vedas is one of  
the factors behind the notion that the  
great Goddess, one of the three major  
deities in later religious life, has her  
roots in indigenous goddess **worship**.

the goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.
