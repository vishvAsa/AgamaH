Urdhvapundra  
An ascetic with the urdhvapundra mark on his forehead.  
It consists of three vertical lines and indicates that he is a devotee of the god Vishnu.  
a vow of **celibacy**, particularly a lifelong  
vow. In the Hindu tradition, celibacy is  
important not only for removing one  
from enjoying the pleasures of the flesh  
but because on a more basic level,  
semen is considered the concentrated  
essence of a man’s vital energies.  
Expending semen is necessary for procreation, but otherwise it should be  
retained, as a way to conserve one’s vital  
forces. In popular belief, when a man  
has been celibate for a certain time, the  
semen is drawn upward to the brain,  
where it nourishes one’s intellectual  
and spiritual faculties.
