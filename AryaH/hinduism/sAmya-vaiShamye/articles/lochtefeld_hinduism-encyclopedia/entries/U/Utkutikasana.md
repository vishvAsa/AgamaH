title = "Utkutikasana"

+++
Sitting posture (**asana**) in **yoga** practice  
in which the legs are contracted, with  
the soles of the feet pressed against each  
other and the outer part of the feet and  
legs flat on the ground. This posture is  
the one in which images of the **deities**  
are portrayed in Hindu iconography,  
and it seems to be the position called  
samasthana in the commentaries to the  
**Yoga Sutras**. This position is also  
notable because it appears to be portrayed on one of the seals from the  
**Indus Valley civilization**; the figure in  
this position is the mysterious horned  
725  
Utkutikasana  
deity that some viewers have sought to  
identify as a “proto-**Shiva**.”
