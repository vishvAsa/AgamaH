(“service”) General term denoting religious practice or spiritual discipline as a  
whole. Aside from the explicit notion of  
serving the **deity** (or **guru**), the word  
also connotes an intent focus on the  
part of the performer—not so much the  
particular things one is doing, but the  
overall attitude of care and attention  
with which one does them.
