(“analogy”) According to some philosophical schools, upamana was one of  
the **pramanas**, or the means by which  
human beings can gain true and accurate knowledge. The classic example of  
this pramana describes a traveler going  
to a certain region who is told that he  
will encounter a certain animal that  
looks somewhat like a cow; upon going  
there this analogy helps him identify the  
animal. Some philosophical schools  
deny that this is a separate pramana  
and classify it as a variety of inference  
(**anumana**). Those who accept it as a  
fourth pramana—primarily the **NyayaVaisheshika** school—stress that according to the rules of inference, a valid  
inference must be grounded in previous  
perceptions. In the case of the traveler,  
his ability to identify is not based on  
any differences drawn from previous  
perceptions of that type of animal, since  
he has never before seen the type of  
animal he actually encounters. He  
knows what it is because it looks  
“somewhat like a cow.” Thus an  
additional pramana was needed to  
account for this. See also **philosophy**.
