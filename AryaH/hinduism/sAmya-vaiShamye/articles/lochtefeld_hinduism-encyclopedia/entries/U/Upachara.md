(“honoring,” “entertaining”) In its literal  
meaning, this word denotes the act of  
showing politeness, courtesy, or honor  
to any superior. In the context of **worship**, the meaning has been extended to  
refer to the things that are normally  
offered to the **deity** as part of the standard hospitality that would be offered to  
any honored guest. Although there are  
differing enumerations of these **offerings**, one of the most common lists has  
sixteen of them: summoning (**avahana**),  
offering a seat (**asana**), water for washing the feet (**padya**), thirst-quenching  
beverages (**arghya**), water for rinsing the  
mouth (**achamaniya**), bathing (**snana**),  
clothing (**vastra**), affixing the **sacred**  
**thread** (yajnopavit), fragrant unguents  
(**anulepana**), flowers (**pushpa**), incense  
(**dhupa**), lamp (**dipa**), food (**naivedya**),  
reverential salutation (**namaskara**), circumambulation (**pradakshina**), and  
dismissal (**visarjana**). To give all sixteen  
offerings is a long and detailed ritual,  
and the most common of the offerings is  
the eleventh, the offering of light, which  
is also known as **arati**.
