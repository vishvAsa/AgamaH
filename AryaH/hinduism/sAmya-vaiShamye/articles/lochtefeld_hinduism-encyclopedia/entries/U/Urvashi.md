title = "Urvashi"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a particular celestial nymph (**apsara**) who is most famous  
for her association with King **Pururavas**.  
Urvashi comes to stay with Pururavas  
under several conditions, including that  
she should never see him naked. When  
she has been gone from **heaven** for a  
while, the god **Indra** notices her absence  
and schemes to get her back. One night  
he sends several minor **deities** to steal  
two lambs of which Urvashi is very fond,  
and when Pururavas leaps up to regain  
them, a flash of lightning reveals him  
naked, and Urvashi leaves him. They are  
separate for some time but are eventually  
reunitedâ€”in some accounts for good,  
and in others for only one night a year.
