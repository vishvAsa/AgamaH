title = "Urdhvapundra"

+++
Name denoting the characteristic forehead mark (**tika**) worn by the **ascetic**  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**.  
The urdhvapundra’s basic pattern is  
made of three vertical lines, in contrast  
to the three horizontal lines worn by the  
**Sanyasis**, who are devotees of **Shiva**.  
There are many variations in the design,  
and many different materials can be  
used: sandalwood paste, white clay, yellow clay, and red vermilion. The only  
thing that is never used is the sacred ash  
(**vibhuti**) characteristic of the Sanyasis.  
The design and materials used for the  
urdhvapundra are quite distinctive  
among various **Vaishnava** ascetic communities, and from this, one can easily  
identify a particular ascetic’s affiliation.
