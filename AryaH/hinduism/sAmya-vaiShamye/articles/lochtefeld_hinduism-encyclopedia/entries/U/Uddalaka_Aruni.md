title = "Uddalaka Aruni"

+++
A character in the **Chandogya**  
**Upanishad**, one of the speculative texts  
that form the latest stratum of the  
**Vedas**. In the upanishad, Uddalaka is  
the father and teacher of the boy  
**Shvetaketu** Aruneya, and the two are a  
model for the transmission of secret  
teachings passed between **guru** and disciple. According to a story in the upanishad’s sixth chapter, Shvetaketu is sent  
away by his father to study the Vedas,  
and when he returns twelve years later,  
having mastered all the Vedas, he incorrectly considers himself learned. His  
father punctures his arrogance by asking  
Shvetaketu questions about the nature  
of the cosmos and thus shows him the  
difference between memorization and  
true knowledge. When Shvetaketu  
cannot answer these, he admits his  
ignorance and accepts instruction from  
his father on the nature of the Self  
(**atman**). This instruction contains the  
teaching “That thou art” (**Tat tvam asi**).  
This is one of the “great statements”  
(**mahavakya**) in Indian **philosophy** and  
asserts the ultimate identity between  
**Brahman** and atman, the cosmos and  
the individual Self.
