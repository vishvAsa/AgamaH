title = "Udgatr"

+++
Type of sacrificial priest in the  
**Brahmana** literature, one of the later  
strands in the sacred literature known as  
the **Vedas**. The Brahmanas largely functioned as manuals describing how to  
perform sacrificial rites—which primarily involved burning **offerings** in a  
sacred **fire**—and the care and attention  
devoted to detailing these **sacrifices**  
leads to the inference that these were  
the primary religious act. These rites  
were so complex that they required specialized ritual technicians: the  
**adhvaryum**, the **hotr**, the udgatr, and  
the **brahman**. Of these, the udgatr was  
the sacrificial priest who chanted the  
hymns from the **Sama Veda** that were  
used in the sacrifice.
