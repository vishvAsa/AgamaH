title = "Udana"

+++
In traditional Indian physiology, one of  
the five bodily “**winds**” considered to be  
responsible for basic bodily functions,  
the others being **prana**, **apana**, **vyana**,  
and **samana**. The udana wind is considered to reside in the throat and to be the  
force that conveys things out of the  
mouth—primarily speech and song, but  
also burps and (presumably) vomit.
