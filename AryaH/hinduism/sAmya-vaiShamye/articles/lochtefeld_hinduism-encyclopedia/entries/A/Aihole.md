title = "Aihole"

+++
Historical site in the state of **Karnataka**,  
just south of the modern city of Bijapur.  
Aihole was an important city during the  
**Chalukya dynasty** (4thâ€“8th c. C.E.), and its  
surviving buildings are some of the oldest  
standing Hindu temples. These temples  
represent an early stage in the **evolution** of  
Hindu **architecture** from earlier architectural forms, such as the rock-cut cave temple (**chaitya**) or enclosed courtyard  
(**vihara**). One of the earliest temples (ca.  
450 C.E.) is a simple square pavilion (**mandapa**) with a tower (**shikhara**) over the  
main image of the **deity**, one of the hallmarks of later Hindu temples. A temple to  
**Durga** built about a century later has the  
general plan of a chaitya, but a shikhara  
was also added. Although the temples at  
Aihole are related to the earlier forms, they  
also prefigure the mature development of  
medieval Hindu architecture.
