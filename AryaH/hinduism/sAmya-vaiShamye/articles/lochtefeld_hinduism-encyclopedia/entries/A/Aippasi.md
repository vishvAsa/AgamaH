Seventh month in the Tamil solar **year**,  
corresponding to the northern Indian solar  
month of Tula (the zodiacal sign  
of Libra), which according to the Indian  
**calendar** usually falls within October and  
November. The existence of several different calendars is one clear sign of the continuing importance of regional cultural  
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain  
their culture is by preserving their traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the few  
regional languages in India with an  
ancient, well-established literary tradition.
