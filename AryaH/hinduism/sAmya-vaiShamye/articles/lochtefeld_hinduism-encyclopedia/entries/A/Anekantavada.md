One of the three **causal models** in  
Indian **philosophy**, along with  
**asatkaryavada** and **satkaryavada**. All  
three models seek to explain the workings of causality in the everyday world,  
particularly the relationship between  
causes and their effects, which has  
profound implications for religious  
life. Philosophical theory assumes  
that if one understands the causal  
process correctly and can manipulate  
it through one’s conscious actions, it  
is possible to gain final liberation of  
the soul (**moksha**). Disagreements  
over differing causal models are  
grounded in varying assumptions  
about the nature of things.  
The asatkaryavada model assumes  
that effects do not preexist in their  
causes; the satkaryavada model  
assumes that they do. The third model,  
Anekantavada (“the view that things  
are not single”), seeks to occupy the  
middle ground between these two.  
Anekantavada stresses how one  
looks at things and the way that this  
can color a judgment. In viewing the  
transformation of milk to curds, butter,  
and clarified butter, an anekantavada  
proponent would claim that the  
substances in question were contained  
in the causes (supporting the  
satkaryavada notion), but that the  
qualities each of these substances possessed were newly created each time  
(supporting the asatkaryavada notion).  
Thus, causes and effects are simultaneously both the same and different,  
depending on the lens through which  
one looks at them. This theory is an  
attempt to find a middle ground  
between the other two causal models  
by showing that each is possible, but it  
runs the risk of being seen as not taking  
any position at all. The major proponents of this position are the Jains, who  
are outside the scope of the present  
work. For further information see Karl
