title = "Appar"

+++
(7th c. C.E.) One of the earliest of the  
**Nayanars**, a group of southern Indian  
poet-saints who were devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**. The Nayanars helped  
to revitalize the Hindu religion through  
their passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a  
personal god, conveyed through hymns  
sung in the **Tamil language**.  
Historians believe that Appar was born  
into a Shaivite family but became a Jain  
**ascetic** in his youth. The turning point  
came when he suffered a serious illness.  
Discouraged when Jain medicines were  
unable to cure his illness, he prayed to  
Shiva for help and was cured.  
Along with his younger contemporary  
**Sambandar**, Appar actively confronted  
and opposed the heterodox sects of the  
times, particularly the Jains, with open  
defiance, debates, and miracles. His greatest achievement is reported to have been  
the conversion of King **Mahendravarman**  
(r. 600–630 C.E.), one of the greatest kings  
48  
Apabhramsha  
in the **Pallava dynasty**, from Jainism  
to Shaivism.  
The collected hymns of the three most  
important Nayanars—Appar, Sambandar,  
and **Sundaramurtti**—comprise the  
**Devaram**, the most sacred of the Tamil  
Shaivite texts.
