(“conduct”) Appropriate or approved  
behavior according to customary law,  
which is established in the **dharma literature**. The **dharma** assumes that society is made up of different social  
subgroups known as **jatis**, which are  
usually defined (and hierarchically  
arranged) by the group’s hereditary  
occupation. Each jati had its own customary code of appropriate behavior,  
and there were often sharp differences  
between them. For example, it was often  
acceptable for members of lower-status  
jatis to eat meat and drink **liquor**,  
whereas these practices were forbidden  
to higher-status groups. Aside from the  
customary rules of one’s social group or  
subgroup, notions of appropriate  
behavior for a particular person would  
also be shaped by age and gender considerations: A young and sexually fertile  
**woman** would be subject to far greater  
restrictions than a postmenopausal  
woman, since any sexual scandal (or  
even the hint of it) could ruin a young
