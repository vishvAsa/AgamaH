(“intermediate space”) The antarala  
was a transitional space between a  
temple’s main hall and the inner sanctum (**garbhagrha**), where the image of  
the temple’s primary **deity** would be  
housed. The antarala is characteristic  
of **Nagara architecture**, which is one  
of three primary styles of Hindu temples. This space was found only in the  
largest temples and in many smaller  
ones was omitted entirely.
