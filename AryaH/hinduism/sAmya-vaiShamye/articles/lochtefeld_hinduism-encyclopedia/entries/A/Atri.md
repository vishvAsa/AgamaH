title = "Atri"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Atri is one of the  
six **sons** of **Brahma**, all of whom  
become great sages. All are “mindborn,” meaning that Brahma’s  
thoughts are enough to bring them  
into being. The others are **Marichi**,  
**Angiras**, **Pulastya**, **Pulaha**, and **Kratu**.  
Atri is also cited as one of the seven  
sages; the others are **Kashyapa**,  
**Bhrgu**, **Vasishtha**, **Gautama**,  
**Bharadvaja**, and **Vishvamitra**. All  
**brahmins** are believed to be descended  
from these seven sages, with each  
family taking the name of its progenitor as its **gotra** name.  
In modern times, these gotra  
divisions are still important, since  
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.  
After her marriage the new bride  
adopts her husband’s gotra as part  
of her new identity. See also  
**marriage prohibitions**.
