(“going”) In the estimation of the  
Hindu **calendar**, the word *ayana* refers  
to the movement of the **sun** during its  
yearly course, which is divided according to the direction of the sun’s movement. The six months that the sun  
moves in a northerly direction is called  
the **uttarayana**, and its southward  
movement in the following six months  
is the **dakshinayana**. The transition  
points at which the sun changes direction do not fall on the solstices, as figured in the Gregorian calendar, but  
about three **weeks** later on **Makara**  
**Sankranti** (around January 14) and  
**Karka Sankranti** (around July 14).  
The sun’s northward journey is  
considered a more **auspicious** time  
than the southward journey, although  
many other factors can influence the  
judgment of a particular **day**.
