title = "Anjana"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Hindu epics, Anjana is the  
mother of the monkey-**deity Hanuman**.  
In her previous birth, Anjana was a  
**goddess**, but as the result of a **curse**, she  
is born as a monkey. With the birth of  
Hanuman (fathered by **Vayu**, the god of  
**wind**), the curse was lifted and she  
returned to **heaven**.
