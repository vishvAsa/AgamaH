title = "Aghori"

+++
In one context this term refers to one of  
the two loosely organized groups of the  
**Jogi ascetics**, the other being the  
**Nathpanthis**. There are three major  
groups of ascetics devoted to the god  
**Shiva**; they are the Aghoris, Nathpanthis,  
and **Dashanami Sanyasis**. The difference  
between these is that the Dashanamis are  
said to have been founded by the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**, while the  
Aghoris and Nathpanthis are believed to  
be descended from earlier **Shaiva** ascetic  
orders, particularly the **Kapalikas**,  
**Kalamukhas**, and **Pashupatas**. The term  
*aghori* also refers to ascetics whose  
reputed practices make them both  
respected and feared by the general population. The Aghoris draw their name  
from one of the names of the god Shiva,  
Aghora, which despite its literal meaning  
(“not terrifying”), designates one of the  
most frightful and powerful forms of  
Shiva. As devotees (**bhakta**) of this form  
of Shiva, the Aghoris are famous for their  
disregard of all social conventions and  
boundaries. They often eat from a vessel  
made of a human skull and are popularly  
reputed to eat anything, including dung  
and human flesh. Such behavior generates fascination and sometimes respect  
among the larger Hindu populace, but  
also considerable fear; Aghoris are so far  
outside the normal social boundaries  
that most people would rather avoid  
interaction with them.
