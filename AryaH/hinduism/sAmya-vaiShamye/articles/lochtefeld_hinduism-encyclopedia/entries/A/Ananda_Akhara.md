title = "Ananda Akhara"

+++
The name of a specific group of the **Naga**  
class of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, a particular type of renunciant **ascetic**. The  
Dashanami Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**, organized into six different **akharas** or regiments on the  
model of an army. Until the beginning of  
the nineteenth century, the Nagasâ€™ primary occupation was as mercenary soldiers, although they also had substantial  
trading interests; both of these occupations have largely disappeared in contemporary times.  
For organizational purposes, the  
Ananda akhara is considered a subsidiary of the powerful **Niranjani**  
**akhara**, one of the other seven akharas.  
All of the groups have particular  
features that define their organizational  
identity, especially specific tutelary  
**deities**; the tutelary deity of the Ananda  
akhara is **fire**.
