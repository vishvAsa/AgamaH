(“unbroken recitation”) The unbroken  
recitation of an entire religious text,  
which is believed to bring religious benefits; individuals may perform such  
recitations for their own benefit, or they  
may hire another person to perform the  
recitation for them. The benefits of this  
action are believed to come from the  
perceived power of the sacred text itself.  
The recitation may be done as a pious  
act, simply for the merit in sponsoring  
it, or as part of a festival observance; it  
may also be a last resort in times of dire  
emergencies or a religious act performed after a death in the family. One  
of the texts often recited without a break  
is the **Ramcharitmanas**, a retelling of  
the **Ramayana** by the sixteenth-century  
poet-saint **Tulsidas**; in the Sikh community, the **Adigranth** is recited.
