title = "Aranyaka"

+++
(“Forest books”) General designation for  
a type of literature contained in the  
sacred texts known as the **Vedas**. The  
Aranyakas are transitional in nature; in  
their content they move away from the  
focus on ritual and **sacrifice** found in  
the **Brahmana** literature and foreshadow the later, more speculative texts  
known as the **Upanishads**.  
Because of their name, the  
Aranyakas are widely believed to have  
been composed in the forests, perhaps  
by **ascetics** who had left formal society. The tone in these texts is questioning and speculative, and in stylistic  
terms there is no clear break between  
the Aranyakas and the Upanishads:  
one of the earliest upanishads is  
named **Brhadaranyaka** (“Great  
Forest-Book”) **Upanishad**, which reinforces the connection.

An arati lamp is waved before an image of the god Ganesh before the statue is immersed in water.  
The light from the flame is considered a religious offering.
