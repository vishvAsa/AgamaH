(“to be sipped”) The fifth of the sixteen  
traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”)  
given to a **deity** as part of **worship**, on  
the model of treating the god as an honored guest. In this upachara, the deity is  
offered **water** for rinsing and cleaning  
the mouth. The actual act of offering can  
be done in various ways and often  
depends on the worshiper’s inclinations.  
In some cases the water vessel will simply be presented before the deity’s  
image, with the understanding that the  
water has been taken, whereas in other  
cases the devotee (**bhakta**) will actually  
rinse the image’s mouth. In either case  
the underlying motive is to show love for  
the deity and to minister to its needs.
