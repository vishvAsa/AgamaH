title = "Ambedkar, Dr Bhim Rao"

+++
(1891–1956) Thinker, writer, and  
social activist whose worldview always  
reflected his birth as a **Mahar**, a **caste** of  
**untouchables** in the state of  
**Maharashtra**. Ambedkar’s father had  
joined the British army, which brought  
the family enough social mobility for  
Bhim Rao to get an education: a B.A. in  
Bombay, an M.A. and Ph.D. from  
Columbia University in New York City,  
and a D.Sc. from London University. He  
also passed the British bar exam.  
Ambedkar spent his life fighting for the  
rights of the untouchable classes,  
through both political lobbying and  
social action. In 1932, through his  
efforts, untouchables were given a separate electorate as a **minority** group.  
**Mohandas Gandhi** was bitterly opposed  
to removing untouchables from the  
larger Hindu body politic and began a  
fast unto death. In the end Ambedkar  
relented, but for the rest of his life he  
maintained that Gandhi had used the  
untouchables as pawns in India’s political struggles with Britain. Ambedkar  
claimed that for untouchables there was  
no material difference between  
Gandhi’s practices and traditional caste  
Hinduism, because rather than having  
any real political power, the untouchables had to continue relying on the  
“goodwill” of Hindus to look after their  
needs. Ambedkar played an important  
role in the formation of the Republic of  
India, including being called upon to  
author its constitution, but social  
inequality continued to rankle him. In  
1956 he and many of his followers formally converted to Buddhism as a way  
to leave the caste system behind. These  
“neo-Buddhists” still exist, and despite  
their relatively small numbers, their militancy makes them an important group.
