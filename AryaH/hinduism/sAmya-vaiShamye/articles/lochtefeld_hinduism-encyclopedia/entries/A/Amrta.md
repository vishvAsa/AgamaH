title = "Amrta"

+++
(“imperishable”) In Hindu mythology  
this is the nectar of immortality, which is  
churned from the Ocean of Milk through  
the combined efforts of the gods and the  
**demons**. The word is also used  
metaphorically to describe anything  
believed to be especially purifying and  
powerful, such as **charanamrta** (“foot  
nectar”). Charanamrta are the liquids  
(milk, **water**, etc.) given to devotees  
(**bhakta**) to drink, which are often the  
fluids in which their **guru’s** feet or the  
image of a **deity** have been bathed. See  
also **Tortoise avatar**.
