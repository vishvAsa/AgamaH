title = "Arghya"

+++
The fourth of the sixteen traditional  
**upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to a **deity**  
as a part of **worship**. The upacharas are  
based on the model of treating the deity  
as an honored guest. The word *arghya*  
literally means “to be respected”; in this  
offering the image is given a drink of  
**water** or some other beverage as a sign  
of respect.  
The actual act of offering can be  
done in various ways and often depends  
on the worshiper’s preferences. In some  
cases the water vessel will simply be presented before the deity’s image, with the  
understanding that the deity has taken  
it, whereas in other cases the devotee  
(**bhakta**) will actually give some water to  
the image. In either case the underlying  
motive is to show love for the deity and  
to minister to its needs.
