title = "Avatar"

(“descent”) In Hindu mythology, the  
descent (of a **deity**), but more colloquially the incarnation, of a deity on **earth**.  
The concept of avatars has been best  
developed by the devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Vishnu**, who perceive him as  
taking a specific form to help the world.  
Examples of avatars can be found for  
other divinities as well.  
Hindus draw a distinction between  
full avatars, which have the complete  
power of the deity, and partial incarnations, or **anshavatars**. Vishnu has ten  
full avatars, each of whom has appeared  
to restore the cosmic balance when the

Avalon, Arthur  
The ten avatars of the god Vishnu. In Hindu mythology, Vishnu has appeared on earth in different forms:  
Fish, Tortoise, Boar, Man-lion, Vamana (dwarf), Parashuram, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki.  
world has fallen out of equilibrium. The  
root cause of such disequilibrium is usually a **demon** (asura) who has grown too  
strong and uses that power to oppress  
others. This imbalance prompts Vishnu  
to take form as an avatar, destroy the  
evildoers, and definitively restore the  
cosmic balance.  
Although there is some variation in  
the list of Vishnu’s avatars, the generally  
accepted list is as follows: **Fish**, **Tortoise**,  
**Boar**, **Man-Lion**, **Vamana** (dwarf ),  
**Parashuram**, **Rama**, **Krishna**, **Buddha**,  
and **Kalki**. This list of avatars follows an  
“evolutionary” sequence—the first three  
are **animals**, the fourth a hybrid mananimal, and the ones after that mythic  
heroes and sages; the exception is the  
Buddha, a real person who has been  
incorporated into the Hindu pantheon.  
The tenth form, Kalki avatar, is yet to  
come, and his coming will herald the  
end of the age. Vishnu’s partial avatars—  
as sages, saints, and gods—are countless  
and potentially limitless, providing a  
ready-made way for new Hindu movements to ascribe divine authority to  
their founders.  
Although the avatar concept is most  
commonly associated with Vishnu, it  
has been applied to other Hindu gods as  
well. One example of partial avatars can  
be seen in the **Mahabharata**, the later of  
the two great Hindu epics, in which all  
five of the **Pandava** brothers are partial  
incarnations of various gods. In addition, devotees of the god **Shiva** have  
developed a list of his twenty-one  
avatars, who are saints, sages, and minor  
deities. This list was probably developed  
in response to the **Vaishnava** doctrine of  
avatars, but Shiva’s forms are far less  
important than Vishnu’s; Vishnu’s  
avatars include Rama and Krishna,  
who are major objects of **worship** in  
their own right.  
For the Vaishnavas, the avatar  
doctrine is generally seen as a way  
to assimilate existing cults into  
the pantheon by claiming that  
various deities are merely different  
manifestations of Vishnu. The **Shaiva**  
avatars were developed much later,  
essentially so that Shiva would also  
have these forms. See also **Jagannath**  
and **Balarama**.
