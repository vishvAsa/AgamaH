(“bliss”) One of the three traditional  
attributes of the Supreme Reality  
(**Brahman**), usually described as beingconsciousness-bliss (**sacchidananda**).  
Ananda, or bliss, is heavily stressed in  
certain forms of **tantra**, an esoteric ritual tradition. In tantra, ananda is both an  
aspect of mundane physical enjoyment  
and a way of describing the ultimate  
realization. In this understanding, even  
ordinary pleasures are reflections of ultimate bliss. Ultimate bliss differs from  
ordinary pleasure both because it is permanent, and because you lose your  
sense of self and are aware only of bliss.
