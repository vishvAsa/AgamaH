(2) In the region of Tamil, which lies at  
the southern tip of the subcontinent on  
the Bay of Bengal, the month of Ani is  
the third month of the solar **year**. It corresponds to the northern Indian solar  
month of **Mithuna** (the zodiacal sign of  
Gemini), which usually falls within June  
and July. The existence of several different calendars is one clear sign of the  
continuing importance of regional cultural patterns. One way that the Tamils  
retain their culture is by preserving their  
traditional **calendar**. Tamil is one of the  
few regional languages in India with an  
ancient, well-established literary tradition. See also **Tamil months**, **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, and **Tamil language**.
