+++
One of the eight ways to perform  
a marriage recognized in the **Dharma**  
**Shastras**, the treatises on religious  
duty (**dharma**). In an arsha marriage,  
the brideâ€™s father receives a pair of cattle  
from the bridegroom with the understanding that the cattle are to be used  
for sacrifice.

Arranged Marriage  
This was regarded as one of the four  
approved forms of marriage (**prashasta**  
**marriages**) but fell out of favor because  
of the stigma of accepting any sort of gift  
for the bride, even one explicitly designated for sacrifice. The form was named  
after the **rishis** (sages) because of the  
implicit sacrificial rites. See also **marriage, eight classical forms**.
