title = "Adhvaryum"

+++
A type of sacrificial priest described in  
the **Brahmana** literature, one of the later  
strands of the sacred literature known as  
the **Vedas**. The Brahmanas largely functioned as manuals describing how to  
perform sacrificial rites—which primarily involved burning **offerings** in a  
sacred **fire**—and the care and attention  
devoted to detailing these **sacrifices**,  
which leads to the inference that these  
were the primary religious acts. These  
rites were so complex that they  
required specialized ritual technicians: the adhvaryum, the **hotr**, the  
**udgatr**, and the **brahman**. The  
adhvaryum was the sacrificial priest  
who chanted the hymns from the  
**Yajur Veda** that were used in the **sacrifice**. He was also responsible for  
preparing the sacred altar, assembling  
the sacrificial materials, kindling and  
feeding the sacred fire, and actually  
offering the sacrificial **animals**.
