title = "Agnipradakshinam"

+++
(“circling the **fire**”) A common rite in  
many modern Hindu **marriage ceremonies**, usually performed as part of  
the **saptapadi**, in which the bride and  
groom take seven steps to definitively  
seal their marriage. The saptapadi and  
the agnipradakshinam are combined so  
that the bride and groom make seven  
revolutions around a small fire. As the  
god **Agni**, the fire is the divine witness to  
the marriage bond between bride and  
groom, a bond often symbolized by  
tying the end of the groom’s turban to  
the fringe of the bride’s sari. The fire is  
also a sign that the celebration of marriage is a **yajna**, or sacrificial rite.
