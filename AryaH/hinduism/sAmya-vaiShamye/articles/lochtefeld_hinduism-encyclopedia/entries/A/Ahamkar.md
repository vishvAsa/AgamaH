title = "Ahamkar"

+++
(“I-making”) In the **Samkhya** school of  
Hindu **philosophy**, ahamkar is one of  
the stages in the **evolution** of **prakrti**  
(primal matter) away from its initial  
undifferentiated unity toward differentiation of the Self and other things.  
The final result of this degradation  
is the world that we see around us,  
in which human souls are subject to

Ahamkar  
reincarnation (**samsara**). Prakrti evolves  
first into **mahat** (“the great one”) and  
then into ahamkar, which is the  
first stage in which there is a sense  
of self and subjectivity. This  
sense of subjectivity colors the entire  
devolution after that. Ahamkar  
then evolves further, forming the  
basis for both the subjective and  
objectice world: on one hand, the  
individual’s organs of sense  
(**jnanendriya**) and organs of action  
(**karmendriya**) develop, and on the  
other hand, the five subtle  
**elements** (**tanmatras**), which are  
the basis of the gross material  
elements, evolve. In colloquial speech,  
*ahamkar* is used to mean “self-pride,”  
invariably in a pejorative sense.
