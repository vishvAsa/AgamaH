title = "Aravalli Hills"

+++
A range of hills running diagonally from  
the southwestern to the northeastern  
corner of **Rajasthan**. They are important  
for their physical characteristics, which  
have a profound effect on the environment. On the northern side of the hills,  
the land slopes gently into the Thar  
desert and is arid and thinly settled. On  
the southern side, the hills provide  
more protection. As a result the land is  
greener and comparatively richer than  
on the northern side.  
Sacred sites (**tirthas**) in the Aravallis  
include the town of **Pushkar**, with its  
holy lake, as well as the temple devoted  
to **Balaji**, which is located in the village  
of **Mehndipur**.
