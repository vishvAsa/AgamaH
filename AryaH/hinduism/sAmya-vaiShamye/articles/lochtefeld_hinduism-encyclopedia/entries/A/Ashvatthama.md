title = "Ashvatthama"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Ashvatthama is the  
**son** of **Drona**. When Drona becomes the  
archery teacher to the **Pandavas** and the  
**Kauravas**, the epic’s two central royal  
families, Ashvatthama also receives  
instruction along with the young  
princes. He absorbs his father’s teaching  
well and masters the use of terrifying  
magical weapons. During the  
*Mahabharata’s* climactic civil war, he  
fights on the side of the Kauravas and  
kills many of the Pandava allies; this  
includes **Dhrshtadyumna**, who has earlier killed his father, Drona. After the war  
is over, Ashvatthama retires to the forest  
with the sage **Vyasa**.
