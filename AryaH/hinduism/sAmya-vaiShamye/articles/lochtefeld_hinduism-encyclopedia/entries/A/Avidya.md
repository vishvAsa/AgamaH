title = "Avidya"

+++
(“lack of [true] knowledge”) Avidya is  
the absence of true understanding  
and is the fundamental problem in  
almost all Hindu philosophical and  
religious thought. The presence of  
avidya leads people to misperceive the  
true nature of reality and to act based on  
these misperceptions.  
The most fundamental of these false  
perceptions is to identify the eternal Self  
(**atman**) with the body. As a result of this  
misidentification, egoism leads one to  
try to protect and advance the Self (in its  
particular embodied state) and incites  
feelings and actions of greed, lust, and  
hatred. These feelings create bondage  
for the soul and entrap it in **samsara**, the  
cycle of rebirth.  
In most Hindu philosophical  
schools, the avidya tends to be conceived in epistemological rather than  
metaphysical terms—that is, it is not an  
actual thing in its own right but exists  
as a function of how one comes to  
know things, insofar as that knowledge  
is inaccurate or incomplete. Once one’s  
deficient awareness has been corrected,  
the cause of bondage is removed,  
resulting in the final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**).
