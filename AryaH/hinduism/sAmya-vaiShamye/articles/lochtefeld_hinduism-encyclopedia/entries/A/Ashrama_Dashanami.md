title = "Ashrama Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasis**, renunciant ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**. The Dashanamis  
were supposedly established by the ninthcentury philosopher **Shankaracharya** in an  
effort to create a corps of learned men who  
could help to revitalize Hindu life. Each of  
the divisions is designated by a different  
name—in this case, *ashrama* (“hermitage”).  
Upon **initiation**, new members are given  
this name as a surname to their new  
ascetic names, thus allowing for immediate  
group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten “named” divisions are divided  
into four larger organizational groups.  
Each group has its headquarters in one of  
the four monastic centers (**maths**) supposedly established by Shankaracharya,  
as well as other particular religious associations. The Ashrama Dashanamis belong  
to the **Kitawara** group, which is affiliated  
with the **Sharada Math** in the city of  
**Dwaraka**, located near the Arabian Sea.  
The Ashrama division is considered  
an elite group because it is one of the few  
that will initiate only **brahmins** (the  
other such divisions are the **Saraswati**  
**Dashanamis**, **Tirtha Dashanamis**, and  
part of the **Bharati Dashanamis**.)
