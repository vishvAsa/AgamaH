title = "Asthi-Visarjana"

+++
(“scattering the bones”) Name for a particular ceremony performed as one of the last  
rites (**antyeshthi samskara**) connected  
with death. In this ritual, bits of bone and  
ash collected from the **cremation** site in  
the rite of **asthi-sanchayana** are immersed  
in the **waters** of the **Ganges** or some other  
sacred river. This is the final ceremony  
for the dead, since in earlier times the  
collected remains might be kept for years  
before a family member was able to bring  
them to a pilgrimage place (**tirtha**) to perform this rite. Modern transportation has  
changed this pattern somewhat, making it  
more common for asthi-visarjana to be  
carried out immediately after death but  
before the **sapindikarana** ceremony on  
the twelfth day.  
This rite is still widely performed in  
modern India and remains important for  
at least two reasons: On one hand, there is  
the symbolism of redemption for the dead  
through consigning their ashes to the  
sacred waters, and on the other, providing  
definitive ritual closure for the living.
