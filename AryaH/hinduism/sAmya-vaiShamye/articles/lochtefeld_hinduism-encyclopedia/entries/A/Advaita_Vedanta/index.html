  <meta property="og:description" content="One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the Vedas.
The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality lies behind all things. Advaita
proponents believe that reality is nondual (advaita)—that is, that everything
in the world is actually the formless,
unqualified Brahman, despite the
appearance of difference and diversity.
To support this claim, the Advaitins provide a convincing explanation for the
world one perceives to have many separate and diverse things.
Advaitans account for this apparent
diversity by using the concept of
adhyasa (superimposition), in which a
false, mistaken understanding is projected upon a real object—in the classical Advaita example, seeing a rope in the
twilight and mistaking it for a snake. For
the Advaitins, the “snake” is not completely unreal, since it depends on the
rope for its existence—one cannot see
the snake unless the rope is there. At the
same time, the “snake” is clearly not real
since one does not persist in this error,
and once the illusion of the snake has
been dispelled, one can no longer see it.
In the same way, the Advaitins
believe that our idea of the phenomenal
everyday world is projected upon the
one thing in the universe that is truly
real—Brahman. Like the snake, the
world is unreal as it is perceived but real
insofar as it depends on Brahman. For
the Advaitins, the roots of adhyasa are
epistemological, that is, related to how
human beings come to know things, but
the results of adhyasa are both epistemological and ontological (related to how
things actually are). On one hand,
adhyasa obscures the Ultimate Reality
and prevents one from accurately perceiving it, and on the other, its projective
character creates our notions of the
world. For the Advaitins, the source of all
this confusion is ultimately rooted in
avidya, or primal ignorance, under the
influence of which one forms mistaken
ideas about the world. The operation of
this ignorance is said to have no beginning, but one of the things that keeps it
going is one’s karma, based on the continuing actions caused by this mistaken
understanding. Another source of this
ignorance is the power of illusion (maya)
wielded by God (Ishvara), which bewilders human beings. For the Advaita
Vedantin, God is identified as a qualified
(saguna) form of Brahman—thus below
the highest unqualified (nirguna)
Brahman, and himself a product of
superimposition.
Since the Advaita school believes that
the source of bondage to karma results
from mistaken understanding, the only
way to destroy bondage is to gain the correct understanding. Although the
Advaitans say that people must perform
obligatory religious actions (nitya
karma) as a matter of duty, actions can
never bring about the understanding that
is necessary for salvation, although they
may aid the process by removing some of
the karmic obstacles. To support this
understanding, the Advaitins begin their
analysis with an appeal to the knowing
subject as the one thing that can never be
doubted, and claim that this self-consciousness is evidence for the existence
of the inner Self, or atman. Aside from
this appeal to experience, they depend
heavily on the authority of the sacred
texts, particularly the Upanishads, to
uphold their key doctrines: that Brahman
is the source of all things; that the human
soul is ultimately identical to Brahman,
although hampered by obstructions

Advaita Vedanta
based on past karma; and that gaining
true knowledge is the basis of liberation.
The first and greatest Advaita thinker
was the philosopher Shankaracharya;
other significant figures were his two disciples, Sureshvara and Padmapada, as
well as Mandana Mishra and Vachaspati
Mishra. For further information see Karl

  <p>One of the branches of <strong>Vedanta</strong>, the<br>
philosophical school claiming to reveal<br>
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the<br>
ancient sacred texts known as the <strong>Vedas</strong>.<br>
The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism,<br>
which is the belief that a single Ultimate<br>
Reality lies behind all things. Advaita<br>
proponents believe that reality is nondual (advaita)—that is, that everything<br>
in the world is actually the formless,<br>
unqualified <strong>Brahman</strong>, despite the<br>
appearance of difference and diversity.<br>
To support this claim, the Advaitins provide a convincing explanation for the<br>
world one perceives to have many separate and diverse things.<br>
Advaitans account for this apparent<br>
diversity by using the concept of<br>
<strong>adhyasa</strong> (superimposition), in which a<br>
false, mistaken understanding is projected upon a real object—in the classical Advaita example, seeing a rope in the<br>
twilight and mistaking it for a snake. For<br>
the Advaitins, the “snake” is not completely unreal, since it depends on the<br>
rope for its existence—one cannot see<br>
the snake unless the rope is there. At the<br>
same time, the “snake” is clearly not real<br>
since one does not persist in this error,<br>
and once the illusion of the snake has<br>
been dispelled, one can no longer see it.<br>
In the same way, the Advaitins<br>
believe that our idea of the phenomenal<br>
everyday world is projected upon the<br>
one thing in the universe that is truly<br>
real—Brahman. Like the snake, the<br>
world is unreal as it is perceived but real<br>
insofar as it depends on Brahman. For<br>
the Advaitins, the roots of adhyasa are<br>
epistemological, that is, related to how<br>
human beings come to know things, but<br>
the results of adhyasa are both epistemological and ontological (related to how<br>
things actually are). On one hand,<br>
adhyasa obscures the Ultimate Reality<br>
and prevents one from accurately perceiving it, and on the other, its projective<br>
character creates our notions of the<br>
world. For the Advaitins, the source of all<br>
this confusion is ultimately rooted in<br>
<strong>avidya</strong>, or primal ignorance, under the<br>
influence of which one forms mistaken<br>
ideas about the world. The operation of<br>
this ignorance is said to have no beginning, but one of the things that keeps it<br>
going is one’s <strong>karma</strong>, based on the continuing actions caused by this mistaken<br>
understanding. Another source of this<br>
ignorance is the power of illusion (<strong>maya</strong>)<br>
wielded by God (<strong>Ishvara</strong>), which bewilders human beings. For the Advaita<br>
Vedantin, God is identified as a qualified<br>
(<strong>saguna</strong>) form of Brahman—thus below<br>
the highest unqualified (<strong>nirguna</strong>)<br>
Brahman, and himself a product of<br>
superimposition.<br>
Since the Advaita school believes that<br>
the source of bondage to karma results<br>
from mistaken understanding, the only<br>
way to destroy bondage is to gain the correct understanding. Although the<br>
Advaitans say that people must perform<br>
obligatory religious actions (<strong>nitya</strong><br>
<strong>karma</strong>) as a matter of duty, actions can<br>
never bring about the understanding that<br>
is necessary for salvation, although they<br>
may aid the process by removing some of<br>
the karmic obstacles. To support this<br>
understanding, the Advaitins begin their<br>
analysis with an appeal to the knowing<br>
subject as the one thing that can never be<br>
doubted, and claim that this self-consciousness is evidence for the existence<br>
of the inner Self, or <strong>atman</strong>. Aside from<br>
this appeal to experience, they depend<br>
heavily on the authority of the sacred<br>
texts, particularly the <strong>Upanishads</strong>, to<br>
uphold their key doctrines: that Brahman<br>
is the source of all things; that the human<br>
soul is ultimately identical to Brahman,<br>
although hampered by obstructions<br>
12<br>
Advaita Vedanta<br>
based on past karma; and that gaining<br>
true knowledge is the basis of liberation.<br>
The first and greatest Advaita thinker<br>
was the philosopher <strong>Shankaracharya</strong>;<br>
other significant figures were his two disciples, <strong>Sureshvara</strong> and <strong>Padmapada</strong>, as<br>
well as <strong>Mandana Mishra</strong> and <strong>Vachaspati</strong><br>
<strong>Mishra</strong>. For further information see Karl<br>

<em>Philosophy</em>, 1957.</p>
