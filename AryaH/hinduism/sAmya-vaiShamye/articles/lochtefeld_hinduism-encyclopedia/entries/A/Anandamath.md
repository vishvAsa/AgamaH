+++
Novel by the Bengali nationalist  
author **Bankim Chandra Chatterjee**  
(1838–1894). It is set in eighteenthcentury Bengal during the so-called  
**Sanyasi Rebellion**, which invloved  
bands of Hindu and Muslim militant  
**ascetics**. Both groups fought with the  
British East India Company for control over the region.  
Historical inquiry suggests that the  
roots of this conflict lay in the extreme  
social tensions in Bengali society,  
particularly changes in land ownership  
patterns and the havoc wreaked by  
the great famine of 1770–1771.  
Chatterjee was an ardent Indian nationalist and portrayed the Sanyasi  
Rebellion as a struggle by Mother India’s  
loyal children to expel the parasitic  
British invaders from her shores.  
Although the novel was set in an earlier  
era to avoid problems with the British  
authorities, *Anandamath* is clearly allegorical and nationalistic, and it is viewed  
by contemporary critics as Chatterjee’s  
way to symbolize the need for continuing  
the struggle against British imperialism in  
the mid-nineteenth century.
