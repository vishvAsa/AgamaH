title = "Aiyappa"

+++
Hilltop **deity** of the southern Indian  
state of **Kerala**, who at the local level is  
often identified with **Aiyanar**, the Tamil  
**village deity**. The most important of  
Aiyappa’s shrines is at **Shabari Malai** in  
the hills of central Kerala, to which there  
is an important pilgrimage each winter  
in December and January. Aiyappa’s  
strong associations with the hills and  
the hunt make it likely that he was originally a local deity of the hills of Kerala,  
but in more recent times he has been  
assimilated into the larger Hindu pantheon as the **son** of **Shiva** and **Vishnu**.  
Although both of these gods are male,  
Aiyappa’s conception is said to happen  
when Vishnu takes the form of the  
female enchantress **Mohini**, to beguile  
the **demons** into parting with the  
nectar of immortality. Because of his  
parentage, Aiyappa is also called  
Hariharaputra, “the son (putra) of Hari  
(Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).”  
Due to his unusual conception,  
Aiyappa is fated to kill a particularly  
troubling buffalo demoness, **Mahishi**,  
who has been given the boon that she  
cannot be killed by anyone born from  
the union of male and female. After his  
**birth** the infant Aiyappa is abandoned  
by a riverbank, and adopted by King  
**Rajashekhara**, who names him  
Manikanta. Manikanta’s stepmother is  
very jealous of her stepson and wishes  
to clear the path to the throne for her  
own child. When Manikanta is twelve his  
stepmother feigns an illness that she  
says only **tiger’s** milk can cure. Everyone  
is understandably reluctant to try to get  
the tiger’s milk, but Manikanta finally  
agrees to do so.  
On his way to get the tiger’s milk,  
Manikanta is met by messengers of  
Shiva, who remind him that his life’s  
ultimate purpose is to kill Mahishi. After  
a long struggle, Manikanta dispatches  
the demon, but while he is dancing on  
the she-buffalo’s body, another female  
figure rises out of it. She identifies herself as **Lila**, and wants to marry  
Manikanta, but as a celibate student he  
does not desire this. He appeases Lila

Aiyanar  
A shrine to Aiyanar, a regional deity in southern  
India who is the protector of villages.  
with the conditional vow that he will  
marry her the year that a celibate pilgrim does not come to visit him on  
Shabari Malai—a vow that will never  
come true since **celibacy** is the single  
most important requirement for the  
Shabari Malai pilgrimage. Manikanta  
then placates Lila by establishing a temple for her on a neighboring hilltop.  
Returning to his original task of  
retrieving the tiger’s milk, Aiyappa then  
bids Shiva to take the form of a tiger,  
upon which he rides back to his stepparents, inviting them to milk the tiger to  
their heart’s content. This image of the  
young boy returning astride the tiger is  
one of the most common Aiyappa  
images. For further information see
