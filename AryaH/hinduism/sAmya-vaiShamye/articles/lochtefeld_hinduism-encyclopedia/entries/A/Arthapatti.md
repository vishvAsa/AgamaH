(“presumption”) All Indian philosophical  
schools concern themselves with codifying the **pramanas**, that is, the means by  
which human beings can gain true and  
accurate knowledge. Almost all schools  
consider perception (**pratyaksha**), inference (**anumana**), and authoritative testimony (**shabda**) as pramanas; the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** school, one of the **six schools**  
of traditional Hindu **philosophy**, posited  
two others: **abhava** (“knowledge from  
absence”) and arthapatti.  
Arthapatti is an inference from circumstance in which a judgment is  
made about one case based solely on  
similarities to related cases. An  
example would be when a traveler is  
presumed to have reached her destination, since the train’s arrival time has  
passed. According to Indian philosophy, this is not a true inference since  
the judgment must always be confirmed by direct perception, in this  
case that the train had actually  
reached its destination. The Purva  
Mimamsas justified this new pramana  
by arguing that this knowledge could  
not be accounted for by any of the  
existing pramanas and thus required  
this new one to explain it. The other  
schools were not inclined to accept it,  
since its presumptive nature could  
often lead to error.
