title = "Alakhiya Akhara"

+++
The name of one subgroup of **ascetics**  
within the **Naga** class of the **Dashanami**  
order of **Sanyasis**. The Dashanami  
Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**, organized into different **akharas**  
or regiments that follow the model of an  
army. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Nagas’ primary  
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,  
although they also had substantial trading interests; both of these occupations  
have largely disappeared in contemporary times. The Alakhiya akhara is a  
subunit of the **Juna akhara**, one of the  
largest and oldest of the Naga akharas.  
The name *Alakhiya* comes from the  
word *alakh* (“without characteristics,” a  
name for the Supreme Being), which  
many **Shaiva ascetics** utter when **begging** for alms.

Alakananda River  
The Alakananda River near Badrinath Garhwal.  
As a tributary of the Ganges, its waters are considered sacred.  
Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Nagas were fighting ascetics, drawn largely from the  
ranks of the **shudras**, the lowest Hindu  
**varna**. According to tradition, these  
fighting ascetics were recruited to protect the learned ascetics who, because  
they were saintly and scholarly men,  
could not protect themselves. The  
Nagas also had substantial trading  
interests. Two and three hundred years  
ago, these akharas were very powerful,  
especially in parts of the country  
where the centralized government had  
broken down. The Naga akharas sold  
their services as mercenaries, lent  
money at interest, engaged in trade,  
and often owned large amounts of  
property. The one place where the  
divisions and subdivisions of the  
akharas are still quite important is at  
the celebration of the **Kumbha Mela**, a  
bathing (**snana**) festival. There is a  
strict order for bathing, and individuals get a place in line based on their  
affiliation. Two hundred years ago,  
being first in line signified political,  
economic, and/or military dominance. The present bathing order  
reflects each group's relative importance from that time.
