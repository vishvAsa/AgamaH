title = "Asthi-Sanchayana"

+++
(“gathering the bones”) Name for a particular ceremony performed as one of  
the last rites (**antyeshthi samskara**) connected with death. Asthi-sanchayana is  
usually performed on the second or third  
**day** after **cremation**. In this rite, some of  
the remains of the deceased—bits of  
bone and ash—are gathered from the  
site of the cremation pyre. These remains  
are collected and kept in a safe place  
until their final dispersal in the last of the  
death rites, **asthi-visarjana**.
