title = "Anandamayi Ma"

+++
(1896–1982) Hindu mystic and saint,  
who during her lifetime gained a wide  
following in all parts of Hindu society  
as a manifestation of the Mother  
**Goddess**. She was born in Dhaka in  
modern Bangladesh and from a very  
young age showed strong spiritual tendencies. These intensified after her  
marriage, when she would slip into  
blissful meditation, oblivious to her  
surroundings and the passage of time.  
The marriage was never consummated  
and her husband became one of her  
primary disciples. For some time she  
lived in an **ashram** in the city of  
**Benares**, which is famous as a sacred  
site (**tirtha**). Later she built an ashram  
just outside the city of **Haridwar**,  
where her **samadhi** (“**burial**”) **shrine**  
can be found.
