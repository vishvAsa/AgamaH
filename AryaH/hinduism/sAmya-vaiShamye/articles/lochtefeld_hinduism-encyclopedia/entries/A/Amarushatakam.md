(“**Amaru’s** Hundred”) Collection of  
poems on the theme of **erotic** love, traditionally ascribed to the seventh-century poet Amaru. The text’s name is  
doubly misleading since present editions contain almost 200 poems, and  
there is strong evidence that it was compiled from several earlier collections,  
making its authorship uncertain.  
Although the poetry explores the joys of  
carnal love and is thus not explicitly religious, the themes of lover/beloved and  
union/separation treated in this poetry  
later became standard genres of **bhakti**  
(devotional) poetry.
