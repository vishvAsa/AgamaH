title = "Ashvins"

+++
Twin **deities** named Satya and Dasya,  
who are **sons** of the god **Surya** (the **Sun**)  
and the physicians to the gods. In the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics, the Ashvins are the divine  
fathers of the **Pandava** twins, **Nakula**  
and **Sahadeva**. Nakula and Sahadeva are  
born when their mother, **Madri**, uses a  
powerful **mantra** enabling a woman to  
have a child by any one of the gods;  
as the sons of the divine physicians,  
the epic portrays these twins as having  
their fathers’ ability to heal. In the  
Hindu lunar **calendar**, the month of  
**Ashvin** (October–November) is devoted  
to them.
