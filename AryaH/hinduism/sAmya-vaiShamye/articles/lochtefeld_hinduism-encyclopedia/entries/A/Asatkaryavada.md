One of the three basic **causal models** in  
classical Indian **philosophy**, along  
with **satkaryavada** and **anekantavada**.  
All three models seek to explain the  
workings of causality in the everyday  
world, particularly the relationship  
between causes and their effects,  
which has profound implications for  
religious life. All of the philosophical  
schools assume that if one understands the causal process correctly  
and can manipulate it through one’s  
conscious actions, it is possible to gain  
final liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
Thus disagreements over differing  
causal models are not merely  
academic disputes but are grounded  
in varying assumptions about the  
nature of things.  
The asatkaryavada model assumes  
that effects do not preexist in their  
causes; that is, they are completely  
and utterly distinct from them. In  
the classic examples for this model,  
one can create a clay pot by putting  
together the two halves of the pot, or  
one can weave a cloth from many  
strands of thread. Each of these acts  
creates a new object that did not previously exist, which came into being  
through certain material and instrumental causes.  
Since each act of creation brings a  
new thing into being, this causal model  
tends to multiply the number of objects  
in the universe. It also admits that  
human efforts and actions are part of the  
causes influencing these effects, making  
it theoretically possible to act in a way  
that brings final liberation to the soul.  
The disadvantage of this model  
is that it can lead to philosophical  
skepticism. As the world gets fragmented  
into more and more causes—most of  
which one cannot control—one can  
easily believe that one’s actions will  
have no discernible effect, even over  
time. To counter this danger of  
skepticism, asatkaryavada proponents  
stress the conditions that govern  
the causal process and gear people’s  
efforts accordingly.  
This model is espoused by the **Nyaya**  
**Vaisheshikas** and the **Prabhakara**  
school of **Purva Mimamsa**, as well as by  
the Buddhists. For further information
