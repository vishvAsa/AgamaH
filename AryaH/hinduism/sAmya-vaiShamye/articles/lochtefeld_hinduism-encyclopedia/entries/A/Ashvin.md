title = "Ashvin"

+++
According to the lunar **calendar**, by  
which most Hindu religious festivals are  
determined, Ashvin is the seventh  
month in the lunar **year**, usually falling  
within September and October. In  
Ashvin the monsoon rains usually  
taper off, and the weather becomes a  
bit cooler.  
The dark (waning) half of this month  
is the **Pitrpaksha**, one of the most  
inauspicious times of the year. The  
bright (waxing) half contains one of  
the most important festivals of the year,  
the fall **Navaratri**, culminating in  
**Dussehra** or Vijaya Dashami. Other  
festivals during this month are **Indira**  
**Ekadashi**, **Papankusha Ekadashi**, and  
**Valmiki Jayanti**.
