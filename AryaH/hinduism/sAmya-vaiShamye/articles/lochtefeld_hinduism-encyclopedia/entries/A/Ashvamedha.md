(“horse **sacrifice**”) Vedic sacrifice performed to display and prove royal power.  
In this sacrifice a specially consecrated  
horse was released to roam as it wished,  
followed by an armed band of the king’s  
servants. When the horse wandered into a  
neighboring ruler’s territory, that king had  
two choices: He could either acknowledge  
subordinate status to the king who  
had released it, or he could attempt to  
steal the horse, and do battle with the  
king’s servants.  
After one year of wandering, the horse  
was brought back to the royal capital and  
killed by suffocation or strangulation, so  
that its **blood** would not be shed. After the  
horse had been killed, the chief queen  
would lie down next to it and simulate sexual intercourse. When the instructions for  
this ritual were first translated in the nineteenth century, this simulated intercourse  
generated considerable horrified interest  
among European scholars, even though it  
was clearly a subsidiary part of the ritual.  
The rite’s major emphasis was a celebration of royal power, since the king performing it was able to control the territory  
covered in a year by a free-roaming horse.  
The queen’s role, in contrast, seems aimed  
at symbolically assuring the fertility of the  
land. Historical records indicate that the  
ashvamedha was performed until the  
tenth century C.E. As with all other cases of  
**animal sacrifice**, concerns about the  
karmic consequences of slaughtering a  
living being has been an important factor  
in its discontinuation. See also **karma**.
