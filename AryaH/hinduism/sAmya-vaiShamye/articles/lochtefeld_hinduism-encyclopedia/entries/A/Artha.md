title = "Artha"

+++
In Indian **philosophy** this is one of the  
four purusharthas, or **aims of life**, with  
the others being **kama** (desire), **dharma**  
(religious duty), and **moksha** (final liberation of the soul). The word *artha* has different shades of meaning in various  
contexts, but all of these meanings center  
on the definitions “aim,” “goal,” or “end.”  
The word can thus refer to any goal of  
human life, but as one of these  
purusharthas, artha refers to riches,  
power, and worldly prosperity. These are  
the material things that allow one to fulfill one’s temporal goals, and unless one  
gains them in some measure, any sort of  
worldly happiness becomes problematic.  
Hindu culture has traditionally sanctioned wealth and power as a legitimate  
human goal, although this endeavor  
must be governed by a commitment to  
dharma. When controlled by an overall  
orientation to righteous action, the  
quest for wealth is part of an integrated  
life. Without this commitment the drive  
for wealth becomes an all-consuming  
desire that ultimately destroys a person.
