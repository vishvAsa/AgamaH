title = "Ayodhya"

+++
(“unassailable”) Sacred city (**tirtha**) on  
the Sarayu River, in the Faizabad district of the state of **Uttar Pradesh**, and  
one of India’s **seven sacred cities**.  
Ayodhya is famous as the setting for  
much of the **Ramayana**, the later of  
the two great Hindu epics, whose principal character is the god **Rama**. In the  
*Ramayana*, Ayodhya is the capital city  
of Rama’s father, King **Dasharatha**, the  
birthplace and childhood home of  
Rama and his brothers, and the city to  
which Rama returns in triumph after  
his exile is over.  
Although historians have raised  
doubts about the *Ramayana*’s historical veracity and the reality of the  
events described there, Rama’s devotees (**bhakta**) entertain no such  
doubts. For them the cult of Rama is  
deeply entrenched in Ayodhya, and  
various places in the city are associated  
with events in the epic that are  
believed to have actually occurred.  
In most cases this has had no ill  
effects, with the exception of the **Ram**  
**Janam Bhumi**, the site identified as  
Rama’s birthplace. Until 1992, this site  
was occupied by the **Babri Masjid**, a  
Muslim mosque supposedly built after  
the existing temple was demolished.  
On December 6 of that year, the  
mosque was destroyed by teams of  
activists from the **Vishva Hindu**  
**Parishad**, who tore it down in just over  
six hours. The destruction sparked  
Hindu-Muslim riots all over India, in  
which thousands of people were killed.
