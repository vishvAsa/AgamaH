title = "Alakananda River"

+++
The longest and largest Himalayan tributary of the **Ganges** River; the Ganges forms  
at **Devaprayag**, where the Alakananda  
unites with a second major tributary, the  
**Bhagirathi** River. As with all the Himalayan  
tributaries of the Ganges, the Alakananda  
River is considered sacred. Important pilgrimage places (**tirtha**) along the river  
include the temple town of **Badrinath** near  
its headwaters, its junction with the  
**Pindara River** at **Karnaprayag**, its junction  
with the **Mandakini** River at **Rudraprayag**,  
and Devaprayag.
