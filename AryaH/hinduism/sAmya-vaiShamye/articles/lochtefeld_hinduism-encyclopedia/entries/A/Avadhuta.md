title = "Avadhuta"

+++
(“one who has cast away [all attachments]”) In its most general sense,  
an avadhuta is an **ascetic** who does  
not adhere to any social or religious  
rules but his (or far more rarely,  
her) own. Needless to say, their  
behavior is often unpredictable, seemingly capricious, and sometimes  
intentionally shocking.  
As a more technical title, avadhuta  
is a term of respect for the senior  
members of the **Naga** class of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva** and who formerly  
made their living as traders and  
mercenary soldiers.
