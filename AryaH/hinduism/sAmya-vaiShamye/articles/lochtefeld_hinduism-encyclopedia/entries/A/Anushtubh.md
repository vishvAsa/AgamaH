title = "Anushtubh"

+++
By far the most widely used **meter** in  
**Sanskrit** poetry, composed of two  
lines of sixteen syllables each with  
eight syllables per half line. The metric  
pattern for each half line is based on  
the distinction between “heavy” and  
“light” syllables. A heavy syllable is any  
syllable with a long vowel or consonant cluster; all other syllables are  
light. According to the prescribed pattern, the fifth syllable of each half line  
should be light, the sixth heavy, and  
the seventh alternately heavy and  
light. The anushtubh’s simplicity  
makes it the meter of choice for many  
religious texts, including much of the  
**Bhagavad Gita**.
