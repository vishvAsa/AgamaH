title = "Ardha (“Half”) Kumbha Mela"

+++
A religious celebration secondary to  
the **Kumbha Mela**. The Kumbha Mela  
is a gigantic religious festival that  
entails bathing (**snana**) in sacred  
rivers. It is celebrated at four sacred  
sites (**tirthas**): **Haridwar**, **Allahabad**,  
**Ujjain**, and **Nasik**. It occurs approximately every twelve years, based on  
the position of the planet **Jupiter** in  
the **zodiac**.  
The Ardha Kumbha Mela is celebrated six years after the full (purna)  
Kumbha Mela, when Jupiter has  
advanced halfway through the zodiac  
toward the next full Kumbha Mela. It is  
generally celebrated only at Allahabad  
and Haridwar, marking the greater  
importance of these two sites.  
Although the full Kumbha Mela is  
deemed more auspicious and gets  
much larger attendance, the Ardha  
Kumbha Mela is still attended by millions of pilgrims.
