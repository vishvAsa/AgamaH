(“indescribable discrimination”) This  
is a particular **theory of error** that  
aims to explain why people make  
errors in judgment, such as the stock  
example of mistaking the silvery flash  
of a seashell for a piece of silver. This  
theory was advanced by the philosophical school of **Advaita Vedanta**, a  
group that would consider this judgment to be a false one; they would also  
believe, however, that until one realizes that the object is just a shell, one  
actually sees the silver there.  
The Advaita theory of error is based  
on the fundamental concept of superimposition (**adhyasa**), in which one  
perceives something that is actually  
there (in this case, the shell). This  
real object is the basis for the illusory  
perception (the silver), which is a  
mistaken projection. The Advaitins  
claim that the “silver” is real insofar  
as it is based on the shell, and false  
insofar as one believes it to be  
precious metal.  
Of course, according to the  
Advaitins, the shell and all the other  
“real” things of the world are themselves ultimately illusory since they  
are superimposed on **Brahman**, the  
only thing in the universe that is truly  
real. For further information see
