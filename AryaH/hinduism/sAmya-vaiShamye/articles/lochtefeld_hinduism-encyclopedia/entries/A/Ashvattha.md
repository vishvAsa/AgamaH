title = "Ashvattha"

+++
The sacred fig tree, *Ficus religiosa*, which  
in modern times is more commonly  
known as the pipal. The ashvattha is  
especially noted for its aerial roots,  
which extend downward from some of  
the limbs until they touch the ground, at  
which point they take root themselves.  
Because their roots can become subsidiary trunks, ashvattha trees can  
grow to be enormous. They have traditionally been favored as places for  
**ascetics** to dwell, in part because of their  
sacred associations and in part because  
their dense foliage provides shelter from  
the elements.

Their unusual structure is noted in  
chapter fifteen of the **Bhagavad Gita**, in  
which the ashvattha is described as the  
tree of life. The ashvattha is also believed  
to be the type of tree under which the  
Buddha attained enlightenment.
