title = "Ashram"

+++
The abode of an **ascetic** or religious renunciant. The word is derived from a form of  
the verb “to strive” and has several different  
meanings: On one hand, an ashram is also  
a place where one gives up one’s conventional worldly striving; on the other hand,  
it is a place at which one can seriously  
strive for spiritual goals that are often less  
emphasized in the material world.  
In modern Hinduism (both in India  
and abroad) the word can refer to a full  
spectrum of living arrangements, from  
a simple hut or cave inhabited by one  
person to magnificent building compounds that can house thousands of  
people at a time.
