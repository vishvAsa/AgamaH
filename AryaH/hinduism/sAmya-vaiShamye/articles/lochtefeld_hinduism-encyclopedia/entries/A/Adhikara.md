title = "Adhikara"

+++
(“qualification”) In any sort of Hindu  
**worship**, but particularly in **tantra**,  
adhikara indicates that one has the religious qualifications to perform certain  
ritual actions. This refers partly to knowing how to perform the ritual, and thus  
being “qualified” in that sense of the  
word. More importantly, it refers to having gained the ritual status that entitles  
one to perform the ritual. This status is  
usually conferred by some sort of formal  
**initiation** or initiations given by one’s  
teacher, who decides what type of and  
how much adhikara to transmit based  
on an assessment of the student’s abilities, temperament, and desire to learn.
