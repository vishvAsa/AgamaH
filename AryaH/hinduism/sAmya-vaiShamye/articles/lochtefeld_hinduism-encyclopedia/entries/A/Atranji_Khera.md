Architectural site near the city of  
Aligarh that is located in the modern  
state of **Uttar Pradesh**. Excavations at  
Atranji Khera have revealed an ancient  
urban center dating back to the second millennium B.C.E. The settlements  
here were not as developed as those in  
the **Indus Valley civilization**, although  
they are believed to be distinct from it  
and thus another potential source for  
ancient Indian culture.
