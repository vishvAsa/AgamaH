(“bodily posture”) In the **ashtanga**  
(“eight-part”) **yoga** first codified by  
**Patanjali** (1st c. C.E.?), asana is the  
third of the eight elements of yoga  
practice and involves different body  
postures. In his text, Patanjali asserts  
that one’s physical position should be  
stable and comfortable, since the  
ultimate end of these postures is to  
enable one to concentrate without  
physical distractions. A series of positions for developing and training the  
body evolved from this text. The most  
familiar of these is the lotus posture  
(**padmasana**).  
These physical exercises are the  
best-known feature of yoga and are  
often confused with the larger practice of yoga itself. Although these  
postures have definite physical benefits, such as increased bodily flexibility, their ultimate purpose is to  
enable one to sit for long periods in  
meditation without physical distractions. As such, they are a necessary  
element for progress on the spiritual  
path but should not be confused with  
the end goal.  
In a more general context, the word  
*asana* can refer to various ways of sitting, and by extension to the thing  
upon which one sits. In general the  
object upon which one sits—particularly for meditation or any sort of religious practice—is believed to be  
charged with power because of its  
association with spirituality. Many of  
these objects, especially **animal** skins,  
are believed to confer certain powers  
and thus have symbolic meaning as well.

Asamanjasa  
A man practices the fetus position.  
This asana, or bodily posture,  
is one of many that are used in yoga.  
In the context of **worship**, asana is  
the second of the sixteen **upacharas**  
(“**offerings**”) given to a **deity** as a way  
of treating the god as an honored  
guest. In this case asana refers to offering the deity a place to sit, one of the  
most basic acts of human hospitality.
