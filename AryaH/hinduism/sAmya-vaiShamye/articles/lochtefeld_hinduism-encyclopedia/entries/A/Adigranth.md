title = "Adigranth"

+++
(“Primal Book”) One of the names for  
the Sikh scripture, most often used by  
people outside the tradition. Sikhs  
themselves are more likely to use the  
honorific title *Shri Guru Granth Sahib*,  
which reflects the scripture’s status as  
the spiritual leader (**guru**) of the Sikh  
community. This status was conferred  
by the tenth Sikh guru, Gobind Singh  
(d. 1708), who proclaimed that after his  
8  
Adi  
death the community would have no  
more human leaders, but only their  
scripture to guide them. The book’s religious authority can be seen in the way  
that the Sikhs treat it. They accord the  
Adigranth the status of a living person.  
In Sikh temples the Adigranth is ceremonially put to bed at night and woken  
up in the morning. It is enshrined under  
a canopy (a sign of royalty) for **worship**,  
is fanned during hot weather and  
warmed during cold, and if it has to be  
taken anywhere, is carried on the bearer’s head, considered the purest part of  
the body. In according this respectful  
treatment to a physical book, the Sikhs  
were probably influenced by Muslim  
practice with regard to the Qur’an, since  
in general Hindus pay little heed to a  
book itself, however important the text  
may be.  
The Adigranth plays a central role in  
Sikh life: Children are named by opening  
the book at random and taking the first  
consonant on the upper-left-hand page  
as the first letter of the child’s name; Sikh  
couples are married by circling the  
book, as Hindu couples circle the  
sacred **fire** (**agnipradakshinam**), and a  
commonly performed death rite is an  
unbroken reading (**akhand path**) of the  
entire text.  
The text itself was compiled in  
1603–1604 by Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh  
guru. According to tradition he compiled the book in response to certain  
rivals contesting his authority, some of  
whom had compiled and were circulating books purporting to be the teachings  
of Guru Nanak, the Sikhs’ founder and  
first guru. There may be some truth in  
this tradition, but it is now well established that Arjan himself was working  
from a compilation made a generation  
before. The text’s opening verses are  
known as the mul **mantra**, which gives a  
collection of attributes and qualities  
ascribed to the Supreme Being. After  
this opening, the Adigranth has  
three main parts. The first is the Japji,  
a sequence of thirty-eight poems  
written by Guru Nanak that is  
considered the essence of the Sikh faith,  
and which is recited by the faithful as  
the morning prayer.  
The second section contains the  
hymns of the Sikh gurus, arranged by  
**raga**, or melodic mode. Within each raga  
the hymns are arranged according to  
poetic **meter**, and within each meter the  
hymns are arranged sequentially according to which of the gurus composed  
them. Since the Sikh tradition holds that  
all ten gurus contained the same divine  
spirit, they all identified themselves as  
“Nanak.” But introductions to the songs  
differentiate between them by calling  
them *Mahala* (literally “house,” but figuratively “body”) followed by a number—  
from Mahala 1 for Guru Nanak to Mahala  
5 for Guru Arjan.  
The final section of the Adigranth  
contains hymns by various other devotees (**bhakta**), both Hindu and Muslim,  
whom the Sikh gurus believed to  
be propounding the essential Sikh  
message of monotheism and the need  
to serve God. Among the Hindu  
devotional (**bhakti**) poets whose works  
can be found in this section are  
**Trilochan**, **Jayadeva**, **Pipa**, **Ramananda**,  
**Sen**, **Namdev**, **Kabir**, and **Ravidas**, with  
significant collections for the last three.  
Even for those not interested in the  
Sikhs, this last section makes the  
Adigranth an extremely important  
document. Not only does this section  
provide manuscript tradition that can  
be precisely and accurately dated, but  
the sacred status of the text has ensured  
that it has remained unchanged since  
the beginning of the seventeenth century. Many other manuscript sources  
for these poets are far more recent and  
are made problematic by textual corruption and pseudonymous additions.
