title = "Atikaya"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Hindu epics, Atikaya is one the **sons**  
of the great **demon Ravana** by his wife  
**Mandodari**. Like his father, Atikaya is  
described as a great devotee (**bhakta**)  
of **Shiva** and, because of his constant  
devotion, he gains many wondrous  
weapons and powers. Atikaya fights  
bravely and valiantly in the war with  
**Rama’s** army but is eventually killed by  
Rama’s brother **Lakshmana**.
