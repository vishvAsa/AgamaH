title = "Agni Akhara"

+++
The name of a particular subgroup of  
the **Naga** class of the **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasis**, a particular type of renunciant  
**ascetic**. The Dashanami Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**, organized into different **akharas** or  
regiments on the model of an army.  
Until the beginning of the nineteenth  
century, the Nagas’ primary occupation  
was as mercenary soldiers, although  
they also had substantial trading interests; both of these occupations have  
largely disappeared in contemporary  
times. The Agni akhara is a subunit of  
the **Juna akhara**, one of the largest and  
oldest of the Naga akharas.  
The Agni akhara’s membership is  
very different from that of the other  
established akharas. Whereas the other  
Naga Sanyasi akharas will accept men  
from all levels of society—in some cases  
even the lowest status group, the **shudras**—the Agni akhara admits only  
unmarried **brahmins** who have been  
lifelong celibates. Perhaps as a consequence of their more exclusive membership criteria, the Agni akhara is the only  
Dashanami Naga akhara that has no  
naked (naga) ascetics. All of its members  
remain fully clothed during the procession for their bath at the **Kumbha Mela**.

Agni Akhara  
Depiction of the god Agni. Agni is identified with  
fire and is believed to be present in all fires,  
along with lightning and the sun.  
The Agni akhara was first established in  
**Benares**, and this remains their most  
important site. All of the akharas have  
particular features that define their  
organizational identity, including  
specific patron **deities**; the Agni akhara’s  
patron deity is the **goddess** Gayatri,  
considered the embodiment of the  
**Gayatri Mantra**.
