title = "Apastamba"

+++
(4th c. B.C.E.?) Sage, writer, and  
commentator. Apastamba is known for  
his influential work with the **Kalpa**  
**Sutra** form, a type of text that consists  
of three essential elements: instructions for **Vedic** rituals (**Shrauta**  
**Sutras**), for domestic rites (**Grhya**  
**Sutras**), and for suitable human  
behavior (**Dharma Sutras**).  
He is one of three authors, along  
with **Baudhayana** and **Hiranyakeshin**,  
who wrote complete Kalpa Sutras with  
all three parts. All three of these  
men belonged to the same school,  
the Taittiriya school of the **Black**  
**Yajur Veda**.  
Apastamba’s Dharma Sutra is  
extremely significant, for it is considered one of the major sources for the  
law code attributed to **Manu**. This  
code was an important legal document even in the early twentieth century, since India’s British rulers  
considered it a source of “traditional”  
Hindu law.
