title = "Assam"

+++
Before Indian independence in 1947,  
this name designated the entire territory  
east of Bengal province in northeastern  
India; in the time since independence, it  
was divided into seven different administrative regions, one of which is the  
contemporary state of Assam.  
Like all other states in the northeastern corner, much of modern Assam is  
culturally distinct from the rest of India.  
One marker of this cultural divide is language: whereas most Indians speak languages from the Indo-Aryan or  
**Dravidian** language families, many  
tribal people in Assam speak TibetoBurman languages. The bulk of modern  
Assam is in the Brahmaputra River valley, which is where most of the Hindus  
in the northeast reside.  
Despite its remoteness from the rest  
of India, Assam does have one very  
important sacred place, the temple of  
the **goddess Kamakhya** just outside the  
capital of Gauhati. This is one of the  
**Shakti Pithas**, a network of sites connected with the **worship** of the Mother  
**Goddess** that were established at places  
where it is believed that body parts of the  
dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth**.  
Kamakhya is considered the most powerful of all the Shakti Pithas since it is  
believed to be where Satiâ€™s vulva (a highly  
charged female body part) fell to earth.
