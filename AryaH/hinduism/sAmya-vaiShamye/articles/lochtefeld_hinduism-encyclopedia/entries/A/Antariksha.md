title = "Antariksha"

+++
In the **cosmology** found in the **Vedas**,  
the earliest Hindu scripture, the antariksha is the middle region of the sky  
between the **earth** and fixed stars; it corresponds to what might now be called  
the atmosphere. This region is considered the theater of activity for **Indra**, god  
of the storm and the most important  
Vedic **deity**; it is also home to one manifestation of the Vedic god **Agni** (**fire**), in  
his form as lightning.
