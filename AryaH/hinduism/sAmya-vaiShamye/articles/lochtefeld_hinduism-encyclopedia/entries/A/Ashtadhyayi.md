title = "Ashtadhyayi"

+++
(“Eight Sections”) Text composed by the  
**Sanskrit grammarian Panini** (ca. 4th c.  
B.C.E.); the text’s name stems from the  
64  
Ashram  
Religious leader at an ashram in Puri.  
eight sections it contains. Panini wrote  
the *Ashtadhyayi* as a descriptive account  
of contemporary Sanskrit, but in later  
generations the text was transformed  
into the prescriptive norm for the language. Each of the *Ashtadhyayi*’s eight  
sections is composed of a series of brief  
aphorisms (**sutras**), which are usually  
only a few words long, and refers to a  
specific facet of Sanskrit grammar. Each  
sutra in a given section builds upon all  
the preceding sutras, and in turn provides the foundation and background  
for understanding those coming after it.  
This sequential description means that  
Panini began with Sanskrit’s most  
general linguistic features and moved  
from there to more specific ones. This  
method allowed Panini to provide a  
complete account of the Sanskrit  
language as briefly as possible, and the  
text’s condensed form facilitated memorization. As with most sutra texts, the  
*Ashtadhyayi’s* terseness of expression  
presupposes a commentary, since the  
sutras themselves are so short and pithy  
that they are simply cryptic to the uninitiated. The *Ashtadhyayi*’s most famous  
commentary is the **Mahabhashya**,  
written by the grammarian **Patanjali** in  
the second century B.C.E.
