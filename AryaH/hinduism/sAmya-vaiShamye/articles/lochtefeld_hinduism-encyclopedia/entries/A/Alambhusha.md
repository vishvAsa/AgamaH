title = "Alambhusha"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a celestial **woman**  
who was the **daughter** of the sage  
**Kashyapa**. As with many of the celestial  
women, she was often sent by **Indra**,  
the king of the gods, to seduce sages  
whose spiritual merit was great enough  
to pose a threat to Indraâ€™s lordship. The  
assumption behind this is that **celibacy**  
builds spiritual power, through which  
one can become a rival to the gods  
themselves. Sexual activity quickly  
drains this accumulated power,  
although the release of such power usually has positive consequences.  
Alambhusha is best known for her dalliance with the sage **Dadhichi**, by  
whom she had a **son** named **Saraswat**.
