Eight different forms of the **goddess**  
named **Lakshmi**, representing her different aspects as the source of wealth  
and prosperity. The eight are often portrayed as a set, although one may also  
encounter them separately: **Vijaya** (“victory”) Lakshmi, **Jaya** (“conquest”)  
Lakshmi, Dhana (“wealth”) Lakshmi,  
Dhanya (“grain”) Lakshmi, Gaja (“**elephant**”) Lakshmi, Aishvarya (“**divine**  
**power**”) Lakshmi, **Vina** (a musical  
instrument) Lakshmi, and Raja (“royal”)  
Lakshmi.
