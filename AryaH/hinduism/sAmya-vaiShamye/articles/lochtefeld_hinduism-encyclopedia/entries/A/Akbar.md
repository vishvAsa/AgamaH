title = "Akbar"

+++
(r. 1555–1605) Third and greatest ruler in  
the **Moghul dynasty**, a Muslim dynasty  
that controlled large parts of India  
between 1525 and 1707, existing in  
reduced form until 1857. Akbar’s long  
reign was marked by generally good  
relations with his Hindu subjects, many  
of whom were put into positions of  
authority and for whom he seems to  
have had genuine sympathy and understanding. One of his most important  
gestures was to repeal a poll tax on nonMuslims, which had been customary  
but was highly unpopular among  
Hindus. Although more orthodox  
Muslims insinuated that Akbar was a  
closet Hindu, the goodwill and cooperation that he fostered helped keep things  
peaceful throughout his reign.
