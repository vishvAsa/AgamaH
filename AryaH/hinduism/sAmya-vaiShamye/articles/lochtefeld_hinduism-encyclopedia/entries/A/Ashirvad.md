(“benedictory formula”) General term  
used to denote words of blessing,  
whether formal or informal. One of  
the basic assumptions of Hindu religious life is that certain spiritually  
powerful people—in particular,  
**ascetics** and learned **brahmins**—can  
confer blessings and **curses** at will.  
Both the blessings and curses are  
believed to take effect immediately  
and without fail, which is why a prudent person will always treat ascetics  
and learned brahmins with the  
respect that they deserve.
