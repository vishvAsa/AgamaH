(“shooting posture”) Bodily posture  
(**asana**) characteristic of certain  
images in Hindu iconography. This  
position is like that of an archer drawing a bow, in which one knee is thrown  
forward, the other leg pushed back,  
and the trunk twisted in the direction  
of the front leg. The god **Shiva** in his  
manifestation as **Tripurari**, “the  
destroyer of the Triple City,” is often  
shown in this posture. The god **Rama** is  
also portrayed in his warrior pose.
