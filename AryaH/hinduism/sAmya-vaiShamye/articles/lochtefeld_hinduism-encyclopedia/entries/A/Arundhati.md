title = "Arundhati"

+++
The wife of the sage **Vasishtha**. In Hindu  
mythology Arundhati is a model of  
devotion to her husband, and during  
contemporary **marriage ceremonies**,  
she is invoked by the groom as a model  
of wifely fidelity. Arundhati is also personified as the minor star Alcor in the  
constellation known as the Big Dipper  
(known in India as the Seven Sages  
because of its seven main stars); here  
she accompanies the star personifying  
her husband.
