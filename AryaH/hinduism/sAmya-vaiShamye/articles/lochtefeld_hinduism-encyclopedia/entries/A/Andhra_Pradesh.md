title = "Andhra Pradesh"

+++
Modern southern Indian state. Andhra  
Pradesh is one of the so-called linguistic  
states formed after independence to  
unite people with a common language  
and culture (in this case, Telegu) under  
one state government.  
In the case of Andhra Pradesh, this  
was done by combining the princely  
38  
Andhaka  
Temple of Venkateshvara in the town of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.  
state of Hyderabad with the Teleguspeaking provinces of the former state  
of Madras. This merger did not happen without some drama; when independence arrived, the Nizam of  
Hyderabad, a Muslim ruler whose  
subjects were mainly Hindus, was initially reluctant to join the Indian  
union, although he acceded after  
troops were deployed by the Indian  
government. The state capital has  
remained at Hyderabad, which is the  
largest and most important city.  
Andhra Pradesh is overwhelmingly  
agricultural, with fertile land in the  
**Krishna** and **Godavari** river deltas, but  
it is relatively undeveloped, and there  
is still a great disparity between the  
rich and the poor. In recent years it has  
become the home of an important  
regional political party, the Telegu  
Desam, as well as a base for the  
Marxist revolutionary group known as  
Naxalites, who are carrying on an  
armed struggle against the landlords.  
Andhra is also home to Indiaâ€™s  
richest temple, the temple of  
**Venkateshvara** at **Tirupati**, and to  
**Mallikarjuna**, one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a group of sites especially  
sacred to **Shiva**. For general information about Andhra Pradesh and all the  
regions of India, an accessible reference is Christine Nivin et al., *India*. 8th
