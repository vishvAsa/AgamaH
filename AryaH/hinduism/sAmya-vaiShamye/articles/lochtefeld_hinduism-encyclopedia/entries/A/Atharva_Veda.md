title = "Atharva Veda"

+++
The Atharva Veda is the last of the four  
**Vedas**, which are the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu religious texts. In  
many ways the Atharva Veda is the  
most unusual. Whereas the other  
three—**Rg Veda**, **Sama Veda**, and **Yajur**  
**Veda**—focus mainly on sacrificial rituals, the Atharva Veda is largely a collection of spells and incantations that can  
be used to counter or correct misfortune, and also to bring about one’s  
desired result. Its unusual contents  
make it very different from the other  
three, and since some early sources  
mention only the first three Vedas, it  
apparently gained authority as a Veda  
sometime later.
