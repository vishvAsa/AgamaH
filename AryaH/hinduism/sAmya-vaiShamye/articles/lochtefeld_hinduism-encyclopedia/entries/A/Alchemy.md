Esoteric tradition that seeks to transform, transmute, and perfect the  
body through the use of various  
chemicals, with the ultimate goal of  
rendering the body immortal. Both  
Hindus and Buddhists have alchemical  
schools. The reported difference  
between the Buddhist **rasayana** school  
and the Hindu **dhatuvada** school is  
that the latter is solely materially  
based, whereas the former stresses  
meditation to gain final enlightenment. These two schools agree on  
many basic points of alchemy.  
Hindu alchemists view the world as  
a series of bipolar opposites in tension  
with one another, and they are convinced that unifying these opposing  
forces brings spiritual progress and  
the end of reincarnation (**samsara**).  
Hindu alchemy shares this model of  
uniting or transcending opposing  
forces with Hindu **tantra**, an esoteric,  
ritually based system of religious practice, and with **hatha yoga**, which is  
based on a series of physical exercises  
that are also believed to affect the **subtle body**. Although all three traditions  
share a common assumption, they  
prescribe different forms of practice to  
effect the final goal: in tantra, ritual; in  
hatha yoga, physical exercises; and in  
alchemy, physical consumption of various substances.  
In the alchemical tradition, the  
governing metaphor for this combination of opposites is the union of **sun**  
and **moon**. In Hindu tradition the sun  
and moon are connected to other  
opposing principles through an elaborate series of associations. The sun is  
identified with heat, drying power,  
**fire**, **Shakti**, and menstrual **blood**; the  
moon with coolness, healing power,  
**water**, **Shiva**, and **semen**. In alchemical practice the two essential chemical  
elements are **mercury** and **sulfur**—the  
former identified with Shiva’s semen  
and the latter with Shakti’s uterine  
blood. By properly mixing and consuming these elements, the aspirant’s  
body is purified and refined, eventually  
rendering it immortal. Modern descriptions of this practice invariably warn  
that it should only be carried out  
under the direction of one’s **guru** (spiritual teacher), since otherwise these  
combinations will be harmful. This  
warning is not surprising since mercury is a deadly poison. For further
