title = "Ammonite"

+++
Spiral-shaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea creature. The black stones in  
which these fossil shells are embedded  
are known as **shalagrams** and are  
found in great numbers in the **Kali**  
**Gandaki** River in **Nepal**. The name  
*ammonite* comes from the Latin  
33  
Ammonite  
expression meaning “horn of Ammon,”  
which refers to a form of the god  
**Jupiter** that bears rams’ horns. In India  
the ammonite’s circular form is understood as a symbol of **Vishnu’s** discus  
(**chakra**), and thus the shalagram is  
considered a **svayambhu** “self-manifested” image of Vishnu himself. As  
with all svayambhu forms of a **deity**,  
the shalagram is considered to be  
extraordinarily holy and is usually kept  
as an object of **worship**.
