title = "Arjuna"

+++
The third of the five **Pandava** brothers in  
the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics. Arjuna is born when  
his mother, **Kunti**, uses a powerful  
**mantra** to have a **son** by **Indra**, the king  
of the gods.  
Arjuna is the prototypical **kshatriya**  
warrior-king. He is described as peerless  
in battle, a hero ever ready to defend the  
truth, and a person always faithful to his  
word—but at times arrogant, egocentric, quick to anger, and inclined to use  
force to settle disputes.  
Arjuna is most famous as an archer,  
as which he has no equal. When he and  
his brothers are studying archery with  
their teacher **Drona**, Arjuna outshines  
them all with his dedication and ability,  
but his spiteful side can be seen in the  
story of **Ekalavya**. Ekalavya is a tribal  
boy who wants to learn archery from  
Drona, the royal archery teacher, but is  
refused because of his low **birth**.  
Undaunted, Ekalavya makes a clay  
image of Drona, treats it as his teacher  
(**guru**), and through his assiduous practice and his devotion to his guru  
becomes the most skilled archer on  
**earth**. When Arjuna discovers this, he  
becomes jealous and complains to  
Drona, since the teacher has promised  
Arjuna that no one will surpass him as  
an archer. Drona asks Ekalavya how he  
has become so skillful, and when he  
learns that Ekalavya has worshiped  
Drona’s image as his guru, Drona notes  
that he is entitled to a preceptor’s fee  
(**dakshina**). As his fee he requests  
Ekalavya’s right thumb, a gift that will  
considerably diminish Ekalavya’s  
shooting abilities since its loss will  
impair his ability to draw a bow.  
Ekalavya fulfills Drona’s wish without  
hesitation but from that day on he is no  
longer better than Arjuna.  
Another instance of Arjuna’s narrowmindedness comes in his claim that  
another great rival, **Karna**, cannot compete in a royal shooting competition  
because Karna is a foundling, and his  
lineage is thus unknown. Karna is a  
close companion of Arjuna’s cousin  
**Duryodhana**, and because of this insult  
the relations begin to deteriorate  
between the Pandavas and the  
**Kauravas**, the two branches of this  
extended family. The final result is the  
fratricidal civil war that is the climax of  
the epic.  
Throughout the *Mahabharata*,  
Arjuna is associated with numerous  
heroic exploits. To fulfill a promise given  
to his teacher Drona, Arjuna defeats  
King **Drupada**, who has earlier insulted  
Drona. Through a feat of archery, he  
wins the hand of **Draupadi** by drawing a  
bow that others cannot even lift and  
then hits a target suspended in the air.  
He aids the **fire** god, **Agni**, in the burning  
of the **Khandava forest**. He shields Agni  
from the rain by creating a tent of arrows  
that keeps the forest covered. During the  
year that the Pandavas spend incognito,  
after twelve years of exile in the forest,  
Arjuna takes the guise of the eunuch  
**Brhannala** and in this guise wins a great  
battle against the Kauravas.  
His greatest exploits occur during the  
epic’s climactic eighteen-day war, in  
which he defeats the Kaurava armies,  
fights all their major figures, and finally  
53  
Arjuna  
kills his long-standing adversary Karna,  
who is actually his own half brother.  
After destroying the Kauravas in  
the Mahabharata war, Arjuna serves  
his elder brother, **Yudhishthira**,  
who becomes king; after the conflict,  
however, the need for such a warrior  
has passed.  
Arjuna is also known as a listener. At  
the moment when the great war is about  
to begin, Arjuna has sudden doubts  
about the propriety of killing his friends  
and relatives, even during a just war. To  
allay his doubts and to help him regain  
his resolve, his charioteer **Krishna**  
recites the **Bhagavad Gita**, one of the  
single most influential Hindu religious  
texts. The Gita’s advice on the nature of  
Self, struggle, and the search for God has  
served to counsel those fighting literal  
and metaphorical battles, most notably  
**Mohandas K**. **Gandhi** during the struggle  
for Indian independence.
