title = "Ascetic"

+++
In the most general sense, this word  
denotes a person who has renounced  
regular society and conventional social  
life in a quest to seek religious  
insight and to gain final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**). Such spiritual seekers  
sometimes emphasize **asceticism** or  
physical discipline, but this is not a  
necessary element.  
Ascetics can be organized into  
different subgroups based upon  
organizational affiliation or the  
particular Hindu **deity** that they  
**worship**. The **Bairagis**, **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasis**, and **Nathpanthis** are all  
well-defined ascetic organizations  
into which one must undertake formal  
**initiation**; the Bairagis are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and the  
other two are devotees of **Shiva**.

The **sadhu** (“straight”) is the other  
major type of ascetic and the most difficult to define. Most sadhus are unaffiliated with any religious organization,  
have undertaken no formal ascetic initiation, and fall outside the other groups’  
sectarian boundaries. A sadhu is a solitary religious seeker, driven to attain  
religious goals by doing whatever seems  
best to him (or more rarely, to her).
