title = "Aryabhatta"

+++
Ancient astronomer and mathematician, whose major work was composed  
in 499 C.E. Among Aryabhattaâ€™s accomplishments were his theories that the  
**earth** was a sphere that rotated on its  
axis, and that **eclipses** were caused by  
the shadow of the **moon**. He also calculated the value of *pi* to four decimal  
places and the length of the **year** to  
seven decimal places. Both these feats  
show not only great facility with mathematics but also the use of the zero.  
Although Aryabhatta is celebrated as  
a scientist, in the ancient world there was  
no differentiation between astronomer  
and astrologer. Given the assumption  
that the heavenly bodies influenced  
human affairs, his astronomical conclusions would have also been used in the  
field of astrology.
