title = "Asat"

+++
This word denotes a general category  
in Indian speculative thought and is  
often translated as “nonbeing.” It is  
the absolute opposite of **sat** and is  
formed by the addition of the negative  
prefix. If sat is “that which (really and  
truly) exists,” then its opposite is “that  
which does not exist.” Since the word  
*sat* also carries connotations of  
Truth—that things that exist are both  
“real” and “true”—*asat* carries connotations of falseness.
