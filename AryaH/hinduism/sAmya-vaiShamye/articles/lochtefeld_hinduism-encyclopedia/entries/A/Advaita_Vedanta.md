One of the branches of **Vedanta**, the  
philosophical school claiming to reveal  
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the  
ancient sacred texts known as the **Vedas**.  
The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism,  
which is the belief that a single Ultimate  
Reality lies behind all things. Advaita  
proponents believe that reality is nondual (advaita)—that is, that everything  
in the world is actually the formless,  
unqualified **Brahman**, despite the  
appearance of difference and diversity.  
To support this claim, the Advaitins provide a convincing explanation for the  
world one perceives to have many separate and diverse things.  
Advaitans account for this apparent  
diversity by using the concept of  
**adhyasa** (superimposition), in which a  
false, mistaken understanding is projected upon a real object—in the classical Advaita example, seeing a rope in the  
twilight and mistaking it for a snake. For  
the Advaitins, the “snake” is not completely unreal, since it depends on the  
rope for its existence—one cannot see  
the snake unless the rope is there. At the  
same time, the “snake” is clearly not real  
since one does not persist in this error,  
and once the illusion of the snake has  
been dispelled, one can no longer see it.  
In the same way, the Advaitins  
believe that our idea of the phenomenal  
everyday world is projected upon the  
one thing in the universe that is truly  
real—Brahman. Like the snake, the  
world is unreal as it is perceived but real  
insofar as it depends on Brahman. For  
the Advaitins, the roots of adhyasa are  
epistemological, that is, related to how  
human beings come to know things, but  
the results of adhyasa are both epistemological and ontological (related to how  
things actually are). On one hand,  
adhyasa obscures the Ultimate Reality  
and prevents one from accurately perceiving it, and on the other, its projective  
character creates our notions of the  
world. For the Advaitins, the source of all  
this confusion is ultimately rooted in  
**avidya**, or primal ignorance, under the  
influence of which one forms mistaken  
ideas about the world. The operation of  
this ignorance is said to have no beginning, but one of the things that keeps it  
going is one’s **karma**, based on the continuing actions caused by this mistaken  
understanding. Another source of this  
ignorance is the power of illusion (**maya**)  
wielded by God (**Ishvara**), which bewilders human beings. For the Advaita  
Vedantin, God is identified as a qualified  
(**saguna**) form of Brahman—thus below  
the highest unqualified (**nirguna**)  
Brahman, and himself a product of  
superimposition.  
Since the Advaita school believes that  
the source of bondage to karma results  
from mistaken understanding, the only  
way to destroy bondage is to gain the correct understanding. Although the  
Advaitans say that people must perform  
obligatory religious actions (**nitya**  
**karma**) as a matter of duty, actions can  
never bring about the understanding that  
is necessary for salvation, although they  
may aid the process by removing some of  
the karmic obstacles. To support this  
understanding, the Advaitins begin their  
analysis with an appeal to the knowing  
subject as the one thing that can never be  
doubted, and claim that this self-consciousness is evidence for the existence  
of the inner Self, or **atman**. Aside from  
this appeal to experience, they depend  
heavily on the authority of the sacred  
texts, particularly the **Upanishads**, to  
uphold their key doctrines: that Brahman  
is the source of all things; that the human  
soul is ultimately identical to Brahman,  
although hampered by obstructions  
12  
Advaita Vedanta  
based on past karma; and that gaining  
true knowledge is the basis of liberation.  
The first and greatest Advaita thinker  
was the philosopher **Shankaracharya**;  
other significant figures were his two disciples, **Sureshvara** and **Padmapada**, as  
well as **Mandana Mishra** and **Vachaspati**  
**Mishra**. For further information see Karl
