+++
(“eight bends”) In the **Mahabharata**,  
the later of the two great Hindu epics,  
Ashtavakra is a sage who is the **son** of  
Khagodara. According to tradition,  
Ashtavakra is an exceptionally precocious child, and this gets him into serious trouble. While he is still in his  
mother’s womb, Ashtavakra corrects his  
father’s pronunciation of a certain  
**mantra**. In response his father curses  
him to be bent, and when the child is  
born he has eight bends in his body.  
Despite his unusual appearance,  
Ashtavakra becomes a learned sage and  
is widely believed to be the author of the  
*Ashtavakragita* (“Song of Ashtavakra”).  
This text describes the philosophical  
concept of monism, which is the belief  
that a single Supreme Reality (named  
**Brahman**) lies behind the entire universe, and that all things are merely differing manifestations of this reality.
