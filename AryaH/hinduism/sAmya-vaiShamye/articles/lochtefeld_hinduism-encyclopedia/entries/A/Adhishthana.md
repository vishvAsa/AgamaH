title = "Adhishthana"

+++
(“foundation”) In Hindu temple **architecture**, the raised base on which a temple was built. These are particularly high  
in the temples at **Khajuraho**, and their  
height accentuates the upward thrust of  
these temples. Whether high or low, the  
adhishthana is important as the temple’s  
foundation, the stable base on which all  
else rests.
