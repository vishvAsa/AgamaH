Fourth month in the Tamil solar **year**,  
corresponding to the northern Indian  
solar month of Karkata (the zodiacal  
sign of Cancer), which usually falls  
within July and August. The existence of  
several different **calendars** is one clear  
sign of the continuing importance of  
regional cultural patterns. One way that  
the Tamils retain their culture is by  
preserving their traditional calendar.  
Tamil is one of the few regional  
languages in India with an ancient,  
well-established literary tradition. See  
also **Tamil months**, **Tamil Nadu**, and  
**Tamil language**.
