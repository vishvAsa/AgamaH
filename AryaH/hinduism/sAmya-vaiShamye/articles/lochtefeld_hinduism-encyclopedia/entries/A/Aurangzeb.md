title = "Aurangzeb"

(r. 1658–1707) The last of the great  
emperors in the **Moghul dynasty**, after  
whose reign the empire, which at its  
zenith stretched over most of the Indian  
subcontinent, was fragmented into  
smaller kingdoms. Aurangzeb was a very  
strict and pious Muslim who is generally  
painted as an enemy of Hinduism. He is  
the “bad” Moghul emperor, as opposed  
to his great-grandfather **Akbar**, the  
“good” Moghul emperor. Aurangzeb  
unquestionably ordered several notable  
acts of iconoclasm, the most renowned  
being the destruction of the **Vishvanath**  
temple in the city of **Benares**; however,  
the records from his reign also include  
orders that the Hindus of that city  
should not be hindered from practicing  
their religion.  
One possible theory that reconciles  
these contradictions is that the destruction of the Vishvanath temple and other  
acts of iconoclasm were done for political rather than religious reasons, to punish local populations for rebellion and  
noncooperation. One piece of evidence  
for this theory is that the year before the  
destruction of the Vishvanath temple,  
the **Mahanirvani akhara** in Benares took  
part in a battle with Aurangzeb’s soldiers.
