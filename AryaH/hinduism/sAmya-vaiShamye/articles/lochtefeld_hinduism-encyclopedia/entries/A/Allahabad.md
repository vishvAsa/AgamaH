(“City of Allah”) City at the junction of  
the **Ganges** and **Yamuna** rivers. The city  
was named Allahabad by the Moghul  
emperor **Akbar**, who built a fort there in  
1583 to signify Moghul control of the  
region. Traditionally, the place where the  
rivers meet is considered a sacred  
bathing (**snana**) place, and the city was  
called Prayaga (“place of **sacrifice**”) by  
the Hindus. This name is still used to  
distinguish the sacred site (**tirtha**) from  
the city surrounding it. Another name  
for the junction is **Triveni** (“triple  
stream”), reflecting the traditional belief  
that the two visible rivers are joined at  
the confluence by a third underground  
river, the **Saraswati**. Near the bathing  
place is a banyan tree believed to be the  
**akshaya vata** (“indestructible banyan  
tree”), which despite its powerful name  
is at present very small.  
As with all places where the Ganges  
makes some natural transition—here  
its confluence with another sacred  
river—Prayaga is considered especially  
holy, and bathing there is believed to  
confer even greater religious merit  
than a normal Ganges bath. This sanctity can be further amplified by  
bathing during particularly auspicious times in the **calendar**. For  
example, the annual **Magh Mela** is a  
bathing festival held during the **lunar**  
**month** of **Magh** (January–February).  
The holiest time for bathing is during  
a festival called **Kumbha Mela**, which  
is held approximately every twelve  
years when **Jupiter** is in Taurus. The  
Kumbha Mela is followed six years  
later by the **Ardha** (“half”) **Kumbha**  
**Mela**, which carries less sanctity than  
the “full” Kumbha Mela but is still  
considered a highly propitious event.  
Allahabad’s Kumbha Mela in 1989 was  
the largest religious festival on earth,  
attended by an estimated fifteen million people on a single day.
