(“Recognition of **Shakuntala**”) Drama  
written by **Kalidasa** (5th c. C.E.), who is  
widely considered the greatest classical  
**Sanskrit** poet. The *Abhijnanashakuntala*  
describes the trials and troubles of the  
mythical heroine Shakuntala and is considered Kalidasa’s greatest drama. In the  
story, Shakuntala, the **daughter** of the  
sage **Vishvamitra** and the celestial  
nymph **Menaka**, attracts the eye of  
King **Dushyanta** while he is away from  
his kingdom on a hunting trip.  
Shakuntala and Dushyanta marry by  
mutual consent, in what is known as a  
**gandharva marriage**. After their marriage, Dushyanta returns to his kingdom. Shakuntala remains at her home  
and has the misfortune to irritate the  
sage **Durvasas**, who **curses** her to be  
forgotten by her beloved. Shakuntala  
pleads with Durvasas, who is moved to  
mitigate the curse such that  
Dushyanta will remember everything  
if Shakuntala can show Dushyanta a  
sign of their union. Dushyanta had  
given Shakuntala his signet ring, but  
she loses it before she can see him.  
Denied by Dushyanta, Shakuntala  
endures numerous trials until she  
finds the ring in the belly of a fish.  
When Dushyanta sees the ring, he  
immediately recognizes Shakuntala  
(hence the play’s name), and they live  
happily ever after.  
The *Abhijnanashakuntala* has two  
features that characterize most classical  
Sanskrit plays. One is the preference for  
a happy ending, although this resolution

Abhijnanashakuntala  
is usually preceded by trial and tribulation. The other is that the drama’s  
dialogue is in two different languages.  
Characters from the higher classes  
speak Sanskrit, the language of high,  
learned culture. Characters from the  
lower classes (including many of the  
**women**) speak in **Prakrit**, an umbrella  
term for the grammatically simpler  
vernacular languages that developed  
from Sanskrit through natural linguistic  
change. This difference in dialogue  
doubtless reflected the social realities of  
the time in which the play was written,  
when Sanskrit would have been the elite  
language but was always learned as a  
second language after learning one’s  
“natural” language. The play has been  
translated into English by Michael  
Coulson and published in an anthology  
titled *Three Sanskrit Plays*, 1981.
