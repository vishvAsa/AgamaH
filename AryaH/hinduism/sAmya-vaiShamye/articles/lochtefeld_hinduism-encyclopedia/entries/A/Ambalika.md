+++
In the Hindu epic the **Mahabharata**,  
Ambalika is the **daughter** of the king of  
**Kashi** and one of the wives of King  
**Vichitravirya**. When Vichitravirya dies  
childless, his mother, **Satyavati**, calls  
upon her eldest **son**, **Vyasa**, to sleep with  
Ambalika and her sister **Ambika** in the  
hope that the **women** will conceive and  
continue the family line. According to  
tradition, Vyasa is very ugly, and each  
woman involuntarily reacts when Vyasa  
appears in her bed. Ambalika turns pale,  
causing her son **Pandu** to be born with  
an unnaturally pale complexion, and  
Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son  
**Dhrtarashtra** to be born blind.
