title = "Aiteraya Brahmana"

+++
Along with the **Shatapatha Brahmana**,  
the two most important texts in the  
19  
Aiteraya Brahmana  
**Brahmana** stratum of Vedic literature.  
The Brahmanas are primarily manuals  
describing the correct performance of  
Vedic ritual **sacrifices**. Because they were  
composed later than the actual **Vedas**,  
each Brahmana is connected in theory  
with one of the Vedas, to give it authority  
as a sacred Vedic text. According to tradition, the Aiteraya Brahmana is associated  
with the earliest of the Vedas, the **Rg Veda**.
