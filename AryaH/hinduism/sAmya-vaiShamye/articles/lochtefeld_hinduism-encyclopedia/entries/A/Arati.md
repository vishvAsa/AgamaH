title = "Arati"

+++
The act of waving a lighted lamp before  
a **deity**. The deity may be present  
in many forms, such as a picture,  
statue, symbol (**svayambhu image**)  
such as the **shalagram**, or even a  
natural phenomenon such as a river, as  
in the case of the **Ganges**.  
The arati lamp usually is a shallow  
vessel holding a cotton wick soaked in  
oil or clarified butter, with a ring-shaped  
handle to protect oneâ€™s hands. This is  
one of the sixteen traditional **offerings**  
(**upacharas**) presented to a deity as part  
of **worship**. This particular act is the  
offering of light.  
Arati is arguably the single most  
common act of Hindu worship, performed daily in Hindu homes and  
temples throughout the world. Because  
of this fact, the word *arati* is sometimes  
used to refer to any act of worship,  
even singing panegyric hymns during  
worship. Before electric lights were  
invented, when the temples were much  
darker, arati also served to give the  
devotees (**bhakta**) in the temples a  
better view of the deity, which was  
very important.
