title = "Ajamila"

+++
In Hindu mythology Ajamila is an example of a completely corrupted sinner,  
who is saved from Death by the boundless power of God’s **grace**. Ajamila is a  
fallen **brahmin** who does all the things  
forbidden to brahmins—he eats meat,  
drinks **liquor**, takes a low **caste** woman as  
his mistress, and ignores all the **purity**  
laws which brahmins are supposed to  
keep. His only redeeming feature is his  
love for his **son Narayana**, which is also  
one of the names of **Vishnu**. As he lies  
dying, Ajamila sees the minions of Death  
coming for him, whose terrible forms  
portend a dire fate. In his terror at this  
vision and his longing for his son, Ajamila  
calls out “Narayana” with his dying  
breath, and because of this Vishnu sends  
his minions to rescue Ajamila. Ajamila is  
brought to **Vaikuntha**, Vishnu’s dwelling  
place, where he lives happily.
