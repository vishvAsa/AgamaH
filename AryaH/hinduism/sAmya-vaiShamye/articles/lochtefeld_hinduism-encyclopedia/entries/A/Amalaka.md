title = "Amalaka"

+++
In the **Nagara** style of Hindu temple  
**architecture**, the amalaka is a stone  
disk, usually with ridges on the rim, that  
sits on top of the templeâ€™s main tower.  
According to one interpretation, the  
amalaka represents a lotus and is thus  
the symbolic seat for the **deity** worshiped below. Another interpretation is  
that it symbolizes the **sun** and is thus the  
gateway to the heavenly world. The  
amalaka itself is crowned with a **kalasha**  
(finial), from which a temple banner is  
often hung. See also **heavens**.
