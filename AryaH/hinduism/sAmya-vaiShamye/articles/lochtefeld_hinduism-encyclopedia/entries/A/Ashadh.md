title = "Ashadh"

+++
According to the lunar **calendar**, by which  
most Hindu religious festivals are celebrated, Ashadh is the fourth month in the  
lunar **year**, usually falling within June and  
July. In northern India, this is usually the  
hottest month of the year.  
The major holidays celebrated in  
Ashadh are **Yogini Ekadashi**, the **Rath**  
**Yatra**, **Devshayani Ekadashi**, and **Guru**  
**Purnima**. Devshayani Ekadashi also  
marks the beginning of the **Chaturmas Vrat**.  
This is a four-month (lunar) period  
generally coinciding with the rainy  
**season**. During this time the god  
**Vishnu** is believed to be “sleeping,”  
and because of this the period is considered inauspicious.
