(“discrimination of something else”)  
A **theory of error** that aims to explain  
why people make errors in judgment,  
such as the stock example of mistaking the flash of a seashell for a piece  
of silver. This particular theory of  
error originated with the **Naiyayika**  
philosophical school. Like the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** philosopher **Prabhakara**,  
the Naiyayikas believe that the simple  
judgments “that object is silvery” and  
“silver is silvery” are both true and  
indisputable. Whereas Prabhakara  
explains the error as an error of omission, in which one fails to notice the  
non-relationship between these judgments, the Naiyayikas explain this as  
an error of commission, by projecting  
something that actually is not there.  
In Naiyayikan metaphysics all  
objects and their attributes are connected by a dependent relationship  
known as **inherence** (**samavaya**),  
which in this case connects a silvery  
color with two different objects: elemental silver, and a shell. They believe  
that the perceiver is projecting a wrong  
inherence relationship (silver) onto the  
perceived object (shell).  
The Naiyayikas can claim this  
projection is real because they  
accept the reality of nonexistent  
things (e.g., the nonexistence of  
a crocodile in my bathtub). For  
the Naiyayikas all such projections  
are rooted in karmic dispositions  
stemming from **avidya**, or primal  
ignorance, specifically the greed  
for silver that prompts people to  
look for such items of value. For
