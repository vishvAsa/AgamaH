title = "Amaru"

+++
(7th c.?) **Sanskrit** poet traditionally  
thought to be the author of the  
**Amarushatakam** (“Amaru’s Hundred”),  
a collection of poems on the theme of  
**erotic** love. The text’s name is doubly  
misleading since present editions contain almost 200 poems, and there is  
strong evidence that it was compiled  
from several earlier collections, making  
its authorship uncertain. Although  
Amaru’s poetry explores the joys of carnal love and is thus not explicitly religious, the themes of lover/beloved  
and union/separation treated in this  
poetry later became standard themes in  
**bhakti** (devotional) poetry. In the  
**Shankaradigvijaya**, a legendary  
biography of the philosopher

Amaru  
The outside entrance of the limestone caves at Amarnath.  
This is a sacred site in which the god Shiva is believed to reside.  
**Shankaracharya**, Amaru is described as  
a king who becomes mythically connected with the great sage. In response  
to the challenge that he knows nothing  
about sexuality, Shankaracharya uses  
his yogic powers to animate Amaru’s  
body immediately after the latter’s  
death. In this form Shankaracharya  
experiences this facet of human life,  
although reportedly without desire on  
his part. Shankaracharya has sexual  
relations with Amaru’s wives, enjoys  
the fruits of passion, and pens the  
*Amarushatakam* to record his deeds.  
Although this claim is highly doubtful,  
it helps to illustrate some important  
thematic connections between religious and erotic poetry. For further  
information see Lee Siegel, *Fires of*  
*Love*—*Waters of Peace*, 1983.
