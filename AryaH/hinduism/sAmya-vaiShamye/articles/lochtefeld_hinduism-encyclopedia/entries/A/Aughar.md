title = "Aughar"

+++
Name given to a novice in the **ascetic**  
community known as the **Naths**, who  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**.  
An aughar has been initiated as a member of the Naths and has taken up their  
ascetic way of life, but he has not yet  
received his final **initiation**. In this final  
ritual, the cartilage in the novice’s ears is  
pierced in order to insert the large earrings that are one of the **Nath** community’s defining characteristics.
