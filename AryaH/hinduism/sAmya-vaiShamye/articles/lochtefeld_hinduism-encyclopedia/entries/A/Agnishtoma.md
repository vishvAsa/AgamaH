title = "Agnishtoma"

+++
Particular rite of **sacrifice** prescribed  
in the later strands of the **Vedas**, the  
earliest Hindu sacred texts. The  
agnishtoma was most often performed  
in the early spring and was dedicated  
to the Vedic god **Agni** (**fire**). The riteâ€™s  
two central elements were the pressing and consumption of the mysterious sacrificial drink called **soma** (seen  
as a material form of the Vedic god  
Soma), and the slaughter of sacrificial  
**animals**, which were burned on the  
16  
Agnihotra  
sacrificial fire (the god Agni in material  
form). A final chant during the sacrifice  
was addressed to Agni. During the  
Vedic period, this rite became largely  
the province of kings since they were  
the only people who could command  
the necessary resources for it. With the  
later reaction against **animal sacrifice**,  
the rite fell out of favor, although it is  
still performed occasionally in a modified fashion without sacrifice.
