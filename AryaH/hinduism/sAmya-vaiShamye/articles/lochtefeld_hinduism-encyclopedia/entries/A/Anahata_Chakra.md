title = "Anahata Chakra"

+++
In many schools of **yoga** and in the  
esoteric ritual tradition known as  
**tantra**, the anahata chakra is one of  
the six psychic centers (**chakras**)  
believed to exist in the **subtle body**.  
The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system, thought to be on  
a different plane of existence than  
gross matter but with certain correspondences to the material body. It  
is comprised of a set of six psychic  
centers, which are envisioned as  
multi-petaled lotus flowers running  
roughly along the course of the spine,  
connected by three vertical channels.  
Each of these chakras has important  
symbolic associationsâ€”with differing  
human capacities, different subtle elements (**tanmatras**), and different seed  
syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed from  
the letters of the **Sanskrit** alphabet,  
thus encompassing all sacred sound.  
Above and below these centers are,  
respectively, **Shiva** (embodying awareness) and **Shakti** (embodying power),  
the two divine principles through  
which the entire universe has come  
into being. The underlying assumption behind this concept of the subtle  
body is thus the harmony of macrocosm and microcosm, an essential  
Hindu idea since the time of the mystical texts known as the **Upanishads**.  
The six chakras are traditionally  
listed from the bottom up, and the  
anahata chakra is the fourth. It is visualized as a twelve-petaled lotus located in the region of the heart. These  
petals each contain a seed syllable  
formed from a letter of the Sanskrit  
alphabet, in this case the first twelve  
consonants. On a symbolic level, the  
anahata chakra is associated with the  
circulation of **blood** throughout the  
body. It is also identified as the bodily  
seat for the subtle element of **wind**,  
the action of which (through the operation of the five **vital winds** known as  
**pranas**) is believed to be responsible for  
circulating things through the body. For

*Tantra*, 1973.
