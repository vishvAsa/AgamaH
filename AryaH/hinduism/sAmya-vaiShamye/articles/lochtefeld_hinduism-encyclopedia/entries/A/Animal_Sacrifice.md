title = "Animal Sacrifice"

+++
The practice of animal sacrifice can be  
found in two different strands of the  
Hindu tradition. The first, and by far the  
earliest, is in the cult of sacrifice described  
in the later strata of the **Vedas**, particularly  
in the **Brahmana** literature. The cost of  
these rites virtually ensured that they  
could only be performed by royalty and  
nobility, since some entailed the slaughter  
of hundreds of **animals**.  
Perhaps the most famous of these rites  
was the horse sacrifice (**ashvamedha**),  
which served to prove a king’s great power.  
In the early centuries before the common  
era, these sacrifices grew less frequent—a  
trend often connected to the stress on  
**ahimsa** by the Buddhists and Jains, two  
groups that opposed the slaughter of any  
life—and by the early centuries of the  
common era, even Hindu commentators  
denounced the Vedic sacrifices because  
they entailed animal slaughter. In modern  
times, these rites have largely fallen into  
disuse, and even when they have been  
revived and re-created, they usually do not  
involve animal slaughter but substitutions  
of some sort, such as vegetables or fruits.  
The other context in which animal sacrifice can be found, and is still performed  
quite regularly, is in the **worship** of **village**  
**deities**, or certain powerful and terrifying  
forms of the **Goddess**. In this worship the  
animals (usually goats) are decapitated,  
and the **blood** is offered to the **deity**, often  
by smearing some of it on a post outside of  
the temple.  
In Hindu culture, blood is considered  
a “hot” substance—highly impure,  
extremely powerful, and readily contaminating other things. Any deity that  
requires sacrifice is also “hot”—powerful  
enough to grant favors to their devotees  
(**bhakta**), but also marginal, potentially  
dangerous, and requiring frequent animal  
sacrifice to maintain their power.  
The most extreme example is at the  
temple of the goddess **Kamakhya** in  
modern **Assam**, a region located in  
northeastern India. This is one of the few  
reported instances of **human sacrifice**,  
although the custom was halted by the  
British in 1832. When Kamakhya’s present  
temple was consecrated in 1565, she was  
supposedly offered the heads of 140 men,  
all of whom had volunteered themselves  
as **offerings**.  
Although such blood-drinking deities  
are often very powerful, many Hindus do  
not approve of the impurity (**ashaucha**)  
and slaughter connected with animal sacrifice. For this reason, one of the first ways  
to make a particular deity acceptable to a  
more cultured public is often to make the  
sacrifices vegetarian, by substituting a  
gourd or cucumber in place of the sacrificial animal.
