title = "Anrta"

+++
In the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu scriptures  
that are still the most authoritative religious texts, anrta is characterized as the  
opposite of **rta**, the cosmic order. Anrta is  
particularly associated with falsehood and  
untruth, and it involves acts of deliberate  
perversions of speech. Hindus believe that  
these mistruths undermine the established order of the cosmos.
