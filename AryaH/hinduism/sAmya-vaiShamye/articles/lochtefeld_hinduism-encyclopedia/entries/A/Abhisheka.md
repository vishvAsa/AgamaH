(“anointing”) Ritual bathing (**snana**) or  
anointing with **water**, particularly of  
the image of a **deity** during **worship**. In  
earlier times this term referred to the  
ritual anointing of a king at his coronation (**rajabhiseka**). In modern times  
the term can also apply to anointing or  
sprinkling individuals with water during religious or life cycle rituals, particularly rites of **initiation** (**diksha**)  
involving a change of status for the initiate—such as the shift from householder to initiated **ascetic** or in the  
ritual tradition known as **tantra**, an  
initiation bestowing certain ritual and  
religious qualifications (**adhikara**). In  
both cases the anointing is intended to  
honor the initiate, to evoke images of  
royal coronation, and to suggest the  
importance of the occasion.
