title = "Apsara"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a class of celestial  
nymphs renowned for their beauty,  
**grace**, and irresistible attractiveness.  
One of their main mythic functions is  
to seduce **ascetics** and sages when they  
become too powerful. Because ascetics  
practice **celibacy**, and it is assumed  
that celibacy builds spiritual power,  
successful ascetics can become rivals  
to the gods themselves. Sexual activity  
will quickly exhaust the ascetic’s power,  
although it can often bring other benefits to the world, including the **birth** of  
children, which always results from  
such intimate encounters.  
The apsaras are sent on their missions by **Indra**, the king of **heaven**,  
since any ascetic who gains too much  
power will be able to claim Indra’s  
divine throne. One famous apsara is  
**Menaka**, whose seduction of the  
sage **Vishvamitra** results in the birth  
of **Shakuntala**. Another is **Urvashi**,  
who is renowned for her dalliance with  
King **Pururavas**.
