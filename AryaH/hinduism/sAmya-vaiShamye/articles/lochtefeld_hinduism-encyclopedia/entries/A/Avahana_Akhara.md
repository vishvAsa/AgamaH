title = "Avahana Akhara"

+++
The name of a particular group of the  
**Naga** class of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
which is comprised of renunciant  
71  
Avahana Akhara  
**ascetics**. The Dashanami Nagas are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**,  
organized into **akharas**, or regiments,  
on the model of an army. Until the  
beginning of the nineteenth century, the  
Nagas’ primary occupation was as mercenary soldiers, although they also had  
substantial trading interests; both of  
these occupations have largely disappeared in contemporary times.  
The Avahana akhara is one of the  
seven main Dashanami Naga akharas,  
but for organizational purposes it is  
considered a subsidiary of the **Juna**  
**akhara**. Its name, which means “summons,” supposedly comes from its status as the first organized **ascetic** group,  
formed in response to the call from the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya** to revitalize Hindu society.
