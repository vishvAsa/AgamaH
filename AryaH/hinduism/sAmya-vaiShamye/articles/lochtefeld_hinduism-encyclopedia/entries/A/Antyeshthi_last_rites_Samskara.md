The sixteenth and last of the traditional  
life-cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**),  
comprising what can be described as  
45  
Antyeshthi (“last rites”) Samskara  
A woman prepares a deceased man for cremation.  
This ritual is one stage of the antyeshthi samskara, the traditional Hindu funerary rites.  
funerary rites. These rites are not a single action, but a series: **deathbed rites**  
for the dying person, **cremation** for the  
**corpse**, **asthi-sanchayana** (gathering  
the ashes), **sapindikarana** (assimilation  
to the ancestors), various memorial rites  
known as **shraddhas**, and **asthivisarjana** (immersing the ashes in  
a sacred river).  
These rites have a twofold purpose.  
The first is to get rid of the corpse,  
which is a source of contagion and  
impurity (**ashaucha**), and thus to protect the living from the dead. The second is to ease the passage of the dead  
person’s spirit into the next world.  
Aside from these functions, performing familiar and ceremonial rites for  
the dead undoubtedly gives psychological relief to the living and aids in  
the process of grieving. What follows is  
merely an overview of these rites; for  
more detailed information see the  
individual entries.  
Ritual activities are the most concentrated during the first ten days  
after death, which is believed to be the  
period of greatest impurity.  
Cremation usually takes place on the  
day of death, not only to prevent  
decay and disease in a hot climate but  
also to destroy the body so it will not  
be reanimated by a wandering spirit.  
Gathering the ashes (asthi*-*sanchayana) is done on the second or  
third day. In earlier times they would  
have been kept in a safe place, sometimes for years, until a relative visiting  
a sacred river could perform asthi*-*visarjana (immersing the ashes); with the  
advent of modern transportation, this  
is generally performed a few days  
after death.  
During this ten-day period, the  
spirit is given symbolic nourishment to  
help build a “new” body. On the  
eleventh day, the family performs the  
first of the memorial ceremonies  
known as shraddhas; in this case an  
**ekoddishta** shraddha is performed in  
which **brahmin** guests, considered  
surrogates for the ancestors, are fed.  
On the twelfth day after death, the  
family performs the rite of  
sapindikarana, through which the  
deceased is incorporated into the  
ranks of the **ancestral spirits** (pitr) and  
is thus no longer considered a restless  
spirit. This is followed by anniversary  
shraddhas at regular intervals during  
the first year; after this period there is  
an annual shraddha once a year during  
the **Pitrpaksha** (“fortnight of the  
ancestors”), the waning **moon** period  
in the **lunar month** of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September), which is solely  
devoted to such memorials. For further
