title = "Avimukta"

+++
(“unforsaken”) The word *Avimukta*  
carries two shades of meaning: in a  
more general sense, it is a name for the  
city of **Benares**; in a more specific sense,  
it refers to the part of Benares considered to be the sacred heart of the city, in  
the region centered around the  
**Vishvanath** Temple.  
Avimukta gets its name from the  
belief that **Shiva** never leaves this  
place, and because of this its proponents  
claim that it is the holiest spot on **earth**.  
See **Benares**.
