(“the **deity** who is half woman”)  
Particular form of the god **Shiva**, in  
which the left side of the image has  
female form, dress, and ornamentation,  
and the right side has male characteristics and dress.  
The image has several possible interpretations. As a divinity one of Shiva’s  
attributes is his ability to transcend all  
duality, and this half-woman, half-man  
image symbolizes that power over even  
the most basic human difference, sexual  
identity. In the context of the esoteric  
ritual tradition known as **tantra**, which  
describes the universe as the product of  
the interaction between the divine principles of awareness (Shiva) and power  
(**Shakti**), this image symbolizes not only  
the radically different natures of these  
two principles, but also their inseparability in action.  
The Ardhanarishvara is sometimes  
referred to as the androgyne; this term  
seems inappropriate, however, since  
the image does not show the loss  
of sexual characteristics associated  
with androgyny but rather the full  
development of each on their respective sides.
