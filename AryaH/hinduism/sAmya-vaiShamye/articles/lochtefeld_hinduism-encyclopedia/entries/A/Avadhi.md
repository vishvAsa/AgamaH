Avadhi is a language known in two different contexts. In a literary context,  
Avadhi is a dialect of medieval **Hindi**  
(and a sister language of **Braj Bhasha**)  
found in the eastern part of the state of  
**Uttar Pradesh**, in the region surrounding **Ayodhya** (Avadh). It is recognized as the language in which the  
poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532â€“1623?)  
wrote his vernacular retelling of the  
**Ramayana**, the **Ramcharitmanas**.  
In a linguistic context, Avadhi is  
one of the dialects of modern standard  
Hindi spoken throughout the same  
region. Although it shows similarities  
to the language of Tulsidas, it has  
evolved from that version.
