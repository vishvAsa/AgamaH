title = "Antinomianism"

+++
This word has its origins in the convictions of an early Christian sect, whose  
members believed that the only thing  
needed for salvation was faith, and  
not obedience to moral rules. In an  
extended sense, this term describes  
an attitude in which people ignore  
accepted social rules.  
In Indian society (as in all societies)  
most people uphold the accepted  
behavioral norms, but certain groups—  
particularly renunciant **ascetics** and  
practitioners of **tantra**, a secret ritual  
tradition—emphasize the breaking of  
society’s normally held rules. For the  
ascetics, such intentional disregard was  
(and is) a symbol of their separateness  
from conventional society; they believe  
that such rules no longer apply to them.  
As a class, ascetics are well-known for  
their unpredictable and sometimes  
uncontrolled behavior.  
The process is more controlled for  
practitioners of tantra and most often  
takes place in a formal ritual setting.  
The stereotypical pattern is to partake  
of the “five forbidden things”  
(**panchamakara**), thus consciously  
breaking societal norms by consuming  
**intoxicants** and nonvegetarian foods, as  
well as practicing illicit sexuality.  
Although tantric antinomianism  
deliberately breaks social taboos, in  
theory it is an attempt to make sacred  
what is normally forbidden. By doing this,  
tantric practitioners destroy embedded  
dualistic ideas that are exemplified by  
notions such as pure and impure.  
From a tantric perspective, the entire  
universe is one principle—often the  
activity of a particular **deity**—which  
means that one must reject all concepts  
based on dualistic thinking. Such  
practices are also seen as proof that  
tantra is superior to other sorts of  
religious activities, since it uses things  
that are normally forbidden. For
