title = "Adultery"

Given the traditional Hindu belief that  
**women** are the vessels and guardians of  
family status, rules about adultery outlined in the **dharma literature** are  
mostly concerned with the conduct of  
women, although these texts do prescribe a penance (**prayashchitta**) for a  
man who commits adultery with  
another man’s wife. As outlined in the  
dharma literature, adultery is much  
more serious for women. It is notable  
that in most cases the dharma does not  
recommend the woman be driven from  
her home. An adulterous woman is to  
perform a rigorous penance until her  
next menstrual period—sleeping on the  
ground, wearing dirty clothes, and getting very little food; during this time she  
also loses her status as a lady of the  
house and whatever domestic authority  
she may have wielded. According to the  
dharma literature, all of this is to end  
with a bath at the end of her menstrual  
period, after which she is accepted back  
at her former status. Women who conceive as a result of adulterous liaisons  
are to be abandoned. In practice this  
often means being secluded and cut off  
from the family, although she still  
receives food. Abandonment is also recommended in certain other cases: in  
adulterous liaisons with a man’s student  
or his **guru**, if a woman attempts to kill  
her husband, or if she kills her fetus. The  
reluctance to completely cast a woman  
away, and the willingness to bring her  
back to her former status after doing  
penance, both reflect the importance of  
marriage and family life in Hindu culture, as well as women’s importance in  
the family.  
Although these prescriptions in the  
dharma literature seem relatively  
humane, often there has been a considerable difference between these prescriptions and a particular group’s  
actual practice. In general, the higher  
the group’s social status (or the more a  
group is trying to improve its social status), the more harshly it treats such  
infractions, since these infractions

injure its social standing. At present this  
disjunction is also affected by the differing attitudes toward sexuality between  
rural and urban contexts, with the latter  
tending to be more permissive and the  
former far more restrictive. These differences are illustrated by occasional  
reports of adulterous women being  
killed to restore the family’s honor; this  
far exceeds even the harshest penalty  
prescribed in the dharma literature.
