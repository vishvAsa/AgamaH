title = "Allama Prabhu"

+++
(12th c. C.E.) Poet-saint and religious  
leader in the **Lingayat** community, a  
**bhakti** (devotional) community that  
**worships Shiva** as the single supreme  
god and rejects all **caste** regulations.  
The Lingayats formed in the southern  
Indian state of **Karnataka**, where they  
still have a considerable presence,  
and the collections of poetry that  
form their most important religious  
texts are composed in the **Kannada**  
language. According to legend,  
Allama was Shiva himself on **earth**,  
and the honorific title “Master”  
(Prabhu) indicates the respect that  
his Lingayat contemporaries granted  
him. In his poetry, Allama spoke from  
the perspective of one who had  
gained final liberation and had completely transcended all ritual and  
worldly ties. For further information

*of Siva*, 1973.
