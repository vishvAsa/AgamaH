title = "Abhaya Hasta"

+++
In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual, a  
particular hand **gesture** (**hasta**) in which  
the hand is held with the palm facing  
out, with the fingers together and pointing upward. The word *abhaya* means  
“without fear,” and the gesture is meant  
to reassure the viewer that all will be  
well. This hand gesture can be found in  
most depictions of the Hindu gods and  
goddesses, particularly when the **deity**  
in question has multiple hands.
