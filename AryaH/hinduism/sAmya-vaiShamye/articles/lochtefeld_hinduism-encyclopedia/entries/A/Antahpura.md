title = "Antahpura"

+++
(“inner city”) In classical times, the name  
for the **women’s** quarters of the palace, so  
designated because they were the most  
stringently protected. Although most  
Hindus had only one wife, in earlier times  
it was not uncommon for kings to have a  
number of wives and concubines, who  
would be housed in the antahpura. In  
such cases the king’s first wife would generally have higher status, since this marriage would often be used to cement a  
political alliance.
