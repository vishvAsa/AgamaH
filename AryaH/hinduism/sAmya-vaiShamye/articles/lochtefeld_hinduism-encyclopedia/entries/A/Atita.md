(“gone beyond”) In its most general  
usage, this term denotes an **ascetic**  
who has completely renounced all  
things and thus “gone beyond” all the  
social boundaries that enmesh normal  
people. It is also the name of a particular low-**caste** community, some of  
whom are ascetics and some of whom  
are householders.
