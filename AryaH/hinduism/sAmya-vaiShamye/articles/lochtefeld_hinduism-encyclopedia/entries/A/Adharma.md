title = "Adharma"

+++
In the **dharma literature**, this term  
designates the absolute opposite of  
**dharma**, the fundamental values that  
serve to uphold society. Although adharma can denote a particular unrighteous  
action, it more widely implies a state of  
affairs in which society has been completely corrupted; the values that  
uphold society have been subverted,  
overturned, or ignored and hence such  
particular unrighteous actions become  
possible, even likely.
