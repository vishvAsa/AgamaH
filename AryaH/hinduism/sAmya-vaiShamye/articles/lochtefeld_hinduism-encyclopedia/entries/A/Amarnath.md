(“The Undying Lord”) Sacred site  
(**tirtha**) and pilgrimage place located  
high in the mountains of **Kashmir**, dedicated to the god **Shiva** in the form of  
Amarnath (The Undying Lord). The  
focus of the site is a limestone cave,  
where each year melting snow trickling  
through the limestone fissures naturally  
forms a pillar of ice. At its largest, this  
pillar can be more than seven feet tall,  
but this can vary significantly from year  
to year depending on the weather. The  
most common **aniconic image** of Shiva  
is the **linga**, a cylindrical form imperfectly described as a “phallic symbol.”  
Hindus believe that the ice pillar in the  
Amarnath cave is a svayambhu, or “selfmanifested,” linga of Shiva. Such lingas  
are not made by human beings but are  
places where Shiva decides to reveal  
himself, out of love for his devotees  
(**bhakta**). Any **svayambhu image** is  
believed to be particularly holy because  
Shiva is thought to be uniquely present.  
These sites are often seen as places  
where prayers and **worship** are particularly efficacious.  
The Amarnath cave is in a remote  
spot that is inaccessible for most of the  
year due to snow. The pilgrimage takes  
place during the month of **Shravan**  
(July–August), with travelers timing  
their trip to arrive on the day  
of the **full moon**. The pilgrimage  
officially begins at the **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasi akhara** in Shrinagar and is led  
by the akhara’s leader (**mahant**), who  
carries a silver mace as an emblem of his  
authority. This preeminence is given to  
**ascetics** because they are living symbols  
of Shiva himself, who is the perfect  
ascetic. Most pilgrims start their journey  
at the town of Pahalgam. From there  
they walk almost thirty miles to  
30  
Amalaka  
Amarnath, crossing two mountain  
ranges on the way. Although the region  
is thinly settled for most of the year, during the pilgrimage season, camps and  
businesses spring up along the route;  
many are run by local Kashmiri  
Muslims, for whom this is a major  
source of livelihood. The **offerings** at the  
shrine are evenly split between the  
mahant, the local **pandas** (Hindu  
pilgrimage priests), and a group of  
Muslims from a village near Pahalgam  
who traditionally maintained the road,  
although the state has done this since  
India has gained independence. During  
the early 1990s, parts of Kashmir were a  
war zone between Indian government  
forces and a variety of Kashmiri Muslim  
groups, some of which pressed for  
greater self-determination and others  
for unification with Pakistan. These  
problems have affected the pilgrimage,  
which passes through some of the most  
contested areas. In 1994 there were several attacks on travelers, reportedly  
prompted by pilgrims chanting antiMuslim slogans, and in 1995 the pilgrimage took place under heavy security  
provided by the Indian army. The 1996  
pilgrimage had no political turmoil, but  
several hundred people died of  
hypothermia caused by a sudden unseasonable snowstorm.
