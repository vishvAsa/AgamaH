title = "Aerial Cars"

+++
One of the standard images in Hindu  
mythology. The most famous of the  
cars is the **Pushpak Viman**, which is  
originally owned by **Kubera**, a minor  
**deity** associated with mountains and  
their mineral wealth. The Pushpak Viman  
is commandeered and stolen by **Ravana**,  
the **demon**-king of **Lanka**. In modern  
times, mythological references to  
such aerial cars are often cited as  
evidence that ancient Indians possessed  
the technology for flying machines,  
an assertion for which there is no  
historical evidence.
