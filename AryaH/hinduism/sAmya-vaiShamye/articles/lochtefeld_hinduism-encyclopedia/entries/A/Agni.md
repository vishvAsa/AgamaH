(“**fire**,” cognate with Latin *ignis*) Hindu  
**deity** present in every fire. Agni is also  
one of the eight dikpalas, or **Guardians**  
**of the Directions**, with responsibility for  
the southeast quarter. As fire, Agni is  
also one of the five **elements** in classical  
Hindu **cosmology**.  
Agni is important in the **samhitas**  
(hymns) of the **Rg Veda** and in the  
**Brahmanas**, a later strand of Vedic liter-

ature emphasizing sacrificial rites. The  
Rg Veda opens with a hymn to Agni and  
describes him as “the household priest,  
the god and officiant of the **sacrifice**,  
[and]. . .the giver of blessings.” Agni  
remained important in the Brahmanas  
since, as the sacrificial fire, he was  
essential to all ritual. Agni’s importance  
in these texts stems from his presence in  
all three levels of the Vedic universe—on  
the **earth** as fire, in the middle atmospheric realm (**antariksha**) as lightning,  
and in the sky as the **sun**. This ability to  
move between these levels made Agni  
the intermediary between the gods and  
human beings. From above, Agni served  
as the messenger of the gods, while as  
the sacrificial fire on earth, Agni not only  
consumed the **offerings** but conveyed  
them in the smoke to the gods above.  
Because of his role in bringing about the  
sacrifice, another epithet for Agni is the  
“mouth of the gods.”  
Unlike many of the other Vedic  
deities, Agni has retained a certain  
prominence even in the present day.  
Although Vedic sacrifices are uncommon, sacrificial motifs have been incorporated into many contemporary rites.  
Ceremonies often have a part in which  
offerings (often of clarified butter) are  
ladled into a sacrificial fire. Fire plays an  
important role in many rituals, particularly that of **arati**, in which lamps are  
waved before the image of a divinity as  
an offering of light. Agni also serves as  
the divine witness to the single action  
widely believed to seal a marriage. This  
is **agnipradakshinam**, in which the  
bride and groom make seven revolutions around a lamp or fire. Even on the  
most prosaic level, fire is still essential to  
daily life since most Indians continue to  
cook over an open flame—whether coal,  
wood, dung, or bottled gas. This everyday utility, combined with his abiding  
ritual presence, have assured Agni a  
continuing presence in Hindu life.
