In Hindu mythology, the grandson of King  
**Sagar**. After the death of his sixty thousand uncles, who because of their disrespect were killed by the sage **Kapila**,  
Anshuman was the sole surviving member of the royal line. Anshuman and **Dilip**,  
his **son**, labored mightily to bring the  
**Ganges** (the earthly embodiment of the  
**goddess Ganga**) from **heaven** down to  
**earth**, so that by her touch the souls of  
their relatives might find peace. Their  
efforts were unsuccessful, but Dilipâ€™s son  
**Bhagirath** was finally able to bring the  
Ganges to earth.
