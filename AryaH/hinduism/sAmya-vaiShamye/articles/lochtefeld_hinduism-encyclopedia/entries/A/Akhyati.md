(“nondiscrimination”) **Theory of error**  
propounded by **Prabhakara**, a member of  
the **Purva Mimamsa** philosophical  
school, who lived in the seventh or eighth  
century C.E. All the theories of error aim to  
explain why people make errors in judgment, such as the stock example of mistaking the silvery flash of a seashell for a  
piece of silver. Prabhakara explains this  
error as rooted in the inability to make  
sharp distinctions. The person uncritically  
connects two simple judgments, “that  
object is silvery” and “silver is silvery.” By  
themselves, both of these statements are  
true; what is false is their combination into  
the complex judgment, “that object is silver.” According to Prabhakara, the problem lies not with the simple impressions  
given by perception (**pratyaksha**) or  
memory—both of which are true—but  
with their uncritical connection, in which  
the mind fails to recognize that other  
judgments are possible. For further information see Bijayananda Kar, *The Theories*  
*of Error in Indian Philosophy*, 1978; and
