title = "Asceticism"

+++
In the most general sense, this word  
denotes physical discipline, most often  
the renunciation of regular society and  
conventional social life in a quest to  
seek religious insight and to gain final  
liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
Historically, **ascetic** practice has  
stressed several constant themes. One of  
the most common has been **celibacy**,  
for a variety of reasons. Not only does  
sexual enjoyment use the senses to trap  
a person, but the attachments caused by  
home and family are seen as a distraction to serious spiritual life. Yet the  
emphasis on celibacy is also motivated  
by the belief that **semen** is a man’s concentrated essence, and thus it is something to be carefully hoarded. Although  
semen must be expended for procreation, it should not be spilled casually  
since this drains away a man’s vitality. It  
is believed that energy gained from  
celibacy leads to greater spiritual  
accomplishment.  
Another hallmark has been the practice of **tapas**, or physical asceticism,  
under the assumption that enduring  
physical hardship not only builds character but also generates spiritual power.  
At times tapas can assume grotesque  
forms of self-mutilation and mortification. At other times it may be a milder  
physical discipline, such as a form of  
**hatha yoga**, to train the body and mind  
for extended practice.  
In general, ascetic spiritual development can proceed along a variety of different paths, which often reflect the  
abilities and inclinations of the ascetics  
following them. Some paths have  
stressed the importance of traditional  
learning, some have stressed **worship**  
and devotion, some have stressed physical asceticism, and some have stressed  
meditation and individual realization.  
In almost all cases, this spiritual training  
takes place under the direction of a religious preceptor (**guru**), who takes  
responsibility for the spiritual development of his disciples.  
Asceticism in India has a long and  
venerable history, although there is  
considerable disagreement regarding  
how long and how venerable. The most  
ambitious claim is that the Indian  
ascetic tradition comes from the  
religion of the **Indus Valley civilization**.  
This claim is based on one of the **Indus**  
**Valley seals**, an ancient artifact that  
shows a figure sitting cross-legged as if  
in meditation.  
Whether or not one accepts this  
claim, there is ample evidence of  
asceticism in the **Vedas**, the earliest  
Hindu scriptures. The Vedas mention  
renunciant figures, such as the **vratya**,  
**yati**, and **muni**, and also refer to  
ascetics living in the forest. Indeed,  
the very name of one stratum of the  
Veda, the **Aranyakas** or “Forest  
Books,” suggests that it was composed  
by such ascetics. Buddhist and Jain literature clearly shows that ascetic life  
was well established by the fifth century B.C.E., as do some of the later upanishads. All of these ascetics, whether  
Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain, were designated under the umbrella term **shramana**, a word whose basic meaning is  
“to strive.” It is generally accepted that  
there was religious tension between  
the two dominant religious paradigms,  
the **Brahmana** ideal connected with  
Vedic religion and the shramana ideal  
associated with asceticism. The  
Brahmana ideal was based on **sacrifice**, mastery of complex sacred texts,  
and hereditary priesthood; furthermore, it was so expensive that it virtually required royal patrons—all of  
these factors rendering it the “establishment religion.” These concepts  
clashed with the shramana ideal,  
60  
Asceticism  
which was renunciant, individualist,  
and stressed inner experience.  
By the time of the **Dharma**  
**Shastras** (treatises on religious duty),  
this tension had been somewhat  
resolved; asceticism had been relegated to the last of the four ashramas  
(**stages of life**), that of the **Sanyasi**. Yet  
even here the tension remains, since  
according to these texts, a **twice-born**  
man cannot become a Sanyasi until he  
has seen his children’s children, which  
would make him well advanced in  
years. These texts restrict asceticism to  
twice-born men who have fulfilled  
their obligations as householders, but  
they deny it to **women** and low-**caste**  
men. Needless to say, the actual picture has never been quite as neat as  
the idealized society found in the  
Dharma Shastras.  
Organizationally, initiated Hindu  
ascetics can be divided into several  
major groups. One division is based on  
the ascetics’ patron deity; the **Shaiva**  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**, and the  
**Vaishnava** worship **Vishnu**.  
The **Kapalikas**, **Kalamukhas**, and  
**Pashupatas** are Shaiva ascetic groups  
that have disappeared; the two Shaiva  
groups that still survive are the  
**Dashanamis** and the **Nathpanthis**. The  
Dashanamis are the most prestigious of  
all ascetics. They were supposedly organized by the great philosopher  
**Shankaracharya** and have traditionally  
emphasized learning. The Nathpanthis  
trace their origin to **Gorakhnath**, a miracle-working **yogi** about whom little  
is definitely known. The Nathpanthis  
are known for their stress on the  
transformation of the physical body  
through **yoga**.  
Vaishnava ascetics are more recently  
organized, and in northern India they  
are broken into four groups (**chatuhsampradayi Nagas**), named after each  
group’s reported founder: **Ramananda**  
for the **Ramanandis**, **Nimbarka** for the  
**Nimbarkis**, **Chaitanya** for the Madhva  
Gaudiyas (**Brahma Sampraday**), and  
**Vishnuswami** for the Vishnuswamis.  
From at least the sixteenth century,  
and perhaps much earlier, both the  
Dashanamis and the Vaishnava ascetics  
organized bands of fighters known as  
**Nagas** (“naked”). These soldier-ascetics  
were commissioned to protect the other  
ascetics, but they also served as longdistance traders and mercenary  
soldiers. These Naga orders still exist  
today, although they are no longer  
prepared for battle. Another important  
sect is the **Udasis**, who worship the  
panchayatana (“five-fold”), a collection  
of five Hindu **deities**: Shiva, Vishnu,  
**Durga**, **Ganesh**, and **Surya**. Religiously  
speaking, the Udasis thus fall between  
the Shaivas and Vaishnavas.  
In the past few centuries, reformminded ascetics have organized their  
own ascetic bands, a process that still  
continues today. For further information see G. S. Ghurye, *Indian Sadhus*,
