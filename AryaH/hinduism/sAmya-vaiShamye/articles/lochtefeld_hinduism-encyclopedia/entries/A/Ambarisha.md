title = "Ambarisha"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a king of the  
**Ikshvaku** dynasty about whom various  
sources paint very differing pictures. In  
the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
32  
Amaruka  
great Hindu epics, he is portrayed as a  
man who is willing to **sacrifice** a boy,  
Sunassepha, in place of a sacrificial **cow**  
that **Indra** has stolen. At the moment of  
the sacrifice, Sunassepha prays to the  
gods, and Indra appears to bless both  
Ambarisha and Sunassepha. In another  
story, from the **Bhagavata Purana**,  
Ambarisha is portrayed as a fervent  
devotee (**bhakta**) of **Vishnu**. When the  
sage **Durvasas** tries to disrupt  
Ambarisha’s **ekadashi** (“eleventh **day**”)  
observances, Ambarisha calls for help  
from Vishnu’s discus weapon,  
**Sudarshana**. At Ambarisha’s prayer, the  
discus pursues Durvasas throughout the  
universe and gives him no place of  
refuge. In the end, a humbled Durvasas  
is forced to beg Ambarisha’s forgiveness,  
and the latter informs Durvasas of the  
powers of ekadashi observance.
