title = "Alamkara"

+++
(“ornamentation”) A term for figures of  
speech in **Sanskrit** poetry, of which there  
are more than one hundred types. Many  
of these are the same as those used in  
English poetics, such as metaphor, simile,  
contrast, hyperbole, alliteration, and  
puns. The Sanskrit literati distinguished  
these figures of speech even further into  
more specific types, such as a simile  
expressing wonder, a simile expressed by  
doubt, and poetic error, which is the  
inverse of a metaphor (“that’s not the  
**moon**, but her face . . .”). Other forms are  
unique to Indian poetry, such as respective enumeration, an extended comparison in which one line mentions several  
referents and the following lines  
describe their attributes, always in the  
same order as the first line. Another  
form unique to Indian poetry is denial in  
which the speaker’s real intent is  
expressed by denial, but is accompanied  
by enough suggestion to indicate the  
true meaning. The use of alamkara  
marked all kinds of Sanskrit poetry, both  
religious and nonreligious, and many of  
these forms were brought into the later  
devotional poetry in the vernacular  
Indian languages. For further information on Sanskrit poetics, see Daniel H. H.  
Ingalls, *Sanskrit Poetry*, 1968.
