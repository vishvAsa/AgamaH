(purushartha) Four general goals that  
Hindu society has accepted as legitimate  
ends for all human beings: **artha** (wealth  
and power), **kama** (desire, especially sexual desire), **dharma** (righteousness or  
religious duty), and **moksha** (final liberation of the soul from the cycle of reincarnation). Hindus have affirmed that all of  
these are worthy ends, but have generally  
accepted that the last goal is qualitatively  
different from the other three, which are  
more strongly interrelated. There is nothing wrong with seeking money or pleasure, and Hindu culture affirms both of  
these aims with the understanding that  
their pursuit and enjoyment should  
ultimately be regulated by a commitment  
to dharma. Although there are paths to  
moksha that allow one to remain in the  
world, it is generally accepted that a person pursuing moksha will be less attentive to worldly desires because they are  
incompatible with this ultimate goal.
