title = "(“food-eating”) Samskara"

+++
Traditionally, this is the seventh of the  
life-cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**) in  
which the young child is first given  
solid food. In many of the traditional  
texts on **dharma**, the **Dharma Shastras**,  
parents are directed to feed the child  
**animal** flesh. In modern times children  
are more commonly fed rice; as the  
most popular grain in much of  
India, rice can be considered a symbol  
for food in general.

Annaprashana (“food-eating”) Samskara  
A woman displays the anjali hasta hand gesture.  
This gesture conveys respect and is a common greeting and salutation.  
As in any society, the introduction of  
solid food marks a major transition in  
the infant’s young life, even though the  
infant may not wean for some time after  
that. Unlike many of the traditional  
samskaras, this is still an important  
**childhood rite** in modern India.
