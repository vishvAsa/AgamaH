(“I am **Brahman**.”) In the Hindu philosophical tradition, this is one of the four  
“great utterances” (**mahavakyas**)  
expressing an ultimate truth. The  
truth expressed in this utterance is the  
idea that **atman** (the individual Self )  
and Brahman (Ultimate Reality) are  
one and the same—identical; this  
truth is at the heart of the speculative  
texts called the **Upanishads**. The four  
mahavakyas, aside from their philosophical importance as capsulizing  
fundamental truths, were also appropriated by the four divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics** as identifying symbols. Each division had a  
different mahavakya, just as each had  
a different **Veda**, a different primary  
sacred center, and a different  
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Aham  
Brahmasmi is the mahavakya associated with the **Bhuriwara** division of the  
Dashanami Sanyasis.
