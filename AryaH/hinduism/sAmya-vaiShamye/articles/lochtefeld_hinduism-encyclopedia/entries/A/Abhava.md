title = "Abhava"

+++
(“[knowledge from] absence”) Abhava is  
one of the two means of valid knowledge  
(**pramana**) unique to the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** school of **philosophy**, the  
other being presumption (**arthapatti**). All  
Indian philosophical schools concern  
themselves with codifying pramanas,  
that is, the means by which human  
beings can gain true and accurate knowledge. Behind this concern lies the basic  
Hindu religious goal of learning to live,  
act, and think in a way that leads to the  
final liberation of the soul from the cycle  
of reincarnation (**samsara**). Almost all  
schools accept perception (**pratyaksha**),  
inference (**anumana**), and authoritative  
testimony (**shabda**) as pramanas. The  
Purva Mimamsa school claims that  
abhava, or perception of the absence of  
something (“there is no jug in this room”),  
is a means of knowledge that cannot be  
accounted for by the other pramanas.
