title = "Auspiciousness"

+++
This is the general term for events or  
conditions that cause or promote life,  
prosperity, and overall well-being.  
Along with **purity** and impurity  
(**ashaucha**), auspiciousness and  
**inauspiciousness** are fundamental  
concepts in Hindu life.  
The life-giving qualities connected  
with auspiciousness make it a state  
that Hindus pursueâ€”whether through  
performing rituals, scheduling important events such as **marriage ceremonies** for astrologically favorable  
times, or avoiding people and things  
deemed to be inauspicious. For extensive information of auspiciousness  
and its importance in Hindu life, see
