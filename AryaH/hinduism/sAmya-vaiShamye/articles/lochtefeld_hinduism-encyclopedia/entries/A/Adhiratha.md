title = "Adhiratha"

+++
The foster father of **Karna** in the great  
Hindu epic, the **Mahabharata**. Karna is  
born when his mother, **Kunti**, uses a  
special **mantra** given to her by the sage  
**Durvasas**, which gives a **woman** the  
power to conceive and bear children by  
the gods. Kunti impulsively uses the  
mantra to invoke the **Sun**, by whom she  
conceives and bears Karna. In her panic  
at unexpectedly becoming a mother—  
she is still unmarried, and concerned  
about what people might think—she  
puts the child in a box and abandons him  
in the **Ganges**. When Adhiratha goes to  
the Ganges to bathe (**snana**), he finds the  
child, and since he and his wife are childless, they raise the boy as their own.  
There are a number of interesting  
aspects to the story of Adhiratha.  
Although he is not of high status, he  
becomes the king of the country. He  
comes from a social group whose traditional occupation is driving chariots.

Adharma  
One can read this dissonance in the  
epic’s recognition that the hierarchical,  
occupationally based social model is an  
idealized projection and not always the  
reality. It can also be argued that since  
Adhiratha is not fulfilling his particular  
religious duty (**dharma**) but has  
usurped that of the ruling class, both he  
and the country are destined for ruin.  
The reality of his family’s lowly status  
and the uncertainty about his **birth**  
trouble Karna for most of his life.
