title = "Achamana"

+++
(“sipping”) The act of sipping **water** that  
has been poured or scooped into one’s  
right hand. This is performed as a rite of  
purification. Achamana is a symbolic  
action that has been incorporated into  
many religious rituals. It is also part of  
the required early morning ablutions,  
the purpose of which is to remove any  
impurity (**ashaucha**) encountered while  
sleeping. In the Hindu tradition, human  
beings are considered impure upon  
waking for a number of reasons. Since  
sleep entails loss of consciousness, one  
may not know whether one has come  
into contact with impurity. Further, bodily functions that may occur while sleeping cause impurity. In addition, it is  
popularly believed that one’s soul  
(**atman**) leaves the body during sleep  
and then reenters it before the body  
awakens. While the soul is gone, the  
body is believed to be a **corpse**, which is  
an impurity that must be cleansed.
