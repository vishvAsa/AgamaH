(“knowledge of life”) Ayurveda is  
the best known of the indigenous  
Indian medical systems and is  
primarily based on the two **Sanskrit**  
medical texts: the **Charaka Samhita**  
(1st c. C.E.) and the **Sushruta Samhita**  
(4th c. C.E.).  
The underlying assumption in both  
of these texts and in ayurveda is the  
theory of the three bodily humors—  
**vata** (**wind**), **pitta** (bile), and **kapha**  
(phlegm). Each of these is composed  
of different elements, and although  
everyone has all three humors, their  
relative proportions are used to  
explain varying body types, metabolic  
dispositions, and personalities.  
People in whom vata predominates  
are said to have quick minds, slender  
bodies, and to be full of energy, but  
they are also said to get run down  
more easily than others. Pitta-dominant people are said to be strongwilled and good leaders but also  
hot-tempered and bothered by heat.  
Kapha-dominant people are strong,  
healthy, and stable but also have tendencies toward lassitude and inertia.  
Each of these humors can thus  
have both wholesome and unwholesome manifestations, but when the  
humors are in relative balance, the five  
bodily winds (**prana**) that are considered responsible for basic bodily functions will work effectively, and the  
person will be healthy.  
According to ayurveda, disease is  
caused by an imbalance of these  
humors that usually has perceivable  
environmental roots. One possible  
cause is environmental circumstances, such as the stresses that the  
differing **seasons** (hot, cold, damp,  
etc.) put on varying constitutions.  
The other possible cause for an  
imbalance is the person’s own  
behavior—improper diet, poor sleep  
habits, deficient or inappropriate  
bodily exertion, and other habitual  
stresses on the body.  
In ayurveda, people are conceived  
as beings in interaction with their  
environment, and ayurveda’s proponents recognize that many ailments  
may have multiple causes. The ultimate aim of any treatment, whether  
diet, exercise, or medicine, is to restore  
this lost equilibrium. The equilibrium  
being sought will be different for  
everyone, since it will necessarily  
reflect each person’s individual makeup. For further information see Gopi
