title = "Agnihotra"

+++
(“**fire sacrifice**”) Religious rite in  
which **offerings** are made to the  
sacred fire, considered to be the god  
**Agni** in material form. The term can  
also refer to the maintenance and care  
of the sacred fire itself. The roots of  
**worship** based on a sacrificial fire go  
back to the **Vedas**, the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu sacred texts. This  
type of worship is still present in modern times, although much diminished  
in emphasis.
