title = "Apurva"

+++
According to the **Purva Mimamsa**  
philosophical school, apurva is an  
unseen force created by actionâ€”particularly ritual action. This unseen  
force exists from the beginning of the  
action to the result of that action, and  
it invariably brings the intended result  
into being. This doctrine was developed to connect actions with their  
results, particularly when the result  
came some time after the initial action,  
and is especially relevant to **karma**.  
The Mimamsas developed the concept  
of the apurva because they wanted to support information found in the **Vedas**,  
which in many cases specifies that certain  
actions will eventually produce specific  
results. For further information see
