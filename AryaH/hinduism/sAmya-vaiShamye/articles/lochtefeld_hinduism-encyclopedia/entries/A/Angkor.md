Temple complex built in northwestern  
Cambodia by the Khmer ruler  
**Suryavarman II** (1112â€“1153 C.E.). The  
Khmer people were indigenous to  
Kampuchea, but the temples at Angkor  
were dedicated to Hindu gods. This  
reflects the prodigious influence of  
Hindu culture, which by the end of the  
first millennium C.E. had been spread  
throughout Southeast Asia by Indian  
(primarily southern Indian) merchants  
and traders.
