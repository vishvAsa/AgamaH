title = "Ashoka"

+++
(r. 269–232 B.C.E.) The greatest ruler in  
the **Maurya dynasty**, who reigned over a  
kingdom stretching from Afghanistan to  
southern India from his capital at  
**Pataliputra**. Ashoka’s father, **Bindusara**,  
and his grandfather, **Chandragupta**  
**Maurya**, had created a centralized  
empire. Aside from the far south, the  
only area outside its influence was the  
region known as Kalinga (modern state  
of **Orissa**).  
Early in his reign, Ashoka’s armies  
conquered Kalinga in a bloody campaign, killing hundreds of thousands of  
people; the carnage had a profound  
effect on the young Ashoka. Several  
years later Ashoka formally adopted  
Buddhism and embraced the principle  
of nonviolence (**ahimsa**). As a result he  
formally renounced war as a means  
of conquest.  
Early historians believed that  
Ashoka used his royal power to make  
Buddhism the state religion, but this  
position appears to misread the evidence. Ashoka did seem to be attracted  
to Buddhism, but his public pronouncements on “Dhamma,” earlier  
identified with Buddhist teaching, seem  
to have been aimed at creating a climate of social responsibility, tolerance,  
nonviolence, and harmony. These were  
qualities that most reasonable people  
would endorse, and some historians  
have suggested that such vague guidelines indicate an attempt to unify a religiously diverse empire.  
Ashoka is by far the best-known figure  
of his era, largely because he set up public  
**inscriptions** all over his kingdom. **Rock**  
**edicts** tended to be carved on rock faces  
close to the empire’s borders, while **pillar**  
**edicts** were inscribed on pillars erected  
on the main roads.  
The writing used for these inscriptions varied in different regions of the  
empire, although the language for all  
was a **Prakrit**, one of the grammatically  
simple vernacular languages that developed from **Sanskrit**. These inscriptions  
are the earliest written Indian documents of any historical significance;  
they reveal a great deal about Ashoka’s  
public persona, his exhortations to his  
subjects, and even something about the  
man himself.  
In modern India, Ashoka is the model  
for the enlightened ruler, and the  
Ashokan pillar capped with four **lions** has  
been adopted as the emblem of the modern republic of India.
