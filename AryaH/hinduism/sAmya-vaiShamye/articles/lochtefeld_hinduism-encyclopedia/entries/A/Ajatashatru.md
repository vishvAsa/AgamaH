title = "Ajatashatru"

+++
(2) In the **Brhadaranyaka Upanishad**, a  
great sage who was also the king of  
**Benares**. Ajatashatru is notable for  
instructing Gargya, a **brahmin** priest, on  
the nature of **Brahman**, even though this  
was inappropriate by contemporary  
standards since Ajatashatru was a **kshatriya** warrior king and thus should have  
been receiving instruction from Gargya.  
The **Upanishads** have several episodes in  
which, contrary to the norm, kshatriyas  
instruct brahmins. Such episodes reveal  
the nature of wisdom as conceived in the  
Upanishadsâ€”it is achieved by individual  
striving and realization and not conferred by **birth** or social position.
