title = "Act of Truth"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a ritual action that  
is described as being able to neutralize  
poison, bring rain, make a river flow  
backward, or even compel the gods to  
grant one’s wishes. The act of truth  
draws its effectiveness from the **power**  
**of truth** and is usually performed as a  
last resort when all other avenues have  
been blocked. The act of truth is a conditional statement: the first part is a true  
statement about one’s past behavior, the  
second part a request for some specific  
result (“If I have always given to those  
who begged from me, may this **fire** not  
5  
Act of Truth  
burn me”). The rite’s success stems from  
the truthfulness of the first condition—  
that the power of truth in the condition  
actually causes the second part to come  
true. One example of the act of truth  
being used to compel the gods to grant a  
wish occurs in the story of the lovers  
**Nala** and **Damayanti**. Damayanti  
intends to choose Nala as her husband  
but finds that four of the gods have  
taken Nala’s form, in an effort to foil her.  
Damayanti’s act of truth affirms that she  
had chosen Nala as her husband and  
has never wavered in this choice, and it  
then directs the gods to take their true  
forms again. The gods take their true  
forms, and Nala and Damayanti are  
married.  
As Sanskritist and Indologist W.  
Norman Brown observes, in cases  
where the act of truth is successful, the  
people making the act of truth have  
perfectly fulfilled their social roles,  
and this perfection allows them to  
make the conditional affirmation so  
central to the act of truth. Successful  
men have been either great kings,  
**ascetics**, or householders; successful  
**women** have usually been absolutely  
faithful to their husbands (fulfilling  
one idealized women’s role). One story  
tells of a prostitute who affirmed that she  
had serviced all of her clients without partiality, thus perfectly fulfilling her particular social role. In any of these cases,  
perfection of one’s role is believed to bring  
spiritual merit as well as the ability to  
unleash it by performing the act of truth.
