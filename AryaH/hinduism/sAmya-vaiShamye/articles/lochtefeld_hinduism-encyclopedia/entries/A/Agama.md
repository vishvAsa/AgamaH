title = "Agama"

+++
In its most general meaning, this refers  
to any authoritative text. In a philosophical context, this word designates  
one of the **pramanas**, the means by  
which human beings can gain true and  
accurate knowledge. As a pramana, the  
agama denotes testimony from a reliable source, particularly from scriptures such as the **Veda**. Within specific  
sectarian communities, such as the  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the gods **Shiva**  
(**Shaivas**) and **Vishnu** (**Vaishnavas**), the  
word also commonly designates the  
particular texts deemed most authoritative by that community.
