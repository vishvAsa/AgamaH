title = "Apabhramsha"

+++
(“fallen away”) An important northern  
Indian **Prakrit**, one of the vernacular  
languages that developed naturally  
from **Sanskrit**. Apabhramsha was the  
latest addition to the Middle Indo**Aryan** languages and is considered a  
direct precursor of early modern **Hindi**,  
which was becoming established as  
early as the twelfth century. Although  
Apabhramsha has lesser status than  
**Sanskrit**, it was nevertheless an important regional literary language.
