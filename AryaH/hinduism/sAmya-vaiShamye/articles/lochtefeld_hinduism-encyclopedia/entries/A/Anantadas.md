title = "Anantadas"

+++
(late 16th c.) Poet and hagiographer  
who wrote “introductions” (parchais)  
for some of the best-known northern  
Indian devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saints,  
among them **Ravidas**, **Kabir**, **Namdev**,  
**Trilochan**, **Angada**, and **Pipa**. His era  
can be fixed with reasonable assurance  
since Anantadas himself gives 1588 C.E.  
as the date of composition for his  
*Namdev Parchai*. Anantadas was contemporary with another famous  
hagiographer, **Nabhadas**, whom  
Anantadas names as a “**guru** brother”  
to his own guru, making Nabhadas a  
“spiritual uncle” of Anantadas.  
Although both hagiographers provide  
valuable information, the descriptions  
36  
Anandamayi Ma  
by Nabhadas are quite brief, whereas  
Anantadas gives extended information  
about his subjects. Anantadas’s works  
are by far the earliest detailed accounts  
of these literary figures, although the  
marvelous events included in the  
introductions render them suspect as  
historical sources. Because his collected works have never been published,  
he remains virtually unknown. For further information see David Lorenzen,
