Fifth month of the Tamil solar **year**,  
which usually falls within August and  
September. This month corresponds to  
the northern Indian solar month of  
Simha (the zodiacal sign of Leo). The  
existence of several different **calendars**  
is one clear sign of the continuing  
importance of regional cultural patterns. One way that the Tamils retain  
their culture is by preserving their traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the few  
regional languages in India with an  
ancient, well-established literary tradition. See also **Tamil months**, **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, and **Tamil language**.
