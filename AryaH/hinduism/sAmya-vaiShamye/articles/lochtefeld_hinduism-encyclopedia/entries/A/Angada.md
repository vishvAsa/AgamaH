title = "Angada"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Hindu epics, Angada is the **son** of  
the monkey-king **Bali** and his wife Tara.  
Even though **Rama**, the seventh incarnation of **Vishnu**, has killed his father  
under questionable circumstances,  
Angada is one of Rama’s loyal allies.  
Angada takes part in the search for **Sita**,  
and then in the battle in **Lanka** to free  
39  
Angada  
her, in which his major contribution is  
combat with **Ravana’s** son Meghanada  
(an epithet of **Indrajit**).  
After the conquest of Lanka, Rama  
appoints Angada as the crown prince  
of **Kishkindha**, a forest in southern  
India. Many of the characters in the  
*Ramayana* are paradigms for Indian  
cultural values. Angada exhibits  
bravery, loyalty, and sincere devotion  
to Rama, all of which bring their  
eventual rewards.
