title = "Anjali Hasta"

+++
In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual,  
the anjali hasta is a particular hand  
**gesture** (**hasta**) in which the palms of the  
two hands are joined together with the  
fingers pointing upward, often with the  
base of the thumbs resting against the  
chest. This gesture conveys respect and  
prayerful devotion.  
In modern India this is also the  
most common gesture of greeting and  
salutation. Since traditional Indian society  
was (and to some extent, remains) so  
intensely conscious of **purity**, it is not  
surprising that this greeting can convey  
respect without requiring one to touch  
another person, which could transmit  
impurity (**ashaucha**) from one person  
to another.
