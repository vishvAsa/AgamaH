title = "Anandawara"

+++
One of the four major groups of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
**ascetics** who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**; the other three divisions  
are **Kitawara**, **Bhuriwara**, and  
**Bhogawara**. Each of these groups has its  
headquarters in one of the four monastic  
centers (**maths**) supposedly established  
by the philosopher **Shankaracharya**.  
Each group also has particular religious  
associations: with one of the four **Vedas**,  
with a particular quarter of the Indian  
subcontinent, with one of the “great  
utterances” (**mahavakyas**) expressing  
ultimate truth, with a specific **ascetic**  
quality, and with several of the ten  
Dashanami divisions.  
The Anandawara group is affiliated  
with the **Jyotir Math** in the Himalayan  
town of **Joshimath** and is thus connected  
with the northern quarter of India. Their  
**Veda** is the **Atharva Veda**, their  
mahavakya is **Ayamatma Brahman**  
(“This Self is **Brahman**”), and their  
ascetic quality is to be satisfied with  
whatever food they get without **begging**,  
since they are not attached to worldly  
pleasures. The particular Dashanami  
divisions associated with this group are  
**Giri**, **Parvata**, and **Sagara**.
