title = "Ancestral Spirit"

+++
(pitr) This term is a translation of the  
word that literally means “fathers”;  
these ancestral spirits are seen as a collective group to whom every man has  
duties. One of these duties is to perform  
certain memorial rites for them, such as  
the rite of **sapindikarana**. Like most  
funerary rites (**antyeshthi samskara**),  
the major objective is to transform the  
recently deceased and potentially  
malevolent spirit into a benign and  
helpful ancestor. Another duty is to procreate **sons**, so that the rites may be  
performed without interruption. Both  
of these are weighty responsibilities,  
and Hindu mythology is replete with  
tales of lifelong **ascetics**, such as  
**Jaratkaru**, who are rebuked by their  
ancestral spirits for shirking their duty  
to procreate. By virtue of their stable  
ancestral status, these spirits are also  
well-defined and generally benevolent.
