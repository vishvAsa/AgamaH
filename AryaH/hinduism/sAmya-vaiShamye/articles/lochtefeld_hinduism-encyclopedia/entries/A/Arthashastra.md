(“Treatise on Power”) Text on power and  
politics attributed to **Kautilya**, the  
Machiavellian prime minister said to  
have orchestrated the rise to power of  
**Chandragupta Maurya** (r. 321–297  
B.C.E.), the founder of the **Maurya**  
**dynasty**. The *Arthashastra* was intended  
as a guidebook for the king, to help him  
control both the people in his kingdom  
and the surrounding states.  
The *Arthashastra*’s fundamental  
assumption was that the king wanted to  
remain in power and should do whatever it took to retain it.  
Within the kingdom, Kautilya advocated a strict and authoritarian government aided by an extensive network of  
spies to gather intelligence and assess  
the popular mood. These spies included  
men posing as wandering **ascetics**, who  
could move about without suspicion.  
The book also advised the king to assign  
special spies to his closest advisers  
to monitor their ambition, and to  
have these spies report only to the  
king himself.  
In regard to neighboring countries,  
the *Arthashastra* assumed that each  
king wanted to increase his kingdom at  
55  
Arthashastra  
the expense of his neighbors. Weaker  
neighbors were to be conquered and  
assimilated, whereas stronger ones  
were to be pacified or stalled with the  
eventual hope that these stronger  
states could be countered by making  
other alliances.  
Although the *Arthashastra* was  
never the “Bible” of any ruling Indian  
dynasty, it detailed political **philosophy**  
and practices that existed in ancient  
and medieval India and can even  
be discerned in contemporary  
parliamentary politics.
