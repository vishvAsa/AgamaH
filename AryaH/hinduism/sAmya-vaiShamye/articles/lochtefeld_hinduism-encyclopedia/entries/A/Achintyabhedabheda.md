(“inconceivable identity and difference”) Key philosophical concept of the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** school, which was  
founded by the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**  
(d. 1533) and is devoted to the **worship**  
of **Krishna** as the Supreme Being. The  
concept was first enunciated by  
Chaitanya’s disciple **Jiva Goswami** (late  
16th c.) and explains the relationship  
between God (Krishna) and the human  
soul, and between God and his **divine**  
**powers**. In both cases these relationships are described as simultaneously  
involving sameness and difference. On  
one hand, human souls are clearly different from God, as shown by their  
imperfections and their susceptibility  
to the action of **karma**, both of which  
contrast with God’s utter transcendence and perfection. Yet since it is  
possible for human souls to gain ultimate liberation (**moksha**) from the  
action of karma, they must also share  
some part of God’s nature, since liberation would be impossible if human  
souls were completely different. Even  
though human souls partake in the  
divine nature, their distinctness is  
upheld even after liberation, when the  
human soul does not merge with  
Krishna but remains separate.  
This same concept is used to  
describe the second relationship,  
between God and his divine powers.  
The divine powers are often conceived  
not just as attributes (e.g., the ability  
to create, preserve, and destroy the  
universe) but as actual embodied  
**deities**, particularly in the form of  
goddesses. These powers are both the  
same as God, since they come from  
Him, but also different since each of  
the embodied powers does not contain the glory of the whole. In both  
cases the precise nature of this simultaneous identity and difference is  
“inconceivable,” which here carries a  
mystical sense. For further information see Sushil Kumar De, *Early History*
