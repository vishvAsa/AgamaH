(“impurity”) Name for the ritual impurity  
caused by contact with any source of pollution; these sources come in many different guises, both physical and social.  
**Purity** and impurity are religious  
categories and thus fundamentally different from cleanliness and dirtiness,  
which are hygienic categories. For  
example, **cow dung** is considered a  
pure substance in traditional Hindu  
society and is smeared on patches of  
ground to purify it. It is also important  
to realize that impurity is a natural part  
of life—as just one example, everyone  
goes to the bathroom every day—and  
that becoming impure carries no sense  
of moral imperfection or lapse.  
Most bodily fluids are considered polluting; one becomes impure through any  
activity involving them, such as urination,  
defecation, sexual activity, giving **birth**, or  
being born. One can become polluted  
through contact with people or things  
deemed impure, such as people of lower  
social status, **animals**, any sort of ordinary  
filth, or even the dust from the road.  
Impurity can also be caused by social connections. The impurity from childbirth  
(**sutakashaucha**) obviously affects the  
mother and child because of the bodily  
fluids involved, but it also affects all other  
members of the immediate family.  
If a person has come into contact  
with something polluting, the solution  
is to remove the source of impurity. The  
most common means of purification is  
to bathe in running **water**, which  
removes less virulent impurities by carrying them away with the water’s flow.  
The purifying power of bathing (**snana**)  
makes it a prelude to many religious  
rituals, in which one of the general preconditions is scrupulous purity, both  
for the person performing the ritual  
and the place where it is performed.  
The most polluting substance of all  
is a **corpse**, which is one reason why  
bodies are destroyed by **cremation** on  
the day of death. The impurity from  
death (**maranashaucha**) is the most  
violent impurity of all, and contact with  
a corpse affects the entire family for ten  
days after the death.

Ashaucha  
Men wash the body of a deceased man to prepare it for cremation.  
A dead body is considered to be a potent source of ashaucha, or impurity.
