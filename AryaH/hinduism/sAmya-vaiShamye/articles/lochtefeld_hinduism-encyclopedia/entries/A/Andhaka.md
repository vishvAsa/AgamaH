title = "Andhaka"

+++
(“blind”) In Hindu mythology, a  
**demon** born from the darkness that  
arises when the **goddess Parvati** playfully covers her husband **Shiva’s**  
eyes with her hands. Shiva names  
him Andhaka because he arises from  
darkness. Andhaka lusts after Parvati  
and continues to pursue her, despite  
repeated remonstrances that  
approaching another man’s wife is  
improper. Eventually he goes all the  
way to Shiva’s home on Mount **Kailas**,  
where the god kills him.
