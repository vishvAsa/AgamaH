title = "Alvar"

+++
Collective name for twelve poet-saints  
devoted to the god **Vishnu** who lived  
in southern India between the seventh  
and tenth centuries. In conjunction  
with the **Nayanars**, who were devoted  
to the god **Shiva**, the Alvars spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu  
religion vis-à-vis the Buddhists and  
the Jains. Both the Alvars and the  
Nayanars stressed passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god and  
conveyed this devotion through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**.  
The earliest Alvars were a group of  
three seventh-century contemporaries: **Poygai**, **Pey**, and **Bhutam**,  
whose propitious meeting on a rainy  
night is described as sparking the  
devotional flame. The next group:  
**Tiruppan**, **Tirumalisai**, **Tondaradippodi**,  
**Kulashekhara**, **Periyalvar**, **Andal**, and  
**Tirumangai**, are believed to have lived  
in the ninth century. They were followed  
by **Nammalvar** and his disciple  
**Mathurakavi**, who can be reasonably  
placed in the beginning of the tenth  
century, as can **Nathamuni**, who collected all of the Alvars’ hymns in the  
**Nalayira Prabandham**. Although the  
29  
Alvar  
Alvars described themselves only as  
human devotees (**bhakta**), by the tenth  
century they were revered by the  
**Shrivaishnava** religious community as  
**anshavatars**, or incarnations of Vishnu’s  
attributes or companions. Their collected  
hymns were (and are) popularly known as  
the Tamil **Veda** and became a vital part of  
later **Vaishnava** piety in southern India.  
This is particularly true for the  
Shrivaishnava tradition, in which one of  
the major figures was Nathamuni himself.
