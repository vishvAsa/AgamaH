title = "Aniconic Image"

+++
A symbol that is meant to represent a  
**deity**. Although it is more common for  
human or **animal** likenesses to stand for  
deities, some deities are represented by  
symbols or non-pictorial images.  
Examples of this would be the **linga** or  
the **shalagram**, both of which are wellknown symbolic forms of particular  
deitiesâ€”**Shiva** and **Vishnu**, respectively.
