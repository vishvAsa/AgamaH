One of the five bodily “winds” considered to be responsible for basic bodily  
functions, the others being **prana**,  
**vyana**, **udana**, and **samana**. The apana  
wind is believed to exist in the region of  
the anus and is associated with discharging material out of the body: urine,  
feces, gas, **semen**, menstrual discharges,  
and the **birth** of children.
