title = "Akshaya Trtiya"

+++
(also called Akha Teej) Festival  
celebrated on the third **day** of the  
bright (waxing) half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Baisakh** (April–May). The  
festival’s name reflects the belief that  
the religious merit from rites performed on this day is indestructible  
(akshaya). This is thought to be the day  
on which the **Treta Yuga** (a previous  
cosmic age) began, and as a transitional day is believed to be highly  
auspicious. This day is marked by **worship** of **Vishnu** and his consort  
**Lakshmi**; it is also believed to be the  
birthday of Vishnu’s sixth incarnation,  
**Parashuram avatar**. Consistent both  
with the worship of Vishnu and  
the belief that this is a transitional  
day, on Akshaya Trtiya the temple  
doors are opened at the Four  
Himalayan Dhams (the holy towns  
of **Yamunotri**, **Gangotri**, **Kedarnath**,  
and **Badrinath**) after having been  
closed all winter, and worship in  
those places is resumed until after the  
festival of **Diwali** in the fall. See also
