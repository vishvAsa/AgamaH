title = "Advani, Lal Krishna"

+++
(b. 1927) Modern Indian politician as well  
as past president and leader of the  
**Bharatiya Janata Party** (BJP), a party  
often considered the political wing of the  
**Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS).  
Advani joined the RSS as a young man and  
was encouraged by the RSS to become  
active in politics, first in the **Jana Sangh**  
and later in the BJP. In the fall of 1990,  
Advani embarked on a tour of northern  
India to raise public support for building  
a **Rama** temple in **Ayodhya**, on a site  
which at the time was occupied by a  
Muslim mosque. The public response to  
this **rath yatra** (“chariot journey”) was  
positive and brought great political benefits to the BJP; the BJP has since run the  
state governments in some of India’s  
most important states and has become  
the largest opposition party in  
Parliament. During the 1990s the BJP’s  
influence waxed and waned, but for  
much of this time, Advani has been one of  
the leading figures in the party. In the  
spring of 1996, however, he was one of  
many Indian political figures whose name  
was connected with a major bribery scandal. He immediately resigned his seat in  
Parliament and promised that he would  
not seek office until his name had been  
cleared. The allegation was found to be  
completely baseless, and Advani was  
reelected to Parliament in March, 1998.  
During the thirteen months of BJP government rule in 1998–99, Advani served as  
Home Minister (the Cabinet officer  
responsible for all domestic affairs) and  
has continued in this position during the  
BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.
