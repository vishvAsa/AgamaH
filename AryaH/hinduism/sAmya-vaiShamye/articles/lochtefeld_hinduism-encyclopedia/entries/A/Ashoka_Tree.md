title = "Ashoka Tree"

+++
(*Jonesia ashoka*) Flowering tree traditionally associated with love and fertility. When in bloom, the Ashoka tree is  
covered with red flowers—a color typically associated with passion—that contrast with its green foliage. According to  
tradition, the ashoka tree will not bloom  
until it has been kicked by a young  
woman’s foot, implying the transfer of  
her fertile energy to the tree.  
The Ashoka tree is also famous in the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics. When **Sita** is kidnapped by  
**Ravana**, the **demon**-king of **Lanka**, she  
is imprisoned in a grove of Ashoka trees,  
where she pines away waiting to be rescued by her husband **Rama**.
