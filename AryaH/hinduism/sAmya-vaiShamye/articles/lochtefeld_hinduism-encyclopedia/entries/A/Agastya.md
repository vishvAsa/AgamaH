title = "Agastya"

In Hindu mythology, Agastya is one of  
the **rishis** (sages) of ancient India and  
is attributed with various supernormal  
powers. As with many of the rishis,  
Agastya is marked as different even by  
his **birth**, which is far outside the normal manner. According to the story,  
Agastya is conceived when the **semen**  
of the **deities** Mitra and **Varuna** is  
placed in a pot and develops there into

Agastya  
a baby boy. Agastya is described as preferring a detached, **ascetic** lifestyle, but  
he compromises in deference to his  
ancestors. The ancestors appear  
to Agastya in a vision, imploring him  
to marry and have children, so that  
his **sons** can continue performing the  
ancestral **offerings**; this is one of the  
**three debts** that every Hindu man  
must pay. Agastya consents and  
marries **Lopamudra**.  
Agastya’s ascetic lifestyle is said to  
have generated immense powers,  
which he demonstrates by performing  
many marvelous deeds. According to  
some accounts, he curses king  
**Nahusha** to become a giant serpent, in  
retribution for the insults Nahusha has  
heaped upon him. Agastya also curses  
King **Indradyumna** to become an **elephant**, and the **gandharva** named  
**Huhu** to become a crocodile; the two  
are released many years later through  
the god **Vishnu’s** divine **grace**.  
Not all of his exploits stem from his  
readiness to **curse**—a trait found in  
many of the sages—and some are performed for the benefit of human  
beings. He is reported to have humbled  
the **Vindhya Mountains** (here personified), which through envy of Mount  
**Meru** have grown so tall that the **sun**  
and **moon** are unable to get around  
them. Agastya does this by asking  
Vindhya to bow down to let him get  
through on his journey to southern  
India. Agastya promises that Vindhya  
can stand up again when he returns,  
which has yet to happen. In other cases  
Agastya is reported to have used his  
powers to help get rid of **demons**. On  
one occasion, when a group of demons  
is hiding in the sea by day and coming  
out to pillage at night, Agastya exposes  
them by drinking up the ocean and thus  
taking away their place of refuge. On  
another occasion he foils a demon who  
has been taking the form of a goat to be  
cooked and eaten by unsuspecting diners. The demon has been killing the diners by exploding out of their stomachs.  
Agastya eats the demon as usual, but it is  
then completely destroyed by Agastya’s  
prodigious digestive powers. See also
