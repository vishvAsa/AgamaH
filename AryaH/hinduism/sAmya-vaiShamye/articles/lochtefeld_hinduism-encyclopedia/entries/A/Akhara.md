In its most basic meaning, an akhara  
is a “wrestling ground,” a place in the  
village or city where young men come  
to train, tone, and compete. Such  
practices at an akhara are not merely  
physical exercise but also a form of  
religious practice, since wrestlers  
often begin by worshiping **Hanuman**,  
a **deity** associated with strength and  
power. Among the **Naga** class of the

Boys in Shri Shaku Khashbaug competing in the village akhara, or wrestling ground.  
Training in wrestling and participating in competitions are considered religious disciplines.  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, the word  
*akhara* means something closer to  
“regiment.” The Dashanami Nagas  
were **ascetics** devoted to the god  
**Shiva** and who formerly made their  
living as traders and mercenary soldiers. These Nagas were organized  
into different akharas based on the  
model of an army, and here the word  
primarily marks group affiliation,  
although it can also refer to the buildings in which the group lives. The Nagas  
are divided into seven main akharas—the  
**Juna** or Bhairava, **Agni**, **Avahana**,  
**Niranjani**, **Ananda**, **Mahanirvani**, and  
**Atala**. Among the **Bairagi Naga**  
ascetics—militant ascetics who are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**—  
the largest division of forces is into **anis**  
(“armies”), which are then subdivided  
into akharas.
