title = "Abhang"

+++
(“unbroken”) Poetic form characteristically used by the saint-poets of the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba**. Each abhang is usually made up of four lines, with an *abbc*  
rhyme scheme. Although each abhang is  
a complete poem in its own right, they  
are often strung together in groups, to  
create either a longer narrative poem (in  
which each abhang stands as one  
segment) or a group of poems devoted  
to a common theme. Such versatility  
made it one of the dominant poetic  
forms in the Marathi language, just as  
the **doha** form is ubiquitous to medieval  
and modern **Hindi**.
