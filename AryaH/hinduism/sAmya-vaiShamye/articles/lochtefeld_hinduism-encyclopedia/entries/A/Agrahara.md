title = "Agrahara"

+++
A **brahmin** residential enclave, usually  
established by a land grant from a  
wealthy land owner or royalty to a particular brahmin. Brahmins had the  
highest status in traditional Hindu  
society, based on the belief that they  
had higher ritual **purity**. The purpose  
of the agrahara was to protect this ritual purity since it could be compromised fairly easily. Agraharas were  
most common in southern India,  
where brahmins formed an extremely  
small percentage of the general populationâ€”on average, about four percent. As a small **minority**, southern  
Indian brahmins could maintain a  
more controlled environment, thereby  
reducing the possibility of having their  
purity tainted. In northern India,  
brahmins formed a significant part of  
the population and tended to live  
within the towns and cities, although  
they often inhabited particular sections of these places.
