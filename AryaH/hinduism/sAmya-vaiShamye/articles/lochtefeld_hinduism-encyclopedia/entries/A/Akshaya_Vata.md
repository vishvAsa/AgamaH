(“indestructible banyan tree”) In Hindu  
mythology, a particular banyan tree that  
existed before the creation of the universe and will be the only thing to survive the cosmic dissolution (**pralaya**) at  
the end of the cosmic cycle. According to  
one mythic account, the sage  
**Markandeya** saw a vision of pralaya in  
which the only thing remaining was this  
single tree, under which lay the god  
**Krishna** in infant form, sucking on his  
toes. The akshaya **vata** is identified with  
a particular banyan tree in **Allahabad** at  
the junction of the **Ganges** and **Yamuna**  
rivers, where it is now enclosed within  
the fort built by the Moghul emperor  
**Akbar**. Earlier writers report an  
enormous tree on the site, but in modern times the tree is quite small. In some  
stories it was cut down by one of Akbar’s  
successors. According to the seventhcentury Chinese pilgrim **Hsuan Tsang**,  
25  
Akshaya Vata  
one of the preferred methods for  
committing religious **suicide** was to  
jump from the branches of the vata  
tree; this practice is also mentioned  
four centuries later by the Islamic  
scholar **Alberuni**.
