(“measuring after”) In Indian **philosophy** this is the term for an inference,  
which is generally accepted as one of the  
**pramanas**, the means by which human  
beings can gain true and accurate knowledge. The word’s literal meaning reflects  
the Indian conviction that any inference

Anulepana  
must be grounded in perception  
(**pratyaksha**), the most direct means of  
knowledge, and must ultimately appeal  
to perception for evidence.  
A classic inference includes three  
terms: a hypothesis (**pratijna**), a reason (**hetu**), and examples (**drshtanta**),  
each of which is made up of parts.  
One part of the hypothesis is the idea  
to be proved (**sadhya**), which is predicated on a certain class of objects,  
called the **paksha**. In the statement  
“there is fire on this mountain,” the  
sadhya is the assertion that there is  
fire, and the paksha is the particular  
mountain. The object mentioned in  
the paksha must also appear in the  
second term, the hetu, along with the  
stated reason. In the example cited  
above, the hetu could be “because  
there is smoke on this mountain.”  
As proof, it was necessary to cite positive and negative examples, known as  
the **sapaksha** and **vipaksha**, respectively.  
An appropriate sapaksha could be “like  
kitchen,” since ancient kitchens had  
both fire and smoke; a vipaksha could be  
“unlike lake,” since lakes contain neither  
of these.  
This general form of an inference  
is subject to numerous tests for  
validity; one of the most important of  
these is **vyapti**, the requirement that  
the reason given must account for  
all cases of the idea to be proved. For
