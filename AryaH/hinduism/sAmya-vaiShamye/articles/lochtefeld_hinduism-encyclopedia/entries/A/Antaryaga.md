title = "Antaryaga"

+++
(“internal **sacrifice**”) In Hindu **worship**,  
but especially in the secret ritual tradition known as **tantra**, antaryaga refers  
to the internalization of worship. In this  
process, worship involving external  
actions is replaced by worship based on  
mental acts.  
This is a later phase of the initiate’s  
spiritual path, and is attempted only  
after the initiate has mastered the external forms of worship. The process of  
internalization becomes progressively  
more subtle and sophisticated. This step  
also demonstrates that the initiate has  
achieved more highly developed religious capacities, in which external  
objects are no longer needed.
