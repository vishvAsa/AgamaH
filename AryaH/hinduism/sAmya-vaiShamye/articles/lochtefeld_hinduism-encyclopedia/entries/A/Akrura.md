title = "Akrura"

+++
In Hindu mythology Akrura is most  
famous as the envoy from the royal  
court at **Mathura**, who takes the god  
**Krishna** away from Krishna’s childhood  
home in **Braj**, never to return. Krishna’s  
wicked uncle, King **Kamsa**, instructs  
Akrura to lure Krishna and his brother  
**Balarama** to a festival, where they will  
be killed in a “friendly” bout with some  
wrestlers. Akrura sees through the plot  
and warns Krishna about it, but he  
remains indelibly associated with  
Krishna’s departure from Braj, which for  
his devotees (**bhakta**) is the bitterest  
moment in all of Krishna’s mythology.  
For a moving, dramatic account of this  
incident, see John Stratton Hawley, *At*  
*Play with Krishna*, 1981.
