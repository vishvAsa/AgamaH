title = "Anandapala"

+++
The last great king in the Pratihara  
dynasty, which ruled large sections of the  
northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent between the eighth and eleventh  
centuries. In 1001 C.E., Anandapala  
assembled a coalition of Hindu princes  
to do battle with **Mahmud of Ghazni** in a  
desperate attempt to halt the latter’s  
expansion. Anandapala and his allies  
were annihilated in a battle near  
Peshawar in modern Pakistan, and the  
Pratihara dynasty’s power was completely  
destroyed. With this powerful dynasty  
out of the way, there was no political  
force in northern India strong enough to  
stop Mahmud. He began making annual  
raids into India.
