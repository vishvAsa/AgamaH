title = "Alberuni"

(973–ca.1050 C.E.) Anglicized version  
of the name of Abu Rayhan Biruni, a  
central Asian scholar-scientist who  
was one of the greatest intellectual figures of his time. Alberuni was a member of the court of King **Mahmud of**  
**Ghazni**—by most accounts, quite  
reluctantly—and was forced to accompany Mahmud on some of his pillaging raids in India. Alberuni used this  
involuntary “fieldwork” as an opportunity to study Hindu life, culture, and  
sciences, and his work shows him to  
be a perceptive, careful, and dispassionate observer. In 1030 C.E. he published his findings in his *Tahqiq ma*  
*li’l-Hind*, which was translated in 1888  
by Edward Sachau as *Alberuni’s India*.  
An abridged edition edited by Ainslee  
Embree was published in 1971.
