title = "Asamanjasa"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the son of the  
celebrated King **Sagar** and his wife  
**Keshini**. Keshini has received a boon  
that she will bear a single son through  
whom the royal lineage will continue,  
whereas her co-wife **Sumati** will bear  
sixty thousand **sons** who will all die  
before they are married. Asamanjasa is  
that single son, but his character is so  
bad that his lineage, the **Solar Line**,  
seems to be in grave danger.  
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Hindu epics, the only mention of Asamanjasa describes how he  
throws children into the Sarayu River  
and then laughs as they drown.  
Fortunately for the Solar Line, which is  
one of the two great lineages,  
Asamanjasaâ€™s son **Anshuman** is very  
virtuous, and the line continues both  
unbroken and uncorrupted.
