(“entering **fire**”) Death by fire, which  
could occur in several different contexts.  
This was often used to refer to the  
practice of **sati**, in which a **widow** would  
be burned on her husband’s funeral pyre.  
Death by fire was also one of the mandated forms of religious **suicide**; this  
could be done either as a means of relief  
for someone afflicted by an incurable  
disease, or as part of certain rites of  
**sacrifice** such as the **sarvasvara**, which  
was performed to send the sacrificer  
to **heaven**. By the beginning of the  
eighteenth century, religious suicide had  
been condemned and had fallen into  
disuse. In the nineteenth century, British  
horror at the practice of sati led them to  
ban it wherever they were able to do so.
