(“quickly satisfied”) Epithet of the god  
**Shiva**. This name reflects Shiva’s relationship with his devotees (**bhakta**), as  
well as his ultimate nature. When his  
devotees approach him with sincerity,  
he demands neither expensive **offerings**  
nor prolonged **worship**, and he extends  
his favor immediately. See **Shiva**.
