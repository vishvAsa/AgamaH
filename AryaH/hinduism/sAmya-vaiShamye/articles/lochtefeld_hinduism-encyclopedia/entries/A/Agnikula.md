(“fire lineage”) A collective name for  
the four main clans of **Rajputs**  
(warrior princes): the Pariharas,  
Chauhans, Solankis, and Pawars.  
According to tradition, this collective  
name refers to the Rajputs’ descent  
from a single mythical king  
who had arisen from a sacrificial fire  
pit at Mount Abu in the state  
of **Rajasthan**. Although their  
historical origin is unclear, these  
four clans ruled over much of  
northwestern India, either as  
independent kings or feudal vassals,  
after their appearance at the end  
of the first millennium. The Pariharas  
ruled southern Rajasthan. The  
Chauhans ruled the region around  
Delhi. The Solankis ruled in **Gujarat**.  
The Pawars ruled in western **Madhya**  
**Pradesh**. Although their days as  
warrior princes have passed, they  
remain influential in politics, both  
as politicians and as constituent  
communities.
