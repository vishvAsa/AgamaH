(2) In one of the great Hindu epics, the  
**Mahabharata**, Ambika is the **daughter**  
of the king of **Kashi** and the wife of King  
**Vichitravirya**. When Vichitravirya dies  
childless, his mother, **Satyavati**, calls  
upon her oldest **son**, **Vyasa**, to have sex  
with Ambika and her sister **Ambalika** in  
the hope that the **women** will conceive  
and continue the family line. According  
to tradition, Vyasa is very ugly, and each  
woman involuntarily reacts when Vyasa  
appears in her bed. Ambika covers her  
eyes, causing her son **Dhrtarashtra** to  
be born blind, and Ambalika turns pale,  
causing her son **Pandu** to have an  
unnaturally pale complexion.
