title = "Abortion"

+++
Hindu views toward abortion have  
varied widely over the course of time.  
It is unequivocally condemned in the  
**dharma literature**, which prescribes  
loss of **caste** for a person procuring an  
abortion or for a **woman** having one.  
This prescription may have been  
based on the use of abortion to conceal illegitimate **births**, but it may well  
have been condemned because it  
entailed the loss of a potential son.  
In modern times attitudes have  
changed somewhat, in part because of  
family planning initiatives and in  
more recent times because of the  
technology available for sex determination. Abortion facilities are now  
more widely available in India due to  
the governmentâ€™s emphasis on family  
planning and population control, and  
there is less social stigma associated  
with the procedure. However, traditional proscriptions remain. With the  
advent of methods for prenatal sex  
determination, couples began selectively aborting female fetuses because  
**sons** are more highly valued in Hindu  
society. This practice was widespread  
and generated such concern that it  
was outlawed in 1995, although the  
law has reportedly only succeeded in  
driving this practice underground.
