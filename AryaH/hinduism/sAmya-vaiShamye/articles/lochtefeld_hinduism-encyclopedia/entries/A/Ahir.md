The model for traditional Indian society  
was as a collection of **endogamous** subgroups known as **jatis** (**birth**). These  
jatis were organized (and their social  
status largely determined) by the groupâ€™s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group had a monopoly. In traditional  
northern Indian society, the Ahiras were  
a jati whose hereditary occupation was  
herding and selling milk.
