title = "Avahana"

(“summoning”) The first of the sixteen  
**upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to a  
**deity** as part of **worship**, which is done  
to treat the deity as an honored guest.  
Although the literal translation of this  
word (“summoning”) seems inappropriate for interacting with a god, the  
true sense of the word is inviting the  
deity to become present for worship,  
just as one would invite a guest into  
one’s house for hospitality.
