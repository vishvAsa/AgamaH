(“superimposition”) In **Advaita Vedanta**,  
one of the **six schools** of classical Indian  
**philosophy**, this is a key concept used to  
explain the ultimate unreality of the  
world around us, despite its apparent

architecture is the adhishthana, a raised base upon which the temple is built.  
reality. For the Advaita Vedanta school,  
there is ultimately only one real idea in  
the universe, namely **Brahman**. All  
things are in fact that one thing, and this  
never changes. Since Brahman is the  
all in all, it can never actually be an  
object of perception (**pratyaksha**). What  
the Advaitins then have to explain  
is how things in the world apparently  
change, or seem diverse and different.  
This is explained as stemming from  
our mistaken perception and understanding. They call this notion  
adhyasa, which is rooted in the human  
tendency to “construct” a picture of  
world. According to this explanation,  
human beings superimpose a false  
understanding (that reality is diverse  
and differentiated) on top of the correct  
understanding (that all reality is nothing  
but undifferentiated Brahman).  
According to the Advaitins, the world is  
real because Brahman is real. What is  
not real is the world as most unenlightened people perceive it.  
Advaitins illustrate this concept by  
two well-known errors in judgment: the  
case of a rope that one briefly mistakes  
for a snake, or a post that one imagines  
is a man. Although these judgments are  
erroneous—as one quickly discovers—  
they are not made up out of nothing. In  
each case, one is perceiving something  
real—the rope and post both actually  
exist—but “superimposing” a different  
and mistaken identity on these things,  
and thus “transforming” them into  
something they are not. In the same  
way, it is argued, human consciousness  
begins with the Supreme Reality  
(Brahman), which is actually there, but  
superimposes onto it something which  
is not (the judgment of a diverse world).  
According to the Advaitins, the real  
problem is epistemological, that is, how  
human beings come to know things,  
rather than in the nature of the things  
themselves. One comes to a true  
understanding not when the things  
themselves change—to refer back to the  
example, the rope always was and  
always will be a rope—but with the  
destruction of the mistaken notions that  
led to the initial error, and their  
replacement by true understanding.  
For the Advaitins, adhyasa is a  
manifestation of **avidya** (lack of true  
knowledge); this avidya is reinforced  
and upheld by the **karmic** power of  
one’s mistaken thoughts and actions.  
Adhyasa immediately disappears at the  
moment true understanding is gained,  
when one comprehends that the world  
(and oneself ) are both nothing but  
Brahman. This moment of realization  
brings ultimate wisdom that can never  
be lost, just as that once one has  
recognized the piece of rope, it can  
never again become a snake. For further
