+++
Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the bright (waxing) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Phalgun**  
(Februaryâ€“March). As are all of the  
eleventh-day observances, this is dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**. Most  
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed  
rites, usually involving fasting (**upavasa**)  
and worship, and often promise specific  
benefits for faithful performance. On  
this day, one should worship the amvala  
tree since this is one of the places in  
which Vishnu is believed to reside.
