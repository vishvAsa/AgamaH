+++
One of the prominent branches of the  
**Swaminarayan sect**, which split off  
from its parent body in 1906. The  
Swaminarayan movement is based on  
the teachings of Sahajananda Swami  
(1781–1830), an **ascetic** who was a devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**.  
Sahajananda’s followers eventually  
revered him as a manifestation of  
**Krishna** (an incarnation of Vishnu),  
based on the idea that **avatars** of Vishnu  
appear on **earth** in times of extreme  
trouble. This same reverence is given to  
Sahajananda Swami’s ascetic successors, who are known by the title  
**Pramukh Swami** (“President Swami”).  
At present the Akshar Purushottam  
Samstha has several million lay devotees  
(**bhakta**) who are mainly **Gujarati** merchants; their affluence has helped make  
the movement financially strong. The  
most important figures in the movement  
are the small number of ascetics who  
serve as teachers and spiritual advisers,  
headed by the Pramukh Swami. For further information see Raymond Brady  
Williams, *A New Face of Hinduism*, 1984.
