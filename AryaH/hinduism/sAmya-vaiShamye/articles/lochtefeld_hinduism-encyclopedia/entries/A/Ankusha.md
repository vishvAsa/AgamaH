title = "Ankusha"

+++
(“**elephant** goad”) This is a weapon with  
a wooden or metal handle, with a point  
and a sharp hook that real elephant handlers use to coax and goad elephants—  
sometimes by poking them with the  
hook, sometimes by hitting them with  
the butt of the handle.  
The ankusha is an important symbol  
in Hindu iconography and is primarily  
associated with the god **Ganesh**—perhaps partly because of his elephant head.  
This weapon also corresponds with  
Ganesh’s stature as the Lord of Obstacles,  
since he can use the ankusha to poke  
and prod them out of the way.  
Aside from Ganesh, the ankusha is  
also a symbol associated with certain  
powerful forms of the **Goddess**. This  
may originate with the myth that  
describes her as being formed from the  
collected radiance of all the gods, and  
receiving duplicates of their weapons  
from them.
