title = "Alandi"

+++
**Maharashtra** village famous as the  
home of the poet-saint **Jnaneshvar** and  
the site of his **samadhi** (**burial**) **shrine**.  
Jnaneshvar was the first great figure in  
the **Varkari Panth**, a religious community centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba**. Varkari religious  
practice centers primarily around two  
annual pilgrimages, in which all the  
participants arrive in **Pandharpur** in the  
modern state of Maharashtra on the  
same day. Despite having been dead for  
over 700 years, Jnaneshvar still symbolically travels from Alandi to Pandharpur  
twice each year; a **palanquin** (palkhi)  
carrying his sandals is at the head of the  
procession bearing his name.
