title = "Aryan"

+++
This word is derived from the **Sanskrit**  
word *arya* (“noble”), which is used in the  
earliest Hindu sacred literature, the  
**Vedas**, to describe a certain group of  
people that believed the Vedas were  
sacred. In the beginning this word simply designated “our group” from “other  
people,” whom the Veda names **Dasyus**  
(“slaves”). These provide a description of  
the slaves as having flat noses and curly  
**hair**. Throughout history Hindu writers  
have often described themselves as  
“Arya,” although it is important to note  
that this need not be understood as a  
racial designation, since it could merely  
be intended to mean “noble.”  
Who were these Aryans? Nineteenthcentury European philological  
research discovered structural relationships between Sanskrit and  
classical European languages and  
speculated that all these languages  
came from a common parent. Based  
on further analysis, these researchers  
hypothesized that people speaking  
this parent language originated in  
Central Asia, somewhere near the  
Caspian Sea. From there, some went  
west to Europe, some went southwest  
to Turkey, and some went south  
toward Iran and later to India. The  
conclusion that these Indian pilgrims  
came from Iran is based on comparisons between the Avesta and the  
Veda, the Iranian and Indian religious  
texts. These texts show broad linguistic similarities and indicate that the  
people speaking the languages were  
closely related. This entire theory is  
thus based solely on the observed  
similarities between languages and on  
how they changed.  
For the nineteenth-century philologists, “Aryan” was a linguistic category  
used to designate people speaking  
certain languages and involved no  
assumptions about the speakers’  
racial identity. Despite this fact,  
the word quickly assumed a racial  
connotation in European discourse,  
with terrible consequences.

The Aryan movement was once  
described as an “invasion,” but in recent  
years it has become more common to  
describe it as a “migration.” According to  
the accounts in the Vedas, the Aryans  
were a pastoral people, and although  
some Vedic passages mention war  
chariots, the majority describe herds of  
cattle. Given this picture of nomads following their cattle to pasture, the image  
of an invading army seems improbable.  
The Aryan migration theory  
accounts for the dissemination of various languages but is not universally  
accepted. Many modern Indians  
subscribe to the **Indigenous Aryan** (IA)  
**theory**, which maintains that the Aryans  
are the original inhabitants of India and  
as proof points to the artifacts found in  
the **Indus Valley civilization**. Some of  
the people that believe the IA theory may  
be reacting against the Aryan migration  
theory’s perceived colonialist bias, since  
the theory was developed by Europeans  
and assumes that the dominant groups  
in modern India must have come from  
outside. Other supporters are the proponents of **Hindutva**, who claim that all  
Indians are “really” Hindus and thus one  
social group, whatever their particular  
religious beliefs.  
This assertion has profound political  
implications in modern India, where  
Christians and Muslims are not only  
religious communities but social and  
political ones as well. By connecting  
Hindu identity with good Indian  
citizenship, Hindutva proponents are  
marginalizing Christians and Muslims  
as outsiders.
