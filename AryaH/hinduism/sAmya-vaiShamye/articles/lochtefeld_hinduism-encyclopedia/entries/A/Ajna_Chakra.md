title = "Ajna Chakra"

+++
In many schools of **yoga** and in the esoteric  
ritual tradition known as **tantra**, the ajna  
chakra is one of the six psychic centers  
(**chakras**) thought to be in the **subtle body**.  
The subtle body is an alternate physiological system, believed to exist on a different  
plane of existence than gross matter but  
with certain correspondences to the material body. The subtle body is comprised of  
a set of six chakras, which are visualized as  
multipetaled lotus flowers running roughly along the course of the spine, connected  
by three vertical channels. Each chakra has  
important symbolic associationsâ€”with  
differing human capacities, different subtle elements (**tanmatras**), and different  
seed syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed from  
the letters of the **Sanskrit** alphabet, thus  
encompassing all sacred sound. Above and  
below the chakras are the bodily abodes of  
**Shiva** (awareness) and **Shakti** (power), the  
two divine principles through which the  
entire universe has come into being. The  
underlying assumption behind this concept of the subtle body is thus the homology of macrocosm and microcosm, an  
essential Hindu idea since the time of the  
mystical texts known as the **Upanishads**.  
The six chakras are traditionally enumerated from the bottom up, and the  
ajna chakra is the sixth and highest of  
these. It is visualized as a two-petaled  
lotus located in the forehead just above  
the top of the nose. Its petals contain the  
bijaksharas Ham and Ksam, formed  
from the last two letters of the Sanskrit  
alphabet. The ajna chakra is associated  
with the capacity for thought, considered a distinctively human capacity and  
thus the most important human faculty.
