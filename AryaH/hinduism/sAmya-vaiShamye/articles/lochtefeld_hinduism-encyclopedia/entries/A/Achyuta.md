title = "Achyuta"

+++
(“imperishable”) Epithet of **Vishnu**,  
referring to the devotees’ (**bhakta**)  
beliefs that nothing can stand against  
Vishnu and that his power will never  
wane. Hindu **deities** often have many  
names that sometimes denote unique  
form of the deity and at other times  
denote a special quality of the deity.  
No two deities will ever share the same  
epithet. The proliferation of names for  
deities may be related in part to the  
characteristics of the **Sanskrit** language, which is rich with synonyms.  
This allows words to fit into various  
poetic **meters**. See **Vishnu**.
