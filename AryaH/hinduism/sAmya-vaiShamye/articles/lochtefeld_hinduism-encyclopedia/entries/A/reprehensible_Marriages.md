title = "(“reprehensible”) Marriages"

+++
According to the texts on religious duty  
(**dharma**) known as the **Dharma**  
**Shastras**, these are the four forms of  
marriage subject to disapproval: the  
**asura marriage**, **gandharva marriage**,  
**rakshasa marriage**, and **paishacha**  
**marriage**. Although all of these are  
considered reprehensible, this disapproval comes in differing measures:  
the asura (paying money for a bride)  
and gandharva (betrothal by mutual  
consent) marriages are tolerated,  
while the rakshasa (forcible abduction)  
and paishacha (taking advantage  
of an insentient woman) forms  
are forbidden.  
Despite such harsh condemnation,  
all of these marriages are held to be  
legally valid. It is generally agreed that  
this position was intended not to legitimatize unconscionable actions but to  
give the woman the legal rights of a wife,  
whatever the circumstances of her marriage. The asura marriage is the only one  
of these forms still practiced in modern  
times, although it is done only by people  
who are either very poor or of very low  
social status.
