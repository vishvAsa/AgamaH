In the Hindu epic the **Mahabharata**, a  
group of twelve divine **sons** born to the  
sage **Kashyapa** and his wife **Aditi**, from  
whom these sons get their collective  
name. The twelve are named Dhata,  
Aryama, Mitra, Shakra (**Indra**), **Varuna**,  
Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan (**Surya**),  
**Pushan**, Savitr, **Tvashtr**, and **Vishnu**.  
Several of these **deities** are important  
figures in the religious scriptures known  
as the **Vedas**, and Vishnu later gained  
prominence as one of the primary  
Hindu gods. On one hand, the Adityas  
illustrate the Hindu concept that the  
divine beings (**devas**) have many similarities to humans, although they are  
more powerful and live in a different  
world, the **heavens**. On the other hand,  
they also demonstrate how the Hindu  
tradition changes over time. Among the  
Adityas, Vishnu is one of a number of  
divine beings who are all subject to  
**birth**, death, and the operation of  
**karma**, whereas in his later aspect as the  
Supreme Being, he is considered not  
only to be beyond all these forces, but to  
wield control over them.  
The twelve Adityas are the sun in  
the twelve months of the year. In at  
least one of the Puranas these twelve  
Adityas are each connected with a  
particular sign of the **zodiac**.
