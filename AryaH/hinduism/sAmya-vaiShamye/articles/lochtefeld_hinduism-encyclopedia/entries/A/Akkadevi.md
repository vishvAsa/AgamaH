title = "Akkadevi"

+++
Sister of King Jayasimha II (1015–1042  
C.E.), a monarch in the **Chalukya**  
**dynasty** that ruled large parts of the  
**Deccan** peninsula. Akkadevi was important not only through her family connections but also because she served as  
a provincial governor in her brother’s  
kingdom. Her example shows that  
**women** in powerful families have often  
been able to overcome the seeming  
social disadvantages imposed by their  
gender, a maxim proven most recently  
by Sonia Gandhi.
