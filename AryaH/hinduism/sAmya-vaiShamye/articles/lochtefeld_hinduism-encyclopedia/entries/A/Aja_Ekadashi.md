title = "Aja Ekadashi"

+++
Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the dark (waning) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September). As are all of the  
eleventh-day observances, this is dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**. Most  
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed rites, usually involving fasting  
(**upavasa**) and worship, and often  
promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. The most important  
requirement for this festival is to pass  
the night in worship; taking part is  
believed to free one from all evil. The  
name Aja means “unborn” and is one  
of the epithets of Vishnu.
