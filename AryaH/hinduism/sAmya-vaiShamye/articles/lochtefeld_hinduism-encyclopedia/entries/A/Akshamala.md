title = "Akshamala"

+++
A string of beads used to keep count  
when reciting prayers or **mantras**,  
sometimes translated by the accessible but misleading term “rosary.” An  
akshamala is one of the most common  
religious articles, and the materials  
24  
Akhyati  
from which it is made can often reveal  
sectarian affiliations. **Shiva** is often  
depicted wearing beads made of the  
seeds of the *Elaeocarpus ganitrus* tree,  
which are known as **rudraksha** (“eye of  
**Rudra**”). Devotees (**bhakta**) of Shiva  
emulate this practice. Devotees of the  
god **Vishnu** often carry beads made of  
wood from the **tulsi** plant, which is  
considered a form of Vishnu’s wife  
**Lakshmi**. Other commonly used materials are sandalwood and crystal, but  
akshamalas can also be made from  
expensive materials such as coral and  
amber. In Hindu iconography the  
akshamala is one of the items commonly held by the **goddess Saraswati**,  
in keeping with her identity as the  
patron **deity** of learning and, by implication, sacred sound. The akshamala  
is also one of the items commonly held  
by the god **Brahma**, but in his case it  
has less specific significance.
