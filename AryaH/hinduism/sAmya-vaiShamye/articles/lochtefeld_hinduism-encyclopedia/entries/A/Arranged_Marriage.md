title = "Arranged Marriage"

+++
A marriage that is arranged by the  
parents of the bride and groom,  
although it has become fairly common  
for the prospective couple to meet  
beforehand to assess whether or not  
they are compatible.  
Although this practice seems strange  
by mainstream American standards,  
proponents of arranged marriages see  
them as better and longer lasting than  
**love marriages**. It is assumed that with  
arranged marriages parents will be able  
to take a more detached and rational  
perspective. They will usually choose  
spouses who come from similar social  
and economic backgrounds, in many  
cases from the same **jati**, or social subgroup. Parents may compare their children’s horoscopes for clues, and they  
may also try to match people with compatible personalities. Ideally, all of this is  
done with great care and with the  
understanding that their highest priority will be their children’s long-term welfare. Marriage is widely seen as the most  
important event in a person’s life since it  
is the basis of family life, and the family  
is the foundation of society. Part of the  
marriage negotiations between the two  
sides includes whether or not the bride  
will have a **dowry**, and if she will, what  
this will be.  
One of the assumptions with  
arranged marriages is that men and  
**women** will play fairly traditional roles.  
This gives the couple some idea of what  
to expect and what is expected of them,  
but it can also be confining for people  
who do not wish to fulfill such roles. At  
least in northern India, the adjustments  
often fall much more heavily on the new  
bride, since she will become part of her  
husband’s family.  
Arranged marriages are still extremely  
popular among modern Hindu families,  
and many young people would not  
dream of fixing their own marriages. A  
practical consideration supporting the  
popularity of arranged marriages is that  
it is often difficult for young people to  
meet and develop the friendships that  
could lead to love marriages. Indian  
society is still very sex segregated. Social  
interaction between unrelated single  
men and women is still uncommon in  
villages and smaller towns, although this  
pattern is breaking down in larger cities  
since more women are working outside  
the home.  
In both contexts the biggest mixing  
place tends to be the college or  
university, but even there women and  
men tend to associate in groups  
rather than as individuals. In a society  
in which contact is limited, and formal  
dating even more unusual, an arranged  
marriage is often the best way to find  
a compatible spouse.
