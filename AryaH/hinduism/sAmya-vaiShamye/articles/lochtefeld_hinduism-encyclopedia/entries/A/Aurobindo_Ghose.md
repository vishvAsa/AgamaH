title = "Aurobindo Ghose"

+++
(1872–1950) Freedom fighter, philosopher, and **ascetic yogi**. He is perceived  
as a modern example of the concern for  
ultimate truth that always runs beneath  
the surface of Hindu life.  
Until he was twenty, Aurobindo  
lived much of his life in England, to  
fulfill his father’s desire to see his **son**  
get a “proper” English education.  
Upon his return to India, Aurobindo  
was more interested in politics than in  
working, and after a few years quit his  
job to take part in the political struggle  
70  
Atranji Khera  
against the British government. His  
political career lasted only four years,  
but his intellect and energy soon made  
him a leader in the Bengali language  
and national politics.  
His life was transformed again by a  
stay in prison, during which he  
remembered the advice of an ascetic  
who had told him to focus on his inner  
self. Aurobindo later had a vision of  
**Swami Vivekananda**, who guided his  
**yoga** practice, and after he was  
released from prison, Aurobindo withdrew from political life. In 1910 he  
moved to the French enclave of  
Pondicherry in southern India, where  
he lived until his death in 1950.  
Aurobindo spent these years developing his spiritual life, and in his later  
years he was known as Shri Aurobindo.  
His teachings focus on the insights  
found in the **Upanishads**, and stress  
the development of true knowledge,  
which leads to self-realization.
