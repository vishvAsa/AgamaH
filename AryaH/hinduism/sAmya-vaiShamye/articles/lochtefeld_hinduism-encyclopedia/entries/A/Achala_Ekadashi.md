title = "Achala Ekadashi"

+++
Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the dark (waning) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Jyeshth**  
(May–June). As are all of the eleventhday observances, this is dedicated to  
the **worship** of the god **Vishnu**. The  
name Achala means “immovable”;  
another name for this ekadashi is  
*apara*, meaning “matchless.” The  
name refers to the religious merit generated by observing this festival,  
which, according to tradition, cannot  
be nullified or overturned. Most Hindu  
festivals have certain prescribed rites,  
usually involving fasting (**upavasa**)  
and worship, and often promise specific benefits for faithful performance.  
Individual observance varies depending on a person’s piety and inclinations. Fasting, for instance, can vary  
from abstaining only from certain  
foods to refraining from all foods during the day. Individuals may go to temples for worship, or they may worship  
in their homes. Faithfully observing  
this festival is believed to absolve one  
of the evil effects of one’s past deeds,  
particularly deeds that would result in  
**birth** as a **pret**, or unquiet spirit, and  
also to increase one’s fame, wealth,  
and religious merit.
