title = "Ananda Marga Yoga Society"

+++
Modern Hindu organization founded  
by Shri Anandamurti. The Society  
emphasizes **yoga** and meditation, which  
are intended to set its practitioners on  
the path (marga) to bliss (**ananda**). The  
movement is the strongest in the state of  
**West Bengal**, and has been dogged by  
controversy in India, particularly after  
Anandamurti was indicted for the murder of two of his disciples. In the end he  
was acquitted of all charges, but the  
organizationâ€™s legal troubles made its  
members withdraw from society. Many  
Indians view them with suspicion, if not  
outright hostility, and the movement is  
associated with ritual murder and black  
**magic**. In recent times, it has even been  
suspected of terrorism, after a large  
shipment of black-market arms was  
mysteriously parachuted into a nearby  
region in early 1995. Although it has  
never been proved that the arms were  
for the Society, this incident is one more  
element in the surrounding cloud of  
secrecy and suspicion.
