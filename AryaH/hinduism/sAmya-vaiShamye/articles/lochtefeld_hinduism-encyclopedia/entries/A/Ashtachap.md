(“eight seals”) A group of eight northern  
Indian **bhakti** (devotional) poets:  
**Surdas**, **Krishnadas**, **Parmananddas**,  
**Kumbhadas**, **Nanddas**, **Chaturbhujdas**,  
**Chitswami**, and **Govindswami**.  
In the sectarian literature of the  
**Pushti Marg**, a **Vaishnava** community  
whose members are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of **Krishna**, all eight of these poets are  
named as members of the sect and associates of the Pushti Marg’s early leaders.  
Surdas, Krishnadas, Parmananddas, and  
Kumbhadas are connected with the  
Pushti Marg’s founder, **Vallabhacharya**  
(1479–1531); Nanddas, Chaturbhujdas,  
Chitswami, and Govindswami are associated with Vallabha’s **son** and successor,  
**Vitthalnath** (r. 1566–1585). Evidence of  
their membership can be found in their  
poetry, which confirms this claim for  
many of the poets; for Surdas, however,  
this claim seems highly unlikely.
