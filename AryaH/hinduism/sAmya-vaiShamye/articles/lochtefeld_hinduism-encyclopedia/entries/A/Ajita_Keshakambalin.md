title = "Ajita Keshakambalin"

In classical Indian **philosophy**, the  
reputed founder of a **materialist**  
philosophical school and whose name  
reflects his usual garb—a hair blanket  
(kesha-kambal). Ajita was a contemporary of the Buddha, and information about him comes from the  
Buddhist scriptures. Ajita’s materialist  
philosophy was that human beings are  
composed of four elements, that these  
elements disperse after death, and  
that the individual then ceases to  
exist. Given this philosophy, Ajita  
believed that one should enjoy life  
while one could, taking pleasure in the  
good and accepting the bad, and that  
all religious observances were a waste  
of time and a futile hope. Ajita was the  
first in a long tradition of materialists,  
and one finds evidence of this materialist perspective as late as the eighth  
century of the common era.
