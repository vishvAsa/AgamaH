Hindu temple architecture in India has  
developed over time into several distinct, mature styles. The earliest phases  
are based on early Buddhist architectural forms, such as the rock-cut cave temple (**chaitya**) or enclosed courtyard  
(**vihara**). Some of these early Hindu  
rock-cut temples include those at **Ellora**  
and **Elephanta**; others are free-standing  
but based on this form, as at **Aihole**.  
Later Hindu architecture has three  
basic styles: **Nagara**, **Dravida**, and  
**Veshara**, of which the first two are the  
most important. Each of these styles is  
found in a certain area of India: the  
Nagara in the north and east, the Dravida  
in the south, and the Veshara in the west  
and in **Deccan**. The basic differences  
between them can be simplified to the  
different styles of the temple towers.  
The Nagara style emphasizes verticality, with the whole temple building  
culminating in a single highest point.  
Different emphases in the ways of  
treating the tower led to different  
substyles: In the temples at **Khajuraho**,  
the entire structure gradually leads up  
to the central tower, whereas the  
**Orissa** style stresses a single enormous  
tower surrounded by much smaller  
subsidiary parts.  
In the Dravida style, the towers tend  
to be composed of horizontal tiers, with  
the visual emphasis on horizontal rather  
than vertical. In the later Dravida  
temples, the tallest structures are the  
**gopurams**, the central gateways in  
the walls enclosing the temples. A  
Dravida-style temple may have a fairly  
modest tower over the central shrine, but  
the area covered by the temple is often  
enormous, and many of them are cities in  
their own right.  
The Veshara style has a barrel roof  
over the sanctuary, an architectural

chaityas (rock-cut cave temples). This  
architectural style is midway between the  
Nagara towers and the Dravida tiers.
