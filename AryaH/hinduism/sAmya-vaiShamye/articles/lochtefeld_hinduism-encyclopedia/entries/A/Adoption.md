One of the most important requirements  
for every Hindu male is to have at least  
one son, so that the funeral rites for himself and for his ancestors will be correctly  
performed and maintained. These rites  
are considered central for the well-being  
of the dead, particularly the recently  
departed. Even in modern times, only  
men are allowed to perform funeral rites.  
Given the importance of these ceremonies, men with no biological **sons**  
adopt a son to guarantee the performance  
of the ceremony. The ideal candidate is a  
blood relative, such as a brotherâ€™s son, who  
is of equal social status with the adoptive  
father. Through adoption the boy  
becomes a member of another family, but  
the legal texts disagree on his continuing  
relationship with his natal family. Many  
sources claim that an adopted son has no  
right to the **inheritance** of his natal family  
and no entitlement to offer funeral rites  
for those ancestors, since by adoption he  
has become part of another family. Other  
texts speak of special arrangements by  
which an adopted son is considered to  
have two fathers, one biological, one  
adopted. He inherits from, and performs  
ancestral rites for both fathers.
