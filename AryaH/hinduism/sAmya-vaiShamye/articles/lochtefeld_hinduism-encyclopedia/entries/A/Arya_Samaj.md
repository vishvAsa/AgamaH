title = "Arya Samaj"

+++
Reformist Hindu organization formed in  
1875 by **Swami Dayanand Saraswati**.  
The Arya Samaj was formed in an era of  
sweeping social, economic, and religious change—the last particularly  
caused by Christian missionary evangelism—and represented an authentic  
Hindu response to these changes.  
For some time, more traditional  
Hindus perceived this organization as a  
genuine religious threat. Swami  
Dayanand’s fundamental assumption  
was that ultimate religious authority lay  
only in the ancient scriptures called the  
**Vedas**. This stance allowed him to attack  
many of the “social evils” plaguing nineteenth-century Hinduism, such as child  
marriages, **sati**, image **worship**, the  
**caste** system, and a ban on **widow**  
remarriage. He contended that these  
practices were corrupt and illegitimate  
since they could not be found in the  
Veda, and the Arya Samaj worked ceaselessly to get rid of such practices.  
Unlike the **Brahmo Samaj**, an  
earlier reformist organization, the ideas  
of the Arya Samaj showed no  
Christian influence. It certainly addressed  
many concerns raised by Christian  
reformers, but the Arya Samaj was  
militantly anti-Christian. It was  
equally opposed to the “corruption”  
of contemporary Hinduism.  
Although the Aryas claimed that they  
were simply getting back to the Veda, the  
ultimate aim was not to reclaim that  
long-gone era but to develop a form of  
Hindu religious life more compatible  
with “modern” times. The Aryas  
replaced image worship with a **fire sacrifice** based on the rituals in the Veda.  
The Arya Samaj was also notable for  
promoting the ceremony of “purification” (**shuddhi**), through which Hindus  
who had become members of other religious communities were received back  
into the Hindu community.  
Dayanand and his followers were  
quite militant in espousing such reforms  
and saw themselves as developing the  
leadership for the future of Hinduism.  
To accomplish this the Arya Samaj  
strongly emphasized education, and  
one of its most lasting achievements has  
been establishing schools and colleges  
to educate its **women** and men.  
Although the Arya Samaj was highly  
controversial for its first sixty years, by  
the late 1930s its revolutionary spirit had  
somewhat cooled; at present the Aryas  
have become a sectarian group more or  
less assimilated into larger Hindu
