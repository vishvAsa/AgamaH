title = "Airavata"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the divine **elephant** who is the vehicle of **Indra**, king  
of the gods. The only significant role  
Airavata plays in any myth is as the ultimate cause for why the gods have to  
churn the Ocean of Milk. One day the  
powerful and irascible sage **Durvasas**  
gives a garland to Indra. Indra places the  
garland on Airavata, who throws it on  
the ground. The reasons for this differâ€”  
in one account Airavata is plagued by  
the bees gathering on it, and in another  
he is intoxicated by the scent of the flowers. Durvasas understands this as an  
insult and, in his anger, **curses** the gods  
to be subject to old age and death. The  
only way the gods can escape the effects  
of the curse is to obtain the nectar of  
immortality, which is done by churning  
the Ocean of Milk. See also **Tortoise avatar**.
