+++
In Hindu mythology Anasuya is the wife  
of the sage **Atri**. On one occasion  
Anasuya is begged by the gods **Brahma**,  
**Vishnu**, and **Shiva** to help them. A  
woman named Silavati has cursed the  
**sun** not to rise, and the creatures on  
**earth** are very distressed. Anasuya succeeds in persuading Silavati to recall her  
**curse**, and in their gratitude the three  
gods tell her she can ask for whatever she  
wants. Anasuya requests that each be  
born as one of her **sons**, and this is granted:  
Vishnu is born as **Dattatreya**, Shiva as  
**Durvasas**, and Brahma as Chandra.
