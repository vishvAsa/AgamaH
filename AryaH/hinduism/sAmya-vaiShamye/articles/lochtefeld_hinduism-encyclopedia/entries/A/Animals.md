title = "Animals"

+++
In the Hindu religion, it is believed  
that some human beings can be  
reincarnated as animals. According to  
generally held notions about **karma**,  
being born as an animal is an  
unfavorable rebirth in punishment for a  
previous grave sin. One is born as an  
animal to expiate, or atone for, one’s evil

deeds through suffering, in many cases  
by being born as a particular type of  
animal thousands of consecutive times.  
Unlike the Jains, who see all matter  
(even stones) as possessing souls, most  
Hindus would consider this possible  
only for sentient, or fully aware, beings,  
including animal life. The conviction  
that animals have souls is one of the reasons why many Hindus are vegetarian,  
since this diet does the least harm to  
other living things.  
For Hindus, the animal realm is considered a place of punishment. From a  
karmic perspective, being born as an  
animal is an unenviable state, since animal behavior is run entirely by instinct,  
and thus as animals they can make no  
conscious effort to better themselves.  
From a more concrete perspective, animals in India often lead very difficult  
lives—including, in many cases, the  
“sacred” **cow**.  
As with all other unfavorable karmic  
states, one’s animal life will eventually  
end, but only after one’s sins have been  
fully expiated. This suffering and lack of  
control over one’s destiny makes birth as  
an animal a state to be avoided.
