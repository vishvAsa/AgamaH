title = "Aiyanar"

+++
Southern Indian regional **deity**. In the state  
of **Tamil Nadu** Aiyanar is an important **village deity**, generally considered to be the  
guardian of the village tank, bringer of rain,  
and protector of the village. It is likely that  
he is an indigenous deity who has been  
assimilated into the Hindu pantheon.  
Aiyanar is sometimes identified with  
**Aiyappa**, although there are some discrepancies between the two—Aiyanar is a deity  
associated with the protection of villages,  
whereas Aiyappa is associated with the  
hills, the jungle, and the hunt. For further  
information see Louis Dumont, “A Folk  
Deity of Tamil Nad: Aiyanar, the Lord,” in T.  
N. Madan (ed.), *Religion in India*, 1991.
