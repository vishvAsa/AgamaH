title = "Amba"

+++
In the Hindu epic the **Mahabharata**,  
Amba is the elder sister of **Ambika** and  
**Ambalika**. In the story she is abducted  
with her sisters by **Bhishma**, to be married to his stepbrother **Vichitravirya**.  
Ambika and Ambalika happily marry  
Vichitravirya, but when Amba confides  
that she has already given her heart to  
King Salva, Bhishma releases her to go to  
him. When Amba returns to Salva, he  
rejects her on the grounds that her virginity is suspect because she has been  
abducted by another man. Amba  
returns to Bhishma and demands that  
he marry her, since he is responsible for  
her plight. Bhishma refuses to do so  
because he has promised his father,  
King **Shantanu**, that he will never marry,  
to ensure that his stepbrothers will have  
no rivals for the throne. His refusal  
leaves Amba with no source of support,  
and she vows to get revenge. She is later  
reborn as the man-woman **Shikhandi**,  
behind whom **Arjuna** hides to shoot the  
arrows that eventually kill Bhishma.
