title = "Andal"

+++
(9th c.) The only woman among the  
**Alvars**, a group of twelve poet-saints  
who lived in southern India between  
the seventh and tenth centuries. All the  
Alvars were devotees (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Vishnu**, and their stress on passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal  
god, conveyed through hymns sung in  
the **Tamil language**, transformed and  
revitalized Hindu religious life.

Andal  
As with many female bhakti figures,  
Andal had a particularly passionate relationship with her chosen **deity**, whom  
she considered her betrothed husband.  
This deity was **Ranganatha**, a particular  
form of Vishnu resident at the temple of  
**Shrirangam** in the state of **Tamil Nadu**.  
According to legend, Andal was an  
earthly manifestation of **Vishnu’s** wife  
Bhudevi (“**Earth Goddess**”) and  
appeared as an abandoned baby to her  
foster father, **Periyalvar**, another of the  
Alvars. When she came of age, she was  
adamant that she would have no human  
husband and merged into the image of  
Ranganatha at Shrirangam.  
Although many of the details about  
her life are uncertain, Andal did  
compose two collections of poetry,  
the **Tirruppava i** and the **Nacciyar**  
**Tirumoli**, both of which are dedicated  
to Vishnu in his form as **Krishna**. For
