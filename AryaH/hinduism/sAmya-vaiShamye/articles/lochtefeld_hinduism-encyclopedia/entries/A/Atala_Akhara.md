title = "Atala Akhara"

+++
The name of a subgroup of the **Naga** class  
of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, a particular  
type of renunciant **ascetic**. The  
Dashanami Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**, organized into different  
**akharas**, or regiments, based on the  
model of an army. Until the beginning  
of the nineteenth century, the Nagas  
were known as mercenary soldiers,  
although they also had substantial trading  
interests; both of these occupations have  
largely disappeared in contemporary  
times. The Atala Akhara has traditionally  
been considered a subsidiary of the  
**Mahanirvani akhara**, at least for their  
marching order in the bathing (**snana**)  
processions for the **Kumbha Mela**. During  
the 1998 **Haridwar** Kumbha Mela, the  
Atala akhara demanded to be separated  
from the Mahanirvanis and to be allowed  
to march in their own procession; when  
this request was turned down, the Atala  
akhara boycotted the bathing processions  
in protest. The Atala akhara is one of  
the seven main Dashanami Naga  
akharas, although it is now the smallest  
and least important. All of the akharas  
have particular features that define their  
organizational identity, especially specific  
guardian **deities**; the guardian deity of the  
Atala akara is the god **Ganesh**.
