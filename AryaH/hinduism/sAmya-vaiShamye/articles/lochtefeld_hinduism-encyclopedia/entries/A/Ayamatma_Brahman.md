title = "Ayamatma Brahman"

+++
(“This Self is **Brahman**”) In the Hindu  
philosophical tradition, one of the  
“great utterances” (**mahavakyas**)  
expressing ultimate truth. The truth  
here is the identity of **atman** (the individual Self ) and Brahman (Ultimate  
Reality); this identity is the heart of the  
mystical texts called the **Upanishads**.  
Aside from their importance in a  
philosophical context as fundamental  
truths, four mahavakyas were also  
appropriated as symbols by the four  
divisions of the **Dashanami Sanyasi**  
ascetics. Each division had its own  
mahavakya, just as each had a different **Veda**, a different primary sacred  
center, and a different ascetic quality.  
Ayamatma Brahman is the mahavakya  
associated with the **Anandawara** division of the Dashanami Sanyasis.
