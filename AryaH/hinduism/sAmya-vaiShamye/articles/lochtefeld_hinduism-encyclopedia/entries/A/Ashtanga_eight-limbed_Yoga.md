System of **yoga** (religious discipline) traditionally ascribed to **Patanjali** (1st c.  
C.E.?). This author is believed to be different than the **grammarian** Patanjali,  
who wrote the **Mahabhashya** commentary on **Panini’s Sanskrit** grammar.  
Patanjali’s **Yoga Sutras** are the basis  
for the Yoga school of Indian **philosophy**, one of the **six schools**. By the early  
centuries of the common era (approximately 100–300 C.E.), the Yoga school  
had become paired with the **Samkhya**  
school. In this pairing, Samkhya provided the theoretical and metaphysical  
explanations for the bondage and liberation of the soul, while Yoga laid out the  
concrete path for ending bondage and  
gaining liberation.  
Ashtanga yoga is made up of eight  
parts, known as “limbs” (**anga**):  
restraints (**yama**), observances (**niyama**),  
bodily postures (**asana**), restraint of  
breath (**pranayama**), withdrawal of the  
senses (**pratyahara**), concentration  
(**dharana**), meditation (**dhyana**), and  
trance (**samadhi**).  
Patanjali’s system is an eight-step  
program for self-transformation, which  
begins by cultivating certain wholesome behavioral patterns (yama and  
niyama). From there one progresses to  
development and control of the mind,  
which is considered a more subtle and  
internalized practice. It culminates in a  
mystic insight that brings liberation,  
which in its original articulation is  
described as yogic aloneness (**kaivalya**)  
because Samkhya is atheistic.  
Patanjali’s path shows general similarities to another well-known program  
for self-transformation, the Buddha’s  
eightfold path. Although both Patanjali  
and the Buddha are credited with originating their particular paths, it is likely  
that they both drew from an existing  
yogic tradition and shaped it to fit their  
own assumptions.  
Although Samkhya metaphysics  
have long been discredited, the techniques of the Yoga school are still vitally  
important in modern Hindu religious  
life. Many modern Hindu movements  
stress yoga practice as a means of spiritual discipline, purification, and selfawareness. For further information see
