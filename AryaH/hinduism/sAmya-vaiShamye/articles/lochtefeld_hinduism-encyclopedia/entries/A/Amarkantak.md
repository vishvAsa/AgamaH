title = "Amarkantak"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) at the headwaters of  
the **Narmada River**, in the **Vindhya**  
**mountains** in the state of **Madhya**  
**Pradesh**. As with all the junctions of  
Indiaâ€™s sacred rivers, Amarkantak is  
held to be an especially holy place for  
religious actions. Most pilgrims go there  
to perform common pilgrimage rites  
such as **snana** (bathing) and **shraddha**  
(memorial rites), but Amarkantak is also  
one of the places mentioned in **Sanskrit**  
texts as a site for religious **suicide**.
