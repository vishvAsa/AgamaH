title = "Ahalya"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Ahalya is the wife  
of the sage **Gautama**. She is turned into  
stone by Gautama’s curse and later  
restored to life by being touched by the  
foot of the god **Rama**. Gautama’s curse is  
brought on by the actions of the god  
**Indra**, who lusts for Ahalya. One day,  
when Gautama has gone to the river to  
bathe (**snana**), Indra takes Gautama’s  
form and goes to Ahalya in a bid to make  
love to her. Accounts differ on whether  
Ahalya is aware of her lover’s identity—in  
some she is flattered by Indra’s attention,  
in others she is genuinely deceived.  
When Gautama discovers what has happened, he curses Ahalya to become a  
stone and Indra to have a thousand vaginas on his body, as a punishment for his  
lust. Gautama is later mollified into modifying the **curses**, so that Ahalya will  
remain a stone until she is touched by  
Rama’s foot, and Indra will be covered  
instead with a thousand eyes. This story  
primarily illustrates the power of the  
sages to curse even the gods, but the different versions also reveal varying  
assumptions about the nature of **women**.
