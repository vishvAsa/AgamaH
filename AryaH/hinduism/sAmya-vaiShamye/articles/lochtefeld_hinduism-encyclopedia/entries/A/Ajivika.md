title = "Ajivika"

+++
Ancient philosophical school traditionally believed to have been founded  
by **Gosala Maskariputra**, a contemporary of the Buddha. The Ajivikas were  
fatalists who believed that all things  
are inexorably predetermined by destiny (**niyati**). Since, according to this  
**philosophy**, all things are preordained, religious practice has no effect  
on oneâ€™s future lives, and in doing such  
things people are only doing what they  
are already predetermined to do. The  
Ajivikas compared the process of reincarnation (**samsara**) to a ball of string,  
which would unroll until it was done  
and then go no further. The Ajivikas  
shunned clothing and lived a strict  
**ascetic** lifestyle, believing that this was  
the lifestyle preordained for them. The  
school had a significant presence in  
southern India well into the common  
era but finally disappeared around the  
fourteenth century. For further information see Arthur Llewellyn Basham,
