In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of  
the sage **Kashyapa**, who also married  
9  
Aditi  
Aditi’s twelve sisters and through them  
begat all living creatures. Aditi is first  
mentioned in the **Rg Veda**, where she is  
one of the few female figures, although a  
minor one. The epic **Mahabharata**  
describes her as giving **birth** to twelve  
divine **sons**, the **Adityas**: Dhata,  
Aryama, Mitra, Shakra (**Indra**), **Varuna**,  
Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan (**Surya**),  
**Pushan**, Savitr (**Surya**), **Tvashtr**, and  
**Vishnu**. Both Hindu epics, the  
*Mahabharata* and the **Ramayana**, also  
describe how Aditi gave birth to the  
**Vamana avatar**, that is, the “divine  
descent” of the god Vishnu, in his form  
as a dwarf.
