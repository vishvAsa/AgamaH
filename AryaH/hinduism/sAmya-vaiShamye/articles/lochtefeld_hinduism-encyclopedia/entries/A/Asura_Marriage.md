title = "Asura Marriage"

+++
One of the eight ways to perform a marriage recognized in the **Dharma Shastras**,  
the treatises on religious duty (**dharma**).  
It is named after the asuras, a class of  
powerful divine beings whose interests  
are often at odds with those of the  
gods (**deva**); thus, the name carries an  
unfavorable connotation.  
An asura marriage takes place when a  
man gives money to the bride’s family and  
the bride herself. This is one of the four

Asthi-Sanchayana  
In the asthi-visarjana funeral ceremony, after cremation  
the remains of a body are gathered and immersed in sacred water.  
reprehensible (**aprashasta**) forms of marriage because of the connotation that the  
bride is being sold, yet like all the other  
reprehensible forms, it is deemed to create  
a valid marriage.  
Despite this general disapproval, it is  
one of the two classical forms that is still  
practiced (the other being the **Brahma**  
**marriage**), although because of the  
stigma attached to the implication of  
selling one’s child, it is only done by  
people who are either very poor or of very  
low social status. See also **marriage, eight**
