(“bringing near”) In Indian drama, the  
general name given to acting. Its ultimate purpose is to convey an emotion  
through a look or **gesture** and thus  
“bring” it to the audience. In Indian  
**dance**, this term refers to a piece in  
which the dancer acts out a story, with  
the aim to convey to the viewers the  
emotions of her character. Particularly  
with Indian dance, this sort of acting is  
not mere artistry, however refined, but  
carries explicit religious meaning. Not  
only is the story’s content often drawn  
from religious literature, but most  
Indian dance forms were first performed in temples as entertainment  
for the resident **deity**.
