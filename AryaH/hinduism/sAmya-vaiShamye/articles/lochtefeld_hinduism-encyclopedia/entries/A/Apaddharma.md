title = "Apaddharma"

+++
Religious protocol that comes into effect  
in times of distress, disturbance, natural  
disaster, or social deterioration. The  
practical effect of apaddharma is to suspend most of the normal social rules,  
particularly those governing interaction  
and **commensality** between different  
social subgroups (**jatis**). In ordinary circumstances these rules are affected by  
concepts of **purity**, impurity (**ashaucha**),  
and relative social status.  
The underlying message here is  
that the preservation of life is more  
important than such rules, and that  
they can be broken to save a lifeâ€”as in  
the case of escaping a **fire** or flood, in  
which the usual concerns about physical contact with lower-status people  
are suspended.
