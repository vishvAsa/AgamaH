title = "Aranya Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, **ascetics** who  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**. The  
Dashanamis were supposedly established by the ninth-century philosopher **Shankaracharya** in an effort to  
49  
Aranya Dashanami  
create a corps of learned men who  
could help to revitalize Hindu life.  
Each of the divisions is designated  
by a different name—in this case,  
aranya (“forest”). Upon **initiation**,  
new members are given this name  
as a surname to their new ascetic  
names, thus allowing for immediate  
group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten “named” divisions are  
divided into four larger organizational  
groups. Each group has its headquarters in one of the four monastic  
centers (**maths**) also established  
by Shankaracharya. The Aranya  
Dashanamis belong to the **Bhogawara**  
group, which is affiliated with the  
**Govardhan Math** in the city of **Puri**,  
on the Bay of Bengal.
