title = "Anant Chaturdashi"

+++
Festival falling on the fourteenth **day**  
(chaturdashi) of the bright (waxing) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September). This festival falls  
during the four-month period when the  
**deity Vishnu** is believed to be sleeping  
on **Shesha**, his serpent couch, while his  
wife **Lakshmi** massages his feet. The  
festival itself is named after Shesha, one  
of whose epithets is Anant (“endless”).  
On this day, devotees (**bhakta**) of Vishnu  
should **worship** and meditate on this  
particular image of Vishnu, with Shesha  
and Lakshmi.  
Before beginning worship, devotees tie  
onto their forearm a string dipped in  
turmeric, an eastern Indian spice, in  
which fourteen knots have been made.  
Each of these elements is symbolic: The  
string is a symbol of Shesha, the color yellow is associated with Vishnu, and the  
fourteen knots signify the fourteenth day.  
Aside from worshiping Vishnu,  
devotees should also fast (**upavasa**)  
on this day. Carefully observing the  
requirements for this festival is believed to  
ensure prosperity and freedom from exile.  
According to mythic tradition, keeping  
this vow enables the five **Pandava**  
brothers, the heroes of the epic  
**Mahabharata**, to escape from exile and  
regain their kingdom.
