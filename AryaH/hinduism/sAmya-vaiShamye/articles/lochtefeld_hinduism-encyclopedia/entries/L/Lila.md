(“play”) A word whose broad literal  
meaning denotes any sort of play, game,  
or sport, but which in a theological context conveys a fundamental assumption  
about how God interacts with the world.  
According to this notion, the supreme  
**deity** engages in **creation** not from any  
sense of need, but for the sheer enjoyment and entertainment gained from  
creating and taking part in the world.  
This is particularly true for the god  
**Vishnu**, especially in his manifestations  
as **Rama** and **Krishna**. In this understanding, all divine interactions  
between God and his devotees (**bhakta**)  
are undertaken in this spirit of play,  
although in their ignorance human  
beings may not recognize the true  
nature of this encounter. Final liberation  
of the soul (**moksha**) comes when the  
devotee recognizes the true nature of  
this encounter, since after that moment  
of realization one’s entire life is a series  
of playful interactions with God himself.  
One of the ways that contemporary  
devotees strive to enter Rama’s and  
Krishna’s divine world is through dramas that are themselves known as lilas.  
These lilas can be attended for entertainment, but viewing them can also be  
a deeply serious religious act. When  
child actors portraying the deities are in  
costume and in character, they are considered manifestations of the deities  
themselves. For ardent devotees, viewing these lilas is an avenue for gaining  
God’s **grace**, and an entry-point into a  
privileged, divine world. For an excellent  
consideration of how Krishna’s entire  
life is considered as play, see David R.  
Kinsley, *The Sword and the Flute*, 1975;  
for a description of the Krishna lilas, see  
John Stratton Hawley, *At Play with*  
*Krishna*, 1981; and Anaradha Kapur,  
*Actors*, *Pilgrims*, *Kings*, *and Gods*, 1990.
