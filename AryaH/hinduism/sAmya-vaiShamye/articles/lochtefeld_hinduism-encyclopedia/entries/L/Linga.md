(“mark,” “sign”) Aside from the word’s  
literal meaning as any emblematic sign,  
linga is also the name for the pillarshaped form of the god **Shiva**.  
Representing Shiva as the power of generation itself, from which men and  
women derive their procreative force,  
the linga is sometimes simplistically  
called a “phallic” symbol. An equally  
important part of the linga’s image is the  
base (**pitha**) in which the shaft is placed,  
a base which represents the female  
organs of generation. The **Gudimallam**  
linga, the oldest known image of Shiva  
in this form, shows him as male and  
female, transcending the most basic  
defining factor of human identity.
