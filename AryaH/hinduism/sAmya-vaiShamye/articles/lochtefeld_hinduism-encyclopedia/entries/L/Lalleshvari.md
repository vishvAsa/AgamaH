+++
(14th c.) Devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saint  
also known as Lal Ded, who is one of the  
most popular poets in **Kashmir**.  
Lalleshvari was a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**; her songs focus on her  
devotion to him. Like many other  
female devotional exemplars, she had a  
difficult time integrating her marriage  
with her commitment to her chosen  
**deity**. According to tradition, her motherin-law treated her quite cruelly. Her  
husband is described as an unfeeling  
man who neither objected to the abuse  
nor comforted his wife. After about  
twelve years of suffering she left home to  
wander as a religious seeker. To symbolize her renunciation of all attachments  
and earthly values, including feminine  
modesty, Lalleshvari wandered nude.  
During her wanderings she composed  
and sang songs of devotion to Shiva,  
which are still popular today.
