title = "Love Marriage"

+++
In modern India, the name given to a  
marriage fixed by the bride and groom  
themselves, rather than an **arranged**  
**marriage** fixed by parents or guardians.  
Although Western romantic notions  
consider a love marriage the preferred  
method, many Hindus consider love  
marriages suspect. Love marriages carry  
the stigma of rebellionâ€”children usurping the role traditionally played by their  
parents. It is sometimes thought to present the danger of inter-**caste** marriage  
and the likelihood that the marriage will  
be rooted in lust or infatuation, thus  
rendering it potentially unstable. The  
family is considered the foundation of  
society; anything undermining its stability is viewed quite dimly. Love marriages are becoming more common  
and accepted among modern Hindus,  
especially in the larger urban areas.  
Arranged marriages, however, remain  
far more common.
