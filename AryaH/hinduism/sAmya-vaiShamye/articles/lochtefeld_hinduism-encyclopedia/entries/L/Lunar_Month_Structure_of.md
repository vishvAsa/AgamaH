+++
Hindu festivals are determined according to a lunar **calendar**, in which a year  
is made of twelve lunar months. The  
lunar month is divided into two halves,  
each of which has fifteen **days**. In northern India the lunar month begins with  
the dark (krishna) half—when the **moon**  
is waning. This phase lasts fifteen days,  
ending with the **new moon**. This is followed by the light (shukla) half of the  
month—when the moon is waxing. This  
phase lasts fifteen days, ending with the  
**full moon**. The day after the full moon is  
the first day of the next lunar month,  
and so on. Any given lunar day is designated by the name of the month, the  
half (light or dark), and the lunar day (1  
to 15). In southern India the pattern is  
reversed, with the lunar month starting  
with the light half and ending on the  
new moon.  
The lunar month, as with all Hindu  
conceptions of time, represents changing times of **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness**, peaks and valleys marking  
times that are more or less propitious.  
The full moon, with its associations of  
fullness, abundance, and light, is always  
auspicious. It is believed that religious  
rites performed on this day generate as  
much merit as those performed for an  
entire month. The new moon, with its  
associations of darkness and emptiness,  
is a more ambiguous time. At times the

new moon can be highly auspicious, as  
on the occasion of a **Somavati**  
**Amavasya** (new moon falling on  
**Monday**). Several major festivals (such  
as **Diwali**) fall on the new moon. Despite  
this, the new moon is less auspicious  
than the full moon. Within each fortnight various days are also associated  
with particular **deities**, and their devotees (**bhakta**) often do particular rites on  
those days: The eleventh day (**ekadashi**)  
is dedicated to the god **Vishnu**, the  
eighth day (ashtami) to the **Goddess**, the  
evening of the thirteenth day (trayodashi) and the fourteenth to the god  
**Shiva**, and the fourth day (chaturthi) to  
the god **Ganesh**.  
As mentioned earlier, the lunar calendar is the basis for almost all Hindu  
holidays. To correct the discrepancy  
between the lunar and solar year (about  
eleven days), and thus keep these festivals at about the same time every year,  
an **intercalary month** is inserted every  
21⁄2 years. Although this extra month  
keeps the calendar in balance, it is considered highly inauspicious, perhaps  
because it is an unusual occurrence.  
During this month people take normal  
precautions to protect themselves during inauspicious times—basically  
putting off any new activities until the  
month is over, and propitiating protective deities until the end of the month.
