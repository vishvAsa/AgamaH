(“good fortune,” “prosperity”) Hindu  
**goddess** and wife of the god **Vishnu**.  
According to tradition, Lakshmi is created  
when the ocean of milk is churned to  
yield the nectar of immortality. Just as  
butter is the refined essence of milk, so  
Lakshmi is the refined essence of the  
primordial ocean, representing all the  
best things that come from it. Lakshmi is  
associated with wealth, good fortune,  
and prosperity, and is considered the  
embodiment of all these things. Images  
of Lakshmi usually depict her with the  
lotus and the **elephant**, both of which  
are associated with good fortune. Many  
images show gold coins falling from her  
hands, symbolizing wealth.  
These potent associations make  
Lakshmi an extremely important force  
in Hindu life. Lakshmi exercises her  
power by her mere presence—when she  
comes, she brings prosperity and good  
fortune; when she leaves, these benefits  
leave with her. Given Lakshmi’s power,  
people are understandably eager to  
please her, especially since she has the  
reputation for being capricious and fickle  
in her relationships with human  
beings—a reputation that reflects a realistic appraisal of life’s vicissitudes.  
Lakshmi’s capriciousness and her reputation for being somewhat spiteful make  
people extremely careful in their dealings with her, to avoid insulting her,  
even if unintentionally.  
Lakshmi’s primary annual festival is  
**Diwali**, when she is believed to roam the  
earth. People spend the days before  
Diwali cleaning, repairing, and whitewashing their homes, making them

Lakshmi  
Thirteenth-century sculpture of the goddess  
Lakshmi. She is considered the embodiment of  
wealth, prosperity, and fortune.  
suitable for welcoming the goddess. On  
the evening of Diwali, people open all  
their doors and windows (to facilitate  
her entry) and place lights on their windowsills and balcony ledges to invite her  
in. **Gambling** is a common practice during Diwali. Gambling is usually condemned as a pernicious habit, but  
during Diwali it reaffirms the connection between money and Lakshmi—  
here in her guise as Lady Luck.  
Despite her capricious relationships  
with human beings, Lakshmi is considered to be the model wife, particularly in  
her devotion and subordination to her  
husband. When Lakshmi and Vishnu  
appear together, she is significantly  
smaller, signifying her subordinate status. Another common image of the couple shows Lakshmi massaging Vishnu’s  
feet, and thus her wifely subordination.  
Lakshmi is not only the model for  
human wives but is also believed to be  
incarnate in each of them. Married  
**women** are believed to embody the  
good fortune of the household. It is generally accepted that households in  
which they are not honored will never  
be prosperous. For more information on
