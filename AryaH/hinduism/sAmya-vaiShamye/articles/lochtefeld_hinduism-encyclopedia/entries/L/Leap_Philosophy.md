(“ajativada”) Leap philosophy affirms  
that one can attain complete freedom  
from bondage—which in the Indian  
context is identified as the end of reincarnation (**samsara**) and final liberation  
of the soul (**moksha**)—but such freedom cannot be gained by a precisely  
specified sequence of causes and  
effects. Since gaining freedom is not a  
matter of cause and effect, there is no  
way to stimulate or influence this  
process through one’s actions. Leap  
philosophers tend to denigrate the  
effectiveness of ritual action as a way to  
gain final liberation, except as a  
preparatory phase, stressing that  
liberation comes only through gaining  
inner realization. **Sureshvara** and  
**Shankaracharya**, members of the  
**Advaita Vedanta** school, dismiss ritual  
action, except as preparation for wisdom. Both philosophers believe that  
release from bondage comes through  
insight gained in a moment of realization, which radically and permanently  
shifts one’s perspective on the world.
