title = "Lakshmidhara"

+++
(ca. mid-12th c.) Scholar, commentator,  
and author of the **Kalpataru**, one of the  
earliest examples of commentary literature known as **nibandhas** (“collections”). The nibandhas were compendia  
of Hindu lore, compiling themes from  
the **Vedas**, **dharma literature**, **puranas**,  
and other authoritative religious texts,  
into a single volume. Each of the  
*Kalpataru*’s fourteen volumes is devoted  
to a particular aspect of Hindu life, such  
as daily practice, **worship**, gift-giving,  
vows, pilgrimage, penances (**prayashchitta**), purification, and liberation  
(**moksha**). As one of the earliest nibandhas, the *Kalpataru* served as a model for  
later writers. Lakshmidhara’s work is  
unusual in that he uses very few sources  
for his work—primarily the epic  
**Mahabharata**, and a few of the sectarian compendia known as puranas.  
Unlike later commentators, he does not  
cite the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu religious texts, or the prescriptions found in  
the dharma literature. His text consists  
almost solely of excerpted passages,  
with very little commentary of his own,  
whereas later nibandha writers often  
give voluminous explanations.
