Traditional Indian society was modeled  
as a collection of **endogamous** subgroups (in which marriage is decreed by  
law to occur only between members of  
the same group) known as **jatis** (“birth”).  
The jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
391  
Lohar  
group had a monopoly. The Lohars’  
hereditary occupation was blacksmithing and iron working.
