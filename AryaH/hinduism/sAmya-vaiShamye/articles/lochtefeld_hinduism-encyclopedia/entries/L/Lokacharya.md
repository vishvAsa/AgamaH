+++
(ca. early 14th c.) Religious leader also  
known as Pillai Lokacharya, the founder  
of the **Tengalai** branch of the  
**Shrivaishnava** religious community.  
The Shrivaishnavas are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Vishnu**. The Tengalais  
have no faith in human capacities,  
emphasizing the need for the devoteeâ€™s  
absolute surrender to the **grace** of God,  
which alone will save the devotee.
