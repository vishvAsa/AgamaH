title = "Lakshmibai"

+++
(d. 1858) Queen of the small kingdom of  
Jhansi in the southern part of the state of  
**Uttar Pradesh** and a leader in the 1857  
struggle against the British, known as  
the “Mutiny” or the “First War of Indian  
Independence.” Lakshmibai’s kingdom  
was the victim of expanding British  
power. The British colonial government  
had pronounced the “doctrine of lapse”  
edict, annexing any kingdom in which  
the ruler had died heirless. Lakshmibai’s  
husband died in 1853. Although he had  
adopted a son just before his death, the  
British refused to recognize the **adoption** and sought to annex the kingdom.  
Lakshmibai was one of the leaders during  
the 1857 rebellion; she died in battle.  
She was eulogized as a patriot and proponent of Indian independence, and  
because of her power and martial ability,  
she is considered a manifestation of the  
powerful **goddess Durga**.
