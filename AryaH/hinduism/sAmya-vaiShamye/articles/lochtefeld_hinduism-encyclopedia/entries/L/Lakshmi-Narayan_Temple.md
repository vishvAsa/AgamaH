title = "Lakshmi-Narayan Temple"

+++
A modern temple in Delhi just west of  
Connaught Place. It was built in 1938 by  
**Ghanshyamdas Birla**, the patriarch of a  
prominent industrialist family. Although  
the temple is dedicated to the god  
**Vishnu** and his consort **Lakshmi**, it is  
more commonly called the “Birla temple” after its patron. Since Lakshmi is  
considered the bestower of wealth, and  
the temple was built by a businessman,  
this dedication is hardly surprising.  
Aside from his religious endowments,  
Ghanshyamdas Birla was also the major  
386  
Lakshmibai  
financial support behind the Indian  
National Congress, the political party  
led by **Mohandas Gandhi** which struggled to gain Indian independence. Since  
the day it was built the temple has been  
open to people of all castes and communities, upholding the denial of untouchability that was one of Gandhi’s most  
important crusades.
