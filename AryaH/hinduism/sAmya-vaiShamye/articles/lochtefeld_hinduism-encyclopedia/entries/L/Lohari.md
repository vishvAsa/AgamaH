Festival falling on the night before  
**Makara Sankranti**, the day when the  
sun moves into the zodiological sign of  
Capricorn, which almost always falls on  
January 14. The central focus of this festival is a large bonfire. Celebrants collect  
fuel for weeks beforehand, lighting the  
fire on the evening of the festival. People  
**dance**, sing, and walk around the fire,  
giving the fire **offerings** of sweets, fried  
snacks, and peanuts; these same items  
are also given to those present as **prasad**  
or sanctified food.  
Lohari is a seasonal festival, marking  
the passing of the coldest period of the  
winter and anticipating the return of  
warmer weather, symbolized by the fire.  
This festival is celebrated in the **Punjab**  
and in northern India where Punjabis  
have settled. This festival also serves as a  
public display recognizing some change  
within the family. Families that have  
recorded marriages or births in the past  
year celebrate with particular fervor,  
whereas families in which a person has  
died usually refrain.
