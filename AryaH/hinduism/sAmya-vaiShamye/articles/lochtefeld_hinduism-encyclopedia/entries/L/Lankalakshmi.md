title = "Lankalakshmi"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Lankalakshmi is the  
name of the guardian **deity** of **Lanka**,  
the **demon**-king **Ravana’s** capital city.  
Lankalakshmi is also the rebirth of the  
**goddess** Vijayalakshmi, who has been  
cursed by the god **Brahma** to serve as  
Lanka’s guardian deity. The **curse** will  
last until an intruder to the city manages  
to defeat her, foretelling the fall of  
Ravana. This defeat comes with the  
arrival of the monkey-god **Hanuman**,  
who leaps across the ocean in search of  
the goddess **Sita**, whom Ravana has kidnapped. Lankalakshmi recognizes  
Hanuman as an intruder and attacks  
him, fulfilling her duty as a guardian  
deity. Hanuman knocks her flat with a  
powerful blow, breaking the curse and  
signalling Ravana’s fall.
