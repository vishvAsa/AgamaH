In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Lanka is the kingdom  
of the **demon**-king **Ravana**. Although  
Lanka is sometimes identified with the  
modern island of **Sri Lanka**, and though  
southern Indian sites such as  
**Rameshvaram** have been identified  
with events in the *Ramayana*, the epicâ€™s  
descriptions should be read as mythic  
and narrative accounts, rather than a  
geographical primer. The divine architect **Vishvakarma** had originally built  
Lanka for **Kubera** the minor **deity**, but  
387  
Lanka  
Kubera had been dispossessed by  
Ravana and his brothers.
