title = "Lakshman Jhula"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) along the **Ganges** in  
the Tehri district of the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**, roughly five miles upriver from  
the city of **Rishikesh**. The site takes its  
present name from a swinging footbridge (jhula) that spans the Ganges.  
The local charter myth describes  
Lakshman Jhula as the place where  
**Rama** and **Lakshmana** live as ascetics  
late in their lives, atoning for the sin of  
brahminicide, which they incurred by  
killing **Ravana** and his brothers (who are  
considered **brahmin demons**). Today,  
the area is famous for the Svargashrama  
of **Swami Shivananda**, part of a network  
of **ashrams** along its banks.
