title = "Lakshmana"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Lakshmana is one of  
King **Dasharatha’s** sons by his wife  
**Sumitra**, and the younger half-brother  
of **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist.  
Throughout the *Ramayana* Lakshmana  
is the model younger brother, existing  
only to serve and support Rama. When  
Rama is banished to the forest for fourteen years, Lakshmana follows him like  
a shadow for the entire time: first living  
as a forest **ascetic**, searching for Rama’s  
kidnapped wife **Sita**, then fighting heroically in the battle with **Ravana’s** army;  
finally he returns to serve Rama at his  
court in **Ayodhya**.  
Many of the characters in the  
*Ramayana* are paradigms for Indian cultural values. Lakshmana (as with his  
brother **Bharata**) symbolizes the ideal  
younger brother. In northern India,  
brothers are the heart of the joint family.  
They remain at home, whereas after  
marriage, sisters live in their marital  
families. The eldest brother in every  
generation eventually becomes the head  
of the joint family. Carrying primary  
authority and responsibility for the family as a whole, the eldest cannot succeed  
without the cooperation of his younger  
brothers who must acknowledge and  
support his authority. In his service to  
Rama and his complete disregard for his  
own needs, Lakshmana is a dutiful  
younger brother.  
Despite his bravery, valor, and total  
loyalty to Rama, Lakshmana is far from  
perfect. He lacks Rama’s judgment and  
forbearance, and tends to act before he  
thinks. For example, when Bharata pursues the two brothers after they have  
gone into exile, Lakshmana leaps to the  
conclusion that Bharata is seizing the  
opportunity to kill them, to clear his  
own way to the throne. Lakshmana prepares to attack Bharata, but Rama’s  
reasoning forestalls a potential tragedy.

Lakshmana’s most serious lapse of judgment is with **Shurpanakha**, a **demon**  
princess and sister to Ravana, the  
demon-king of **Lanka**. When she makes  
amorous advances toward Lakshmana,  
he first ridicules her and then mutilates  
her. Ravana kidnaps Rama’s wife, Sita, to  
gain a measure of revenge against the  
brothers. Like all of the characters in the  
*Ramayana*, Lakshmana is neither good  
nor evil—he has many virtues, but also  
some very real flaws.
