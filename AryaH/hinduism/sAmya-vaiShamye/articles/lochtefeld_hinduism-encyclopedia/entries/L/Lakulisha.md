title = "Lakulisha"

+++
(2nd c.?) Legendary founder of the  
**Pashupata** religious community, a  
group of renunciant ascetics whose  
patron **deity** was the god **Shiva**.  
Lakulisha appears to have been an  
important influence in the development  
of other Shaivite ascetics, such as the  
**Kapalikas** and the **Kalamukhas**. He has  
been identified as an incarnation of  
**Shiva**. Many statues have been identified as Lakulishaâ€™s image; he is portrayed  
as a naked **yogi** with a staff in one hand  
and a citron in the other, with penis  
erect, either standing or sitting in the  
lotus posture (**padmasana**). For further  
information see David Lorenzen, *The*  
*Kapalikas and the Kalamukhas*, 1972.
