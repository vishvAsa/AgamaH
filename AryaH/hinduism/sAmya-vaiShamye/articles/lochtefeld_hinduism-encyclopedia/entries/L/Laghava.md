(“simplicity”) In Indian logic, one of the  
general principles in constructing and  
pursuing an argument. According to the  
principle of “simplicity,” when one is  
presented with two equally plausible  
theories, one should choose the theory  
that is easier to understand and makes  
the fewest assumptions. The primary  
criterion in evaluating an argument  
is the validity of the argument itself.  
Only after this has been satisfied  
may one raise objections based on complexity or simplicity.
