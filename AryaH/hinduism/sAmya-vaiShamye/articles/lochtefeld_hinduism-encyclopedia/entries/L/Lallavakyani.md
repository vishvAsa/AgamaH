(“Lalla’s Sayings”) Corpus of poetry  
ascribed to the Kashmiri poet-saint  
**Lalleshvari**, a devotee (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Shiva**. The poems in this collection  
allude to the difficult circumstances of  
her early life, and the domestic problems that induced her to leave her marital home. They also describe her  
encompassing devotion to Shiva, whom  
she describes as the only true source of  
happiness. These poems have been  
translated into English, but all the editions are quite old: see Sir George  
Grierson and Lionel D. Barnett, *Lalla*  
*Vakyani*, 1920; and R. C. Temple, *The*  
*Word of Lalla*, *the Prophetess*, 1924.
