title = "Lalitaditya"

+++
(8th c.) One of the few kings of the  
**Kashmir** region who was able to affect  
the politics of the northern Indian plain,  
partially due to the fragmented state of  
the Hindu kingdoms there. Lalitadityaâ€™s  
armies pushed into the **Ganges** River  
valley, successfully halting the advance  
of the Arab forces in the **Punjab** region.  
His successors were unable to retain  
these gains.
