title = "Lingayat"

+++
**Kannada**-speaking religious community  
whose members are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**, and who mainly live in  
the southern Indian state of **Karnataka**.  
Lingayat roots began in the seventh century with the **Nayanar** poet-saints in  
**Tamil Nadu** state, migrating northward.  
The community’s founder was the poetsaint **Basavanna**; others included  
390  
Linga  
The Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneshvar. Built in the eleventh century,  
the temple exemplifies the Orissan branch of the Nagara architectural style.  
**Allama Prabhu** and **Mahadeviyakka**.  
The community’s founding members  
were driven by the hunger for God and  
were impatient with anything that got in  
its way—**worship** of images, **caste** distinctions, or the demands of family life.  
These early influences have continued  
to shape Lingayat culture. Lingayats do  
not use images in their worship. The  
only symbol they use is the **linga** of  
Shiva, which all Lingayats wear as a sign  
of membership in the community. The  
Lingayats have also largely retained  
their founders’ egalitarian principles.  
Although the community eschews caste  
distinctions, there are higher-status  
priestly families known as **jangamas**,  
from whom the celibate monks known  
as viraktas are often drawn. In practice,  
this egalitarian emphasis has made the  
entire Lingayat community a **jati**, one of  
the **endogamous** social subgroups that  
make up larger Indian society; the difference is that the Lingayats are not  
marked by their occupation, but by their  
membership in a particular religious  
community. The Lingayats are the dominant community in modern Karnataka,  
both in terms of traditional landholding  
patterns and in their control over  
regional politics. For further information see A. K. Ramanujan, *Speaking of*
