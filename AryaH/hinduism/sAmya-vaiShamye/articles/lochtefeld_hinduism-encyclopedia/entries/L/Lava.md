In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Lava is one of the  
twin **sons** of **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist. After their mother, **Sita**, has been  
cast into exile at the **ashram** of the sage  
**Valmiki**, Lava is born in the usual manner. His brother, **Kusha**, is magically  
created by Valmiki out of kusha grass.  
Later, Lava and Kusha go with Valmiki  
to Rama’s court in **Ayodhya**. It is in  
Rama’s court that they first recite the  
epic poem composed by Valmiki, the  
*Ramayana*. After Rama gives up his  
throne, he divides his kingdom between  
Lava and Kusha.
