title = "Leather"

+++
Considered an impure substance by  
many traditional Hindus, because it is  
the product of a dead animal. They  
believe that leather is an appropriate  
material for shoes, however, because the  
feet are deemed the lowest and most  
impure part of the body. For this reason,  
many people put on their shoes by slipping their feet into them without using  
their hands, thus avoiding touching the  
leather with a higher part of the body.  
Leather’s associations with ritual impurity (**ashaucha**) make it inappropriate  
for other sorts of clothing—clothing  
which the hot Indian climate would render problematic—although now it is  
sometimes used for handbags and briefcases. In earlier times people who  
wished to avoid leather would wear  
wooden clogs instead; in modern times,  
footwear options also include plastic,  
rubber, and canvas.
