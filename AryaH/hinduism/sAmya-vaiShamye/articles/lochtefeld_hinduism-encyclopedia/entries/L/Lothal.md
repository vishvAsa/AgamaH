title = "Lothal"

+++
Ancient city and archeological site located  
near the Gulf of Cambay in the modern  
state of **Gujarat**. Lothal was one of the  
cities of the **Indus Valley civilization**, a  
highly developed urban culture that  
flourished in the Indus Valley region  
between the fourth and third millennia  
B.C.E. Lothal was a port city, although  
because of silting, the present site is now  
well inland. The size of the harbor indicates that it was a prominent port.  
Archaeological evidence suggests that  
Lothal continued to flourish for nearly  
500 years after the decline of **Harappa**  
and **Mohenjo-Daro**, the two largest  
cities of the Indus Valley civilization.
