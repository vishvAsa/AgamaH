title = "Liquor"

+++
Condemned by the traditional Hindus,  
although attitudes differ based on the  
type of liquor consumed. Consuming  
beer, wine, and distilled spirits (“foreign  
liquor”) carries the stigma of adopting  
“foreign” Western values; whereas consuming undistilled, fermented beverages such as “country liquor” and **toddy**  
carry the taint of low-class behavior.  
Patterns of drinking tend to reflect and  
reinforce these negative attitudes. Since  
liquor is taboo in polite society, people  
who drink will often finish the bottle in  
one sitting and become intoxicated,  
thus “proving” that there is no such  
thing as responsible drinking.  
Despite the general cultural disapproval, there are a few Hindu temples  
where liquor is the everyday **offering** to  
the **deity**. The worshipers also receive  
liquor as **prasad**, the sanctified food or  
drink that carries the deity’s blessing.  
Alcohol has also been incorporated into  
religious rituals in certain types of  
tantric religious practice. **Tantra** is a  
secret ritual-based religious tradition,  
based on the belief that there is an ultimate unity of everything that exists.  
From a tantric perspective, to affirm  
that the entire universe is one principle means that the adept must reject  
all concepts based on dualistic thinking. One way to do this is to partake of  
the “Five Forbidden Things” (**panchamakara**), consciously breaking societal norms forbidding consumption of  
**intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and  
illicit sexuality. This is always done within a carefully defined ritual setting, in a  
conscious effort to sacralize what is normally forbidden.
