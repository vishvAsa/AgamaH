title = "Lingaraja Temple"

+++
Largest and most important of the temples in the city of **Bhubaneshvar**, dedicated to the god **Shiva** in his aspect as  
Tribhuvaneshvar, the “Lord of the Three  
Worlds.” The temple was built in the  
eleventh century C.E., representing the  
high point of the Orissan branch of the  
**Nagara** architectural style. The temple  
building culminates in one single, highest point over the image of the temple’s  
primary **deity**, with shorter subsidiary  
buildings leading up to it. The Lingaraja  
temple shows all the elements of the  
Orissan style: a beehive-shaped tower  
(**deul**) soaring 120 feet high, fronted by a  
dance hall (**natamandira**), traditionally  
used for performances, an entrance hall  
(**jagamohan**), and an outer entrance  
hall (**bhogamandapa**).
