title = "Lajpat Rai, Lala"

+++
(1865–1928) Lawyer, reformer, and militant Hindu nationalist. Born to a humble Punjabi family, Lajpat Rai became  
wealthy from his legal work. By the age  
of thirty-five, he was able to devote all of  
his earnings to public work. He joined  
the **Arya Samaj** while still in his teens  
and supported Lahore’s Dayanand  
Anglo-Vedic College, which was founded  
in 1889. At the turn of the century he was  
active in a variety of social and educational endeavors. He eventually entered  
politics. He actively resisted British rule,  
which brought him several prison terms.  
Unlike many of his contemporaries, he  
refused to advocate violence. His commitment to politics ultimately cost him  
his life; he died from injuries sustained  
in a beating by the police while leading a  
demonstration in Lahore.
