title = "Lion"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a lion or a **tiger** is  
the animal vehicle of the Mother  
**Goddess**, as in her manifestation as the  
goddess **Durga**. Modern iconography  
shows the Goddess riding either of these  
animals, with no seeming difference  
between them, perhaps reflecting the  
fact that the **Hindi** word “sher” can refer  
to either the lion or the tiger. The fact  
that the Goddess rides such a dangerous  
animal is clearly a symbol of her power  
and capacity. In her mythology these  
animals are often described as her allies,  
engaging in battle at her command.
