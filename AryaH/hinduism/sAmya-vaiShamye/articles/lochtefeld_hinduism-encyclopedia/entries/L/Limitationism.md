Theory explaining diversity used by later  
branches of the **Advaita Vedanta** philosophical school, one of the “**six schools**”  
of classical Hindu **philosophy**. This  
school of thought upholds monism—  
the belief that a single Ultimate Reality  
known as **Brahman** lies behind all  
things, and that all things are merely differing forms of that reality. Proponents  
claim that reality is non-dual (**advaita**),  
that is, all things are nothing but the  
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite  
the appearance of difference and diversity. For the Advaitins, the assumption of  
diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate nature of  
things, and therefore is a manifestation  
of **avidya**. Although often translated as  
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood  
as the lack of genuine understanding,  
ultimately causing human beings to be  
trapped in karmic bondage, reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
Theoretically, if avidya is a defect that  
resides within an individual, and if  
many individuals can be afflicted with  
avidya at once, is there one avidya that  
afflicts everyone, or are there many separate avidyas? Limitationism asserts  
that there is a single avidya, afflicting  
many people at once. The theory proposes that avidya, in a person, is like the  
quality of color in an object. The color  
blue may be a single property of two  
coexisting objects; each instance of the  
color blue does not use up a finite “blueness” in the world. In the same way,  
many people may possess the single  
property of avidya.
