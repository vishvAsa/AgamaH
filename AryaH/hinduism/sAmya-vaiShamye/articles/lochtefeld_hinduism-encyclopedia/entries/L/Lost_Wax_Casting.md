title = "Lost Wax Casting"

+++
A method of metal-casting used to create the southern Indian **bronzes** during  
the **Chola dynasty** (9thâ€“14th c.). The  
artisan makes a wax image of the statue,  
then covers the wax with layers of clay.  
The clay is fired and the wax vaporizes,  
leaving a clay mold into which molten  
metal is poured. Once the metal cools,  
the clay mold is broken, revealing the  
statue. Small imperfections are removed  
by hand, and the statue is polished to a  
high gloss. This casting method produces  
exquisite detail and subtlety of expression, but is extremely time-consuming  
because each wax image and clay mold  
can only be used once.
