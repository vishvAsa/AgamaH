title = "Lunar Line"

+++
One of the two great mythic lineages in  
Hindu mythology, the other being the  
**Solar Line**. Kings in the Lunar Line  
traced their descent from **Soma**, the  
**moon**, who married the daughter of  
King **Ikshvaku** of the Solar Line. Soma  
and his wife begat an illustrious group of  
progeny, including most of the principal  
characters in the **Mahabharata**, the  
later of the two great Hindu epics.
