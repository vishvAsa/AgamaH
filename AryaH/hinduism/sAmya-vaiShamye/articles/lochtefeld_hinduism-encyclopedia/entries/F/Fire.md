title = "Fire"

+++
One of the five **elements** in traditional  
Indian **cosmology**, the others being  
**earth**, **wind**, **water**, and **akasha**. In  
some philosophical schools, each of the  
elements is paired with one of the five  
senses. Fire is associated with sight,  
since the eye’s action in apprehending a  
visual object is compared to flame darting out and scorching something.  
Within the body, fire is also associated  
with digestion, which is generally conceived of as “cooking” the foods in the  
digestive system.
