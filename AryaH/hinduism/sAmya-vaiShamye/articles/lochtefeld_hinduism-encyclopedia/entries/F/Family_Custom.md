title = "Family Custom"

+++
(**kulachara**) Hindu religion is fluid  
enough that a family’s customary practices can heavily influence a person’s  
individual religious life. For example,  
family custom plays an important role  
in **worship**. The Hindu pantheon contains many different gods, and the one  
that an individual worships as “God” is  
often strongly influenced by the family’s  
practice, although other factors such as  
personal inclination can also play a role.  
Family custom also plays an important  
role in setting parameters for religious  
practice, both in everyday religious life,  
and in setting rules for performing the  
rituals of the life cycle. For example,  
many families have a customary age for  
performing the **chudakarana samskara**,  
the “tonsure” or head-**shaving** rite of  
passage that marks the definitive end of  
infancy. Some families perform this in  
the first year, others in the third, or the  
fifth, or even the seventh. Religious  
practice varies widely among families,  
although it tends to be very stable within families, since this is one of the ways  
in which families create a distinctive  
identity for themselves.
