The earliest reference to the transmigration of souls, which is found in both the  
**Brhadaranyaka Upanishad** (6.2) and  
the **Chandogya Upanishad** (5.10),  
makes a qualitative distinction between  
two different paths for the soul. The  
path to the **world of the gods** ultimately  
led to the **sun**, and the person traveling  
it did not return again; the path to the  
world of the fathers led to the **moon**,  
and the person traveling it was eventually  
reborn on **earth**. The leitmotiv running  
through all the **Upanishads** is the need  
for individual spiritual realization, and  
this is the key to getting on the path to  
the world of the gods. Those who gain  
such realization attain the final and ultimate end, whereas those who simply do  
good deeds will return to earth,  
although their good deeds will give them  
karmic benefits.
