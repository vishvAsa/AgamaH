title = "Faqir"

+++
(variant of *fakir*, from the Arabic *poor*)  
In the strictest sense of the word, this  
refers to a Muslim **ascetic**, as is hinted  
by the Arabic origin of the word.  
Colloquially, the word has been used  
much more broadly, as an appellation  
for any ascetic (witness Winston  
Churchill’s characterization of **Mohandas**  
**Gandhi** as a “half-naked faqir”). Both  
usages are still current in modern India.  
Although since the partition of India in  
1947 the word more commonly designates a Muslim, Hindu ascetics still  
describe someone who is detached from  
all things and dependent on God for  
support as a “faqir **baba**.”
