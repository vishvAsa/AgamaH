In defining the parameters for what is  
and is not a valid argument, certain  
types of arguments have been dismissed  
outright by Indian logicians, since these  
arguments are held to be based on  
invalid premises. The key flaw shared by  
these objectionable arguments is the  
fallacy known as **self-residence**, in  
which the cause and its effect are the  
same thing. Varieties of this fallacy  
include **reciprocal dependence**, a  
**vicious circle**, and an **infinite regress**.  
The presence of any of these fallacies is  
sufficient grounds to dismiss an argument as invalid.
