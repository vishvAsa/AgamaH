title = "Four Dhams"

+++
(“[divine] abodes”) Four major pilgrimage sites in the four geographical corners of India, which lay out the  
boundaries of India’s sacred geography:  
**Badrinath** in the **Himalayas**; the city of  
**Puri** in the east, on the Bay of Bengal;  
**Rameshvaram** in the south; and  
**Dwaraka** in the west. Each site is associated with one of the four **Sanyasi maths**  
all supposedly founded by the great  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**: Badrinath  
has the **Jyotir math** in the town of  
**Joshimath** (about thirty-five miles  
south of Badrinath), Puri has the  
**Govardhan math**, Dwaraka has the  
**Sharada math**, and Rameshvaram has  
the **Shringeri math** (in Shringeri). The  
first three of these maths are close to  
their associated sacred sites (**tirthas**),  
but Shringeri is about 450 miles away  
from Rameshvaram.
