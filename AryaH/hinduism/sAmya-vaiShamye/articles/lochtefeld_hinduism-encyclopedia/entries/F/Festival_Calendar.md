title = "Festival Calendar"

Since few festivals are celebrated by all  
Hindus, establishing a single festival calendar is problematic. Festival celebrations are subject to the same differing  
forces that drive the rest of Hindu life.  
On one hand, there are significant  
regional differences in the celebration of  
festivals, and on the other there are  
major sectarian variations. Some of the  
sectarian festivals may be celebrated  
within particular regions or they may be  
celebrated across the nation. It is also  
true that the general public is aware of  
most festivals—by virtue of these days  
being public holidays, or being marked

Fani, Muhsin  
on the calendar—but far fewer people  
celebrate any particular festival as a religious holiday. Finally, some holidays are  
so significant that they are celebrated by  
almost everyone, although here too  
some people will observe them with far  
greater energy. For example, although  
the **Goddess** festival known as the fall  
**Navaratri** is celebrated throughout the  
country, it is kept with particular gusto  
in Bengal, where the cult of the Mother  
Goddess is particularly important.  
With these considerations in mind,  
the festival calendar for the lunar **year** is  
given below, with the holidays given in  
order during the successive **lunar**  
**months**. The purpose in this entry is  
only to lay out the order of these festivals during the year; further details for  
the lunar months and each festival can  
be found in the individual entries.

The festival calendar is further  
complicated by the fact that the lunar  
year begins on the first **day** of the bright  
(waxing) half of the lunar month  
of Chaitra. This creates an unusual  
situation since, at least in northern  
India, the lunar months end on the  
**full moon**, making the two weeks of  
the waning moon the first half of the  
lunar month. The waning fortnight  
in Chaitra comes at the end of the lunar  
year, and the waxing fortnight that follows is the first fortnight of the following year. Thus, the month of Chaitra is  
both the first and the last month of the  
lunar year.
