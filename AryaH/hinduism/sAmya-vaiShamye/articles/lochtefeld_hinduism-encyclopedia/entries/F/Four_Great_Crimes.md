title = "Four Great Crimes"

+++
In the **dharma literature**, four actions  
are deemed such heinous offenses that  
the person performing them becomes  
an outcast from society. These four  
actions are murdering a **brahmin**  
(**brahmahatya**), stealing a brahmin’s  
gold (**steya**), drinking **liquor** (**surapana**), and **adultery** with the wife of  
one’s **guru** (**gurutalpaga**). Aside from  
expulsion from society, another indication of the gravity of these acts was that  
their penalties were so severe that they  
normally ended in death, and in some  
cases this outcome was specifically prescribed. In addition to prescribing such  
punishments for the actual offenders,  
the dharma literature also prescribed  
expulsion for anyone who knowingly  
associated with such people for a period  
longer than one **year**.
