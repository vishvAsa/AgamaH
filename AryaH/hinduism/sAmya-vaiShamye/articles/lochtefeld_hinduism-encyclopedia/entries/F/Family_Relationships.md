Hindus consider the family the basis of  
society. The idealized Hindu family is a  
multigenerational joint family, composed of elderly parents, their adult  
**sons**, and their sons’ families. The sons  
are considered the core of the family,  
since the **daughters** will live with their  
husbands’ families after marriage and  
are considered to belong to them. When  
the families become too large, or tensions between brothers develop to an  
unbearable level, these joint families  
divide into smaller households, upon  
which the general pattern continues.  
Hindu families have different names for  
all possible family relationships. These  
differing names reveal the exact nature  
of the relationship and the person’s precise relationship in the family—as one  
example, although in English the word  
“aunt” can designate the sister of either  
one’s father or one’s mother, there are  
different names for both in northern  
Indian languages. Some of this is related  
to the higher status connected with the  
father’s or the husband’s side of the family, and some of it has to do with proximity, since these relatives are more  
likely to be living with one another in a  
joint family or close by. These differences mark the lines of importance in  
Indian families, which give greater  
emphasis to the father’s side. One noteworthy term is the word for the wife’s

often serves as a term of abuse.
