One of the countries with significant  
Hindu **diaspora populations**. Indians  
were first brought to Fiji in 1879 as  
indentured laborers to work in the sugarcane fields. In the 1990s Indians comprised about 45 percent of Fijiâ€™s  
population. Despite their near parity in  
terms of population, Indians in Fiji have  
been legally relegated to a **minority** role  
and for the most part have been prohibited from owning land. The split  
between the Indian and Fijian communities became transparent in 1987, when  
a military coup ousted a Parliament  
dominated by Indians, and installed a  
native Fijian as prime minister. Because  
of these restrictions, many Indians still  
work as tenant farmers for Fijian landlords, but they also play an important  
role as shopkeepers and professionals.
