This refers to selective **abortion** of  
female fetuses, which was made possible by the advent of reliable prenatal  
sex determination technology. This  
practice is driven by the desire for **sons**  
in Hindu culture, a desire spurred by  
economic, social, and religious concerns. Selective abortions were outlawed in India in 1995.
