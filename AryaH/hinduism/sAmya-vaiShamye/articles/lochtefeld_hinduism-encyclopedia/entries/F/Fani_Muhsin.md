title = "Fani, Muhsin"

(ca. mid-17th c.) Traditionally thought  
to be the author of the **Dabistan-iMazahib** (“School of Manners”), which  
was probably written about 1665. The  
Dabistan is an invaluable outside source  
for the religious life of the times and  
gives one of the earliest descriptions of  
the Sikhs, as well as many other contemporary groups. Fani was a Persian, and a  
Parsi by birth, who came to India  
because of his intense curiosity about  
religious life, and his desire to see whatever he could. He is believed to have  
been a careful observer and relatively  
objective. He states that he had simply  
translated (into the Persian in which the  
text was written) what his friends and  
informants had told him, and the text  
seems to support this claim.
