Festival celebrated in the city of  
**Madurai** in the southern Indian state of  
**Tamil Nadu**, on the **full moon** in the  
**lunar month** of **Magh** (January–  
February). This is the birthday of King  
**Tirumalai Nayak** (r. 1623–1659), during whose reign large parts of  
Madurai’s **Minakshi** Temple was built.  
During the festival the **goddess**  
Minakshi and her consort Sundareshvara  
(an epithet of **Shiva**) are taken in procession to an artificial lake east of  
Madurai, where they are put on richly  
decorated floats and drawn back and  
forth over the lake’s waters.
