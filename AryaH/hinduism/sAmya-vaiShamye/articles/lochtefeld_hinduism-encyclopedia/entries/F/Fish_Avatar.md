title = "Fish Avatar"

+++
The first of **Vishnu’s** ten full **avatars** or  
“incarnations” on **earth**. Each avatar  
appears when the cosmos is in crisis,  
usually because of a **demon** (asura) who  
has grown disproportionately strong,  
and whose power is throwing the universe out of its natural balance.  
According to the doctrine of the avatars,  
Vishnu takes material form when the  
earth has fallen out of equilibrium, to  
destroy the source of evil and restore the  
cosmic balance.  
The tale of the fish avatar begins  
in the distant past, when the righteous  
king **Manu** discovers a small fish in the  
**water** he holds between his cupped  
hands as he performs the **tarpana** or  
water-**offering** rite for his ancestors. The  
compassionate king puts the tiny fish  
into a pot of water, but the fish soon outgrows it. As the fish keeps growing,  
Manu transfers it to larger and larger  
vessels, and finally puts the fish into the  
**Ganges**. When the fish grows too large  
for the Ganges and has to be put into the  
ocean, Manu realizes that the fish is

Depiction of the god Vishnu’s Fish avatar.  
Vishnu takes this form to protect living  
creatures from floods that engulf the earth.  
Vishnu himself, and begins to sing  
Vishnu’s praises.  
The fish then informs Manu  
that the destruction of the world is  
imminent—first through blazing fire  
that will scorch all life, then through  
floods that will turn the entire earth  
into a single cosmic sea. Vishnu informs  
Manu that the gods have built a boat  
from the **Vedas**, and directs Manu to  
collect all the creatures of the earth  
and put them on the boat for safekeeping. He promises Manu that all the  
creatures on this boat will survive the  
coming destruction, and when the  
world returns to normal with the  
advent of the **Krta Age**, Manu will be  
the ruler of the earth.  
Manu does as he has been directed,  
and when the destruction of the world is  
imminent, Vishnu appears in the form  
of a great horned fish. Manu ties the  
boat to the fish’s horn and, protected by  
Vishnu’s power, all the beings on the  
boat survive to repopulate the earth.
