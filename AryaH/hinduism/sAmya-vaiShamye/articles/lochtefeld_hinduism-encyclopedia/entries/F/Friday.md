title = "Friday"

+++
(Shukravar) The fifth **day** of the Hindu  
**week**, whose presiding **planet** is **Venus**  
(**Shukra**). Friday is also the day of  
the week dedicated to the **Goddess** and  
is thus potentially a powerfully  
auspicious day. Although the Goddess  
can be worshiped in many forms, one  
of the most popular in northern India  
is **Santoshi Ma**. **Worship** of Santoshi  
Ma has spread dramatically since its  
origin in the mid-1970s.
