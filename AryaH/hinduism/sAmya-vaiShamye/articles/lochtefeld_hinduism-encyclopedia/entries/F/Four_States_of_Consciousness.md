title = "Four States of Consciousness"

+++
A hierarchy of states of experience that  
is first outlined in the **Mandukya**  
**Upanishad**. In its description, the upanishad moves from greatest duality to  
utter nonduality; these four states are  
229  
Four States of Consciousness  
also correlated with the phonetic  
elements of the sacred sound **Om**.  
*Om* symbolizes the four states of  
consciousness and is the sum and  
quintessence of them all. The first stage  
of consciousness is waking consciousness, in which one perceives both  
subject and object; then dreaming,  
in which one’s experience is totally  
subjective; then deep sleep, in which  
(until waking) even consciousness  
of oneself as subject has been lost.  
The final state is so removed from  
human experience that it cannot be designated by language, and so is simply  
called “the fourth” (**turiya**). In the  
Mandukya Upanishad, this fourth state  
is clearly identified as the ultimate truth,  
the **atman** or inner Self, knowledge of  
which brings final liberation of the soul.
