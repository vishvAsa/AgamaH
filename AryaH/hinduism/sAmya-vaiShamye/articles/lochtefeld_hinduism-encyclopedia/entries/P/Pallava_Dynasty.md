title = "Pallava Dynasty"

+++
(6thâ€“9th c.) Southern Indian dynasty  
whose capital was at the city of  
**Kanchipuram**, and which ruled over  
much of the southern Indian peninsula  
between the sixth and ninth centuries.  
The greatest Pallava rulers were king  
**Mahendravarman** and his successors  
**Narasimhavarman I** and **II**. The reign  
of the Pallava dynasty was marked by  
the explosion of southern Indian culture: the development of Tamil literature, the devotional (**bhakti**) religious  
fervor of the groups known as the **Alvars**  
and the **Nayanars**, and the magnificent  
religious monuments at **Mahabalipuram**.  
Throughout much of its existence the  
Pallava empire carried on a running battle with the **Chalukya** and **Pandya**  
Dynasties, neither of which could prevail against it, but it was eventually  
absorbed by the next great southern  
Indian empire, the **Chola dynasty**. See  
also **Tamil language** and **Tamil epics**.
