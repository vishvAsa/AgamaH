title = "Pravahana Jaivali"

+++
A character in the **Chandogya Upanishad**,  
one of the speculative religious texts  
that form the latest stratum of the  
**Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
In the text, Pravahana Jaivali is a member of the warrior (**kshatriya**) class who  
serves as teacher to members of the  
scholarly-priestly (**brahmin**) class. His  
first students are Silaka Shalavatya and  
Caikitayana Dalbhya, then **Shvetaketu**  
Aruneya and his father **Gautama**. This is  
525  
Pravahana Jaivali  
Yoga asanas contribute to the development of pratyahara, or withdrawal from the senses.  
one of several episodes in the **Upanishads**  
in which kshatriyas instruct brahmins,  
thus inverting the accepted pattern  
that holds brahmins as religious  
authorities. These episodes reveal the  
nature of wisdom as conceived in the  
Upanishadsâ€”it is conferred, not by  
birth or social position, but by individual striving and realization.
