title = "Pandava"

+++
(“**sons** of **Pandu**”) A collective name  
for the five brothers who are the  
protagonists of the **Mahabharata**:  
**Yudhishthira**, **Arjuna**, **Bhima**, **Nakula**,  
and **Sahadeva**. Although they are  
named after king Pandu, none are actually his son, since Pandu has been  
cursed to die the moment he holds his  
wife in amorous embrace. Rather, they  
are magically conceived through a  
**mantra** given by the sage **Durvasas** to  
**Kunti**, Pandu’s senior wife. The mantra  
gives the woman who recites it the  
power to call down any god and to have,  
by that god, a son equal in power to himself. Kunti uses this mantra to bear  
Yudhishthira by the god **Dharma**,  
Arjuna by the storm-god **Indra**, and  
Bhima by the **wind**-god **Vayu**. With  
Pandu’s blessing Kunti also teaches the  
mantra to her co-wife **Madri**, who meditates on the **Ashvins** (divine twins who  
are the physicians to the gods), and  
delivers the twins Nakula and Sahadeva.  
The basic theme of the *Mahabharata*  
is the story of the struggle for royal  
power between the Pandavas and  
their cousins, the **Kauravas**, which  
culminates in a war that destroys the  
entire family.
