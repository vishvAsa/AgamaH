title = "Palm Leaves"

+++
Until commercially produced paper  
became readily available, palm leaves  
were the most common writing medium  
in traditional India. The palm leaves  
were cut into narrow strips held together  
by a cord (**sutra**) running through a hole  
punched in the middle of the leaf. Palm  
leaf books usually had a top and bottom  
made from strips of wood, to protect the  
leaves, and these covers were often  
ornately decorated. The fragile nature of  
these palm leaves made regular copying  
necessary to preserve manuscripts, even  
though such frequent copying generally  
introduced errors. If left untended, the  
life span of a manuscript was at most  
fifty years, due to the deteriorations  
caused by the climate and the damage  
from a species of termite known as  
“white ants,” which fed on palm leaves.
