title = "Pratyaksha"

+++
(“concerning the eye”) In Indian **philosophy**, pratyaksha is the general term for  
sense perception. All philosophical  
schools accept perception as one of the  
**pramanas**, the means by which human  
beings can gain true and accurate  
knowledge, and it is the only pramana  
accepted by the **materialist** school.  
Although the word’s literal meaning  
implies only information from the eyes,  
this pramana includes sense data from  
the other four human senses, as well as  
“perceptions” obtained through magical  
cognition, yogic insight, or any other  
supernormal abilities or phenomena.
