title = "Parvana"

+++
A particular type of the memorial rites  
for the dead known as **shraddhas**. A parvana shraddha can be performed at specific times throughout the **year**, such as  
the **new moon**, but is most commonly  
performed during the Fortnight of the  
Fathers (**Pitrpaksha**), which falls during  
the waning moon in the **lunar month** of  
**Bhadrapada**. Whereas an **ekoddishta**  
**shraddha** is performed for any particular deceased individual, the parvana  
shraddha invokes first the paternal  
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,  
then the same ancestors on the mother’s  
side. The rite is performed to give benefits to all of these ancestors, although  
the father’s ancestors are considered the  
primary recipients.
