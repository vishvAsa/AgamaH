(“Five Voices”) Manuscript collection  
compiled by the **Dadupanth**, a religious  
community founded by the northern  
Indian poet-saint **Dadu** (1554–1603).  
The collection contains the works of five  
different devotional (**bhakti**) poet–  
saints: Dadu, **Kabir**, **Namdev**, **Ravidas**,  
and Hardas. **Rajasthan’s** desert climate  
has helped to preserve these manuscripts, some of which date from the  
early seventeenth century. The Panchvani  
manuscripts are among the earliest  
written sources for these poets, which  
makes them an important resource for  
the historical study of northern Indian  
devotional poetry. For further information on the literary resources of the  
Dadupanth, see Winand Callewaert  
(trans.), *The Sarvangi of the Dadupanthi*  
*Rajab*, 1978; and *The Sarvangi of*  
*Gopaldas*, 1993.
