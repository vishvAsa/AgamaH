title = "Panth"

+++
General term used for a particular religious community, such as the  
**Dadupanth**, **Varkari** Panth, or the  
Nanak Panth—an older name for the  
Sikh community, which has simply been  
abridged to “Panth” by contemporary  
Sikhs. The word is derived from the  
**Sanskrit** word for “path” and is here  
used metaphorically to indicate a fixed  
pattern of belief and behavior, often  
rooted in a particular individual’s teachings. There is a certain amount of  
semantic overlap between the words  
*panth* and **sampraday**, both of which  
denote religious communities, and  
there is no hard-and-fast rule dividing  
the two. In general, however, the term  
497  
Panth  
*panth* is more closely associated with  
movements in the **sant** religious tradition, which tended toward rebellion  
against the prevailing religious establishment, whereas *sampraday* is more  
commonly applied to groups that  
evolved within these established religious communities.
