title = "Pashupatinath"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in  
Katmandu, **Nepal**. The temple is named  
for its presiding **deity**, who is the god  
**Shiva** in his form as Pashupatinath, “the  
Master of the Lord of Beasts.” This is a  
considered an extremely powerful site,  
and one of its charter myths connects it  
to **Kedarnath**, a sacred site high in the  
**Himalayas**. According to the story, the  
five **Pandava** brothers, who are the protagonists in the epic **Mahabharata**, are  
making their final journey into the  
Himalayas in search of a vision of  
Shiva. They finally see him at a distance, but when they try to get closer,  
Shiva takes the form of a **bull** and  
begins running through the snow. The  
bull burrows into a snow bank, and  
when the Pandavas follow, they find the  
body of the bull in the snow. The ridge  
of rock that forms the Kedarnath **linga**  
is considered to be the hump of this  
bull. The bull’s head continues traveling over the hills, eventually stopping  
in Nepal, where it takes form as the  
deity Pashupatinath.
