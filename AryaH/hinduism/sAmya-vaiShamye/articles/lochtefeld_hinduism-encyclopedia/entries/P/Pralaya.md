title = "Pralaya"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the dissolution of  
the universe that comes at the end of the  
**kalpa** or **Day of Brahma**. Pralaya is considered the “night” of Brahma, and lasts  
for the same amount of time as the day  
(by one estimate, 4.32 billion years). The  
approach of this “night” is preceded by  
the destruction of the earth, first by fire,  
and then by torrential rains that transform the entire planet into one vast  
ocean. During this time the only living  
thing is the god **Vishnu**, who reclines on  
the back of his serpent vehicle **Shesha**,  
deep in a yogic trance. When the time  
again comes for creation, a lotus sprouts  
from his navel, which opens to reveal  
**Brahma**, and the world begins anew.
