title = "Puri Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, ascetics who are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**. The  
Dashanamis were supposedly established by the ninth century philosopher  
**Shankaracharya** in an effort to create a  
corps of learned men who could help to  
revitalize Hindu life. Each of the divisions is designated by a different  
name—in this case, **puri** (“city”). Upon  
**initiation**, new members are given this  
name as their new surname, thus allowing for immediate group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten “named” divisions are also  
divided into four larger organizational  
groups. Each group has its headquarters  
in one of the four monastic centers  
(**maths**) supposedly established by  
Shankaracharya, as well as other particular religious associations. The Puri  
Dashanamis belong to the **Kitawara**  
group, which is affiliated with the  
**Shringeri Math** in the southern Indian  
town of Shringeri.
