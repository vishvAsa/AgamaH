(“succession”) The general term for  
the spiritual lineage maintained by  
the transmission of knowledge  
and power from **guru** to disciple.  
Such lineages form the basis for  
tracing spiritual descent within  
religious communities, particularly  
in secret traditions such as **tantra**.  
In a religious context, one’s spiritual  
lineage is an important factor in  
establishing an identity and connections with others in the school, in the  
same way a biological lineage places one  
within a family.
