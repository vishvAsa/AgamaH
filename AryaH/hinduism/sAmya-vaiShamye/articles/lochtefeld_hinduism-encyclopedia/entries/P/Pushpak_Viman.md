title = "Pushpak Viman"

+++
(“Flower chariot”) In Hindu mythology,  
the most famous of the **aerial cars**.  
Pushpak Viman is built by the divine  
architect **Vishvakarma**. Vishvakarma’s  
daughter **Sanjna** has married the **Sun**  
but is so overwhelmed by his brilliance  
that she begs her father to reduce his  
luster so she can stand to be with him.  
Vishvakarma does this by trimming  
some bits off the sun, which are later  
fashioned into the Pushpak Viman as  
well as several divine weapons. For  
some time the Pushpak Viman is held  
by the minor **deity Kubera**, who obtains  
it as a reward for performing intense  
physical **asceticism** (**tapas**). It is later  
taken from Kubera by the **demon**-king  
**Ravana**, who uses its powers to wreak all  
sorts of tyranny, culminating in the  
abduction of **Rama’s** wife **Sita**. After  
slaying Ravana, Rama uses the Pushpak  
Viman to return to the city of **Ayodhya**  
and then returns the car to Kubera.
