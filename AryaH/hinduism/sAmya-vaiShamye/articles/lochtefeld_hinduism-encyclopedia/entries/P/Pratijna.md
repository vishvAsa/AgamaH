(“assertion”) In Indian logic, a part in the  
generally accepted form of an inference  
(**anumana**), or logical statement. The  
accepted form for an inference has  
three terms: an assertion (pratijna), a  
reason (**hetu**), and examples (**drshtanta**).  
Each of these three also has its own constituent parts. The pratijna’s two constituent parts are the **paksha** and the  
**sadhya**. The paksha is the subject of the  
assertion and names a class of things,  
while the sadhya is the claim to be  
proven about that class. For example, in  
the assertion “this mountain is on **fire**,”  
the paksha is “this mountain” (the class  
of things about which a claim is being  
made), and the sadhya, or thing to be  
proven, is “is on fire.”
