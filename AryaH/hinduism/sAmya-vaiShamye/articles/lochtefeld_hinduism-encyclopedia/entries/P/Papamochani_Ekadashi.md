title = "Papamochani Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waning) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Chaitra** (March–April). The name  
Papamochani means “freeing from  
evil,” and the faithful observance of  
this festival is believed to do exactly  
that. As with all the eleventh-day  
observances, it is dedicated to the  
**worship** of **Vishnu**. Most Hindu festivals  
have certain prescribed rites, which  
usually involve fasting (**upavasa**) and  
worship (**puja**), and often promise specific benefits for faithful performance.  
On this day one should worship Vishnu  
with the full complement of the sixteen  
**upacharas** (“**offerings**”).
