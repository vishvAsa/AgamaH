(“flower”) The tenth of the sixteen traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to  
a **deity** as part of **worship**. In this offering (based on the model of treating the  
deity as an honored guest) the deity is  
given flowers, valued both for their color  
and their fragrance. The actual act of  
offering can be performed in various  
ways and often depends on the worshiper’s inclinations. In some cases the  
flowers will simply be presented before  
the deity’s image, with the understanding that the deity has taken them,  
whereas in other cases flowers will  
be placed on the deity’s image, or a  
garland hung around its neck. In  
either instance, the underlying motive  
is to show love and respect for the  
deity and to minister to its needs as  
one would to a living person. This particular act of respect and love can also  
be accorded to other human beings;  
garlanding a person with flowers is a  
sign of high esteem or congratulations.
