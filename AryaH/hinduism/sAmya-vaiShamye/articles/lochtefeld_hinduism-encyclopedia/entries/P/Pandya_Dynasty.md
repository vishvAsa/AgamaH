title = "Pandya Dynasty"

+++
(6thâ€“14th c.) Southern Indian dynasty  
whose capital was in the city of **Madurai**  
in the state of **Tamil Nadu**. The Pandyas  
existed as a regional power as early as  
the late sixth century, when they fought  
the **Pallava dynasty** of **Kanchipuram** for  
control of the peninsula. The Pandyas at  
one time became vassals to the **Chola**  
**dynasty** when the latter reigned over all  
496  
Pandrenthan  
of southern India, but with the decline of  
the Cholas the Pandyas became the  
dominant regional power, eventually  
absorbing the Chola kingdom in 1279. At  
their zenith in the thirteenth century the  
Pandyas controlled most of the southern  
part of India, but were in turn conquered  
and annexed early in the fourteenth century by the Sangama dynasty, also known  
as the **Vijayanagar dynasty** after their  
capital city.
