(“Five Treatises”) A collection of moralistic fables intended to impart practical  
and worldly wisdom. The fables themselves are framed by the story of a king  
who is distressed by his sons’ lack of  
learning and good moral character,  
which gives him grave misgivings about  
their ability to rule well after his death.  
He resolves this problem by hiring a person to teach the boys through fables,  
each of which usually has several shorter  
fables embedded in it to give moral  
lessons along the way. These fables are  
intended to provide pragmatic advice  
about how to be successful in the real  
world, particularly in the art of statecraft. This pragmatic focus can lead one  
to characterize the text’s advice as  
opportunistic, particularly since it  
encourages caution and self-interest as  
the keys to success. The *Panchatantra*  
exists in several versions, of which the  
most famous is the **Hitopadesha**. The  
text has been translated numerous  
times; a version found its way to Europe,  
where it became the basis for the fables  
of La Fontaine.
