title = "Prajapatya Marriage"

+++
One of the eight ways to perform a marriage recognized in the **dharma literature**, the treatises on religious duty. In  
Hindu mythology **Prajapati** was the  
name of the creator, and this name suggests that the purpose of this marriage  
was for people to fulfill their duties to  
the ancestors by procreating. A  
Prajapatya marriage takes place when a  
father gives away his **daughter** to a man  
with the condition that they will perform their civic and religious duties  
together. This was one of the four  
approved (**prashasta**) forms of marriage, because it was arranged by the  
girlâ€™s father. However, it was considered  
less commendable than the other  
approved forms, because the girl was  
given in marriage with conditions. In  
Indian culture, the best way to give a  
daughter is to impose no conditions. See
