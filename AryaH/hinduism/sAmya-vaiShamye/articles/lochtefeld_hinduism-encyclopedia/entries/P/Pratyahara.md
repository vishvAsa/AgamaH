(“withdrawal [of the senses]”) In the  
**ashtanga** (“eight-part”) **yoga** first codified by **Patanjali** (1st c. C.E.?), pratyahara is the fifth of the eight  
constituent elements of yoga practice.  
Pratyahara occurs when one withdraws the senses from the sense  
objects they ordinarily perceive. It is  
done after one has mastered the sitting positions (**asanas**)—and thus can  
sit comfortably for long periods—and  
after one has gained control of  
“breath” (**pranayama**), which allows  
heightened command of one’s physiological capacities. Having gained relative mastery over the body, one is then  
ready to focus attention inward.
