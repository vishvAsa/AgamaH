(“substitute”) In the context of **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based religious practice,  
anything that can correctly be used as a  
substitute. Certain tantric rites make ritual use of substances or actions that are  
normally forbidden; the most famous of  
these rites, the Five Forbidden Things  
(**panchamakara**), incorporates violating  
the social taboos on drinking wine, consuming nonvegetarian food, and engaging in illicit sex. The ritual use of such  
normally forbidden things must be seen  
in the larger context of tantric practice.  
One of the most pervasive tantric  
assumptions is the ultimate unity  
of everything that exists. From this  
perspective, adepts affirm that  
the entire universe is one principle—  
often, conceived as the activity of a  
particular **deity**—and therefore reject  
all concepts based on dualistic thinking.  
The “Five Forbidden Things,” therefore,  
provides a ritual means for breaking  
the duality of sacred and forbidden,  
by sacralizing several things that are  
ordinarily forbidden.  
These five things are used in their  
actual form in “left hand” (**vamachara**)  
tantra, and by substitution in “right hand”  
(**dakshinachara**) tantra. Substitution  
allows the adept to perform the ritual  
and at the same time to avoid the disapproval that would result from breaking  
certain social rules. Although tantric  
texts allow for substitution in this rite,  
they are usually quite specific about  
what sorts of things are acceptable  
substitutes, a signature quality of strictly  
defined ritual systems. For further information see Swami Agehananda Bharati,
