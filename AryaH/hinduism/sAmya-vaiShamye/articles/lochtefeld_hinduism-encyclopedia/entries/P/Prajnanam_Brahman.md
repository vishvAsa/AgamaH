title = "Prajnanam Brahman"

+++
(“Wisdom is **Brahman**”) In the Hindu  
philosophical tradition, one of the “great  
utterances” (**mahavakyas**) expressing  
the ultimate truth. The truth here is the  
identity of **prajnanam** (ultimate wisdom) and Brahman (Supreme Reality);  
this identity is the heart of the speculative texts called the **Upanishads**. Aside  
from their importance in a philosophical context, as encapsulating fundamental truths, the four mahavakyas  
were also appropriated as identifying  
symbols by the four divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasi** ascetics. Each division had a different **mahavakya**, just as  
each had a different **Veda**, a different  
primary monastic center, and a different  
paradigmatic **ascetic** quality. Prajnanam  
Brahman is the mahavakya associated  
with the **Bhogawara** division of the  
Dashanami Sanyasis.
