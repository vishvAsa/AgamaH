title = "Putrada Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance that occurs twice  
per **year**: on the eleventh **day** (**ekadashi**)  
of the bright (waxing) half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Shravan** (July–August), and  
540  
Pushyabhuti Dynasty  
on the eleventh day of the bright (waxing) half of the lunar month of **Paush**  
(December–January). As with all the  
eleventh-day observances, these are  
dedicated to the god **Vishnu**. Most  
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed  
rites, which usually involve fasting  
(**upavasa**) and **worship**, and often  
promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. Faithfully observing the  
ekadashi rites on these days is believed  
to give one a **son** (putra), which is a  
major concern in traditional Indian culture. Sons are necessary for this world  
and the next, not only to care for their  
parents in their old age, but also to  
perform certain ancestral rites after  
one’s death. The strength of this  
desire for sons is demonstrated by the  
fact that this particular ekadashi  
occurs twice during the year—the only  
ekadashi to do so.
