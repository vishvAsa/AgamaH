title = "Prohibition"

Most traditional Hindus have clearly  
and strongly disapproved of consuming  
**liquor**, a substance which, because it  
may lead to a loss of control, is seen as  
impure. Among wealthier Indians,  
drinking alcoholic beverages is seen as a  
habit that signals the acceptance of  
Western values and alienation from  
oneâ€™s roots, whereas among poorer citizens, particularly laborers, drinking is  
often seen as a misuse of money needed  
to support a family. For all these reasons,  
the imposition of total or partial prohibition has become an effective part of  
electoral platforms designed to appeal  
to traditional and conservative Hindus.  
In 1997, prohibition had been established in three Indian states: **Gujarat**,  
**Andhra Pradesh**, and **Haryana**. Of these  
three, Gujarat is the only one with a  
long-standing history of prohibition,  
while prohibition in Andhra Pradesh in  
1995, and in Haryana in 1996, was  
imposed to fulfill campaign promises  
made during the state elections in those  
years. In both cases, the imposition of  
prohibition also stimulated widespread  
bootlegging and illegal distilling.
