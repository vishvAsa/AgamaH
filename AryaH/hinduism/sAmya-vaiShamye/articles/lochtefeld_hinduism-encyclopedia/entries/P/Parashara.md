title = "Parashara"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a legendary sage  
who is the grandson of the sage  
**Vasishtha**. He is credited with authoring  
the **Parashara Smrti**, an important and  
early work in the **dharma literature**.  
Parashara is best known as the father of  
the sage **Vyasa**, whom he begets through  
a maiden named **Satyavati**. Satyavati  
makes her living ferrying people across  
the **Ganges** River, and although she is a  
beautiful young woman, she always  
smells of fish because her mother is a  
celestial nymph who has been cursed to  
live as a fish in the Ganges. Struck by  
Satyavatiâ€™s beauty while she is ferrying  
him across the river, Parashara creates  
an artificial fog to give them the privacy  
to have sexual intercourse. As a reward,  
he gives her the boon that, from that day  
onward, she will smell of musk instead  
of fish.
