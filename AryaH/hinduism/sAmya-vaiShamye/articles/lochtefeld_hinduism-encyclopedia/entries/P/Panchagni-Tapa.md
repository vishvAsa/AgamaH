(“five-fires **asceticism**”) Form of voluntary physical mortification, usually performed in the hot **season**, in which the  
person sits surrounded by four fires, the  
fifth fire being the sun overhead.  
Although this practice is now uncommon, it is very old and routinely named  
in the **puranas** and other religious texts  
as one of the standard **ascetic** practices.  
As with all forms of physical ascetic  
endurance (**tapas**), this rite is performed  
under the assumption that voluntarily  
enduring pain and/or hardship is a  
way to gain spiritual, religious, and  
magical power.
