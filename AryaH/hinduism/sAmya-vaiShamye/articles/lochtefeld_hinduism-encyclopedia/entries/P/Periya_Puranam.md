Hagiographical account of the lives of  
the sixty-three **Nayanars**, written by the  
twelfth-century figure **Cekkilar**. The  
Nayanars were a group of **Shaiva** poetsaints, who lived in southern India  
508  
Paush  
between the seventh and ninth centuries. Together with their **Vaishnava**  
counterparts, the **Alvars**, the Nayanars  
spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu  
religion within **Tamil Nadu**, which was  
mostly Buddhist and Jain. Both the  
Nayanars and the Alvars stressed passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal  
god—**Shiva** for the Nayanars, **Vishnu** for  
the Alvars—and conveyed this devotion  
through hymns sung in the **Tamil language**. According to tradition, Cekkilar  
was a minister at the court of the **Chola**  
**dynasty** king Kullottunga II (r. 1130–50).  
Cekkilar, distressed by the king’s admiration for a Jain epic poem, composed  
his text in an effort to wean the king  
away from it. His text portrays these  
saints as models of devotion to Shiva  
and as salutary examples to others  
although at times extreme in their devotion. One example of this intense devotion is Kotpuli Nayanar, who killed his  
entire family when he discovered that,  
in order to save their lives in a time of  
famine, they had eaten rice that  
belonged to Shiva’s temple. Although  
this is an extreme case, the message is  
clearly that devotion to God must  
eclipse all other loyalties.
