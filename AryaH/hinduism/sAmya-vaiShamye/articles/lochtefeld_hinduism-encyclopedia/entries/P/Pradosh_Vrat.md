title = "Pradosh Vrat"

+++
(“twilight vow”) Religious observance  
celebrated on the thirteenth day of each  
lunar fortnight, mainly by **women**, often  
for the birth of children or to sustain the  
general family welfare. The vow (**vrat**) is  
dedicated to the god **Shiva**, and its most  
important part takes place on the  
evening of the thirteenth day (the word  
*pradosh* is interpreted as meaning “twilight”) when worshipers present Shiva  
with the sixteen traditional **offerings**  
(**upacharas**), following which they may  
take their only meal of the day. In  
some cases worshipers stay awake  
through the night so that the observance  
may finish on the fourteenth day of  
the month, a lunar day connected  
with Shiva. When the thirteenth day  
falls on a **Monday** (associated with  
Shiva), **Saturday** (associated with  
**Saturn**), or **Sunday** (associated with  
the **Sun**), this rite is believed to be  
especially efficacious.
