title = "Peacock"

+++
Indian bird with several divine associations. It is the **animal** vehicle of the god  
**Skanda**, the **son** of **Shiva**, who is the  
leader of the divine armies. The peacock’s quickness and resplendent  
appearance are felt to mirror these qualities in the young god. The peacock also  
has strong associations with the god  
**Krishna**, who is usually depicted as  
wearing a decorative crown containing  
peacock feathers. This association may  
come from the peacock’s connection  
with the **monsoon**, which is the peacock  
mating season, during which they utter  
piercing calls in the forests and are  
believed to **dance** with delight on the  
hillsides. Krishna’s dark color often leads  
to comparisons with rain clouds, and  
like the peacock he spends his nights  
dancing in the company of his devotees  
(**bhakta**), in the celebration known as  
the **ras lila**.
