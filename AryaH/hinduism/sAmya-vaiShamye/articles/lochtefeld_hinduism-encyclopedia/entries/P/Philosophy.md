The Euro-American conception that  
there is a fundamental distinction  
between philosophy and religion  
reflects unique historical and cultural  
circumstances that have no parallel in  
many other cultures. The Western philosophical tradition is rooted in Greek  
thought and culture, whereas Western  
religious traditions primarily have been  
shaped by ideas coming out of the  
Jewish tradition. The ideas from these  
two different sources developed side by  
side in Western culture, sometimes in an  
uneasy alliance and sometimes at odds  
but they were always seen as separate. In  
many other cultures, this distinction does  
not exist, and such imported concepts  
become less helpful in encountering  
these cultures. Indian and Hindu culture  
have a long history of critical and speculative thought, which could be called philosophical. Yet such thought is never  
exercised simply for its own sake, but  
always with an underlying religious purpose—to enable one to gain the ultimate  
religious goal, final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). The different perspectives on  
how to do this, known as **darshans**, are  
usually designated as “philosophical  
schools.” See also **six schools**.
