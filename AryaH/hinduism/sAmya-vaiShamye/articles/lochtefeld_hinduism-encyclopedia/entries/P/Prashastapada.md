(5th c.) Author of the *Padarthadharmasangraha*.This text is the most influential  
commentary on **Kanadaâ€™s Vaisheshika**  
**Sutras**, the founding text of the  
Vaisheshika school, one of the **six**  
**schools** of traditional Hindu **philosophy**. The Vaisheshika school was atomistic, believing that all things were made  
up of a few basic constituent substances: the five **elements** (**earth**, **fire**,  
**water**, **wind**, and **akasha**) along with  
space, time, mind, and individual selves  
(**atman**). The five elements combined to  
form the things in the world, though  
selves were considered ultimately different from matter.
