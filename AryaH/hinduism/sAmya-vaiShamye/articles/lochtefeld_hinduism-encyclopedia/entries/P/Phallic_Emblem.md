title = "Phallic Emblem"

+++
Designation for the **linga**, the pillarshaped object that is the symbolic form  
of the god **Shiva**. The precise sculptural  
form of the **Gudimallam linga**, which  
dates from at least the second century  
B.C.E., leaves little doubt that this phallic  
element is one aspect of the symbol.  
What is often overlooked is that an  
equally important part of the linga’s  
image is the base (**pitha**) in which  
the shaft is placed, said to represent  
the female organs of generation. In his  
symbolic form Shiva is thus both male  
and female—an appropriate form for a  
**deity** who is famous for transcending  
any and all duality.
