title = "Prinsep, James"

+++
(1799–1840) British official and amateur  
Indologist. In 1837, Prinsep became the  
first modern person to decipher the  
**Brahmi** script, and was thus able to  
translate the edicts of the Mauryan  
emperor **Ashoka** (r. 269–32 B.C.E.).  
Unfortunately, his career was cut short  
by an early death, a pattern distressingly  
familiar for colonial administrators in  
British India. See also **Maurya dynasty**.
