title = "male‚Äù) Samskara"

+++
In traditional calculation, the second of  
the life-cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**).  
The Pumsavana samskara was one of  
the **prenatal samskaras** performed  
before **birth**, done to ensure that a  
newly conceived child would be a boy.  
Various writers give differing prescriptions as to the correct time during  
the **pregnancy** to perform this rite, but  
they generally specify that it be  
performed when the **moon** is in a male  
constellation, at which time the woman  
should have several drops of the juice  
from the banyan tree inserted into her  
right nostril (a common practice in  
traditional medicine). This samskara is  
seldom performed in modern times.
