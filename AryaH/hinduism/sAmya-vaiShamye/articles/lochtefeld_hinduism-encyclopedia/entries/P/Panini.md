title = "Panini"

+++
(4th c. B.C.E.) The greatest **Sanskrit**  
grammarian, whose descriptive account  
of that language in his **Ashtadhyayi**  
(“Eight Sections”) became the prescriptive norm for the language in later generations. Panini was not the earliest  
grammarian, since he names several in  
his text; his genius lay rather in his skills  
as an organizer and systematizer. Each  
of the *Ashtadhyayi*’s eight sections is  
written as a series of brief aphorisms  
(**sutras**), each of which provides the  
foundation and necessary background  
for those that follow. Panini’s use of this  
form allowed him to provide a complete  
account of the language in the briefest  
possible space, and the text’s condensed  
form made it easier to memorize. As  
with most sutra texts, the *Ashtadhyayi’s*  
terseness of expression presupposes a  
commentary, of which the most famous  
is the **Mahabhashya**, written by the  
grammarian **Patanjali** in the second  
century B.C.E.
