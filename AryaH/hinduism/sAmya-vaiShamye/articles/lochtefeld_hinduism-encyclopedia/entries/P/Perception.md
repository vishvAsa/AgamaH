title = "Perception"

+++
In Hindu **philosophy**, perception  
(**pratyaksha**) is universally accepted as  
one of the **pramanas**, the means by  
which human beings can gain true  
and accurate knowledge. Perception  
is the only pramana accepted by all  
the schools, but most of the others  
also accept inference (**anumana**)  
and authoritative testimony (**shabda**).  
See **pratyaksha**.
