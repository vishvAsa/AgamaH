(“irresistible will”) One of the eight  
**superhuman powers** (**siddhi**) traditionally believed to be conferred by high  
spiritual attainment. This particular  
power removes all obstructions to the  
movement of one’s body, such that one  
can go wherever one desires, even passing through solid objects as if moving  
through water.
