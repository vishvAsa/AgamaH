title = "Pret"

+++
(“departed,” “deceased”) The spirit of a  
person who has recently died but is still  
inappropriately connected to the world  
of the living, often as a troubling or  
malevolent presence to the departed’s  
family or the general population. Prets  
are believed to be the spirits of people  
who died in childhood and whose  
untimely death left them with certain  
unfulfilled desires, particularly longings  
relating to marriage and family life. Prets  
make themselves known to the living in  
two ways, either through **dreams** or  
**possession**. In some cases they have  
specific requests and can be placated  
through **worship** and **offerings**. In such  
instances, dreams offer a method of  
communicating with the living, so that  
necessary actions can be performed for  
the pret. In other cases, the spirit may  
resort to bodily possession in an  
attempt to realize unfulfilled desires  
directly. These spirits are typically  
malevolent and require an exorcism to  
be removed. For further information on  
the care of unquiet family spirits, see

of spirits, possession, and healing, see
