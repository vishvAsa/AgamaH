title = "Pippalada"

+++
In Hindu traditional lore, one of the  
ancient sages in the **Atharva Veda**, one  
of the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
Pippalada is also mentioned in the  
**Prashna Upanishad**, one of the speculative religious texts that forms the latest  
part of the Vedas, as a religious teacher  
who instructs sages such as Sukesha,  
**Kashyapa**, and Bhargava. Pippalada  
supposedly gets his name from his  
fondness for Pippali fruits, the fruit  
of the *Ficus religiosa*, the sacred pipal  
(**ashvattha**).
