title = "Pustaka"

+++
A book, traditionally made of **palm**  
**leaves** connected by a string running  
through a hole punched in the middle,  
with a wooden cover on top and bottom  
to keep the leaves from being bent or  
broken. In Indian iconography, the book  
is most strongly associated with the  
**goddess Saraswati**, in keeping with her  
identity as the patron **deity** of the arts,  
culture, and learning. It also commonly  
appears as one of the objects held by the  
god **Brahma**.
