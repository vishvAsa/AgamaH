title = "Paramahamsa"

+++
(“supreme **Hamsa**”) One of four types of  
Hindu **ascetic**. The four types were  
based on their supposed means of livelihood, which in practice has been much  
less important for ascetic identity than  
sectarian or organizational affiliation.  
The Paramahamsa is the most prestigious of the four, the others being (in  
order of increasing status) **Kutichaka**,  
**Bahudaka**, and Hamsa. Paramahamsas  
have no fixed abode and always live in  
an uninhabited place. They are said to  
have transcended all questions of religious duty (**dharma**), **purity**, and impurity (**ashaucha**), to have broken all  
attachments to the world, and to be

Pap  
continually immersed in contemplation  
of the Supreme **Brahman**.  
The word Paramahamsa has a more  
specialized meaning among the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, ascetic devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva** whose organization is divided into ten sections, each  
designated by a particular name. Here  
the name Paramahamsa refers to an  
ascetic who comes from one of the  
three **twice-born** (dvija) **varnas**—that  
is, who is a **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or  
**vaishya**, the three social groups with  
higher symbolic status—and who has  
been initiated as a **Sanyasi** in one of  
the six divisions that will accept nonbrahmins. Paramahamsas have higher  
status in these divisions than the **Naga**  
or fighting ascetics, who will initiate  
**shudras**, but lower status than the  
**Dandis**, who are invariably brahmins.
