title = "Pushti Marg"

+++
Religious community founded by the  
philosopher **Vallabhacharya** (1479–1531),  
whose teachings remain the sect’s primary influence. Vallabhacharya characterized his philosophical position as  
“pure monism” (**Shuddadvaita**); his fundamental position is that the god  
**Krishna** is the Supreme Being and the  
539  
Pushti Marg  
ultimate source of everything that exists.  
The world, and human beings, thus  
share in his divine nature, although only  
in a limited fashion, and the human soul  
is imbued with divinity as its inner light  
and controller.  
Since Krishna is the ultimate source  
of everything and thus everything  
depends ultimately on God, the school’s  
primary religious emphasis is on the  
importance of God’s **grace**. This grace is  
seen as nourishing (pushti) the devotee  
(**bhakta**) and is best attained by devotion (**bhakti**), which is conceived of as  
the only effective religious path. This  
emphasis on grace and devotion has  
meant that the Pushti Marg have put little stress on **asceticism** or renunciation,  
and the bulk of Vallabhacharya’s  
followers came from affluent merchant  
communities. The stress on devotion  
was soon articulated in elaborately  
arranged forms of image **worship** in the  
Pushti Marg’s temples. Devotees would  
visualize themselves as Krishna’s companions during his daily activities—  
waking, eating, taking his cows to  
graze, coming home, etc.—and thus  
gain the opportunity to take part in the  
divine play (**lila**). This emphasis on  
visualization and participation was fostered through the development of vast  
liturgical resources, which were composed by eight poets (the **ashtachap**)  
who were associated with Vallabhacharya  
and **Vitthalnath**, his **son** and successor.  
The third leader, Vitthalnath’s son  
**Gokulnath**, further consolidated the  
developing community, whose major  
sacred site is now in **Nathdwara** in the  
state of **Rajasthan**. For further information see R.K. Barz, *The Bhakti Sect of*
