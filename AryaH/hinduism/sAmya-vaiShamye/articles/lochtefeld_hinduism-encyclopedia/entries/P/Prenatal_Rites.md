Life-cycle rituals (**samskaras**) performed  
by a husband before his child’s **birth**, as  
prescribed in the **dharma literature**, the  
texts on religious duty. According to this  
literature, there were three such rites:  
**Garbhadhana**, which ensured conception; **Pumsavana**, which guaranteed that  
the newly conceived child would be a  
boy; and **Simantonnayana**, which was  
performed late in the **pregnancy** to  
ensure the child’s good health and the  
mother’s easy delivery. Although the  
dharma literature prescribes these rites  
as obligatory, none of them are widely  
performed now except by the most  
orthodox brahmins.
