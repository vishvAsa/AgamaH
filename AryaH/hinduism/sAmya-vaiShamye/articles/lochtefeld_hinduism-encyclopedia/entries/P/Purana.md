title = "Purana"

+++
(“old”) An important genre of **smrti** texts,  
and the repository of traditional Indian  
mythology. The smrtis, or “remembered,”  
texts were a class of literature that,  
although deemed important, was considered less authoritative than the **shrutis**, or  
“heard” texts. In brief, the shrutis denoted  
the **Vedas**, the oldest and most authoritative Hindu religious texts, whereas the  
smrtis included the two great epics, namely the **Mahabharata** and the **Ramayana**,  
the **dharma literature**, the **Bhagavad Gita**,  
and the compendia known as the puranas.  
According to one traditional definition, a purana should contain accounts  
of at least five essential things: the creation of the **earth**, its dissolution and  
recreation, origins of the gods and patriarchs, the reigns of the **Manvantaras**,  
and the reigns of the **Solar** and **Lunar**  
**Lines**. In practice, the puranas are compendia of all types of sacred lore, from  
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exaltation of various sacred sites (**tirthas**)  
and actions. Individual puranas are  
usually highly sectarian and intended to  
promote the **worship** of one of the  
Hindu gods, whether **Vishnu**, **Shiva**, or  
the **Goddess**. By tradition the major  
puranas number eighteen, but there are  
hundreds of minor works. Along with  
the epics, the puranas are the storehouses of the mythic tales that are the  
common religious currency for traditional Hindus. In this respect the  
puranas are much more influential than  
any of the **Vedas**, because the tales in  
the puranas are common knowledge.  
The contents of the Vedas, though more  
authoritative, are less well known.  
Judgments on the importance of individual puranas vary according to sectarian persuasion, but some of the
