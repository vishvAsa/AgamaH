title = "Paksha"

+++
One of the parts in the accepted form of  
an inference (**anumana**) in Indian **philosophy**. The accepted form for an inference has three terms: an assertion  
(**pratijna**), a reason (**hetu**), and examples (**drshtanta**); each of these three has  
its own constituent parts. The paksha is  
part of the first term, the assertion, and  
comprises the class of things about  
which the assertion is to be proved. For  
instance, in the stock example, “There is  
fire on that mountain, because there is  
smoke on that mountain,” the paksha  
in this case is “that mountain,” or the  
class of things about which the assertion must be proved. The class that  
forms the paksha must also appear in  
the second term of the inference, the  
reason, as the common link between  
the two parts (as in “this mountain is on  
fire, because this mountain is smoking”). The paksha thus forms the common link between the assertion and the  
reason, thereby ensuring that the latter  
is relevant to the former.  
In the context of a **lunar month**, the  
word *paksha* refers to the month’s two  
“parts.” The **Shukla Paksha** is the waxing half, while the **Krishna Paksha** is the  
waning half.
