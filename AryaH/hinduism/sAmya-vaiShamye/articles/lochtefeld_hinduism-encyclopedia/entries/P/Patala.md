title = "Patala"

+++
A generic name for the realms of the  
underworld, traditionally numbered at  
seven to parallel the seven **heavens** that  
are believed to exist above the visible  
world. These underworld realms are not  
considered to be **hells** but rather planes  
of existence other than the visible world,  
populated by the **Nagas** and other nonhuman beings.
