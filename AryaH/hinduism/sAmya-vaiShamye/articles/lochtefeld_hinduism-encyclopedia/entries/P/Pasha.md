(“noose”) In Indian iconography, one of  
the weapons carried by some of the  
divinities, especially **Ganesh** and **Yama**.  
For Ganesh, as the “Lord of Obstacles,”  
the noose signifies his ability to bind  
(and release) obstacles, whereas Yama,  
the god of death, uses the noose to draw  
the soul from the body at the time of  
death. In the **Shaiva Siddhanta** religious  
community, pasha is also the name  
given to **Shiva’s** power of illusion (**maya**),  
through which he entraps and enthralls  
unenlightened people (**pashu**). The triad  
of pasha, pashu, and Shiva as lord (**pati**)  
are the defining features of the Shaiva  
Siddhanta school.
