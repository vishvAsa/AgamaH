(“holy”) Word most often used as a noun  
to mean “religious merit”—sometimes to  
denote the religious distinction arising  
from a particular deed, but more often  
to refer to the collective body of religious  
merit one has accumulated through the  
good deeds in one’s karmic career.  
(According to the theory of **karma**, all of  
one’s deeds will eventually be realized,  
so the merit one has earned in the past is  
stored up to bring benefits in the future.)  
Its opposite is **pap**, the most general  
word for religious demerit.
