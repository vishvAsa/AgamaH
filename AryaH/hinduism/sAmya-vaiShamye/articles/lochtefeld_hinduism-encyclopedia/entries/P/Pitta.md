title = "Pitta"

+++
(“bile”) Along with **vata** (“air”) and  
**kapha** (“phlegm”), one of the three  
humours (**tridosha**) in **ayurveda**, or  
traditional Indian medicine. Every person has all three of these humours, but  
usually one is predominant, and this  
marks a person in certain ways, particularly with regard to health, digestion,  
and metabolism. Pitta is associated with  
the elements of **fire** and **water**, since  
bile is a liquid involved in digestion,  
which is believed to take place through  
interior burning. Pitta is hot, intense,  
and mobile, and those for whom this is  
the predominant humor are said to have  
a strong will, be good leaders, and be  
blessed with good digestion. At the same  
time, this inner fire gives them bodily  
difficulties in hot weather, and to do  
their best they must also learn how to  
harness their fiery temperaments.
