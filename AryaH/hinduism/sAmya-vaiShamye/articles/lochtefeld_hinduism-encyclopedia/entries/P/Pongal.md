title = "Pongal"

+++
Southern Indian harvest festival marking the change of **seasons** and the transition of the **sun** into the zodiacal sign of  
Capricorn, and thus beginning its  
northward course (**uttarayana**).  
According to Indian astrology this usually  
takes place on January 14th; in northern  
India this day is celebrated as **Makara**  
**Sankranti**. Both mark the sun’s change  
in motion from the southerly direction  
to the northerly, or from the direction  
considered less auspicious to the one  
considered more auspicious.  
The festivities for Pongal last for  
three days. The first day is the Pongal of  
Joy (Bhogi Pongal), on which people  
visit and exchange sweets and gifts. The  
second day is dedicated to the Sun  
(**Surya** Pongal). On this day married  
women cook rice in milk, and when the  
pot comes to a boil they shout “Pongal”  
(“It has boiled”). The milk-rice is made  
into sweets, which is first offered to the  
514  
Pole Star  
Sun and to the god **Ganesh**, and  
then given to friends. On the final day,  
Pongal of Cows (Mattu Pongal),  
worshipers walk in a circle around cows  
while the cows are decorated, garlanded,  
and worshiped.
