title = "Pillar Edicts"

+++
Set of **inscriptions** commissioned by the  
Mauryan emperor **Ashoka** (r. 269â€“32  
B.C.E.), containing official pronouncements on royal policy, and advice and  
instructions to his subjects on a variety  
of topics, including religious toleration.  
Although these edicts were found in  
widely separated places, the text in each  
edict was fairly consistent throughout  
the Mauryan empire. The pillar edicts  
were inscribed on pillars of polished  
**Chunar** sandstone and placed on the  
major roads running through the  
empire, where they would have been  
visible to passersby. In this respect they  
were different from the **rock edicts**,  
which were carved into large boulders in  
places near the borders of the Mauryan  
empire, thus symbolically defining its  
boundaries. See also **Maurya dynasty**.
