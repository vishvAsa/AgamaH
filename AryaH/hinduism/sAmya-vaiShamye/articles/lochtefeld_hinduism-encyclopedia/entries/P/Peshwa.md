title = "Peshwa"

+++
Originally, title given to the **brahmin**  
ministers who served as advisers to the  
kings in the **Maratha** empire.  
Traditionally, these ministers were  
**Chitpavan** brahmins, which gave this  
small group influence far disproportionate to its numbers. During the resurgence of the Maratha confederacy in the  
early eighteenth century, the Peshwas  
became *de facto* rulers, although they  
continued to govern in the name of the  
Maratha kings. At this time, the position  
of Peshwa became hereditary. After the  
Maratha confederation split into different royal states around 1770, the  
Peshwas retained control over the  
ancestral Maratha homeland in the  
western part of the state of  
**Maharashtra**, where they reigned until  
it was conquered by the British in 1818.
