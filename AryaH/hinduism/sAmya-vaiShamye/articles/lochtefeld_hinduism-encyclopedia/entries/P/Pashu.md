title = "Pashu"

+++
(“beast”) In the philosophical school  
known as **Shaiva Siddhanta**, and in the  
secret, ritually based religious practice  
known as **tantra**, the term for an unenlightened person, who is said to have a  
human form but to be little better than  
an **animal**. This lack of awareness  
comes not just through inherent dullness, but through the activity of **maya**,  
the power of illusion wielded by **Shiva**  
as lord (**pati**). The triad of pashu, pati  
and the bonds of illusion (**pasha**) are  
defining features of the Shaiva  
Siddhanta school.
