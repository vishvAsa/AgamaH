title = "Pitha"

+++
(“bench”) In its widest meaning, the  
base or foundation of any object. It can  
denote the material base or foundation  
upon which the image of a **deity** is  
placed. In some cases the foundation  
becomes an integral part of the image  
itself, as in the **linga**, the pillar-shaped  
object that is the symbol of the god  
**Shiva**. The form of the linga, an upright

Pitha  
shaft set in a horizontal base, represents,  
not only the union of male and female,  
but also their transcendence, since  
Shiva is both male and female at once.  
At a more symbolic level, a pitha can be  
the “seat” or residence of a particular  
deity, that is, the place at which the deity  
metaphorically sits. The best example of  
this is the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of  
sites sacred to the **Goddess**, spread  
throughout the subcontinent. Each  
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body  
part of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to earth, taking up residence in each  
place as a different goddess.
