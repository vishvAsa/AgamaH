title = "Polyandry"

+++
Having more than one husband. This  
practice is extremely uncommon in  
Indian society, either now or in the past.  
The best-known mythical example  
comes from the epic **Mahabharata**, in  
which **Draupadi** is married to all five of  
the **Pandava** brothers, the epic’s protagonists. Textual scholars have argued that  
this type of marriage was so unusual  
that it must have been rooted in some  
ancient practice, but there is no proof  
for this claim. In contemporary times  
polyandry can be found only at the  
outer fringes of Hindu society, such as in  
the state of **Assam** and in some of the  
**Himalayan** regions, where traditional  
practices have allowed for one woman  
to marry several brothers, following  
Draupadi’s example.
