title = "Pracharak"

+++
(“director”) In the **Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS), a conservative Hindu  
organization whose express purpose is  
to provide the leadership cadre for a  
revitalized Hindu India, the pracharaks  
are the full-time RSS workers who provide the link between the local units,  
known as **shakhas** (“branches”), and the  
RSS higher authorities. The RSS is a highly  
516  
Prabhupada, A.C. Bhaktivedanta  
authoritarian organization, with all  
power ultimately vested in a single,  
unelected leader, the sarsanghchalak,  
and the pracharaks are the crucial link  
between this highly centralized leadership and the highly decentralized local  
units. The pracharaks are responsible  
for coordinating and managing RSS  
activities in their area, as well as for  
reporting on these at RSS meetings at  
various levels; they may also be sent out  
on loan to provide leadership to RSSaffiliated organizations. As a rule,  
pracharaks are completely devoted to  
the RSS cause, and most have been associated with the RSS since childhood.  
Their ethos is one of service and sacrifice to the RSS, and by implication to the  
country as a whole: They are generally  
unmarried, have no other employment,  
receive no salary from the RSS (although  
the local unit generally provides their  
living expenses), and are famous for living a simple and spartan lifestyle. Most  
of them are also well educated and are  
selected for their ability to get along  
well with others. For further information see Walter K. Andersen and
