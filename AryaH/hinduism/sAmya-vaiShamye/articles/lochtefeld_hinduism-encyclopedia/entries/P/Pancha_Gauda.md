title = "Pancha Gauda"

+++
Collective name for the five main northern Indian **brahmin** communities: the  
**Gaudas** and **Kanaujias**, who stretch  
over most of northern India; the  
**Maithilas** in the northern state of **Bihar**;  
the **Utkalas** in the coastal state of  
**Orissa**; and the **Saraswats**, traditionally  
found in several widely separated locations. One group lived in the coastal  
region of Sindh in modern Pakistan,  
although after Partition in 1947 most  
migrated to Bombay. Another group  
was located in prepartition **Punjab**,  
although here too they have tended to  
migrate away from the part of Punjab in  
modern Pakistan. A third branch, known  
as the **Gauda Saraswats**, is found on a  
narrow strip of coastline in the southern  
Indian state of **Karnataka**.
