Possession by gods, **ghosts**, and spirits is  
an accepted element in the traditional  
Hindu worldview, although whether this  
is good or bad depends on the nature of  
the being responsible. Possession is the  
most common means for **village deities**  
and certain forms of the **Goddess** to  
communicate with human beings,  
although the highest gods in the pantheon virtually never use this medium.  
Possession by a deity can bring a person  
high religious status but is generally said  
to be physically exhausting; through  
the medium the deities can interact  
with human beings, both to make their  
wishes known and to give their help and  
advice to those who need it. One of the  
more unusual cases of this occurs at the  
annual pilgrimage at **Kataragama** in **Sri**  
**Lanka**. Devotees (**bhakta**) suspend  
themselves from trees by hooks stuck  
into the flesh of their backs and, while  
suspended, are believed to be speaking  
for the god **Murugan**.  
Possession by departed spirits (**bhut**  
or **pret**) or by witches and other malefic  
beings is always seen as an inopportune  
event and a dangerous imposition on  
the sufferer that must be remedied as  
soon as possible through healing or  
exorcism. As Sudhir Kakar masterfully  
shows, the language of possession and  
exorcism can be interpreted as an  
“idiom,” using traditional Indian cultural  
categories, for what modern psychiatrists might call the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. For further  
information see Sudhir Kakar, *Shamans*,  
*Mystics*, *and Doctors*, 1991.
