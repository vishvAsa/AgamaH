title = "Prostitution"

+++
Prostitutes or courtesans were a regular  
feature of ancient Indian life. But far  
from simply offering sexual pleasure,  
these prostitutes were in many cases  
women of culture and learning. One of  
the sections in the **Kama Sutra** pertains  
to such individuals, and the author  
**Vatsyayana** portrays prostitutes as  
women who, while clearly outside normal society, have far greater independence than most women. One finds a  
similar picture in *The Little Clay Cart*  
(**Mrcchakatika**), a drama in which the  
528  
Priyadas  
courtesan Vasantasena is sought by all  
the men of the city because of her beauty,  
wealth, and mastery of the sixty-four  
aesthetic arts. This picture is doubtless  
idealized and was probably realistic for  
only a tiny fraction of the women plying  
the sex trade, however.  
The existence of prostitution also  
appears in relation to a group of women  
connected to certain temples. Called  
servants of the **deity** (**devadasis**), these  
women were not allowed to marry.  
Instead, they were considered to be  
married to the god, for whom they  
would sing, **dance**, and perform various  
rites, just as any Hindu wife would for  
her husband. These women could hold  
property and resources of their own, but  
their status was clearly unusual, and it  
was not uncommon for them to develop  
long-term liaisons with local men for  
mutual enjoyment. In some cases this  
degenerated into prostitution—through  
which such women became a source of  
income for the temple—but in other  
instances they were successful in retaining some autonomy. Since Indian independence in 1947 there has been a  
prohibition on initiating devadasis, but  
some older women remain who were  
initiated before that time. In 1995, a  
furor developed when the **Jagannath**  
temple management committee began  
to explore the possibility of new initiations. For further information see  
Vatsyayana (tr. Alain Daniélou), *Kama*  
*Sutra of Vatsyayana*; and Frederique  
Apffel Marglin, *Wives of the God-King*,
