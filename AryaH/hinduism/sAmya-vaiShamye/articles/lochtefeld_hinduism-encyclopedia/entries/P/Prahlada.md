title = "Prahlada"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the **son** of the  
**demon**-king **Hiranyakashipu**, and a  
great devotee (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**. Through harsh physical **asceticism** (**tapas**) Hiranyakashipu has gained  
a series of divine boons that render him  
virtually invulnerable, yet despite his  
power, his son Prahlada refuses to abandon his devotion to Vishnu. Prahlada’s  
devotion in the face of his father’s evergrowing pride generates an escalating  
pattern of abuse that culminates in the  
demand that Prahlada **worship** him  
rather than Vishnu. At that point Vishnu  
comes to Prahlada’s aid as the **Man-lion**  
**avatar**, slays Hiranyakashipu, and  
establishes Prahlada as king in his place.
