+++
A lineage system, primarily among  
**brahmins**, which builds on the assumptions of the **gotra** system (the tracing of  
brahmin lineage to one of seven mythical sages). In his daily **worship** a brahmin would not only mention the name  
of his gotra, who is the sage believed to  
be the family’s immediate progenitor,  
but also the names of other sages  
believed to be remote ancestors. Both  
these “lineages” were passed down only  
through men, since it was customary for  
a married woman to adopt her husband’s gotra as part of her new identity.  
The only context in which gotra and  
pravara were really important was in  
fixing marriages, because of the  
kinship conferred by these mythic  
lineages. Marriage within the gotra  
was strictly forbidden, since the  
assumption that such people were  
directly related made this marriage  
incestuous. Marriage within the pravara  
was also forbidden, although in  
medieval times different groups interpreted this prohibition differently.  
For some groups, any shared pravara  
ancestry would forbid the marriage, but  
for other groups one shared “ancestor”  
was deemed permissible. The more  
lenient interpretation may well have  
been spurred by practical difficulties in  
making matches.
