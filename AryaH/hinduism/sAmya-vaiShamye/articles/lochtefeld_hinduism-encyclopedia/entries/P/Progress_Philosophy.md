(“jativada”) Progress philosophy affirms  
that one can attain complete freedom  
from bondage—which in the Indian  
context is identified as the end of reincarnation (**samsara**) and final liberation  
of the soul (**moksha**)—and that one can  
also specify the necessary and sufficient  
conditions that allow human beings to  
bring about this freedom. As a rule,  
progress philosophy tends to stress  
gradual spiritual attainment, in which  
very small beginnings can gradually lead  
one to the ultimate goal. Progress  
philosophers thus tend to stress particular religious paths that will lead one  
to the final goal, and also tend to place  
a great significance on actions (especially ritual actions) as essential parts  
of this path. In the Hindu tradition,  
most philosophical schools are progress  
philosophies: the combined **NyayaVaisheshika** school, the combined  
**Samkhya-Yoga** school, the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** school, and even the  
**Bhamati** and **Vivarana** schools of  
**Advaita Vedanta.**
