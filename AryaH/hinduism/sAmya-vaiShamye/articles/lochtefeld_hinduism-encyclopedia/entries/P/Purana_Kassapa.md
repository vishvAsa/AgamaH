title = "Purana Kassapa"

+++
In early Indian **philosophy**, philosopher  
opposed to moral rules, whose views are  
mentioned in Buddhist scriptures.  
According to these texts, Kassapa  
believed that there was no religious  
merit in good acts, and no demerit in  
evil actsâ€”that neither of these had any  
affect on the Self at all. Beyond this, very  
little is known about him.
