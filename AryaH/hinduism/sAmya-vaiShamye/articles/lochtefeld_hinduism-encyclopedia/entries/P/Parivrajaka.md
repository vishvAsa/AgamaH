(from **Sanskrit** *parivraj*, “to wander  
about”) A term that can be used to  
denote any wandering religious mendicant. Continual wandering is a very old  
Indian **ascetic** practice. It shows the  
conscious renunciation of the fixed and  
stable world of the householder, particularly in earlier societies, and it prevents  
the wanderer from forming any sort of  
attachments, even to places. This exemplifies the fourth and final stage of life  
found in the **dharma literature**, the  
**sanyasi**, in which a person has  
renounced all attachments of everyday  
life to search for spiritual attainment.
