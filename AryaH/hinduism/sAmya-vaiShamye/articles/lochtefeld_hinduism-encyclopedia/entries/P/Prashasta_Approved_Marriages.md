title = "Prashasta (“Approved”) Marriages"

+++
In the **dharma literature**, or the texts on  
religious duty, these are the four  
approved forms of marriage: the  
**Brahma** marriage, the **Daiva** marriage,  
the **Arsha** marriage, and the **Prajapatya**  
marriage. These forms are deemed commendable because in each case the  
father of the bride is responsible for  
arranging the marriage: In the Brahma  
form the bride is given as a gift without  
conditions, in the Daiva she is given as a  
sacrificial fee, in the Arsha she is given in  
exchange for a pair of cattle for **sacrifice**,  
and in the Prajapatya she is given with  
the condition that the husband and wife  
perform their duties together. The  
Brahma is the only one of these four  
practiced in modern India and is the  
idealized form of marriage. See also
