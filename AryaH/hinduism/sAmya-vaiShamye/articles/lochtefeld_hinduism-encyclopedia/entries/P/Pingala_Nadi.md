title = "Pingala Nadi"

+++
One of the vertical channels (**nadi**) in  
the traditional conception of the **subtle**  
**body**. The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system believed to exist on  
a different plane than gross matter, but  
with certain correspondences to the  
material body. It is visualized as a set of  
six psychic centers (**chakras**) running  
roughly along the course of the spine,  
connected by three parallel vertical  
channels. Above and below these centers are the bodily abodes of the two  
divine principles, **Shiva** (awareness) and  
**Shakti** (power), the latter as the latent  
spiritual energy known as **kundalini**. In  
this model of the subtle body, the pingala nadi is the vertical channel on the  
right side of the body. As with the rest of  
the subtle body, the pingala nadi has  
certain symbolic correspondences; in  
particular, it is identified with the **sun**  
and is thus visualized as being a tawny  
red in color.
