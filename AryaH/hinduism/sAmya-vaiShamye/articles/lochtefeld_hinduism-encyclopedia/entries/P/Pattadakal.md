Historical site in the state of **Karnataka**,  
about twenty miles east of the city of  
Badami. During the **Chalukya dynasty**,  
Pattadakal was an important urban center and a sister city to the Chalukya capital at Badami. Although nearly deserted  
today, the site is important for a collection of temples built in a variety of architectural styles during that era. The  
Virupaksha temple, dedicated in 740 C.E.  
during the reign of King **Vikramaditya**,  
clearly shows the influence of the southern Indian **Dravida** architectural style: a  
mostly low and extended profile, with a  
series of terraced roofs over the main  
sanctuary. It is believed to have been  
modeled after the temples in the city of  
**Kanchipuram**, which had been conquered by Vikramaditya, who brought  
its architects and builders back to  
Pattadakal with him. At the same time,  
there are temples showing the early  
development of the **Nagara** style, in  
which the major architectural feature is  
a series of upswept towers (**shikharas**),  
with the tallest tower directly over the  
image of the templeâ€™s primary **deity**. The  
best example of this is the Galaganatha  
temple, dedicated to the god **Shiva**,  
which has a tall vertical tower perched  
on a larger, cube-shaped base.
