(shaucha) Along with its opposite,  
impurity (**ashaucha**), purity is one of the  
fundamental concepts in Hindu culture.  
Although to outsiders purity can be easily confused with cleanliness, it is fundamentally different—purity is a religious  
category marked by the presence or  
absence of pollution or defilement,  
whereas cleanliness is a hygienic category. In some cases these categories can  
overlap, but in most their disjunction  
becomes clear. For example, from a religious perspective, bathing (**snana**) in  
the **Ganges** River makes one pure,  
whereas from a hygienic perspective the  
lower reaches of the Ganges are quite  
heavily polluted.  
On a personal level, purity can be  
best described as the absence of defilement, gained through removing impurities in some manner, most often by  
bathing. After becoming purified, one  
remains pure until coming into contact  
with a source of impurity. These sources

of impurity include essential bodily  
functions, such as urination and evacuation; sexual activity; contact with  
impure things both inside and outside  
one’s home; and even contact with certain groups of people deemed impure.  
Thus, although purity is always easy to  
regain, it is impossible to retain, since it  
is breached by many of the actions of  
everyday life. It is also important to realize that impurity brings no moral stigma  
to an individual—becoming impure  
means simply that one has come into  
contact with some contaminant, and  
that this must be removed. The only  
times when purity is particularly important are in **worship** and in **eating**—the  
former to keep from contaminating  
the **deities** and their environs, the latter  
to protect oneself, since the circumstances surrounding what one eats  
are considered to have long-term effects  
on an individual.  
Aside from its personal dimension,  
purity has a social dimension as well.  
Higher status groups, such as **brahmins**, are considered to have inherently  
higher ritual purity. This social dimension of purity comes with **birth** and is  
the religious basis determining the  
hierarchical divisions in the traditional  
social system. To some extent, a  
group’s purity level corresponds to its  
hereditary occupation. People who  
had continual contact with substances  
considered impure (such as latrine  
cleaners, **corpse** burners, and scavengers) were seen as tainted by work,  
and rendered impure. Brahmins, as  
scholars and priests (the latter a task  
that brought them in contact with the  
gods), were the purest. Between these  
extremes fell the other groups, whose  
relative status in a specific locale was  
determined by local factors. For theoretical consideration of the importance that purity plays in modern  
Hindu life, see Louis Dumont, *Homo*  
*Hierarchicus*, 1980; for another analysis of social ordering, see McKim
