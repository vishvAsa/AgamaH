+++
(“five [products of the] **cow**”) A mixture  
of cow’s milk, curds, clarified butter  
(ghee), urine, and dung. Since each of  
these products comes from the sacred  
cow, it is considered a ritually purifying  
substance. Panchagavya is drunk for  
purification during rituals of expiation  
(**prayashchitta**), and it can also be used  
in other rituals used to purify people,  
objects, and places.
