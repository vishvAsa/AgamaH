title = "Polygamy"

+++
Given the overwhelmingly patriarchal  
character of Hindu society, polygamy  
has probably existed since very early  
times. The practice is attested in both  
the great epics, the **Ramayana** and the  
**Mahabharata**, as well as in the historical record. The **dharma literature**  
permits men to marry wives of lower  
social status, under the condition that  
their first wife was of equal status.  
Despite the existence of polygamy,  
it was probably unusual and restricted  
to men of high status and financial  
resources, who would be able to support  
several families. For “regular” men,  
one of the few reasons for taking a second wife was when the first wife was  
unable to bear children, in an attempt to  
sire the sons needed to preserve the  
lineage and ensure performance of the  
ancestral rites.
