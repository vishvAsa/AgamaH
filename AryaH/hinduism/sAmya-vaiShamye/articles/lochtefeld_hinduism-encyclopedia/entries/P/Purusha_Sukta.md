(“Hymn to the Primeval Man”) The most  
common name for the hymn in the **Rg**  
**Veda** (10.90) that describes the creation  
of the material and social world as the  
result of a primordial **sacrifice**.  
According to the text, in the beginning  
there was one primeval man, who was  
dismembered in sacrifice. Different  
parts of his body became different parts  
of the physical universe, as well as the  
four traditional major social groups  
(**varnas**): the **brahmins** came from the  
primeval man’s mouth, the **kshatriyas**  
from his shoulders, the **vaishyas** from  
his thighs (a common euphemism for  
the genitals), and the **shudras** from his  
feet. This hymn clearly reflects the sacrificial paradigm that was so central to the  
later **Brahmana** literature, and is thus  
believed to be one of the latest hymns in  
the Rg Veda. It is also notable for giving  
the first known articulation of the four  
varnas, as well as the symbolic functions  
associated with each: for brahmins,  
speech and the authority of the sacred  
word; for kshatriyas, protection and  
military valor; for vaishyas, generation  
and production, and for shudras, service  
to others.
