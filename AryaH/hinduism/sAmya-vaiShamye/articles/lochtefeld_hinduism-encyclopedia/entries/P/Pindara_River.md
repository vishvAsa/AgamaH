title = "Pindara River"

+++
A Himalayan tributary of the **Ganges**.  
The Pindara River flows west from the  
Pindari glacier and joins the  
**Alakananda River** at the town of  
**Karnaprayag**. As with all the Himalayan  
510  
Philosophy  
tributaries of the Ganges, the Pindara is  
considered sacred along its length, but  
this region is so mountainous and so  
thinly settled that Karnaprayag is the  
riverâ€™s only noteworthy spot.
