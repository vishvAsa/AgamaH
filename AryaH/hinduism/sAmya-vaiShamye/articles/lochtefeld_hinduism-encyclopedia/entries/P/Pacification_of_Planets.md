title = "Pacification of Planets"

+++
Indian astrology (**jyotisha**) recognizes  
nine “**planets**”: the **sun**, **moon**,  
**Mercury**, **Venus**, **Mars**, **Jupiter**, and  
**Saturn**; the remaining two are **Rahu** and  
**Ketu**, which do not correspond to any  
Western astrological features. Each of  
these planets is considered helpful or  
harmful by nature. The relative strength  
of any planet is believed to depend on  
its position in the horoscope and vis-à-  
vis the other planets. All are seen as  
minor divinities rather than as simple  
material objects, and thus a potentially  
harmful planet can be “pacified”  
through rites intended to minimize its  
disruptive potential. One common  
means of pacification is to wear the  
**gemstone** corresponding to the particular planet, so that the stone can neutralize the planet’s force. More inauspicious  
cases demand stronger measures, often  
involving rites in which the planetary  
**inauspiciousness** is given away through  
the medium of gifts (**dana**). For further  
consideration see Gloria Goodwin  
Raheja, *The Poison in the Gift*, 1988. See  
also **Suryia**.
