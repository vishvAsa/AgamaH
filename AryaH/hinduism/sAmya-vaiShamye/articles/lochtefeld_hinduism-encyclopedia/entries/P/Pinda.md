title = "Pinda"

+++
(“lump”) A ball of cooked rice or other  
grain, one of the important objects used  
in rites for the dead. A pinda is offered to  
the departed spirit each day for the first  
ten days after death, in the belief that  
the ten pindas progressively help form a  
new body for the dead person (a secondary meaning of the word *pinda* is  
“body”). Pindas are also used in the  
memorial rite known as **shraddha**,  
which can be performed years after the  
actual death; in this rite, the performer  
offers pindas to his or her ancestors as  
symbolic nourishment.
