title = "Paramatman"

+++
(“the highest self”) Term generally used  
as a synonym for **Brahman**, the unqualified and undifferentiated reality that is  
seen as the source of all things, and the  
sole true power in the universe. This  
name, through its inclusion of the Self  
(**atman**) as part of the term, also emphasizes the identity in kind between  
Brahman and atman, between Supreme  
Reality and the individual Self.
