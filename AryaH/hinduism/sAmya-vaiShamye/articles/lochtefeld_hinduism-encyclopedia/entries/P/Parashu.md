(“battle-axe”) A characteristic object in  
Hindu iconography, and one that  
appears in various forms—sometimes  
with a very light, thin handle and a larger  
head, at other times with a handle the  
size of a club (**gada**) and a very small,  
thin head. This weapon has the  
strongest mythic associations with  
**Vishnu’s** sixth **avatar** or incarnation,  
**Parashuram**, who uses it in his war of  
extermination against the the ruling  
**kshatriya** class when their pride has  
grown too strong. The battle-axe is also  
commonly carried by the god **Ganesh**  
and signifies his power to cut through  
obstacles and impediments. It also commonly appears in various images of the  
deities **Shiva**, **Vishnu**, and the **Goddess**,  
as one among their galaxy of weapons.
