title = "Putana"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Putana is one of  
the **demon** assassins sent by **Kamsa**,  
the king of **Mathura**, in an attempt to  
kill his nephew, the child-god **Krishna**.  
Through her **magic** powers, Putana  
assumes the form of a beautiful young  
woman and, after cooing over Krishna  
for awhile, puts him to suckle at her poisoned breast. When Krishna latches on,  
however, it is Putana who is in dire troubleâ€”Krishna sucks at her breast so hard  
that he sucks the life right out of her. As  
she dies, she reverts to her original form,  
gigantic and hideous, and the crash of  
her falling body shakes the earth and  
fells trees.
