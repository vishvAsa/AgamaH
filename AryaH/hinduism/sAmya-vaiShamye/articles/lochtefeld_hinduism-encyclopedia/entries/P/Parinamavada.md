(“transformation-relationship”) Philosophical perspective that explains the  
relationship between the Ultimate  
Reality or realities and the perceivable  
world, and describes the world as a genuine transformation of this reality.  
This position is espoused by proponents of the **Samkhya**, **Vishishthadvaita**  
**Vedanta**, and **Bhedabhada** philosophical schools. All three of these are  
proponents of a **causal model** called  
**satkaryavada**. The satkaryavada model  
assumes that effects preexist in their  
causes, and that, when these effects  
appear, they are transformations (parinama) of those causes. The classic  
example for this model is the transformation of milk to curds, butter, and clarified butter: each of these effects was  
501  
Parinamavada  
already present in the cause, emerges  
from it through a natural transformation  
of that cause, and is causally related to it.  
All three schools believe that the  
world as perceived is real and has some  
single ultimate source behind it: for the  
Samkhyas, the first principles are  
**purusha** and **prakrti**, for the  
Vishishthadvaita school, the god  
**Vishnu**, and for the Bhedabhada school,  
**Brahman**. All believe that real things  
come into being because these first  
principles undergo real transformations. Parinamavada allows for an explanation of the phenomenal world that  
compromises the transcendence of  
these first principles by making them  
part of the world. Philosophically, their  
difficulties arise in describing how the  
transcendent can become mundane,  
and then become transcendent again.  
The transformation relationship is  
vehemently opposed by the **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** philosophical school, which  
upholds a philosophical position  
known as monism (the belief that a  
single Ultimate Reality lies behind all  
things, and that all things are merely  
differing forms of that reality). Advaita  
proponents claim that reality is nondual (**advaita**)—that is, that all things  
are “actually” the formless, unqualified **Brahman**, despite the appearance  
of difference and diversity in the  
world. Since Brahman is the only real  
thing, and Brahman never changes,  
the parinama model is a fundamental  
misunderstanding of the ultimate  
nature of things, since it assumes real  
change. The Advaita proponents’  
explanation for the nature of the relationship and the world is known as  
**vivartavada** (“illusory manifestation”), in which the ultimate appears  
to become transformed but in reality  
never changes. For further information see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
