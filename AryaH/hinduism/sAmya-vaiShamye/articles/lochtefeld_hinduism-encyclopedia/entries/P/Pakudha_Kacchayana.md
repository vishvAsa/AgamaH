title = "Pakudha Kacchayana"

+++
An atomistic early Indian philosopher  
whose views are mentioned in the  
Buddhist scriptures. As these scriptures  
portray him, Pakudha believed that  
seven things were eternal, unmoving,  
and unchanging—the four elements,  
ease, pain, and the soul. According to  
Pakudha, when a sword cuts a person’s  
head in two, no one is deprived of life,  
rather the sword merely penetrates the  
interval between two elementary substances (presumably the soul and the  
material part of the person’s body). This  
example seems to suggest an antisocial  
ethos, but beyond this, very little is  
known about him.
