(“illumination”) In Hindu **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based religious practice,  
prakasha is one of the bipolar opposites that are used to characterize the  
nature of all reality, with its counterpart being reflection (**vimarsha**).  
These two terms are particularly  
important for the creation of the world,  
which is said to happen when the pure  
and radiant consciousness (prakasha)  
of the ultimate **Brahman** becomes  
self-conscious through the reflection  
(vimarsha) of this original consciousness. From one single consciousness,  
the absolute then evolves into a binary  
divinity—the god **Shiva** and his consort **Shakti**—whose continued interaction combines to create the world. For  
further information see Jaideva Singh,  
*Pratyabhijnanahrdayam*, 1982. See  
also **cosmology**.
