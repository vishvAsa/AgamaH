One of the two influential “schools” of  
Indian **miniature painting**, the other  
being the **Rajasthani**. The distinctions  
between schools are geographical and  
thus somewhat arbitrary, since, for  
example, the **Basohli** paintings belong  
to the Pahari school, but are stylistically  
closer to those of **Rajasthan** than to the  
later Pahari style.  
The Pahari style flourished in the  
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in  
the small kingdoms in the **Shiwalik Hills**  
north and west of Delhi. It first appears  
in the kingdom of **Basohli**, where the  
influence of the Rajasthani school is the  
clearest, and later developed in the kingdoms of **Jammu**, **Guler**, **Garhwal**, and  
**Kangra**. The developed Pahari style differs from the Rajasthani in its emphasis  
on more linear drawing—perhaps influenced by European art—and a more  
restrained use of color, both features  
tending to give the paintings a more lyrical feel. For further information see
