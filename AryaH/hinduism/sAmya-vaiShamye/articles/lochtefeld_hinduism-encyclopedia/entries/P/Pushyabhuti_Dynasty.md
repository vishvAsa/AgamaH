title = "Pushyabhuti Dynasty"

+++
(6th–7th c.) Northern Indian dynasty  
whose capital was at **Kanyakubja**, the  
modern city of **Kanuaj** in the **Ganges**  
river basin, and whose territory ran  
through the northern Indian plain from  
the **Punjab** to **Bihar**. The Pushyabhutis  
filled the northern Indian political  
vacuum after the demise of the Gupta  
empire and in some measure regained  
its greatness. The dynasty’s greatest  
ruler was the emperor **Harsha**  
(r. 606–47), whose reign was chronicled  
in panegyric fashion by the playwright  
**Bana**, and perhaps more factually by the  
Chinese Buddhist pilgrim **Hsuan Tsang**.  
The latter’s journals give a detailed  
picture both of Harsha himself, in whose  
court Hsuan Tsang stayed for some time,  
and of everyday life in Harsha’s  
kingdom. See also **Gupta dynasty**.
