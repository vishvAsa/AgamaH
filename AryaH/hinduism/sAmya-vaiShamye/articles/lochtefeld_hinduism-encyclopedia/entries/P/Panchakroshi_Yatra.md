title = "Panchakroshi Yatra"

+++
A circular journey (**yatra**) in which pilgrims circumambulate the outer boundary of **Kashi** (the largest of the three  
concentric ritual areas contained in the  
city of **Benares**) and visit 108 shrines  
along the way. The journeyâ€™s length is  
reckoned at five kroshas (roughly ten  
miles), hence the name. The journey  
measures out the boundaries of the  
sacred city, and thus pilgrims symbolically circle the entire world. Although  
the best known Panchakroshi Yatra is in  
Benares, and the name is most commonly associated with this place, many  
other sacred sites (**tirthas**) have similar  
pilgrimage routes, and this process of a  
circular journey around a sacred spot is  
a common ritual motif.
