title = "Parikshit"

+++
Mythic king in the **Lunar Line**, who  
serves as an example that one’s fate cannot be escaped. Parikshit is the grandson of **Arjuna**, one of the five **Pandava**  
brothers who are the protagonists in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics.  
Parikshit inherits the throne from  
**Yudhishthira**, Arjuna’s elder brother,  
and according to tradition rules righteously for sixty years, but it is his death  
that is best remembered. Fond of hunting, Parikshit one day comes across a  
meditating sage while he is chasing a  
wounded deer. When the sage refuses to  
answer to his inquiries about the deer,  
Parikshit grows angry and, with his bow,  
drapes a dead cobra around the sage’s  
neck. The sage remains unaware of this,  
but his **son** finds out about it when his  
playmates jeer at him. Furious, the son  
lays a curse that the person responsible  
will be fatally bitten within seven days  
by the great serpent **Takshaka**. When he  
discovers that the king is responsible,  
the son repents his **curse** to the King.  
Parikshit takes all possible precautions to avoid his fate. He builds a house  
on a huge pillar, has anything brought  
into the house carefully searched, and  
surrounds himself with physicians who  
can cure snakebite. After six days without incident, the king begins to relax his  
vigilance. As the seventh day is ending,  
Takshaka conceals himself as a worm in  
a piece of fruit, changes into his real  
shape when the fruit is cut open, and  
bites the king, killing him.
