title = "Panchavati"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, the place where  
three of the epic’s central characters—  
the god-king **Rama**, his wife **Sita**, and  
his brother **Lakshmana**—live during  
much of their fourteen years of forest  
exile. It is from here that Sita is kidnapped by **Ravana**, the **demon**-king of  
**Lanka**. Although the events in the  
*Ramayana* cannot be definitively set in  
any specific place, there is a village  
named Panchavati, outside the city of  
**Nasik** in the state of **Maharashtra**,  
which is identified with the mythic site.
