title = "Panchayatana (“five-abode”) Puja"

+++
Type of **worship** (**puja**) performed by  
**Smarta** brahmins, a group of **brahmins**  
distinguished, not by region or family,  
but by the religious texts they hold most  
authoritative—in this case, those known  
as the **smrtis** rather than sectarian religious texts. The panchayatana puja is  
marked by the simultaneous worship of  
five different **deities**—usually **Vishnu**,  
**Shiva**, **Surya**, **Ganesh**, and the **Goddess**.  
Individual Smartas may choose one or  
another from among these as their primary deity, but all these deities are ritually honored since they are all  
considered manifestations of the divine.
