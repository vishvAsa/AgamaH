title = "Parmananddas"

+++
(early 16th c.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions of  
these eight poets were used for liturgical  
purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community whose members are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. In the Pushti  
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight  
are also named as members of the community and as associates of either the  
502  
Parivartini Ekadashi  
community’s founder, **Vallabhacharya**,  
or his successor **Vitthalnath**. Little is  
known about Parmananddas himself,  
although tradition asserts that he was a  
**Kanaujia brahmin**, and the corpus of  
poetry attributed to him is much larger  
in later sources, suggesting that his  
name was used by later writers. The evidence from the earliest sources suggests  
that he was a devoted follower of  
Vallabhacharya. Much of his poetry is  
specifically written for the Pushti Marg,  
such as hymns in praise of  
Vallabhacharya, or hymns to be sung for  
the **worship** of Krishna throughout the  
day, a form of piety that came to characterize the Pushti Marg. To date, his  
works have not been translated, perhaps  
because of their sectarian character.
