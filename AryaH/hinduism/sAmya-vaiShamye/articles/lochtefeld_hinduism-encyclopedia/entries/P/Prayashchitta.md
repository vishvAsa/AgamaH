title = "Prayashchitta"

+++
A general term meaning atonement for  
oneâ€™s misdeeds. The Hindu religious tradition gives considerable attention to  
penance and expiation, based on the  
almost universal Hindu belief in the  
inexorable workings of **karma**.  
According to this notion, all good and  
bad deeds will eventually have their  
effect, either in this life or the next, and  
thus one must either atone for the evil  
one has done or face its consequences  
in the future. Prescriptions for such  
expiation can be found as far back as the  
**Vedas**, and the acts prescribed for  
atonement fall into several categories:  
confession, repentance (which was usually seen as preparation for expiation,  
rather than absolution of the evil itself),  
restraint of breath (**pranayama**), physical **asceticism** (**tapas**), **fire sacrifice**  
(**homa**), recitation of prayers (**japa**),  
gift-giving (**dana**), fasting (**upavasa**),  
and travel to sacred sites (**tirthayatra**).  
The prayashchitta literature is quite  
well developed, both in detailing  
differing kinds of offenses and their  
potentially mitigating circumstances,  
and in laying out the types of atonement  
to be performed for each offense. For
