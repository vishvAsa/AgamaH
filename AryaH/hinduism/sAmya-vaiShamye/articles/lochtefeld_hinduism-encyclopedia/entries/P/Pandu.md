title = "Pandu"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, the son of the sage  
**Vyasa** and queen **Ambalika**. Pandu and  
his brother **Dhrtarashtra** are born as the  
result of a desperate attempt to preserve  
the royal line of King **Shantanu** after  
Shantanu’s son **Vichitravirya** dies without heirs. Upon Vichitravirya’s death, his  
mother **Satyavati** calls upon her eldest  
son, **Vyasa**, to sleep with Vichitravirya’s  
wives, **Ambika** and her sister Ambalika,  
in the hope that the women will conceive. According to tradition Vyasa is  
very ugly, and each woman reacts involuntarily when Vyasa appears in her bed:  
Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son  
**Dhrtarashtra** to be born blind, and  
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son  
Pandu to be born with an unnaturally  
pale complexion. Given Dhrtarashtra’s  
blindness, Pandu is the best suited to  
rule; he marries **Kunti** and **Madri** and  
lives quite happily as the king.  
This idyllic time abruptly ends one  
day while he is hunting in the forest and  
shoots a **deer** while it is mating. To his  
horror, he discovers that the deer is the  
sage **Kindama**, who has taken this form  
for sport with his wife; with his dying  
breath, the sage curses Pandu that he  
will die the moment he touches his wife  
in an amorous embrace. Since he has no  
children, and the **curse** condemns him  
to die without an heir, Pandu abdicates  
the throne in favor of his brother  
Dhrtarashtra and goes with his wives to  
live as an **ascetic** in the **Himalayas**. At  
this time Kunti tells him about the  
**mantra** she has received years before  
from the sage **Durvasas**, which gives the  
woman who recites it the power to call  
down any of the gods and to have by him  
a son equal in power to himself. With  
Pandu’s blessing Kunti and Madri bear  
five heroic sons, the five **Pandava** brothers. They all live happily together until  
one day when Pandu, swayed by the  
intoxicating influence of spring, ignores  
Madri’s warnings and embraces her. The  
sage’s curse takes effect and Pandu falls  
dead, although, through the power of  
the mantra, his family line continues.
