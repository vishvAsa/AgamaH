title = "Pala Dynasty"

+++
(8th–12th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty  
whose ancestral homeland was in **Bihar**  
but whose core territory also spanned  
most of modern Bengal. The Pala  
dynasty’s zenith came at the turn of the  
ninth century, when they controlled the  
entire northern Indian plain all the way  
into the **Punjab** region. Their rise to  
power came as a result of political instability in the Gangetic plain, and the  
Palas were quickly supplanted by the  
**Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty** while  
retaining sway over Bengal and Bihar for  
several centuries more. Their territory in  
Bengal was eventually taken by the **Sena**  
**dynasty**, and the Palas were finally conquered by the **Gahadavalas** in the middle of the twelfth century. The Palas and  
Senas are both noted for a particular  
type of **sculpture**, in which the images  
were made from black chlorite schist  
polished to a mirror finish.
