title = "Penance"

+++
The **dharma literature** gave considerable attention to penance and expiation,  
based on the almost universal Hindu  
belief in the inexorable workings of  
**karma**. According to this notion, all  
good and bad deeds would eventually  
have their effect, either in this life or the  
next. Penances were a way to lessen the  
future consequences of one’s past misdeeds, by undergoing voluntary suffering and expiation in one’s present life.  
See **prayashchitta**.
