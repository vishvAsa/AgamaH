One of the two attested disciples of  
**Shankaracharya**—the other being  
**Sureshvara**—and the founder of the  
**Vivarana** school of **Advaita Vedanta**.  
The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism,  
which is the belief that a single Ultimate  
Reality, **Brahman**, lies behind all things,  
and that all things are merely differing  
forms of that reality. Advaita proponents  
claim that reality is nondual (**advaita**)—  
that is, that, despite the appearance of  
difference and diversity, all things are  
nothing but the formless, unqualified  
Brahman. For the Advaitins, the  
assumption of diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate  
nature of things, and a manifestation of  
**avidya** (lack of genuine understanding).

The defining characteristic of  
Padmapada’s Vivarana school is that he  
places the locus of ignorance in  
Brahman, in contrast to the **Bhamati**  
school, which placed it in the individual.  
To explain how Brahman can be the  
locus of ignorance the Vivarana  
Advaitins invoke the theory of  
**Reflectionism**: Just as an image appearing in a mirror is based on the original,  
but different from it, so human selves  
are identical with Brahman, but appear  
to be separate. The basis of Padmapada’s  
position is an uncompromising affirmation of Brahman as the sole “reality,” to  
which anything that exists must belong.
