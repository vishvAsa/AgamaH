title = "Parashuram Avatar"

+++
Sixth **avatar** or incarnation of the god  
**Vishnu**. As with all the avatars of Vishnu,  
the Parashuram avatar comes to restore  
a cosmic equilibrium that has been  
thrown out of balance, in this case from  
the overweening abuse of power by the  
warrior (**kshatriya**) class. Parashuram is  
the son of **Jamadagni**, a **brahmin** sage  
whose most precious **possession** is  
Surabhi, a **cow** that will grant its owner  
any desired wish. One day when  
Parashuram is away, the king comes to  
Jamadagni’s **ashram**. When he sees the  
cow, he desires it, and when Jamadagni  
refuses to give it to him, the king takes it  
by force.  
When Parashuram learns of this, he  
becomes fiercely angry. Taking up his  
**parashu** (or battle-axe, a weapon particularly associated with him), he enters  
into battle with the king and eventually  
kills him. When the king’s sons remain  
rebellious in opposition to him,  
Parashuram makes twenty-one journeys  
around India, destroying all of the kshatriyas that he can find, in an effort to  
wipe them from the face of the earth.  
The major theme of this story is the conflict between the brahmin and kshatriya  
classes, and the realities of living in a  
society in which brahmins had religious  
authority but kshatriyas had the power  
of enforcement. This story reveals a  
strong concern for the sanctity of a  
brahmin’s possessions and highlights  
the perils of taking them by force. The  
writers behind the story were almost  
certainly brahmins, and their remarks  
on the perils of taking a brahmin’s possessions doubtless reflect an insecurity  
about their ability to supersede governmental power.  
In addition to the story of exterminating the kshatriyas, Parashuram  
appears in the epic **Mahabharata** as the  
person who teaches the heroic **Karna**  
the art of weapons and warfare. The epic  
portrays Parashuram as powerful and  
irascible, and as possessing such continuing hatred of kshatriyas that he refuses  
to take them as students. When  
Parashuram discovers that Karna is a  
kshatriya and not a brahmin, as he  
has claimed to be, he lays a curse on  
Karna that, in his hour of greatest  
500  
Parashu  
The god Vishnu’s Parashuram avatar, carrying his  
battle-axe. He appears in this form to punish the  
warrior class’ abuse of power.  
need, he will forget everything he has  
learned as his student.
