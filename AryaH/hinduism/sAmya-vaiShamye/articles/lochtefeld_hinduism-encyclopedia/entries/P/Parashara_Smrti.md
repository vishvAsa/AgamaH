title = "Parashara Smrti"

+++
One of the **smrtis** or “remembered”  
texts, a class of literature deemed important but less authoritative than the other  
textual category, the **shrutis**, or “heard”  
texts. This smrti is ascribed to the sage  
**Parashara**, and is an example of one of  
the **Dharma Shastras**, which were manuals prescribing rules for correct human  
behavior and ideal social life. Unlike the  
**Dharma Sutras**, which are ascribed to  
recognizable individuals, the Dharma  
Shastras are usually ascribed to mythic  
sages as a strategy to reinforce the  
authority of these texts. At 592 verses,  
the *Parashara Smrti* is relatively short,  
and it treats only two themes, religious  
custom (**achara**) and expiation  
(**prayashchitta**). The text is estimated  
to have been written between the  
first and fifth centuries, but in the fourteenth century it received an extensive  
commentary by **Madhava**, and the  
resulting work, known as the  
*Parasharamadhava*, has continued to  
be influential since then.
