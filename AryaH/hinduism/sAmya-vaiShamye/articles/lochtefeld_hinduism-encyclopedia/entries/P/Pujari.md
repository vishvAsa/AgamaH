title = "Pujari"

+++
In its most basic meaning, the word  
*pujari* denotes “one who does **puja**  
(**worship**).” In theory this word could  
refer to any worshiper, but in general  
usage the meaning is more restricted. It  
usually designates a man performing  
worship as his means of livelihood,  
either as a priest in a temple, or as a  
religious “technician” hired to perform  
ceremonies for others. For further information see C. J. Fuller, “Hindu Temple  
Priests,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), *Religion in*  
*India*, 1991.
