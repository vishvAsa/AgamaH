A wooden sandal used mainly by  
ascetics. It consists of a wooden sole and  
a mushroom-shaped front post, which  
is gripped with first two toes for stability.  
Padukas are used by **ascetics** not only  
because of their cheapness and durability, but because they are completely free  
of animal products such as **leather**,  
which are considered impure. Aside

Paduka  
Man sitting in the padmasana, or lotus posture. This sitting position is often used in yoga and meditation.  
from their functional use as footwear,  
after death an ascetic’s padukas will  
often be kept by his (or, more rarely, her)  
disciples, as a sign of their **guru’s** symbolic presence.
