(“lotus”) One of the richest symbols in  
Indian **philosophy** and iconography,  
both Hindu and Buddhist, and an  
invariably auspicious object. Its size and  
colors make it one of the most beautiful  
Indian flowers, but the lotus is also a  
potent symbol for spiritual realization. It  
is rooted in the mud—symbolizing the  
corrupting world with which all beings  
must contend—but it blooms above the  
surface of the water, signifying transcendence. The lotus plant’s underwater  
stems grow as long as necessary to get  
the flower bud above the water’s surface—whether three, five, or ten feet—  
symbolizing the human ability to  
overcome obstacles to spiritual  
progress. Finally, lotus leaves are covered with a waxy coating, upon which  
water beads up and flows off; one religious text, the **Bhagavad Gita** (5.10),  
uses this as a simile for the man who  
renounces all attachment and is  
untouched by the things of the world.  
Aside from its symbolic content, the  
lotus is also an important element in  
Hindu iconography. It is one of the four  
identifying objects carried by the god  
**Vishnu**, along with the conch shell  
(**shankha**), club (**gada**), and discus  
(**chakra**). It is also commonly carried by  
the **Goddess**, both in her forms as **Durga**  
and related powerful goddesses, and in  
her beneficent and benevolent form as  
**Lakshmi**, who is usually portrayed as  
standing on a lotus. The lotus even figures in one of the common Hindu creation myths, in which a lotus sprouts  
from Vishnu’s navel and opens to reveal  
**Brahma**, who proceeds to create the  
earth. When the universe has run its  
course and is about to be destroyed,  
same process happens in reverse.
