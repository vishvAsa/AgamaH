title = "Papankusha Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh **day** (**ekadashi**) of the bright  
(waxing) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Ashvin** (September–October). As with  
all the eleventh-day observances, it is  
dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**.  
Most Hindu festivals have certain  
prescribed rites, which usually involve  
fasting (**upavasa**) and worship (**puja**),  
and often promise specific benefits for  
faithful performance. This ekadashi’s  
name indicates that it is the goad  
(**ankusha**) to drive away all evil (**pap**),  
here fancifully conceived as an **elephant**.  
Thus, faithfully observing this festival is  
believed to cleanse one of all one’s sins.
