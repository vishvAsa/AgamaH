(“recognition”) Doctrine advanced by  
many different schools of **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually defined religious practice, and particularly by the Kashmiri  
philosopher **Abhinavagupta**, the most  
influential figure in **Trika** Shaivism. It  
holds that the final realization of the  
Absolute is simply a “re-cognition” of  
one’s essential unity with the Divine.  
This unity has always existed and has  
never been altered, the only factor preventing it from being clearly seen being  
the obscuring power of false understanding. Final unity with the Divine,  
therefore, comes not through doing anything, but simply through realizing what  
has always been the case. This doctrine  
clearly shows the influence of the  
**Advaita Vedanta** philosophical school,  
but with an important shift. The Advaita  
school upholds a philosophical position  
known as monism, which is the belief  
that a single abstract ultimate principle—which they call **Brahman**—lies  
behind all things, and that all things are  
only particular manifestations of that  
one principle. The “Recognition” school  
524  
Pratihara Dynasty  
adopts this general principle but conceives of Ultimate Reality theistically,  
as the god **Shiva**. For Trika Shaivism,  
Shiva is the sole true reality, who is  
both supreme god, and the source of  
the material universe. For further  
information see Jaideva Singh, *Pratyabhijnanahrdayam*, 1982.
