title = "Prarthana Samaj"

+++
Hindu reformist organization centered  
in Bombay, whose most important figure was M. G. **Ranade** (1842–1901). The  
Prarthana Samaj’s reformist mission  
focused more on social issues than on  
theological or **worship**-related ones.  
Their primary aim was to rid Hindu  
society of “evils” such as child marriage  
and the ban on **widow** remarriage.  
Although its members were educated  
and progressive, they were also religiously conservative and devout Hindus  
with deep roots in the tradition. They  
saw their work as a slow and gradual  
process of reforming Hinduism by  
removing its most objectionable practices rather than by radically remaking it  
from start. In this they differed from the  
522  
Pranapratishtha  
**Brahmo Samaj**, who attempted to  
remake the tradition wholesale by  
giving it a strong, quasi-monotheistic  
emphasis, a quality heavily influenced  
by European missionaries. The  
Prarthana Samaj lost its steam by  
the early 1920s, when social reform  
associations became absorbed into the  
Indian National Congress.
