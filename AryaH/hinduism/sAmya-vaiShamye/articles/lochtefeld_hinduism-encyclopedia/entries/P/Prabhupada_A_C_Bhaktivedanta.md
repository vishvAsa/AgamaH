(b. Abhay Charan De, 1896–1977)  
Devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna**  
and founder of **ISKCON** (International  
Society for Krishna Consciousness),  
more popularly known as the Hare  
Krishnas. ISKCON has its roots in the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious community  
founded by the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**,  
in which the primary religious action  
was the repeated recitation of Krishna’s  
name, often in public settings.  
Prabhupada was initiated into Krishna  
devotion in his university years, at  
which time his **guru** commanded him to  
bring the **worship** of Krishna to the  
West. At the age of 58, after a successful  
career as a pharmacist, he boarded a  
steamer for the United States, arriving  
with a few books, a typewriter, and eight  
dollars in his pocket. His timing was  
exquisite—or, as he put it, reflected  
Krishna’s **grace**—for he came during  
the countercultural movement in the  
second half of the 1960s; by the time of  
his death he had thousands of followers.  
In his later years he focused on translating and commenting on important  
**Vaishnava** texts, particularly the  
**Bhagavad Gita** and the **Bhagavata**  
**Purana**, and this emphasis on publishing has continued after his death.
