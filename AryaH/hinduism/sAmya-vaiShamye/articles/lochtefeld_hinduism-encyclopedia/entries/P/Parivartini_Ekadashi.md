title = "Parivartini Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the bright  
(waxing) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Bhadrapada** (August–September). As are  
all the eleventh-day observances, this is  
dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**. This  
day is particularly devoted to the worship of Vishnu’s wife **Lakshmi**, the **goddess** presiding over wealth and  
prosperity. In her form as **Mahalakshmi**  
(as told in the **Devimahatmya**) she is  
able to kill **demons** that the gods cannot,  
and restore to gods the kingdom they  
have lost. This festival occurs during the  
time Vishnu is believed to be sleeping on  
the serpent **Shesha**, on an ocean of milk,  
with Lakshmi massaging his feet. The  
name Parivartini means “turning,” and  
on this day Vishnu is believed to be stirring in his sleep. See also **ocean, churning of the**; and **cosmology**.
