A hereditary priest who assists pilgrims  
with any rituals they may need or desire  
to perform, and also with any other  
needs that the pilgrims may have. Each  
panda family in any given pilgrimage  
place (**tirtha**) has the exclusive rights to  
serve pilgrims coming from a particular  
geographical area or areas; pilgrims are  
supposed to seek out the panda serving  
their native region, whether or not the  
pilgrims still live in that place. On every  
visit, pilgrims will make an entry in the  
panda’s pilgrim register (**bahi**), detailing  
the names of those who visited and the  
reason that they came. Some of these  
registers date back hundreds of years,  
and the documents are the ultimate  
proof of the hereditary connection  
between panda and pilgrim families. In  
earlier times this hereditary relationship  
was essential for the pilgrims, since their  
connection with their pandas provided  
resources while traveling—lodging,  
food, and other sorts of support. The  
pandas would minister to their clients,  
arrange for any needed rites, and even  
lend them money, if necessary. Pilgrims  
would usually give the panda a token  
gift when they departed, along with a  
pledge for some larger amount, which  
the pandas would travel to their homes  
to pick up.  
Although pandas are often characterized as greedy and rapacious—based on  
their tendency to demand what they  
think a client is able to pay—in its ideal  
form both parties benefit from the relationship. In recent years, the pandas  
have become less central figures in

Panchayatana (“five-abode”) Puja  
many pilgrimage places, and consequently, their status and their income  
have declined. Many pilgrimage places  
have been developed as sites for religious tourism, and hotels and facilities  
that have been built at these places have  
rendered pilgrims less dependent on  
their pandas for accommodation. At the  
same time, recent years have seen a general decline in the performance of ritual  
acts, except for the most important, particularly those connected with death.
