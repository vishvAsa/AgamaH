title = "Puja"

(“homage”) The most common word for  
**worship** in modern Hinduism. The root  
of the word carries the sense of reverence or respect, but puja is primarily  
focused on actions, particularly **offerings** to the **deity**, who is treated as an  
honored guest. Although, according to  
one list, there are sixteen such offerings  
(**upacharas**), in practice the worship  
performed in any particular setting is  
subject to wide variation—based on  
regional or local custom, individual  
inclination, and the person’s social status and learning. At the heart of puja,  
however, is a series of transactions  
between the deity and devotee (**bhakta**).  
One such transaction comes in **darshan**,  
the exchange of glances between  
an image of the deity and a devotee,  
which initiates the relationship between  
the two. The other transactions come  
from offerings given by the devotee, to  
which the deity responds by giving  
**prasad** sanctified by divine contact,  
most often food or drink for the devotee  
to consume.  
Aside from the transactions, the  
other most common feature of most  
puja is the emphasis on **purity**, both of  
worshiper and of context. The only  
exception to this arises in certain forms  
of **tantra**, a secret, ritually based religious practice in which the performer  
deliberately inverts normal ideas of  
purity and impurity (**ashaucha**) as a way  
of symbolically destroying all duality.

Puja  
Devotees commonly purify themselves  
before worship, and the purity of the  
site, and the objects used in worship,  
must be either established (in the case  
of a place or things not generally used  
for worship) or maintained (as in the  
case of a temple or other regularly established place).  
In its most basic conception, the  
temple is a home for the deity, a ritually  
pure environment. Most temples have at  
least two different “purity zones,” an  
outer zone into which the devotees may  
enter, and an inner zone closest to deity,  
restricted to the temple priests. In their  
purity requirements, deities show as  
much variation as one finds in the  
human community, and stricter concern for purity indicates higher status,  
just as for human beings. Whereas **village deities** are often served by non**brahmin** priests and typically take  
offerings of meat, **blood**, and **liquor**, the  
higher deities are always served by brahmin priests, and the food offered to  
them is invariably vegetarian. As the ritually purest of all human beings, the  
brahmin priest acts as an intermediary  
between the high deities and other worshipers, shielding the deity from potentially contaminating contact. His high  
ritual purity also makes the brahmin a  
universal donor, from whose hand all  
people can receive prasad without fear  
of pollution. For further information see
