title = "Pipa"

+++
(15th c.?) Poet-saint in the **Sant** religious  
community. The name *Sant* is an  
umbrella term for a group of central and  
northern Indian poet-saints who share  
several general tendencies: focus on  
individualized, interior religion leading  
to a personal experience of the divine;  
disdain for external ritual, particularly  
image **worship**; faith in the power of  
repeating one’s patron deity’s name; and  
the tendency to ignore conventional  
**caste** distinctions.  
According to tradition, Pipa was born  
into a **Rajput** royal family in the **Malwa**  
region but eventually renounced his  
throne and went to **Benares** to become a  
disciple of the poet-saint **Ramananda**.  
The hagiographer **Nabhadas** reports  
that Pipa was a disciple of the powerful  
**goddess** Bhavani (an epithet of **Parvati**),  
showing the breadth of the Sant tradition. A few of Pipa’s verses have been  
preserved in the **Adigranth**, the sacred  
text of the Sikh community, and in their  
language and religious thrust the verses  
are consistent with these traditions.
