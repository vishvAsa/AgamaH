title = "Purva (“Earlier”) Mimamsa"

+++
One of the **six schools** of traditional  
Hindu **philosophy**, most commonly  
referred to simply as Mimamsa (“investigation”); it was given the name Purva  
Mimamsa to distinguish it from the  
Uttara (“Later”) Mimamsa school, better  
known as **Vedanta**. The Mimamsa  
school’s name is quite apt, for it emphasizes the investigation of **dharma**  
(“righteous action”), particularly as  
revealed in the **Vedas**, the earliest and  
most authoritative Hindu religious texts.  
Mimamsas affirmed that the Vedas were  
the source of perfect knowledge, and  
believed that the Vedas had not been  
composed either by God or by human  
beings but were rather simply heard  
by the ancient sages through their  
advanced powers of perception, and  
then transmitted orally from generation  
to generation.  
Since they accepted the Vedas as the  
primary source of authority and assumed  
that the Vedas contained codes and prescriptions pertaining to dharma, the  
Mimamsas then developed complex  
rules for textual interpretation to discern these, and it is for these rules that  
they are best known. Mimamsas  
believed in the existence of the soul and  
in the necessary connection of actions  
with their results inherent in the notion  
of **karma**—two ideas attested to in the  
Vedas. In cases where the result of an  
action comes some time after the act, the  
Mimamsas believed that the result existed  
as an unseen force called **apurva**. This  
force would invariably bring on the result,  
thus maintaining the Vedic truth. The  
Mimamsas were less unified on the existence of God. **Jaimini** (4th c. B.C.E.?), the  
author of the **Mimamsa Sutras** and the  
founder of the school, seems to ignore the  
issue completely, and 1,000 years later  
another Mimamsa luminary, **Kumarila**,  
argued against the existence of God.  
Aside from developing methods for  
interpreting the Vedas, Mimamsas also  
contributed to logic and epistemology.  
One of their notable contributions was  
postulating two new **pramanas**, which  
are the means by which human beings  
can gain true and accurate knowledge.  
All the philosophical schools accepted  
perception (**pratyaksha**) as a pramana,  
and most also accepted inference (**anumana**) and authoritative testimony  
(**shabda**). The two new modes developed by the Mimamsas were “presumption” (**arthapatti**) and “knowledge from  
absence” (**abhava**). The Mimamsas justified these additions by claiming that  
they accounted for knowledge that  
could not be subsumed under the existing pramanas. Arthapatti is an inference  
from circumstance, in which a judgment is made about one case based  
solely on similarities to related cases. An  
537  
Purva (“Earlier”) Mimamsa  
example would be the presumption that  
a traveler had reached his or her destination after the train’s arrival time had  
passed. According to Indian philosophy,  
this is not a true inference, since the latter must always be confirmed by direct  
perception. In the same way, abhava or  
the perception of any absence (e.g., the  
absence of some object before one)  
could not be accounted for by any of  
the existing pramanas, and thus  
required this new one to explain it.  
Aside from Jaimini, the two most significant figures among the Mimamsas  
are Kumarila and **Prabhakara**, who  
both lived in the seventh century. For
