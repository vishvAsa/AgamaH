(“favor”) Prasad is food or drink that has  
been offered to a **deity** as part of normal  
**worship** and, having been sanctified by  
the deity’s power, is later distributed to  
worshipers as a symbol of the deity’s  
**grace**. In this process, the deity is  
believed to have “consumed” part of the  
food **offering**, and thus—in keeping  
with everyday ideas about the contaminating power of saliva—to have  
“imprinted” the food with its substance.  
Since this substance has been “charged”  
with divine presence, it is given to devotees (**bhakta**) as an emblem of the  
deity’s grace, and worshipers consume it  
in the belief that this sanctifies them. Its  
sacred qualities mean that prasad is  
treated differently than regular food: It  
cannot be refused and can never be  
thrown away. If one cannot eat it, the  
favored method of disposal is to feed it  
to a **cow**. See also **jutha**.
