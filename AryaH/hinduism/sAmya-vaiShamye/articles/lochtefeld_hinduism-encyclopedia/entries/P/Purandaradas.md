(1480â€“1564) A devotee (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Vishnu** who was the founder of the  
**Haridasas**, a sect of saint-composers in  
the southern Indian state of **Karnataka**.  
Aside from the literary merits of the  
poetry Purandaradas wrote, the musical  
structure of his songs is believed to have  
laid the foundations for the Karnatic  
school of Indian music, the predominant musical form in southern India.
