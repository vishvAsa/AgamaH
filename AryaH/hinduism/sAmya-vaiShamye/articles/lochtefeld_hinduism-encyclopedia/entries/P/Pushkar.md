(“blue lotus”) City and celebrated sacred  
site (**tirtha**) a few miles north and west  
of the city of Ajmer in the state of  
**Rajasthan**. Pushkar’s center is a natural  
lake, and its major importance is as a  
bathing (**snana**) place—according to  
tradition, its lake is so holy that Pushkar  
is said to be the religious preceptor  
(**guru**) of all other sacred sites. Pushkar’s  
lake is surrounded by temples. Of these,  
the best-known is dedicated to the god  
**Brahma** and is his only temple in all of  
India. Two nearby temples dedicated to  
the **Goddess** are said to be **Shakti**  
**Pithas**, a network of sites spread  
throughout the subcontinent and  
sacred to the Goddess. Each Shakti Pitha  
marks the site where a body part of the  
dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to earth.  
The two temples in Pushkar mark the  
places where both of Sati’s wrists fell.  
Pushkar’s largest festival is known as  
**Kartik Purnima** (October–November),  
and falls on a **full moon** (generally associated with enhancing the sanctity of  
bathing places). Aside from being a time  
for bathing, this event is also marked by  
the holding of an enormous livestock  
market, particularly for camels and  
horses. The state government is currently  
promoting this as a tourist attraction,  
and it has drawn over 200,000 people in  
recent years. See also **pitha**.
