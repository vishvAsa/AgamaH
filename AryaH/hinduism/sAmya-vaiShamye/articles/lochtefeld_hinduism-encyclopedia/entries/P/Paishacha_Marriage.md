title = "Paishacha Marriage"

+++
One of the eight ways to perform a marriage recognized in the **dharma literature**, the treatises on religious duty.  
Paishachas are a class of **demons**, so a  
marriage named after them is already  
suspect. The Paishacha marriage takes  
place when a man has intercourse with a  
woman who is drunk, unconscious, or  
asleep. Not surprisingly, this is one of  
the four reprehensible (**aprashasta**)  
forms of marriage, and because of the  
woman’s lack of conscious awareness,  
this form was forbidden, even though it  
was deemed a valid marriage. Here the  
writers’ concern seems to have been to  
give the “bride” legal status as a wife,  
rather to legitimate the actions of the  
“groom.” Although theoretically valid,  
this form of marriage has always been  
forbidden, and thus it has never been  
one of the common forms of marriage.
