Twelfth month in the Tamil solar **year**,  
corresponding to the northern Indian  
solar month of Mina (the zodiacal sign of  
Pisces), which usually falls within March  
and April. This name is a modification of  
**Phalgun**, the twelfth month of the lunar  
**calendar**. The existence of several different calendars is one clear sign of the continuing importance of regional cultural  
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain  
their culture is by preserving their traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the few  
regional languages in India with an  
ancient, well-established literary tradition. See also **Tamil months**, **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, and **Tamil language**.
