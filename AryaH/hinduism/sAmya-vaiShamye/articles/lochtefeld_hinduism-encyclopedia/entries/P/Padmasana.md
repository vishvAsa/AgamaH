(“lotus posture”) Well-known sitting  
position (**asana**) used in **yoga** and in  
meditation; the lotus posture is also one  
of the sitting positions in which **deities**  
are portrayed in Hindu iconography. In  
this position the person sits crosslegged, with each foot placed on the  
thigh of the opposite leg. One of its benefits is that it is extremely stable and well  
suited for meditation, since the angle of  
the lower legs keeps the upper part of  
the legs flat on the ground, making a  
wide base to support the body. Done  
properly, it also keeps the spine quite  
straight, which is thought essential to  
keep from constricting the channels in  
the **subtle body**. In Indian iconography,  
the lotus position is sometimes represented at the base of a statue by the  
**sculpture** of a lotus, which forms the  
base on which the image is placed.
