title = "Prthu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, an ancient king  
who rules over all the **Earth**, and whose  
reign is considered a golden age. Prthu is  
magically born from the right hand of  
king **Vena**, a man so wicked that he has  
prohibited all sacrifices to the gods.  
After Prthu’s birth the people in his kingdom suffer famine, since the Earth has  
refused to produce food in protest  
against Vena’s wickedness. Prthu chases  
the Earth, who has taken the form of a  
**cow**. She finally agrees that, if Prthu will  
spare her life, she will produce food  
again. It is in memory of this deed that  
the Earth is given the name **Prthivi**  
(“related to Prthu”).
