(“restraint of breath”) In the **ashtanga**  
(“eight-part”) **yoga** first codified by  
**Patanjali** (1st c. C.E.?), pranayama is  
the fourth of the eight constituent  
elements of yoga practice. Pranayama  
requires a conscious control of respiration, specifically halting one’s breathing before inhaling and exhaling.  
When both of these actions have  
become automatic, this is described as  
“total” restraint. This practice is supposed to weaken and destroy the practitioner’s unwholesome **karma**, and  
render the mind fit for concentration.  
Removing karma is necessary for liberation of the soul, since all karma (both  
good and bad) ties one to the cycle of  
birth and rebirth.
