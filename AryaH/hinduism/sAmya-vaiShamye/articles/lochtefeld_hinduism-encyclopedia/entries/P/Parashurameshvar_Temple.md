title = "Parashurameshvar Temple"

+++
Temple constructed about 750 C.E. in  
the city of **Bhubaneshvar** in the state  
of **Orissa**, dedicated to the god **Shiva**  
in his aspect as the “Lord of  
**Parashuram**.” This title refers to  
Parashuram’s long period of **asceticism**, in which he worshiped Shiva as  
his chosen **deity** and was rewarded  
with Shiva’s **grace**. The temple is an  
early example of the Orissan variant  
of the northern Indian **Nagara** temple  
style. The Nagara style emphasizes  
verticality, with the whole temple  
building culminating in a single high  
point, and the Orissan variant of this  
style has a single enormous tower  
(**deul**) over the image of the temple’s  
primary deity, with shorter subsidiary  
buildings leading up to it. The  
Parashurameshvar temple is the first  
example of this basic pattern—a low,  
flat assembly hall (**jagamohan**), followed by a much taller and narrower  
tower (deul), in this case about forty  
feet high. Although later Orissan temples are much larger—some of the  
deuls tower over 200 feet—and often  
include additional buildings and structures, they all retain this basic pattern.
