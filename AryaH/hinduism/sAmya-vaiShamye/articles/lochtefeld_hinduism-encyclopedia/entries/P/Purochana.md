title = "Purochana"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Purochana is a minister of **Duryodhana**, the epic’s antagonist. He advises Duryodhana to build the  
**House of Lac** as a means to kill the  
**Pandavas**, the five brothers who are  
Duryodhana’s cousins, and the epic’s  
protagonists. After the Pandavas move  
into the House of Lac, Purochana sets  
**fire** to it. The Pandavas, whose uncle  
**Vidura** has alerted them to the danger,  
are able to escape through a secret  
underground passage, but Purochana  
himself is killed in the fire.
