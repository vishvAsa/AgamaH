title = "Punjab"

+++
Modern Indian state that lies south of  
the state of **Jammu** and **Kashmir** on the  
border of Pakistan. Modern Punjab is  
one of the so-called linguistic states, created to unite people with a common  
language and culture (in this case,  
Punjabi) under one state government.  
The present state of Punjab was created  
in 1966, when the former state (also  
called Punjab) was divided into three  
areas: Punjab (the Punjabi-speaking  
region), the state of **Haryana** (from the  
531  
Punjab  
Farmers harvesting wheat in a field in Punjab.  
**Hindi**-speaking regions), and **Himachal**  
**Pradesh** (from the hill regions). The  
Punjab region is replete with history, for it  
has been the traditional route by which  
invaders have gained access to the northern Indian plains. The first of these were  
the **Aryans**, who coined its name from the  
five rivers (pancab) flowing through it.  
The abundant **water** from these rivers,  
carried by an extensive irrigation network, has made the Punjab exceptionally  
fertile, and today it remains the largest  
wheat-growing area of India.  
The Punjab is famous as the birthplace  
of the Sikh religious community, and is  
today the only Sikh-majority state. The  
partition of India into Hindu and Muslim  
states in 1947 hit the Sikhs the hardest,  
since the division essentially carved their  
homeland in half. In the aftermath of the  
partition millions of people became  
refugees, and many of them fell victim to  
the atrocities of the time. For most of the  
1980s, Sikh proindependence groups  
waged an undeclared war against the  
Indian government. In one of the most  
dramatic events of this period, the Akal  
Takht, the traditional symbol for Sikh temporal power, was stormed by the Indian  
army in June 1984, and the Indian prime  
minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated  
four months later. By the mid-1990s this  
movement seemed to have been quelled,  
although no one can predict whether this  
is permanent. Punjab is most famous for  
the Sikh Harmandir (Golden Temple) in  
Amritsar, a short distance from the  
**Jallianwala Bagh**, site of a massacre that  
was one of the pivotal events in the struggle for Indian independence. For general

regions of India, an accessible reference is
