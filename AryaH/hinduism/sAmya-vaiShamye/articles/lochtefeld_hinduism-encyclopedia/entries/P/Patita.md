title = "Patita"

+++
(“fallen one”) In the **dharma literature**,  
the term for someone who had committed one of the **Four Great Crimes**; murdering a **brahmin** (**brahmahatya**),  
stealing a brahmin’s gold (**steya**), drinking **liquor** (**surapana**), and **adultery**  
with one’s **guru’s** wife (**gurutalpaga**).  
These crimes were considered so  
heinous that the performer became an  
outcast from society. Another indication  
of the gravity of these acts was that their  
expiations (**prayashchitta**) were so  
severe they normally ended in death,  
and in some cases this outcome was  
specifically prescribed. Aside from prescribing such punishments for the actual  
offenders, the dharma literature also  
prescribed similar outcast status for  
anyone who knowingly associated with  
such people for more than one year.
