title = "Pandrenthan"

+++
Historical site south of the city of  
Shrinagar in **Kashmir**. Pandrenthan is  
famous for one of the few old Hindu  
temples still standing in Kashmir, a temple dedicated to the god **Shiva** built in  
the twelfth century C.E. The shrine itself  
is fairly small and simple. The floor plan  
is basically square, with each side 17.5  
feet long and an entrance on each side  
giving the temple an open feel. Each  
doorway has a gable over it projecting  
out from a pyramidal roof known  
to builders as a hip roof. The temple  
is built entirely of stone but has  
overlapping courses, in an attempt to  
mimic wooden construction.
