City and sacred site (**tirtha**) on the  
**Bhima River** in the state of  
**Maharashtra**, about 185 miles east and  
south of Bombay. Pandharpur is best  
known for the temple to the god  
**Vithoba**, and has been a center of **worship** for the **Varkari Panth** religious  
community for at least seven hundred  
years. Varkari rituals center around a  
twice-yearly pilgrimage to Pandharpur,  
495  
Pandharpur  
Varkari Panth pilgrims en route to Pandharpur.  
in which the pilgrims all arrive on the  
same day. Each pilgrim procession starts  
from a different place and is identified  
with one of the poet-saints who helped  
form the community. At the front of  
each procession is a **palanquin** (palkhi)  
bearing the sandals of that group’s particular saint, who is thus symbolically  
leading them into Pandharpur. For more

Road,” *Journal of Asian Studies,* Vol. 22,
