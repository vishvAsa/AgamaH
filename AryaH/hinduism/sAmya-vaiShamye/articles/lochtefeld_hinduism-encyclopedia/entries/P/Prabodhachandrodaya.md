(“Rising of the **moon** of wisdom”)  
**Sanskrit** drama written by **Krishnamishra**, probably in the latter half of  
the eleventh century. Clearly allegorical, the play celebrates the triumph of  
**Vaishnava** piety, that is, of the devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**. The play is  
particularly notable for its third act, in  
which representatives for four nonVaishnava sects appear: a **materialist**, a  
Jain monk, a Buddhist monk, and a  
**Kapalika** (a member of an **ascetic** community that worshiped the god **Shiva**).  
The last is portrayed as thoroughly  
depraved, indulging in meat, wine, and  
sexual gratification, and having a penchant for violence. In the play, all four  
heretical characters plot to capture  
another character, named Faith, for  
their king, named Passion. However,  
they discover that Faith is a devotee of  
Vishnu and is outside their powers. In  
the end Faith is reunited with her son  
Tranquillity and a character named  
Compassion. Although the reader may  
safely assume that this play is written  
from a biased perspective, it is instructive in the attitudes it reveals toward  
ascetics and all other non-Vaishnava  
religious groups.
