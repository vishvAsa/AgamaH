Religious observance that occurs when  
the **intercalary month** falls during the  
536  
Pururavas  
**lunar month** of **Ashadh**. The intercalary  
month is an extra lunar month inserted  
into the **calendar** about every thirty  
months, to maintain general agreement  
between the solar and lunar calendar. It  
begins after any “regular” lunar month  
in which the **sun** has not moved into the  
next sign of the **zodiac**, and takes the  
name of the preceding month. Since the  
intercalary month is an unusual phenomenon, it is generally considered to  
be inauspicious, and the most common  
colloquial name for this month is the  
**malamasa**, the “impure month.” When  
this extra month falls in the lunar month  
of Ashadh, however, devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Vishnu** take the opposite perspective and treat it as an exceedingly  
holy time, dedicated to Vishnu in his  
form as Purushottama (“best of men”).  
**Vaishnavas** celebrate this month by  
reading the sacred texts, chanting  
Vishnu’s divine names, and other sorts  
of **worship**. The month of Ashadh, and  
its intercalary month, are especially  
important for the **Jagannath** temple in  
the city of **Puri**, whose presiding **deity**,  
Jagannath, is considered a form of  
**Krishna** and therefore, by extension, a  
form of Vishnu. During every year  
Ashadh is the month in which the **Rath**  
**Yatra** festival is performed in Puri, and in  
years when the intercalary month falls in  
Ashadh, new images of Jagannath and  
his siblings are created.
