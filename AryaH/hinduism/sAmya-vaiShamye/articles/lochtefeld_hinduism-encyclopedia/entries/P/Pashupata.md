title = "Pashupata"

+++
An extinct **ascetic** community, of devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva** in his  
form as Pashupati, “the Lord of Beasts.”  
Although the Pashupatas have now disappeared, according to the Chinese pilgrim **Hsuan Tsang** they were once the  
most important ascetic sect in northern  
India. According to historical reports, its  
members would engage in strange and  
antisocial behavior intended to bring  
disgrace upon themselves, although  
without lust or malice in their hearts.  
This practice was in imitation of one of  
Shiva’s mythic tales, in which he  
exposed himself to the wives of the  
Sages in the Pine Forest but was without  
desire for them. For further information  
see Daniel H. H. Ingalls, “Cynics and  
Pasupatas: The Seeking of Dishonor,” in  
*Harvard Theological Review,* 55, 1962.
