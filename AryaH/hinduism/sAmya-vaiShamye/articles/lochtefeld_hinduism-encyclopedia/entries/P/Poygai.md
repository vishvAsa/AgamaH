(7th c.) With **Pey** and **Bhutam**, one of the  
first three **Alvars**, a group of twelve poetsaints who lived in southern India  
between the seventh and tenth centuries. All the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god, conveyed through hymns  
sung in the **Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized Hindu religious  
life. According to tradition, the three  
men were caught in a torrential storm  
and, one by one, took shelter in a small  
dry spot, with each making room for the  
next. As they stood next to one another,  
they felt a fourth presence, who was  
Vishnu. The alvars were such great  
devotees that their combined energy  
was sufficient to provoke Vishnuâ€™s manifestation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy,  
each burst into song, which formed the  
first of each of their compositions. For
