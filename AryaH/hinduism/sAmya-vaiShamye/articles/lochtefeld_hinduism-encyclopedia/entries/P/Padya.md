(“for the feet”) The third of the sixteen  
traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”)  
given to a **deity** as part of **worship**, on  
the model of treating the deity as an  
honored guest. In this offering, the deity  
is offered water for washing the feet,  
which would be a traditional act of hospitality for a guest coming in from outside. The actual act of offering can be  
performed in various ways and often  
depends on the worshiper’s inclinations.  
In some cases the water will simply  
be presented before the deity’s image  
with the understanding that the deity  
has taken it, whereas in other cases  
the devotee (**bhakta**) will physically  
wash the feet of the image. In either  
case, the underlying motive is to show  
love for the deity and to minister to the  
deity’s needs.
