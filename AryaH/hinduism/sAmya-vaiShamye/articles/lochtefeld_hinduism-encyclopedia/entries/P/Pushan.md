title = "Pushan"

+++
(2) In Hindu mythology, the name of an  
**aditya** (minor **deity**) who attends the  
**sacrifice** sponsored by the demigod  
**Daksha**. The sacrifice is a disaster, since  
Daksha insults the god **Shiva** by not  
inviting him to the ceremony. When  
Daksha’s daughter **Sati**, who is also  
Shiva’s wife, inquires why Shiva has  
been excluded, Daksha begins to insult  
her in full view of the company.  
Mortified and humiliated, Sati commits  
**suicide**. When Shiva learns of this,  
he comes with his ghoulish minions  
and utterly destroys the sacrifice. In  
the process many of the guests  
suffer injuries or indignities, and  
Pushan’s teeth are broken and lost.
