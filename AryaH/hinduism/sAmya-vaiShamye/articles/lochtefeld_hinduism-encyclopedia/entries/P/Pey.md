(7th c.) With **Bhutam** and **Poygai**, one of  
the first three **Alvars**, a group of twelve  
poet-saints who lived in southern India  
between the seventh and tenth centuries. All Alvars were devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Vishnu**, and their stress on  
passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god, conveyed through hymns  
sung in the **Tamil language**, transformed  
and revitalized Hindu religious life.  
According to tradition, the three men  
were caught in a torrential storm and  
one by one took shelter in a small dry  
spot, with each making room for the  
next. As they stood next to one another  
they felt a fourth presence, that of  
Vishnu. The Alvars were such great  
devotees that their combined energy was  
sufficient to provoke Vishnuâ€™s manifestation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy, each  
burst into song, which formed the first of  
each of their compositions. For further
