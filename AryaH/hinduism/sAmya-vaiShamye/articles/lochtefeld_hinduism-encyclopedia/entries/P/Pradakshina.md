title = "Pradakshina"

+++
(“toward the right”) Circumambulation  
of an object or person as a sign of **worship**, reverence, or respect. This is  
always done in a clockwise direction, so  
that the walker’s right side (considered  
the purer and more auspicious side) is  
always turned toward the object or person being circled. Just about anything  
can be so circled—one’s parents or  
teacher, the image of a **deity**, a temple,  
a city, or the entire Indian subcontinent. In many larger temples, particularly in the **Nagara** architectural style,  
the pradakshina is the name for one of  
the architectural features. In this case,  
it is a semicircular processional passageway surrounding the temple’s  
main image, so that people can circumambulate the main image either  
before or after worship. Pradakshina is  
also the fifteenth of the sixteen traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to  
517  
Pradakshina  
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada was the founder of ISKCON,  
a religious community devoted to the god Krishna that is popularly known as the Hare Krishnas.  
a deity as part of worship, on the model  
of treating the deity as an honored  
guest. The underlying motive here, as  
for all the upacharas, is to show one’s  
love for the deity and to minister to the  
deity’s needs as one would to a living  
person’s needs.
