(“[the] five great sacrifices”) Set of  
five ritual actions—**brahmayajna**, **pitryajna**, **devayajna**, **bhutayajna**, and  
**nryajana**—that are prescribed in the  
**dharma literature**, (texts on religious  
duty). These five actions are prescribed  
daily religious observances for a “**twiceborn**” householder, that is, a householder  
who has been born into one of the three  
“twice-born” groups in Indian society—  
**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—and  
who has received the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the “second  
birth.” Each **sacrifice** (**yajna**) is directed  
toward a different class of beings—from  
the Absolute Reality down to animals—  
and is satisfied by different actions: to  
**Brahman** by teaching and studying the  
**Veda**, to the **ancestral spirits** (pitr) by  
**offerings** of water (**tarpana**), to the gods  
(**deva**) by offering clarified butter into  
the sacred **fire**, to the animals and social  
outcasts (**bhut**) by putting out food for  
them, and to human beings (nr) by  
showing hospitality to guests. In the  
time since the dharma literature was  
composed, Hindu life has seen significant changes in emphasis, and although  
some of these are still important in  
modern Hindu life—particularly the  
stress on hospitality to guests—in most  
cases the others have been either elided  
or replaced by other religious forms.
