title = "Pancharatra"

(“five nights,” of uncertain meaning)  
The name denotes a particular group of  
**Vaishnavas** (devotees of the god  
**Vishnu**). Although there is plenty of evidence that the Pancharatra community  
is very old, very little is known about its  
origins. In the earliest Vaishnava sectarian texts, the Pancharatra community is  
unfavorably compared to another  
group, the **Bhagavatas**, with the former  
described as marginal and the latter as  
“Vedic” and respectable. Despite this  
seeming disapprobation, in their earliest appearances Pancharatras do not  
seem theologically different from the  
Bhagavatas, although their differences  
may have been rooted in differing  
practices. In their later history, the  
Pancharatras become associated with  
an elaborate theory of **creation**, finalized somewhere around the sixth century  
and based on the successive appearance  
of four divine emanations: VishnuNarayana, **Sankarshana**, **Pradyumna**,  
and **Aniruddha**. The successive activity  
of these divine emanations brings the  
world into being, but each is also associated with a particular facet of spiritual  
life through which human beings can  
reverse the process of creation and gain  
liberation. The Pancharatra school is  
also important for its theory of primary  
and secondary **avatars**, in which the latter can include any properly consecrated image of the **deity**. The doctrine of  
secondary avatars has become a pivotal  
idea in the later **Shrivaishnava** community, through which Pancharatra ideas  
have continued to influence modern  
Hindu life.
