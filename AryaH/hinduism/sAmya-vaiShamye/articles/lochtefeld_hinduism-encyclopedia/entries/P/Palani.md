title = "Palani"

+++
Town and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the eastern part of the state of **Tamil Nadu**,  
about sixty miles northwest of **Madurai**.  
Palani is part of a network of six temples  
in Tamil Nadu dedicated to **Murugan**, a  
hill **deity** who has been assimilated into  
the larger pantheon as a form of the god  
**Skanda**, the **son** of **Shiva**. Five of these  
temples have been definitively identified, and each is associated with a particular region, a particular ecosystem,  
and a particular incident in Murugan’s  
mythic career—in the case of Palani,  
Murugan lived there as a young **ascetic**.  
Every other shrine to Murugan in Tamil  
Nadu can be considered the sixth of  
these temples. The cult of Murugan is  
thus a symbolic vehicle for Tamil pride  
and identity, and since the number six  
has connotations of completeness—as  
in the six directions, or the six **chakras**  
in the **subtle body**—it also connotes  
that nothing external is needed. For
