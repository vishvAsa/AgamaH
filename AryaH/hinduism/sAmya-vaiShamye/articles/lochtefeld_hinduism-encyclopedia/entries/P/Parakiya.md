title = "Parakiya"

+++
(“belonging to another”) Particular type  
of relationship between lover and  
beloved, in which the woman is seen as  
married to another person. Parakiya is  
said to generate the most intense passion, since the people pursuing it have  
nothing to gain but love itself—if  
caught, they risk ridicule and shame,  
and in any case their liaison has no real  
future. This is not the conventional, safe  
love with one’s own spouse (**svakiya**)  
that is sanctioned by marriage, carries  
social approval, and usually entails procreation, but rather a dangerous love  
pursued solely for pleasure. This type of  
relationship is a standard image in  
**Sanskrit** poetry, and is also the dominant theme for describing the relationship between the god **Krishna** and his  
human consort **Radha**, which is seen as  
symbolizing the relationship between  
god and the human soul.
