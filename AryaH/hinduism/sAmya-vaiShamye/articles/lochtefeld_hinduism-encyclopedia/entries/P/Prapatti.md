(“throwing oneself down”) Prapatti  
refers to a devotee’s (**bhakta**) complete  
surrender to God’s power as the only  
means of salvation. This attitude is  
particularly stressed among the  
**Shrivaishnavas**, a southern Indian  
religious community who are followers  
of the god **Vishnu** and whose founder  
was the great philosopher **Ramanuja**  
(11th c.). Although ultimate power is  
believed to be vested in God’s **grace** by  
the practitioners of prapatti, believers  
nevertheless possess a concern for  
continuing religious practice. Thus,  
prapatti is not meant to replace conventional religious activities such as **worship**. These activities are still performed,  
but with the consciousness that God’s  
grace will be sufficient. They are therefore not seen as a means toward salvation, but as reflections of the grace one  
has already obtained.
