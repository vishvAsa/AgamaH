title = "Priyadas"

+++
(early 18th c.) Author of the **Bhaktirasabodhini** (“Awakening the Delight in  
Devotion”), a commentary on the  
**Bhaktamal** of **Nabhadas**, completed in  
\1712. In his text, Nabhadas had given  
very brief (six line) biographies of over  
two hundred contemporary **bhakti**  
(devotional) figures. These original  
biographies are notably free of marvelous and miraculous events, with their  
major emphasis being the devotee’s  
(**bhakta**) personal qualities, to serve as a  
model for others. In his commentary,  
Priyadas gives greatly expanded  
accounts for each one of the devotees  
mentioned by Nabhadas, and usually  
describes events to which Nabhadas  
makes no reference. At least in the case  
of the poet-saint **Ravidas**, Nabhadas  
clearly drew his material from the texts  
written by the biographer **Anantadas**,  
but in many other cases his sources  
are not clear. The accounts by Priyadas  
are larded with miracles and wonders,  
and the prevalence of such events,  
combined with his chronological distance from his subjects, makes him  
a less reliable source for the lives of  
these devotees.
