title = "Prashna (“Question”) Upanishad"

+++
One of the later and more developed  
**upanishads**, the speculative religious  
texts that form the latest stratum of the  
oldest Hindu sacred texts, the **Vedas**. As  
with most of the upanishads, the Prashna  
Upanishad’s underlying concern is to  
investigate ultimate questions, in particular the nature of the Self (**atman**).  
Considered one of the later upanishads,  
the Prashna Upanishad is similar to the  
earliest upanishads, the Brhadaranyaka  
and the Chandogya, but is far shorter, and  
the text is much more focused. Like the  
older upanishads, the Prashna is written  
as a dialogue. It takes the form of a conversation between the sage **Pippalada** and  
six questioners. In each section (called a  
prashna in the text) one of the hearers asks  
a question, to which Pippalada replies.  
The six sections all have different themes:  
the nature of time, **prana** as the most  
important human power, the nature of life  
after death, sleep, meditation, the sound  
**Om**, and the nature of the Self. In this  
way, it uses the older dialogue form to  
advance a far more developed and  
cohesive philosophical perspective.
