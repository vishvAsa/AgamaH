(“President Swami,” b. 1921) Title of  
Shastri Narayanswarupdas Swami, the  
present spiritual leader of the  
**Swaminarayan** religious community.  
Swaminarayan Hinduism is based on  
the life and teachings of Sahajananda  
Swami (1781–1830), who because of his  
piety and charisma was deemed by his  
followers an **avatar** of the god **Vishnu**.  
Pramukh Swami is the uncontested  
head of the **Akshar Purushottam**  
**Samstha**, a branch of the Swaminarayan  
movement that separated from the parent group in 1906. He is a strict **ascetic**  
who serves as religious teacher (**guru**) to  
an estimated million followers all over  
the world. His devotees (**bhakta**) are  
predominately members of the **Gujarati**  
community and mostly affluent merchants, making the movement financially robust.
