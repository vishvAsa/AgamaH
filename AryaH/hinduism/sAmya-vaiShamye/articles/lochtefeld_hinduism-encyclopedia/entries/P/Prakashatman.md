title = "Prakashatman"

+++
(13th c.) Proponent of the **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** school, one of the **six schools** of  
traditional Hindu **philosophy**. Prakashatman’s **Vivarana**, a commentary on  
the work of the Advaita philosopher  
**Padmapada**, provides the name for the  
Vivarana school of Advaita Vedanta.  
Prakashatman is traditionally described  
as Padmapada’s disciple, but since the  
latter is an attested pupil of **Shankaracharya** (9th c. C.E.), the time difference  
makes this unlikely.

Prakashatman  
Since **Brahman** is believed to be the  
locus of all things, Vivarana Advaitins  
conclude that ignorance must also be a  
part of Brahman. However, they try to  
maintain Brahman’s integrity by invoking a theory of **reflectionism** to explain  
the apparent difference between Self  
and Brahman, even though they are ultimately identical. Just as an image  
appearing in a mirror is based on the  
original but different from it, so human  
Selves are identical with Brahman but  
appear to be separate. The basic position of the Vivarana school is an uncompromising affirmation of Brahman as  
the sole “reality,” in which anything that  
exists must belong to it.
