title = "Pani"

+++
A group of northern Indian people mentioned in a hymn in the **Rg Veda** (10.108),  
the oldest Hindu religious text. This reference speaks poorly of this group, since  
it portrays them as cattle thieves. The  
hymn is spoken as a dialogue between  
the Panis and **Sarama**, the divine **dog**  
who is the servant of the god **Indra** and  
who has been sent by Indra to recover  
the cattle the Panis have stolen. This  
hymn may refer to an actual incident  
and an actual group of people, but it is  
impossible to say. Certainly the Vedas  
were not written as a strict historical  
record, and it is perilous to read them as  
such. At the same time, as the earliest  
textual records they preserve references  
to the culture and to contemporary  
times that can be found nowhere else.
