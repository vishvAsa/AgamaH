In Indian **philosophy**, one of the two  
great seventh-century commentators in  
the **Purva Mimamsa** school, one of the  
**six schools** of traditional Hindu philosophy; the other great commentator was  
**Kumarila**. The Mimamsa school was  
most concerned with the examination  
and pursuit of **dharma** (“righteous  
action”), the Mimamsa school believed  
all necessary instructions were contained in the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu  
religious texts. Much of Mimamsa  
thought is concerned with principles  
and methods for textual interpretation  
seeking to uncover and interpret these  
instructions. Although both Kumarila  
and Prabhakara were committed to discovering the boundaries of dharma by  
interpreting the Vedas, there are significant differences in their philosophical  
positions, seen most clearly in their  
**theories of error**.  
Prabhakara believes in a concept  
similar to the **Nyaya** concept of **inherence** (**samavaya**), a weak relational  
force that is assumed to connect objects  
and their attributes—for example, connecting the color red with a particular

ball, thus making the ball red. This  
assumption leads him to characterize  
error as **akhyati** (“nondiscrimination”),  
the inability to make sharp distinctions.  
For example, a person mistakes the silvery flash of sea shell for a piece of silver.  
To Prabhakara, the person errs by  
uncritically connecting two simple judgments: “that object is silvery” and “silver  
is silvery.” By themselves, both of these  
statements are true, what is false is their  
combination into the complex judgment “that object is silver.” Kumarila is  
closer to the **bhedabhada** (“identityand-difference”) philosophical position,  
which holds that all things both identify  
with and differ from all other things.  
Kumarila explains error as **viparitakhyati**,  
the mistaken pairing of the similarities  
between two things, rather than the  
failure to note their differences.
