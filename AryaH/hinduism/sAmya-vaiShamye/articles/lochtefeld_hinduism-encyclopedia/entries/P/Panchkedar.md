(“The Five Kedars”) The collective name  
for a network of five sites, sacred to the  
god **Shiva**, spread throughout the  
**Garhwal** region of the **Himalayas**:  
**Kedarnath**, **Rudranath**, **Tungnath**,  
**Madmaheshvar**, and **Kalpeshvar**. Each  
site is identified with a part of Shiva’s  
body, thus providing a series of connections between the **deity’s** body and the  
land itself—understandably so, since  
Shiva is believed to dwell in the  
Himalayas. Kedarnath is identified as  
Shiva’s back, Madmaheshvar his navel,  
Tungnath his arm, Rudranath his face,  
and Kalpeshvar his matted locks (**jata**).
