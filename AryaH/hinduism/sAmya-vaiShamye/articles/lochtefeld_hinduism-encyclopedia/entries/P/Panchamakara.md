“The Five Forbidden Things,” literally,  
“the five m’s”: A group of five things used  
for **worship** in the secret, ritually based  
religious practice known as **tantra**. This  
name arises because the names for all  
five of these begin with the letter “m”—  
**madya** (wine), **matsya** (fish), **mamsa**  
(meat), **mudra** (fermented or parched  
grain), and **maithuna** (copulation).  
They are used in their actual form in  
“left hand” (**vamachara**) tantra, and by  
substitution in “right hand” (**dakshinachara**) tantra.  
All five are condemned by  
“respectable” Hindu society (the last  
because it is characterized as adulterous), and their use in tantric ritual must  
be seen in a larger context. One of the  
most pervasive tantric assumptions is  
the ultimate unity of everything that  
exists. From a tantric perspective, to  
affirm that the entire universe is one  
principle—often conceived as the activity of a particular **deity**—means that the  
adept must reject all concepts based on  
dualistic thinking. The “Five Forbidden  
Things” provide a ritual means for  
breaking down duality, since in this ritual  
the adept violates societal norms forbidding consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and illicit sexuality, in a  
conscious effort to sanctify what is normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite  
such ritual use of forbidden things as  
proof that their practice involves a more  
exclusive qualification (**adhikara**) and is  
thus superior to common practice. For
