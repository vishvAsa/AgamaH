In Indian astrology (**jyotisha**), an  
almanac documenting the position of  
the various celestial bodies during the  
course of a **calendar year**, including the  
days of the **moonâ€™s** monthly cycle, its  
progression through the **nakshatras**,  
and the position of the **planets**. Most  
Hindu religious festivals fall according  
to a lunar calendar, and thus a panchang  
is needed to determine when they will  
arrive. A panchang is also important for  
helping people to determine auspicious
