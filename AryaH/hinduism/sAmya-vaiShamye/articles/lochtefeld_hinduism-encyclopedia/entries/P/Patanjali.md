(2nd c. B.C.E.) **Sanskrit** grammarian  
and author of the **Mahabhashya**  
(“Great Commentary”) on **Panini’s**  
**Ashtadhyayi**. Panini’s text was written  
as a series of short phrases or aphorisms  
intended to be a complete description of  
the language in the briefest possible  
space. Panini’s text was a marvel of  
economy and was easy to memorize but

Pashupatinath  
The Pashupatinath Temple in Katmandu, Nepal, is dedicated to the god Shiva  
as “Master of the Lord of the Beasts.”  
was so cryptic that it virtually presupposed a commentary, which Patanjali  
provided. Patanjali’s *Mahabhashya*  
is not only important for his explication  
of Panini’s grammar, but also because  
his examples often provide useful  
historical information.  
Patanjali is also the person named  
as the author of the **Yoga Sutras**, but  
since these are believed to have been  
composed several centuries after  
the *Mahabhashya*, the authors are  
believed to be two different people  
with the same name.
