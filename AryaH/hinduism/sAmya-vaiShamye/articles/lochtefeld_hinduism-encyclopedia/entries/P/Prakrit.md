title = "Prakrit"

+++
(“formed”) Collective term for the grammatically simpler vernacular languages  
that developed from **Sanskrit** through  
the natural process of linguistic change.  
The existence of Prakrits is evident as  
early as the fifth century B.C.E., at which  
time several different dialects are spoken. The Prakrits were contrasted with  
Sanskrit (“perfected”), the language of  
temple, court, and other elite contexts,  
which was subject to strict grammatical  
canons and did not change. Even those  
fluent in Sanskrit would have learned it  
as a second language—as a static,  
learned language, it is inherently artificial—and would have spoken in Prakrit  
with lower status people (such as servants, commoners, and most **women**).  
Despite its “lower” status, Prakrits are  
vitally important historically: They were  
the languages for royal **inscriptions** up  
to the Gupta era (ca. 350–550), and one  
of the Prakrits, Pali, is famous as the language for the Theravada Buddhist  
canon. See also **Gupta dynasty**.
