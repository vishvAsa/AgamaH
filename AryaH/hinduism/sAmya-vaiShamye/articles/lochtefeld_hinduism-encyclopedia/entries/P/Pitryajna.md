(“**sacrifice** to the ancestors”) One of the  
Five Great Sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**)  
prescribed in the **dharma literature**, the  
texts on religious duty. These Five Great  
Sacrifices are daily observances for a  
“**twice-born**” householder, that is, one  
who has been born into one of the three  
“twice-born” groups in Indian society—  
**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—and  
who has received the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the “second  
birth.” Each of the five sacrifices (**yajna**)  
is directed toward a different class of  
beings—from the Absolute Reality down  
to **animals**—and is satisfied by different  
actions. The pitryajna is directed toward  
one’s ancestors, and is satisfied by **offering** them libations of water (**tarpana**). In  
the time since the dharma literature was  
composed Hindu life has undergone  
significant changes, and some of these  
five rites have been completely elided.  
Although in certain contexts pitryajna is  
still an important rite—particularly at  
pilgrimage sites and in formal rites for  
the dead—it is no longer performed on a  
daily basis.
