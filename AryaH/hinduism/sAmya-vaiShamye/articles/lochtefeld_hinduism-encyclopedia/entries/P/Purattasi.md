The sixth month in the Tamil solar **year**,  
corresponding to the northern Indian  
solar month of Kanya (the zodiacal sign  
of Virgo), which usually falls within  
September and October. The existence  
of several different calendars is one clear  
sign of the continuing importance of  
regional cultural patterns. One way that  
the Tamils retain their culture is by  
preserving their traditional **calendar**.  
Tamil is one of the few regional  
languages in India with an ancient,  
well-established literary tradition. See  
also **Tamil months**, **Tamil Nadu**, and  
**Tamil language**.
