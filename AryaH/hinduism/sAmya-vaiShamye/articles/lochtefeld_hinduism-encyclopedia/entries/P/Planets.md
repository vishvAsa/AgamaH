Indian astrology (**jyotisha**) recognizes  
nine planets that affect human beings:  
the five visible ones (**Jupiter**, **Venus**,  
**Mercury**, **Saturn**, and **Mars**), the **Sun**  
and **Moon**, and two planets not known  
to Western astrology, **Rahu** and **Ketu**. Of  
these, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury are,  
by themselves, always benevolent. The  
moon is changeable, depending on its  
position in the lunar cycle, and the others are considered to have malefic tendencies, although only Rahu and Ketu  
are invariably malevolent. Rahu and  
Ketu move throughout the **zodiac**, but  
the others are all fixed in place. Each of  
the planets is part of an elaborate series  
of associations, including parts of the  
body, **family relationships**, and personal  
qualities. The influence of all these  
planets can be heightened or weakened  
according to their position in a person’s  
**natal horoscope**, or their position vis-à-  
vis the other planets. The astrological  
tradition also recognizes a practice  
known as **pacification of planets**,  
through which their good qualities  
can be heightened, or their malevolent

qualities weakened and contained. This  
can be done either through wearing particular **gemstones** that are believed to  
correspond to these planets, or by performing certain protective rituals.
