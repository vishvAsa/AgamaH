title = "Pramana"

+++
In Indian **philosophy**, a means by  
which human beings can gain true and  
accurate knowledge, generally classified  
as one of three types: Perception  
520  
Prakrit  
(**pratyaksha**), which includes magical or  
yogic insight as well as direct sensory  
perception; inference (**anumana**),  
which ultimately depends upon direct  
experience; and testimony (**shabda**),  
which can be either scriptural or the  
instruction of one’s teacher. Some philosophical schools also include a fourth  
source, analogy (**upamana**), but those  
who do not recognize this categorize it  
as another form of inference. The first  
three are accepted by all philosophical  
schools except for the **materialists**, who  
recognize only perception. The **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** school affirms two additional  
pramanas—presumption (**arthapatti**),  
and knowledge from absence (**abhava**)—  
which they argue give one knowledge.  
The root meaning of this term comes  
from the verb “to measure”; thus these  
are tools for measuring and interpreting  
the world we experience.
