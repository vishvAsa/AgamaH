title = "Purusha"

+++
(“person”) One of the two fundamental  
first principles in the **Samkhya** philosophical school, the other one being  
**prakrti** (“nature”). Samkhya upholds an  
atheistic philosophical dualism in  
which the twin principles of purusha  
and prakrti—roughly, spirit and  
nature—are the source of all things.  
Purusha is conceived as conscious but  
completely inactive and unchanging. It  
is the passive witness to the myriad  
transformations of prakrti going on  
around it, and as the source of consciousness purusha is ultimately identified with a person’s true Self (**atman**).  
Thus purusha is inferred as plural, given  
the plurality of conscious beings and  
the fact that one person can gain final  
enlightenment while all the rest remain  
in bondage. According to the Samkhyas,  
the ultimate source of bondage lies in  
people’s failure to distinguish between  
purusha and prakrti and in identifying  
the Self with the latter rather than the  
former. For further information see
