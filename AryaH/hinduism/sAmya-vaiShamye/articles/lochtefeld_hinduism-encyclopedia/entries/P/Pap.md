title = "Pap"

+++
(“evil”) A word sometimes used as an  
adjective to describe people and  
actions, but most often used as a noun,  
either to denote a particular deed as evil  
or to refer to the collective evil one has  
accumulated through the bad deeds in  
one’s karmic career. Since, according to  
**karma** theory, all one’s deeds will eventually come to fruition, the evil that one  
has done is seen as already existing,  
even if only in a potential state. The  
opposite of pap is **punya**, the most general term denoting religious merit.
