title = "Prakrti"

(“nature”) One of the two fundamental  
principles in the **Samkhya** school, the  
other being **purusha** (“person”).  
Samkhya espouses an atheistic philosophical dualism, in which purusha and  
prakrti—roughly, spirit and nature—are  
the source of all things. Prakrti is better  
conceived of as force or power rather  
than a specific material object. It contains within it three different forces with  
three different qualities (**guna**): **sattva**  
tends toward the good, **rajas** towards  
activity or passion, and **tamas** towards  
darkness and decay. In the primal  
prakrti these forces are in perfect equilibrium, each perfectly balancing the  
others, but when prakrti’s equilibrium  
is disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern  
of **evolution** that creates both the exterior physical world and the interior  
psychological world. All of these evolutes—material or psychic—have a differing balance of the three gunas,  
which ultimately determines their  
character as wholesome, active, or  
unwholesome. For further information
