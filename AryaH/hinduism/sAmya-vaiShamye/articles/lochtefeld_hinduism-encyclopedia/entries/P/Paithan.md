+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) on the  
**Godavari** River in the state of  
**Maharashtra**, about 175 miles east of  
Bombay. Although of reduced importance in modern times, it has a long history as a trading city and was an  
important stopping-point on the central  
Indian trade route from southern India  
to **Ujjain**. Since the sixteenth century,  
Paithan has been famous as the home of  
**Eknath**, one of the important figures in  
the **Varkari Panth**, a religious community centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba** at his temple at  
**Pandharpur** in the modern state of  
**Maharashtra**. Varkari religious practice  
primarily consists of two pilgrimages, in  
which all the participants arrive in  
Pandharpur on the same **day**. Eknath  
still symbolically travels to Pandharpur  
488  
Padya  
twice each year; a **palanquin** (palkhi)  
bearing his sandals is at the head of the  
procession bearing his name.
