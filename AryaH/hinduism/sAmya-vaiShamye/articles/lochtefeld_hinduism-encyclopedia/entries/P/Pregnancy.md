title = "Pregnancy"

+++
As in all societies, Hindus regard the  
impending **birth** of a child as a time of  
eager expectation tinged with anxiety.  
Part of this anxiety stems from purely  
physical worries that the pregnancy and  
birth proceed normally, and that the  
mother and child remain in good physical health. Expectant mothers are usually  
encouraged to rest and are often given  
526  
Pravara  
food considered especially nourishing  
(such as milk products and nuts) to  
build their strength. From the mother’s  
perspective, pregnancy is an extremely  
significant event, since the birth of children (especially **sons**) will solidify her  
status in her marital family; but this  
significance also contributes its own  
quotient of expectation and anxiety.  
Since the mother’s emotional state  
during pregnancy is believed to affect  
the child, all efforts are made to shelter  
the expectant mother from unpleasant  
thoughts and situations and to generate  
happy thoughts.  
Aside from protecting the expectant  
mother’s physical and psychological  
health, Hindus take numerous precautions to guard her from other sorts of  
misfortune. As at other life transitions,  
during pregnancy and the child’s first  
days the mother and her child are considered particularly vulnerable to black  
**magic**, particularly the **witchcraft** of  
those who might be jealous of the  
expectant or new mother. Another  
avenue for harm comes from inauspicious events, such as an **eclipse**, during  
which a pregnant woman should stay  
inside (away from its malevolent rays)  
and remain perfectly still, lest her child  
be born with missing limbs. These hostile forces can also be countered by various **rites of protection**, such as wearing  
amulets, charms, or iron (considered to  
render one impervious to spells), by cutting back on social interaction to avoid  
possible contact with inauspicious people and things, and by attention to religious rites.
