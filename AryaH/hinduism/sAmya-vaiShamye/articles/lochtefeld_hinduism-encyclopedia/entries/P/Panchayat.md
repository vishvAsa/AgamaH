title = "Panchayat"

+++
In traditional India, a group of five (pancha) elders from a particular community,  
who were the final authority for the  
members of that community. Each **jati**  
(**endogamous** subcommunity, often  
defined by hereditary occupation) was a  
self-governing body, for which the panchayat would make all the important  
decisions. In modern India this institution is being hailed as a paradigm for  
decentralized government, in which the  
493  
Panchayat  
people themselves take responsibility  
for their communities, but since there  
are multiple jatis in any traditional  
Hindu village, this also means that there  
were multiple centers of authority.
