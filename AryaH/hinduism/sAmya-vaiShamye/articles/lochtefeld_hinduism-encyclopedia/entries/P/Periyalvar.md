title = "Periyalvar"

+++
(9th c.) One of the **Alvars**, a group of  
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. The Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
stress on passionate devotion (**bhakti**)  
to a personal god, conveyed through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**,  
transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life.  
According to tradition, Periyalvar  
was born into a **brahmin** family. From  
his youth he showed deep piety, and his  
primary means of devotion was to grow  
and pick flowers for the image of his  
chosen **deity**, **Krishna**. The most  
famous story about Periyalvar tells of a  
**dream** in which God commanded him to  
take part in a scholarly debate to be held  
by one of the Pandya kings. Periyalvar,  
despite his reservations about his lack  
of learning, obeyed this command after  
he woke. When he spoke, the words  
flowed out under divine inspiration, and  
the bag containing the prize money flew  
off the hook and into his hands as a sign  
of his victory. For further information
