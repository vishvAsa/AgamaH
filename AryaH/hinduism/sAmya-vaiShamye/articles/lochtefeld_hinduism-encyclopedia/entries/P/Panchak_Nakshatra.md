title = "Panchak Nakshatra"

+++
A group of five (pancha) consecutive  
**nakshatras** (the twenty-seven signs in  
the lunar zodiac) in Indian astrology  
(**jyotisha**). The lunar houses are divided  
equally throughout the solar zodiac,  
with 2.25 lunar houses for each solar  
sign. In a single **lunar month** the **moon**  
moves through each of these lunar  
houses in turn, spending about a **day** in  
each. The Panchak Nakshatra is believed  
to be a highly inauspicious time, and  
people who pay attention to astrology  
will often severely curtail any nonessential activities until this time has passed.
