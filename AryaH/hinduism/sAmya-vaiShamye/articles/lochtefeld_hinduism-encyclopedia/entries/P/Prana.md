(“breath”) As a collective noun, the  
name for the five “winds” considered to  
be responsible for basic bodily functions. The first of these, located in the  
chest, is labeled by the general term  
*prana*. Because it performs those functions necessary for sustaining life—respiration, the movement of food into the  
stomach, and the circulation of **blood**  
through the body—its name is often  
used to designate all five winds. Of the  
other four winds, **apana** (in the anal  
region) is concerned with elimination,

Pramukh Swami, the present spiritual leader of the Swaminarayan religious community.  
**samana** (in the navel) aids digestion,  
**udana** (in the throat) conveys things out  
of the mouth—like speech, song, burps,  
etc.—and **vyana** circulates throughout  
the body, mixing things together. These  
winds are the focus of the **yoga** exercise  
known as **pranayama**, the aim of which  
is to achieve control over the central  
forces of life.
