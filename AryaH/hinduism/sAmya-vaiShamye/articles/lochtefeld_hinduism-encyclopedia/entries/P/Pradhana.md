title = "Pradhana"

+++
(“principal”) In the **Samkhya** philosophical school, pradhana is another  
name for **prakrti**, the “primal matter”  
that the Samkhyas consider the first  
principle from which all material things  
have evolved. In the secret, ritually  
based religious practice known as  
**tantra**, the word *pradhana* is used to  
denote the goddess **Shakti**, as the active  
principle behind the formation of the  
universe. Grammatically, the word is  
feminine, indicating a connotation of  
fertility and fecundity.
