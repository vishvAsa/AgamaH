title = "Pole Star"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the personified  
form of the boy **Dhruva**, who is a symbol  
for unrelenting pursuit of a goal. Dhruva  
is a king’s son, but for some unknown  
reason his father favors Dhruva’s halfbrother over him. Distressed by this  
insult, Dhruva takes a vow to attain a  
place above all others and goes off to the  
forest to perform austerities (**tapas**).  
After Dhruva endures many bodily mortifications, the god **Vishnu** appears and  
grants him a boon. In response to  
Dhruva’s request for a place above all  
others, Vishnu promises Dhruva that  
after his death he will be installed as the  
Pole Star, the pivot around which all the  
other stars in the sky will turn.
