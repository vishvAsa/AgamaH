title = "Pradyumna"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the son of the god  
**Krishna** and his divine queen **Rukmini**.  
Pradyumna is the rebirth of the god  
**Kama**, who has been completely annihilated by the fire from the god **Shiva’s**  
third eye. After Kama’s death, Shiva reassures Kama’s wife **Rati** that her husband  
will be reborn as Pradyumna to kill the  
**demon** Sambhara. Through his **magic**  
powers Sambhara is well aware of the  
threat; when he finds the child, he  
throws it into the ocean and thinks that  
he has killed it. Pradyumna is swallowed  
by a great fish, which is caught and presented to king Sambhara; when the fish  
is split open, the child enchants his wife  
Mayavati, in whose form Rati has taken  
birth to aid her husband. Pradyumna  
kills Sambhara in a ferocious battle and  
is reunited with Rati.
