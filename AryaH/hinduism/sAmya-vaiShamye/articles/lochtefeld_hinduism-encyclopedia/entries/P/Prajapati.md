(“Lord of Creatures”) **Deity** appearing  
late in the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu  
sacred texts, who is described as the  
creator of the universe and is considered superior to the Vedic deities. The  
means by which Prajapati carries out  
creation are different in different  
places. In **Rg Veda** 10.121 he is  
described as the **Golden Embryo** from  
which all things developed, whereas in  
Rg 10.90, also known as the **Purusha**  
**Sukta**, he is described as the primal person  
518  
Pradhana  
(purusha) who is sacrificed by the gods  
and from whose parts the world develops. In later Hindu practice the name  
*Prajapati* can also be used to refer to the  
god **Brahma**, as fashioner of the universe, or to the gods **Vishnu** or **Shiva**, as  
the universe’s supreme deities.
