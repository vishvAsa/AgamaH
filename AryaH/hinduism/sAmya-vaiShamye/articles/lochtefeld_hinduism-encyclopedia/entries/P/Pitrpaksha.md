title = "Pitrpaksha"

+++
The fortnight (**paksha**) dedicated to the  
**worship** of the **ancestral spirits** (pitr),  
observed in the dark (waning) half of the  
**lunar month** of **Ashvin**. This is the period  
during the **year** in which Hindus  
remember and give **offerings** for their  
dead: offerings of **water** and rice-balls  
(**pinda**) on each day of the fortnight, and  
as well as special observances on the  
day of the fortnight corresponding to  
the day of the ancestor’s death. These  
offerings are believed to sustain the  
dead by symbolically feeding them, and  
also to placate the dead by demonstrating that the living still remember and  
care for them.  
Because of its strong connection  
with the dead, this fortnight is generally  
considered an inauspicious time, and  
people often restrict their everyday  
activities in symbolic recognition of it.  
Many people will not cut their **hair**,  
beards, or nails during this time, nor will  
they wear new clothes. These precautions stem from the conviction that  
making alterations in one’s appearance  
during an inauspicious time will have  
adverse future affects, since it will carry  
the taint forward. Many people also curtail other normal activities during this

Pitr  
During Pitrpaksha, Hindus offer rice balls and water to their ancestors.  
time, such as buying any article or initiating any new project, unless it is  
absolutely necessary. The period is also  
deemed a good time for religious observances, particularly giving gifts (**dana**)  
to **brahmins**. On the one hand this is a  
way to propitiate the ancestors, whom  
the brahmins represent, and thus whatever is given to brahmins is given symbolically to the ancestors. On the other  
hand, giving such gifts is also a rite of  
protection against misfortune in an  
inauspicious time, since the receiver is  
believed to take away the bad luck along  
with the gift.
