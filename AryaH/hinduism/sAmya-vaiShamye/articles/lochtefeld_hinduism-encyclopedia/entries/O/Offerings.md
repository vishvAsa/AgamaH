One of the pervasive realities in Hindu  
religious life is the importance of transactions or exchanges—both between  
human beings, and between humans and  
superhuman beings. The importance of  
these exchanges makes various offerings a  
fundamental part of Hindu **worship**. One  
set of sixteen offerings, known as the  
**upacharas**, are given to a **deity** as part of  
worship, on the model of treating the deity  
as an honored guest—inviting the deity  
inside, offering the deity a seat, a drink of  
**water**, and so forth. In the **naivedya**, one  
offers the deity food, perhaps the most  
fundamental courtesy of all.
