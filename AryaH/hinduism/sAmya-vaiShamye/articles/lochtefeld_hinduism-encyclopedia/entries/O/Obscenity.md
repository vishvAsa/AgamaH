title = "Obscenity"

Traditional Hindu culture can be characterized as straightlaced, even prudish,  
with regard to sexuality; any public  
mention of sexuality is taboo in polite  
society. The exception of ritually sanctioned obscenity comes before and during the festival of **Holi**, which usually  
occurs in March. Holi is a “festival of  
reversal,” in which most social taboos  
are temporarily suspended. Holi comes  
very close to the end of the lunar **year**,  
and symbolizes the end of time, when all  
norms and standards have been lost. In  
recent times the license and lawlessness  
associated with Holi have led many people to stop celebrating it in public, particularly in the cities.
