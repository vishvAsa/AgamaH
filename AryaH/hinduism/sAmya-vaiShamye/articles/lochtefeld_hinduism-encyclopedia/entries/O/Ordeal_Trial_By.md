title = "Ordeal, Trial By"

+++
Trial by ordeal was one of the traditional  
means for establishing a person’s guilt or  
innocence. Ordeals were considered a  
“divine” proof, but could only be used in  
cases when human proofs such as evidence or eyewitness testimony were  
inadequate or unobtainable. Crimes  
committed in secret or in lonely places,  
questions of sexual consent, or money  
left for deposit were proven by these trials, following a carefully established ritual procedure. The trial could be done in  
four different ways: **fire**, **water**, balance,  
or poison.  
The fire ordeal entailed carrying a  
red-hot iron ball, licking a red-hot plowshare, or removing a ring or coin from a  
vessel of boiling oil, with guilt or innocence established by whether or not one  
was burned. The water ordeal entailed  
remaining underwater for a specified  
length of time, with guilt determined by  
the inability to do so. The balance ordeal  
was done by successive weighings, with  
the conviction that a guilty person  
would become progressively heavier.  
The poison ordeal was performed either  
by consuming poison, or by safely  
removing a coin from an earthen pot  
containing a cobra; innocence was  
established by surviving.  
There were fairly strict prescriptions  
governing which of these ordeals certain  
people were allowed to perform.  
**Women**, the elderly, and the infirm were  
subjected to the test of balance; **brahmins** were generally forbidden from  
undertaking ordeal by poison. In every  
case the actual ordeal was preceded by  
the person proclaiming his or her innocence, followed by declarations praising  
the saving **power of truth** and the  
damning force of untruth. Historians  
speculate that these required declarations helped make the ordeal more reliable. For instance, in the ordeal of  
licking a red-hot plowshare, a guilty person might be significantly more nervous  
and thus have less moisture on the  
tongue. Similarly, the nervousness during the water ordeal may have impeded

a person’s ability to hold his breath.  
Whether or not these speculations have  
any merit, the most important feature in  
the original Hindu context was the belief  
in the power of truth itself.
