title = "Omkareshvar"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) on an  
island in the **Narmada River** in the state  
of **Madhya Pradesh**, about fifty miles  
southeast of the city of Indore. The temple is named after its presiding **deity**, the  
god **Shiva** in his manifestation as the  
“Lord of [the sound] **Om**,” an utterance  
482  
Obscenity  
claimed to symbolize the entire universe, according to the early speculative texts known as the **Upanishads**.  
Omkareshvar is one of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a network of sites at  
which Shiva is uniquely present.  
According to the site’s mythic charter,  
Shiva appears there to reward the sage  
Mandhata, who has performed harsh  
**asceticism** (**tapas**) to gain a vision of  
Shiva. The image at the site is a “selfmanifested” (**svayambhu**) form of  
Shiva—an unshaped, roundish black  
stone emerging from the **earth**, while  
nearby is a white stone considered to  
be a manifestation of Shiva’s wife,  
**Parvati**. Viewing this image is believed  
to grant all of one’s desires, just as it did  
for Mandhata. **Worship** at the site continues all year, but during **Kartik**  
**Purnima**, the **full moon** in the **lunar**  
**month** of **Kartik** (October–November),  
there is a major bathing (**snana**) festival  
at the site.
