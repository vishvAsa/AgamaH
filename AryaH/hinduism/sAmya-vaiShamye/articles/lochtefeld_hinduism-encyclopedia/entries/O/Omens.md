title = "Omens"

+++
The notions of **auspiciousness** and  
**inauspiciousness** are deeply rooted in  
Hindu life, and are based on the  
assumption that by their very nature  
certain things bring good fortune, and  
certain other things bring ill fortune.  
The notion of omens is an extension of  
this idea; omens are important not  
because they cause good or bad fortune  
in themselves, but because they indicate  
conditions that are present. According  
to this belief, auspicious conditions will  
automatically give rise to favorable  
omens, and inauspicious conditions to  
unfavorable omens. Omens serve as  
indicators to help judge the current state  
of affairs and make any necessary  
adjustments. For example, if on leaving  
the house to do some business one sees  
a person deemed inauspicious, one  
should return to the home and begin  
again, lest the work be fruitless.
