The festival of Onam, in the southern  
Indian state of **Kerala**, is celebrated  
in the Malayalam month of Chingal,  
which corresponds to the northern  
Indian month of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September). Onam is a fourday harvest festival highlighted by races  
in elaborately carved boats known as  
“snake boats,” some of which are large  
enough to carry 100 paddlers. The most  
famous of these boat races are held in  
the Keralan town of Aleppey.
