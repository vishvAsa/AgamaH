title = "Om"

+++
A sacred sound. According to tradition,  
it should be uttered before and after  
reading the **Vedas** (the oldest Hindu religious texts), saying any prayer, or performing any sacred rite. When uttered at  
the beginning of a rite, it is believed to  
remove obstacles, and when uttered at  
the end it is seen as a concluding affirmation. Because of its pervasive ritual  
use, the sound *Om* is regarded as the  
essence of all holy speech. As early as  
the **Mandukya Upanishad**, the soundâ€™s  
phonetic elements (A, U, and M) were  
interpreted as corresponding to different states of consciousness, and ultimately designating the Self (**atman**). See  
also **four states of consciousness**.
