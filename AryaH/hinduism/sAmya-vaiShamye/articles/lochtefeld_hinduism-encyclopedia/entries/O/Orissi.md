One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are **Kathak**,  
**Bharatanatyam**, **Kuchipudi**, **Kathakali**,  
and **Manipuri**. Dance in **Orissa** dates to  
the second century B.C.E.; the present  
Orissi style has its roots in the dance  
performed at the temple of the god  
**Jagannath** in **Puri**. The temple itself was  
built in the eleventh century; the subsidiary part, known as the **natamandira**  
(“dance-hall”), was built about a century  
later. The latter period was the era of the  
poet **Jayadeva**, whose lyric poem, the  
**Gitagovinda**, is the only non-scriptural  
poem that can be recited in the temple.  
According to tradition, Jayadeva’s wife,  
Padmavati, was one of the dancers in  
the temple, and it was she who first  
danced parts of the *Gitagovinda* as an  
**offering** to Jagannath. As dance at the  
484  
Organs of Action  
Temple to the sun at Konarak, in Orissa.  
temple evolved, two categories of temple dancers emerged: those allowed to  
dance in the inner sanctum, and those  
allowed to dance in the natamandira.  
In the seventeenth century, a third  
type of dance emerged—boys dressed  
as dancing girls performed for general  
entertainment both outside and inside  
the temple. The latter dance tended to  
be more athletic and acrobatic, whereas the women’s dance was more gentle  
and lyrical.  
The modern Orissi style combines  
both elements. The most characteristic  
stance is the chauka (“square”), in which  
the feet are spread wide and pointed in  
opposite directions, with the knees  
bent so that the upper leg is parallel to  
the ground. The arms are held in a mirroring position, bent at the elbow with  
the upper arms horizontal, and the  
lower arms and hands pointing straight  
down. The dance’s stylistic impression  
is one of roundness and fluidity, created by rippling movements in the upper  
body during the dance. As in all the  
Indian dances, Orissi has a well-developed vocabulary of **gesture** and expression, making complex story-telling  
possible. The modern Orissi dance form  
has been shaped by the shift from temple to stage in the twentieth century;  
this change of venue has been primarily  
responsible for its “classical” form  
becoming more rigidly defined than in  
the past. For further information see
