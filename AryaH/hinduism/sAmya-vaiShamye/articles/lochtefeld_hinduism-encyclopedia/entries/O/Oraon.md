title = "Oraon"

+++
Northern Indian tribal (**adivasi**) community. The Oraons are concentrated  
in the southwestern corner of modern  
**Bihar**, in the geologic region known as  
the Ranchi Plateau. The land is quite  
poor, and for many life is very difficult.  
For a discussion of the difficulties of  
Oraon life, see Sudhir Kakar, *Shamans*,  
*Mystics, and Doctors*, 1991.
