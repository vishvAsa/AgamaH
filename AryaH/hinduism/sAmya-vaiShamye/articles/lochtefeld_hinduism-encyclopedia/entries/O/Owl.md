title = "Owl"

In Hindu mythology, the owl is the animal vehicle of **Lakshmi**, the **goddess**.  
Just as the owl is popularly believed to  
have trouble seeing in the daytime, a  
person pursuing “Lakshmi” (money and  
prosperity) will be single-minded  
toward it and unable to “see” anything  
else, such as deeper wisdom. In modern  
**Hindi**, calling someone an “owl” is a mild  
insult, referring to the other as a “fool.”
