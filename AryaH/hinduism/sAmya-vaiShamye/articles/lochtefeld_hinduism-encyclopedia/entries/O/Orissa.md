title = "Orissa"

+++
A state in modern India on the eastern  
coast between the states of **Andhra**  
**Pradesh** and **West Bengal**. Orissa traces  
its roots to the kingdom of Kalinga and  
the bloody conquest by the Mauryan  
emperor **Ashoka** (r. 269–232 B.C.E.).  
During the early medieval period the  
Kesari and **Ganga** dynasties built stunning temples, many of which exist today.  
Modern Orissa is largely undeveloped,  
and a large percentage of its people are  
indigenous tribal peoples (**adivasis**).  
Historically, Hindu culture has been  
manifest in the coastal regions, whereas  
the interior has been tribal land. Orissa’s  
sacred sites include the Ganga-era  
temples in the state capital of  
**Bhubaneshvar**, the sacred city of **Puri**,  
and the temple to the **Sun** at **Konarak**.
