In Indian **philosophy**, an eighth-century proponent of the **Bhedabhada**  
(“identity-in-difference”) school. The  
Bhedabhada position identified three  
levels of being: the Ultimate Reality  
known as **Brahman**, the “witness”  
consciousness (**sakshin**) in the  
human being, and the world. They  
paradoxically asserted that these three  
levels were identical, yet different.  
Thus the world is identical to Brahman  
but subject to change and decay,  
unlike Brahman. In the same way,  
while each human soul is identical  
to Brahman, it is also subject to  
bondage and reincarnation (**samsara**),  
unlike Brahman. The bondage of the  
soul was caused by the primal  
ignorance known as **avidya**, but  
it could be erased by a combination  
of action and awareness (**jnanakarmasamucchaya**). The basic philosophical problem for the Bhedabhada  
school was that because they believed  
that Brahman was actually transformed into the world and the Self  
(**parinamavada**), it followed that  
Brahman was subject to bondage and  
ignorance. This idea was difficult to  
defend, since the transcendence of  
Brahman was well established by

Bhaskara  
sacred texts such as the **Upanishads**,  
and this problem may account for the  
school’s relatively short life.
