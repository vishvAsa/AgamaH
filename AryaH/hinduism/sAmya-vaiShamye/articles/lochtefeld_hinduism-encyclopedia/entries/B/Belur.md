title = "Belur"

Town in the state of **Karnataka**, about  
sixty miles northwest of the modern city  
of Mysore. As at its sister site, **Halebid**,  
Belur is known for a magnificent collection of temples built by the **Hoysala**  
**dynasty**, which ruled western Karnataka  
from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries C.E. At both sites the temples were  
built from a particular type of stone—  
variously described as chlorite schist,  
steatite, or soapstone—that was quite  
soft when newly quarried but gradually  
hardened with exposure to the air. This  
initial malleability made the stone easy  
to carve and facilitated the lush detail  
characteristic of Hoysala temples.  
Architecturally speaking, these temples  
have certain unique features: a central  
hall connecting three star-shaped sanctuaries, and temple towers (**shikharas**)  
composed of well-defined horizontal  
tiers rather than the continuous upward  
sweep characteristic of the northern  
Indian **Nagara** architectural style.
