title = "Bhushundi"

+++
A character in the **Ramcharitmanas**,  
the version of the **Ramayana** written by  
the poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623?).  
Bhushundi is a crow who symbolizes the  
power of devotion to God to redeem  
even the lowest of creatures. One of the  
most pronounced differences between  
the original **Valmiki** *Ramayana* and the  
Tulsidas *Ramayana* is that Tulsidas puts  
113  
Bhushundi  
far greater stress on devotion to **Rama**,  
of which Bhushundi is a perfect example. In Indian culture, crows are considered unclean birds since they are  
scavengers who will eat anything. Yet in  
one of the narrative levels of the  
*Ramcharitmanas*, it is the “unclean”  
crow Bhushundi who narrates the story  
to the “sacred” eagle **Garuda**—the vehicle of the god **Vishnu**. As part of his  
account in the *Ramayana*, Bhushundi  
relates the terrifying experience of being  
given an unmediated vision of Rama in  
all his majesty, and how he (as did the  
sage **Markandeya**) went into Rama’s  
mouth and perceived the entire universe inside.
