title = "Bhartrprapancha"

(7th c. C.E.) In Indian **philosophy**, the  
first exponent of the **Bhedabhada**  
(“identity-in-difference”) philosophical  
school. The period during which  
Bhartrprapancha flourished is uncertain, but he precedes the eighth-century  
Bhedabhada commentator **Bhaskara**.  
The Bhedabhada position identified  
three levels of being: the Ultimate  
Reality known as **Brahman**, the “witness” consciousness (**sakshin**) in the  
human being, and the world. This  
school paradoxically asserted that these  
three levels were identical, yet different.  
Thus the world is identical to Brahman  
but subject to change and decay, unlike  
Brahman. In the same way, while each  
human soul is identical to Brahman, it is  
also subject to bondage and reincarnation (**samsara**), unlike Brahman. The

An image of the god Vithoba. Bharud poetry was  
composed by poet-saints in the Varkari Panth,  
a religious community devoted to Vithoba.  
bondage of the soul was caused by the  
primal ignorance known as **avidya**, but  
it could be erased by a combination of  
action and awareness (**jnanakarmasamucchaya**). The basic philosophical problem for Bhartrprapancha  
and his followers came from their belief  
that Brahman was actually transformed  
into both the world and the Self, a  
philosophical outlook known as **parinamavada**. Since they believed that  
Brahman underwent real changes, it  
was subject to bondage and ignorance.  
This position was untenable and unacceptable from a religious perspective  
because Brahman was deemed to be  
perfect and unchanging. This difficulty  
may account for the school’s relatively  
short life.
