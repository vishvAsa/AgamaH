One of the four major organizational  
groups of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
renunciant ascetics who are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**; the other  
three groups are **Kitawara**, **Bhogawara**,  
and **Anandawara**. Each of these groups  
has its headquarters in one of the four  
monastic centers (**maths**) supposedly  
established by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. Each division also has  
certain religious associations: with one  
of the four **Vedas**, with a particular quarter of the Indian subcontinent, with one  
of the “great utterances” (**mahavakyas**)  
expressing ultimate truth, with a particular ascetic quality, and with several of  
the ten Dashanami divisions. The  
Bhuriwara group is affiliated with the  
**Shringeri Math** in the southern Indian  
town of **Shringeri** and is thus connected  
with the southern quarter of India. Their  
**Veda** is the **Yajur Veda**, their mahavakya  
is **Aham Brahmasmi** (“I am **Brahman**”),  
and their ascetic quality is to renounce  
all wealth and to live on food growing  
wild in the jungles. The specific divisions associated with this group are  
**Saraswati Dashanami**, **Bharati**  
**Dashanami**, and **Puri Dashanami**.
