(“simple lord”) Common epithet of the  
god **Shiva**. In ordinary usage the word  
*bhola* carries a negative connotation:  
“simple,” “guileless,” and even “foolish.”  
Yet in using this word to designate Shiva,  
his devotees (**bhakta**) are not intentionally insulting him but celebrating his  
boundless generosity to those with  
whom he is pleased. Shiva’s devotees  
can give the simplest **offerings** (such as  
leaves, fruit, and **water**) and in turn ask  
for wealth, success, and power. Shiva’s  
nature is considered “simple” because  
he willingly participates in such unequal  
exchanges, providing sharp contrast to  
the world economy, which demands  
equal value.
