title = "Balabhadra"

+++
Epithet of the mythic hero **Balarama**,  
the god **Krishna’s** older brother.  
Although he is a fairly minor mythic  
figure, he is important for his connection with the temple of **Jagannath** in  
the city of **Puri**. The temple’s presiding **deity** is Jagannath (“Lord of the  
World”), a tribal god who has been  
assimilated into the Hindu pantheon  
as a form of Krishna. The image of  
Jagannath appears together with two  
other images, Balabhadra and their  
sister **Subhadra**, and the three deities  
invariably appear as a group.  
The poet **Jayadeva**, in his list of the  
ten **avatars** (“divine incarnations”)  
typically associated with the god  
**Vishnu**, named Balabhadra as the  
eighth avatar, the place normally  
occupied by Krishna. According to  
Jayadeva, Jagannath/Krishna is not a  
82  
Bajrang Dal  
form of Vishnu but the Ultimate Reality  
from whom all the avatars spring.
