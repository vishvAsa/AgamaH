title = "Bana Linga"

+++
An egg-shaped stone considered a  
svayambhu (“self-manifested”) form of  
the god **Shiva**. As with all **svayambhu**  
**images**, the bana linga is considered to  
be extraordinary, since in it the god has  
spontaneously revealed himself. Bana  
lingas are only found in certain places,  
particularly on the banks of the  
Chambal River in the state of **Madhya**  
**Pradesh**, where they can be found in  
large numbers. They come in a wide  
spectrum of colors and can be several  
feet in width, although most are smaller.  
The smaller ones are movable and may  
even be carried by wandering **ascetics** as  
portable objects of **worship**. The larger  
ones are usually found only in temples,  
not only because of the limits on motion  
imposed by their greater size, but also  
because they are believed to be so powerful that they should be kept in a carefully maintained place.
