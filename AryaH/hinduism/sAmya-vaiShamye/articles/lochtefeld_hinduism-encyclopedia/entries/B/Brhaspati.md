In Hindu mythology, Brhaspati is a sage  
chosen by the **deities** (**devas**) as their  
**guru**, or spiritual teacher. Brhaspati is  
also one of the names used to designate  
the planet **Jupiter**, since in Hindu astrology this planet is the most significant,  
and thus the symbolic “guru” among  
the **planets**.
