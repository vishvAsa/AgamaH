title = "Bhima"

+++
The third of the five **Pandava** brothers  
who are the heroes in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics. Bhima is born when his  
mother, **Kunti**, uses a powerful **mantra**  
(sacred sound) to have a **son** by the  
**wind**-god, **Vayu**. Of all the Pandavas,  
Bhima is the largest and strongest, and  
his favorite weapon is the club, which  
requires great physical strength. This  
strength is one of the sources of enmity  
between the Pandavas and the  
**Kauravas** (cousins of the Pandavas),  
since during their adolescent training,  
Bhima can always draw on his superior  
power to outdo his cousins. His earthy  
and untamed nature is evident through  
his consumption of strange foods as well  
as from his liaison with the **rakshasi**  
(female **demon**) Hidambi, by whom he  
has a son, **Ghatotkacha**. Bhima’s notable  
deeds tend to be feats of strength. In  
many cases this involves killing demons,  
such as **Bakasur** or Hidamba in hand-tohand combat; but Bhima is also a major  
figure in the Mahabharata war, in which  
he uses his club to kill great masses of the  
Kaurava army.  
Besides his strength and unusual  
appetites, which make him a figure subject to caricature, Bhima is also  
absolutely devoted to his brothers and  
to their common wife, **Draupadi**.  
Whenever her honor is at stake, Bhima is  
the person to whom she turns. When  
Draupadi is molested by **Kichaka** during  
the year that the Pandavas spend incognito at the court of King **Virata**, Bhima  
disguises himself as Draupadi, goes to  
meet Kichaka, and kills him. It is also  
Bhima who vows to kill the two  
Kaurava brothers, **Duhshasana** and  
**Duryodhana**, because of their behavior  
toward Draupadi after Bhima’s brother  
109  
Bhima  
**Yudhishthira** loses an important game  
of dice. Duhshasana drags Draupadi  
into the hall by her **hair**, her garments  
stained with menstrual **blood**, and  
Duryodhana bares his thigh (a  
euphemism for the genitals) toward  
Draupadi and directs her to sit on his  
lap. Bhima vows that to avenge these  
insults he will rip open Duhshasana’s  
chest so that Draupadi can wash her  
hair in his blood, and smash  
Duryodhana’s thigh with his club.  
Although it takes thirteen years before  
he carries out these promises, in the end  
he avenges Draupadi’s honor. After the  
Mahabharata war, Bhima aids his  
brother Yudhishthira in reigning as king.  
After Yudhishthira abdicates the throne,  
Bhima travels with him and their other  
brothers on a great journey to the  
**Himalayas**, where Bhima eventually  
dies of exposure.
