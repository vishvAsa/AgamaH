title = "Bhandarkar, R G"

+++
(1837â€“1925) **Sanskrit** scholar and intellectual who was the first Indian to serve  
as professor of Sanskrit at **Deccan**  
College, in Poona. Bhandarkar was one  
of the first Indian academics to combine  
the traditional mastery of Sanskrit texts  
with critical and objective research, a  
project that until then had been confined to European scholars. Bhandarkar  
is emblematic of Indian intellectuals in  
the late nineteenth century, who began  
by learning from the Europeans but  
were then able to work with the best of  
them. Bhandarkar authored two  
Sanskrit workbooks and numerous  
scholarly texts, but his most significant  
legacy is the **Bhandarkar Oriental**  
**Research Institute**; it was founded in  
1917 by his students, friends, and admirers and is still a highly respected  
research institution.
