title = "Belagave"

+++
Village in the Shimoga district of the  
state of **Karnataka**. Belagave was the  
most important center for the  
**Kalamukhas**, which was an **ascetic** sect  
of devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**.  
The Kalamukhas had an important historical role in southern India between  
the tenth and thirteenth centuries,  
but they disappeared some time after  
that. Their ritual center in Belagave  
was the temple of Kedareshvara, which  
was Shiva in his form as the lord of  
Kedara. Although the Kalamukhas  
have disappeared, their presence and  
prominence in the region are confirmed  
by the **inscriptions** at this and  
numerous other temples.
