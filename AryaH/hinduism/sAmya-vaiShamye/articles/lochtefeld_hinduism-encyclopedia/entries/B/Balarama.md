title = "Balarama"

+++
**Krishna’s** older brother. According to  
most estimations, Balarama is a partial  
**avatar**, or incarnation, of **Shesha**, a serpent upon whom the god **Vishnu**  
reclines as on a couch. Shesha takes  
human form as Balarama, and Vishnu  
takes human form as Krishna, to destroy  
the evil king **Kamsa**. Kamsa has imprisoned their parents, **Vasudeva** and  
**Devaki**, because on their wedding day a  
disembodied voice has foretold that  
Devaki’s eighth child will kill Kamsa.  
Kamsa kills Devaki’s first six children at  
**birth** by flinging them onto stones, but  
Balarama is saved when the embryo in  
Devaki’s womb is magically transplanted into the womb of Vasudeva’s second  
wife, **Rohini**. Because of the unusual  
83  
Balarama  
circumstances surrounding his development *in utero*, Balarama is also known  
as **Sankarshana** (“dragging away”).  
Balarama is raised with Krishna in  
**Nanda** and **Yashoda’s** household and  
takes part in many of Krishna’s adventures, including the slaying of Kamsa.  
Balarama is usually portrayed as having a fair complexion, whereas Krishna  
is dark. According to one story, when the  
gods approach Vishnu to take form on  
**earth**, he plucks both a white **hair** and a  
black hair from his head. The former is  
born to Rohini as Balarama, the latter to  
Devaki as Krishna.  
**Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda** presents a  
different picture of Balarama. Jayadeva  
is closely linked to the **Jagannath** temple in **Puri**, whose presiding **deity**  
(Jagannath) has been assimilated into  
the pantheon as Krishna. For Jayadeva,  
Jagannath/Krishna is not a form of  
Vishnu but the Ultimate Reality from  
whom all the avatars spring. Jayadeva  
incorporates Balarama into the pantheon as the eighth avatar, to fill the  
place left by Krishna’s promotion to  
supreme god.
