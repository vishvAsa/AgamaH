title = "Bhanita"

+++
In poetry, particularly the vernacular  
form of the **bhakti** poets, a signature  
line in which the author is identified by  
name. This line has two major functions:  
to identify the poet and to provide a  
summation of the poem’s message. The  
word *bhanita* comes from a verb meaning “to speak,” and by adding a signature  
line the poet is stamping his or her  
authorship on the poem. Of course,  
there is nothing to prevent others from  
doing this as well. In a performance context, the poet’s name comes at the  
beginning of the final line and alerts the  
audience to pay special attention to that  
line, which often sums up the entire  
poem’s message.
