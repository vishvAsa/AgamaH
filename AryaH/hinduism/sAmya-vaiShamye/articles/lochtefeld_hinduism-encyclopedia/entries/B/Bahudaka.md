title = "Bahudaka"

+++
(“having much **water**”) The name for  
one of four particular types of Hindu  
**ascetics**. Each of these four types  
reflects the ascetic’s supposed means of  
livelihood, which in practice has been  
much less important for ascetic identity  
than organizational affiliation. The  
Bahudaka is an ascetic who begs for his  
food at sacred bathing places. The other  
three types are the **Kutichaka**, which  
has lower status than the Bahudaka, and  
the **Hamsa** and **Paramahamsa**, which  
have higher status.
