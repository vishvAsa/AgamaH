title = "Bhramari"

+++
(“circling”) Powerful form of the  
**Goddess**. Bhramari takes form to  
oppose the **demon** Aruna, who in his  
hubris is trying to compromise the  
chastity of the gods’ wives. They implore  
the Goddess to help them, and in her  
form as Bhramari, she kills the demon  
and removes the threat. Bhramari is  
worshiped on the eighth night of  
**Navaratri**, a nine-**day** festival in which  
one goddess is appeased every night.
