title = "Bhishma Ashtami"

+++
Festival celebrated on the eighth **day**  
(ashtami) of the light, or waxing, half of  
the **lunar month** called **Magh**  
(January–February), marking the death  
of **Bhishma**. Bhishma is an uncle to  
both the **Kauravas** and the **Pandavas**,  
warring factions in the Hindu epic  
**Mahabharata**. He is well known for his  
bravery, continence, and truthfulness.  
He also has the power to choose the  
time of his death. Although he is mortally wounded in the great Mahabharata  
war, he remains alive until **weeks** later  
(delivering discourses and advice to the  
victorious Pandavas the entire time),  
delaying his death until the **sun** has  
resumed its northward course  
(**uttarayana**). On this day parents give  
**offerings** of food and **water** in  
Bhishma’s name in the hope that their  
**sons** may have his good qualities.
