title = "Braj"

+++
Northern Indian region on the **Yamuna**  
**River**, south of the modern city of Delhi.  
According to Hindu tradition, Braj is the  
land where the god **Krishna** lived during  
his time on **earth**. The Braj region does  
not have clearly defined boundaries,  
and the name has never referred to an  
official administrative area. Instead it  
has been defined by popular piety.  
Krishna’s devotees (**bhakta**) place great  
emphasis on visualizing his exploits as a  
way to attain communion with him, and  
thus places throughout the Braj region  
are associated with very specific incidents in Krishna’s life. As it now stands,  
the southern and eastern borders of the  
region are just over five miles southeast  
of the city of **Mathura**, and its northern  
and western boundaries are nearly five  
times that distance. For extensive information on Braj and its culture, see A. W.  
Entwistle, *Braj*, 1987.
