title = "Belur Math"

+++
World headquarters of the **Ramakrishna**  
**Mission**, a modern religious organization. The Ramakrishna Mission was  
founded in 1897 by **Swami**  
**Vivekananda**, the most famous disciple  
of the nineteenth-century Bengali  
mystic **Ramakrishna**. The Mission is  
equally dedicated to both social service  
and spiritual uplift, based on  
Vivekanandaâ€™s realization that India  
needed concrete development as much  
as religious teaching. Belur Math was  
constructed in 1899, two years after  
the Ramakrishna Mission was founded.  
It is located just north of Calcutta on  
the west side of the Hugli River, quite  
close to the **Dakshineshwar** temple  
where Ramakrishna lived for most of  
his adult life.
