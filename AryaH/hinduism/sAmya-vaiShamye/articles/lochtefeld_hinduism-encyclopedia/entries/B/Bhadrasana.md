(“decent posture”) In **yoga** practice this  
is one of the sitting postures (**asana**)  
described in commentaries to the **Yoga**  
**Sutras**. In this position the legs are  
crossed with the feet tucked under the  
thighs so that the crossed heels form a  
cavity around the scrotum. This is called  
the “decent posture” because the  
cupped hands are placed over the cavity  
made by the heels, covering the private  
parts. In Hindu iconography this is one  
of the common postures in which  
images of the **deities** are portrayed.
