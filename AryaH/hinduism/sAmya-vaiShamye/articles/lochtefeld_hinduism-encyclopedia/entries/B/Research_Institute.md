(BORI) Research institute founded in  
1917 and named after the great scholar  
**R**. **G**. **Bhandarkar** (1837–1925). The  
Institute is devoted to the study and  
preservation of traditional Indian culture, and it is respected in scholarly circles throughout the world. Its two most  
important publications have been P. V.  
Kane’s *History of Dharmasastra* and a  
multivolume critical edition of the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics. Aside from its publications,  
the Institute is also noted for its vast collection of **Sanskrit** manuscripts, which  
makes it one of the finest research  
establishments in all of India.
