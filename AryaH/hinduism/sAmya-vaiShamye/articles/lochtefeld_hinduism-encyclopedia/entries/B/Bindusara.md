title = "Bindusara"

+++
(3rd c. B.C.E.) **Son** of **Chandragupta**  
**Maurya**, the founder of the Mauryan  
empire, and father of **Ashoka**, the  
empire’s greatest figure. At Bindusara’s  
accession the Mauryans controlled the  
**Indus** and **Ganges** river basins.  
Bindusara not only consolidated his  
father’s gains, but also expanded  
Mauryan control into the **Deccan**  
region as far south as Mysore. He was  
reportedly a man of universal tastes,  
since tradition holds that he asked  
Antiochus I, the Seleucid ruler of Syria,  
for sweet wine, dried figs, and a sophist.  
Antiochus apparently sent the first two  
items but declared that Greek philosophers were not for export. See also  
**Maurya dynasty**.
