title = "Basavanna"

+++
(1106–67/68) Poet-saint and religious  
leader in the **Lingayat** community, a  
**bhakti** (devotional) group that worships **Shiva** as the single supreme God  
and rejects all **caste** regulations. The  
Lingayats were formed in the southern Indian state of **Karnataka** where  
they still have a considerable presence, and the collections of poetry  
that form their most important religious texts are composed in the  
**Kannada** language. According to tradition, from his youth Basavanna was  
a great devotee (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**,  
whose piety was so intense that he  
rejected all notions of ritual and caste.  
After spending much of his youth as a  
religious seeker, Basavanna became  
minister to a king named Bijjala.  
Basavanna used his position’s wealth  
and influence to care for Shiva’s wandering devotees (**jangama**), and  
Bijjala’s court became a magnet for  
many important figures, including the  
poet and religious leader **Allama**  
**Prabhu**. Basavanna’s patronage was  
vital in forming the Lingayat community, and as a token of his importance,  
the suffix *anna* (“elder brother”) was  
attached to his name, Basava. As the  
Lingayat community grew stronger,  
their public opposition to ritual **worship** and caste distinctions generated  
intense hostility from more traditional groups. This conflict finally came to  
87  
Basavanna  
a violent head when the fledgling  
Lingayat community apparently arranged  
a marriage between an **untouchable** boy  
and a **brahmin** girl. Traditionalists  
became so enraged that they executed the  
bride and groom’s fathers. The Lingayat  
community was dispersed, and  
Basavanna died soon afterward. For further information see A. K. Ramanujan
