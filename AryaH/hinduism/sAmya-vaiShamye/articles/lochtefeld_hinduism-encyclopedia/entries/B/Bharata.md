title = "Bharata"

+++
(2) In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Hindu epics, Bharata is the  
**son** of King **Dasharatha** by his wife  
**Kaikeyi** and the righteous younger  
brother of the god **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist. Bharata’s loyalty to his family  
has to endure several tests. The strictest  
one comes early in the epic when,  
through Kaikeyi’s treachery, Rama is  
sent into exile in the forest for fourteen  
years, and Bharata is named king in his  
place. Despite the obvious temptations  
of wealth and power, Bharata refuses to  
assume the throne in place of his  
brother, **curses** his mother for her  
deceit, and sets off to live in exile with  
Rama. Rama commands Bharata to  
return to **Ayodhya** and rule during  
his exile, on the premise that the people  
will suffer without a king. Bharata  
reluctantly agrees to act as a temporary  
king, but with two symbolic adjustments: He moves the court from the  
capital city of Ayodhya to the village  
of **Nandigrama** as a symbol of **Rama’s**  
exile, and throughout his rule sits at  
the foot of the royal throne; a pair of  
Rama’s sandals are placed upon the  
throne as a symbol of the rightful king.  
Many characters in the *Ramayana*  
are paradigms for Indian cultural values,  
and Bharata stands for the ideal younger  
brother. In the traditional joint household the brothers are the heart of the  
family, since it is they who remain at  
home their entire lives, whereas their  
sisters live with their husbands’ families  
after they are married. The eldest brother  
in every generation eventually becomes  
the head of the joint family after the  
older members have passed away. He  
carries primary authority and responsibility for the family as a whole but cannot succeed without the cooperation of  
his younger brothers, who must  
acknowledge and support his authority.  
By refusing to usurp his elder brother’s  
rightful leadership, Bharata is a paradigm for the ideal younger brother, who  
puts aside his own desires and opportunities to uphold and promote the welfare of the family as a whole.
