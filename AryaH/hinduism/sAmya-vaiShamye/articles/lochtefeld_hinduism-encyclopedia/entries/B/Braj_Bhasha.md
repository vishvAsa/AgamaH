title = "Braj Bhasha"

+++
The “language of **Braj**”; a dialect of  
medieval **Hindi** primarily spoken in the  
Braj region, south of the modern city of  
Delhi. Braj is the land associated with  
the god **Krishna**, and the devotion that  
flourished there between the fifteenth  
and eighteenth centuries made Braj  
Bhasha a major literary language. Aside  
from being the language of Krishna worshipers, it also functioned as a lingua  
franca—a common language used by  
diverse peoples—for religious devotees  
(**bhakta**) in a much larger area of northern  
India, although it varied at the borders.
