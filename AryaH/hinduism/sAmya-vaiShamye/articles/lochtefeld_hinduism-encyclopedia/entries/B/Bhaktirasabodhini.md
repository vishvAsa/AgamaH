(“Awakening the Delight in Devotion”)  
Name of a commentary on the  
**Bhaktamal** of **Nabhadas**; this commentary was written by **Priyadas** in 1712. In  
the *Bhaktamal*, Nabhadas had given  
brief six-line biographies of over two  
hundred contemporary **bhakti** (devotional) figures. These biographies are  
notably free of astonishing and miraculous events and usually stress the devotee’s personal qualities, to serve as a  
model for others. In the  
*Bhaktirasabodhini*, Priyadas gave greatly expanded accounts for each devotee  
mentioned by Nabhadas, often narrating amazing stories to which Nabhadas  
made no reference. In his biography of  
the poet-saint **Ravidas**, Nabhadas drew  
from the texts written by the biographer  
**Anantadas**, but in other cases his  
sources are not clear. The accounts in  
the *Bhaktirasabodhini* are suspect as  
genuine biographies of these saints,  
given Priyadas’s penchant for miraculous events and his chronological distance from his subjects. Still, the text is  
extremely valuable as a mirror of his  
time, and careful analysis can reveal  
much about contemporary religious  
tensions and issues.
