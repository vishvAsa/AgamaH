title = "Bharavi"

+++
(6th c. C.E.) **Sanskrit** dramatist who is  
best known as the author of the drama  
*Kiratarjuniya*. This play describes the  
meeting between the god **Shiva**, disguised as the tribal hunter Kirata, and  
the warrior-hero **Arjuna**. Arjuna is one  
of the five **Pandava** brothers, who are  
the heroes of the epic **Mahabharata**. In  
Hindu mythology, Arjuna is the worldâ€™s  
greatest warrior, but he is also afflicted  
with pride. The play describes how the  
arrogant Arjuna becomes humbled at  
the hands of this tribal hunter, who in  
contemporary terms would be of very  
low social status. In the end, however,  
Shiva reveals his true form to Arjuna and  
blesses him for his valor.
