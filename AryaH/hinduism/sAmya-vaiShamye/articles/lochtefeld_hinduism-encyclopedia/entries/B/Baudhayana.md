title = "Baudhayana"

+++
(6th–3rd c. B.C.E.) Sage, writer, and commentator. Baudhayana is the author of  
one of the three surviving religious texts  
known as the **Kalpa Sutras**. **Apastamba**  
and **Hiranyakeshin** wrote the other two  
Kalpa Sutras. Each of the surviving  
works contains the three elements dictated for a Kalpa Sutra: prescriptions for  
Vedic rituals (**Shrauta Sutras**), prescriptions for domestic rites (**Grhya Sutras**),  
and prescriptions for appropriate  
human behavior (**Dharma Sutras**). All  
three of the authors belonged to the  
same school, the Taittiriya school of the  
**Black Yajur Veda**. According to tradition,  
Baudhayana was the oldest, Apastamba  
was his disciple, and Hiranyakeshin was  
Apastamba’s disciple. This relative  
chronology is supported by the texts  
themselves, since Baudhayana’s work is  
much less organized than the others, his  
language is more archaic, and he is often  
less strict in his opinions. His texts gain  
their primary importance as a source for  
his successors.
