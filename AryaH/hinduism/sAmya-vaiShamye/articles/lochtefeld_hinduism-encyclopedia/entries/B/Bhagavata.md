title = "Bhagavata"

+++
(“devotees of the Blessed One”) General  
name for the earliest devotees (**bhakta**)  
of **Vishnu**, particularly the devotees of  
**Krishna**-Gopala, a deified cowherd hero  
who later became identified with  
Vishnu. Until the development of  
sectarian Vaishnavism in around  
the eleventh century C.E., the word  
*bhagavata* was a blanket term for all  
**Vaishnavas** except the Pancharatrikas,  
who were followers of the secret ritual  
tradition known as **Pancharatra**.
