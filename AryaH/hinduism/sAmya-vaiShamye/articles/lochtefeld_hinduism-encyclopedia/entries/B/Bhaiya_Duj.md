title = "Bhaiya Duj"

+++
Annual festival falling on the second  
**day** (duj) of the bright, or waxing, half  
of the **lunar month** of **Kartik**  
(October–November). This festival is celebrated to emphasize the bond between  
a brother (bhaiya) and sister. During  
Bhaiya Duj, married **women** invite their  
brothers into their homes, apply **tika**  
marks on their brothers’ foreheads as a  
sign of respect, and feed them sweets  
and a hearty meal. Sisters also tie a string  
around their brothers’ right wrists to  
symbolize the emotional bond between  
them and the brother’s obligation to protect his sister throughout her lifetime.  
Unmarried women host their brothers in  
the same way in their natal homes. In  
either case, on this day women should  
pray that their brothers have long lives  
and that they themselves be happily  
married. The brothers, in turn, give presents to their sisters.  
Aside from reaffirming the normal  
family love between brother and sister,  
this festival also emphasizes the protective role that brothers play in their sisters’ lives, particularly after women are  
married. The traditional pattern in  
northern India is for married women to  
live with their husbands’ families. Since  
women generally outlive their fathers,  
for most of her life a woman’s primary  
protectors will be her brothers. A woman  
without brothers is in a position of  
relative weakness. If nothing else, these  
yearly visits give brothers the chance to  
assess their sister’s happiness and the  
state of affairs in her married home.  
Such visits also notify the husband’s  
family that they are still concerned with  
her welfare.
