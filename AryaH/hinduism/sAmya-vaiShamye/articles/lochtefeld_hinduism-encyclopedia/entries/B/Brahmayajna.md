title = "Brahmayajna"

+++
(“**sacrifice** to **Brahman**”) One of the five  
great sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**)  
prescribed in the texts on religious duty  
(**Dharma Shastras**). These five great  
sacrifices are prescribed daily religious  
observances for a “**twice-born**” householder, that is, a householder who has  
been born into one of three groups in  
Indian society—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or  
**vaishya**. Such men are eligible for the  
adolescent religious **initiation** known as  
the “second birth.” Each of the five sacrifices (**yajna**) is directed toward a different class of beings, from the Ultimate  
Reality down to **animals**, and is satisfied  
by different actions. The brahmayajna is  
directed toward the Ultimate Reality  
(Brahman) and is satisfied by teaching  
and studying the **Vedas**, the oldest  
Hindu religious texts. In the time since  
the Dharma Shastras were composed,  
Hindu life has undergone significant  
change, but many brahmins still study  
the Veda—if not daily, at some point in  
their youth.
