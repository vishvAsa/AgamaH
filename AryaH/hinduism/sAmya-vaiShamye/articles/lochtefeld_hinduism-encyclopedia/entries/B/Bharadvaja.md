title = "Bharadvaja"

(2) (5th c. B.C.E.?) Religious scholar  
named as the author of a **Shrauta Sutra**  
(manual on prescriptions for **Vedic** rituals) and a **Grhya Sutra** (manual on  
domestic rites). The period during  
which he flourished is uncertain but  
must precede **Panini**, since this grammarian mentions Bharadvaja in the  
**Ashtadhyayi**. Given their interest in  
strengthening the authority of their  
sacred texts, many Hindus identify this  
author with the legendary sage  
Bharadvaja, although there is no hard  
evidence for this claim.
