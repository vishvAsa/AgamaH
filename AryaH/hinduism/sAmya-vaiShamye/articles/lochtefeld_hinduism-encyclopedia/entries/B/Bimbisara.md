title = "Bimbisara"

+++
(d. 494 B.C.E.) King of Magadha, the  
region corresponding to modern **Bihar**,  
whose reign ended shortly before the  
traditionally accepted date for the death  
of the Buddha. Bimbisara was an energetic administrator who had designs on  
ruling a much larger empire. To this end,  
he tried to conquer and control large  
parts of the **Ganges** basin. Bimbisara is  
believed to have been the first king to  
conceive of ruling a large empire,  
although he was deposed and murdered  
by his **son Ajatashatru** before he saw it  
become a reality.
