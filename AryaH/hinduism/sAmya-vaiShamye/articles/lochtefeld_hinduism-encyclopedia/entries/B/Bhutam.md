(7th c. C.E.) With **Pey** and **Poygai**, one of  
the first three **Alvars**, a group of twelve  
poet-saints who lived in southern India  
between the seventh and tenth centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**. Their stress  
on passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a  
personal god, conveyed through hymns  
sung in the **Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized Hindu religious  
life. According to tradition, the three  
men were caught in a torrential storm,  
and one by one they took shelter in a  
small dry spot, with each making room  
for the next. As they stood together they  
felt a fourth presence, which was  
Vishnu. The Alvars were such great  
devotees that their combined energy  
was sufficient to provoke Vishnuâ€™s manifestation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy,  
the three burst into song, which formed  
the first of their compositions. For further information see Kamil Zvelebil,
