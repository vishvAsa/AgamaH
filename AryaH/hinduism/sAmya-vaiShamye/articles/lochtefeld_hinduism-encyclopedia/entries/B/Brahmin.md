In the traditional Hindu theory of the  
four major social groups (**varnas**), the  
brahmins are the group with the highest status, based on the belief that they  
are purer than all others. This belief is  
based on the creation story known as  
the **Purusha Sukta**, in which the brahmins are created from the Primeval  
Man’s mouth. The mouth is part of the  
head and thus the highest part of the  
body, and it is also associated with  
speech, one of the definitively human  
faculties. From the earliest Hindu  
recorded history, brahmins have been  
associated with speech and the sacred  
word; they were the scholars, priests, ritual technicians, and protectors of sacred  
learning. This is still true in modern  
times, although there are also many  
brahmins who have other occupations, such as trade, business, and  
government service.  
Aside from their traditional association with sacred learning, their other  
source of social status is their ritual  
**purity**, which is believed to be greater  
than that of all other human beings. This  
ritual purity is inherent, conferred by  
**birth**. According to tradition, even an  
uneducated brahmin should be considered a “god on **earth**,” whereas a learned  
brahmin is more sacred still. This ritual  
purity makes brahmins preferable for  
service to many of the gods of the Hindu  
pantheon, since they are considered  
the best intermediaries to “insulate”  
the **deities** from ordinary people.  
Although brahmins as a whole have the  
highest status, within the brahmin community there are highly defined subgroups (**jatis**), which are often defined  
by region of origin.
