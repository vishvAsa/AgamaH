At its most basic level, birth is a biological event, but it becomes a cultural  
event by virtue of the rites performed for  
and significance given to it. Different  
Hindu communities show considerable  
regional and sectarian variation in the  
ways that they mark a birth, but several  
themes remain fairly constant. Although  
the birth of a child is a highly **auspicious**  
occasion, it is also considered impure  
because of the various bodily tissues  
and fluids coming with it (**blood**,

membranes, amniotic fluid, placenta,  
etc.). Thus, birth rituals usually include  
rites of purification for both mother and  
child, to remove this birth impurity  
(**sutakashaucha**). For the mother this is  
fairly simple: a bath after the birth followed by baths during a period of seclusion (7–10 days). The final rite for the  
child, the head **shaving** known as the  
**chudakarana samskara**, may not come  
for years after the birth.  
Aside from impurity (**ashaucha**),  
another constant theme is the threat of  
potential danger. Immediately after  
birth, both mother and child are seen as  
highly vulnerable, not only from environmental stresses such as cold, fatigue,  
or infection, but from ills brought on by  
**witchcraft** or the evil eye (**nazar**). Given  
this concern, it is not surprising that the  
placenta and all other childbirth  
byproducts are carefully collected and  
disposed of, lest they be used for spells.  
The period of seclusion after the birth is  
intended both to prevent contact with  
such malevolent forces and to ward  
them off through **rites of protection**.  
The mother is usually given massages  
and fed strengthening foods to bolster  
her resistance. The use of charms, or  
amulets, is also quite common. For further information see Lawrence Babb,
