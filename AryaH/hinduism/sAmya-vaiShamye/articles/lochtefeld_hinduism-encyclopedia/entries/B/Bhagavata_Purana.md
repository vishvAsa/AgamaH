title = "Bhagavata Purana"

+++
Sectarian religious text that is by far the  
most important text for the **worship** of  
94  
Bhagavan  
the god **Krishna** as the single Supreme  
Being. Internal evidence hints that it was  
written in southern India in the ninth or  
tenth century, making it much later than  
many of the other **puranas**. The bulk of  
the text focuses on Krishna’s early life in  
the village of **Brindavan**—infancy, childhood, and adolescence—but gives little  
attention to his later exploits as a king  
and hero. This purana’s best-known section is the tenth book, which describes  
Krishna’s amorous exploits with the local  
herd girls (**gopis**) as they pass the nights  
in a circle **dance** (**ras lila**) on the shores of  
the **Yamuna River**. The image of Krishna  
throughout the text is that of a god in  
constant play with the world. For  
Krishna’s devotees (**bhakta**), the supreme  
felicity comes with the opportunity to  
take part in that divine play (**lila**).
