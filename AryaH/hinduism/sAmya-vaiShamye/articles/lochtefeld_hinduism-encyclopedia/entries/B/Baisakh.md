According to the lunar **calendar** by  
which most Hindu religious festivals  
are determined, Baisakh is the second  
month of the lunar **year**, usually falling  
within April and May. This is established as one of the months of spring,  
but in northern India the weather is  
beginning to get quite warm at this  
time, especially in the middle of the  
day. The major holidays in Baisakh are  
**Shitalashtami**, **Baruthani Ekadashi**,  
**Parashuram Jayanti**, **Narasimha**  
**Jayanti**, **Baisakhi**, **Mohini Ekadashi**,  
and **Buddha Purnima**.
