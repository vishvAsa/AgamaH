Bihar  
incredibly rich history; it was the ancestral homeland of the **Maurya dynasty**,  
which ruled over much of the Indian  
subcontinent between the fourth and  
third centuries before the common era.  
The capital city was at **Pataliputra**, identified with modern Patna. Bihar also  
contains the town of Bodh Gaya, where  
the Buddha attained enlightenment,  
in addition to many other places  
associated with events in his life.  
Despite this lush past, modern Bihar  
is an extremely difficult place to live;  
illiteracy and infant mortality rates are  
very high, life expectancy is fairly low,  
and social conditions can best be  
described as feudal. Most of its citizens  
can barely make a living and do so  
through agriculture, while a small percentage are fabulously wealthy. Bihar is  
also a textbook example of what modern  
Indians call the “criminalization of politics,” in which known criminals are  
either agents for politicians or are themselves holding political office. Although  
Bihar has abundant mineral resources,  
its pervasive corruption virtually ensures  
that their benefits will reach only a few.  
Despite all of these disadvantages, Bihar  
does have well-known sacred sites  
(**tirthas**). One of these is the town of  
**Gaya**, famous as a place to perform  
funerary rites (**antyeshthi samskara**).  
Another sacred place is the temple at  
**Vaidyanath**, which is one of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a group of sites especially  
sacred to the god **Shiva**. For general  
information about Bihar and all the  
regions of India, an accessible reference
