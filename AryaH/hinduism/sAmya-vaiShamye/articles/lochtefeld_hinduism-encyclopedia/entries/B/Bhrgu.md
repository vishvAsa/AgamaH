title = "Bhrgu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the **sons** of  
**Brahma** and one of the seven sages  
whose names mark exogamous clan  
“lineages” (**gotra**); the others are  
**Kashyapa**, **Bharadvaja**, **Vasishtha**,  
**Gautama**, **Atri**, and **Vishvamitra**. All  
**brahmins** are believed to be descended  
from these seven sages, with each  
family taking the name of its progenitor  
as its gotra name. In modern times these  
divisions are still important since  
112  
Bhoja  
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.  
After her marriage the bride adopts  
her husband’s gotra as part of her  
new identity.  
Bhrgu is most famous for testing the  
three major Hindu gods, which results  
in **Vishnu** being declared the greatest of  
the three. Bhrgu first goes to Brahma’s  
house where the god does not pay Bhrgu  
appropriate respect, and in revenge  
Bhrgu **curses** Brahma to receive no **worship**. Next he goes to see **Shiva**, who  
refuses to meet with him because he is  
making love to his wife **Parvati** at the  
time. In turn, Bhrgu curses Shiva to be  
worshiped as the **linga**, the pillarshaped symbol that has undeniable  
phallic associations. Lastly he visits  
Vishnu and, finding him asleep, gives  
him a sound kick in the chest. Vishnu  
wakes up, but shows no anger at this disrespect. Instead he massages Bhrgu’s  
foot, gently inquires whether it has been  
hurt, and promises to retain its mark on  
his chest forever, where it appears as the  
**shrivatsa**. Vishnu’s magnanimous  
behavior leads Bhrgu to proclaim him  
the best of all the gods. Not surprisingly,  
this version of the tale appears only in  
**Vaishnava** sectarian literature. See also  
**marriage prohibitions**.
