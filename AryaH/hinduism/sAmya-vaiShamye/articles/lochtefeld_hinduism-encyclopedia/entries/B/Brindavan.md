title = "Brindavan"

+++
(“**tulsi** forest”) Small town in the  
**Mathura** district of the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**, which is the town in which the  
god **Krishna** is supposed to have lived  
during his childhood. Although every  
place in Brindavan is associated with the  
life of Krishna and is full of temples dedicated to him, one particularly important  
place is the **Chir Ghat**, at which Krishna  
stole the **gopis**’ clothes as they were  
bathing (**snana**) in the **Yamuna River**.  
(The gopis were female cowherds who  
were companions to Krishna during his  
youth.) An interesting architectural site  
is the **Gobind Deo Mandir**, built in 1590,  
which has a vaulted ceiling. This latter  
temple is also notable for its lack of exterior ornamentation, perhaps to avoid  
antagonizing the nearby Moghuls. For a  
description of the sacred life in  
Brindavan, see John Stratton Hawley, *At*  
*Play with Krishna*, 1981. See also  
**Moghul dynasty**.
