title = "Bhimashankar"

+++
(“**Bhima’s Shiva**”) One of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a group of sacred sites  
(**tirthas**) deemed especially holy to the  
god **Shiva**. Bhimashankar is the name of  
both the place and the presiding **deity**. It  
is located in **Maharashtra’s** Pune district  
at the source of the **Bhima River**, hence  
its name. Unlike many of the other  
jyotirlingas, Bhimashankar is visited little  
during the year since it is far from urban  
centers and relatively inaccessible. The  
major pilgrim traffic comes on the festival of **Shivaratri**, which usually falls  
within February and March.
