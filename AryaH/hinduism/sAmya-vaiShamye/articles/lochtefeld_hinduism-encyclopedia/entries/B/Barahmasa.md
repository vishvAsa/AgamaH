title = "Barahmasa"

+++
(“twelve months”) Poetic genre in which  
each of the poem’s verses, or stanzas, is  
devoted to one month of the **year**, with  
the months treated in chronological  
order. This is a purely vernacular genre  
for which there are no known instances  
in **Sanskrit**. Barahmasa poems often  
reveal a great deal about everyday life  
and can be subdivided into several basic  
categories: an enumerative type, which  
describes appropriate activities for each  
month such as farming or religious  
practice; a narrative form, which  
recounts a woman’s longing (**viraha**) for  
her absent lover; and a type describing a  
young wife’s trial of chastity as she withstands various temptations during an  
extended separation from her husband.
