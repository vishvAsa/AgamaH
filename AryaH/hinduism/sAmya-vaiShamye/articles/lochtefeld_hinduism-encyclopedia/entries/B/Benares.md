title = "Benares"

+++
City and sacred center (**tirtha**) on the  
banks of the **Ganges** in the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. Benares is an anglicized form  
of **Varanasi**, one of the traditional Hindu  
names for the city, as well as **Kashi** and  
**Avimukta**. All three of these names are  
used to designate the entire city, but in a  
more specific context, they denote concentric sacred zones surrounding the  
**Vishvanath** temple; Avimukta is the  
smallest, then Varanasi, and finally  
Kashi. As with all other pilgrimage  
places on the Ganges, Benares is considered sacred because of its proximity to  
the river, particularly because at Benares  
the Ganges flows in a northerly direction, which is considered auspicious.  
The Ganges is an integral part of the  
identity of Benares, and much of the  
city’s religious life centers around it.  
The most important sacred presence  
in the city, however, is the god **Shiva**.  
Benares is the city of Shiva, his dwelling  
place on **earth**, and the site he never  
leaves, hence the name Avimukta  
(“never forsaken”). Temples to Shiva are  
scattered throughout the city—some  
old, some new, some nearly forgotten—  
but the most important is the  
Vishvanath (“Lord of the Universe”)  
90  
Bel  
temple. Vishvanath is one of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a group of sites deemed  
particularly sacred to Shiva. The original  
Vishvanath temple was destroyed by the  
Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb**, who built  
a mosque on the site; the present  
Vishvanath temple was rebuilt next to  
the original location. Shiva’s eternal  
presence makes Benares one of the  
**seven sacred cities**, in which death  
brings liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
At the moment of death, Shiva is  
believed to come to the dying person  
and impart his salvific wisdom. Shiva’s  
presence is also evident at the **cremation ground** at the sacred site  
**Manikarnika Ghat**, which is in the very  
heart of the city rather than at the margin as in most other places. Here too  
Shiva teaches human beings a lesson;  
specifically, Shiva reminds them of their  
imminent death. This is not to distress  
or depress them, but to spur them on to  
serious religious life.  
The presence of the Ganges and  
Shiva make Benares an ideal place to  
die, or to immerse oneself in spiritual  
life; what is often overlooked is that  
Benares is also an unusually vibrant  
place to live. It has a long history as a  
trading center and market town, and it  
remains so today even though the creaking wooden boats traversing the Ganges  
have been supplemented by other  
means of transport. Benares is famous  
for its artisans, particularly weavers and  
metalworkers, many of whom are  
Muslim. It has also been renowned as a  
cultural center for at least a thousand  
years. Benares is still one of the most  
important centers in India for all  
branches of traditional Sanskritic learning, from grammar to astrology to medicine. It is likewise a center for music,  
**dance**, and all of the arts and has been  
home to a galaxy of Indian religious figures, including the poet-saints **Tulsidas**,  
**Ravidas**, and **Kabir**. For a detailed exposition of the city and its life, see Diana  
Eck, *Banaras,* 1999.
