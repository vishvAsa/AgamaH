title = "Brideprice"

+++
The money the groom’s family gives to  
the bride’s family as a condition for marriage. This exchange of money for the  
bride is the defining feature of the **asura**  
**marriage**, one of eight recognized forms  
of marriage in the **Dharma Shastras**, the  
treatises on religious duty (**dharma**).  
This form of marriage is considered  
**aprashasta** (“reprehensible”) because of  
the implication of selling one’s children.  
Even though it does take place in modern India, communities practicing this  
form have very low social status. In  
modern times, giving brideprice is an  
admission that the bride’s family  
deserves compensation for the loss of a  
wage earner, implying that her labor is  
necessary for the family. In contrast, the  
higher-status type of marriage, the  
**Brahma marriage**, transfers both the  
bride and wealth (in the form of a  
**dowry**) to the groom’s family with the  
understanding that both families have  
enough money that her paid labor  
is unnecessary.
