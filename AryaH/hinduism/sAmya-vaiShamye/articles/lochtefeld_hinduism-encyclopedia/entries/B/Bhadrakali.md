title = "Bhadrakali"

+++
(from *bhadra*, meaning “blessed” in  
**Sanskrit**) In Hindu mythology, the epithet  
of a powerful and terrifying form of the  
**Goddess**. According to one version of the  
story, Bhadrakali’s **birth** is associated with  
the death of **Shiva’s** first wife, **Sati**. Sati goes  
to a great **sacrifice** sponsored by her father,  
**Daksha**. When Daksha intentionally and  
publicly insults her husband Shiva, in her  
anger and shame, Sati immolates herself in  
the sacrificial **fire**. When Shiva learns of  
Sati’s death, he is so enraged that he plucks  
two matted locks (**jata**) from his head and  
dashes them to the ground. The first takes  
form as **Virabhadra**, a wrathful and terrifying form of Shiva, and the second takes  
form as Bhadrakali. Just as Virabhadra  
represents Shiva’s destructive aspect,  
Bhadrakali symbolizes the ferocious and  
dangerous side of the Goddess, in contrast  
with the gentle and loyal Sati. Shiva orders  
the two to destroy Daksha’s sacrifice, which  
they do with great abandon.  
Bhadrakali also appears in the stories  
connected with the birth of the god  
**Krishna**. While Krishna is developing in  
his mother, **Devaki’s**, womb, Bhadrakali  
enters the womb of Krishna’s foster  
mother, **Yashoda**. The two children are  
born on the same night, and under cover  
of darkness they are switched with one  
another. The next morning the baby girl is  
snatched from Devaki by her stepbrother,  
**Kamsa**, the wicked king of **Mathura**, who  
dashes out the child’s brains on a rock;  
this is just as he has done with Devaki’s six  
other children because it has been foretold that one of them will kill him. From  
the infant’s **corpse** arises an eight-armed  
figure of the Goddess, who taunts Kamsa  
that his destroyer has already escaped  
and then disappears.
