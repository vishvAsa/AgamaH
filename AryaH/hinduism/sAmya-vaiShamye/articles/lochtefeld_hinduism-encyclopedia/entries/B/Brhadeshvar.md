Temple built in the southern Indian city  
of **Tanjore** around the year 1000 B.C.E. by  
the Chola king **Raja Raja** (r. 985–1014).  
The temple is dedicated to the god **Shiva**  
in his form as Brhadeshvar (the “great  
lord”). It was built in the **Dravida** style  
characteristic of southern Indian temples, in which the buildings are of modest height but cover an immense area  
and are surrounded by a boundary wall  
with massive towers (**gopurams**) over  
each wall’s central gateway. The  
Brhadeshvar temple is famous as a center for traditional arts and culture, particularly as a home for the **dance** style  
known as **Bharatanatyam**. It also contains some exceptional **murals**, an  
126  
Braj  
extremely unusual feature in Indian  
temples. See also **Chola dynasty**.
