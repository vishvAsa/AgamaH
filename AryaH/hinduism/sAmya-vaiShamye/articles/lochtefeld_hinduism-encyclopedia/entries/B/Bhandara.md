(“storehouse”) A banquet given for large  
numbers of people—either by special  
invitation, restricted to certain classes of  
people (such as **ascetics**), or open to the  
general public. Sponsoring such a banquet is believed to generate considerable religious merit, but this is also a  
conspicuous opportunity for both the  
donor and attendees to enhance their  
status. Issues of status are also marked  
among the attendees. The most honored  
guests confer status on the donor simply  
by deigning to come, and accordingly  
such guests will be treated differently  
from the common lot. The rest of the  
guests generally get no such special  
treatment. They give status to the host  
by **eating** the food he (or she) has had  
prepared, but they get little in return  
other than the meal itself, which is usually of poor quality since the food is prepared in large quantities.  
Based on these considerations,  
ascetics with sufficient resources of their  
own will usually avoid such banquets  
because of both the quality of the food  
and the concerns over status. To eat at a  
bhandara is not only to confer prestige  
on the donor, but to lower one’s own  
status by appearing as though one  
needs to do this to survive. The main  
exception is when one has been invited  
as an honored guest, but even in these  
cases it is not unusual for such guests to  
eat little or nothing, thereby giving  
status by their presence but losing none  
through consumption.
