title = "Buddha Avatar"

+++
The ninth **avatar**, or “incarnation,” of  
the god **Vishnu**. As the only attested historical figure (and one who clearly differed with the Hindu orthodoxy of his  
time), the Buddha avatar shows how the  
avatar doctrine was used to envelop and  
assimilate existing religious figures.  
Although this designation as an avatar  
was an attempt to appropriate a significant religious figure by projecting him as  
an incarnation of Vishnu, this attempt’s  
transparency can be seen in the differing opinions over this avatar. In the  
opening chapter of his **Gitagovinda**, the  
poet **Jayadeva** claims that Vishnu incarnated as the Buddha to condemn the  
**animal sacrifices** prevalent in Vedic  
times. Other accounts portray him as  
misleading the wicked by instructing  
them to deny the authority of the **Vedas**  
(which the historical Buddha explicitly  
denied) and drive themselves into  
**hell**. Despite being named as one of  
the avatars, the Buddha was never  
worshiped by **Vaishnavas**, and  
Buddhists themselves have certainly  
never accepted this assertion.
