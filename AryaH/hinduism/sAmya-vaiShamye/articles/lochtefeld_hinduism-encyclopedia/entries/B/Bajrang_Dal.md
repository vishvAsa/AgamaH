(“**Hanuman’s** Host”) The Bajrang Dal  
is a modern Hindu organization that  
has strong connections with the Hindu  
nationalist **Vishva Hindu Parishad**  
(VHP), although both are nominally  
independent. The Bajrang Dal is  
sometimes characterized as the VHP’s  
“youth wing,” and its primary function  
is to aid the VHP in carrying out its religious, political, and social campaigns,  
particularly by supplying members to  
build a crowd. The god Hanuman is  
best noted for his prodigious strength,  
and it is this quality that the Bajrang  
Dal seems to have emphasized in  
choosing him as their symbol.  
Membership is open to young men  
from all social strata, but the organization reportedly draws much of its followers from lower-**caste** groups.  
Although local chapters of the Bajrang  
Dal often perform social services and  
philanthropic activities (as one might  
find with any organized group), as a  
whole the organization is widely seen  
as an instrument of the VHP, to be used  
when the situation calls for producing  
a crowd, intimidation, or violence.
