(“account book”) Name for the pilgrim  
registers maintained by hereditary pilgrimage priests (**pandas**). Each panda  
family in any sacred site (**tirtha**) has the  
right to serve pilgrims whose ancestral  
homes are in a particular place, whether  
or not the pilgrims still reside there. For  
example, a family from the Marwar  
region of the state of **Rajasthan** will  
always be served by the **Marwari** panda,  
even if the family has not lived in  
Marwar for generations. Pilgrims make  
an entry in their panda’s pilgrim register  
during each visit, in which they write  
down the date, the names of those who  
visited, and the reason or reasons for  
which they have come. These details are  
noted on a thick sheet of paper about  
ten inches wide and three feet long, and  
there may be multiple entries on a page.  
One of the page’s narrow sides has holes  
punched in it, and a string can be  
threaded through these holes to tie a  
number of such sheets together. This  
allows the panda to compile registers for  
a particular village or specific family,  
and when not in use these bahis are  
rolled into a circle and tied.  
These registers provide not only a  
record of pilgrim visits, but are also the  
unassailable evidence of the hereditary  
connection between a panda and a pilgrim family. Most pilgrims will demand  
to see the entries for their ancestors as

Bahi  
proof that a particular priest is their  
hereditary panda. This usually happens  
when many years have elapsed between  
visits, and the pilgrims may never have  
met their panda in person. A panda’s  
bahis are thus the sole proof of his rights  
to a particular pilgrim group, which  
makes these registers extremely valuable documents. Most pandas zealously  
safeguard their bahis, since anyone with  
a copy can claim the pilgrims therein.  
The bahis’ importance also gives them a  
high market value. They may be used as  
collateral to gain a loan and can even be  
sold outright. This latter course is  
extremely unusual, since for working  
pandas their bahis are not only the  
source of their livelihood, but also their  
family **inheritance**.
