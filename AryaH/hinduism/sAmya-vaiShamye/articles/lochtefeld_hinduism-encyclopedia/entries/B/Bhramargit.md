+++
(“songs to the bee”) Poetic genre in the  
devotional poetry of the god **Krishna**,  
which is set in the time after Krishna has  
gone to claim his kingdom in **Mathura**,  
never to return. The story tells how  
Krishna sends his companion **Uddhava**  
back to **Braj** with a message for the  
**gopis**, the cowherd **women** who are  
Krishna’s dear companions, and who are  
virtually insane with longing because of  
his absence. Uddhava tries to reassure  
the gopis by telling them not to dwell on  
Krishna’s physical absence. Uddhava  
further reminds them that since Krishna  
is the all-pervading divinity, he will  
always be with them even though he  
might not be visible. In the bhramargit  
poems, the gopis scornfully reject  
Uddhava’s notions, asserting that this  
view of Krishna is abstract, lifeless, and  
suitable only for those who have never  
known Krishna in his embodied form.  
The genre’s name comes from this  
story’s earliest appearance, in the  
**Bhagavata Purana**. Here the gopis  
address their complaints about  
Krishna’s absence to a large black bee,  
which in their passion and loneliness  
they mistake for Krishna.
