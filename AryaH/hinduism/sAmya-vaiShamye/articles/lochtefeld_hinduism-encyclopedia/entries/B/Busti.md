(“settlement”) In its literal meaning, anywhere people live—a settlement, village,  
or community. In modern usage it has  
come to denote an illegal settlement,  
such as one built by squatters who have  
put up dwellings on vacant land using  
whatever materials are available, from  
brick to cardboard to plastic. At first, such  
settlements have no civic amenities such  
as **water**, power, roads, or sewers, and in  
most cases the living conditions are  
abysmal. In many cases such “slums”  
become people’s hereditary homes, particularly in Bombay, where real estate is  
exorbitantly expensive. These residents  
have usually gained access to electricity  
and water, typically via illegal hookups.  
In rarer cases squatters have gained title  
to the land through exerting political  
pressure, after which conditions have  
generally improved.
