(“aperture of **Brahman**”) In traditional  
mystical physiology, an opening in the  
crown of the head—perhaps corresponding to the fontanel in young children. Although this hole usually closes  
up, it is widely believed that if at the time  
of death the departing soul can be channeled through this aperture, it will bring  
final liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
The earliest mention of this idea can be  
found in **Katha Upanishad** 6.16, and  
exercises to facilitate this practice are  
stressed in certain varieties of **yoga**. The  
desire to open this aperture is the reason  
behind one of the actions sometimes  
performed during **cremation**. In many  
cases the pyre’s heat will itself split the  
skull, but when it does not, a long pole is  
used to break it open in an effort to  
release the soul.
