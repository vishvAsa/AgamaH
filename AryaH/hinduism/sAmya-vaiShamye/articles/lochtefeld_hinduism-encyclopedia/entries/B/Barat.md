title = "Barat"

+++
One of the common elements in a  
modern northern Indian **marriage**  
**ceremony**, in which the groom is  
brought in a procession to the wedding site, escorted by his (mostly  
male) relatives and friends. The barat  
evokes the symbolism of a royal procession in which the groom is the king,  
at least for the day. The groom most  
commonly rides a gaily decorated  
white mare, although any means of  
transportation representing his  
importance is acceptable—from an  
**elephant** to a horse-drawn carriage to  
an automobile strung with garlands.  
In keeping with the royal imagery, the  
groom often wears a crown or ornaments made of tinsel. The entire procession is usually accompanied by a  
marching band, in the role of the heralds who march before the royal presence; the band will often stop along  
the way to play, at which time the participants will **dance** around them.  
Although the groom usually remains  
reserved throughout the barat—in  
keeping with the gravity of the occasion—for the rest of his companions, it  
is a time for joking, laughing, dancing,  
and celebration immediately before  
the wedding. The barat may also  
involve the consumption of **liquor**,  
although many more conservative  
Hindus frown upon this element.
