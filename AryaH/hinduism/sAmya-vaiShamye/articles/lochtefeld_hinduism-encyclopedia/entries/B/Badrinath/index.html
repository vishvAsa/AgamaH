the Himalayan area of Chamoli district
in the state of Uttar Pradesh, near the
headwaters of the Alakananda River,
the largest tributary of the Ganges.
Badrinath is high in the mountains at an
altitude of over 10,000 feet. It is connected
to Tibet by the Mana Pass, one of the traditional land routes by which Chinese
goods have come into India. Badrinath’s
high altitude also means that it is only

Badrinath
Temple to the god Vishnu in the Himalayan town of Badrinath.
Parts of the temple’s architecture suggest that it may have originally been a Buddhist temple.
October, after which it is closed for the
winter months; this pattern is echoed at
Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath,
the three major Himalayan pilgrimage
sites. The town’s name comes from its
presiding deity, Vishnu, whose temple
is the reason for the site’s existence. The
main image in the temple is claimed to
have miraculously emerged full-formed
from a shalagram, a particular type of
black stone containing fossilized
ammonite, which is itself considered a
“self-manifested” form of Vishnu.
Badrinath has a long history as a venerable sacred site. Scholars believe that
it was occupied by a Buddhist temple
until several centuries into the present
millennium, based on the architecture
of some of the temple’s older parts. Local
tradition reports that until the middle of
the twentieth century when the Chinese
sealed the Tibetan border, Buddhists
came from Tibet for the temple’s closing
rites in the fall, bringing a hand-woven
blanket to drape around the image. In
Hinduism, Badrinath is one of the four
dhams (“divine abodes”) connected
with the philosopher Shankaracharya.
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one
Hindu sacred center in each corner of
the subcontinent to combat the spread
of Buddhism and revitalize Hindu religion. At each center he established a
Dashanami Sanyasi monastic center
(math) to train learned monks.
Badrinath is associated with the sacred
center Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath, forty miles south.
Each winter, the image at Badrinath is
symbolically transported to the
Narasimha temple in Joshimath.
According to Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years temple worship was performed by the
Dandi Sanyasis; they were a group of
ascetics devoted to the god Shiva who
were also Nambudiri brahmins, the
same caste into which Shankaracharya
is supposed to have been born. When
the last of these ascetics died without a
successor in 1776, the local king who
served as the protector of the shrine
invited a non-ascetic Nambudiri brahmin
to serve as the temple’s priest. In deference to his ascetic predecessors, this
priest was given the title rawal
(“deputy”), and his extended family has
run the shrine since then. The rawal is
the only person allowed to touch the
image, and as a consequence he is
required to remain a bachelor, lest the
ritual impurity (ashaucha) arising from
the birth of a child (sutakashaucha)
render him unable to attend to his
duties. For a long time, the rawals had
sole rights to the offerings given at the
shrine, but since 1939 the temple has
been managed by a committee, and the
rawal has been restricted to ritual duties.">

  <p>(“Lord of Badri”) Sacred site (<strong>tirtha</strong>) in<br>
the Himalayan area of Chamoli district<br>
in the state of <strong>Uttar Pradesh</strong>, near the<br>
headwaters of the <strong>Alakananda River</strong>,<br>
the largest tributary of the <strong>Ganges</strong>.<br>
Badrinath is high in the mountains at an<br>
altitude of over 10,000 feet. It is connected<br>
to Tibet by the Mana Pass, one of the traditional land routes by which Chinese<br>
goods have come into India. Badrinath’s<br>
high altitude also means that it is only<br>
accessible between late April and<br>
77<br>
Badrinath<br>
Temple to the god Vishnu in the Himalayan town of Badrinath.<br>
Parts of the temple’s architecture suggest that it may have originally been a Buddhist temple.<br>
October, after which it is closed for the<br>
winter months; this pattern is echoed at<br>
<strong>Yamunotri</strong>, <strong>Gangotri</strong>, and <strong>Kedarnath</strong>,<br>
the three major Himalayan pilgrimage<br>
sites. The town’s name comes from its<br>
presiding <strong>deity</strong>, <strong>Vishnu</strong>, whose temple<br>
is the reason for the site’s existence. The<br>
main image in the temple is claimed to<br>
have miraculously emerged full-formed<br>
from a <strong>shalagram</strong>, a particular type of<br>
black stone containing fossilized<br>
<strong>ammonite</strong>, which is itself considered a<br>
“self-manifested” form of Vishnu.<br>
Badrinath has a long history as a venerable sacred site. Scholars believe that<br>
it was occupied by a Buddhist temple<br>
until several centuries into the present<br>
millennium, based on the <strong>architecture</strong><br>
of some of the temple’s older parts. Local<br>
tradition reports that until the middle of<br>
the twentieth century when the Chinese<br>
sealed the Tibetan border, Buddhists<br>
came from Tibet for the temple’s closing<br>
rites in the fall, bringing a hand-woven<br>
blanket to drape around the image. In<br>
Hinduism, Badrinath is one of the <strong>four</strong><br>
<strong>dhams</strong> (“divine abodes”) connected<br>
with the philosopher <strong>Shankaracharya</strong>.<br>
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one<br>
Hindu sacred center in each corner of<br>
the subcontinent to combat the spread<br>
of Buddhism and revitalize Hindu religion. At each center he established a<br>
<strong>Dashanami Sanyasi</strong> monastic center<br>
(<strong>math</strong>) to train learned monks.<br>
Badrinath is associated with the sacred<br>
center <strong>Jyotir Math</strong> in the Himalayan<br>
town of <strong>Joshimath</strong>, forty miles south.<br>
Each winter, the image at Badrinath is<br>
symbolically transported to the<br>
Narasimha temple in Joshimath.<br>
According to Badrinath temple<br>
records, for several hundred years temple <strong>worship</strong> was performed by the<br>
<strong>Dandi Sanyasis</strong>; they were a group of<br>
<strong>ascetics</strong> devoted to the god <strong>Shiva</strong> who<br>
were also <strong>Nambudiri brahmins</strong>, the<br>
same <strong>caste</strong> into which Shankaracharya<br>
is supposed to have been born. When<br>
the last of these ascetics died without a<br>
successor in 1776, the local king who<br>
served as the protector of the shrine<br>
invited a non-ascetic Nambudiri brahmin<br>
to serve as the temple’s priest. In deference to his ascetic predecessors, this<br>
priest was given the title <strong>rawal</strong><br>
(“deputy”), and his extended family has<br>
run the shrine since then. The rawal is<br>
the only person allowed to touch the<br>
image, and as a consequence he is<br>
required to remain a bachelor, lest the<br>
ritual impurity (<strong>ashaucha</strong>) arising from<br>
the <strong>birth</strong> of a child (<strong>sutakashaucha</strong>)<br>
render him unable to attend to his<br>
duties. For a long time, the rawals had<br>
sole rights to the <strong>offerings</strong> given at the<br>
shrine, but since 1939 the temple has<br>
been managed by a committee, and the<br>
rawal has been restricted to ritual duties.</p>
