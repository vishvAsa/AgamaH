title = "Bengali"

+++
Modern Indian language in the IndoEuropean language family, spoken in  
the region of modern Bengal, for which  
it is named. Like many of India’s regional tongues, Bengali has a long history as  
a literary language in its own right. In  
the nineteenth century, Calcutta was the  
most important cultural center in India  
as well as a hotbed of resistance to  
British rule. As the vernacular tongue,  
Bengali was used in that era’s revolutionary politics, particularly by **Bankim**  
**Chandra Chatterjee** and **Aurobindo**  
**Ghose**; it was also the language used by  
religious figures such as **Ramprasad**  
and **Ramakrishna**.
