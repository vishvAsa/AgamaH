(“Lord of Badri”) Sacred site (**tirtha**) in  
the Himalayan area of Chamoli district  
in the state of **Uttar Pradesh**, near the  
headwaters of the **Alakananda River**,  
the largest tributary of the **Ganges**.  
Badrinath is high in the mountains at an  
altitude of over 10,000 feet. It is connected  
to Tibet by the Mana Pass, one of the traditional land routes by which Chinese  
goods have come into India. Badrinath’s  
high altitude also means that it is only  
accessible between late April and

Badrinath  
Temple to the god Vishnu in the Himalayan town of Badrinath.  
Parts of the temple’s architecture suggest that it may have originally been a Buddhist temple.  
October, after which it is closed for the  
winter months; this pattern is echoed at  
**Yamunotri**, **Gangotri**, and **Kedarnath**,  
the three major Himalayan pilgrimage  
sites. The town’s name comes from its  
presiding **deity**, **Vishnu**, whose temple  
is the reason for the site’s existence. The  
main image in the temple is claimed to  
have miraculously emerged full-formed  
from a **shalagram**, a particular type of  
black stone containing fossilized  
**ammonite**, which is itself considered a  
“self-manifested” form of Vishnu.  
Badrinath has a long history as a venerable sacred site. Scholars believe that  
it was occupied by a Buddhist temple  
until several centuries into the present  
millennium, based on the **architecture**  
of some of the temple’s older parts. Local  
tradition reports that until the middle of  
the twentieth century when the Chinese  
sealed the Tibetan border, Buddhists  
came from Tibet for the temple’s closing  
rites in the fall, bringing a hand-woven  
blanket to drape around the image. In  
Hinduism, Badrinath is one of the **four**  
**dhams** (“divine abodes”) connected  
with the philosopher **Shankaracharya**.  
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one  
Hindu sacred center in each corner of  
the subcontinent to combat the spread  
of Buddhism and revitalize Hindu religion. At each center he established a  
**Dashanami Sanyasi** monastic center  
(**math**) to train learned monks.  
Badrinath is associated with the sacred  
center **Jyotir Math** in the Himalayan  
town of **Joshimath**, forty miles south.  
Each winter, the image at Badrinath is  
symbolically transported to the  
Narasimha temple in Joshimath.  
According to Badrinath temple  
records, for several hundred years temple **worship** was performed by the  
**Dandi Sanyasis**; they were a group of  
**ascetics** devoted to the god **Shiva** who  
were also **Nambudiri brahmins**, the  
same **caste** into which Shankaracharya  
is supposed to have been born. When  
the last of these ascetics died without a  
successor in 1776, the local king who  
served as the protector of the shrine  
invited a non-ascetic Nambudiri brahmin  
to serve as the temple’s priest. In deference to his ascetic predecessors, this  
priest was given the title **rawal**  
(“deputy”), and his extended family has  
run the shrine since then. The rawal is  
the only person allowed to touch the  
image, and as a consequence he is  
required to remain a bachelor, lest the  
ritual impurity (**ashaucha**) arising from  
the **birth** of a child (**sutakashaucha**)  
render him unable to attend to his  
duties. For a long time, the rawals had  
sole rights to the **offerings** given at the  
shrine, but since 1939 the temple has  
been managed by a committee, and the  
rawal has been restricted to ritual duties.
