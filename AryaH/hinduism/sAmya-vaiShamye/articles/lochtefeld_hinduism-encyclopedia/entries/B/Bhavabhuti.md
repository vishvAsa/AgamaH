title = "Bhavabhuti"

+++
(early 8th c. C.E.) **Sanskrit** dramatist and  
playwright noted for his ability to  
express and transmit emotions through  
language. His best-known play, the  
romance **Malatimadhava**, is famous  
not only in its own right, but because the  
primary villain is an evil **ascetic** believed  
to be a member of the defunct ascetic  
group known as **Kapalikas**. The  
Kapalikas were devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**, and their reputed practices emulated Shiva in his wrathful form as  
**Bhairava**. They wore their hair long and  
matted, smeared their bodies with ash  
(preferably from the **cremation**  
**ground**), and carried a club and a skull  
bowl (**kapala**). According to some  
sources, they also indulged in forbidden  
behavior—drinking wine, **eating** meat,  
using cannabis and other **drugs**, performing **human sacrifice**, and orgiastic  
sexuality—which caused them to be  
avoided and feared. Bhavabhuti’s  
description of this evil ascetic and his  
disciples is one of the earliest datable  
references to the **Shaiva** form of **asceticism**, and therefore important from a  
historical perspective.
