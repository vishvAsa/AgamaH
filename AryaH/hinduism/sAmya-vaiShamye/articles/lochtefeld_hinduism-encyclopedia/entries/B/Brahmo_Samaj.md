The earliest of the Hindu reform groups,  
founded in Calcutta in the early nineteenth century by **Ram Mohan Roy**  
(1774–1833). His purpose was to purge  
contemporary Hinduism of its “corrupt”  
practices, such as **sati** (**widow** burning),  
the ban on widow remarriage, image  
**worship**, and **caste**. In his effort to find a  
traditional authority for such reforms,  
he chose the **Upanishads** as his key religious texts. After his death the movement was eventually headed by  
Debendranath Tagore (father of the  
Nobel laureate **Rabindranath Tagore**)  
and later by **Keshub Chander Sen**; disagreements over ritual matters split the  
movement under both leaders. By the  
late 1800s the Samaj’s influence had  
largely passed, although in an interesting twist, it became the vehicle through  
which the mystic **Ramakrishna** met  
many of his disciples.  
The Brahmo Samaj’s social program  
reflected and responded to contemporary European critiques of popular  
Hinduism, some levied by Christian  
125  
Brahmo Samaj  
missionaries and others based on  
the rationalist emphasis of the  
Enlightenment. The Brahmo Samaj’s  
openness put it at the forefront of legal  
reform—in particular, influencing the  
1829 law banning sati. But at the same  
time, its members were mostly  
Westernized urban intellectuals, far  
removed from the life and religious  
concerns of Hindus. For further

Brahmo Samaj: India’s First Movement  
for Religious Reform,” in Robert D. Baird
