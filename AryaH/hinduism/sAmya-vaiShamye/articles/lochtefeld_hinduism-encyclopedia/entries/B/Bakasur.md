title = "Bakasur"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Bakasur is a ferocious man-eating **demon**. To preserve  
their lives, the local villagers send  
Bakasur a daily sacrificial victim who  
is chosen by lot, along with a wagonload of food that the demon also  
eats. One day the lot falls to the **brahmin** who is hosting the **Pandavas**, the  
five heroic brothers who are the epic’s  
protagonists. When the brothers’  
common wife, **Draupadi**, discovers  
what has happened, she asks one of  
the brothers, **Bhima**, to deliver the  
food in the brahmin’s place. Bhima  
drives the wagon to the cave, goads  
the demon into battle by eating the  
food in front of him, and then slays  
Bakasur with one mighty blow.
