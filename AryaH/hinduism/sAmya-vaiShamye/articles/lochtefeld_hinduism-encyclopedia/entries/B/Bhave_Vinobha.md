(1895–1982) Social and religious  
reformer whose basic principles reflected  
his long association with **Mohandas K.**  
**Gandhi**, to whom Bhave came as a disciple in 1916. Bhave was one of Gandhi’s  
close associates in the struggle for independence and was particularly  
absorbed with Gandhi’s idea of village  
self-sufficiency. In the years after independence, he traveled around India on  
foot to meet the people. It was on one  
108  
Bhasmasur  
such tour that he started the Bhoodan  
(“land gift”) movement, the purpose of  
which was to obtain donations of land  
for the poor. Much of Bhave’s life after  
independence was devoted to village  
development, in particular through a  
movement called Sarvodaya (“welfare of  
all”), which sought to solve problems  
through collective involvement and service to one another.
