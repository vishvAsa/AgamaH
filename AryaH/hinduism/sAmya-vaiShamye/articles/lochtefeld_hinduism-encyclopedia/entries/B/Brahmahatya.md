(“**brahmin** murder”) In the **dharma literature**, which gives instruction on religious duties, brahmahatya is one of the  
120  
Brahmacharin  
**four great crimes** that makes one an  
outcast from society. This crime’s seriousness stems from notions of brahmin  
sanctity and status; with the exception  
of self-defense, the deliberate murder of  
a brahmin holds serious repercussions.  
Even the gods are subject to this act’s  
negative karmic consequences. Hindu  
mythology records that the god  
**Bhairava** wanders the **earth** for years  
after cutting off one of the heads of the  
god **Brahma**. The skull sticks to his  
hand as a visible sign of his crime until it  
finally falls off at **Kapalamochana**. In  
the more lenient prescriptions in the  
dharma literature, the punishment for a  
brahmin murderer is parallel to that of  
Bhairava. The murderer has to carry the  
skull of the dead man for twelve years,  
wearing only a rough garment to cover  
his loins, and during that period he has  
to live on alms, **begging** at no more  
than seven houses per **day**. After twelve  
years he is deemed pure, unless the  
murder was intentional, in which case  
the term of punishment is doubled.  
According to several commentators,  
however, when a brahmin is intentionally murdered by a **kshatriya**, **vaishya**,  
or **shudra**, the only possible expiation  
(**prayashchitta**) is death.
