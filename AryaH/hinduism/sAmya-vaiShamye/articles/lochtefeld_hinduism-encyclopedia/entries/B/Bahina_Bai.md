title = "Bahina Bai"

+++
(1628–1700) Poet and saint in the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba** at his temple at  
**Pandharpur** in the modern state of  
**Maharashtra**. Bahina Bai ran counter to  
contemporary assumptions not only  
because she was a female religious figure, but also because she was a **brahmin**  
disciple of the **shudra** poet-saint  
**Tukaram**, an association that inverted  
the usual patterns of social status. This is  
because a brahmin is someone of high  
social standing while a shudra is of the  
lowest and least influential class in  
Hindu society. According to tradition,  
Tukaram initiated Bahina as his disciple  
in a **dream** because Bahina’s husband—  
a learned brahmin who was highly conscious of brahmin status—had  
forbidden her to meet with him. Aside  
from her devotional poetry, Bahina also  
wrote an autobiography, whose content  
was heavily influenced by her religious  
beliefs. Bahina is notable as one of the  
only **women bhakti** (devotional) figures  
who was able to reconcile the demands  
of her marriage with her commitment to  
God, although these issues were not  
resolved without considerable trouble  
and heartache. For further information

Wife and Saint,” in *Journal of the American*
