title = "Brahmacharya"

(“going after **Brahman**”) In its most traditional sense, this word refers to the  
lifestyle of a young man belonging to a  
particular class during his life as a student (**brahmacharin**). This period is the  
first of the four ashramas (“**stages of**  
**life**”) of a **twice-born** man, that is, a  
man born into one of three groups in  
Indian society: **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or  
**vaishya**. Such men are eligible to  
receive the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the “second birth.” His  
life as a student will then commence,  
and he will move into his **guru’s** household and study the sacred texts, the  
**Vedas**. This is conceived as a period of  
intense study, religious practice, and an  
austere lifestyle marked by the restraint  
of desires, for which the hallmark is  
**celibacy**. Although the model of the  
four ashramas is largely archaic in modern times, the word *brahmacharya* still  
connotes this sort of austere religious  
lifestyle, and it is often used as a synonym for celibacy.
