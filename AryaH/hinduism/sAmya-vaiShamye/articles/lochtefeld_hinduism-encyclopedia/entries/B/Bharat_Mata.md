title = "Bharat Mata"

+++
(“Mother India”) Modern Hindu “**deity**”  
whose primary image is a map of the  
subcontinent, often prominently  
marked with the network of India’s  
sacred sites (**tirthas**). The presupposition behind most of these particular  
sacred sites is that the land itself is holy,  
but the idea of Bharat Mata takes this  
idea to a more abstract level, sanctifying  
the whole subcontinent. Although this  
map and its image of Mother India are  
usually not actual objects of **worship**,  
they carry important symbolic messages. In an abstract way, the holiness of  
Mother India unites all Hindus regardless of their sectarian affiliation.  
Moreover, it suggests that India is one  
unified culture despite its striking  
regional diversity. These ideas can be  
found in specific areas, particularly in  
the networks of tirthas knitting the  
country together, yet in contemporary  
times this image’s underlying purpose is  
often political rather than religious.  
At times it simply represents  
national pride, but at other times it has  
a more sinister hidden agenda. This  
identification of Indian culture with the  
motherland can be used as a way to  
marginalize religious **minorities**—primarily Muslims and Christians, whose  
holy places lie in other countries—as  
“foreigners,” and people whose patriotism and connection to the Indian  
nation are potentially suspect.
