title = "Bali"

+++
(3) Island in Indonesia that has the last  
surviving remnant of the HinduBuddhist culture that pervaded the  
region after the early centuries of the  
common era. Indian beliefs were first  
brought by traders and merchants, and  
**inscriptions** reveal that the Balinese  
kings patronized a variety of sects, both  
Hindu and Buddhist. In time, Indian  
sacred geography was transferred and  
transposed to Bali, native **deities** were  
gradually assimilated into the pantheon,  
and all the competing sects finally were  
fused into the new entity known as  
Balinese religion.
