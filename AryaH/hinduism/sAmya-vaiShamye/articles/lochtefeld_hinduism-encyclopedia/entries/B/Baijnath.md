Sacred site (**tirtha**) and archeological  
area in the Himalayan foothills of the  
state of **Uttar Pradesh**, about forty-  
80  
Baiga  
A baiga, or healer, uses spiritual techniques to remedy a person’s physical or emotional troubles.  
five miles north and west of the town of  
Almora. Baijnath contains a temple  
complex believed to date from the thirteenth century C.E. Many of the temples  
are quite well-preserved, although only  
one is still used as a place of **worship**.  
Although the name of the site is a vernacular form of **Vaidyanath**, a form of  
the god **Shiva**, the presiding **deity** in the  
temple is Shiva’s wife **Parvati**. Her main  
image is over four feet tall and is a magnificent work of art, carved from a piece  
of rose-colored granite. Smaller figures  
carved into the image itself illustrate the  
mythic story of Shiva’s wife **Sati**, her  
rebirth as Parvati, and Parvati’s remarriage to Shiva. The statue is clearly the  
work of a master sculptor, and it far  
exceeds the quality of the artwork one  
normally finds in such isolated places.  
Another temple in a nearby village has a  
statue of **Vishnu** made from a similar  
type of stone and carved in a similar  
style. The simplest explanation for this  
correspondence is that a single  
sculptor was commissioned to create  
both images.
