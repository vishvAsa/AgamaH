title = "Babri Masjid"

+++
(“Babar’s Mosque”) Mosque built in  
1528 on the outskirts of the city of  
**Ayodhya**, which was constructed at the  
order of Mir Baqi, a general of the  
Moghul emperor Babar (1483–1530).  
The site has long been a source of controversy between the Hindu and Muslim  
communities, and British sources  
recorded conflicts there in 1855 and  
\1934. Local tradition holds that the  
mosque was built on the birthplace of  
the Hindu **deity Rama**, and that it was  
constructed only after demolishing the  
Hindu temple there, although there is  
little hard evidence for the latter claim. A  
few months after India gained independence in 1947, several local Hindus surreptitiously installed images of the child  
Rama, his wife **Sita**, and his brother  
**Lakshmana**; they spread the tale that  
the images had miraculously appeared  
in a ball of light. The government had  
only recently quieted the Hindu-Muslim  
massacres that accompanied the division of British India into India and  
Pakistan, and it was reluctant to reinflame religious passions. Its solution was  
to padlock the compound’s gates and  
send the case to the courts for resolution, where it languished for almost  
forty years.  
The early 1980s saw renewed controversy over the site, when the Hindu religious organization **Vishva Hindu**  
**Parishad** (VHP) first began calling for its  
“liberation” and proclaiming that the  
existing structure was an insult to all  
Hindus. This campaign portrayed the  
mosque as a symbol of Muslim iconoclasm. Moreover, it depicted government efforts to protect the mosque as an  
attempt to appease the Muslim community and retain their votes. In 1986 the  
VHP’s drive to liberate the site was aided  
by the national government headed by  
Rajiv Gandhi, which in a patent attempt  
to claim Hindu support, unlocked the  
compound’s gates so that Hindus could  
**worship** on the site.  
The pressure intensified as the  
decade progressed, culminating in a  
series of campaigns to begin constructing a Hindu temple on the site. Many of  
these campaigns coincided with national  
elections, and the emotion they generated helped benefit the electoral fortunes  
of the **Bharatiya Janata Party**, a political  
party with close ties to the VHP.  
Eventually, on December 6, 1992, the  
mosque was demolished. The whole  
operation was carefully planned; the  
demolition teams were highly trained,  
and the first thing they did was to  
destroy all the television cameras there  
to prevent any media coverage by outsiders. It was carried out with the blessing of the state government, which  
made no attempt to protect the building. The demolition was followed by  
riots, particularly in the state of  
**Maharashtra**, in which over three  
thousand people were killed, most of  
them Muslims.  
Even after the destruction of the  
Babri Masjid, the site remained a bone  
of contention. Immediately following  
the demolition, Prime Minister P. V.  
Narasimha Rao promised to rebuild the  
mosque on the same spot, but he did  
nothing to accomplish this during his  
time in office. Various Hindu groups,  
76  
Baba  
including traditional religious leaders  
such as the **Shankaracharyas**, have  
been calling for the construction of the  
**Ram Janam Bhumi** temple at the site.  
Anticipating nothing but trouble ahead,  
the government again has sent the matter to the courts for resolution, where it  
remains to this day and may remain for  
four more decades. For further information see Sarvepalli Gopal, *Anatomy of a*
