This was the identity assumed by  
**Arjuna**, one of the five **Pandava** princes,  
during the year they lived incognito  
after twelve years of forest exile. The  
Pandavas are the heroes of the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics, which details the struggle  
for power between the Pandavas and  
their cousins the **Kauravas**. At one point  
in their struggle, Arjuna’s older brother,  
**Yudhishthira**, has lost all the brothers’  
freedom and **possessions** to the Kauravas  
in a game of dice. As a penalty for this  
loss, the Pandavas have to go into exile  
for twelve years and spend the thirteenth  
year back in society, unrecognized. It is  
understood that if the brothers are discovered during that year, they will be  
banished again. Arjuna, the epic’s most  
heroic warrior, disguises himself as a  
eunuch named Brhannala, knowing that  
no one will suspect him in such guise. He  
spends the year living in the women’s  
quarters of the palace, singing and dancing as a eunuch. At the end of the year,  
still in his eunuch’s garb, Arjuna takes  
part in a great battle in which he defeats  
the troops of the Kauravas.
