(“inventory”) One of the three main collections of verse ascribed to the poetsaint **Kabir** (mid-15th c.?); the other two  
are found in the **Adigranth** and the  
manuscripts of the religious organization **Dadupanth**. Kabir is the best  
known of the **sants**, an umbrella term  
for a group of central and northern  
Indian poet-saints who share several  
concepts: stress on individualized, interior religion leading to a personal experience of the divine; disdain for external  
ritual, particularly image **worship**; faith  
in the power of the divine Name; and a  
tendency to ignore conventional **caste**  
distinctions. Of all the sants, Kabir is the  
most iconoclastic with regard to established religious practices and authorities. He invariably emphasizes the need  
for individual searching and realization.  
Given the content of Kabir’s message,  
it is notable that the *Bijak* is the scripture of the **Kabirpanth**, a religious community claiming to be his followers.  
Certainly Kabir himself would have condemned the notion of making him the  
founder of anything, or of his verses  
gaining the authority of a scripture. In  
content, the *Bijak* contains verses of  
varying types: short epigrams that have  
become proverbial wisdom, longer stanzas in the **chaupai** form, and shorter  
two-line verse (**doha**). Linguistic features identify the *Bijak* as belonging to  
the eastern part of the **Hindi** language  
region, hence its common name as the  
“eastern” recension. For translations of  
the text itself, see Linda Hess and  
Shukdev Singh (trans.), *The Bijak of*  
*Kabir*, 1983.
