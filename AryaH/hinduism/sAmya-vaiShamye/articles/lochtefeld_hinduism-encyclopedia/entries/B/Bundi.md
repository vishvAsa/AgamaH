title = "Bundi"

+++
City and district in the southeastern part  
of the state **Rajasthan**, about 100 miles  
south of the state capital, Jaipur. Before  
1947, when India gained independence,  
Bundi was a small kingdom. In the late  
seventeenth century, Bundi became a  
center for the **Rajasthani** style of **miniature painting**, perhaps by attracting  
artists from the Moghul court who were  
seeking outside patronage. Aside from  
the portraits and court groups characterizing this genre under the Moghuls,  
Rajasthani miniature painters portrayed  
Hindu religious themes, particularly incidents in the life of the god **Krishna**.  
Whereas some styles have flat, monochromatic backgrounds, the Bundi style  
shows an intense focus on nature, such  
as detailed depiction of the trees (usually  
banana trees) surrounding the subjects,  
in addition to flowers, birds, and lotusfilled ponds. For further information see  
W. G. Archer, *Indian Painting*, 1957; or his  
*Indian Painting in Bundi and Kotah*,  
\1959. See also **Moghul dynasty**.
