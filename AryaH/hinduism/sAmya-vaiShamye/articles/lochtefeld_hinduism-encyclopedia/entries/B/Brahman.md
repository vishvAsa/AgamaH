title = "Brahman"

In its first appearances in the **Rg Veda**,  
the earliest text in the sacred literature  
known as the **Vedas**, the term *Brahman*  
both denotes the power inherent in, and  
gives potency to, the sacred word. In the  
**Brahmana** literature, one of the later  
strands in the Vedas, *brahman* was the  
name for one of the four types of priests  
who officiated at a **sacrifice** (the others  
being **hotr**, **udgatr**, and **adhvaryum**). In  
the **Upanishads** and afterward,  
*Brahman* is the generally accepted term  
for the highest reality in the universe,  
which is both the material cause and the  
final cause of all that exists. In the worldview of the Upanishads, the speculative  
and most recent texts in the Vedas,  
Brahman is the single binding unity  
behind the world’s apparent diversity.  
These texts also affirm Brahman’s identity with **atman**, the individual soul, and  
thus the identity of the essence of  
macrocosm and microcosm. As  
described in many of the Upanishads  
and later systematized by the philosopher **Shankaracharya** (9th c.), the ultimate form of Brahman is without  
qualities (**nirguna**), formless, nameless,  
indefinable, and grammatically a neuter

Brahma Muhurta  
After death, a liberated person’s soul is believed to escape through an opening in the skull  
called the brahmarandhra. This is thought to correspond to the fontanel,  
an opening in an infant’s skull (right) that closes in adulthood (left).  
noun. In contrast, particular **deities** are  
seen as lower, provisional, qualified  
(**saguna**) forms of Brahman. This understanding was modified by the influence  
of later devotional trends, in which ideas  
of the highest Brahman became identified with a particular deity, who was  
seen as the ultimate source of all things.
