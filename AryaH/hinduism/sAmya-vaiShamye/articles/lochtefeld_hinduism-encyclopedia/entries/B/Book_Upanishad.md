title = "Book”) Upanishad"

+++
By general consensus, the oldest of the  
**Upanishads**, the speculative religious  
texts that form the most recent stratum  
of the **Vedas**. The Brhadaranyaka  
Upanishad’s chronological priority is  
supported by at least four pieces of evidence: its length, its lack of organization, its archaic language, and its  
relationship to earlier Vedic texts. The  
opening passage gives an extended  
comparison between the world and the  
sacrificial horse, showing clear parallels  
with the earlier **Brahmana** literature.  
Moreover, by its very name (“great forest  
book”), the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad  
clearly points to a transition from the  
**Aranyaka** (“forest books”) literature,  
which followed Brahmana literature.  
This upanishad first addresses many of  
the questions raised in later texts and is  
therefore an important source for the  
development of the tradition. Unlike  
most of the later Upanishads, it is written in prose rather than poetry, with the  
instruction often in the form of dialogue  
between various speakers.
