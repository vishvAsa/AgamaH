(ca. 400–200 B.C.E.) Philosopher traditionally cited as the author of the  
**Vedanta Sutras**. This collection of 555  
brief **sutras**, or aphorisms, is the basis of  
the philosophical school known as  
**Vedanta**, so named because it claims to  
reveal the ultimate meaning of the religious scriptures known as the **Vedas**.  
The sutras attempt to summarize and  
systematize the philosophic and religious ideas in the **Upanishads**, the speculative texts that form the latest stratum  
in the Veda. Because the Vedanta Sutras  
are particularly concerned with the  
ideas about the Supreme Reality known  
as **Brahman**, they are also called the  
**Brahma Sutras**. The brevity of the individual sutras—many are only a few  
words—presupposes commentary,  
which was later provided by various  
writers. Badarayana himself considered  
the Upanishads the ultimate source for  
his teachings, although his text was  
judged equally authoritative by later  
Vedanta writers.
