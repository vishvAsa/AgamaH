In traditional Hindu culture, banking  
was often an extension of a merchant  
family’s economic life, particularly in  
times and places in which centralized  
banking did not exist. In most cases  
these families transacted their business  
using letters of credit known as **hundis**,  
which enabled them to conduct business over large distances without the  
risk of transporting gold and silver bullion. By the early 1800s, these hundis  
functioned as virtual currency in much  
of India, since in some cases they were  
used in twenty or thirty transactions  
before eventually being returned to the  
issuing family for cashing. This system  
made a merchant family’s creditworthiness its most valuable asset. Once this  
was lost, the family’s hundis were no  
longer honored, and they were unable to  
conduct business. Since the evaluation  
of a family’s credit was often tied to  
judgments about its character, merchant families strove to cultivate the  
image of seriousness, dependability,  
and thrift. In this ethos the only acceptable forum for lavish expenditures was  
for religious endowments, since these  
reinforced the family’s pious image and  
thus enhanced their creditworthiness.  
With part of their surplus capital, these  
families would usually engage in  
**moneylending** as one way to increase  
their wealth; the largest families  
routinely lent money to royalty, which  
provided them with even greater status.

family ethos in northern India, see
