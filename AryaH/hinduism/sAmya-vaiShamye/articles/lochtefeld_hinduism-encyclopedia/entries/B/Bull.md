title = "Bull"

Although the **cow** is the Hindu symbol  
for motherhood, with all of the  
emotional baggage that accompanies it,  
the associations connected with bulls are  
not nearly so important. In a religious  
context, the bull is associated with the  
god **Shiva** because his animal vehicle is  
the bull **Nandi**, who can invariably be  
found guarding the door at Shivaâ€™s  
temples. In pre-modern times, of course,  
adult bulls were a relatively small  
percentage of the total cattle population,  
since most young bulls were routinely  
castrated to become the oxen that were  
essential agricultural work **animals**.
