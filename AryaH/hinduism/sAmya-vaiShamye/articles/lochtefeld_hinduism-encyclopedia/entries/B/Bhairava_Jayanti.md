title = "Bhairava Jayanti"

+++
Annual festival on the eighth **day** of  
the dark, or waning, half of the  
**lunar month** of **Margashirsha**  
(November–December), which is celebrated as the birthday of **Bhairava**.  
Bhairava is a wrathful and powerful form  
of the god **Shiva** and is actually the god’s  
anger personified. He emerges from  
Shiva’s forehead after Shiva has been  
insulted by the god **Brahma**, and  
Bhairava’s first act is to cut off the head of  
Brahma that has uttered the insult, leaving the god with four heads. Bhairava’s  
wrath gives him an aura of danger but  
also the power to help his devotees  
(**bhakta**), who **worship** him to attain  
success, remove obstacles, and recover  
from disease. On this festival people  
worship Bhairava, Shiva, and Shiva’s  
wife, **Parvati**, as well as Bhairava’s **animal** vehicle, the **dog**. People are encouraged to worship through the night and to  
pass this time by telling mythic stories of  
Bhairava, Shiva, and Parvati.
