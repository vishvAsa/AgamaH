title = "Bhasmasur"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a **demon** with great  
power but limited intelligence.  
According to tradition, the god **Shiva**  
has given Bhasmasur the power to  
change anyone to ash (bhasma) simply  
by placing his hand on that person’s  
head. Bhasmasur falls in love with  
Shiva’s wife **Parvati** and attempts to  
place his hand on Shiva’s head, and the  
god has to flee. Bhasmasur is destroyed  
when the god **Vishnu** tricks him into  
putting his hand on top of his own head,  
which instantly transforms him into ash.  
In metaphorical usage, the term  
*Bhasmasur* denotes any problem that  
has grown out of hand through lack  
of foresight.
