title = "Bahiryaga"

+++
(“external **sacrifice**”) In Hindu **worship**,  
especially in esoteric ritual tradition  
known as **tantra**, bahiryaga refers to any  
type of religious practice involving  
actions, words, or the manipulation of  
concrete objects. This is the only kind of  
worship that most people perform. The  
ultimate goal in tantra, however, is to  
internalize these acts through repeated  
practice and to transform them into  
**antaryaga** (“internal sacrifice”), in  
which all external actions have been  
replaced by mental acts.
