title = "Bhajan"

+++
(“sharing”) General name for a religious  
or devotional hymn, which is almost  
always sung in a vernacular language. As  
an expression of personal devotion, bhajans have no prescribed forms and in  
contemporary times are often set to the  
melodies of film songs. As a genre, bhajans can have any or all of the following  
themes: detailing the deeds of a particular **deity**, praising the deity, addressing  
the god in a tone of complaint or humble  
supplication (vinaya), reminding the  
deity of the speaker’s difficulties from  
internal or external sources, or warning  
the listeners to examine and reform their  
lives. Singing and listening to such  
hymns was, and remains, a major form  
of religious activity in the **bhakti** (devotional) movement. During these  
sessions, devotees (**bhakta**) “share”  
their songs and experiences with one  
another. Although one can find bhajans  
dedicated to all the gods in the  
pantheon, from a historical perspective  
this singing tradition has been strongest  
among the devotees of **Vishnu**.  
**Vaishnava** devotional literature is full  
of tales of Vishnu coming in disguise to  
take part in bhajan sessions, since the  
company of his devotees is said to be  
**heaven** on **earth**.
