title = "Bhagavad Gita"

+++
One of the best-known Hindu scriptures, which is itself a section in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics. The parts of the epic before  
the Bhagavad Gita chronicle the growing  
strife between the **Pandavas** and the  
**Kauravas**, the two branches of a royal  
family who are the epic’s main characters. The parts following the Bhagavad  
Gita detail the battle that ultimately  
destroys the entire family. The Bhagavad  
Gita itself is set in that moment of calm  
just before the battle begins, and it is  
written as a dialogue between the  
**Pandava** prince **Arjuna** and the  
supreme divinity **Krishna**, here disguised as Arjuna’s charioteer. Arjuna is  
the world’s greatest archer and can decimate his enemies with ease. But as he  
looks at the faces of the enemy, he realizes that the people he is about to fight  
and kill are his relatives, teachers, and  
friends. Not surprisingly, the prospect  
leaves him cold, and it is up to Krishna  
to give him divine guidance.  
The Gita’s second chapter opens with  
Krishna trying to shame Arjuna into  
fighting (in essence, saying “everyone  
will think you were afraid and make fun  
of you”), but when this tactic fails,  
Krishna has to give more substantive  
advice, which makes up the rest of the  
text. Different parts of the Bhagavad  
Gita invoke all three of the generally  
accepted paths to liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**): the path of wisdom  
(**jnanamarga**), the path of action  
(**karmamarga**), and the path of  
devotion (**bhaktimarga**).  
The path of wisdom is rooted in the  
teachings of the speculative texts known  
as the **Upanishads**. This path stresses  
the realization of one’s essential nature  
as the eternal Self (**atman**). The atman is  
identical with the universal reality  
known as **Brahman**; once one has  
accepted this, all dualistic ideas and  
false knowledge disappear. The path of  
action stresses acting without selfish  
desire—performing one’s duty as duty,  
but without attachment to the ultimate  
outcome. This path thus upholds and  
reinforces the rigid social structure propounded in the **dharma literature**. As a  
warrior in that social system, Arjuna’s  
93  
Bhagavad Gita  
job is to kill people. At the same time,  
the path of action provides a way to  
transform socially sanctioned duty into  
religious practice. The path of devotion  
entails surrendering all one’s actions to  
God and performing one’s role as an  
instrument of divine will.  
The Bhagavad Gita shows no clear  
preference for any of these paths, which  
implies that different writers reworked  
the text over time. Professor Arthur  
Llewellyn Basham has speculated that  
the “original” Bhagavad Gita ended with  
verse 2.38, after a section establishing  
the morality of fighting in a just war,  
thus giving Arjuna his rationale to fight.  
It is believed that this “original” text was  
then reworked by a philosopher of  
the upanishadic type, who conceived  
of the Ultimate Reality as the impersonal Brahman and of liberation in  
terms of mystical realization. The  
final sections were most likely added  
by a passionate devotee (**bhakta**) of  
**Vishnu**, particularly in his form as  
Krishna. According to Basham, this  
last author not only inserted verses in  
some of the earlier books but also  
added some completely new ones.  
One of these, Arjuna’s vision of  
Krishna’s cosmic form in the Gita’s  
eleventh chapter, is considered  
among the most brilliant religious  
texts ever written. Although some  
scholars might take issue with  
specific points, Professor Basham’s  
theory seems the most convincing  
explanation for a highly varied text.  
In the roughly two thousand years  
since the Bhagavad Gita was compiled, different commentators have  
interpreted its message according to  
their own proclivities. The ninthcentury philosopher **Shankaracharya**  
saw it as sanctioning the path of wisdom, while the eleventh-century  
philosopher **Ramanuja** was convinced that it stressed devotion. The  
most recent pivotal interpreter,  
**Mohandas Gandhi**, understood the  
text as commanding action. He saw in  
Arjuna’s struggle a blueprint for his  
own time and work, urging him to  
labor for Indian independence but to  
do so without attachment or hope for  
personal gain. The text has become  
even more important as a “scripture”  
during the past two centuries, largely  
because of pressure from Christian  
missionaries. One sign of this is that  
in modern Indian courtrooms, the  
Gita is the text upon which Hindus  
take the oath of truthfulness when  
being called to take the stand. For an  
accessible translation of the text  
itself, see Barbara Stoller Miller
