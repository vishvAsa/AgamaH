title = "Bhagavan"

+++
(“Blessed One”) Name denoting both  
respect and reverence. In different contexts this name can be used as an epithet of either the god **Krishna** (as in the  
**Bhagavad Gita**) or the god **Shiva**. In  
modern usage, at least in northern  
India, it is also the word that comes closest to expressing the notion of abstract  
divinity, much like the word “God” in  
English. It is often used to denote God  
by Hindus who are religious but who do  
not **worship** particular **deities**.
