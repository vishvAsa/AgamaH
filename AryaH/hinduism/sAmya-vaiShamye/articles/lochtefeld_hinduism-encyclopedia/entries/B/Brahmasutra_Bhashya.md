+++
A commentary (**bhashya**) written by the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya** on  
**Badarayanaâ€™s Brahma Sutras**, a collection of 555 brief aphorisms (**sutras**) that  
form the basis for the philosophical  
school known as **Vedanta**. This commentary is the defining text for the  
**Advaita Vedanta** school of Indian **philosophy**. Shankaracharya begins his  
investigation by establishing the Self as  
the basis of all knowledge, since the one  
thing that can never be doubted is the  
reality of the one who knows. He identifies this knowing consciousness as the  
eternal Self, or **atman**, which never  
changes over time despite the vicissitudes of the physical bodies it inhabits.  
According to Shankaracharya, the perceivable world is clearly subject to  
change and thus is not the Absolute  
Reality, which the philosopher identifies as the unqualified, unchanging  
**Brahman**. Following the **Upanishads**,  
Shankaracharya identifies atman as  
identical to Brahman. He states that for  
human beings the reason for both  
unhappiness and the bondage of the  
soul is the ignorance of this relationship,  
which causes one to mistake this perceivable reality for the Ultimate Reality.  
With the destruction of this mistaken  
understanding, all bonds are broken,  
and the person attains final liberation.
