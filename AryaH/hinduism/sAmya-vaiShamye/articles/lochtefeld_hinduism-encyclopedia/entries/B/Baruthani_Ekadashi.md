title = "Baruthani Ekadashi"

+++
Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the dark, or waning, half  
of the **lunar month** of **Baisakh**, which  
takes place within April and May. The  
festival is dedicated to the **worship** of  
**Vishnu**, especially in his **Vamana**  
**avatar**, which is his fifth incarnation.  
Most Hindu festivals have certain  
prescribed rites, usually involving fasting (**upavasa**) and worship, and often  
promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. Those observing this ritual should abstain from anger and  
backbiting and eat food that is prepared without salt or oil. The name  
*Baruthani* means “armored” or “protected,” and faithfully observing this  
festival is believed to protect one from  
all evil and grant enormous good fortune. In the charter myth, an **ascetic**  
whose foot has been chewed off by a  
wild beast regains the limb by performing this ritual.
