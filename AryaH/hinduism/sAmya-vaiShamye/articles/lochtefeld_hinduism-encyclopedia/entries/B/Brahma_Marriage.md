title = "Brahma Marriage"

+++
One of the eight ways to perform a  
marriage according to the **Dharma**  
**Shastras**, the treatises on religious  
duty (**dharma**). In a **Brahma** marriage  
the bride’s father gives away his  
**daughter**, along with any ornaments  
he can afford, to a learned man of  
good character. This man is respectfully invited to accept her with  
absolutely no conditions or fees. This  
form is considered the most suitable  
for **Brahmans** because it is free from  
lust or any sort of financial inducements, hence the name *Brahma marriage*. For these reasons it is also  
deemed the best of the four approved  
(prashasta) forms of marriage.  
The Brahma marriage is one of the  
two forms practiced in modern India. It  
is by far the more socially respectable,  
since the **asura marriage**—in which the  
groom gives money to the bride and her  
family—carries the connotation of selling the bride. Yet even with the Brahma

marriage, there has been significant  
divergence from the classically mandated form. In many modern Indian  
weddings, it has become common for  
the bride’s family to give the groom’s  
family a **dowry** as a condition for  
the marriage, which can easily be  
interpreted as selling the groom. See

and **prashasta marriages**.
