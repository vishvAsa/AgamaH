title = "Brahmacharin"

+++
(“seeker of **Brahman**”) A term with several possible meanings depending on  
the context. In the **dharma literature**,  
which gives instruction on religious  
duties, a brahmacharin is a person in a  
period of religious study. This period is  
the first of the four ashramas (“**stages of**  
**life**”) of a **twice-born** man, that is, a man  
born into one of three groups in Indian  
society: **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**.  
Such men are eligible to receive the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the  
“second birth.” According to the ideal,  
after his initiation and adornment with  
the **sacred thread**—the most visible sign  
of a twice-born man—the brahmacharin shall live in his **guru’s** household and study the **Veda**, the oldest  
Hindu religious text, in addition to performing other religious acts. Since brahmacharins are focused on gaining  
religious knowledge, this is supposed to  
be a very austere time of life marked by  
strict **celibacy**, hard work, service to the  
teacher, meticulous observance of all  
religious rites, and avoidance of luxuries  
such as beds, cosmetics, and bodily  
ornaments. Once this period of study is  
over, the student will marry and enter  
the second ashrama, that of the householder. The system described in the  
dharma literature is an idealized model,  
and one cannot be sure that it was ever  
strictly followed. Although many contemporary brahmin boys still undergo  
the “second birth,” other elements—  
such as the **ascetic** lifestyle and emphasis on the study of the Veda—are largely  
ignored in contemporary times.  
Some of the term’s original meaning remains in an ascetic context.  
*Brahmacharin* can also be defined as a  
novice or junior monk, whose duty is to  
serve and learn from the senior monks,  
or as the name of two particular ascetic  
groups. One of these groups is the prestigious **Swaminarayan sect**, whose  
members are recruited solely from the  
**caste** of brahmins. The other is an organization called the Brahmachari  
**Sanyasis**, devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva** who are distinct from the  
**Dashanami** Sanyasis. The Brahmachari  
Sanyasis have an **ashram** on Mount  
**Girnar** and in the bathing (**snana**)  
festival known as the **Kumbha Mela**,  
the Brahmachari **Naga** (fighting)  
Sanyasis have a recognized place  
among the other Naga groups. For
