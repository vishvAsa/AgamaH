The bana linga, an egg-shaped stone,  
is believed to be a manifestation of the god Shiva.  
traditional lore, banias are invariably  
painted as greedy and avaricious people  
who care about nothing but money.  
Although they were often stereotyped as  
parasites, banias were a necessary part  
of the traditional agricultural economy,  
because they gave farmers goods on  
credit to be repaid after the harvest.  
They also lent farmers money to get  
started again after a bad harvest. Both  
groups thus depended on one anotherâ€”  
the farmers for capital, the banias for  
continuing consumption and patronage. For a masterful reconstruction of  
the ethos in the northern Indian merchant family, in which Hindu piety was  
an important element, see C. A. Bayly,
