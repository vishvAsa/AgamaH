title = "Bhang"

+++
Paste or dough made from crushed marijuana (*Cannabis sativa*), which is often  
mixed with spices or other flavorings  
before being formed into a ball. It is  
taken as an **intoxicant**, either eaten, or  
mixed into a “cooling” milk-based drink  
called **thandai**. In general, **eating** bhang  
is disapproved of by respectable people,  
although it is fairly common in certain  
circles, particularly among ascetics.  
Despite this basic disapproval, bhang is  
widely consumed as part of the festival  
celebrations for **Shivaratri** and **Holi**,  
even by people who avoid it the rest of  
101  
Bhang  
the year. The former festival is dedicated  
to **Shiva**, who is famous for his love of  
the **drug**, whereas Holi is associated  
with overturning social boundaries, giving greater license to do things normally  
proscribed. Aside from being consumed  
during certain celebrations, it can also  
be taken in special places, particularly  
when on a pilgrimage. Several of the  
most famous Hindu sacred sites  
(**tirthas**)—among them **Benares**, **Puri**,  
and **Haridwar**—have government-run  
bhang stands where pilgrims can fulfill  
their needs.
