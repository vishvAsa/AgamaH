title = "Bharud"

+++
The name for a specific genre of **bhakti**  
(devotional) poetry, found particularly  
among the **Varkari Panth**, a religious  
community centered around the **worship** of the Hindu god **Vithoba** at his  
temple at **Pandharpur**, in the modern  
state of **Maharashtra**. The bharud is  
essentially a dramatic poem in which  
the speaker takes on one or more roles  
to convey the message of devotion to  
God. It was especially favored by the  
poet-saint **Eknath**, who used the genre  
to adopt the personae of **women**,  
**untouchables**, Muslims, and other marginal people. In modern times these  
bharuds have become the basis for popular dramas, usually performed during  
the biannual Varkari pilgrimage to  
Pandharpur. While singing the songs of  
the earlier saints during a pilgrimage is  
an important religious act, these modern renditions are mainly for entertainment. The actors playing the roles in  
these bharuds frequently add in their  
own words and actions, which are often  
quite bawdy.
