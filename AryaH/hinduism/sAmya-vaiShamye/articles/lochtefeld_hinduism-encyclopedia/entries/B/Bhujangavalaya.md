title = "Bhujangavalaya"

+++
(“snake bracelet”) In Hindu iconography, the name of a particular ornament  
worn by the god **Shiva**. The bhujangavalaya is a bracelet shaped in the form  
of a snake. In Hindu mythology Shiva is  
famous for wearing serpents, especially  
cobras, as ornaments around his  
arms and torso. This is just one of the  
attributes that marks him as different,  
powerful, and potentially dangerous.  
The prescriptive canons for the creation  
of Hindu images have followed up on  
this tradition, and Shiva is invariably  
shown wearing these bracelets.
