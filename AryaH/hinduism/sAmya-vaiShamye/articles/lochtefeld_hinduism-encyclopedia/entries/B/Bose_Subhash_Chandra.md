title = "Bose, Subhash Chandra"

+++
(1896â€“1945) Bengali politician and freedom fighter. Before World War II, Bose  
had unsuccessfully contested with  
**Mohandas K. Gandhi** for the leadership  
of the Congress Party. Bose was more  
impatient than Gandhi for the British to  
leave, and he was more willing to expel  
them by force. During World War II, Bose  
used Japanese patronage to form the  
Indian National Army (INA), whose  
objective was to expel the British from  
India by armed force. Starting in  
Singapore the INA marched 5,000 miles  
through Southeast Asia, but they were  
ultimately defeated by the British army  
at the city of Kohima in eastern India.  
Although there is eyewitness testimony  
that Bose died from burns stemming  
from a plane crash in the final days of  
the Pacific war, even today many  
Bengalis believe that he is still alive and  
living incognito.
