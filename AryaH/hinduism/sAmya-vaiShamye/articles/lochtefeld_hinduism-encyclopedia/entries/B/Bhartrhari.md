title = "Bhartrhari"

+++
(5th c. C.E.) **Sanskrit** poet-philosopher  
who authored the **Shatakatrayam**  
(“Three Hundred”), a three-part collection of poems on political life, love, and  
renunciation. According to legend,  
Bhartrhari was born the **son** of the **brahmin** Vidyasagara and his **shudra** wife,  
**Mandakini**. Vidyasagara was the adviser  
to the king of Kalinga and was given the  
kingdom upon the ruler’s death; after  
Vidyasagara’s death Bhartrhari’s brothers  
designated him as king. Bhartrhari was  
very happy until he realized that his wife  
was being unfaithful to him. When her  
secret was discovered she tried to poison him. Completely disillusioned,  
Bhartrhari renounced the world to live  
as an **ascetic**, during which time he  
reputedly composed his poetry.  
Although this is a good story, since  
many of these poems stress the degradation inherent in courtly life,  
Bhartrhari was most likely a courtier. His  
poetry treats all of the conventional purposes of life. The first two sections are  
about power (**artha**), sensual desire  
(**kama**), and righteous action (**dharma**),  
whereas the final section is concerned  
with the ultimate end, or liberation of  
the soul (**moksha**). For further information see Barbara Stoller Miller (trans.),
