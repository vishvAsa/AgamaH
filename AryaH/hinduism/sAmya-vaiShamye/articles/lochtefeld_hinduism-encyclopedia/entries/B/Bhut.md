title = "Bhut"

+++
(“[someone who] was”) The spirit of a  
person who has recently died, which is  
still inappropriately connected to the  
world of the living. This is often a troubling or malevolent presence, either to  
the departed’s family or the general population. Bhuts and other malignant spirits, such as **prets** or **churails**, have  
generally either suffered an untimely or  
violent death or died with certain unfulfilled desires, particularly relating  
to marriage and family life. In cases  
where both these factors are present, the  
likelihood of the departed becoming a  
bhut is deemed much greater. Bhuts  
make themselves known to the living  
through either **dreams** or **possession**. In  
some cases they have specific requests  
and can be placated by **worship** and  
**offerings**. In such cases the dreams and  
possession are methods of communicating with the living, who can perform  
the necessary actions. Some bhuts  
resort to possession as an attempt to  
realize their unfulfilled desires by  
directly using a living person’s body.  
These spirits are far more malevolent,  
and the only way to remove them is  
through exorcism. For further information on the care of restless family spirits,

*Journeys*, 1988; for a masterful psychological interpretation of spirits, possession, and healing, see Sudhir Kakar,  
*Shamans*, *Mystics*, *and Doctors*, 1991.
