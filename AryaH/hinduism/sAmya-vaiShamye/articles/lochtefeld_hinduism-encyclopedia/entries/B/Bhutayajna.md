+++
(“**sacrifice** to creatures”) One of the five  
great sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**)  
that is prescribed in the texts on religious duty (**Dharma Shastras**). These  
five great sacrifices are daily religious  
observances for a “**twice-born**” householder, that is, a householder born into  
one of the three “twice-born” groups in  
Indian society—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**,  
and **vaishya**—who is eligible to receive  
the adolescent religious **initiation**  
known as the “second birth.” Each sacrifice (**yajna**) is directed toward a different  
class of beings, from the Ultimate  
Reality down to **animals**, and is satisfied  
by specific actions. The bhutayajna is  
directed toward animals and outcasts  
(and in some understandings, **ghosts**),  
and it is satisfied by putting out food for  
them to eat. In the time since the  
Dharma Shastras were composed,  
Hindu life has undergone significant  
changes, and this particular sacrifice is  
rarely performed today.
