title = "Bindu"

+++
(“drop”) In the **Shrividya** school, a particular branch of the esoteric ritual tradition known as **tantra**, the bindu is the  
name for the dot in the very center of the  
**shrichakra**, which is a Shrividya symbolic diagram (**yantra**) used in **worship**.  
The shrichakra is composed of nine  
interlocking triangles—four pointing up  
and five pointing down—surrounded by  
a double series of lotus petals and exterior circular and angular walls. The  
bindu symbolizes the ultimate unity of  
the divine principles, **Shiva** and **Shakti**,  
and by extension the unity of all reality.
