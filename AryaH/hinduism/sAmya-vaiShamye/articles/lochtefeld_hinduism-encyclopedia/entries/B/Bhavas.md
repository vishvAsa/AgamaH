title = "Bhavas"

(“states”) In Indian aesthetics the  
bhavas are a set of nine states considered the most basic unadulterated emotions: sexual excitement, laughter, grief,  
anger, energy, fear, loathing, wonder,  
and peace. To these nine bhavas correspond the nine **rasas** (“tastes”), or  
moods transmitted by various types of  
artistic expression: the **erotic**, comic,  
compassionate, cruel, heroic, terrifying,  
loathsome, marvelous, and peaceful.  
Although these bhavas and rasas clearly  
correspond to one another, there is an  
important difference between them. A  
person’s emotive states come and go in  
response to circumstances that are often  
beyond one’s control. Because such naturally occurring emotions usually cannot be sustained, they are generally not  
objects of aesthetic satisfaction. This is  
not true in the case of rasa, since mood  
can be artificially generated by an artistic endeavor. Any particular rasa can  
thus be sustained and satisfying. The  
single most dominant aim in all the  
Indian arts, therefore, is to create such a  
mood or moods for the audience.
