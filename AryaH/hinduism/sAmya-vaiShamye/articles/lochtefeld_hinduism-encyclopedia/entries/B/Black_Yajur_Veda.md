title = "Black Yajur Veda"

+++
Along with the **White Yajur Veda**, one of  
the two major forms of the **Yajur Veda**,  
one of the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
The major difference between these two  
forms is in the placement of explanatory  
notes on the Vedic **mantras** (sacred  
sounds) and their significance. The four  
recensions of the Black Yajur Veda  
include these notes in the text itself. In  
contrast, the one recension of the White  
Yajur Veda gathers these notes into an  
appendix known as a **Brahmana**, which  
gives its name to the second major stratum of Vedic texts.
