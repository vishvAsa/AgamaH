title = "Baisakhi"

+++
Annual festival taking place in the  
**lunar month** of **Baisakh** (April–May),  
for which it is named. Baisakhi marks  
the **sun’s** transition into Aries, which  
according to the Indian estimation  
occurs around April 14. This festival  
marks the beginning of the solar **year**  
on the traditional **calendar**. Baisakhi  
is celebrated mainly in the north, particularly in the state of **Punjab** and its  
surrounding regions. In the days when  
pilgrims still traveled through the  
**Himalayas** on foot, this festival  
marked the beginning of the  
Himalayan pilgrimage season; during  
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Baisakhi was the occasion for  
a great trading festival in the town of  
**Haridwar**, the gateway to the  
Himalayan shrines. Although this fair  
has long been eclipsed, Baisakhi is  
still the climactic bathing (**snana**)  
day for the Haridwar **Kumbha Mela**  
and **Ardha Kumbha Mela**, each of  
which is a bathing festival that occurs  
about every twelve years when  
**Jupiter** is in the sign of Aquarius (for  
the Kumbha Mela) or Leo (for the  
Ardha Kumbha Mela).
