(“Garland of Devotees”) Text written by  
**Nabhadas** (ca. 1600) in which he gives  
short (six-line) biographical accounts of  
over two hundred **bhakti** (devotional)  
figures. Although Nabhadas himself was  
a **Ramanandi**, and thus a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Rama**, his work not  
only includes devotees of all sectarian  
persuasions but is generally considered  
unbiased. The text is notably free of  
astonishing and miraculous events.  
Instead, the main emphasis is on the  
devotee’s personal qualities, which serve  
as a model for others. In many cases the  
*Bhaktamal* gives the earliest reliable  
account of these figures, which makes it  
an extremely important source for  
northern Indian literary and religious  
history. It is all the more interesting that  
the text cannot be definitively dated,  
although internal evidence suggests that  
it was completed early in the seventeenth century.
