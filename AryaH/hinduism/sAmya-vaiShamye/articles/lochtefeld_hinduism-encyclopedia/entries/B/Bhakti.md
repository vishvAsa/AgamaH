title = "Bhakti"

+++
(“sharing”) The most common word  
denoting devotion to God. This is one of  
the three traditional paths to gain final  
liberation of the soul (**moksha**), and it  
has been the most widespread type of  
religious practice for well over a thousand years. The word’s literal meaning  
conveys the sense of relationship. On  
one hand, it refers to an intense and passionate love between devotee (**bhakta**)  
and **deity**, and on the other, it refers to  
separate communities of people bound  
together by their common love of God.  
Although references to bhakti can be  
found in such early texts as the  
**Shvetashvatara Upanishad** and the  
**Bhagavad Gita**, the bhakti propounded  
here is radically different from later

usages. In both these texts, bhakti is presented as a form of **yoga** in which one  
contemplates God as part of a controlled and disciplined practice. This is a  
far cry from the abandonment and passionate involvement in later times.  
The beginnings of this latter sort of  
bhakti arose in the Tamil country of  
deep southern India between the sixth  
and ninth centuries B.C.E. It had an  
intensity that was radically different  
from earlier notions, a devotional “heat”  
as opposed to the “coolness” of yoga.  
Tamil bhakti expressed, and continues  
to express, its devotion through songs  
sung in vernacular languages, conveying an intimate relationship with a personal god.  
These characteristics basically held  
throughout history. The use of vernacular speech was especially significant,  
for this was the language of ordinary  
life and marked the egalitarianism that  
was one of the hallmarks of bhakti  
devotion. Bhakti devotees were men and  
**women** from all strata of society, from  
the highest to the lowest; here was an  
opportunity for religious life based  
solely on the depth and sincerity of one’s  
devotion rather than on one’s **birth**.  
Despite this religious egalitarianism,  
devotees rarely tried to restructure  
their hierarchical societies. The idea was  
that religious equality was supposed  
to transcend rather than reform  
human society.  
Aside from egalitarianism and personal experience, bhakti worship also  
stressed community, based on the interconnections between devotees. Though  
each devotee was an individual (and  
indeed, bhakti poets had real personalities, as the many hagiographies bear  
witness), they also fell into “families,” all  
of which were connected with each  
other. Many of the bhakti saints fell into  
recognizable groups: Some were centered around a particular sacred place,  
such as the temple at **Pandharpur** in the  
state of **Maharashtra**; some were connected as teachers and students, such as  
**Nammalvar** and his disciple  
**Nathamuni**; and some had long-term  
associations, as with the **Lingayat** community. In all cases these devotees were  
keenly aware of those who had preceded  
them and their connections with one  
another. Such communities were both  
formed and reinforced through **satsang**,  
the “company of good people” whose  
influence over time was believed to have  
the power to transform. This was a type  
of “sharing” that bound devotees to  
each other and to their teacher, and  
through these two vehicles carried them  
to God.  
These are general characteristics,  
and bhakti’s regional manifestations  
often take on a distinct flavor marked by,  
if nothing else, the differing languages.  
The *Padma Purana* speaks of bhakti  
(a feminine noun) as a maiden who  
was born in southern India, attained  
maturity in the state of Maharashtra,  
and was rejuvenated in northern  
India. Although this is a metaphor, it  
accurately charts the historical diffusion  
of bhakti devotion, as well as its changes  
as it moved north. All forms of  
bhakti are shaped by specific times,  
places, and circumstances.
