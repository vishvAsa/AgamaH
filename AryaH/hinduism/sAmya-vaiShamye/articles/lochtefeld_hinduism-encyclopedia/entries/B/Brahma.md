Brahma is the first member of the  
**Trimurti**, the “three forms” of divinity  
made up of the dominant male **deities**  
in the Hindu pantheon: Brahma as the  
creator of the universe, **Vishnu** as the  
preserver or sustainer, and **Shiva** as the  
destroyer. Brahma is usually portrayed  
with four heads (the fifth having been  
cut off by **Bhairava**, a wrathful form of  
Shiva), and his **animal** vehicle is the  
**hamsa**, or Indian goose.  
According to one widely held myth,  
during the time of cosmic dissolution  
between world cycles, Vishnu floats in  
the middle of the cosmic ocean, lying  
on the giant serpent **Shesha**. When the  
time for creation comes, a lotus  
sprouts from Vishnu’s navel and opens  
to reveal Brahma inside. Brahma takes  
up the work of creation, and at the end  
of the world cycle, Brahma returns to  
the lotus, which is reabsorbed into  
Vishnu. Because of his spontaneous  
appearance at the beginning of every  
cosmic age, one of the names for  
Brahma is **Svayambhu** (“self-born”).  
Unlike the Judeo-Christian belief, the  
world is not created from nothing.  
Brahma merely arranges the existing  
elements of the universe into a coherent and ordered cosmos.  
Brahma is a major figure in the pantheon and is prominent in many  
episodes in Hindu mythology. His mythic presence often obscures the fact that  
he is never worshiped as a primary  
**deity**. In fact, he has only one temple  
devoted to him in all of India, in  
119  
Brahma  
**Pushkar**. Some Hindus have attributed  
this lack of **worship** to his status as the  
creator. After all, since creation has been  
completed, why should one bother with  
Brahma, whose work is done? In the  
**puranas**, texts on Hindu mythology, this  
lack of worship is usually ascribed to a  
**curse**—sometimes by the god Shiva but  
in other stories by the sage **Bhrgu**.
