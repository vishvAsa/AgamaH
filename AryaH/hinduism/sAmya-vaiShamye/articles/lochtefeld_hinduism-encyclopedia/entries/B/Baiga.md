title = "Baiga"

+++
(probably a corruption of the word  
*vaidaga*, or “healer”) A sorcerer, healer,  
and ritual technician connected with  
spirits at the lower levels of the pantheon; a baiga sometimes acts as a  
medium for **village deities** and at other  
times as an exorcist for witches, **bhuts**,  
and **prets**. A baiga’s power is based on  
his command of **mantras**, sacred  
sounds either acquired from a relative as  
his hereditary birthright or bought from  
a knowledgeable person. Baigas minister to people’s immediate troubles,  
whether caused by illness, misfortune,  
accident, or alleged **possession**. This  
pervasive connection with people’s  
everyday concerns makes them important figures in urban as well as rural  
India. The most successful baigas are  
those who radiate the greatest air of  
authority, and thus instill in their  
patients the confidence that the baiga  
can and will alleviate their distress. For a  
short account of the baiga’s work, see  
Lawrence Babb, *The Divine Hierarchy*,  
1975; for a more developed perspective  
on Indian healers and healing, see  
Sudhir Kakar, *Shamans*, *Mystics*, *and*  
*Doctors*, 1991.
