title = "Benares Hindu University"

+++
Indian educational institution founded  
in 1916 by the nationalist figure **Madan**  
**Mohan Malviya** (1861–1946). The World  
War I era marked a more activist orientation to the Indian independence  
movement. One of the ways this  
activism manifested itself was in founding educational institutions, which gave  
Indians greater control over the universities’ mission, tone, and curriculum.  
Benares Hindu University was founded  
to uphold Hindu cultural and philosophical traditions, but also to educate  
its students in the sciences and thus prepare them for the modern world. This  
mission reflected the modernist thinking of its founders as well as their passionate commitment to traditional  
Hindu culture. It is still one of the finest  
universities in India, particularly for the  
study of classical Indian culture.
