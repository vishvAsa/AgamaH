title = "Brahma Sutras"

+++
Variant name for **Badarayanaâ€™s Vedanta**  
**Sutras**, which date from the third to the  
fifth century B.C.E. This collection of 555  
brief aphorisms (**sutras**) is the basis for  
the philosophical school known as  
**Vedanta**, so named because it claims to  
reveal the ultimate meaning of the religious scriptures known as the **Vedas**.  
They are given the name Brahma Sutras  
because they attempt to summarize and  
systematize the philosophic and religious ideas in the speculative texts  
known as the **Upanishads**, particularly  
the ideas about the Ultimate Reality  
known as **Brahman**. The sutras are so  
brief that they presuppose commentary,  
of which the most famous is the  
**Brahmasutra Bhashya**, written by the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**.
