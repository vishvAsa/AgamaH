For most of Indian history, stone has  
been the preferred medium for creating  
images of the Hindu **deities** for **worship**.  
One of the significant exceptions to this  
trend can be found in southern India,  
primarily under the **Chola dynasty**  
127  
Bronzes  
(9th–14th c.), in which another important medium was bronze. The images  
were made using **lost wax casting**,  
which allows for great detail. They were  
cast in bronze with a high copper content, which tended to give them a greenish tinge as the metal oxidized. Some of  
the images are only a few inches high,  
albeit with exquisite detail, whereas the  
largest are over four feet tall and even  
today are the primary images worshiped  
in temples. These images were subject  
to the same established rules of construction (**shilpa shastra**) as stone  
**sculptures**. Despite this strict form,  
many of the bronzes are masterful works  
of art with a presence rarely found in the  
stone sculptures. Although images were  
made of all of the deities in the pantheon, among the best known bronzes  
are figures of the god **Shiva** as **Nataraja**,  
“the Lord of the **Dance**.”
