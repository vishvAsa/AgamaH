Figure of **Krishna** in the form of a child  
(bala). Devotees (**bhakta**) who **worship**  
this form of Krishna are partaking in the  
devotional relationship known as  
**vatsalya bhava**, which parallels the  
connection between parent and child.  
The unusual twist is that the devotee  
takes the role of the parent, lavishing  
love and care on the **deity** in its child  
form in a warm, protective, and  
intimate relationship.
