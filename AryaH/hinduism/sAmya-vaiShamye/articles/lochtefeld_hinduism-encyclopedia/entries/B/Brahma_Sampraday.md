title = "Brahma Sampraday"

+++
One of the four branches of the **Bairagi**  
**Naga** class of **ascetics**. The Bairagi Nagas  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**, organized in military fashion  
into different **anis**, or “armies.” Until the  
beginning of the nineteenth century,  
their primary occupation was as mercenary soldiers, although they also had  
substantial trading interests; both of  
these occupations have largely disappeared in contemporary times. The  
Brahma Sampraday traces its immediate spiritual lineage through the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** sect, founded by the  
Bengali devotee **Chaitanya**, but claims  
ultimate descent from the southern  
Indian philosopher **Madhva**. This latter  
123  
Brahma Sampraday  
claim seems highly suspect, in part  
because the guardian **deities** of the two  
sects are different; Chaitanya and his  
followers **worship** the gods **Krishna** and  
**Radha**, whereas Madhva and his followers worship **Lakshmi**-Narayan. There  
are also differences in their observances.  
Although the Madhva ascetics have a  
long history in southern India, they have  
virtually no presence in the north, where  
the Chaitanyite ascetics are well represented. Ghurye speculates that this  
claim is based on the desire of the  
Gaudiya Vaishnavas to establish ties to  
an ancient lineage; this would give them  
an unassailable identity and thus a place  
in the bathing (**snana**) procession at  
religious festival **Kumbha Mela**. See  
G. S. Ghurye, *Indian Sadhus*, 1964.
