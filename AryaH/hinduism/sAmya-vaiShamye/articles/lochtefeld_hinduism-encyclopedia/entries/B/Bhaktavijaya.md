(“Triumph of [God’s] Devotees”) Text  
written by **Mahipati**, an eighteenth-century writer and hagiographer of the  
devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saints. The stories in the *Bhaktavijaya* focus mainly  
on the saints connected with the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious group  
centered around the **worship** of the god  
**Vithoba** at his temple at **Pandharpur**.  
This focus is understandable since  
Mahipati himself was a Varkari. In  
keeping with the trend toward unification often promoted by the devotional  
movement, he also included tales of  
other great devotees (**bhakta**), most  
notably **Kabir**, **Namdev**, **Jnaneshvar**,  
and **Narsi Mehta**. The stories in the  
*Bhaktavijaya* present each of these  
saints as a paradigm of devotion and  
stress the power of piety to overcome all  
obstacles. This theme also marks  
Mahipati’s other major work, the  
**Bhaktililamrta**. The *Bhaktavijaya* has  
been translated by Justin E. Abbott and  
Narhar R. Godbole as *Stories of Indian*  
*Saints*, 1988.
