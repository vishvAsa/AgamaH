(“brilliance of **Bhairava**”) Name given to  
the spear that is the symbolic weapon of  
the **Mahanirvani akhara**, a particular  
group of the **Naga** class of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**. The Dashanami  
Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva** and are organized into different  
96  
Bhairava  
**akharas**, or regiments, much like an  
army. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Nagas’ primary  
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,  
although they also had substantial  
trading interests; both of these have  
occupations largely disappeared in  
contemporary times. All of the akharas  
have particular features, including this  
spear, which signify their organizational identity.
