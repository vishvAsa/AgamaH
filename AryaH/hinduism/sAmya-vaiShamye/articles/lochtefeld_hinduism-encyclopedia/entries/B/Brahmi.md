title = "Brahmi"

+++
The most commonly used script in the  
**inscriptions** of the emperor **Ashoka** (r.  
269–232 B.C.E.), the greatest figure in the  
**Maurya dynasty**. Ashoka’s empire  
encompassed all of the subcontinent  
except the deepest parts of southern  
India and went west into modern  
Afghanistan. Brahmi script was used in  
all regions of the Mauryan empire  
except in the northwest, where the  
**Kharoshthi** script was used. Ashoka’s  
**rock edicts** and **pillar edicts** are the earliest significant Indian written documents and give invaluable information  
about contemporary social, political,  
and religious life. Brahmi is the ancestor  
of the modern Indian scripts, including  
**Devanagari**. It is also the ultimate  
source for all indigenous southeast  
Asian alphabets, which developed from  
trade with southern India in the early  
medieval period. Over the course  
of time, Brahmi was replaced by  
later scripts, was forgotten, and  
became unreadable. Although Ashoka’s  
inscriptions ensured that Europeans  
were aware of Brahmi, their content was  
a mystery until 1837, when **James**  
**Prinsep** deciphered the Brahmi  
alphabet by working backward from  
later, known scripts.
