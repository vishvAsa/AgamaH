title = "Bhogamandapa"

+++
(“food pavilion”) The outermost  
entrance hall in the style of **architecture**  
found in the largest temples in **Orissa**.  
At the temple of **Jagannath** in **Puri**, the  
term *bhogamandapa* specifically refers  
to the area where the food offered to  
Jagannath as **prasad** (“favor”) is cooked.  
Jagannath’s temple is unusual in that the  
normal restrictions regarding **commensality** are suspended. Everyone eats  
together rather than being segregated by  
**caste**, signifying Jagannath’s ultimate  
lordship over all beings. The prominence of this particular rite makes the  
bhogamandapa all the more important.
