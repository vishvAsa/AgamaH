title = "Bhamati Advaita"

+++
A later branch of the **Advaita Vedanta**  
philosophical school. The Advaita  
school upholds a position known as  
monism, which is the belief that a single  
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things  
and that everything is merely a differing  
form of that reality. Advaita proponents  
believe that reality is nondual (advaita),  
that is, that all things are nothing but the  
formless, unqualified **Brahman** despite  
the appearance of diversity. For the  
Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is  
a fundamental misunderstanding of the  
ultimate nature of things, or **avidya**.  
Although often translated as “ignorance,” *avidya* is better understood as  
a lack of genuine understanding,  
which ultimately causes human beings  
to be trapped in karmic bondage,  
reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
Bhamati Advaita is based on the  
ideas of **Mandana Mishra**, although the  
school takes its name from a commentary written by Mandana’s disciple  
**Vachaspati Mishra**. Mandana was a  
contemporary of the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**, Advaita Vedanta’s  
greatest exponent, and took definitive  
stands on several philosophical points  
on which Shankaracharya had remained  
silent. One such point was the location  
of avidya, which Mandana claimed must  
be each individual Self because it was  
absurd to conceive of Brahman as subject to ignorance. For Mandana there  
were clearly multiple, separate selves,  
since one person’s liberation did not  
bring liberation for all.  
Mandana’s comments presupposed  
the existence of a common, if illusory,  
world, which his followers explained as  
the activity of one primal ignorance;  
however, they also had to explain how a  
single primal ignorance could simultaneously affect multiple souls. This was  
done using philosophical models known  
as **limitationism** and **reflectionism**,  
although it is the former that has been  
more commonly associated with the  
Bhamati school. Limitationism assumes  
that there are some things (i.e., the color  
red) that we do not conceive of as  
divided, even when different red colors  
appear in different places. In the same  
way, the Bhamati school argued, avidya  
can be found in multiple souls at  
the same time but is complete and  
undivided in each of them.  
Reflectionism is based on the idea of a  
mirror’s image, which is different from  
the original but made from it. Therefore  
100  
Bhaktimarga  
the avidya found in any particular soul is  
a “reflection” of the original avidya. For
