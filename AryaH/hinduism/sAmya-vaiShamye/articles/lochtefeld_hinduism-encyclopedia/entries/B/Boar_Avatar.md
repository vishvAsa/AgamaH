title = "Boar Avatar"

+++
The third **avatar**, or “incarnation,” of the  
god **Vishnu**. Vishnu takes this form at  
the beginning of one of the cosmic ages,  
when the process of creation has been  
interrupted by the disappearance of the  
**Earth**. The source of this problem is the  
demon-king **Hiranyaksha**, who has  
kidnapped the Earth and hidden her in  
the depths of the cosmic ocean. Taking  
the form of a giant boar, Vishnu dives to  
the bottom of the ocean, where he slays  
Hiranyaksha, places the Earth on the tip  
of his tusk, and lifts her from the waters.  
With the reappearance of the Earth, the  
process of creation resumes.  
It is generally accepted that the  
avatar doctrine provided a way to assimilate smaller regional **deities** into the  
larger pantheon by designating them as  
forms of Vishnu. This inference is  
supported by the Boar avatar, which  
seems to have absorbed an ancient cult  
in central India by making the boar an  
incarnation of Vishnu. In modern times  
the Boar avatar is worshiped little,  
although it had a significant following  
in the past, particularly in central  
India. This is partly supported by the  
sculptural record; the caves at **Ellora**  
and **Udayagiri** have particularly  
fine sculptural renditions of this  
avatar. For further information see
