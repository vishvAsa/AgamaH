(“seed syllable”) In the esoteric ritual  
tradition known as **tantra**, a bijakshara  
is a particular set of syllabic utterances  
that is believed to have an intimate connection with a **deity**—either as a way of  
gaining access to the god’s power or as  
the subtlest form of the deity itself.  
These syllables are usually meaningless  
sounds (for example, *aum*, *hrim*, *klim*),  
although at times they may contain  
actual words. Bijaksharas are important  
not for their meaning but for the power  
inherent in the sounds themselves. The  
transmission of such seed syllables and  
the entitlement (**adhikara**) to use them  
is an important feature of tantric **initiation** (**diksha**). For further information

*Tantric Tradition*, 1977; and Douglas
