+++
(“path of devotion”) Along with the path  
of action (**karmamarga**) and the path of  
wisdom (**jnanamarga**), this is one of  
Hinduism’s three generally accepted  
ways to gain final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). The bhaktimarga seeks  
release of the soul through **bhakti**, or  
passionate devotion to God.
