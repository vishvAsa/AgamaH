+++
(BJP) Modern Indian political party with  
a strong Hindu nationalist (**Hindutva**)  
orientation. The party was formed as the  
political wing of the Hindu nationalist  
organization known as **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS), and many of  
the BJP’s leaders have been RSS members  
for decades. The BJP was formed in 1980  
after the dissolution of its predecessor  
organization, the **Jana Sangh**. The latter  
was an RSS affiliate as well, several of the  
whose leaders, notably **Lal Krishna**  
**Advani** and Atal Behari Vajpayee, have  
also led the BJP. At first the BJP took a  
moderate political stance and fared  
quite poorly, winning only two seats in  
the 1984 elections. In the later 1980s it  
took a far more militant tone, stressing  
as its focal issue the campaign to build  
the **Ram Janam Bhumi** temple in  
**Ayodhya**. As the Indian electorate grew  
more religiously polarized, the BJP  
climbed to eighty-six seats in 1989 and  
120 seats in 1991. In the 1996 elections it  
won 160 seats, becoming the largest single party in India’s 535-seat Parliament.

The president of India invited the BJP to  
form a government, but this failed when  
it was unable to gain enough support  
from other parties to muster a majority  
of votes in Parliament.  
The BJP’s traditional constituency has  
been **brahmins** and members of the  
trading communities, both of whom  
tend to be religiously conservative and  
supportive of the Hindutva message. In  
the mid-1990s the BJP muted its Hindu  
nationalist rhetoric in an attempt to  
reach beyond these traditional constituencies and to gain more widespread  
support by moving closer to the political  
center. Despite these changes, many of  
the established secular parties still view  
the BJP with suspicion and have refused  
to ally themselves with the organization.  
The BJP’s inability to mobilize such support among the larger body politic was a  
major factor behind the collapse of its  
short-lived government in 1996. The  
country was then run by a coalition of  
thirteen secular political parties, whose  
single binding commitment is their  
opposition to the BJP. However, since  
1998 the BJP has succeeded in building  
coalitions to form a government. For
