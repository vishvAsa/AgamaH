title = "Begampura"

+++
Fictional city named in one of the  
poems written by the poet-saint  
**Ravidas** (ca. 1500). The word *begam* can  
mean either “queen” or “without pain.”  
The poem clearly shows the city as an  
idealized place far from the tribulations  
of ordinary human life, such as pain,  
sorrow, taxes, wrongdoing, and to a  
lesser extent, class distinctions.  
Although Ravidas was born a tanner  
(**chamar**), an occupation that was  
looked down upon, this is one of his  
only poems that speaks about social  
issues, however indirectly.
