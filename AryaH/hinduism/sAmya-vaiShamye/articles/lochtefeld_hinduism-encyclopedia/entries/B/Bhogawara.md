One of the four major organizational  
groups of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
renunciant **ascetics** who are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**; the other  
three groups are **Kitawara**, **Bhuriwara**,  
and **Anandawara**. Each of these divisions has its headquarters in one of the  
four monastic centers (**maths**) supposedly established by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. Each group also has  
111  
Bhogawara  
certain religious associations: with one  
of the four **Vedas**, with a particular quarter of the Indian subcontinent, with one  
of the “great utterances” (**mahavakyas**)  
expressing ultimate truth, with a  
specific ascetic quality, and with several  
of the ten Dashanami divisions. The  
Bhogawara group is affiliated with the  
**Govardhan Math** in the city of **Puri** on  
the Bay of Bengal, and it is therefore  
connected with the eastern quarter of  
India. Their Veda is the **Rg Veda**, their  
mahavakya is Prajnanam **Brahman**  
(“Knowledge is Brahman”), and their  
ascetic quality is to remain indifferent to  
worldly pleasures. The particular  
divisions associated with this group  
are the **Aranya Dashanamis** and  
**Vana Dashanamis**.
