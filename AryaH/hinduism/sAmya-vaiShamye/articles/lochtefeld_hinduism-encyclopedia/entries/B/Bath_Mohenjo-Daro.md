title = "Bath, Mohenjo-Daro"

+++
One of the most striking structures excavated at **Mohenjo-Daro**, the first city of  
the **Indus Valley civilization** to be discovered. This bath is an oblong pool,  
thirty-nine by twenty-three feet in area  
and eight feet deep. It is built of brick  
and sealed with pitch. The tank could be  
drained through an opening in one corner, and it was surrounded on all four  
sides by small rooms reminiscent of  
changing rooms. The Indus Valley cities  
gave great attention to plumbing, sanitation, and sewers, suggesting that  
bathing (**snana**) may have been connected with ritual **purity** as in modern  
Hindu life. With this in mind, the bath  
was probably not a swimming pool but  
rather had some deeper connection  
with religious life. For further information see Walter Ashlin Fairservis, *The*
