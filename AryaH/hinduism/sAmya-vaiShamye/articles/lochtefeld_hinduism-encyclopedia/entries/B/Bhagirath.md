title = "Bhagirath"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the single person  
most responsible for bringing the celestial **Ganges** down to **earth**. The river  
Ganges and the **goddess** Ganges are the  
same, hence the river is considered holy.  
Bhagirath is the great-great-grandson of  
King **Sagar**, whose 60,000 **sons** have  
been burned to ash by the sage **Kapila’s**  
**magic** power when they erroneously  
accuse Kapila of being a thief. The sage  
later tells **Anshuman**, King Sagar’s  
grandson and sole surviving descendant, that the only way to bring peace to  
their souls is to bring the Ganges from  
**heaven** down to earth. Anshuman  
strives to do this for the rest of his life, as  
does his son **Dilip** after him, but both  
are unsuccessful. Dilip’s son Bhagirath  
takes their efforts to heart and retires to  
the **Himalayas**, where he performs  
**asceticism** until the gods finally agree to  
send the Ganges down to earth. Yet  
Bhagirath’s efforts are not over. He next  
has to appease the god **Shiva** so that the  
deity will agree to take the shock of the  
falling river on his head, since its force  
will otherwise destroy the earth. When  
all is finally in place, the Ganges falls to  
earth onto the head of Shiva. From there  
Bhagirath leads the river out of the  
mountains to the sea, where she touches  
his ancestors’ ashes, after which they  
find peace at last.
