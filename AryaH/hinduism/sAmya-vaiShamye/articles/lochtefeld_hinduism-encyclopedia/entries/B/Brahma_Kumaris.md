title = "Brahma Kumaris"

+++
Modern Hindu religious organization  
founded in the 1930s by a Sindhi jeweler  
named Dada Lekhraj. In 1947, after the  
partition of British India into India and  
Pakistan, the organization relocated its  
headquarters from Sindh (in modern  
Pakistan) to Mount Abu in the Indian  
state of **Rajasthan**. Although the sect  
has only about 100,000 members—  
minuscule by Hindu standards—it is  
noteworthy for several reasons. Unlike  
most Hindus, the Brahma Kumaris  
aggressively seeks out and converts new  
members, and thus it has a much higher  
profile than other religious sects. The  
organization preaches a doctrine foretelling the imminent end of the world,  
which must be prepared for by radical  
**asceticism**. It is also noteworthy that  
since its beginning, the majority of its  
adherents have been **women**.  
The movement began following a  
series of apocalyptic visions by Dada  
Lekhraj. These visions not only convinced him of the coming tribulation  
but also reinforced his conviction that a  
human being’s real identity lay not in  
the body but in the soul. This latter realization resulted in the organization’s  
adoption of complete **celibacy**. When  
this ideal was adopted by some of his  
young women followers, it initially led to  
a tremendous uproar, because they  
renounced their primary traditional  
roles as wives and mothers. The movement persisted despite these troubles,  
which bound the followers together  
even more tightly. By the time Dada  
Lekhraj died in 1969, the movement had  
developed a strong missionary bent. All  
of these factors make it unusual and, in  
the eyes of many ordinary Hindus, marginal and suspicious. For further information see Lawrence Babb, *Redemptive*
