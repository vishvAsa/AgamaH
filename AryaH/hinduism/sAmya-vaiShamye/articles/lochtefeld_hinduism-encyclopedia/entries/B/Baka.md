+++
In Hindu mythology, a **demon** killed by  
the god **Krishna** during Krishna’s  
childhood in **Braj**. Baka is one of the  
demon assassins sent by Krishna’s  
wicked uncle, **Kamsa**, to try to get rid  
of the god. He comes to Braj in the  
form of a giant crane (baka) and swallows Krishna and his companions, but  
he is killed when Krishna expands to  
such a giant size in Baka’s stomach that  
the demon explodes.
