+++
(2) (7th c. C.E.) Poet and author who was  
a contemporary of the northern Indian  
emperor **Harsha** (r. 606–647), and one of  
the leading members of Harsha’s court.  
Bana is widely acclaimed as one of the  
great **Sanskrit** writers, based on his two  
best works: the **Harshacharita**, a panegyric narrative of Harsha’s deeds, and  
**Kadambari**, a romance left unfinished  
at his death. He is also famous for his  
*Chandishataka*, a collection of one  
hundred poems dedicated to the  
differing forms of the **Goddess**.
