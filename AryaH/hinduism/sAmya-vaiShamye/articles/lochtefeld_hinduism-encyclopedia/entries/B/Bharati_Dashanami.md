title = "Bharati Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
**ascetics** who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**. The Dashanamis were supposedly  
established by the ninth-century  
philosopher **Shankaracharya** in an  
effort to create a corps of learned men  
who could help to revitalize Hindu life.  
Each of the divisions is designated by a  
different name—in this case, *bharati*  
(“Indian”). Upon **initiation**, new members are given this name as a surname to  
their new ascetic names, thus allowing  
for immediate group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten divisions are divided into four  
larger organizational groups. Each  
group has its headquarters in one of the  
four monastic centers (**maths**) supposedly established by Shankaracharya, as  
well as other particular religious associations. The Bharati Dashanamis belong  
to the **Bhuriwara** group, which is affiliated with the **Shringeri Math** in the  
southern Indian town of **Shringeri**. The  
Bharati division is elite because it is one  
of the few that will initiate only **brahmins**. Other such divisions are the  
**Saraswati Dashanamis**, **Tirtha**  
**Dashanamis**, and **Ashrama Dashanamis**.  
The Bharatis are unusual, however,  
since only part of the division is  
restricted to brahmins.
