(“Nectar of the Play of Devotion”) Text  
written by **Mahipati**, an eighteenthcentury writer and hagiographer of the  
devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saints.  
Mahipati belonged to the **Varkari**  
**Panth**, a religious group centered  
around the **worship** of the god **Vithoba**  
at his temple at **Pandharpur**. The  
*Bhaktililamrta* gives extended accounts  
of Varkari saints, such as **Eknath**,  
**Tukaram**, Ramdas, and Bhanudas. The  
text presents each of these saints as a  
paradigm of devotion and stresses the  
power of worship to overcome all obstacles. This theme also marks his other  
major work, the **Bhaktavijaya**. Parts of  
the *Bhaktililamrta* have been translated  
by Justin E. Abbott as *The Life of Eknath*,  
1981; and *The Life of Tukaram*, 1980.
