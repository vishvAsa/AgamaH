title = "Brahmana"

+++
General name for the second literary  
stratum in the **Vedas**, the earliest and  
most authoritative Hindu religious  
texts. Although the composition of  
these differing parts of the Veda is not  
completely linear, the Brahmanas generally come after the hymns of praise to  
the gods known as **samhitas** and precede the speculative texts known as the  
**Aranyakas** and the **Upanishads**. In theory, each Veda has a Brahmana as an  
appendix, which is intended to give further explanation of the Vedic rituals.  
Although the **Yajur Veda** is the only one  
for which this is actually true, this  
understanding gives the Brahmanas  
the authority of revealed scripture  
(**shruti**) and thus makes them unquestionable. There are several different  
Brahmanas, of which the most important are the **Aiteraya Brahmana** and  
the **Shatapatha Brahmana**; the latter’s  
tone and contents (including the **Isha**  
**Upanishad**) clearly mark it as the most  
recent of the Brahmanas.  
The Brahmanas are primarily ritual  
manuals, and they give exacting,  
painstaking instructions for performing  
these Vedic rituals. These texts indicate a  
fundamental shift in religious practice,  
from the earlier emphasis on **sacrifice**  
as a means of invoking and pleasing the  
Vedic gods to an importance on the  
power of ritual itself. This new emphasis  
makes the sacrificial priests the most  
powerful people of all, since even the  
gods themselves are subject to the rituals. The power of correctly performed  
ritual paves the way for the Aranyakas  
and the Upanishads, which asks more  
speculative questions about the rituals  
themselves. At times these differing  
religious genres are juxtaposed—as in  
the Shatapatha Brahmana, in which the  
Isha Upanishad is embedded. Such juxtapositions indicate that although the  
stress varied in differing types of texts,  
there was some overlap during the time  
they were composed.
