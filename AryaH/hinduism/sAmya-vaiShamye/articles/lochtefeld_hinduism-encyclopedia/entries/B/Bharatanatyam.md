title = "Bharatanatyam"

+++
One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are **Kathak**,  
**Orissi**, **Kuchipudi**, **Kathakali**, **Chau**,  
and **Manipuri**. Bharatanatyam has its  
home in the temple towns of the state of  
**Tamil Nadu**, particularly **Tanjore** city’s  
**Brhadeshvar** temple. This temple is  
dedicated to the god **Shiva**, whose most  
famous form is **Nataraja**, the “Lord of  
the Dance.” According to tradition the  
name **bharata** comes not from the sage  
Bharata, the reputed author of the text  
on dance called the **Natyashastra**, but  
from an acronym of the dance’s three  
most important elements: “bha” from  
*bhava* (“feeling”), “ra” from **raga**  
(“melodic mood”), and “ta” from **tala**  
(“rhythm”). The second word in the  
name, *natyam*, simply means “dance.”  
Bharatanatyam’s historical roots are  
uncertain. The existence of dance can  
be dated to the early centuries C.E. since  
103  
Bharatanatyam  
A dancer performs in the classical  
Bharatanatyam form. She assumes the pose of  
Nataraja, the “Lord of the Dance.”  
it is mentioned in the two **Tamil epic**  
poems, **Shilappadigaram** and  
**Manimegalai**. Carvings at the Shiva  
temple in **Kanchipuram** suggest that  
this dance was well developed in the  
**Pallava dynasty** (6th–9th c. C.E.), but  
hard evidence for structured temple  
dance, including the hereditary dancers  
known as **devadasis**, did not appear  
until the **Chola dynasty** (9th–14th c. C.E.).  
Although royal patronage was an important factor in its survival,  
Bharatanatyam was performed primarily in the temples until the twentieth century, when the dance began to be  
performed on stage.  
As an artistic form, the dance’s present technique was codified in the early  
nineteenth century by four brothers in  
the service of Raja Serfoji II of Tanjore.  
Stylistically, Bharatanatyam presents a  
sharply geometric line. The most characteristic posture has a stiff upper torso,  
with the knees flexed outward in line  
with the rest of the body, and the feet  
spread gently outward. This posture is a  
recurring motif in any performance. As  
in all the Indian dances, Bharatanatyam  
has a well-developed vocabulary of **gesture** and expression, which makes it  
possible for the dancer to tell complex  
stories. Like most other Indian dance  
forms, Bharatanatyam has been influenced by the shift from temple to  
stage as its primary theater. Although its  
roots lie in **worship** and devotion, the  
move to the stage has inevitably disrupted some of these religious connections.
