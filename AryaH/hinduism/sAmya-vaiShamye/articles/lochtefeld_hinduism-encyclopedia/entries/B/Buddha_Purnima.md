The **full moon** in the **lunar month** of  
**Baisakh** (April–May). Buddhists  
throughout the world celebrate this full  
moon as the anniversary of the Buddha’s  
**birth**, enlightenment, and death.  
Although many Hindus respect the  
Buddha as a sage and religious teacher,  
he is not central to Hindu religion.  
Therefore, this is not a major festival,  
although this particular full moon is still  
named for him. More recently, the **day** of  
this full moon has been described as the  
best day of the **year** for bathing (**snana**)  
in sacred rivers, a practice that the  
Buddha would certainly have  
denounced. Given the **auspiciousness**  
connected with every full moon, this  
may be an effort to “take back” the day  
as a Hindu holiday by emphasizing a  
distinctively Hindu practice.
