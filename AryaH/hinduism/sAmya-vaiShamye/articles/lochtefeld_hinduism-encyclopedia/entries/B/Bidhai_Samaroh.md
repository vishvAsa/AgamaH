(“farewell celebration”) In northern  
India, the formal departure of a new  
bride for her marital home. This is a  
momentous event for several different  
reasons. A marriage is the start of a family, and through her marriage a young  
woman gets the opportunity to become  
a wife and mother; these roles are still  
seen as a woman’s highest fulfillment  
and happiness. Yet according to the traditional model of the Indian joint family,  
after marriage a woman goes to live with  
and becomes part of her husband’s family. Thus the act of seeing off a new bride  
carries bittersweet feelings—happiness  
for her marriage and hopes for her good  
fortune, but also the sense that things  
have irreversibly changed.
