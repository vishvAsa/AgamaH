(“elemental **lingas**”) A network of five  
southern Indian sacred sites (**tirthas**),  
four in the state of **Tamil Nadu** and one  
in **Andhra Pradesh**, all dedicated to the  
god **Shiva**. In each of these centers, the  
most sacred object is the linga, a pillarshaped form representing Shiva. What  
makes these sites unique is that the  
linga is supposedly composed of one of  
the five primordial **elements**. Thus the  
linga in **Tiruvannamalai** is formed from  
**fire**; the linga in **Jambukeshvar** is  
formed from **water**; the one in  
**Kanchipuram** is made from **earth**; that  
in **Kalahasti**, the sacred site in Andhra  
Pradesh, is formed from air; and the  
linga in **Chidambaram** is made from  
**space**. Between them, these five sites  
comprise a symbolic **cosmology** that  
encompasses all created things.
