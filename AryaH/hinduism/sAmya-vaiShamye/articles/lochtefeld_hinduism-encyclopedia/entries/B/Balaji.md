(2) Presiding **deity** of the Balaji temple  
in **Mehndipur** village, **Rajasthan**, who  
is considered a form of the monkeygod, **Hanuman**. As an infant, Hanuman  
is continually hungry, and one day he  
attempts to eat the **sun**. **Indra**, the king  
of the gods and ruler of **heaven**, is  
incensed at Hanuman’s action and  
strikes him with a thunderbolt, breaking his jaw (hanu). The **wind**-god, who  
is **Vayu**, Hanuman’s father, goes on  
strike to protest this punishment. Since  
in traditional Indian physiology, winds  
are considered responsible for all internal functions, including digestion, respiration, and elimination, Vayu’s strike  
means that no one can live a normal  
life. After a short time, the gods realize  
their predicament and beg Vayu for forgiveness; the deity is placated when  
each of the gods promises to give  
Hanuman a divine gift. By virtue of  
these gifts, Hanuman gains great  
power; not only is he immensely  
strong, but he is an expert healer,  
through both his skill in using herbs  
and natural medicines and his magical  
abilities to protect people from malevolent supernatural beings.  
These powers and healing qualities  
make Hanuman a strong protective  
deity, and he is often worshiped on days  
and at times deemed inauspicious or  
unfavorable. These protective attributes  
have made him enormously important  
in contemporary Hindu life despite  
his theoretically intermediate place in  
the divine pantheon, and these qualities  
are especially evident in his form as  
Balaji. His temple has gained regional  
prominence as a healing center for  
people possessed by malevolent spirits  
known as **bhuts** and **prets**. The  
exorcisms proceed in a quasi-judicial  
fashion, with the spirits being hauled  
into the divine court, tried, and  
banished from the sufferer with the  
underlying assumption that these rites  
succeed through Balaji’s irresistible  
healing powers. As Sudhir Kakar has  
masterfully shown, the language associated with **possession** and exorcism,  
when understood in the context of traditional Hindu culture, can be seen as  
a way of describing what modern  
psychiatrists might call the diagnosis  
and treatment of mental illness. See  
Sudhir Kakar, *Shamans*, *Mystics*, *and*  
*Doctors*, 1991.
