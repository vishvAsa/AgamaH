+++
(“time of **Brahma**”) The forty-eightminute period (**muhurta**) immediately  
before sunrise, which is thought to be  
the most auspicious time of the **day**.  
This **auspiciousness** makes it the  
best time for **worship**, meditation, or  
any type of religious practice; serious  
spiritual aspirants rise before it begins  
so that they may take full advantage  
of the time.
