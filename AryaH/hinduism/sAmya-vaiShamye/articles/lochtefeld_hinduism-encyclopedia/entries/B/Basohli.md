title = "Basohli"

+++
A town west of **Jammu** in the state of  
Jammu and **Kashmir**, close to the border of **Himachal Pradesh**. Although it is  
an insignificant place in modern times,  
in the seventeenth century, Basohli was  
the capital of a small kingdom in the  
**Shiwalik Hills**. It was in Basohli that the  
**Pahari** style of **miniature painting** first  
appeared. The Basohli version of that  
style is characterized by highly defined  
profiles, sharply flattened perspective,  
and broad bands of a single intense  
color for backgrounds. It serves as a  
transitional style between the so-called  
**Rajasthani** and the more developed  
techniques of the Pahari schools.
