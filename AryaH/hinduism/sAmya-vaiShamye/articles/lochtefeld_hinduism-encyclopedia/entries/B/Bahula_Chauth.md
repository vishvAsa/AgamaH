title = "Bahula Chauth"

+++
Religious festival celebrated on the  
fourth **day** (chauth) of the dark, or waning, half of the **lunar month** of  
**Bhadrapada**, the sixth month of the  
lunar **year**, which usually falls within  
August and September. On this day  
mothers perform duties for the welfare  
of their **sons**. They should refrain from  
all activity and from eating wheat or rice  
(the staple food grains). As a symbolic  
indication of allowing mothers to care  
for their children, on this day **cows** are  
not milked, and their calves are allowed  
to suckle as much as they want.

Bahula Chauth  
Such motherly concern for their sons  
reflects not only normal maternal  
instincts but the importance of male  
children in traditional Hindu life.  
According to the customary pattern, at  
least in northern India, **daughters** leave  
their natal homes to live with their  
husbands’ families, whereas sons bring  
their brides into the family home. One’s  
sons thus ensure the continuity of  
the family, in addition to taking care of  
the parents in their old age. Sons are  
also important because only they can  
perform the annual **shraddhas**, or  
memorial rites to the ancestors,  
although couples without any natural  
sons can satisfy this requirement  
through **adoption**.
