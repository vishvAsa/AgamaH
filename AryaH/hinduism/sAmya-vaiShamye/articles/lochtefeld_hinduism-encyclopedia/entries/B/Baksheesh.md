title = "Baksheesh"

+++
(from the Persian word *bakhshidan*,  
meaning “to give”) A gift, usually of  
money, given to facilitate service. This  
is usually paid in advance but can also  
be given after the fact. In some cases  
this is unabashed bribery, but most  
often it is simply a way to ensure continuing service and attention, or a gratuity for services already rendered.
