(“Meeting **Bharata**”) A particular scene  
in the dramas known as the **Ram Lila**,  
which are reenactments of the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics. This scene records the  
meeting between the god **Rama** and his  
brother Bharata, which takes place after  
Rama has been in exile for fourteen  
years, during which Bharata has faithfully served as ruler in his brother’s  
place. According to connoisseurs of the  
Ram Lila, this brief scene is filled with  
some of the most rapturous emotion in  
the play. Certainly there is the exaltation  
that the time of separation has ended,  
but the scene’s popularity also comes  
from the way it reflects certain basic cultural values. The brothers are considered the heart of the traditional Indian  
joint family since they remain at home  
their entire lives, whereas their sisters  
become part of their marital families.  
The eldest brother in every generation  
eventually becomes the head of the joint  
household, but he cannot succeed without the support and cooperation of his  
younger brothers. Rama and Bharata are  
thus models for the brothers in a traditional joint family: Rama for treating his  
younger brother with love and care, and  
Bharata for obediently carrying out his

older brother’s wishes for the good of the  
family as a whole.
