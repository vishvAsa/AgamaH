As with all bodily fluids, blood is considered ritually impure and a source of pollution upon contact. Blood is also  
deemed a “hot” and powerful substance,  
not only by virtue of its impurity  
(**ashaucha**), but also because of its connection with life. Witches are popularly  
seen as deriving their nourishment from  
human blood. This highlights both their  
malevolent character, since they can only  
live by destroying others, and also their  
marginal, antisocial quality, since they  
feed on a substance considered violently  
impure. In another context, blood from  
**animal sacrifice** is often offered to **village deities** or to certain powerful and  
terrifying forms of the **Goddess**. Any  
**deities** taking blood sacrifice are considered “hot,” meaning that they are powerful enough to grant favors to devotees but  
also marginal, potentially dangerous,
