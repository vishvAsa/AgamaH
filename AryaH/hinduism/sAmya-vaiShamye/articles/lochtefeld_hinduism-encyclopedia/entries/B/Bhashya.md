(“commentary”) Any commentary,  
whether on a text or an oral teaching.  
The need for commentary was presupposed in most texts on Hindu **philosophy** as well as in the secret ritual  
tradition known as **tantra**. Philosophical  
works were often nothing more than  
collections of brief aphorisms, which  
were intentionally kept short to  
facilitate memorization but which  
clearly needed further explanation. In  
the case of tantra, commentary was  
essential because the texts were written  
using coded language to conceal their  
contents from the uninitiated. This  
may have been in the form known as  
**sandhabhasha**, which often uses  
**erotic** language to indicate religious  
practice, or it may simply have been  
a technical language in which  
everyday words had contextual meanings.
