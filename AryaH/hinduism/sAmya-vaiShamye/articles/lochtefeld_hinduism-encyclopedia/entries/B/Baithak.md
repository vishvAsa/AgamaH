title = "Baithak"

+++
(“seat”) In the **Vaishnava** sect  
known as the **Pushti Marg**, a religious community whose members  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Krishna**, the baithaks are a group of  
108 sacred sites (**tirthas**). Each site  
is somehow associated with the life  
and activities of the philosopher  
**Vallabhacharya**, the Pushti Marg’s  
founder. Most of these baithaks are  
in well-established sacred areas that  
were considered holy long before  
Vallabhacharya’s time, but the charter story for each baithak records  
some activity of the philosopher in  
that particular place, to further  
sanctify it for his followers. These  
baithaks create a sectarian network  
within the existing pilgrimage  
81  
Baithak  
places and imbue each one with  
additional significance for the  
Pushti Marg.
