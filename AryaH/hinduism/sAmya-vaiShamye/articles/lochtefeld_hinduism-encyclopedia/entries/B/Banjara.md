The model for traditional Indian society  
was a collection of **endogamous** subgroups known as **jatis** (“birth”). These  
jatis were organized (and their social  
status determined) by the group’s hereditary occupation. In traditional northern  
Indian society, the Banjaras were a jati  
whose hereditary occupation was driving pack **animals**, either as peddlers  
selling retail goods to people in more  
remote places or as transporters  
conveying commodities from one seller  
to another. They appear in poems by  
some of the **bhakti** (devotional) poets,  
particularly by **Ravidas**, as a symbol of  
human heedlessness or as a person who  
never stops moving to reflect on where  
he has been.
