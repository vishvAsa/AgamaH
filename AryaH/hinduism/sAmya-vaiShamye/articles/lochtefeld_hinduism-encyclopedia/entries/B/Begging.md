title = "Begging"

+++
One of the recognized means of livelihood in traditional Hindu society that is  
a sign of either very low or very high

Basohli  
status, depending on the circumstances.  
Some beggars are simply people who are  
desperately poor, disabled, or unable to  
provide for themselves and their families and who must depend upon gifts  
(**dana**) to survive. Such beggars have  
extremely low social status, although  
they may make a fairly decent living,  
particularly if they live in a favorable  
environment such as a pilgrimage place  
(**tirtha**), where giving gifts is a common  
religious act. Aside from all of the obvious disadvantages—low social status, an  
uncertain income, and having to endure  
scorn and verbal abuse—these beggars  
also suffer the stigma of living on  
charity, rather than earning an income.  
This is karmically undesirable since  
giving gifts is one of the methods by  
which people get rid of **inauspiciousness**,  
which is transferred to the receiver  
along with the gift. In many cases such a  
beggar is considered nothing more  
than an instrument to be used, and the  
most common word for such a person is  
*patra* (“vessel”).  
Some **ascetics** also make their living  
by begging but fall into a completely different category. In the ideal case, these  
are people who have given up all visible  
means of support as part of an effort to  
renounce the world; this differentiates  
them from the poor, who are part of  
ordinary society, albeit at the lowest  
level. There is general social approval for  
supporting ascetics, at least the ones  
who are considered genuine spiritual  
seekers, and doing so is widely seen as a  
source of religious merit. Although it is  
sometimes difficult to distinguish poorer  
ascetics from ordinary beggars, in the  
case of the most respected ascetics the  
distinction is very clear. Such respected  
ascetics confer status on people by  
accepting their gifts, and consequently  
they tend to screen the donors and their  
motives very carefully to protect their  
reputations. See also **karma**.
