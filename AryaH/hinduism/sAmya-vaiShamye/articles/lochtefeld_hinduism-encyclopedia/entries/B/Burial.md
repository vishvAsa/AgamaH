title = "Burial"

Although **cremation** is the most common means by which Hindus dispose of  
**corpses**, occasionally bodies are buried.  
One such case is with the bodies of very  
young children, as if it is recognized that  
they never developed into real individuals. The only other people usually buried  
are **ascetics**, for which there are varying  
interpretations. One idea is that they are  
not actually dead but in a state of deep  
meditation (**samadhi**). In such cases the  
ascetic is often buried in a sitting posture  
because he is considered still present.  
Another reason for burying ascetics may  
reflect the general assumption that  
renouncing the world had made them  
“dead” to it, making further ceremonies  
unnecessary. Indeed, one part of some  
ascetic **initiations** is to perform one’s  
own funeral rites. Burial is often reserved  
for ascetics with disciples who will keep  
their graves as shrines. Those who are not  
buried are usually weighted down with  
rocks and thrown into bodies of water.
