title = "Bhagabhadra"

+++
Monarch in the Sunga dynasty, which  
was centered in the **Malwa** region in the  
western part of the state of **Madhya**  
**Pradesh**, in the centuries following the  
decline of the **Maurya dynasty** just  
before the turn of the common era.  
Despite the fragmentation of the  
Maurya state, rulers seem to have maintained contact with the Greek-speaking  
kingdoms to the west, since a pillar  
**inscription** records that Bhagabhadra  
received an ambassador named  
Heliodorus from the king of Takshasila,  
in modern Pakistan.
