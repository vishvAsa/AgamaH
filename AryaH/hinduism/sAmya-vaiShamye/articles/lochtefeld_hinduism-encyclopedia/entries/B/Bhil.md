The name of a tribal (**adivasi**) group  
found in greatest numbers in the  
**Vindhya Mountains**, in the eastern part  
of the state of **Madhya Pradesh**. They  
are historically associated with the forest, particularly with hunting and gathering honey. As with many tribal groups,  
their homeland is often in marginal  
lands, and most of them are quite poor.
