title = "Bhairava"

+++
(“terrible”) A wrathful and powerful  
divine attendant of the god **Shiva** who is  
often identified as a form of Shiva himself. According to the **Shiva Purana**, a  
sectarian scripture, Bhairava is produced  
when the god **Brahma** insults Shiva, and  
Shiva’s rage takes concrete form as  
Bhairava. After his **birth**, Bhairava’s first  
act is to cut off one of Brahma’s heads—  
the one whose mouth has uttered the  
insult—thus leaving the god with four  
remaining heads. Since Brahma is considered a **brahmin** priest, this act makes  
Bhairava guilty of brahmin murder, the  
most serious of the **four great crimes**  
(**mahapataka**). As a sign of the enormity  
of his act, Brahma’s severed head sticks  
to Bhairava’s hand; as penance  
(**prayashchitta**) Bhairava has to wander  
the countryside as a beggar, displaying  
Brahma’s severed head as a continual  
advertisement of his crime. In his travels  
Bhairava visits many pilgrimage places  
(**tirtha**), but none of them have the  
power to cleanse him from the sin of  
brahmin murder. He finally obtains a  
pardon in the city of **Benares**, at a site  
named **Kapalamochana** (“releasing the  
skull”). As soon as Bhairava bathes there,  
Brahma’s head falls from his hand into  
the **Ganges**—a sign that his crime had  
been expiated.  
Although often seen as Shiva’s attendant, Bhairava is important in several  
different contexts. He is often portrayed  
as the consort of powerful, independent  
**goddesses** such as **Durga** and **Kali**,  
although he is subordinate to them,  
befitting their status as supreme **deities**.  
Bhairava’s associations with wrath and  
power have made him popular with  
practitioners of the secret ritual tradition  
known as **tantra**, who may invoke him  
for **magic** powers or other favors.  
Bhairava is also popular with the **Naga**  
class of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, **ascetic**  
devotees (**bhakta**) of Shiva who formerly  
made their living as traders and mercenary soldiers; this group sees him as a  
divine image of themselves. Some of the  
ambivalence associated with Bhairava is  
symbolized by his **animal** vehicle, the  
**dog**, which in Hindu culture is almost  
invariably a scavenger and considered  
highly impure.
