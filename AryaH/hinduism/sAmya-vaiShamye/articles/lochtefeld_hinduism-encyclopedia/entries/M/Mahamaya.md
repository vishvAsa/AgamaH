(“[she whose] power of illusion is great”)  
Epithet of the **Goddess** in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest and most  
important textual source for the notion  
that God is female. This epithet reflects  
her position as the sole and supreme  
power in the universe, wielding the  
power of illusion that obscures this fact  
from human awareness. See **Goddess**.
