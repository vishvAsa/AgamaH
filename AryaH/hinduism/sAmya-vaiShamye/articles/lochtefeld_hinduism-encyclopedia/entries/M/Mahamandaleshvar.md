(“Great Lord of the Region”) Term of  
respect given to a **Mandaleshvar** when  
one of his disciples is chosen a  
Mandaleshvar while the preceptor is still  
living. Mandaleshvars are the learned  
ascetics who lead the **Naga akharas** of  
the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, a practice that  
began in the nineteenth century. The  
Dashanami Nagas are renunciant  
ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva** and who formerly made their  
living as traders and mercenary soldiers. Their rough-and-ready qualities  
made them effective soldiers, but gave  
them little preparation for formal  
argument with Christian missionaries.  
Mandaleshvars were chosen from  
among the more learned **Paramahamsa**  
ascetics, so that the latter could provide  
a more coherent and telling opposition;  
he also serves as the Nagas’ teacher and  
spiritual adviser. The enshrinement of  
403  
Mahamandaleshvar  
a Mandaleshvar’s disciple is thus seen as  
boosting his teacher’s prestige to an  
even more rarefied state.
