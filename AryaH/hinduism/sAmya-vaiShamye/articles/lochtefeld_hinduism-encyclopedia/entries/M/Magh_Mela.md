title = "Magh Mela"

+++
Religious festival celebrated every **year**  
during the entire **lunar month** of **Magh**  
(Januaryâ€“February) in the city of  
**Allahabad**. According to the Hindu **festival calendar**, Magh is one of the  
months in which bathing (**snana**) in  
sacred rivers is highly praised. This is  
particularly significant because  
Allahabad lies at the confluence of two  
sacred rivers, the **Ganges** and the  
**Yamuna River**. During this month, pilgrims set up an encampment at the confluence, which becomes a bustling  
religious center. During their stay, pilgrims  
398  
Madya  
live a strict and disciplined religious life.  
This includes a morning bath, followed  
by gift-giving (**dana**) and **worship**;  
**eating** a restricted diet, and evenings  
spent singing hymns (**kirtan**) and  
listening to religious discourses. Some  
pilgrims even take a strict vow, known as  
**kalpavas**, to remain there for the entire  
month, a vow which also entails a strict  
**ascetic** lifestyle. More than a million pilgrims attend this festival. Every twelfth  
year, when the Magh Mela becomes the  
Allahabad **Kumbha Mela**, attendance  
increases. In 1989 an estimated fifteen  
million pilgrims came for a single day,  
with millions more coming during the  
rest of the month.
