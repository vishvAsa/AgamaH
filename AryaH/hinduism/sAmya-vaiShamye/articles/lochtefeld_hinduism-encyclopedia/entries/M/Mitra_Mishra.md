title = "Mitra Mishra"

+++
(early 17th c.) Author of the **Viramitrodaya**,  
a compendium of Hindu lore. The  
*Viramitrodaya* is an example of a class of  
440  
Mitakshara  
commentarial literature known as  
**nibandhas** (“collections”). The compilers of the nibandhas culled references  
on a particular theme from the **Vedas**,  
**dharma literature**, **puranas**, and other  
authoritative religious texts, placing  
these excerpts into a single volume.  
Each of the *Viramitrodaya*’s twenty-two  
sections is devoted to a particular aspect  
of Hindu life, such as daily practice,  
**worship**, gift-giving (**dana**), vows, pilgrimage, penances (**prayashchitta**),  
purification, death rites (**antyeshthi**  
**samskara**), and law; the final section is  
devoted to final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). In addition to citing the  
relevant scriptural passages, Mitra  
Mishra also provides extensive commentary of his own. His work became  
an important source for later legal interpretation, particularly in eastern India.
