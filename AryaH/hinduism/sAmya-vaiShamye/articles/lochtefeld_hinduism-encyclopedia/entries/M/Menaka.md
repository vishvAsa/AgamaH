title = "Menaka"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a beautiful celestial  
maiden (**apsara**), who is a minion of  
**Indra**, the king of the gods. Menaka’s  
primary function is to seduce sages  
threatening to replace Indra as the ruler  
of **heaven**. In traditional Indian culture,  
**semen** is seen as the concentrated  
essence of a man’s vital energies; **celibacy**  
is a means to conserve and retain these  
energies. Menaka’s powers of attraction  
are used to seduce these **ascetics**,  
diminishing their accumulated spiritual  
powers. Her most notable partner is the  
sage **Vishvamitra**, who is twice smitten  
by her charms. Their first liaison  
results in the **birth** of the maiden  
**Shakuntala**, celebrated in the drama  
**Abhijnanashakuntala**, written by the  
poet **Kalidasa**. During their second liaison, Vishvamitra lives with Menaka for  
ten years, before leaving her for renunciant life in the forest.
