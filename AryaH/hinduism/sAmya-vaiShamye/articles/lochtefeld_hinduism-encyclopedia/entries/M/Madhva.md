(1197–1276) Philosopher and founder of  
the **Dvaita Vedanta** philosophical  
school, whose long life was largely spent  
in **Udupi**, a small town near the **Malabar**  
coast in the state of **Karnataka**.  
Madhva’s basic philosophy was the utter  
transcendence of God. This conviction  
led him to develop the theory of  
dualism, which posits a qualitative  
difference between God in his  
transcendence and the corruptions of  
material things. According to Madhva,  
God is completely different from  
humans and the material world, even  
though both came from God and  
depend on Him for their continuing  
existence. Madhva differed sharply  
from the major school, **Advaita**  
**Vedanta**, which upheld the theory of  
monism—the belief that a single  
Ultimate Reality (called **Brahman**) lies  
behind all things, which are merely  
differing forms of this single reality.  
Whereas Advaita collapses all things  
into one thing, Madhva firmly insists  
on maintaining differences.  
Madhva’s emphasis on dualism led  
him to articulate these differences,  
known as the “fivefold difference”: the  
difference between God and Self,  
between God and the world, between  
individual Selves, between Selves and  
matter, and between individual material  
things. Even though each Self contains  
an aspect of God, fundamental difference gives the Self only limited capacity  
for religious life. This limited power  
means that final liberation of the soul  
comes solely through the **grace** of God,  
who alone has the power to effect it.  
Final liberation was conceived both as  
freedom from rebirth and as the soul’s  
opportunity to remain in the divine  
presence forever.
