title = "Mahipati"

+++
(1715â€“1790) Writer and hagiographer of  
the devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saints, particularly those saints connected with the  
**Varkari Panth**, to which Mahipati himself belonged. The Varkari Panth is a religious community centered around the  
**worship** of the Hindu god **Vithoba**,  
whose temple at **Pandharpur** is in  
the modern state of **Maharashtra**.  
According to tradition, Mahipati was a  
civil servant in his home town. One day  
he was summoned to his job without  
being able to finish his daily worship.  
Mahipati did the business at hand, but  
then resigned his position, vowing never  
to use his pen except in the service of  
the saints. Mahipati freely admitted that  
much of his material on the saints was  
drawn from earlier works, particularly  
the **Bhaktamal** written by the poetsaint **Nabhadas**. As with Nabhadas, he  
presents each of his subjects as a paradigm of devotion; the stories reinforce  
and validate the power of devotion to  
overcome all obstacles. His major  
works are the **Bhaktavijaya** and the  
**Bhaktililamrta**; the former has been  
translated by Justin E. Abbott and  
Narhar R. Godbole as *Stories of Indian*
