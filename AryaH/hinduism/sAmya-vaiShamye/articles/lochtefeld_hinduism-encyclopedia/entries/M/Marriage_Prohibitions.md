title = "Marriage Prohibitions"

+++
As in other cultures, Hindus have welldefined rules and prohibitions regarding whom one should and should not  
marry—marriages should be **endogamous**, that is, between members of the  
same social subgroup (in this case, the  
**jati**). Within this larger community, it is  
generally accepted that the bride and  
groom should not come from the same  
**gotra** or the same **pravara**—both mythic  
lineages detailing relationships with  
ancient sages. The other strong prohibition was on marrying those with whom  
one had a **sapinda** relationship—common ancestry. According to one wellknown code of law, the **Mitakshara**, the  
sapinda relationship ceases after the  
seventh generation on the father’s  
side, and the fifth generation on the  
mother’s. People with common  
ancestors beyond those boundaries may  
contract a valid marriage.  
This sapinda formula was routinely  
ignored, particularly in parts of  
southern India, where marrying one’s  
maternal uncle’s daughter was not  
only permitted, but considered commendable. While some of the texts in  
the **dharma literature** condemn the  
practice as an abomination, others  
note that this is a practice peculiar to  
the south, where it is permitted only  
as part of the family’s customary  
practice (**kulachara**).  
There is a long history for crosscousin marriage in southern India; it is a  
common practice even today. Among  
southern Indian brahmins, there is  
some speculation that their relatively  
small population—about four percent  
of the total—made it impossible to find  
**brahmin** spouses under the strict criteria. Given the competing imperatives to  
marry other brahmins and to observe  
the lineage restrictions, this custom was  
deemed less important.
