title = "Madhurya (“Honeyed”) Bhava"

+++
The second of the five **modes of devotion** to God that were articulated by  
**Rupa Goswami**, a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Krishna** and a follower of the  
Bengali saint **Chaitanya**. Rupa used  
human relationships to describe the  
connection between devotee and **deity**.  
The five modes showed growing emotional intensity, from the peaceful  
(**shanta**) sense that comes from realizing one’s complete identity with  
**Brahman** or Ultimate Reality, to conceiving of God as one’s master, friend,  
child, or lover. The Madhurya Bhava is  
the last and most intense of the five  
modes of devotion. In this mode, devotees consider the relationship between  
themselves and the deity as that of lover  
and beloved. This mode appeared most  
prominently with regard to the god  
Krishna (in which the model devotees  
were the cowherd women of **Braj**), and  
395  
Madhurya (“Honeyed”) Bhava  
**Radha** (who is a symbol for the human  
soul.) This particular mode is seen as the  
most intense and demanding because of  
its emotional closeness. For that same  
reason, it is also seen as the sweetest.
