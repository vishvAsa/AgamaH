title = "Mueller, F Max"

+++
(1823–1900) Linguist, translator, editor,  
and ardent student of comparative  
religion and mythology. Mueller was  
an important figure in nineteenthcentury intellectual history. His primary  
contribution was introducing Indian  
ideas to Western audiences by translating primary texts into the *Sacred Books*  
*of the East* series. His work allowed  
Hindu and other Asian religious  
traditions to show the sophisticated  
thought often concealed by popular  
religious practice. Mueller began  
developing a “science of religion”—  
a field of knowledge that could be  
pursued as any other. As a professor  
at Oxford, he helped to change scholarly  
views on Hinduism and other Asian  
religions, moving Western minds from  
simply dismissing them as polytheistic  
“idolatry” to taking them seriously

the world.
