Traditional Indian society was a collection of **endogamous** subgroups (in  
which marriage is decreed by law to  
occur only between members of the  
same group) known as **jatis** (“birth”).  
The jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group held a monopoly. In traditional  
northern Indian society, the Malis’  
hereditary occupation was tending gardens, growing flowers, and making  
flower garlands (**mala**).
