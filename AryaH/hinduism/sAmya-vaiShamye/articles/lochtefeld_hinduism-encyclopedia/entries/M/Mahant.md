title = "Mahant"

+++
(“great”) Honorific title given to an  
**ascetic** who is the leader of a monastery.  
Mahants are chosen by their predecessors and designate their successors.  
While they are living, they have virtually  
total control over the monastery and  
its assets, even though they do not  
own them. In any given ascetic  
establishment, the mahant has very  
high status, since he is the absolute ruler  
of his small domain.
