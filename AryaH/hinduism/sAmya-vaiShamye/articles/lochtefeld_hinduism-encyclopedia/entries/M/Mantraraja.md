(“king of mantras”) Name given to a  
particular eight-syllable **mantra** associated with the god **Vishnu**, in which  
he is addressed as **Narayana**. The  
mantra itself is “**Om** Namo Narayana”  
(“Om, homage to Narayana”). This  
mantra is particularly important in  
the **Shrivaishnava** religious community, which developed in southern  
India in the twelfth century. The  
mantra is especially associated with  
the community’s founder, **Ramanuja**.  
Faithful recitation of this mantra is  
said to bestow residence in Vishnu’s  
heavenly abode, **Vaikuntha**.
