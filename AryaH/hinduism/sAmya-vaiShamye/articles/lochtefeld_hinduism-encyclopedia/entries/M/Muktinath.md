title = "Muktinath"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) at the  
headwaters of the Kali Gandaki River in  
**Nepal**; the temple sits at nearly 13,000  
feet at the foot of Annapurna, one of the  
highest mountains in Nepal. Muktinath  
is a sacred site to both Hindus and  
Buddhists; each has a temple there. The  
Buddhist temple is built over a vent of  
natural gas, which produces a flame  
when lit. The Hindu temple, dedicated  
to the god **Vishnu**, is built over a natural  
spring that is channelled outside the  
temple through 108 spouts shaped like  
heads of **cows**. The Kali Gandaki River is  
also religiously important because the  
river bed is one of the major sites of fossilized black **ammonite**. Known as the  
**shalagram**, this ammonite is considered  
a self-manifestation (**svayambhu**) form  
of Vishnu.
