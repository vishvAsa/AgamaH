title = "Meat Eating"

+++
An accepted part of the diet for most  
Hindus. A 1996 poll of urban Hindus  
found that only a quarter of the respondents were vegetarians. However, this  
figure may be higher in villages, where  
people tend to be more traditional and  
conservative. As the product of a dead  
**animal**, meat is seen as impure, and  
those who are concerned about religious **purity** (particularly **brahmins**)  
will generally avoid it for that reason.  
Even nonvegetarians recognize a hierarchy of animal foods. Some people will  
eat only eggs; others will also eat chicken  
and/or fish, whereas others will also eat  
mutton. Pork is generally avoided by all  
but the lowest-status people; pigs are  
considered scavengers and deemed  
unclean. Beef is taboo for religious  
reasons, except for a very small Hindu  
community in southern India. Even  
those who eat meat generally do not eat  
it in large quantities. Because of its  
relatively high cost, it is generally  
prepared as one dish among many,  
rather than the central part of the meal.
