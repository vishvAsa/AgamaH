title = "Marriage, Eight Classical Forms"

+++
**Dharma literature** (texts prescribing  
rules for correct human behavior and  
ideal social life) recognizes eight forms  
of marriage: **Brahma**, **Daiva**, **Arsha**,  
**Prajapatya**, **Asura**, **Gandharva**,  
**Rakshasa**, and **Paishacha**. The first four  
forms were approved (**prashasta**). In  
each case, the father of the bride was  
responsible for arranging the marriage:  
in the Brahma form, he gave his **daughter** as a gift without conditions; in the  
Daiva form, she was given as a sacrificial  
fee; in the Arsha form, in exchange for a  
pair of cattle for **sacrifice**; and in the  
Prajapatya form, with the condition that  
the husband and wife perform their  
duties together.  
The other four forms were considered reprehensible forms of marriage  
(**aprashasta**). Two of these four were  
tolerated: the Asura form, in which  
the bride was exchanged for money,  
and the Gandharva form, in which bride  
and groom plighted their troth by  
mutual consent—that is, through consensual sexual intercourse. The final  
two forms were strictly forbidden:  
Rakshasa, in which the bride was  
forcibly abducted; and Paishacha, in  
which a man took sexual advantage of a  
woman who was insentient—the result  
of drunkenness, a deep sleep, or drugging. It is interesting to note that all of  
these forms were deemed to create a  
valid marriage—even the two that were  
forbidden. The aim in sanctioning  
such forbidden marriages was not to  
encourage such actions, but to give  
the woman the legal status of a wife.  
In contemporary times most of these  
forms of marriage are no longer  
practiced except for the Brahma  
marriage, which carries the highest  
status, and the Asura marriage. For  
further information see Pandurang  
Vaman Kane (trans.), *A History of*  
*Dharmasastra*, 1968; and Raj Bali  
Pandey, *Hindu Samskaras*, 1969. Despite  
their age, they remain the best sources for  
traditional Hindu religious rites.
