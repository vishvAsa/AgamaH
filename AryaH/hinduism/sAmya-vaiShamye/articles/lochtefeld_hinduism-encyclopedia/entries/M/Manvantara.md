Manvantara is the name of an era in one  
instance of **cosmic time**. According to  
traditional belief, time has neither  
beginning nor end but alternates  
between cycles of creation and activity,  
followed by cessation and quietude.  
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion  
years; the active phase is known as  
the **Day of Brahma** and the quiet phase  
is known as the Night of Brahma. In  
one instance of cosmic time, each  
Day of Brahma is divided into fourteen  
equal periods, each ruled by one of  
the fourteen Manus. Manus are celebrated as the sovereigns of the **earth**  
and are perceived as semidivine beings  
who are the progenitors of the human  
race. Currently we are living in the  
seventh age, with seven yet to come.  
The **Manu** of this present age,  
Vaivasvata, was saved from **pralaya**  
(universal destruction) by **Vishnu** in his  
form as the **Fish avatar**. Vaivasvata is  
regarded as the progenitor of the **Solar**  
**Line** of Kings.
