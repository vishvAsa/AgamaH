(“Great commentary”) A commentary  
on the **Ashtadhyayi** of **Panini**, written  
by **Patanjali**, the grammarian, in the  
second century B.C.E. Panini’s text gives a  
complete and accurate description of all  
the forms of the **Sanskrit** language and  
set the standard for the language after  
401  
Mahabhashya  
his time. Although the *Ashtadhyayi* is  
considered a masterpiece, it appears to  
invite more detailed commentary  
because it is written in a series of aphorisms or **sutra**. Each of these aphorisms  
provides the basis for those which follow. Panini’s ultimate purpose is to give  
a complete account of the language in  
the briefest possible space. Aside from  
expanding and expounding Panini’s  
grammar, Patanjali also gives some useful information of his own. The  
*Mahabhashya* contains the earliest  
known reference to the Greeks.
