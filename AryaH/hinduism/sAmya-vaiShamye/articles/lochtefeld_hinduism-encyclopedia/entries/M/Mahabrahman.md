title = "Mahabrahman"

+++
(“Great **Brahman**”) In traditional Indian  
society, a debased class of brahmins  
who officiate at rites for the dead, especially at the rites performed immediately  
after death. In many of these rites the  
Mahabrahman is identified with the  
deceased person and is fed and given  
gifts that are intended to help satisfy the  
soul of the deceased. These acts are seen  
as transferring the **inauspiciousness** of  
death from the family to the  
Mahabrahman. Such constant association with death and its inauspicious  
qualities is seen as a highly undesirable  
way to make a living; Mahabrahmans  
have extremely low social status, despite  
being brahmins by birth. As compensation for taking on such inauspiciousness, Mahabrahmans usually demand  
high payment from a family. For further

Funeral Priests,” in *Man*, Vol. 15, 1980.
