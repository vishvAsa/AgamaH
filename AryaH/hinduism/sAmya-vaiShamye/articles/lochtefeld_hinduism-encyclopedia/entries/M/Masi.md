Eleventh month in the **Tamil year**, corresponding to the northern Indian  
month of Kumbha (the zodiacal sign  
of Aquarius), usually falling within  
February and March. The existence of  
several different calendars is a sign of  
the continuing importance of regional  
cultural patterns. One way that the  
Tamils retain their culture is by preserving their traditional **calendar**. Tamil  
is one of the few regional languages  
in India with an ancient, wellestablished literary tradition. See also  
**Tamil months**, **Tamil Nadu**, and  
**Tamil language**.
