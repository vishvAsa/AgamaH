title = "Manthara"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Manthara is the  
hunchbacked maid of King **Dasharatha’s**  
wife, **Kaikeyi**. Manthara’s whisperings  
against Dasharatha’s son **Rama**, the  
god-king who is the epic’s protagonist,  
slowly poisons Kaikeyi’s mind. She  
succeeds in convincing the queen that  
after Rama has been crowned  
Dasharatha’s heir, she and her son  
**Bharata** will be little better than  
slaves, if they are allowed to live at all.  
Goaded by Manthara, Kaikeyi decides  
to demand two boons Dasharatha  
gave her years before. With the first  
boon she dictates that Rama be sent in  
exile to the forest for fourteen years,  
and with the second she stipulates  
that her son Bharata be crowned heir  
in Rama’s place.  
The epic’s oldest version, the  
*Ramayana* of **Valmiki**, paints Manthara  
as a genuine villain. There is little  
explanation for her actions, although  
given the belief in **karma**, her physical  
disabilities would have been seen as  
revealing moral and spiritual deformity  
as well. In the *Ramayana,* written by  
the poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623?),  
Manthara’s behavior is ultimately attributed to the gods who send the **goddess**  
**Saraswati** to confound Manthara’s mind,  
setting in motion the chain of events  
leading to the **demon Ravana’s** death. In  
typical fashion, Tulsidas puts a more  
charitable spin on the event, relating it  
to Rama’s ultimate purpose for being  
born on earth.
