title = "Mandaleshvar"

+++
(“Lord of the Region”) Term of respect  
for the ascetics chosen to head the **Naga**  
class of the **Dashanami Sanyasis** in  
their disputations with Christian missionaries. The Dashanami Nagas are  
groups of renunciant ascetics who are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva** and who formerly made their living as traders and  
mercenary soldiers. Their rough-andready qualities made them effective soldiers but gave them little preparation for  
formal argument. The Mandaleshvars  
were chosen by the Nagas from among  
the more learned **Paramahamsa**  
ascetics, providing a more coherent and  
telling opposition to Christian missionaries. An **ascetic** who becomes a  
Mandaleshvar becomes the spiritual  
adviser and the teacher of the  
Dashanami Naga members of the  
**akhara**, who deem him a spiritual  
preceptor as much as their own gurus.
