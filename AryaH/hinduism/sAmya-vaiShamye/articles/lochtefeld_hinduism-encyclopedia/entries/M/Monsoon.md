title = "Monsoon"

+++
A season of torrential rains, whose name  
comes from an Arabic word meaning  
“season” (mausam). The monsoon is  
preceded by a period of intense heat;  
daily temperatures go over one hundred  
degrees Fahrenheit. As the hot air rises,  
it draws in a vast current of moistureladen air from the coastal regions of  
southern India. The monsoon is one of  
the year’s three major **seasons** and is a  
vital part of people’s daily lives. Because  
much of India’s farmland is not irrigated,  
the monsoon rains are vital to agriculture. The coming of the monsoon is  
much awaited in real life; it also has a  
prominent place in Indian culture. One  
image of the monsoon comes from love  
poetry, in which a woman is anxiously  
scanning the sky, watching the clouds  
roll up as she awaits her returning  
beloved. In earlier times the rains made  
travel almost impossible, making it a  
bitter time for separated lovers but a  
444  
Mokshada Ekadashi  
sweet and happy time for united couples.  
The poet **Kalidasa’s** epic **Meghaduta**  
describes a man exiled in southern  
India, who addresses one of the monsoon clouds, giving it a message to convey to his beloved. The monsoon rains  
are also associated with the god  
**Krishna**. His dark skin color is compared to a rain cloud. Also, his birthday  
is celebrated at the end of the rainy  
season, and his divine persona appropriates the image of the lover associated  
with the rains.
