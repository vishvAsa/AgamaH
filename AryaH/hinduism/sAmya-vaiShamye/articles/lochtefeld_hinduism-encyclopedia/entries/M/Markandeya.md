title = "Markandeya"

+++
A sage in Hindu mythology. Markandeya  
is best-known for two mythic exploits,  
one of which is associated with the god  
**Shiva** and the other with the god  
**Vishnu**. According to tradition,  
Markandeya is a very intelligent and  
religious boy who is devoted to Shiva  
and proficient in all the branches of  
learning. This seemingly unlimited  
potential is even more poignant because  
he learns that he is fated to die at  
sixteen. Shortly before his sixteenth  
birthday, Markandeya begins to **worship** Shiva with even greater fervor.  
Because of the boy’s accumulated religious merits, the servants of **Yama**, the  
god of death, cannot get near him. So  
Yama himself has to go for Markandeya.  
When Yama throws his noose over  
Markandeya to draw out the boy’s soul,  
it also loops over the statue of Shiva to  
which Markandeya is clinging. Shiva  
arises from the image and kills Yama,  
although he later relents and brings him  
back to life.  
Markandeya’s other mythic exploit is  
a vision of **pralaya**, the universal dissolution of the cosmos. One evening as he  
is meditating, the sky grows dark, the  
wind rises, and rain falls until the earth  
is inundated with water. Markandeya is  
swept this way and that, until he comes  
to an enormous banyan tree with an  
infant sitting in it. Markandeya is drawn  
to the child and sees that the entire universe is inside this infant boy. He wanders inside the child for some time until  
he falls out of the child’s mouth; then he  
sees the infant and the banyan tree  
again. Markandeya realizes that the  
infant is Vishnu, but before he can reach  
him again, the child has disappeared.
