title = "Mars"

+++
In Hindu astrology (**jyotisha**), a **planet**  
associated with activity, war, and misfortune. Due to these associations, Mars  
is considered a strong yet malignant  
planetary force. **Tuesday,** the **day** of the  
**week** ruled by Mars, is considered an  
inauspicious day, a day on which people  
often perform **rites of protection** to  
safeguard themselves from Marsâ€™s baleful influence.
