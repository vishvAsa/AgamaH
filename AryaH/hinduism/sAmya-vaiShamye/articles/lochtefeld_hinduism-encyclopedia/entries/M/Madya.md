(“wine”) In the secret ritually-based religious practice known as **tantra**, wine is  
the first of the Five Forbidden Things  
(**panchamakara**). Since “respectable”  
Hindu society strongly condemns the  
consumption of alcoholic beverages, its  
ritual use in tantra must be understood  
in the larger tantric context. One of the  
most basic tantric assumptions is the  
ultimate unity of everything that exists.  
From a tantric perspective, to affirm that  
the entire universe is one principle  
means that the adept must reject all  
concepts based on dualistic thinking.  
One way to do this is to partake of the  
“Five Forbidden Things,” consciously  
breaking the societal norms forbidding  
the consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and illicit sexuality—  
making sacred that which is normally  
forbidden. Tantric adepts cite such ritual  
use of forbidden things as proof that  
their practice involves a more exclusive  
qualification (**adhikara**), and is thus  
superior to common practice. In its ritual  
use—which is usually in very small  
quantities—the intoxication produced  
by wine is an approximation of the bliss  
of realization. For further information see
