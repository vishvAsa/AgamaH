title = "Mohini Attam"

+++
The youngest form of classical Indian  
**dance**, found mainly in the modern  
state of **Kerala**. Mohini Attam was developed in the early eighteenth century  
at the royal court in Travancore in  
Kerala. This style of dance shows traits of  
both **Bharatanatyam** and **Kathakali**, a  
Keralan dance form. The dance is  
named after the mythical enchantress  
**Mohini** and projects a coquettish  
sensuality. Some of the danceâ€™s physical  
poses are taken from Bharatanatyam,  
whereas the stylized hand gestures  
(**mudras**) come largely from Kathakali.
