(“pavilion”) The mandapa is an architectural feature found in the **Khajuraho**  
variation of the **Nagara** architectural  
style. Usually found in northern India,  
the Nagara style emphasizes verticality,  
with the whole temple building culminating in a single highest point. In the  
Khajuraho style, the entire structure  
gradually leads up to the central tower,  
as foothills lead up to the mountains,  
with the peak of this central tower  
directly over the temple’s primary

name for a hall of the temple that is usually  
between the entrance hall (**ardhamandapa**) and the main hall (**mahamandapa**).
