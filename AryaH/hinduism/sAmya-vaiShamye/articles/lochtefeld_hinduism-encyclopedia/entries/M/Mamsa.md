(“meat”) In the secret ritually-based religious practice known as **tantra**, meat is  
the third of the Five Forbidden Things  
(**panchamakara**); the panchamakara  
are used in their actual forms in “left  
hand” (**vamachara**) tantric ritual,  
whereas they are represented by symbolic substitutes in “right hand” (**dakshinachara**) tantric ritual. “Respectable”  
Hindu society strongly condemns the  
consumption of nonvegetarian food; its  
ritual use therefore must be seen in the  
larger tantric context. One of the most  
pervasive tantric assumptions is the  
ultimate unity of everything that exists.  
From a tantric perspective, to affirm that  
the entire universe is one principle  
means that the adept must reject  
all concepts based on dualistic  
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”  
provide a ritual means for breaking  
down duality; in this ritual the adept  
breaks societal norms forbidding  
consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and illicit sexuality in a  
conscious effort to sacralize what is  
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts  
cite such ritual use of forbidden things  
as proof that their practice involves a  
more exclusive qualification (**adhikara**),  
and is thus superior to common practice. For further information see Arthur
