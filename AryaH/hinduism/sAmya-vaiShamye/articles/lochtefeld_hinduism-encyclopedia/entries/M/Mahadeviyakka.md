title = "Mahadeviyakka"

+++
(12th c.) Poet-saint and religious leader  
in the **Lingayat** religious community,  
a **bhakti** (devotional) community centered on both the **worship** of **Shiva**  
as the single supreme god and on the  
rejection of all **caste** regulations. The  
Lingayats were formed in the southern  
Indian state of **Karnataka**, where they  
still have a considerable presence. The  
collections of poetry that form their  
most important religious texts are composed in the **Kannada** language.  
Mahadeviyakka was a contemporary of  
**Basavanna** and **Allama Prabhu**; her status in the community is marked by the  
suffix akka (“elder sister”). According to  
tradition, she was devoted to Shiva at a  
very young age and considered him to  
be her true husband. This caused great  
problems during a brief, unhappy marriage, a mismatch between a carnally  
inclined man and a woman who would  
have no human lover. She eventually left  
her husband, wandering naked as a sign  
that she had cast away all attachments.  
She later became associated with the  
Lingayats, known as the “Lord’s men.”  
The theme running through most of her  
poetry is love for Shiva, sometimes as  
her husband and sometimes as her  
adulterous lover, both portraying her  
struggles with the world. For further  
information see A. K. Ramanujan,  
*Speaking of Shiva*, 1973.
