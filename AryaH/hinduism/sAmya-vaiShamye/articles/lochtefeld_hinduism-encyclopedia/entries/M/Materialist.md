title = "Materialist"

+++
The name for a philosophical school  
espousing the belief that the individual and the physical body are identical. The body is composed of certain  
physical elements, so with the death  
of the body, the individual ceases to  
exist. Since the materialists believed  
there is no life after death, they also  
believed there is no reason to engage  
in religious activities in the hope of a  
better afterlife. The materialist  
believes that one should live well,  
enjoy life to the fullest, and then die.  
This viewpoint was first espoused by  
**Ajita Keshakambalin**, who was a contemporary of the Buddha. Its later  
adherents were called both Lokayata  
(“worldly”) and Charvaka (after the  
supposed founder). The materialists  
were universally reviled by the other  
philosophical schools, all of whom  
considered their rejection of religious  
life dangerous. One of their philosophical theories, and a sign of their  
rootedness in concrete experience,  
was their position on the **pramanas**,  
the means by which human beings  
can gain true and accurate knowledge.  
Most schools admitted at least three  
such pramanas—perception (**pratyaksha**), inference (**anumana**), and  
authoritative testimony (**shabda**). In  
contrast, the materialists accepted  
only perception, denying the validity  
of the other two. Emphasis is placed  
on experience and the belief that  
what is directly before one’s eyes is  
indisputable.
