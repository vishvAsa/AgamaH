(“circle”) As with many **Sanskrit** terms, a  
word with different meanings in different contexts. In the context of geography it can imply a region, as in the case  
of the **Braj** region, known as the Braj  
Mandala. In the context of the **ras lila**,  
the circle **dance** between the god  
**Krishna** and his devotees (**bhakta**),  
mandala refers to the group of devotees  
as well as to the shape of the dance itself.  
By extension, mandala can refer to any  
group of people, although it carries the  
connotation of people who have gathered for some serious religious purpose.  
In the context of the secret rituallybased religious practice known as  
**tantra**, mandala refers to a symbolic  
diagram used as an aid to meditation, as  
a ritual accessory, or as a symbolic road  
map of the spiritual quest. In this context, mandala is more characteristic of  
Buddhist tantra, with Hindu **tantrikas**  
more frequently using the terms **yantra**  
and **chakra**.
