(early 9th c.) Founder of the **Bhamati**  
school of **Advaita Vedanta**, who is traditionally held to be a contemporary of  
**Shankaracharya**, the Advaita school’s  
greatest figure. The Advaita school  
upholds a philosophical theory known  
as monism—the belief that a single  
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things,  
which are merely differing forms of that  
reality. Advaita proponents claim that  
reality is non-dual (advaita)—all things  
are nothing but the formless, unqualified **Brahman** (the highest reality in the  
universe), despite the appearance of difference and diversity. For the Advaitins,  
the assumption of diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate nature of things, a manifestation  
of **avidya**. Although often translated as  
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood  
as the lack of genuine understanding  
that ultimately causes human beings to  
be trapped in karmic bondage, reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
Mandana suggests the vivarta (“illusory manifestation”) causal relationship  
to show how the unchanging Brahman  
is connected with the world as it is perceived. The concept of superimposition  
(**adhyasa**) shows how humans project a  
mistaken understanding onto the correct understanding. For example, a  
piece of rope is mistaken for a snake.  
Although this judgment is erroneous,  
one is actually perceiving something  
real, in this case the rope, but “superimposing” a different and mistaken identity  
on it, thus “transforming” it into something it is not. In the same way, it is  
argued, human consciousness begins  
with the existent reality (Brahman),  
which is actually there, but superimposes  
onto it something which is not (the  
judgment of a diverse world).  
Mandana also differed from  
Shankaracharya on several points, posing problems for his later followers. One  
of these judgments was that the locus of  
ignorance was in the Self, since it was  
absurd to conceive of Brahman as subject to ignorance; another was that there  
were multiple Selves, since the liberation of one person did not cause the liberation of all. Mandana’s comments  
presuppose the existence of a common  
(if illusory) world, upon which he felt  
called to render a judgment; he ended  
up describing it as anirvachaniya—“that  
which cannot be described.” In his  
analysis, Mandana also distinguished  
between two kinds of ignorance—a primal “covering” that keeps one from perceiving the truth, and a “projective”  
ignorance through which human beings  
actively obscure things.
