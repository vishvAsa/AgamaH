title = "Mukhalinga"

+++
A form of the **linga**, the pillar-shaped  
object symbolizing the god **Shiva**. A  
mukhalinga has one or more faces  
(mukha) sculpted on the shaft of the  
linga. According to the manuals detailing the form and construction of Hindu  
images, the number of faces on the linga  
should not exceed the number of doorways in the temple. Thus, a temple with  
one doorway should have a mukhalinga  
with one face, and so on, up to four. The  
manuals also specify that these faces  
should be placed facing the entrances.
