(“fish”) In the secret ritually-based religious practice known as **tantra**, fish is  
the second of the “Five Forbidden  
Things” (**panchamakara**), which, in  
“left hand” (**vamachara**) tantric ritual,  
are used in their actual forms, but are  
431  
Matsya  
represented by symbolic substitutes in  
“right hand” (**dakshinachara**) tantric  
ritual. “Respectable” Hindu society  
strongly condemns the consumption of  
nonvegetarian food, so this ritual use  
must be seen in the larger tantric  
context. One of the underlying tantric  
assumptions is the ultimate unity of  
everything that exists. From a tantric  
perspective, to affirm that the entire  
universe is one principle means that the  
adept must reject all concepts based on  
dualistic thinking. The “Five Forbidden  
Things” provide a ritual means for  
breaking down duality. In this ritual the  
adept breaks societal norms forbidding  
consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and illicit sexuality in a conscious effort to sacralize what is  
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite  
such ritual use of forbidden things as  
proof that their practice involves a more  
exclusive qualification (**adhikara**), and  
is thus superior to common practice. For
