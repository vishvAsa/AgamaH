title = "Maurya Dynasty"

+++
The earliest of the great Indian empires.  
At its zenith, the Maurya dynasty ruled  
over most of the Indian subcontinent,  
except in the deep south. The dynasty  
was founded by **Chandragupta Maurya**  
in the fourth century B.C.E., but reached  
its peak under his grandson **Ashoka**,  
who reigned from 269–232 B.C.E. The  
kingdom was centered in the lower  
**Ganges** basin, with its capital at  
**Pataliputra**, near the modern city of  
Patna in the state of **Bihar**. The Mauryan  
empire is the first historically documented centralized Indian empire; it  
was operated and maintained by a large  
governmental bureaucracy. Despite its  
size and organization, the empire was  
short-lived. It began to disintegrate on  
Ashoka’s death; fifty years later it had  
virtually disappeared.
