title = "Mahayuga"

+++
A unit of **cosmic time**. According to traditional Hindu reckoning, time has neither beginning nor end, but alternates  
between cycles of creation and activity,  
followed by cessation and quietude.  
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion  
years, with the active phase known as  
the **Day of Brahma**, and the quiet phase  
as the Night of Brahma. In one reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of Brahma is  
divided into one thousand mahayugas  
(“great cosmic ages”), each of which  
lasts for 4.32 million years. Each  
mahayuga is composed of four eras,  
named the **Krta Yuga**, **Treta Yuga**,  
**Dvapara Yuga**, and **Kali Yuga**. Each is  
shorter and more evil than its predecessor; by the end of the Kali Yuga, things  
have gotten so bad that the only solution is the destruction and recreation of  
the **earth**, at which time the next Krta  
Yuga begins.
