title = "Moon"

+++
In Hindu astrology (**jyotisha**), a **planet**  
associated with fecundity (fertility),  
although its aspect can be either benevolent or malevolentâ€”benevolent with  
the waxing moon, and malevolent with  
the waning moon. During the **lunar**  
**month**, the **full moon** is considered the  
most auspicious time of all. The **new**  
**moon**, however, is considered a ritually  
ambiguous time, and thus potentially  
dangerous. During the **week** the moon  
presides over **Monday**, generally considered an auspicious **day** and one that is  
sacred to **Shiva** as **Somnath**, the Lord of  
the Moon.
