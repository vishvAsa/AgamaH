title = "Mitakshara"

+++
A voluminous commentary on the  
**Yajnavalkya Smrti**, written early in the  
twelfth century by the scholar  
**Vijnaneshvara**. This particular commentary played a pivotal role in the  
British colonial administration of India.  
The British were content to have their  
Indian subjects governed by their traditional religious laws, but to do so they  
needed to know what these laws were.  
For large sections of British India, the  
*Mitakshara* was given the status of traditional law, functioning as a legal code.  
The only major part of India in which  
the *Mitakshara* did not hold sway was in  
Bengal, where the legal authority was  
the **Dayabhaga**. One of the major differences between the two was in matters of  
**inheritance**. The *Mitakshara* stresses  
inheritance by survivorship, in which  
only living males can inherit property,  
whereas the *Dayabhaga* stresses inheritance by succession, in which a dead  
manâ€™s heirs can inherit in his name.
