title = "Morari Bapu"

+++
(b. Muraridas Prabhudas 1946) Modern  
commentator and expositor (kathavacak) on the **Ramcharitmanas**. Written  
by the poet-saint **Tulsidas**, the  
*Ramcharitmanas* is a vernacular version  
of the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great **Sanskrit** epics. As with all vernacular renditions of the *Ramayana*,  
Tulsidas did not simply translate  
**Valmiki’s** Sanskrit epic, but adapted it to  
address his own religious concerns, particularly the importance of devotion  
(**bhakti**) to God, one of the text’s central  
themes. Morari Bapu claims no supernatural powers or ability; his religious  
fame rests solely on his commitment to  
the text, and his power in expounding it.  
At times he speaks to audiences of more  
than 100,000 people, giving **katha**  
(discourse) to the Hindu **diaspora populations** in Europe and North America,  
as well as in India.
