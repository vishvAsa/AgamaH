title = "Mansa Devi"

Presiding **deity** in the village of  
Manimajara, located in the **Shiwalik**  
**Hills**, a short distance from Chandigarh,  
and one of the nine **Shiwalik goddesses**.  
According to local tradition, this is one  
of the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of sites  
sacred to the **Goddess** that spreads  
throughout the subcontinent. Each  
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body  
part of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to **earth**, taking form there as a different goddess; Mansa Devi was Sati’s  
head. The word *mansa* means “wish,”  
and it is claimed that Mansa Devi  
will grant whatever wish the devotee  
(**bhakta**) brings to her. There is another  
temple of Mansa Devi on the hill above  
the bathing (**snana**) ghats in the sacred  
city of **Haridwar**; here, too, the officiants  
claim that the presiding deity will fulfill  
all one’s wishes.  
The charter myth for the Manimajara  
Mansa Devi, set in the time of the  
Moghul emperor **Akbar**, illustrates her  
power and concern for her devotees.  
Akbar appoints a **Rajput** chieftain to  
manage the land around Manimajara.  
One year the chieftain is unable to pay  
his taxes because bad weather has  
ruined the crops. The chieftain is put in  
prison, but his plight moves one of  
Mansa Devi’s devotees, who implores  
her to intervene in his behalf. The chieftain is released and the taxes waived;  
when the chieftain discovers how this  
has happened, he is so grateful that he  
erects a temple in honor of the goddess.
