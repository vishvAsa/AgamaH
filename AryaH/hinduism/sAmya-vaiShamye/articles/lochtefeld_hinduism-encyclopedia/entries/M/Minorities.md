In any society, minority groups are  
defined according to a particular social  
context. In India the two most prominent minority groups are Muslims and  
Christians. Muslims—about twelve percent of the population—are viewed with  
suspicion, due to India’s troubled relations with Pakistan. Christians and  
Muslims are viewed as having religious  
loyalties that lie outside of India—  
Mecca for Muslims, and Rome or  
Jerusalem for Christians. These two  
communities have been perceived very  
differently from other religious communities, such as the Sikhs and the Jains,  
who are part of the Indian cultural tradition. Cultural and political organizations espousing forms of Hindu  
nationalism (**Hindutva**), particularly the  
**Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh** and its  
affiliates, have often stressed the “otherness” of these communities. Such  
organizations have as their express  
purpose the unification of Hindus  
from all regions, castes, and backgrounds, but do so through criteria that  
exclude these minorities.
