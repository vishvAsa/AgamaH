title = "Malatimadhava"

+++
Play written by the **Sanskrit** dramatist  
**Bhavabhuti** (early 8th c.), who was particularly noted for his ability to express  
and transmit the play of emotions  
through language. The play’s general  
plot is the triumphant love between  
Malati and her beloved Madhava (an  
epithet of the god **Krishna**), despite  
numerous obstacles along the way. The  
drama is noted as an exquisite poetic  
work, but also because the primary  
villain is an evil **ascetic**, generally  
believed to be a member of the extinct  
ascetic sect known as **Kapalikas**. The  
Kapalikas were devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**, emulating him in his wrathful  
form as **Bhairava**: wearing the hair long  
and matted, smearing the body with  
ash (preferably from the **cremation**  
**ground**), and bearing a club and a  
skull-bowl (**kapala**). The Kapilikas are  
cited as indulging in forbidden  
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,  
using cannabis and other **drugs**,  
performing **human sacrifice**, and  
orgiastic sexuality—which made them  
feared. Bhavabhuti’s description is  
one of the earliest references to  
**Shaiva asceticism**, and thus historically  
significant. The play has been translated  
into English by Michael Coulson and  
published in an anthology titled *Three*  
*Sanskrit Plays*, 1981.
