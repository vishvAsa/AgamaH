(“home”) In northern India, the most  
common name for a temple in which  
the image of a **deity** has been installed  
and consecrated for **worship**. Although  
such temples often have facilities for  
congregational worship, social life, or  
cultural events, the building’s primary  
function is to serve as the home for the  
deities assembled there and considered  
the temple’s real owners.
