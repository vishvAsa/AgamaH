According to tradition, the **guru** of the  
sage **Gorakhnath** and the founder of the  
**Nathpanthis**, a group of renunciant  
**ascetics** who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**. He is also known as  
Minanath. According to the Nathpanthi  
tradition, Matsyendranath received his  
teaching from Shiva himself, by taking  
the form of a fish (in **Sanskrit**, the words  
**matsya** and *mina* both mean “fish”), and  
eavesdropping while Shiva was teaching  
his wife **Parvati**. For further information  
about Gorakhnath and the **Nath** tradition, see George Weston Briggs,  
*Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis*,
