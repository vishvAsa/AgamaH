+++
**Sanskrit** word traditionally used to  
designate a foreigner or a non-**Aryan**.  
The word *mleccha* is also used to  
indicate a person who has become  
an outcaste and thus has no place in  
established society. The verb from which  
the word *mleccha* is derived means  
“to speak confusedly or indistinctly,”  
indicating someone who has not yet  
mastered the language.
