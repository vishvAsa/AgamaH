(“Great Sinner”) In the **dharma literature**, a person who has committed one  
of the **Four Great Crimes**, namely murdering a **brahmin** (**brahmahatya**), stealing a brahmin’s gold (**steya**), drinking  
**liquor** (**surapana**), or committing **adultery** with the wife of one’s **guru** (**gurutalpaga**). These crimes were considered  
so heinous that the performer became  
an outcast from society. Another indication of the gravity of these acts was that  
their expiations (**prayashchitta**) were so  
severe that they normally ended in  
death; in some cases this outcome was  
specifically prescribed. Aside from prescribing such punishments for the actual  
offenders, the dharma literature also  
prescribed similar outcaste status for  
anyone who knowingly associated with  
such people for more than one year.
