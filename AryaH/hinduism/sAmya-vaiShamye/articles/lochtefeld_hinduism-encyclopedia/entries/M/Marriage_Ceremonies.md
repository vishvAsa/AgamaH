In India, virtually everybody gets married. Marriage is a religious duty for  
**twice-born** men, satisfying one of their  
**Three Debts**, in this case the debt to  
their ancestors. Twice-born men are  
householders born into one of the three  
“twice-born” groups in Indian society,  
**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**. Such  
men are eligible to receive the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the  
“second birth.” For most Hindu **women**,  
being wives and mothers defines their  
identity. Marriage is also the event by  
which families are formed and grow.  
Since the family is considered the  
bedrock of Hindu society, for most people, marriage is the single most important event in their lives.  
The great significance of marriage  
in Hindu culture means that this  
life-changing event is attended with  
potential peril because there is no  
certainty of success. Other potential  
dangers come from the inauspicious  
nature of certain times, people, and  
the belief that this **inauspiciousness**  
may bring bad fortune for the future.  
Finally, given that the bride and groom  
are the center of attention in the days  
before the marriage, there is the danger

Marriage Ceremonies  
In many traditional Hindu marriage ceremonies,  
the groom’s turban is attached to the bride’s sari,  
binding the couple together.  
that other people’s ill will and envy may  
unleash malevolent and unseen forces. As  
with many of the other life transitions,  
Hindu marriages are attended with considerable attention to discerning the  
unseen forces that could have a negative  
affect on the couple’s future life and protecting the bride and groom from them.  
The wedding is always performed at an  
astrologically auspicious time, to start the  
marriage on the best possible note. In the  
days before the wedding, the bride is often  
secluded, keeping her from coming in  
contact with people or things deemed  
inauspicious. On their wedding day both  
the bride and groom are anointed and  
adorned similar to the **deities** in a temple—according to popular belief, on their  
wedding day, the couple become **Lakshmi**  
and **Vishnu**, god and **goddess**. This  
heightened status puts them in ritual danger when they are outside in the world,  
both from the legion of sources for ritual  
impurity (**ashaucha**), and because they  
are believed to be more susceptible to the  
evil eye (**nazar**) and other forms of **witchcraft**. These dangers are countered by  
amulets and various **rites of protection**  
when the bride or groom must be in the  
public eye, such as when the groom and  
his group of friends travel in triumphal  
procession to the wedding hall, as is common in northern India. Once inside, the  
danger is less pressing, since they are in a  
closed and ritually structured environment, surrounded by family and friends.  
There is no single Hindu marriage  
ceremony, as is clear from the eight classical forms of marriage recognized in  
the **dharma literature**. Of these eight,  
the two forms generally practiced today  
are the **Asura** form, in which the groom’s  
family gives money as a **brideprice** to  
obtain the bride; and the **Brahma** form,  
in which the bride’s family gives their  
daughter to the groom, without making  
any conditions on him at all (although  
in contemporary times the groom’s  
family can usually expect a **dowry**  
with the bride). The Brahma marriage  
carries much higher social status and  
is the most popular form. Although in  
such a marriage the wedding ceremonies have regional and sectarian  
variation, certain common rites reveal  
important cultural assumptions.  
The two major themes in a Hindu marriage are the transfer of the bride from her  
family to her husband’s family, and the  
indissoluble merging of bride and groom  
into a new entity, the married couple. The  
transfer of the bride is done in the  
**kanyadan** ritual, the “gift of the virgin”  
performed by the bride’s father. The bride  
and groom’s marital union is symbolized  
by several common rites, including **panigrahana**, in which the groom takes the  
bride’s hand as a sign of their union.  
Another such rite, considered the defining  
point of the marriage, is the **saptapadi**, the  
“seven steps” which the bride and groom  
take together. The seventh step completes  
the bride’s transfer to the groom’s family; it  
is at this point that the marriage becomes  
indissoluble. In modern times the saptapadi is often performed in conjunction  
with another ceremony, the **agnipradakshinam** (“circumambulating the fire”).  
Instead of taking seven steps, the bride  
and groom make seven revolutions  
around a small fire. On one hand, the presence of fire shows that marriage is a **yajna**  
or Vedic **sacrifice**. On the other, since the  
fire is considered to be the Vedic god **Agni**,  
he becomes the divine witness to the marriage. During the circumambulations the  
bride and groom are often physically  
joined by tying part of his turban to the  
edge of her sari. This visible bond between  
them is yet another sign of the inner union  
that has just been formed.  
As described, in marriage the wife’s  
identity is “assimilated” to her husband’s, rather than some sort of mutual  
transformation. In northern India, the  
bride lives with her husband’s family  
after the marriage; her new identity  
stems solely from her relationship  
with her husband, whereas his identity remains essentially unchanged,  
although augmented by marriage. For
