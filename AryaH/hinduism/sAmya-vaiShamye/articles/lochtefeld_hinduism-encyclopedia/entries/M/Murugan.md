title = "Murugan"

+++
(“fragrant, beautiful”) Hindu **deity** primarily worshiped in southern India.  
Murugan originally appears in the Tamil  
**Sangam literature**, where he is a hill  
deity associated with the hunt and wild,  
unsettled places. One of Murugan’s  
characteristic objects is the lance, symbolizing the hunt. As brahminical Hindu  
culture gradually came to southern  
India, Murugan was drawn into the  
established pantheon as a form of the  
god **Skanda**, who is the son of the god  
**Shiva**. By the tenth century Murugan’s  
identity had evolved as that of a philosopher and exponent of the **Shaiva**  
**Siddhanta** philosophical school and as  
the patron deity of **Tamil language** and  
literature. For southern Indians, especially in the state of **Tamil Nadu**, worshiping Murugan becomes a vehicle to  
affirm their traditional culture. This has  
been particularly true since Indian independence in 1947, when the attempt to  
impose **Hindi** as the national language  
was seen as northern Indian cultural  
imperialism and was met with  
incredible resistance. The cult of  
Murugan has five major pilgrimage centers—**Palani**, **Tiruchendur**, **Tiruttani**,  
**Tirrupparankunram**, and **Swami Malai**.  
All of these sites are located in different  
parts of Tamil Nadu. This network of  
sacred sites (**tirthas**) is a way in which  
the cult of Murugan has come to symbolize Tamil identity. For further information see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage  
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of  
Murukan,” in *Journal of the American*
