title = "Mirabai"

+++
(early 16th c.?) A poet-saint who was a  
devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna**.  
Although little is known about her,  
Mirabai’s songs remain some of the  
best-known devotional (**bhakti**) poetry.  
According to tradition, Mirabai was  
born into a royal family in a small kingdom in **Rajasthan**. From her earliest  
days, she was passionately devoted to  
Krishna. Although her parents arranged  
a marriage with the scion of another  
439  
Mirabai  
ruler, she considered Krishna to be her  
true husband. After extended conflict  
with her in-laws—in which they reportedly attempted to poison her—her  
release came with the death of her husband, after which she was allowed to  
leave her marital home. She spent her  
later years visiting places associated  
with Krishna and sharing in the “good  
company” (**satsang**) of other devotees.  
She went to **Dwaraka**, the city over  
which Krishna is said to have ruled, and  
met her end by being absorbed into the  
image of Krishna at his temple there.  
Mirabai’s poetry is marked by her  
expressions of longing for Krishna. She  
often speaks of herself either as his wife  
or his waiting lover, seeking physical and  
mystical union with him. Her poetry is  
an intensely personal expression of her  
religious fervor; the power of this longing has made her a symbol of religious  
devotion. For scholars, Mirabai’s poetry  
raises perplexing questions of authorship, for the earliest manuscripts are  
several hundred years older than when  
she is supposed to have lived, but for  
common people the songs bearing her  
name are widely popular even today.  
She has also been featured in at least ten  
feature films, showing the staying power  
of devotion even in the modern age. For
