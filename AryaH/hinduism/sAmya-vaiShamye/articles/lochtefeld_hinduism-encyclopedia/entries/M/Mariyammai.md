title = "Mariyammai"

+++
Originally a local **goddess** in southern  
India, whose cult has become a regional  
phenomenon. Mariyammai embodies  
many of the contradictions and tensions  
associated with Hindu conceptions of  
the Goddess in general. According to her  
charter myth, Mariyammai is originally  
a **brahmin** woman, who is beheaded  
because of her husband’s jealousy. She is  
brought back to life, but not before her  
body has become switched with that of  
another woman, this one an **untouchable**. Mariyammai’s brahmin head and  
untouchable body symbolize the imperfect joining of brahminical Hindu and  
southern Indian culture, as well as the  
nebulous status of brahmins as the  
“head” of southern Indian society.
