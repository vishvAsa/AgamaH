(“pair”) In **architecture**, the name for  
what has been described as a “loving  
couple.” A more candid characterization  
is that of sculptures of men and **women**  
engaged in sexual activity, either as a  
pair or a larger group, with the occasional animal thrown in for variety. The most  
famous examples of such sculptures  
are at the temples at **Konarak** in the  
state of **Orissa**, and at **Khajuraho** in  
the state of **Madhya Pradesh**. The  
meaning behind such explicit sculptures has been variously interpreted.  
Some people claim that they sanction  
carnal pleasure as a religious path,  
some interpret them as representing  
human union with the divine, and still  
others view them as teaching that the  
desire for pleasure must ultimately be  
transcended to attain the divine. Any  
of these may be true, or the sculptures  
may simply reflect an affirmation of life  
on all its levels.
