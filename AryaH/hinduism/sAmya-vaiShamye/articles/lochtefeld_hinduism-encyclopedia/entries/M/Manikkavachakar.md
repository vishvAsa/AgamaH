title = "Manikkavachakar"

+++
(9th c.) Tamil poet-saint who was a  
devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva** and  
the author of the **Tiruvachakam** (“holy  
utterances”). He is considered the fourth  
great figure in the Tamil Shaivite tradition, along with the **Nayanar** poetsaints, **Appar**, **Sambandar**, and  
**Sundaramurtti**. Manikkavachakar’s  
hymns bear witness to the intensity of  
his individual religious experience and  
are seen as the culmination of the earlier  
devotional (**bhakti**) tradition. These  
hymns are also the basis for the development of the **Shaiva Siddhanta** philosophical school, making him a pivotal  
figure in southern Indian Shaivism. For  
further information see Glenn Yocum,  
*Hymns to the Dancing Siva*, 1982.
