title = "Mantra"

+++
In its most basic sense, sacred sound. A  
mantra is a collection of phonemes that  
may or may not have syntactic meaning  
as actual words, since their importance  
comes not from the meaning of the  
utterances, but from the very sounds  
themselves. Mantras are believed to  
confer power and varying spiritual  
capacities on those who have been given  
the qualification (**adhikara**) to use  
them. The qualification comes from  
422  
Manmatha  
being given the mantra by one’s teacher,  
believed to transmit not only the sounds  
of the mantra, but the power associated  
with it. This living transmission is  
considered an essential feature in “possessing” the mantra; for this reason  
mantras learned in other contexts are  
believed to be ineffective. The idea  
of mantra as sacred sound is traced  
back to the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu  
religious texts. One of the most common  
mantras, the **Gayatri** mantra, is actually  
a verse from the **Rg Veda** (3.62.10).  
The use of mantras is emphasized in the  
secret ritually-based religious practice  
known as **tantra**. For further information see Arthur Avalon (Sir  
John Woodroffe), *Shakti and Shakta*,
