title = "Mantrashastra"

+++
The name for the body of learning that  
focuses on **mantras** or sacred formulae:  
their classification, meaning, and use.  
Some of this learning exists in textual  
form, but given the secret nature of the  
subject matter, and the traditional insistence on oral, personal transmission  
from a religious teacher, much exists  
only in oral form.
