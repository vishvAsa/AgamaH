(b. Merwan Sheriar Irani, 1894–1969)  
Modern religious figure who was born a  
Parsi, but whose teachings draw on  
Islamic mystical thought and Hindu  
devotional (**bhakti**) teachings. Meher  
Baba (“Divine Father”) claimed to be an  
**avatar** or “incarnation” of the divine,  
and his followers accept him as such. In  
1925 he took a vow of silence, which he  
kept for the rest of his life, communicating through gestures and an alphabet  
board. Despite his silence, he compiled  
his teachings in a five-volume set of  
discourses titled *God Speaks*. Like many  
contemporary Hindu missionary figures, Meher Baba emphasized the need  
for devotion to one’s **guru** or religious  
preceptor, through which the disciple  
would gain all things. For further information from a devotee’s (**bhakta**) perspective, see Jean Adriel, *Avatar*, 1947.
