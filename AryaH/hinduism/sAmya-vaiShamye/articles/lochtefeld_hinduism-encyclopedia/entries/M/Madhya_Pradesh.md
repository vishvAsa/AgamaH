title = "Madhya Pradesh"

+++
(“middle state”) Modern Indian state  
located in the geographical center of the  
subcontinent. Madhya Pradesh was  
formed after Indian independence in  
1947 from the former Central Provinces,  
Berar State, and several princely states.  
Large parts of the state are inaccessible  
and relatively undeveloped, particularly  
in the **Vindhya Mountain** and Satpura  
ranges. Madhya Pradesh also has a large  
percentage of **adivasis** (indigenous tribal people), many of whom are very poor.  
Madhya Pradesh contains many important archaeological sites, including the  
**Chandella** temples at **Khajuraho** and  
the caves at **Udayagiri**. Sacred sites  
(**tirthas**) include the **Narmada River**,  
one of the seven sacred rivers of India,  
and the holy city of **Ujjain**. For general  
information about Madhya Pradesh and  
other regions of India, see Christine
