title = "Manimegalai"

+++
**Tamil epic** poem which was written as a  
sequel to “The Jeweled Anklet”  
(**Shilappadigaram**), connecting its  
characters with those of the earlier play.  
The story focuses on a young woman  
named Manimegalai who, although  
wooed by the local prince, becomes a  
Buddhist nun. Manimegalai has numerous debates with people from competing religious traditions, thus giving a  
picture of sixth century southern Indian  
religious life.
