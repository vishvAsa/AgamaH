In Indian **philosophy** moksha is one of  
the four purusharthas, or **aims of life**;  
the others are **artha** (wealth, power, and  
prosperity), **kama** (desire), and **dharma**  
(righteousness). Moksha literally means  
“release”—the human soul’s (**atman**)  
final liberation from the cycle of reincarnation (**samsara**). The quest for liberation involves questioning and ultimately  
detaching oneself from pursuits of

normal social life. Although all four  
purusharthas are legitimate and sanctioned, liberation is usually seen as the  
ultimate goal, the last goal to be pursued  
after fulfilling the pleasures and pains  
stemming from the other three. Moksha  
is also unchanging, bringing one complete and absolute freedom, whereas  
the other three are ultimately transient, for they are pursued within the  
ever-changing world of desires.
