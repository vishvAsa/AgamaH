title = "Maratha"

Traditional Indian society was a collection of **endogamous** subgroups (in  
which marriage is decreed by law to  
occur only between members of the  
same group) known as **jatis**. Jatis were  
organized (and their social status determined) by the groupâ€™s hereditary occupation, over which each group held a  
monopoly. The Maratha jati was one of  
the dominant landholding communities  
in the **Maharashtra** region, along with  
the **Kunbis**. They were most concentrated  
on the Konkan coast and the inland  
region around the city of Pune. The  
Marathas were tough peasant farmers  
who by the middle of the eighteenth  
century had forged a large but shortlived empire, the Maratha confederacy,  
extending over much of northern and  
central India. By the latter part of the  
eighteenth century, the confederacy had  
fragmented into various smaller states.
