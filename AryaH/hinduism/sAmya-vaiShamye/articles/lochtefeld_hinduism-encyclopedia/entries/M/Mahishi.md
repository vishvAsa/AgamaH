title = "Mahishi"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the name of a  
buffalo-demoness killed by the god  
**Aiyappa**. Mahishi receives the boon that  
she can only be killed by a person not  
born from the union of male and female.  
To circumvent this boon, Aiyappa is  
born of a union of the gods **Shiva** and  
**Vishnu**, when the latter takes the form  
of the enchantress **Mohini**. When  
Mahishi is killed, the female figure of  
**Lila** rises from her body. Lila wants to  
marry Aiyappa; he agrees that he will  
marry her in the year a celibate pilgrim  
does not come to visit him at **Shabari**  
**Malai**. Since **women** of childbearing age  
are forbidden to visit Shabari Malai, and  
those men who come are required to be  
celibate, Lila is still waiting for this vow  
to be fulfilled.
