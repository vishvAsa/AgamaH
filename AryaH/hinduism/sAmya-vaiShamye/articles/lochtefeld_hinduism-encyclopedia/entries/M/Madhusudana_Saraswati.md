title = "Madhusudana Saraswati"

+++
(16th c.) A renowned member of the  
**Sanyasi** community, a group of renunciant ascetics who were devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**. His last name reveals  
that he was a member of the **Saraswati**  
sect, one of the most prestigious of the  
ten **Dashanami** divisions; he is said to  
have lived most of his life in **Benares**,  
the greatest religious center of his  
time. According to **ascetic** legend,  
Madhusudana was responsible for the  
creation of a class of fighting ascetics,  
the **Naga** Sanyasis. According to tradition, Madhusudana created these fighters because he was distressed at the  
depredations the Sanyasis suffered at  
the hands of hostile Muslim **faqirs**. After  
consulting with Birbal, adviser to  
Moghul emperor **Akbar**, Madhusudana  
decided to form a fighting ascetic  
order dedicated to protecting other  
ascetics. Recruits came from the ranks  
of the **shudras**.
