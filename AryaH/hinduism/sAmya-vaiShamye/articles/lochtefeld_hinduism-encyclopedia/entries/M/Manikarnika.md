title = "Manikarnika"

+++
(“Jeweled earring”) Sacred site (**tirtha**)  
in the city of **Benares** on the **Ganges**  
River in the state of **Uttar Pradesh**.  
The site takes its name from the  
Manikarnika Kund, a bathing (**snana**)  
tank supposedly dug by the god **Vishnu**,  
and into which fell an earring of the god  
**Shiva**, thus sanctifying the tank by its  
presence. In modern times the site is  
better known for the **cremation ground**  
at Manikarnika **Ghat**. In most Indian  
cities the cremation ground lies at the  
margin of the settlement, since its association with death makes it an inauspicious place. However, the Manikarnika  
cremation ground is in the center of  
Benares. Despite the normal human

Manikarnika  
desire to ignore and to deny the reality  
of death, in Benares it is paraded in  
full view—not to distress or depress  
people, but to make them confront this  
reality. Awareness of death has traditionally been considered a great spur to  
religious life. Since Benares is also one  
of the **Seven Sacred Cities**, death  
within the city also carries the hope of  
ultimate liberation.
