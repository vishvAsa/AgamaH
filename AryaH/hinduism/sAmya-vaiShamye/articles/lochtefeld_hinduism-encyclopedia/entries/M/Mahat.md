(“great one”) In the account of **evolution**  
found in the **Samkhya** philosophical  
school, mahat is the first evolutionary  
stage. It consists of the initial disturbance of **prakrti** (primal matter)  
transforming from its original state  
of equilibrium. Mahat is called the  
“great one” because prakrti remains  
unchanged. Mahat is also known  
as **buddhi**, the mental faculty for  
awareness, apperception, and decision  
making that is believed to be at the root  
of mental processes. The mental  
processes facilitated by buddhi spur the  
development of the next stage in the  
evolution, **ahamkar** or subjective consciousness, after which the division of  
the world into subjective and objective  
spheres proceeds.
