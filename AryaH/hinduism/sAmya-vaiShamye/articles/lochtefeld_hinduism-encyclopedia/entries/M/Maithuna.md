(“copulation”) In the secret rituallybased religious practice known as  
**tantra**, sexual intercourse is the fifth  
and last of the Five Forbidden Things  
(**panchamakara**); the panchamakara  
are used in their actual forms in “left  
hand” (**vamachara**) tantric ritual,  
whereas they are represented by symbolic substitutes in “right hand” (**dakshinachara**) tantric ritual. Many  
traditions in Hindu tantra describe ritualized sexual intercourse as a symbol of  
the ultimate union of the god **Shiva** and  
his wife **Shakti**. Ritual sexuality must be  
seen in the larger tantric context. One of  
the most pervasive tantric assumptions  
is the ultimate unity of everything that  
exists. From a tantric perspective, to  
affirm that the entire universe is one  
principle means that the adept must  
reject all concepts based on dualistic  
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”  
provide a ritual means for breaking  
down duality; in this ritual the adept  
breaks societal norms forbidding consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and illicit sexuality in a  
conscious effort to sacralize what is  
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite  
such ritual use of forbidden things as  
proof that their practice involves a  
more exclusive qualification (**adhikara**),  
and is thus superior to common practice. In some forms of this ritual the  
woman is the initiate’s wife, who is  
worshiped before intercourse as a  
manifestation of the **Goddess**. In other  
cases this ritual intercourse is portrayed as adulterous, usually with a  
woman of very low status, to magnify  
the social boundaries being transgressed. This latter practice is uncommon now, at least in southern India,  
where Brooks describes it as virtually  
unknown. For further information see
