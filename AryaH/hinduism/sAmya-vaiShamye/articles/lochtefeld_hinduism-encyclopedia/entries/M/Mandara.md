In Hindu mythology, the name of a  
sacred mountain where the minor  
god **Kubera** and his court reside. In the  
myth of the **Tortoise avatar**, Mount  
Mandara is identified as the churningstick used to churn the ocean of milk  
(the mountainâ€™s tremendous size makes  
it an effective churn).
