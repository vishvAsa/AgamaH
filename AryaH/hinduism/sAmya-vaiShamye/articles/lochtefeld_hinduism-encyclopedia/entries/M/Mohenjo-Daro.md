title = "Mohenjo-Daro"

+++
Archeological site on the **Indus** River in  
modern Pakistan, about two hundred  
miles north of Karachi. Mohenjo-Daro is  
one of the cities of the **Indus Valley civilization**, a highly developed urban culture that flourished in the Indus Valley  
region between the fourth and third millennia B.C.E. **Harappa** and MohenjoDaro have been the most extensively  
excavated of these cities, although  
archeological work is proceeding at others. Similarities at these different sites  
reveal insights into this civilization’s  
material culture. One of the features at  
Mohenjo-Daro is the “Great Bath,” a  
large water-tank built of brick and  
sealed with pitch. Scholars speculate  
that it was connected with ritual **purity**.
