(often translated as “monastery”) A  
dwelling place for **ascetics**; usually a  
large, well-settled dwelling for a number  
of ascetics belonging to an established  
order. The four most famous maths are  
believed to have been established by the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**: the **Jyotir**  
**Math** in the Himalayan town of  
**Joshimath**; the **Govardhan Math** in the  
city of **Puri**, on the Bay of Bengal; the  
430  
Marut  
**Sharada Math** in the city of **Dwaraka**  
on the Arabian Sea; and the **Shringeri**  
**Math** in the town of **Shringeri** in  
southern India. These maths are the  
headquarters for the four major  
groups in the **Dashanami** sect  
**Sanyasis**, renunciant ascetics who are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**.  
Although most maths do not have the  
status of these four, they all serve as  
ascetic and religious centers.
