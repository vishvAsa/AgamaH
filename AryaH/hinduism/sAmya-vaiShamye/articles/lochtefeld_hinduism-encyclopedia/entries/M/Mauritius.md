title = "Mauritius"

+++
Island nation in the Indian Ocean, 1,200  
miles east of the African coast. Mauritius  
has a significant Hindu **diaspora population**. As in many other cases, Indians  
were first brought to Mauritius as indentured agricultural laborers, in this case  
as workers on the sugar plantations.  
Currently, they comprise nearly 75 percent of the island’s population, running  
the nation’s political system. The Hindus  
on Mauritius have transferred India’s  
sacred geography to their new land: A  
southern lake named **Grand Bassin** is  
claimed to have an underground connection to the River **Ganges**, and the  
lake has become a significant pilgrimage site.
