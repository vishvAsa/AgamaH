title = "Mahanirvani Akhara"

+++
The name of a group of the **Naga** class of  
the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, a type of  
renunciant **ascetic**. The Dashanami  
Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**, organized into different **akharas**  
or regiments on the model of an army.  
Until the beginning of the nineteenth  
century, the Nagasâ€™ primary occupation  
was as mercenary soldiers or traders;  
both of these have largely disappeared  
in contemporary times. This akhara is  
described as taking part in a battle with  
the forces of the Moghul emperor  
**Aurangzeb** in 1664, and are credited  
with saving the city of **Benares** from  
being sacked.  
The Mahanirvani Akhara is one of  
the seven main Dashanami Naga akharas and remains one of most influential.  
The principal center of the Mahanirvani  
Akhara is in **Allahabad**, site of the largest  
and most important bathing (**snana**)  
festivals, known as the **Kumbha Mela**.  
Their strength in Allahabad has allowed  
them to assume the most desirable spot  
at the head of the bathing procession  
during the Kumbha Mela. Each of the  
akharas has a (guardian) **deity** who  
defines their organizational identity; the  
tutelary deity of the Mahanirvani Akhara  
is the great sage **Kapila**.
