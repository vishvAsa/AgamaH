title = "Markandeya Purana"

+++
One of the eighteen traditional **puranas**,  
the sectarian compendia of mythic  
stories and sacred lore that are among  
the most important sources for modern  
Hinduism. **Markandeya** is said to have  
been an ancient sage, but he was not  
intimately connected with any particular **deity**. In this respect, the  
*Markandeya Purana* is different from  
most of the others, which have a clear  
sectarian bias. This purana is noted  
for one of its subsections, the  
**Devimahatmya**. Describing the ultimate power behind all things as female,  
the *Devimahatmya* is the earliest  
and most important textual source  
for the mythology of the **Goddess**.  
Scholars contend that although  
this text is the first place that this  
theological conviction appears, it must  
426  
Marichi  
have existed earlier, since it appears in  
this text fully developed.
