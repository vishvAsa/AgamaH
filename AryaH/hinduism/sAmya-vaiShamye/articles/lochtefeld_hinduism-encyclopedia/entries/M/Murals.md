**Sanskrit** literature contains numerous  
references to mural painting. In early  
medieval times, these were common  
forms of decorating both temples and  
the homes of the wealthy. The heat and  
moisture of the Indian climate have not  
been kind to such artwork; few examples remain today. The most famous  
murals are at Buddhist sitesâ€”Ajanta in  
central India and Sigiriya in **Sri Lanka**.  
These murals convey themes about  
everyday life. There are also traces of  
painting in the caves at **Ellora**. Paintings  
from the Chola era were recently discovered at the **Rajrajeshvar temple** in  
**Tanjore**; they are being restored. See  
also **Chola dynasty**.
