(“great utterance”) Short statements  
from the speculative texts known as the  
**Upanishads**, called “great” because they  
reveal the true nature of reality and of  
the Self. One of the most famous  
mahavakya is **tat tvam asi** (“that thou  
art”), expressing the unity of the Self  
with **Brahman**. Other well known utterances are **ayamatma Brahman** (“This  
Self is Brahman”), **sarvam idam khalu**  
**Brahman** (“Truly, this universe is  
Brahman”), **aham brahmasmi** (“I am  
Brahman”), and **prajnanam Brahman**  
(“Knowledge is Brahman”). These great  
utterances are most important in the  
**leap philosophy** propounded by the  
philosopher **Sureshvara**. Leap philosophers believe that complete freedom is  
possible, but out of our immediate control, in that it cannot be gained by a precisely specified sequence of causes and  
effects. According to Sureshvara’s understanding, when a person whose understanding has been purified hears one of  
these mahavakyas, the profound truth  
in the utterance brings the flash of  
insight that brings final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**).
