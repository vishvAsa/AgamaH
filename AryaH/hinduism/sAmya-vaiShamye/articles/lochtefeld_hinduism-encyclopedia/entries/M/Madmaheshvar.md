+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Garhwal** region of the **Himalayas**, about  
twenty miles north of the village of  
**Ukhimath**. The temple’s presiding **deity**  
is the god **Shiva** in his manifestation as  
Madmaheshvar. Madmaheshvar is one  
of the **Panchkedar**, a network of five  
sacred sites in the Garhwal region; the  
other four sites are **Kedarnath**,  
**Rudranath**, **Tungnath**, and **Kalpeshvar**.  
This network of five sites is seen as  
a symbolic representation of **Shiva’s**  
body; Madmaheshvar is believed to  
be Shiva’s navel.
