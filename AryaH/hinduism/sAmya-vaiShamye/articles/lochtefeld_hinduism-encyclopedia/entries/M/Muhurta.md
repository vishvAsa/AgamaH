In traditional timekeeping, a muhurta is  
a period of forty-eight minutes, of which  
there are thirty during each day. The  
**Brahma Muhurta** is the most auspicious time period, coming directly  
before dawn. The time before the  
Brahma Muhurta is considered the least  
auspicious in the day. This cycle exemplifies a pattern in the Indian view of  
time. A period of inauspiciousness is  
typically followed by a sudden regeneration of fortune.
