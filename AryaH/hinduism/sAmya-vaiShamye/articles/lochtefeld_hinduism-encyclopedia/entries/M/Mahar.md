Traditional Indian society was a collection of **endogamous** subgroups (in  
which marriage is decreed by law to  
occur only between members of the  
same group) known as **jatis** (“birth”).  
These jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group held a monopoly. The Mahars  
were an **untouchable** jati in  
Maharashtrian society, performing various services and labor for the landlord  
communities. The Mahars are famous  
for two figures: the medieval **bhakti**  
poet **Chokamela**, and the modern jurist  
and social reformer **Dr**. **B**. **R**. **Ambedkar**.
