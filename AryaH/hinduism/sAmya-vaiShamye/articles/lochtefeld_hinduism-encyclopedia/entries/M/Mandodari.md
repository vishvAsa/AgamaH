title = "Mandodari"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Mandodari is the  
wife of the **demon**-king **Ravana**, and the  
mother of **Indrajit**, **Atikaya** and  
**Akshakumara**. Despite being a loving  
and loyal wife to Ravana, Mandodari  
continually advises him that he has  
done wrong in kidnapping **Rama’s** wife  
**Sita**. She pleads with him to come to  
terms with Rama before it becomes  
necessary to fight. Ravana refuses to  
do so, because of his pride and his determination to avenge the insult to his  
sister **Shurpanakha**, who has been  
mutilated by Rama’s brother **Lakshmana**.  
In the end, this stubbornness costs  
Ravana his life.
