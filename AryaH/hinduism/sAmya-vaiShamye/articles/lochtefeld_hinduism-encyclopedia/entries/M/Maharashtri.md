title = "Maharashtri"

+++
Southern Indian brahmins who make  
up one of the five southern **brahmin**  
communities (**Pancha Dravida**); the  
other four are **Gujarati**, **Karnata**,  
**Andhra**, and **Dravida**. As their name  
would indicate, the core region for  
Maharashtri brahmins is the modern  
state of **Maharashtra**. The Maharashtri  
brahmins are themselves divided  
into two subgroups: the **Chitpavan**, or  
Konkanastha brahmins, who live in  
the coastal regions, and the  
**Deshastha** brahmins, who live further  
inland in the **Deccan**.
