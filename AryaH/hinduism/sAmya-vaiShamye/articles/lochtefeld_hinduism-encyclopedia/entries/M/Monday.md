title = "Monday"

+++
(Somavar) The second **day** of the Hindu  
**week**, whose presiding **planet** is the  
**moon**. The moon is associated with  
coolness, healing power, and **Soma**,  
the Vedic **deity**. The Hindu god **Shiva**  
is manifested as **Somnath**, the Lord of  
the Moon. Monday is considered one  
of the most powerful and auspicious  
days of the week. Worship on certain  
Mondays is believed to bring even  
greater religious benefits, such as  
on a **Somavati Amavasya**, (a **new**  
**moon** falling on a Monday), and on  
the Mondays in **Shravan** (a **lunar**  
**month** specially dedicated to Shiva).  
The Sixteen Mondays Vow (**Solah**  
**Somvar Vrat**) is performed on sixteen  
consecutive Mondays. Like other  
such vows, the Solah Somvar Vrat  
entails reading the vowâ€™s charter myth  
in a ritual setting, combined with  
worship and a regulated diet.
