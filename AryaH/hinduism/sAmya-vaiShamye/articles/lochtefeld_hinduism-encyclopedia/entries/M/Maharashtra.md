title = "Maharashtra"

+++
Modern Indian state along the Arabian  
Sea, stretching east over the Western  
Ghats to encompass the northern part  
of the **Deccan** Plateau. Maharashtra is  
one of the “linguistic” states formed  
after Indian independence in 1947;  
these states were created to unite people  
with a common language and culture (in  
this case, Marathi) under one state government. It was formed in 1960 by splitting the former state of Bombay into the  
present states of **Gujarat** and  
Maharashtra. Bombay, the capital, is the  
financial and industrial center of modern India. The western regions are heavily industrialized; the eastern regions are  
more agricultural, dominated by sugar  
plantations. Historically, Maharashtra is  
the homeland of the **Marathas**, a group  
whose eighteenth-century empire  
stretched across much of northern  
India. The **Rashtriya Svayamsevak**  
**Sangh** and the **Shiv Sena**, two Hindu  
nationalist organizations that have both  
tried to influence Indian politics, were  
founded in Maharashtra. Along with its  
economic and political importance, the  
state contains many important historical, cultural, and religious sites.  
Historical and cultural sites include the  
rock-cut caves of **Ellora**, a UNESCO World  
Heritage Site; the Buddhist caves at  
Ajanta; and the cave temple at  
**Elephanta** in the Bombay harbor. Places  
of religious importance include the  
**Godavari** and **Bhima** rivers and their  
attendant sacred sites (**tirthas**); the sites  
associated with the saints of the **Varkari**  
**Panth** religious community, particularly  
the temple to the god **Vithoba** at  
**Pandharpur**; and three of the **jyotirlingas**, which are sites particularly holy to  
the god **Shiva**: **Bhimashankar**,  
**Ghrneshvar**, and **Tryambakeshvar**. For

and other regions of India, see Christine
