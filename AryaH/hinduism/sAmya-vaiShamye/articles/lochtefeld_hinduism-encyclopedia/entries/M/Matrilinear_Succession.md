title = "Matrilinear Succession"

+++
(Marumakkatayam) Most of Hindu  
society is overwhelmingly patrilineal  
(organized around the father’s familial  
line). However, the **Nayars** of the state  
of **Kerala** in southern India base society on matrilineal succession (the  
mother’s familial line). Matrilineal succession was practiced from very early  
times, although it had largely disappeared by the middle of the twentieth  
century. Under a matrilineal system,  
both descent and **inheritance** are  
passed on through the mother’s line,  
which is center of the family. The  
woman’s husband lives in her family  
home, but has no claim upon their  
children, and no claim on any of their  
marital property. A man has a certain  
amount of control over his own family’s ancestral property—which he is  
often called to manage—but the property ultimately is inherited by his sister’s children, rather than his own. In  
many cases the woman’s “official” husband never actually consummates the  
marriage, and the woman is free to  
form long-term liaisons with other  
men, according to her choice.
