title = "Mahakaleshvar"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
sacred city of **Ujjain** in the state of  
**Madhya Pradesh**. The temple is named  
for its presiding **deity**, the god **Shiva** in  
his manifestation as the “Lord of Death.”  
Shiva is present at Mahakaleshvar in the  
form of a **linga**, a pillar-shaped image.  
The Mahakaleshvar linga is one of the  
twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network of sites at  
which Shiva is uniquely present. The  
linga is in an underground room,  
reached only by traversing a long, dark  
passageway. This passage may symbolize the darkness and terror of death.  
**Worship** at Mahakaleshvar is believed to  
protect one from an early or untimely  
death, and at death, bring liberation of  
the soul (**moksha**).  
The city of Ujjain has a long history  
as a sacred, economic, and political center. One of the **Seven Sacred Cities**  
402  
Mahabrahman  
(Saptapuri), it also has other important  
religious sites. Historically, Ujjain is said  
to have been the capital of King  
**Vikramaditya**, founder of the **Vikram**  
**Era**. Trade routes that passed through it  
made it economically prosperous.
