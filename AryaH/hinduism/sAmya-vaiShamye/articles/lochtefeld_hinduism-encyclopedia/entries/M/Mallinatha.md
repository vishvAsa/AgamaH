title = "Mallinatha"

+++
(14th c.?) **Sanskrit** scholar and commentator noted for his commentaries  
on the plays written by the poet  
**Kalidasa** (5th c.?); these commentaries  
have become sources for interpreting  
the texts. Although the subject of his  
commentary was largely “secular” poetry,  
Mallinatha himself was a Jain, and may  
have been a monk. His work illustrates  
the important role that the Jains played  
in the preservation of Indian literary  
culture. In addition to their commentaries, they copied and recopied the  
manuscripts, a never-ending task due to  
the fragile nature of the **palm leaves** on  
which they were written.
