title = "Madhava"

+++
(2) (14th c.) Author of the **Sarvadarshanasangraha**, a philosophical encyclopedia composed in the late fourteenth  
century. In this text, Madhava compiles the views of all existing philosophical schools, placing them in  
hierarchical order, based on his judgment of their value. According to the  
text, the **materialist** school is ranked  
the lowest and least reliable, since its  
proponents completely deny the  
virtue of any religious life. The **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** school, Madhavaâ€™s own, is  
judged as the highest and most perfect  
expression of the truth. Although the  
*Sarvadarshanasangraha* is biased, it is  
one of the few extant sources which  
considers the perspectives of all the  
existing schools.
