title = "Man-Lion Avatar"

+++
Fourth **avatar** or incarnation of the god  
**Vishnu**; the man-lion’s form is usually  
rendered as the head and shoulders of a  
**lion**, and the torso and legs of a man. As  
with all the avatars of Vishnu, the ManLion avatar comes to restore the cosmic  
balance, which has been thrown out of  
equilibrium by the disproportionate  
power of some individual. In this case  
the source of trouble is the **demon**-king  
**Hiranyakashipu**, who by the power of  
his **asceticism** (**tapas**) has gained three  
boons from the gods: that he cannot be  
killed by man nor beast, by day or by  
night, and neither inside nor outdoors.  
These boons render him virtually  
invulnerable; Hiranyakashipu proceeds  
to conquer the earth and drive the  
gods from **heaven**. He oppresses his  
son **Prahlada**, who despite his  
father’s power remains a sincere devotee  
(**bhakta**) of Vishnu. The more devotion  
Prahlada shows to Vishnu the more  
abuse his father gives him, until  
finally Hiranyakashipu, maddened at  
the thought that someone refuses  
to **worship** him, is at the point of  
killing Prahlada.  
Prahlada calls on Vishnu for help,  
and the Man-Lion, a being which is neither man nor beast, bursts forth from a  
pillar in the palace. The Man-Lion seizes  
Hiranyakashipu in the palace doorway,  
which is neither inside nor out, at twilight, which is neither day nor night, and  
uses his sharp claws to tear out the  
demon’s entrails, killing him. Once  
Hiranyakashipu has been killed, Vishnu  
installs the righteous Prahlada as the  
king of the realm. This action reveals an  
important truth about the Hindu view of  
reality. Although Prahlada is a “demon”  
(asura), he is not inherently evil, nor is  
he simply a being to be exterminated.  
All kinds of beings have their rightful  
place in the Hindu cosmos—problems

Vishnu takes this form to defeat a demon who  
has conquered heaven and earth.  
come when they gain disproportionate  
power and use it to their own ends.
