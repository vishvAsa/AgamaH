title = "Mathurakavi"

+++
(10th c.) The last of the **Alvars**, a group of  
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
emphasis on passionate devotion  
(**bhakti**) to a personal god, conveyed  
through hymns sung in the **Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized  
Hindu religious life. According to tradition, Mathurakavi was the disciple of  
**Nammalvar**, to whom he was led from  
northern India by a great light in the  
southern sky. By asking a question about  
the supreme spirit, Mathurakavi was  
able to rouse Nammalvar from a yogic  
trance in which the latter had spent  
much of his life. From that point  
Mathurakavi served Nammalvar as his  
**guru**. Whereas the other Alvars were  
quite prolific, Mathurakavi wrote only  
ten songs, all in praise of his master. For
