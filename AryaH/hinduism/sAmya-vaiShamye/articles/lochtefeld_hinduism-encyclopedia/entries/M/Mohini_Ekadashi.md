Festival falling on the eleventh day  
(**ekadashi**) of the bright, waxing half of  
the **lunar month** of **Baisakh** (April–  
May). The festival is dedicated to the  
**worship** of **Vishnu** in his **avatar** as  
**Rama**. Most Hindu festivals have certain  
prescribed rites usually involving fasting  
(**upavasa**) and worship, promising specific benefits for faithful performance;  
observing this festival frees one from the  
results of one’s evil acts.
