title = "Mahendravarman"

+++
(r. 600–630) Ruler in southern India during the **Pallava dynasty**, when it was a  
stronghold of Tamil culture. According  
to tradition, Mahendravarman was born  
a Jain, but became a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva** under the influence of the  
poet-saint **Appar**. Mahendravarman  
was a cultured man and a patron  
of the arts, as well as the author of  
the play *Mattvavilasa* (“Sport of  
Drunkards”), which was popular  
throughout southern India. The rockcut temples at **Mahabalipuram** were  
built during his reign. He fought  
with the surrounding monarchs, especially the **Chalukya** king **Pulakeshin II**;  
it was in battle with Pulakeshin’s forces  
that Mahendravarman met his death.
