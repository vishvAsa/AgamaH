title = "Maya"

+++
A **Sanskrit** word. Maya’s literal meaning  
is “**magic**” or “illusion”; the connotation  
it carries is a magic show or illusion in  
which objects appear to be present, but  
are not. In the Hindu philosophical  
tradition, maya describes how human  
beings become confused about the true  
nature of the world and themselves.  
Such illusion keeps them enmeshed in  
bondage to their desires and continues  
the cycle of reincarnation (**samsara**)  
that comes from this; at the same time,  
however, such people are unaware that  
they are in bondage.  
In Hindu theism—in which the highest power is conceived as a **deity**—maya  
is generally described as one of God’s  
powers, through which the deity can  
accomplish his or her purposes; in this  
understanding, maya is seen as an existing entity. The analysis of maya is a little  
different in the **Advaita Vedanta** school,  
which propounds a position known as  
monism. Monism claims that a single  
Ultimate Reality, called the unqualified  
**Brahman**, lies behind all things. Despite  
the appearance of difference and diversity, the only thing that really exists is  
this formless, unqualified Brahman. For  
the Advaitins, the assumption of diversity  
is a fundamental misunderstanding of  
the ultimate nature of things. The  
Advaita school accepts that God wields  
maya as a power, but since God (as a  
being with particular qualities) is considered lower than the highest, ultimate  
Brahman, both God and maya are part  
this lower reality. Thus, both are ultimately not real. The Advaitins describe  
maya as confusion from the lack of  
correct understanding; the confusion  
disappears when perfect liberation has  
been reached.
