title = "Manipura Chakra"

+++
In many schools of **yoga**, and in the  
secret ritually-based religious practice  
known as **tantra**, the manipura chakra is  
one of the six psychic centers (**chakras**)  
believed to exist in the **subtle body**. The  
subtle body is an alternate physiological  
system, existing on a different plane of  
reality than gross matter, but corresponding to the material body. The six  
psychic centers are visualized as multipetaled lotus flowers running roughly  
along the spine, connected by three vertical channels. Each of the chakras has  
symbolic associations with various  
human capacities, different subtle elements (**tanmatras**), and different seed  
syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed from the  
letters of the **Sanskrit** alphabet, encompassing all sacred sound. Above and  
below these centers are the bodily  
abodes of **Shiva** (awareness) and **Shakti**  
(power), the two divine principles  
through which the entire universe has  
come into being. The underlying  
assumption behind the concept of the  
subtle body is the homology of macrocosm and microcosm, an essential  
Hindu idea since the time of the mystical texts known as the **Upanishads**.  
The six chakras are traditionally enumerated starting from the bottom; the  
manipura chakra is the third. It is visualized as a ten-petaled lotus, located in  
the region of the navel. The petals each  
contain a seed, in this case the consonants from retroflex “dha” to “pha.” The  
manipura chakra is identified as the  
bodily seat for the subtle element of **fire**,  
the power of which is believed to bring  
about digestion. For further information
