(“**shaving**”) In general terms, mundan  
refers to any type of haircutting or shaving done for religious purposes, such as  
the head-shaving traditionally done at  
certain pilgrimage places (**tirtha**). In  
**Tirupati** in southern India, the hair is  
given as an **offering** to the presiding  
**deity**; shaving is also a means of ritual  
purification, as in the rites for the dead.  
In a more specific sense, mundan is  
often used as a synonym for the **chudakarana samskara**, a life-cycle rite in  
which a young child’s head is shaved,  
removing the last residual impurities  
from **birth**. See also **hair**.
