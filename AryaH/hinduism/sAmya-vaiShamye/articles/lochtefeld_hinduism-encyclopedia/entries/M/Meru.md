title = "Meru"

+++
Mythical mountain in the center of the  
continent of **Jambudvipa**, the innermost of the concentric landmasses that  
make up the visible world in traditional  
Hindu **cosmology**; Mount Meru is the  
center of the entire world, the pivot of  
the entire created order. It is said to  
extend far up into the **heavens** and  
have its roots far beneath the earth, and  
on its crest is a divine city which is the  
home of the gods. The mythical Meru is  
often identified with the Himalayan  
mountain known as **Kailas**. For this  
reason Kailas has been an important  
pilgrimage place (**tirtha**), despite its  
inaccessible location.
