title = "Mena"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the  
minor **deity Himalaya**, and the mother  
of **Parvati**, the **goddess**. Mena christens  
her daughter, **Uma**, through her exclamation “U Ma!” (“Oh, don’t!”) when  
Parvati announces her desire to make  
the god **Shiva** her husband. The **Shiva**  
**Purana** details Mena’s initial discomfiture with her unconventional **son**-inlaw, yet later suggests Shiva as the  
paradigm for the ideal husband, since  
he is completely devoted to his wife.
