title = "Mahishasura"

+++
In the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest and  
most important source for the mythology  
of the **Goddess**, Mahishasura is the  
buffalo-**demon** who is responsible for  
the birth of the Goddess. Mahishasura  
receives the boon that he cannot be  
killed by any male and is able to vanquish the gods. They are driven from  
their heavenly realm and take shelter in  
the mountains. While they are there, the  
assembly of the gods let forth their collected radiance (tejas), coalescing into  
the figure of the Goddess, who represents all their collected power. The  
Goddess rides off on a **lion** to challenge  
Mahishasura. He falls in love with her,  
but when he proposes marriage, she  
declares she will only marry the man  
who can defeat her in battle. A fierce  
battle ensues; Mahishasura is defeated.  
He tries to elude the Goddess by changing his form several times, but she keeps  
striking each one with her sword, finally  
killing him by cutting off his head.
