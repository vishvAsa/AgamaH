title = "Mahavidyas"

+++
A collective name for ten fierce and  
powerful manifestations of the **Goddess**.  
According to tradition, the goddess **Sati**  
assumes these forms one after another,  
in an attempt to persuade her husband,  
the god **Shiva**, to allow her to attend a  
**sacrifice** given by her father **Daksha**.  
These ten forms are all frightful and  
fearsome, even to Shiva, showing the  
ultimate superiority of the Goddess over  
Shiva. These ten forms are **Kali**, Tara,  
**Chinnamasta**, Bhuvaneshvari, Bagala,  
Dhumavati, Kamala, Matangi, Shodashi,  
and **Bhairavi**. Some of these forms, particularly Kali, have become important  
**deities** in their own right. For further  
information see David R. Kinsley, *Hindu*  
*Goddesses*, 1986.
