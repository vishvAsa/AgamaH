title = "Mahasaraswati"

+++
In the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest and  
most important source for the mythology  
of the **Goddess**, the text describes this  
goddess in three different manifestations: Mahasaraswati, **Mahalakshmi**,  
and **Mahakali**. The opening story begins  
at the creation of the cosmos. As the god  
**Brahma** emerges from the lotus sprouting from the god **Vishnu’s** navel, he is  
beset by two **demons** named **Madhu**  
and **Kaitabha**, who try to kill him.  
Brahma tries to elude the demons, but  
because Vishnu is fast asleep, overcome  
by the power of the Goddess, he cannot  
give Brahma any help. It is only when  
Brahma praises the Goddess that she  
leaves Vishnu, letting him awake. She  
then clouds the demons’ minds so that  
they can be tricked (and killed) by  
Vishnu. In the pantheon, **Saraswati** is  
the goddess associated with art, learning, and culture—anything involving the  
life and activity of the intellectual and  
aesthetic faculties. Mahasaraswati is  
also connected with intellect, emphasizing her ability to control people’s perceptions. For more information on  
Mahasaraswati and the goddesses of
