+++
Traditional name for the plateau in  
**Madhya Pradesh** centered around the  
city of **Ujjain**, the regionâ€™s traditional  
capital. During the seventeenth and  
eighteenth centuries, the Malwa region  
was one of the centers for the  
**Rajasthani** school of **miniature painting**. The Rajasthani style is generally  
characterized by a flat perspective.  
Visual power is derived from bands of  
vivid colors that often serve as a backdrop to the painting.
