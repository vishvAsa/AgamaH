Local **goddess** considered to be a form  
of **Durga**, whose home is in the northern  
Indian town and sacred city of  
**Haridwar**. According to local tradition,  
the site where her temple is built is one  
of the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of sites  
sacred to the Goddess which spreads  
throughout the subcontinent. Each  
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body  
part of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to earth, taking form there as a different goddess; Maya Devi was Sati’s  
433  
Maya Devi  
navel. Although this claim is not attested  
in other literature on the Shakti Pithas,  
the site itself is believed to be very old.  
One of the oldest names for the  
Haridwar region is **Mayapur**, the “city of  
Maya.” See also **pitha**.
