title = "Maranashaucha"

+++
The ritual impurity (**ashaucha**) caused  
by death (marana). All bodily effluvia  
(**hair**, spittle, pus, **blood**, etc.) are considered to be sources of impurity, but a  
**corpse** is the most impure thing of all.  
Any death immediately causes the most  
violent impurity, affecting the entire  
family. For the familyâ€™s safety, this impurity must be carefully contained and  
managed through the funeral rites  
(**antyeshthi samskara**). Here one sees  
the significant ritual difference between  
**birth** and death. Although birth also  
brings impurity (**sutakashaucha**) on the  
family, because of the bodily products  
attending it, this impurity is considered  
less violent, because the birth of a child  
is an auspicious, life-affirming event.  
Death, on the other hand, is seen as  
bringing bad fortune, and thus the family must not only take care of this impurity, but must also get rid of the  
**inauspiciousness** caused by the death.
