title = "Manas"

+++
(“mind”) In the metaphysics of the  
**Samkhya** school, one of the **six schools**  
414  
Mallinatha  
of Hindu **philosophy**, manas is one of  
the stages in the devolution of **prakrti**  
(primal matter), resulting in the world  
that we see around us, in which human  
souls are subject to reincarnation (**samsara**). Manas evolves from the step  
known as **ahamkar**—the stage marked  
by the first sense of Self and subjectivity.  
The mind (manas) develops as the  
source of intellectual activity which, colored by this feeling of subjectivity, creates the notion of an individual identity.  
According to the Samkhyas, concurrent  
with this mental identity comes the  
development of the individual’s sense  
organs (**jnanendriyas**) and the organs of  
action (**karmendriyas**), as well as the  
subtle elements (**tanmatras**) that are the  
source for the world’s material objects.  
Although later philosophical schools  
largely rejected Samkhya **cosmology**,  
manas became generally accepted as  
one of the five human sense organs. As  
the eye perceives sight and the ears perceive sound, the manas perceives mental objects (ideas), allowing the subject  
to experience them.
