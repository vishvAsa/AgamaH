title = "Muktananda"

+++
(1908–1982) Modern Hindu teacher,  
proponent of a religious path named  
**siddha yoga** (“discipline of the adepts”),  
and founder of the organization named  
SYDA (Siddha Yoga Dham America).  
Muktananda left his family at age fifteen  
to search for spiritual enlightenment.  
His spiritual master (**guru**) was an  
**ascetic** named Nityananda, who was  
widely believed to be an **avadhuta** (a  
person who has shaken off all attachments). Siddha Yoga’s metaphysics are a  
modified form of **Kashmir** Shaivism.  
The organization’s signature teaching is  
that the guru’s spiritual power can  
immediately awaken the disciple’s latent  
**kundalini**, hastening the process of  
spiritual development. This doctrine  
emphasizes the importance of the guru,  
reinforced by Muktananda’s charismatic  
presence. Although his home base was  
an **ashram** just outside of Bombay,  
Muktananda traveled throughout the  
world, establishing ashrams and meditation centers in North America,  
Europe, and Australia. He was succeeded by **Swami Chidvilasananda**. For  
further information on Muktananda’s  
teaching, see his autobiography, *Play of*  
*Consciousness*, 2000.
