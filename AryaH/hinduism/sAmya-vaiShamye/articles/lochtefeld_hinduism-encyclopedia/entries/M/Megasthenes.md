title = "Megasthenes"

+++
(3rd c. B.C.E.) Ambassador sent to the  
court of **Chandragupta Maurya** by  
Seleucus Nicator, a general in Alexander  
the Great’s army who ruled the eastern  
part of the empire after Alexander’s  
death. Megasthenes lived for many  
years in the Mauryan capital,  
**Pataliputra**. His reports of life there are  
the first European accounts of India. His  
original account no longer exists, but  
the fact of its existence is attested to  
by the many references to it in the  
works of later Greek writers; these  
434  
Mayapur  
writers, however, often voice doubts  
about his credibility and veracity. See  
also **Maurya dynasty**.
