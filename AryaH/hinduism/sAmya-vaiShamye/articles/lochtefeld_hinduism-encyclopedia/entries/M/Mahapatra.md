title = "Mahapatra"

+++
(“great vessel”) In parts of northern  
India, the name of a debased **brahmin**  
group whose members gain their livelihood primarily through receiving gifts,  
particularly those given following a  
death. Such brahmins do not actually  
perform the rites for the dead, although  
they are seen as symbolically representing the dead person. Their low status  
stems from this connection with the  
dead; the gifts they accept transfer the  
**inauspiciousness** of death from the  
family to the Mahapatra. This latter  
assumption is reflected in the group’s  
name—they are “vessels” into which  
one can deposit such inauspiciousness,  
and thus be rid of it. Such constant association with death and its inauspicious  
qualities is seen as a highly undesirable  
way to make a living, giving this group  
extremely low social status, despite  
being brahmins by **birth**. Despite their  
debased status, they are a necessary part  
of traditional society, in that they serve  
as the means through which such inauspiciousness can be removed.
