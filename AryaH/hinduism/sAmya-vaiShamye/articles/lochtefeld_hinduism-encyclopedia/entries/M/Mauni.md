title = "Mauni"

+++
Derived from the word **muni** (“sage”),  
mauni designates a person who is  
observing a vow of silence as a religious  
act. Just as members of certain Christian  
monastic orders observe a vow of  
silence to turn their thoughts inward  
and enrich their inner lives, in the same  
way Hindu **ascetics** have taken vows of  
silence as a tool for spiritual development. At times these vows may be for a  
finite period of time (a week, a month,  
and so on), but even now there are  
ascetics who have not spoken in  
decades, communicating through  
expression, gesture, and writing on a  
piece of paper or a slate.
