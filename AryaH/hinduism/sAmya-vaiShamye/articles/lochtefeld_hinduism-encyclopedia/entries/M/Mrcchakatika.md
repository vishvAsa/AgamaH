(“The Little Clay Cart”) Drama written  
by the playwright **Shudraka**, probably in  
the early fifth century. The play  
describes the flowering of love between  
a poor but noble **brahmin**, Charudatta,  
and a wealthy and virtuous courtesan,  
Vasantasena, set in the context of a  
complicated political intrigue. The play  
is noted for its portrayal of everyday  
urban life, exemplified by the little  
clay cart—a child’s toy. It has been  
translated into several languages and is  
periodically performed for modern  
American audiences.
