title = "Muladhara Chakra"

+++
In many schools of **yoga**, and in the  
secret ritually-based religious practice  
known as **tantra**, the muladhara chakra  
is one of the six psychic centers  
(**chakras**) believed to exist in the **subtle**  
**body**. The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system existing on a different plane of reality than matter, but  
corresponding to the material body. The  
six psychic centers are visualized as  
multipetaled lotus flowers running  
roughly along the spine, connected by  
three vertical channels. Each of the  
chakras has symbolic associations with  
various human capacities, various subtle elements (tanmatras), and different  
seed syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed  
from the letters of the **Sanskrit** alphabet, encompassing all sacred sound.  
Above and below these centers are the  
bodily abodes of **Shiva** (awareness) and  
**Shakti** (power), the two divine principles  
through which the entire universe has  
come into being. The underlying  
assumption behind the concept of the  
subtle body is the homology of macrocosm and microcosm, an essential  
Hindu idea since the time of the mystical texts known as the **Upanishads**.  
The six chakras are traditionally enumerated starting from the bottom; the  
muladhara chakra is the first. It is visualized as a four-petaled lotus, located in  
the region at the base of the spine. The  
petals each contain a seed syllable, in  
this case the consonants from “va” to  
“sa.” The muladhara chakra is associated as the bodily seat for the subtle  
element of **earth**, to which excretions  
are compared. The muladhara chakra is  
also considered the locus for the  
**kundalini**, the latent spiritual energy  
present in all human beings, visualized  
as a serpent wound three times around  
the muladhara chakra. Despite its  
associations with the most mundane  
element and the most impure bodily  
function, the muladhara is also  
the source of potential for religious  
attainment. For further information
