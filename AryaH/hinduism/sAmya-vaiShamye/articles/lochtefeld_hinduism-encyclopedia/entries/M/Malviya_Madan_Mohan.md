(1861â€“1946) Hindu activist and founder  
of **Benares Hindu University**. Malviya  
belonged to the first generation of  
Hindus seeking to reclaim India from  
British rule; these men were well  
educated, politically active, and passionately committed to traditional  
Hindu culture. Benares Hindu University  
was founded in 1916 to uphold Hindu  
cultural and philosophical traditions, as  
well as to educate students in the sciences, preparing them for the modern  
world. Aside from his work in education,  
Malviya organized and supported  
Hindu religious causes, in particular a  
ban on **cow slaughter** and opposition to  
a proposed dam on the **Ganges** River at  
the pilgrimage city of **Haridwar**. The  
dam would have restricted the free flow  
of the Ganges, so in 1914 and 1916, he  
spent considerable energy organizing  
opposition so that a compromise with  
the government could be found. For a  
glowing account of his life, see M. A.  
Parmanand, *Mahamana Madan Mohan*  
*Malviya*, 1985.
