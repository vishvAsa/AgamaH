title = "Meter, Poetic"

+++
Indian poetry has well-developed metrical  
forms, basically following two dominant  
patterns. The first metric pattern is  
based simply on the number of syllables  
in a line. In the second pattern, each line  
contains a certain number of metric  
beats, based on the distinction between  
“heavy” and “light” syllables. A heavy  
syllable is any syllable with a long vowel  
or a consonant cluster and is given two  
metric beats; all other syllables are considered light and counted as one beat.  
**Sanskrit** poetry tends to stress the  
former pattern, and has codified meters  
ranging from four to twenty-six syllables  
per half-line, yet even within these syllabic constraints each meter usually has  
a prescribed sequence of light and heavy  
syllables as well. Two different Sanskrit  
poetic meters may thus have the same  
number of syllables, but vary in their  
syllabic patterns. Although such subtle  
differences could generate vast numbers of meters, in practice there were  
only about a hundred. The vast majority  
of Sanskrit texts are written in a single  
meter, the **anushtubh**, which has eight  
syllables per half-line.  
Later devotional (**bhakti**) poetry,  
particularly in northern India, tend to  
favor poetic forms based on the number  
of metric beats. The most popular forms  
are the **doha**, which has twenty-four  
metric beats in two lines, and the **chaupai**, which has four lines of sixteen beats  
each. Although there are several poetic  
forms based on the number of syllables  
in each line, particularly the **savaiya** and  
the **kavitt**, these were used less often.
