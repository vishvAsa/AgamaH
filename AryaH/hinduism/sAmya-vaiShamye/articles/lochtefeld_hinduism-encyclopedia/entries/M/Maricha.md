title = "Maricha"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Maricha is the uncle  
of **Ravana**, the **demon**-king of **Lanka**  
who is the epic’s antagonist. After  
Ravana’s sister **Shurpanakha** has been  
insulted and mutilated by **Rama** and  
**Lakshmana**, the epic’s protagonists,  
Ravana decides to take revenge by  
abducting Rama’s wife, **Sita**. He enlists  
Maricha’s help to kidnap Sita. Maricha  
takes the form of a golden **deer**. When  
Sita sees the deer, she asks Rama to kill it  
for her. Rama pursues the deer into the  
forest, giving **Lakshmana** strict instructions to stay with Sita no matter what  
happens. Rama pursues the deer some  
distance from their home and finally  
gets close enough to shoot it.  
With his dying breath, Maricha cries  
out Lakshmana’s name in a voice that  
sounds like Rama’s, intending to draw  
Lakshmana away and leave Sita unprotected. Given his orders, Lakshmana is  
at first unwilling to leave. He finally  
leaves when Sita, in an uncharacteristic  
display of suspicion and anger, accuses  
Lakshmana of withholding help to  
Rama because he wants to have her to  
himself. At this unjust allegation,  
Lakshmana is spurred into action.  
Before he leaves he draws a magical  
425  
Maricha  
protective circle around Sita, instructing  
her that no harm can befall her as long  
as she stays in the circle. Ravana, in the  
form of an old **ascetic**, approaches Sita,  
**begging** for alms. Out of respect for an  
ascetic, Sita steps out of the circle to  
offer the alms. Ravana reveals his true  
form and carries her away.
