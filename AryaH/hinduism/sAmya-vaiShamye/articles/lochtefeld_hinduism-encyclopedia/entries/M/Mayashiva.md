(“illusionary **Shiva**”) In Hindu mythology,  
a **demon** named Jalandhara assumes  
the form of the god Shiva in an attempt  
to trick **Parvati**, the **goddess**, into having  
sexual relations with him. Jalandhara  
has been unable to conquer Shiva on the  
battlefield, so he hopes that he can  
diminish Shiva’s power by compromising the faithfulness of his wife.  
Jalandhara comes to Parvati in Shiva’s  
form, but she is so suspicious that  
Jalandhara is unable to fulfill his desires.  
Jalandhara’s power is eventually broken  
in the same way, when **Vishnu** (in the  
form of Jalandhara) manages to seduce  
Jalandhara’s wife, Vrnda.
