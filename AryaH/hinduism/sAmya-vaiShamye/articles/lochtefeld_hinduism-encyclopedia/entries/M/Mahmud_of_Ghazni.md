title = "Mahmud of Ghazni"

+++
(998–1030) Turkish ruler whose capital  
was at Ghazni (now in modern  
Afghanistan). Between 1001 and 1027,  
Mahmud made seventeen raids into  
India, lured by the tales of India’s fabulous wealth. His plundering was aided  
by the fragmented political life in northern India, which prevented Hindus from  
forming any effective opposition.  
Mahmud struck at many of the centers  
in northern India, particularly pilgrimage centers, which were renowned for  
their wealth: Multan, **Mathura**,  
**Thanesar**, **Kanauj** (which never recovered after being sacked in 1018), and  
finally **Somnath**, from which he reportedly took tremendous booty. Although  
these raids often entailed iconoclasm  
(the destruction of religious imagery),  
as at the **Shiva** temple in Somnath,  
Mahmud’s fundamental motives were  
economic—replenishing his coffers  
with as much plunder as possible,  
and returning to Ghazni before the  
advent of the hot **season**. As such he is  
different from some of the later Muslim  
kings, such the Moghuls, who actually  
exercised political sway over much of  
India. Aside from his pillaging raids,  
Mahmud is associated with the scholar  
**Alberuni**. Alberuni accompanied  
Mahmud on one of these expeditions,  
later using his observations to write an  
account of Hindu life and culture. See  
also **Moghul dynasty**.
