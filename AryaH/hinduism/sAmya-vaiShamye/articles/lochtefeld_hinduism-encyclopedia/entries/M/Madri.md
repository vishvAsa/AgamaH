title = "Madri"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Madri is the junior  
wife of King **Pandu** and the mother of  
**Nakula** and **Sahadeva**. Neither of these  
children are actually Pandu’s **sons**, since  
he has been cursed to die the moment  
he holds his wife in amorous embrace.  
Rather, they have been magically conceived through the effect of a **mantra**  
given to Pandu’s other wife, **Kunti**, by  
the sage **Durvasas**. The mantra gives the  
woman who recites it the power to call  
down any of the gods and to have a son  
equal in power to that god himself. With  
Pandu’s blessing, Kunti teaches the  
mantra to Madri, who recites it to  
the twin gods known as the **Ashvins**.  
Thus she bears twins. They live happily  
until springtime comes to the forest.  
Under the intoxicating influence of  
spring, Pandu embraces Madri; the  
**curse** takes effect, and Pandu falls  
down dead. Because of her role in  
Pandu’s death, Madri consigns her  
children to Kunti’s care, and ends her life  
on Pandu’s funeral pyre.
