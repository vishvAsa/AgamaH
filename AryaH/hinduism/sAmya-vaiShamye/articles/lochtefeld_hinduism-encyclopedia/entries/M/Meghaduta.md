title = "Meghaduta"

+++
(“Cloud-Messenger”) One of the great  
poetic works by **Kalidasa** (5th c.?), generally considered to be the greatest classical **Sanskrit** poet. The Meghaduta is a  
short poem consisting of one hundred  
verses, written entirely in an extremely  
long **meter** called mandakranta—seventeen syllables to each quarter verse.  
The poem tells the story of a **yaksha**  
(nature sprite) who has been temporarily  
banished to the southern part of India.  
Separated from his beloved wife, who is  
at their home in the kingdom of **Kubera**  
in the **Himalayas**, the yaksha sees a  
**monsoon** rain cloud moving northward  
in its annual journey. He implores it to  
carry a message of love to his beloved.  
The yaksha describes the regions  
through which the cloud travels. This  
description gives a vivid picture of  
everyday life and the cultural centers of  
Kalidasa’s time. In some sources the  
poem is called *Meghasandesha*, “The  
Message [carried by] a Cloud.”
