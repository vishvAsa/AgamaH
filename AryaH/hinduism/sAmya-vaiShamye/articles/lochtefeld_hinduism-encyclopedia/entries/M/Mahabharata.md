title = "Mahabharata"

+++
One of the two great **Sanskrit** epics,  
traditionally ascribed to the mythical  
sage **Vyasa**. The *Mahabharata* is much  
longer than the other great epic, the  
**Ramayana**. At almost 100,000 stanzas,  
the *Mahabharata* is the world’s longest  
epic poem. If the *Ramayana* can be  
characterized as the tale of the “good”  
family, in which brothers cooperate to  
support and preserve their family, the  
*Mahabharata* describes the “bad”  
family, in which hard-heartedness and  
the lust for power in an extended royal  
family ultimately cause its destruction.  
The epic is set in the region west of modern Delhi and describes a fratricidal civil  
war. A greatly abridged account can be  
given as follows:  
**Shantanu** is the king of the Kurus. He  
dies an untimely, heirless death. In a  
desperate attempt to preserve the royal  
line, Shantanu’s wife, **Satyavati**, calls  
upon her elder son, the sage **Vyasa**, who  
fathers children by Shantanu’s two  
wives. The elder son, **Dhrtarashtra**, is  
399  
Mahabharata  
born blind, and thus the rights to the  
throne fall to his younger brother  
**Pandu**. Pandu later abdicates his throne  
because of a **curse**, and goes to live in  
the forest with his two wives, **Kunti** and  
**Madri**, leaving his elder brother to rule  
in his place. In time Dhrtarashtra’s wife,  
**Gandhari**, magically gives birth to one  
hundred sons, of whom the oldest is  
**Duryodhana**; the hundred sons are  
called the **Kauravas**, and are the epic’s  
antagonists. In the forest Kunti has three  
sons, **Yudhishthira**, **Bhima**, and **Arjuna**,  
while Madri has the twins **Nakula** and  
**Sahadeva**. These five sons are the  
**Pandavas**, the epic’s protagonists. None  
of these children are actually Pandu’s  
sons, since he has been cursed to die the  
moment he holds his wife in amorous  
embrace. Rather, they have been magically conceived using a **mantra** given to  
Kunti by the sage **Durvasas**, giving the  
woman reciting it the power to call  
down any of the gods and have a son  
equal in power to that god himself.  
When Kunti first receives the mantra,  
long before her marriage, she impulsively  
recites it while gazing upon the **sun**, and  
gives birth to a shining child. Distraught  
and desperate, Kunti puts him in a  
box and abandons him in the **Ganges**  
River. The child is adopted by the  
charioteer **Adhiratha**, and grows up to  
be the heroic **Karna**.  
As the result of his curse, Pandu dies  
an early death, and Kunti (his wife) and  
his sons (the Pandavas) return to the  
court at **Hastinapur**, where the boys are  
raised as princes. From the beginning  
there are bad feelings between  
Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kauravas)  
and his cousins, largely because  
Duryodhana desires the throne, which  
rightly belongs to Yudhishthira (one of  
the Pandavas). After foiling several  
attempts to kill them, the Pandava  
brothers leave the kingdom to become  
mercenaries. On one of their journeys,  
Arjuna wins the hand of the princess  
**Draupadi**, who becomes their common  
wife (their mother commands that  
Arjuna share whatever he wins with his  
brothers). After some time Dhrtarashtra  
(father of the Kauravas) renounces  
the throne and divides his kingdom.  
The Pandavas build a new capital  
at **Indraprastha**, identified near  
modern Delhi.  
For a little while things are quiet, but  
Duryodhana is not content to share his  
kingdom. He invites Yudhishthira for a  
game of dice, matching Yudhishthira  
against **Shakuni**, the most skillful gambler alive. Although Yudhishthira is a  
model for truthfulness and virtue, his  
fatal flaw is his love of **gambling**. In the  
match Yudhishthira loses his kingdom,  
all his possessions, his brothers, himself,  
and finally his wife. In one of the epic’s  
most powerful scenes, Duryodhana’s  
brother, **Duhshasana**, drags Draupadi  
by her hair into the assembly hall, her  
clothes stained with her menstrual  
blood. Draupadi’s humiliation moves  
Dhrtarashtra to set them free, but also  
sparks the enmity that helps drive the  
rest of the plot. After some bargaining,  
the parties agree that the Pandavas will  
spend twelve years in exile and a thirteenth incognito. If they can remain  
undiscovered during the thirteenth year  
they will regain their kingdom. If they  
are discovered, however, the cycle of  
exile will begin again.  
After thirteen years, Yudhishthira  
and his brothers approach Duryodhana  
for their rightful share, but are haughtily  
rebuffed. All efforts at conciliation fail;  
Duryodhana claims that he will not give  
them enough land in which to stick the  
point of a needle. Pushed to the wall, the  
Pandavas prepare for battle. On one side  
are Yudhishthira and his brothers, aided  
by their counselor **Krishna**. On the  
other are Duryodhana and many  
respected figures, such as **Drona**,  
**Bhishma**, and Karna. For eighteen days  
the battle rages, until most of the important people are dead. Yudhishthira and  
his brothers survive. Yudhishthira is  
crowned king and rules righteously for  
many years. Late in life he installs his  
grandson, King **Parikshit**, on the throne.  
With his siblings he takes a final journey  
into the **Himalayas**. During the journey  
his brothers fall dead, one by one;

Mahabharata  
Yudhishthira eventually enters the  
divine realm.  
The complete epic is more complex  
than this summary. One of the features  
of the epic is that it contains many unrelated tales, for which the main story acts  
as a frame. Aside from being a tale of a  
dysfunctional family, the *Mahabharata*  
also contains a great deal of cultural wisdom, making the names of characters  
symbolic even today. A televised serial of  
the text, which ran for more than a year  
in 1989–90, was wildly popular throughout India. It is also interesting to note  
that many traditional Indian families  
will not keep a copy of the text in the  
house, since it is believed that to do this  
will foster discord in the family.
