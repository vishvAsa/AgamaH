(2) Elemental mercury is a pivotal  
substance in Indian **alchemy**. Hindu  
alchemy analyzes the world as a series  
of bipolar opposites in tension with  
one another. Unifying these opposing  
forces brings spiritual progress and  
end of reincarnation (**samsara**). This  
model of uniting or transcending  
opposing forces is shared with Hindu  
**tantra**, a secret, ritually-based religious  
practice. This theme is shared with  
**hatha yoga**, which is based on a series  
436  
Mena  
of physical exercises that are also  
believed to affect the **subtle body**.  
The governing metaphor for this  
combination of opposites is the union of  
**sun** and **moon**. Both the sun and the  
moon are connected to other opposing  
principles through an elaborate series of  
associations. In keeping with this bipolar symbolism, mercury is conceived as  
the **semen** of the god **Shiva** and thus full  
of healing power. It is also identified  
with the moon (perhaps through its  
bright silvery hue), with healing and  
restorative power, and with the nectar of  
immortality. Elemental **sulfur** is identified with the **goddess Shakti’s** uterine  
**blood**. When mercury and sulfur are  
mixed and consumed, the aspirant’s  
body is purified and refined, eventually  
rendering it immortal. Modern descriptions of this practice warn that it should  
only be carried out under the direction  
of one’s **guru** (spiritual teacher); otherwise these combinations will be harmful, since by itself mercury is a deadly  
poison. For further information see
