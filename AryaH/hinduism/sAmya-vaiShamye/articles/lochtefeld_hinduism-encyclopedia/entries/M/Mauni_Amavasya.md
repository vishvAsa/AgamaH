title = "Mauni Amavasya"

+++
This festival falls on the day of the  
**new moon** (amavasya) in the **lunar**  
**month** of **Magh** (Januaryâ€“February).  
Those observing this holiday pass the  
day in silence. The word **mauni** (speechless) is derived from the word **muni**  
(sage); silence is seen as one of the religious practices helping to promote spiritual awareness. During the entire  
month of Magh, bathing (**snana**) in the  
**Ganges** (or another sacred river) is seen  
as meritorious. Bathing on the day of  
the new moon offers greater sanctity. A
