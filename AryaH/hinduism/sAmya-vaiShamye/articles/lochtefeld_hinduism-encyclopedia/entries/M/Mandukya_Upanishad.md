title = "Mandukya Upanishad"

+++
One of the speculative religious texts  
known as the **Upanishads**, which form  
the latest stratum of the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu sacred texts. The Mandukya  
Upanishad’s underlying concern is to  
investigate ultimate questions, in particular the nature of the Self (**atman**). The  
Mandukya Upanishad is generally considered one of the latest upanishads,  
based on its brevity—a mere twelve  
verses—and on its concise articulation  
of philosophical monism. The first verse  
praises the sound **Om**, calling it the  
essence of the entire universe. The second verse identifies the world with  
**Brahman**, the Self (**atman**) with  
Brahman, and characterizes the Self as  
having four quarters. The succeeding  
verses describe the four quarters of the  
Self, each of which removes another  
layer of egoism: The first layer is  
described as waking consciousness,  
characterized by perceptions of subject  
and object; the next is **dream** sleep,  
which is sheer subjectivity; then deep  
sleep, which has neither subject nor  
object; and finally a mysterious state  
simply called “the fourth” (**turiya**),  
which is the Self itself.  
Further verses identify these first  
three states as corresponding to the  
three parts of the sound *Om*: the vowels  
“a” and “u” (which combine to form the  
vowel “o”), and the letter “m.” The fourth  
state is said to be “beyond all letters”  
and without duality. The upanishad  
explicitly states that to know this brings  
one final liberation, in which one spontaneously merges with the Self.
