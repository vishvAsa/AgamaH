In Hindu mythology, the Manus are  
fourteen semidivine kings, perceived as  
the progenitors of the human race and  
rulers over the universe. According to  
traditional belief, time has neither  
beginning nor end but alternates  
between cycles of **creation** and activity,  
followed by cessation and quietude.  
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion  
years; the active phase is known as the  
**Day of Brahma**; the quiet phase is  
known as the Night of Brahma. In one  
instance of **cosmic time**, each Day of  
Brahma is divided into fourteen equal  
periods, each ruled by one of the fourteen Manus.
