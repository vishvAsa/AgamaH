(2) Fermented or parched grain. In the  
secret ritually-based religious practice  
known as **tantra**, fermented grain is the  
fourth of the “Five Forbidden Things”  
(**panchamakara**), which, in “left hand”  
(**vamachara**) tantric ritual, are used in  
their actual forms, whereas in “right  
hand” (**dakshinachara**) tantric ritual  
they are represented by symbolic substitutes. Fermented grain may have intoxicating effects, but it is also reputed to be  
an aphrodisiac. “Respectable” Hindu  
society strongly condemns the use of  
intoxicants and/or sexual license. Thus  
the ritual use of this substance must be  
seen in the larger tantric context. One of  
the most pervasive tantric assumptions  
is the ultimate unity of everything that  
exists. From a tantric perspective, to  
affirm that the entire universe is one  
principle means that the adept must  
reject all concepts based on dualistic  
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”  
provide a ritual means for breaking  
down duality. In this ritual the adept  
breaks societal norms forbidding  
consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and illicit sexuality in a conscious effort to sacralize what is  
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite  
such ritual use of forbidden things as  
proof that their practice involves a more  
exclusive qualification (**adhikara**), and  
is thus superior to common practice. For
