(“root mantra”) A mulamantra is a  
sacred sound or sounds (**mantra**) that  
are considered to be the most subtle  
form of a **deity**. Every Hindu deity has a  
mulamantra. Different manifestations  
of the deity usually have different  
mantras, which are associated with  
them alone. The mulamantra is usually  
considered to be the highest and truest  
form of the deity, since it is nothing but  
sacred sound.
