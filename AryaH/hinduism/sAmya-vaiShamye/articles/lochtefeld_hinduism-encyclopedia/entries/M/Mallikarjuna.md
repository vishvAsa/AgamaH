+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) on the  
holy mountain **Shrishaila** in **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**. The temple is named for its  
presiding **deity**, the god **Shiva** in his  
manifestation as the “[Lord] White as  
Jasmine.” Shiva is present at Mallikarjuna  
in the form of a **linga**, a pillar-shaped  
image. The Mallikarjuna linga is one of  
the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network of  
sites at which Shiva is uniquely present.  
Mallikarjuna’s charter myth is based on  
a competition between Shiva’s two  
sons, **Ganesh** and **Skanda**, who agree  
that the first one to circle the earth will  
be the first one to be married. Skanda  
mounts his **peacock** and takes off, sure  
that he is faster. Ganesh, however, simply walks around Shiva and his wife  
**Parvati**, as a symbol that they are the  
entire universe. When Skanda returns,  
he is very angry to discover that he has  
been beaten. He leaves **Kailas**, the  
Himalayan mountain believed to be  
Shiva’s abode, and goes to southern  
India. Parvati is very upset at the  
absence of her son, but none of the  
envoys they send can persuade Skanda  
to return. Finally, Shiva and Parvati go  
themselves, landing on Shrishaila  
mountain. Skanda has already departed  
for a nearby mountain. Before following  
after him, his parents consecrate the  
first site as Mallikarjuna.  
As with all the jyotirlingas, Mallikarjuna  
is deemed a very powerful site. Worshiping this jyotirlinga is said to bring the  
increase of wealth, freedom from disease, well-being, and any other desired  
end. The site itself is a difficult place to  
reach, deep in the jungle on the top of  
Shrishaila mountain. For this reason,  
the major festival celebrated here is  
**Shivaratri**, the most important festival  
to Shiva during the entire year, when  
devotees (**bhakta**) come and stay for  
several days.
