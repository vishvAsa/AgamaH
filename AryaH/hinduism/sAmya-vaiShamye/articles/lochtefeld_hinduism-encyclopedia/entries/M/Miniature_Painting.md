The origins of Hindu miniature painting  
lie in the royal art of the Moghul court,  
where miniature painting and portraiture were well-established genres. In the  
seventeenth century other centers for  
miniature painting began to arise, perhaps spurred by Moghul artists seeking  
patronage in Hindu vassal kingdoms.  
Although portraiture and court scenes  
continued to be important, the miniature genre expanded to include other  
themes such as the illustration of the  
musical modes known as **ragas**, which  
are associated with particular times  
and/or **seasons**. Another prominent  
theme was Hindu religious imagery,  
reflecting the influence of the devotional  
(**bhakti**) movement, which was in full  
flower in northern India. Religious  
themes first concentrated mainly on the  
mythic exploits of the god **Krishna** and  
portrayals of the god **Shiva**. At times,  
these two major themes were combined. Miniature paintings were also  
used to illustrate manuscripts, thus  
integrating literature, art, music, and  
religious images.  
The development of Hindu miniature painting can be broadly divided  
into three schools, each corresponding  
to a geographical area: **Rajasthani**,  
Deccani, and **Pahari**. The earliest developed school was the Rajasthani, which  
flourished in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the **Malwa** region of  
the state of **Madhya Pradesh** and the  
small kingdoms that surrounded the  
region. The Rajasthani style is characterized by a flat perspective; visual power  
is derived from vivid bands of colors that  
often serve as a backdrop to the painting. The Deccani style was established in  
central India and showed little variation  
from Moghul court art. The Pahari  
(“mountain”) style flourished in the  
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in  
the small kingdoms in the **Shiwalik Hills**  
north and west of Delhi. The Pahari style  
first appeared in **Basohli**, where the  
influence of the Rajasthani school is evident, and later developed in **Jammu**,  
**Guler**, **Garhwal**, and **Kangra**. The developed Pahari style differs from the  
Rajasthani style in its emphasis on more  
linear drawing—perhaps influenced by  
European art—and a more restrained  
use of color, giving the paintings a more  
lyrical feel. For further information see
