title = "Makara Sankranti"

+++
Religious festival that falls on the day the  
sun makes the transition (**sankranti**)  
into the zodiacal sign of Capricorn  
(makara). According to Western astrology, this occurs around December 20,  
but in Indian astrology (**jyotisha**), this  
occurs on January 14. This is one of the  
few celebrations in the festival **year**  
marked by the solar rather than the  
lunar **calendar**. On Makara Sankranti,  
the sun is reckoned as beginning its  
“northward journey” (**uttarayana**). This  
will continue until **Karka Sankranti** six  
months later, when the sun enters  
Cancer, and begins its “southward journey” (**dakshinayana**). Since the uttarayana  
is believed to be more auspicious than  
its counterpart, the day marking this  
transition is deemed particularly auspicious. Makara Sankranti is primarily  
a bathing (**snana**) festival; great numbers of people come to bathe in rivers  
on that day, especially the **Ganges**. The  
largest bathing festival on the Ganges  
is at **Sagar** Island in state of **West**  
**Bengal** (also known as **Ganga Sagar**),  
celebrated as the place where the  
Ganges empties into the sea at the Bay  
of Bengal.
