title = "Maharishi Mahesh Yogi"

+++
(b. Mahesh Prasad Verma, 1911) Hindu  
teacher and founder of the religious  
technique known as **Transcendental**  
**Meditation** (TM). The Maharishi (“Great  
Sage”) was trained as an engineer, but  
eventually renounced the world after  
meeting one of the **Shankaracharyas**, a  
name given to the most important modern Hindu religious leaders. He stayed  
with Shankaracharya for the next twelve  
years, in pursuit of spiritual knowledge.  
He established an **ashram** at **Rishikesh**  
but was relatively unknown until his  
association with the Beatles, the British  
musical group who came to India with  
him on pilgrimage. In the early 1970s, TM  
instructors traveled throughout  
American college campuses, touting the  
407  
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  
physiological and spiritual benefits of  
meditation and providing people (for a  
fee) with a **mantra** or sacred sound that  
would bring them these benefits.  
According to TM proponents, meditation  
is also supposed to have pacific effects  
on the larger environment, and result in  
reduced crime, tension, and hatred.  
During this period Maharishi  
International University was established  
at the former Parsons College in  
Fairfield, Iowa, as a center to teach TM. In  
the late 1970s, Maharishi University  
instituted a program training people to  
develop the six classical **superhuman**  
**powers** (**siddhis**). Since then several disappointed patrons have won lawsuits  
against the organization.
