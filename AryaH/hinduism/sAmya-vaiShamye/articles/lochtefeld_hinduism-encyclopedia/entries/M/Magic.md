In Hindu tradition there are many different powers in the universe, and many  
ways of influencing them, both seen and  
unseen. The emphasis on magic goes  
back to the **Atharva Veda**, one of the  
oldest Hindu religious texts, which is  
mostly a collection of spells. Even today  
many Hindus accept that certain powerful religious adepts have the power to  
command unseen forces, as well as the  
power to counteract the spells levied by  
others. People who have gained high  
levels of religious attainments are also  
believed to have superhuman powers  
(**siddhi**), allowing them to do things  
that ordinary people cannot. These  
superhuman powers are not seen as  
magical, but rather as the normal exercise of a level of understanding higher  
than most people have attained. Indian  
culture also has a long tradition of illusion, sleight of hand, and other sorts of  
trickery, baffling and entertaining  
onlookers for centuries. For an extensive  
account of these powers, see Lee Siegel,  
*Net of Magic*, 1991.
