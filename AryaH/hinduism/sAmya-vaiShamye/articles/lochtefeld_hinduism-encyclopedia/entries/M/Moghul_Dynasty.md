title = "Moghul Dynasty"

+++
(1525–1857) Muslim dynasty that ruled  
large parts of India for almost 200 years.  
The dynasty was established by Babar (r.  
1625–1630), a central Asian monarch  
who had been displaced from his own  
homeland in Afghanistan and defeated  
the Lodi dynasty rulers at Panipat in  
\1625. Babar’s son Humayan (1508–1556)  
acceded to his father’s throne but spent  
much of his life fighting an Afghan  
threat. He finally recovered his kingdom,  
but within six months died from injuries  
sustained in a fall. Humayan was succeeded by his son **Akbar** (1542–1605),  
considered the greatest of the Moghul  
emperors, both for his long reign of  
forty-nine years and for his efforts to  
include his Hindu subjects as equal citizens, not simply as conquered infidels.  
Akbar was succeeded by Jahangir  
(1569–1627), and Jahangir by Shah Jahan  
(1592–1666). The last of the great  
Moghuls was **Aurangzeb** (1618–1707),  
who added parts of the **Deccan** region to  
the Moghul empire. During Aurangzeb’s  
reign, the **Krishna Janam Bhumi** in the  
city of **Mathura** and the **Vishvanath**  
temple in the city of **Benares** were  
destroyed. Such incidents have caused  
much speculation as to whether the  
destruction was the result of anti-Hindu  
religious sentiments (the Moghuls were  
Muslims) or an expression of Moghul  
political dominance. After Aurangzeb’s  
death the Moghul empire broke apart,  
but the dynasty continued to wield  
diminishing influence until the 1857  
rebellion against the British, when it was  
definitively removed.
