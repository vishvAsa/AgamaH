In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Mithila is the kingdom ruled by King **Janaka**, foster father  
of **Sita**, the **goddess**. The region is  
known for its wealth, as well as for the  
righteousness of its rulers; it is identified  
with the Mithila region in the northern  
part of the state of modern **Bihar**.
