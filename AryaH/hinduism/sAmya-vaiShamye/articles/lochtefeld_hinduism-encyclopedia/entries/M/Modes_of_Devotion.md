Devotion to God (**bhakti**) has been the  
most important force in Hindu religion  
for more than the past millennium.  
However, the form and tone of this  
devotion have varied considerably in  
different times and places. The most  
thorough articulation of different possible modes of devotion was done by  
**Rupa Goswami**, who lived in the midsixteenth century. Rupa was a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna** and a member of the **Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious  
community founded by the Bengali  
saint **Chaitanya**. Devotion to Krishna is  
characterized by the emphasis on relationship, particularly the visualization  
of mythic incidents from Krishna’s life,  
through which one can enter his divine  
world, and thus take part in his divine  
“play” (**lila**) with the world.  
Rupa distinguished five such modes,  
which were characterized by growing  
emotional intensity. The first was the  
“peaceful mode” (**shanta bhava**), in  
which the devotee found mental peace  
through the realization of complete  
identity with **Brahman**. This was seen as  
an inferior mode, since the **deity** was  
seen impersonally, and the devotee had  
no personal relationship with God. The  
other four modes were based on human  
relationships, from the most distant to  
the most intimate and loving: master

Modes of Devotion  
and servant (**dasa bhava**), friend and  
friend (**sakha bhava**), parent and child  
(**vatsalya bhava**), and lover and beloved  
(**madhurya bhava**). Although all of  
these modes were legitimate forms of  
relationship with the divine, the last was  
considered the highest because it generated the most intense emotions.
