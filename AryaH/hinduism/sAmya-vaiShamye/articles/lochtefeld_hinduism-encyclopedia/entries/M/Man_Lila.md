title = "Man Lila"

+++
A divine play (**lila**) between **Krishna** and  
his devotees (**bhakta**). In this lila, one of  
Krishna’s female companions feigns  
wounded pride (man), usually because  
he makes some sort of error, such as  
calling her by another woman’s name.  
For some time she pretends to be angry,  
but is eventually won over by his charm  
and undivided attention. This motif  
of a woman feigning anger—to make  
her lover flatter and fawn over her,  
and to sweeten the joy of the eventual  
reconciliation—has a venerable history  
in **Sanskrit** poetry. In modern times,  
this lila is often presented in devotional  
theatrical presentations, which are  
themselves known as lilas (“plays”),  
since their function is to reveal the work  
of the divine.
