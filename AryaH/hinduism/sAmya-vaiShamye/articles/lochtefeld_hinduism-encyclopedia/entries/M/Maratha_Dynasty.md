title = "Maratha Dynasty"

+++
(17th–19th c.) Central Indian dynasty in  
the region of the western state of  
**Maharashtra**, particularly along the  
Konkan coast of the Arabian Sea. The  
dynasty was founded by the Maratha  
chieftain **Shivaji**, who spent most of his  
life locked in a bitter struggle with the  
Moghul empire. At Shivaji’s death in  
1680, the Marathas controlled only a  
small strip of land in western  
Maharashtra. After the death of the  
Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb** in 1707,  
the Moghul empire began to disintegrate; the Marathas filled the political  
vacuum. At its peak in the mid-1700s,  
the Maratha Confederacy controlled  
northern and central India from coast to  
coast, stretching as far north as Delhi  
and the **Ganges** River basin.  
Expansionism was halted in 1761, when  
the Maratha army was defeated by the  
Afghans at Panipat in the state of  
**Haryana**, a short distance north of  
Delhi. Both groups of combatants sustained major losses in the battle, rendering them unable to contest the arrival of  
the British. A little more than a decade  
later, the Maratha Confederacy had fragmented into constituent states, each  
with its own capital. Of these, the  
Bhonsle dynasty had its capital in the  
city of **Nagpur**, the Holkar dynasty had  
its capital in the city of Indore, the  
Gaikwad dynasty had its capital in the  
city of Baroda. The Scindia dynasty had  
capitals in Gwalior and **Ujjain**, while the  
**Peshwa** dynasty had its capital in Pune.  
All except for the last survived as princely  
states until Indian independence in  
\1947. See also **Moghul dynasty**.
