An important element in the economic  
activity of the traditional and modern  
Indian merchant families. Since farmers  
have profits only after the harvest, they  
must be able to borrow during the other  
times of the year. In modern times many  
farmers borrow from banks, but in  
earlier times their only resource was  
these merchant families. Their interest  
rates usually reflected the borrowerâ€™s  
credit worthiness: unsecured loans  
might have interest rates as high as 30 to  
50 percent per year because there was a  
good chance for default, whereas the  
interest on loans secured by collateral  
might be as low as seven percent. To  
some extent, these moneylending merchants were economically bound to  
their farmer-creditors, with one providing the capital and the other providing  
the labor. Moneylenders could not  
refuse credit to farmers after a bad year,  
since this would have removed any hope  
of future repayment. For further information see Christopher Alan Bayly,
