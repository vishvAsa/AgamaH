(“**Rakshasa’s** Ring”) The only surviving  
**Sanskrit** drama written by the  
playwright **Vishakhadatta**, who is  
believed to have lived in the sixth  
century. The play chronicles the rise of  
**Chandragupta Maurya**, founder of the  
**Maurya dynasty**, and the machinations  
of his cunning **brahmin** minister,  
**Chanakya**. The drama’s plot is highly  
complex, as with many Sanskrit plays,  
but its climax comes when the principal  
characters are dramatically rescued  
from execution at the last moment.  
Although the play is based on actual  
events, historians feel that the portrayal  
of Chandragupta Maurya as a weak king  
is inaccurate. The play has been translated into English by Michael Coulson  
and published in an anthology titled  
*Three Sanskrit Plays*, 1981.
