title = "Mohini"

+++
(“bewitching”) In Hindu mythology,  
a rapturously beautiful, divine  
enchantress, seen as a manifestation of  
the god **Vishnu**. Vishnu takes this form  
to trick the **demons** into giving her their  
share of the **amrta**, the nectar of immortality, which has been churned from the  
Ocean of Milk. Through her charms,  
Mohini succeeds in getting the amrta  
from the demons; she gives it to the  
gods, thus depriving the demons of their  
chance at immortality.  
In most versions, the story ends here,  
but the charter myth for the southern  
Indian god **Aiyappa** adds an interesting  
twist. According to the story, when **Shiva**  
sees the enchanting figure of Mohini, he  
cannot resist her. The product of this  
union is Aiyappa, who is considered the  
son of Shiva and Vishnu. Yet Aiyappa’s  
unusual parentage occurs with good  
reason, as with most such stories in  
Hindu mythology. Aiyappa is born to kill  
a **demon** named **Mahishi**, who has  
received the boon that she can only  
be killed by a person not born from  
the union of male and female.  
Mohini’s “true” identity (Vishnu) satisfies this condition, and when Aiyappa  
comes of age he kills the demon. See  
also **Tortoise avatar**.
