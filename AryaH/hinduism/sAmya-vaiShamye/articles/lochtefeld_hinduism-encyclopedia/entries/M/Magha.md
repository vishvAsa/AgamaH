(7th c.) **Sanskrit** writer whose bestknown work, the drama **Shishupalavadha**, describes the death of  
**Shishupala** at the hands of the god  
**Krishna**. In Hindu mythology,  
Shishupala is a form of **Jaya**, **Vishnu’s**  
gatekeeper, who has been cursed to be  
born as a **demon** three times and killed  
each time by Vishnu. Shishupala is the  
last of these births, after which the **curse**  
is broken. Aside from its mythic theme,  
the play is noted for a number of unusual verses, designed to show the poet’s  
skill. These include verses that are perfect palindromes and ones that use only  
one or two consonants.
