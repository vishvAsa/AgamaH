+++
Festival falling on the eleventh day  
(**ekadashi**) of the bright half of  
**Margashirsha** (Novemberâ€“December).  
As for all the eleventh-day observances,  
this is dedicated to **Vishnu**. Most Hindu  
festivals have certain prescribed rites  
usually involving fasting (**upavasa**) and  
**worship**, and often promising specific  
benefits for faithful performance.  
Faithfully observing this festival is  
believed to bestow final liberation  
(**moksha**) of the soul.
