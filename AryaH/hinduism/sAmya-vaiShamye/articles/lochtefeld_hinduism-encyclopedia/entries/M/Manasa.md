+++
Manasa is a regional goddess considered to be a form of the **Goddess**. She is  
worshiped mainly in eastern India, and  
is primarily associated with snakes and  
snakebites. As with **Shitala**, the goddess,  
whose divine presence was considered  
to be revealed by infection with smallpox, Manasa’s divine presence comes  
violently with snakebites, considered  
a form of divine **possession**. This conception shows the ambivalent nature  
of many regional goddesses who are  
both powerful and dangerous. When  
Manasa appears, it is always traumatic,  
and sometimes tragic; such is the nature  
of human interactions with divinity.  
Manasa is worshiped both to keep  
people free from snakebites—a very  
real concern in an agricultural country  
with highly venomous snakes—or for  
the recovery of a person who has been  
bitten. Her **worship** is marked by  
annual festivals at which people sing  
songs in her honor, and which are  
often marked by divine possession and  
snake-handling.
