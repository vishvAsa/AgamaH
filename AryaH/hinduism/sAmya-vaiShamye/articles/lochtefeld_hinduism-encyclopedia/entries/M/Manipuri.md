title = "Manipuri"

+++
One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are  
**Bharatanatyam**, **Orissi**, **Kuchipudi**,  
**Kathak**, and **Kathakali**. Like much of  
traditional Indian culture, classical  
dance shows strong regional identification; Manipuri is found only in the state  
of Manipur, nestled between Burma and  
**Assam** in eastern India. Developed in  
the eighteenth century, Manipuri  
reflects the importance of **Vaishnava**  
devotionalism. One of the principal  
420  
Manikkavachakar  
dance genres involves acting out  
episodes from the life of the god  
**Krishna**, especially the **Ras lila** and his  
dalliance with his lover **Radha**. In other  
genres dancers play a two-headed drum  
or cymbals, leaping dramatically during  
the performance. This form has roots in  
devotional Vaishnavism, particularly the  
ecstatic singing and dancing associated  
with the **Gaudiya Vaishnava** community  
in Bengal. For further information see
