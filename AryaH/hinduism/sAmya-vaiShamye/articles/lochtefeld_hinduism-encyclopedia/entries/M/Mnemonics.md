The best-known example of a mnemonic  
system comes in the study of the **Vedas**,  
the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
Traditionally, the power of the Vedas is  
not derived from the meaning of the  
words, but in the very sounds themselves. It was imperative for the text to  
be conveyed without error. This posed a  
significant challenge. The Vedas have  
been orally transmitted by an elaborate  
system of learning strategies, keeping  
the text unchanged for over three thousand years, identical in all parts of India.  
This remarkable feat was achieved by  
memorizing the text in differing patterns: as verses, as the individual words,  
as pairs of words in sequential succession (ab, bc, cd, and so forth), and  
according to some reports, backwards.  
The ultimate aim of all of these patterns  
was to render the text into sheer sound,  
rather than phrases with definite syntactic meaning, since the latter could be  
subject to substitutions. Although this  
effort has succeeded in preserving the  
sacred sounds, in many cases the meanings of these words have become  
unclear, especially for words which  
appear only once. This problem was evident as early as the fifth century B.C.E.,  
when **Yaska**, the **grammarian**, wrote the  
**Nirukta**, explaining the meaning of  
many of these words.
