Temple-town and sacred site (**tirtha**) on  
the Vygai River, in the state of **Tamil**  
**Nadu** in southern India. Madurai is  
most famous for the large temple  
dedicated to **Minakshi**, the **goddess**,  
and her consort Sundareshvara.  
Minakshi is a local **deity** who has  
become a major regional goddess,  
whereas Sundareshvara is considered  
a form of the god **Shiva**. After the fall  
of the Vijayanagar empire late in the

Madurai  
The Vishvanath Temple at Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, dates back to 1002 C.E.  
sixteenth century, southern India was  
ruled by the **Nayak dynasty**, with the  
capital at Madurai. Much of the  
Minakshi temple was built by **Tirumalai**  
**Nayak** (r. 1623-1659); his palace is  
another of the cityâ€™s attractions. The  
streets around the temple form four  
concentric processional circuits, with  
the temple directly in the middle. The  
town was planned as a lotus with layers  
of petals, with the image of Minakshi at  
the center, around which all things  
revolved. Symbolically, the Minakshi  
temple was not only the center of the  
city, but the center of the earth. See also
