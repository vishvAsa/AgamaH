title = "Marwari"

+++
Northern Indian trading community  
named after its place of origin, the  
Marwar region surrounding Jodhpur in  
**Rajasthan**. The Marwaris have spread  
all over northern India; many of them  
have become extremely wealthy. The  
Marwaris are stereotyped as ruthless  
and cutthroat in their business practices, yet at the same time, they are  
munificent in donations to religious  
causes, reflecting traditional religious  
piety. The most successful Marwari families, such as the **Birlas**, still control large  
parts of the Indian economy. Marwari  
support and patronage is an important  
consideration for all northern Indian  
political parties.
