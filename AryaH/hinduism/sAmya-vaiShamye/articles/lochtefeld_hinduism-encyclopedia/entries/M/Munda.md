+++
A **demon** general killed by the **Goddess**  
in the **Devimahatmya**, a **Sanskrit** text  
which is the earliest and most important  
mythic source for the cult of the  
Goddess. This text describes the  
Goddess in several different manifestations. The seventh book tells how the  
goddess **Ambikaâ€™s** anger takes form as  
the terrifying goddess **Kali**. Kali attacks  
the demon armies commanded by  
Munda and his companion **Chanda**.  
After destroying the armies, Kali  
beheads the two generals. As a memorial  
of this mythic deed, the Goddess is  
worshiped by the name **Chamunda**, the  
slayer of Chanda and Munda.
