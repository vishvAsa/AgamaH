title = "Menstruation"

+++
In traditional Hindu culture all bodily  
discharges are considered to be a source  
of ritual impurity (**ashaucha**). Women  
are considered ritually unclean during  
their menstrual periods; menstrual  
fluid is considered a source of impurity.  
However, menstruation is also  
considered a sign of **auspiciousness** or  
good fortune, since it indicates womenâ€™s  
reproductive capacities. The ritual  
observances and taboos for menstruating women vary widely between differing social groups. In some groups,  
women are subject to only a few restrictions, such as a ban on entering temples  
during that time. In other groups,  
women are expected to confine themselves to certain parts of the house and  
to refrain from everyday activities such  
as cooking. Although such strict practice  
sounds oppressive, for many women  
this interval was prized as a monthly  
respite from their everyday duties,  
which would be performed by the other  
women in the household.
