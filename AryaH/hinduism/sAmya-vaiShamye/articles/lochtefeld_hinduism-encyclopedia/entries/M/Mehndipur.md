Village in the state of **Rajasthan** in the  
southern region between the cities of  
Agra and Jaipur. The village is best  
known for the temple to the god **Balaji**,  
considered to be a form of the monkeygod **Hanuman**. People possessed by  
malevolent spirits come to Balaji to be  
cured through his power. For a thorough
