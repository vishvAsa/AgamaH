title = "Mahanubhav"

+++
(“Great Experience”) A regional religious  
community, whose members are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and  
who are found mainly in the central  
regions of the state of **Maharashtra**. The  
Mahanubhavs were founded by  
Chakradhar in the thirteenth century.  
Under his influence the community has  
rejected many aspects of “mainstream”  
Hindu religious life: social distinctions  
based on **caste**, the **worship** of images,  
and the religious authority of **brahmins**.  
The community is also noted for  
espousing an **ascetic** way of life.  
Although the Mahanubhavs are considered **Vaishnavas**, they acknowledge only  
one God, whom they call Parameshvar  
(“Great Lord”), and whom they conceive  
as having had five incarnations. Two of  
these incarnations are established figures in the Hindu pantheon, the god  
**Krishna** and the deified ascetic  
**Dattatreya**. The other three are sectarian figures: their founder Chakradhar,  
Chakradhar’s **guru**, and his guru’s guru.  
Their modern practice stresses pilgrimage, vows, and almsgiving. Nevertheless,  
through much of Maharashtra there is a  
405  
Mahanubhav  
legacy of suspicion and mistrust of the  
Mahanubhavs, perhaps rooted in their  
anti-authoritarian history. For further
