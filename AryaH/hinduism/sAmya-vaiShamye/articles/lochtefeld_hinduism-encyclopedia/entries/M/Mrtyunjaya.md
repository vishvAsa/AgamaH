(“Conqueror of Death”) Epithet of the  
god **Shiva**. The mythic charter behind  
this particular name comes from the  
story of the sage **Markandeya**. Devoted  
to Shiva, Markandeya is an intelligent  
and religious boy who is proficient in all  
branches of learning. His story is  
poignant because he is fated to die at  
sixteen. When Markandeya learns of  
this, shortly before his sixteenth birthday, he begins to **worship** Shiva with  
even greater fervor. On the appointed  
day, **Yama**, the god of death, comes to  
claim Markandeya. When Yama throws  
his noose over Markandeya to draw  
out the boy’s soul, it catches the statue  
of Shiva to which Markandeya is  
clinging. Shiva arises from the image  
and kills Yama, saving Markandeya’s  
life. Although Shiva relents and restores  
Yama to life, this particular form of  
Shiva illustrates his power to protect his  
devotees (**bhakta**) from all things,  
including death.
