title = "Mangal Sutra"

+++
(“auspicious thread”) Symbol worn by  
married **women** primarily in southern  
India indicating their married status.  
Married women are considered to be  
inherently **auspicious**, since their  
potential generative power can be  
expressed through socially sanctioned  
procreation. Accounts from several centuries ago describe this symbol as a simple thread, often colored yellow with  
turmeric; in contemporary times the  
mangal sutra is often an elaborate necklace. Wearing a mangal sutra indicates  
that a woman has a living husband, thus  
she is a vessel of auspicious qualities.  
For these reasons, a woman must  
remove her mangal sutra upon being  
widowed, as she must remove all the  
other symbols of marriage.
