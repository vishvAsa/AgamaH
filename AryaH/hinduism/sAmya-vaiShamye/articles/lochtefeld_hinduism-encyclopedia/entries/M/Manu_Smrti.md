+++
(“Laws of **Manu**”) One of the **smrtis** or  
“remembered” texts, a class of literature  
deemed important, but less authoritative than the **shrutis** or “heard” texts.  
This smrti is ascribed to the sage Manu  
and is an example of one of the **Dharma**  
**Shastras**—manuals prescribing rules for  
correct human behavior and ideal social  
life. The Dharma Shastras are usually  
ascribed to mythic sages, reinforcing the  
authority of these texts. Manu’s text is by  
far the most influential of the Dharma  
Shastras and is believed to have been  
composed just before the beginning of  
the common era.  
Manu’s text shows the break between  
the **Dharma Sutras** and the Dharma  
Shastras, for it is plainly intended as a  
blueprint for an entire society, rather  
than a set of rules for a particular **brahmin** group. The introductory chapter  
details the **creation** of the world and the  
consequent social order; the chapter  
ends by summarizing the rest of the volume’s contents. The next five chapters  
focus on the four major social groups  
(**varnas**) and the four **stages of life**  
(ashramas), using material from the  
Dharma Sutras.  
Manu’s themes in chapters seven  
through nine sharply diverge from earlier sources. Chapter seven defines the  
duties of a king. Chapters eight and nine  
423  
Manu Smrti  
treat various legal matters that might  
come before the king for adjudication.  
Manu attempts to put all of these under  
eighteen thematic headings. The material in these chapters encompasses  
all manner of criminal and civil law,  
from assault and theft to contract  
law and marital duties laying down  
a legal framework for the stable  
governance of society.  
The remaining chapters are less original. The tenth chapter discusses occupations that members of the different  
varnas may follow in times of distress  
(**apaddharma**), when normal social  
rules no longer apply. The eleventh  
talks about gifts to brahmins and rites  
of expiation (**prayashchitta**), remaining  
faithful to the Dharma Sutras. Manu’s  
final chapter has a more abstract and  
speculative nature, focusing on the  
workings of **karma** and describing the  
consequences of various good and evil  
acts. The text has been translated  
numerous times; see Wendy Doniger  
O’Flaherty and Brian K. Smith, *The Laws*  
*of Manu*, 1991.
