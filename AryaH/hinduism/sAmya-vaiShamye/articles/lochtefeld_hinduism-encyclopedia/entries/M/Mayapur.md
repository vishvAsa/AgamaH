City in **West Bengal** on the western side  
of the Hugli River across from the holy  
city of **Navadvip**, about sixty-five miles  
north of Calcutta. Although both cities  
claim to be the birthplace of the Bengali  
saint **Chaitanya**, Navadvipâ€™s claim is  
older. However, the claim that Mayapur  
was the birthplace of Chaitanya is supported by the International Society for  
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more  
popularly known as the Hare Krishnas,  
who have built a magnificent temple  
complex at Mayapur as the headquarters of the organization. For extensive  
information about this site, see E. Alan
