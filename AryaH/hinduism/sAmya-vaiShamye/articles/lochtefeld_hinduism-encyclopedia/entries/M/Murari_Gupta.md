title = "Murari Gupta"

+++
(16th c.) Author of the earliest version of  
the **Chaitanya-Charitramrta** (“Nectar  
449  
Murari Gupta  
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account  
describing the life of the Bengali saint  
**Chaitanya** (1486–1533). Murari Gupta’s  
text focuses on Chaitanya’s early life up  
to his southern Indian pilgrimage ending in 1513. The last part of the text  
briefly mentions his pilgrimage to  
**Brindavan** in 1514 and his final return  
to **Puri**, where he lived for the rest of his  
life. Like the other traditional accounts  
of Chaitanya’s life, this does not purport  
to be an “objective” biography; it is  
rather a hagiography (idealized portrait)  
written by a passionate devotee (**bhakta**).  
Nevertheless, Murari Gupta was a contemporary and companion of Chaitanya;  
his text reflects first-hand experience  
and is the most reliable of these traditional sources.
