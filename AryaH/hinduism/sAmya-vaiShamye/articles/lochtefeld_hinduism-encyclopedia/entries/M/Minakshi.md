title = "Minakshi"

+++
(“fish-eyed”) Presiding **deity** of the  
Minakshi temple in the city of **Madurai**  
in the state of **Tamil Nadu**. Her name  
refers both to the shape of her eyes (long  
and oval), and to their fluttering movement, both of which are considered  
marks of feminine beauty in classical  
India. Minakshi was originally a local  
deity, the guardian for the city of  
Madurai. As Madurai became important, by virtue of being the **Pandya**  
**dynasty** capital, so did Minakshi.  
According to her charter myth, Minakshi  
is born with three breasts—already  
a sign that she is unusual—and is  
raised by her parents as a man. As she  
accedes to the throne in Madurai, she  
vows that she will only marry a man  
who can defeat her in battle. She  
fights and conquers all the kings of  
the earth, but when she approaches  
the god **Shiva**, she is suddenly stricken  
with modesty and transformed from  
a powerful warrior to a shy and  
bashful girl. At this moment her third  
breast disappears, further signifying  
the loss of her special status. Minakshi  
and Shiva (in his manifestation as  
Sundareshvara) are married. Their  
wedding is celebrated every year in  
Madurai during the **Chittirai** festival.  
Despite her transformation in the  
charter myth, Minakshi is still an unusual  
**goddess**. The wedding of a goddess  
usually marks her domestication and  
implies subordination to her husband.  
Minakshi, however, remains the more  
important deity in Madurai, perhaps  
reflecting her previous status as the  
city’s guardian deity. For more information see Dean David Shulman, *Tamil*
