(“garland”) This word denotes any sort  
of necklace. Garlands made of flowers  
are ubiquitous throughout India, both  
as **offerings** to a **deity**—around whose  
neck they are placed as adornment—or  
411  
Mala  
given in the same way to any honored  
guest as a sign of welcome and respect.  
Garlands or necklaces made from more  
permanent materials are important  
pieces of religious paraphernalia, and in  
some cases carry clear sectarian associations. Many **Shaivas** wear malas made  
from **rudraksha** beads, an aniconic  
form of their patron deity, **Shiva**. In the  
same way, many **Vaishnavas** will wear a  
mala made from the wood of the **Tulsi**  
plant, since this plant is said to be a form  
of the **goddess Lakshmi**, the spouse of  
their patron deity **Vishnu**. Although  
these materials serve as sectarian markers, malas used for ritual purposes can  
be made from virtually any material.  
Most favored are substances such as  
amber, rock crystal, coral, semiprecious  
stones, and **gemstones**—materials  
which are durable, valuable, and not  
formed by human hands.  
For ritual purposes, malas are used  
to keep count during **mantra** recitation  
(**japa**), by moving one bead through the  
finger and thumb with each recitation.  
Such malas are usually strung with 108  
pieces. Each mala has one bead set apart  
from the others; mantra recitation  
always begins with this bead. This bead  
symbolizes Mount **Meru**, the mythical  
mountain that is the cosmic pivot supporting the entire created order. According to  
established practice, when one has  
reached the end of the mala and has  
come back to the Meru bead, one should  
reverse directions. By virtue of never  
passing over the Meru bead, one is thus  
symbolically circling Mount Meru as the  
center of the universe.  
This connection with daily religious  
practice makes malas powerful religious  
objects, believed to be charged by their  
owners’ spiritual energy. For this reason,  
malas are almost never exchanged—  
except for a mala given by a **guru** to a  
disciple. Most malas are touched only by  
the owner. People doing recitation will  
often keep the hand and mala concealed  
in a cloth bag (known as a gomukh or  
“**cow’s** mouth”), as a barrier to potentially corrupting outside forces. The  
conviction that a mala absorbs its  
owner’s spiritual energy also lies behind  
the taboo on repairing and reusing a  
broken mala. According to popular  
belief, a mala breaks because it gradually draws off its owner’s negative spiritual  
forces. Once broken, a mala should  
therefore be discarded, to prevent the  
owner from coming back into contact  
with this potentially damaging energy.
