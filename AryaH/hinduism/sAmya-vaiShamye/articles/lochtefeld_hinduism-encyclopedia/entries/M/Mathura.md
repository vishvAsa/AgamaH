title = "Mathura"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Braj** region of the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**, about ninety miles south of  
Delhi. Mathura is known as the town  
in which the god **Krishna** was born.  
The **Krishna Janam Bhumi**, purportedly the site of his birth, can still be  
seen today. Krishna was spirited out of  
Mathura on that same night because  
his wicked uncle **Kamsa**, who was  
king of Mathura, had killed all of  
Krishna’s older siblings at birth. When  
Krishna came of age he returned to  
Mathura, killed Kansa, and claimed  
his patrimony. As with sites in the  
Braj region, Mathura is full of associations with Krishna’s earthly life; these  
allow his devotees (**bhakta**) access to  
him, in that they can visualize the  
places he visited, and thus through  
imagination take part in his mythic  
deeds themselves.
