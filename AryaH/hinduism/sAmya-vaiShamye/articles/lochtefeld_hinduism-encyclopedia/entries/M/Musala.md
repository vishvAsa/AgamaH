(“pestle”) A musala is a grinding pestle,  
used with a mortar to husk and grind  
grain. Miniature versions were used to  
grind spices. Aside from its utilitarian  
use, the musala’s long, club-like shape  
could easily serve as a weapon. It is one  
of the characteristic objects in Hindu  
iconography, appearing with images of  
various **deities**—the **Goddess**, **Shiva**,  
and **Vishnu**.
