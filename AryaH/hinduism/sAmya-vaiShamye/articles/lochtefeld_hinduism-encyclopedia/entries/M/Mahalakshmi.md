title = "Mahalakshmi"

+++
In the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest and  
most important source for the mythology  
of the **Goddess**, the three parts of this  
text describe this goddess in three different manifestations: **Mahasaraswati**,  
Mahalakshmi, and **Mahakali**. Unlike  
the goddess **Lakshmi**, who is a sedate  
and propitious married goddess,  
Mahalakshmi is seen as a powerful warrior goddess, the premier divine power  
on the earth. She is formed from the collected radiance (tejas) of all the gods, in  
order to kill a **demon** named  
**Mahishasura**, against whom the gods  
have been unable to prevail. Her climactic act in the *Devimahatmya* is killing  
Mahishasura, despite his desperate  
attempts first to defeat and then to  
elude her. For more information on  
Mahalakshmi and all the goddesses of  
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, *Hindu*  
*Goddesses*, 1986.
