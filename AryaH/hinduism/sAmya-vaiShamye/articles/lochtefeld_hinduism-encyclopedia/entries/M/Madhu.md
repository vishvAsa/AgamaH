title = "Madhu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the two  
**demons** who attempt to kill the god  
**Brahma**; the other demon is **Kaitabha**.  
The story is recounted in several mythic  
sources with some marked differences  
between stories. All versions agree that  
Madhu and Kaitabha are born from the  
god **Vishnu’s** ear wax during the period  
of cosmic dissolution (**pralaya**). As the  
creation of the world begins anew, a  
lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s navel. It  
opens to reveal the creator-god Brahma,  
who is immediately menaced by Madhu  
and Kaitabha. In all versions of the  
myth, Brahma appeals for help, and  
Vishnu tricks the demons and slays  
them. The difference in the stories  
pertains to the **deity** to whom Brahma  
appeals for help. The story first  
appears in the mythology of Vishnu;  
here Brahma invokes Vishnu. Yet this  
same story also appears in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest source in  
which the Mother **Goddess** appears as  
the supreme **divine power**. In this version, Brahma’s hymn of praise is to the  
Goddess, who in her form as **Yoganidra**  
(“sleep of **yoga**”) has lulled Vishnu into a  
cosmic stupor, rendering him unable to  
come to Brahma’s aid. Pleased by  
Brahma’s praise, the Goddess withdraws  
her influence over Vishnu; he awakens,  
and slays the demons.
