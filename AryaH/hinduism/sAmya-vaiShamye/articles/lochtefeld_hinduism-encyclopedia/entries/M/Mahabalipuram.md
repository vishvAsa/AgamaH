+++
Village on the Bay of Bengal in **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, about thirty miles south of  
Madras. Although famous as a beach  
resort today, during the **Pallava dynasty**  
(6th–9th c.) Mahabalipuram was a  
major port, second in importance only  
to the capital at **Kanchipuram**.  
Mahabalipuram has several impressive  
religious monuments, erected during  
the reigns of **Narasimhavarman I**  
(630–668 C.E.) and **Narasimhavarman II**  
(700–728 C.E.). One of the monuments is  
a rock-cut **sculpture** depicting the myth  
of the Descent of the **Ganges**, using a  
natural vertical fissure to lay out the  
river’s path. Other notable constructions  
are the “Rathas,” a series of free-standing  
temples carved from one giant boulder,  
dedicated to the **Pandavas**, the protagonists in the epic **Mahabharata**. The  
most recent attraction is the temple  
along the shore, built during the reign of  
**Rajasimhavarman** (early 8th C.). The  
temple’s major **deity** is the god **Shiva**; a  
smaller shrine also holds an image of  
the god **Vishnu**. Although all of these  
have been weathered by time and the  
elements, they remain some of the most  
visited sites in southern India.
