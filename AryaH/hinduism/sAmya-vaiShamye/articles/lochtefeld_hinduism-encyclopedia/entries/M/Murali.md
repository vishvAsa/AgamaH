In Hindu mythology, murali is the god  
**Krishna’s** flute. As recounted in sectarian  
texts such as the *Bhagavata Purana*, and  
countless vernacular devotional  
(**bhakti**) poems, the sound of this flute  
has an enticing quality that is irresistible  
to Krishna’s devotees (**bhakta**). When  
they hear its melody, they rush to  
Krishna’s presence. The flute and its  
siren song are seen as an extension of  
Krishna’s own enticing presence.
