title = "Mimamsa Sutras"

+++
The founding text of the **Purva**  
**Mimamsa** school, one of the **six schools**  
of traditional Hindu **philosophy**. The  
*Mimamsa Sutras* are traditionally  
attributed to the sage **Jaimini**, who is  
believed to have lived in the fourth  
century B.C.E. The Mimamsa school  
was most concerned with the investigation of **dharma** (“righteous action”),  
believed to be revealed in the **Vedas**,  
the earliest Hindu religious texts.  
Much of Mimamsa thought is concerned with principles and methods  
for textual interpretation, to discover  
and interpret the instructions contained  
in the Vedas. The *Mimamsa Sutras*  
were elaborated in numerous commentaries, the most famous of which  
were written by **Kumarila** and  
**Prabhakara** in the seventh century.
