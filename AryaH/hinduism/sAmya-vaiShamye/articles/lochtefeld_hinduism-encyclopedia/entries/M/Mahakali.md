title = "Mahakali"

+++
In the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest and  
most important source for the mythology of the **Goddess**, the three parts of  
this text describe the goddess in three  
different manifestations: **Mahasaraswati**,  
**Mahalakshmi**, and Mahakali. All of  
these manifestations are extremely  
powerful, but Mahakali is the most  
ferocious of all. She is said to have  
sprung from the forehead of the  
Goddess, as a physical manifestation  
of the **deityâ€™s** rage when insulted by  
the **demon** generals **Chanda** and  
**Munda**, who denigrate her fighting  
ability because she was a woman.  
According to the story, Mahakali is  
black in color, thin, and haggard, with  
long teeth and nails, and utters terrifying cries. She defeats the demon  
armies by picking them up and stuffing  
them into her mouth, consuming them  
whole. She later kills Chanda and  
Munda by cutting off their heads. Her  
final adversary is **Raktabija**, who has  
received the boon that any drop of his  
blood falling to the earth will instantly  
turn into a copy of him, rendering him  
practically unconquerable. **Kali**  
defeats this demon by drinking his  
blood as it is shed, until finally it is  
completely gone. For more information on Mahakali and all the goddesses  
of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
