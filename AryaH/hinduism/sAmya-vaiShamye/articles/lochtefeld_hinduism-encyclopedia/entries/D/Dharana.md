(“concentration”) In the **ashtanga yoga**  
(system of religious discipline) first codified by the philosopher **Patanjali**, dharana is the sixth of the eight elements of  
yoga practice. Along with **dhyana** and  
**samadhi**, dharana is one of the three  
parts known as the “inner discipline”  
(**samyama**), the culmination of yogic  
training. Dharana is described as steadfastness of mind. It is the ability to focus  
on any object, whether a part of the  
body or an external object, and to keep  
the mind steadily focused there. This is  
training for one’s mind and one’s awareness and is an essential prerequisite for  
focused meditation.
