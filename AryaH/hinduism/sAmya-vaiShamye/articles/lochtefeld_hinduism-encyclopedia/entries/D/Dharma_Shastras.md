title = "Dharma Shastras"

+++
(“Treatises on **Dharma**”) In its most particular sense, this word refers to a particular set of **Sanskrit** texts. These texts  
were explicitly written to give guidelines  
for the organization of society, and for  
correct human behavior in that society.  
The Dharma Shastras were written soon  
after the **Dharma Sutras** (aphorisms on  
religious duty) and are clearly modeled  
on them, but have several important differences. With regard to form, the  
Dharma Sutras are written in prose,  
whereas the Dharma Shastras are written in simple verse. The language of the  
Dharma Shastras is close to classical  
Sanskrit, and the writers were trying to  
make their texts clear and easy to understand. In their content, the Dharma  
Shastras treat the same general subjects  
as the Dharma Sutras, but they place  
far more emphasis on working out  
the practical details of a social life,  
particularly the duties and functions of  
the king.  
The final difference is their connection with the earlier Vedic literature. The  
Dharma Sutras were conceived as the  
final element of a **Kalpa Sutra** (complete  
handbook of religious practice), along  
with the **Shrauta Sutras** (prescriptions  
for Vedic rituals) and the **Grhya Sutras**  
(prescriptions for domestic rites). Each  
Kalpa Sutra was associated with one of  
the **Vedas** (the oldest sacred Hindu  
texts), and thus the “family property” of  
the particular **brahmins** (priests) connected with that Veda. A particular  
Dharma Sutra was thus associated with  
a particular group of brahmins, and was  
primarily intended as a manual for their  
behavior. In contrast, the Dharma  
Shastras purported to lay down rules for  
all members of society. They show little  
concern for ritual matters, and no connection with any particular Vedic  
school, but rather profess to lay down  
universal truths. In keeping with this  
emphasis, the surviving Dharma  
Shastras are all attributed to mythical  
sages—**Manu**, **Yajnavalkya**, and  
**Narada**—whereas the Dharma Sutras  
are given human authorship. The  
Dharma Shastras thus mark the study of  
dharma (**dharmashastra**) as a discipline  
distinct from the earlier Vedic literature,  
and applied to society as a whole.
