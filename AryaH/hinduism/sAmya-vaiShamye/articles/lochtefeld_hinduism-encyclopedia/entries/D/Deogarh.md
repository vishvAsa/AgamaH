Small town in the extreme southern part  
of the state of **Uttar Pradesh**, seventy  
miles south of the city Jhansi, in a part of  
Uttar Pradesh almost completely  
enclosed by the state of **Madhya**  
**Pradesh**. It is famous as the site for one  
of the few surviving temples from the  
**Gupta dynasty**, a fifth-century temple  
dedicated to **Vishnu** as the **Dashavatar**  
(“Ten Incarnations”). The temple itself is  
a masonry cube about twenty feet on  
each side, topped by a ruined tower that  
would have originally been about forty  
feet high. In its modest size and square  
construction, this temple shows little  
resemblance to the Hindu temples of a  
later age. However, it prefigures later  
**architecture** in its magnificent carvings:  
in the images carved in panels on the  
side walls, around the temple’s single  
door, and on friezes at the top of the  
walls. The portrayal of the divine figures  
in these carvings is identical to that  
done centuries later, which indicates  
that the images used to represent these  
**deities** were already fixed at the time the  
temple was built.
