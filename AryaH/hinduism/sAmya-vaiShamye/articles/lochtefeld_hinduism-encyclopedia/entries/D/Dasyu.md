title = "Dasyu"

+++
(“slave”) The name used for non-**Aryan**  
peoples in the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu  
sacred texts. The words Aryan and  
Dasyu are an “us” and “them” opposition—in essence, the people who composed the Vedas called themselves  
Aryans, and referred to the “outsiders”  
as Dasyus. Although one cannot be certain whether these names refer to a particular group of people, or any group of  
all, one theory is that the Aryans were a  
people who had migrated from outside  
of India, and the Dasyus were the  
indigenous people in northern India.  
The Vedas describe the Dasyus as living  
in fortified cities, some of which were  
destroyed by the god **Indra**. Some readers have interpreted this image as the  
Aryans’ destruction of the **Indus Valley**  
cities, but there is little historical record  
for such spectacular conquests.  
Other hymns in the Vedas describe  
the Dasyus as dark-skinned and noseless, which is generally taken to mean  
flat-nosed. This has led some to identify  
the Dasyus with the **Dravidian** language  
speakers who now live in southern  
India, since some of them share these  
characteristics. According to this belief,  
the Dravidian language speakers would  
have been gradually displaced toward  
the south as the Indo-Aryan language  
speakers—in short, the Aryans—came  
into India from the north. One piece of  
linguistic evidence for this comes from  
modern Pakistan, in which a small  
group of people speak Brahui, which is a  
member of the Dravidian language family. This Brahui-speaking community is  
entirely surrounded by people speaking  
Indo-Aryan languages, and the simplest  
theory for this anomaly is that these  
Brahui speakers are an isolated linguistic fragment of that earlier time. These  
theories are intriguing, but it is naive to  
read the Vedas as an objective historical  
account, or even to assume that any of  
its references correspond to events outside the sacred world to which they were  
the key.
