title = "Dadupanthi Nagas"

+++
Particular group of **Naga** (fighting)  
**ascetics** associated with the religious  
community (**panth**) established by the  
western Indian poet-saint **Dadu**. The  
Nagas are renunciant ascetics organized into different **akharas**, or regiments based on the model of an army.  
Until the beginning of the nineteenth  
century the Nagas’ primary occupation  
was as mercenary soldiers, although  
they also had substantial trading interests; both of these have largely disappeared in contemporary times. In the  
bathing (**snana**) processions at the  
**Kumbha Mela** festivals (“Festivals of the  
Pot”), the Dadupanthi Nagas march  
with the **chatuh-sampradayi Nagas**,  
who are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**, but are considered independent of them. According to tradition,  
the Naga section of the **Dadupanth** was  
established by Sundardasa, one of  
Dadu’s direct disciples.
