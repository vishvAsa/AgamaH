title = "Dandakaranya"

+++
A particular forest (aranya) in the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Indian epics. This is where the god  
**Rama**, the epic’s protagonist; his wife  
**Sita**; and his brother **Lakshmana** live  
during the latter part of their fourteen  
years in exile, in their **ashram** (abode) in  
the village of **Panchavati**. Many of the  
epic’s pivotal events take place in this  
forest: Rama and Lakshmana’s humiliation and mutilation of the demoness  
**Shurpanakha**, their destruction of the  
**demon** army led by her brothers **Khara**  
and **Dushana**, and Sita’s abduction  
by Shurpanakha’s third brother  
**Ravana**, the demon-king of **Lanka**. The  
Dandaka forest’s actual location is  
uncertain, since many of the events in  
the *Ramayana* cannot be set in any  
particular place. One traditional  
location for Panchavati, however, is just  
outside of the city of **Nasik** in the state  
of **Maharashtra**.
