(“example”) In Indian **philosophy**, the  
examples that are one of the required  
elements in the accepted form of an  
inference (**anumana**). These examples  
were provided as further evidence to  
prove the reason (**hetu**) given to support  
the hypothesis. As a rule, there had to be  
two such examples. One was a positive  
example (**sapaksha**) to show that similar  
things happened in comparable cases,  
and the other was a negative example  
(**vipaksha**) to show that this did not  
happen in other cases. In the most common example of an inference, “There is  
**fire** on the mountain, because there is  
smoke on the mountain,” the sapaksha  
could be “like kitchen” (a place with  
both fire and smoke), and the vipaksha  
“unlike lake” (a place without fire or  
smoke). The purpose of both examples  
is to support the reason given, by showing that this reason gives sufficient  
cause to support the theory.
