(“preceptor’s fee”) Gifts or fees given to  
one’s teacher in return for the services  
rendered. The paradigm for this goes  
back to the **dharma literature**, or the  
texts on religious duty (**dharma**), which  
propose an idealized doctrine for the  
four stages (**ashramas**) of a man’s life.  
The first of these stages is as a celibate  
student (**brahmacharin**), in which the  
young man will live in his teacher’s  
household and commence studying the  
**Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
At the conclusion of his studies, the student will give his teacher dakshina as a  
sign of appreciation. In modern times  
this pattern has been extended to other  
contexts, particularly the arts, and it has  
become customary for students to  
give gifts to their teachers on various  
occasions, particularly on the **full moon**  
known as **Guru Purnima**, which usually  
falls in June or July. Dakshina is always  
given in exchange for services, and is  
thus essentially payment that is “owed”  
for these services. In this aspect it is a  
very different mode of exchange from  
**dana** (charitable giving). Dana generates religious merit, but the donor  
receives nothing tangible in return.
