title = "Dharmaraja"

+++
(“King of Righteousness”) Colloquial  
name for **Yama**, god of death and presiding **deity** of the underworld. Yama is  
responsible for judging and punishing  
the dead, and this threat of punishment,  
at least in popular belief, makes people  
avoid committing evil. This name is also  
one of the epithets of **Yudhishthira**, the  
eldest of the five **Pandava** brothers,  
since his father is the god **Dharma**, the  
guardian of righteousness.
