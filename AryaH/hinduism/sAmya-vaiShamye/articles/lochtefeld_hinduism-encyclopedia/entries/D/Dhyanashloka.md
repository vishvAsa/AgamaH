title = "Dhyanashloka"

+++
(“meditation verse”) A verse or verses  
specifying the physical attributes of a  
**deity** to give the worshiper a mental  
image upon which to meditate.  
Dhyanashlokas are particularly important in the esoteric ritual tradition  
known as **tantra**, in which one of the  
aims is to replace all outward acts of  
**worship** with mental activities. In  
this highly ritualized context, the  
dhyanashlokas provide both a form and  
a focus for one’s interior worship.
