title = "Dhrtarashtra"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, the **son** of the sage  
**Vyasa** and queen **Ambika**. Dhrtarashtra  
and his stepbrother **Pandu** are the result  
of a desperate attempt to preserve the  
royal line of King **Shantanu**, after  
Shantanu’s son **Vichitravirya** has died  
without heirs. Upon Vichitravirya’s  
death, his mother **Satyavati** calls upon  
her oldest son, Vyasa, to sleep with  
Ambika and her sister, **Ambalika**, in the  
hope that the **women** will conceive.  
According to tradition Vyasa is very ugly,  
and each woman involuntarily reacts  
when Vyasa appears in her bed. Ambika  
covers her eyes, causing her son  
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind, and  
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son  
**Pandu** to be born with an unnaturally  
pale complexion. Despite his disability,  
Dhrtarashtra assumes the throne after  
Pandu’s abdication; the latter renounces  
the world after being cursed by the sage  
**Kindama**. Pandu’s two wives have five  
**sons**, known as the **Pandavas**, and  
Dhrtarashtra and his wife **Gandhari**  
have one hundred sons, collectively  
known as the **Kauravas**. The ultimate  
source of conflict in the *Mahabharata*  
stems from the conflict between these  
two royal lines, each of which has a legitimate claim to rule.  
Dhrtarashtra does little to forestall  
this struggle. Although he is generally  
portrayed as a good person, he is also  
weak and unable to contain the ambitions of his eldest son, **Duryodhana**.  
Here Dhrtarashtra’s blindness is not  
just literal, but also symbolic, as he  
lacks the vision and clarity that would  
have allowed him to recognize the  
breakdown between these two families and to therefore take steps to  
avoid it. His disability not only keeps  
him on the margin of daily life, but is  
also a sign of his inability to influence  
the course of events, whatever his  
feelings about them. One of the few  
times that he actually shows force is  
when he offers boons to **Draupadi**  
(**daughter** of King **Drupada**) after her  
humiliation by Duryodhana and his  
brother **Duhshasana**, through which  
she regains freedom for herself and  
her husbands.  
Because of his blindness, Dhrtarashtra  
does not actually fight in the **Mahabharata**  
war, but receives regular reports from  
his bard **Sanjaya**, who has the ability  
to see events at a distance. After the  
Kauravas are defeated, he goes with  
Gandhari and several others to live in  
194  
Dhrshtadyumna  
seclusion in the forest. Six years later  
he is killed in a forest **fire**.
