title = "Danava"

+++
(“descendants of Danu”) In Hindu  
mythology, the **sons** of Danu with her  
husband, the divine sage **Kashyapa**.  
Kashyapa is the chief of the **Prajapatis**, a  
class of semi-divine beings, and Danu  
herself is the **daughter** of the demigod  
**Daksha**, so their children have divine  
**blood** from both sides of their lineage.  
The name Danava is a general term for  
all the families of **demons** (supernatural  
beings), or more properly, **asuras**. The  
asuras are powerful divine beings, who  
have legitimate interests of their own,  
but whose interests often run counter to  
those of human beings as well as those  
of the gods (**devas**). Asuras are thus usually opposed to the gods—a sense of  
opposition carried by the English word  
“demon”—but they are not perceived as  
inherently evil.
