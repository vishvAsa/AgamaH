(“echo”) In poetics—whether secular or  
sacred—the suggestion or connotation  
brought out by the poet’s language.  
Indian literary theorists paid great  
attention to this notion, since attention  
to it allowed the poet to exercise much  
greater emotive depths than the surface  
meanings of the words would indicate  
and pack a much deeper range of  
images and associations into even a very  
short verse.
