+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Duhshasana  
is one of the hundred **sons** of  
**Dhrtarashtra**, who are collectively  
known as the **Kauravas**. The heart of the  
*Mahabharata* is the struggle for power  
between the Kauravas and their cousins  
the **Pandavas**, and the latter are the  
epic’s protagonists. Duhshasana is most  
infamous for his misbehavior toward  
the Pandavas’ common wife **Draupadi**  
after the eldest Pandava, **Yudhishthira**,  
loses everything—including Draupadi—  
in a game of dice. Duhshasana drags  
Draupadi into the **gambling** hall by her  
**hair** and with her garments stained by  
her menstrual **blood**; he also attempts  
to disrobe Draupadi by pulling off her  
sari, but is frustrated here by the god  
**Krishna**, who miraculously makes  
Draupadi’s sari infinitely long.  
Duhshasana’s behavior in this incident only fans the enmity between the  
two families. Draupadi’s husband  
**Bhima**, the Pandava brother renowned  
for his physical strength, vows to avenge  
this insult by ripping open Duhshasana’s  
chest and drinking his blood, whereas  
Draupadi vows that she will leave her  
hair unbound until she can wash it in  
Duhshasana’s blood. During the  
Mahabharata war Duhshasana fights  
with his brother **Duryodhana** and is  
eventually killed by Bhima, after which  
both Bhima and Draupadi fulfill their  
dreadful vows. As an extra measure of  
revenge before killing Duhshasana,  
Bhima tears off the hand that had held  
Draupadi’s hair and beats Duhshasana  
with his own severed limb.
