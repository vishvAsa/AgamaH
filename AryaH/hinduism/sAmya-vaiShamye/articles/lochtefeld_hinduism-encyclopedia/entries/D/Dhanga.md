title = "Dhanga"

+++
(d. 1003) A monarch in the **Chandella**  
**dynasty**, most famous for committing  
religious **suicide** by drowning himself  
at **Allahabad**, at the confluence of the  
**Ganges** and **Yamuna** rivers. The  
**inscription** that records this event  
mentions that Dhanga did this at the  
end of his life—when he had lived  
more than one hundred years—while  
meditating on the god **Rudra**, a form of  
**Shiva**, and further notes that by committing suicide Dhanga gained final  
liberation of the soul (**moksha**). This  
description clearly shows that religious  
suicide was a highly structured religious act, the object of which was to  
help the performer die in a calm and  
composed state of mind, ideally with  
one’s last thoughts focused on a **deity**.  
A crucial element in this ritual was the  
statement of purpose (**samkalpa**), in  
which the performer would state the  
benefit desired from his performance.  
Dhanga’s statement of purpose is  
almost certainly the basis for his assertion that he attained final liberation,  
since this claim is not verifiable in any  
other way.
