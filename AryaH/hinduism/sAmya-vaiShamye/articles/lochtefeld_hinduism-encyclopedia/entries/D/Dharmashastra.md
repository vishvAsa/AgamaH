title = "Dharmashastra"

+++
A general term to denote the study of  
**dharma** (religious duty), whether referring specifically to the actual texts  
(**Dharma Shastras**), or the treatises on  
religious duty or more generally to the  
extensive commentary-like literature on  
these texts. Although the Dharma  
Shastras are generally believed to have  
been written between the second  
century B.C.E. and the early centuries of  
the common era, this literature continued to be written until modern times.  
The literature detailed views on legal  
matters, such as crime and punishment,  
civil law, contracts, and rules of evidence. It also concerned matters of  
social order. The most extensive catalog  
of all these sources is a five-volume set  
by Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), *A*  
*History of Dharmasastra*, 1968.
