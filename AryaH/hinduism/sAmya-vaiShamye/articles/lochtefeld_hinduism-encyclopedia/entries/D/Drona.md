title = "Drona"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Drona is  
famous as a teacher of all the arts of  
war, but particularly for teaching  
archery. He is the martial preceptor to  
both the **Pandavas** and the **Kauravas**,  
the two royal factions whose battle  
for power is at the heart of the  
*Mahabharata*. Drona is the **son** of the  
sage **Bharadvaja**, born through an  
involuntary seminal emission when  
the sage sees a celestial nymph  
(**apsara**). Drona’s skill in weapons is  
gained from the god **Vishnu’s Parashuram**  
**avatar**, who bequeaths both his  
weapons and his skills to Drona as a  
boon. Drona’s skill as an archer is legendary, as is his prowess as an archery  
teacher. Among his pupils he has a particular fondness for **Arjuna** (a  
**Pandava** brother), whose commitment and concentration so outstrip  
his peers that Drona promises Arjuna  
that he will be the world’s greatest  
archer. This support for Arjuna can be  
seen in the story of **Ekalavya**, a tribal  
boy whom Drona refuses to teach  
because of his low status, but who  
becomes Arjuna’s equal as an archer by  
worshiping a clay statue of Drona. When  
Drona discovers this, he demands that  
Ekalavya give him his right thumb as a  
preceptor’s fee, to ensure that no one will  
be Arjuna’s equal.  
During the Mahabharata war, Drona  
fights valiantly on the side of **Duryodhana**  
(eldest son of **Dhrtarashtra**), but is  
finally killed by King **Drupada’s** son  
**Dhrshtadyumna**. In the epic, Drupada  
and Drona have a long history of conflict. They have lived together as students, but after their student life ends  
Drupada becomes the king of **Panchala**,  
whereas Drona is so poor he cannot  
afford to feed his family. On one occasion, when Drona asks Drupada for  
alms, Drupada upbraids him most  
insultingly. Drona vows revenge, and  
after teaching the arts of war to the  
Pandavas and Kauravas, Drona demands  
Drupada’s kingdom as his teacher’s fee  
(**dakshina**) from his students. When  
Drupada is defeated, Drona takes half of  
his kingdom; Drupada vows to get  
revenge on Drona. Drupada subsequently performs a great **fire sacrifice** to  
give **birth** to a son who will kill Drona.  
Out of the fire come two luminous children, one of whom is Dhrshtadyumna,  
and the other his sister, **Draupadi**.
