+++
(“abode of **dharma**”) A no-frills rest  
house for pilgrims. Dharamshalas  
were often built by pious donors (this  
was endowed as a religious act), to  
provide pilgrims not only with a basic  
place to stay during their pilgrimage,  
but also a place with a wholesome  
religious atmosphere. The facilities at  
a dharamshala are generally quite  
basic, and well below the standard set  
by a hotel—in many cases it is a nearly  
bare room in which the pilgrims cook,  
eat, and sleep, often on their own bedding. Until well into the twentieth  
century, pilgrims were under no obligation to pay anything for staying,  
although on departing they were  
expected to leave a donation according to their means and inclination. In  
188  
Dhanga  
most cases dharamshalas now have set  
rates for lodging, but they are always  
cheaper than hotels since the amenities tend to be less. There is also a  
marked difference in their general  
atmosphere and clientele. Most  
dharamshalas still strive to promote  
and maintain a wholesome religious  
atmosphere: by having a temple in the  
building; by holding **worship** in the  
morning, evening, and on special occasions; and by sponsoring scriptural  
readings, lectures, and other religious  
activities. These activities help to create  
a religious community, and those who  
are seeking this during their journey  
will strive to stay in such places.
