title = "Daughters"

The status of female children varies  
widely in Hindu society, based on  
regional customs, the position of the  
social subgroup (**jati**/**caste**) to which a  
family belongs, and the particular circumstances of individual families. In  
general, although the **birth** of a daughter is a welcome event, it brings greater  
responsibility than the birth of a son.  
Parents have a religious duty to arrange  
a daughter’s marriage, and this is still  
taken very seriously, since her marriage  
is seen as the key to her continued material prosperity, as well as her fulfillment  
as a human being. The gift of a daughter  
(**kanyadan**) in marriage brings the parents immense religious merit, but also  
an onerous economic obligation.  
Arranging a marriage in modern India  
usually involves considerable time,  
anxiety, and expense. The last comes not  
only from the expenses of the wedding  
ceremonies, but also from the practice  
of giving a **dowry** (gift to the groom’s  
family) with the bride, which is still quite  
common. In many poor families, the  
birth of multiple daughters is often seen  
as a disaster, since their families will be  
unable to marry them properly.  
Aside from the expense and trouble,  
in many parts of India daughters are  
often seen as “temporary” members of  
their natal families. After their marriages  
they will live in their marital homes and  
become part of their marital families,  
whereas their brothers will bring their  
brides into their natal home and will live  
there for the rest of their lives. It is upon  
these **sons** and their wives that the parents will depend for support in their old  
age, as well as for the performance of  
ancestral rites after their deaths. This is  
the traditional pattern throughout  
much of India; although as the forces of  
modernity have changed the joint family,  
it has become more common for husbands and wives to live separately from  
their parents. This pattern also shows  
considerable local variation. For example, because the **brahmin** community in  
southern India is so small, cross-cousin  
marriage is fairly common there, and in  
this circumstance a woman is actually  
moving from one branch of her family  
to another.  
These economic and social factors  
have sometimes led to unfortunate consequences. Consciously or unconsciously, one often finds that sons are  
favored over daughters in many significant ways: in their access to education;  
in their opportunities, which are  
deemed more important for men  
because of their need to support a family;  
in Hindu **inheritance** laws (in which  
sons get a much larger share, under the  
presumption that they will be supporting a family); and in poorer families, in  
which sons are favored for even more  
basic needs such as food and access to  
medical care. Despite these general patterns, it must be emphasized that many  
families treat all their children with

equal love and care. This is particularly  
true in contemporary times, and given  
the trend toward smaller families, the  
birth of a daughter is cause for just as  
much rejoicing as the birth of a son. See
