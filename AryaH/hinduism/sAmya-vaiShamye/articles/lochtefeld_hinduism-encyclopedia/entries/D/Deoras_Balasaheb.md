title = "Deoras, Balasaheb"

+++
(1915–1996) Third sarsanghchalak  
(“Supreme Leader”) of the **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS), a conservative Hindu organization whose express  
purpose is to provide the leadership  
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The  
RSS is a highly autocratic organization  
that lays great stress on obedience to  
authority, thus the sarsanghchalak  
wields virtually complete power over it.  
During Deoras’s tenure from 1973 to  
1994, he took a much more activist  
stance than his predecessor, M.S.  
**Golwalkar**, particularly in promoting  
the growth of the RSS’s affiliate organizations, in giving the RSS an orientation to  
social service, and in actively seeking to  
recruit members and establish **shakhas**  
(branches) in all parts of the country. For
