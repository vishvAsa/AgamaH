title = "Daksha"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the **sons** of  
the god **Brahma**, and the father of the  
**goddess Sati**. Sati has been given in  
marriage to the god **Shiva**, and Daksha’s  
most famous mythic story has to do with  
this divine pair. According to legend,  
when Daksha feels that Shiva has not  
shown him proper respect, he wants to  
put Shiva in his place—even though in  
this mythic story Shiva is clearly identified as the supreme **deity**. Inflated with  
pride, Daksha plans a great **sacrifice** to  
which he invites all the other gods, but  
as an insult purposely excludes Shiva.  
When Sati learns about the sacrifice, she  
insists on going to it, despite Shiva’s  
warning that it is unwise to go without  
an invitation. When she arrives at the  
sacrificial ground, and asks why her  
husband has been excluded, Daksha  
responds with a stream of abuse  
denouncing Shiva as worthless and  
despicable. Humiliated by these public  
insults, Sati commits **suicide**—in some  
versions, by leaping into the sacrificial  
**fire**, in others by withdrawing into a  
yogic trance and giving up her life. Shiva  
becomes furious when he hears of Sati’s  
death, and in his rage creates the fierce  
deities **Virabhadra** and **Bhadrakali**. He  
comes storming with his minions (**gana**)  
to the sacrificial ground, destroys the

Image of the Hindu god Daksha. His head was  
replaced with the head of a goat as the result of a  
conflict with the god Shiva.  
sacrifice, and cuts off Daksha’s head.  
Daksha is eventually restored to life, but  
with the head of a goat rather than a  
human being. He repents of his arrogance and worships Shiva as the highest  
god. In this story, Daksha is a symbol for  
the foolish pride that eventually causes  
one’s destruction.  
In another mythic story, Daksha is  
portrayed in a more sympathetic light.  
Chandra (the **moon**) has married  
Daksha’s twenty-seven **daughters**, but  
was paying attention to only one of the  
daughters, named **Rohini**. Daksha  
remonstrates with Chandra to give each  
of his wives equal time, and when  
Chandra ignores this advice, Daksha  
curses him to lose his luster. As Chandra  
begins to wane, the other gods intercede  
with Daksha, and implore him to modify  
the **curse**. At their urgent prompting,  
Daksha decrees that Chandra will only  
wane for half the month and then wax  
for the other half. He then directs  
Chandra to take a bath at the **Somnath**  
temple in **Gujarat** state, which will heal  
him from the original curse. Here  
Daksha is still powerful and imperious,  
but his actions are rooted in his concern  
for his daughters.
