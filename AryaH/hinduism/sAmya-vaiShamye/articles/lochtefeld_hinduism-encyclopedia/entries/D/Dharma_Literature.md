Many texts are explicitly or implicitly  
concerned with the question of **dharma**,  
or religious duty. These begin with the  
**Vedas**, the oldest Hindu sacred texts,  
which are believed to articulate the eternal (**sanatana**) dharma. The first major  
texts explicitly devoted to dharma are  
the **Dharma Sutras**, texts written in an  
aphoristic (**sutra**) style between the seventh and second centuries B.C.E. At least  
in theory, the Dharma Sutras were all  
connected with particular schools of the  
Veda, and were thus primarily intended  
as a manual for behavior for members of  
that school alone. The Dharma Sutras  
were followed by the **Dharma Shastras**,  
in which the material in the Dharma  
Sutras was expanded and put into verse;  
these latter texts included instructions  
for all members of society and were thus  
intended to be “legal” in their import.  
Among the earliest was the Manava  
Dharma **Shastra** (**Manu Smrti**), which  
was composed around the turn of the  
common era. The process of rethinking  
and expanding this legal tradition  
through commentary has continued  
until present times, although the most  
significant works were completed by the  
sixteenth century.
