title = "Dalit"

+++
(“oppressed”) Modern name for the  
social groups that have the lowest social  
status, groups that in earlier times  
would have been called **Harijan** or  
**untouchable**. This term is significant  
because it is the name used by lowstatus groups to designate themselves as  
members of a disadvantaged group.  
Adoption and popularization of this  
term reflects their growing awareness of  
the situation, and their greater assertiveness in demanding their legal and constitutional rights. In certain parts of the  
country, particularly in the state of  
**Maharashtra**, the Dalits have formed a  
militant organization called the Dalit  
Panthers, modeled after the Black  
Panthers in America.
