title = "Devara Dasimayya"

+++
Tenth-century devotee (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**, who was much admired by  
**Basavanna** and the other **Lingayat** leaders. According to tradition Dasimayya  
earned his living as a weaver, but spent  
most of his energies propagating the  
**worship** of Shiva. He encountered  
particular opposition from the Jains  
and the **Vaishnavas**, about which there  
are many miraculous tales, but he  
also served as a missionary to jungle  
tribes. For further information see

*Siva*, 1973.
