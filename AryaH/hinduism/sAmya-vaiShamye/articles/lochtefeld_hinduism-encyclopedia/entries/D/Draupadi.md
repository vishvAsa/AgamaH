title = "Draupadi"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Draupadi is the  
**daughter** of King **Drupada**, and the  
wife of all five **Pandava** brothers, the  
epic’s protagonists. This literary reference to **polyandry** (the marrying of one  
woman to several brothers) is interesting, since it seems to have been  
extremely rare throughout Indian history, and the epic has to give an explanation for how this happened.  
Draupadi’s father vows that he will give  
his daughter in marriage only to the  
man who can lift a giant bow, and then  
hit a target suspended in the air. This  
feat is child’s play for **Arjuna**, one of the  
Pandava brothers and the world’s greatest archer, and he wins Draupadi as his  
wife. The wedding party returns home,  
but while they are still outside, their  
mother **Kunti** calls out that whatever  
they have won must be shared between  
them. To obey their mother, each of the  
brothers marry Draupadi. They agree  
that each will live with her for a year,  
during which time the others shall not  
attempt to see her.  
Draupadi’s most famous scene in  
the epic comes after her husband  
**Yudhishthira** has wagered and lost her  
in a game of dice. Yudhishthira has been  
**gambling** with his cousins **Duryodhana**  
and **Duhshasana**, who seize Yudhishthira’s  
gaming ineptitude as an opportunity to  
win the kingdom all to themselves. After  
the loss, Duhshasana comes to  
Draupadi’s chamber and drags her by  
her **hair** back to the gambling hall. Her  
pain and humiliation are compounded  
by the fact that she is in the middle of  
her menstrual period and is not allowed  
to change her stained robe. In the gambling hall Draupadi is paraded and  
humiliated before the crowd like an **animal** at auction, and her property status  
is emphasized when Duryodhana offers  
her his thigh (the euphemism for the  
genitals) as her place to sit. The final  
insult comes when Duhshasana tries to  
disrobe Draupadi by unwinding her sari.  
Here the god **Krishna** enacts a miracle:  
No matter how much cloth Duhshasana  
pulls away, Draupadi remains fully  
clothed. Stunned and confused, he  
finally gives up.  
Shocked by her humiliation,  
Duryodhana’s father **Dhrtarashtra**  
asks Draupadi to choose a boon. She  
chooses freedom for her husbands,  
although they eventually agree to  
spend a period in exile. Even before  
this incident there has been tension  
between the Pandavas and their  
cousins. With these insults to  
Draupadi, however, the seeds of discord are more deeply sown. Because  
Duhshasana has dragged her by the  
hair, Draupadi vows to leave her hair  
unbound until she can wash it in  
Duhshasana’s **blood**, while her husband **Bhima** takes an oath to avenge  
Duryodhana’s insult by smashing  
Duryodhana’s “thigh.” Draupadi’s  
hunger for revenge and uncompromising hatred for these two are a major  
force driving the remainder of the epic,  
pushing all the parties toward the  
inevitable fratricidal war.
