title = "Dvaita (“dual”) Vedanta"

+++
One of the branches of **Vedanta**, the  
philosophical school claiming to reveal  
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the  
ancient sacred texts known as the  
**Vedas**. Dvaita Vedanta’s founder and  
most important figure was the philosopher **Madhva**, who lived in southern  
India in the thirteenth century.  
Madhva’s basic theory is the utter transcendence of God, and this conviction  
leads him to suggest a philosophical  
position known as dualism. Dualism  
asserts a qualitative difference  
between God in his transcendence and  
the corruptions of material things.  
According to Madhva, God is completely different from human Selves  
and the material world, even though

both of these come from God and  
depend on Him for their continuing  
existence. In this dualism, Madhva differs sharply from the major school of  
Vedanta, **Advaita Vedanta**. The Advaita  
school upholds a philosophical position known as monism, which is the  
belief that a single Ultimate Reality—  
called **Brahman**—lies behind all  
things, and that all things are merely  
differing forms of this single reality.  
Whereas Advaita collapses all things  
into one thing, Madhva firmly insists  
on maintaining differences.  
Madhva’s stress on dualism leads  
him to clarify these differing types of  
things, which is known as the “fivefold  
difference”: the difference between God  
and the Self, between God and the  
world, between individual Selves,  
between Selves and matter, and  
between individual material things.  
Even though each Self is believed to  
contain an aspect of God, this fundamental difference gives the Self only a  
limited capacity for religious life. This  
limited power means that final liberation of the soul comes solely through the  
**grace** of God, who alone has the power  
to effect it. Final liberation is conceived  
both as freedom from rebirth and as the  
soul’s opportunity to remain in the  
divine presence forever.  
With its stress on God’s utter transcendence and the emphasis on grace  
as the sole vehicle for salvation,  
Madhva’s Dvaita Vedanta has often  
been compared to the theology of John  
Calvin. Madhva even stated that the  
world had three classes of beings:  
those eventually destined for liberation (**muktiyogas**), those destined for  
eternal rebirth (**nityasamsarins**), and  
those destined for eternal damnation  
(**tamoyogas**). Like Calvin, Madhva did  
not see these categories as promoting  
**fatalism**, but rather that the prospect  
of never attaining liberation could urge  
one to the faith necessary to pursue an  
active religious life. For further information see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
