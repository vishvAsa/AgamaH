In traditional Hindu culture, all of the performing arts had intimate connections  
169  
Dance  
with religious life, and dance was no  
exception to this pattern. In their art,  
dancers merely follow the divine model,  
since in Indian mythology **Shiva** is the preeminent dancer; indeed, in his dancing he  
first creates the universe and later destroys  
it. Several classical dance forms can be  
directly tied to specific Hindu temples. The  
**Bharatanatyam** form developed in the  
temples of **Tamil Nadu** beginning at the  
**Brhadeshvar** temple in **Tanjore**, and is  
immortalized in the sculptures of the Shiva  
temple at **Chidambaram.** The **Orissi** style  
came from the temple of **Jagannath** in the  
city of **Puri**, on the Bay of Bengal. Some of  
the other classical styles were traditionally  
performed only in temples, or had their  
beginnings in religious festivals: the  
**Kathakali** form in the state of **Kerala**, the  
**Kuchipudi** form in **Andhra Pradesh**, the  
**Chau** form in eastern India, and the  
**Manipuri** form in Manipur. The only  
exception is the northern Indian **Kathak**  
form, whose birth and performance lay in  
a court rather than a temple setting, but  
which in its subject matter often treated  
religious themes, particularly ones drawn  
from devotion to the god **Krishna**.  
All of these styles share a highly articulated language of **gesture** (**mudra**) and  
expression, through which the dancer  
can tell a story to the audience. As in all  
the classical arts, the dancer’s aim is not  
only to entertain, but to create and convey a particular aesthetic mood (**rasa**),  
which will evoke a corresponding emotion (**bhava**) from the audience. Beyond  
these general similarities, each form has  
a certain characteristic and stylistic  
quality. Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and  
Orissi are the most clearly related forms,  
but where Bharatanatyam presents a  
sharply geometric line, with a stiff upper  
body, the lines presented by Kuchipudi  
and Orissi are progressively softer,  
rounder, and more fluid. Kathakali is  
characterized by elaborate costumes  
and stage makeup, and also by its particular stress on developing and controlling facial mobility. These things  
facilitate ease and power of expression.  
Manipuri and Chau are both highly  
athletic forms, clearly showing the  
influence of folk dance, and Chau is  
unusual in that the dancers always  
wear masks, which sets a prevailing  
mood. Kathak is the only dance form in  
which the legs are kept straight; this  
form stresses intricate footwork in  
which the bells on the dancer’s ankles  
serve as a complement and counterpoint to the drum, combined with dramatic turns and spins.  
As mentioned above, all the dance  
forms except for Kathak developed in  
some sort of religious context. In many  
of these latter cases, dance was an **offering** presented to the **deity**, and was  
primarily performed for the deity’s  
entertainment, although the other

Dancers performing in the Manipuri style.  
spectators could enjoy it, as well.  
Although different schools have different typologies, the most pervasive distinction is between “pure” dance  
(**nrtya**), conveying nothing beyond the  
dancer’s skill in movement, and “acting”  
dance (**natya** or **abhinaya**), in which the  
dancer tells some sort of story. Until the  
twentieth century, the dancers were  
usually temple servants known as  
**devadasis**. The devadasis were officially  
married to the temple’s deity and performed various ritual services in the  
temples as his “wives,” but they could  
have liaisons with other men as they  
wished. Any children from these liaisons  
would also be in the service of the temple—their **sons** as musicians, and their  
**daughters** as dancers. At times this  
arrangement degenerated into common  
**prostitution**, but in many cases it was  
recognizably different. These **women**  
had status and property of their own,  
even though their status was unusual,  
and thus marginal. In the twentieth century the dance performance site has  
moved from the temple to the stage,  
which has had a number of effects on  
transforming it from a form of **worship**  
to a performing art. For further information on the history of the dance and its  
particular manifestations, see Mohan
