(“School of Manners”) An outside  
source for the religious life of the times,  
and gives the earliest detailed description of the Sikhs, as well as many other  
contemporary religious communities.  
The text traditionally is ascribed to  
**Muhsin Fani**. Fani was a Persian who  
traveled through much of northern  
India, apparently motivated only by his  
intense curiosity to encounter the  
country’s different forms of religious  
life. The text is also notable for the  
seeming absence of authorial bias—  
Fani reports that he had simply translated  
what his friends and informants had  
told him, and the *Dabistan’s* tone seems  
to maintain this claim. The text has  
been translated by David Shea and  
Anthony Troyer as *The Dabistan, or*  
*School of Manners*, 1843.
