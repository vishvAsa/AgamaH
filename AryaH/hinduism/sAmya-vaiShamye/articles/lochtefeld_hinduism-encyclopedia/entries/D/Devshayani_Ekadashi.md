Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the bright (waxing) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Ashadh** (June-July).  
This is celebrated as the day on which  
the god **Vishnu** falls asleep on his serpent couch **Shesha**, and remains sleeping for four lunar months, waking up on  
**Devotthayan Ekadashi**. This fourmonth period (**chaturmas**) is considered unlucky and ritually dangerous,  
since it is a period when the god is considered to be insensible. Weddings are  
generally not performed during this  
period, nor is any other life-cycle rite  
that can be postponed. This festival  
coincides with the advent of the rainy  
**season**, and the ambivalence connected  
with the rains can be seen here. On one  
hand, the rains are essential to the  
crops, and thus foster life and fertility.  
On the other hand, the rains also bring  
all too real dangers from snakes, scorpions, and gastrointestinal infections.
