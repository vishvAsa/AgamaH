title = "Deva"

The word deva literally means “shining  
one,” although the most common (and  
often most appropriate) translation is  
“god.” This word is an epithet for any  
superhuman being, although it can also  
be used figuratively for any person of  
high status, such as a king or a **brahmin**  
(priest). The notion of “gods” in  
Hinduism must be understood in  
light of the generally assumed context  
of reincarnation (**samsara**), which  
assumes that a person can be reborn in  
many different realms of reality. Some of  
these are realms of punishment where  
people atone for the effects of their bad  
**karma**, while others are realms of pleasure (the **heavens**) where people enjoy  
the results of their good karma. The  
devas are the inhabitants of these heavens, and are thus “gods,” since gods, by  
definition, live in heaven.  
Yet all these gods are still subject to  
the vicissitudes of reincarnation—even  
**Indra**, the ruler of heaven. **Birth** in  
heaven is based on one’s good karma,  
which is inevitably diminished by enjoying the rewards of life in heaven, just as  
a savings account is depleted by continuing withdrawals. When their good  
karma has been exhausted, even the  
gods are subject to rebirth in other  
realms. So even though these gods are  
superhuman, they are still subject to the  
law of reincarnation. There is thus a  
qualitative difference between these  
gods (the devas) and the so-called Great  
gods, such as **Vishnu**, **Shiva**, and the  
**Goddess**. These latter **deities** are seen by  
their devotees (**bhakta**) as totally outside the realm of **space**, time, and the  
causes and effects of karma, and thus  
correspond more directly to the JudeoChristian notion of “God,” as the ultimate power in the universe.
