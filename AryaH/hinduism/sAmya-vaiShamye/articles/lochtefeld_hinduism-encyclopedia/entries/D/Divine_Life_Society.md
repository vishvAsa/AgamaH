title = "Divine Life Society"

+++
Religious organization founded in 1936  
by **Swami Shivananda**. It is headquartered at the Divine Life **Ashram**, just  
outside the holy city of **Rishikesh** on the  
river **Ganges** in the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. Although Shivananda himself  
died in 1963, the society is still quite  
active in spreading the ways of Hindu  
life: through **yoga** (self-discipline) training programs at the Divine Life Ashram;  
through publishing religious texts, both  
traditional scriptures and the teachings  
of Swami Shivananda; through establishing religious centers throughout the  
world; and through various social service projects in India itself. Swami  
Shivananda was a **Dashanami Sanyasi**  
(**ascetic**) in the **Saraswati** division,  
which is one of the divisions that admits  
only **brahmins** (priests). The Swami’s  
brahmin background comes through in  
the organization’s teachings, which  
stress **vegetarianism**, rigorous spiritual  
development, an emphasis on learning,  
and a strict moral code. For all these reasons the organization is widely respected in  
Indian society, despite having a significant  
number of foreign practitioners.
