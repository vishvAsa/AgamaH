title = "Dikshanama"

+++
(“**diksha** name”) Name given to a  
person after receiving **initiation**  
(diksha), as a way of acknowledging and  
reinforcing the new identity created by  
the act of initiation. Sometimes, as in  
the case of **ascetic** initiation, the  
initiate’s former name will be replaced  
with the dikshanama. In other cases the  
name will be kept secret, as a source of  
hidden power.
