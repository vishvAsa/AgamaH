(“**space**-clad,” i.e., naked) In a general  
**ascetic** context, this can refer to any  
ascetic who is completely naked, which  
is a sign of having renounced all **possessions** and all worldly conventions.  
Among the **Bairagi Nagas**, or renunciant  
ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Vishnu** and who formerly made their  
living as traders and mercenary soldiers,  
the Digambaras are one of the three  
**Naga anis** (“armies”), the others being  
the **Nirmohis** and **Nirvanis**. In earlier  
times these anis were actual fighting  
units, but in modern times are mainly  
important for determining bathing  
(**snana**) order in the bathing processions at the **Kumbha Mela** (“Festival of  
the Pot”). Of the three, the Digambaras  
are by far the most important, and at the  
time of the Kumbha Mela take precedence over the others.
