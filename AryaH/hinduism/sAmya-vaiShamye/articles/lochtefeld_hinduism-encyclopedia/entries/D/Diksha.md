title = "Diksha"

+++
(“**initiation**”) A religious initiation  
involving the reception of secret religious teachings; the term is said to be  
derived from the verb *dis*, “to point out.”  
The word diksha carries a different  
sense from the life-cycle rite known as  
**upanayana**, the adolescent religious initiation that is the ritualized “second  
birth” conferred on young men from the  
three “**twice-born**” groups—that is,  
**brahmin** (priestly), **kshatriya** (martial),  
or **vaishya** (mercantile). Both are  
religious initiations, and both involve  
the creation of new capacities and  
entitlements. Yet diksha is not a rite  
usually seen as a transition point in the  
life cycle, but a religious initiation in  
which the initiate gains secret knowledge from a religious teacher (**guru**),  
usually given in the form of the verbal  
formulas known as **mantras**. Whereas  
upanayana takes place while a boy is  
an adolescent, the time for diksha  
is based not on physical age, but  
on a person’s willingness and  
readiness. Diksha is a particularly  
important concept in the ritual  
tradition known as **tantra**, in which  
such personalized initiations are the  
way of transmitting the tradition from  
master to student.
