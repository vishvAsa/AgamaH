title = "Dhrshtadyumna"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Dhrshtadyumna is  
the **son** of King **Drupada** and the brother  
of **Draupadi**, King Drupada’s **daughter**.  
Dhrshtadyumna and Draupadi are magically born by emerging from a sacrificial **fire**. Their father sponsors this rite of  
**sacrifice** to give **birth** to a hero who will  
kill **Drona**, who has taken away half of  
Drupada’s kingdom after being insulted  
by Drupada. Drona accepts the boy as a  
pupil and teaches him the martial arts.  
Even though a heavenly voice has  
announced that the boy will eventually  
kill him, he does this under the conviction that fate cannot be avoided.  
Dhrshtadyumna is instrumental in  
arranging Draupadi’s marriage to the  
five **Pandava** brothers, the epic’s protagonists, and he fights on their side during  
the Mahabharata war. Dhrshtadyumna  
fights fiercely in the war and eventually  
kills Drona by cutting off his head, thereby avenging his father’s defeat. Yet his  
triumph is short-lived, for that very  
night Dhrshtadyumna is killed by  
Drona’s son **Ashvatthama**, who secretly  
gains entry to the Pandava camp and  
kicks Dhrshtadyumna to death.
