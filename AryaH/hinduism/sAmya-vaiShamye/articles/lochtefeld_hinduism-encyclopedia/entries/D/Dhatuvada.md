Hindu branch of the Indian tradition of  
**alchemy**, which seeks to transform,  
transmute, and perfect the body  
through the use of various chemicals  
with the ultimate goal of rendering the  
192  
Dharna  
body immortal. Just as both Hindus and  
Buddhists appropriated the idea of **yoga**  
(act of discipline), both traditions  
also have alchemical schools. The  
Dhatuvada school stressed seeking bodily perfection solely through consuming  
**drugs** and potions, particularly ones  
compounded from **mercury** and  
**cinnabar**. This is theoretically different  
from the Buddhist **Rasayana** school,  
since the latter is said to use such material means only to prolong life until the  
body can be transmuted through meditation, ritual, and yoga. The conceptual  
foundation for Hindu alchemy is its  
analysis of the world as a series of bipolar opposites, and the conviction that  
unifying these opposing forces brings  
spiritual progress and the end of reincarnation (**samsara**). The governing  
metaphor for this combination of opposites is the union of **sun** and **moon**. In  
keeping with this bipolar symbolism,  
both the sun and the moon are connected to other opposing principles through  
an elaborate series of associations. The  
sun is identified with heat, drying  
power, **fire**, the **goddess Shakti**, and  
menstrual **blood**; the moon with coolness,  
healing power, **water**, the god **Shiva**,  
and **semen**. In alchemical practice, the  
two essential chemical elements are mercury and **sulfur**—the former identified  
with Shiva’s semen, and the latter with  
Shakti’s uterine blood. Through properly  
mixing and consuming these elements,  
the impure body is purified and refined,  
eventually rendering it immortal.  
Modern descriptions of this practice  
invariably warn that it should only be carried out under the direction of one’s **guru**  
(spiritual teacher); otherwise these combinations will be harmful. This warning is  
not surprising, since by itself mercury is a  
deadly poison. For further information
