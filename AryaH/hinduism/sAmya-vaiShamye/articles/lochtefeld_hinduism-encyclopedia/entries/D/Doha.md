title = "Doha"

+++
Metrical form in northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poetry, made up of  
two lines of twenty-four metric beats,  
divided unevenly after the thirteenth  
beat. The metric pattern for the first  
line is 6 + 4 + 3, with the second line  
being 6 + 4 + 1. The method of counting  
the metric beats is based on the  
distinction between “heavy” and “light”  
syllables. A heavy syllable is any syllable  
with a long vowel or a consonant cluster  
and is reckoned at two metric beats; all  
other syllables are reckoned as light, and  
reckoned as one. Aside from the metric  
pattern, there are rules about how each  
half line should end—that the three  
metric beats ending the first line cannot  
be a heavy syllable (two beats) followed  
by a light one (one beat)—which means  
that it must either be a light syllable  
followed by a heavy one, or three light  
ones—and that the line’s final syllable  
must be light. These conventions still  
leave a great deal of fluidity, and the  
doha is one of the most important  
poetic forms for poets writing in **Braj**  
**Bhasha** (the language of **Krishna**  
devotion) and **Avadhi** (a dialect of  
medieval **Hindi**). At times the doha can  
stand alone, as in the epigrams of the  
poet-saint **Kabir**, which have become  
proverbial sayings in much of modern  
India. The doha was also used in conjunction with verses in other meters,  
as in the **Ramcharitmanas**. In this  
vernacular rendition of the epic  
**Ramayana**, written by the poet-saint  
**Tulsidas**, the doha usually comes after  
four verses in the **chaupai** (four-line)  
**meter**, and serves to sum up what has  
transpired in the preceding verses.
