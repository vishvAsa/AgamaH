title = "Devar"

+++
In the northern Indian joint family, the  
term designating a husband’s younger  
brother. The traditional Indian joint  
family is headed by a husband and wife.  
The couple’s **sons**, the sons’ wives, and  
unmarried **daughters** live with them.  
The married daughters live with their  
husbands’ joint families. The joint family  
is not just a group of people living  
together. The good of the family is given

higher value than any individual’s  
desires. Traditional Indian society was  
highly status-conscious, a trait reflected  
not only in the traditional hierarchical  
conception of society, but also in similar  
conceptions within the family. Based on  
these assumptions, there are different  
words for all sorts of relationships in the  
Indian family. These words are based  
partly on a person’s age in relation to the  
speaker, whether he is related by blood  
or by marriage, and whether blood relatives come from the mother’s or the  
father’s side of the family. Since a  
woman’s devar is younger than her husband, he is considered a person of less  
exalted status, and thus someone with  
whom she may have a more familiar  
“**joking relationship**.”
