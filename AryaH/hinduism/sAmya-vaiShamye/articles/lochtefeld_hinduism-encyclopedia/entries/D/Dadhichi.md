title = "Dadhichi"

+++
A sage in Hindu mythology who is a paradigm for self-sacrifice. The gods  
(**devas**) and the **demons** (supernatural  
beings) are engaged in a long-running  
war, in which neither side can prevail.  
**Indra**, the king of the gods, finally  
decides to seek advice from the god  
**Brahma**. Brahma advises Indra that if  
he obtains a bone from Dadhichi’s  
body, it can be made into a weapon that  
will defeat the demons. Indra is understandably uncertain that his request  
will be granted, but when he appears  
before Dadhichi, he not only gives his  
consent, but immediately abandons  
his body through yogic powers. Indra  
takes Dadhichi’s bones, fashions a  
weapon from them, and successfully  
defeats the demons.
