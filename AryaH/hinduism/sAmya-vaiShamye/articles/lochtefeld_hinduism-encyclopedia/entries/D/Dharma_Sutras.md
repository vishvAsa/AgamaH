(“aphorisms on **dharma**”) The earliest  
texts specifically devoted to dharma—  
191  
Dharma Sutras  
rules of conduct for various social  
groups, moral duties, rights, and obligations. These were composed as collections of aphorisms, some so brief that  
they virtually presuppose commentary,  
and were written between the seventh  
and second century B.C.E. According to  
theory, the Dharma Sutras were the third  
and final part of a **Kalpa Sutra** (complete handbook of religious practice),  
which would also contain prescriptions  
for Vedic rituals (**Shrauta Sutras**) and  
domestic rites (**Grhya Sutras**). Each  
Kalpa Sutra was theoretically connected  
with one of the four **Vedas**, the oldest  
Hindu religious texts, and was thus the  
“family property” of the **brahmins**  
(priests) connected with that Veda. A  
particular Dharma Sutra was associated  
with a particular group of brahmins and  
was primarily intended as a manual for  
their behavior.  
The real picture is far more complex,  
since more than twenty collections of  
Dharma Sutras have been identified,  
although the most important are attributed to sages and writers **Apastamba**,  
**Gautama**, **Vasishtha**, **Baudhayana**, and  
the god **Vishnu**. These Dharma Sutras  
were an attempt to provide an ordered  
way of life by delineating each person’s  
rights and duties depending on his or  
her social status (**varna**) and **stage of life**  
(ashrama). These texts were the basis for  
the later **Dharma Shastras** (treatises on  
religious duty), which expanded the  
sutras, put them into verse, and were  
intended to serve as an actual code of  
law for the members of the community.
