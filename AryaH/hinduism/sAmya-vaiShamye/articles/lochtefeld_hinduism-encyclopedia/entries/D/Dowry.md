title = "Dowry"

+++
In the strictest terms, this word is used  
in modern Indian society to designate  
any wealth transferred from the bride’s  
family to the groom’s as a condition for  
the marriage to occur. As with most  
marriages around the world, Hindu  
marriages often involve giving gifts to  
the couple, but Indians themselves draw  
distinctions between different categories of gifts. It is customary for the  
bride’s parents to give her gifts of clothing and jewelry for her wedding, according to their means. This practice is  
attested in the **dharma literature’s** (text  
on religious duty) description of the  
**Brahma marriage**. This is one of the  
eight recognized ways to perform a marriage and describes the bride as richly  
adorned. These gifts are her personal  
property, and serve both to give the  
bride some wealth of her own and as a  
last resort for the family. It is also common for the bride’s family to give gifts to  
the groom and his family, of which the  
greatest is the “gift of a virgin”  
(**kanyadan**), i.e., the bride herself. In  
many cases, the newlyweds also receive  
gifts from other relatives, particularly  
when they are setting up a household.  
Both of these sorts of gifts carry no stigma in Indian society and in the popular  
mind are not considered “dowry.”  
Unfortunately, not all wedding “gifts”  
fall into these categories. Most marriages in India are still arranged by the  
parents, who are operating under differing imperatives. For the bride’s parents,  
marrying off their daughter is a religious  
duty, which is over and above their natural inclination to provide for their  
daughter. This gives the groom’s parents  
a distinct advantage, since they “take”  
the bride, and this advantage can give  
rise to ugly and even tragic situations.  
The parents of a young man with a  
promising career can usually expect  
larger and richer gifts from the bride’s  
family, since her future will be more  
secure. In many cases these gifts are neither asked for nor negotiated, but simply given as part of the exchange  
between two families of equal status. In  
the worst cases, the groom’s family presents a list of demands, which the bride’s  
family is expected to fulfill as a condition for the marriage. Given the pressure  
to marry off their **daughters**, the bride’s  
parents may promise more than they are  
actually able to “deliver.” One consequence of this failure is the much-publicized **dowry deaths**, in which the bride  
is killed.  
Most decent people in India recoil at  
the notion of “selling” their **sons** to the  
highest bidder, or of using his marriage  
as an opportunity for the family to get  
rich. At the same time, it is generally  
accepted that marrying one’s daughter  
will entail considerable effort and  
expenditure, and that at her wedding  
one should give appropriate gifts. It is  
from these assumptions that the evils of  
dowry stem, and can be exploited by  
unscrupulous people.
