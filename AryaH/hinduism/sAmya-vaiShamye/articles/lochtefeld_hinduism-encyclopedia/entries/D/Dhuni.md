title = "Dhuni"

+++
(from **Sanskrit** *dhu*, “to ignite”) A  
smoldering **fire** that is kept burning by  
ascetics. This fire serves multiple purposes in **ascetic** life: It is a means to  
stay warm in cold climates, a means to  
perform physical **asceticism** by withstanding heat, particularly in the summer, and its care and tending is also a  
form of religious observance. The  
dhuni is a natural gathering place, and  
for many ascetics it is the center of  
ascetic life, providing heat for warmth,  
a fire for cooking and making tea, and  
coals for lighting the **chillum**, a  
straight pipe used to smoke tobacco  
mixed with hashish (**charas**). The fire  
itself is seen as the **deity Agni** in material form. Agni is a witness to the conversation around the dhuni, which  
should be of a serious and spiritual  
nature. The dhuni’s sacred character  
can be seen by certain restrictions that  
were designed to maintain its **purity**:  
one should not blow directly on the  
fire (lest some saliva should contaminate it), but through a tube used for  
this purpose; one should keep clean  
the boundary around the dhuni (usually of made of hardened clay); and  
one should not touch this boundary

Dhuni  
Ascetics gather around a dhuni, a smoldering fire used to stay warm and perform ascetic rituals.  
with one’s feet. Certain ascetic centers  
have a long history of a continuous fire.  
One such example is the sacred village  
**Triyuginarayan** in the **Himalayas**, where  
a fire is claimed to have been burning for  
the past three cosmic ages (**yugas**).
