In Hindu mythology, Dhanvantari is  
the physician of the gods and is credited as the founder of **ayurveda**, a traditional system of Indian medicine.  
Dhanvantari is born when the **gods**  
and **demons** (supernatural beings)  
churn the Ocean of Milk to produce  
the nectar of immortality. In the  
course of their churning, many precious things are produced, including  
the **goddess Lakshmi**, the wishing-**cow**  
**Kamadhenu**, and the **Kaustubha** jewel.  
As the churning reaches its climax,  
Dhanvantari himself emerges from the  
ocean bearing the pot of **amrta**, the  
nectar of immortality that has been  
the ultimate product of the whole  
endeavor. See also **Tortoise avatar**.
