title = "Dyaus"

+++
A minor **deity** in the **Vedas**, the oldest  
and most authoritative Hindu religious  
texts. Dyaus is a god associated with  
the sky, but his character is not welldeveloped, since even at the time of the  
Vedas he had been largely eclipsed by  
other gods. Dyaus is part of the oldest  
layer of Indo-**Aryan** deities, as evidenced  
by the Greek form of his name, Zeus.
