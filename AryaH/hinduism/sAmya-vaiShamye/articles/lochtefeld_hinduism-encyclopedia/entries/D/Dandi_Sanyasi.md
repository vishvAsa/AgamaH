title = "Dandi Sanyasi"

+++
Among the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, or the  
**ascetic** devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**, the Dandi Sanyasis are the  
most prestigious of the three general  
ascetic types; the others being the  
**Paramahamsa** and the **Naga Sanyasis**.  
Dandi Sanyasis take their name from the  
staff (**danda**) that they are given at their  
ascetic **initiation** and that they carry for  
the rest of their lives as a sign of ascetic  
restraint. The danda is always kept off  
the ground to maintain its **purity**. The  
Dandi Sanyasis tend to put the highest  
stress on the importance of **Sanskrit**  
(sacred language) learning and uphold  
the traditional social and cultural values  
it propounds. Of the ten Dashanami  
divisions, Dandis tend to belong to  
those divisions that will only initiate  
**brahmins**—that is, the **Saraswati**,  
**Ashrama**, and **Tirtha** divisions, and also  
some sections of the Bharati division. In  
many cases, Dandi Sanyasis are initiated  
as ascetics only after having completed  
the other three **stages of life** (**ashramas**), fulfilling the idealized pattern in  
the **dharma literature**, the texts on religious duty. Thus, their ascetic status  
does not come only from the strictness  
of their ascetic observance, for which  
they are rightly famous. It also reflects  
the continuing influence of their former  
“worldly” status, which was supposedly  
left behind upon ascetic initiation, and  
their adherence to traditional idealized  
cultural patterns. The philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**, traditionally named  
as the Dashanami order’s founder, was  
himself believed to be a Dandi Sanyasi.  
This pattern of leadership still  
continues, since even now Dandi  
Sanyasis are invariably chosen for the  
**Shankaracharyas**, the religious leaders  
who preside over the four monastic centers (**maths**). These centers supposedly  
were established by the philosopher  
Shankaracharya, and in many cases  
these present leaders have been lifelong  
ascetics, as Shankaracharya is believed  
to have been. For further information
