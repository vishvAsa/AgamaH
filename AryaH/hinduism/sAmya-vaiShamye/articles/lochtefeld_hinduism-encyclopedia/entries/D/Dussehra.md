(variant of Dashahara, “ten days”)  
Festival celebrated on the tenth **day** of  
the bright (waxing) half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Ashvin** (September–October),  
and one of the most important celebrations in the **year**. The festival celebrates  
the victory of good over evil, and is also  
known as Vijaya Dashami (“Victory  
Tenth”). The festival has two charter  
myths, both of which mark the ultimate  
triumph of good over evil. One charter  
comes from the mythology of the  
**Goddess**, and marks this as the day on  
which **Durga** (form of the Hindu Mother  
Goddess) slays the buffalo-**demon**  
**Mahishasura**. This episode comes from  
the **Devimahatmya**, and is the central  
theme of the text—the goddess is born  
to destroy Mahishasura when the gods  
cannot, and the struggle between the  
two is the climax of the text. Since the  
nine days preceding Dussehra are the  
fall **Navaratri**, the “nine nights” spent in  
**worship** of the Goddess, it seems reasonable that the tenth and concluding  
day would be marked by the climactic  
moment in the *Devimahatmya*, the  
most important source of mythology for  
the Goddess.  
The other charter myth for this festival comes from an entirely different  
source, the mythology of **Rama** (the seventh incarnation of **Vishnu**). This is celebrated as the day on which Rama slays  
**Ravana** (demon-king of **Lanka**) and  
regains **Sita** (wife of Rama) from captivity.  
This victory is symbolized by burning  
huge effigies of Ravana and his **son**

Dussehra  
In Kulu, people celebrating the festival of Dussehra carry temple images in procession through the streets.  
Meghanada (an epithet of **Indrajit**) on  
the night of Dussehra, and these effigies  
often contain fireworks to enhance their  
pyrotechnic capacity. This time of year is  
often celebrated with dramatic enactments of the **Ramayana** (the **Sanskrit**  
epic), known as the **Ram Lila**. In some  
cases this lasts for ten days, ending on  
Dussehra; in other cases (as in the Ram  
Lila in **Benares**, the sacred city on the  
banks of the **Ganges** River) it will last an  
entire month, with Dussehra marking  
the death of Ravana.  
Dussehra is a highly auspicious day,  
and popular tradition holds that anything begun on this day will succeed.  
Dussehra is thus a favored occasion for  
initiating any important projects, beginning endeavors, or forming organizations, even if it is only a token beginning.  
Dussehra also marks the beginning of  
the cool **season**, when the end of the hot  
weather and the monsoon rains bring  
better conditions for military action.  
Both charter myths have connections  
with battle and conquest, and in earlier  
times Dussehra was particularly celebrated by the royal and martial classes.  
On Dussehra it was customary for soldiers to worship their weapons. Given  
the festival’s martial associations and  
the guarantee that all things initiated on  
that day would be successful, it was also  
the day of choice for rulers to send out  
their armies to invade neighboring territories. Even today one of the most spectacular celebrations is in Mysore, where  
the ruler presides over this festival in his  
ritual position as king, even though he  
no longer rules. The other great celebration is in **Kulu**, where all the **deities** in  
the region journey to Kulu to celebrate  
this festival (along with hordes of their  
human retainers).
