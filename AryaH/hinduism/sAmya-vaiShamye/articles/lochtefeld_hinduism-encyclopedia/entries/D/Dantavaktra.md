title = "Dantavaktra"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Dantavaktra is  
an **asura** or **demon** king who is the  
rebirth of **Vijaya**, one of the gatekeepers of the god **Vishnu**. Vijaya has been  
cursed to be reborn three times as an  
172  
Dandasana  
asura and to be killed each time by  
Vishnu. In his previous incarnations  
Vijaya is born as **Hiranyakashipu**,  
who is killed by the **Man-Lion avatar**  
(one incarnation of the god Vishnu)  
and as **Kumbhakarna**, who is killed by  
Vishnuâ€™s **Rama avatar**. When Dantavaktra  
is killed by **Krishna**, the **curse** is broken,  
and Vijaya returns to his rightful place.
