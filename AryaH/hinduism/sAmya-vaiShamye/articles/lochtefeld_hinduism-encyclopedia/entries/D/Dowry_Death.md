title = "Dowry Death"

+++
Name given to a particular type of  
violent crime against **women**. According  
to the much-publicized pattern, it is  
the killing of a new bride by her in-laws,  
either for failing to bring enough  
**dowry** with her into the marriage,  
or when her parents could not deliver  
the dowry that had been promised.  
In many cases these women were killed  
by being doused with kerosene and  
lit, since this could be passed off as  
an accidental death suffered while  
cooking. These murders received great  
publicity in India and abroad in  
the mid-1980s, in part because of  
their calculated and horrific nature.  
The aforementioned pattern simplifies  
the issues, however, by reducing it to  
a question of money. It is true that  
there have been many cases in which  
women have been killed solely for  
financial reasonsâ€”that is, for not  
bringing enough dowry. Yet many of the  
victims of these so-called dowry deaths  
had been married for years, and their  
deaths are better explained as the  
result of an escalating pattern of

domestic violence, rather than a  
calculated extortion and murder.
