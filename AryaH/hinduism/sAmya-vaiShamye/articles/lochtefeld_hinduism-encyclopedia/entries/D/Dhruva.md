title = "Dhruva"

+++
(“fixed”) In Hindu mythology, a boy who  
is a symbol for the unrelenting pursuit  
of a goal. Dhruva is a king’s **son**, but for  
some unknown reason his father favors  
Dhruva’s half-brother over Dhruva.  
Distressed by this insult, Dhruva takes a  
vow to attain a place above all others,  
and goes off to the forest to perform austerities (**tapas**). After enduring bodily  
mortifications for eons, the god **Vishnu**  
appears to Dhruva to grant him a boon.  
In response to Dhruva’s request for a  
place above all others, Vishnu promises  
Dhruva that after his death he will be  
installed as the **Pole Star**, the pivot  
around which all the other stars in the  
sky will turn. Even now this star is  
known by that name in India.
