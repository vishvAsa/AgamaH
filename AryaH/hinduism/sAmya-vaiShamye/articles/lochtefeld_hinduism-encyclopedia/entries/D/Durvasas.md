title = "Durvasas"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is a partial incarnation of the god **Shiva**.  
Durvasas is the son of **Anasuya**, who for  
her influence in persuading another  
woman to remove a curse has been  
given boons by the gods **Brahma**,  
**Vishnu**, and Shiva. Anasuya requests  
that each be born as one of her **sons**,  
and Vishnu is born as **Dattatreya**, Shiva  
as Durvasas, and Brahma as Chandra. As  
a mythic figure, Durvasas is noted for his  
**magic** powers, which are not surprising  
given his background. He is also known  
for his bad temper and for his tendency

Durvasas  
Worshipers immerse an image of the goddess Durga in the Yamuna River, near New Delhi.  
Durga is depicted riding a lion and holding a weapon in each of her eight hands.  
to curse anyone who makes him angry.  
One victim of his wrath is the maiden  
**Shakuntala**, who in her reverie on her  
newfound love with King **Dushyanta**  
does not notice and pay homage to  
Durvasas. She is cursed that her love  
would completely forget her. In another  
case Durvasas curses all the gods to be  
subject to old age and death. This is  
provoked by an “insult” from **Indra’s**  
**elephant Airavata**, which had flung a  
garland given by Durvasas to the  
ground. As with most **curses** in Hindu  
mythology, neither of these curses can  
be withdrawn, but their severity is  
reduced by mitigating conditions.  
Shakuntala is told that King Dushyanta  
will remember her if she shows him  
some sign of their relationship, which  
she does. The gods can avoid old age  
and death by obtaining and consuming  
the nectar of immortality (**amrta**).  
As with all the sages, Durvasas can  
also grant wonderful boons to people  
with whom he is pleased. One such beneficiary was **Kunti**, one of the heroines  
in the epic **Mahabharata**. Durvasas  
gives Kunti a powerful **mantra** (sacred  
sound), which will allow her to have a  
child by any of the gods simply by thinking about him. As soon as Kunti receives  
this mantra, she tests it while looking at  
the **sun**, and immediately bears the  
golden child **Karna**. In her panic at  
unexpectedly becoming a mother—she  
is still unmarried, and understandably  
concerned about what people might  
think—she puts the child in a box and  
abandons him in the **Ganges**. After her  
marriage to **Pandu** (son of the sage  
**Vyasa** and queen **Ambalika**), this  
mantra is the only way that she is able to  
have children, since Pandu has been  
cursed to die the moment he sleeps with  
one of his wives. She uses this mantra to  
bear **Yudhishthira**, **Arjuna**, and **Bhima**,  
then teaches it to her co-wife **Madri**,  
who bears **Nakula** and **Sahadeva**. Thus,  
through the gift of Durvasas, all the  
**Pandava** brothers—the epic’s protagonists—are children of the gods.
