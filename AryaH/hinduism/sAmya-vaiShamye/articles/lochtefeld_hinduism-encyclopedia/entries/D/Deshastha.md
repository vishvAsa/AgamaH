The model for traditional Indian society  
was as a collection of **endogamous** subgroups known as **jatis** (“birth”). These  
jatis were organized (and their social  
status determined) by the group’s hereditary occupation, over which each group  
had a monopoly. This sort of differentiation applied even to **brahmins**, whose  
role has been to serve as priests, scholars, and teachers. The Deshastha brahmin jati is a subset of the **Maharashtri**  
brahmins, who were themselves one of  
the five southern brahmin communities  
182  
Deogarh  
(**Pancha Dravida**). The core region for  
the Deshastha brahmins is in the  
**Deccan** region in **Maharashtra**, whereas  
the other major subcommunity, the  
**Chitpavan** or Konkanastha, is found on  
the coast.
