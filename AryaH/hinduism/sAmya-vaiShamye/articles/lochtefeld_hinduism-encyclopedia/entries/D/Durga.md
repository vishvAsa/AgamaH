(“inaccessible, impassable”) A particular  
form of the Hindu Mother **Goddess**,  
although the name is often used as a  
more general title for the mother goddess in her fierce and powerful form. As  
depicted in images and pictures, Durga  
rides on a **lion** and holds in her eight  
hands the weapons of all the gods. Both  
of these features correspond to the  
description of the great goddess in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest and most  
important mythic text used for the  
**worship** of the Goddess as the  
supreme **divine power**. The general  
identification of Durga with this great  
Goddess is underscored by the  
*Devimahatmya*’s other common name,  
the *Durgasaptashati* (“The 700 [verses]  
on Durga”). As a form of the great  
Goddess, Durga is a major divinity in the  
Hindu pantheon and in modern Hindu  
life. The eighth **day** in the waxing and  
waning halves of the **lunar month** are  
considered sacred to her, and her rites  
are practiced on those days. Her most  
important festivals are the Nine Nights  
(**Navaratri**), which occur in both the  
spring and the fall. In each of these festivals Durga is worshiped in her nine  
forms (**Navadurga**), one on each  
consecutive night. The variety of  
goddesses as which she is worshiped  
again shows us how Durga is conceived  
as the embodiment of the Goddess in all  
her forms.
