+++
(“meditation”) In the **ashtanga yoga**  
(eight-point discipline) first arranged by  
the philosopher **Patanjali**, dhyana is the  
seventh of the eight elements of yoga  
practice. Along with **dharana** (“concentration”) and **samadhi** (“trance”),  
dhyana is one of the three parts known  
as the “inner discipline” (**samyama**), the  
culmination of yogic training. Dhyana is  
described as an extension of dharana, in  
which the fixed concentration upon an  
object acquired in dharana is continued  
and extended without break. In more colloquial modern usage, the word dhyana  
can be used to describe any sort of  
focused meditation.
