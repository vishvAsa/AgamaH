+++
(“establishing the **deity**”) Rite by which  
the image of a deity is established in a  
temple and consecrated for **worship**.  
The image itself must be constructed  
according to carefully defined sculptural  
and artistic canons that date back to the  
early centuries of the common era, as  
the sculptures at the **Deogarh** temple  
clearly show. The image, temple site,  
and the performers must be purified  
before the rite begins, and this **purity**  
must be maintained throughout the  
entire rite—which can last for days—to  
ensure that the image remains pure. All  
parts in the transmission and physical  
**installation** of the image are carefully  
done, but the climactic rite is the  
**pranapratishtha**, in which the image is  
infused with the breath of life and  
becomes the seat for the deity. After this  
point, the image is considered to be ritually “alive,” and must receive regular  
worship and ministrations.
