title = "Day of Brahma"

+++
The Day of Brahma, or **kalpa**, is the  
largest generally accepted measure of  
time in Indian **cosmology**, and spans  
432 million years. This time period is the  
ultimate limit for the existence of the  
created world, although within it the  
universe undergoes periodic renewals.  
At the conclusion of the Day of Brahma  
comes the universal dissolution (**pralaya**),  
in which the created universe is completely destroyed and reabsorbed into  
**Vishnu**. The Day of Brahma is followed  
by a night of equal length, during  
which the only living thing is the god  
Vishnu, who sleeps on the back of his  
serpent couch, **Shesha**, and floats on  
the surface of the cosmic ocean. When  
the Night of Brahma is ended, a lotus  
sprouts forth from Vishnuâ€™s navel,  
which opens to reveal the god **Brahma**,  
and with the new Day of Brahma the  
universe begins anew.  
The Day of Brahma can be divided  
into smaller units based on two different  
methods. One of these divides the Day  
of Brahma into fourteen equal ages, in  
which each age is identified by the particular divine sovereign (**Manu**) who  
rules during that age. Another divides  
the Day of Brahma into one thousand  
**mahayugas**, each of which has four constituent **yugas** (units of **cosmic time**),  
each shorter than the last. See also  
**Cosmic Time**.
