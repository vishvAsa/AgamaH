(“rule through the stick”) In the **dharma**  
**literature**, or the texts on religious duty  
(**dharma**), dandaniti is the preservation  
of social order by inflicting punishment  
on evildoers. This rule through punishment was the king’s role and duty in traditional Indian ideas of kingship, for  
without such rule it was believed that  
normal social life would be impossible.
