The attitude toward drugs in Hindu  
society shows the incredible variation  
for which the Hindu religion is famous.  
In general, the use of drugs is zealously  
condemned among “respectable” people,  
as is anything leading to a potential loss  
of control. Yet Hindu mythology also  
portrays the god **Shiva** as regularly consuming **intoxicants**, particularly **bhang**,  
a preparation made primarily from marijuana, and **datura**, a genus of plants  
containing poisonous alkaloids. Given  
this mythic example, some of Shiva’s  
devotees (**bhakta**) do the same as a variety of religious practice. Many ascetics  
regularly spend much of their day smoking hashish (**charas**) mixed with tobacco, although this is not always viewed as  
normal **ascetic** practice. There are also  
particular times and places when consumption of drugs is more accepted,  
even among “normal” people.  
Consuming bhang is a fairly common  
element in the celebration of certain festivals, such as **Shivaratri** (“Night of  
Shiva”) and **Holi** (the festival of reversal).  
It is also sometimes consumed when  
people are on pilgrimage, and government-regulated stands selling bhang  
can be found at several important pilgrimage places (**tirtha**), including  
**Benares**, **Puri**, and **Haridwar**. Despite  
this more widespread use in particular  
specialized contexts, there are many  
people who do not use drugs under any  
circumstances and would never consider  
doing so. Such rigid refusal is still only one  
part of the “orthodox” picture, in which  
one can find many different attitudes.
