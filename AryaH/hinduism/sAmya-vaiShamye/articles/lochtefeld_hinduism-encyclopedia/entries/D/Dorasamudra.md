title = "Dorasamudra"

+++
Capital city of the **Hoysala dynasty**, who  
ruled the region in southern part of the  
state of **Karnataka** from the eleventh to  
the thirteenth centuries. Today  
Dorasamudra is known by the name of  
**Halebid** and is a village about sixty miles  
north and west of the city of Mysore.  
Although largely uninhabited, the site is  
known for a magnificent collection of  
temples, in particular the **Hoysaleshvar**  
**Temple**, dedicated to the god **Shiva** in  
his form as Lord of the Hoysalas. The  
Hoysala temples were built out of a particular type of stone—variously  
described as chlorite schist, steatite, or  
soapstone—that was quite soft when  
newly quarried, but gradually hardened  
with exposure to air. This initial malleability made the stone easy to carve,  
and facilitated the lush detail that characterizes these temples.
