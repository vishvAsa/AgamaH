Southern Indian **brahmin** (priest) subcommunity. The Dikshitars are an  
extremely small community and are  
found mainly in the temple-town of  
**Chidambaram** in the state of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**. They are the hereditary servants  
at the temple of **Nataraja**—the god  
**Shiva** in his form as the “Lord of  
the **Dance**.” According to their own  
mythic understanding, the Dikshitars  
were members of Nataraja’s heavenly  
host (**gana**) when he lived in **heaven**.  
They accompanied Nataraja when  
he came down to **earth**, where they still  
serve him.
