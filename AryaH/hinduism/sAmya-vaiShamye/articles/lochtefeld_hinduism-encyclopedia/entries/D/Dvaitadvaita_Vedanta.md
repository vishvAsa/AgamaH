title = "Dvaitadvaita Vedanta"

+++
One of the branches of **Vedanta**, the  
philosophical school claiming to reveal  
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the  
ancient sacred texts known as the **Vedas**.  
Dvaitadvaita Vedanta’s founder and  
most important figure was the fourteenth-century philosopher, **Nimbarka**.  
Nimbarka stressed the **worship** of the  
god **Krishna** and his companion **Radha**  
as a divine couple, but on a philosophical level he was attempting to find some  
middle ground between the monism of  
the **Advaita Vedanta** school and the  
dualism of the **Dvaita Vedanta** school.  
The former claimed that a single  
Ultimate Reality—called **Brahman**—lay  
behind all things, and that all things  
were merely differing forms of this single reality. The latter emphasized the  
utter distinction between God as  
Ultimate Reality on the one hand, and  
the world and human souls on the other.  
Nimbarka stressed that the world and  
souls were dependent on God, in whom  
they exist and with whom they had a  
subtle connection. Nimbarka thus supported the philosophical doctrine called  
**parinamavada**, which stressed the real  
transformation of the divine and the  
capacity of human beings to transform  
themselves back to their divine status.
