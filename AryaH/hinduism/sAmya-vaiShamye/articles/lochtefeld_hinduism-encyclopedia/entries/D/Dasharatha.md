title = "Dasharatha"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Dasharatha is a king  
of the **Ikshvaku** dynasty and the father  
of **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist.  
Dasharatha is generally portrayed as a  
good king, but like many characters in  
Indian mythology, his ultimate destiny  
is governed by the result of a **curse**,  
whose effects he is unable to avoid. As a  
young man, Dasharatha is very fond of  
hunting. On one occasion, he blindly  
sends an arrow to the spot where he  
hears the sound of an **animal** drinking  
at a stream. When he investigates, he is  
horrified to discover a young man struck  
by his arrow, with the water pot he had  
been filling by his side. With his dying  
breaths the young man informs  
Dasharatha that he is the sole source of  
support for his blind parents and commands Dasharatha to inform them of  
his death. Dasharatha is a man of honor  
and fulfills the boy’s last request. When  
the boy’s father hears the story, he angrily curses Dasharatha to die in similar  
grief, bereft of his **sons**.  
For many years it seemed as if this  
curse would not come true, since  
Dasharatha had no sons, even though  
he had three wives: **Kausalya**, **Kaikeyi**,  
and **Sumitra**. Dasharatha sponsors various religious rites for the **birth** of sons,  
and finally commissions the sage  
**Rishyashringa** to perform a great **sacrifice**. At the rite’s conclusion, a shining  
figure emerges from the sacrificial **fire**,  
places a pot of milk-rice before  
Dasharatha, and directs him to feed it to  
his wives. Dasharatha divides the contents of the pot between Kausalya and  
Kaikeyi, each of whom give some to  
Sumitra. In due time Kausalya bears  
Rama, Kaikeyi gives birth to **Bharata**,  
and Sumitra (by virtue of receiving a  
share from each of her co-wives) bears  
the twins **Lakshmana** and **Shatrughna**.  
As his sons grow into manhood  
Dasharatha is blissfully happy, and the  
memory of the curse fades from his  
mind. As a young man, Rama shows his  
prowess and goodness, and Dasharatha  
decides to anoint him as the heirapparent. Yet the night before this ceremony, the curse finally comes to  
fruition. During the preparations preceding Rama’s investiture, the mind of  
his stepmother Kaikeyi has been slowly  
174  
Dasharatha  
poisoned by the whisperings of her  
maid **Manthara**. Manthara convinces  
Kaikeyi that she and her son Bharata will  
be mere slaves after Rama is crowned  
the heir-apparent. This prompts Kaikeyi  
to take drastic action. Many years  
before, Dasharatha promised Kaikeyi  
two blessings as reward for her help in  
winning a great battle. She has never  
asked for these, but she now requests  
that Rama spend fourteen years in forest  
exile, and that her own son, Bharata,  
shall rule in his place. Dasharatha  
pleads with Kaikeyi to change her mind,  
but she is adamant that her wishes have  
to be granted if Dasharatha will retain  
the unbroken family honor. Dasharatha  
later pleads with Rama to disobey him  
and take over the kingdom by force, but  
Rama refuses this as it is an unrighteous  
action. Rama leaves for the forest, thus  
upholding the family honor, but in his  
sorrow at being separated from Rama,  
Dasharatha dies of a broken heart.
