title = "Dravidian"

+++
In the strictest linguistic sense, the word  
Dravidian is the name for a particular  
family of languages in which the primary  
members are the four southern Indian  
languages: **Tamil**, Telegu, **Kannada**, and  
Malayalam. Aside from these four languages, all located in the southernmost  
part of the subcontinent, another language in the Dravidian family is Brahui.  
This is spoken by a small and fairly isolated population in modern Pakistan, far  
from any other Dravidian language  
speakers, and completely surrounded  
by people speaking Indo-**Aryan** languages. One theory to explain this irregularity is that the Dravidian languages  
were originally spoken all over the subcontinent, but were gradually displaced  
toward the south as Indo-Aryan language speakers—better known as the  
Aryans—came into India. According to  
this theory, the Brahui-speaking community is an isolated remnant of that  
earlier time, which somehow managed  
to remain intact.  
This notion also affects how southern Indians form their identities. The  
word *Dravidian* can be used to denote a  
southern Indian or any person whose  
mother tongue is one of the four primary  
Dravidian languages. For southern  
Indians with a strong regional identity, it  
is a way for them to distinguish themselves from northern Indians and the  
“imperialism” of northern Indian culture. It is also used with an underlying  
tone of pride, that as Dravidians they are  
descendants of the subcontinent’s original inhabitants.
