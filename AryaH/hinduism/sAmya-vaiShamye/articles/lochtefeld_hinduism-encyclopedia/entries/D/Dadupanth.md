title = "Dadupanth"

+++
Religious organization founded by the  
**sant** poet-saint **Dadu** (1554–1603). The  
Dadupanth is strongest in **Rajasthan**,  
the desert state in which Dadu is  
believed to have lived. The Dadupanth  
stresses religious themes common to  
the sant poet-saints: the rejection of ritual and image **worship** in favor of an  
internal search for a formless **deity**,  
stress on the power of the divine Name,  
and a belief in the relative unimportance of conventional **caste** distinctions. It also emphasizes certain points  
that were particularly important to  
Dadu himself, among them nonviolence (**ahimsa**), **vegetarianism**, and the  
religious value of work. The Dadupanth  
has always been a numerically small  
organization, but they are historically  
important because of their manuscript  
collections. These collections are  
known as the “five voices” (**panchvani**),  
because they contain the works of five  
different devotional (**bhakti**) poets:  
Dadu, **Kabir**, **Namdev**, **Ravidas**, and  
Hardas. Rajasthan’s desert climate has  
helped to preserve these manuscripts,  
some of which date from the early seventeenth century. The Panchvani manuscripts are among the earliest sources  
for all of these poets, which makes them  
an important resource for the historical  
study of northern Indian devotional  
poetry. For further information on the  
literary resources of the Dadupanth, see
