title = "Demons"

+++
The Hindu mythic universe has various  
classes of supernatural beings, some of  
which are perpetually at odds with one  
another. The most prominent conflict is  
between the suras (“gods”) and another  
class of divine beings called asuras  
(“not-gods”). Aside from the asuras,  
there are other powerful beings such as  
**rakshasas**, **pisacas**, and **vetalas**, which  
have greater or lesser malevolence  
toward the gods and human beings. The  
English word most often used to denote  
all these divine adversaries is the word  
“demon.” Although this is a convenient  
label and avoids the need for unfamiliar  
**Sanskrit** terminology, it also carries  
inappropriate and misleading associations. The word “demon” carries connotations of absolute and radical evil, as  
well as willful opposition to a single  
supreme divinity. Neither assumption is  
appropriate in the Hindu mythic universe, which is polytheistic, or believing  
in more than one god. This polytheistic  
universe has a host of divine beings,  
whose individual interests may well  
conflict with those of the gods, and  
whose mutual opposition may spill over  
into open war. This does not make such  
opponents, or “demons,” inherently evil,  
but rather the opponents of the Hindu  
gods, from whose perspective Hindu  
mythology is clearly recounted. These  
“demons” may also be ill-disposed  
toward humans, but they are not necessarily or inherently so. Perhaps the  
clearest recognition of their status is that  
despite their occasional opposition to  
the gods, they are never completely  
destroyed, but simply demoted to a  
more appropriate status. For example,  
when the “demon” **Hiranyakashipu** is  
destroyed by **Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar**,  
he is succeeded by his **son Prahlada**. In  
the same way, after the god **Rama** kills  
**Ravana**, the “demon” king of **Lanka**,  
Rama appoints as successor Ravana’s  
brother **Vibhishana**. Asuras and other  
supernormal beings thus have a legitimate place in the Hindu mythic world,  
and as long as they do not overreach  
themselves and throw the world into  
imbalance, they are allowed to remain.
