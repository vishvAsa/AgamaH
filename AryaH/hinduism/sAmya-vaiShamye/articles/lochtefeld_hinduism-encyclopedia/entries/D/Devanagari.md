title = "Devanagari"

+++
Name for the most common northern  
Indian script, in which the sacred  
**Sanskrit**, modern **Hindi**, and Marathi  
languages are commonly written to this  
day. It is a descendant of the ancient  
**Brahmi** script, and from it developed  
the scripts used for the modern **Bengali**,  
**Gujarati**, Oriya, and Punjabi languages.  
Its most characteristic feature is that the  
top element of most letters is a horizontal line, which, when the letters are written together, causes the letters to  
“hang,” like laundry from a clothesline.  
Its name literally means “[script of the]  
city of the gods,” and according to one  
theory, it was given this name because it  
was developed in **Benares**, one of the  
holiest cities in India.
