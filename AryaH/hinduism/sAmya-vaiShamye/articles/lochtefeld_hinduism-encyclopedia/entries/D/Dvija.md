(“**twice-born**”) Name for a member of  
the three “twice-born” groups in Indian  
society, that is, a **brahmin** (highest in  
status), **kshatriya** (second in status to  
brahmins), or **vaishya** (third in status to  
brahmins). This name exists because  
these groups are ritually eligible to  
receive the adolescent religious **initiation** called **upanayana**, which is often  
described as the “second birth.” See  
**twice-born**.
