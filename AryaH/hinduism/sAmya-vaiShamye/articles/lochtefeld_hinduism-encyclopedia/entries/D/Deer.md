title = "Deer"

+++
In Hindu iconography, an **animal**  
strongly associated with the god **Shiva**,  
particularly in his form as **Pashupati**,  
the “Lord of Beasts.” In many of the fourarmed images of Shiva, one of the upper  
arms will have the figure of the deer  
emerging from it, symbolizing his control over all life. In Hindu **bhakti** (devotional) poetry, the musk deer is often  
used as a symbol for an ignorant,

Day of Brahma  
unenlightened person. According to this  
image, just as the deer does not recognize that the heady scent of musk comes  
from its own body, but rushes all over  
the forest in search of it, so are human  
beings ignorant of God inside and ever  
close to them, but looking outside themselves in search of the divine.
