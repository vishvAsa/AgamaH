(1554–1603) **Sant** poet-saint and  
founder of the religious organization  
known as the **Dadupanth**. The sants  
were a group of central and northern  
Indian poet-saints who share several  
general tendencies: a stress on individualized, interior religion leading to a  
personal experience of the divine; disdain for external ritual, particularly  
image **worship**; faith in the power of the  
divine Name; and a tendency to ignore  
conventional **caste** (social order) distinctions. According to tradition, Dadu  
was born into a family of cottoncarders, a fairly low-status occupation.  
He is also reported to have been born a  
Muslim, although based on his poetry  
he seems to have been relatively unaffected by Islam. His songs highlight  
many of the aforementioned sant  
themes. His poems also stress nonviolence (**ahimsa**), and as a practical application of that principle, **vegetarianism**.  
Another prominent theme is the religious value of work, since despite his  
fame he is said to have carded cotton  
until his death.  
Some of Dadu’s poems give lists and  
categories, as if systematizing his ideas  
for instruction. This suggests that he  
envisioned an established community  
of disciples. According to legend, Dadu  
met with the Moghul emperor **Akbar**,  
who was so impressed by Dadu’s charisma that he ceased his harming of living  
beings. The tale is probably fictitious,  
since there are similar stories for many  
of the sant poets, which all illustrate the

Dadu  
well-established theme of the temporal  
ruler bowing to the spiritual adept. For
