(2) A **deity**, seen as the personification of  
dharma as religious duty. In the  
**Mahabharata**, the latter of the two great  
Hindu epics, the five **Pandava** brothers,  
who are the epic’s protagonists, all have  
divine fathers, and the eldest brother  
**Yudhishthira** is the **son** of Dharma.  
Yudhishthira and his brothers belong  
to a kingly (**kshatriya**) family, but  
Yudhishthira himself shows great concern for truth, righteousness, and compassion. None of these are proverbial  
kshatriya qualities, which tend to stress  
courage and martial valor, and  
Yudhishthira’s qualities are usually  
explained by invoking the influence of  
his divine father. A different sort of  
Dharma cult arose in medieval Bengal,  
from the commingling of Buddhist,  
Muslim, and Hindu ideas. In this cult  
Dharma was worshiped as the formless  
single supreme Lord (probably reflecting  
the influence of Islam), but the **worship**  
of Dharma contained many similarities  
with Bengali Hindu rituals. For further  
information see Shashibhushan B.  
Dasgupta, *Obscure Religious Cults*, 1962.
