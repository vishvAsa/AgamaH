(“700 [verses in praise of ] **Durga**”)  
Another name for the **Devimahatmya**,  
the earliest and most important mythic  
text for the **worship** of the **Goddess** as  
208  
Duhshasana  
the supreme **divine power**. It has this  
name because the text is 700 verses  
long, and Durga is one of the common  
names designating this powerful goddess. The *Devimahatmya* is well-known  
for its assertion that God is female. This  
is a notion with no clear source in the  
earlier tradition, where female **deities**  
were insignificant. The text begins with  
a frame story, but the bulk of the work is  
three stories describing the salvific  
activity of the Goddess, who is portrayed  
as far superior to the pantheon’s male  
gods. See **Devimahatmya**.
