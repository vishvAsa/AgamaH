title = "Damaru"

+++
Hourglass-shaped hand drum, which  
has membranes stretched over the top  
and bottom of the hourglass, and at the  
middle, two strings with a bead at the  
end. The drum is played by holding it by  
its narrow middle and rotating the hand  
back and forth so that the beads strike  
the drumheads. The pace of the rhythm  
(**tala**) is determined by the speed of  
hand movement. In Hindu iconography,  
this drum is almost invariably associated  
with the god **Shiva**. In his form as  
**Nataraja**, the Lord of the **Dance**, the  
drum signifies the rhythm by which  
Shiva undertakes the creation of the  
universe. Another iconic motif is to  
show the damaru hanging from Shivaâ€™s  
trident. In modern times this drum is  
often carried by **ascetics**, either because  
of its association with Shiva, its portability, or both. See also **iconic image**.
