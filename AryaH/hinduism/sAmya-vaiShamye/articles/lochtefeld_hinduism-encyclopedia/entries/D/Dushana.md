title = "Dushana"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Dushana is one of the  
brothers of the demon-king **Ravana**.  
Together with his brother **Khara**,  
Dushana tries to avenge the honor of  
their sister **Shurpanakha**, whose ears  
and nose have been cut off by **Ramaâ€™s**  
brother **Lakshmana**. In a fierce battle  
with their **demon** (supernatural being)  
army, Rama destroys the army and kills  
Khara and Dushana. Seeing the failure  
of her two brothers, Shurpanakha goes  
to Ravana to beg for vengeance. Ravana  
realizes he cannot kill Rama in battle but  
resolves to avenge his sister by  
kidnapping **Sita**, wife of Ravana. This  
sets in motion the plot of the latter part  
of the epic.
