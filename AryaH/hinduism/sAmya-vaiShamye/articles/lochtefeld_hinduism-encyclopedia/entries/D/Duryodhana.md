title = "Duryodhana"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Duryodhana is  
the eldest **son** of King **Dhrtarashtra**,  
and thus the leader of the **Kauravas**,  
one of the two royal factions whose  
struggle for power is at the heart of the  
epic. Duryodhana and ninety-nine  
brothers are born in an unusual manner. Their mother **Gandhari** gives **birth**  
to a great lump of flesh, which is divided and put into one hundred pots of  
clarified butter. In these pots the lumps  
develop into infants. At the moment  
Duryodhana is born there are a host of  
evil **omens**, and when the court  
astrologers are asked to interpret these,  
they conclude that Duryodhana will be  
the ruin of the country and his family,  
and that it will be better to abandon  
him to the elements. Fatherly feelings  
prevent Dhrtarashtra from doing this,  
which sets the stage for the final conflict. Even though the major force driving the epic’s plot is the animosity  
between Duryodhana and his cousins,  
the **Pandavas**, and this ends with the  
Kauravas being utterly destroyed,  
it would be inaccurate to paint  
Duryodhana as an unredeemable villain. He is less evil than ill-starred—  
proud, stubborn, unwilling to admit his  
mistakes, and after a certain point,  
unwilling to grant his cousins any  
advantage. These character flaws are  
magnified by the lack of strong guidance from his father Dhrtarashtra, and  
eventually spell his doom.  
The rift between the cousins develops early, inflamed in part by the fact  
that the Pandavas are more heroic than  
Duryodhana and his brothers. As a  
child, **Bhima**, the Pandava brother best  
noted for his prodigious strength, used  
to whip all hundred Kauravas at once.  
Needless to say this does not endear him  
to them. Later in adolescence, when  
their archery teacher, **Drona**, requests  
the capture of King **Drupada** as his preceptor’s fee, the Pandava brother **Arjuna**  
succeeds in doing this, whereas  
Drupada defeats Duryodhana in battle.

Another rift grows when the Pandavas  
contest the right of Duryodhana’s friend  
**Karna** to take part in an archery match,  
claiming that Karna’s unknown parentage makes him unfit to compete with  
kings. Duryodhana skirts that issue by  
proclaiming Karna as the King of **Anga**,  
but by then the bad **blood** between the  
cousins is well-established.  
This bad blood becomes apparent  
in many different plots. Duryodhana  
first tries to kill the Pandavas by building a flammable **house of lac** for them,  
which is then set on **fire**. The Pandavas,  
however, are able to escape unharmed.  
Duryodhana later entices **Yudhishthira**  
(a Pandava brother) into a game of dice.  
Yudhishthira wagers and loses everything that he has, including himself, his  
brothers, and their common wife  
**Draupadi**. After this loss Duryodhana  
and his brother **Duhshasana** publicly  
humiliate Draupadi, after which Bhima  
swears a solemn oath to kill them both.  
Dhrtarashtra gives the Pandavas their  
freedom, which they promptly lose in  
yet another game of dice. The outcome  
of this loss is that the Pandavas agree to  
spend twelve years in exile in the forest,  
and live incognito for the thirteenth,  
with the condition that if they are discovered in the thirteenth year the cycle  
will begin anew.  
Despite the best efforts of Duryodhana’s  
spies, the Pandavas manage to escape  
detection during the thirteenth year,  
and at its conclusion send envoys to  
Duryodhana to claim their share of the  
kingdom. Perhaps emboldened by  
Yudhishthira’s comment that he and his  
brothers will be satisfied with a mere  
five villages, Duryodhana replies that he  
will not give them enough land to put  
under the point of a needle. In the face  
of such stubbornness and injustice, the  
Pandavas prepare for war to claim what  
is rightfully theirs. During the war  
Duryodhana fights valiantly, but in the  
eighteen days of battle sees his forces  
disintegrate around him. His final battle  
is with Bhima, who in exchange for  
Duryodhana’s earlier insult to Draupadi  
(he had directed her to sit on his thigh,  
which was a euphemism for the  
genitals), smashes Duryodhana’s thigh  
with his mace, killing him.
