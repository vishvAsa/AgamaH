title = "Dan Lila"

+++
One of the types of divine play (**lila**)  
between the god **Krishna** and his devotees (**bhakta**). In this lila, the adolescent  
Krishna intercepts the **gopis**, his **cow**herding female friends, who are on their  
way to the city of **Mathura** to sell their  
butter and curds. Krishna refuses to let  
them pass until they give him some as a  
gift (**dana**). The story of this lila is often  
presented in religiously oriented theatrical presentations, which are themselves  
known as lilas (“plays”), since their function is to reveal the work of the divine.  
This lila is but one instance in a long history of butter thievery. For further information see John Stratton Hawley,  
*Krishna*: *The Butter Thief*, 1983.
