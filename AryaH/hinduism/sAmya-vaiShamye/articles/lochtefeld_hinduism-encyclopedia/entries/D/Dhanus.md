(“bow”) In Hindu iconography, the bow  
is a weapon associated with several  
Hindu **deities**. It has strong mythic associations with the god **Shiva**, who in one  
of his mythic exploits destroys the Three  
Cities (**tripura**) with a single arrow. It is  
also commonly associated with the god  
**Rama**, whose unfailing arrows slay  
**Ravana**, the **demon**-king of **Lanka**.  
Aside from these, it is also one of the  
weapons commonly carried by powerful forms of the **Goddess**, such as  
**Durga**. The reason for this can be  
found in her charter myth in the  
**Devimahatmya**, in which the Goddess  
is formed from the collected radiance  
of all the gods and receives duplicates  
of all their weapons.
