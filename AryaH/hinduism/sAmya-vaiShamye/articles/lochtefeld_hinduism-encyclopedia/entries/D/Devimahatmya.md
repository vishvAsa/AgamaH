(“Greatness of the **Goddess**”) The  
earliest and most important mythic  
source for the cult of the Goddess as  
the supreme divine power. The  
*Devimahatmya* is itself a section of a  
larger **Sanskrit** (sacred language) text,  
the **Markandeya Purana**, and is generally accepted to have been composed in  
the **Narmada River** region in the fifth or  
sixth century. The *Devimahatmya* is  
most notable for its assertion that God is  
female. This notion has no clear source  
in the earlier Hindu tradition, in which  
female **deities** exist but are insignificant.  
This conviction must have existed at  
some level, because it emerges fully  
developed in the *Devimahatmya*, and  
the idea must have spent some time  
developing before its full fruition in  
this text.  
The *Devimahatmya* itself is a text of  
700 verses, hence its other common  
name, the *Durgasaptashati* (“700 verses  
to **Durga**”). The text begins with a frame  
story, in which a king and a merchant,  
each beset by worldly trials, seek refuge  
in the peace of the forest. There they  
meet a sage, who listens to each of their  
stories, and explains that all of their  
troubles are due to Mahamaya (an epithet of the Goddess). This is an epithet  
for the Goddess as the wielder of illusion, who is the sole power behind the  
universe. When pressed for further  
details, the sage tells three mythic stories, each describing the salvific activity  
of the Goddess. These three tales form  
the bulk of the text and the basis for the  
**worship** of the Goddess.  
The first story retells the myth of the  
**demons Madhu** and **Kaitabha**, who are  
born from the god **Vishnu’s** earwax during the period of cosmic dissolution  
(**pralaya**). As the creation of the world  
begins anew, a **lotus** sprouts from  
Vishnu’s navel. It opens to reveal the creator-god **Brahma**, who is immediately  
menaced by Madhu and Kaitabha. The  
story of these two demons also appears  
in the mythology connected with  
Vishnu, but there are significant differences in this version. In all versions of  
the myth, Brahma appeals for help, and  
Vishnu eventually slays the demons. But  
in the *Devimahatmya*, Brahma’s hymn  
of praise is to the Goddess, who in her  
form as **Yoganidra** (“sleep of **yoga**”) has  
lulled Vishnu into a cosmic stupor,  
rendering him unable to come to  
Brahma’s aid. Pleased by Brahma’s  
praise, the Goddess withdraws her  
influence over Vishnu, he awakens and  
slays the demons.  
The second story centers around the  
buffalo-demon **Mahishasura**, who is so  
186  
Devayajna  
powerful that none of the gods can conquer him. One day, when the gods are  
recounting their defeats at the demon’s  
hands, each of the gods begin to give off  
a great radiance. This radiance collects  
into a single glowing mass, and from it  
the figure of the Goddess emerges. This  
myth portrays the Goddess as the concentrated essence of all the gods, and  
thus superior to any one of them. This  
motif is accentuated by each of the gods  
giving her a copy of their weapons, so  
that symbolically she wields all of their  
**divine powers**. The Goddess takes up  
arms against Mahishasura and his army,  
and after a terrifying battle, slays him.  
The third story also portrays the  
Goddess as a warrior-queen. In this  
episode, she fights and destroys the  
demon armies of **Shumbha** and  
**Nishumbha**, along with their minions  
**Chanda**, **Munda**, and **Raktabija**. This  
story is notable for the first appearance of  
the fierce goddess **Kali**, who springs forth  
from the forehead of the Goddess as her  
anger personified. Kali helps the Goddess  
to defeat the demon armies by stuffing  
them into her mouth and consuming  
them. Kali is also instrumental in destroying the demon Raktabija, who has been  
granted the wish that whenever a drop of  
his **blood** falls to the ground, it will be  
transformed into another full-sized copy  
of himself. This makes him impossible to  
kill by conventional means. Kali is able to  
thwart this special power by drinking  
Raktabija’s blood before it reaches the  
ground. As with the second book, this  
story has extended descriptions of  
battlefield carnage.  
All of these stories describe the  
Goddess as the supreme divine power,  
far superior to the male gods in the pantheon. The frame story ends with an  
extended hymn of praise to the  
Goddess, and descriptions of the benefits gained from her worship. Both the  
king and the merchant begin to worship her, and after three years both are  
granted their desires. The king asks for a  
larger and unconquerable kingdom,  
alluding to the Goddess’s power to  
bestow worldly wishes. The merchant,  
however, requests final liberation, showing his awareness of her power over illusion, and the ultimate spiritual goal. For
