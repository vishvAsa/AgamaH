title = "Dvipas"

According to traditional mythic geography, the visible world is composed of a  
series of seven concentric dvipas, a word  
that literally means “islands,” but can be  
translated to “landmasses.” All but one  
of these are named after particular  
plants. At the center is **Jambu** (“Roseapple”) **dvipa**, followed by **Plaksha** (“figtree”) **dvipa**, **Salmala** (“silk-cotton tree”)  
**dvipa**, **Kusha** (“kusha grass”) **dvipa**,  
**Krauncha** (“curlew”) **dvipa**, **Shaka**  
(“Teak”) **dvipa**, and at the outermost  
edge, **Pushkara** (“blue lotus”) **dvipa**.  
Each of these lands is separated from its  
neighbors by one of the seven oceans  
(the **saptasindhu**), with each ocean  
composed of a different substance. The  
innermost ocean, as experience shows,  
is composed of salt **water**, the ones  
beyond this are of sugar cane juice,  
wine, ghee, yogurt, milk, and sweet  
water, respectively. At the center of  
Jambudvipa (and thus the world) is  
Mount **Meru**, which is compared to the  
central calyx of a lotus, and is surrounded  
by the dvipas as its petals. The physical  
world is thus seen as a symmetrical  
whole, with the land of India (in the  
southern part of Jambudvipa) positioned at the symbolic center.
