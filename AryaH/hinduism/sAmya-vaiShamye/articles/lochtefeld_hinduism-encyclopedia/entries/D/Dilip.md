title = "Dilip"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the figures  
in the charter myth describing how the  
river **Ganges** descended from heaven to  
**earth**. Dilip is the great-grandson of  
King **Sagar**, and the father of the sage  
**Bhagirath**, who finally accomplishes  
this task. The story begins with King  
Sagar, whose 60,000 heroic **sons** made  
the mistake of insulting the sage **Kapila**,  
and have been burned to ash by the **fire**  
of Kapila’s yogic powers. Kapila tells  
Sagar’s grandson **Anshuman** that the  
souls of his dead uncles will find peace  
only when the Ganges River (which is  
considered to be the material form of  
the **goddess Ganga**) comes down from  
heaven and touches their ashes. After  
this, the family labors unceasingly to do  
this; Anshuman and Dilip die with this  
goal unrealized, but Bhagirath finally  
brings it to fruition by performing  
**asceticism** until the gods agree to send  
the Ganges to earth.
