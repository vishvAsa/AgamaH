title = "Di Nobili, Roberto"

+++
(1577â€“1656) Jesuit priest and missionary  
who spent much of his life in **Madurai** in  
southern India. Di Nobili came to India  
to convert Indians to Catholicism and to  
facilitate his attempt at following the  
Jesuit pattern of learning the local languages, in this case **Sanskrit** (sacred language) and Tamil. He also strove to  
understand local culture and to gain the  
ritual authority that came with **brahmin**  
(priestly) status by emulating brahmin  
practices (**vegetarianism**, modes of  
dress, etc.), as a way to spread the  
Gospel more effectively. He was a perceptive and careful observer, but his  
writings remained unpublished during  
his lifetime. They have only been recently  
rediscovered. See also **Tamil language**.
