The model for traditional Indian society  
was as a collection of **endogamous**  
subgroups known as **jatis** (“birth”).  
These jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group has a monopoly. In traditional  
northern Indian society, the Doms are a  
jati whose hereditary occupation was  
cremating **corpses**. They have extremely  
low social status because of their habitual contact with dead bodies, considered the most violently impure objects  
of all. Despite their low status, some of  
the Doms are unbelievably wealthy,  
particularly the ones who control the  
**cremation ghats** in the city of **Benares**,  
for without their cooperation, a body  
cannot be burned. The word *ghat* refers  
to any flat area on the bank of a river. In  
most cases ghats are used as places for  
bathing (**snana**), but in some other  
cases they are also places for burning  
bodies, so that the ashes can be placed  
in the river to ritually "cool" them.
