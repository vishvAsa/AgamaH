title = "Drupada"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Drupada is the king  
of the **Panchala** region, and the father of  
**Dhrshtadyumna** and **Draupadi**. Much  
of Drupada’s life is absorbed by his  
struggle with **Drona**, who has been one  
of Drupada’s fellow students. After their  
course of studies is finished, Drupada  
assumes his throne and lives quite lavishly, whereas Drona is so poor that he  
cannot even afford to feed his family. In  
distress, Drona approaches Drupada for  
help, reminding him of their past connection. Drupada arrogantly dismisses  
him, telling him that such ties are of no  
consequence. Drona swears that he will  
get revenge, and after teaching the arts  
of war to the **Pandavas** and **Kauravas**,  
the two royal factions whose battle for  
power is at the heart of the  
*Mahabharata*, demands Drupada’s  
kingdom as his preceptor’s fee  
(**dakshina**). After Drupada is defeated,  
Drona takes half of his kingdom, whereupon Drupada swears revenge. He performs a great **sacrifice** to give **birth** to a  
**son** who will kill Drona. Two children  
emerge from the sacrificial **fire**:  
Dhrshtadyumna, who eventually kills  
Drona; and Draupadi, who becomes the  
wife of all five **Pandavas**. During the  
Mahabharata war, Drupada fights on the  
side of the Pandavas, his sons-in-law. He  
is eventually killed in battle by Drona  
but is later avenged by his son  
Dhrshtadyumna, who kills Drona.
