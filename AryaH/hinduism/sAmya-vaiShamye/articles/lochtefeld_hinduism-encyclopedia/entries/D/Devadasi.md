title = "Devadasi"

+++
(“[female] servant of the lord”) Name for  
a class of **women** kept in temples as  
singers and dancers in the service of the  
temple’s presiding **deity**, to whom they  
were usually considered to be “married.”  
Their special status prevented them  
from marrying human husbands,  
although in many cases they would form  
long-term liaisons with prominent local  
men. Any **daughters** born from such  
liaisons would in turn be dedicated to  
the temple, while **sons** would be trained  
as musicians. In many cases, devadasis  
had unusual legal rights, such as the  
ability to own, manage, and transfer  
property, which for most women were  
vested only in their husbands. At best,  
these devadasis were literate and cultured women, whose talents brought  
them considerable status, while at worst  
(as was often the case in the nineteenth  
century) they were prostitutes whose  
services enriched the temple. The latter  
183  
Devadasi  
situation prompted the British to formally ban this practice, despite their  
general reluctance to interfere in Hindu  
religious affairs.
