title = "Devaprayag"

+++
(“divine confluence”) Sacred town  
(**tirtha**) in the northern part of the state  
of **Uttar Pradesh**, in the **Himalaya**  
Mountains about sixty miles up the  
**Ganges** from the city of **Haridwar**.  
Devaprayag is sacred because it is at the  
confluence of the **Bhagirathi** and  
**Alakananda** rivers, the largest Himalayan  
tributaries of the Ganges. Devaprayag is  
the final such river confluence in the  
Himalayas, and it is at this confluence  
that the Ganges is definitively formed as  
one indivisible sacred stream.
