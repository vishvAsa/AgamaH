title = "Dakshinayana"

+++
The six months of the solar **year** in  
which the **sun** is reckoned as moving  
southward. In the Gregorian **calendar**,  
this is the period between the summer  
solstice and the winter solstice (roughly  
December 20 to June 20) and is based on  
the actual motion of the sun with  
respect to the **earth**. The Indian reckoning is based on the motion of the sun  
through the **zodiac**, which is calculated  
differently than in western astrology. The  
Dakshinayana begins on **Karka**  
**Sankranti** (the **day** the sun is thought to  
enter Cancer, usually July 14), and ends  
the day before **Makara Sankranti** (the  
day the sun enters Capricorn, usually  
January 14). The Dakshinayana is considered less auspicious than the  
**Uttarayana**, the six months in which the  
sun travels north, because the southern  
direction is associated with the **Yama**,  
the god associated with death, judgment, and punishment for evildoers.
