(“incense”) The eleventh of the sixteen  
traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”)  
given to a **deity** as part of **worship**,  
which follows the model of treating a  
deity as an honored guest. In this offering, the deity is offered incense to enjoy  
the scent. The underlying motive here,  
as for all the upacharas, is to show one’s  
love for the deity and minister to the  
deity’s needs.
