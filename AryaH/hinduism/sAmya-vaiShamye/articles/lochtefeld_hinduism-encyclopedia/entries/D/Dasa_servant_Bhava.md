title = "Dasa (“servant”) Bhava"

+++
The second of the five **modes of devotion** (system of devotion to a **deity**) to  
God that were most prominently  
articulated by **Rupa Goswami**, a devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna** and a  
follower of the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**.  
Rupa used differing types of human  
relationships as models for differing  
conceptions of the link between deity  
and devotee. These five modes  
showed growing emotional intensity,  
from the peaceful (**shanta**) sense that  
comes from realizing one’s complete  
identity with **Brahman**, or Ultimate  
Reality, to conceiving of God as one’s  
master, friend, child, or lover. The  
Dasa Bhava is the second of these, in  
which devotees considered themselves as servants and the deity as  
their master. This second mode of  
devotion should be understood in  
light of the relationship between masters and servants in Indian society,  
which goes far beyond that of employer and employee in modern American  
society. A family’s servants will often  
stay with a family for many years and  
in some cases, such service becomes  
hereditary. Longtime servants become  
virtual members of the family; they  
are respected, trusted, and sometimes  
regarded as advisers.
