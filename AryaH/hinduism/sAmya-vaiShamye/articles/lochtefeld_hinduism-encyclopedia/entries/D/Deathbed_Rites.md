title = "Deathbed Rites"

+++
General term for the rites done for a  
dying person. These rites have a twofold  
purpose: to purify the person’s body,  
and, more importantly, to calm the  
mind. The first is generally done by  
applying holy substances, such as  
**Ganges water** or a **Tulsi** leaf. In some  
cases, the dying person will also hold the  
tail of a **cow**, since according to popular  
mythology this will enable the person to  
cross the **Vaitarani River**, the river leading to the afterlife. The emphasis on  
calming the dying person’s mind comes  
from the belief that one’s dying thoughts  
have enormous karmic ramifications for  
future lives. Ideally, the dying person  
should be calm and composed, since  
any sort of fear or agitation is believed to  
have negative consequences. One  
method to help promote such calmness  
is to read passages from religious texts,  
whether to remind the hearer of the  
body’s impermanence, or to have the  
last thing one hears be the name of God.  
At the moment of death the dying person is often placed on the **earth**—perhaps so that the earth can absorb the  
impurity (**ashaucha**) of the **corpse**, or  
perhaps as a symbol that whatever a  
person’s status in life, all human beings  
eventually share the same fate. After  
death the rites associated with **cremation** begin, which are the next set of rites  
in the series known as the **antyeshthi**  
**samskara** (“last rites”).
