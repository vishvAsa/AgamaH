title = "Diwali"

+++
One of the most important festivals in  
the Hindu religious **year**, which falls on  
the **new moon** in the **lunar month** of  
**Kartik** (October–November). This festival is dedicated to **Vishnu’s** wife  
**Lakshmi**, a **goddess** who represents  
wealth, prosperity, and good fortune.  
According to popular belief, on this  
night of the new moon Lakshmi roams  
the **earth**, looking for households in  
which she will be welcomed, and which  
she will render prosperous by her presence. People spend the days before  
Diwali cleaning, repairing, and whitewashing their homes to make them suitable for welcoming the goddess. On the  
evening of Diwali people open all their  
doors and windows to facilitate her  
entry and place lights on their windowsills and balcony ledges, as an invitation to the goddess. In earlier times  
these lights would be clay lamps or candles, but today strings of electric lights  
are also widely used. It is from these  
lights that Diwali gets its name, as a  
shortened form of Dipavali (**dipa** “light”  
\+ *avali* “series”). The charter myth for  
200  
Divorce  
displaying these lights describes how a  
poor old woman somehow gained a  
royal boon that all houses but hers  
would remain unlit on the night of  
Diwali. When Lakshmi wandered the  
land she went to the only house that was  
lit to welcome her. Because of Lakshmi’s  
presence, the old woman’s troubles  
quickly ceased.  
Lakshmi’s strong associations with  
money and good fortune account for  
several other practices often found on  
Diwali. For many traditional merchant  
families, Diwali is observed as the  
beginning of the fiscal year. All outstanding debts and obligations must be  
cleared up beforehand, for on Diwali  
new account books are begun. In some  
cases the account ledgers are themselves ceremonially worshiped on this  
day and are seen as material manifestations of Lakshmi. Another common  
practice is **gambling**, although in most  
cases it is done within the family, and for  
small stakes. During the rest of the year  
gambling is condemned as a potential  
drain on one’s wealth, but doing so on  
Diwali reaffirms the connection  
between money and Lakshmi’s favor,  
here in the guise of Lady Luck. Diwali is  
also an occasion for **eating** sweets—the  
more the better—and celebrating the  
advent of the new year by shooting off  
fireworks. India’s loose regulation of fireworks gives celebrants access to rockets  
and crackers of truly impressive size,  
and in the larger cities people celebrate  
the holiday with such zeal that it sounds  
like an artillery barrage.
