+++
(“**sacrifice** to the gods”) One of the  
Five Great Sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**) that is prescribed in the texts on  
religious duty (**dharma literature**).  
These Five Great Sacrifices are prescribed daily religious observances for  
a “**twice-born**” householder, that is, a  
householder who has been born into  
one of the three twice-born groups in  
Indian society—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**,  
or **vaishya**—and who has received the  
adolescent religious **initiation** known  
as the “second birth.” Each of the five  
sacrifices (**yajna**) is directed toward a  
different class of beings—from the  
Absolute Reality down to **animals**—  
and is satisfied by different actions.  
The devayajna is directed toward the  
gods and is satisfied by **homa**, the  
**offerings** of clarified butter into the  
sacred **fire**. In the time since these  
texts were composed, Hindu life has  
undergone significant changes, and  
since most Hindu homes no longer  
maintain a sacred fire, this particular  
rite has been largely omitted.
