In some sense, most divisions of time  
are arbitrary, which is a feature that  
appears in several different dimensions  
of the traditional Indian divisions of the  
day. The twenty-four hours of the solar  
day can be divided using several different measures of time, some of which do  
not exactly correspond with one another,  
and these differing times can also be  
subject to judgments about their symbolic values. In one system, the day is  
divided into eight equal periods (**prahars**) of three hours each. These eight  
periods mark the general progress during the day and night, with the first of  
these prahars ending at sunrise. Shorter  
units of time are reckoned in periods of  
about twenty-four minutes called  
**ghatikas**, of which there are sixty in  
every twenty-four hours. The ghatika  
supposedly takes its name from the clay  
pots (ghata) that were used to make  
water-clocks; these pots measured time  
by the amount of water that dripped  
through a small hole. Two ghatikas make  
a **muhurta**, of which there are thirty  
during each twenty-four hours. The  
reckonings of the day in prahars and  
ghatikas thus do not exactly correspond  
to one another, since each prahar has  
7.5 ghatikas. Based on this, it would  
seem that the former marks the more  
general divisions of each day and the  
latter more specific time periods.  
The other way in which the times of  
day can be viewed is with regard to their  
symbolic value. The most auspicious  
time of day is the “Time of **Brahma**”  
(**Brahma muhurta**), the period immediately before sunrise. This is reckoned the  
best time of the entire day for **worship**,  
meditation, or any type of religious  
practice. Although this is named a  
muhurta, and thus should be limited to  
forty-eight minutes, the Brahma muhurta  
is often thought to encompass the entire  
three hours in the day’s first prahar.  
Hence, it is not unusual for devout  
religious people to arise around 3 A.M.,  
to take advantage of this period. In contrast, the immediately preceding prahar  
(roughly midnight to 3 A.M.) is the most  
inauspicious in the day, a time when  
spirits and **demons** are loose. Sleep is  
the most appropriate activity for this  
time; other activities are appropriate  
only when absolutely necessary. The  
only time religious practices are done  
during this time is when they are part of  
an all-night ceremony (jagaran), or a  
continuous reading (**akhand path**) of a  
religious text. In following the most  
inauspicious and chaotic period with  
the most auspicious, the cycle of the day  
(as well as the **year**) mirrors that of the  
cosmos, whose gradual and continuing  
degeneration are suddenly replaced  
with complete renewal and regeneration.
