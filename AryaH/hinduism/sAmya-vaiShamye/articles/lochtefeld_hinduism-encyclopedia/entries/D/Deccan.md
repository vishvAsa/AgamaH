+++
A region of the Indian subcontinent. In  
its broadest usage, this word can refer to  
all of India south of the **Vindhya**  
**Mountains**, the range that divides  
northern and southern India. More  
specifically, this term denotes the dry  
and hilly plateau in the northern and  
eastern parts of the region south of the  
Vindhyas, bounded on the east and west  
by the highlands known as the Eastern  
and Western **Ghats**. In Hindu cultural  
terms, the Deccan is a transitional cultural area between the northern Indian  
plain and the deep south.
