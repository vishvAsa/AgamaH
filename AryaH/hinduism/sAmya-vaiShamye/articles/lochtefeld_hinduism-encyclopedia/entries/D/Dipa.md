(“lamp”) The twelfth of the sixteen traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to  
a **deity** as part of **worship**, following the  
model of treating the deity as an honored guest. In this action, the deity is  
given an offering of light by waving a  
lighted lamp before it. This rite more  
commonly goes by the name of **arati**, a  
word that is often used to denote worship in general. The underlying motive  
here, as for all the upacharas, is to show  
one’s love for the deity, and to minister  
to the deity’s needs.
