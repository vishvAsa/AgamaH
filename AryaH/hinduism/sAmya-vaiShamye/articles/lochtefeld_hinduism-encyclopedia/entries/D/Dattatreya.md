title = "Dattatreya"

+++
In the religious texts known as the  
**puranas**, Dattatreya is a famous **ascetic**  
and is considered to be a partial **avatar**  
(incarnation) of the god **Vishnu**. Many  
modern ascetics consider him a paradigm for **asceticism**, and Dattatreya has  
actually been installed as a **deity** in certain places associated with ascetics,  
such as Mount **Girnar**. Dattatreyaâ€™s  
mother is **Anasuya**, and he is born after  
she has done a great favor to the gods.  
According to the story, a faithful wife  
named Silavati curses the **sun** not to  
rise, and in consequence the creatures  
of the **earth** are greatly troubled.  
Anasuya succeeds in persuading Silavati  
to recall her **curse**, and in their gratitude, the gods **Brahma**, Vishnu, and  
**Shiva** inform her that she may ask for  
whatever she wants. Anasuya requests  
that each be born as one of her **sons**,  
and this is granted: Vishnu is born as  
Dattatreya, Shiva as **Durvasas**, and  
Brahma as Chandra.
