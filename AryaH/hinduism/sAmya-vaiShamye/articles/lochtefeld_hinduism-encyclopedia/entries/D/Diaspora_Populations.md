Although the vast majority of Hindus  
live in their traditional homeland of  
South Asia, particularly in India and  
**Nepal**, there is also a long history of  
Hindus settling in other lands. By about  
the fourth century C.E., Hindu traders  
had spread Indian influence throughout  
Southeast Asia, where the monuments  
at the **Angkor** temple complex and the  
culture of **Bali** bear witness to its presence. In the past century, poverty and  
overcrowding in certain parts of India  
(especially **Bihar**) led many of these  
traders to sign up as agricultural contract laborers in **Fiji**, **South Africa**, East  
Africa, the **West Indies**, **Mauritius**, and  
even **Sri Lanka**. All of these places have  
substantial Hindu communities,  
although their local status differs. In  
some of these places Indians are considered equal citizens with the indigenous  
peoples, and in others, such as Fiji, they  
suffer legal obstacles. Aside from agricultural labor, another possibility for  
mobility and advancement came  
through serving in the British army or  
196  
Dhupa  
civil service in other parts of the British  
Empire, such as Singapore or Hong  
Kong. Finally, the liberalization of immigration and nationalization laws since  
the end of World War II has led to the formation of a substantial Hindu community in North America, both in Canada  
and the United States.
