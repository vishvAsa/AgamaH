+++
(“Divine Composition”) Shorter name  
for the **Nalayira Divyaprabandham**,  
the collected hymns of the **Alvars**. The  
Alvars were a group of twelve **Vaishnava**  
poet-saints (devotees of the god  
**Vishnu**), who lived in southern India  
between the seventh and tenth centuries. In conjunction with their **Shaiva**  
(devotees of the god **Shiva**) counterparts, the **Nayanars**, the Alvars spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu  
religion vis-à-vis the Buddhists and the  
Jains. Both the Alvars and the Nayanars  
stressed passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to  
a personal god—Vishnu for the Alvars,  
Shiva for the Nayanars—and conveyed  
this devotion through hymns sung in  
the **Tamil language**. In the southern  
Indian religious community known as  
the **Shrivaishnavas**, the collected  
hymns of the Alvars have such high status that they are known as the “Tamil  
Veda”—that is, the religious texts in  
the Tamil language which carry the  
authority of the **Veda**, the oldest Hindu  
religious texts.
