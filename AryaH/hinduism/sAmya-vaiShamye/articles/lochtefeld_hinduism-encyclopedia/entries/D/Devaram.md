title = "Devaram"

+++
Name for the collected hymns of the  
poet-saints **Appar**, **Sambandar**, and  
**Sundaramurtti**. These were the most  
important of the **Nayanars**, a group of  
sixty-three **Shaiva** poet-saints who lived  
in southern India between the seventh  
and ninth centuries. Along with their  
**Vaishnava** counterparts, the **Alvars**, the  
Nayanars spearheaded the revitalization  
of Hindu religion versus the Buddhists  
and the Jains. Both the Nayanars and the  
Alvars stressed passionate devotion  
(**bhakti**) to a personal god—**Shiva** for  
the Nayanars, **Vishnu** for the Alvars—  
and conveyed this devotion through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**.  
Appar and Sambandar were the first of  
the Nayanars, and Sundaramurtti was  
the last. Although the hymns in the  
Devaram are devotional, they form the  
basis for the philosophical school  
known as **Shaiva Siddhanta**, and are  
thus considered the holiest of the Tamil  
Shaivite texts. The hymns are also  
marked by opposition and hostility  
to non-Hindu traditions, particularly  
the Jains, with whom the Nayanars  
were apparently contesting for influence  
and patronage.
