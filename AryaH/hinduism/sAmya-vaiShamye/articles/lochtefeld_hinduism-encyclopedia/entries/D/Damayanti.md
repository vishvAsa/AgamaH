title = "Damayanti"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the **daughter** of the  
king of Vidarbha and the wife of King  
**Nala**. The story of Nala and Damayanti  
appears as a story within the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics. It is recounted to the five  
**Pandava** brothers, the epicâ€™s protagonists, during a twelve-year exile in the  
forest as a way to keep up their spirits by  
telling how others had transcended  
misfortune.  
In the story, when Damayanti comes  
of marriageable age, her father sends  
invitations to the kings of the **earth**,  
announcing her **svayamvara**, a rite in  
which Damayanti will choose her own  
husband. The kings of the earth come to  
the svayamvara to seek her hand, as do  
the gods (**devas**) themselves. Yet  
Damayanti has already decided, with  
the help of a swan who has praised King  
Nala to her, to choose Nala. The gods try  
to foil this by taking on physical bodies  
identical to Nala, so that Damayanti will  
not be able to tell the difference between  
them. As a last resort, Damayanti makes  
an **act of truth**, a ritual action whose  
efficacy is based on the **power of truth**  
itself. In her act of truth, Damayanti  
declares that she has never loved anyone but Nala, and directs the gods to  
resume their true forms to prove that  
this statement is true. The gods immediately do as she commands, compelled  
by the power of truth. Nala and  
Damayanti are married, and as a reward  
for her fidelity the gods give Nala various  
divine gifts. Hearing of the marriage, two  
of the rejected suitors curse Nala to lose  
his kingdom, and like all **curses** in  
Indian mythology, this eventually comes  
to pass. Because of the curse, Nala and  
Damayanti are separated and suffer  
long tribulations, including Nala having  
his body magically changed so that no  
one would be able to recognize him. In  
the end Damayanti recognizes him by  
168  
Dalit  
his divine gifts, which could not be hidden, and the lovers are happily reunited.
