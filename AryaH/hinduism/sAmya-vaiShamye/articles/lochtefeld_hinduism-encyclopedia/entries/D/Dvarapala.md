(“door-protector”) Guardian images  
placed on either side of the entrance to  
a Hindu temple. These figures are usually portrayed as minor celestial beings  
and conceived as the protectors of the  
sacred space inside. Since any Hindu  
temple is first and foremost the home  
for the **deity** within, and since both  
kings and gods often used the same  
symbols to display and reinforce their

Dvapara Yuga  
status, it is not surprising that the  
deities would have some “servants”  
guarding theirs door and restricting  
access to them, in the same way as their  
human counterparts.
