When a single divinity is deemed to be  
the supreme power in the universe, he  
or she is generally said to wield five overarching divine powers: creation, ordering and maintaining the cosmos,  
destruction, concealment, and giving  
**grace** (divine self-revelation). The first  
three powers describe the relationship  
between the **deity** and the physical universe, whereas the fourth and fifth focus  
on the deity’s relationship with individual devotees. By using the power of concealment, the deity becomes hidden  
in creation, and thus human beings  
are kept in ignorance. This power  
of concealment is often also described  
as the deity’s **maya**, or the power of  
illusion that keeps human beings from

behind all things. This power of illusion  
is so strong that the only way human  
beings can break through it is through  
the deity’s grace, the final power. This  
grace is an act of divine self-revelation,  
in which the deity shreds the concealing  
veil of illusion and reveals himself or  
herself to human beings.
