title = "Deities"

+++
This is a word with various possible  
meanings in different contexts. On one  
hand, it can refer to the gods (**devas**).  
These are beings who live in one of the  
heavenly realms, by virtue of their past  
good **karma** (actions), but who are still  
subject to the law of karma and who  
therefore must someday be reborn in a  
lower state. This word can also refer to  
the Supreme Reality, which can best be  
designated as “God,” although the  
Hindu imagination has given it various  
names: **Brahman**, the **Goddess**, **Vishnu**,  
**Shiva**, **Ganesh**, and a host of other  
deities in the pantheon, including **village deities**.
