title = "Devaki"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the god **Krishna’s**  
mother. Krishna is considered the  
eighth **avatar** (incarnation) of the god  
**Vishnu**, and like all of the avatars, he  
comes down to **earth** to restore the cosmic balance by destroying the forces of  
evil that are upsetting it. Devaki is the  
niece of King **Kamsa**, the evil king of  
**Mathura**, and on the day she is married  
a heavenly voice proclaims that her  
eighth child will kill Kamsa. Kamsa seeks  
to destroy this prophecy by imprisoning  
Devaki and her husband, **Vasudeva**,  
killing each of their children as they are  
born. Devaki’s seventh child is magically  
transferred to the womb of her co-wife,  
**Rohini**, and is born as **Balarama**.  
At the **birth** of the eighth child,  
**Krishna**, the locked gates magically  
open, and a deep sleep falls over all the  
guards, allowing Vasudeva to spirit the  
infant child to his foster parents, **Nanda**  
and **Yashoda**.
