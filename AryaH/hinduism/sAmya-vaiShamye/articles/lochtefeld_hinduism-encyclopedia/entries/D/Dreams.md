As symbol and reality, dreams have  
multiple uses in Hindu thought.  
Philosophically, dreams are often used  
as examples to illustrate the illusory  
nature of the world as it is perceived.  
Just as a dream disappears when one

Built in the Dravida architectural style, the  
Minakshi Temple contains enormous gopurams,  
the gateways to the temple grounds.  
wakes up and is perceived to have been  
unreal the entire time, so does the everyday understanding of the world disappear when one has perceived the  
ultimate truth. In quite a different  
understanding, the dream state is the  
second of the states of consciousness  
mentioned in the **Mandukya Upanishad**,  
or one of the religious texts known as  
the **Upanishads**. In the Upanishads,  
the dream state is the first step in turning one’s awareness away from the outside world and into one’s Self, where all  
sense of ego is lost. Waking consciousness is further away from one’s Self  
than the dream state. The four-step  
pattern in this upanishad, and in others as well, is from waking consciousness, to dreams, to deep sleep, and  
from there to the realization of the  
eternal Self.  
On quite another level, dreams are  
an important part of religious life in  
popular Hinduism. They are often  
believed to give **omens** for the future,  
which may be interpreted as favorable  
or unfavorable, according to the dream’s  
content and context. Dreams are also  
seen as providing a channel for communicating with spirits, **ghosts**, **village**  
**deities**, and other nonhuman spiritual  
beings. Unquiet spirits of the dead will  
often appear to family members in  
dreams to reveal what they need to find  
peace. The same process is often found  
with village deities, who usually manifest themselves to specific people in the  
village, either to give warnings or to  
make demands.
