In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Dushyanta  
is a king of the **Lunar Line** and  
the husband of **Shakuntala**. Their  
romance is also described in **Kalidasa’s**  
drama **Abhijnanashakuntala**. Dushyanta  
meets Shakuntala, who is living in a forest **ashram** (abode of an **ascetic**), while  
he is hunting in the forest. They fall in  
love and are married by their mutual  
consent. After a short time Dushyanta  
has to return to his kingdom, with  
Shakuntala to follow soon after. In the  
meantime, Shakuntala has been cursed  
by the sage **Durvasas** that her beloved  
will completely forget her, although  
Durvasas later modifies the **curse**, and  
says that Dushyanta will remember  
everything if Shakuntala can show him  
any proof of their union. The bulk of the  
story in both episodes is concerned  
with Shakuntala’s trials and tribulations  
as she strives to regain her rightful place  
as queen. In both versions, Dushyanta  
is a minor character, but clearly an  
essential one.
