title = "Dharna"

+++
Name for a rite intended to compel  
another party to address one’s grievances; the rite is usually adopted when  
all other options have failed. The word  
*dharna* comes from the **Sanskrit** (sacred  
language) verb that means “to hold” or  
“to maintain.” One element in the dharna  
rite is just that—the persistent public  
presence of the supplicant in proximity  
to the people to whom he or she is  
appealing. Thus, an aggrieved civil  
servant in modern India may hold a  
dharna near the Parliament building  
in Delhi, and in some cases people  
have camped there for months in an  
effort to publicize their plight and  
mobilize public opinion. In the same  
way, people may hold a dharna at the  
temple of a **deity** to seek guidance or  
help; the most prominent example of  
this is at the **Tarakeshvar** temple in the  
state of **West Bengal**.  
Aside from persistent presence,  
dharna’s other common characteristic is  
self-inflicted suffering, usually done  
through fasting (**upavasa**) or other  
forms of **ascetic** self-denial. Pilgrims to  
Tarakeshvar refrain from **eating** or  
drinking until the god **Shiva** grants them  
a vision, although in practice the temple  
priests often limit such exertions to  
three days. On the political level,  
**Mohandas K. Gandhi** perfected the “fast  
unto death” as a tool to help attain his  
political ends. One of the cultural  
assumptions that helps make such selfinflicted suffering persuasive is the  
ancient Hindu belief that by voluntarily  
enduring physical suffering (**tapas**) one  
can generate spiritual and magical  
power. The other working assumption  
that makes the dharna effective comes  
from the declaration at the rite’s beginning. On the human level, dharnas are  
usually undertaken to address very specific perceived injustices, which are  
made public at the start. It is generally  
believed that should the person performing dharna die, then the person  
against whom the dharna had been held  
will be assessed the karmic demerit for  
causing that person’s death. Such dharnas are generally only undertaken when  
one has no other alternative. Because of  
this assumption, they remain a powerful  
resource, even in contemporary times.
