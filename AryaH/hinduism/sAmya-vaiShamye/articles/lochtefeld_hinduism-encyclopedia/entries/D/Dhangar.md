The model for traditional Indian society  
was a collection of **endogamous** subgroups known as **jatis** (“birth”). These  
jatis were organized (and their social  
status determined) by the group’s hereditary occupation, over which each group  
had a monopoly. In traditional central  
Indian society, the Dhangars were a  
Hindu jati whose hereditary occupation  
was herding sheep and goats. They  
are particularly associated with the state  
of **Maharashtra**.
