A divine war horse described in a few of  
the hymns in the **Vedas**, the oldest  
Hindu religious texts. The Vedas were  
the religious hymns of a group known  
as the **Aryans**, and hymns throughout  
the Vedas clearly show the importance  
of horse-drawn chariots as weapons of  
war. Given this importance, it is not  
surprising that one finds a divinized  
horse in these hymns, even if it is only a  
minor figure.
