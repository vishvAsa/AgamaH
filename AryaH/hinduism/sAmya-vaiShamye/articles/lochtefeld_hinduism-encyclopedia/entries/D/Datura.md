title = "Datura"

+++
(from **Sanskrit** word *dhattura*) Name for  
a genus of plants known as the thornapple, which is a distant relative of the  
potato. The datura plant contains poisonous alkaloids, which when consumed  
in small quantities produce intoxication, and in larger quantities, sickness  
and death. Devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva** eat the datura plant’s swollen

seedpods as **intoxicants**, in imitation of  
their patron divinity’s narcotic revels.  
Needless to say, because of its danger,  
datura must be consumed with great  
care, and under the direction of someone who knows its nature.
