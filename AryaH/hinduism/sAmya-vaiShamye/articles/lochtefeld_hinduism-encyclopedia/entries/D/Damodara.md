(*dama* “rope” + *udara* “waist”) Epithet of  
the god **Krishna**, given in memory of a  
particular incident in his childhood. In  
an effort to curb Krishna’s mischief by  
restricting his movements, Krishna’s foster mother, **Yashoda**, uses a rope to tie  
her toddling boy to the heavy stone  
mortar used in grinding grain. The mortar’s weight is more than sufficient to  
restrain any normal child, but for  
Krishna it proves no hindrance, and he  
proceeds to crawl about, dragging the  
mortar after him. At one point the mortar becomes wedged between two trees  
growing closely together, and Krishna  
pulls so hard that the trees are uprooted.  
After the trees fall to the ground, they  
immediately disappear, and in their  
place stand two young men. These are  
**sons** of the god **Kubera** who have been  
cursed to take the form of a tree until  
Krishna comes to save them.
