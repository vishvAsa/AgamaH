(“door” or “gateway”) Among the  
**Bairagis**, renunciant ascetics who are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**,  
the word *dwara* is used to denote a  
branch or subsect of a particular order.  
Each dwara is named after its **ascetic**  
founder, who was himself usually a  
noted disciple of the larger order’s  
founder. For example, the **Nimbarki**  
ascetics are one of the four established orders among the militant  
**Vaishnava** ascetics known as the  
**chatuh-sampradayi Nagas**, along with  
the **Ramanandis**, the **Vishnuswamis**,  
and the Madhva Gaudiya (**Brahma sampraday**) ascetics. The Nimbarkis themselves are divided into nine dwaras, or  
subsects, each named after the dwara’s  
founder. The division of ascetics by  
means of dwaras is another means of  
subdividing ascetic orders, and creating  
even more sharply defined ascetic identities and loyalties.
