title = "Dhenuka"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a fierce **demon**  
(supernatural being) who appears in the  
form of a **cow** (dhenu). Dhenuka is only  
one of the demons slain by the god  
**Krishna**—this time in concert with his  
brother **Balarama**—during Krishna’s  
childhood in the village of **Brindavan**. In  
these episodes, Krishna dispatches the  
most ferocious demons as if it were  
child’s play, which in one sense it is.  
Krishna’s presence in the world, and his  
interaction with his devotees (**bhakta**),  
is considered to be a **lila** (“play”), and  
the ease with which he handles these  
demons attests to this playful revelation  
of his divine nature. For further consideration of this theme, see David R.  
Kinsley, *The Sword and the Flute*, 1975.
