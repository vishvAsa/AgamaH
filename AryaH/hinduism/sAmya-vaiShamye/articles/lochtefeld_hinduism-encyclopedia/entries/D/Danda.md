(“stick”) A symbol of authority in traditional Hindu culture. On one hand, this  
stick referred to royal authority and was  
visibly evident as a scepter or mace, but  
was considered emblematic of the king’s  
obligation to maintain social order by  
inflicting punishment on evildoers. This  
rule through punishment (**dandaniti**)  
was the king’s role and duty in traditional  
Indian ideas of kingship, for without  
such rule normal social life would be  
impossible. In a different context, the  
staff can be a symbol of **ascetic**  
authority. Among the **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasis**, a group of **ascetics** who are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**, the  
ascetics with the highest status carry a  
staff as a sign of their authority, and are  
known as **Dandi Sanyasis**.
