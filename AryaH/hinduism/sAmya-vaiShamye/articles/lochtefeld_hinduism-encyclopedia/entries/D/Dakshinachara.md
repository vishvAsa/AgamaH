(“right-hand practice”) In the secret ritual  
tradition known as **tantra**, this is the  
term for a type of tantric practice that  
does not avail itself of any forbidden  
substances or promote any behavior  
that the orthodox would consider scandalous or objectionable. It stands in  
opposition to the **vamachara**, or “lefthand practice,” which uses such forbidden substances in its ritual, and shows  
no such regard for conventional sensibilities. The most common forbidden  
substances are the Five Forbidden  
Things (**panchamakara**), so called  
because they all begin with the letter  
“m” (in the sacred language of **Sanskrit**,  
*makara*) **madya** (wine), **matsya** (fish),  
**mamsa** (meat), **mudra** (fermented or  
parched grain), and **maithuna** (copulation). In left-hand tantra these forbidden things are used in their actual  
forms, whereas right-hand practitioners  
substitute other more socially  
acceptable things for them. This is one  
more instance of the pervasive Hindu  
polarity between right and left, which  
carries inherent value judgments. In this  
case, the left-hand practitioners are  
seen as impure and dangerous, because  
they intentionally violate social boundaries, whereas the right-hand are  
socially respectable. For further
