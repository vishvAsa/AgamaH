Until the twentieth century, formal  
divorce did not exist in traditional  
Hindu society. This absence was  
undoubtedly rooted in the Hindu perspective on marriage. Marriage was  
seen as a permanent binding of husband and wife (or more precisely,  
assimilating her identity to his), in a  
way that ruled out a dissolving of the  
marriage while both members were  
still living. When a wife failed to bear  
children, the husband would sometimes take a second wife, but the original marriage would remain intact.  
Among the lower social classes, who  
were often less concerned with maintaining group status through appropriate behavior, husbands and wives would  
simply abandon their spouses for other  
partners, but this was strictly forbidden  
among “respectable” people.  
Divorce is legally available in modern  
India, but social and cultural factors  
continue to weigh against it. Various factors make many **women** in unhappy  
marriages reluctant to sue for divorce:  
lack of support from their natal families,  
who are often more interested in trying  
to make the marriage work; the inability  
to earn a living on their own; and the  
near certainty that their husband’s families will be awarded custody of their  
children, if they have any. Although attitudes are slowly changing, it is also still  
difficult for divorced women to remarry.
