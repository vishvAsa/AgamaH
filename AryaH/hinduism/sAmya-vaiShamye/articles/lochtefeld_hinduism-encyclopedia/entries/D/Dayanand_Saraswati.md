(1824–1883) Nineteenth-century reformist  
**ascetic** and founder of the **Arya Samaj**, a  
reformist Hindu organization. The late  
nineteenth century was an era of  
sweeping social, economic, and  
religious change in northern India, and  
the Arya Samaj was an authentically  
Hindu response to these forces.  
Dayanand’s mission for the Arya Samaj  
was to reform and revitalize Hinduism  
by purging it of the “false practices” that  
had gradually crept in. Swami  
Dayanand’s fundamental assumption  
was that ultimate religious authority lay  
only in the ancient scriptures called the  
**Vedas**, and that any contemporary  
religious practices not found in the  
Vedas were mistaken, odious, and  
deserved to be abandoned. This stance  
allowed him to attack many of the  
“social evils” plaguing nineteenthcentury Hinduism, such as child  
marriages, **sati** (the rite in which a  
**widow** would be burned on her  
husband’s funeral pyre), “idolatrous”  
image **worship**, untouchability, a ban  
on widow remarriage, and the unequal  
status of **women**. In claiming that such  
practices were “corrupt,” Dayanand had  
found not only a viable strategy for  
reform, but a way to undercut the claims  
of Christian missionaries, who pointed  
to such evils as evidence that Hindu religion was inferior to Christianity.  
Unlike its predecessor, the **Brahmo**  
**Samaj**, which was heavily influenced by  
Christianity, the Arya Samaj was a Hindu  
response drawing from purely Hindu  
sources. Dayanand belonged to the first  
generation of Hindus aiming to reassert  
the greatness of Hinduism as opposed  
to the Christian missionary challenge,  
and much of his writing is militantly  
anti-Christian. One sign of his crusading  
spirit is his support for the ceremony of  
purification (**shuddhi**), through which  
Hindus who had become members of  
other religious communities were received  
back into the Hindu community.  
Although the Arya Samaj claimed that  
they were simply getting back to the  
**Veda**, the ultimate aim was not to  
reclaim that long-gone era, but to  
develop a form of Hindu religious life  
more compatible with “modern” times.  
Thus, even though Dayanand was “traditionalist” in his emphasis on the  
Vedas, he was radical in insisting that  
the Vedas should be accessible to all  
people, including groups such as  
women and the **shudras**, or the lowest  
social group, both of whom had traditionally been forbidden to read or even  
hear it. During his ministry Dayanand  
spoke throughout India, attacking any  
and all religions not rooted in the Vedas,  
including contemporary Hinduism. His  
eloquence, charisma, and commitment  
brought him considerable success, but  
also many enemies, and he was eventually assassinated by poisoning. For further information see Dayanand
