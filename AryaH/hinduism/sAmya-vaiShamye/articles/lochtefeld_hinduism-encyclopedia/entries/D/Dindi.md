Pilgrim group in the **Varkari Panth**, a  
religious community that is centered  
around the **worship** of the god **Vithoba**  
at his temple at **Pandharpur** in modern  
**Maharashtra**. The primary Varkari religious practice is taking part in two  
annual pilgrimages, in which all the participants arrive in Pandharpur on the  
same day. On this pilgrimage, pilgrims  
travel in groups called dindis. Dindis are  
often made up of people from the same  
neighborhood or area and are usually  
formed along **caste** lines. During the pilgrimage, members of a dindi travel as a  
unit, walking and singing devotional  
hymns together during the day, and  
cooking and camping together at night.  
These dindis thus create smaller  
subcommunities within the larger  
pilgrim body.
