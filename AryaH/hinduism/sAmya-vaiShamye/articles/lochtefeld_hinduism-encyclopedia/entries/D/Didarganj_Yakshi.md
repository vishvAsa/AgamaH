title = "Didarganj Yakshi"

+++
Statue found in 1919 in Didarganj, a village near Patna in the state of **Bihar**. The  
image is believed to date from the third  
century B.C.E. and is thus a product of  
the **Maurya dynasty**. The statue is of a  
voluptuous female figure, bare to the  
waist, wearing abundant jewelry and  
bearing a yak-tail whisk (**chauri**), which  
was a contemporary sign of authority. It  
is believed to be a statue of a **yakshi**, a  
class of nature-spirits connected with  
fertility and prosperity. It is notable as  
one of the earliest known stone statues,  
and there is speculation that this may  
have come through contact with the  
Greeks. The figure itself is masterfully  
rendered in highly polished **Chunar**  
sandstone from the sandstone quarries  
near **Benares**; the sharply detailed rendering of her clothing and jewelry conveys the illusion of softness and swelling  
of the bare flesh.
