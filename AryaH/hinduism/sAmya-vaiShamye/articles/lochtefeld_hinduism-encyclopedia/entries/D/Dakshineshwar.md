Temple site about four miles north  
of modern Calcutta, on the eastern bank  
of the Hugli River. Dakshineshwar’s

Dakshineshwar  
Temple in Dakshineshwar dedicated to the goddess Kali.  
primary **deity** is the powerful and dangerous **goddess Kali**, although like most  
Hindu temples it also has images of  
most of the deities in the pantheon.  
Dakshineshwar’s importance comes not  
from its age—the primary image was  
consecrated in 1855, and it is thus a relatively recent site—but through its  
association with the Bengali saint  
**Ramakrishna**, who lived there for most  
of his life.
