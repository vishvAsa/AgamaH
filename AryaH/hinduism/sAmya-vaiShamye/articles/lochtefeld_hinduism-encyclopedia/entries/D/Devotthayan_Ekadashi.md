+++
Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the bright (waxing) half of  
the **lunar month** of **Kartik** (October–  
November). This is celebrated as the day  
on which the god **Vishnu** awakens from  
his four-month slumber, having fallen  
asleep on **Devshayani Ekadashi**  
(“eleventh day festival”) in **Ashadh**  
(June–July). When Vishnu has arisen  
from sleep, the ritually dangerous  
**chaturmas** (“four-month”) period is  
over, and auspicious life-cycle rites such  
as weddings and the **sacred thread** ceremony (“adolescent **initiation**”) may be  
performed again.
