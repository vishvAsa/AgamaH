Town in the Pune district of **Maharashtra**  
state, sixty-five miles east and south of  
Bombay. It is most famous as the  
home of the poet-saint **Tukaram**, one  
of most important figures in the  
**Varkari Panth**. The Varkaris are a religious community centered around the  
**worship** of the Hindu god **Vithoba**, at  
his temple at **Pandharpur** in modern  
Maharashtra. Varkari religious practice  
centers primarily around two annual  
pilgrimages in which all the participants arrive in Pandharpur on the  
same day. Tukaram still symbolically  
travels to Pandharpur twice each year;  
a **palanquin** (palkhi) bearing his sandals is at the head of the procession  
bearing his name.
