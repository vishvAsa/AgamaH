(“division of **inheritance**”) Pivotal legal  
text, written by the Bengali scholar  
**Jimutavahana** (early twelfth century).  
As its name would indicate, the  
*Dayabhaga* was concerned with matters  
of inheritance, partition, and the division of property, and it eventually  
became the primary legal code for the  
entire Bengal cultural region. The inheritance pattern in the *Dayabhaga* stresses  
succession, which is very different from  
the predominant Hindu pattern of survivorship. Survivorship vests all surviving males in the male line with equal  
shares of the family property, but gives  
no inheritance to **women**. Under this  
arrangement, the death of a male heir  
automatically increases the share of all  
the other surviving males, whereas their  
share decreases when another male is  
born. Under the succession model in the  
*Dayabhaga*, **sons** do not become shareholders of the family property at **birth**,  
but upon the death of their father. If a  
son happens to die before his father, the  
178  
Day, Structure of  
son’s heirs (including his wife and  
**daughters**) become inheritors, not in  
their own right, but as representatives of  
the deceased heir. Under the *Dayabhaga*,  
**widows** and daughters can thus have a  
share in family property, and they are  
allowed to act as agents in their own  
right. In theory this arrangement seems  
far more advantageous to women, but  
in fact it had some gruesome consequences. When the British first settled  
in Bengal in the late eighteenth century, they were horrified by the prevalence of **sati**, the rite in which a widow  
would be burned on her husband’s  
funeral pyre. It seems that sati was not  
nearly so common in many other parts  
of India, and one theory is that this rite  
was the family’s way to ensure that  
their daughter-in-law—who was an  
outsider to the family—would not be  
able to gain control over any of their  
ancestral property.
