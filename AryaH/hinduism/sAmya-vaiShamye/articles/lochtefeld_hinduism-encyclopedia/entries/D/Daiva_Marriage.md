title = "Daiva Marriage"

+++
One of the eight ways to perform a marriage recognized in the **dharma literature**, the treatises on religious duty  
(**dharma**). In a Daiva marriage the  
father of the bride gives away his  
**daughter** with her ornaments to a **brahmin** (priest). The priest then officiates  
at a **sacrifice** sponsored by the father.  
According to some interpretations, the  
girl is given as the **dakshina**, or fee for  
these sacrificial services. This form of  
marriage was named after the gods  
(**devas**), and was one of the four  
approved (**prashasta**) forms of marriage. Even though a daiva marriage was  
considered an approved form, it fell out  
of favor because of the hint that the  
bride had been given as a payment for  
services, rather than without any conditions whatsoever. See also **Marriage**,  
**eight classical forms**.
