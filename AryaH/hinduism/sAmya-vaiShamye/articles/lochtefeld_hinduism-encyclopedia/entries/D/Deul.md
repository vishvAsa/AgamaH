title = "Deul"

+++
(probably a form of **deva**, “**deity**”) In  
the temple **architecture** of the state of  
**Orissa**, this is the name for the beehive-shaped tower under which the  
image of the temple’s primary deity  
resides. Unlike the architecture in  
other parts of northern India, in which  
a series of towers (**shikharas**) gradually  
led up to the tallest tower, Orissan temples tend to have a fairly long and low  
entrance porch (**jagamohans**) and an  
extremely high deul, with this difference in visual forms accentuating the  
contrast between the two.
