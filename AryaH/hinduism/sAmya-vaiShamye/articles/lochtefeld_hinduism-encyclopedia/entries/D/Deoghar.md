title = "Deoghar"

+++
(“God’s home”) Sacred site (**tirtha**) in  
the southeastern corner of the modern  
state of **Bihar**, about 130 miles southeast of the city of Patna. Deoghar is  
famous throughout India as the site for a  
temple to the god **Shiva**, in his form as  
**Vaidyanath**, the “Lord of Physicians.”  
Vaidyanath is one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a group of sacred sites deemed  
especially holy to Shiva, and at which  
Shiva is believed to be uniquely present.  
Deoghar hosts an enormous religious  
gathering on the festival of **Shivaratri**  
(February—March) and during the  
**lunar month** of **Shravan** (July—August),  
both of which are times deemed particularly sacred to Shiva. On both occasions, pilgrims draw **water** from the  
**Ganges** at Sultanganj, more than sixty  
miles from Deoghar, and then walk  
to Deoghar to present the water as  
an **offering** to Shiva. This particular  
observance combines devotion to God  
with the willingness to suffer hardship; it  
is often performed to fulfill a vow made  
when asking for some divine favor. As in  
many Hindu holy places, pilgrim traffic  
peaks at Deoghar at certain festival  
times and at other times of the **year**  
drops off to almost nothing.
