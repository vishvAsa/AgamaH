(“ten names”) Collective name for the  
ten divisions among the **Sanyasis**, an  
**ascetic** order supposedly founded by  
the great philosopher **Shankaracharya**,  
whose members are devotees of the  
god **Shiva**. These ten divisions are each  
distinguished by a different name,  
which is taken as a surname by  
an ascetic after his **initiation** in the  
division. These ten names are **Giri**  
(“mountain”), **Parvata** (“mountain”),  
**Sagara** (“ocean”), **Saraswati** (the **goddess** of learning), **Bharati** (“India”), **Puri**  
(“city”), **Aranya** (“forest”), **Vana** (“forest”), **Tirtha** (“crossing-place”), and  
**Ashrama** (“hermitage”).  
Although all of the ten divisions are  
Dashanami Sanyasis, there are internal  
status differences based on the distinction between three ascetic classes:  
**Dandi**, **Paramahamsa**, and **Naga**. The  
**Dandi Sanyasis**, named for the staff  
(**danda**) that they must always carry,  
173  
Dashanami  
have the strongest connection with classical **Sanskrit** (sacred language) learning, are the strictest in their ascetic  
practices, and tend to be the most conservative in their social views. Dandi  
Sanyasis often follow ascetic initiation  
only after having completed the other  
three **stages of life** (ashramas), and thus  
fulfill the idealized pattern in the **dharma**  
**literature**, the texts on religious duty.  
Dandi Sanyasis were virtually always  
**brahmins** (priests) before becoming  
ascetics, and almost all Dandis belong to  
the Dashanami divisions that will only  
initiate brahmins—that is, the Saraswati,  
Ashrama, Tirtha, and some sections of  
the Bharati divisions. The remaining  
Dashanami divisions will admit members from all four of the traditional  
social classes: brahmins, **kshatriyas**,  
**vaishyas**, and **shudras**. Members from  
the first three groups, known as “**twiceborn**” because they are eligible for the  
adolescent religious initiation known as  
the “second birth,” are initiated as  
Paramahamsa Sanyasis, whereas shudras are initiated as **Naga**, or militant  
ascetics. Thus, despite the supposed loss  
of identity among ascetics after formally  
“renouncing” the world, one can see the  
continuing influence of a person’s former worldly status.  
These ten divisions are collected into  
four larger organizational groups:  
**Anandawara**, **Bhogawara**, **Bhuriwara**,  
and **Kitawara**. Each of these groups has  
two or three of the ten Dashanami  
orders, and each is centered in one of  
the four sacred centers (**maths**) supposedly established by Shankaracharya.  
Each of these four groups is also associated with one of the four **Vedas**—the  
oldest Hindu sacred texts, a different  
geographical quarter of India, a different  
“great utterance” (**mahavakya**), and a  
different ascetic quality.
