title = "Daita"

+++
Tribal (**adivasi**) community in the modern state of **Orissa**. The Daitas are  
hereditary temple servants at the temple of the god **Jagannath** in the city of  
**Puri**. Jagannath has been brought into  
the larger Hindu pantheon by identifying him as a form of the god **Krishna**,  
but he is originally believed to have  
been a local, tribal **deity**. This history is  
partly inferred from Jagannath’s relationships with the Daitas themselves,  
who are considered Jagannath’s relatives, even though their social status is  
very low. This relational connection  
gives the Daitas several unique roles.  
During the annual **Rath Yatra**, a ceremonial procession in which Jagannath,  
his brother **Balabhadra**, and their sister  
**Subhadra** are processed around the city  
in giant wooden chariots, the Daitas  
convey the deities’ giant wooden  
images from the temples to the chariots  
and pull the ropes that draw the carts.  
An even more important role comes  
when new images of the deities are constructed, usually every twelve or nineteen years. The Daitas carve the new  
images, each from a single massive log.  
When the new image has been completed,  
the oldest Daita removes a wooden plug  
164  
Dadupanth  
in the old image that seals an interior  
cavity. He then transfers a mysterious  
substance called the “life substance” to  
a corresponding cavity in the new  
image, which is sealed with another  
wooden plug. The Daita chosen to make  
this transfer is blindfolded and has his  
hands wrapped in layers of cloth, so he  
is unable to tell exactly what is transferred, and this “life substance” is considered so sacred that the person who  
makes this transfer reportedly dies soon  
afterward. After the “life substance” has  
been removed, the old image is considered a “**corpse**.” The Daitas bury it,  
observe a ten-day period of ritual death  
impurity (**maranashaucha**), and the  
heirs of the deceased claim his “belongings”—primarily clothes and resin,  
which they sell to pilgrims. Jagannath’s  
continuing relations with the Daitas  
point to his origins as a local, tribal god,  
and this relationship gives the Daitas  
continuing special privileges.
