title = "Dvapara Yuga"

+++
Particular age of the world in one of the  
reckonings of **cosmic time**. According to  
traditional belief, time has neither  
beginning nor end, but alternates  
between cycles of creation and activity,  
followed by cessation and quietude.  
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion  
years, with an active phase known as the  
**Day of Brahma**, and the quiet phase  
known as the Night of Brahma. In one  
reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of  
Brahma is divided into one thousand  
**mahayugas** (“great cosmic ages”), each  
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.  
Each mahayuga is composed of four  
constituent **yugas** (units of cosmic  
time), named the **Krta Yuga**, **Treta Yuga**,  
Dvapara Yuga, and **Kali Yuga**. Each of  
these four yugas is shorter than its predecessor, and ushers in an era more  
degenerate and depraved. By the end of  
the Kali Yuga, things have gotten so bad  
that the only solution is the destruction  
and recreation of the **earth**, at which  
time the next Krta era begins.  
The Dvapara Yuga is thus the third of  
the four yugas contained in a mahayuga,  
and lasts for 864,000 years. The metal  
associated with the Dvapara yuga is  
**bronze**—less valuable than the gold and  
silver associated with the earlier ages,  
but better than the iron of the Kali yuga.  
This is popularly believed to be the cosmic age in which the god **Krishna**  
appeared on earth.
