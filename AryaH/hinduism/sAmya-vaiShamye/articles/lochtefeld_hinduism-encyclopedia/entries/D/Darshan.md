(2) (“perspective”) In the context of  
Indian **philosophy**, this is the word most  
often used to designate a philosophical  
“school.” The word itself comes from the  
verb “to see,” and thus can be loosely  
translated as a “point of view,” “perspective,” or “[way of] seeing.” In a diverse  
and competitive philosophical culture,  
this is a neutral way to describe a philosophical position, whether or not one  
agrees with it.
