title = "Dandavat (“stick-like”) Pranam"

+++
Type of reverential salutation in which  
the person lies prostrate on the ground  
with the arms extended (hence the comparison between the body and a stick).  
This shows the highest reverence of all  
greetings, since one’s entire body is in  
contact with the ground.
