title = "Dwaraka"

+++
Sacred city (**tirtha**) on the western coast  
of **Gujarat**, on the shore of the Arabian  
Sea. In mythic terms, Dwaraka is most  
famous as the capital city for the god  
**Krishna’s** kingdom, at which he is  
believed to have lived in the years following the **Mahabharata** war. Dwaraka’s  
most important site is the Dwarakanath  
Temple, dedicated to Krishna in his  
form as the “Lord of Dwaraka.” Dwaraka  
is also one of the **four dhams** (“divine  
abodes”), sacred centers that approximately define the geographic boundaries of India; the three others are  
**Badrinath**, **Puri**, and **Rameshvaram**.  
Dwaraka is also the site of the **Sharada**  
**math**, one of the four **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasi maths** (monastic centers) supposedly established by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. The Sharada math is  
the headquarters of the **Kitawara** group  
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, one of the  
four major organizational groups, with  
each one centered at one of the maths.  
As with many other Hindu sacred sites,  
Dwaraka is sanctified by a network of  
mythic and religious associations.
