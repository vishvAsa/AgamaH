(“Hymn to the Ten **Avatars**”) The opening canto of the **Gitagovinda**, a twelfthcentury lyric poem written by the poet  
**Jayadeva**. The *Gitagovinda* is an allegory  
of the union of the human soul with the  
divine, described through the story of  
the god **Krishna** and his human lover  
**Radha**. At the narrative level, this tale  
describes the couple’s initial passionate  
lovemaking, followed by jealousy, anger,  
and estrangement. It concludes with  
their reconciliation and an even more  
passionate reunion.  
Although it is preceded by a short  
introduction, the Dashavatara Stotra  
is the text’s true beginning. The  
Dashavatara Stotra is a hymn paying  
homage to the ten avatars or earthly  
incarnations of the god Krishna, each  
of whom has been responsible for preserving the cosmos in a time of crisis.  
Jayadeva uses this opening hymn to  
remind his readers that the Krishna of  
his story is no mere mortal lover—  
even though the story employs the  
language and images commonly  
found in **Sanskrit** love poetry—but  
rather the lord and master of the universe, who has saved it from destruction again and again. The context  
supplied by the images in this opening  
hymn alert the reader that this text is  
not merely a love story.  
Jayadeva is unusual in describing the  
god Krishna as the source of the ten  
avatars, since Krishna is more commonly  
considered an avatar of the god **Vishnu**.  
This theological difference stems from  
Jayadeva’s connection with the  
**Jagannath** temple in the city of **Puri**.  
Jagannath is said to be a form of  
Krishna, but it is generally accepted that

Dashavatara Stotra  
The Dashavatara Stotra is the opening song  
in the *Gitagovinda*, a twelfth-century  
lyrical poem that tells the story of the god  
Krishna and his human lover Radha.  
Jagannath was originally an autochthonous (“of the land”) **deity** who happened to be Puri’s local deity. Identifying  
him with Krishna was a way to assimilate Jagannath into the Hindu pantheon.  
For Jayadeva, Jagannath-Krishna is thus  
the supreme deity, not an avatar, and the  
place usually occupied by Krishna in  
Jayadeva’s enumeration of the avatars is  
taken by Krishna’s brother, **Balarama**.
