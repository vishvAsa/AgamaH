title = "Dropsy"

+++
Bodily condition in which the body  
retains excess **water**, and in consequence swells up. In several hymns  
in the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu  
religious texts, dropsy is described as  
the punishment levied by the god  
**Varuna** for speaking falsehood. Varuna  
was conceived as the guardian of  
cosmic order (**rta**), and intentionally  
false speech was considered the  
paradigm of **anrta**, the destructive force  
that ran counter to the ordering force  
of rta. In this case the punishment was  
seen as fitting the crime, as if one had  
been metaphorically inflated by the lies  
one had told.
