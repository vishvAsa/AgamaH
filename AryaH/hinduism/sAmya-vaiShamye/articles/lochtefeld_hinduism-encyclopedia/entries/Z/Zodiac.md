The signs of the zodiac in Indian astrology (**jyotisha**) are virtually identical with  
that of Western astrology, and it is generally accepted that the Greek zodiac was  
brought to India in the first to third centuries via the Greek kingdoms in modern Afghanistan. There are slight  
differences in the nomenclature; the  
Indian zodiac has **Dhanus** (“bow”) in  
place of Sagittarius, Makara (a sea monster sometimes identified as a crocodile)  
for Capricorn, and Kumbha (“[water]  
pot”) for Aquarius. As with Western  
astrology, each of the twelve signs has  
certain characteristics, with which people born in these signs are imbued.  
The two systems differ sharply in  
how they figure the annual starting  
point, although both begin with the sign  
of Aries. The zodiac used in Western  
astrology begins on the vernal equinox,  
on which the sign of Aries is the beginning. By Indian accounts the starting  
point of the zodiac comes when the **sun**  
intersects the midpoint of a group of  
stars named Ashvini. It is thus based on  
the position of the sun with regard to  
the fixed stars, whereas the Western  
zodiac is based on the position of the  
sun with regard to the **earth**—that is,  
when it intersects the equator, and is  
thus independent of the fixed stars.  
These differing methods have produced  
a discrepancy between the two systems,  
which are now more than three weeks  
apart—in the Western zodiac Aries  
begins on March 21, whereas in the  
Indian zodiac it does not begin until  
about April 14. This discrepancy can  
also be seen in the account of **Makara**  
**Sankranti** and **Karka Sankranti**, which  
are judged to be the winter and the summer solstices but occur in the second  
weeks of January and July. Given a difference of about three weeks, it is not surprising that there are significant  
differences in the astrological calculations between these two systems.
