title = "Intoxicants"

+++
In general, Hindu culture condemns  
anything that could lead to loss of  
control, including intoxicants such as  
alcohol and mind-altering **drugs**. The  
level of disapproval associated with  
these substances depends on the  
substance itself and the circumstances  
under which it is consumed. For  
example, consumption of distilled  
spirits (“foreign **liquor**”) is seen as a  
sign of adopting outside values, while  
consuming undistilled, fermented  
beverages such as “country liquor” and  
**toddy** is considered a low-class activity. However, there are a handful of  
Hindu temples at which liquor is the  
everyday **offering** to the **deity** and  
worshipers consume it as **prasad**, the  
sanctified food or drink that carries the  
deity’s blessing.  
The attitude toward intoxicating  
drugs is also complex. Although they are  
also subject to general disapproval,  
Hindu mythology portrays **Shiva** as  
regularly consuming both **bhang**, made  
from crushed marijuana, and the  
intoxicating **datura** plant. Some of  
Shiva’s devotees (**bhakta**) do the same in  
emulation of their chosen deity, and  
many **ascetics** regularly smoke hashish  
(**charas**) mixed with tobacco, a habit  
interpreted by some as an intentional  
separation from the normal social  
system. Consuming bhang is a fairly  
common feature of certain religious  
festivals, such as **Shivaratri** and  
**Holi**, although there are many people  
who abstain.
