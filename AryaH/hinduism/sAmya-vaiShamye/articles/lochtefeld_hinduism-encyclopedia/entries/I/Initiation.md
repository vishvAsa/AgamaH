In general, an initiation is a ritual  
in which a person is given certain  
new rights, capacities, and responsibilities. In a Hindu religious context,  
there are two important rites of  
religious initiation.  
One of these is the **upanayana samskara**, an adolescent religious initiation  
performed on a “**twice-born**” male—  
that is, a member of the **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya** group—which is also  
known as the “second birth.”  
The other rite of initiation, **diksha**,  
is conferred on a person at the pleasure  
of a **guru** or religious preceptor and  
has no limitations on who or when it  
can be received.
