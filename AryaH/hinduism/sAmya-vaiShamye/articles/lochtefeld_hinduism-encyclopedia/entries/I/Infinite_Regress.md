title = "Infinite Regress"

+++
In Indian logic, one of the **fallacies** to be  
avoided in constructing an argument.  
An infinite regress is not only an infinite  
series, but one in which there is no final  
cause to make it happen or not happen.  
A standard Western example of an  
infinite regress is the man who informs  
the philosopher that the world is supported on the back of a giant tortoise.  
Upon being asked what supported the

tortoise, the man replies, “another  
tortoise.” Several similar queries bring  
the same reply, until in frustration  
the man bursts out “It’s no use trying to  
trick me—after this, it is tortoises all  
the way down!”  
In an Indian context, the infinite  
regress fallacy is seen as an extended  
case of the fallacy of **self-residence**, and  
equally objectionable.
