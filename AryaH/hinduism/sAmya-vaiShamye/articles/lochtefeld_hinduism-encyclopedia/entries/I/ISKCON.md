title = "ISKCON"

+++
Acronym for the International Society  
for **Krishna** Consciousness, a Hindu  
missionary community commonly  
known as the Hare Krishnas. This  
name comes from ISKCON’s emphasis  
on the importance of repeating the  
divine name, particularly the formula  
known as the **mahamantra** (“Hare  
Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna,  
Hare Hare”). ISKCON was founded by A. C.  
Bhaktivedanta **Prabhupada**, and its religious roots lie in the **Vaishnava** piety of  
his native Bengal. The Bengali Vaishnava  
tradition has long emphasized the  
importance of publicly chanting  
Krishna’s name, particularly in the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** community founded  
by the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**.

ISKCON comes out of this Bengali tradition, but in other ways it shows tensions that mark it as a twentieth-century  
phenomenon. Its strong missionary  
activities make it a highly unusual Hindu  
religious organization, as does its membership—Prabhupada founded ISKCON in  
New York City, most of ISKCON’s members  
are Western converts from Judaism and  
Christianity, and the bulk of its missionary activities have been performed outside of India. The roots of ISKCON’s  
membership, and the general fervor  
associated with converts, have led to  
some theological contradictions. On  
one hand, ISKCON doctrine tends to denigrate human capacity, putting the  
emphasis on the saving power of God’s  
**grace**. On the other hand, ISKCON devotees (**bhakta**) believe that they gain  
religious merit by living a rigorously  
regulated lifestyle that mandates a  
strict vegetarian diet, abstinence from  
**liquor** and nonmedicinal **drugs**, sexual  
activity only for procreation, and a  
well-established daily religious routine;  
many devotees also adopt Indian clothing and **hair** styles. In these two opposing emphases—complete surrender to  
God’s grace, and strict adherence to a  
prescribed “holy” lifestyle—ISKCON shows  
surprising parallels to evangelical  
Christianity. Since Prabhupada’s death in  
1977, the organization has been run by  
these Western converts, and thus ISKCON  
can be characterized as a “countercultural” Euro-American phenomenon,  
despite its Indian origins. ISKCON has a  
significant presence in **Brindavan**, the  
village celebrated as Krishna’s childhood  
home, where the group has built a  
magnificent temple; they are also active  
in **Mayapur** in Bengal, which they  
claim as Chaitanya’s birthplace. After a  
period of growth in the 1970s, ISKCON had  
serious legal problems in the 1980s,  
including losses in civil suits and  
allegations of money laundering and  
murder. For a sympathetic perspective  
on the movement, see Larry Shinn,  
*The Dark Lord,* 1987; and Robert D. Baird  
(ed.), *Religion in Modern India*, 1998.
