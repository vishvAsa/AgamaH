title = "Indus Valley Civilization"

+++
(3000–2000 B.C.E.) An ancient and highly  
developed urban culture, so named  
because the first two sites discovered,  
**Mohenjo-Daro** and **Harappa**, both lie  
on the **Indus** River in what is now  
Pakistan. Further searching has  
uncovered other sites along much of the  
Indus, as well as a web of settlements  
stretching east to the upper **Ganges**  
basin, south through the modern state  
of **Gujarat** and into modern  
**Maharashtra**, and along the coast of  
modern Pakistan. The greatest concentration of these settlements has been  
found along the banks of the Ghaggar  
River, a small and seasonal watercourse  
that runs through the state of  
**Rajasthan**. Some historians claim that it  
is the bed of the ancient **Saraswati**  
**River**. Evidence from the sites seems to  
indicate that the sites further to the  
south developed later, but remained  
vital after the cities in the Indus River  
Valley, particularly Harappa and  
Mohenjo-Daro, had fallen into oblivion.  
The discovery of these sites in the early  
twentieth century prompted significant  
historical revision, since before then it  
had been generally assumed that the  
people known as the **Aryans** were the  
earliest developed culture in India.  
The most striking feature of these  
cities is their uniformity—their general  
city plan was nearly identical from place  
to place (although they differed in  
scale), the bricks used throughout all the  
cities were exactly the same size, and  
there was a standardized set of weights  
and measures. Each of the cities also  
had a large central granary, which stored  
the grain necessary to feed such a sizable urban population. Such evident  
uniformity over such long distances  
bears clear witness to a strong and  
centralized government, which some  
analysts have speculated was religious  
in nature.  
Another striking feature of all the  
cities was an advanced sanitation system. All the houses had channels for  
**water**, and an elaborate network of  
drains and sewers ran throughout the  
city, even in those sections where the  
houses were the smallest, and people  
presumably the poorest. Mohenjo-Daro  
also has a great tank built of brick and  
sealed with pitch, which the archaeologists have dubbed the “Great **Bath**.” Why  
were the people who built these cities so  
concerned with sanitation and bathing?

Some experts believe this reflected religious concern for ritual **purity**, rather  
than hygiene.  
Many of the artifacts from these  
cities are remarkably well preserved,  
and give us a fairly comprehensive picture of their material culture: what they  
ate (wheat and barley were the primary  
food grains), what they wore (cotton),  
which **animals** they had domesticated  
(cattle, fowl, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys,  
and dogs), and the implements of everyday life.  
Archeological excavations have also  
found more than 2,000 small seals,  
which are assumed to have served as the  
insignia for mercantile families. Many of  
the seals bear writing, although it has  
never been deciphered, as well as realistic pictures of animals and human  
beings. Three of the seals display a  
horned figure sitting with his upper legs  
splayed and his heels touching one  
another. Some viewers have cited the  
figure on these seals as proof that the  
Indus Valley culture is the ultimate  
source for the god **Shiva**, a figure who  
does not appear in the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu religious texts, but who later  
becomes one of the primary Hindu  
**deities**. In the same way, recovery of several statues of **women** with grossly exaggerated female characteristics—breasts,  
buttocks, and genitalia—have prompted  
others to claim that this culture was the  
source for the later Hindu cult of the  
Mother **Goddess**.  
One of the controversies connected  
with the Indus Valley culture is what  
people were living there and whether  
their descendants still live in India. The  
generally accepted theory among Western  
scholars describes a period of contact  
between the people in these cities and a

Indus Valley Civilization  
Ruins in Mohenjo-Daro. These structures are some of the earliest discovered evidence of the  
Indus Valley civilization, a society believed to have emerged around 3000 B.C.E.  
pastoral group of outsiders called the  
Aryans. The language of the Aryans,  
**Sanskrit**, shows certain structural relationships with classical European languages and even closer connections to  
the Avesta, religious texts of ancient  
Iran. Based on an analysis of the relationships between these languages and  
the rate at which these languages have  
changed, scholars have inferred that all  
these languages came from a common  
mother language, and that people  
speaking this parent language originated  
in central Asia, somewhere near the  
Caspian Sea. From there, some went  
west to Europe, some went southwest to  
Turkey, and some went south toward  
Iran, and later to India. This entire theory  
is thus based almost solely on the  
observed similarities between languages and assumptions about the rate  
of linguistic change—some of which are  
necessarily arbitrary.  
The one piece of material evidence  
for this theory comes in the remains of  
horses found at the Indus Valley sites.  
The horse was an established part of  
Aryan life, according to references based  
on the Aryan religious texts, the Vedas,  
whereas it seems to have been absent  
from the Indus Valley cities—it is not  
portrayed on any of the carved seals,  
which show many other animals, and  
the only bones that have been recovered  
from the Indus Valley cities are found in  
the most recent archeological strata.  
This theory describes a period of contact and possible conflict between the  
Aryans and Indus Valley peoples, after  
which the Aryan culture and religion  
became the dominant force in Indian  
life. The Indus Valley cities were completely forgotten until they were excavated in the early twentieth century.  
The Aryan migration theory accounts  
for the dissemination of various languages, but is not universally accepted.  
Many modern Indians subscribe to the  
**Indigenous Aryan** (IA) **theory**, which  
contends that the Aryans are the original  
inhabitants of India, and as proof points  
to the artifacts found in the Indus Valley  
civilization. Some IA supporters are  
reacting against the Aryan migration  
theory’s perceived colonialist bias,  
since the theory was developed by  
Europeans and assumes that the dominant groups in modern India must have  
come from outside. Other supporters  
are the proponents of **Hindutva**, who  
identify being Hindu with being an  
Indian. The IA theory allows Hindutva  
proponents to claim that all Indians are  
“really” Hindus and thus one social  
group, whatever their particular religious beliefs. This assertion has profound political implications in modern  
India, where Christians and Muslims  
are not only religious communities,  
but social and political ones. By connecting Hindu identity and good  
Indian citizenship, Hindutva proponents are marginalizing Christians and  
Muslims as outsiders.  
Such claims are intriguing, but there  
is slim evidence for them. The real truth  
is that researchers have recovered lots  
of material objects, but what these  
things mean is open to interpretation.  
At the very least, we know that this  
culture flourished for about a thousand  
years. Its final collapse—because of  
a prolonged drought, according to  
one theory—took place around 2000  
B.C.E. For further information see
