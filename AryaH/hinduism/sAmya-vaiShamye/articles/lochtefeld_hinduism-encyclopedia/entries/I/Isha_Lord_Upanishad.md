title = "Isha (“Lord”) Upanishad"

+++
At eighteen verses, one of the shortest  
of the early speculative texts known  
as the **Upanishads**; the name of this  
upanishad comes from the first word of  
the text. It is believed to be one of the  
late upanishads due to its brevity, its  
composition in verse rather than prose,  
and the use of verses that appear in  
other upanishads. As with many of the  
later upanishads, the Isha Upanishad  
propounds a loosely defined monism, in  
which the source of all things is ascribed  
to a single power. This power can be  
discovered through a flash of mystic  
insight when the seeker is able to

transcend the illusion that objects  
are unconnected and recognize the one  
real power in the universe. The insight  
is believed to give a definitive understanding into the workings of the  
universe and to bring the individual final  
release of the soul (**moksha**) from the  
cycle of reincarnation (**samsara**).
