title = "Indrajit"

+++
(“Conqueror of **Indra**”) In the **Ramayana**,  
the earlier of the two great Indian epics,  
Indrajit is the **son** of the **demon**-king  
**Ravana** by his wife **Mandodari**. In some  
later versions of the *Ramayana*, he is  
portrayed as the son of the god **Shiva**  
himself, born after his mother had married Ravana. Like his father, Indrajit is a  
great devotee (**bhakta**) of Shiva, and  
because of his devotion Shiva teaches  
Indrajit how to make himself invisible.  
For a warrior, this power is obviously  
very valuable, and through it Indrajit is  
able to conquer Indra’s heavenly realm  
and take Indra as a prisoner back to  
**Lanka**, hence his name.  
The god **Brahma** goes to Lanka, the  
kingdom of Ravana, to arrange for Indra’s  
release, in return for which Indrajit  
demands physical immortality. When he  
is told that this is impossible, Indrajit  
requests a different power—that when he  
performs a certain **sacrifice** he will  
receive horses and a chariot so that he can  
kill whatever enemy he faces, and while in  
the chariot he cannot be killed.  
When the god-king **Rama** and allies  
are storming Lanka, in an effort to  
regain Rama’s kidnapped wife **Sita**,  
Indrajit begins to perform this sacrifice.  
Warned about this danger by Brahma,  
Rama sends his brother **Lakshmana** to  
interrupt it. Lakshmana successfully  
disrupts the sacrifice, and in the ensuing  
battle kills Indrajit.
