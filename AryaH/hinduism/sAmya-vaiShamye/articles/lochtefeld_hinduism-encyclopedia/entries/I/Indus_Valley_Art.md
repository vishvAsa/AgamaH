title = "Indus Valley Art"

+++
Despite the plethora of artifacts that  
have been recovered from the cities of  
the **Indus Valley civilization**, objects  
that could be interpreted as works of  
art are surprisingly sparse. No traces of  
decoration have been found inside or  
outside the buildings, nor has any monumental **architecture** been discovered.  
The art objects that have been found  
in **Harappa**, a city on the Ravi River in  
Pakistan, have all been on a smaller  
scale: several stone statues of male torsos, the head and torso of a bearded  
man, a copper statue of a young woman  
naked except for bangles and jewelry  
(said to be a “dancer,” because her arms  
and legs are lifted), statues of **women**  
with elaborate headdresses believed to  
be icons for a Mother **Goddess** cult, and  
the images of plants, **animals**, and  
humans carved on the **Indus Valley**  
**Seals**. The latter show delicate and quite  
realistic work, indicating a great deal of  
skill in working the stone, as well as the  
ability to make realistic figural images.
