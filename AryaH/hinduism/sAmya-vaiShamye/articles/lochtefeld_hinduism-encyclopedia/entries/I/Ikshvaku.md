title = "Ikshvaku"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, Ikshvaku was a  
king who was the founder of the **Solar**  
**Line**. The Solar Line is one of the two  
great Indian mythic lineages in ancient  
India, along with the **Lunar Line**; the  
most illustrious members of the Solar  
Line were the god-king **Rama** and his  
brothers. Ikshvaku is the grandson of  
Vivasvan (**Surya**), the **sun**, and thus he  
and his offspring are descendants of  
the sun.
