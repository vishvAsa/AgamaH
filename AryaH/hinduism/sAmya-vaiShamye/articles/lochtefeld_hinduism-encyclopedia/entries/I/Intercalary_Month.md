title = "Intercalary Month"

+++
The Hindu ritual **year** is largely based on  
a lunar **calendar**, whose twelve **lunar**  
**months** are finished in about 354 solar  
days (as opposed to our 365-**day** calendar). This disparity with the solar calendar means that each lunar year begins  
eleven days earlier than the previous

lunar year. The discrepancy meant  
that the two calendars would increasingly diverge, such that (for example)  
“spring” festivals could occur at any  
time of the year.  
It has been resolved by the addition  
of an intercalary month about every  
21⁄2 years—more precisely, every thirtytwo months, sixteen days, one hour  
and twenty-six minutes. This intercalary  
month can take place during any of  
the year’s twelve lunar months and  
takes the name of the regular lunar  
month preceding it.  
As an unusual phenomenon, the  
extra month is generally seen as a ritually  
dangerous time, and one of its common  
epithets is the “impure month” (**malamasa**). During this month it is believed  
that one should not initiate any new  
projects, or perform any religious ceremonies whose timing is fluid and can be  
postponed, particularly marriages.  
**Worship** is highly encouraged during  
this time and keeping religious fasts and  
giving charity (**dana**) are also thought to  
be highly efficacious.  
All of these are means of countering  
the **inauspiciousness** of this calendrical  
time—fasts and worship are ways to  
gain divine favor and protection, while  
charity acts as a channel to remove any  
potential bad fortune, by transferring it  
to the recipient.  
When this extra month comes in the  
lunar month of **Ashadh**, it is called  
**Purushottama Mas**, and especially  
marked by the devotees (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Vishnu** as a time for worship and  
other spiritual exercises.
