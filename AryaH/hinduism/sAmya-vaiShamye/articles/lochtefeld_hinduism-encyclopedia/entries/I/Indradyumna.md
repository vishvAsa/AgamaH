title = "Indradyumna"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a righteous king  
who is a great devotee (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Vishnu**. He has been cursed to  
become a giant **elephant** by the sage  
296  
Indradyumna  
**Agastya**, who becomes angry when the  
king, deep in meditation, fails to greet  
the sage with proper respect. After much  
pleading, Agastya decrees that the **curse**  
will be broken when Vishnu touches the  
elephant on the back. As a result of this  
curse, Indradyumna roams the **earth** as  
an elephant for many years.  
On one occasion when he is drinking at a lake, his hind leg is seized by a  
giant crocodile. The crocodile is actually a **gandharva** or celestial musician  
named **Huhu**, whom another sage had  
cursed to become a crocodile. Their  
struggle lasts for a thousand years, with  
the elephant unable to get free, and the  
crocodile unable to overpower the elephant. Finally Vishnu himself appears,  
kills the crocodile, and restores  
Indradyumna to his previous form. The  
release of Indradyumna from both the  
curse and the crocodile is known as  
**Gajendramoksha**, the “release of the  
elephant king.”
