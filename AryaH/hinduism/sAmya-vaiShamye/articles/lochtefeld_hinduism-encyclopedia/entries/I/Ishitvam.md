+++
(“superiority”) One of the eight superhuman powers (**siddhi**) traditionally  
believed to be earned when a person  
reaches a high degree of spiritual attainment. This particular power stems from  
the control over matter (**prakrti**), which  
along with **purusha** are the two principles of the **Samkhya** philosophical system. This control over primal matter  
allows one to create, destroy, and  
rearrange material objects.
