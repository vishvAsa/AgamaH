title = "Inauspiciousness"

+++
This concept refers to events or conditions that in their very essence hinder or  
are inimical to life, prosperity, and general well-being. Along with **purity** and  
impurity (**ashaucha**), **auspiciousness**  
and inauspiciousness are fundamental  
categories in Hindu life.  
Inauspicious conditions can be  
caused by a variety of factors. At times  
the inauspiciousness lies in the very  
moment itself—in an hour or **day** considered to be unlucky, in unusual  
events such as **eclipses**, or in astrological conjunctions that are considered  
inherently unlucky. In such “dangerous” times, one’s activities should be  
severely curtailed, except for things that  
are absolutely necessary. Certain normally innocuous activities can become  
inauspicious in conjunction with particular times, and at these times such activities should be avoided.  
Inauspiciousness can also arise from  
certain conjunctions in one’s **natal**  
**horoscope**, or from erecting a home or  
building in an inappropriate place. As a  
quality, inauspiciousness is conceived of  
as a physical entity that is generated  
by certain conditions, and which then  
attaches to individuals, families, or  
larger communities.  
Some of these inauspicious conditions can be avoided by refraining  
from certain activities at certain times,  
yet there are certain conditions that  
cannot be avoided—in particular, the  
inauspiciousness arising from eclipses  
or other astrological conjunctions.  
Whereas impurity (**ashaucha**) can  
be removed or destroyed through  
purification, inauspiciousness can only  
be transferred from one person to  
another, most often through the medium of gifts (**dana**). For more information see Gloria Goodwin Raheja, *The*  
*Poison in the Gift,* 1988; and David F.  
Pocock, “The Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan  
(ed.), *Religion in India*, 1991.
