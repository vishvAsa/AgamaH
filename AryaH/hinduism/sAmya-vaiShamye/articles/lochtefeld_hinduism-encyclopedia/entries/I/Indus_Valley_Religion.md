title = "Indus Valley Religion"

Although some experts have made  
definitive claims about the religion of  
the **Indus Valley civilization**, it must be  
remembered that all these claims are  
highly speculative, since they are solely  
based on the remains from the cities.  
Artifacts such as grains, animal bones,  
traces of fabric, and building foundations give us a good basis for knowing  
about the material life of this culture—  
what people ate, what they wore, and  
the types of dwellings they lived in.  
The notion of religion, however, is far  
more abstract. It is thus not only harder  
to infer what types of religion were practiced from the artifacts that have been  
300  
Indus Valley Religion  
recovered, but these same artifacts can  
also be used as evidence for widely differing conclusions. The objects themselves are mute and can be interpreted  
in many ways. Still, among these objects  
are several artifacts that are intriguing.  
Among the artifacts found at sites in  
the Indus Valley civilization have been  
ceramic female figures with grossly  
exaggerated female characteristics—  
breasts, buttocks, and genitalia. These  
figures strongly resemble the Bronze  
Age European image known as the  
“Venus of Willendorf,” which has been  
associated with the **worship** of female  
fertility and procreative power. Given  
these similarities, it seems likely that a  
similar cult existed in the Indus Valley  
civilization. The statues give no indication of how widespread this cult was—  
whether it was related to fertility cults in  
other places or was simply a parallel  
development. There is no proof that this  
cult was the basis for the later Hindu  
worship of the **Goddess** as the supreme  
reality. Any such claims are making  
broader inferences from this limited  
material evidence—at best, such claims  
are highly speculative; at worst, they  
are irresponsible and driven by an  
underlying agenda.  
The other intriguing artifacts from  
the Indus Valley civilization have come  
from seals, of which several hundred  
have been found. Many of the seals have  
pictures of **animals** or objects from  
everyday life, but three of the seals from  
**Harappa** bear the image of a horned figure sitting cross-legged on a small platform. Some viewers have described this  
figure as a “Proto-Shiva,” since it has  
several features associated with the  
Hindu god **Shiva**—the sitting posture is  
associated with the practice of **yoga**, and  
the figure’s horns indicate his form as  
Pashupati, the “Lord of Beasts.”  
Proponents of this theory point to  
the Indus Valley culture for the roots of  
Shiva, rightly noting that although Shiva  
becomes prominent in later Hinduism,  
he is virtually absent from the Vedic  
pantheon. Virtually the only place that  
Shiva appears is in the **Shvetashvatara**  
**Upanishad**, one of the latest of the mystical texts known as the **Upanishads**,  
which describes the god **Rudra**—later  
identified with Shiva—as the supreme  
power in the universe.  
Although it is possible that the worship of Shiva lies in the Indus Valley culture, anyone not inclined to believe this  
at the outset will be hard-pressed to find  
this particular evidence persuasive.  
There is also mysterious writing on the  
seals, and if and when this writing is  
deciphered these relationships may  
become clearer. See also **Veda**.
