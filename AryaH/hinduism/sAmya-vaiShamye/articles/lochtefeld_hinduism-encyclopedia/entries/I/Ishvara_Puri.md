title = "Ishvara Puri"

+++
(c. 1500) Ecstatic devotee (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Krishna**, who is famous as the **guru**  
of the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**. Little is  
known about Ishvara Puri’s background,  
although his surname “Puri” indicates  
that he took formal **ascetic initiation** in  
the Puri branch of the **Dashanami**  
Sanyasis. After meeting Ishvara Puri in  
1508 in the pilgrimage town of **Gaya**,  
Chaitanya was fired with devotion to  
Krishna, and he began to perform the  
public ecstatic recitations of Krishna’s  
name that have become an established  
element in the religious life of the community that claims him as its founder,  
the **Gaudiya Vaishnavas**. See also **ISKCON**.
