title = "Indra"

+++
One of the oldest and most powerful  
Hindu **deities**. His status has changed  
over the years and this evolution shows  
how Hinduism has transformed.  
In the earliest Hindu scriptures, the  
hymns in **Rg Veda**, Indra is the Vedic deity  
*par excellence*. As with most Vedic deities,  
Indra is associated with certain natural  
phenomena, in this case the power of the  
storm; he was seen as inhabiting the  
region (**antariksha**) between the **earth**  
and sky, the region where storms take  
place. In many ways Indra seems a paradigm for the virtues and powers celebrated in the Vedas, and (as many have  
inferred) celebrated as virtues by the  
Aryans themselves. Indra is the invincible  
warrior and the performer of great deeds.  
One of the central hymns in the Rg  
Veda (1.32) describes Indra’s battle with  
the serpent **Vrtra**, who is finally killed  
and cut into pieces, allowing the pent-up  
waters that Vrtra has blocked to flow  
freely over the land.  
Indra is a drinker of the intoxicating  
beverage **soma**, whose influence leads  
him to expanded reveries on his own  
greatness; he is the ultimate man’s man  
in a culture that is usually believed to  
have stressed manly virtues. Of the 1,028  
hymns in the Rg Veda, nearly a quarter  
are devoted to Indra, who is described as  
the power encircling the earth.

Indra  
Depiction of the god Indra, king of heaven and  
one of the eight guardians of the earth.  
Some of Indra’s attributes and functions remain constant as the Hindu tradition changed and developed. In later  
Hindu mythology, Indra’s realm is still  
the atmospheric region between the  
earth and sky, and he is still considered  
the god of the storm, the bestower of  
rain, and the wielder of the divine thunderbolt. Indra is also one of the eight  
**Guardians of the Directions**, holding  
sway over the eastern quarter.  
Yet some things about Indra changed  
around the first millennium; most  
importantly, Indra has been “demoted”  
to being merely the ruler of the heavenly realms and the king of the gods. Far  
from being the supreme, unchallenged  
power in the universe, his position is  
much more precarious, for he is seen as  
affected by the workings of **karma**.  
Indra is actually subject to replacement  
when he is spiritually exhausted or  
when a challenger on earth grows spiritually strong enough to unseat him.  
Many of the stories in the classical  
**Sanskrit** texts have their plot advanced  
by Indra’s throne becoming hot (a sign  
that a human being is gaining the  
power to replace Indra), and with Indra  
taking some action to counter this  
threat. In cases where the challenger is  
a celibate **ascetic**, whose source of  
power is the power of renunciation,  
Indra usually dispatches an **apsara**  
(divine nymph) whose heavenly  
charms can seduce the ascetic and by  
destroying his **celibacy** destroy his  
power as well. In other cases the threat  
can come from people completing one  
hundred great sacrifices; here Indra  
somehow forestalls the hundredth **sacrifice**, as he does by stealing the sacred  
horse of King **Sagar**. Indra is the lord  
and ruler of the gods, but his position  
can only be retained by keeping a sharp  
eye on all possible threats.  
This loss of “divine” position is seen  
by the way Indra is portrayed in certain  
mythic tales. In the story of **Ahalya** he is  
portrayed as a lecher and an adulterer,  
seducing Ahalya by assuming the form  
of her husband, the sage **Gautama**.  
When Gautama discovers what has  
happened, he curses Indra to have a  
thousand vulvas on his body, although  
the **curse** is later modified to give Indra  
a thousand eyes. Indra’s helplessness  
before his own lust and his inability  
to withstand Gautama’s curse are  
sure signs that his divine position  
has slipped.  
Although he is still regarded as the  
bestower of rain and the wielder of the  
thunderbolt, another indication of his  
diminished power can be seen in his  
encounter with the adolescent god  
**Krishna**. When Krishna persuades the  
village elders to cease making **offerings**  
to Indra, the latter sends torrential rains  
that threaten to destroy the village. In  
the face of this threat, Krishna calmly  
lifts Mount **Govardhan**, and for seven  
days and nights holds it over their heads  
to block the rain. Although Indra  
expends all his strength, he is unable to  
prevail against the adolescent Krishna,  
clearly demonstrating where the real  
divinity lies.  
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Indra is revealed  
to be the divine father of **Arjuna**, one of  
the five **Pandava** brothers who are the  
epic’s protagonists. Arjuna shares his  
father’s strengths and weaknesses; he is  
heroic and gallant, the archetypal warrior who relishes the clash of battle and  
is unceasing in defense of his personal  
and family honor. He can also be selfish,  
egocentric, and boorish, and has many  
extramarital liaisons, some of which  
produce offspring. Both are wonderful  
warriors, if that is what is needed at  
the time, but they lack other qualities  
to make them productive in times  
of peace. This story of Indra and Arjuna  
is further evidence that Indra has  
fallen from the most important deity  
to a minor one who is not an object  
of **worship**.
