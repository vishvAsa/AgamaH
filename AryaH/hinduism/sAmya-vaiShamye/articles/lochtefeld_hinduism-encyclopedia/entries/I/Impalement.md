title = "Impalement"

+++
One of the favored means of execution  
that seems to have been particularly  
prevalent in ancient southern India. To  
impale someone is to kill them by piercing them with a sharp stake.  
The most stunning instance is  
reported to have taken place in the city  
of **Madurai**, where 8,000 Jain **ascetics**  
were impaled by one of the kings in the  
**Pandya dynasty**, after the latter had  
renounced Jainism to become a **Shaiva**,  
that is, a devotee (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**. A  
tradition persists that the ultimate  
responsibility for this can be traced to  
the **Nayanar** saint **Sambandar**, who had  
converted the king and whose surviving  
poetry shows a deep animus for the  
Jains. If this report is true, it also indicates one of the rare cases of **religious**  
**persecution** in Hindu India, which on  
the whole has been remarkably tolerant  
of differing ways of religious life.

Impalement  
Depictions of this mass impalement can  
be seen in **murals** painted at the  
**Minakshi** temple in Madurai—whose  
construction far postdates the alleged  
event—as well as in popular art of different kinds.
