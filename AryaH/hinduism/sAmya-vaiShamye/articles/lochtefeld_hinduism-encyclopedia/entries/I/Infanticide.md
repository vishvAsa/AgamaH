title = "Infanticide"

+++
The practice of parents killing their child  
is uncommon and subject to sharp condemnation. In some cases these infants  
are illegitimate, and infanticide or abandonment is an attempt to avoid the  
social repercussions of what is considered an immoral act.  
There are several examples of this  
practice in Hindu mythology, of whom  
the best known is **Kunti**. Kunti has been  
given a **mantra** by the sage **Durvasas**,  
which gives her the power to conceive  
and bear children by the gods. On a  
whim, Kunti impulsively uses the  
mantra to invoke the **Sun**, by whom  
she conceives and bears her son **Karna**.  
In her panic at unexpectedly becoming  
a mother—she was still unmarried,  
and understandably concerned about  
what people might think—she puts  
the child in a box and abandons him  
in the **Ganges**.  
In other cases, infants are killed by  
their parents because of the family’s  
desperate poverty. Almost without  
exception, the children killed in such  
cases are **daughters**. If caught, the parents would be subject to a murder  
charge. But infanticide is often hard to  
prove if a baby was not born in a hospital, where births are formally registered.  
For poor families, daughters are often  
seen as a tremendous financial burden,  
because the expense that will be necessary to arrange their marriages is often  
more than people can pay. This attitude  
toward daughters is also reinforced by  
the traditional Indian marriage pattern,  
in which a family’s **sons** bring their  
brides into the family home, continue  
the joint family, and care for their  
parents in their old age. Since after  
marriage daughters become members  
of their husband’s family, they are often  
seen as “temporary” residents in the  
homes of their parents. For further
