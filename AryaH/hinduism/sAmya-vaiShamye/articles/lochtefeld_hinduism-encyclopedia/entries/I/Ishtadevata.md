title = "Ishtadevata"

+++
(“chosen **deity**”) The specific Hindu  
divinity that an individual has chosen for  
more or less exclusive **worship** and  
devotion. In many cases, this choice is  
done without denying the existence of  
the other Hindu deities, although they  
are sometimes interpreted as secondary  
manifestations of the ishtadevata. On  
the whole, Hindus have been willing to  
acknowledge a plurality of divine names  
and forms, but each person generally  
directs attention and worship to only  
one of these deities. The particular deity  
one worships is ultimately a matter of  
personal choice, although family and  
regional loyalties usually play a strong  
role in this choice.
