title = "Ilangovadigal"

+++
Poet traditionally named as the author  
of the **Tamil epic** poem **Shilappadigaram**  
(“The Jeweled Anklet”). The poem highlights several themes important to  
Hindu culture, particularly the need for  
kings to be righteous in their judgments,  
and the power gained by a wife through  
devotion to her husband.  
The main characters in the poem are  
a young couple, Kannaki and Kovalan.  
When Kovalan is executed because of a  
tragic misunderstanding, his wife  
Kannaki pronounces a **curse** on the city  
of **Madurai**, which causes many of  
the citizens to die before Kannaki  
retracts it at the behest of Madurai’s  
patron **goddess**.  
Ilangovadigal is believed to have  
lived in the first or second century C.E., a  
date that makes his authorship improbable, since the poem was probably written several centuries later.
