title = "Ida Nadi"

+++
One of the vertical channels (**nadi**) in  
the traditional conceptions of the **subtle**  
**body**. The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system believed to reside  
on a different plane of existence than  
the actual body, but with certain correspondences to it. It is visualized as a set  
of six psychic centers (**chakras**) running  
roughly along the course of the spine,  
connected by three parallel vertical  
channels. Above and below these centers are found **Shiva** (awareness) and  
**Shakti** (power), the latter as the latent  
spiritual energy known as **kundalini**.  
The ida nadi is the vertical channel  
on the left side of the body. As with  
the rest of the subtle body, the ida nadi  
has certain symbolic correspondences;  
in particular, it is identified with the  
**moon** and is thus visualized as being  
light in color.
