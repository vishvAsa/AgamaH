(4th c.) Indian philosopher who is  
traditionally cited as the author of the  
*Samkhyakarikas*, a collection of sayings  
that explain the basic position of the  
**Samkhya** philosophical school. The  
Samkhya school is one of the **six**  
**schools** in traditional Hindu **philosophy**, and its position is an atheistic  
philosophical dualism, in which two  
fundamental principles, **prakrti** (“nature”)  
and **purusha** (“person”), are the source  
of all things.
