title = "Indigenous Aryan Theory"

+++
The theory that the **Aryans** were indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, rather  
than immigrants from other lands. The  
word Arya (“noble”) is the name used for  
themselves by the people who composed the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu religious texts.  
Nineteenth-century European scholarship discovered structural relationships between **Sanskrit** and classical  
European languages and speculated  
that all these languages came from a  
common parent. Based on further  
analysis, these researchers hypothesized  
that people speaking this parent language originated in central Asia, somewhere near the Caspian Sea. From there,  
some went west to Europe, some went  
southwest to Turkey, and some went  
south toward Iran, and later to India.  
The conclusion that these Indian pilgrims came from Iran is based on comparisons between the Avesta and the  
Veda, the Iranian and Indian religious  
texts. These texts show broad linguistic  
similarities, and thus indicate that the  
people speaking the languages were  
closely related. This entire theory is thus  
based solely on the observed similarities  
between languages, and assumptions  
about how it changed.  
Indigenous Aryan theory supporters  
reject this claim and maintain that the

Impurity  
Aryans are the original inhabitants of  
India, and as proof point to the artifacts  
found in the **Indus Valley civilization**,  
an ancient urban network in northeastern India. Both of these claims are highly  
tenuous and do not address the philological evidence behind the original  
Aryan theory. The Indigenous Aryan  
theory has political implications that  
have helped to spur its growth. Some  
supporters are reacting against the  
Aryan migration theory’s perceived  
colonialist bias, since the theory was  
developed by Europeans and assumes  
that the dominant groups in modern  
India must have come from outside.  
Other supporters of this theory are the  
proponents of **Hindutva**, who claim  
that all Indians are “really” Hindus, and  
thus one social group, whatever their  
particular religious beliefs. This assertion has profound political implications in modern India, where Christians  
and Muslims are not only religious communities, but social and political ones.  
By connecting Hindu identity and good  
Indian citizenship, Hindutva proponents are marginalizing Christians and  
Muslims as outsiders.
