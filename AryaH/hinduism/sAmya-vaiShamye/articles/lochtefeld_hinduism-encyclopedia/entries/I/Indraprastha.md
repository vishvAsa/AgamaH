title = "Indraprastha"

+++
The name given to the earliest of the  
cities built on the site now occupied  
by modern Delhi; Indraprastha was  
built on the banks of the **Yamuna**  
**River**, in the southeastern part of  
modern Delhi.  
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Indraprastha is  
named as the capital of the **Pandavas**,  
the five brothers who are the epicâ€™s protagonists. According to the epic, the  
city is built after their uncle, King  
**Dhrtarashtra**, has divided his kingdom  
between the Pandavas and his own  
**sons**, the **Kauravas**.  
Although the epic is replete with  
descriptions of Indraprastha, there is  
little hard connection between the  
archeological site and events described  
in the epic.
