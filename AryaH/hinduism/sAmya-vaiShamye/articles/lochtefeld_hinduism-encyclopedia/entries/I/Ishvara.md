(“lord”) Primarily an epithet of the god  
**Shiva**, especially when the word is used  
at the end of compound names, such as  
**Rameshvar**, “the Lord of **Rama**,” or  
**Mahakaleshvar**, “the Lord of Death.” In  
its more general meaning as “lord,” ishvara can also be part of the name taken  
by earthly rulers, such as the **Chalukya**  
monarch **Someshvara** (r. 1242–1268).
