The oldest Hindu inscriptions are the  
edicts of **Ashoka**, which were either  
carved on rock faces or on stone  
pillars; many of these inscriptions are  
still readable today, despite being  
more than two thousand years old.  
Inscriptions on pillars were ordered  
by rulers, and were concerned with  
more sweeping issues, probably due  
to the inscriptionsâ€™ public quality  
and their often monumental nature.  
Aside from stone, the inscriptions  
were often done on copper plates.  
These were often used to record land  
grants, deeds, and other sorts of  
bequests, since their permanence  
made them more preferable than paper  
for safeguarding property rights. In  
themselves such inscriptions generally  
contain very specific historical information, which can help to fill out more general knowledge about their time.
