  <meta property="og:description" content="(3000–2000 B.C.E.) An ancient and highly
developed urban culture, so named
because the first two sites discovered,
Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, both lie
on the Indus River in what is now
Pakistan. Further searching has
uncovered other sites along much of the
Indus, as well as a web of settlements
stretching east to the upper Ganges
basin, south through the modern state
of Gujarat and into modern
Maharashtra, and along the coast of
modern Pakistan. The greatest concentration of these settlements has been
found along the banks of the Ghaggar
River, a small and seasonal watercourse
that runs through the state of
Rajasthan. Some historians claim that it
is the bed of the ancient Saraswati
River. Evidence from the sites seems to
indicate that the sites further to the
south developed later, but remained
vital after the cities in the Indus River
Valley, particularly Harappa and
Mohenjo-Daro, had fallen into oblivion.
The discovery of these sites in the early
twentieth century prompted significant
historical revision, since before then it
had been generally assumed that the
people known as the Aryans were the
earliest developed culture in India.
The most striking feature of these
cities is their uniformity—their general
city plan was nearly identical from place
to place (although they differed in
scale), the bricks used throughout all the
cities were exactly the same size, and
there was a standardized set of weights
and measures. Each of the cities also
had a large central granary, which stored
the grain necessary to feed such a sizable urban population. Such evident
uniformity over such long distances
bears clear witness to a strong and
centralized government, which some
analysts have speculated was religious
in nature.
Another striking feature of all the
cities was an advanced sanitation system. All the houses had channels for
water, and an elaborate network of
drains and sewers ran throughout the
city, even in those sections where the
houses were the smallest, and people
presumably the poorest. Mohenjo-Daro
also has a great tank built of brick and
sealed with pitch, which the archaeologists have dubbed the “Great Bath.” Why
were the people who built these cities so
concerned with sanitation and bathing?
298
Indus Valley Art
Some experts believe this reflected religious concern for ritual purity, rather
than hygiene.
Many of the artifacts from these
cities are remarkably well preserved,
and give us a fairly comprehensive picture of their material culture: what they
ate (wheat and barley were the primary
food grains), what they wore (cotton),
which animals they had domesticated
(cattle, fowl, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys,
and dogs), and the implements of everyday life.
Archeological excavations have also
found more than 2,000 small seals,
which are assumed to have served as the
insignia for mercantile families. Many of
the seals bear writing, although it has
never been deciphered, as well as realistic pictures of animals and human
beings. Three of the seals display a
horned figure sitting with his upper legs
splayed and his heels touching one
another. Some viewers have cited the
figure on these seals as proof that the
Indus Valley culture is the ultimate
source for the god Shiva, a figure who
does not appear in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious texts, but who later
becomes one of the primary Hindu
deities. In the same way, recovery of several statues of women with grossly exaggerated female characteristics—breasts,
buttocks, and genitalia—have prompted
others to claim that this culture was the
source for the later Hindu cult of the
Mother Goddess.
One of the controversies connected
with the Indus Valley culture is what
people were living there and whether
their descendants still live in India. The
generally accepted theory among Western
scholars describes a period of contact
between the people in these cities and a
299
Indus Valley Civilization
Ruins in Mohenjo-Daro. These structures are some of the earliest discovered evidence of the
Indus Valley civilization, a society believed to have emerged around 3000 B.C.E.
pastoral group of outsiders called the
Aryans. The language of the Aryans,
Sanskrit, shows certain structural relationships with classical European languages and even closer connections to
the Avesta, religious texts of ancient
Iran. Based on an analysis of the relationships between these languages and
the rate at which these languages have
changed, scholars have inferred that all
these languages came from a common
mother language, and that people
speaking this parent language originated
in central Asia, somewhere near the
Caspian Sea. From there, some went
west to Europe, some went southwest to
Turkey, and some went south toward
Iran, and later to India. This entire theory
is thus based almost solely on the
observed similarities between languages and assumptions about the rate
of linguistic change—some of which are
necessarily arbitrary.
The one piece of material evidence
for this theory comes in the remains of
horses found at the Indus Valley sites.
The horse was an established part of
Aryan life, according to references based
on the Aryan religious texts, the Vedas,
whereas it seems to have been absent
from the Indus Valley cities—it is not
portrayed on any of the carved seals,
which show many other animals, and
the only bones that have been recovered
from the Indus Valley cities are found in
the most recent archeological strata.
This theory describes a period of contact and possible conflict between the
Aryans and Indus Valley peoples, after
which the Aryan culture and religion
became the dominant force in Indian
life. The Indus Valley cities were completely forgotten until they were excavated in the early twentieth century.
The Aryan migration theory accounts
for the dissemination of various languages, but is not universally accepted.
Many modern Indians subscribe to the
Indigenous Aryan (IA) theory, which
contends that the Aryans are the original
inhabitants of India, and as proof points
to the artifacts found in the Indus Valley
civilization. Some IA supporters are
reacting against the Aryan migration
theory’s perceived colonialist bias,
since the theory was developed by
Europeans and assumes that the dominant groups in modern India must have
come from outside. Other supporters
are the proponents of Hindutva, who
identify being Hindu with being an
Indian. The IA theory allows Hindutva
proponents to claim that all Indians are
“really” Hindus and thus one social
group, whatever their particular religious beliefs. This assertion has profound political implications in modern
India, where Christians and Muslims
are not only religious communities,
but social and political ones. By connecting Hindu identity and good
Indian citizenship, Hindutva proponents are marginalizing Christians and
Muslims as outsiders.
Such claims are intriguing, but there
is slim evidence for them. The real truth
is that researchers have recovered lots
of material objects, but what these
things mean is open to interpretation.
At the very least, we know that this
culture flourished for about a thousand
years. Its final collapse—because of
a prolonged drought, according to
one theory—took place around 2000
B.C.E. For further information see

  <p>(3000–2000 B.C.E.) An ancient and highly<br>
developed urban culture, so named<br>
because the first two sites discovered,<br>
<strong>Mohenjo-Daro</strong> and <strong>Harappa</strong>, both lie<br>
on the <strong>Indus</strong> River in what is now<br>
Pakistan. Further searching has<br>
uncovered other sites along much of the<br>
Indus, as well as a web of settlements<br>
stretching east to the upper <strong>Ganges</strong><br>
basin, south through the modern state<br>
of <strong>Gujarat</strong> and into modern<br>
<strong>Maharashtra</strong>, and along the coast of<br>
modern Pakistan. The greatest concentration of these settlements has been<br>
found along the banks of the Ghaggar<br>
River, a small and seasonal watercourse<br>
that runs through the state of<br>
<strong>Rajasthan</strong>. Some historians claim that it<br>
is the bed of the ancient <strong>Saraswati</strong><br>
<strong>River</strong>. Evidence from the sites seems to<br>
indicate that the sites further to the<br>
south developed later, but remained<br>
vital after the cities in the Indus River<br>
Valley, particularly Harappa and<br>
Mohenjo-Daro, had fallen into oblivion.<br>
The discovery of these sites in the early<br>
twentieth century prompted significant<br>
historical revision, since before then it<br>
had been generally assumed that the<br>
people known as the <strong>Aryans</strong> were the<br>
earliest developed culture in India.<br>
The most striking feature of these<br>
cities is their uniformity—their general<br>
city plan was nearly identical from place<br>
to place (although they differed in<br>
scale), the bricks used throughout all the<br>
cities were exactly the same size, and<br>
there was a standardized set of weights<br>
and measures. Each of the cities also<br>
had a large central granary, which stored<br>
the grain necessary to feed such a sizable urban population. Such evident<br>
uniformity over such long distances<br>
bears clear witness to a strong and<br>
centralized government, which some<br>
analysts have speculated was religious<br>
in nature.<br>
Another striking feature of all the<br>
cities was an advanced sanitation system. All the houses had channels for<br>
<strong>water</strong>, and an elaborate network of<br>
drains and sewers ran throughout the<br>
city, even in those sections where the<br>
houses were the smallest, and people<br>
presumably the poorest. Mohenjo-Daro<br>
also has a great tank built of brick and<br>
sealed with pitch, which the archaeologists have dubbed the “Great <strong>Bath</strong>.” Why<br>
were the people who built these cities so<br>
concerned with sanitation and bathing?<br>
298<br>
Indus Valley Art<br>
Some experts believe this reflected religious concern for ritual <strong>purity</strong>, rather<br>
than hygiene.<br>
Many of the artifacts from these<br>
cities are remarkably well preserved,<br>
and give us a fairly comprehensive picture of their material culture: what they<br>
ate (wheat and barley were the primary<br>
food grains), what they wore (cotton),<br>
which <strong>animals</strong> they had domesticated<br>
(cattle, fowl, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys,<br>
and dogs), and the implements of everyday life.<br>
Archeological excavations have also<br>
found more than 2,000 small seals,<br>
which are assumed to have served as the<br>
insignia for mercantile families. Many of<br>
the seals bear writing, although it has<br>
never been deciphered, as well as realistic pictures of animals and human<br>
beings. Three of the seals display a<br>
horned figure sitting with his upper legs<br>
splayed and his heels touching one<br>
another. Some viewers have cited the<br>
figure on these seals as proof that the<br>
Indus Valley culture is the ultimate<br>
source for the god <strong>Shiva</strong>, a figure who<br>
does not appear in the <strong>Vedas</strong>, the earliest Hindu religious texts, but who later<br>
becomes one of the primary Hindu<br>
<strong>deities</strong>. In the same way, recovery of several statues of <strong>women</strong> with grossly exaggerated female characteristics—breasts,<br>
buttocks, and genitalia—have prompted<br>
others to claim that this culture was the<br>
source for the later Hindu cult of the<br>
Mother <strong>Goddess</strong>.<br>
One of the controversies connected<br>
with the Indus Valley culture is what<br>
people were living there and whether<br>
their descendants still live in India. The<br>
generally accepted theory among Western<br>
scholars describes a period of contact<br>
between the people in these cities and a<br>
299<br>
Indus Valley Civilization<br>
Ruins in Mohenjo-Daro. These structures are some of the earliest discovered evidence of the<br>
Indus Valley civilization, a society believed to have emerged around 3000 B.C.E.<br>
pastoral group of outsiders called the<br>
Aryans. The language of the Aryans,<br>
<strong>Sanskrit</strong>, shows certain structural relationships with classical European languages and even closer connections to<br>
the Avesta, religious texts of ancient<br>
Iran. Based on an analysis of the relationships between these languages and<br>
the rate at which these languages have<br>
changed, scholars have inferred that all<br>
these languages came from a common<br>
mother language, and that people<br>
speaking this parent language originated<br>
in central Asia, somewhere near the<br>
Caspian Sea. From there, some went<br>
west to Europe, some went southwest to<br>
Turkey, and some went south toward<br>
Iran, and later to India. This entire theory<br>
is thus based almost solely on the<br>
observed similarities between languages and assumptions about the rate<br>
of linguistic change—some of which are<br>
necessarily arbitrary.<br>
The one piece of material evidence<br>
for this theory comes in the remains of<br>
horses found at the Indus Valley sites.<br>
The horse was an established part of<br>
Aryan life, according to references based<br>
on the Aryan religious texts, the Vedas,<br>
whereas it seems to have been absent<br>
from the Indus Valley cities—it is not<br>
portrayed on any of the carved seals,<br>
which show many other animals, and<br>
the only bones that have been recovered<br>
from the Indus Valley cities are found in<br>
the most recent archeological strata.<br>
This theory describes a period of contact and possible conflict between the<br>
Aryans and Indus Valley peoples, after<br>
which the Aryan culture and religion<br>
became the dominant force in Indian<br>
life. The Indus Valley cities were completely forgotten until they were excavated in the early twentieth century.<br>
The Aryan migration theory accounts<br>
for the dissemination of various languages, but is not universally accepted.<br>
Many modern Indians subscribe to the<br>
<strong>Indigenous Aryan</strong> (IA) <strong>theory</strong>, which<br>
contends that the Aryans are the original<br>
inhabitants of India, and as proof points<br>
to the artifacts found in the Indus Valley<br>
civilization. Some IA supporters are<br>
reacting against the Aryan migration<br>
theory’s perceived colonialist bias,<br>
since the theory was developed by<br>
Europeans and assumes that the dominant groups in modern India must have<br>
come from outside. Other supporters<br>
are the proponents of <strong>Hindutva</strong>, who<br>
identify being Hindu with being an<br>
Indian. The IA theory allows Hindutva<br>
proponents to claim that all Indians are<br>
“really” Hindus and thus one social<br>
group, whatever their particular religious beliefs. This assertion has profound political implications in modern<br>
India, where Christians and Muslims<br>
are not only religious communities,<br>
but social and political ones. By connecting Hindu identity and good<br>
Indian citizenship, Hindutva proponents are marginalizing Christians and<br>
Muslims as outsiders.<br>
Such claims are intriguing, but there<br>
is slim evidence for them. The real truth<br>
is that researchers have recovered lots<br>
of material objects, but what these<br>
things mean is open to interpretation.<br>
At the very least, we know that this<br>
culture flourished for about a thousand<br>
years. Its final collapse—because of<br>
a prolonged drought, according to<br>
one theory—took place around 2000<br>
B.C.E. For further information see<br>
