title = "Inheritance"

+++
Traditional Hindu law has several different patterns for inheritance. A few  
communities in southern India practice  
**matrilinear succession**, in which  
inheritance is passed through the  
mother’s line.  
In much of the rest of India,  
inheritance is patrilineal. Patrilineal  
inheritance takes two major forms,  
according to the prescriptions found  
in two major legal texts: the **Dayabhaga**  
in the region of Bengal; and throughout  
much of the rest of India, variants  
on the **Mitakshara**.  
The *Mitakshara* vests joint family  
property only in males born into the  
male line. All males have equal shares  
in the family property, although the  
head of the family is normally in  
charge of administering it. Under this  
arrangement, the death of a male  
heir automatically increases the share  
of all the other surviving males,  
whereas the **birth** of a male decreases  
this share. The *Mitakshara* gives  
**women** no right to inherit family  
property, although women generally  
have rights to personal wealth  
(**stridhan**) that was theirs to bequeath  
and inherit.  
The *Mitakshara* system was based on  
the principle of survivorship, under  
which only living people could inherit  
property. The **Dayabhaga** model stresses  
succession, under which **sons** do not  
become shareholders of the family  
property at birth, but upon the death of  
their father. If a son happens to die  
before his father, the son’s heirs (including his wife and **daughters**) become  
inheritors, not in their own right, but as  
representatives of the deceased heir.  
Under the *Dayabhaga* model both  
**widows** and daughters could have a  
share in family property, and they are  
allowed to act as agents in their own  
right. In theory this seems far more  
advantageous to women, but in fact it is  
believed to have had some gruesome  
consequences. When the British first  
came to Bengal late in the eighteenth  
century, they were horrified by the  
prevalence of **sati**, the rite in which a  
widow would be burned on her husband’s funeral pyre. Based on admittedly  
incomplete evidence, it seems that sati  
was not nearly so common in many  
other parts of India. One theory to  
explain this discrepancy is that sati was  
the family’s way to keep their daughterin-law—who was an outsider to the  
family—from being able to gain control  
over their ancestral property.
