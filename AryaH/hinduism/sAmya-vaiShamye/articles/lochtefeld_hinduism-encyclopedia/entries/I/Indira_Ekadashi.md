title = "Indira Ekadashi"

+++
Festival falling on the eleventh **day**  
(**ekadashi**) of the dark (waning) half  
of the **lunar month** of **Ashvin**  
(September–October). As with all the  
eleventh-day observances, this is dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**, on this  
day in his form as the **Shalagram**. Most  
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed  
rites, usually involving fasting (**upavasa**)  
and worship, and often promise specific  
benefits. This ekadashi falls during the  
**pitrpaksha**, the fortnight dedicated to  
the ancestors, and faithfully observing  
this festival day is believed to result in  
the rescue of millions of one’s forebears  
from woeful incarnations and bring  
them rebirth in **heaven**. The name  
“Indira” is an epithet of **Lakshmi**,  
Vishnu’s wife.
