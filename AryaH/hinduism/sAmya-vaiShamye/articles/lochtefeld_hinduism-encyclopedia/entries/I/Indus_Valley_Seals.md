title = "Indus Valley Seals"

+++
The most enigmatic objects from the  
**Indus Valley civilization** are small  
square or rectangular-shaped pieces of  
soapstone, which are believed to have  
been official seals for merchants and  
other individuals. Archaeologists have  
unearthed more than two thousand of  
these seals, which generally combine a  
pictorial image with an inscription.  
Most of the seal images are common  
domestic **animals**, particularly the **bull**,  
but a few portray mythical beasts such  
as a unicorn, or even more intriguing  
human figures. One well-known example of the latter shows a human figure—  
perhaps a mythic hero—strangling a  
**tiger** with each hand. Other figures  
include a horned man, in one case  
standing in front of a table and in another  
sitting in a **yoga**-like position. He is  
sometimes identified as an early form of  
the god **Shiva** and cited as evidence that  
this **deity’s** cult came from the Indus  
Valley cities.  
Far less is known about the seal  
**inscriptions**, since the writing system  
for these inscriptions has never been  
deciphered, although many different  
theories have been advanced. One reason for the disagreement is the division of opinion regarding the Indus  
Valley culture itself. Those who believe  
that Indus Valley culture preceded the  
arrival of the **Aryans**, and was distinct  
from it, tend to look for evidence in  
the **Dravidian** language family, which

Indus Valley Seals  
is linguistically distinct from the IndoAryan language family. Those who  
espouse the **Indigenous Aryan** view,  
which identifies the Indus Valley culture  
with that of the Aryans, tend to seek  
their evidence in the earliest **Sanskrit**  
texts known as the **Vedas**.  
None of these theories have proved  
irrefutable, and part of the difficulty in  
deciphering this script comes from the  
inscriptions themselves. Linguists have  
identified 419 different symbols, which  
seems too many for the script to be  
alphabetic, but too few for each of these  
symbols to stand for a single word, as is  
the case in Chinese. The seals’ small size  
also means that these inscriptions tend  
to be extremely short. Such brevity  
makes the text difficult to understand,  
since one lacks the contextual patterns  
that a longer text would supply. In their  
efforts to decode these inscriptions, linguists are working with a series of short  
and unrelated textual fragments. The  
script could probably be definitively  
deciphered with the discovery of a bilingual inscription, but in the absence of  
such a key, the problems may prove to  
be insurmountable. For further information see F. Raymond Allchin, *The*
