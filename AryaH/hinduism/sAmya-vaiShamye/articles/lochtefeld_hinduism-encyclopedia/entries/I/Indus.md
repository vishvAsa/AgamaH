title = "Indus"

River whose source lies in the high  
**Himalayas**, but which flows through  
297  
Indus  
Pakistan for most of its length. The  
Indus is traditionally considered one of  
the seven sacred rivers of India—the  
others are the **Ganges**, **Yamuna**,  
**Godavari**, **Saraswati**, **Narmada**, and  
**Cauvery**—although in modern times  
this has diminished, especially since the  
creation of Pakistan in 1947 rendered it  
inaccessible to most Hindus.  
Despite its diminished religious significance, the Indus remains important  
from a historical perspective, since  
many archeological sites from the **Indus**  
**Valley civilization** have been discovered  
on its banks.
