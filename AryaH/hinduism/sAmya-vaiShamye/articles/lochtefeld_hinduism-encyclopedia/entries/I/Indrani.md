title = "Indrani"

+++
(Feminine form of **Indra**) The wife of  
the god Indra, the ruler of **heaven**.  
Perhaps reflecting Indra’s diminished  
status in later Hindu mythology, Indrani  
is not a prominent figure. Her only  
important role is as an object of desire  
in the story of **Nahusha**, who through  
his meritorious deeds has displaced  
Indra as the king of heaven. Nahusha  
assumes that he is entitled to Indrani as  
well as Indra’s throne, and makes  
advances toward her. For his hubris, the  
sage **Agastya** curses Nahusha to be  
reborn as a giant serpent.
