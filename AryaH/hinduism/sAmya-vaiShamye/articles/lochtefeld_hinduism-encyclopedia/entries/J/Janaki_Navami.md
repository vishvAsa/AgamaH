title = "Janaki Navami"

+++
Festival falling on the ninth **day**  
(navami) of the dark (waning) half  
of the **lunar month** of **Phalgun**  
(February–March). This festival celebrates the **birth** of **Sita**, wife of the  
god king **Rama** and heroine of the  
epic **Ramayana**. Sita is not born in the  
usual manner, but is found by King  
**Janaka** in a furrow as he plows a field  
(hence the name Janaki, a female form  
of Janaka). As the wife of Rama, himself  
an **avatar** or incarnation of the god  
**Vishnu**, Sita is believed to be a form of  
**Lakshmi**, Vishnu’s wife. In her absolute  
devotion to her husband, Sita is considered a model for Indian **women**; women  
performing the prescribed religious rites  
for this day are promised children and  
prosperity.
