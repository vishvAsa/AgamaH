(early 12th c.) Author of the **Dayabhaga**,  
a legal text primarily concerned with  
**inheritance**, partition, and the division  
of property. It eventually became the primary legal authority for the Bengal cultural region; areas outside Bengal were  
usually governed by a different legal text,  
the **Mitakshara**. One of the major differences between these texts concerns the  
nature of inheritance. The *Mitakshara*  
stresses inheritance by survivorship, in  
which only living males can inherit property, whereas the *Dayabhaga* stresses  
inheritance by succession, in which a  
dead manâ€™s heirs can inherit in his name.
