title = "Jat"

+++
One of the hundreds of subgroups of  
traditional Indian society known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). Each jati was associated  
with—and held a monopoly over—a  
particular occupation, and that occupation determined the social status of the  
jati’s members; this system led to the  
modern **caste** system. The Jats are a  
northern Indian jati whose members are  
spread through many of the states of  
northern India, particularly **Haryana**,  
**Punjab**, **Uttar Pradesh**, and **Rajasthan**.  
In the Punjab the Jats are evenly split  
between Hindus and Sikhs, but in other  
areas the community is solidly Hindu.  
The Jats’ hereditary occupation is farming, and they are often described as  
tough and resilient peasants; these qualities have also made them superior soldiers, both in the service of the British  
Empire and in independent India.
