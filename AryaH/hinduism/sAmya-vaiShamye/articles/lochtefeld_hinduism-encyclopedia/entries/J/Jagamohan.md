title = "Jagamohan"

+++
In the temple **architecture** of **Orissa**,  
one of the major forms of the northern  
Indian **Nagara** style, the jagamohan is  
the entrance porch to the temple, which  
provides a transitional space between  
the outside world and the sacred space  
further in. In Orissan temples, the jagamohan tended to be low and squat, in  
sharp contrast to the **deul**, or main  
internal area, a beehive-shaped tower  
under which the image of the templeâ€™s  
primary **deity** resided.
