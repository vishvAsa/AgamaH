title = "Jambukeshvar"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) and southern Indian  
temple-town near the city of  
**Tiruchirappalli** in the state of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, directly opposite the great  
temple complex of **Shrirangam**. The  
temple at Jambukeshvar is dedicated to  
the god **Shiva** in his role as “Lord of the  
Rose-Apple (jambu) Tree;” the image of  
Shiva is placed under one of these trees.  
Jambukeshvar is also one of the  
**bhutalingas** (“elemental **lingas**”), a  
network of five southern Indian sites  
sacred to Shiva. In each of these  
sites Shiva is represented as a linga,  
the pillar-shaped object that is his  
symbolic form, and at each site the  
linga is believed to be formed from one  
of the five primordial **elements**  
(bhuta)—**earth**, **wind**, **fire**, **water**, and  
**space** (**akasha**). At Jambukeshvar,  
Shiva’s image is associated with water,  
and the linga is set into a pool created  
by a natural spring.
