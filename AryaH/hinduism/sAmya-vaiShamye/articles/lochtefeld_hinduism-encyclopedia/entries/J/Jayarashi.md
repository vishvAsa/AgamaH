+++
(7th c.?) Author of the *Tattvopaplavasimha*,  
one of the only surviving texts of the  
**materialist** philosophical school. One  
of the philosophical peculiarities of  
the materialist school was that they  
accepted only perception (**pratyaksha**)  
as a reliable **pramana**, or means  
by which people can gain true and  
accurate knowledge. In his text,  
Jayarashi argued against the reliability of  
inference (**anumana**) as one of the  
pramanas by refuting the concept of  
cause and effect. To make an inference,  
such as inferring the result an action  
will bring in the future based on the  
result it brought in the past, one  
must believe that the cause-and-effect  
model is reliable.
