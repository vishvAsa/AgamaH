City and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
western part of **Nepal**, seven miles  
north of the border with the Indian state  
of **Bihar**. Janakpur is said to be the  
capital of King **Janaka**, a noted sage and  
the foster father of the **goddess Sita**  
in the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Hindu epics. According to tradition, Janaka’s capital was destroyed  
during the war described in the  
**Mahabharata**—the other great Hindu  
epic—and disappeared without a  
trace. The present site of Janakpur  
dates from the early eighteenth century  
and is said to have been discovered by  
two **Vaishnava** devotees (**bhakta**),  
Chaturbhuj Giri and Sur Kishor.  
Chaturbhuj Giri had a vision of the god  
**Rama** in a **dream** and was directed to  
dig beneath a banyan tree. When he did,  
he found four images of **Vishnu**, each in  
a differing divine manifestation. Sur  
Kishor was a great devotee of Sita, and  
through her agency discovered the spot  
as well. Other **ascetics** began to come to  
this site, which is still an important stop  
on the annual pilgrimage cycle of the  
**Ramanandi** ascetics. The ascetics were  
followed by shepherds and merchants,  
and the town of Janakpur gradually grew  
up from there. For extensive treatment  
of this site and the veracity of these  
stories, see Richard Burghart, “The  
History of Janakpur,” in *Kailash,* Vol. 6,  
No. 4, 1978.
