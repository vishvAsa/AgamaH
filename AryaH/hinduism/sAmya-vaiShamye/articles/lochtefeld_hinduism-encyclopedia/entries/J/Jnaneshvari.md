title = "Jnaneshvari"

+++
Marathi-language commentary on the  
**Bhagavad Gita**, one of the most influential Hindu religious texts. The  
*Jnaneshvari* was composed by the  
Maharashtrian poet-saint **Jnaneshvar**,  
whose intentions in writing it were to  
make the Bhagavad Gita accessible to  
the common people, who were not able  
to read the text in the original **Sanskrit**,  
and to give his own learned interpretation of the textâ€™s contents. This emphasis  
on giving ordinary people full access to  
religious life was one of the consistent  
themes in the (devotional) **bhakti** movement and, like many other figures,  
Jnaneshvar is reported to have faced  
considerable opposition from the **brahmin** priests, who thought that such  
advanced teachings should not be  
revealed to the common public.
