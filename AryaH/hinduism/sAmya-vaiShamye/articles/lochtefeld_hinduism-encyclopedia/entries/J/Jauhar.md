title = "Jauhar"

+++
A mass **suicide** in which **women** and  
children threw themselves on a bonfire  
to protect the family from dishonor  
when the men were defeated or killed in  
battle. Jauhar was considered the  
womenâ€™s counterpart to death in combat. If their husbands and fathers were  
heavily outnumbered and faced certain  
death in battle, women would perform a  
mass suicide after the men left their  
fortresses. This phenomenon was most  
closely associated with the desert state  
of **Rajasthan**, which has strong martial  
traditions and a great stress on the  
importance of family honor. It is particularly associated with the **Rajasthani**  
city of Chittorgarh, where jauhars  
occurred in 1303, 1535, and 1568.
