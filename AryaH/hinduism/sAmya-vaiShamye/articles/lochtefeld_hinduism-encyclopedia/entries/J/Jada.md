title = "Jada"

+++
(“inert,” “insentient”) In a philosophical  
context, the word *jada* is used to designate physical matter, which is inert and  
devoid of cognitive functions. In a more  
extended sense, the word can refer to  
any person completely lacking religious  
capacities, sensibilities, or interest, and  
who is, thus, from a religious perspective, simply inert.
