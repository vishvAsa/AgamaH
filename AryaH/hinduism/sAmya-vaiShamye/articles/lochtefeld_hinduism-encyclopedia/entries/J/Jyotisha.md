In its most general usage, the word  
*jyotisha* refers to astrology. The word  
itself is derived from *jyotis* (“light,” and  
by extension the heavenly bodies) and is  
concerned with the movement of the  
celestial bodies, their varying configurations, and the divisions of time that are  
derived from them. This attention to the  
**heavens** is a very old cultural concern,  
for jyotisha is one of the six **Vedangas**,  
the auxiliary branches of knowledge  
connected with the sacred scriptures  
known as the **Vedas**. As one of the  
Vedangas, jyotisha was concerned with  
identifying appropriate days and times  
to perform Vedic sacrifices.  
Even in modern times, many traditional Hindus take astrology very seriously, based on the assumption that the  
results of one’s previous **karma** lead one  
to be born at a particular moment. One’s  
**natal horoscope**, or the positioning of  
the celestial bodies at the time of **birth**,  
thus provides a karmic “itinerary” indicating where one has been and what one  
might expect in the future. People frequently consider astrology when making important decisions, particularly in  
arranging marriages—to determine the  
couple’s compatibility, to see whether  
any trouble is lurking ahead, and to  
arrange an auspicious or lucky time for  
the ceremony itself. In the same way,  
some Hindus will consult an astrologer  
before beginning any important undertaking, to be sure that the work will  
begin at an auspicious time and will  
therefore be more likely to succeed.  
The basic principles of Indian astrology are very similar to those of Western  
astrology. The **zodiac** signs are nearly  
identical. However, the two systems

have a different method for determining  
each sign’s starting point, causing some  
discrepancies between the two systems.  
Aside from the **sun**, **moon**, and five visible **planets** in Western astrology, Indian  
astrology has two additional planets,  
**Rahu** and **Ketu**, which are both considered inauspicious and malevolent. In  
addition to the twelve signs of the solar  
zodiac, Indian astrology also has a lunar  
zodiac with twenty-seven “lunar mansions” (**nakshatras**), each of which has  
particular qualities. Although at the  
most basic level astrological reckoning  
is fairly simple, it can quickly become  
highly complex and is thus generally left  
to professional astrologers. This is still a  
viable profession throughout much of  
India, since the generally accepted  
belief that some times are **auspicious**  
and others **inauspicious** means that  
ordinary people will hire specialists to  
keep them informed of these times.
