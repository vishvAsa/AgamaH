title = "Janmashtami"

+++
Festival on the eighth **day** (ashtami)  
of the dark (waning) half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Bhadrapada** (August–  
September), which is celebrated as the  
god **Krishna’s** birthday. As with all  
314  
Janardana  
holidays connected with Krishna, this  
festival is particularly observed in the  
**Braj** region, where Krishna is supposed to have lived, although it is also  
celebrated throughout the country.  
Devotees (**bhakta**) often stay up late  
into the night, since Krishna is said to  
have been born at midnight, and the  
observances are often punctuated with  
singing, chanting, parades, and dramas  
enacting events in Krishna’s life. It is  
during the month around Janmashtami  
that the dramas known as the Krishna  
**lilas** are presented in the town of  
**Brindavan**, traditionally believed to  
have been Krishna’s childhood home.  
According to tradition, Krishna is the  
eighth **son** of **Devaki** and **Vasudeva**. He  
is born in a prison in the city of **Mathura**  
in which his parents are held by Devaki’s  
brother, the wicked king **Kamsa**. Kamsa  
has imprisoned the pair in an attempt to  
thwart the prophecy that he will be  
killed by his sister Devaki’s eighth son.  
Kamsa has killed all of Devaki’s older  
children at **birth** and intends to do the  
same with Krishna, but when Krishna is  
born wondrous things begin to happen:  
the jailers fall into a deep sleep, the  
locked prison doors miraculously  
open, and Vasudeva is able to spirit the  
infant out of the prison to the home of  
the couple who will become his foster  
parents, **Nanda** and **Yashoda**. Vasudeva  
returns that night, bearing Yashoda’s  
new-born baby girl, who is really the  
**goddess Bhadrakali** in disguise. The  
next morning Kamsa kills the child by  
dashing her against a stone, but from  
the body arises a fearsome form of the  
Goddess, who taunts Kamsa by telling  
him that the person who will slay him  
has already escaped.
