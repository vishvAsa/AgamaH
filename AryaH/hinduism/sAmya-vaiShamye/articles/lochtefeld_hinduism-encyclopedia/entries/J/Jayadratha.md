title = "Jayadratha"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Jayadratha is a king  
who is married to the princess Dussala.  
Dussala is the only sister of the  
**Kauravas**, a group of one hundred  
brothers who are the epic’s antagonists.  
Jayadratha once sought the hand of  
**Draupadi**, and because of his bitterness  
at having lost her to the warrior **Arjuna**,  
he opposes Arjuna and his brothers, the  
**Pandavas**, for the rest of his life. During  
the Mahabharata war between the  
Pandavas and the Kauravas, Jayadratha  
takes the side of the Kauravas and is  
eventually killed by Arjuna. At  
Jayadratha’s **birth** a celestial voice has  
prophesied that the head of the person  
who causes Jayadratha’s head to fall to  
**earth** will split into a hundred pieces.  
Mindful of this, Arjuna, a peerless  
archer, cuts off Jayadratha’s head with an  
arrow in such a way that it lands in the  
lap of Jayadratha’s father, Brhatkaya.  
Brhatkaya is so startled that he allows  
the head to fall from his lap to the  
ground, and his own head breaks into a  
hundred pieces.
