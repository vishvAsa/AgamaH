title = "Jaratkarava Artabhaga"

+++
One of the sage **Yajnavalkya’s** interviewers in the **Brhadaranyaka Upanishad**,  
one of the earliest of the **Upanishads**.  
The third chapter of this upanishad  
presents a series of questioners, each  
trying to test Yajnavalkya’s assertion that  
he is the best **brahmin** of all. Artabhaga  
finally questions Yajnavalkya about the  
human sense faculties and their realms  
of action, and eventually asks what happens to a person after death. Yajnavalkya  
draws him aside in private, and talks to  
him about **karma** (“action”), in what  
is generally regarded as the oldest  
reference to this fundamental Indian  
religious idea.
