title = "Janabai"

+++
(d. c.1350) Female poet and saint in the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba** at his temple at  
**Pandharpur** in the modern state of  
**Maharashtra**. According to tradition,  
Janabai came to Pandharpur with her  
parents when she was seven but refused  
to go home with them, saying that she  
wanted to remain close to the Lord. She  
became the servant of another Varkari  
saint, **Namdev**, who made her a member of his circle of devotees (**bhakta**).  
Janabai is famous for her devotional  
songs, which remain popular today. For
