title = "Jatamakuta"

+++
A crown (makuta) made of matted locks  
of **hair** (**jata**) twisted together and  
bound on top of the head. In Hindu  
iconography the jatamakuta is most  
closely associated with the god **Shiva**,  
who is the paradigmatic **ascetic** and  
always wears his hair in matted locks. In  
modern times, the jatamakuta is still a  
hairstyle associated with many ascetics,  
both **Shaiva** and **Vaishnava**.
