title = "Jahnavi"

+++
(“**daughter** of **Jahnu**”) Epithet of the  
**Ganges** River, which Hindus consider to  
be the physical form of the **goddess**  
**Ganga**. The name Jahnavi refers to an  
incident during her creation in which  
she encounters Jahnu, a great **ascetic**  
who has amassed great power through  
performing harsh physical **asceticism**  
(**tapas**). After the Ganges has been  
brought down to **earth** by the sage  
**Bhagirath**, but before she makes her  
way to the ocean, the playful river picks  
up and carries away Jahnu’s belongings  
while the sage is meditating nearby.  
Jahnu is enraged at this disrespect; to  
punish Ganga, he drinks all of the **water**  
in the river. When the gods realize what  
has happened, they are very concerned.  
They somehow manage to placate  
Jahnu, and the sage agrees to release  
her. The problem then is how to release  
the Ganges in a way that will not defile  
her, since vomiting her up or voiding her  
as urine are both unacceptable. In the  
end, Jahnu bypasses this dilemma by  
releasing her through his ear. She continues on her way to the sea, but  
acquires the name Jahnavi by virtue of  
being “born” from Jahnu.
