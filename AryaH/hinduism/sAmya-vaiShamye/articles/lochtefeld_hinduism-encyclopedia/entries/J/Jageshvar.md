Temple complex and sacred site (**tirtha**)  
in the village with the same name, located in the Kumaon foothills of the  
**Himalayas** in the state of **Uttar Pradesh**.  
The Jageshvar temple complex contains  
124 different temples, concentrated in an  
area about the size of a football field.  
Virtually all of these temples are dedicated  
to some form of the god **Shiva**, and the  
few that house other **deities** are either  
temples to the **Goddess**—considered to  
be Shiva’s wife—or in one case to the god  
**Hanuman**, who is sometimes considered  
an **avatar** or incarnation of Shiva. Most of  
these temples are extremely small—  
either an open image of Shiva’s aniconic  
symbol, the **linga**, or a temple building  
no larger than a telephone booth. The  
three largest most important temples are  
to Shiva in his forms as **Kedarnath**, as  
**Mrtyunjaya** (“Conqueror of Death”), and  
as Jageshvar, from which the site gets its  
name. The name Jageshvar means “The  
Wakeful Lord” and signifies that this particular form of Shiva is always alert to the  
needs of his devotees (**bhakta**) and will  
quickly fulfill any request.  
Local tradition claims that Jageshvar  
is one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network of sites deemed especially sacred to  
Shiva, and at which Shiva is uniquely present. This claim is not supported by the  
traditional list of the jyotirlingas, but  
Jageshvar has been a pilgrimage site for  
more than a thousand years. The  
Mrtyunjaya temple has been dated to the  
eighth century C.E., while the Jageshvar  
temple was built about two centuries  
later. Since that time, further building at  
the Jageshvar complex has come through  
patronage by several different groups of  
hill kings, most recently those of the  
Chand dynasty, who ruled the region  
between the fifteenth and eighteenth  
centuries. The temple complex’s indisputable antiquity, its association with  
royal power, and its identity as a place  
where Shiva readily grants one’s wishes,  
have all combined to make it the most  
important pilgrimage place in the  
Kumaon region.
