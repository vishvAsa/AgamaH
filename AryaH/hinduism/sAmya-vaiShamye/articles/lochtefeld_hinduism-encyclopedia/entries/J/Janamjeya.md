title = "Janamjeya"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the **son** of King  
**Parikshit**; Janamjeya rules after his  
father’s untimely death from the bite of  
the serpent **Takshaka**. Janamjeya has a  
pronounced hatred of serpents because  
of Takshaka’s role in his father’s death,  
and during his reign he performs a great  
**sacrifice** known as the Sarpasatra,  
through which most of the snakes on  
**earth** are killed. Takshaka manages to  
stop the sacrifice before all of the earth’s  
serpents are completely wiped out by  
pleading with a **brahmin** to help him.  
The brahmin comes to Janamjeya’s sacrifice as a guest and requests that the  
sacrifice be stopped. Since, according to  
tradition, a brahmin guest’s request cannot be refused, Janamjeya is compelled  
to curtail the rite.
