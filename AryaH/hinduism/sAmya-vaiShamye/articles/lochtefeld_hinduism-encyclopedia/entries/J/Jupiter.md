title = "Jupiter"

+++
In Hindu astrology, a planet associated  
with knowledge, power, and good character. In **Sanskrit**, Jupiter’s name is **guru**,  
and its importance in Hindu astrology  
reflects the importance of the guru or religious figure in Hindu religious life. Jupiter  
is the most powerful of the benevolent  
**planets**—the others are the **sun**, **moon**,  
**Mercury**, and **Venus**—although for each  
person Jupiter’s powers vary according to  
its place in the **natal horoscope**, or alignment of the heavenly bodies at the time of  
**birth**, and the influence of friendly or  
hostile planets. During the **week**, Jupiter  
presides over **Thursday** which, because of  
the planet’s astrological powers, is considered an auspicious, or lucky, **day**.
