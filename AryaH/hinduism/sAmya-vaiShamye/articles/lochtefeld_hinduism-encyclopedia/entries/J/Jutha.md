In its most general sense, jutha refers  
to any food that has come into contact  
with saliva. Such contact is believed to render that food impure and unfit  
for anyone else to eat. Since **eating** is traditionally done with one’s fingers, any food  
on one’s plate after one has begun to eat is  
considered contaminated by association,  
even if it has not yet been taken into one’s  
mouth. As with all bodily fluids, saliva is  
considered particularly impure, a substance that “imprints” food with the nature  
of the person eating it. Eating food from  
the same plate is a sign of extreme closeness—most commonly done by husband  
and wife, but also by very close friends.  
Conversely, eating another’s person’s leftovers is a sign of extreme status difference—it is done only by people who are  
desperately poor, by disciples as a sign of  
devotion to their **guru** or religious leader,  
or by devotees (**bhakta**) receiving **prasad**  
or sanctified food, the vehicle for **grace**  
from their chosen **deity**.
