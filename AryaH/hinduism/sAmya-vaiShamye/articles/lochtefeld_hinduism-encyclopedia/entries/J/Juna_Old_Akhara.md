title = "Juna (“Old”) Akhara"

+++
Name of one of seven subgroups of the  
**Naga** class of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
renunciant ascetics who are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**. The subgroups are known as **akharas** and are  
similar to regiments of an army. Until  
the beginning of the nineteenth century  
the Nagas were primarily mercenary soldiers but were also active in merchandise trading; neither of these  
characteristics applies in contemporary  
times. Members of the Juna Akhara  
revere the sage **Dattatreya** as their “tutelary **deity**,” the primary deity from  
which they learn; each of the akharas  
have different tutelary deities. Some  
accounts say **Bhairava** was the patron  
deity of the Juna Akhara in earlier times,  
which would explain the fact that the  
group is also known as the Bhairava  
Akhara. The literal meaning of the present name and its connection with  
Bhairava imply that it is very old. In contemporary times it is a large organization found only in northern India. In  
some places it is given low status for  
admitting members from the lower  
social classes.

Juna (“Old”) Akhara  
Up until the middle of the present century, the Juna Akhara marched with the  
**Niranjani Akhara** in the bathing (**snana**)  
processions during the **Kumbha Mela** and  
was thus considered a subsidiary part of  
that akhara. For most of this century the  
Junas were upset that they held subordinate status despite the fact that they have  
far more members than any other akhara.  
The Junas began their attempt to gain the  
status of a separate procession with the  
1903 **Haridwar** Kumbha Mela, but were  
not accorded this position until 1962. The  
akharas agreed that during a Haridwar  
Kumbha Mela, the Junas would lead the  
**Sanyasi** processions for the bathing on the  
festival of **Shivaratri**. However, the  
Niranjanis would be first for the other two  
major bathing days—the **new moon** in  
**Chaitra** and the Kumbha bath on April 14.  
This arrangement broke down at the 1998  
Kumbha Mela in Haridwar, when the Junas  
demanded that they be allowed to go first  
at the Chaitra bath as well, based on their  
status as the largest akhara. On the day of  
the second bath, this disagreement erupted into a full-scale riot between **ascetic**  
groups and police in which many people  
were hurt. There was great worry that such  
violence would recur on the main bathing  
day, but the day came off without incident  
when the Juna Akhara boycotted the  
bathing processions.
