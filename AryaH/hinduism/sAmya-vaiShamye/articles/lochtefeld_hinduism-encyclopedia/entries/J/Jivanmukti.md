(“liberation while living”) In later Indian  
**philosophy**, the notion that one can  
attain final liberation of the soul while  
still living and continue to live after that  
in a liberated state. The **jivanmukta**  
(one who is liberated while still living) is  
an important claim for many of the subschools of **Advaita Vedanta**, one of the  
**six schools** of classical Indian philosophy. The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism,  
which is the belief that a single Ultimate  
Reality known as **Brahman** lies behind  
all things, and that all things are merely  
differing forms of that reality. For  
Advaita proponents, the problem of  
human bondage is that human beings,  
blinded by **avidya** or mistaken understanding, do not recognize this ultimate  
unity. Liberation is not attained by  
“doing” anything or by becoming something that one is not, but by realizing  
what has always been the case, and thus  
exchanging a mistaken understanding  
for a correct one. Although this cognition forever changes how a person perceives the world, it brings no ontological  
changes, meaning that on a physical  
level one continues to exist as before,  
until the **karma** that has created one’s  
present body is exhausted. For further
