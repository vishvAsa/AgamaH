In Indian philosophical thought, a  
word with different meanings in  
different contexts. The word *jnana* is  
derived from the verb “to know,” and  
one of its meanings, at least in a

it means to truly “know” something;

along with **karmamarga** and the  
**bhaktimarga**, the **jnanamarga** is one of  
the paths to liberation of the soul  
mentioned in the **Bhagavad Gita**. In this  
latter context, an appropriate translation might be “wisdom” or “realization,”  
since this is not the sort of “knowledge”  
that comes from reading a book or  
receiving instruction, but instead  
reflects profound understanding gained  
through great effort.
