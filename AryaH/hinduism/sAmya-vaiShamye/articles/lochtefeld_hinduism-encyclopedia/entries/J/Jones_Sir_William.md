+++
(1746–1794) Founder of the Asiatic  
Society of Bengal and one of the fathers  
of modern Indology. Jones came to  
Calcutta from England in 1783 as a  
Supreme Court judge during the governorship of Warren Hastings, considered  
one of the founders of the British  
Empire in India. He was employed by  
the East India Company, who, in its pursuit of trade and profit, acquired political power over regions of India. Jones  
immediately applied himself to the  
study of **Sanskrit**, in part to discover the  
particulars of traditional Hindu law,  
since the East India Company’s general  
policy was to allow different religious  
communities to be governed by their  
own traditional laws. Jones was a linguistic genius who had mastered the  
current and classical European languages, as well as Persian. He immediately recognized Sanskrit as a distant  
relative of Greek and Latin, and through  
his influence the serious study of  
Sanskrit texts began. From a legal perspective, his most important work was a  
translation of the laws of **Manu** (**Manu**  
**Smrti**). This was one of the most important texts in the **dharma literature** and  
prescribed ideal rules and regulations  
for all sorts of human conduct. This

Jnaneshvari  
translation was intended to give the  
British some idea of classical Hindu  
law, but they failed to realize that  
this text was composed not as a legal  
manual but as a guide to religious  
life. Jones died at age forty-eight from  
an inflammation of the liver. His translation was published posthumously.
