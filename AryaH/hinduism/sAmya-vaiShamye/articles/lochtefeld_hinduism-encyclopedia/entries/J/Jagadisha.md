(“Lord of the Universe”) Epithet of the  
regional **deity Jagannath**, and by extension the god **Vishnu**, to whom  
Jagannath has been connected as a form  
of **Krishna**, the eighth **avatar** or incarnation of Vishnu. Jagadisha is the name  
given to Jagannath in the **Dashavatara**  
**Stotra**, the opening hymn in the  
**Gitagovinda**, a lyric devotional poem  
composed by the poet **Jayadeva**. In  
modern northern India, the name

popular and best-known devotional  
hymns, the Jagadisha **Arati**, a hymn  
directed more particularly to Vishnu.
