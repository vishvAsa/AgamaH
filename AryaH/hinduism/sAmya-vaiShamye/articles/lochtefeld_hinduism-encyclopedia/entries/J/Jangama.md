title = "Jangama"

+++
(“moving”) Priestly subgroup in the  
Virashaiva or **Lingayat** community,  
whose members are mainly concentrated  
in the southern Indian state of **Karnataka**.  
The Virashaivas are a devotional community who stress the **worship** of **Shiva**  
as the only real **deity**; aside from being  
essentially monotheistic, they have also  
rejected all forms of image worship  
except for Shiva’s symbol, the **linga**. The  
Virashaivas were founded by the poetsaint **Basavanna**, partly in rebellion  
against the prevailing **caste** system, and  
he created the jangamas as a parallel  
priesthood to care for his community’s  
members. The major function of the  
jangamas is to officiate at lifecycle ceremonies for the members of the community, such as **birth**, coming-of-age,  
marriage, and death. Jangamas may be  
married and raise families, but this  
Virashaiva subcommunity also serves as  
the major source of recruits for the celibate Virashaiva monks (**viraktas**), who  
have the highest status as religious leaders in the community.
