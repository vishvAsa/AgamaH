(variant of **yogi**, “adept”) An epithet for  
various sorts of **ascetics**. It often refers  
to the **Nathpanthis**, followers of the  
teacher **Gorakhnath**. Their designation  
as “jogis” comes from the fact that the  
practice of **yoga**, particularly **hatha**  
**yoga**, is one of the major emphases in  
their religious life. The term may also  
refer to the **Aghoris**.
