+++
(“**Shraddha** for a living [person]”) A  
particular type of shraddha, or memorial service for the dead, although in  
this case it is performed for a person  
who is still living. In many cases, a  
person performs the Jivacchraddha for  
himself if he has no **sons** to fulfill the  
responsibility or if he suspects that  
the rite may not be performed properly  
after his death. The person performing  
this rite makes a small figure of sacred  
**kusha** grass, representing the person for  
whom the shraddha is being performed,  
and then proceeds with the normal  
shraddha ceremony.
