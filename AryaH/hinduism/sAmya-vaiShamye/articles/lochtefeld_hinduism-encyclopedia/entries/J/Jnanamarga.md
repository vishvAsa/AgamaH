title = "Jnanamarga"

+++
(“Path of Realization”) One of  
Hinduism’s three generally accepted  
paths to gain final liberation of the soul,  
along with the Path of Devotion (**bhaktimarga**) and the Path of Action (**karmamarga**). While the bhaktimarga  
stresses devotion to God and the karmamarga emphasizes selfless action in  
the world, the jnanamarga stresses realizing the ultimate identity of one’s individual Self (**atman**) and Ultimate Reality  
(**Brahman**). This realization is usually  
described as coming in a flash of insight,  
which may take years of effort to attain  
but which fundamentally shifts one’s  
perspective on the world.
