title = "Jana Sangh"

+++
Modern Indian political party, founded  
in 1951 by Shyam Prasad Mookerjee.  
Despite Mookerjee’s earlier roots in the  
**Hindu Mahasabha**, a Hindu nationalist  
organization, the Jana Sangh’s leadership largely came from workers  
dispatched by another conservative  
Hindu organization, the **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS). By the mid-  
1950s the Jana Sangh had become the  
political arm of the RSS, with RSS members filling most of the party’s important  
positions. In its political platform the  
Jana Sangh espoused many populist  
Hindu causes, such as a ban on **cow**  
**slaughter** and the **prohibition** of alcoholic beverages, but the party was also  
noted for its sympathetic orientation  
toward farmers, who formed one of its  
important constituencies. The Jana  
Sangh’s high point came in the 1977 general elections, when it won ninety-three  
seats in Parliament. It was the largest  
single party in the coalition of political  
parties that ousted Indira Gandhi’s  
Congress Party and ended their two  
years of martial law. This triumph quickly turned to failure: the Janata government dissolved over the so-called  
dual-membership controversy, which  
was rooted in concerns over Jana Sangh  
members simultaneously being members of the RSS. Legislators from other  
parties saw this as creating a conflict of  
interest and were also wary of their government being directed by the RSS,  
which was considered a Hindu chauvinist organization. These outside legislators demanded that Jana Sangh members  
renounce all RSS ties, which the latter  
were unwilling to do. All attempts at  
compromise eventually failed, and after  
the Congress Party came back to power  
in 1980, the Jana Sangh legislators and  
other remnants of the Janata government formed a new party, the **Bharatiya**  
**Janata Party**. For further information
