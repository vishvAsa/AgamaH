title = "Jhanki"

+++
(“glimpse”) A momentary “glimpse” of  
the divine, in which the devotee (**bhakta**)  
gains momentary access to the **world of**  
**the gods**. Jhankis are most often conveyed through the performing arts:  
through the mental images created  
when devotional poetry is read, recited,  
or sung, or through the images presented  
in religious **dance**, drama, or film.  
During these momentary encounters,  
the devotee comes briefly into the presence of the **deity**, sharing the deity’s  
world. This stress on the opportunity to  
experience a brief physical presence in  
the deity’s world is particularly strong in  
the **Vaishnava** devotionalism connected  
with the gods **Krishna** and **Rama**.  
**Worship** of these deities often stresses  
visualization of the deity’s life and everyday actions as a way for devotees to gain  
access to that divine world. Devotees of  
both deities have created plays, or **lilas**,  
to aid them in this process: for Rama,  
they are the **Ram Lilas**, which are performed throughout India during the  
autumn festival **season**, and for Krishna,  
they are the Krishna Lilas, performed  
during the annual **monsoon** season in  
**Brindavan**, Krishna’s childhood home.
