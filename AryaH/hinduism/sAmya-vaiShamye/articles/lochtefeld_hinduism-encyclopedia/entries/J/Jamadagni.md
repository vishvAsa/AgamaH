title = "Jamadagni"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a great sage and  
father of **Parashuram avatar**. Like many  
sages, Jamadagni is a man of explosive  
and incendiary temper. In one of the  
most famous episodes, when his wife  
**Renuka** returns home late because  
she has spent some time watching a  
king and his wife sport in the **water**,  
Jamadagni orders his **sons** to kill her. All  
of them refuse except Parashuram, who  
cuts off his mother’s head. Jamadagni is  
pleased with Parashuram and tells him  
to choose whatever reward he wants.  
Parashuram requests that his mother be  
restored to life again, which she is.  
Jamadagni is also famous as the  
owner of a divine **cow** that can provide all sorts of food on demand. The  
local king grows covetous of the cow  
and offers to buy it. When Jamadagni  
refuses to sell her, the king’s men grow  
angry, kill Jamadagni, and take the  
cow back to the palace. It is in retaliation for this heinous act that  
Parashuram attempts to exterminate  
the kingly class (**kshatriyas**) from the  
face of the **earth**.
