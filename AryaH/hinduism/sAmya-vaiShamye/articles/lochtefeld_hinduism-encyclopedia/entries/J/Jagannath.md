(“Master of the Universe”) Presiding  
**deity** of the Jagannath temple in **Puri**.  
Puri is and has long been a major center  
for Hindu culture, a circumstance that  
has underlined and reinforced  
Jagannath’s importance as the city’s  
presiding deity. Although Jagannath is  
identified as a manifestation of the  
god **Krishna**, his roots lie elsewhere.  
He is generally considered to be an  
autochthonous (“of the land”) deity,  
who was originally the local deity of Puri  
but who has been assimilated into the  
wider pantheon as a form of Krishna,  
and therefore, by extension, a form of  
**Vishnu**. This assimilation shows  
Jagannath’s importance and influence  
in the local setting, since he could not  
be simply marginalized. It is also an  
example of the **Vaishnava** tendency  
for such assimilation, most often  
through the doctrine of the **avatars** or  
divine incarnations.  
In the Puri temple and other iconographic representations, Jagannath  
invariably appears as a member of a trio:  
Jagannath (Krishna) appears on the  
right, his brother **Balabhadra**  
(**Balarama**) is on the left, and the smaller figure in the center is their sister  
**Subhadra**. This triadic grouping and the  
depiction of a female figure are very  
308  
Jabali  
unusual in Krishna devotion, as is the  
form of these images, which clearly  
come from a folk or tribal tradition. All  
three deities are made from logs so  
roughly cut that the facial features are  
almost indistinguishable, their arms are  
unnaturally short and stubby, and the  
images are brightly painted. Each of  
these peculiar elements is seen as further evidence of Jagannath’s indigenous  
roots. A final piece of evidence for his  
local origins is seen in his connection  
with his hereditary servants, the **daitas**,  
a tribal people who are considered  
virtually **untouchable**. Despite their  
marginal status in conventional society,  
the daitas are responsible for sculpting  
new images of the trio when they are  
periodically replaced. The daitas also  
consider Jagannath their blood relative,  
further pointing to his ambiguous roots.  
The myth explaining these images is  
based on the virtuous King  
**Indradyumna**. Indradyumna has a  
vision of Vishnu in a **dream**, in which  
Vishnu directs the king to make an  
image of Jagannath from an enormous  
log that he has found. While the king is  
wondering how to do this, a mysterious  
man appears, who is actually  
**Vishvakarma**, the architect of the gods.  
The mysterious man offers to carve the  
statues, on the condition that he will not  
be disturbed until he is finished. He then  
disappears into his workroom for two  
weeks, but the people are mystified by  
what he is doing, since they hear no  
sounds of carving. This seeming inactivity piques the people’s curiosity, and  
finally one of the queens prevails on the  
king to look inside. When the king opens  
the door, he finds no one there, and the  
statues only half-finished. In another  
dream that night, the king is ordered to  
paint and consecrate the statues as they  
are, and this form has reportedly  
remained the same ever since. For further information on the history and  
influence of Jagannath, by far the best  
source is Anncharlott Eschmann,  
Hermann Kulke, and Gaya Charan  
Tripathi, *The Cult of Jagannath and the*  
*Regional Tradition of Orissa*, 1978.
