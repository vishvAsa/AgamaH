title = "Jivanmukta"

+++
In Indian **philosophy**, a person who has  
attained final liberation of the soul while  
still living (**jivanmukti**) and who continues to live in a state of liberation. The  
concept of the jivanmukta is essential in  
many branches of **Advaita Vedanta**, one  
of the **six schools** of classical Indian philosophy. The Advaita school upholds a  
philosophical position known as  
monism, which is the belief that a single  
Ultimate Reality known as **Brahman** lies  
behind all things, and that all things are  
merely differing forms of that reality. For  
Advaita proponents, the problem of  
human bondage is that human beings,  
blinded by **avidya** or mistaken understanding, do not recognize this ultimate  
unity, but mistakenly persist in seeing  
the world as made up of separate and  
diverse things. The possibility of attaining jivanmukta status is essential to the  
Advaita school because it supports their  
belief that bondage and liberation are  
attained not by doing or becoming anything, but rather by replacing a mistaken  
understanding with a correct one. After  
this has happened one will continue  
to live, but because of the radical change  
in consciousness oneâ€™s life will never  
be the same.
