The **sacred thread** worn by all “**twiceborn**” (dvija) men, as a visible symbol of  
having undergone the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the “second  
birth.” The janeu is a circular cord made  
of three strands (in which each cord also  
has three strands), which is worn over  
the left shoulder, crossing the body to  
fall on the right hip. See **sacred thread**.
