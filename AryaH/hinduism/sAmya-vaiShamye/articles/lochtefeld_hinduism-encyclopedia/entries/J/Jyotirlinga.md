(“**linga** of light”) In several different  
mythic sources, the first manifestation  
of the god **Shiva** is described as a giant  
The Mahakaleshvar Temple in the city of Ujjain. This site contains one of the twelve jyotirlingas,  
pillar-shaped images that mark places where the god Shiva is believed to have appeared in a shaft of light.  
pillar of **fire**, which stretches above the  
**heavens** and below the **earth**. The gods  
**Brahma** and **Vishnu** try to find this pillar’s top and bottom but cannot. When  
they admit their failure, the figure of  
Shiva emerges from the pillar of light  
and blesses them. Shiva’s devotees  
(**bhakta**) believe that there are twelve  
sites in India where this jyotirlinga came  
down to earth; these twelve sites are  
deemed extraordinarily holy, and at  
each of them Shiva is believed to be  
uniquely present. At each of these sites  
the primary image is a linga, the pillarshaped image that is a symbolic form of  
Shiva. Each of these lingas is considered  
a different manifestation of Shiva, and  
these twelve sites each take the name of  
the linga that is their presiding **deity**.  
The other eleven manifestations of  
Shiva and their locations are: **Somnath**  
and **Nageshvar** in the state of **Gujarat**;  
**Kedarnath** in the **Himalaya** Mountains;  
**Vishvanath** in the city of **Benares**;  
**Vaidyanath** in the state of **Bihar**;  
**Mahakaleshvar** in the central Indian  
city of **Ujjain**; **Omkareshvar** in the state  
of **Madhya Pradesh**; **Bhimashankar**,  
**Ghrneshvar**, and **Tryambakeshvar** in  
the state of **Maharashtra**; and  
**Rameshvar** in the state of **Tamil Nadu**.
