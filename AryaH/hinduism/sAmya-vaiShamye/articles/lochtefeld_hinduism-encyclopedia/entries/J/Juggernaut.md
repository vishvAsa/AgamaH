title = "Juggernaut"

+++
Anglicized form of **Jagannath**, who is  
the presiding **deity** of the temple with  
the same name in the eastern Indian city  
of **Puri**. The word “juggernaut,” which in  
general English usage refers to anything  
that requires blind devotion or horrible  
**sacrifice**, comes from a widespread  
myth surrounding the procession of  
Jagannath, or Juggernaut, and his two  
siblings around Puri during the **Rath**  
**Yatra** each summer. The cars that carry  
them in the procession are enormous—  
Jagannath’s measures forty-five feet high  
and thirty feet wide, and travels on sixteen wheels that are seven feet high—  
and are drawn by ropes pulled by  
hundreds of people. One of the staple  
fictions of British colonial lore described  
Jagannath’s frenzied devotees (**bhakta**)  
committing **suicide** by throwing themselves under the car’s wheels, in order to  
die in the sight of the god. Despite the  
legendary status of such stories, suicides  
of this sort were in fact extremely  
uncommon: most of those who died  
under the wheels of the Juggernaut procession were pulling the ropes when  
they lost their footing, fell into the cars’  
path, and were prevented from escaping  
by the crushing crowds.
