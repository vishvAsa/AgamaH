A long matted lock of **hair**. Ascetics  
often wear their hair in jatas for a number of religious and symbolic reasons.  
On one level, the uncut hair is a symbol  
of renunciation; its unkempt, matted  
quality demonstrates the **asceticâ€™s**  
distance from worldly concerns with  
order and propriety. On another level,  
ascetics wear jatas in imitation of the  
god **Shiva**, the paradigmatic ascetic,  
who is always portrayed wearing his hair  
in matted locks. Although jatas are most  
commonly worn by devotees (**bhakta**)  
of Shiva, some strict renunciants who  
are devotees of the god **Vishnu** also  
favor this hairstyle. Finally, from a nonreligious perspective, jatas are simply a  
very low-maintenance hairstyle. They  
are usually rubbed with wood ash to  
keep them relatively neat; as the hair  
grows the jatas simply become longer,  
and in many cases they can be neatly  
twisted into a crown, or **jatamakuta**, on  
the top of the head.
