title = "Jaratkaru"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a sage famous not  
only for his **asceticism** and knowledge  
but also because he illustrates the  
importance of male children in Hindu  
culture. Jaratkaru is a lifelong **ascetic**  
with no intention of marrying until he  
has a vision of his ancestors suspended  
over one of the **hells** by a grass rope,  
through which a **rat** (time personified) is  
gradually gnawing. His ancestors inform  
Jaratkaru that his failure to have a **son**  
means that the lineage will end with  
him, along with the rites performed for  
the deceased in that lineage, and that  
they will then fall into hell. To forestall  
this disaster, they instruct Jaratkaru to  
marry and beget a son.  
Jaratkaru is initially hostile to this  
idea, but later specifies that if a woman  
315  
Jaratkaru  
also named Jaratkaru is found and given  
to him as alms, he will marry her. His  
conditions eventually reaches the **Naga**  
(snake) king **Vasuki**, who has a sister by  
this name. The marriage is performed  
under the condition that if she displeases  
Jaratkaru, he will leave her. Given  
Jaratkaru’s ascetic past, it is not surprising that things did not work out between  
them. After being married several  
months, his wife has the dilemma of  
allowing Jaratkaru to sleep past sunset,  
which will make him late for his evening  
prayers, or to wake him and risk his displeasure. She chooses the latter;  
Jaratkaru is displeased with her and  
leaves despite her entreaties. Some time  
later the wife Jaratkaru gives **birth** to a  
son, Astika, and thus the sage’s obligations are fulfilled.
