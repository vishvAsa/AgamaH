title = "Jati"

+++
(“birth”) A traditional social subgroup in  
Indian society. There were hundreds of  
these groups, considered exogamous  
because strict taboos existed against  
marrying outside one’s jati—people  
belonging to different jatis were looked  
upon as different “species” of people.  
Jatis were usually defined by the subgroup’s traditional occupation, which  
they and they alone had the right to  
practice. The jatis were hierarchically  
arranged in society, based on the perceived **purity** or impurity (**ashaucha**) of  
their occupations, and this hierarchy  
formed the basis for the traditional  
Hindu social structure known as the  
**caste** system.
