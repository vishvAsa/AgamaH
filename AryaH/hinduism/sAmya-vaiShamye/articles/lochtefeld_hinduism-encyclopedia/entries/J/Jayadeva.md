title = "Jayadeva"

+++
(12th c.) Poet and author of the  
**Gitagovinda**, a lyric devotional poem  
that uses the separation and eventual  
reunion of the lovers **Krishna** and  
**Radha** as a metaphor for the union of  
the human soul with God. According to  
tradition, Jayadeva lived at the temple of  
the god **Jagannath** in the city of **Puri**,  
where his wife Padmavati was a dancer.  
She is said to have been the first to  
**dance** to Jayadevaâ€™s songs as an **offering**  
to Jagannath, and the *Gitagovinda* has  
been sung and danced as a regular part  
of temple **worship** up to the present  
time. For further information see

*The Love Song of the Dark Lord*, 1977.
