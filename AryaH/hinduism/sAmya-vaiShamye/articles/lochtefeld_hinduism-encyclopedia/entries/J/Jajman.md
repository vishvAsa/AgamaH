title = "Jajman"

+++
Common form of the **Sanskrit** word  
**yajamana**, “patron of the **sacrifice**.”  
From the time of the earliest Vedic sacrifices, there was a sharp distinction  
between the people who performed the  
sacrifice (basically hired technicians)  
and the people who actually paid the  
money to sponsor it and were considered the rite’s true beneficiaries. In contemporary times, *jajman* is the term  
used by **pandas**, the priests at pilgrimage places (**tirtha**), to refer to their pilgrim clients, with whom they have a  
hereditary relationship. This usage  
admits the reality that the pilgrims are  
their patrons, since the priests’ livelihood comes from serving them, but the  
term also carries associations of mutual  
obligation. Pandas are entitled to fees  
from their pilgrim clients but must also  
render services to them, while pilgrims  
are bound to uphold this hereditary  
relationship but can depend on their  
pandas for help.
