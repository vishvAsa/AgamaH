title = "Jallianwala Bagh"

+++
A park (bagh) in the center of the  
northern Indian city of Amritsar at  
which several thousand people were  
killed or wounded in 1919. A crowd had  
gathered at this park despite a strict  
ban on public meetings established the  
day before. The British officer in  
charge, General Dyer, interpreted the  
gathering as willful defiance of the law  
and commanded his men to fire on the  
crowd. This incident was highly significant in the struggle for Indian independence (finally achieved on August 15,  
1947), for it undercut British claims  
that their presence was necessary to  
keep the country from chaos and, in  
the minds of many Indian leaders,  
removed any moral authority by which  
the British could justify their rule.
