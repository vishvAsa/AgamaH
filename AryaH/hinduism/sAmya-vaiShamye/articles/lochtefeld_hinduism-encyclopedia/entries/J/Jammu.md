One of the three distinct cultural areas  
in the modern Indian state of Jammu  
and **Kashmir**; the other two are  
western Kashmir and Ladakh. Jammu  
and Kashmir is a former princely state  
once ruled by the Dogras, a small  
regional dynasty. Although the Dogra  
kings were Hindus, they ruled over  
the **minority** populations of the  
mostly Muslim Kashmiris and the  
mostly Buddhist Ladakhis; this ethnic  
and religious division continues in  
modern times. The Jammu region is  
geographically part of the northern  
Indian plain, and the surrounding  
regions south of the **Shiwalik Hills** are  
Hindu majority regions. However,  
Jammu is also in close proximity to the  
**Punjab**, the center of Sikhism, a  
monotheistic religion that combines  
elements of Hinduism and Islam; consequently Jammu is also home to a significant Sikh population. By far the most  
celebrated shrine in the Jammu region  
is the one dedicated to **Vaishno Devi**,  
a **goddess** who is reputed to grant all  
of one’s wishes. In the eighteenth  
and nineteenth centuries, Jammu was  
also one of the centers for the **Pahari**  
school of **miniature painting**. Aside  
from being the name of this region,  
Jammu is also the name of the region’s  
largest city, the state’s traditional  
winter capital. For general information  
about Jammu and all the regions of  
India, an accessible reference is
