(4th c. B.C.E.?) Figure traditionally cited  
as the author of the **Mimamsa Sutras**,  
the central texts of the **Purva Mimamsa**  
school, one of the **six schools** of Indian  
**philosophy**. The Mimamsa school is  
most concerned with the examination  
and pursuit of **dharma** (“righteous  
action”). In their pursuit of dharma,  
the Mimamsa also believed that all  
necessary instructions were contained  
in the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious  
texts. Given these twin assumptions,  
much of Mimamsa thought is devoted to  
the principles and methods of textual  
interpretation used to unlock the  
instructions that they were confident  
the Vedas contained.
