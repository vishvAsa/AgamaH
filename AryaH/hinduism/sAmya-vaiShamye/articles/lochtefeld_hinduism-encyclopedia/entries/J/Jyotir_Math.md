title = "Jyotir Math"

+++
One of the four maths or sacred centers  
traditionally believed to have been  
established by the great philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**; the others are the  
**Sharada math**, **Shringeri math**, and  
**Govardhan math**. These four sacred  
centers are each associated with one of  
the four geographical corners of the  
Indian subcontinent; the Jyotir math is  
in the northern quarter, in the town of  
**Joshimath** in the state of **Uttar Pradesh**,  
high in the Himalaya Mountains.  
Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as  
the founder of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
the most prestigious Hindu **ascetic**  
order. The Dashanami (“ten names”)  
ascetics are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva** and are separated into ten divisions, each with a different name. These  
ten divisions are organized into four  
larger groups—**Anandawara**, **Bhogawara**,  
**Bhuriwara**, and **Kitawara**—each of which  
has two or three of the ten divisions, and  
each of which is associated with one of the  
four sacred centers. Of these, the Jyotir  
math is associated with the Anandawara  
group of the Dashanamis.
