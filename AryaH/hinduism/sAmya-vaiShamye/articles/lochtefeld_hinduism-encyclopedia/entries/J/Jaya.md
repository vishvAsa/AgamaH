In Hindu mythology, one of the gatekeepers of the god **Vishnu’s** heavenly  
abode, **Vaikuntha**, who, with his brother  
**Vijaya**, is cursed to be born three times  
as a **demon** (asura) and to be killed each  
time by Vishnu. The sage **Sanaka** places  
this **curse** on them when they prevent  
him from seeing Vishnu. In their first  
**birth** the two are born as **Hiranyaksha**  
and **Hiranyakashipu**, who are killed by  
the **Boar avatar** and the **Man-Lion**  
**avatar** respectively. In their second  
incarnation they are born as **Ravana**  
and **Kumbhakarna**, who are both killed  
by Vishnu’s **Rama avatar**. In their final  
birth they incarnate as **Shisupala** and  
**Dantavaktra** and are killed by Vishnu’s  
**Krishna avatar**. After the conditions of  
the curse have been fulfilled, they return  
to their duties as Vishnu’s gatekeepers.
