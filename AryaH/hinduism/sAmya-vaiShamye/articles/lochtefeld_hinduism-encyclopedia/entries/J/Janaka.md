title = "Janaka"

+++
The foster father of the **goddess Sita**. He  
discovered her one day while plowing a  
furrow in a field. In Hindu mythology,  
Janaka is the paradigm of the sage-king,  
a person who despite his wealth and  
position was as perfectly dispassionate  
as any **ascetic** living in the forest.
