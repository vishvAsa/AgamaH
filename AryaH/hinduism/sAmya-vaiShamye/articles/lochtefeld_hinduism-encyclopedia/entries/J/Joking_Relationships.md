title = "Joking Relationships"

+++
Within the traditional Hindu joint family,  
the types of relationships within a single  
generation differ markedly according to  
family status, particularly among the  
family’s adult brothers and their wives.  
As the eventual head of the family, the  
oldest brother is usually portrayed as a  
serious and grave authority figure,  
toward whom everyone must act with  
respect. The eldest brother’s wife is also  
given considerable respect, but she is  
also said to share a “joking relationship”  
with her husband’s younger brothers, as  
do all wives with their husband’s  
younger brothers. Whereas **women** are  
expected to behave decorously toward  
relatives with higher status, joking relationships have much greater freedom of  
expression. These are usually characterized as full of banter and casual conversation that would be inappropriate with  
a person of higher status.
