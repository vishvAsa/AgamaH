title = "Jayapala"

+++
(d. 1001) One of the last kings of the  
**Pratiharas**, a northern Indian dynasty  
whose capital was in **Kanyakubja** on the  
**Ganges** River. By Jayapala’s time the  
divided Hindu kingdoms in northern  
India were being threatened by the  
Turkish emirs, especially **Mahmud of**  
**Ghazni**, who had settled in modern-day  
Afghanistan. Jayapala was defeated and  
captured in battle with Mahmud and  
subsequently committed **suicide**; a  
short time later, Jayapala’s **son**  
**Anandapala** suffered a crushing defeat,  
leaving a nearly complete collapse of  
power in northern India. Because of this  
absence of any effective opposition,  
Mahmud was able to indulge in almost  
yearly campaigns of pillage and plunder.
