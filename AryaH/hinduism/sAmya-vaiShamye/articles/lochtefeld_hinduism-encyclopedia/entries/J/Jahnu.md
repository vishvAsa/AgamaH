title = "Jahnu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, an **ascetic** who has  
amassed great power by performing  
harsh physical **asceticism** (**tapas**). One  
day while Jahnu is deep in meditation,  
his belongings are picked up and carried  
away by the river **Ganges** (believed by  
Hindus to be the physical form of the  
**goddess Ganga**), who has recently come  
down from **heaven** and is being led to  
the sea by the sage **Bhagirath**. Jahnu is  
enraged at this disrespect; to punish  
Ganga, he drinks all of the **water** in the  
river. When the gods realize what has  
happened, they are very concerned.  
They somehow manage to placate  
Jahnu, and the sage agrees to release  
her. The problem then is how to release  
the Ganges in a way that will not defile  
her, since vomiting her up or voiding her  
as urine are both unacceptable. In the  
end, Jahnu bypasses this dilemma by  
releasing her through his ear. She continues on her way to the sea and  
acquires the name **Jahnavi** by virtue of  
being “born” from Jahnu.
