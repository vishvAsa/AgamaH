title = "Japa"

+++
(“muttering,” “whispering”) Individual  
recitation, usually the repeated utterance of a particular **mantra** or divine  
name(s), often while using a string of  
beads (**mala**) to perform a definite number of such repetitions. Such recitation  
is usually performed as an individual  
religious act, in a tone of voice audible  
to the reciter but not others who may be  
present. Japa is a particularly important  
practice in Hindu traditions stressing  
the benefits of reciting the divine  
name—such repetitions are believed to  
have gradual spiritual benefits. Japa is  
particularly stressed in the **Gaudiya**  
**Vaishnavas** community founded by the  
Bengali saint **Chaitanya**, where public  
recitation of the divine name is an  
important part of religious life.
