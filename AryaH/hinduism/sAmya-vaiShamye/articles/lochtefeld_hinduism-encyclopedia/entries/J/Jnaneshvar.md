title = "Jnaneshvar"

+++
(1275–1296?) Poet and saint who is the  
first great figure in the **Varkari Panth**, a  
religious community centered around  
the **worship** of the Hindu god **Vithoba**  
at his temple at **Pandharpur** in the  
modern state of **Maharashtra**.  
According to tradition, Jnaneshvar was  
an outcaste **brahmin**. He incurred this  
penalty because his father was a lapsed  
**ascetic**—he left his wife to become an  
ascetic, only to rejoin his family at his  
**guru’s** command. Jnaneshvar came  
from a very religious family: His sister  
**Muktibai** is revered by the Varkaris in  
her own right, and his elder brother  
**Nivrttinath** is supposed to have been a  
“spiritual grandson” of the great ascetic  
**Gorakhnath**. Varkari tradition makes  
clear that Jnaneshvar lived much of his  
life in the town of **Alandi**, but the truth  
of the accounts of many events associated  
with his life is questionable—for example, he is said to have caused a buffalo to  
321  
Jnaneshvar  
recite the sacred text known as the **Veda**  
in order to humble the pride of the local  
**brahmin** priests. Jnaneshvar’s greatest  
work was the **Jnaneshvari**, a Marathilanguage commentary on the **Bhagavad**  
**Gita**, one of the most influential Hindu  
religious texts. He is also famous for his  
songs in praise of Vithoba, which the  
Varkaris still sing today. For further  
information see G. A. Deleury, *The Cult*  
*of Vithoba*, 1960; and Justin Abbott and
