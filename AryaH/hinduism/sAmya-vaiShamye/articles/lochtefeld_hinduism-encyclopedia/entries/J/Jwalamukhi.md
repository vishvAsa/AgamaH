(“flame mouth”) Presiding **deity** of the  
Jwalamukhi shrine in the state of  
**Himachal Pradesh**, and one of the nine  
**Shiwalik goddesses**. According to the site’s  
mythic charter, Jwalamukhi is one of the  
**Shakti Pithas**, a network of sites sacred to  
the **goddess** that spreads throughout the  
Indian subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha  
marks the site where a body part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth**, taking form there as a different goddess; in the  
case of Jwalamukhi the body part was Sati’s  
tongue. The human tongue is an extremely powerful part of the body—connected  
with speech, **eating**, and sex—and thus  
Jwalamukhi is considered a very powerful  
shrine. The cave containing the shrine has  
a small vent of natural gas, which has been  
lit for as long as people can remember. This  
flame is believed to be a self-manifested  
(**svayambhu**) form of the Goddess, here in  
the form of her tongue. For further information see David R. Kinsley, *Hindu*  
*Goddesses*, 1986; and Kathleen Erndl,  
*Victory To The Mother*, 1993. See also **pitha**.
