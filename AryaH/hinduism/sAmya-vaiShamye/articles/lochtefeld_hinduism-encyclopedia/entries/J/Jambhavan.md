title = "Jambhavan"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, Jambhavan  
is one of the ministers of **Sugriva**,  
king of the monkeys. Jambhavan is  
generally described as a bear, although  
in some sources he is said to be a monkey. In the search for **Rama’s**  
kidnapped wife **Sita**, it is Jambhavan  
who convinces the monkey-god  
**Hanuman** to attempt to jump over the  
ocean to **Lanka**, reminding Hanuman of  
his **birth**, deeds, and the divine boons  
he has been given. Although at first  
Hanuman doubts his ability, he is convinced by Jambhavan’s encouragement  
and, with a mighty spring, leaps over the  
sea to Lanka, where he eventually discovers Sita.
