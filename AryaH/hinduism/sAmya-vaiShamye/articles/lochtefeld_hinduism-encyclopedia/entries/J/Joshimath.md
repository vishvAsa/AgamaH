title = "Joshimath"

+++
Town and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Himalayas** on the banks of the  
**Alakananda River**, in the Chamoli  
district of the state of **Uttar Pradesh**.  
Joshimath is the location of the **Jyotir**  
**math**, one of the four **maths**, or  
dwelling places for **ascetics**, supposedly  
established by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. The Jyotir math is  
home to **Dashanami Sanyasis**, or **twiceborn** renunciant ascetics. According to  
local legend, the Jyotir Math is the place  
where Shankaracharya attained the ultimate realization and composed his  
commentaries on the Hindu scriptures.  
Aside from the Jyotir math, Joshimath is  
famous for its connection to a temple  
dedicated to Narasimha, the god  
**Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar**. This temple  
was also reportedly established by  
Shankaracharya and contains several  
stunning sculptural images. Joshimath  
is an important transit point on the  
road to the temple at **Badrinath**, and  
it is also the winter seat of Badrinath’s  
presiding **deity**, where he (symbolically  
represented by a traveling image)  
resides and is worshiped during the  
winter months, when Badrinath  
becomes snowbound and inaccessible.
