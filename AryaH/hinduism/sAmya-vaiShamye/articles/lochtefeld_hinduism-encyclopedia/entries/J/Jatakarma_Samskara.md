title = "Jatakarma Samskara"

+++
The fourth of the traditional life-cycle  
ceremonies (**samskaras**). The first three  
were to be performed before and during  
**pregnancy**, while the jatakarma samskara was to be performed immediately  
after the **birth**. This ceremony had several elements, but the most prominent  
were uttering the word “vak” (“speech,”  
a synonym for **Saraswati**) into the  
child’s ear and feeding the child honey,  
ghee, and other items believed to bring  
good luck. This samskara is seldom performed in modern times, although there  
are many other rites connected with  
birth that are intended to protect the  
mother and child and to kindle the  
child’s potential.
