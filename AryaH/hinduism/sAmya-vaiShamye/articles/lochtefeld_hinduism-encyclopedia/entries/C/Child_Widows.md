title = "Child Widows"

+++
This term refers to girls who had been  
married as children and whose husbands (whether older men or boys their  
own age) died before the girls reached  
puberty and the marriage had been consummated. Although the lives of such  
child widows varied according to the  
status of their families, their lives were  
often quite grim, given the traditional  
prohibitions on widow remarriage and  
the strict behavioral codes mandated for  
widows. Reformers in the nineteenth  
century, such as **Ram Mohan Roy**,  
championed the drive to promote  
societal acceptance of second marriages  
for child widows. Due to the sharp  
decline in the frequency of **child marriages**, child widows are extremely  
uncommon in modern times. See also  
**marriage prohibitions**.
