One of the six **Vedangas**. These were the  
auxiliary branches of knowledge intended  
to facilitate the use of the **Vedas**, the  
oldest Hindu religious texts. Chandas  
was concerned with the study of metrical forms and verse, which were central  
to the composition of the Vedas. One  
indication of the importance of **meter** is  
that in many sources (such as in **Paniniâ€™s**  
grammar, the **Ashtadhyayi**) the word  
*chandas* is used to designate the Vedas  
themselves. Aside from chandas, the  
other Vedangas are **shiksha** (correct pronunciation), **vyakarana** (**Sanskrit** grammar), **kalpa** (ritual instructions),  
**nirukta** (etymology), and **jyotisha** (auspicious times for sacrifices).
