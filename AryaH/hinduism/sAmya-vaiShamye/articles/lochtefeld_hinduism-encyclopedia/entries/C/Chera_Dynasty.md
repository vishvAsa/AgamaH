Hindu dynasty that ruled much of the  
modern state of **Kerala** from the second  
century B.C.E. to the eighth century C.E.  
The Cheras were in continual conflict  
with the **Pandyas** and the Cholas, the  
two other dynasties in the deep south,  
and were eventually absorbed when the  
Cholas gained control in the ninth century C.E. See also **Chola dynasty**.
