title = "Chandra Gupta II"

+++
(r. 376â€“415 C.E.) Third in the line of great  
monarchs in the **Gupta dynasty**, after  
his father, **Samudra Gupta**, and his  
grandfather, **Chandra Gupta I**. The  
Gupta dynasty reached its territorial  
peak under Chandra Gupta II. During  
his reign the Shaka kingdom of the  
**Malwa** region was finally conquered,  
after which the Guptas controlled by  
conquest or tribute all of northern India  
and modern Pakistan, as well as the  
**Coromandel** Coast all the way to modern Madras. The Gupta dynasty flourished between about 350 and 550 C.E.,  
and its reign is associated with the  
development of Indian culture and a  
revival of Hinduism in northern India.  
Both were accomplished through the  
patronage of the Gupta kings, who are  
remembered both as patrons of high  
culture and ardent devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**. This is especially true of Chandra  
Gupta II, since one of the major figures  
associated with his court is **Kalidasa**,  
considered the greatest of the **Sanskrit**  
poets. See also **Shaka era**.
