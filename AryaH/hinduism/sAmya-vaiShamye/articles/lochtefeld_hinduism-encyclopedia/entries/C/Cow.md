title = "Cow"

+++
Animal revered by almost all modern  
Hindus, although there is one small  
Hindu community in the state of **Kerala**  
that eats beef. Aside from this anomaly,  
reverence for the cow is one of the few  
unifying beliefs for almost all Hindu  
communities. Demands for a complete  
ban on **cow slaughter** have become a  
time-honored way for political groups to  
generate support from the orthodox  
Hindu community, although these  
demands carry far more weight in  
northern India, where a significant  
Muslim **minority** has few scruples  
about slaughtering and **eating** beef.  
Organized calls for such a ban began as  
early as the 1880s with the growth of  
tension between the Hindu and Muslim  
communities. This sentiment, generally  
called the **Cow Protection Movement**,  
has continued to the present day.  
Demands for a complete ban on cow  
slaughter have regularly surfaced since  
1947, when India gained independence,  
and this is one of the loaded causes of  
Indian political life. Reverence for the  
cow goes to such lengths that one of the  
charitable acts performed by pious  
Hindus is to contribute to **goshalas**,  
institutions for old and infirm cows.  
There is considerable speculation  
and some disagreement about the  
source of these feelings about the cow.  
Some arguments have stressed the cow’s  
value in an agricultural society, as a  
source of both draft **animals** and reproducible wealth. Other arguments have  
stressed the cow’s ability to transform  
agricultural waste into milk products  
and dung, a common fuel in much of  
northern India. Still others have noted  
the way that feelings about the cow are  
imbued with the symbolism of motherhood, since both are said to provide  
milk for a child’s nourishment. This last  
point is probably the most important,  
since it is very clear that conservative  
Hindu feelings for the cow are based primarily on high emotional content rather  
than on rational considerations of costs  
and benefits.
