title = "Chaitra"

According to the lunar **calendar**, by  
which most Hindu religious festivals are  
determined, Chaitra is the month in  
which the lunar **year** both begins (during the two weeks of the bright or waxing, half of the **moon**) and ends (during  
the two weeks of the dark, or waning,  
half of the moon, which precedes the  
bright half). Thus, the waning half of  
Chaitra ends one lunar year, while the  
waxing half that follows it begins the  
next lunar year. This month usually falls  
within March and April. This is one of  
the months of spring, and in northern  
India the weather is warm and pleasant  
at this time. The major festivals in  
Chaitra are **Papamochani Ekadashi**, the  
spring **Navaratri**, **Ram Navami**,  
**Kamada Ekadashi**, **Hanuman Jayanti**,  
and in **Tamil Nadu**, the **Chittirai** festival.
