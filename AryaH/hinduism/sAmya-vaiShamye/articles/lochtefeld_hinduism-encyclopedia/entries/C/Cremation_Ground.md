title = "Cremation Ground"

+++
Literally a place where bodies are cremated, but in Hindu culture it also has a  
significant symbolic meaning. The cremation ground is pervaded by associations with death and impurity  
(**ashaucha**), making it an intensely  
inauspicious place that is often believed  
to be inhabited by malevolent wandering spirits. The cremation ground is usually located at the boundary of a  
community, both to remove any contact  
with this source of **inauspiciousness**  
from everyday life and perhaps to symbolically deny the reality of death by relegating the cremation ground to the  
margins of the “settled” world.  
One well-known exception to this  
rule occurs in **Benares**, where the cremation ground at **Manikarnika Ghat** is  
in the middle of the city. This prominence symbolically forces the inhabitants to confront the reality of death, but  
since Benares is also the home of the  
god **Shiva**, it also raises the hope that  
death will bring final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**). Similarly, although most  
people avoid the cremation ground as  
inauspicious, certain religious adepts  
voluntarily choose it as their place of  
residence and religious practice. This  
may include certain types of **ascetics**  
who are simply emulating terrifying  
forms of Shiva who are said to reside in  
cremation grounds. Practitioners of the  
esoteric ritual tradition known as **tantra**  
may live in a cremation ground to assert  
the radical unity of all reality and transcend the concepts of **purity** and impurity, which they consider artificial. See  
also **cremation**.
