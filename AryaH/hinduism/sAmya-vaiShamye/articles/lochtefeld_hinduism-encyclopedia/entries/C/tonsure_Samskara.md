title = "(“tonsure”) Samskara"

+++
The eighth of the traditional life cycle  
ceremonies (**samskaras**). In the chudakarana samskara, the **hair** is shaved  
off of the child’s head, although frequently a tuft of hair (chuda) is left. This  
is the last of the childhood samskaras,  
marking the ritual end of infancy, and it  
is still often performed in modern India,  
particularly by **brahmin** families. The  
timing for this rite is usually determined  
by **family custom** (**kulachara**), although  
in many cases it is performed when the  
child’s age is an odd number (most commonly at one, three, or five years old).  
Since most Indian babies are born with  
hair, and hair is commonly believed to  
trap impurities, the chudakarana is seen  
as a rite of purification where the last of  
the residual impurities from childbirth  
are removed. As in many other cultures,  
this cut-off hair is believed to retain a  
powerful connection with the child.  
Traditional belief holds that in the  
wrong hands, this hair could be used to  
work black **magic** against the child.  
Given this concern, the hair is usually  
carefully gathered and disposed of, most  
often by putting it into running **water**.
