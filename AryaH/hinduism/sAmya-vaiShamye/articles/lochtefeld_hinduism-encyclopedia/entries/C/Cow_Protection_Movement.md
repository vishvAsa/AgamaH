title = "Cow Protection Movement"

+++
General term for a grassroots conservative Hindu effort to ban the slaughter of  
cattle, particularly the **cow**. The traditional Hindu devotion to the cow has  
been articulated in calls for a ban on  
**cow slaughter** for more than a century.  
The call was first raised in 1875 by  
**Swami Dayanand Saraswati**, the  
founder of the reformist **Arya Samaj**. It  
continued to be a basic demand of later  
conservative Hindu-oriented groups,  
including the **Hindu Mahasabha**,  
the **Ram Rajya Parishad**, and the  
**Vishva Hindu Parishad**. The call for this  
ban occasionally surfaces even in  
contemporary times, since it carries  
strong support from many religiously  
conservative Hindus.  
The cow protection demand continues to have profound political implications. Swami Dayanand Saraswati’s  
work in the late nineteenth century  
coincided with the awakening of Indian  
political consciousness and the beginnings of the struggle to regain power  
from British imperial rule. Under British  
power, overt political dissent was subject  
to heavy government restrictions, and  
outright rebellion was impossible. Since  
the British did not generally interfere  
with “religious” issues, the demand for a  
ban on cow slaughter was a way for  
Hindus to assert and define their identity  
and by implication affirm that India was  
a Hindu land.  
The Cow Protection Movement also  
caused friction between the Hindu and  
Muslim communities, since Hindus  
158  
**worship** cows, whereas Muslims eat  
them. Hindus saw Muslim beef consumption as a flagrant violation of their  
religious sensibilities, and Muslims saw  
the demand for a ban on cow slaughter  
as a thinly veiled attempt to reinforce  
Muslim status as second-class citizens.  
Communal relations were often particularly volatile around the annual Muslim  
festival of Id, at which it is traditional for  
each family to **sacrifice** an **animal** and  
in which many of the more affluent  
Muslim families would sacrifice cattle.  
As the relationship between these two  
communities deteriorated in the 1930s,  
cow slaughter (or rumor thereof) was  
often cited as the spark for communal  
riots in which hundreds of people  
were killed.  

This tension persists in modern  
India, although it has rarely erupted into  
violence since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. Modern India was  
founded as a secular state where the  
government does not favor any particular religious community. This founding  
ethos has made the Indian government  
reluctant to pass legislation banning  
cattle slaughter, despite continued calls  
from traditional Hindus. The Indian  
Muslim community, facing the reality of  
its **minority** status in a Hindu majority  
state, has had to be far more discreet  
about when and how such cow slaughter takes place.
