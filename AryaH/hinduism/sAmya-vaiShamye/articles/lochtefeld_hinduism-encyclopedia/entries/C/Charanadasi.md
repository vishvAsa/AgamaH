title = "Charanadasi"

+++
**Vaishnava ascetic** sect founded by the  
reformer-saint **Charanadas** (1733–1782  
C.E.). Charanadas formed his own community as a protest against the corruption of the **Pushti Marg**, the religious  
community founded by **Vallabhacharya**  
(1479–1531 C.E.) whose members are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna**.  
Like the Pushti Marg, the Charanadasis  
are Vaishnavas, but their patron **deity** is  
not Krishna alone, but also his consort,  
**Radha**. The Charanadasis have stressed  
both learning and an upright way of  
life. Their main center is in Delhi, as is  
the **samadhi shrine** of Charanadas,  
their founder.
