title = "Chanda"

+++
A **demon** general killed by the **Goddess**  
in the **Devimahatmya**, the **Sanskrit** text  
that is the earliest and most important  
mythic source for the cult of the  
Goddess. This text describes the  
Goddess in several different manifestations. The seventh book tells how the  
goddess **Ambikaâ€™s** anger takes form as  
the terrifying goddess **Kali**. Kali attacks  
the demon armies commanded by  
Chanda and his companion **Munda**,  
and after destroying the armies she  
139  
Chanda  
beheads the two generals. As a memorial  
of this mythic deed, one of the names  
under which the Goddess is worshiped  
is **Chamunda**, as the slayer of Chanda  
and Munda.
