title = "Chandra Gupta I"

+++
(r. 320–35 C.E.) Founder of the **Gupta**  
**dynasty**, which like the **Maurya dynasty**  
had its capital in **Pataliputra**, identified  
with the modern city of Patna in the  
state of **Bihar**. The Gupta capital was  
later moved to **Allahabad**. At the height  
of the dynasty, under **Chandra Gupta II**  
(r. 376–415), the Guptas controlled all of  
northern India and modern Pakistan, as  
well as the **Coromandel** Coast all the  
way to modern Madras. The Gupta  
dynasty flourished between about 350  
and 550 C.E., and its reign is associated  
with the development of Indian culture  
and a revival of Hinduism in northern  
India. Both were accomplished through  
the patronage of the Gupta kings, who  
are remembered both as patrons of high  
culture and ardent devotees (**bhakta**)  
of **Shiva**.
