(“foot nectar”) Literally, the **water** (or  
other liquid) in which the feet of one’s  
**guru** or images of a **deity** are bathed.  
The disciple or devotee (**bhakta**) consumes it as a sign of subordinate status  
and as a way to receive **grace** and blessings. By extension, the word can refer to  
any liquid for devotees to consume as a  
symbol of the deity’s grace, whether or  
not it has been used for bathing (**snana**).
