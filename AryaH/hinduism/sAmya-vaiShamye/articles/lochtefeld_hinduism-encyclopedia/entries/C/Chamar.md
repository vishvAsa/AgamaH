title = "Chamar"

+++
In traditional northern Indian society,  
the chamars were a **jati** (“birth”) whose  
hereditary occupation was tanning  
**leather** and making shoes. The jatis  
were subgroups of traditional Indian  
society whose social status was determined by their hereditary occupation.  
The chamars were traditionally considered among the lowest of the untouchables since their work brought them in  
continual contact with dead **animals**  
and their skins, which are considered  
extremely impure. The most famous  
chamar is the poet-saint **Ravidas**, whose  
poetry focuses on the difference  
between worldly status and devotion.
