title = "Chaitanya"

+++
(1486–1533 C.E.) Bengali saint, devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna**, and the  
founder of the **Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious community. Chaitanya was such a  
pivotal figure that there are many traditional sources for his life, although their  
hagiographic character makes them historically unreliable. According to one of  
these traditions, Chaitanya embodied  
Krishna himself. Krishna became  
Chaitanya to experience the longing of  
**Radha**, his beloved consort whom  
Chaitanya imagined himself to be. Thus,  
for his followers Chaitanya was conceived as Krishna and Radha in the  
same body.  
Chaitanya was born in the town of  
**Navadvip** in the state of **West Bengal**  
and given the name Vishvambar.  
Traditional sources portray the young  
man as a gifted teacher but with no  
inclination toward Krishna. In 1508 he  
went to **Gaya**, a sacred site (**tirtha**) associated with rites for the dead, to perform  
rites for his dead father. In Gaya,  
Vishvambar met his teacher, **Ishvara**  
**Puri**, and something profound happened there, for he returned to  
Navadvip a passionate devotee of  
Krishna. On his return, Vishvambar  
began to hold the public **kirtan** (devotional chanting) that has become the  
hallmark of the Gaudiya Vaishnava  
school. Devotees sang and danced in the  
streets and wept uncontrollably.  
Through this ecstatic emotional **worship**, they sought to regain the devotional  
atmosphere associated with the **gopis**,  
Krishna’s cowherd **women**, and thus  
135  
Chaitanya  
share in the gopis’ intimate relationship  
with Krishna.  
In 1510 Vishvambar formally became  
an **ascetic**, taking the name Krishna  
Chaitanya, and for the rest of his life  
propagated the worship of Krishna. For  
much of that time, he resided in the  
sacred city of **Puri**. This was reportedly  
in deference to his mother, since she felt  
that Krishna’s childhood home,  
**Brindavan**, was too far away. Despite his  
mother’s wishes, Chaitanya did take several lengthy trips: a two-year tour of the  
holy places in southern India between  
1510 and 1512, and in 1514, a trip to  
Brindavan, in which Chaitanya had frequent mystical experiences. After his  
return to Puri, he met the brothers **Rupa**  
and **Sanatana Goswami**. Chaitanya  
directed them to settle in Brindavan and  
re-establish the holy sites associated  
with Krishna’s life. Driven by Chaitanya’s  
charisma and ecstatic devotion, Rupa,  
Sanatana, and their nephew **Jiva**  
**Goswami** became pivotal figures in the  
development of the Gaudiya Vaishnava  
school. While Chaitanya was absorbed  
in his devotion to Krishna until his  
death, Rupa, Santana, and Jiva Goswami  
gave this devotion a systematic organization. For further information see
