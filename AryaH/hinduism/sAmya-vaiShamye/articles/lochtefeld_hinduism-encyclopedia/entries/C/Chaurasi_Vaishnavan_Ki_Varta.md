(“account of eighty-four Vaishnavas”)  
Sectarian hagiography supposedly composed by **Gokulnath**, the third **guru** of  
the **Pushti Marg**, a religious community  
of **Krishna** devotees (**bhakta**) founded  
by the philosopher **Vallabhacharya**  
(1479–1531). It is more likely that the  
text was written by Gokulnath’s disciple  
**Hariray**, who also wrote a commentary  
on the work. The text describes the lives  
of eighty-four paradigmatic **Vaishnavas**,  
all of whom were allegedly associated  
with the sect’s first two gurus,  
**Vallabhacharya** and **Vitthalnath**. The  
text’s primary purpose is to illustrate  
the importance of the Pushti Marg,  
particularly the importance of the  
Pushti Marg’s leaders on these eightyfour religious figures. This makes it an  
interesting sectarian work, but it is not  
historically reliable.
