title = "Chandramati"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the long-suffering  
wife of King **Harishchandra**. Harishchandra is famous for his truthfulness  
and integrity; in modern Hindu culture  
he is also the paradigm for a person  
who patiently endures undeserved suffering. Harishchandra’s suffering grows  
out of the competition between the  
sages **Vasishtha** and **Vishvamitra**. As his  
family priest, Vasishtha praises Harishchandra’s virtue. Vishvamitra is determined to prove Vasishtha wrong and  
subjects Harishchandra to a series of  
trials in which he loses his kingdom, his  
**possessions**, and has to sell himself and  
his family into slavery. Through all of  
the trials he and Chandramati have to  
suffer, Harishchandra retains his integrity.  
After enduring many hardships, including the death of their only **son**, they are  
eventually restored to their original  
happy state, including the resuscitation  
of their son.
