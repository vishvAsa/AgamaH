Name for hashish. This is usually mixed  
with tobacco and smoked in a straight  
pipe called a **chillum**. Smoking hashish  
is typical in certain segments of the  
**ascetic** community. For many ascetics,  
smoking is a social activity and a rite of  
hospitality as well as a religious act that  
emulates the god **Shiva**, whose love for  
the **drug** is well known. In their travels  
many ascetics process the marijuana  
that grows wild throughout the  
**Himalayas** into hashish to use and sell.  
Drug use is forbidden for most people,  
but among ascetics—who are deliberately marginal members of society—it is  
a fairly common and tolerated behavior.
