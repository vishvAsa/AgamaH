Hindu culture has no single cosmology  
but rather several different systems,  
each of which is well established in its  
own right. The oldest model appears in  
the **Rg Veda** (10.90), the oldest Hindu  
religious text, and is known as the  
**Purusha Sukta** (“Hymn to the Primeval  
Man”). This hymn describes the **creation** of the world and all living beings  
as the result of the **sacrifice** of the  
primeval man (purusha). Different parts  
of his body become different parts of the  
physical universe and the traditional  
social groups. Another Vedic metaphor  
is that of the **Golden Embryo**, which is  
the only existing thing until it develops  
into **Prajapati**, the creator of the universe. A third version, that of the **Cosmic**  
**Egg**, is found in the later religious texts  
known as the **puranas**, which are compilations of mythology and lore.  
According to this image, the entire universe is originally contained in the  
Cosmic Egg. Once it is broken, the egg’s  
constituent parts (shell, white, yolk, and  
membranes) become all of the things of  
the **earth**. The final cosmological image  
from the puranas, and perhaps the most  
common, begins with the god **Vishnu**  
floating in the sea of cosmic dissolution  
(**pralaya**), lying on the back of his serpent

couch, **Shesha**. When the time for creation comes, a lotus sprouts from  
Vishnu’s navel and opens to reveal the  
god **Brahma**, who begins the process of  
creation. This process reverses at the  
onset of the cosmic dissolution, with  
Brahma being reabsorbed into Vishnu’s  
body. Despite their differing symbols, all  
of these models share the conviction  
that the universe has come from a single  
source and thus that the entire cosmos  
is an organic whole.  
Although there are many models for  
the origin of the cosmos, there is wider  
agreement about its geography. The universe is generally considered to have  
three tiers, and each of these tiers can  
have multiple levels. The visible world is  
considered the middle tier, sandwiched  
between the **heavens** of the upper world  
(often numbered as seven) and the  
realms of the underworld. Some of the  
latter are **hells**, whereas some of these  
lower worlds are simply considered to  
be alternate realms of existence. The visible world is often described as a series  
of concentric landmasses (**dvipas**) separated from each other by seven oceans  
(the **saptasindhu**), each composed of a  
different substance. The innermost of  
these landmasses is **Jambudvipa**, whose  
center is the mythical Mount **Meru**,  
often identified with Mount **Kailas** in  
the **Himalayas**. In traditional cosmology  
Mount Meru stands at the center of the  
universe and is compared to the central  
calyx of a lotus. Mount Meru is surrounded by mountain ranges, with a different region in each of the cardinal  
directions. The region south of Mount  
Meru is the land known as **Bharata**, the  
traditional name for the Indian subcontinent. Bharata is said to be superior to  
the other three regions of Jambudvipa  
because only in Bharata are religious rituals correctly performed. In its mythic  
geography, therefore, India is considered the center of the universe and the  
best possible place to live to pursue religious life. For further information see
