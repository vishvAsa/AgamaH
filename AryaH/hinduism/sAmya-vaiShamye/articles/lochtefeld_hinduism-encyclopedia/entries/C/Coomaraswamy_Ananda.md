title = "Coomaraswamy, Ananda"

+++
(1877–1947) Intellectual and art historian who was one of the first Indian scholars to address a predominantly Western  
audience. He was born in modern **Sri**  
**Lanka**, the son of a Hindu father and an  
English mother. Although he was  
trained as a geologist, by 1910 he had  
found his true vocation, the study of art.  
Coomaraswamy was largely responsible  
for publicizing Hindu **miniature painting** as a genre distinct from the contemporary Muslim court painting. Due to  
the strength of this and other interpretive scholarly works, he became curator  
of Indian and Muslim art at the Museum  
of Fine Arts in Boston. He held this post  
from 1917 to 1931, and his catalog of the  
museum’s collection shows painstaking  
and objective scholarship. In his later  
years, he began to publish works on aesthetics, myth, religion, and culture,  
focusing not only on India but also on  
traditional Europe.
