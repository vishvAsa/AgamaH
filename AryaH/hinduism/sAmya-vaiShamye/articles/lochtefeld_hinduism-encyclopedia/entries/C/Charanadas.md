(“slave of [God’s] feet”; 1733–1782 C.E.)  
Founder of the **Charanadasis**, an **ascetic**  
religious community. Charanadas was  
born in the town of Dehra in the princely state of Alwar (in the modern state of  
**Rajasthan**). The Charanadasis are also  
known as the Shuka Sampraday because,  
according to tradition, Charanadas  
received **initiation** from the puranic  
sage **Shuka**. Charanadas formed his  
community in protest against the corruption and worldliness of the **Pushti**  
**Marg**, the religious community founded  
by **Vallabhacharya** (1479–1531 C.E.),  
whose members are devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Krishna**. Like the Pushti  
Marg, the Charanadasis are **Vaishnavas**,  
but their patron **deity** is not Krishna  
alone but also his consort, **Radha**.  
Charanadas countered the Pushti Marg  
by stressing upright and appropriate  
behavior and an insistence on learning.  
His disciples translated and wrote commentaries on the **Bhagavad Gita** and the  
**Bhagavata Purana**, both important  
**Vaishnava** texts.
