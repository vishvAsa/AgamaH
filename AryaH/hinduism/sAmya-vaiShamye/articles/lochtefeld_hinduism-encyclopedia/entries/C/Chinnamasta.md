title = "Chinnamasta"

+++
(“She whose head [masta] has been cut  
off [chinna]”) Particular manifestation  
of the **Goddess**, one of the **Mahavidyas**  
(a group of ten powerful goddesses), and  
an important **deity** in the esoteric ritual  
tradition known as **tantra**. The image of  
Chinnamasta is one of the most striking  
in Hindu iconography: a naked headless  
woman often seated on a copulating  
couple, holding her head on a platter  
and gushing three streams of **blood**  
from her neck—two into the mouths of  
Chinnamasta’s attendant deities and  
one into the lips of her own severed  
head. The story behind this figure is that  
Chinnamasta severs her own head to  
satisfy the demands of her attendants  
because they have not drunk their fill of  
blood in battle. This image graphically  
portrays the interconnections between  
nourishment, sex, and death and the  
power of the Goddess over all of  
these things. Although Chinnamasta is  
powerful, she does not have many  
temples dedicated to her. One of the  
most important is the temple of the  
goddess **Chintapurni**, identified as a  
form of Chinnamasta in the **Shiwalik**  
**Hills**. For further information see
