title = "Causal Chains"

+++
The underlying ultimate concern in all  
Indian philosophical schools is to  
uncover and understand the causal  
forces that keep human beings  
enmeshed in **samsara**, the continual  
cycle of reincarnation. One of the ways  
that Indian philosophers attempted to  
do this was to formulate various chains  
of cause and effect detailing the process  
through which human beings become  
subject to the bondage of **karma**. By  
understanding this process, they hope  
to be able to manipulate it, ultimately  
leading to the final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). The oldest causal chains were  
formulated by the Buddha and the Jains.  
In each of these theories, **avidya**, or lack  
of genuine understanding, starts the  
causal chain. In the Buddhist and Jain  
traditions, these causal chains can be  
broken by a religious discipline that  
begins with moral action and at more  
advanced levels involves meditation  
and wisdom.  
Causal chains in Hindu **philosophy**  
have much in common with these  
beliefs, particularly the notion that  
avidya is the basic problem. In the  
**Nyaya Sutras**, the **Nyaya** philosopher  
**Gautama** propounded a five-fold causal  
chain: pain, **birth**, activity, defect, and  
wrong notion. Each of these elements  
is caused by the one succeeding it  
and is eliminated with the destruction  
of its cause. The **Vaisheshika** school,  
which was traditionally paired with  
the Nyayas, also used this model. The  
causal chain in the **Samkhya** philosophical school, as described by its founder,  
**Ishvarakrishna**, ascribes bondage to  
the process of **evolution**, stemming  
from the confusion between **purusha**  
(conscious spirit) and **prakrti** (primal  
matter). According to Samkhya,  
these two first principles are always  
separate from one another, but humans  
can confuse them. The **Yoga** school,  
traditionally paired with the Samkhya,  
used this model as well. The philosopher  
**Ramanuja**, founder of the **Vishishthadvaita**  
**Vedanta** school, proposes an evolutionary scheme similar to the Samkhya  
model, although instead of Samkhya’s  
dualism, all things evolve from a single  
source, **Brahman**.  
The only major Hindu philosophical  
school without a causal chain is **Advaita**  
**Vedanta**. All of the other schools explain  
the relationship between the Ultimate  
Reality (in most cases, Brahman) and  
the perceivable world with the doctrine  
of **parinamavada**. This philosophical  
perspective accepts the reality of the  
world as it is perceived and also assumes  
132  
Castration  
that the changes in the material world  
involve the genuine transformation  
(parinama) of one thing into another,  
which can be explained by cause and  
effect. The Advaita school upholds a  
philosophical position known as  
monism, which is the belief that a single  
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things,  
which are merely differing forms of that  
reality. For the Advaitins, this single reality is the formless, unqualified  
Brahman. Advaitins explain the appearance of difference and diversity in the  
everyday world as an illusory rather  
than a genuine transformation of  
Brahman, a philosophical outlook  
known as **vivartavada**. This illusory  
transformation is caused by a quality of  
the human mind, which leads to the  
mental superimposition (**adhyasa**) of a  
mistaken understanding in place of the  
real one. For the Advaitins, as for all of  
the other schools, the ultimate problem  
is still avidya, or mistaken understanding, which must be replaced by correct  
understanding. Whereas all of the other  
schools give some importance to  
actions, the Advaitins believe that avidya  
is the sole cause and its removal the sole  
solution. For further information see
