title = "Chandika"

+++
A variant of the name **Chandi**, which  
designates a powerful and terrifying  
form of the **Goddess**. Chandika is one of  
the **Navadurgas**, the “nine [forms of the  
goddess] **Durga**” worshiped during the  
nine nights of the **Navaratri** festival.  
Chandika is the goddess worshiped  
on the festival’s ninth and final night  
and is thus the most powerful of these  
divine forms.
