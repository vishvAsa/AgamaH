title = "Corbelling"

+++
In the realm of **architecture** this term  
refers to the creation of a dome or arch  
through overlapping masonry courses.  
This technique was widely used in  
Indian temples, particularly those constructed in the **Nagara** style of architecture in **Orissa** and the rest of northern  
India. Corbelling was the prevailing  
method of creating the shape of an arch,  
since the true arch—in which each  
part is supported in tension with the  
others—was unknown in classical  
Hindu architecture.
