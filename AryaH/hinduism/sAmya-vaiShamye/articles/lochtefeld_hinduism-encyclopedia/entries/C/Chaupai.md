title = "Chaupai"

+++
(“four-footed”) Poetic form in northern  
Indian poetry. As its name suggests, the  
chaupai is made up of four lines. The  
rhyme scheme is *aabb*, which has led  
some to consider it a compound of two  
two-line segments. Based on the distinction between “heavy” and “light”  
syllables, each line contains sixteen  
metric beats arranged in a pattern of  
6 + 4 + 4 + 2. A heavy syllable contains a  
long vowel or a consonant cluster and is  
counted as two metric beats; all other  
syllables are light and count as one beat.  
The chaupai is one of the most important **meters** in medieval **Hindi** literature,  
particularly for longer narrative works,  
and it is a significant meter in **bhakti**  
(devotional) poetry. Its most famous  
use appears in the **Ramcharitmanas**,  
the **Ramayana** retold by the poetsaint **Tulsidas**.
