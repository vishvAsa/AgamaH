title = "Chola Dynasty"

+++
(9th–13th c. C.E.) Southern Indian  
dynasty whose ancestral homeland  
was the **Tanjore** district of **Tamil Nadu**.  
The earliest Chola capital was in the city  
of Tanjore itself, but was later moved  
to **Gangaikondacholapuran** under  
**Rajendra I** (r. 1014–1042 C.E.). The  
Tanjore district is in the **Cauvery** River  
delta and is extremely fertile rice-growing land. The Chola monarchs used this  
agricultural strength as the foundation  
for their empire. The Cholas were originally vassals of the **Pallava dynasty** but  
became independent late in the ninth  
century. In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the Cholas were the dominant  
power in southern India, controlling  
much of peninsular India and **Sri Lanka**  
and sending naval expeditions as far as  
Malaysia. The Cholas were noted for  
their public works, particularly the construction of massive temples in the  
Tanjore district and other parts of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**; one of the most impressive was  
the **Brhadeshvar** temple built by **Raja**  
**Raja** (r. 985–1014 C.E.). On a smaller  
scale, the Chola dynasty also patronized  
exquisite sculptures, especially **bronzes**.  
This dynasty’s rapid rise was marked  
by an equally swift demise. By the  
middle of the thirteenth century, they  
had been attacked several times by  
the **Pandya dynasty** and were finally  
conquered in 1279.
