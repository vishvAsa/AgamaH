Chakravyuha  
A shoemaker in Agra. Shoemaking and leather tanning are traditional occupations of the Chamar social group.  
and the border of **Nepal**. Now it is composed of two provinces, eastern  
Champaran and western Champaran.  
The Champaran region is famous as the  
place where **Mohandas K. Gandhi** engineered the first successful **satyagraha**  
(nonviolent resistance campaign)  
against British rule. At the time, the  
province was largely agricultural, as it  
remains today, and most of the inhabitants were very poor. The farmers had  
traditionally designated a portion of  
their land for growing indigo to give to  
the landlords as rent. This arrangement  
was disrupted by the invention of a  
much cheaper synthetic indigo. The  
landlords responded by ordering the  
tenants to stop growing indigo but proceeded to raise the rent on their land,  
based on the traditional agreement that  
allowed them to do so if a tenant grew  
no indigo. The trouble began in 1912,  
but Gandhi did not arrive until 1917.  
After a campaign lasting nearly a year,  
the tenants won concessions from the  
landlords guaranteeing no further rent  
increases and a 25 percent rebate on the  
previous increases. For further information see Mohandas K. Gandhi, *An*  
*Autobiography*, 1993; a more readable,  
though highly partial, account can be  
found in Louis Fischer, *Gandhi*, 1954.
