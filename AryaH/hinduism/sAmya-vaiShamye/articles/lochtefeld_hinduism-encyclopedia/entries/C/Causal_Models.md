title = "Causal Models"

+++
In Indian **philosophy**, there are three  
different models describing the relationships between cause and effect:  
**satkaryavada**, **asatkaryavada**, and  
**anekantavada**. The first model,  
satkaryavada, assumes that effects preexist in their causes. Effects are thus  
transformations (real or apparent) of  
these causes. The classic example is the  
transformation of milk to curds, butter,  
and clarified butter. According to  
satkaryavada’s proponents, each of  
these effects was already present in the  
cause and emerges from it through a  
natural transformation of that cause.  
The second model, asatkaryavada,  
assumes that effects do not preexist  
in their causes—they are completely  
distinct. In the classic examples for this  
model, one creates a clay pot by putting  
together the two halves of the pot, or  
one weaves a cloth from strands of  
thread. According to asatkaryavada’s  
proponents, with each of these acts, certain material and instrumental causes  
create an entirely new object.  
The third model, anekantavada (“the  
view that things are not single”), seeks to  
occupy the middle ground between the  
other two models. Anekantavada stresses  
the importance of one’s perspective and  
the way it can color a judgment. In viewing the transformation of milk to curds,  
butter, and clarified butter, an anekantavada proponent would claim that  
these substances were contained in the  
causes (supporting the satkaryavada  
notion) but that the qualities of these  
substances were newly created each  
time (supporting the asatkaryavada  
notion). Thus causes and effects are  
simultaneously both the same and different, depending on the way one looks  
at them.  
All of these philosophical schools  
believe that if one understands the  
causal process correctly and can manipulate it through one’s conscious actions,  
it is possible to gain final liberation of  
the soul (**moksha**). Each of these causal  
models thus has profound implications  
on religious life. Satkaryavada believes  
that causal relations are strong, but they  
may be so strong that humans cannot  
affect the **causal chain**; the asatkaryavada  
believes that causal relations are weak,  
with the danger that human action is  
too unreliable to bring about a desired  
effect; anekantavada purports to find a  
middle ground but can be construed as  
inconsistent or self-contradictory. For
