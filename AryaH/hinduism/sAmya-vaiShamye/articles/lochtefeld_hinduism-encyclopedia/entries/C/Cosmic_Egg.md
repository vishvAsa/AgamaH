title = "Cosmic Egg"

+++
(brahmanda) One of the traditional  
cosmological metaphors, which first  
appears in the **Markandeya Purana**.  
This text describes a single swollen  
egg floating on the **waters** of the sea  
of **pralaya**, or cosmic dissolution.  
When this egg is broken open by  
**Brahma**, its constituent parts (yolk,  
white, shell, and various membranes)  
form both the material universe and all  
the creatures in it. Although this account  
is clearly symbolic, it vividly expresses  
the Hindu conviction that all things  
have come from a single source,  
and thus the entire cosmos is an  
organic whole. For further elaboration see
