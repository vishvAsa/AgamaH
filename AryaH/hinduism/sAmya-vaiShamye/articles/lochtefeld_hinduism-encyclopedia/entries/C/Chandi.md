title = "Chandi"

+++
(“fierce”) Epithet used for the fierce and  
powerful goddesses **Durga** and **Kali**. A  
variant form of the name Chandi is  
**Chandika**, and under this name Chandi  
is identified as one of the **Navadurgas**,  
the “nine [forms of the **goddess**] **Durga**”  
worshiped during the nine nights of the  
**Navaratri** festival. Chandika is the goddess  
worshiped on the festival’s ninth and  
final night and is thus the most powerful  
of these divine forms.
