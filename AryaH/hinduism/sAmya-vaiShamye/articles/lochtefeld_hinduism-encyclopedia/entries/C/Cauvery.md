Southern Indian river rising at the base  
of the western **ghats** in the state of  
**Karnataka**, then flowing east through  
the state of **Tamil Nadu** before entering  
133  
Cauvery  
the Bay of Bengal. It is traditionally  
considered one of India’s seven sacred  
rivers along with the **Ganges**, **Godavari**,  
**Indus,Narmada**, **Saraswati**, and **Yamuna**.  
Important sacred sites (**tirthas**) on the  
Cauvery include **Shrirangapatnam**  
and **Tiruchirappalli** as well as the  
Cauvery Delta in Tamil Nadu’s **Tanjore**  
district, which is filled with temple  
towns. Since 1947, when India gained  
independence, the rights to the  
Cauvery’s water have become a major  
dispute between Tamil Nadu and  
Karnataka. Farmers in Tamil Nadu have  
been demanding a more significant  
share of the waters impounded in reservoirs in Karnataka.
