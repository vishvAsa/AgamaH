title = "Cunningham, Sir Alexander"

+++
(1814–1893) First director of the  
Archeological Survey of India and the  
father of modern Indian archeology.  
Cunningham first came to India in  
1831 as an officer in the Royal  
Engineers, but his hobby was the study  
of ancient India’s material artifacts.  
This passion eventually resulted in the  
formation of the A.S.I., which Cunningham  
headed until his retirement in 1885. By  
surveying sites, cataloging their contents, and translating **inscriptions**, his  
work was fundamental to preserving  
India’s heritage.
