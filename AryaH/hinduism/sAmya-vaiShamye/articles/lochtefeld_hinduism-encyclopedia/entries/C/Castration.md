title = "Castration"

+++
Castration of human beings has been  
almost completely absent in Indian history, with the notable exception of the  
**hijras**. Hijras are male cross-dressers  
who dress and behave as **women** and  
have usually undergone self-castration  
as a ritual renunciation of their sexuality.  
Hijras are often homosexual prostitutes,  
and they are an established part of the  
decadent underside of most Indian  
cities. Their most important ritual function is to sing and **dance** at the houses in  
which a male child has been born, but  
they may also be called to perform on  
other auspicious occasions. Despite the  
hijrasâ€™ associations with certain auspicious occasions, they are marginal to  
society and have very low social status.  
For a reliable study of the hijras, see  
Serena Nanda, *Neither Man Nor Woman*,  
\1999. See also **auspiciousness**.
