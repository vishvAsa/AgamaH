title = "Chinmayanand, Swami"

+++
(b. **Balakrishna** Menon, 1915â€“1993)  
Modern Hindu **ascetic** and teacher.  
Chinmayanand became an ascetic under  
the influence of **Swami Shivananda**,  
whose articles Chinmayanand had first  
read while serving a prison sentence for  
his involvement in the independence  
movement. For several years he devoted  
himself to the study of ancient texts and  
became one of the leading authorities of  
the **Vedas**. Part of his legacy is the  
Chinmayanand Mission, which carried  
the abstract, intellectual, and peaceful  
message of the **Vedanta** philosophical  
school to the world. Another part of his  
legacy is the **Vishva Hindu Parishad**, a  
modern militant Hindu organization.  
He was one of its founding members in  
1964, and for some years he was the only  
ascetic on its governing council.
