title = "Curses"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the standard devices either to advance the  
story’s plot or to account for some  
inexorable event. Such curses are  
often the work of sages and other spiritual adepts, but they can also be  
levied by any person who has perfectly fulfilled his or her social role, such  
as a faithful wife, loving **son**, or devoted parent. Making a curse expends the  
spiritual powers that a person has  
accumulated. At least in mythical  
tales, such curses invariably come  
true no matter what a person might do  
to try to prevent them. For example, in a  
mythic story, King **Parikshit** secludes  
himself on a high pillar to escape  
death by snakebite but is killed when  
a divine serpent conceals itself as a  
worm in a piece of fruit. Once pronounced, a curse cannot be simply  
nullified, although it can be modified  
to blunt its overall effect. For a consideration of the function of curses in  
Indian mythology, see Robert Goldman,

Public Fantasy and Private Memory in  
Traditional India,” in the *Journal of*
