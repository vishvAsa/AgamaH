title = "Chidvilasananda"

+++
(b. Malti Shetty, 1955) Modern Hindu  
teacher and successor to Swami  
**Muktananda**. Muktananda taught a  
type of spiritual discipline called **siddha**  
**yoga**, the “discipline of the adepts,”  
which stresses chanting, meditation,  
learning, and above all, devotion to  
one’s spiritual master. Chidvilasananda  
is the current leader and preceptor of  
**SYDA** (Siddha Yoga Dham America), the  
organization founded by her teacher.  
During her childhood, her parents and  
other members of her family were  
Muktananda’s disciples, and she spent  
much of her life in his service, eventually serving as his translator during his visits to America. She and her brother,  
Subhash (who later took the name  
Nityananda), were both designated  
by Muktananda as his successors, but  
her brother left the organization a  
few years after Muktananda’s death.  
Chidvilasananda continues to travel  
between an **ashram** in Ganeshpuri, near  
Bombay, and ashrams and centers  
around the world.
