title = "Charaka Samhita"

+++
Along with the later **Sushruta Samhita**,  
one of the two major sources for the traditional Indian medical school known as  
**ayurveda**. Although its authorship is  
attributed to **Charaka**, it is more likely a  
compendium from earlier sources,  
given its reference to several different  
medical systems and approaches. The  
underlying medical framework of  
ayurveda is the theory of the three bodily  
humors—**vata** (**wind**), **pitta** (bile), and  
**kapha** (phlegm). Although everyone has  
142  
Chandramati  
all three humors, each of these is composed of different elements whose varying proportions are used to explain  
individual body types, metabolic dispositions, and personalities. Diseases  
result from an imbalance of these  
humors—caused by one’s environment  
or personal habits—whereas equilibrium is the state of health. The *Charaka*  
*Samhita* has been edited and translated  
into various languages and has served as  
a source for secondary studies, such as  
Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, *Science*  
*and Society in Ancient India*, 1977.
