title = "Chandella Dynasty"

+++
(10thâ€“14th c. C.E.) Northern Indian  
dynasty that in its heyday controlled  
much of the **Ganges** River valley and  
northern **Madhya Pradesh**. The  
Chandellas are famous for the magnificent temples that they built in the village  
of **Khajuraho**, largely between the  
eleventh and twelfth centuries. These  
temples have survived to the present,  
perhaps due to their remote and inaccessible location. They are excellent  
examples of the developed form of the  
**Nagara** architectural style and are  
world-famous for their astounding display of **erotic** sculptures.
