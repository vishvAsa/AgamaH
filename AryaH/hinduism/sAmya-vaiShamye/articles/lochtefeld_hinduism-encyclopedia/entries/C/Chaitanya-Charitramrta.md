title = "Chaitanya-Charitramrta"

+++
(“nectar of **Chaitanya’s** deeds”) A name  
shared by at least three separate texts, all  
devoted to recounting the life of the  
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533).  
The earliest was written by **Murari**  
**Gupta**, an associate of Chaitanya. Most  
of this text focuses on Chaitanya’s early  
life up to his southern Indian pilgrimage  
ending in 1513, but it also briefly mentions his pilgrimage to the town of  
**Brindavan** in 1514 and his final return  
to the sacred city of **Puri**, in which he  
lived until his death. The second  
account was written nine years after  
Chaitanya’s death by **Kavikarnapura**,  
who freely acknowledged his debt to  
Murari Gupta. The final account was  
written by **Krishnadas Kaviraj** about  
ninety years after Chaitanya’s death.  
Kaviraj’s account focuses mainly on  
Chaitanya’s later life, particularly his  
time in Brindavan. This last version is  
marked by the philosophical influence of Chaitanya’s most important  
disciples, the Goswamis (**Rupa Goswami**,  
**Sanatana Goswami**, and **Jiva Goswami**),  
whose ideas were a major influence  
in shaping the **Gaudiya Vaishnava**  
religious community. None of these  
texts gives an “objective” biography;  
the works are hagiographies written  
by passionate devotees (**bhakta**). See  
also **philosophy**.
