title = "Chinmoy, Shri"

+++
(b. 1931) Modern Hindu teacher and  
missionary, who since 1964 has spent  
much of his life addressing Western  
audiences. His teachings are largely  
drawn from classical ideas on **yoga** and  
stress the importance of **vegetarianism**,  
discipline, and service to one’s **guru**. His  
own lifestyle is austere and largely unostentatious, as an example to his followers. On one hand he is notable for his  
attention to the arts—painting, poetry,  
and music, particularly the bamboo  
flute—and on the other for performing  
prodigious feats of strength to demonstrate the power of mind over matter. He  
is based in New York City, although like  
many modern Hindu teachers, he travels throughout the world.
