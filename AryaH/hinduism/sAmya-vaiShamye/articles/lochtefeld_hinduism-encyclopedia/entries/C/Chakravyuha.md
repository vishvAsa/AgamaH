title = "Chakravyuha"

+++
(“circular phalanx”) A circular military  
formation described in the **Mahabharata**,  
one of the two great Hindu epics (along  
with the **Ramayana)**. The Chakravyuha  
was widely believed to be unconquerable because each person in the formation was protected by those behind  
him. During a battle in the Mahabharata  
war, **Abhimanyu** becomes trapped in  
the chakravyuha by his enemy. Because  
his father, **Arjuna**, is the only person  
who knows how to get out, Abhimanyu  
is killed.
