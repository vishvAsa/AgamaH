title = "Chandidas"

+++
(15th c. C.E.) Bengali poet and devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna**. In his  
poems Chandidas uses the conventions  
of **Sanskrit** love poetry to express devotion to Krishna, most often through the  
figure of **Radha** as Krishna’s favored  
devotee and lover. His poems are still  
recited in Bengal and according to tradition were admired by **Chaitanya**, the  
Bengali devotee who was the founder of  
the **Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious community. Despite his poetry’s continuing  
acclaim, little is known about the life of  
Chandidas himself. This same name was  
used by a Bengali poet of the **Sahajiya**  
sect, who wrote several centuries later  
than the original Chandidas and whose  
poetry is clearly distinguished by doctrinal differences. For selections from the  
poetry of Chandidas, see Edward C.  
Dimock Jr. and Denise Levertov (trans.),  
*In Praise of Krishna*, 1981.
