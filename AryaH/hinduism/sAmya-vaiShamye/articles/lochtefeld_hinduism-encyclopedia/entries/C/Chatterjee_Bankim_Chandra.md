title = "Chatterjee, Bankim Chandra"

+++
(1838–1894) Bengali writer and Indian  
nationalist who was one of the major  
figures in the nineteenth-century  
revival of Bengali literature and in  
making the area a hotbed of opposition  
to British rule. As a young man,  
Chatterjee perceived how the influence  
of English language and culture was  
superseding that of Indian culture  
among educated Indians. He sought to  
reverse this through his writing and  
political activism by encouraging  
Indian intellectuals to rediscover their  
classical culture. He became a seminal  
figure in both literature and politics,  
paving the way for the poet **Rabindranath Tagore** and political activists  
**Aurobindo Ghose** and **Subhash Chandra**  
**Bose**. Chatterjee’s most famous novel,  
**Anandamath**, focused on the late  
eighteenth-century **Sanyasi Rebellion**,  
in which bands of militant **ascetics**,  
both Hindu and Muslim, fought with  
the British East India Company for  
control of Bengal. Although historical  
inquiry attributes this conflict to social  
and economic tensions in contemporary Bengal, Chatterjee portrays it allegorically as a struggle by Mother India’s  
loyal children to expel the British  
invaders. Chatterjee also wrote the  
words to “Vande Mataram” (“Homage to  
Mother [India]”), a patriotic song often  
described as the unofficial Indian  
national anthem.
