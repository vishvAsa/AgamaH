title = "Creation Hymn"

+++
Popular name for a hymn in the **Rg Veda**  
(10.129), which is one of the most  
unusual hymns in the **Vedas**. The four  
Vedas are the oldest Hindu religious  
texts, and based on its style and content,  
the Rg Veda is the oldest of these. Most  
of the hymns in the Rg Veda are invocations addressed to various divinities.  
These hymns are sung to invoke and  
propitiate these divinities so that  
human beings may enjoy the good  
things in life. In marked contrast to the  
confidence and optimism found in the  
earlier hymns, the Creation Hymn takes  
a far more speculative tone. In the  
Creation Hymn, the poet begins by  
imagining a time before the existence of  
Being and Nonbeing, and he speculates  
on the origin of the world. In the end the  
poet ascribes all creation to a single  
impersonal agent, “That One” (**Tad**  
159  
Creation Hymn  
**Ekam**). However, the poem concludes  
with the thought that even That One  
may not know the secrets of the cosmos.  
In its speculative tone and its admission  
that the ultimate answer may be  
unknown, it foreshadows the final  
stratum of the Vedic literature,  
the **Upanishads**.
