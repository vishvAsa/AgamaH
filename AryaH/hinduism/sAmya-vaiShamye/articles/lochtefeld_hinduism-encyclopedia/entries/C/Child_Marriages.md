title = "Child Marriages"

+++
Until well into the twentieth century, in  
many families it was traditional to marry  
off their children before the onset of  
puberty. An early marriage was deemed  
particularly important for **women**, lest  
they come of age before they were married. Some apologists claim that this  
practice evolved as a way to preserve the  
honor of Hindu girls against the depredations of Muslim raiders. Though this  
may have been partially true, such  
depredations were not widespread  
enough to evolve such a well-accepted  
social practice. Traditional Indian culture ascribes a much stronger sex drive  
to women than to men, and an early  
marriage would ensure that they did not  
disgrace the family under the influence  
of their irresistible urges. These marriages were possible because **arranged**  
**marriages** were the norm, as they  
remain to this day.  
Many of the Hindu reformist movements that began in the late nineteenth century considered child  
marriages one of the “corruptions” of  
contemporary Hindu life and lobbied  
vigorously to forbid it. Modern Indian  
law sets the minimum age for marriage  
at sixteen for women and eighteen for  
men. These guidelines are often flouted, particularly in rural areas, where  
one still hears of marriages between  
infants. Although child marriages still  
occur, it is a very low-status practice in  
modern Indian society, associated with  
poverty, backwardness, and a lack of  
education. In contrast, men and  
women from the upper classes often  
do not marry until their late twenties,  
after pursuing advanced degrees. See
