(“**moon’s** path”) Penitential rite  
(**prayashchitta**) lasting for one **lunar**  
**month** in which the penitent’s food consumption mirrors the monthly course of  
the moon. A person observing this rite  
begins by **eating** fourteen mouthfuls of  
food on the first **day** of the waning  
moon, then one less mouthful on each  
successive day until the **new moon** day,  
when a complete fast (**upavasa**) is  
observed. On each successive day during the waxing moon, the penitent eats  
one more mouthful, finishing at fifteen  
on the day of the **full moon**. This is a  
fairly severe penance, given the scant  
amount of food allowed in the middle of  
the month. In the **dharma literature**,  
this penance was prescribed as an  
atonement for certain sorts of sexual  
misconduct: sexual intercourse with a  
woman belonging to the same **gotra**  
(mythic lineage), marrying a woman  
belonging to one’s maternal grandfather’s gotra, or marrying the **daughter** of  
one’s maternal uncle or paternal aunt.
