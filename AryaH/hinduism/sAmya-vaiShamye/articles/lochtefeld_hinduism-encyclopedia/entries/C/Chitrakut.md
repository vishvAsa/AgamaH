title = "Chitrakut"

+++
City in the Banda district of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**, about sixty miles south and  
west of the city of **Allahabad**. In the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics, Chitrakut is the place in  
which **Rama**, the epic’s hero, his wife  
**Sita**, and his brother **Lakshmana** live  
during the early part of their exile. It  
is here as well that Rama instructs  
another brother, **Bharata**, to rule as  
regent until the fourteen years of Rama’s  
exile have ended.
