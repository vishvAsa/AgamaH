title = "Caves, Artificial"

+++
This was a common architectural form  
in the western part of the state of  
**Maharashtra**, particularly in the early  
centuries of the common era. The earliest form was the **chaitya** or rock-cut  
cave temple, which is specifically associated with Buddhist architectural sites. A  
chaitya typically had a large chamber  
sculpted into the side of a hill, usually  
with a Buddha image at the far end and  
a window above the entrance to admit  
more light. These caves were excavated  
and sculpted from the top down so that  
no scaffolding was necessary. The sides  
and central pillars were carved to mimic  
wooden construction. Early Hindu  
**architecture** adapted the chaitya form  
but eventually moved beyond it to construct free-standing temples. The most  
impressive Hindu rock-cut temples are  
the caves at **Ellora**, particularly the  
**Kailasanatha** temple (late 8th c.), dedicated to the god **Shiva** in his form as the  
Lord of Mount **Kailas**. The Kailasanatha  
temple was sculpted out of solid rock  
but carved to look as if it were built of  
masonry. This temple marked the  
height of the artificial cave as an architectural type, although the temples at  
**Elephanta** were done later. After this  
period, the emphasis tended to be on  
free-standing temples.
