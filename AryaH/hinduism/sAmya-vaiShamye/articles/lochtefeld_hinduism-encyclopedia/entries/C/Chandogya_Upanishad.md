title = "Chandogya Upanishad"

+++
Along with the **Brhadaranyaka**  
**Upanishad**, one of the two earliest  
upanishads, the religious texts that form  
the most recent stratum of the **Vedas**.  
Internal textual factors indicate that  
the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is the  
older of the two, and since large sections  
of both texts are the same, the  
Chandogya Upanishad is thought to  
be dependent on the Brhadaranyaka.  
Both texts are also much larger than the  
other upanishads and much less  
organized, rambling from topic to topic  
without an apparent focus. Both  
are written in prose rather than poetry,  
with the text itself often presented as  
a dialogue between various speakers.  
Their profoundly speculative discussions about the nature of the  
universe became important sources for  
the later upanishads.
