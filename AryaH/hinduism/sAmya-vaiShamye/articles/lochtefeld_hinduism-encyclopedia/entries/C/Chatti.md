A pilgrim shelter, particularly in the  
**Himalayas**. The word *chatti* is a variant  
form of the word for “umbrella” and was  
used because these shelters were often  
simply roofs supported by pillars, to  
keep the pilgrims dry in case of rain. Up  
until the middle of the twentieth  
century, many Himalayan pilgrims still  
traveled on foot and used a network of  
chattis along the pilgrimage routes.  
These chattis were eight to twelve miles  
144  
Chataka  
Vishnu sleeping on a serpent couch. According to Hindu tradition, during the four months that Vishnu  
sleeps, the world is denied his protective powers and the Chaturmas Vrat is observed during this time.  
apart, an easy day’s walk for younger pilgrims, yet manageable for the elderly.  
Each chatti was maintained by a nearby  
family, which would sell the pilgrims  
wood and food grains and provide them  
with cooking utensils. This arrangement  
brought income to mountain families  
during the pilgrimage season and freed  
pilgrims to carry only their personal  
belongings. The advent of paved roads  
and bus transportation has largely rendered this network obsolete, although it  
survives in certain place names, such as  
Janaki Chatti and Hanuman Chatti.
