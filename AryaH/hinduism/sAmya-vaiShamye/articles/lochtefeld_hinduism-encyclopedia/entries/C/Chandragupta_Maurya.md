(r. 321–297 B.C.E.) The founder of the  
**Maurya dynasty**. The young  
Chandragupta began his empire by  
141  
Chandragupta Maurya  
Coins from the Gupta dynasty.  
overthrowing the last member of the  
**Nanda** dynasty and occupying the capital in **Pataliputra**, identified with the  
modern city of Patna in the state of  
**Bihar**. From there he took control of the  
**Ganges** River basin, moved south into  
the region of the **Narmada River**, and  
then turned his attention to northwestern India, taking advantage of the power  
vacuum left by the recent incursion of  
Alexander the Great. In 303 B.C.E. he  
defeated Alexander’s general Seleucus  
Nicator in battle, then agreed to a treaty  
in which he received large parts of modern Afghanistan. Despite the battle, relations seem to have been friendly  
between the two, for Seleucus Nicator  
sent an ambassador to Pataliputra,  
**Megasthenes**, who lived there for many  
years. Chandragupta was reportedly  
advised by a brilliant **brahmin** minister,  
variously called **Kautilya** or **Chanakya**,  
who is considered the author of the  
**Arthashastra**. According to legend,  
Chandragupta renounced his throne to  
become a Jain monk and eventually died  
through ritual starvation.
