(“clothed in thought”) Temple town in  
the South Arcot district of the state of  
**Tamil Nadu**, about 125 miles south of  
Madras. The town of Chidambaram is  
famous for the temple of the same  
name, dedicated to the god **Shiva** in his  
form as **Nataraja**, the lord of the **dance**.  
This temple is also renowned as containing the subtlest of the five elemental  
**lingas** (**bhutalingas**), the linga made  
from **space**. The temple is built in the  
classical **Dravida** style, with temple towers (**gopurams**) rising in each of the cardinal directions, and the walls enclosing  
the temple between them. The present  
temple was erected in the tenth century  
C.E., when Chidambaram was the capital  
of the **Chola dynasty**, and is reputed to  
be one of the oldest temples in southern  
India. As lord of the dance, Nataraja  
symbolizes the connection between  
religion and the arts. Nataraja is the primal dancer whose dance encompasses  
creation, destruction, and all things in  
between. Human dancers imitate him  
literally, by performing the dance positions he codified, and figuratively, by  
participating in a creative activity. The  
temple’s eastern wall has relief carvings  
of the 108 basic dance positions  
(**karanas**) that are still central to classical Indian dance, particularly to the  
**Bharatanatyam** school, which is the  
major dance form in Tamil Nadu.  
Nataraja also has a group of hereditary  
servants, the **Dikshitars**. According  
to their tradition, the **Dikshitars**  
were members of Shiva’s heavenly host  
(**gana**) and accompanied him down  
from **heaven** when he took up residence  
in Chidambaram.
