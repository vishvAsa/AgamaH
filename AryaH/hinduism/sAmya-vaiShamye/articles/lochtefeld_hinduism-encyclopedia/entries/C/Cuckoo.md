(*Cuculus melanoleucus* or *jacobinus*)  
Indian songbird intimately connected  
with both love and the **monsoon** rains.  
The cuckoo’s mating season comes during the monsoon,when its piercing calls  
are fancifully interpreted as *piu*, *piu*  
(“beloved, beloved”). These cries are  
said to excite the hearts of human  
lovers—either to passion if they are  
together or to bitter pain if the monsoon  
is keeping them apart. The cuckoo’s  
behavior in the rainy season is supposed  
to reflect its love for the monsoon.  
According to popular belief, the cuckoo  
drinks only raindrops, which means that  
for much of the year, it is tormented by  
thirst. In devotional (**bhakti**) poetry, the  
cuckoo is often used as a symbol for the  
devotee (**bhakta**), who is tormented by  
the **deity’s** absence but who waits

patiently for the divine presence. In  
**Sanskrit** poetry this bird is called the  
**chataka**; in modern dialects it is known  
as the kokila or koil.
