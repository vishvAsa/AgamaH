title = "Coryat, Thomas"

+++
(1577â€“1617) English traveler in India  
popularly known as the English **faqir**.  
Coryat came to India from Persia and  
spent several years traveling around the  
Moghul empire in northern India as well  
as residing in the Moghul court at Agra.  
Although at times his need for patronage made him play the role of a buffoon  
and flatterer, Coryat was a careful  
observer who was full of curiosity. He is  
believed to have been the first European  
traveler to visit the pilgrimage city of  
**Haridwar**, and he was impressed with  
the rites performed there. He is also  
believed to have gone into the **Shiwalik**  
**Hills** all the way to the temple at  
**Jwalamukhi**. Unfortunately, Coryat  
died of dysentery before he could  
record these observations, and the only  
available references to these later  
journeys come from his companion,  
the Reverend Edward Terry. See also
