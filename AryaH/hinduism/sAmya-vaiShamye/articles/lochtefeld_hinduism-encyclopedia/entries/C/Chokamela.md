title = "Chokamela"

+++
(d. 1338 C.E.) Poet and saint in the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba** at his temple at  
**Pandharpur** in the modern state of  
**Maharashtra**. Chokamela was born an  
**untouchable Mahar**, and he is the only  
untouchable among the Varkari saints.  
Despite Chokamela’s deep devotion to  
Vithoba, his low social status prohibited  
him from ever entering the god’s temple,  
since his very presence would have rendered it impure. The hagiographical  
151  
Chokamela  
literature tells many tales where Vithoba  
comes outside to meet him. Chokamela’s  
memorial shrine is at the steps of the  
temple, the same steps that marked  
his boundary during his life. It seems  
that Chokamela accepted the restrictions that came with his social status,  
but some of his poetry expresses  
social protest. For further information

and Eknath: Two Bhakti Modes of  
Legitimacy for Modern Change,” in
