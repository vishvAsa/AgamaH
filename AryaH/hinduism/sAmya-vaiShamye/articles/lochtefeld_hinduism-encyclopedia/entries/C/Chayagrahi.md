+++
(“shadow grabber”) A demoness in the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Hindu epics. Chayagrahi lives in the  
ocean and catches birds flying overhead  
by grasping their shadows in the **water**  
and pulling the helpless creatures down  
to her waiting jaws. This method brings  
her a steady food supply, but her big  
mistake is trying to capture the monkeygod, **Hanuman**, in this way. Hanuman

Chau  
tries to leap over the ocean to **Lanka**, the  
capital of the **demon**-king **Ravana**, to  
search for his abducted mistress, **Sita**.  
Chayagrahi grabs him and drags him  
down, but he quickly kills her and continues on his way.
