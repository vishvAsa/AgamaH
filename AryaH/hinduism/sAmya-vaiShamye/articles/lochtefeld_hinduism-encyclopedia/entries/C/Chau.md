title = "Chau"

+++
One of the classical **dance** forms of  
India; some of the others are **Bharatanatyam**, **Kathak**, **Orissi**, **Kuchipudi**,  
**Kathakali**, and **Manipuri**. Different  
forms of Chau are found in the border  
areas shared by the states of **Orissa**,  
**Bihar**, and **West Bengal**. In all three  
regions, the dancers wear masks (chau),  
making this type different from other  
classical dance forms. The expressions  
on the masks set a mood and conceal  
the dancersâ€™ faces. Consequently, Chau  
performers use their bodies and **gestures** to develop the moods established  
by their masks. The prevailing themes in  
Chau dance are drawn from the mythical adventures of gods and heroes, particularly the mythology of the god **Shiva**.
