title = "Chamunda"

+++
Presiding **deity** of the Chamunda Devi  
shrine on the banks of the Bana Ganga  
in the state of **Himachal Pradesh**, and  
one of the nine goddesses whose shrines  
are scattered through the **Shiwalik Hills**.  
Although each of these goddesses has a  
separate identity, they are all ultimately  
seen as differing manifestations of a single **Goddess**. Chamunda’s charter myth  
is drawn from events in the  
**Devimahatmya**, a **Sanskrit** text that  
describes the Goddess’s several different  
forms and is the earliest and most  
important mythic source for the cult of  
the Goddess. The *Devimahatmya*’s seventh book tells how the goddess  
**Ambika’s** anger takes material form as  
the terrifying goddess **Kali**, who  
advances into battle against the **demon**  
generals **Chanda** and **Munda**, whom  
she eventually beheads. Since the shrine  
on the Bana Ganga marks the place  
where both Chanda and Munda were  
destroyed, the goddess is worshiped  
here as Chamunda.  
The name Chamunda designates a  
fierce and dangerous goddess who has  
often been identified with the goddess  
Kali. In the poet **Bhavabhuti’s** eighthcentury drama **Malatimadhava**, the  
heroine, Malati, is kidnapped by devotees (**bhakta**) of the goddess Chamunda  
to be offered as a **human sacrifice** to  
her. The events in the drama reflect the  
ambivalence with which such powerful  
goddesses—and their devotees—have  
been seen. For further information see
