title = "Consecration"

+++
This term can refer to two different rites  
performed in the creation of Hindu  
images. One of these is **devapratishtha**,  
or “establishing the **deity**,” the rites by  
which an image of a deity is constructed  
and established as an object of **worship**.  
The word *consecration* can also be used  
to refer to **pranapratishtha**, the more  
important ritual, in which the image is  
infused with the breath of life and  
becomes the seat for the deity.
