(“wheel”) In Hindu iconography the  
chakra is the discus-weapon carried by  
several of the Hindu **deities**. It is often  
associated with the god **Vishnu** and is  
one of the four objects he invariably  
carries, along with the club (**gada**), lotus  
(**padma**), and conch shell (**shankha**).  
The discus was an actual weapon in the  
Indian military arsenal, and its sharp  
edges made it fearsome in close combat. Vishnu’s discus (named **Sudarshana**)  
is even more fearsome in its power.  
According to tradition it was fashioned  
by the divine craftsman, **Vishvakarma**,  
from pieces trimmed off of the **sun**;  
thus it carries the power of the sun’s  
blazing energy. The discus is also carried  
by certain powerful forms of the  
**Goddess**. In her charter myth, she was  
formed from the collected radiance of  
all the gods and received duplicates of  
all their weapons.  
In the esoteric ritual tradition  
known as tantra, a chakra is a psychic  
center in the **subtle body**. The subtle  
body is an alternate physiological system that corresponds to the material  
body but is believed to reside on a different plane of existence. The subtle  
body is visualized as a set of chakras,  
or psychic centers, that are arranged  
in a column from the base of the spine  
to the top of the head and connected  
by three vertical channels. Each  
chakra is pictured as a multipetaled  
lotus flower. All tantric traditions  
speak of six chakras: **muladhara**, **svadhishthana**, **manipura**, **anahata**, **vishuddha**, and **ajna**; some traditions name  
additional ones. Each of these chakras  
has important symbolic associations—  
with a different human physiological  
capacity, subtle element (**tanmatra**),  
and with differing seed syllables (**bijakshara**) formed from the letters of the  
Sanskrit alphabet, together encompassing all sacred sounds. For further information see Philip S. Rawson, *The Art of*  
*Tantra*, 1973.
