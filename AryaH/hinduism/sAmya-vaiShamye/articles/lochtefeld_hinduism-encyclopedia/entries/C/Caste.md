title = "Caste"

+++
The best-known term to denote the traditional Hindu social structure in which  
groups are arranged in a hierarchy of  
status, usually based on the perceived  
**purity** of each group’s traditional occupation. The word “caste” is actually  
derived from the Portuguese word for  
“chaste.” The Portuguese observed that  
different groups in Indian society kept  
themselves separate from each other, particularly when **eating** and in marriage.  
They used the term “caste” to describe  
this social phenomenon.  
Among Hindus themselves the most  
important concept for social ordering is  
known as the **jati** (“birth”). One  
becomes a member of a jati by being  
born into it. The jatis were usually divided  
according to traditional occupation,  
which (in theory) would be performed  
by that jati alone. A jati’s social status  
generally stemmed from the status of its  
occupation, and jatis such as latrine  
cleaners and tanners were thought to be  
defiled by their trade. Society as a whole  
was conceived on the model of the body,  
with the different jatis comparable to  
different body parts. While each part  
had a differing status and role, every one  
was necessary for the whole to function  
smoothly. These differences in status  
were marked and reinforced by strict  
rules to keep each group distinct from  
the others. The strictest regulations were  
in regard to marriage, and in earlier  
times members of a jati would marry  
only within that group. It was almost as  
if the jatis were seen as separate  
“species” of human beings that had to  
be kept apart. Marrying within one’s jati  
is still the ideal, although there is now  
considerably more intermarriage than  
in the past.  
The best-known model for ordering  
Indian society is that of the four major  
social groups (**varna**) described in the  
**dharma literature**: **brahmin** (priest),  
**kshatriya** (warrior-king), **vaishya** (merchant), and **shudra** (servant). However,  
the number of different jati groups  
makes the social hierarchy far more  
complex. A small village might have  
dozens of jatis, all performing certain  
tasks, whereas a city might have hundreds of jatis, some highly specialized.  
Even within the brahmin varna, there  
are different brahmin jatis (for example,  
**Saraswat**, **Chitpavan**, **Kanyakubja**, and  
**Kanaujia**). For other varnas the picture  
is even more complex. For instance,  
some jati groups fall between the  
vaishya and shudra varnas, and jati  
groups of humble status who have  
achieved political success may claim

kshatriya lineage. The same jati’s social  
position can vary from region to region,  
depending on if they comprise a majority or a minority of the population or  
have status as a land-holding community.  
As in most of Hindu life, a group’s status  
is usually influenced by local factors; in  
the past fifty years, such status determinations have also been affected by  
changes in Indian society, which have  
tended to relax social distinctions. For
