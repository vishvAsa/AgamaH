title = "Cow Slaughter"

+++
A complete ban on cow slaughter has  
been one of the more durable issues  
taken up by Hindu interest groups, from  
before India gained independence in  
1947 all the way up to the present day.  
Although debate on this issue has continuously emerged and faded, it remains  
a reliable hot button for stirring Hindu  
passions. This issue has predictably carried far more weight in northern India,  
where there is a significant Muslim  
**minority** with no religious objection to  
slaughtering and **eating** beef. The first  
widespread demand for such a ban  
came during the **Cow Protection**  
**Movement** in the 1930s. This movement  
aggravated tense communal relations  
between the Hindu and Muslim communities, resulting in significant bloodshed. Since independence it has been a  
perennial demand by religious leaders  
and **ascetics**, and it has been an issue in  
the platform of Hindu political organizations such as the **Jana Sangh**, **Shiv**  
**Sena**, **Vishva Hindu Parishad** (VHP), and  
**Bharatiya Janata Party** (BJP). In the past,  
such demands had little effect since the  
proponents did not have the power to  
implement them. As the BJP and the Shiv  
Sena have gained control of state and  
local governments, they have tried to  
implement this policy. In late 1995 the  
VHP initiated a national drive to ban cow  
slaughter completely. Like many of the  
VHPâ€™s campaigns, this was undertaken  
just before upcoming elections, in this  
case at the national level. This campaign  
was seen as an attempt to polarize the  
Hindu electorate in an effort to influence the national election.
