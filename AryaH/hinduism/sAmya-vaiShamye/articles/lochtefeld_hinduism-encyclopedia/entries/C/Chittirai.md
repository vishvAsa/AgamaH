title = "Chittirai"

+++
(2) Ten-**day** festival celebrated in the  
southern Indian city of **Madurai** during  
the **Tamil month** of Chittirai  
(March–April). Madurai is famous for its  
gigantic temple dedicated to the **goddess Minakshi**, and the Chittirai festival  
celebrates Minakshi’s marriage to the  
god **Shiva** in his form as Sundareshvara.  
According to mythology, Minakshi is a  
fierce goddess who vows that she will  
marry only a man who bests her in battle. She fights and conquers all of the  
kings of the **earth**, but when she  
approaches Shiva, she is suddenly and  
spontaneously stricken with modesty.  
The powerful warrior is transformed  
into a shy and bashful girl, and she  
becomes his wife.  
Although the wedding of a goddess  
normally marks her domestication and  
subordination to her spouse, in this case  
Minakshi remains the more powerful  
**deity**. She is the patron of Madurai, with  
a temple dedicated to her, whereas  
Shiva is merely her consort. The wedding is celebrated with great festivity  
throughout the city, and one of the high  
points is the public procession of the  
deities around the city in the temple  
chariots. For further information see

*Myths*, 1980; the festival is also the  
subject of a film, *The Wedding of*  
*the Goddess*, produced by the South  
Asia Center of the University of  
Wisconsin at Madison.
