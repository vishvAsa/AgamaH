title = "Chalukya Dynasty"

+++
(7th–8th c. C.E.) Central Indian dynasty  
whose capital was at Badami, in  
the **Deccan** plateau in modern  
**Karnataka**. The greatest Chalukya ruler  
was **Pulakeshin II**, who defeated the  
northern Indian emperor **Harsha**, stopping his southern advance. He also  
killed the **Pallava dynasty** ruler  
**Mahendravarman**, setting off a series of  
wars between the Chalukyas and the  
Pallavas in which each dynasty was able  
to defeat the other in battle, but neither  
was strong enough to retain control of  
the other’s empire. Aside from the  
Chalukya dynasty based at Badami,  
there were two other smaller dynasties  
by the same name, both of which flourished between the tenth and thirteenth  
centuries. One of these later dynasties  
was in the **Gujarat** region, and the other  
was in the Karnataka region.
