This word refers to patterns of social  
exchange, particularly those associated  
with **eating**. In traditional Hindu society,  
the hierarchical status distinctions  
between different social groups were  
both marked and maintained by strict  
rules on exchanges and sharing.  
Traditional marriage customs illustrate  
the role of social groups, in which people  
married those who belonged to their  
own particular **jati** (“birth”), or social  
subgroup. Another arena in which these  
concerns were quite visible was that of  
food. Cooked food is believed to be  
extremely susceptible to ritual impurity  
(**ashaucha**) and can transmit impurities  
to the person eating it. To shield  
themselves from this source of impurity,  
groups with higher social status  
would not accept cooked foods from  
groups with lower social status. In  
contrast, lower-status groups would  
accept cooked foods from groups with  
higher status.  
These concerns over maintaining  
social status set up certain eating patterns whose influence is still evident.  
Higher-status groups, particularly **brahmins**, would generally eat with members of their own community and only  
when a brahmin had cooked the food.  
For groups highly concerned with ritual  
**purity**, the best meal is one cooked at  
home by a family member, because this  
ensures the food’s purity. Even in modern times, the most orthodox brahmins  
will eat food cooked outside the home  
only when it cannot be avoided. It is  
always considered preferable to eat food  
brought from home, whether one is on a  
long journey or merely at lunch in the  
office. Although in earlier times, the  
groups with the highest status would  
generally not eat with others, this custom has changed. Thus brahmin office  
workers may eat lunch with colleagues  
from many different communities, but  
they would never think of inviting them  
for a meal at their homes. For further  
information on the way that exchanges  
reveal status differences, see McKim

Without Dualism,” in Bruce Kapferer
