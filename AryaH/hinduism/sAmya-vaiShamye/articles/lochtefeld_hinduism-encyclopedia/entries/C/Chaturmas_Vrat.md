title = "Chaturmas Vrat"

+++
A period of time spanning four **lunar**  
**months**, beginning on the festival of  
**Devshayani Ekadashi** (June–July) and  
ending on the festival of **Devotthayan**  
**Ekadashi** (October–November). The  
four months in between these festivals  
are considered ritually inauspicious,  
since during that time the god **Vishnu** is  
considered to be sleeping, and the protective power in the universe is less  
attentive. Thus people generally do not  
perform auspicious life cycle rites such  
as weddings during this period. This  
time also coincides with the coming of  
the **monsoon**, which is essential for  
145  
Chaturmas Vrat  
helping crops to grow but also brings  
danger from waterborne infections and  
venomous snakes. Chaturmas Vrat’s  
inauspicious qualities and the difficulty  
of travel caused by the monsoon make  
this a time when wandering **ascetics**  
should stay in one place. Religious **worship** during this period tends to stress  
**rites of protection**, to shield one from  
these ritual and physical dangers. See  
also **inauspiciousness**.
