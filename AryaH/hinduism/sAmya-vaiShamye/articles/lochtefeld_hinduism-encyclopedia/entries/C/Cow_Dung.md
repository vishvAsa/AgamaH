title = "Cow Dung"

+++
This is considered both ritually pure and  
purifying, perhaps because of its origin  
in the sacred **cow**. A piece of ground can  
be purified (as when preparing a site for  
a ritual) by smearing it with cow dung.  
Cow dung is one of the ingredients in  
the “five products of the cow” (**panchagavya**), which is drunk as a means of  
purification from sin. In addition to its  
spiritual significance, cattle dung is very  
important for daily life in the villages of  
India. When mixed with clay it forms a  
hard, dustless, and easily cleaned surface that is preferable to an earthen  
floor. It is also a reliable source of fuel  
available to even the poorest people.
