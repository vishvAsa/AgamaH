title = "Chauri"

+++
A small whisk used to brush off flies and  
insects. The name is derived from the  
word for the long tail **hairs** of a yak  
(chamara), from which it was originally  
made. In ancient India the chauri was  
an emblem of royalty, and thus it is also  
often seen in statues of religious figures  
such as the **Didarganj Yakshi**.
