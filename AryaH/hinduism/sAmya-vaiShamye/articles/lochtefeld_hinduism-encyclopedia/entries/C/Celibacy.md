title = "Celibacy"

In traditional Indian culture, celibacy  
was widely seen not only as a sign of  
sanctity but also as a source of power.  
On one hand, since sexual desire is often  
the symbol for all types of desire, renunciation of sexual activity is thus a sign for  
the renunciation of the world in general.  
On a more literal level, retention of  
**semen** through celibacy is believed to  
prevent the loss of a man’s vital energy.  
In traditional Indian physiology, semen  
is believed to be distilled from **blood**  
and is therefore the concentrated  
essence of a man’s vitality. Although  
semen can and must be expended for  
procreation, all other losses should be  
carefully weighed. Thus there are strong  
taboos on masturbation. This vital energy,  
stored and conserved through celibacy,  
can then be used for spiritual advancement. The paradigm for the celibate  
**ascetic** is the god **Shiva**, one of whose  
symbols is the **linga**, a pillar-shaped  
image with clear phallic associations.  
Shiva is the model husband and the  
consummate ascetic. The linga represents his stored celibate energy, as the  
product of his **tapas** (ascetic practices).  
In the same way, celibacy is a way for  
human men to conserve their vital energies, whether one is a lifetime celibate  
(**naisthika**), a student (**brahmacharin**),  
or—as in many cases—a married man  
who has already had children.
