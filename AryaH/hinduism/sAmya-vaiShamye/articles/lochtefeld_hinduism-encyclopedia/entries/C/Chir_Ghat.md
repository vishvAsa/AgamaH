title = "Chir Ghat"

+++
(“Clothing **Ghat**”) A bathing (**snana**)  
place on the **Yamuna River** in the town  
of **Brindavan**, which is identified as the  
site for one of the most famous stories  
about **Krishna**. The story tells how the  
**gopis**, Krishna’s female companions,  
have taken a religious vow to bathe each  
morning in the Yamuna during the cold  
months and dedicate the religious merit  
from this vow toward gaining Krishna as  
their beloved. Although their austerity is  
laudable, they are also bathing naked,  
which is taboo in Hindu culture. Krishna  
spies them in the **water** and climbs up in  
a tree with their clothes. He then refuses  
to return the clothes until the mortified  
**women** come out of the water to ask for  
them, symbolically demonstrating the  
nakedness of the soul before God and  
humans’ inability to control the divine.  
A gigantic tree still stands by the Chir  
Ghat, which is believed to be the same  
tree from which Krishna humbled the  
gopis. As pilgrims recall the story, they  
tie strips of cloth to the tree to relieve the  
gopis’ embarrassment and share in their  
feeling of communion.
