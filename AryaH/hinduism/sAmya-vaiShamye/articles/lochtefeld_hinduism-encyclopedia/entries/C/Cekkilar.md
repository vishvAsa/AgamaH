title = "Cekkilar"

+++
(12th c. C.E.) Author of the **Periya**  
**Puranam**, a hagiographical account of  
the sixty-three **Nayanars**. The Nayanars  
134  
were a group of sixty-three **Shaiva** poetsaints who lived in southern India  
between the seventh and ninth centuries. Along with their **Vaishnava** counterparts, the **Alvars**, the Nayanars  
spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu  
religion in opposition to the Buddhists  
and the Jains. Both the Nayanars and the  
Alvars stressed passionate devotion  
(**bhakti**) to a personal god—**Shiva** for  
the Nayanars, **Vishnu** for the Alvars—  
and conveyed this devotion through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**.  
According to tradition, Cekkilar was a  
minister at the court of the **Chola**  
**dynasty**’s king Kullottunga II  
(r. 1130–1150 C.E.). Cekkilar was distressed by the king’s admiration for a  
Jain epic poem and composed his own  
text to distract the king. His text portrays  
the Nayanars as models of devotion to  
Shiva, although they are sometimes  
extreme in their actions. Yet in every  
case, the love between devotee (**bhakta**)  
and **deity** manifests itself in the circumstances of everyday life, leading the  
saints to final liberation.
