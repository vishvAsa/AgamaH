title = "Chaturbhujdas"

+++
(late 16th c.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions of  
these eight poets were used for liturgical  
purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community whose members are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. In the Pushti  
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are  
named as members of the community  
and as associates of either its founder,  
**Vallabhacharya**, or his successor,  
**Vitthalnath**. Chaturbhujdas is claimed  
as an associate of Vitthalnath—an idea  
supported by references in his poetry—  
and is also said to be the **son** of  
**Kumbhadas**, one of the earlier ashtachap poets. In his poetry Chaturbhujdas presents himself as a companion  
to Krishna and his consort, **Radha**, giving latter-day devotees a picture of their  
daily routine.
