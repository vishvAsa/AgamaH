title = "Chaitya"

+++
(“place of **worship**”) A rock-cut cave  
temple. This architectural form is closely  
associated with Indian Buddhism but  
was also used in early Hindu temple  
**architecture**. The earliest chaityas were  
simple caves, but these grew more elaborate as the form developed. In its later  
stages, the builders would not only cut  
136  
Chaitanya-Charitramrta  
out the side of the hill to make a cave;  
they would also sculpt pillars and  
other architectural details that  
mimicked free-standing construction.  
Another characteristic architectural  
feature was a ceiling carved into the  
shape of an arch. The true arch, built  
from the bottom up and used in  
Roman architecture, was not used in  
ancient India. A third common feature  
was a large window opening over the  
doorway to let in additional light.  
During the construction, the builders  
began removing stone at the top of the  
structure and worked their way down;  
this eliminated the need for any scaffolding during the building process,  
but it also meant that the builders had  
to work carefully to avoid mistakes.  
This construction method creates  
structures considered gigantic sculptures rather than buildings. The earliest  
examples are Buddhist caves carved  
into the side of the western **ghats** in  
**Maharashtra**. The form was later used  
to create Hindu temples, specifically  
at **Ellora** (in which the oldest caves  
are Buddhist) and on the island  
of **Elephanta**.
