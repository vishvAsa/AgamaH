Implement used for smoking. The  
chillum is a graduated cylinder of baked  
clay that is usually about six inches long,  
which is about an inch in diameter at  
the top and half that at the bottom. A  
pyramid-shaped piece of clay is wedged  
point-down in the cylinder to cut down  
on the airflow. The top part of the cylinder is filled with tobacco, cannabis, or a  
mixture of tobacco and hashish (**charas**). Smoking is a communal activity in  
which the chillum is passed from one  
person to another. The bottom of the  
chillum is covered with a cloth called a  
**safai**, which is sometimes changed from  
person to person and is often dipped in  
**water** to mellow the smoke. Chillum etiquette holds that one should not place  
one’s mouth directly on the bottom of  
the implement, which would render it  
impure. Because of this, the chillum is  
generally held between one’s fingers,  
often in highly elaborate and symbolic  
ways. Among many **ascetics**, smoking  
the chillum is a part of daily life, a

of emulating the god **Shiva**, the paradigmatic ascetic, whose love for **drugs** is  
well known.
