One of the most fundamental Hindu  
religious beliefs is that different times  
carry different qualities. Whereas some  
times are considered more auspicious  
and propitious, others are more inauspicious and dangerous. These judgments  
may either describe the general qualities  
of specific times or determine the proper time for carrying out particular activities. Thus Hindus have given  
considerable attention to organizing  
time and predicting auspicious  
moments. Many modern Hindus simultaneously use several different calendars, although they may use them for  
different purposes. To begin with, everyday timekeeping is done with the  
Gregorian calendar of the common era,  
which may reflect the influence of the  
British empire or, more simply, the influence of modern commerce and communications. It is notable that the only  
holidays celebrated according to this  
calendar are national holidays such as  
**Independence Day**, **Gandhi Jayanti**,  
and **Republic Day**—all of which are  
fixed on particular **days**. Beyond this  
there are many other methods of measuring time, some of which overlap with  
each other and some of which are found  
only in certain regions of the country.  
Several of these systems are based on  
the movement of the **sun**. The most  
basic unit, of course, is the solar day,  
which traditionally begins and ends not  
by the clock but by the rising of the sun.  
The **week** contains seven solar days. The  
movement of the sun divides the **year**  
into halves, with the **uttarayana** period  
occurring when the sun is moving  
northward and the **dakshinayana** period  
taking place when the sun is moving  
southward. There are also two separate  
versions of the solar year, each of which  
has twelve solar months. In northern  
India these months correspond to the  
twelve signs of the **zodiac** and mark the  
sun’s passage through them. In southern  
India one finds an identical calendar,  
the Tamil solar year, in which the names  
of the months are drawn from the  
names of certain **nakshatras**, or signs of  
the lunar zodiac.  
Whereas the solar calendar is usually  
used for astrological purposes, the lunar  
calendar is important for religious life.  
The lunar calendar is used to measure  
the two eras still used for dating history:  
the **Vikram era** (fifty-six or fifty-seven  
years later than the common era) and  
the **Shaka era** (seventy-eight years earlier  
than the common era). The lunar year is  
made up of twelve **lunar months**, each  
of which has thirty lunar days. Since the  
cycle of the **moon** is only about twentyeight solar days, a lunar day is slightly  
shorter than a solar day. The lunar  
month is divided into two halves of fifteen days each: the “dark” (**krishna paksha**) half, when the moon is waning and  
that ends with the **new moon**; and the  
“light” (**shukla paksha**) half when the  
moon is waxing and that culminates in  
the **full moon**. In northern India the  
lunar month begins with the moon’s  
dark half, and ends on the full moon,  
whereas in the south the reverse is often  
true. Since the solar year has about 365  
days and the lunar year about 354, if left  
uncorrected each lunar year would  
begin eleven solar days earlier than the  
previous one. To correct this discrepancy,  
an **intercalary month** is added about  
every two and a half years. This helps to  
keep the lunar months falling at around  
the same time every year, although the  
celebration of a particular festival can  
vary by several weeks from one year to  
the next.  
Almost all Hindu festivals are  
celebrated according to the lunar  
calendar. Some festivals’ celebrations  
are associated with certain lunar days  
and thus occur twenty-four times in a  
twelve-month lunar year: The eleventh

Calendar  
day (**ekadashi**) of each half of the lunar  
month is sacred to the god **Vishnu**; the  
eighth day (ashtami) is devoted to the  
**Goddess**, particularly in her form as  
**Durga**; the evening of the thirteenth day  
(trayodashi) and the fourteenth day  
(chaturdashi) are sacred to the god  
**Shiva**; and the fourth day (chaturthi) is  
dedicated to the god **Ganesh**. The time  
for celebrating annual religious festivals  
is set according to the lunar month, the  
half of the moon, and the particular  
lunar day. For example, the god  
**Krishna’s** birthday is celebrated on  
**Bhadrapada** Krishna eight, the eighth  
day of the dark (waning) half of the lunar  
month of Bhadrapada. The birthdays of  
many important historical religious figures such as Guru Nanak, the founder of  
the Sikh community; the Buddha, and  
the devotional poet-saints are also celebrated according to the lunar calendar.  
These overlapping calendars mean  
that any particular day can be designated by several different markers: the day  
of the week and the day in the common  
era (as in many societies), the day  
according to the traditional solar calendar, and the day according to the lunar  
calendar. Depending on the context—  
business, astrological, or festival—any  
one of these may be given preference.
