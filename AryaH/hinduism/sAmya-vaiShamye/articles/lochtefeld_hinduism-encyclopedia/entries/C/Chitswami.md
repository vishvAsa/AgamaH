title = "Chitswami"

+++
(late 16th c. C.E.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions of  
these eight poets were used for liturgical  
purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community whose members are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. In the Pushti  
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are  
also named as members of the community and as associates of either the community’s founder, **Vallabhacharya**, or  
his successor, **Vitthalnath**. Chitswami is  
traditionally associated with Vitthalnath,  
a link confirmed by his poems written in  
praise of this **guru**. Aside from such  
explicitly sectarian compositions,  
Chitswami also wrote poetry in praise of  
Krishna, which tends to be more  
elaborate and uses more **Sanskrit** than  
his contemporaries. To date, his works  
have not been translated, perhaps  
because interest in them is limited to  
a small sect.
