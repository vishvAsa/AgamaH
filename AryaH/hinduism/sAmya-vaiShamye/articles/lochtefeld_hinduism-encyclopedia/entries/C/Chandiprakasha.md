(“effulgence of **Chandi**”) Name given to  
the spear that is the symbolic weapon of  
the **Atala akhara**, a particular group  
within the **Naga** class of **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasis**. The Dashanami Nagas are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**,  
organized into different **akharas**, or regiments, on the model of an army. Until  
the beginning of the nineteenth century,  
the Nagas’ primary occupation was as  
140  
Chandas  
mercenary soldiers, although they also  
had substantial trading interests. These  
functions have largely disappeared in  
contemporary times. All of the akharas  
have certain symbols that signify  
their organizational identity, and the  
Atala akhara is represented by this  
particular spear.
