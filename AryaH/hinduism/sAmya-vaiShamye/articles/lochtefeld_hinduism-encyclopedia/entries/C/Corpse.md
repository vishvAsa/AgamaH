In the Hindu worldview, a corpse is the  
source of the most virulent possible ritual impurity (**ashaucha**). Although  
Hindus accept death as an inevitable  
part of life, the dangers caused by a  
corpse cannot be ignored. The dead  
body must be appropriately handled,  
both to protect the living from danger  
and to help the deceased make a  
smooth transition to the next life. For  
this reason the last rites (**antyeshthi**  
**samskara**) are begun on the day of  
death itself. Among the earliest of these

The architectural technique of corbelling was  
used to form the arched entrance to the  
Mukteshvar Temple in Bhubaneshvar.  
rites is the **cremation** of the dead body,  
since the impurity will continue to affect  
those around the body until it has been  
consumed by **fire**. A second reason for  
immediate cremation is to get rid of a  
potential host for wandering spirits,  
who according to popular fears, can  
reanimate a corpse.
