In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual, a  
particular symbolic hand **gesture**  
(**mudra**) in which the tips of the thumb  
and index finger are touching, with the  
rest of the fingers extended and the  
palm facing the viewer. This is the  
hand gesture used to signify explanation or exposition. For this reason it is  
also known as the **vyakhyana** (“teaching”) **mudra** and the **sandarshana**  
(“expository”) **mudra**.
