title = "Cinnabar"

+++
Common name for mercuric sulfide,  
which takes the form of red crystals or  
clumps. Cinnabar is important in Indian  
**alchemy**, particularly that of the mercurial (**dhatuvada**) school because it is a  
chemical union of the two elements representing the god **Shiva** (**mercury**) and  
his consort, **Shakti** (**sulfur**). According  
to Hindu alchemy, the world is a series  
of bipolar opposites in tension with one  
another. By unifying these opposing  
forces, one may achieve spiritual  
progress and the end of reincarnation  
(**samsara**). In Hindu alchemy this is  
done by physically consuming various  
substances. In this case, mercury is said  
to be Shiva’s **semen** and sulfur Shakti’s  
uterine **blood**; their combination and  
consumption is believed to spur the  
aspirant’s progress.
