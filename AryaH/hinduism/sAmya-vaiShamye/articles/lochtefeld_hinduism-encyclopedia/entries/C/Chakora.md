The red partridge (*Perdrix rufa*).  
According to popular belief, the chakora  
bird eats nothing but moonbeams. It is  
thus happy and content during the  
night but tormented by hunger during  
the day. In court poetry the chakora bird  
often symbolized a cultured and discriminating person who appreciates the  
finer things in life. In **bhakti** (devotional) poetry the chakora is often a symbol  
for a devotee (**bhakta**), since the chakora  
bird is said to be in love with the **moon**.  
Thus it is joyful when the moon is out  
but pines for it during the day, just as a  
devotee is blissful in the **deityâ€™s** presence and in its absence is consumed  
with longing.
