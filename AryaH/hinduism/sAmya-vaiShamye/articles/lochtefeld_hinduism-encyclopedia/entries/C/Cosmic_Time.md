title = "Cosmic Time"

+++
In traditional Indian **cosmology**, time  
has neither beginning nor end. Instead  
it proceeds in unceasing cyclic alternations between creation and activity, followed by cessation and quietude. The  
universe thus has neither an ultimate  
beginning nor an ultimate end—creation will always be followed by destruction and then destruction by a new  
creation. Within the confines of this  
assumption, there are several different  
and sometimes competing systems for  
measuring cosmic time.  
The largest generally accepted  
measure of time, spanning 4.32 billion  
years, is the **kalpa**, or **day of Brahma**.  
This is the ultimate limit for the  
existence of the created world, although  
within this period the universe  
undergoes periodic renewals. At the  
conclusion of the day of Brahma comes  
the universal dissolution (**pralaya**), in  
which the universe is completely  
destroyed and reabsorbed into the god  
**Vishnu**. The day of Brahma is followed  
by a night of equal length, during which  
the only living thing is Vishnu; the god  
sleeps on the back of his serpent couch,  
**Shesha**, which floats on the surface of  
the cosmic ocean. When the night of  
Brahma is ended, a lotus sprouts from  
Vishnu’s navel. This lotus opens to  
reveal the god **Brahma**, who takes up  
the work of creation, and the cycle of  
activity begins anew. Because of his  
spontaneous appearance at the beginning of every cosmic age, one of the  
names for Brahma is **Svayambhu** (“selfborn”). Unlike the Judeo-Christian concept of creation, Brahma does not create  
the world from nothing but merely  
arranges and fashions existing elements  
into a coherent and ordered cosmos.  
The day of Brahma is broken up into  
smaller units according to various systems. By far the most common system is  
that of the four **yugas**, or cosmic ages.  
According to this idea, the day of  
155  
Cosmic Time  
Brahma is made up of one thousand  
**mahayugas** (“great cosmic ages”), each  
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.  
Each mahayuga is composed of four  
constituent yugas, named the **Krta**  
**yuga**, **Treta yuga**, **Dvapara yuga**, and  
**Kali yuga**. Each of these is shorter than  
its predecessor and ushers in an era  
more degenerate and depraved. The  
passage of the four yugas begins with a  
time of sudden and dramatic renewal at  
the onset of the krta yuga, followed by a  
steady and persistent decline. Although  
the kali yuga is the shortest of the four  
ages, it is also the time of the greatest  
wickedness and depravity, in which any  
evil is possible. It is also, not surprisingly,  
considered to be the period in which we  
are now living. By the end of the kali  
yuga, things have gotten so bad that the  
only solution is the destruction and  
recreation of the **earth**, at which time  
the next krta era begins. Even though  
the kali yuga is the shortest age, it still  
lasts for 432,000 years, and the preceding yugas are two, three, and four times  
the length of the kali age. The increasing  
degeneracy of each of the four yugas is  
symbolized by the metals associated  
with them: gold (krta), silver (dvapara),  
bronze (treta) and iron (kali). Another  
indication is the status of human beings,  
who are said to become shorter, more  
wicked, and shorter-lived in each succeeding age. The paradigm of the four  
yugas leaves little room in traditional  
Hinduism for the notion of progress,  
since according to this system, things  
will never be better than they  
have already been. It idealizes a lost  
and unattainable past rather than a  
utopian future.  
An alternate system of measuring  
cosmic time connects the human and  
the divine calendars, with one human  
**year** equal to a single day for the gods.  
The six months when the **sun** travels  
toward the north (**uttarayana**) is the  
divine day, whereas the six months  
when it travels south (**dakshinayana**) is  
the divine night. Since an Indian **solar**  
**year** is 360 solar days, a divine year  
would thus last for 360 human years.  
The life span of Brahma is one hundred  
divine years and thus 36,000 human  
years, after which the world is destroyed  
and created anew.  
A third system is that of the  
Manvantaras, or ages of Manu. This system divides the day of Brahma into  
fourteen equal ages, with each one lasting a little less than 309,000 years. Each  
age is identified by the particular divine  
sovereign (manu) who rules during that  
age. None of these three systems correspond to one another, and there is no  
real effort to reconcile them. This lack of  
correspondence indicates that their  
function was primarily mythic, to  
establish a coherent cosmic chronology  
and pattern rather than to describe  
actual events.
