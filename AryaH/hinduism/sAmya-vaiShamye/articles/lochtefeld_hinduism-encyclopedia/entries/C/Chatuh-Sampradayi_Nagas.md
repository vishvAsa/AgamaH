title = "Chatuh-Sampradayi Nagas"

+++
Collective name for four groups (**sampraday**) of militant (**Naga**) ascetics who  
are all devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**. They all trace their spiritual lineage to a different **Vaishnava** religious  
community, each of which is connected  
with a major Vaishnava figure. By far the  
most populous and powerful of these  
groups is the **Shri sampraday** of the  
**Ramanandi** ascetics, which traces its  
descent through the poet-saint  
**Ramananda** to the southern Indian  
philosopher **Ramanuja**, whom they  
claim as Ramanandaâ€™s **guru**. The **Sanaka**  
**sampraday** of the **Nimbarki** ascetics  
traces its spiritual lineage to the philosopher **Nimbarka**. The **Rudra sampraday**  
of the **Vishnuswami** ascetics traces its  
lineage through the philosopher  
**Vallabhacharya** to an earlier figure,  
Vishnuswami. Finally, the **Brahma sampraday** of the **Gaudiya Vaishnava**  
ascetics traces its spiritual line through  
the Bengali saint **Chaitanya** to the  
southern Indian philosopher **Madhva**.  
Each of these sampradays is differentiated  
not only by its founder but also by its  
patron **deity** or deities. The Ramanandis  
**worship** the god **Rama**, whereas the  
others worship the god **Krishna** and, to  
different extents, his consort, **Radha**.  
Scholars doubt that these groups  
were ever actually connected to the people whom they claim as their founders.  
The distinctions among the sampradays  
appear to be largely academic. Given  
that the overwhelming majority of these  
ascetics are Ramanandis, the others  
seem important only for representing  
the other great Vaishnava religious figures. The distinctions between groups  
are only significant during the bathing  
(**snana**) festival known as the **Kumbha**  
**Mela**, at which they determine the order  
of certain groups in the bathing processions. For more information see Peter  
van der Veer, *Gods on Earth*, 1988.
