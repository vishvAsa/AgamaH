For most Hindus cremation is the  
approved method for disposing of a  
dead body, although one finds **burials** in  
certain circumstances and subcommunities. The body is usually cremated on  
the day of death, often only a few hours  
after the person has expired. Although  
one could see this as a hygienic measure  
in a hot climate, for many Hindus the  
religious reasons are even more compelling. First, a **corpse** is considered to  
be a source of violent impurity  
(**ashaucha**) that is removed by destroying the body by **fire**. A second reason for  
immediate cremation is to get rid of a  
potential vehicle for wandering spirits,  
who according to popular fears, can  
reanimate a corpse.  
The rites leading to cremation begin  
immediately after death. As for all Hindu  
rituals, there is great variation in different regions and communities, but the  
following description gives a general  
picture of these rites, at least in northern  
India: The body is bathed, laid on a bier  
(often made from bamboo, which is  
cheap, strong, and readily available),  
and covered with a cloth (white for a  
man or a **widow**, a colored sari for a  
married woman). In many cases the big  
toes are tied together with a thread, due  
to the belief that this prevents an alien  
spirit from reanimating the body. The  
mourners carry the bier to the **cremation ground**, chanting the traditional  
dirge *Ram Nam Satya Hai*, *Satya Boli*  
*Gati Hai* (“God’s name is Truth, Truth  
spoken is Passage”). On the way, the  
mourners will often halt several times,  
not only to rest but also on the chance  
that the deceased was merely unconscious. When they arrive at the cremation ground (which is often by a river or  
source of **water**), the corpse is bathed  
again and set on a pyre. The chief  
mourner (traditionally the eldest **son**)  
circles the pyre, pouring water from a  
clay pot, which is then broken. Since  
poetic images often compare the  
ephemeral quality of human bodies to  
that of clay pots, this action clearly

Cremation  
Hindu cremation on the Ganges River. Although cremation is the religiously preferred way to  
dispose of a corpse, the relatively high cost of wood makes this difficult for poorer families.  
signifies the final destruction of the  
body. The chief mourner then ignites the  
pyre and remains there while the body  
burns. If the skull does not crack from  
the heat of the fire, he is given a long  
bamboo stick to pierce the skull. This is  
believed to release the **vital winds**  
(**prana**) of the deceased, which have collected in the head. The chief mourner’s  
final duty is to collect bones and ash  
from the pyre (**asthi-sanchayana**), often  
on the following day, and to immerse  
these remains in the **Ganges** or some  
other sacred river (**asthi-visarjana**).  
The wooden pyre is the traditional  
means for cremation and remains the  
preferred method, despite the development of more efficient and cheaper electric crematoria. This has led to an  
unusual ecological problem in modern  
India, particularly in the big cities. Many  
poor people cannot afford to buy  
enough wood to cremate the body with  
a pyre but, because of tradition, are  
unwilling to use electric crematoria.  
They will perform incomplete cremations in which part of the body is left  
unburned. This is a bad state of affairs,  
both from a religious and a public health  
perspective, because the bodies are a  
source of religious impurity and contribute to the contamination of the  
rivers. For further information see
