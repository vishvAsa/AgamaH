(“Journey to a **tirtha**”) The general term  
denoting religious pilgrimage, which is  
seen as an act generating considerable  
religious merit (**punya**). The major focus  
of such travel was a visit to a “crossing  
place” (tirtha), a sacred site or person  
through which one could more easily  
communicate with the worlds beyond.  
One of the major themes in the traditional pilgrimage literature was the  
inherent holiness of whatever place was  
being described at that time, which  
was invariably described as bringing

incalculable benefits, even for actions  
performed unknowingly or in jest. A second and seemingly contradictory theme  
was the stress on the inner state of the  
pilgrims themselves and the warning  
that they would gain no benefits unless  
they were serious about their visit. In its  
ideal, pilgrimage to the holy places was  
not a pleasure tour but a vehicle for spiritual development, through bathing  
(**snana**) in holy rivers, visiting and worshiping powerful **deities**, enduring  
hardships, making **offerings** to the  
ancestors, gift-giving, and living a sober,  
disciplined life.  
In fact, the traditional literature  
affirms both sides of this tension—the  
need for individual commitment and  
the inherent sanctity of the places themselves—although the emphasis may  
shift depending on the needs of the  
moment. One explanation, combining  
both of these themes, is that these holy  
places amplified the effects of all of one’s  
actions there, whether good or bad.  
Pilgrims were thus encouraged to  
benefit from performing meritorious  
actions but warned of the heightened  
consequences from evil deeds, which  
were much more severe than normal.  
In earlier times pilgrimage required a  
large investment of time and money.  
People would often spend months or  
years on pilgrimage, usually visiting a  
series of pilgrimage places. This was  
seen as a religiously meritorious use of  
one’s money, a notion still current in  
contemporary times. For most people,  
such an opportunity would come only  
once in their lifetime, generally in their  
later years, and this long-awaited fulfillment must have heightened their experience. The advent of railroad travel in  
the late 1800s largely reshaped this pattern, although it persisted in the  
**Himalayas** until well into the twentieth  
century. With the advent of railroad travel,  
people were able to visit places with  
relative ease and speed. This convenience encouraged multiple visits, but  
also ones in which the person stopped  
at fewer places on the way.  
The most recent change in pilgrimage patterns has come with the development of tourism, which is being  
marketed by state governments as a way  
to generate income for the local people.  
It cannot be denied that “seeing the  
sights” has always been a part of pilgrimage, which provided a religiously  
sanctioned motive for travel. Yet the  
ideal, then as now, was that this journey  
should not be undertaken merely for  
enjoyment, but for serious purposes.  
Some contemporary Hindus worry that  
the growth of tourism has commercialized the sanctity of their holy places;  
other more sanguine souls consider the  
stress on tourism simply a stronger  
manifestation of trends that have always  
existed, which will have no effect on the  
truly pious.
