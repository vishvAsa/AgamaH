(1856–1920) Maharashtrian political  
activist who was once characterized as  
“the father of Indian unrest.” Unlike his  
Maharashtrian contemporaries **Ranade**  
and **Gokhale**, who stressed working  
within existing institutions, Tilak never  
compromised his conviction that the  
British had no right to rule India. He  
resigned from Gokhale’s reformist group  
in 1890 and devoted himself to educating and organizing ordinary people in  
**Maharashtra**. One vehicle for such  
organizing comprised two newspapers,  
one written in English and one in  
Marathi. The other involved organizing  
and promoting two new festivals. One  
of these festivals was devoted to  
the **Maratha** king **Shivaji**, a regional  
hero who had spent his life fighting

This ascetic’s tika markings indicate that he

domination by the Moghul empire. The  
other festival was **Ganesh Chaturthi**,  
which Tilak promoted as a visible way to  
assert and celebrate a Hindu nationalist  
identity during the time of British imperial rule. Given British power, outright  
rebellion was simply impossible, and  
the British government heavily restricted  
all forms of political dissent. The Ganesh  
festival provided a way to circumvent  
these restrictions because the British  
had a long-standing policy of not interfering with religious observances. Tilak  
was imprisoned several times on the  
charge of inciting political assassinations, but he always returned directly to  
the political fray. Aside from his political  
agitation, his greatest intellectual work  
is a commentary on the **Bhagavad Gita**,  
a religious text, in which he stresses the  
need for this-worldly activism to defeat  
evil, including violence if necessary. See  
also **Moghul dynasty**.
