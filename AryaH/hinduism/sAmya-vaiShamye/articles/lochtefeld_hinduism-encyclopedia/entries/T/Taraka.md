title = "Taraka"

+++
In Hindu mythology, an extremely powerful **demon**, who endures such severe  
physical **asceticism** (**tapas**) that he  
receives a boon that he can be killed  
only by a **son** of the god **Shiva**. This  
boon seems to make Taraka invulnerable because at the time, Shiva is lost in  
meditation and is still grieving for his  
dead wife **Sati**. For a long time Taraka  
grows more powerful and more arrogant  
until he is eventually able to defeat the  
gods in battle and exile them from **heaven**.  
In their despair the gods turn to the god  
of love, **Kama**, and beg him to shoot  
Shiva with an arrow of desire so that he  
689  
Taraka  
will marry the **goddess Parvati**, and thus  
make it possible to bring about Tarakaâ€™s  
death. Shiva, however, destroys Kama  
before he can shoot, burning him to ash  
with a stream of fire from his third eye.  
Shiva later marries Parvati, and their  
son, **Skanda**, kills Taraka in battle.
