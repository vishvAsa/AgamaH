City on the **Cauvery** River in the central  
part of the state of **Tamil Nadu**, and the  
capital of the district with the same  
name. The city’s strategic position  
meant that it was contested by various  
southern Indian dynasties, of which the  
most recent were the **Nayaks** of  
**Madurai**, who built an imposing fort  
on a stone outcrop in the center of the  
city. It is most famous, however, for  
the great temples of **Shrirangam** and  
**Jambukeshvar**, both of which are on an  
island in the Cauvery, north of the city.  
The former is a temple to the god  
**Vishnu**, which has important symbolic  
associations with southern Indian kings  
and kingship; the latter is dedicated to  
the god **Shiva** in his aspect as “Lord of  
the Rose-Apple (**jambu**) Tree.”
