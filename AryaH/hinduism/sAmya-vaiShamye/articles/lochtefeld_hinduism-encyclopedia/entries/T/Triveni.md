title = "Triveni"

+++
(“Triple stream”) Traditional epithet for  
the confluence of the **Ganges** and  
**Yamuna Rivers** in the city of **Allahabad**,  
in the state of **Uttar Pradesh**. Although  
only two rivers can be seen at the confluence, the name Triveni comes from  
the traditional belief that they are joined  
by a third river, the **Saraswati**, which  
flows underground and is unseen to the  
naked eye.
