An **ascetic** initiated into the **Puri** order  
of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**, as can be  
seen from his surname. Tota Puri was  
one of the teachers of the Bengali saint  
**Ramakrishna**, who appeared to instruct  
Ramakrishna in **Advaita Vedanta** as part  
of the latter’s continuing exposure to  
many different types of religious practice. In his earlier religious practice,  
Ramakrishna had been a fervent devotee (**bhakta**) of the **goddess Kali**, whereas the Advaita Vedanta **philosophy**  
claims that behind all things lies a single  
impersonal reality that has no defining  
attributes except for being, consciousness, and bliss (**sacchidananda**). In the  
Advaita understanding, because all conceptions of particular **deities** have specific attributes, they are thus conditioned  
forms of the ultimate **Brahman**  
(Supreme Reality).  
Although this conception ran  
counter to his own previous experience,  
Ramakrishna practiced diligently

form to help the gods regain their immortality.  
experience was the same as that gained  
from his earlier devotional practices.  
This inner experience of identity was  
a pivotal experience for Ramakrishna  
and reinforced his conviction that all  
forms of religious practice led the seeker  
to the same place. After Ramakrishna’s  
experience of enlightenment, Tota  
Puri disappeared.
