(“renunciation”) Practice of renunciation stressed most by **ascetics**, but even  
among this group, some stress it more  
than others. Some ascetics carry this to  
extreme lengths. One famous ascetic,  
Swami **Karpatri**, was famous for receiving the food he was given as alms into  
his cupped hands, signifying the renunciation of an eating-vessel. The most  
extreme examples are ascetics who have  
given up all clothing as a symbol of  
renunciation of conventional standards,  
including shame. The ultimate purpose  
in such renunciation varies with the  
individual, but one of the common  
themes is to serve as a model of how little one really needs to live a happy and  
fulfilling life and thus to illustrate the  
fundamental values that people often  
forget in the bustle of everyday life.  
Many ordinary people also share this  
value in seeking to simplify their lives  
through giving up attachments and  
entanglements.
