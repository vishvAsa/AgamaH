(“The bridge to the Three Holy Cities”)  
Pilgrimage text written by the great  
scholar **Narayana Bhatta** (approx.  
1513–1570) that was intended to give the  
readers precise instructions for correctly  
performing the pilgrimage rites at three  
important sites: **Allahabad**, a bathing  
(**snana**) place at the junction of the  
**Ganges** and **Yamuna Rivers**; **Benares**,  
which is renowned as a city of culture  
and religious learning; and **Gaya** in  
**Bihar**, a major site for the **shraddha**  
rites for the dead. The text begins with a  
710  
Trishanku  
section devoted to pilgrimage in general,  
giving the rules for its performance, and  
continues with three sections giving the  
prescriptions for pilgrimages to  
Allahabad, Benares, and Gaya. The  
Tristhalisetu is an important example of  
the class of commentarial literature  
known as **nibandhas** (“collections”).  
The nibandhas were compendia of  
Hindu lore, in which the compilers  
culled references on a particular theme  
from the **Vedas**, **dharma literature**,  
**puranas**, and other authoritative religious texts, and then compiled these  
excerpts into a single volume, often with  
their own commentary. Narayana  
Bhatta was one of the most learned men  
of his time, and he was attempting to  
define everything precisely, based on his  
sources, so that people would know how  
to do the right thing. The initial section  
of this text has been edited and translated  
by Richard Salomon as *The Bridge to the*  
*Three Holy Cities,* 1985.
