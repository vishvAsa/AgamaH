  <meta property="og:description" content="General term for a genre of secret ritually
based religious practices. These are
most often laid out in texts also known
as tantras (“loom”), so named because
these texts weave a distinctive picture of
reality. In popular Hindu culture, tantric
practitioners (tantrikas) are associated
with illicit sexuality, with consuming
forbidden things such as meat and
liquor, and with having the ability to kill
or harm others through black magic.
Such power and perceived amorality
make tantrikas objects of fear, a quality
that some people have used to their
advantage. A more neutral assessment
of tantra would stress three qualities:
secrecy, power, and nondualism, the
ultimate unity of all things.
Secrecy in tantra serves two functions. On the one hand, it conceals the
rites and practices from the uninitiated,
who are seen as unqualified to receive it,
and on the other, it creates a religious
subcommunity with a particularly
defined identity and sense of privilege.
This sense of exclusivity, of being privy to
something to which few have access, is
one of the reasons that tantra is seen as a
higher religious practice. Even when the
text of a tantra has been written down, it
is always assumed that the texts are lifeless without the instruction of a qualified
person. This stress on personal transmission means that diksha (a type of initiation) is the only way to gain access to this
tradition, and thus tantra stresses the
importance of the guru-disciple relationship even more strongly than does
the Hindu tradition as a whole. Gurus are
free to initiate anyone they deem qualified. Although many tantrikas are twiceborn men, that is, members of the three
highest classes (varnas)—brahmins,
kshatriyas, and vaishyas—who have
received the adolescent religious initiation known as the second birth, in theory
tantric practice is open to all people,
regardless of gender or social status.
Power in tantra is manifested in various ways. One of these comes in the
transmission of the teaching itself, in
which the guru’s empowerment is
believed necessary to “activate” the
transmitted material, particularly
mantras. Tantric practice is also claimed
to be far more powerful than regular religious practice and thus more efficacious
in bringing final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The usual claim is that tantra’s
potency can bring such liberation in a
single lifetime, whereas other forms of
religious practice take untold aeons.
Such powerful forces must be kept secret
from the uninitiated, thus the stress on
secrecy. It is widely accepted that the
spiritual attainments gained through
tantric practice also bring superhuman
powers (siddhi), as a natural byproduct
of such attainment. Although aspirants
are discouraged from seeking such powers because the act of seeking is seen as
rooted in selfish desire, those who gain
such powers without seeking are
believed to be able to exercise them
without being corrupted.
For tantrikas, nondualism—the
assertion that all reality is ultimately one
thing—is both a philosophical affirmation and the operative principle behind
their religious practice. Tantrikas usually
conceive of this unity theistically, seeing
their chosen deity (ishtadevata) as the
material, efficient, and final cause of all
reality. For tantrikas, definitively realizing the essential oneness of all things
removes the mistaken understanding
that causes bondage and rebirth and
brings final liberation. Tantric practice
affirms this nondualism, often through
rituals stressing the unification of opposites. For this reason, some tantrikas
make ritual use of things that are normally forbidden, most notably the “Five
Forbidden Things” (panchamakara):
fish, wine, meat, parched grain, and sexual intercourse. In theory, this rite is a
means to break down duality because it
violates societal norms forbidding consumption of intoxicants, nonvegetarian
food, and illicit sexuality, in a conscious
effort to sacralize what is normally
688
Tantra
forbidden. Although this rite collapses
conventional boundaries of good and
bad, pure and impure, the goal is to
replace external rites (bahiryaga) with
interior ones (antaryaga), thus exploding the duality of subject and object. The
paradigm for this interior practice is
tantric yoga. This is usually some variant of kundalini yoga, in which the two
divine principles of Shiva and Shakti
are ultimately united in the expert’s
subtle body. The final vehicle for tantric
practice comes in rituals using symbolic
diagrams (yantra), of which one example is the shrichakra. These are often
particular to specific tantric lineages
(parampara) and thus ground the
aspirant in a particular tradition. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
1978; Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three

  <p>General term for a genre of secret ritually<br>
based religious practices. These are<br>
most often laid out in texts also known<br>
as tantras (“loom”), so named because<br>
these texts weave a distinctive picture of<br>
reality. In popular Hindu culture, tantric<br>
practitioners (<strong>tantrikas</strong>) are associated<br>
with illicit sexuality, with consuming<br>
forbidden things such as meat and<br>
<strong>liquor</strong>, and with having the ability to kill<br>
or harm others through black <strong>magic</strong>.<br>
Such power and perceived amorality<br>
make tantrikas objects of fear, a quality<br>
that some people have used to their<br>
advantage. A more neutral assessment<br>
of tantra would stress three qualities:<br>
secrecy, power, and nondualism, the<br>
ultimate unity of all things.<br>
Secrecy in tantra serves two functions. On the one hand, it conceals the<br>
rites and practices from the uninitiated,<br>
who are seen as unqualified to receive it,<br>
and on the other, it creates a religious<br>
subcommunity with a particularly<br>
defined identity and sense of privilege.<br>
This sense of exclusivity, of being privy to<br>
something to which few have access, is<br>
one of the reasons that tantra is seen as a<br>
higher religious practice. Even when the<br>
text of a tantra has been written down, it<br>
is always assumed that the texts are lifeless without the instruction of a qualified<br>
person. This stress on personal transmission means that <strong>diksha</strong> (a type of <strong>initiation</strong>) is the only way to gain access to this<br>
tradition, and thus tantra stresses the<br>
importance of the <strong>guru</strong>-disciple relationship even more strongly than does<br>
the Hindu tradition as a whole. Gurus are<br>
free to initiate anyone they deem qualified. Although many tantrikas are <strong>twiceborn</strong> men, that is, members of the three<br>
highest classes (<strong>varnas</strong>)—<strong>brahmins</strong>,<br>
<strong>kshatriyas</strong>, and <strong>vaishyas</strong>—who have<br>
received the adolescent religious initiation known as the second birth, in theory<br>
tantric practice is open to all people,<br>
regardless of gender or social status.<br>
Power in tantra is manifested in various ways. One of these comes in the<br>
transmission of the teaching itself, in<br>
which the guru’s empowerment is<br>
believed necessary to “activate” the<br>
transmitted material, particularly<br>
<strong>mantras</strong>. Tantric practice is also claimed<br>
to be far more powerful than regular religious practice and thus more efficacious<br>
in bringing final liberation of the soul<br>
(<strong>moksha</strong>). The usual claim is that tantra’s<br>
potency can bring such liberation in a<br>
single lifetime, whereas other forms of<br>
religious practice take untold aeons.<br>
Such powerful forces must be kept secret<br>
from the uninitiated, thus the stress on<br>
secrecy. It is widely accepted that the<br>
spiritual attainments gained through<br>
tantric practice also bring superhuman<br>
powers (<strong>siddhi</strong>), as a natural byproduct<br>
of such attainment. Although aspirants<br>
are discouraged from seeking such powers because the act of seeking is seen as<br>
rooted in selfish desire, those who gain<br>
such powers without seeking are<br>
believed to be able to exercise them<br>
without being corrupted.<br>
For tantrikas, nondualism—the<br>
assertion that all reality is ultimately one<br>
thing—is both a philosophical affirmation and the operative principle behind<br>
their religious practice. Tantrikas usually<br>
conceive of this unity theistically, seeing<br>
their chosen <strong>deity</strong> (<strong>ishtadevata</strong>) as the<br>
material, efficient, and final cause of all<br>
reality. For tantrikas, definitively realizing the essential oneness of all things<br>
removes the mistaken understanding<br>
that causes bondage and rebirth and<br>
brings final liberation. Tantric practice<br>
affirms this nondualism, often through<br>
rituals stressing the unification of opposites. For this reason, some tantrikas<br>
make ritual use of things that are normally forbidden, most notably the “Five<br>
Forbidden Things” (<strong>panchamakara</strong>):<br>
fish, wine, meat, parched grain, and sexual intercourse. In theory, this rite is a<br>
means to break down duality because it<br>
violates societal norms forbidding consumption of <strong>intoxicants</strong>, nonvegetarian<br>
food, and illicit sexuality, in a conscious<br>
effort to sacralize what is normally<br>
688<br>
Tantra<br>
forbidden. Although this rite collapses<br>
conventional boundaries of good and<br>
bad, pure and impure, the goal is to<br>
replace external rites (<strong>bahiryaga</strong>) with<br>
interior ones (<strong>antaryaga</strong>), thus exploding the duality of subject and object. The<br>
paradigm for this interior practice is<br>
tantric <strong>yoga</strong>. This is usually some variant of <strong>kundalini yoga</strong>, in which the two<br>
divine principles of <strong>Shiva</strong> and <strong>Shakti</strong><br>
are ultimately united in the expert’s<br>
<strong>subtle body</strong>. The final vehicle for tantric<br>
practice comes in rituals using symbolic<br>
diagrams (<strong>yantra</strong>), of which one example is the <strong>shrichakra</strong>. These are often<br>
particular to specific tantric lineages<br>
(<strong>parampara</strong>) and thus ground the<br>
aspirant in a particular tradition. For<br>
