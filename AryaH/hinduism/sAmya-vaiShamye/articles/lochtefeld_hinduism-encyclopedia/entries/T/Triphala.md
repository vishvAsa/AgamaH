Another name for the **Urdhvapundra**,  
the characteristic forehead mark of  
renunciant **ascetics** who are devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**. Although  
there is considerable variation, the basic  
form is three vertical lines, in contrast to  
the three horizontal lines worn by  
**Shaivite** ascetics. See **Urdhvapundra**.
