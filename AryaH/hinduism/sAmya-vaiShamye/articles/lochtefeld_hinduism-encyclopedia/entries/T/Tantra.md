General term for a genre of secret ritually  
based religious practices. These are  
most often laid out in texts also known  
as tantras (“loom”), so named because  
these texts weave a distinctive picture of  
reality. In popular Hindu culture, tantric  
practitioners (**tantrikas**) are associated  
with illicit sexuality, with consuming  
forbidden things such as meat and  
**liquor**, and with having the ability to kill  
or harm others through black **magic**.  
Such power and perceived amorality  
make tantrikas objects of fear, a quality  
that some people have used to their  
advantage. A more neutral assessment  
of tantra would stress three qualities:  
secrecy, power, and nondualism, the  
ultimate unity of all things.  
Secrecy in tantra serves two functions. On the one hand, it conceals the  
rites and practices from the uninitiated,  
who are seen as unqualified to receive it,  
and on the other, it creates a religious  
subcommunity with a particularly  
defined identity and sense of privilege.  
This sense of exclusivity, of being privy to  
something to which few have access, is  
one of the reasons that tantra is seen as a  
higher religious practice. Even when the  
text of a tantra has been written down, it  
is always assumed that the texts are lifeless without the instruction of a qualified  
person. This stress on personal transmission means that **diksha** (a type of **initiation**) is the only way to gain access to this  
tradition, and thus tantra stresses the  
importance of the **guru**-disciple relationship even more strongly than does  
the Hindu tradition as a whole. Gurus are  
free to initiate anyone they deem qualified. Although many tantrikas are **twiceborn** men, that is, members of the three  
highest classes (**varnas**)—**brahmins**,  
**kshatriyas**, and **vaishyas**—who have  
received the adolescent religious initiation known as the second birth, in theory  
tantric practice is open to all people,  
regardless of gender or social status.  
Power in tantra is manifested in various ways. One of these comes in the  
transmission of the teaching itself, in  
which the guru’s empowerment is  
believed necessary to “activate” the  
transmitted material, particularly  
**mantras**. Tantric practice is also claimed  
to be far more powerful than regular religious practice and thus more efficacious  
in bringing final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). The usual claim is that tantra’s  
potency can bring such liberation in a  
single lifetime, whereas other forms of  
religious practice take untold aeons.  
Such powerful forces must be kept secret  
from the uninitiated, thus the stress on  
secrecy. It is widely accepted that the  
spiritual attainments gained through  
tantric practice also bring superhuman  
powers (**siddhi**), as a natural byproduct  
of such attainment. Although aspirants  
are discouraged from seeking such powers because the act of seeking is seen as  
rooted in selfish desire, those who gain  
such powers without seeking are  
believed to be able to exercise them  
without being corrupted.  
For tantrikas, nondualism—the  
assertion that all reality is ultimately one  
thing—is both a philosophical affirmation and the operative principle behind  
their religious practice. Tantrikas usually  
conceive of this unity theistically, seeing  
their chosen **deity** (**ishtadevata**) as the  
material, efficient, and final cause of all  
reality. For tantrikas, definitively realizing the essential oneness of all things  
removes the mistaken understanding  
that causes bondage and rebirth and  
brings final liberation. Tantric practice  
affirms this nondualism, often through  
rituals stressing the unification of opposites. For this reason, some tantrikas  
make ritual use of things that are normally forbidden, most notably the “Five  
Forbidden Things” (**panchamakara**):  
fish, wine, meat, parched grain, and sexual intercourse. In theory, this rite is a  
means to break down duality because it  
violates societal norms forbidding consumption of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian  
food, and illicit sexuality, in a conscious  
effort to sacralize what is normally  
688  
Tantra  
forbidden. Although this rite collapses  
conventional boundaries of good and  
bad, pure and impure, the goal is to  
replace external rites (**bahiryaga**) with  
interior ones (**antaryaga**), thus exploding the duality of subject and object. The  
paradigm for this interior practice is  
tantric **yoga**. This is usually some variant of **kundalini yoga**, in which the two  
divine principles of **Shiva** and **Shakti**  
are ultimately united in the expert’s  
**subtle body**. The final vehicle for tantric  
practice comes in rituals using symbolic  
diagrams (**yantra**), of which one example is the **shrichakra**. These are often  
particular to specific tantric lineages  
(**parampara**) and thus ground the  
aspirant in a particular tradition. For
