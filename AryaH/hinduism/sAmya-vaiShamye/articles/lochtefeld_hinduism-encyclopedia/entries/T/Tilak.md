+++
A mark on the forehead, also colloquially  
known as a **tika**, made from colored  
powders mixed with oil, sandalwood  
paste, or cosmetics. These forehead  
marks are applied for various reasons:  
for sheer ornamentation, to indicate  
sectarian affiliation, or as an outward  
symbol of having worshiped in a temple  
that day. See **tika**.
