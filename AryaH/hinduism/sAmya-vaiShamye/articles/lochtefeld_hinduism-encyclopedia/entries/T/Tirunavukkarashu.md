(7th c.) This was the given name of the  
**Nayanar** poet-saint most commonly  
referred to as **Appar** (“father”). Appar  
was one of the earliest of the Nayanars, a  
group of sixty-three southern Indian  
poet-saints who were devotees (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva** and who lived in southern India in the seventh and eighth centuries. Along with their contemporaries  
the **Alvars**, who were devotees of  
**Vishnu**, the Nayanars spearheaded the  
revitalization of Hindu religion through  
their passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a  
personal god, conveyed through hymns  
sung in the **Tamil language**.
