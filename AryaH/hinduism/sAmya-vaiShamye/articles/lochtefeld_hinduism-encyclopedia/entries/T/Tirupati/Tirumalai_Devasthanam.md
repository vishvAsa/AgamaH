title = "Tirupati/Tirumalai Devasthanam"

+++
Official name for the managing committee of the **Venkateshvara** temple, near  
the town of **Tirupati** in the state of  
**Andhra Pradesh**. This temple is the  
richest one in India, based largely on the  
popular belief that any wish made in the  
**deityâ€™s** presence will invariably come  
true. In earlier times all of the temple  
receipts were taken by the priests running the temple, but since Indian independence in 1947, the temple  
committee has been responsible for  
them. The committee has channeled  
these funds into hundreds of charities,  
but particularly into education and temple building: the former in schools from  
702  
Tirumalisai  
the primary to the university level, and  
the latter in providing the funds to help  
build many of the larger Hindu temples  
in the United States and Europe.
