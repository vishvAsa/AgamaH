title = "Tika"

+++
In modern **Hindi**, a word denoting  
either a commentary on a text or a colored mark (often red vermilion) on one’s  
forehead. These forehead marks are  
applied for various reasons: for sheer  
ornamentation, to indicate sectarian  
affiliation, or as an outward symbol of  
having worshiped in a temple that day  
(since a common element in this **worship** is to receive some of the vermilion  
daubed on the feet of the **deity’s** image,  
as a sign of **grace** and one’s subordinate  
status). The former of these two meanings is the original sense of the word, but  
the latter meaning is far more common  
in contemporary times. The connection  
between these two meanings could be  
the notion that just as a primary text is  
ornamented and highlighted by a commentary, in the same way a forehead  
mark could ornament the body.
