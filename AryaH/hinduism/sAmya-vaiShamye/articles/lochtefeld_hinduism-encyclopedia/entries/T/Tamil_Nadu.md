title = "Tamil Nadu"

+++
(“land of the Tamils”) Modern Indian  
state at the southern tip of the subcontinent, on the Bay of Bengal. Tamil Nadu  
is one of the so-called linguistic states,  
formed after Indian independence in  
1947 to unite people with a common  
language and culture under one state  
government. Tamil Nadu was thus  
formed from the Tamil-speaking areas  
of the former state of Madras. Tamil  
Nadu has a long and rich history, and  
the Tamil literary tradition stretches  
back to the early centuries of the common era. Successive regional dynasties—the **Pallavas**, **Cholas**, and  
**Pandyas**—built a host of temples in the  
characteristic **Dravida** architectural  
style, and even today Tamil Nadu has  
hundreds of temple towns, that is,  
towns in which the urban hub is an  
enormous temple complex that includes  
shops, markets, offices, and residential  
space. Modern Tamil culture is the product of this long and ancient tradition,  
and Tamils pride themselves in having  
been influenced little by outsiders—neither by the Hindu influences from  
northern India, nor by the Muslim culture whose influence was so profound in  
regions farther north. Tamil Nadu has so  
many cultural sites and holy places that  
it is impossible to name them, but the  
most important are **Rameshvaram**,  
**Chidambaram**, **Madurai**, **Tiruchirappalli**, **Kanchipuram**, **Mahabalipuram**,  
**Kumbhakonam**, **Thiruvaiyaru**, **Tanjore**,  
and **Kanyakumari**; there is also a network of six temples to the god **Murugan**  
scattered in different areas of the state,  
685  
Tamil Nadu  
which between them lay out the  
parameters of the Tamil country. For

Nadu and all the regions of India, an
