title = "Tirumalisai"

+++
(9th c.) One of the **Alvars**, a group of  
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
stress on passionate devotion (**bhakti**)  
to a personal god, conveyed through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**,  
transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. According to tradition,  
Tirumalisai was the son of a sage and a  
celestial nymph (**apsara**), who was  
abandoned by his parents at birth. He  
was found and raised by a man of very  
humble status who called his foster son  
by the name of their village. For further  
information see Kamil Zvelebil, *Tamil*  
*Literature*, 1975.
