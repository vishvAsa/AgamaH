title = "Tulsidas Jayanti"

+++
Festival falling on the seventh day  
of the bright (waxing) half of the **lunar**  
**month** of **Shravan** (July–August), celebrating the birthday of the medieval  
devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saint **Tulsidas**  
(1532–1623). Tulsidas composed many  
different texts, and he is one of the few  
medieval poet-saints believed to have  
been literate and to have actually written down his work. His most celebrated  
text is the **Ramcharitmanas**, a vernacular retelling of the epic **Ramayana**.
