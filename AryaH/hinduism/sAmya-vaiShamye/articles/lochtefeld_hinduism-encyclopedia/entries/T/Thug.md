title = "Thug"

In the colonialist mythology describing  
the savagery of the East and the demonic  
qualities of Hinduism, one of the most  
compelling stories is that of the Thugs, a  
group of robbers who were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the **goddess Kali**. According  
to popular belief, the Thugs were widespread throughout India and frequented  
the highways, seeking travelers as their  
prey. They would travel with their victims, sometimes for days on end, and  
then kill them—sometimes after giving  
them sweets laced with **drugs**, and  
sometimes simply by taking them by  
surprise. The victims would be strangled  
with a silken scarf, and whenever possible, no **blood** would be shed, for the victims’ blood was considered an **offering**  
to the goddess Kali and thus should not  
be spilled and wasted. The victims’  
worldly possessions were claimed by the  
Thugs themselves, in a division of the  
spoils between **deity** and devotee. This  
demonic practice persisted until the  
1830s, when it was finally uprooted and  
destroyed by the British.  
Although the tale of the Thugs makes  
a gripping story, much of it has been dispelled by more careful recent scholarship. One of the major factors in the rise  
of the Thugs was the radical economic  
dislocation caused by the arrival of the  
British themselves. Many of the people  
marginalized by these forces took to  
wandering and, in their desperation,  
resorted to banditry. These small-scale  
and essentially local depredations were  
transformed into a widespread religious  
conspiracy. The myth of the Thugs certainly showed concern about the prevailing law-and-order situation in  
central India, but it may also have  
reflected British colonial fears about  
their ability to control their territory.  
Even though there are references to the  
Thugs in texts predating British contact,  
on the whole, this was one of the more  
enduring colonial stereotypes. For further information see C. A. Bayly, *Indian*
