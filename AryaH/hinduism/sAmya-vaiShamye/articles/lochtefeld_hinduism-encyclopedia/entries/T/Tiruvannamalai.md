title = "Tiruvannamalai"

+++
Temple town and sacred site (**tirtha**) in  
the northern part of the state of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, about 100 miles southwest of  
Madras, the capital. Tiruvannamalai is  
most famous as a temple to the god  
**Shiva** in his form as Arunachaleshvar,  
“the Lord of Arunachal [Hill],” the  
hill on which the temple is built.  
Tiruvannamalai is also one of the  
**bhutalingas** (“elemental **lingas**”), a network of five southern Indian sites sacred  
to Shiva. In each of these sites, Shiva is  
worshiped as a linga, the pillar-shaped  
object that is his symbolic form, and at  
each site the linga is believed to be formed  
from one of the five primordial **elements**  
(bhuta)—**earth**, **wind**, **fire**, **water**, and  
**space** (**akasha**). Tiruvannamalai’s linga is  
associated with the primordial element  
of fire, making this an extremely  
powerful image. Aside from the image  
and the temple, Tiruvannamalai is also  
famous as the place in which the modern Indian saint **Ramana Maharshi**  
spent most of his life, from 1896 until his  
death in 1950.
