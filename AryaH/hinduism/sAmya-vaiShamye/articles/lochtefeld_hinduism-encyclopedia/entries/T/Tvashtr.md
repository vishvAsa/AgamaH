title = "Tvashtr"

+++
(“maker of carriages”) In the **Vedas**, the  
oldest and most authoritative Hindu  
religious texts, Tvashtr is a minor **deity**  
known as the workman of the Vedic  
gods. The Vedic hymns frequently mention wheeled chariots as military  
devices, and his name’s literal meaning  
shows the esteem in which this craft was  
held, as the apex of creative work. In the  
Vedas, Tvashtr is famous for crafting the  
weapons of the gods, especially the  
mace with which the storm-god **Indra**  
slays the serpent **Vrtra** (**Rg Veda** 1.32). In  
later times Tvashtr is identified with  
the minor deity **Vishvakarma**, who in  
later Hindu life becomes the architect  
and craftsman of the gods. Since Tvashtr  
has a much older textual presence  
than Vishvakarma, this seems to be  
an attempt to identify one divine  
workman as another, based on their  
similar functions.
