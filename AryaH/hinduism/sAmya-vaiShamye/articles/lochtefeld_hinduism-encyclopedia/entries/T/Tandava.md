title = "Tandava"

+++
Name denoting one of the two broad  
categories in Indian **dance**. The tandava  
style is athletic and dramatic and conveys violence and power, whereas the  
other dance form, **lasya**, is soft and lyrical and conveys a mood of love. The tandava style received its name from the  
tandava dance of the god **Shiva**.  
According to tradition, this is the dance  
through which Shiva destroys the world  
when its time has come. Not all of the  
danceâ€™s mythic connotations are violent,  
since this athletic dance is also said to  
be the one through which Shiva vanquished the **goddess Kali** in a dance  
contest, when her feminine modesty  
prevented her from imitating his style.
