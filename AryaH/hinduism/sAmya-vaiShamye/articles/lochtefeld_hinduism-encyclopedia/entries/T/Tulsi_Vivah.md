Festival marking the marriage of the  
**goddess Lakshmi** and the god **Vishnu**,  
713  
Tulsi Vivah  
celebrated on the eleventh day of the  
bright (waxing) half of the **lunar month**  
of **Kartik**. It is also celebrated as  
**Devotthayan Ekadashi**. On this day  
devotees (**bhakta**) place a **shalagram** (a  
black stone containing the spiralshaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea  
creature, understood as a “self-manifest” form of Vishnu) in a pot containing  
a **tulsi** plant (considered a form of  
Lakshmi). Thus they symbolically unite  
Vishnu and Lakshmi and perform the  
**marriage ceremony** for them, complete  
with festive songs.
