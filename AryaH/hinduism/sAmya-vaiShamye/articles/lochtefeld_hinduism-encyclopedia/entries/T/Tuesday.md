title = "Tuesday"

+++
(Mangalvar) The third day of the **week**,  
presided over by the **planet Mars**  
(Mangal). The planet Mars is deemed  
inauspicious, both because of its red  
color (reminiscent of **blood**) and  
because of its associations with war and  
disorder. Tuesday is widely considered  
an unlucky day, and many people  
abstain from certain kinds of activity on  
it. Travel is particularly discouraged  
unless absolutely necessary. Cutting the  
**hair** and beard is also discouraged, and  
in much of northern India, barbers take  
Tuesday off. To counter the day’s potential **inauspiciousness**, many people also  
perform **rites of protection**, such as  
worshiping strong protective **deities**  
such as **Hanuman**—who is close  
enough to human beings to understand  
the problems they face, but divine  
enough to be able to protect them.  
Paradoxically, the literal meaning of the  
name for Tuesday is the “auspicious”  
(mangal) day. Giving it this euphemistic  
name may simply be a bit of reverse  
**magic**; that if one calls it the lucky day, it  
may, in fact, turn out to be.
