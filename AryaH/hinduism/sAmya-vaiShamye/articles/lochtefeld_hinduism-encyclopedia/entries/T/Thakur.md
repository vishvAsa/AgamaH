(“master”) The model for traditional  
Indian society was as a collection of  
**endogamous** subgroups (i.e., groups in  
which marriages occurred only between  
members of the same group) known as  
**jatis** (“birth”). These jatis were organized (and their social status determined) by the group’s hereditary  
occupation, over which each group had  
a monopoly. In northern India, the  
Thakurs were a jati considered to be  
**kshatriyas**, who have traditionally functioned as landlords and village leaders.  
Its most famous member was the Nobel  
laureate **Rabindranath Tagore**.
