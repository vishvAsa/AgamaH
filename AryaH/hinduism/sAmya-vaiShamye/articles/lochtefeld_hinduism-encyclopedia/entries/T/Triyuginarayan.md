title = "Triyuginarayan"

+++
Village and sacred site (**tirtha**) in  
the **Mandakini River** valley in the  
**Garhwal** region of the **Himalayas**,  
fifteen miles down from **Kedarnath**. The  
site for Triyuginarayan is on the top  
of a mountain, surrounded by forest.  
Triyuginarayanâ€™s major temple is dedicated to the god **Vishnu** in his form as  
**Narayana**, and in front of the temple is a  
pit in which a **fire** is said to have been  
smoldering for the past three cosmic  
ages (triyugi). According to its charter  
myth, Triyuginarayan is the site at which  
the **deities Shiva** and **Parvati** were married, a ceremony to which this continuously smoldering fire (in its guise as  
**Agni**, the fire-god) stands as the witness.
