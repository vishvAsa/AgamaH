The model for traditional Indian society  
was as a collection of **endogamous** subgroups (i.e., groups in which marriages  
occurred only between members of the  
same group) known as **jatis** (“birth”).  
These jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group had a monopoly. Although it  
sounds bizarre, this specialization  
extended to all occupations, and there  
were hereditary occupational groups  
whose profession was thievery and banditry. The most famous individual from  
these was **Tirumangai** (9th c.), by far the  
most picturesque of the **Alvars**, a group  
of twelve poet-saints who lived in southern India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. In the nineteenth century the  
British composed a list of several hundred such groups, who were subject to  
relentless scrutiny, opposition, and in  
many cases resettlement.
