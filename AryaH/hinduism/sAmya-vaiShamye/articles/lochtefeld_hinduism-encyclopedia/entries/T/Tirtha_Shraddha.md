title = "Tirtha Shraddha"

+++
Name for a particular type of **shraddha**  
(ancestral memorial rite) performed  
when visiting a pilgrimage place  
(**tirtha**). A shraddha has two major features: symbolically feeding one’s ancestor(s) by **offering** balls of cooked grain  
(**pindas**), and feeding real food to a  
group of **brahmins** representing one’s  
ancestors. Tirtha shraddhas belong to a  
class of action known as occasional  
actions (**naimittika karma**) because  
they are incumbent only under certain  
conditions. Under ordinary circumstances one would not have to perform  
this action, but it becomes required  
when one visits a pilgrimage place. The  
traditional pilgrimage literature, much  
of it clearly written by the brahmins who  
received such meals and other gifts, is  
emphatic that this obligation should not  
be neglected.
