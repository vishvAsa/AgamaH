title = "Tripurari"

+++
Epithet of **Shiva** as the enemy (ari) of the  
Triple City (**Tripura**). According to the  
mythic charter, three **demons** are  
dismayed by their continuing defeats at  
the hands of the gods, and they begin to  
perform harsh **asceticism** (**tapas**) to find  
the means to counter this. The god  
**Brahma** finally comes to them, willing  
to reward them with boons. However,  
when the demons learn that absolute  
invulnerability is impossible, they lay  
down the condition that each of them  
should build a city that can move over  
the earth, which will come together only  
once in a long time, and that these cities  
can be destroyed only by a single arrow  
that pierces through them all at the  
same time.  
This boon renders the demons practically invulnerable, and they proceed to  
build three magnificent cities—one of  
iron, one of silver, and one of gold. They  
grow rich and prosperous, but over time  
they are corrupted by power and began  
to oppress the earth. Finally the gods  
petition Brahma for help, and Brahma  
informs them that the only one with the  
strength to fulfill this condition is the  
god Shiva. The gods build him a bow  
and arrow, and when the conjunction of  
the three cities takes place, Shiva sends a  
709  
Tripurari  
An ascetic wearing tripundra markings,  
three horizontal lines that indicate he  
is a devotee of the god Shiva.  
single arrow through all three, kindling a  
fire that burns the cities and destroys  
their inhabitants.  
This story illustrates one important  
facet of Shiva’s character—unlike the  
god **Vishnu**, who often manages to trick  
those he subdues, Shiva is much less  
complex and attains his end by using  
power against which no one can stand.  
In some of the stories, one of the three  
demons is himself a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
Shiva, and when the arrow is loosed and  
hurtles to destroy the Triple City, Shiva  
himself rescues his devotee and his  
family. This is in character, for Shiva is  
portrayed as gracious to his devotees  
and will do just about anything for  
them. It also shows that the demons are  
conceived not as completely debased  
but as another race of beings with  
different powers and capacities, and  
who have as much potential as **deities**  
and human beings.
