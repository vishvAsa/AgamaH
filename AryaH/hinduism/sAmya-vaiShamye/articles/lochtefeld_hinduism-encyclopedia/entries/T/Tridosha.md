title = "Tridosha"

+++
In **ayurveda**, the term for the set of three  
bodily humours, **vata** (“air”), **pitta**  
(“bile”), and **kapha** (“phlegm”). Each of  
these humours is associated with certain physiological tendencies, particularly with regard to digestion and  
metabolism. Every person has all three  
of these humours, although one of them  
is generally dominant. In a healthy person the three humours are in general  
equilibrium, but an imbalance can lead  
to illness or chronic health problems.  
The solution to these lies in regaining  
the proper balance between the doshas,  
or humours, for which one of the major  
solutions is **eating** a proper diet.
