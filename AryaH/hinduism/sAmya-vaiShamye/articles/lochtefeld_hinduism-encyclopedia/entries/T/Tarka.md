(“reasoning”) In Indian logic, tarka  
denotes the mode of argument that  
focuses on the identification and classification of **fallacies**. When it is used in  
argumentation, tarka does not advance  
one’s own point of view but is used to  
discredit an opponent’s assertion, either  
by reducing it to absurdity, by showing  
that the argument does not fulfill

necessary conditions, or by showing  
that it suffers from a fallacy that  
renders it untenable.
