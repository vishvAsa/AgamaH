title = "Tarjini Hasta"

+++
In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual,  
tarjini hasta is the name for a particular  
hand **gesture** (**hasta**) in which the hand  
is closed except for the index finger,  
which is pointing upward as if to  
admonish or scold the viewer. The word  
*tarjini* is derived from a verb that can  
mean either “to threaten” or “to censure”—both of which can be understood  
from this gesture.
