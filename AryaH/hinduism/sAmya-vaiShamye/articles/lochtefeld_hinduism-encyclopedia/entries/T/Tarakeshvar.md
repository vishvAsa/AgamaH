title = "Tarakeshvar"

+++
City and sacred site (**tirtha**) thirty miles  
northwest of Calcutta in the state of  
**West Bengal**, which because of its proximity to Calcutta, is the most widely visited pilgrimage place in the state.  
Tarakeshvar is famous for the temple of  
**Baba** Tarakanath, who is the god **Shiva**  
in his form as the “Lord of Liberation.”  
Shiva is present at Tarakeshvar in the  
form of a **linga**, the pillar-shaped object  
that is Shiva’s symbolic form. The  
Tarakeshvar linga is claimed to be a  
“self-manifested” (**svayambhu**) image,  
which was not made by human hands  
but established through an act of divine  
self-revelation. The site’s charter myth  
describes how the linga of Shiva is  
buried in the **earth** but is discovered  
when a **cow** habitually lets down her  
milk on the spot above it as an act of  
**worship**. The charter myth also  
describes how a man afflicted with agonizing hemorrhoids finds relief by  
drinking the **water** that has been poured  
on the linga as an **offering** and thus is  
blessed by Shiva’s touch. With these two  
stories, the charter conveys the image of  
a **deity** who is present and responsive to  
his devotees (**bhakta**) as well as the  
sense of a place where human beings  
can go to find relief from their afflictions. One of the most unusual manifestations of this is the practice of **dharna**,  
in which pilgrims lie on the temple’s  
outer porch, fasting (**upavasa**) for as  
long as it takes the deity to communicate with them, usually in a **dream**. For  
further information see E. Alan Morinis,
