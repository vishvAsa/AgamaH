title = "Thursday"

+++
(Brhaspativar) The fifth day of the **week**,  
whose presiding **planet** is **Jupiter**  
(**Brhaspati**). Since in Hindu mythology  
the sage **Brhaspati** is the religious preceptor (**guru**) of the gods, another common name for Thursday is Guruvar. In  
Hindu astrology (**jyotisha**) Jupiter is an  
extremely powerful planet, and because  
in religious life one’s spiritual preceptor  
is often likened to a god, this makes  
Thursday a ritually important and powerful day. One of the “**deities**” to be honored and served on this day is one’s  
religious preceptor.  
Another deity worshiped on this day  
is the **goddess Lakshmi**, who is worshiped mainly by **women**. Lakshmi is  
the wife of the god **Vishnu** and the  
embodiment of wealth, prosperity, and  
good fortune, which she brings with her  
wherever she goes and removes when  
she leaves. As the human counterpart to  
Lakshmi, married women **worship** her  
to obtain these things or to retain them  
if they already have them. Because it is  
well known that good fortune is not permanent and can often change, Lakshmi  
is also seen as a capricious and somewhat fickle divine presence. One of the  
taboos for women, at least in parts of  
696  
Thug  
northern India, is changing their jewelry  
on that day because this is said to annoy  
Lakshmi and raise the danger that she  
might depart because of her vexation.
