title = "Truth, Power of"

+++
In popular Hindu belief, truth is seen as  
having magical power of its own, a  
power to which people can appeal in  
their time of distress. One way of  
appealing to this power is through the  
famous **act of truth**, a conditional statement in which the first part is a true  
statement about one’s past behavior and  
the second part a request for some specific result (for example, “If I have always  
given to those who begged from me,  
may this fire not burn me”). The power  
of truth was also invoked in trial by  
**ordeal** and was seen as the power  
that made the ordeal a valid means of  
testing people.
