Traditional Indian society was modeled  
as a collection of **endogamous**, or intermarried, subgroups known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). These jatis were organized  
(and their social status determined) by  
the group’s hereditary occupation, over  
which each group had a monopoly. In  
traditional northern Indian society, the  
Telis were a Hindu jati whose hereditary  
occupation was making vegetable oil by  
pressing oil seeds.
