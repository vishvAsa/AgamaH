title = "Trika"

+++
Kashmiri religious community whose  
members were devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**; the greatest figure in the  
Trika school was the tenth-century  
philosopher and aesthetic theorist  
**Abhinavagupta**. Trika Shaivism is a  
tantric tradition—that is, a secret, ritually  
based religious practice—whose philosophical underpinnings merge two  
philosophical positions, theism and  
monism. Theism is the notion that a  
divinity is the Supreme Reality in the  
universe, whereas monism conceives a  
more abstract principle as the basis of  
all reality. For Trika Shaivism, the sole  
true reality is the god Shiva, who is both  
Supreme God and the source for emanations from which the material universe  
is formed. Final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**) comes through a process of  
“recognition” (**pratyabhijna**), in which  
one realizes that the entire universe is  
nothing but a manifestation of Shiva  
alone. Here one “recognizes” something  
that has always been true but until that  
time had been obscured by a mistaken  
understanding. For further information  
see Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, *The*  
*Triadic Heart of Siva*, 1989. See also  
**tantra** and **Shaiva**.
