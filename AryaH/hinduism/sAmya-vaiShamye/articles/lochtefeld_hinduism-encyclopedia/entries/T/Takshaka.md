title = "Takshaka"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a venomous serpent-king from whose bite King  
**Parikshit** is killed. After insulting a powerful sage, Parikshit is cursed to die of a  
snakebite within seven days. Parikshit  
takes all possible precautions to avoid  
his fate: He builds a house on a huge pillar, has all things entering the house  
carefully searched, and surrounds himself with physicians who can cure  
snakebite. Six days pass without incident, but as the seventh day ends, people begin to relax and bring in some fruit  
to eat. Takshaka has concealed himself  
as a tiny worm in one of the pieces of  
fruit and, when the fruit is cut open,  
changes into his real shape, bites the  
king, and kills him.  
Despite his fearsome role in this story,  
an earlier story illustrates that Takshaka  
is not entirely evil. Takshaka’s mother,  
**Kadru**, bets her sister **Vinata** that the  
tail of a certain celestial horse is black,  
whereas Vinata claims it is white; the sister agrees that the loser will become a  
servant to the winner. Kadru asks her  
children, the serpents, to hang from the  
back of the horse to make it appear as if  
it is black and thus takes unfair advantage. Some of her children, including  
Takshaka, refuse to take part in such  
deceit, and Kadru curses them to be  
killed by **Janamjeya**, King Parikshit’s  
**son**. Takshaka manages to escape this  
**curse**—one of the few times that this  
happens in Hindu mythic stories—but  
most of his siblings are not so lucky.
