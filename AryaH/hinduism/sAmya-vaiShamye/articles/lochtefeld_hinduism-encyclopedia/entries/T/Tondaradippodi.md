title = "Tondaradippodi"

+++
(9th c.) One of the **Alvars**, a group of  
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
stress on passionate devotion (**bhakti**)  
to a personal god, conveyed through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**,  
transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. According to tradition,  
**Tondaradippodi** was born as a **brahmin**  
named Vipra **Narayana**, and his family’s  
hereditary labor was to arrange the flowers for the **worship** of **Ranganatha**, a  
form of Vishnu who is the presiding  
**deity** at the temple of **Shrirangam**. He  
became enamored of a courtesan who  
cast her spell on him, and for a time paid  
attention to nothing else. In the end he  
was saved by Ranganatha, to whom  
Vipra Narayana devoted himself for the  
rest of his life, taking as a symbol of this  
his new name (“Dust of the Feet of the  
Slaves [of God]”). For further information see Kamil Zvelebil, *Tamil Literature*,
