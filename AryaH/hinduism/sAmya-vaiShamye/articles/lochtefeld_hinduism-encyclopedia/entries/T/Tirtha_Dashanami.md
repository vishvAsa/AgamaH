title = "Tirtha Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
**ascetics** who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**. The Dashanamis were  
supposedly established by the ninthcentury philosopher **Shankaracharya**,  
in an effort to create a corps of learned  
men who could help revitalize Hindu  
life. Each of the divisions is designated  
by a different name—in this case, **tirtha**  
(“sacred site”). On **initiation**, new members are given this name as a surname to  
their new ascetic names, thus allowing  
for immediate group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten “named” divisions are divided  
into four larger organizational groups.  
Each group has its headquarters in  
one of the four monastic centers  
(**maths**) supposedly established by  
Shankaracharya, as well as other particular religious associations. The Tirtha  
Dashanamis belong to the **Kitawara**  
group, which is affiliated with the  
**Sharada math** in the city of **Dwaraka**,  
on the shore of the Arabian Sea. The  
Tirtha division is unique in that it is one  
of the few that will initiate only **brahmins**. (The other such divisions are  
**Saraswati**, **Ashrama**, and part of the  
**Bharati** order.)
