title = "Tamil Months"

+++
Although the lunar **calendar** is by far the  
most important means for determining  
the Hindu religious calendar, these  
**lunar months** are also set in the framework of a solar calendar. The latter is  
used for the calculation of the **intercalary month**, which helps keep the  
lunar and solar calendars in rough correspondence. In northern India the  
months of the solar calendar correlate  
with the **zodiac**, with each month  
named after the sign into which the sun  
is reckoned as entering at the beginning  
of that month. In southern India the  
divisions of the solar calendar are exactly  
the same as in the north, but the twelve  
months are given different names. The  
Tamil months take their names from  
some of the **nakshatras**, or features in  
the lunar zodiac, or from modifications  
of the lunar months. The Tamil **year**  
begins with the month of **Chittirai**,  
which corresponds to the northern  
Indian solar month of Mesha (the zodiacal sign of Aries), which by the Indian  
calculations, falls within April and May.  
The eleven months following Chittirai  
are **Vaikasi**, **Ani**, **Adi**, **Avani**, **Purattasi**,  
**Aippasi**, **Kartigai**, **Margali**, **Tai**, **Masi**,  
and **Panguni**. Such different calendars  
are one clear sign of the continuing  
importance of regional cultural  
patterns. This regional culture is particularly important in the Tamil cultural  
area because Tamil is one of the few  
regional languages with an ancient,  
well-established literary tradition.
