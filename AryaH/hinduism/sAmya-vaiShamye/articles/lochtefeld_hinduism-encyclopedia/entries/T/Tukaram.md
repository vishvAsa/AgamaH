title = "Tukaram"

+++
(1598â€“1650) Poet and saint in the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
centered on the **worship** of the god  
**Vithoba**, at his temple at **Pandharpur** in  
the modern state of **Maharashtra**.  
According to tradition, Tukaram was a  
**shudra** (in traditional Hinduism, there  
are four main social groups, the **shudras**  
being the lowest and least influential)  
born in the small village of **Dehu**, where  
his father was a petty merchant.  
Tukaram continued in the family business, which eventually failed because he  
had little interest in worldly life. He  
longed instead for the life of a renunciant, in which he could completely  
devote himself to God. As with many of  
the other **bhakti** saints, he is reported to  
have suffered considerable persecution  
by traditionally minded **brahmins**, who  
were uneasy about a person of his low  
status gaining spiritual greatness. An  
unlettered man, he is most famous for  
the songs known as **abhangs**, which are  
still widely sung in Maharashtra. He had  
many disciples, including the poet-saint  
**Bahina Bai**, and according to tradition,  
he ended his life by being taken up to  
**heaven** in a chariot of fire. For further
