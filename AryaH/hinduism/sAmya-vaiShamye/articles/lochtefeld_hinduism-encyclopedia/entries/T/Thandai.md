title = "Thandai"

+++
(“cooling”) A refreshing sweetened drink  
made of milk or yogurt, ground nuts,  
and spices often used as the medium  
for the consumption of ground marijuana  
(**bhang**). As with all milk products, the  
thandai is considered to have cooling  
properties; this effect may be intended  
to balance the bhang, which is  
considered to be “hot” because of its  
intoxicating properties.
