title = "Thoreau, Henry David"

+++
(1817–1862) American writer and  
philosopher, who by his own account  
was powerfully influenced by the Hindu  
religious text known as the **Bhagavad**  
**Gita**, particularly the text’s instruction to  
perform one’s duties selflessly for the  
good of society, without any thought of  
personal reward. Thoreau refers to this  
text in both *Walden* and *A Week on the*  
*Concord and Merrimack Rivers*, and in  
letters to his friends, Thoreau talks  
about his desire to practice **yoga**.
