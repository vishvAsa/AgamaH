+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
village of **Trimbak** in the **Nasik** district  
of the state of **Maharashtra**, at the headwaters of the **Godavari River**. The temple is named for its presiding **deity**, the  
god **Shiva** in his manifestation as the  
“Three-Eyed Lord.” Shiva is present at  
711  
Tryambakeshvar  
Tryambakeshvar in the form of a **linga**,  
the pillar-shaped image that is his symbolic form. The Tryambakeshvar linga is  
one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network  
of sites deemed especially sacred to  
Shiva and at which Shiva is uniquely  
present. The charter myth for  
Tryambakeshvar begins with the sage  
**Gautama**, who unwisely hits an old **cow**  
with a stick, killing it, and thus incurs  
the sin of cow slaughter. Gautama is told  
that to expiate his sin, he first has to  
amass enough merit to bring the **Ganges**  
down to **earth**, and after he has purified  
himself by bathing (**snana**) in the  
Ganges, he has to make and **worship** 10  
million Shiva lingas formed from the  
sand on its banks. Gautama undertakes  
his penance (**prayashchitta**) diligently.  
Upon worshiping the 10 millionth linga  
he is rewarded by a vision of Shiva, who  
grants his wish that both the Ganges and  
Shiva will remain there forever—the former in her form as the Godavari, the latter as Tryambakeshvar.
