(“satisfying”) Tarpana is a memorial rite  
performed for the satisfaction of one’s  
ancestors, in which one offers them  
libations of **water** to quench their thirst.  
Tarpana satisfies the “**sacrifice** to the  
ancestors,” which is one of the Five  
Great Sacrifices. These five sacrifices are  
mandatory daily religious observances  
(**nitya karma**) for a “**twice-born**” householder, that is, a householder who has  
been born into one of the three “twiceborn” groups in Indian society—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—and who  
has received the adolescent religious  
**initiation** known as the second birth.  
Tarpana is also sometimes an occasional  
religious act (**naimittika karma**), which  
should be performed on occasions  
when one is bathing (**snana**) at pilgrimage places (**tirthas**). The rite itself is  
quite simple. The performer first bathes  
to become ritually pure, scoops up  
water in his joined hands, then tips his  
fingers forward to let the water drain  
out. Some sources also specify that the  
water should be mixed with sesame  
seeds, a substance associated with  
**offerings** to the dead. Tarpana was  
considered a companion rite to the  
memorial ceremony known as **shraddha**,  
although as an obligatory daily act,  
tarpana was performed much more  
frequently. In the shraddha ritual, one  
symbolically feeds one’s ancestors to  
satisfy their hunger, whereas in the  
tarpana ritual, one gives them water to  
quench their thirst.
