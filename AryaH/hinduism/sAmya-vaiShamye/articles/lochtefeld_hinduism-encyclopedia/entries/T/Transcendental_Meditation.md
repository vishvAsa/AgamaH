Religious organization founded by  
**Maharishi Mahesh Yogi**, whose teachings on meditation comprise its major  
thrust. As its name would indicate,  
Transcendental Meditation (TM) stresses  
the multiple benefits of meditation: For  
the individual, it promotes physical,  
mental, and spiritual health, whereas for  
the larger environment, it is claimed to  
have pacific effects, resulting in reduced  
crime and hatred. All of these results can  
be obtained only by diligent practice,  
but the **initiation** itself is easy to  
obtain—all one has to do is to attend a  
seminar sponsored by a TM instructor  
and pay the required fee to obtain one’s  
**mantra**, or sacred utterance. In more  
recent years, TM has offered programs  
leading to the acquisition of superhuman powers (**siddhis**) at its headquarters at Maharishi International  
University in Fairfield, Iowa. The claims  
of these programs have been toned  
down since a disgruntled buyer—who  
had been unable to learn to levitate—  
won a lawsuit for damages.  
Although meditation and the use of  
mantras are well-established Hindu  
practices, many traditional Hindus are  
uncomfortable with other elements of  
TM’s marketing. One controversial point  
is the practice of buying (or selling) a  
mantra, which was traditionally transmitted from teacher (**guru**) to disciple  
only after significant association. A  
similar problem comes from the notion  
that one can buy and sell superhuman  
powers. These powers are seen as highly  
seductive because they can be used for  
both good and evil and as having  
the potential to destroy a spiritually  
immature person. Traditional wisdom is  
unanimous that a person should not  
consciously seek such powers, because  
the very act of seeking is seen as being  
rooted in selfish desires. In contrast,  
when one has gained such powers as a  
byproduct of spiritual attainment, one is  
believed to be able to keep them in  
proper perspective.
