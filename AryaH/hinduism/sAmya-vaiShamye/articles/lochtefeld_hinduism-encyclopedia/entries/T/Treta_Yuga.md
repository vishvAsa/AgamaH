title = "Treta Yuga"

+++
A particular age of the world in **cosmic**  
**time**. According to traditional belief,  
time has neither a beginning nor an end,  
but alternates between cycles of creation and activity, followed by cessation  
and quietude. Each of these cycles lasts  
for 4.32 billion years, with the active  
phase known as the **Day of Brahma**, and  
the quiet phase as the Night of Brahma.  
In cosmic time, the Day of Brahma is  
divided into one thousand **mahayugas**  
(“great cosmic ages”), each of which  
lasts for 4.32 million years. Each  
mahayuga is composed of four constituent **yugas** (cosmic ages), named the  
**Krta Yuga**, Treta Yuga, **Dvapara Yuga**,  
and **Kali Yuga**. Each of these four yugas  
is shorter than its predecessor and ushers in an era more degenerate and  
depraved. By the end of the Kali Yuga,  
things have gotten so bad that the only  
solution is the destruction and recreation of the **earth**, at which time the  
next Krta era begins.  
The Treta Yuga is the second of the  
four yugas, lasting for 1,296,000 years.  
Although the Treta Age is still relatively  
**auspicious**, it is less so than the Krta  
Age, symbolized by its identification  
with the metal silver—not as valuable as  
the gold associated with the preceding  
Krta Yuga, but more valuable than the  
bronze and iron associated with the two  
following yugas. In popular belief the  
Treta Yuga is believed to be the time  
when the god **Rama** reigned on earth.
