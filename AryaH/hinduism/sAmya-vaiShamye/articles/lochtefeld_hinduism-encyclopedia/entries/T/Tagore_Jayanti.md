title = "Tagore Jayanti"

+++
Holiday marking the birth date of the  
Bengali poet, writer, and thinker  
**Rabindranath Tagore**, celebrated on  
May 8, the day he was born in 1861. As  
with most twentieth-century figures,  
Tagoreâ€™s birthday is celebrated according to the solar **calendar** of the common  
era, rather than the lunar calendar that  
governs most religious observances.  
Although Tagore is best known for his literary work, he was also considered a  
religious preceptor (**guru**), and thus his  
birthday carries extra meaning.
