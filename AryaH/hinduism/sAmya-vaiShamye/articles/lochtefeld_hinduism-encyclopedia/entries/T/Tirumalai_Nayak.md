(r. 1623–1659) Greatest ruler in the  
southern Indian **Nayak dynasty**, who  
took advantage of the collapse of the  
**Vijayanagar dynasty** to rule much of  
modern **Tamil Nadu** from the capital  
city of **Madurai**. The peace and prosperity during Tirumalai’s reign was  
expressed with two large pieces of monumental **architecture**—his royal palace,

Tirumalai Nayak  
Depiction of Tirumalai Nayak.  
and the enormous **Minakshi** temple,  
named after the **goddess** considered to  
be Madurai’s patron **deity**. Interestingly,  
the temple was the real ritual center of  
the city, as is clearly shown by its placement and the processional streets surrounding it.
