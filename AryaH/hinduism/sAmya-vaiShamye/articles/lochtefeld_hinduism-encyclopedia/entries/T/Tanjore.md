title = "Tanjore"

+++
City and district in the southern Indian  
state of **Tamil Nadu**, the eastern boundary of which is the Bay of Bengal. The  
Tanjore district lies in the **Cauvery River**  
delta, south of the river’s main channel;  
even today this extremely fertile area  
grows a large percentage of India’s rice.  
This district was the core homeland of  
the **Chola dynasty**, and the land’s agricultural fecundity was the underlying  
source of the dynasty’s power, which at  
one point stretched through most of  
southern India and even extended to  
Malaysia. The Chola dynasty used  
their wealth and power to build  
enormous temples throughout Tamil  
Nadu, but especially in the Tanjore  
district and Tanjore city, their capital.  
The Chola zenith came with King **Raja**  
**Raja** (r. 985–1014 C.E.), who built Tanjore  
city’s **Brhadeshvar** temple, and his  
**son Rajendra** (r. 1014–1042 C.E.),  
whose greatest monument is the temple  
at **Gangaikondacholapuran**. The  
Brhadeshvar temple is dedicated to  
**Shiva** as the “Great Lord”; some of  
the most notable of the other temples  
built or improved by the Cholas  
were at **Kumbhakonam**, **Thiruvaiyaru**,  
**Chidambaram**, and **Shrirangam**.
