(“[taking] Three Steps”) Epithet of the  
god **Vishnu** in his **avatar**, or incarnation, as a dwarf (**Vamana**). The name  
exists because diminutive Vamana begs  
three paces of land from the **demon**king **Bali** and then grows to such a large  
size that these three paces measure out  
the universe. See **Vamana avatar**.
