title = "Tiger"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a tiger or **lion** is the  
animal vehicle of the powerful forms of  
the **Goddess**, such as **Durga**. Modern  
iconography shows both lions and tigers  
with no apparent difference between  
them, perhaps reflecting the fact that  
the **Hindi** word *sher* can refer to either  
animal. In either case, the fact that the  
Goddess rides such a dangerous animal  
is clearly a symbol of her power and  
capacity, because in her mythology  
these **animals** are often described as her  
allies, doing battle on her part in  
response to her command.
