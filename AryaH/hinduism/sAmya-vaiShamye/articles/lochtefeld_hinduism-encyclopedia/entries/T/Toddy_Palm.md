title = "Toddy Palm"

+++
Palm tree that is both the source of the  
slightly fermented beverage tapped  
from its sap known as toddy, and the  
long, flat leaves that were traditionally  
used for writing down all sorts of texts,  
including religious ones. The former use  
led this tree to be considered unclean,  
since alcoholic beverages are proscribed  
in “respectable” Hindu society; the manuscripts written on the leaves, however,  
could be the holiest of texts. The poetsaint **Ravidas** uses this palm to illustrate  
how the power of the divine name can  
transform something normally believed  
to be base and vile. In doing so he is also  
referring to himself, who as a tanner and  
**leather** worker was believed to be  
defiled because his work involves handling the skins of dead **animals**.
