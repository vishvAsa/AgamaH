A lunar **day**, that is to say, one of the thirty  
days occurring during a single **lunar**  
**month**, from **full moon** to full moon.  
Because these thirty lunar days take  
place in about twenty-eight solar days,  
each lunar day is thus slightly shorter  
than a solar day. Even in contemporary  
times, most Hindu religious observances are determined by the lunar **calendar**, which makes the determination  
of these lunar days an important matter.  
Most people keep track of these holidays  
with a **panchang**, an almanac that gives  
all the lunar days.
