title = "Tirukkural"

+++
One of the most important pieces of  
early Tamil literature, along with the  
slightly later **Naladiyar**. The Tirukkural  
is a collection of brief verses on religious, social, and moral life, organized  
according to various themes; it is attributed to the poet **Tiruvalluvar** and is  
believed to have been written late in the  
fifth century. The *Tirukkural*â€™s underlying assumptions are theistic, and in this  
it differs from the *Naladiyar*, the tone of  
which is primarily ethical, with no mention of divinity. Many of these epigrams  
have become proverbial expressions in  
Tamil and have become the cultural  
property of Tamils from all religious  
communities. See also **Tamil language**  
and **Tamil epics**.
