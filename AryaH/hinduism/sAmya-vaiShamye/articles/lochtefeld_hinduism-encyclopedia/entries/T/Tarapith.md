title = "Tarapith"

+++
(“Tara’s seat”) Town and sacred site  
(**tirtha**) in the state of **West Bengal**,  
about 130 miles northwest of Calcutta.  
Tarapith is famous as one of the **Shakti**  
**Pithas**, a network of sites sacred to the  
**Goddess** that spreads throughout the  
subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha marks  
the site where a body part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth**,  
taking form there as a different goddess;  
in the case of Tarapith, the body part  
was Sati’s cornea (tara). Tarapith’s presiding goddess, Tara, is a fierce form of  
the Goddess, who has strong associations with **tantra**, a secret ritually based  
religious practice. In modern times  
much of the shrine’s fame comes from  
an unusual **ascetic** named **Vamakhepa**  
(1843–1911), whose apparent irrationality and lack of respect for generally  
accepted norms—he once urinated on  
the temple’s image of Tara to show his  
contempt for a **deity** made of iron—was  
a perfect match for Tara herself. Tarapith  
is said to bestow supernormal powers  
(**siddhis**) on those who **worship** there;  
this makes Tarapith not only a very powerful place but also a potentially dangerous one. For further information see
