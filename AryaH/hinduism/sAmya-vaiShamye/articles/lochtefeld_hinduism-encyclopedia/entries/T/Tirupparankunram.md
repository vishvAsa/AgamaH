**Tirtha** (sacred site) ten miles southwest  
of **Madurai** in central **Tamil Nadu**.  
Tirupparankunram is famous for one of  
the six temples in Tamil Nadu built to  
honor **Murugan**, a hill **deity** assimilated  
into the pantheon as a form of **Skanda**.  
It is said to be where he marries  
**Devasena**, the bride given by **Indra** and  
the gods after he has proven his mettle  
in battle, and thus reflects his acceptance into the larger pantheon. Five of  
these temples are definitively identified  
and scattered throughout the state, but  
the sixth is said to be every other shrine  
to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The cult of  
Murugan is thus a symbolic vehicle for  
Tamil pride and identity, and because  
the number six has connotations of  
completeness—as in the six directions,  
or the six **chakras** in the **subtle body**—it  
also connotes that nothing outside is  
needed. For further information see

Tamil Cultus of Murukan,” in *Journal of*
