+++
The tanmatras are the subtle elements,  
the subtle forms of the five gross elements (**earth**, **air**, **fire**, **water**, **and**  
**akasha**) from which the gross elements  
are derived. The senses corresponding  
to the subtle elements are gandha  
(smell) for earth, sparsha (touch) for air,  
rupa (shape) for fire, rasa (taste) for  
water, and **shabda** (sound) for akasha.  
The tanmatras first appeared in the  
account of the **evolution** of the universe  
propounded by the **Samkhya** school,  
one of the **six schools** of traditional  
Hindu **philosophy**. In the Samkhya  
account, the subtle elements are the  
stage of evolution preceding the evolution of the gross elements. The Samkhya  
school espoused an atheistic dualism in  
which the two fundamental principles  
were **purusha** (spirit) and **prakrti**  
(matter); all of this evolution was associated with prakrti because, according  
to the Samkhyas, the purusha  
never changed. The Samkhya account  
of evolution was appropriated by  
other groups—although these groups  
often adapted it to reflect theistic  
assumptions in which the world  
came from God—and thus the notion

Tanmatras  
of the subtle elements became an  
accepted philosophical convention.
