title = "Tirruppavai"

+++
One of the two collections of poetry  
composed by the poet-saint **Andal**  
(9th c.), the other being the **Nacciyar**  
**Tirumoli**. Andal was the only woman  
among the **Alvars**, a group of twelve  
poet-saints who lived in southern India  
between the seventh and tenth centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
stress on passionate devotion (**bhakti**)  
to a personal god, conveyed through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**,  
transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. Andal’s chosen **deity** was  
**Ranganatha**, the particular form of  
Vishnu presiding at the temple of  
**Shrirangam**, yet both collections of her  
poetry are dedicated to **Krishna**, a different form of Vishnu.  
This seeming divergence may reflect  
her conviction that all manifestations of  
Vishnu were the same or else may indicate a difference between personal  
devotion and literary expression.  
Ranganatha was a specific form of  
Vishnu presiding over a specific place—  
which at the time was true for  
most southern Indian temples—whereas  
Krishna was a form of Vishnu for whom  
there was already a large body  
of literature, but who was not geographically limited. The contents of the  
*Tirruppavai* are poems of separation in  
which Andal mourns the absence of  
Krishna, using the language and images  
of the forlorn lover, feverishly hoping for  
Krishna’s return.
