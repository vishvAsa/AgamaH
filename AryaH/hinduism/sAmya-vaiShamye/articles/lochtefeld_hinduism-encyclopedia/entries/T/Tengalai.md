One of the two main subsects in  
the **Shrivaishnava** religious community,  
the other being the **Vadagalai**. The  
693  
Tengalai  
Temple car from the city of Shrirangapatnam, in the state of Karnataka. It is used to transport an image of  
the temple’s primary deity during festival processions.  
Shrivaishnavas are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Vishnu**, and their roots lie in the  
devotional hymns of the **Alvars**, a group  
of twelve poet-saints who lived in  
southern India between the seventh  
and tenth centuries. Two centuries  
later, the Alvars’ devotional outpouring  
was organized and systematized by  
the philosopher **Ramanuja** (11th c.),  
who is considered the Shrivaishnava  
founder. Ramanuja was convinced that  
**Brahman**, or Supreme Reality, was a  
personal **deity** rather than an impersonal  
abstract principle, and he was also  
convinced that devotion (**bhakti**) was  
the most important form of religious  
practice. **Vishishthadvaita Vedanta**, his  
philosophical position, stressed both of  
these convictions and thus opposed the  
**Advaita Vedanta** school, founded by the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**, which  
believed that the Supreme Being was  
impersonal and that realization (**jnana**)  
was the best spiritual path.  
The split between the Tengalais and  
the Vadagalais came several centuries  
after Ramanuja and stemmed from differing perspectives on what the individual must do to gain final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**). The Tengalais emphasize the need for absolute surrender  
(**prapatti**) to the **grace** of God, through  
which devotees will be saved with no  
action of their own; the Vadagalais stress  
that devotees must also exert themselves on their own behalf. The Tengalai  
founder was Pillai **Lokacharya** (14th c.),  
who is also the community’s most  
important figure.
