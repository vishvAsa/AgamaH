(“You are that”) In the Hindu philosophical  
tradition, one of the “great utterances”  
(**mahavakyas**) expressing the ultimate  
truth. The truth referred to here is the  
identity of **atman** (the individual Self)  
and **Brahman** (Supreme Reality); this  
identity is the heart of the speculative  
texts called the **Upanishads**. This particular passage is found repeatedly in the  
sixth book of the **Chandogya**  
**Upanishad**, in which the boy  
**Shvetaketu** is being instructed by his  
father. The boy’s father uses a series  
of analogies to convey his instruction  
regarding the identical natures of the  
**atman** and Brahman, ending every  
such analogy with this concluding  
phrase, which contains the wisdom  
of the whole.  
In addition to its textual importance,  
this and three other mahavakyas—as  
utterances that capsulize fundamental  
truth—were appropriated as identifying  
symbols by the four divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasi** ascetics. Each  
division had a different mahavakya, just  
as each had a different **Veda**, a different  
primary sacred center, and a different  
paradigmatic **ascetic** quality. Tat  
tvam asi is the mahavakya associated  
with the **Kitawara** division of the  
Dashanami Sanyasis.
