title = "Tad Ekam"

(“That One”) Epithet used in **Rg Veda**  
hymn 10.129, the so-called **Creation**  
**Hymn**, to designate the first living being  
on the **earth**. The four **Vedas** are the oldest Hindu religious texts, and based on  
its style and content, the Rg Veda is the  
oldest of the Vedas. Most of the hymns in  
the Rg Veda are invocations addressed to  
various divinities, sung to propitiate  
these divinities so that human beings  
may enjoy the good things of this life.  
The Creation Hymn takes a far more  
speculative tone, standing in marked  
contrast to the confidence and optimism found in the earlier hymns. In the  
Creation Hymn, the poet begins by  
imagining a time before the existence of  
Being and Nonbeing and speculates on  
how the world came to be.  
In the end, the poet ascribes all creation to a single impersonal agent, That  
One (Tad Ekam). This hymn is noteworthy for ascribing the creation of the  
world to a single power, an idea that  
foreshadows the notion of **Brahman** in  
the **Upanishads**, the speculative texts  
that form the final stratum of the Vedic  
literature. The name Tad Ekam, which is  
grammatically a neuter noun, also foreshadows the notion found in the  
Upanishads that Brahman is an impersonal force. After describing how That  
One formed the cosmos and knew all its  
secrets, the poem ends with the conjecture that perhaps That One may not be  
omniscient and omnipotent after all.  
This hymn thus further foreshadows the  
Upanishads in its speculative tone and  
its admission that the ultimate answer  
may be unknown.
