title = "Trilochan"

+++
(15th c.?) A **sant** poet who is generally  
associated with the poet-saint **Namdev**.  
The name *sant* is an umbrella term for a  
loose group of central and northern  
Indian poet-saints who shared several  
general tendencies: a stress on individualized, interior religion leading to a personal experience of the divine; a  
disdain for external ritual, particularly  
image **worship**; a faith in the power of  
the divine name; and a tendency to  
ignore conventional **caste** distinctions.  
Trilochan’s only existing poems are a few  
verses in the **Adigranth**, the sacred  
scripture of the Sikh community. These  
verses describe his devotion to **Vithoba**,  
the presiding **deity** of the temple at  
**Pandharpur** in **Maharashtra**, who was  
also Namdev’s chosen deity. Thus, the  
poems seem consistent with Maharashtrian origins. Trilochan is also mentioned as a devotee (**bhakta**) by other  
**bhakti** poets, most notably by the poetsaint **Ravidas**.
