title = "Trishanku"

+++
(“three sins”) In Hindu mythology, a celebrated king of the **Solar Line**. He is  
named Satyavrata at **birth** but is cursed  
by the sage **Vasishtha** to bear the name  
Trishanku because of three major sins:  
He abducts another man’s wife, he  
incurs the anger of his father, and he  
eats beef (which he has earlier obtained  
by slaughtering Vasishtha’s **cow**). Along  
with this uncomplimentary name,  
Vasishtha also curses Trishanku to be a  
chandala (**untouchable**), which Trishanku  
suffers for some time before being  
restored to his kingship.  
After regaining his throne, Trishanku  
is a good king, but he desires to be taken  
bodily into **heaven**. Vasishtha and his  
sons ridicule this desire, but Trishanku  
finds an ally in the sage **Vishvamitra**,  
who has a long history of conflict with  
Vasishtha. Vishvamitra performs the  
**sacrifice** to take Trishanku to heaven,  
but when he arrives there, he is pushed  
back down by **Indra**, the ruler of heaven,  
and Trishanku falls head downward.  
Vishvamitra orders Trishanku to remain  
where he is, and since Indra will not let  
him up and Vishvamitra will not let him  
down, he is suspended in midair. Indra  
begins to construct a separate heaven  
for Trishanku, but when Vishvamitra  
threatens to create a new Indra for the  
new heaven, Indra relents and takes  
Trishanku to heaven in his material  
body. The name *Trishanku* has since  
become proverbial to refer to a person  
trapped between two options.
