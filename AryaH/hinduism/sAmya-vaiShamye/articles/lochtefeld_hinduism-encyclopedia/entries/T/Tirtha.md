title = "Tirtha"

+++
(“crossing place”) The most general  
name for any holy place. Just as a ford on  
a riverbank provides a safe place to cross  
from one side to the other, in the same  
way a tirtha provides a way for one to  
“cross over” from mundane life to a  
sanctified one or, on an even greater  
scale, to “cross over” from this ephemeral  
and ever changing world to the  
unchanging, blissful, final liberation of  
the soul (**moksha**). Many tirthas are  
actual places—and many of them are on  
the shores of India’s sacred rivers, particularly the **Ganges**—and in its most colloquial meaning, the word *tirtha*  
connotes a pilgrimage place. Yet the traditional pilgrimage literature is emphatic  
that tirthas are not just restricted to  
mere physical places: The word can also  
refer to holy people (such as **ascetics**,  
saints, **gurus**, and sages) as well as to  
virtues such as charity, wisdom, compassion, and **purity** of heart.  
A tirtha is first and foremost a place  
or thing that gives one access to sanctity  
and religious power, and in the case of  
the physical places (rivers, mountains,  
cities, temples, or images), this power is  
accessible to all. Such holy places are  
seen not only as giving easier access to  
the divine but also as being areas where  
religious merit is more readily and  
bountifully obtained. When one surveys  
the literature connected with certain  
698  
Time  
areas, one of the most common themes  
is the claim that the merit from religious  
acts performed at place X (the physical  
tirtha) equals that of a thousand (or a  
million, or a billion) such religious acts  
done in ordinary places. The rarefied  
atmosphere at tirthas has a similar effect  
on evil acts, multiplying their consequences manifold. In this way the action  
of a tirtha can be compared to that of a  
microphone; just as a microphone magnifies any sound, whether harsh or  
pleasant, in the same way a tirtha magnifies, for good or ill, the consequences of any action. The pilgrimage  
literature thus commonly reminds people of the religious merit that their acts  
can bring, and it warns them that careless or evil actions can have equally  
severe consequences. For this reason,  
people performing religious pilgrimage  
(**tirthayatra**) were encouraged to live an  
austere, self-conscious life, both to save  
themselves from any lapses and to make  
the journey a self-conscious process of  
transformation. For further information
