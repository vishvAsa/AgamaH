title = "Three Debts"

+++
According to tradition, repayment of  
three “debts” was incumbent on all  
“**twice-born**” men, that is, men born  
into one of the three “twice-born”  
groups in Indian society—**brahmin**,  
**kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—who had undergone the adolescent religious **initiation**  
known as the second birth. The first of  
these debts was to the gods and was  
repaid by **offering** sacrifices. The second  
debt was to the sages and was satisfied  
by studying the **Vedas**, the oldest and  
most authoritative religious texts. The  
final debt was to the ancestors (**pitrs**)  
and was satisfied by procreating a **son**,  
to ensure that the ancestral rites would  
be carried out without interruption.
