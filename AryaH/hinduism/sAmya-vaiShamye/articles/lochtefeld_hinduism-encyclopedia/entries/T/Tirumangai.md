title = "Tirumangai"

+++
(9th c.) By far the most picturesque of  
the **Alvars**, a group of twelve poet-saints  
who lived in southern India between the  
seventh and tenth centuries. All the  
Alvars were devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**, and their stress on passionate  
devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god,  
conveyed through hymns sung in the  
**Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. According to  
tradition, Tirumangai was born into a  
**caste** of thieves, and theft, robbery, and  
deceit play an important role in the stories associated with him. One story  
reports that after taking a vow to feed  
1,008 **Vaishnavas** for a year, he resorted  
to highway robbery to raise the necessary funds; on another occasion he took  
to robbery to raise funds to enlarge the  
temple at **Shrirangam**. In these and  
other works, he had the continual help  
of Vishnu, his chosen **deity**; regardless of  
their truth or falsity, these stories reveal  
a great deal about the passionate  
devotional commitment of his time.
