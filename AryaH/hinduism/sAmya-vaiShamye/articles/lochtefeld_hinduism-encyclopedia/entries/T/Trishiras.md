title = "Trishiras"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Hindu epics, Trishiras is a **demon**  
ally of **Ravana**, the demon-king of  
**Lanka**. Along with Ravana’s brothers,  
**Khara** and **Dushana**, Trishiras leads a  
frontal attack against the god **Rama**, the  
epic’s protagonist. The attack is an effort  
to avenge the insult to Ravana’s sister  
**Shurpanakha**, who has been mutilated  
by Rama’s brother **Lakshmana**.  
Although he is a valiant warrior, Trishiras  
is eventually killed by Rama, as are  
Khara and Dushana. The failure of such  
frontal attacks convince Ravana that  
Rama is too powerful to kill in combat,  
so he decides to take revenge by kidnapping Rama’s wife **Sita**.
