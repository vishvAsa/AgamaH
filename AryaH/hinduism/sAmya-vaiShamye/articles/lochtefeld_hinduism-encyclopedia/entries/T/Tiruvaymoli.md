title = "Tiruvaymoli"

+++
(“Holy words”) Collection of 1,102  
stanzas written in the tenth century  
by the poet-saint **Nammalvar**.  
Nammalvar was one of the **Alvars**, a  
group of twelve poet-saints who lived  
in southern India between the seventh  
and tenth centuries. All of the Alvars  
were devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**, and their stress on passionate  
devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god,  
conveyed through hymns sung in the  
**Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life.  
Nammalvar’s *Tiruvaymoli* is an outpouring of ecstatic **Vaishnava** devotionalism and forms the concluding  
section of the **Nalayira Divyaprabandham**, the collected compositions of the Alvars. For further  
information see Kamil Zvelebil, *Tamil*
