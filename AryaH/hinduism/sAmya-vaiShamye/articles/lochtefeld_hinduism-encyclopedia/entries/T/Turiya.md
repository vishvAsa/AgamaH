(“fourth”) The name for the innermost  
quarter of the Self (**atman**), as described  
in the **Mandukya Upanishad**, one of the  
speculative religious texts that form the  
latest stratum of the **Vedas**, the oldest  
Hindu sacred texts. As with most of the  
Upanishads, the Mandukya Upanishad’s  
underlying concern is to investigate  
ultimate questions, in particular the  
nature of the Self. The upanishad  
describes the Self as having four  
quarters, each of which removes another  
layer of egoism. The first quarter is  
waking consciousness, which is

Tulsi plant used in Tulsi Vivah festival.  
characterized by perceptions of subject  
and object; the second is **dream**  
sleep, which is sheer subjectivity; the  
third is deep sleep, which has neither  
subject nor object; and the last is a  
mysterious state simply called “the  
fourth” (turiya), which is the Self. This  
state is identified as the ultimate truth,  
and knowledge of this brings final  
liberation of the soul (**moksha**).
