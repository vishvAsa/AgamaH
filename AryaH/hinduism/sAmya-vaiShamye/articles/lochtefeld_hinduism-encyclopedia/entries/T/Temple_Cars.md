title = "Temple Cars"

+++
Name for the ceremonial carts in which  
the movable image of a **deity** (**utsava**  
**murti**) can be transported throughout  
the town or, in the case of the temples of  
southern India, around the processional  
streets that often ring the temple in concentric layers. In some cases the carts  
are made new every **year**, as at the temple of the god **Jagannath** in the city of  
**Puri**; in other cases (as one finds in  
many of the southern Indian temples)  
the temple car is one of the deityâ€™s  
standard accouterments, and it is made  
from precious metals and is richly decorated. In either case the deity is being  
treated in a manner parallel to that of a  
king, and the car is a means to move the  
deity in procession to view his or her  
earthly domain.
