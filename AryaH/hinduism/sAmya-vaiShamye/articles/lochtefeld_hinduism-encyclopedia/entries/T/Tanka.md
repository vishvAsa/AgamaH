title = "Tanka"

+++
Name for a small chisel used by stone  
workers, one of the characteristic  
objects in Hindu iconography. The tanka  
is mainly associated with **Shiva** and  
is a minor artifact because it generally  
appears only when the **deity** has  
multiple arms and is holding a number  
of objects.
