title = "Tulsidas"

+++
(1532–1623) Poet-saint and devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Rama**, whose greatest work, the **Ramcharitmanas**, retells  
the epic **Ramayana** in the vernacular  
language of his day. According to evidence in his poetry, Tulsidas was born  
into a desperately poor **brahmin** family,  
but his life was transformed by the  
power of Rama’s name. This can be  
taken as a reference to his teacher, who  
is believed to have been a **Ramanandi**,  
but it can also be taken literally. Tulsidas  
continually stresses that the name of  
Rama embodies the divinity’s power and  
thus makes that power accessible to  
devotees. According to tradition, he  
lived a fairly hard life despite his fame,  
and because of his emphasis on devotion, he reportedly faced problems from  
other brahmins, who were concerned  
about maintaining their social status.  
As with all of the *Ramayana*’s vernacular retellings, Tulsidas did not merely  
translate the story of Rama but interpreted it according to his own religious  
convictions. The two most important  
shifts are his overwhelming emphasis  
on the importance of devotion (**bhakti**)  
and the saving power of the name  
of Rama, to which Tulsidas gives  
greater importance than Rama himself.  
Tulsidas also brings in mythic material  
from a variety of other sources, most  
notably the **Shiva Purana** and the  
*Adhyatmaramayana*. This material is  
largely added to the first and last chapters, where Tulsidas makes his greatest  
changes from the original epic. One theory to explain why Tulsidas brought in  
this other material is that he was trying  
to transcend narrow sectarian boundaries, and a sign of this is that much of  
the text is narrated by the god **Shiva**, in  
the form of a dialogue to his wife  
**Parvati**. For part of the final book, Shiva  
is supplanted as narrator by the crow  
**Bhushundi**, who symbolizes the power  
of devotion to rescue even a common  
carrion-eating crow. Aside from the  
*Ramcharitmanas*, Tulsidas composed  
many other works in varying regional  
languages and dedicated to various  
**deities**; the most important are the  
**Kavitavali**, the **Vinaya Patrika**, the  
**Ramavali**, and the **Shrikrishnavali**.  
Tulsidas himself refers to writing down  
his poems, and although the manuscript  
tradition is uncertain for some of his  
texts, the transition from song to written  
text took place much faster than for  
most of his contemporary poet-saints,  
many of whom were illiterate. For further information see F. Raymond Allchin
