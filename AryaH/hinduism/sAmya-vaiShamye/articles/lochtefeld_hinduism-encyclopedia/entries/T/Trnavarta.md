title = "Trnavarta"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Trnavarta is one of  
the **demon** assassins sent by **Kamsa**, the  
**demon**-king of **Mathura**, in an attempt  
to kill his nephew, the child-god  
**Krishna**. Trnavarta is a whirlwind that  
sweeps Krishna up into the air, but  
Krishna holds tight to Trnavarta until he  
simply blows himself out.
