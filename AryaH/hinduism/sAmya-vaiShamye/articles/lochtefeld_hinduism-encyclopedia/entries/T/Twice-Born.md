title = "Twice-Born"

+++
(dvija) In its most specific sense,  
this word denotes a man from the  
highest traditional social groups  
(**varnas**)—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, and  
**vaishya**—who has undergone the adolescent ritual **initiation** known as the  
**upanayana samskara**. This initiation  
gives the entitlement and the obligation  
to study the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu  
religious texts, and definitively divides  
society between those who have this  
entitlement and those who do not—  
namely, all children, **women**, and men not  
belonging to these three groups. Because  
of this initiation’s ritual significance,  
it was known as the second birth, and  
thus the initiates were “twice-born.” The  
first birth was biological and based on  
nature, whereas the second was cultural  
and marked higher religious status.  
Although in its strictest sense this word  
refers only to such initiates, in a more  
general sense it can denote any person  
belonging to a varna whose members  
are eligible for this initiation—that is,  
any brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya.
