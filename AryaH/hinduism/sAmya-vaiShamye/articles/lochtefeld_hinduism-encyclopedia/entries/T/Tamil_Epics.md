title = "Tamil Epics"

+++
Collective name for three early Tamil  
epic poems: the **Shilappadigaram**, the  
**Manimegalai**, and the **ShivagaSindamani**. These poems were composed in about the sixth and seventh  
centuries of the common era, when religious forms and cultural influence  
(among them, the composition of epic  
poems) were seeping in from the north  
and influencing indigenous forms. Aside  
from **Sanskrit**, Tamil is the only major  
ancient literary language. All three of  
these poems provide important information about life in their contemporary  
times, including religious life. In brief,  
the *Shilappadigaram* (“The Jeweled  
Anklet”) is a tragedy that highlights several important themes that have pervaded  
Hindu culture, particularly the need for  
a king to rule righteously and the power  
gained by a wife through her devotion to  
her husband. The *Manimegalai* focuses  
on a young woman of the same name,  
who is wooed by the local prince but  
eventually becomes a Buddhist nun.  
Although the story clearly has a Buddhist  
bias, Manimegalai has numerous debates  
with people from competing religious  
traditions. Finally, the *ShivagaSindamani* describes the adventures of  
Shivaga, a man who excels at every possible manly art, who with each new  
challenge wins a new wife for his harem  
but in the end renounces everything  
to become a Jain monk. Although the  
later two epics are respectively biased  
toward Buddhist and Jain religious  
values, they all give valuable information about contemporary religious life.
