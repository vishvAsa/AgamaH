title = "Tungnath"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Garhwal** region of the **Himalayas** in the  
valley between the **Mandakini** and the  
**Alakananda Rivers**, fourteen miles by  
footpath north of the village of  
**Ukhimath**. The temple’s presiding **deity**  
is the god **Shiva** in his manifestation  
as the “Lofty Lord.” Tungnath is one of  
the **Panchkedar**, a network of five  
sacred sites spread throughout the  
Garhwal region; the other four are  
**Kedarnath**, **Kalpeshvar**, **Rudranath**,  
and **Madmaheshvar**. This network of  
five sites is seen as a symbolic representation of Shiva’s body, understandably  
so, since Shiva is believed to dwell in the  
Himalayas. Of these five, Tungnath is  
believed to be Shiva’s arm.
