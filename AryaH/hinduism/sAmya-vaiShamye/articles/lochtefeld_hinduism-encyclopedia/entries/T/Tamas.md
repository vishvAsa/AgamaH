title = "Tamas"

+++
(“darkness”) One of the three fundamental qualities (**gunas**) believed to be  
present in all things, the other two being  
**sattva** (“goodness”) and **rajas** (“passion”). According to this model, the differing proportions of these qualities  
account for the differences both in the  
inherent nature of things and in individual human capacities and tendencies.  
Of the three, tamas is always negative  
and is associated with darkness, disease,  
ignorance, sloth, spoilage, and death.  
The notion of these three gunas originated in the metaphysics of the  
**Samkhya** school, one of the **six schools**  
of traditional Hindu **philosophy**, and  
although much of Samkhya metaphysics connected with the gunas has  
long been discredited, the idea of the  
gunas and their qualities has become a  
pervasive assumption in Indian culture.
