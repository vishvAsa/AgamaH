title = "Tagore, Rabindranath"

+++
(1861–1941) Poet and Nobel laureate in  
Literature, an honor bestowed in 1912  
for his *Gitanjali* (“Garland of Songs”).  
Tagore came from an influential and  
extremely wealthy landed family and  
was thus able to focus all his energy on  
his literary work. Aside from his prodigious literary output, he lectured extensively both in India and in other  
countries; in the latter he emphasized  
the need to retain spiritual values,  
whereas in India he more often gave his  
attention to the need to fulfill people’s  
material needs. In 1921 he established  
the Vishva-Bharati University at  
**Shantiniketan** in the state of **West**  
**Bengal**. The university was dedicated to  
providing an education that would satisfy  
both of these needs and thus develop an  
integrated human being. For further
