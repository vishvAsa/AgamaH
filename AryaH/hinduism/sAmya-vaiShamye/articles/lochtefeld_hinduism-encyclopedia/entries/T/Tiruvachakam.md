+++
(“holy utterances”) Collection of poetry  
composed in the ninth century by the  
Tamil poet-saint **Manikkavachakar**,  
who was a passionate devotee (**bhakta**)  
of the god **Shiva**. Manikkavachakar’s  
work comes in the tradition of the  
**Nayanars** (a group of sixty-three **Shaiva**  
poet-saints who lived in southern India  
in the seventh and eighth centuries),  
although he is not counted as one of  
them because he was about a century  
later than the last Nayanar, **Sundaramurtti**. The hymns in the *Tiruvachakam*  
bear witness to Manikkavachakar’s  
intense devotion to Shiva, and in their  
devotional fervor, they can be seen as  
the culmination of the earlier devotional  
(**bhakti**) tradition. Manikkavachakar’s  
hymns are also the basis for the development of the philosophical tradition  
known as **Shaiva Siddhanta**, which  
makes Manikkavachakar a pivotal figure  
in southern Indian Shaivism. For further  
information see Glenn Yocum, *Hymns to*  
*the Dancing Siva*, 1982. See also **Tamil**  
**language** and **Tamil epics**.
