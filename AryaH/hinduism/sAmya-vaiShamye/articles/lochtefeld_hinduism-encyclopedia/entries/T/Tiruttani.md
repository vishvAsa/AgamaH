title = "Tiruttani"

**Tirtha** (sacred site) in the hills of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, seventy-five miles of Madras. It is  
famous for one of the six temples in  
Tamil Nadu built to honor **Murugan**, a  
hill **deity** assimilated into the pantheon  
as a form of **Skanda**. Tiruttani is celebrated as the place where he marries his  
tribal bride **Valli**, which gives him a family connection with southern India. Five  
of these temples are definitively identified and scattered throughout the state,  
but the sixth is said to be every other  
shrine to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The  
cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic vehicle for Tamil pride and identity, and  
because the number six has connotations of completeness—as in the six  
directions or the six **chakras** in the **subtle body**—it also connotes that nothing  
outside is needed. For further information see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage  
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of  
Murukan,” in *Journal of the American*  
*Academy of Religion,* Vol. 40, No. 1, 1972.
