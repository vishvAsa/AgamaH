title = "Tripundra"

+++
Sectarian mark of three horizontal lines,  
most commonly applied to the forehead  
but which can also be applied to the  
back, heart, shoulders, arms, and legs.  
The tripundra marks the person wearing  
it as a devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**,  
and although this mark is most commonly worn by renunciant **ascetics**,  
householders also wear it. According to  
one interpretation, the three lines represent the three prongs of Shiva’s trident;  
according to another, they symbolize  
Shiva’s third eye. The three lines are  
drawn by dipping the first three fingers of  
the right hand into a sacred ash known as  
**vibhuti** (“power”) and then drawing  
them across the forehead. In earlier times  
vibhuti was made from wood ash that  
had been sifted through cloth until it was  
as fine as talcum powder. This is still done  
today, primarily by ascetics who usually  
use the ash from a **dhuni**, or smoldering  
ascetic **fire**, which has sacred characteristics; vibhuti can also be bought in stores  
selling religious supplies.
