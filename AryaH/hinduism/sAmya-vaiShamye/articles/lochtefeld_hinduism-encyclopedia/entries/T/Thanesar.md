City and sacred site (**tirtha**) adjoining  
the sacred site of **Kurukshetra** in the  
northern part of the state of **Haryana**.  
Thanesar is a famous site in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
Sanskrit epics. The epic’s climax comes  
at Kurukshetra in an eighteen-day battle  
between two factions of an extended  
family, along with their allies and supporters. On one side, there are the five  
**Pandava** brothers, who are the epic’s  
protagonists, and on the other, their  
cousins the **Kauravas**, who are the  
antagonists. According to the epic, on  
the eve of the battle, the Pandavas worshiped the god **Shiva** in a temple at  
Thanesar, and after their **worship** Shiva  
assured them that they would be victorious. Aside from the temple, Thanesar  
also has a renowned bathing tank said to  
contain all the sacred rivers of India, at  
which the primary bathing (**snana**) day  
is **Sunday**. Nearby is the Gita **Mandir**,  
at which **Arjuna**, one of the Pandava  
brothers, is said to have received  
the teaching of the **Bhagavad Gita**  
from **Krishna** in the moments before  
the battle began.
