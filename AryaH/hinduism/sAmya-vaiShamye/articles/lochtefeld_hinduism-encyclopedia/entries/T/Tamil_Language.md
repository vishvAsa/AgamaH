title = "Tamil Language"

+++
One of the four **Dravidian** languages,  
along with **Kannada**, Telegu, and  
Malayalam; all four languages are spoken primarily in southern India. Tamil is  
the predominant language in modern  
**Tamil Nadu**, which is one of the “linguistic states” formed after the Indians  
gained independence. This state was  
formed to unite people with a common  
language and culture under one state  
government. Although all four languages have literary and cultural significance, Tamil has by far the richest  
history as a literary language. Tamil literature begins in the early centuries of the  
common era with the **Sangam literature**, eight collections of poetry that  
focused equally on the external description of battle or internal descriptions of  
love. The Sangam literature was followed by the three **Tamil epics**: the  
**Shilappadigaram**, the **Manimegalai**,  
and the **Shivaga-Sindamani**. Between  
the seventh and tenth centuries came  
684  
Talikota  
the devotional (**bhakti**) literature composed by the **Alvars** and the **Nayanars**,  
with the former expressing their devotion to the god **Vishnu** and the latter to  
the god **Shiva**. Their devotional poetry  
was unprecedented in Hindu religious  
history because it utilized everyday vernacular language as a spectacular vehicle for profound religious expression.  
The Alvars’ poems became a foundational text for the **Shrivaishnava** community, and the Nayanars’ for **Shaiva**  
**Siddhanta**, and thus both of these collections continue to be important in  
Hindu religious life. Even today Tamil is  
a vibrant literary language and a source  
of intense regional pride to the people  
living there; some of the most violent  
recent demonstrations in southern  
India were the so-called language riots,  
protesting the imposition of **Hindi** as  
the government language, a move that  
was seen as a conscious attempt to marginalize Tamil language and culture.
