title = "Tulsi"

+++
A small shrublike plant commonly  
denoted the “holy basil.” For devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, the tulsi  
plant is a form of Vishnu’s wife **Lakshmi**,  
who is cursed to take birth as a plant.  
According to the story, Lakshmi sits with  
**Vishnu’s** wives, the goddesses **Ganga**  
and **Saraswati**. Ganga makes amorous  
eyes at Vishnu, and when Saraswati  
protests this indecency, a quarrel breaks  
out. By the time it is over, Ganga and  
Saraswati have cursed each other to be  
born on earth as rivers. Vishnu has been

Tuesday  
cursed to be born as a stone (the **shalagram**); and Lakshmi, who tries only to  
mediate the quarrel, is cursed to be born  
as a plant. This plant is thus a form of  
Lakshmi, and pious **Vaishnavas** cultivate a tulsi plant as an act of devotion.  
The plant is especially dear to Vishnu,  
and it is believed that all parts of the  
plant are purifying. Any parts of it used  
in **worship** are especially meritorious—  
whether grinding the leaves to a paste to  
mark one’s body, taking the leaves as  
**prasad** (food offered to a **deity** as an act  
of worship), or using tulsi wood for  
implements or sacrificial fuel.
