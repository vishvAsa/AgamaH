title = "Tortoise Avatar"

+++
Second **avatar** or incarnation of the god  
**Vishnu**. As with all of Vishnu’s avatars,  
the Tortoise avatar came into being in a  
time of crisis and served to restore the  
cosmic balance that had been thrown  
out of equilibrium. In this case the  
source of trouble was the sage  
**Durvasas**, who had cursed the gods to  
become mortal and their heavenly luster to fade. To counter this, the gods  
made a pact with the **demons** that they  
would jointly churn the Ocean of Milk to  
obtain the nectar of immortality, which  
would be equally divided.  
The image of churning here is based  
on traditional dairy practices, in which  
the person churning uses a string to  
rotate a churning paddle. In this  
instance, however, the churning takes  
place on a cosmic scale: The churning  
stick is Mount **Mandara**, the mountain  
that is at the center of the earth; the  
churning string is the divine serpent  
**Vasuki**, who encircles the world; and  
Vishnu himself, in the form of a tortoise,  
dives to the bottom of the ocean to provide a stable base for the churning stick.  
The gods and demons pull Vasuki back  
and forth, spinning the mountain and  
churning the Ocean of Milk. The churning separates the Ocean of Milk into

various components, both good and  
bad. One product is the deadly **halahala**  
poison, which is neutralized by having  
**Shiva** hold it in his throat. Some of the  
other products are the **Kaustubha** jewel,  
the wishing **cow** Surabhi, the **goddess**  
**Lakshmi**, and finally the physician of  
the gods, **Dhanvantari**, who emerges  
from the sea bearing the pot containing  
the nectar of immortality.  
The demons grab the pot of nectar  
and begin to escape, but Vishnu takes  
the form of the enchantress **Mohini** and  
beguiles the demons into giving the pot  
back to her. She gives the pot to the  
gods, who take off with the demons in  
hot pursuit. According to more recent  
traditions, in their flight the gods stop at  
four different holy places on earth—  
**Allahabad**, **Haridwar**, **Ujjain**, and  
**Nasik**—over a twelve-(divine) day span;  
this latter incident is cited as the charter  
myth for the celebration of the **Kumbha**  
**Mela** at these sites on a twelve-**year**  
basis (because a divine day is believed to  
equal a human year).  
The gods finally manage to escape  
their pursuers and divide the nectar  
among themselves, but they fail to  
notice that the demon **Sainhikeya** slips  
into their midst in disguise. As the  
demon begins to drink, the **sun** and  
**moon** alert Vishnu, who uses his discus  
to cut off the demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s  
two halves become immortal because  
they have come into contact with the  
nectar, and both halves are considered  
malevolent celestial beings: the head as  
**Rahu**, the body as **Ketu**. Rahu has particular enmity for the sun and moon,  
since these **deities** are responsible for  
his demise, and tries to swallow them  
whenever he meets them in the **heavens**. He always succeeds, but because he  
no longer has a body to digest them,  
they escape unharmed through Rahu’s  
severed neck. This, of course, is the traditional explanation for solar and lunar  
**eclipses**; the association with the malevolent Rahu has thus led eclipses to be  
seen as highly inauspicious times. See  
also **ocean, churning of the**.
