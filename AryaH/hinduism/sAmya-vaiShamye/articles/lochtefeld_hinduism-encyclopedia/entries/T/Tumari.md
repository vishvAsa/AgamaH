title = "Tumari"

+++
Vessel used by renunciant **ascetics**. In  
earlier times it would have been made of  
a gourd, although today the shape is  
often replicated in brass or some other  
metal. The tumari is taller than it is wide,  
with an open top over which the carrying handle arches. Unlike another piece  
of ascetic equipment, the **kamandalu**,  
which has both a spout and a covered  
top, the tumari is an open vessel. When  
made of a gourd, it would simply have  
entailed cutting parts off of the top for  
the opening, with the remaining top  
parts forming the vesselâ€™s handle.  
Because of its simplicity and use of readily available materials, the tumari was a  
symbol of ascetic life.
