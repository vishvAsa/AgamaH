title = "Tiruppan"

+++
(9th c.) One of the **Alvars**, a group of  
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and their  
stress on passionate devotion (**bhakti**)  
to a personal god, conveyed through  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**,  
transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. According to tradition,  
Tiruppan was a foundling who was  
adopted by a musician. As he grew up,  
he developed deep devotion for **Vishnu**  
in his form as **Ranganatha** at the temple  
of **Shrirangam**, but because his family  
status was unknown, he never went into  
the temple itself out of fear that his presence might render it impure. Tiruppan  
finally gained entrance when one of the  
temple’s **brahmin** priests, who had earlier insulted him, received a divine command to carry Tiruppan on his  
shoulders to Ranganatha’s image. As  
with many stories in the lives of the  
bhakti saints, the lesson here clearly  
emphasizes the superiority of devotion  
over birth. For further information see
