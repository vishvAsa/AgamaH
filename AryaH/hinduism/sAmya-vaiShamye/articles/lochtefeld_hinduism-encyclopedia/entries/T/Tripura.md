(“three cities”) In Hindu mythology, the  
triple city built by the three sons of the  
**demon Taraka**: Kamalaksha, Tarakaksha,  
and Vidyunmali. **Shiva** eventually  
destroyed the demons’ three cities, and  
as a result one of Shiva’s epithets is  
**Tripurari**, the “Enemy of the Three City.”
