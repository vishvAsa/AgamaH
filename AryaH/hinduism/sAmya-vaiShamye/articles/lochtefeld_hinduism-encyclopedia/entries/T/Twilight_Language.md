One of the translations for the term  
**Sandhabhasha**. Sandhabhasha is a  
symbolic language used in **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based religious practice,  
in which the elements of tantric  
**worship** are described in a coded  
language often drawn from the private  
parts and functions of the human  
body. This is done to hide the traditionâ€™s  
particulars from the uninitiated.  
See **Sandhabhasha**.
