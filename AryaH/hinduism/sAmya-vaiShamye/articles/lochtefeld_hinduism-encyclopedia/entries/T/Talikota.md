City in the Bijapur district of the state of  
**Karnataka**, which in 1565 was the site of  
a battle between the **Vijayanagar**  
**dynasty** king Rama Raja and a coalition  
of Muslim sultans from farther north in  
the **Deccan** peninsula. Rama Raja’s disastrous defeat brought the Vijayanagar  
dynasty to an abrupt end. The sultans  
sacked the empire’s capital at **Hampi**,  
and it has never been inhabited since  
that time.
