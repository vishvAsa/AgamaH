title = "West Bengal"

+++
Modern Indian state. It was formed after  
Indian independence in 1947, after the  
partition of the state of Bengal into West  
Bengal and West Pakistan, the latter now  
known as Bangladesh. Most of the state  
lies in the lowland of the **Ganges** River  
delta, although in the north, Darjeeling  
extends into the **Himalayas**. West  
Bengal’s capital, Calcutta, was the  
administrative center of British India  
until the beginning of the twentieth century. It was also a hotbed of anti-British  
resistance and has remained one  
of India’s great artistic and intellectual  
centers. West Bengal has a number  
of important religious sites: **Kalighat**, in  
the heart of Calcutta, and **Dakshineshwar**, **Tarakeshvar**, **Tarapith**, and  
**Navadvip**. For general information  
about West Bengal and all the regions of  
India, an accessible reference is
