title = "White Yajur Veda"

+++
Along with the **Black Yajur Veda**, this is  
one of the two major forms of the Yajur  
Veda, one of the oldest Hindu religious  
texts. The major difference between  
these two forms comes from the  
771  
White Yajur Veda  
differing placement of explanatory  
notes on the Vedic mantras and their significance. The “White” Yajur Veda gathers  
these notes into an appendix known as a  
**Brahmana**—namely, the **Shatapatha**  
**Brahmana**, which gives its name to  
the second major stratum of Vedic texts.  
In contrast, the four recensions of the  
Black Yajur Veda include these notes in the  
text itself.
