title = "West Indies"

+++
A cluster of Caribbean islands with a significant Hindu **diaspora population**. As  
in many other cases, they were originally  
brought to the West Indies as indentured  
agricultural laborers, particularly on  
the sugar plantations, but have now  
lived there so long that they have  
become a part of the local community.  
On some of the islands, particularly  
Trinidad, Hindus have constructed  
temples and established sacred  
sites (**tirthas**) there, as a way of connecting their religious lives to their  
local environment.
