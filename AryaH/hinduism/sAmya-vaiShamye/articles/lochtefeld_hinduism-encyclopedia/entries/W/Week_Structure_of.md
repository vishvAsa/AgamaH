The Hindu week has seven days, just  
like the European **calendar**. Each of the  
days has a presiding planet, is associated with one or more presiding **deities**,  
and (in keeping with the general Indian  
attitude toward time) is deemed more  
or less auspicious. The most unlucky  
days are **Tuesday** and **Saturday**, associated respectively with the **planets Mars**  
and **Saturn**. **Monday** (the **moon**),  
**Thursday** (**Jupiter**), and **Friday** (**Venus**)  
are usually regarded as auspicious days  
since these are judged to be benevolent  
and powerful planets. **Sunday** (the **sun**)  
and **Wednesday** (**Mercury**) have no  
strong associations, because although  
these bodies are seen as benevolent,  
they are also seen as relatively weak in  
their influence.
