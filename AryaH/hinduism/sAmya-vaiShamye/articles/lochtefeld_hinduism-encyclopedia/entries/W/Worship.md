Two separate words can be used to  
describe Hindu worship, with two  
groups of assumptions that come with  
it. The first and most common act of  
worship is called **darshan** (“seeing”), in  
which devotees (**bhakta**) view the image  
of the **deity**, and believe that the deity  
is also looking at them. Darshan is thus  
an interaction between deity and  
devotee, an exchange of glances  
that carries understanding. Worship  
involving **offerings** and objects  
usually falls under the rubric of the word  
**Puja** (“homage”).
