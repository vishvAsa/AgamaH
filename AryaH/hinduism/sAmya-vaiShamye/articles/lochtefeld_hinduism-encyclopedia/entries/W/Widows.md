title = "Widows"

Given the traditional assumption that a  
Hindu woman’s central role is as a wife  
and mother, becoming a widow is  
deemed the worst fate that can befall a  
woman and is seen as the karmic  
fruition of some ghastly former deed.  
Because the underlying assumption of  
the **marriage ceremony** is that the  
bride’s identity becomes assimilated to  
the groom’s, a woman without a  
husband was seen as having lost her  
identity. Furthermore, because she had  
already taken on her dead husband’s  
identity, remarriage was not an option  
for her. Immediately after her husband’s  
death a woman was supposed to remove  
all the symbols of a married woman—  
rubbing the red vermilion from the part  
in her **hair**, breaking her glass bangles,  
and in southern India, cutting the  
thread on her **mangal sutra**. For the rest  
of her life, she was forbidden to wear  
jewelry, colored clothing, or other bodily  
adornments, was supposed to keep her  
hair cropped short, and was supposed  
to devote herself to religious acts for the  
benefit of her dead husband. Because  
she had been widowed, she was also  
considered an unlucky and inauspicious  
person, banned from any and all auspicious events, living out her life doing the  
drudge work in the household. In certain parts of India, it was common practice to burn a widow on her husband’s  
funeral pyre, a rite known as **sati**,  
although there were many other regions  
in which this practice was unheard of.  
In real life, there was considerable  
variation on this grim picture. The most  
significant factors were a woman’s age at  
the time she was widowed, whether she  
had children, and the social status of her  
husband’s family. A woman widowed in  
old age would likely continue as matriarch of the family, a young widow with  
772  
Widows  
Women carry water from the lake in a wedding procession in the town of Udaipur.  
**sons** would retain family status through  
her children, while even a **child widow**  
in a wealthy family could have a fairly  
comfortable life, although subject to  
numerous restrictions. Where one or  
another of these factors was lacking,  
then a widow’s position would be much  
more precarious, and there is no doubt  
that in earlier times many widows led  
very difficult lives. Even in modern  
times a woman whose husband dies at a  
young age is often considered to be  
inauspicious, and thus a source of bad  
fortune. Ameliorating the condition of  
widows was one of the major goals of  
nineteenth-century Hindu reformers,  
and it has become more common for  
widows to remarry, although some of  
the most traditionally minded people do  
not accept this.
