title = "Wind"

+++
One of the five elements in traditional  
Indian **cosmology**, the others being  
**earth**, **fire**, **water**, and **akasha**. In some  
philosophical schools, each of the elements is paired with one of the five senses;  
here wind is associated with touch. The  
various “**vital winds**” (**prana**) inside the  
body are also associated with a number  
of bodily functions, including respiration and circulation.
