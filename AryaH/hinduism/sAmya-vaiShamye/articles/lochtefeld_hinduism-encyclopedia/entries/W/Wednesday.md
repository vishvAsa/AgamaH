title = "Wednesday"

+++
(Budhvar) The fourth **day** of the **week**,  
the presiding **planet** of which is  
**Mercury** (Budh). Although not inauspicious, the day has few strong associations and is not linked to the **worship** of  
any major **deity**. The planet Mercury is  
seen as an auspicious but weak planet,  
based on its small size and its quick  
rotation around the **sun**.
