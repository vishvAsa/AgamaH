title = "Worship of Weapons"

+++
In earlier times, a common rite among  
the warrior classes on the festival of  
**Dussehra** (usually occurring within  
October and November). This festival  
has two different charter myths, both of  
which mark the triumph of good over  
evil. It is celebrated as the day that the  
god **Rama** slew the demon **Ravana**, and  
is also associated with the triumph of  
the **Goddess** over a **demon** named  
**Mahishasura**. Given the martial tone of  
both charter myths, it is easy to see how  
it would be associated with soldiers and  
fighting, and thus this was considered a  
day to **worship** oneâ€™s weapons, as a symbol of the **deity**. According to popular  
belief, any endeavor begun on this festival day will invariably succeed, and for  
this reason, Dussehra has been a  
favored day to begin military campaigns. Since Dussehra comes after the  
end of the monsoon rains, in which any  
travel is nearly impossible, this is a  
favorable time from a strategic perspective as well.
