title = "World Parliament of Religions"

+++
Meeting in Chicago in 1893 to which  
representatives from major world religions were invited, including Asian religions. It marks a watershed in the  
Euro-American conception of nonChristian religions, in which they were  
no longer seen as simple idolatry but  
taken seriously as genuine religious  
paths. It is also notable that many mainline Christian churches were not represented there, and that the main  
Christian presence came from historically black churches. One of the  
Parliament’s highlights was the address  
by **Swami Vivekananda**, in which  
Hinduism—in its rational, Vedantic  
form—was first seriously received by his  
Western hearers. Vivekananda’s presence was charismatic enough that he  
spent the next four years living in  
America and in 1897 founded the  
**Vedanta Society**.
