title = "Worship of Tools"

+++
A rite traditionally performed on the festival of **Dussehra** by members of certain  
artisan groups. This festival has two different charter myths, both of which  
mark the triumph of good over evil. It is  
celebrated as the day that the god **Rama**  
slew the demon **Ravana**, and is also  
associated with the triumph of the  
**Goddess** over a **demon** named **Mahishasura**. For the artisans, such **worship** ritually marks the importance of  
their tools as a means to earn their  
livelihood, and such propitiation is  
also believed to guarantee success for  
the following **year**.
