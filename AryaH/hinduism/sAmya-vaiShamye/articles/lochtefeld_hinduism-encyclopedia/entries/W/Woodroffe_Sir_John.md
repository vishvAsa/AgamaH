(1865–1936) Calcutta High Court Justice  
who also, under the pseudonym of  
Arthur Avalon, translated and published  
works on **tantra**, a secret, ritually based  
religious practice. Woodroffe was one of  
the earliest European exponents of  
tantra as a coherent religious path and  
served as an apologist for the seemingly  
“impure” or “immoral” ritual acts  
described in the texts. In his expositions  
of the tantras, Woodroffe was trying to  
convince a dual audience, both of whom  
were horrified at the licentiousness  
773  
Woodroffe, Sir John  
described in the tantric texts, which  
involve violating deeply embedded  
taboos on nonvegetarian food, consumption of alcohol, and illicit sexuality.  
On the one hand, Woodroffe was  
addressing the British, who were the  
political masters of the time, and on the  
other, educated Indians, many of whom  
would have preferred to dismiss the  
tantras as an aberration. His publications and lectures were instrumental in  
helping make tantrism respectable,  
although more careful scholarly work  
has been done since that time.
