In the **dharma literature**, women from  
all social groups were considered at the  
same ritual level as **shudras**â€”they could  
not undergo a second birth, were forbidden to hear the **Vedas**, were forbidden to  
perform certain religious rites, and in  
many places could not own property or  
resources, except by extension through  
their husbands. At the same time,  
women played (and play) an immensely  
important part in Hindu religious life, as  
**daughters**, mothers, wives, and patrons.  
According to the traditional dharma literature women had their own special  
role to play, based on their status as  
women. See also **stridharma**.
