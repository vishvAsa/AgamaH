The existence of witchcraft is generally  
accepted in many segments of contemporary Hindu culture, even by many  
“modern” urban Hindus. The root forces  
behind witchcraft are malevolence,  
envy, and greed, through which some  
people try to harm others or to ruin  
what they have gained. Witches may  
work through spells, through the evil eye  
(**nazar**), or through pronouncing **curses**  
on others. Pregnant **women** and young  
children are thought to be particularly  
susceptible to their powers, and these  
parties are also deemed particularly  
likely to be cursed, because the envy  
over their good fortune is said to excite  
a witch’s passion. The appropriate  
counteraction is to perform various  
**rites of protection**, which will safeguard  
the person from being affected. Those  
afflicted by witchcraft may exhibit this  
as an unusually persistent illness or as  
strange behavior; for these people,  
stronger remedies are needed. As Sudhir  
Kakar masterfully shows, the language  
of **possession** and exorcism can be  
interpreted as an “idiom” (using traditional Indian cultural categories) for  
what modern psychiatrists might call  
the diagnosis and treatment of mental  
illness. For further information see  
Sudhir Kakar, *Shamans*, *Mystics*, *and*  
*Doctors*, 1991; and David F. Pocock, “The  
Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), *Religion*  
*in India*, 1991.
