title = "Water"

+++
One of the five elements in traditional  
Indian **cosmology**, the others being  
**earth**, **fire**, **wind**, and **akasha**. In some  
philosophical schools, each of the elements is paired with one of the senses;  
here water is associated with taste.  
Within the body, water is also associated  
with certain bodily functions, especially  
reproduction (involving the mixing of  
fluids) and the elimination of fluid  
wastes.
