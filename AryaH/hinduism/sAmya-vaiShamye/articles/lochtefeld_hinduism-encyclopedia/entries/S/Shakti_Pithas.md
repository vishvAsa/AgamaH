(“benches” or “seats” of Shakti)  
General term for a network of sites  
connected with the **worship** of the  
Mother **Goddess**. Although their number differs from source to source—  
some list fifty-one, and others 108—in  
both cases the sites are spread  
throughout the subcontinent, from  
Baluchistan (in modern Pakistan) to  
**Assam** to the deep south. According to  
the charter myth, each of these places  
marks the site where a body part of the  
dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to  
**earth**, taking form as a different goddess in each place. This myth provides  
a way to connect the myriad local  
Hindu goddesses by conceiving them  
as differing manifestations of a single  
primordial Goddess. It also connects  
the subcontinent into a single conceptual unit, knit together by this network  
of sites as the body is connected by its  
members. One should also note that  
different places may claim the same  
body part in the drive to enhance the  
religious prestige of any particular  
site. As but one example, according to  
most “official” lists Sati’s vulva, the  
most powerfully charged part of the  
female body, fell at the temple of  
**Kamakhya** in **Assam**, but the same  
claim is made at **Kalimath** in the  
**Himalayas**. Suffice it to say that there  
is no single authoritative list of sites,  
and competing claims are not unusual. See also **pitha**.
