title = "Six Schools"

+++
Collective name for the six developed  
schools of traditional Hindu **philosophy**. All six schools consider the religious texts known as the **Vedas** to be the  
most authoritative **pramana**, the means  
by which human beings can gain true  
and accurate knowledge. All six schools  
also assume that philosophical reflection must ultimately serve religious  
goals, to release the embodied soul  
(**atman**) from an otherwise unending  
cycle of transmigration. Aside from  
these basic similarities, each of these  
schools developed distinctive and characteristic perspectives. Despite their differences, by the early centuries of the  
common era the schools had become  
associated in pairs: **Nyaya**-**Vaisheshika**,  
**Samkhya**-**Yoga**, and **Purva Mimamsa**Uttara Mimamsa, with the final school  
more commonly known as **Vedanta**.  
Of these, the Nyaya school focused  
on examining and cataloguing the pramanas, the means by which human  
beings can gain true and accurate  
knowledge, and their conclusions  
became accepted by all six schools. The  
Vaisheshika school was a descriptive  
ontology that categorized the world in  
atomistic fashion, in which all things  
were considered to be constructed from  
smaller parts. This school had inherent  
philosophical problems that contributed to its eclipse. **Samkhya** is an  
atheistic dualism based on the distinction between a conscious but inert  
654  
Sitamarhi  
**purusha** (“person,” or spirit), and an  
unconscious but active **prakrti**  
(“nature”). According to the Samkhya  
proponents, failure to discriminate  
between the two leads to the **evolution**  
of the world and the individual person,  
whereas correct understanding reverses  
this process. Samkhya provides the theoretical basis for the Yoga school, which  
essentially details techniques to help  
one gain the correct understanding  
between these two entities. Purva  
Mimamsa stresses the study of the Vedas  
as the source of instruction for human  
beings, an emphasis that led it to  
develop sophisticated theories of language and methods for textual interpretation. These tools were used by the  
Vedanta school in its efforts to reveal the  
ultimate meaning of the Vedas. Most of  
the first millennium during the common era was a time of lively debate  
among these schools, each of which  
held varying positions on basic things  
such as the reality of the world. By the  
end of the millennium Vedanta had  
become the most significant philosophical perspective, largely eclipsing the  
others, although it had absorbed certain  
influences from them. For further information see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
