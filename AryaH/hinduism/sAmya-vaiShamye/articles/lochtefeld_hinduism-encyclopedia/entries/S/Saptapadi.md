(“seven steps”) The most important rite  
in the Hindu **marriage ceremony**, in  
which the bride and groom take seven  
steps together to symbolize their marital  
union. The seventh step completes the  
transfer of the bride from her natal family to the groom’s family and is also the  
point when the marriage becomes permanent. As described in the **dharma literature**, the bride and groom would  
perform this rite by taking seven steps in  
a straight line. In contemporary times  
this rite is often combined with the  
**agnipradakshinam** (“circumambulating the **fire**”), in which the bride and  
groom make seven revolutions around a  
small fire—considered to be a form of  
the god **Agni** and thus the divine witness  
to the marriage. While circling the fire,  
the bride and groom are often physically  
joined by tying part of his turban to the  
edge of her sari as a visible sign of their  
marital union.
