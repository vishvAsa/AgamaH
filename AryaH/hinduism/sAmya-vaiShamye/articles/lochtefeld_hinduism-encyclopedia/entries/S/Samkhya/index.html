  <meta property="og:description" content="(“enumeration”) One of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, whose
founding text is the Samkhyakarikas,
written by Ishvarakrishna in the third
century B.C.E. Samkhya espouses an
atheistic philosophical dualism positing
two fundamental principles as the
source of all things. The first of these is
called purusha (“person”), which is conscious, but completely inactive and
unchanging. It is seen as a passive witness to the transformations going on
around it. As the source of consciousness, purusha is ultimately identified
with an individual’s true and eternal
Self. Purusha is inferred as plural, given
the plurality of conscious beings, combined with the fact that one person can
gain enlightenment while all the rest
remain in bondage.
The other fundamental principle is
prakrti, (“nature”), which provides the
object to the purusha’s subject. Prakrti is
better conceived of as force or power
rather than a specific material object.
Prakrti contains within it forces with three
different primordial qualities (gunas):
587
Samkhya
sattva tends toward the good, rajas
towards activity or passion, and tamas
towards darkness and decay. In the primal prakrti these three forces are in perfect equilibrium, each perfectly balancing the others. The two principles of
purusha and prakrti are distinct, separate, and alone.
When prakrti’s initial equilibrium is
disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern of
evolution that creates both the exterior
physical world and the interior psychological world. From prakrti emerges
mahat (“the great one”), which has as its
psychological counterpart the subtlest
form of mental activity (buddhi). From
buddhi evolves ahamkar, which contains the first real ideas of individual
identity. From ahamkar evolves the
mind (manas), the sense organs (jnanendriyas), the organs of action (karmendriyas), and the subtle elements
(tanmatras); from the last evolve the
gross elements that actually make up
the material world. All of these evolutes—material or psychic—have a differing balance of the three gunas, which
ultimately determines their character as
wholesome, active, or unwholesome.
Throughout this process of evolution,
purusha remains unchanged, a mere
witness to prakrti’s unceasing transformations. Their mutual functioning is
described using the metaphor of the
lame man (purusha) being carried by
the blind man (prakrti).
The ultimate source of bondage,
according to the Samkhya school,
comes because people do not recognize
the difference between these two principles. Through this lack of discrimination
between the two, the Self (purusha)
appears as if it is an agent, and the evolutes (from prakrti) as if they are conscious. The Samkhyas illustrate this misunderstanding using the example of the
rose behind the crystal, in which the latter appears to be colored but is in fact
unchanged. Although for the Samkhyas
prakrti undergoes real transformations,
the primary problem is epistemological—that is, how one comes to know
things—rather than ontological, or rooted
in the nature of things themselves. Since
the purusha never changes, there is no
question of making it into anything else
or regaining the way that it used to be;
the real problem is making the distinction between the differing realities of
these two principles. Once this has been
done, the evolution of prakrti is said to
reverse, leaving the purusha again in its
state of magnificent isolation (kaivalya).
Of course, once one has a developed (if
erroneous) idea of (conventional) personality, this discrimination becomes all
the more difficult. This mistaken idea
becomes the basis for one’s volitional
actions (karma) and one’s emotional
dispositions. One’s actions and dispositions reinforce each other, and both of
these are undergirded by the notion of a
Self.
The Samkhya metaphysics were
adopted wholesale by the yoga philosophical school, and the two schools are
usually mentioned together—Samkhya
as the theoretical foundation, and Yoga
as the practical component. One of
Samkhya’s lasting contributions to
Indian thought is the idea of the gunas, a
basic concept running through Hindu
culture. Another influential but less pervasive idea is their model of evolution,
which has been adapted by other
schools but often subsumed under theistic assumptions in which God is the
source of both consciousness and the
material world. The one philosophical
problem that the Samkhya could never
surmount was to explain the source of
bondage, given their starting assumptions. If purusha and prakrti are completely separate, how could the two of
them interact—much less mistake one
for the other—and how did the process
of evolution begin? Although their contributions remain significant, they were
largely eclipsed by Vedanta, which
claimed that the problem is ignorance of
the Self and not-Self, and that the world
around us is not an actual evolution, but
only an illusory transformation (vivarta).
This philosophical model is called
Vivartavada. For further information

written by <strong>Ishvarakrishna</strong> in the third<br>
century B.C.E. Samkhya espouses an<br>
atheistic philosophical dualism positing<br>
two fundamental principles as the<br>
source of all things. The first of these is<br>
called <strong>purusha</strong> (“person”), which is conscious, but completely inactive and<br>
unchanging. It is seen as a passive witness to the transformations going on<br>
around it. As the source of consciousness, purusha is ultimately identified<br>
with an individual’s true and eternal<br>
Self. Purusha is inferred as plural, given<br>
the plurality of conscious beings, combined with the fact that one person can<br>
gain enlightenment while all the rest<br>
remain in bondage.<br>
The other fundamental principle is<br>
<strong>prakrti</strong>, (“nature”), which provides the<br>
object to the purusha’s subject. Prakrti is<br>
better conceived of as force or power<br>
rather than a specific material object.<br>
Prakrti contains within it forces with three<br>
different primordial qualities (<strong>gunas</strong>):<br>
587<br>
Samkhya<br>
<strong>sattva</strong> tends toward the good, <strong>rajas</strong><br>
towards activity or passion, and <strong>tamas</strong><br>
towards darkness and decay. In the primal prakrti these three forces are in perfect equilibrium, each perfectly balancing the others. The two principles of<br>
purusha and prakrti are distinct, separate, and alone.<br>
When prakrti’s initial equilibrium is<br>
disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern of<br>
<strong>evolution</strong> that creates both the exterior<br>
physical world and the interior psychological world. From prakrti emerges<br>
<strong>mahat</strong> (“the great one”), which has as its<br>
psychological counterpart the subtlest<br>
form of mental activity (<strong>buddhi</strong>). From<br>
buddhi evolves <strong>ahamkar</strong>, which contains the first real ideas of individual<br>
identity. From ahamkar evolves the<br>
mind (<strong>manas</strong>), the sense organs (<strong>jnanendriyas</strong>), the organs of action (<strong>karmendriyas</strong>), and the subtle elements<br>
(<strong>tanmatras</strong>); from the last evolve the<br>
gross elements that actually make up<br>
the material world. All of these evolutes—material or psychic—have a differing balance of the three gunas, which<br>
ultimately determines their character as<br>
wholesome, active, or unwholesome.<br>
Throughout this process of evolution,<br>
purusha remains unchanged, a mere<br>
witness to prakrti’s unceasing transformations. Their mutual functioning is<br>
described using the metaphor of the<br>
lame man (purusha) being carried by<br>
the blind man (prakrti).<br>
The ultimate source of bondage,<br>
according to the Samkhya school,<br>
comes because people do not recognize<br>
the difference between these two principles. Through this lack of discrimination<br>
between the two, the Self (purusha)<br>
appears as if it is an agent, and the evolutes (from prakrti) as if they are conscious. The Samkhyas illustrate this misunderstanding using the example of the<br>
rose behind the crystal, in which the latter appears to be colored but is in fact<br>
unchanged. Although for the Samkhyas<br>
prakrti undergoes real transformations,<br>
the primary problem is epistemological—that is, how one comes to know<br>
things—rather than ontological, or rooted<br>
in the nature of things themselves. Since<br>
the purusha never changes, there is no<br>
question of making it into anything else<br>
or regaining the way that it used to be;<br>
the real problem is making the distinction between the differing realities of<br>
these two principles. Once this has been<br>
done, the evolution of prakrti is said to<br>
reverse, leaving the purusha again in its<br>
state of magnificent isolation (<strong>kaivalya</strong>).<br>
Of course, once one has a developed (if<br>
erroneous) idea of (conventional) personality, this discrimination becomes all<br>
the more difficult. This mistaken idea<br>
becomes the basis for one’s volitional<br>
actions (<strong>karma</strong>) and one’s emotional<br>
dispositions. One’s actions and dispositions reinforce each other, and both of<br>
these are undergirded by the notion of a<br>
Self.<br>
The Samkhya metaphysics were<br>
adopted wholesale by the <strong>yoga</strong> philosophical school, and the two schools are<br>
usually mentioned together—Samkhya<br>
as the theoretical foundation, and Yoga<br>
as the practical component. One of<br>
Samkhya’s lasting contributions to<br>
Indian thought is the idea of the gunas, a<br>
basic concept running through Hindu<br>
culture. Another influential but less pervasive idea is their model of evolution,<br>
which has been adapted by other<br>
schools but often subsumed under theistic assumptions in which God is the<br>
source of both consciousness and the<br>
material world. The one philosophical<br>
problem that the Samkhya could never<br>
surmount was to explain the source of<br>
bondage, given their starting assumptions. If purusha and prakrti are completely separate, how could the two of<br>
them interact—much less mistake one<br>
for the other—and how did the process<br>
of evolution begin? Although their contributions remain significant, they were<br>
largely eclipsed by <strong>Vedanta</strong>, which<br>
claimed that the problem is ignorance of<br>
the Self and not-Self, and that the world<br>
around us is not an actual evolution, but<br>
only an illusory transformation (vivarta).<br>
This philosophical model is called<br>
<strong>Vivartavada</strong>. For further information<br>
