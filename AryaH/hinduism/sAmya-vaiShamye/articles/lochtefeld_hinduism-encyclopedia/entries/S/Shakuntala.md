title = "Shakuntala"

+++
A figure in Hindu mythology and the  
protagonist in the drama **Abhijnanashakuntala** written by the poet  
**Kalidasa**. Shakuntala is the daughter  
of the **apsara Menaka** and the sage  
**Vishvamitra**, conceived when Menaka  
is sent to seduce Vishvamitra in an  
attempt to reduce his spiritual powers.  
Shakuntala is raised at the **ashram** of  
the sage Kanva, where she grows into a  
beautiful young woman. One day she  
attracts the eye of King **Dushyanta**,  
who has been hunting in the forest,  
and they are married by the **gandharva** form of marriage (consensual sexual intercourse), conceiving their son  
**Bharata**. Shakuntala’s happiness,  
however, is short-lived. As she is thinking one day about Dushyanta, who has  
traveled back to his capital without  
her, she fails to notice the arrival of the  
sage **Durvasas**. In his anger at being  
ignored, Durvasas lays a curse that her  
beloved will completely forget her.  
Shakuntala, horrified, manages to  
convince Durvasas to modify the  
**curse**: Dushyanta will remember  
everything, as soon as Shakuntala  
shows him proof of their union.  
Shakuntala has Dushyanta’s signet  
ring as proof, but she loses it on her  
way to see Dushyanta. Dushyanta (as  
expected) denies that he has ever met  
Shakuntala, and she eventually ends  
up working as one of the palace cooks.  
Her salvation comes unexpectedly,  
when she finds the missing ring in the  
belly of a fish she is preparing for the  
king’s dinner. When she shows him the  
ring, Dushyanta immediately recognizes Shakuntala and acknowledges  
her as his wife, and the couple live  
happily ever after.
