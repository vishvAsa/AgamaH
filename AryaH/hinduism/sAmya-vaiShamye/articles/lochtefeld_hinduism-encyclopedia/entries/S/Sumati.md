title = "Sumati"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of  
King **Sagar**. Through a sage’s boon,  
Sumati and her co-wife **Keshini** are  
given a choice in the number of children  
they would bear—one will bear a single  
son through whom the lineage will continue, whereas the other will bear sixty  
thousand sons who will die before they  
have any offspring. Sumati chooses the  
latter, and when her sixty thousand  
handsome sons go out to search for  
their father’s sacrificial horse, they are  
burned to ash by the fury of the sage  
**Kapila**. Although these sons die without  
issue they still have a profound affect on  
the world, since Keshini’s descendants  
bring the River **Ganges** down to earth to  
bring peace to their souls.
