title = "Shikhandi"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, the rebirth of  
the maiden **Amba**, daughter of the  
king of **Kashi**. Amba and her sisters  
have been kidnapped by **Bhishma** to  
be married to his nephew  
**Vichitravirya**, but when she informs  
Bhishma that her heart already  
belongs to King Salva, Bhishma gallantly releases her. Yet Salva refuses to  
marry her, for since she has been kidnapped he is not certain of her virginity. Amba then returns to Bhishma,  
who refuses to marry her because of  
his vow to remain a lifelong bachelor.  
In her anger Amba swears to get  
revenge on Bhishma and performs  
628  
Shesha  
harsh physical **asceticism** (**tapas**) to  
generate the spiritual powers necessary to do this. Her austerities eventually please the god **Shiva**, who  
promises her that she will be rewarded in her next **birth**. Amba then raises  
a pyre and burns herself to death.  
Amba is reborn as Shikhandi to  
King **Drupada**, whose wife has  
received a boon that she will give birth  
to a girl, but that the girl will later be  
transformed into a boy. When  
Shikhandi is born, it is announced  
that the child is a boy and the child is  
given the training appropriate for a  
prince. It is only upon fixing  
a marriage for Shikhandi that the  
issue of the child’s gender comes up  
and it is finally resolved when  
Shikhandi exchanges sexes with a  
nature spirit (**yaksha**) named  
**Sthunakarna**, who becomes a  
woman, and Shikhandi a man. The  
switch is originally intended to be for  
only a short period, but is later  
extended until Shikhandi’s death, at  
which time Sthunakarna again  
becomes male.  
During the Mahabharata war  
Shikhandi challenges **Bhishma** in battle but the latter refuses to fight him,  
since Shikhandi has been born a  
woman. Shikhandi takes advantage of  
this gallantry to shoot a barrage of  
arrows at Bhishma, as does the warrior  
**Arjuna**, who hides behind Shikhandi  
for protection. With this assault,  
Bhishma finally decides that the time  
has come for him to give up the fight  
and die. In the battle that follows after  
Bhishma falls, Shikhandi is killed by  
**Ashvatthama**, the **son** of **Drona**, who  
fights on the side of the **Kauravas** in  
the war. Based on Shikhandi’s role in  
shielding Arjuna from harm, in modern **Hindi** the name Shikhandi is used  
to designate a scapegoat, someone  
behind whom another person hides  
and escapes blame.
