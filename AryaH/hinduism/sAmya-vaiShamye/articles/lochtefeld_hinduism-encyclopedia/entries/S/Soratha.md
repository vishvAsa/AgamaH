title = "Soratha"

+++
Metrical form in northern Indian devotional (**bhakti**) poetry, made up of two  
lines of twenty-four metric beats, divided  
unevenly after the eleventh beat. The  
metric pattern for the first line is 6+4+1,  
with the pattern for the second line  
being 6+4+3. The soratha is thus an  
inversion of the metrical form **doha**.  
Although the soratha was a common  
poetic form, the doha was far more popular and widely used.
