Island in the **Cauvery** River, just north of  
the town of **Tiruchirappalli** in the state  
of **Tamil Nadu**. The site is most famous  
for the Ranganathaswamy Temple, dedicated to the god **Vishnu** in his form as  
**Ranganatha**, who is sleeping on the  
back of his serpent couch **Shesha** in the  
sea of cosmic dissolution (**pralaya**). The  
temple is built in the **Dravida** style of  
**architecture**, in which the temple buildings are of modest height but cover an  
immensely large area and are surrounded  
by a boundary wall with massive towers  
(**gopurams**) over each wall’s central  
gateway. In the temple’s outer zones one  
often finds shops and houses, making  
such temples veritable cities in their  
own right. The Ranganathaswamy temple has a series of seven concentric processional streets, making it one of the  
largest temples in India. It was built in  
stages by the various dynasties that  
controlled this part of southern India—  
**Chera**, **Pandya**, **Chola**, **Hoysala**, and  
**Vijayanagar**—although the bulk of the  
construction was done by the last two.  
Since Vishnu’s image is that of the divine  
king, it is hardly surprising that each of  
these regional dynasties patronized this  
site, as a way of using this divine  
imagery to support and validate their  
own right to rule.
