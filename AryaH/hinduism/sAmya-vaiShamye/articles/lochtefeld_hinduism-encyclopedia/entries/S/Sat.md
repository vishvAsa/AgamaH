title = "Sat"

+++
In Indian philosophical thought, the  
most basic denotation for “that which  
(really and truly) exists.” The term is a  
present participle of the verb “to be,” so  
a fairly common translation is “Being,”  
but the word also carries connotations  
relating to the idea of Truth—that things  
that exist are both “real” and “true.” Sat  
is the first of the three attributes traditionally ascribed to the unqualified, ultimate **Brahman** as **sacchidananda**,  
along with consciousness (chit) and  
bliss (**ananda**).
