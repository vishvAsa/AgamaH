(“**Shankara’s** victory tour”) A written  
account of the life of the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya** traditionally attributed to the fourteenth-century writer  
Madhavacharya, although evidence  
within the work points to composition  
several centuries later. The story is clearly  
hagiographical, for it is filled with fantastic legends intended to highlight  
Shankaracharya’s achievements and his  
ultimate identity with the god **Shiva**  
himself. According to this story, after  
gaining full wisdom, Shankaracharya  
embarks on a “victory tour” (digvijaya)  
of India. During this tour he travels  
throughout the country, debates all  
opponents, and defeats them all convincingly, thus establishing the  
supremacy of his **Advaita Vedanta**  
philosophical school. The motif of the  
digvijaya (literally, “conquest of [all]  
directions”) was a common theme in  
works about political and military leaders, and here it has been adapted to tell  
a religious story.
