title = "Sanjaya"

+++
Minister of the blind king **Dhrtarashtra**,  
an important older figure in the Hindu  
epic the **Mahabharata**. Sanjaya tries  
valiantly to avert the war that is the epic’s  
climax by counseling the king to better  
control his son **Duryodhana**, and to deal  
more equitably with his nephews the  
**Pandavas**, the five brothers who are the  
epic’s protagonists. In the end, the king  
ignores Sanjaya’s advice. Sanjaya is most  
famous for his ability to see anything he  
thinks about (“tele-vision”). This power is  
given to him as a gift from the sage **Vyasa**  
so he can describe the progress of the war  
to Dhrtarashtra without actually having to  
be there. After the war, Sanjaya goes to live  
in the forest with Dhrtarashtra, and it is he  
who informs the Pandavas about the blind  
king’s death in a forest fire.
