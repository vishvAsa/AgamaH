title = "Solah Somvar Vrat"

+++
A religious vow (**vrat**) that is a variant of  
the **worship** of the god **Shiva** prescribed  
for every **Monday** (**Somvar**), the day of  
the **week** over which he is believed to  
preside. In the Solah Somvar Vrat, the  
observer vows to do perform this rite for  
sixteen (solah) consecutive Mondays.  
Each week’s observance is marked by  
fasting (**upavasa**), worship, and reading  
aloud the charter myth for this particular observance. As with most literature  
pertaining to such rites, the text ends  
with a catalog of the benefits brought by  
the rite—in essence, it gives whatever  
one desires.  
According to the vow’s charter myth,  
as Shiva and his wife **Parvati** are playing  
dice in a temple, Parvati asks a nearby  
**brahmin** which of them will win, and  
when he replies that it will be Shiva, she  
angrily curses him to be afflicted with leprosy. The curse comes true (as with all  
**curses** in Indian mythology) and the  
brahmin is in a terrible state. Shiva takes  
pity on the brahmin, tells him to perform  
the Solah Somvar Vrat, and on the sixteenth Monday, the brahmin is completely  
cured. Some time later Parvati sees him  
and is amazed at his recovery. When she  
asks how he has been cured, the brahmin  
tells her about the vow, which she later  
uses to cure her son of disobedience (thus  
emphasizing the power of the vow, since  
it is even used by the gods themselves).
