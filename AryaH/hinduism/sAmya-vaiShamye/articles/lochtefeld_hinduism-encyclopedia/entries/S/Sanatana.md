In Hindu mythology, one of four sages  
born of the god **Brahma** who are paradigms of **asceticism**; the other three  
ascetics are **Sanaka**, **Sanandana**, and  
**Sanatkumara**. When Brahma emanates  
these four sages, he commands them  
to begin the work of creation, but they  
are so detached from worldly concerns that they refuse to do so. They  
are celibate their entire lives, study  
the **Vedas** from childhood, and always  
travel together.
