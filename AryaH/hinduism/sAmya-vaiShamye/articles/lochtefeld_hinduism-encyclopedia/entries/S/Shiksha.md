(“learning”) One of the six **Vedangas**.  
These were the supplemental branches of knowledge connected with the  
**Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious  
texts, and all the Vedangas were associated with the use of the Vedas.  
Shiksha was concerned with articulation, proper pronunciation, and the  
laws of euphonic combination (**sandhi**), that is, sounds combined in a certain way to have a pleasant effect.  
Although this may sound trivial, it  
was a central concern in the cult of  
**sacrifice** laid out in the **Brahmana**  
literature. This was because the  
power of these sacrifices was believed  
to depend on the proper delivery of  
the Vedic **mantras**, with any mistake  
being potentially ruinous. Aside from  
shiksha, the other Vedangas are **vyakarana** (**Sanskrit** grammar), **chandas**  
(Sanskrit prosody), **kalpa** (ritual  
instructions), **nirukta** (etymology),  
and **jyotisha** (favorable times for  
sacrifices).
