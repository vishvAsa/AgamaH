(“**liquor**-drinking”) In the **dharma literature**, one of the **Four Great Crimes**  
whose commission made one an outcast from society. Although in modern  
times the word *sura* is the term for  
“wine,” here it was believed to refer to a  
particular type of spirituous liquor  
made from rice flour. For members of  
the three highest social groups—**brahmins**, **kshatriyas**, and **vaishyas**, the  
most commonly prescribed penance  
(**prayashchitta**) for habitually drinking  
sura was to drink this same beverage  
boiling hot, until one died. Interestingly,  
this penalty does not apply to members  
of the lowest social class, the **shudras**.  
This difference reflected their lower status, in which they were not held to the  
same sorts of scrupulous standards as  
the “**twice-born**.” Despite the harsh  
penalty for drinking sura, there were  
other sorts of **intoxicants** that kshatriyas  
and vaishyas could drink without penalty,  
although brahmins who drank these  
had to perform mild penances.
