title = "Satyavati"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the mother of the  
sage **Vyasa**. Satyavati is born in an  
unusual way. Her mother, a celestial  
nymph who lives as a fish in the  
**Ganges** as the result of a **curse**, one  
day swallows some **semen** that has  
fallen into the Ganges, becomes pregnant, and delivers a **son** and a **daughter**. Satyavati grows into a beautiful  
young woman, but because of her origins she always smells of fish, and  
because of this is also called  
Matsyagandhi (“fish-scent”). She  
works ferrying passengers across the  
Ganges and one day ferries the sage  
**Parashara**, who is struck by her  
charms. Parashara creates an artificial  
fog to give the two of them privacy, has  
sexual relations with her, and grants  
that from that day onward Satyavati  
will smell of musk instead of fish. The  
son born of this union is Vyasa.  
Satyavati continues to ply her trade,  
and one day ferries King **Shantanu**, who  
is also struck by her beauty. Before she  
will marry him she demands that her sons  
will rule Shantanu’s kingdom. Shantanu  
agrees; and to give her absolute certainty,  
his son **Bhishma** takes a vow that he will  
never marry, so that his line will never  
compete with hers. Satyavati has two  
sons: Chitrangada dies in childhood, and  
**Vichitravirya** dies after he marries the  
princesses **Ambika** and **Ambalika** but  
before having any children. In desperation, Satyavati thinks of her first son  
Vyasa, who conceives a son with each of  
the wives: **Pandu** from Ambalika, and  
**Dhrtarashtra** from Ambika. The descendants of these two sons are the warring  
families in the **Sanskrit** epic  
**Mahabharata**, of which Vyasa is famed as  
the narrator.
