title = "Sena Dynasty"

+++
(11thâ€“13th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty  
whose ancestral homeland was in the  
Bengal region but whose territory also  
614  
Self-Revealing Knowledge  
included the western part of the state of  
**Bihar**. The Senas were originally vassals  
of the **Pala dynasty** but became independent in 1097 and later seized much  
of the Pala domain in Bihar. The Sena  
dynasty survived until 1245, when it was  
finally conquered by the Mamluks, who  
had been seizing Sena territory since the  
beginning of that century. The Senas  
(and their predecessors, the Palas) are  
particularly noted for a certain type of  
**sculpture** in which the images were  
carved from black chlorite schist that  
was polished to a mirror finish.
