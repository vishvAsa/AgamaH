title = "Sandhabhasha"

+++
Symbolic language used in **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based religious practice. The literal translation of the term  
is disputed; it is often translated as  
“twilight language” because of its  
shadowy and mysterious character,  
but Agehananda Bharati is emphatic  
that the term means “**intentional language**.” The elements of tantric **worship** and practice are described in a  
coded language drawn from the parts  
and functions of the human body considered private by most standards.  
Such coded discourse is used to hide  
the tradition’s essentials from noninitiates and also to project the speakers  
into an altered understanding. For  
noninitiates, such language reinforces  
the general conception of tantric practitioners as completely debased.  
Douglas R. Brooks reports in *The*  
*Secret of the Three Cities*, 1990, that  
although widely used in Buddhist  
tantra, Sandhabhasha is less common  
among Hindus, who for their coded  
language favor using common words  
with contextually technical meanings.
