title = "Shiwalik Goddesses"

+++
Local goddesses from the **Shiwalik hills**  
separating the **Himalayas** from the  
northern Indian plain. Some have little  
importance beyond the borders of their  
particular villages, whereas others have  
become important regional **deities**. As  
with all the goddesses of India, the  
Shiwalik goddesses are considered to be  
manifestations of the same feminine  
divine energy—the **Goddess**. As one  
637  
Shiwalik Goddesses  
sign of this identity, many of these sites  
are claimed to be **Shakti Pithas**—places  
where a part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth** and took form as a  
different goddess. Shiwalik goddesses  
are also thought of as relatives. Kathleen  
Erndl mentions seven goddesses, known  
as the Seven Sisters: **Vaishno Devi**,  
**Jwalamukhi**, **Vajreshvari Devi**, **Chintapurni**, **Naina Devi**, **Chamunda**, and  
**Mansa Devi**. Modern **Hindi** language  
sources list nine—the seven just mentioned plus **Shakumbhari Devi** and  
**Kalika Devi**. This group of nine is scattered in three different Indian states  
along the Shiwalik Range: Seven are in  
**Himachal Pradesh**, Vaishno Devi is in  
**Jammu** and **Kashmir**, and Shakumbhari  
Devi is in **Uttar Pradesh**. The pantheon  
here is fairly flexible, and the goddesses  
mentioned in these lists will probably  
vary over time, partly reflecting the success or failure to establish the holiness  
of these sites. For further information on  
the Shiwalik goddesses and **worship** of  
the Mother Goddess in northwestern  
India, see Kathleen Erndl, *Victory To The*  
*Mother*, 1993. See also **pitha**.
