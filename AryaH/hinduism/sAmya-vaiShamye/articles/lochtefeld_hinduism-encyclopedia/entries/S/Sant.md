title = "Sant"

Literally, someone who has found the  
truth, or who is searching for it. The  
word is derived from the **Sanskrit** word  
**sat** (“truth”). More generally it refers to  
two major groups of devotional (**bhakti**)  
poet-saints. One group was centered  
around the temple of **Vithoba** at  
**Pandharpur** in the state of **Maharashtra**,  
and includes saints from the **Varkari**  
**Panth** community such as **Namdev**,  
**Tukaram**, **Chokamela**, and **Eknath**.  
The other group included later poetsaints from various places in northern  
India, among them **Kabir**, **Ravidas**,  
**Dadu**, and Guru Nanak, the founder of  
the Sikh community.  
As a group the sants shared certain  
general tendencies rather than an  
explicit body of doctrine. Sant religion  
was inclined to stress an individualized, interior religion leading to a personal experience of the divine, rather  
than participation in established cults.  
One of the most common sant themes  
was their disdain for external ritual,  
and the general rejection of any **worship** using images. The northern  
Indian sants are the most uncompromising advocates of **nirguna** devotion,  
in which the divine is seen as beyond  
conception; but even among the  
Pandharpur devotees (**bhakta**) the  
stress was on devotion to the god  
Vithoba, rather than actual worship.  
The sants stressed the power of the  
divine Name and its ability to remove  
all obstacles. They disregarded **caste**  
distinctions, viewing them as an arbitrary barrier dividing the human community. They stressed instead the value  
of **satsang**, and the transforming  
effects that such “good company”  
could bring. Satsang thus formed an  
egalitarian community through the  
common bonds of faith and devotion,  
as an alternative to the hierarchical  
society established by birth.  
It is sometimes suggested that all of  
these themes can be traced to the sants’  
social background, since many of them

An illustrated page of Sanskrit from the first chapter of the *Devimahatmya*.  
The illustration depicts the opening episode, in which a king and a merchant visit a hermit.  
came from very low caste communities. It  
is certainly true that devotees of low social  
status would have been forbidden even to  
enter temples, much less worship the  
images in those temples, and thus a religious path emphasizing the Name and  
interior religious experience, which are  
accessible to everyone, might have  
seemed a more viable option. In the same  
way, the socially oppressed might find the  
notion of an alternative, egalitarian community immensely attractive. Yet to  
reduce the sant tradition to a simple reaction by marginal social groups cannot  
explain why one of its major figures is  
Eknath, a **brahmin**. Such reductionist  
analyses ignore the sant movement’s real  
thrust, namely the passionate search for  
the divine that permitted no compromises and no excuses. For further information see Karine Schomer and W. H.
