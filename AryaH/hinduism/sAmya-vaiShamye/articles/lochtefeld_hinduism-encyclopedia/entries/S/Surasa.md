In Hindu mythology, Surasa is the mother  
of all the **Nagas**, a class of minor  
divinities conceived in the form of serpents. In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of  
the two great Indian epics, Surasa takes  
the form of a gigantic serpent to test the  
fortitude of the monkey-god **Hanuman**,  
who jumps over the sea to **Lanka** to  
search for **Sita**, the god **Rama’s** kidnapped wife. Surasa tells Hanuman that  
no one can go by without passing  
through her mouth, and in response  
Hanuman makes himself larger and  
larger. Surasa in turn opens her jaws  
wider and wider, and finally Hanuman  
becomes very small and darts in and out  
of her mouth. Surasa, pleased with  
Hanuman’s ingenuity and courage, gives  
him her blessing.
