+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Sumantra is one of  
the ministers of King **Dasharatha**, the  
father of **Rama**. As Rama, his wife **Sita**,  
and his brother **Lakshmana** are going  
into exile, Sumantra accompanies  
them to the River **Ganges** to make sure  
that the trio will comply with their  
orders. When the three board the boat  
on which the boatman **Guha** will take  
them over the river, Sumantra bids  
Rama a tearful farewell.
