(“holy mountain”) Sacred mountain in  
the center of the state of **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**, about 185 miles south and  
slightly east of Hyderabad. The site is  
remote and difficult to reach but is  
famous for a temple sacred to the god  
**Shiva**, in his manifestation as **Mallikarjuna**, “[Lord] White as Jasmine.”  
Shiva’s image as Mallikarjuna is in the  
form of a **linga**, the pillar-shaped image  
that is his symbolic form, and the  
Mallikarjuna linga is one of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a network of sites deemed  
especially sacred to Shiva, and at which  
**Shiva** is uniquely present.
