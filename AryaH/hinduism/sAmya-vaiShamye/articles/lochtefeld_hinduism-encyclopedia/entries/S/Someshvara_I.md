(r. 1042–1068) Monarch in the **Chalukya**  
**dynasty**. Aside from his long reign, he is  
most noted for performing religious **suicide** by intentionally drowning himself  
in the **Tungabhadra River** when his  
mental faculties began to wane.  
Although in general suicide was strongly  
condemned, suicide by a person suffering from a terminal disease or enduring  
chronic pain was a well-attested exception to this rule. This sort of suicide was  
performed according to a well-defined  
ritual, which was intended to put the  
performer in the proper frame of mind.  
In about the twelfth century this was  
declared one of the rites “forbidden in  
659  
Someshvara 1  
the **Kali** [Age]” (**Kalivarjya**), although it  
had been permitted in earlier times.
