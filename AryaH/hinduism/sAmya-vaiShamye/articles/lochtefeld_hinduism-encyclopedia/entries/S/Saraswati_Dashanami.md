title = "Saraswati Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**. The Dashanamis were supposedly  
established by the ninth-century  
philosopher **Shankaracharya** in an  
effort to create a corps of learned men  
who could help to revitalize Hindu life.  
Each of the divisions is designated by a  
different name—in this case, **Saraswati**  
(the patron **goddess** of learning and culture). Upon **initiation**, new members  
are given this name as a surname to  
their new **ascetic** names, thus allowing  
for immediate group identification.  
These ten “named” divisions of  
Dashanami Sanyasis are divided into  
four larger organizational groups. Each  
group has its headquarters in one of the  
four monastic centers (**maths**) supposedly established by Shankaracharya, as  
well as other particular religious associations. The Saraswati Dashanamis  
belong to the **Bhuriwara** group, which is  
affiliated with the **Shringeri math** in the  
southern Indian town of **Shringeri**. The  
Saraswati division is elite in that it is one  
of the few that will initiate only **brahmins** (the other such divisions are  
**Ashrama**, **Tirtha**, and part of the  
**Bharati** order).
