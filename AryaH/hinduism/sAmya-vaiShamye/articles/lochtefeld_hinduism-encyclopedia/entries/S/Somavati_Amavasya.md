title = "Somavati Amavasya"

+++
Religious observance celebrated when a  
**new moon** (**amavasya**) falls on a  
**Monday**, which can thus occur in any  
month in the **year**. On the new moon  
day the **sun** and moon travel together  
during the daylight sky, and when this  
happens on the Monday, whose presiding **planet** is the moon, this confluence  
is deemed particularly favorable.  
Another auspicious connection arises  
because Mondayâ€™s presiding **deity**, the  
god **Shiva**, also has mythic connections  
with the moon. A Somavati Amavasya is  
thus judged a particularly beneficial  
time to **worship** Shiva, as well as to  
bathe (**snana**) in a sacred river such as  
the **Ganges**, or to perform any other religious act.
