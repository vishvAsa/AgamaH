+++
(“seat of the perfected”) Name denoting  
a site believed to have particular power  
in conferring spiritual attainments upon  
those who carry out religious practices  
there. This power is usually tied to a  
mythic charter in which a **deity** became  
resident at the site—and is thus still present to assist people—but such sites  
have often been further sanctified by the  
presence of charismatic ascetics whose  
lives and spiritual discipline serve as  
examples to others.
