title = "Siddhi"

+++
(“attainment”) The most common word  
used to denote a superhuman power  
or faculty. The siddhis are first referred  
to in **yoga’s** founding text, the **Yoga**  
**Sutras** of **Patanjali** (3.45), and are  
traditionally said to number eight:  
minuteness (**anima**), lightness (**laghima**), greatness (**madhima**), acquisition  
(**prapti**), irresistible will (**prakamyam**),  
control (**vashitvam**), superiority (**ishitvam**), and suppression of desire  
(**kamavasayitvam**).  
The **possession** of such siddhis is  
generally seen as the evidence of high  
spiritual attainment, but the attitude  
toward the powers is mixed. They give  
one great abilities, but they are also seen  
as being highly seductive, since they can  
be used for both good and evil. The ability to keep from being beguiled by them  
is the true sign of spiritual maturity, and  
a spiritually immature person could easily fall into using them for selfish purposes. For this reason, religious aspirants are discouraged from aiming to  
gain such powers, since the very act of  
seeking is considered a selfish desire. In  
contrast, when one has gained such  
powers as a by-product of spiritual  
attainment, one is believed to be able to  
keep them in proper perspective.
