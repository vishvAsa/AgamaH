In certain schools of **tantra** practice,  
particularly in the **Trika** school of  
Kashmiri Shaivism, the name for the  
first step in the **evolution** of the cosmos. According to the Trika school, the  
Ultimate Reality, conceived as **Shiva**, is  
utterly nondual, and thus neither masculine nor feminine. The first step in  
cosmological evolution comes when  
the divine consciousness becomes  
conscious of itself through the reflection (**vimarsha**) of its original illumination (**prakasha**). Moved by this selfconsciousness, the unqualified divine  
being transforms itself into a divine  
being containing a masculine and feminine nature, the first of many such bipolar  
dyads from which the universe is born.  
The masculine part of this first dyad is  
Sadashiva, which is considered the  
579  
Sadashiva  
material cause of the universe. The  
energy for creation comes from the  
creative and dynamic power of the  
dyadâ€™s female principle, **Shakti**. For further information see Jaideva Singh,
