title = "Shishupala"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, Shishupala is the son  
of the king of Cedi. He is also described  
as a reincarnation of **Jaya**—one of the  
gatekeepers of the god **Vishnu’s** heavenly  
dwelling, **Vaikuntha**—who has been  
cursed by the sages to be born three  
times as a **demon** and killed by the god  
Vishnu each time. Shishupala is born  
with three eyes and four hands, but as  
his horrified parents are about to abandon him, a celestial voice informs them  
that the child will grow up into a powerful king. The heavenly voice also says  
that Shishupala can be killed by only  
one person on **earth**, that Shishupala’s  
third eye will disappear when he sees  
that person, and that two of his hands  
will disappear when the person takes  
him in his lap. After some time the god  
**Krishna** pays a visit to Cedi, and when  
the signs take place as foretold,  
Shishupala’s parents know that Krishna  
is the only person who can kill their son.  
Shishupala’s mother is Krishna’s aunt,  
and when she begs him not to kill her  
son, Krishna promises to forgive  
Shishupala’s misdeeds one hundred  
times. Krishna sticks to his word, but  
such forbearance only makes Shishupala more reckless, and after the one  
hundred and first insult, Krishna  
throws his discus and cuts off  
Shishupala’s head.
