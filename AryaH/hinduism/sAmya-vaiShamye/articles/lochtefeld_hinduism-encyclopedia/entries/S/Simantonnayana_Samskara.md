title = "Simantonnayana Samskara"

+++
Traditionally, the third of the life-cycle  
ceremonies (**samskaras**), and the last of  
the **prenatal samskaras**. This was performed when the **pregnancy** was further  
advanced, although various writers gave  
differing times for this. The major element in this rite is the husband parting  
the **hair** of his wife, supposedly to protect her from the misfortune and black  
**magic** that are supposed to plague pregnant **women**. One can also interpret  
650  
Shyam  
parting the hair as symbolizing an easy  
delivery, and since this was a rite of protection, it would also give the expectant  
mother psychological assurance that  
everything would be all right. One bit of  
evidence supporting this interpretation  
is that many of the **dharma literature**  
writers classify this samskara as being  
for the woman rather than the unborn  
child, and as only needing to be performed during the first pregnancy. This  
samskara is seldom performed in  
modern times.
