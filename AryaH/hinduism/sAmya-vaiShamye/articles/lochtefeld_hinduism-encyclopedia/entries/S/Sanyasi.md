title = "Sanyasi"

+++
(“renunciant”) According to the **dharma**  
**literature**, the last of the idealized  
**stages of life** (ashrama) for a **twice-born**  
man, that is a man born into the **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya** communities. Boys born into these communities  
are eligible for the adolescent religious  
**initiation** known as the “second birth.”  
After engaging in religious learning as a  
celibate student (**brahmacharin**), marrying and raising a family as a householder (**grhastha**), and gradually detaching himself from the world as a forestdwelling recluse (**vanaprastha**), a twiceborn man should finally renounce all  
possessions and all attachments to  
devote himself exclusively to the search  
for ultimate truth. Although in a general  
sense the word *Sanyasi* can (and sometimes does) refer to any such renunciant, it is most used as the name of a  
particular **ascetic** community, the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, who are believed  
to have been founded by the great  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**, and who  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**.
