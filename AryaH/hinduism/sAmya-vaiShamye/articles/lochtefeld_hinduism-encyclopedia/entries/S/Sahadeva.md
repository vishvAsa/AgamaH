title = "Sahadeva"

+++
Fifth of the five **Pandava** brothers who  
are the protagonists in the great Hindu  
epic, the **Mahabharata**. Sahadeva’s  
mother is **Madri**, who is the junior wife  
of King **Pandu**. None of the Pandava  
brothers are actually Pandu’s sons,  
since he has been cursed to die the  
moment he holds his wife in an  
amorous embrace. Madri conceives her  
sons magically, using a **mantra** given to  
her co-wife, **Kunti**, by the sage  
**Durvasas**. The mantra gives the woman  
who recites it the power to call down  
any of the gods and to have by him a son  
equal in power to the god. With Pandu’s  
blessing Kunti teaches the mantra to  
Madri, who meditates on the **Ashvins**,  
the divine twins who are the physicians  
of the gods, and thus bears the twins  
**Nakula** and Sahadeva. As the sons of the  
physicians of the gods, both are skilled  
healers of animals and human beings.  
Although they are among the five  
Pandava brothers, they are less important to the *Mahabharata* than their  
three elder siblings.
