The philosopher **Shankaracharya**  
(788–820) is traditionally said to have  
established centers for the **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasi** ascetics, devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva**, at four places in India:  
**Badrinath**, **Puri**, **Shringeri**, and  
**Dwaraka**. The head monk at each  
of these centers has been given the  
title *Shankaracharya*, as a sign of the  
status of his office. The head of the  
**Kamakotipith**, an **ascetic** center in the  
southern Indian city of **Kanchipuram**,  
has also come to be described as a  
Shankaracharya, even though this site is  
not one of the original four; this reflects  
the Kamakotipith’s importance as an  
ascetic center and Kanchipuram’s general status as a religious center.  
Although by this reckoning there are  
five places, at present there are only  
four Shankaracharyas, since Swami  
Swaroopanand Saraswati holds the seat  
for both Badrinath and Dwaraka. The  
other Shankaracharyas are Swami  
Nishchalanand (Puri), Swami Bharati  
Tirtha (Shringeri), and Swami Jayendra  
Saraswati (Kanchipuram). Their traditional office gives the Shankaracharyas a great deal of religious status  
and prestige, and because of this they  
have become highly influential figures,  
even in an intensely decentralized religious tradition.
