title = "Shivaji"

+++
(1627–1680) **Maratha** chieftain who  
carved out an independent kingdom in  
western **Maharashtra** and **Goa**, and was  
able to hold onto it despite the efforts of  
the Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb** to take  
it back. Shivaji’s father Shahji was a  
Moghul governor in the city of Bijapur,  
and Shivaji began his operations as a  
robber chief there. He gained the support of the local Maratha people, and his  
first important conquest was a hill fort  
near the city of Pune. From there he  
expanded his territory and consolidated  
his power, building forts to hold the territory. Shivaji was a devout Hindu,  
which undoubtedly helped gain him  
support from the common people. In  
modern times his Hindu roots, and his  
opposition to Moghul rule, have  
transformed him into a Hindu nationalist hero, particularly in Maharashtra. See  
also **Moghul dynasty**.
