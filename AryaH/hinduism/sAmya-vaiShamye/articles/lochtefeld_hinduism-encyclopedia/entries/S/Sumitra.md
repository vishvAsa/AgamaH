title = "Sumitra"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Sumitra is one of the  
three wives of King **Dasharatha** and the  
mother of **Ramaâ€™s** half-brothers, the  
twins **Lakshmana** and **Shatrughna**. In  
their fidelity and service to Rama, her  
**sons** are important characters in the  
epic, but aside from bearing them,  
Sumitra has little importance.
