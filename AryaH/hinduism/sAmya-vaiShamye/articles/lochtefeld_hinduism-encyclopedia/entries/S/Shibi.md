In Hindu mythology, sage-king who is  
famous for his virtue and commitment to his word. Shibi’s reputation  
reaches the ears of the gods, who  
decide to test it. The god **Dharma**,  
who is righteousness personified (or  
in some other versions, the god **Agni**)  
takes the form of a dove, and is pursued by the god **Indra**, in the form of a  
hawk. The dove flies into Shibi’s lap  
and entreats him for asylum, which  
Shibi grants. The hawk observes that it  
is inappropriate for Shibi to deprive  
him of the food he needs to eat, and  
demands in exchange an equal weight  
of flesh cut from Shibi’s body. Shibi  
agrees, but no matter how much of his  
flesh he throws into the balance, the  
dove is still heavier. Finally Shibi sits  
his whole body into the balance, as a  
sign that he will sacrifice his life for  
the dove. At this point the gods  
resume their divine forms and bless  
Shibi for his steadfastness.
