title = "Swaminarayan Sect"

+++
Modern religious community devoted to  
the god **Vishnu**; its practice is based on  
the life and teachings of Sahajananda  
Swami (1781–1830), who was born near  
the sacred city of **Ayodhya** in eastern  
India but spent much of his life in the  
western Indian state of **Gujarat**.  
Sahajananda took **initiation** as an  
**ascetic** and soon became a **mahant**, or  
ascetic leader. His followers revered him  
first as a religious preceptor (**guru**), and  
later as a partial incarnation of the god  
**Krishna** himself. They believed that  
manifestations of the god Vishnu, such  
as Krishna, are born on earth in times of  
extreme trouble. It was in this latter  
aspect that he was given the name  
Swaminarayan (“Lord Narayan”), and  
his followers believed that he was the  
highest manifestation of God in human  
form. The Swaminarayan sect has several million lay devotees (**bhakta**), most  
of whom are affluent **Gujarati** merchants. In keeping with the community’s ascetic roots, however, its most  
important figures are the ascetics who  
run the organization and who serve as  
teachers and advisers to them. For further
