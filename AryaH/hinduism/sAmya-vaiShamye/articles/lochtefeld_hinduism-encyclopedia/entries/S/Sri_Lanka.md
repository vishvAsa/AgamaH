title = "Sri Lanka"

+++
Island nation off the southeastern coast  
of India, formerly known as Ceylon.  
Local tradition claims that Sri Lanka was  
the place at which the biblical Adam  
alighted from paradise. Yet despite the  
island’s idyllic natural beauty, its human  
geography has been far more troubled.  
Since 1981 the nation has been in the  
662  
Sopashraya  
throes of civil war between the Sinhalese  
and the Tamils, the island’s two major  
ethnic groups. The Sinhalese comprise  
about 70 percent of the population, are  
largely Buddhist, live mainly in southern, western, and central Sri Lanka, and  
consider themselves the island’s traditional inhabitants. The Tamils comprise  
little more than 20 percent of the population, are both Hindu and Christian,  
and are concentrated in the north and  
east. The Tamils came to Sri Lanka in  
two different ways—about half are  
descended from medieval invaders, who  
established Tamil kingdoms in northern  
Sri Lanka after crossing the straits from  
southern India, others were brought to  
Sri Lanka in the nineteenth and early  
twentieth centuries, to serve as laborers  
on tea plantations.  
Since independence in 1948, the  
Tamils have been at a distinct disadvantage *vis-à-vis* the Sinhalese, whose  
majority has allowed them to control  
virtually all aspects of national life. This  
precarious position was often further  
undermined by anti-Tamil riots, particularly in Colombo, the nation’s capital.  
In 1981 Tamil groups began a struggle  
for an independent nation in the Tamilmajority areas. The Sinhalese majority  
was deathly opposed to this notion, and  
since then Sri Lanka has been marked by  
periods of vicious civil war. Given their  
slimmer resources, the Tamils have  
tended to wage guerrilla warfare. Their  
soldiers are famous for wearing a  
cyanide capsule around their necks with  
which to commit **suicide** if captured.  
These soldiers are also notorious for  
their willingness to serve as human  
bombs, striking against civilian populations in urban areas. In 1991 one such  
human bomb was responsible for the  
assassination of former Indian Prime  
Minister Rajiv Gandhi in revenge for  
Gandhi’s perceived treachery in cooperating with the Sri Lankan government.  
Although the Tamil regions have been  
offered limited autonomy by Chandrika  
Kumaratunga, Sri Lanka’s present prime  
minister, the conflict has been so bitter  
that it is not likely to be easily resolved.  
Sri Lanka has traditionally been part  
of the Indian cultural orbit and has a  
long history of cultural exchanges with  
India. According to local tradition,  
Buddhism was brought to Sri Lanka  
from India in the third century B.C.E. by  
Mahinda, who was the son of the  
Mauryan emperor **Ashoka**. Another sign  
of this connection is that Sri Lanka contains an important Hindu pilgrimage  
place (**tirtha**), **Kataragama**, located  
near the island’s southern coast.  
Kataragama’s perceived power draws  
Hindus from abroad as well as Sri  
Lankans from all religious communities.  
Although Kataragama is Sri Lanka’s  
only major Hindu site, the northern  
regions strongly reflect the Tamil culture  
of the region’s population, which stems  
from their geographic roots. See also
