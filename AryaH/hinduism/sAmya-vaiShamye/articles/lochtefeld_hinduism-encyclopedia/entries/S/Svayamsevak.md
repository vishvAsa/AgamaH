(“volunteer”) Rank-and-file member of  
the **Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS).  
The RSS is a conservative Hindu organization the express purpose of which is  
to provide the leadership cadre for a  
revitalized Hindu India; for most of its  
history it has characterized its mission  
as cultural and character-building  
rather than religious or political. The  
svayamsevaks are the rank-and-file  
members of the local RSS branches  
(**shakhas**), and are thus “foot soldiers”  
who make up the organization’s core  
membership. The shakhas in any given  
area are overseen by a full-time RSS  
worker known as a **pracharak** (“director”), who serves as a liaison between  
the local units and the RSS leadership,  
and oversees RSS activity in his area.  
The svayamsevak is the lowest level  
of RSS membership. Most members do  
not advance beyond this rank, since to  
do so requires complete commitment to  
the RSS and its ideals; those who do,  
however, are usually gifted leaders. The  
679  
Svayamsevak  
primary stress at the shakha level is on  
forming personal relationships with  
other members, as a way to develop loyalty to the organization. Each shakha, or  
local unit, holds a daily meeting.  
Activities include an opening ceremony  
in which the organization’s saffron banner is raised; traditional games or exercises, including a martial drill; and a discussion period in which RSS ideals can  
be disseminated and propagated.
