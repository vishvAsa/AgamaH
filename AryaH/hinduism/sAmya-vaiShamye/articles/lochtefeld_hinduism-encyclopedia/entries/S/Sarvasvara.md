title = "Sarvasvara"

+++
Sacrificial rite found in the **Vedas**, the  
oldest and most authoritative Hindu  
religious texts. The most notable feature  
of the sarvasvara is that it involved the  
**suicide** of the sacrificer, who concluded  
the rite by entering the sacrificial fire.  
The sarvasvara is an extreme example  
of the class of ritual actions known as  
**kamya karma**, which consists of  
action performed solely because of the  
performerâ€™s desire (**kama**) to obtain certain benefits. This element of desire  
makes kamya karma different from the  
other two classes of ritual action, **nitya**  
**karma** and **naimittika karma**, which  
were each in some way obligatory. The  
sarvasvara could be undertaken to obtain  
any outcome, such as **birth** in **heaven** as  
a god, or rebirth in a royal family. The sacrificer declares the benefit in the part of  
the rite called the **samkalpa**. Although  
the sarvasvara had extreme elements, it  
was completely voluntary.
