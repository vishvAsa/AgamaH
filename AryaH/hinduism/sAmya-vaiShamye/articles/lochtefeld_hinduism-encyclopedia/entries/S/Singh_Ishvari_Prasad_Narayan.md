title = "Singh, Ishvari Prasad Narayan"

+++
(r. 1835–1889) A Maharaja of **Benares**  
who, with the help of local scholars,  
wrote the dialogues (**samvads**) for the  
characters in the **Ramnagar Ram Lila**.  
The Ram Lilas are dramatized versions  
of the epic **Ramayana**, which transcend  
simple theater to become a form of **worship**. The Ram Lila at Ramnagar, the  
fort that is home to the kings of  
Benares, is the most famous and traditional of all these Ram Lilas. The  
Ramnagar Ram Lila began because of  
the royal family’s patronage, and the  
annual performance is still sponsored  
by them. Although they are no longer  
the actual political rulers, the royal  
family continues to play an important  
ceremonial role. For further information see Anaradha Kapur, *Actors*,
