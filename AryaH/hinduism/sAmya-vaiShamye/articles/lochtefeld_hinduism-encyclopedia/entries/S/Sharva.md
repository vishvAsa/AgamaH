title = "Sharva"

+++
(from *shara*, “arrow”) Epithet of the god  
**Shiva**. In his earliest description in the  
**Shvetashvatara Upanishad**, the god  
**Rudra** (later identified with Shiva) is  
identified as a god whose primary  
weapons are infallible arrows. This characterization of Shiva as an archer has  
continued ever since; his bow **Pinaka** is  
one of few divine weapons famous  
enough to have a name. See **Shiva**.
