(“one’s own **dharma**”) In the **dharma literature**, svadharma is an individual’s  
unique religious duty (dharma), based  
on that person’s social position, **stage of**  
**life**, and gender. The governing assumption behind this notion is that every person has a social role to fulfill, and each of  
these roles is necessary for the maintenance of society, no matter how humble  
it might be. For each person, his or her  
svadharma carries the highest authority,  
and supersedes all other religious laws.  
As one example, violence is generally  
prohibited, but it is a necessary part of a  
ruler’s svadharma—both to protect the  
land from external invaders, and to punish criminals within the country. In both  
cases the use of violence helps to maintain social order, which is the king’s primary duty. In the same way, society  
depends on a host of other people fulfilling their particular social roles. This  
notion of social responsibility and interconnectedness is tied to religious fulfillment through the notion of the Path of  
Action (**karmamarga**). According to this  
676  
Suta  
idea, selflessly performing one’s social  
duty, for the good of the world rather  
than through selfish desire, was also a  
path to ultimate spiritual fulfillment and  
final liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
According to this conception, since  
every svadharma is potentially a path to  
final liberation, each person has a path  
that only he or she can tread.
