One of the countries with significant  
Hindu **diaspora populations**. This is  
particularly true in Natal province,  
where Hindus were first brought as  
indentured agricultural laborers, but  
there is a significant Hindu presence in  
other parts of the country as well. South  
Africa is best known as the place where  
**Mohandas K. Gandhi** first developed  
and refined his program of nonviolent  
resistance, or **satyagraha**, which he  
employed in the service of the Indian  
community there. In contemporary  
times the South African Hindu community, as with many Hindu diaspora communities, has loosened religious ties to  
India, and is in the process of forming a  
Hindu religious life in another geographical setting.
