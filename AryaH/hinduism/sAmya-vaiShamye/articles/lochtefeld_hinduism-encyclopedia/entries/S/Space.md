title = "Space"

+++
One of the five **elements** in traditional  
Indian **cosmology**, the others being  
**earth**, **fire**, **water**, and **wind**. **Akasha** or  
“space” is not conceived in the sense of  
“outer space,” but rather the space  
between or within visible objects on  
earth. For example, an “empty” pitcher  
was not actually empty, but was filled  
with space, until it was displaced by  
some fluid. This elemental sense of  
space was thus something closer to what  
might be considered the “atmosphere,”  
and was actually seen as having fluidlike  
properties. In some philosophical  
schools, each of the elements is paired  
with one of the five senses; here akasha  
is associated with hearing, since it  
is believed to convey the sound from  
place to place.
