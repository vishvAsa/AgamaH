title = "Shuka"

+++
(“parrot”) In Hindu mythology, a sage  
whose life story upholds the traditional  
doctrine of the four **stages of life** (ashramas). Shuka was the **son** of the sage  
**Vyasa**, born when Vyasa had a seminal  
emission upon seeing a celestial nymph  
(**apsara**) in the form of a parrot. From  
boyhood Shuka was interested only in  
spiritual life and had the firm desire  
never to marry, but despite intensive  
spiritual study he could not find contentment. He eventually decided to visit  
the sage-king **Janaka**, who advised  
Shuka that he could rightly consider  
renunciation only after having married  
and raised a family. Shuka returned  
home to his father and lived the householder’s life; later in life he took  
up renunciation again and became  
perfectly realized.
