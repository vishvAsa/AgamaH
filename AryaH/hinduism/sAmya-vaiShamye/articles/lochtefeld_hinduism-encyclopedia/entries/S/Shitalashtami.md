title = "Shitalashtami"

+++
Religious observance celebrated on the  
eighth day of the bright (waxing) half  
of the lunar month of **Baisakh**  
(Aprilâ€“May), in honor of the **goddess**  
**Shitala**. In northern India this festival  
632  
Shishupala  
falls at the advent of the hottest time  
of **year**; the climate thus mirrors the  
heat and fevers brought on by contact  
with Shitala herself, in her form as  
smallpox. Although Shitala is conceived  
as spiteful and jealous, she cannot be  
ignored, since this will be sure to  
provoke her wrath.
