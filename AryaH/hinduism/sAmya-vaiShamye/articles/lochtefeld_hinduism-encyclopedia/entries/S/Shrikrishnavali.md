(“Series [of poems] to **Krishna**”) Series  
of sixty-one short poems dedicated to  
the god Krishna, written in the **Braj**  
**Bhasha** form of **Hindi** by the poet-saint  
**Tulsidas** (1532–1623?). This collection is  
unusual, since Tulsidas is renowned as a  
devotee (**bhakta**) of the god **Rama**, and  
most of his literary work describes  
Rama’s exploits. The *Shrikrishnavali* is a  
poetic cycle about Krishna’s life, so it  
begins with poems devoted to Krishna’s  
childhood and youth in the **Braj** region.  
Most of the text, however, describes the  
sorrow of the cow herd girls (**gopis**) after  
Krishna’s departure for his kingdom in  
**Mathura**, and their scornful rejection of  
Krishna’s messenger **Uddhava**, who tries  
to convince them that since Krishna is  
the supreme **deity**, he is everywhere.  
This work is an example of the ecumenical, or universal, tendencies found  
throughout Tulsidas’s work. Not only  
did he compose poems in praise  
of another deity, thus transcending  
sectarian barriers, but he also transcended linguistic barriers by writing  
these poems in Braj Bhasha, the most  
widely read language of his time, rather  
than his own native **Avadhi**.
