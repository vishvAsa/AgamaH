title = "Shalagram"

+++
Black stone containing an **ammonite**,  
the spiral-shaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea creature. The shalagram is primarily found in the upper reaches of the  
**Gandaki** River in **Nepal**. The circular  
ammonite fossil is understood to be  
**Vishnu’s chakra**, and the shalagram is  
thus understood as a “self-manifest”  
(**svayambhu**) form of Vishnu. As with all  
such “self-manifest” forms, the shalagram is believed to be especially holy,  
since in it Vishnu has chosen to reveal  
himself to his devotees (**bhakta**) rather  
than coming to an image fashioned by  
human hands. Because of its holiness,  
the shalagram is often an object of **worship**. Its portability (and durability) made  
it the preferred form of Vishnu for wandering **Vaishnava** ascetics. One also finds  
cases in which small images are claimed  
to have been revealed when a shalagram  
was broken open; these images carry the  
glamour of a finished image as well as the  
**divine power** that accompanies spontaneous manifestation.
