In Hindu astrology (**jyotisha**), a **planet**  
generally associated with strength and  
vitality, although it can be malevolent,  
possibly reflecting the relentless  
destructive power of the Indian sun. The  
sun’s vitality makes it a strong planet,  
and as in Western astrology the sun’s  
position in the **zodiac** plays a major role  
in fixing a person’s **natal horoscope**  
669  
Sun  
(janampatrika). The sun presides over  
**Sunday**, a **day** of the **week** that is not  
strongly marked as either auspicious or  
inauspicious. See also **Surya**.
