(“abode of peace”) Town in the Birbhum  
district of **West Bengal**, about ninety  
miles northeast of Calcutta. It is most  
famous for Vishva-Bharati University,  
founded in 1921 by the Indian poet and  
Nobel laureate **Rabindranath Tagore**  
(1861–1941). As an educational institution, the university was dedicated to  
providing an education that would satisfy  
people’s material and spiritual needs  
and thus develop an integrated human  
being. It did this in part by promoting  
the arts and by stressing the interconnection between nature and human  
beings, both themes that were close to  
Tagore’s heart.
