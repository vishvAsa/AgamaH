title = "Sambandar"

+++
(7th c.) One of the earliest of the  
**Nayanars**, a group of sixty-three southern Indian poet-saints who were devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**. Along  
with their contemporaries the **Alvars**,  
who were devotees of **Vishnu**, the  
Nayanars spearheaded the revitalization  
of Hindu religion through their passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god,  
conveyed in hymns sung in the **Tamil**  
**language**. Along with his contemporary  
586  
Samavaya  
The four Vedas in Sanskrit. The Sama Veda is the second of the four Vedas.  
**Appar**, Sambandar actively opposed the  
unorthodox sects of the times, particularly the Jains, whom he reviles in his  
poems. The depth of his hatred can be  
seen in a well-established tradition  
that, after converting the king of  
**Madurai**, of the **Pandya dynasty**, from  
Jainism to Shaivism, Sambandar was  
instrumental in having eight thousand  
Jain ascetics executed by **impalement**.  
The collected hymns of the three most  
important Nayanars—Appar, Sambandar,  
and **Sundaramurtti**—comprise the  
**Devaram**, the most sacred of the Tamil  
Shaivite texts. See also **Shaiva**.
