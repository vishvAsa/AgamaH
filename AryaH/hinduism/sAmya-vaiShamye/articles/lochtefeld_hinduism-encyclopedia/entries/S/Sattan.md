title = "Sattan"

+++
(7th c.) Tamil poet who was the author  
of the **Manimegalai**, a text that  
was clearly written as a sequel to the  
earlier poem “The Jeweled Anklet”  
(**Shilappadigaram**). Sattan’s story  
focuses on a young woman named  
Manimegalai, who was wooed by the  
local prince but eventually became a  
Buddhist nun. Although the story’s bias  
clearly favors the Buddhists, the  
Manimegalai has numerous debates  
with people from competing religious  
traditions, thus giving a rounded if  
somewhat subjective picture of contemporary religious life. See also **Tamil epics**  
and **Tamil language**.
