title = "Seed Syllable"

+++
A syllable, or set of syllables, that are  
believed to have an intimate connection  
with a **deity**—either as a way of gaining  
access to the deity’s power or as the subtlest form of the deity itself. They are  
seed syllables in that they contain the  
deity in its briefest form, just as a seed  
contains the potential for a plant. These  
seed syllables are called **bijaksharas**.  
See **bijakshara**.
