+++
(“Foe-slayer”) In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great Indian epics,  
Shatrughna is the second son of King  
**Dasharatha** and his wife **Sumitra**, and the  
youngest brother of **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist. Whereas Rama’s brothers **Lakshmana** and **Bharata** play important roles in  
the epic—the former as Rama’s minion  
and shadow, the latter serving as Rama’s  
regent during his exile—Shatrughna is virtually invisible and does not play an  
important part in the larger epic narrative.
