title = "Sushruta Samhita"

+++
Along with the slightly earlier **Charaka**  
**Samhita**, one of the two major sources  
for the Indian medical tradition known  
as **ayurveda**. Underlying ayurveda is the  
theory of the three bodily humors—**vata**  
(**wind**), **pitta** (bile), and **kapha** (phlegm).  
Each is composed of different elements,  
and although everyone has all three  
humors, their varying proportions are  
used to explain differing body types,  
metabolic dispositions, and personalities. The cause of disease is an imbalance of these humors—whether  
caused by environmental sources or  
personal habits—whereas the state of  
this equilibrium is the state of health.  
The *Sushruta Samhita* has been edited  
and translated into various languages,  
and served as a source for secondary  
studies, such as Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, *Science and Society in Ancient*  
*India*, 1977.
