(“pure monism”) Philosophical school  
first propounded by **Vallabhacharya**  
(1479–1531). Vallabha called his school  
shuddadvaita, or “pure monism,” to distinguish it from the **Advaita Vedanta**  
school founded by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. The latter school propounds “nondual” (advaita) monism, in  
its claim that a single Ultimate Reality  
lies behind all things, and that all things  
are merely differing forms of that reality.  
The Advaitins call this single reality  
**Brahman**, which they conceive as formless, impersonal, and having no defining  
attributes except for being, consciousness, and bliss (**sacchidananda**). In the  
Advaita understanding, since all  
conceptions of particular **deities** have  
645  
Shuddadvaita  
specific attributes, they are thus conditioned forms of the ultimate Brahman.  
In fact, any assumption that the world  
as it appears is real is a fundamental  
misunderstanding that ultimately  
causes human beings to be trapped  
in karmic bondage, reincarnation  
(**samsara**), and suffering.  
Shankaracharya’s philosophical position was based primarily on the **Vedas**,  
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu  
texts, and particularly on the  
**Upanishads**, the speculative texts that  
are the latest part of the Vedas.  
Vallabhacharya used both of these  
sources in framing his Shuddadvaita  
school, but also used the **Bhagavata**  
**Purana**, which he considered to be of  
equal authority. The *Bhagavata Purana*  
is one of the later sectarian collections  
known as **puranas**. It is the most important source for the **worship** of the god  
**Krishna**, whom Vallabha considered to  
be the ultimate manifestation of the  
Supreme Being, rather than the unqualified Brahman promoted by  
Shankaracharya. Aside from promoting  
a personal conception of the deity over  
an impersonal conception, another difference in the two schools concerned  
the status of the world. For  
Vallabhacharya, the world as perceived  
is not an illusion but is real, because it  
and human beings have both evolved  
from God through the exercise of his  
supreme power. Krishna is conceived  
in the traditional threefold divine aspect  
as being–consciousness–bliss. Living  
beings possess being and consciousness, but not the divine bliss, whereas  
the material, nonliving, world has  
only being. Since this conception  
gives real value to the everyday  
world, Vallabhacharya described it as  
“pure monism.”  
In Vallabhacharya’s system God is the  
inner controller of all souls, which  
makes human beings dependent on  
God for thinking and perception  
(**pratyaksha**). This dependence on God  
highlights the importance of **grace**,  
which he refers to as pushti, meaning  
“that which nourishes the soul.”  
Because of this emphasis on grace,  
Vallabhacharya’s religious community is  
also known as the **Pushti Marg**. The  
Pushti Marg believes that God’s favor is  
gained through devotion (**bhakti**),  
which is open to all and for which there  
are no prerequisites. The emphasis  
on devotion has marginalized all  
other forms of religious practice, and  
the Pushti Marg is particularly known  
for rejecting all **ascetic** endeavors,  
such as **celibacy**, fasting (**upavasa**), or  
renunciation. Its members tend to be  
householders coming from merchant  
families, particularly from the state of  
**Gujarat**. The community’s primary  
temple is at **Nathdwara** in the state of  
**Rajasthan**. For further information see
