(“discrimination of the unreal as the  
real”) **Theory of error** propounded by  
the **Samkhya** philosophical school. All  
theories of error attempt to explain why  
people make errors in judgment, the  
stock example being of mistaking the  
silvery flash of a sea shell for a piece of  
silver. The Samkhya theory of error is  
based on dualistic metaphysics, in  
which the fundamental error comes in  
confusing **purusha** and **prakrti**—  
roughly, spirit and nature—which are  
the sources of all things. These are the  
two Samkhya first principles—purusha  
as conscious witness, and prakrti as  
insentient matter—which are always  
separate from each other, and whose  
attributes can never coincide. For the  
Samkhyas, the fundamental error is to  
confuse these two completely different  
principles—that is, to attribute powers  
of motion and development to purusha,  
and consciousness to prakrti. Purusha is  
conceived as conscious, but completely  
inactive and unchanging. It is the passive witness to the myriad transformations of prakrti going on around it.  
This initial misidentification causes  
the **evolution** of the entire world, both  
the interior, subjective world and the  
exterior world the subject perceives.  
Against this background, confusing the  
shell for silver is just an extension of this  
original mistake and is rooted in it.  
According to the Samkhyas, perfect  
knowledge would protect one from all  
sorts of errors, both cosmic and mundane. For further information see Karl
