title = "Shraddhanand, Swami"

+++
(b. Lala Munshi Ram, d. 1926) Key figure  
in the development of the **Arya Samaj**, a  
modern Hindu reformist movement.  
Shraddanand was born in **Punjab** and  
got a law degree from the Government  
College in Lahore, but was most influential through his support for the Arya  
Samaj’s educational institutions. His  
greatest work was establishing the  
Gurukul Kangri near the sacred city of  
**Haridwar** in 1901. The Gurukul  
(“teacher’s household”) was a boarding  
school where Arya Samaj children could  
be raised with “progressive” Arya values,  
far from the corrupting influences of traditional mainstream Hindu society. This  
model was based on the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu religious texts, which the  
Arya Samaj took as the sole religious  
authority, and in which a student would  
live as a member of his teacher’s family.  
Educationally, the curriculum stressed  
the arts and sciences necessary for a  
“modern” education, but also traditional  
**Sanskrit** learning, particularly of the  
Vedas. Shraddhanand became a **Sanyasi**  
in 1917 but continued to support political causes, particularly Indian social and  
political leader **Mohandas Gandhi’s**  
1919 call for non-cooperation with the  
British government. His fervor and  
strength of character made him an  
unpopular figure, and he was assassinated by a Muslim in 1926.
