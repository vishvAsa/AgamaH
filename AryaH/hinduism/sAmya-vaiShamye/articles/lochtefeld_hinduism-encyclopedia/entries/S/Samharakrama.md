(“destruction method”) Ritual in the  
**Shrividya** school of the secretive religious practice known as **tantra**. This ritual uses the **shrichakra**, a symbolic diagram used in **worship**. The adept’s ritual  
journey starts at the outer edges of the  
shrichakra, which represents the apparently “real” everyday world, and gradually moves toward the center, where a  
single point (**bindu**) represents absolute  
unity. This process is called “destruction” because the ritual process systematically deconstructs the notion of the  
dualistic world and destroys the notion  
of a Self that is separate from the  
Absolute Reality. For further information see Douglas Renfrew Brooks, *The*  
*Secret of the Three Cities*, 1990.
