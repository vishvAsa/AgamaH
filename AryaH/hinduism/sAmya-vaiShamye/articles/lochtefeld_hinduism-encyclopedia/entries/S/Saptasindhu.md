(“seven seas”) In traditional mythic  
geography, the seven oceans surrounding the seven concentric landmasses  
(**dvipas**) that make up the visible world.  
Each of these seven seas is composed of  
a different substance. The ocean accessible to human beings is composed of  
salt water, but the oceans beyond that  
are composed of sugarcane juice, wine,  
ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, milk, and  
sweet water. Few specific details exist  
about most of these oceans, but the  
Ocean of Milk has a prominent place in  
Hindu mythology, since it was by churning this that the gods obtained the nectar of immortality (**amrta**). See also  
**Tortoise avatar**.
