title = "Shrirangapatnam"

+++
Demolished fortress city just outside the  
city of Mysore in the state of **Karnataka**.  
Shrirangapatnam formerly served as the  
capital of Tipu Sultan (r. 1782–1799), the  
last ruler of Mysore. Throughout his  
reign he fought against the encroachment of outside powers. However, in  
1799 he unsuccessfully took up arms  
against the British and was killed in battle, leaving the city largely destroyed.  
The city got its name from a temple  
there to the god **Ranganatha**, a form of  
**Vishnu** in which he is sleeping on his  
serpent couch **Shesha** in the sea of cosmic dissolution (**pralaya**). The temple  
survived the demolition and is still functioning today. Ranganatha is considered  
a divine king, and his most famous  
image, on the island of **Shrirangam** in  
**Tamil Nadu**, has strong associations  
with southern Indian kings and kingship. Even though Tipu was a Muslim,  
invoking Ranganatha’s powerful symbolism would have been an astute political move, to legitimate his rule in the  
eyes of his Hindu subjects.
