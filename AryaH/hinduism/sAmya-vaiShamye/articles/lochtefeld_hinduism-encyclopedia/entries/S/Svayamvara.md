title = "Svayamvara"

+++
(“self-choice”) In Hindu mythology, a  
form of marriage in which the bride  
would choose the groom she wanted,  
indicating her choice by placing her garland around his neck. In the stories in  
which a svayamvara occurs, the brideto-be is usually of royal lineage, as are  
her suitors, so the bride’s choice was an  
exercise fraught with potential political  
consequences. One famous mythic  
svayamvara was that of **Nala** and  
**Damayanti**, in which Damayanti prefers  
Nala even to the gods who have come as  
suitors. This story also illustrates the  
dangers of such a choice, when an  
unhappy suitor cursed the couple to  
endure separation and privation.
