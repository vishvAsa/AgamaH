Temple tower that was the central feature of the **Nagara** architectural style,  
prevalent in northern and eastern India.  
The temple’s tallest tower was always  
directly over the image of the temple’s  
primary **deity**, although there were  
often also smaller, subsidiary towers to  
lead the eye up to that primary one.  
Within this general pattern there are two  
important variations, exemplified by the  
temples at **Khajuraho** and **Orissa**. In the  
Khajuraho style a group of shikharas is  
unified into one continuous upward  
swell, which draws the eye upward like a  
series of hills leading to a distant peak.  
In contrast, the Orissan style tends to  
emphasize the differences between the  
temple’s parts, with a low entrance hall  
(**jagamohan**) next to a beehive-shaped  
temple tower (**deul**), which is often  
three or four times taller than the  
entrance hall.
