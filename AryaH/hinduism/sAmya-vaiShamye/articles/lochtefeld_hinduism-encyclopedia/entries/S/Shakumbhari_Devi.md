Presiding **deity** of the Shakumbhari Devi  
temple in the district of Saharanpur in  
**Uttar Pradesh**, and one of the nine  
**Shiwalik goddesses**. This site is one of  
the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of sites  
sacred to the **Goddess** that spreads  
throughout the subcontinent. Each  
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body  
part of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to **earth**, taking form there as a different goddess; in the case of Shakumbhari Devi, the body part is said to have  
been Sati’s head. The temple is in a thinly settled region, and the major time of  
**year** that pilgrims come to visit is during  
the **Navaratri** festivals.  
Although **Hindi** literature identifies  
Shakumbhari Devi as a form of **Durga**,  
the site’s charter myth shows the nurturing capacities of the Goddess as  
well as the warrior aspect more commonly associated with Durga.  
According to the story, a **demon**  
named Durgam gains the boon that he  
cannot be conquered by any of the  
gods. After subduing all the gods,  
Durgam prevents the storm-god **Indra**  
from sending rain to the earth for one  
hundred years. Seeing the earth’s distress, the gods approach the Goddess  
and beg for her help. The Goddess,  
620  
Shakra  
filled with pity, takes a form with one  
hundred eyes, because of which one of  
her epithets is Shatakshi (“hundred  
eyes”). From each eye comes a stream  
of tears, and when these fall to the  
earth, plants begin to grow again.  
Further, when her tears do not reach  
some places, she puts forth vegetables  
(Shak) from her own body to nourish  
the creatures of the earth. Her final  
action is to kill the demon Durgam,  
reasserting the Goddess as a strong  
and protective figure. Although there  
is little information on Shakumbhari  
Devi in English, there are further references to her in David R. Kinsley, *Hindu*  
*Goddesses*, 1986. See also **pitha**.
