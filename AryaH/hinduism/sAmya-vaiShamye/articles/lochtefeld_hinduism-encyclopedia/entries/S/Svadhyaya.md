(“study”) Study of the sacred texts,  
which connotes oral recitation, since  
these texts were traditionally studied by  
reciting them. This is one of the methods named in the **Yoga Sutras** as one of  
the preparatory elements to yoga, since  
the text claims that such study attenuates one’s karmic hindrances and fosters  
the ability to enter trance. Even in modern times the act of reciting a religious  
text is seen to have multiple spiritual  
benefits and, if performed over a long  
period of time, to be able to transform  
the person reciting.
