title = "Samudra Gupta"

+++
(r. 335–376) The second monarch in the  
**Gupta dynasty**, **son** of **Chandra Gupta I**.  
During his reign Samudra Gupta made  
significant territorial gains from the  
Gupta dynasty’s home base in eastern  
**Uttar Pradesh** and **Bihar** westward to  
the **Ganges** basin and eastward into  
Bengal and **Assam**. **Orissa** and much of  
the **Coromandel** Coast gave tribute as  
independent but vassal states. Samudra  
Gupta left a personal account of his  
prowess inscribed on a stone column at  
**Allahabad**. This column had originally  
been carved to display one of the **Pillar**  
**Edicts** of the Maurya emperor **Ashoka**  
(r. 269–232 B.C.E.), and in claiming it as  
his own Samudra Gupta was attempting  
to appropriate some of the **Maurya**  
**dynasty’s** luster.
