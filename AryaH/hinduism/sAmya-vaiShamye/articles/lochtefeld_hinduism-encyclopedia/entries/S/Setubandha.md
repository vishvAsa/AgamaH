(“Building the Bridge”) Early medieval  
poem whose theme is taken from the  
epic **Ramayana** and describes **Rama’s**  
invasion of **Lanka** by building a bridge  
across the ocean straits. The poem is  
written in **Prakrit**, an umbrella term for  
the grammatically simpler vernacular  
languages that developed from **Sanskrit**  
through natural linguistic change. The  
poem has been falsely ascribed to  
**Kalidasa**, the greatest Sanskrit poet. The  
true author is unknown.
