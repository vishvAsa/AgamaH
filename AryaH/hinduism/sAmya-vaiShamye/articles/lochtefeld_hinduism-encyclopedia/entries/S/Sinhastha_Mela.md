title = "Sinhastha Mela"

+++
Name for the **Kumbha Mela** festival held  
in the holy city of **Ujjain**. The festival is  
called Sinhastha because it is celebrated  
when **Jupiter** is in Leo (Sinha). The  
Sinhastha Mela’s climactic bathing  
(**snana**) day comes on the **full moon** in  
the **lunar month** of **Baisakh** (April–  
May). The Kumbha Mela is a massive  
religious festival celebrated at threeyear intervals in four different cities:  
**Haridwar**, **Allahabad**, **Ujjain**, and  
**Nasik**; the festival thus comes to each  
city every twelve years. The Kumbha  
Mela is chiefly a festival at which participants bathe in sacred rivers. The festival’s primary participants are ascetics,  
who come from all over South Asia to  
bathe in the sacred waters. According to  
651  
Sinhastha Mela  
tradition, the Kumbha Mela was organized by the great philosopher **Shankaracharya** to promote regular gatherings of learned and holy men, as a  
means to strengthen, sustain, and spread  
Hindu religion.  
The charter myth for the Kumbha  
Mela is taken from the story of Churning  
the Ocean of Milk. After the ocean has  
been churned and the nectar of immortality (**amrta**) has been extracted, the  
gods and their **demon** opponents begin  
to quarrel over the pot of nectar. The  
gods snatch the pot and run off with it,  
but the one carrying the pot grows tired,  
and in twelve days of carrying it sets it  
on the ground in twelve different places.  
Eight of the places are in heaven, but the  
other four are on earth and these are the  
four sites where the Mela is held. In each  
place a bit of the nectar splashes on the  
ground, sanctifying the site, and since a  
652  
Sinhastha Mela  
Depiction of Sita and her husband Rama. In the epic the *Ramayana*,  
Sita is abducted by the demon king Ravana and Rama must search the earth for her.  
divine day is considered to be a  
human year, the twelve-year cycle is  
established. According to popular  
belief, at each Kumbha Mela’s most  
providential moment, the waters in  
which people are bathing become the  
nectar of immortality, and all those  
who bathe in these waters gain  
immeasurable religious merit.  
Historically speaking, the two most  
important sites have been Haridwar and  
Allahabad; one measure of their dominance is that they have held “half”  
(**ardha**) Kumbha Melas after six years,  
and that these have consistently drawn  
bigger crowds than the “full” Kumbha  
Melas at Ujjain and Nasik, which fall  
during those times. In recent times,  
however, political considerations have  
increased the attendance at the  
Sinhastha Mela. Ujjain is located in central India, in the heartland of the Hindu  
nationalist groups such as the **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh**, **Vishva Hindu**  
**Parishad**, and **Bharatiya Janata Party**.  
The city of Ujjain is also close to the  
ancestral kingdom of Vijaya Raje  
Scindia, the matriarch of a former royal  
family and a prominent figure in the  
Bharatiya Janata Party. In such a political climate and local environment, the  
Sinhastha Mela has been seen as a good  
opportunity for religious-political theater, in order to generate publicity, deliver  
patronage, and give the people in these  
organizations greater status and visibility.
