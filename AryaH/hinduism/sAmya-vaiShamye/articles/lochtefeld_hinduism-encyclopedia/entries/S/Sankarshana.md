(“dragging away”) Epithet of the god  
**Krishna’s** brother **Balarama**, referring  
to Balarama’s unusual prenatal development—he is conceived by Krishna’s  
mother **Devaki** but is magically transferred into the womb of her co-wife  
**Rohini**. This is done to protect him  
from harm, since Devaki’s wicked  
uncle **Kamsa** has already killed her  
first seven children, and will certainly  
do the same if she carries Balarama to  
term. See **Balarama**.
