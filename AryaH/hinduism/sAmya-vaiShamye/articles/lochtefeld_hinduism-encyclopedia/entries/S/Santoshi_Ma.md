(“the mother who satisfies”) **Goddess**  
who is one of the most fascinating  
Hindu **deities**, and whose recent explosive popularity illustrates both the flexibility of the Hindu pantheon, and the  
way that Hindu religion reflects and  
responds to changes in Indian society.  
Santoshi Ma’s popularity was largely  
inspired by a film released in 1975, *Jai*  
*Santoshi Ma* (“Victory to Santoshi Ma”).  
The film first details the birth of Santoshi  
Ma as the daughter of the god **Ganesh**,  
but then cuts to the earthly problems  
suffered by one of her devotees (**bhakta**),  
**Satyavati**. Satyavati is a new bride having problems adjusting to her marital  
home, particularly because of tensions  
with her wicked sisters-in-law. By the  
end of the film, through Satyavati’s  
steadfast devotion to Santoshi Ma, all of  
her problems are resolved.  
This film did not invent Santoshi Ma,  
although it was largely responsible for  
spreading her **worship**. The prescriptions for Santoshi Ma’s religious vow  
(**vrat**) had existed before the film was  
made, and both the rite’s charter myth  
and the film focus on the problems of a  
new bride and their eventual resolution  
through her steadfast devotion to  
Santoshi Ma. Santoshi Ma’s ultimate  
source is a mystery, but her iconography  
suggests that she is an amalgam of other  
female deities. She is seated on the lotus,  
a feature associated with the goddess  
**Lakshmi**; she wields the sword associated  
with the goddesses **Kali** and **Durga**, as  
well as the trident associated with the  
god **Shiva**. She shows the attributes  
associated with both married and  
unmarried goddesses: Like the married  
goddesses, she is nurturing and caring  
to her devotees, playing the role of the  
benevolent Indian mother, and like the  
independent unmarried goddesses, she  
is powerful and and potentially dangerous—one of the film’s climactic scenes  
shows her utterly destroying a temple  
after Satyavati’s sister-in-law intentionally ruined the sanctified food (**prasad**)  
meant for her devotees. Yet she is also  
believed to have the power to grant her  
devotees’ requests, no matter how large.  
Through her nurturing, benevolent  
character coupled with power, she  
crosses the usual boundaries associated  
with Hindu goddesses.  
Part of the popularity of Santoshi  
Ma’s vrat comes from its simplicity,  
cheapness, and promise of benefits. The  
observance is usually kept by **women**  
with the aim of attaining concrete goals  
for themselves and their families: getting a job, passing an exam, conceiving a  
child, or arranging a marriage. The rite  
involves weekly fasting (**upavasa**) and  
worship. One of the social factors cited  
in Santoshi Ma’s explosive popularity is  
the steadily growing uncertainty in  
Indian (and South Asian) life, which  
makes very ordinary things difficult  
to attain and necessitates the use of  
all possible resources. In this context,  
an inexpensive rite that promises

concrete benefits for assiduous devotion  
is an attractive option. See also **Santoshi**
