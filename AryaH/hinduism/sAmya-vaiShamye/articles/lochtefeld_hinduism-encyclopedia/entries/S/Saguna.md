(“with qualities”) Anything having distinguishing qualities. In the context of  
ideas about divinity it refers to particular **deities** with particular attributes. In  
the religious traditions based on the  
ideas of the **Upanishads**, the speculative  
texts that are the final texts in the **Vedas**,  
any manifestation of a deity with qualities is seen as ultimately inferior to the  
unqualified (**nirguna**) **Brahman**. This  
assumption is adamantly opposed by  
certain theistic traditions, such as the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious community,  
which insists that the highest deity, in  
this case **Krishna**, has a particular form  
(and thus certain qualities).
