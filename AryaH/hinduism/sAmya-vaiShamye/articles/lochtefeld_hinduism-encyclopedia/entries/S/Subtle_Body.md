title = "Subtle Body"

+++
Alternate human physiological system  
that exists on a different plane than  
gross matter, but has certain correspondences with the anatomy of the material  
body. Different parts of the subtle body  
contain the microcosmic forms of the  
**deities Shiva** and **Shakti**, the bipolar  
forces believed to be the powers behind  
the cosmos. The subtle body is thus  
based on the principle of the homology,  
or essential similarities, of macrocosm  
and microcosm, a fundamental Hindu  
idea since the time of the **Upanishads**.  
The **Sanskrit** texts describing the subtle  
body assume that there are different  
planes of reality, and thus that the subtle  
body actually exists, but given the network of symbols associated with it, one  
665  
Subtle Body  
need not accept its literal reality for it to  
be religiously meaningful.  
The subtle body is visualized as a set  
of six psychic centers (**chakras**), running  
roughly along the course of the spine:  
the **muladhara chakra** at the base of the  
spine, the **svadhishthana chakra** in the  
genital region, the **manipura chakra** in  
the navel region, the **anahata chakra** in  
the heart region, the **vishuddha chakra**  
in the throat region, and the **ajna chakra**  
is in the forehead between the eyebrows.  
Associated with each of these chakras is  
an elaborate symbolic system: All six can  
be seen as symbols for a human physiological capacity; the first five are associated with one of the subtle elements  
(**tanmatras**), and the sixth with thought.

Subtle Body  
Vishnu, surrounded by worshipers, wielding Sudarshana, his discus weapon.  
The lotus petals on each chakra contain  
a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus  
encompassing all sacred sounds. Some  
models of the subtle body are even  
more developed, with each chakra  
associated with a certain color and a  
certain presiding deity.  
These centers are capped at the top  
of the head by the “thousand-petaled  
lotus” (**sahasradalapadma**), which is  
the abode of Shiva in the human body.  
Connecting all of the centers are three  
vertical channels (**nadi**)—the **ida nadi**  
on the left, the **pingala nadi** on the  
right, and the **sushumna** in the center.  
Coiled three times around the muladhara chakra is the **kundalini**, the latent  
spiritual force in all human beings.  
This is considered an aspect of the universal Shakti, or feminine **divine**  
**power**, but in most people is regarded  
as dormant, symbolized by its coiled  
state. The separation of Shakti and  
Shiva at the opposite ends of the subtle  
body also symbolizes the ordinary person’s unenlightened state, since enlightenment transcends this duality, and the  
two deities are united and identical.  
The subtle body is a fundamental  
aspect of **tantra** practices and some  
forms of **yoga**. In the types of yoga that  
focus on the subtle body, including  
**kundalini yoga**, the ultimate aim is to  
awaken and straighten the kundalini,  
moving it up the sushumna through  
the chakras to the abode of Shiva.  
Since the kundalini is nothing but raw  
energy, the process must be carefully  
controlled to prevent the aspirant from  
unleashing uncontrollable forces, and  
manuals warn against doing this without being under the supervision of a  
spiritual teacher (**guru**). The union of  
Shiva and Shakti in the aspirant’s body  
mirrors the action of these divine  
forces in the macrocosm, and with this  
union the aspirant gains bliss and final  
liberation of the soul (**moksha**). For further information see Arthur Avalon (Sir
