title = "Svadhishthana Chakra"

+++
In many schools of **yoga**, and in the esoteric ritual tradition known as **tantra**,  
the svadhishthana chakra is one of the  
six psychic centers (**chakras**) believed to  
exist in the **subtle body**. The subtle body  
is an alternate physiological system,  
believed to exist on a different plane  
than gross matter but with certain correspondences to the material body. It is  
visualized as a set of six psychic centers,  
which are conceived as multipetaled  
lotus flowers running roughly along the  
course of the spine, connected by three  
vertical channels. Each of these chakras  
has important symbolic associations—  
with differing human capacities, with  
different subtle elements (**tanmatras**),  
and with different seed syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed from the letters of the  
**Sanskrit** alphabet, thus encompassing  
all sacred sound. Above and below these  
centers are the bodily abodes of **Shiva**  
(awareness) and **Shakti** (power), the two  
divine principles through which the  
entire universe has come into being. The  
underlying assumption behind this  
concept of the subtle body is thus  
the fundamental similarity and interconnectedness of macrocosm and  
microcosm, an essential Hindu idea  
since the time of the mystical texts  
known as the **Upanishads**.  
The six chakras are traditionally listed from the bottom up, and the svadhishthana chakra is the second. It is  
visualized as a six-petaled lotus located  
in the region of the genitals. The petals  
each contain a seed syllable formed  
from a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, in  
this case the consonants from “ba”  
to “la.” On a symbolic level, the  
svadhishthana chakra is associated with  
the human capacity for reproduction. It  
is also identified as the bodily seat for  
the subtle element of **water**, the fluid  
medium through which reproduction is  
possible. For further information see
