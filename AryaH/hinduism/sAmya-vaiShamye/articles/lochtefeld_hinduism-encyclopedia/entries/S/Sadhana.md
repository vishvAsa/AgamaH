(“accomplishing”) The most common  
colloquial Hindu term designating  
established and regular religious practice. It is given this name because it  
is through such practice that one  
gains spiritual attainments. In modern  
**Hindi**, the word can also be used to  
refer to anything to which one has  
devoted a great deal of time, attention,  
and hard work.
