title = "Shanta (“peaceful”) Bhava"

The first of the five **modes of devotion** to  
God that were most prominently articulated by **Rupa Goswami**, a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna** and a follower of the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**.  
Rupa used five different models of  
human relationships to explain the variety of links followers might have with  
the **deities**. These five models showed  
growing emotional intensity, from the  
peaceful (shanta) sense that comes from  
realizing one’s complete identity with  
**Brahman**, or Supreme Reality, to conceiving of god as one’s master, friend,  
child, or lover. The shanta bhava, in  
which one finds mental peace through  
the realization of complete identity with  
Brahman, is the only one of these modes  
in which the devotee does not have a  
personalized relationship with God.  
Given Rupa’s assumption that Krishna  
was the highest manifestation of godhead, and that true religious life  
involved having a relationship with him,  
the shanta bhava was thus judged inferior to the other four modes.
