title = "Sudarshana"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the name for the  
god **Vishnu’s** discus weapon (**chakra**),  
which is fashioned by **Vishvakarma**, the  
workman and architect of the gods.  
According to the story, Vishvakarma has  
married his daughter **Sanjna** to the **sun**,  
but she finds her husband’s brightness  
too much to bear. To help his daughter  
adjust, Vishvakarma trims off some bits  
667  
Sudarshana  
of the sun with his divine tools, removing enough of his radiance that Sanjna  
can bear to be with him. He then fashions the trimmed-off portions into  
Vishnu’s Sudarshana chakra, **Shiva’s** trident, and various other divine weapons,  
as well as the **Pushpak Viman**, an **aerial**  
**car**. Sudarshana’s divine source makes it  
a fearful weapon, and it is thus able to  
decimate any enemy.
