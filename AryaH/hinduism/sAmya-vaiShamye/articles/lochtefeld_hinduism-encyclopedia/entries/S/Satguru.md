title = "Satguru"

+++
(“true **guru**”) In the **sant** religious tradition, an epithet (label) that can refer  
either to the Supreme Being or to a genuinely realized religious teacher,  
through whose instruction a disciple  
attains the Supreme Being. The sants  
were a loose group of central and northern Indian poet-saints who lived  
between the fifteenth and seventeenth  
centuries and who shared several general  
tendencies: stress on individualized  
and interior religion, leading to a personal experience of the divine; disdain  
for external ritual, particularly image  
**worship**; faith in the power of the divine  
Name; and a tendency to ignore conventional **caste** distinctions. Many of  
the sants, particularly in northern India,  
thought of the divine as without qualities (**nirguna**) and beyond human powers of conception. Given these aniconic  
and occasionally iconoclastic tendencies, it is not surprising that the sant tradition highlights the importance of the  
spiritual teacher (guru), since the guru’s  
human form is the only image that a disciple has to work with. In human form,  
the satguru guides the disciple’s spiritual  
practice and thus becomes the vehicle  
for spiritual attainment. Yet a true guru,  
according to the tradition, always  
remains a servant rather than a master,  
maintaining and transmitting the teaching of his or her particular lineage. The  
sant notion of the satguru has been  
adopted into many modern Hindu  
movements, most notably the **Radha**  
**Soami Satsang**.
