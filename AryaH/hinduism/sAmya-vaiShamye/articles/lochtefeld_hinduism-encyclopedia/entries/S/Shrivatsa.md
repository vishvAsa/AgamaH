+++
An auspicious mark on the god **Vishnu’s**  
chest, also found on Vishnu’s form as  
**Krishna**, which is sometimes described  
as a mole and sometimes as a curl of  
**hair**. In statues and pictures, the  
Shrivatsa is usually portrayed as a fourpetaled flower, and it is believed to be  
the **kaustubha** jewel, which was one of  
the precious things churned from the  
Ocean of Milk along with the **goddess**  
**Lakshmi**, the wishing-**cow** Surabhi, and  
**amrta**, the nectar of immortality. See  
also **Tortoise avatar**.
