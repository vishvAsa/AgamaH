(“**Brahman**-as-sound”) This term  
refers to the notion that the Supreme  
Reality (Brahman) exists in its most  
subtle form, not as matter, but as  
sound. This idea is particularly prevalent in **tantra**, a secret, ritually based  
system of religious practice, and helps  
to explain the tantric stress on  
**mantra**, or sacred sound, as the essential means through which one gains  
access to this reality. In this understanding, the primary mantra (**mulamantra**) of one’s particular **deity**  
would be the clearest articulation of  
shabdabrahman, with other mantras  
conceived as derivative forms of  
that primary mantra; these latter  
mantras were the source for everyday  
speech and the mundane sounds of  
ordinary experience.
