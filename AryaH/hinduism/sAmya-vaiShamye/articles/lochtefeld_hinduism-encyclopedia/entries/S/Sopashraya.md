(“using a support”) One of the sitting  
postures (**asana**) described in commentaries to the **Yoga Sutras** of **Patanjali**,  
the foundational text for the practice of  
**yoga**. The name of this posture derives  
from a wooden support used by the  
sitter to keep erect, often portrayed as  
a crutch-shaped prop under the chin.
