title = "Shaiva"

+++
Devotee (**bhakta**) of the Hindu  
god **Shiva**, who along with **Vishnu** is  
one of the major figures in the  
Hindu pantheon. From the evidence at  
hand, it seems that the earliest  
sectarian Shaivites were the  
**Kapalikas**, **Kalamukhas**, and  
617  
Shaiva  
618  
Shaiva Nagas  
**Pashupatas**. All three of these were  
communities of renunciant **ascetics**,  
perhaps to accord with the example  
set by their patron deity. The information for all three must be reconstructed, since the sects have all disappeared. Shaivas can still be found in  
ascetic life in the **Dashanami Sanyasis**  
and the **Nathpanthis**, two living  
ascetic communities. The major current through which Shaiva devotionalism (**bhakti**) came into mainstream  
society was through the devotional  
hymns of the **Nayanars**, a group of  
sixty-three poet-saints who lived in  
southern India in the seventh and  
eighth centuries. Their passionate  
devotion, conveyed in hymns in the  
**Tamil language**, was later systematized into the southern Indian philosophical school known as **Shaiva**  
**Siddhanta**. As the bhakti movement  
moved northward, it found Shaiva  
expression in the **Lingayat** community  
in modern **Karnataka**, as well as the  
Krama and **Trika** schools of Kashmiri  
Shaivism. Shaivism has had a long  
association with **tantra**, a secret, ritually based religious practice, and the  
influence of tantra is evident in the  
Kashmiri schools as well as in the doctrines of the Nathpanthi ascetics.  
Shaivism does not show the bewildering sectarian variety characterizing  
**Vaishnavas**, devotees of the god  
**Vishnu**, and Shaivites tend to be less  
strict about membership in a particular  
sect. Nevertheless, Shiva has millions  
of devotees in modern India, and a wellestablished network of pilgrimage  
places (**tirtha**), particularly in the  
**Himalayas**.
