title = "Sulfur"

+++
A pivotal substance in Indian **alchemy**,  
the conceptual foundation for which is  
its analysis of the world as a series of  
bipolar opposites in tension with one  
another, and the conviction that unifying these opposing forces brings spiritual progress and the end of reincarnation  
(**samsara**). Hindu alchemy shares this  
model of uniting or transcending  
opposing forces with Hindu **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based system of religious  
practice, and with **hatha yoga**, which is  
668  
Sudarshana Sampraday  
based on a series of physical exercises  
that are also believed to affect the  
**subtle body**.  
In the alchemical tradition, the governing metaphor for this combination of  
opposites is the union of **sun** and **moon**.  
Both are connected to other opposing  
principles through an elaborate series of  
associations, in keeping with this bipolar symbolism. In Hindu alchemical  
conceptions, sulfur is conceived of as  
the uterine **blood** of **Shakti**, and thus a  
powerful element. It is also identified  
with the sun, with heat, dryness, and  
withering force. When sulfur is mixed  
and consumed with elemental **mercury**,  
which is identified with the god **Shiva’s**  
**semen**, the aspirant’s gross body is purified and refined, eventually rendering it  
immortal. Modern descriptions of this  
practice invariably warn that it should  
only be carried out under the direction  
of one’s **guru** (spiritual teacher), since  
otherwise the combination will be  
harmful. This warning is not surprising,  
since by itself mercury is a deadly poison.
