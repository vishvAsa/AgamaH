(1887–1963) Hindu **ascetic**, teacher, and  
founder of the **Divine Life Society**.  
Shivananda’s first calling was to be a  
doctor; after getting his degree, he spent  
some time practicing medicine in  
Malaysia, spurred by a passion to serve  
others. Later in life he felt the call of  
renunciation and, in 1924, settled in  
**Rishikesh**, where he was based for the  
rest of his life. Shivananda’s message  
stressed the teachings of the **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** school, which is devoted to a  
belief in monism (the belief in a single  
Ultimate Reality where all things are  
united), and the practice of **yoga** for a  
disciplined life. He saw his own mission  
as teaching others, a mission fostered by  
the Divine Life Society’s publications,

Shivaji  
Ascetics observing Shivaratri.  
which continue to be important today.  
Shivananda’s learning and religious  
charisma made him greatly respected,  
and in keeping with his original vocation, one of the charitable works sponsored by the Divine Life Society is a free  
medical clinic. For further information
