title = "Savitri Puja"

+++
Religious observance on the **new moon** in  
the **lunar month** of **Jyeshth** (Mayâ€“June),  
celebrating the virtue of **Savitri**, who rescued her husband **Satyavan** from the  
clutches of **Yama**, the god of Death. This  
observance is usually kept only by  
**women**, to promote the health and  
longevity of their husbands, and thus  
ensure them a long married life. As a  
woman whose entire energies were  
directed toward the well-being of her  
family, Savitri is a cultural model for  
Indian women; her ability to save her husband from death demonstrates her virtue  
and cleverness as well. Women observing  
this rite **worship** Savitri, Satyavan, and  
Yama; keep a strict fast (**upavasa**) before  
the worship; and after worship eat only  
fruit for the rest of the day.
