title = "Sankalpa"

+++
Spoken ritual performed before a religious act. The person about to perform  
the act identifies himself by name, tells  
the location of the act, and gives the  
lunar **calendar** date and time. He goes  
on to describe the religious act and what  
benefits he wants to receive as a result.  
Sankalpa is done before rituals such as  
**suicide** and doing morning **puja** to the  
**Ganges**. See **samkalpa**.
