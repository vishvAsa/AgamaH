title = "Surdas"

(early 16th c.) One of the **ashtachap**, a  
group of eight northern Indian **bhakti**  
(devotional) poets. The compositions of  
these eight poets were used for liturgical  
purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community whose members are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. In the  
Pushti Marg’s sectarian literature, all  
eight poets are also named as members  
of the community and as associates  
of either the community’s founder,  
**Vallabhacharya**, or his successor  
**Vitthalnath**. In this literature, as  
recounted in the **Chaurasi Vaishnavan**  
**ki Varta** (“Lives of eighty-four  
Vaishnavas”), it was at Vallabhacharya’s  
order that **Surdas** began to compose  
poems about **Krishna’s lila**, his playful  
interactions with the world and  
his devotees. He then proceeded to  
compose the 5,000-odd poems of  
the **Sursagar**.  
The oldest manuscripts paint a much  
different picture of Surdas, for most of  
them contain only a few hundred  
poems, which are usually quite short.  
The most important themes in the early  
poetry are supplication (**vinaya**) and  
separation (**viraha**), and although one  
also finds the depictions of Krishna’s  
childhood for which Surdas has become  
most famous, these themes are more  
important later in the poetic tradition.  
Surdas’s poetry thus shows a wide range  
of themes, from his own spiritual life to  
devotional “glimpses” of Krishna; the  
latter most commonly explore the religious tension between the image of  
Krishna as a charming child and his alter  
ego as lord of the universe. As in much of  
**Vaishnava** devotional poetry, Surdas  
composed these poems to invite his  
hearers to enter Krishna’s world.  
The difference between these  
pictures raises doubts about the  
connection between Surdas and  
Vallabhacharya. Although songs by  
Surdas have been worked into the rites  
of the **Pushti Marg**, Surdas composed  
no poetry in praise of Vallabhacharya,  
unlike the other ashtachap poets. It  
seems just as likely that, as the popularity of Surdas’s poems grew, he was  
“claimed” by the Pushti Marg as a fellow  
Krishna devotee. In fact, there is very little definitely known about him, including whether or not he was actually blind,  
as is generally accepted. Only two of the  
oldest poems mention blindness; one of  
these is clearly metaphorical, and the  
other is part of a litany of the woes of old  
age. As with so many of the bhakti  
poets, one knows a great deal more  
about the poems than the poet. For
