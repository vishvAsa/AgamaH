(early 5th c.) Playwright and author of  
the **Mrcchakatika** (“The Little Clay  
Cart”). This drama describes the love  
between a poor but noble **brahmin**,  
Charudatta, and a wealthy but virtuous  
courtesan, Vasantasena, set in the context of a complicated political intrigue. It  
is notable for its detailed portrayal of  
everyday urban life, exemplified by the  
little clay cart, which is a child’s toy. It  
has been translated into several languages, and is periodically performed  
for modern American audiences.
