As with all bodily fluids, semen is considered to make a person ritually impure  
through emission or contact, although it is  
obviously necessary for procreation,  
which is an auspicious event. Semen is  
also considered the concentrated essence  
of a man’s vital energy, distilled drop by  
drop from his **blood**; in Hindu mythology  
the semen from the gods is portrayed as  
having wondrous generative powers, as in  
the story of the god **Skanda**, who spontaneously developed when the god **Shiva’s**  
semen fell on the ground. Although a married man is obliged to have intercourse  
with his wife at certain times during her  
menstrual cycle, this is also seen as a  
potentially dangerous depletion of his  
vital energy. Since in Indian culture  
women are seen as having stronger sex  
drives than men, men are faced with the  
constant demand on their resources,  
which must be carefully husbanded to  
maintain their vitality. This problem of  
depletion is particularly pronounced in  
the unusual case when a man is younger  
than his wife, for in that case her needs are  
believed to be far greater than his capacity. Because all seminal emission depletes  
one’s vital forces, there are strict taboos on  
masturbation, which is seen not only as an  
abject surrender to one’s baser instincts,  
but as posing actual physical danger.
