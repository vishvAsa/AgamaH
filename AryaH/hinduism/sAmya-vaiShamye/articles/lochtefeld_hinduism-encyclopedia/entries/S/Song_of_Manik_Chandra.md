title = "Song of Manik Chandra"

+++
Traditional **Bengali** song describing the  
adventures of the mythical king Manik  
Chandra, his wife Mayana, and their **son**  
**Gopi** Chand; the latter figures are the  
primary characters, since Manik  
Chandra dies early in the story. The text  
is a romance but also contains many of  
the doctrines associated with the  
**Nathpanthi** ascetics. In particular,  
Queen Mayana has power over **Yama**  
(death personified), which was one of  
the primary aims of the Nathpanthi  
ascetics. Furthermore, she acquired this  
power through the spiritual instruction  
given by her **guru Gorakhnath**, the  
Nathpanthi founder.  
Her power over death is shown in  
various ways. When her husband dies,  
Mayana descends to Yama’s realm and  
physically abuses both Yama and his  
minions. In his flight Yama changes into  
various forms to escape Mayana’s wrath,  
but she is never deceived and continues  
to harass him. On other occasions, she  
shows her power over death by her  
inability to be killed. She mounts her  
husband’s funeral pyre, and although  
the **fire** burns for seven days and nine  
nights, not even her clothing is  
scorched. Many years later, Mayana survives seven fearsome ordeals, such  
as boiling in oil. When asked how  
she acquired these magical arts, she  
replies that Gorakhnath himself taught  
her. The appearance of such ideas in  
an essentially popular tale shows how  
deeply these ideas had sunk into the  
popular mind.
