title = "Sphota"

(“disclosure”) Crucial element in the  
theory of language propounded by  
**Bhartrhari** (7th c.). Bhartrhari was the  
founder of the **Grammarians**, a philosophical school that conceived of  
**Brahman**, the Supreme Reality, as being  
manifested in sound, particularly the  
sound of the spoken word. According to  
this theory, a verbal utterance had three  
elements: the sound or sounds produced by the speaker and heard by the  
listener; a phonological pattern, of  
which that utterance is an instance; and  
finally the sphota, which was expressed  
by the sounds and signified the object of  
that utterance. According to Bhartrhari,  
sphota had to be postulated to explain  
how words could carry meaning. They  
do so because they are connected to the  
sphota, which designated a particular  
object, and in producing the sounds the  
speaker expressed that sphota.
