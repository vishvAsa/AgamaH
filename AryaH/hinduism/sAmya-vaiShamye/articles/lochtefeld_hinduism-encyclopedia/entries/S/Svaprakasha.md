(“self-revealing”) In Indian **philosophy**,  
the notion that certain things such as  
knowledge are self-revealing and do not  
need anything else in order to be known.  
The issue about whether these things  
existed, and what they were if they did,  
was a source of lively disagreement  
among Indian thinkers.
