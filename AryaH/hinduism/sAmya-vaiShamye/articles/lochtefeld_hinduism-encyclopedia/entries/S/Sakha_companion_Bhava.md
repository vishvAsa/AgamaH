title = "Sakha (“companion”) Bhava"

+++
The third of the five **modes of devotion**  
to the Supreme Being that were most  
prominently expressed by **Rupa Goswami**.  
Rupa used different types of human  
relationships as models for the possible relationships between **deity** and  
devotee (**bhakta**). These five models  
increased in emotional intensity from  
the peaceful (**shanta**) sense that comes  
from realizing one’s complete identity  
with **Brahman**, or Supreme Reality, to  
conceiving of God as one’s master,  
friend, child, or lover. In the sakha  
bhava, devotees consider themselves  
as God’s friends and companions and  
thus as taking part in his regular, everyday activities.
