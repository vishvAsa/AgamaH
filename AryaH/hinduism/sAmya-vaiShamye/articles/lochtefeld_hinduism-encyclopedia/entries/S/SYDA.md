(**Siddha Yoga** Dham America) Religious  
organization founded by Swami  
**Muktananda** (1908–1982), which has  
ashrams and centers around the world.  
Siddha Yoga’s metaphysics are a modified form of Kashmiri Shaivism, but its  
signature teaching is the notion that the  
**guru’s grace** can immediately awaken  
the disciple’s latent **kundalini** (spiritual  
power, the most vital substance of the  
**subtle body**) and speed the process of  
spiritual development. This teaching  
puts an even greater emphasis on the  
importance of the guru as spiritual  
teacher, and the overwhelming emphasis pervades the whole movement.  
Although it has Indian members, most  
of its followers are non-Indian converts,  
who may be engaged in a spiritual  
search but who have little interest in  
becoming culturally Indian. The organization was headed by Muktananda until  
his death in 1982; for most of the time  
since then it has been presided over by  
his successor, **Chidvilasananda**.
