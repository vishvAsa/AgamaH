Traditionally considered the second of  
the four **Vedas**, the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu religious texts. The  
Sama Veda is a collection of hymns,  
arranged for singing as one of the components of the Vedic sacrifices (**yajna**).  
While drawn mostly from the **Rg Veda**,  
the singing patterns are far more elaborate than the simple chanting generally  
associated with the Rg Veda. Thus it is  
believed that the Sama Veda developed  
later than the Rg Veda.
