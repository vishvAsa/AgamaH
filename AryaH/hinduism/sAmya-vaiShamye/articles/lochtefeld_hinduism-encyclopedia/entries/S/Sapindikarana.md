+++
Funerary rite (**antyeshthi samskara**)  
performed on the twelfth day after  
death, which symbolically represents  
the one-year anniversary of the death.  
In this rite, the departed person is transformed from a potentially dangerous  
wandering spirit (**pret**) to a benevolent  
**ancestral spirit** (pitr). Each day for ten  
days following a person’s death, mourners leave a ball of cooked grain (**pinda**)  
for the departed spirit. Gradually the ten  
pindas “construct” a new body for the  
departed person. Then sapindikarana is  
performed on the twelfth day. A large  
pinda, representing the departed, and  
three smaller ones are collected, representing the departed’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. The rite’s

central moment comes when the  
departed’s pinda is divided into three  
parts, one part is mixed with each of the  
other three pindas, and finally all three  
pindas are combined into one. At the  
moment the three pindas are combined,  
the departed is believed to have become  
one (sapindi) with his ancestors, and to  
have been transformed from a wandering spirit into an ancestor as well. This  
twelfth day rite is the last of the funerary  
rites performed on a strict timetable.  
Mourners may wait for years before performing the final rite of **asthi-visarjana**,  
in which bone and ashes from the dead  
person’s **cremation** pyre are immersed

A groom and bride circle the sacred fire during the marriage ceremony,  
a rite often combined with the saptapadi, or the seven steps.  
in a sacred river, although with the  
advent of better transportation this is  
sometimes now performed before the  
twelfth day rites. In addition, people  
still perform annual memorial rites for  
the deceased. For an excellent account  
of this rite, see David M. Knipe,
