title = "Shankaracharya"

(788–820?) Writer and religious thinker  
who is unquestionably the most significant figure in the **Advaita Vedanta**  
philosophical school, and arguably the  
single greatest Hindu religious figure.  
Very little is known about his life—  
even his dates are a matter of speculation—but popular tales abound.  
According to one story, he was the god  
**Shiva** incarnate, who descended to  
earth to reveal the knowledge of the  
absolute. This connection is shown by  
his name—**Shankara** is one of the epithets of Shiva, and **acharya** (“teacher”)  
is an honorific suffix. He is traditionally believed to have been born in a  
**Nambudiri brahmin** family at Kaladi  
in the state of **Kerala**, to have become  
an **ascetic** at a very young age, and to  
have traveled widely engaging in religious disputes, particularly with the  
Buddhists, whose religious influence  
he put in permanent decline. He is  
believed to have established the ten  
**Dashanami Sanyasi** orders and the  
four **maths** that are their centers, to  
have written commentaries on the  
three texts central to the Vedanta  
school—namely the **Upanishads**, the  
**Vedanta Sutras**, and the **Bhagavad**  
**Gita**—and to have gone finally to the  
high **Himalayas**, where he died at the  
age of 32.  
Many of these claims cannot be substantiated, but the significance of his  
work cannot be denied. His commentary on the *Vedanta Sutra*s, the  
**Brahmasutra Bhashya**, gives the classic  
formulation of Advaita Vedanta, with its  
emphasis that the Ultimate Reality is the  
unqualified (**nirguna**) **Brahman**, which  
is eternal and unchanging, and to which  
the human soul is identical. The changing phenomenal world (the world we  
see and sense) is an illusion, created  
through the superimposition (**adhyasa**)  
of mistaken ideas upon the unqualified  
Brahman. Since Shankaracharya believes  
that one is released from bondage by  
replacing this mistaken understanding  
with the correct one, insight and not  
action is the means to liberation. This  
moment of understanding can be  
described as a flash of realization, but it  
seems mistaken to characterize Shankaracharya as a mystic. This is because  
he strongly emphasizes the authority  
of the sacred texts as a source of accurate knowledge about the ultimate  
truth. Although this stress on insight  
devalues the ultimate worth of ritual  
action, except in a preparatory role  
by removing defilements, Shankaracharya also believed that required ritual  
actions should be performed from a  
sense of duty.  
Shankaracharya is as philosophically  
significant for his silence as for his  
speech. He gives no definitive answer  
on many philosophical issues: about  
whether selves are one or many, about  
whether the locus of ignorance (**avidya**)  
was Brahman or the individual, about  
the nature of ignorance itself, and about  
the real nature of the material world. His  
refusal to take a position on these issues  
left many different routes open to those  
who came after him. Shankaracharya  
himself tended to emphasize epistemological issues—how human beings  
come to know things, and particularly  
how to correct the mistaken ideas  
through which human beings are held  
in bondage. The image that comes  
through his writing is of a deeply religious man whose primary concern was  
623  
Shankaracharya  
to help his hearers destroy their illusions  
and gain final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). Given this underlying goal  
and his acute philosophical mind, one  
can argue that he was aware of such  
metaphysical questions but chose to  
ignore them, since they were unrelated  
to his primary goal. For further information on Shankaracharya’s thought, see
