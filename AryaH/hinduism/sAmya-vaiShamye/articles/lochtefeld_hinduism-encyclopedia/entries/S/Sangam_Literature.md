title = "Sangam Literature"

+++
Collection of classical literature from the  
Tamil culture, composed during the  
early centuries of the common era;  
Sangam (also spelled Cankam) means  
“academy.” The most famous texts in  
Sangam literature are eight collections  
of short poems. Three of these collections fall into the genre called puram  
(“the outer part”); the other five are in  
the genre called akam (“the inner part”).  
Puram poetry was “public” verse,  
describing the deeds of kings, war,  
death, and other heroic actions. Akam  
poetry was about an individual’s inner  
experience, especially cultured love, of  
which the Sangam poets distinguished  
five developed moods: union, patient  
waiting, unfaithfulness, separation, and  
hardship. Each of these moods had welldeveloped symbolic associations,  
including associations with a specific  
type of landscape, time of **day** and **year**,  
flora, fauna, and types of people; such  
richly developed symbolism gives these  
poems incredible symbolic depth. The  
akam poems are arguably the literary  
antecedents to devotional (**bhakti**)  
poetry, which first developed in **Tamil**  
**Nadu**. For further information see A.K.
