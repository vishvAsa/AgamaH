title = "Samhita"

+++
(“collection”) The most archaic textual  
layer in the **Vedas**, comprising hymns to  
the Vedic **deities**, benedictions, prayers,  
spells, and litanies. The term indicates  
that this group of texts is a collection of  
various things important, not only for  
their cognitive meaning, but for their  
power as **mantra** (sacred sound). The  
samhitas were chanted during rites of  
**sacrifice** and remain the oldest living  
part of the Hindu tradition. Following  
the samhitas are the three later textual  
levels: the **Brahmanas**, which are  
essentially manuals detailing correct  
performance of the sacrifice, and the  
**Aranyakas** and the **Upanishads**, which  
ask speculative questions about the  
power behind the sacrifice.
