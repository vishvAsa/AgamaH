(“waves of beauty”) Poetic text dedicated to the praise of the **Goddess** as the  
supreme power in the universe. The text  
is traditionally ascribed to the philosopher **Shankaracharya**, who is also  
believed to have written other hymns in  
praise of Hindu gods and goddesses,  
despite being the greatest exponent of  
the philosophical school known as  
**Advaita Vedanta**, in which the Supreme  
Reality, called **Brahman**, is believed to  
be completely devoid of specific attributes. If Shankaracharya did in fact  
author these poetic texts, one possible  
explanation is that Shankaracharya was  
an intensely religious man and  
expressed this devotion in various ways.  
The text has been an enormously influential, particularly in those schools of  
**tantra** (a secret, ritually based religious  
practice) in which the Goddess is considered the single Ultimate Reality.
