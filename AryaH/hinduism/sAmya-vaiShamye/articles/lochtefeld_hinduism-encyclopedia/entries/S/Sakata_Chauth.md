title = "Sakata Chauth"

+++
Festival falling on the fourth **day**  
(chauth) of the dark (waning) half  
of the **lunar month** of **Magh** (January–  
February), which is celebrated as the  
birthday of the god **Ganesh**. Those who  
observe this festival are believed to gain  
Ganesh’s blessings—wisdom, freedom  
from troubles, and prosperity. The  
fourth day of every lunar fortnight is  
sacred to Ganesh, and vows marking  
this day may be performed by his devotees (**bhakta**). The biggest Ganesh festival of the **year** is not his birthday, but  
**Ganesh Chaturthi**, which falls on the  
fourth day of the bright (waxing) half of  
the lunar month of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September).
