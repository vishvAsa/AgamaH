title = "Smarana"

+++
(“remembering”) One of the standard  
religious practices mentioned in lists  
of religiously meritorious actions.  
Smarana is most often associated with  
**deities** but is also mentioned in conjunction with sacred sites (**tirthas**), one’s  
spiritual teacher (**guru**), or even particular acts of **worship**. This practice  
involves thinking constantly upon the  
deity, person, place, or object, and in the  
case of a deity this often involves mental  
recitation of the deity’s name. The primary emphasis in this practice is to create habitual behavioral patterns that,  
over the long term, will have beneficial  
effects on one’s character.
