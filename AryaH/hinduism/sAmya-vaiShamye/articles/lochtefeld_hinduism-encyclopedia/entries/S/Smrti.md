(“[that which is] remembered”) An  
important class of Hindu religious literature that, despite its sacrality, is  
deemed less authoritative than the  
other major category, **shruti**. According  
to tradition, the shruti (“heard”) texts  
were not composed by human beings  
but are based in the primordial vibrations of the cosmos itself. The ancient  
sages, whose faculties of perception had  
656  
Smallpox  
been sharpened through rigorous religious practice, were able to “hear” and  
understand these vibrations, and transmitted them to others in a lineage of  
learning. The smrti texts, in contrast, are  
attributed to human authors, who are  
putting forth matters that are “remembered” and thus carry with them the  
possibility of error. The smrti literature  
is wider and much more varied than the  
shruti, which is restricted to the texts in  
the **Vedas**; smrti literature includes the  
**dharma literature**, the sectarian compilations known as **puranas**, the two great  
epics (**Mahabharata** and **Ramayana**),  
the **Bhagavad Gita**, and the **tantras**,  
which are manuals detailing the secret,  
ritually based religious practice of tantra  
followers. Although theoretically the  
smrtis have less religious authority than  
the shrutis, in practical terms they are  
often far more important, in part  
because their contents are much better  
known. This is particularly true for sectarian Hinduism, in which a group’s sectarian literature will often be given the  
highest religious authority.
