The divine sister of the god **Jagannath**,  
who is invariably pictured with him and  
their brother **Balabhadra**. The most  
important site for these three **deities** is  
the Jagannath temple in the city of **Puri**,  
at which Jagannath is the presiding  
deity. Although Jagannath is identified  
with the god **Krishna**, he is generally  
considered an autochthonous (“of the  
land”) deity who was originally the local  
deity of Puri. He has been assimilated  
into the Hindu pantheon by his identification with Krishna.  
One piece of evidence for this theory  
is the deities’ invariable appearance,  
with Jagannath (Krishna) on the right,  
his brother Balabhadra (**Balarama**) on  
the left, and Subhadra as a smaller figure  
in the center. Such a triadic grouping  
is virtually unknown in Krishna devotion, which tends to stress either  
Krishna alone or the divine couple  
of Krishna and **Radha**. The female figure  
of Subhadra is also very unusual, since  
as Jagannath’s sister she is ineligible  
for the amorous adventures usually  
associated with Krishna. Although  
Jagannath is the most important of  
the three deities, the identifications with  
the other two also reveal larger  
syncretizing tendencies. Balabhadra is  
sometimes identified as a form of  
the god **Shiva**, and Subhadra as the  
powerful **goddess Durga**. In this way,  
Puri’s divine trio embody the three  
most important Hindu deities. For  
further information on Subhadra and  
her brothers, the best source is
