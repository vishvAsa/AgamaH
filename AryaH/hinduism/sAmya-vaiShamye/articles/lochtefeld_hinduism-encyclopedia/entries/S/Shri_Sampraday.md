title = "Shri Sampraday"

+++
One of the four branches (**sampraday**)  
of the **Bairagi Naga** ascetics. The Bairagi  
Nagas are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**, organized in military fashion  
into different **anis** or “armies.” Until the  
beginning of the nineteenth century  
their primary occupation was as mercenary soldiers, although they also had  
substantial trading interests; both of  
these have largely disappeared in contemporary times. The Shri Sampraday  
643  
Shri Sampraday  
traces its spiritual lineage through the  
poet-saint **Ramananda** to the southern  
Indian philosopher **Ramanuja**, who is  
claimed to have been Ramananda’s **guru**.  
This claim can also be seen in the name  
of the sampraday, since Ramanuja’s followers, the **Shrivaishnavas**, focus their  
**worship** on Vishnu and Shri (**Lakshmi**).  
Yet the **Ramanandi** ascetics worship an  
entirely different pair of **deities**—**Rama**  
and **Sita**—and the claim of any connections between the Ramanandis and the  
Shrivaishnavas was formally renounced  
at the **Ujjain Kumbha Mela** in 1921, at  
the insistence of the Shrivaishnavas. As  
with another Bairagi order, the **Brahma**  
**Sampraday**, the claim to be connected  
to a famous religious figure seems to be  
a way to gain the authority and prestige  
of an ancient and established tradition.  
Even without this claim, the Shri  
Sampraday is the largest and the most  
important of the Bairagi Naga orders.
