(“Ocean of Sur”) Corpus of poetry in the  
**Braj Bhasha** language ascribed to the  
northern Indian poet-saint **Surdas**.  
Traditional versions of the *Sursagar* are  
divided into twelve parts, to mirror the  
structure of the **Bhagavata Purana**,  
which is the most important **Sanskrit**  
source for the mythology of the god  
**Krishna**. Surdas was a Krishna devotee  
(**bhakta**), and this arrangement is a way  
to confer the luster of an authoritative  
Sanskrit text on vernacular religious  
poetry. Just as the *Bhagavata Purana*  
lavishly describes Krishna’s youthful  
exploits, the *Sursagar* is most commonly  
associated with poems painting  
intimate and affectionate pictures  
of Krishna’s childhood.  
Although the poetry published in  
editions of the *Sursagar* is ascribed to  
Surdas, most of it is certainly pseudonymous. The oldest manuscripts of  
Surdas’s poetry have at most a few hundred poems, and the size of this corpus  
roughly doubles every century, reaching  
the five thousand poems in the present  
Sursagar. The general tone of the earliest  
poems also shows a marked thematic  
difference. Although they include  
Krishna’s childhood, a far greater percentage express the poet’s pangs of separation (**viraha**) from Krishna or complaint (**vinaya**) about his spiritual troubles. Even the earliest manuscripts show  
no common body of poems, and it  
seems likely that from the very beginning the “Surdas” poetic tradition was  
drawn from the songs of wandering  
singers, a characterization that fits well  
with the image of the poet himself. For
