title = "Shruti"

+++
(“[that which is] heard”) The most  
authoritative type of Hindu sacred literature, made up of all the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious texts. The Vedas are  
generally considered to have four types  
of texts: the hymns to the gods known as  
**samhitas**, the ritual manuals called the  
**Brahmanas**, and the speculative texts  
known as the **Aranyakas** and the  
**Upanishads**. The term comes from the  
traditional Hindu belief that these texts  
were not composed by human beings  
but are based in the primordial vibrations of the cosmos itself. The ancient  
sages, whose faculties of perception had  
been sharpened through persistent religious practice, were able to “hear” and  
understand these vibrations, and transmitted them to others in a lineage of  
learning. Thus, the belief that their origin is nonhuman makes the shruti the  
highest religious authority.
