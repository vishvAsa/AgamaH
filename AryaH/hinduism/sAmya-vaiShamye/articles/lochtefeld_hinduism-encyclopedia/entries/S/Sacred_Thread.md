title = "Sacred Thread"

+++
A circular cord made of three strands (in  
which each strand itself has three  
strands), which is worn over the left  
shoulder, crossing the body to fall on the  
right hip. The sacred thread is given to a  
boy as part of the **upanayana samskara**,  
which is the adolescent religious **initiation** also known as the “second birth.”  
Second birth entitles a boy to study the  
**Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious texts.  
In the **dharma literature** this initiatory  
rite is prescribed for all young men  
belonging to the three “**twice-born**”  
social groups (**varnas**)—that is, the  
**brahmins**, **kshatriyas**, and **vaishyas**.  
The sacred thread would have been the  
most visible sign of a twice-born man,  
for whom wearing the thread was  
mandatory, since any religious acts performed without wearing it were said to  
be ineffective.  
In modern times its presence generally means that the wearer is a brahmin,  
since it is mainly the brahmins who  
carry out this rite today. The sacred  
thread is worn for extended periods of  
time, although it must be changed at  
certain times: after the wearer has suffered violent impurity (**ashaucha**), such  
as that of death; after performing any  
578  
Sabarmati  
rite of expiation (**prayashchitta**); and  
after **eclipses** or other highly inauspicious times. For further information see  
Pandurang Vaman Kane, *A History of*  
*Dharmasastra*, 1968; and Raj Bali  
Pandey, *Hindu Samskaras*, 1969. The  
former is encyclopedic and the latter  
more accessible; despite their age, they  
remain the best sources on traditional  
Hindu rites.
