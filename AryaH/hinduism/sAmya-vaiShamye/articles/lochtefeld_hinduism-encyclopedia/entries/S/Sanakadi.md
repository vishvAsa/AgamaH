title = "Sanakadi"

+++
(“**Sanaka** and the others”) In Hindu  
mythology, a collective name for four  
sages born of **Brahma** who are paradigms of **asceticism**; the four sages  
are Sanaka, **Sanandana**, **Sanatana**,  
and **Sanatkumara**. When Brahma  
emanates them, he commands them  
to begin the work of creation, but they  
are so detached from worldly concerns that they refuse to do so. They  
are celibate their entire lives, study  
the **Vedas** from childhood, and always  
travel together.
