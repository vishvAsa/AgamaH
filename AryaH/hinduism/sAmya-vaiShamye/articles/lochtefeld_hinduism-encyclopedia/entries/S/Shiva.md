(auspicious) Along with the god **Vishnu**  
and the **Goddess**, one of the three most  
important **deities** in the Hindu pantheon. All three are notable for being virtually absent from the Vedas, and their  
collective rise to dominance (and the  
gradual eclipse of the original Vedic  
gods) points clearly to a definitive  
change in the Hindu tradition. Of the  
three, Shiva is not mentioned at all  
in the **Veda**. He is identified with the  
god **Rudra**, who first appears in a few of  
the late Vedic hymns and who is later  
identified in the **Shvetashvatara**  
**Upanishad** as the single supreme deity  
behind all things. The word *Shiva*  
(“auspicious”) first appears in this  
upanishad, but as an adjective modifying the feminine noun *body*.  
Despite Rudra/Shiva’s appearance in  
the upanishad as a supreme divinity, his  
position is not clear-cut. He is described  
as a master of archery who dwells in the  
mountains (and thus away from human  
beings) and is implored not to use his  
arrows to harm either man or beast. It is  
certain that Rudra/Shiva is not a Vedic  
deity, and some have claimed that his  
roots lie in the ancient urban-cultural  
center known as the **Indus Valley civilization**, citing as evidence one of the  
seals found in **Harappa**, an ancient city  
of Pakistan, which shows a horned figure sitting cross-legged as if in meditation. This identification is possible but  
hardly compelling. A more likely possibility is that he entered the pantheon as  
a god worshiped by **ascetics**, who have  
always been associated with mountain  
dwellings. His connection with ascetics  
is reinforced by several ascetic characteristics attributed to Shiva, such as the  
matted locks and ash-smeared body.  
Ascetic origins would also account for  
his marginal status among the gods,  
since this would have rendered him an  
“outsider” to Vedic sacrificial cult, which  
was the “established” religion of the  
time. Shiva’s dramatic entry into the  
pantheon comes in the story of the  
death of his wife **Sati**. In this story, his

Shiva  
Statue of the god Shiva from the Kumbha Mela festival in Allahabad. Living outside of society with his hair  
in matted locks and his body smeared with ash, Shiva is often regarded as the model for the Hindu ascetic.  
father-in-law **Daksha’s** insulting remarks—  
that Shiva was an ascetic with no money,  
job, or family, and was unfit to join  
respectable society—finally resulted in  
the destruction of Daksha’s **sacrifice** as a  
sign of Shiva’s supremacy.  
Shiva has retained this ambivalent,  
sometimes marginal quality in his  
iconography, his mythology, and his  
character. Perhaps his most basic and  
important characteristic is that he is a  
divinity whose nature allows him to  
move beyond the opposing forces (or  
dualities) within himself and the world  
by being at all times the possibility of  
both forces at once. Shiva can represent  
both the wild and dangerous side of life  
and the respectable and refined side. On  
the one hand, he is the typical ascetic,  
with matted hair, ash-smeared body,  
and a home on Mount **Kailas** in the  
remote **Himalayas**. On the other hand,  
he is Hindu society’s ideal for the good  
husband, who dotes upon his wife  
**Parvati**. His body is adorned with  
snakes and clothed with a bloody **elephant** skin, but he also wears the  
**Ganges** River and the crescent **moon**,  
which are associated with beauty, **purity**,  
and **auspiciousness**. His mythic deeds  
stress his overwhelming power, against  
which no enemy can stand, and his sudden and sometimes impetuous temper,  
seen best in the destruction of **Kama**,  
the god of love; yet this sudden violence  
contrasts with his **grace** and favor  
toward his devotees (**bhakta**), by whom  
he is given the name “quickly satisfied”  
(Ashutosh) and to whom he will give  
almost everything. Although he is portrayed as simple and without deceit (as  
**Bholanath**, the “simple lord”), he is also  
traditionally described as the expositor  
of the **tantras**, the most secret and  
hidden religious practice of all. This  
transcendence of all opposites can be  
seen in the images that commonly  
represent him: in his form as **Nataraja**,  
in which many of these contrary attributes are shown, or as **Ardhanarishvara**,  
in which the image is half male and half  
female. This transcendence of duality  
is also visible in the **linga**, the  
pillar-shaped object that is his symbolic  
form, whose base and shaft are interpreted as symbolizing male and female  
reproductive organs. Finally, one can  
see this transcendence in the tantric  
conception of the **subtle body** (the  
system of psychic centers, or **chakras**,  
that run throughout the human body),  
in which religious practice aims for the  
union of Shiva and **Shakti**. As Wendy  
Doniger O’Flaherty points out, through  
his actions Shiva embodies all the  
contradictory possibilities for human  
experience, and in mythic form provides  
a resolution that one ordinary human  
life can never provide.  
In medieval times Shiva’s devotees  
developed a doctrine of **avatars** (incarnations of Shiva who take the form of a  
variety of saints, sages, and minor  
deities who appear on earth to restore  
balance and perform other necessary  
acts), probably in response to the older  
and better developed notion of avatars  
of Vishnu. Unlike Vishnu’s avatars,  
Shiva’s do not seem to have been a way  
to create a place for smaller existing  
deities in the larger pantheon. Of Shiva’s  
twenty-one avatars, the most important  
one is **Hanuman**, who is the only one  
with a well-established independent  
cult. The others were sages (such as  
**Durvasas**) and important beings, but  
the worship of Shiva’s avatars has never  
upstaged the worship of Shiva himself,  
as has often happened with Vishnu. For
