title = "Steya"

(“theft”) In the **dharma literature**, one  
of the **Four Great Crimes** whose commission made one an outcast from society; steya was theft of a **brahmin’s** gold,  
above a certain specified amount. One  
guilty of this crime was to go to the king  
bearing an iron club and receive a blow  
to the head intended to be fatal. This  
blow would absolve the sin, whether or  
not one actually died, although one  
was also expected to restore the stolen  
property. For lesser amounts of gold the  
punishment was less severe and satisfied by fasting (**upavasa**) and other  
penance (**prayashchitta**). The stress on  
the seriousness of this sin clearly reflects  
the interests of the brahmins, who  
undoubtedly wrote most of the  
dharma literature.
