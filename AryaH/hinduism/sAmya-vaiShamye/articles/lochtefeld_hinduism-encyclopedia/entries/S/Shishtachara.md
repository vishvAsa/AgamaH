title = "Shishtachara"

+++
The “practice of learned [people],”  
which was one of the traditional sources  
for determining religious duty (**dharma**)  
for matters not discussed in the **dharma**  
**literature**, or for cases in which the literature itself gave conflicting opinions.  
Although Shishtachara was the least  
authoritative source of dharma, after the  
Vedic scriptures and the dharma literature, making it an authority recognizes  
that life has many ambiguities and  
uncertainties and at the same time provides a resource for determining the  
appropriate action by taking as a model  
the practice of established and knowledgeable people. Another term to designate this sort of authority was **sadachara**,  
the “practice of good [people].”
