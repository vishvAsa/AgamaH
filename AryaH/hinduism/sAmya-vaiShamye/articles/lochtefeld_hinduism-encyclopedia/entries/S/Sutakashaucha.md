title = "Sutakashaucha"

+++
The impurity (**ashaucha**) caused by  
childbirth (sutaka). All bodily effluvia  
(**hair**, spittle, pus, **blood**, etc.) are  
considered to be sources of impurity,  
and because **birth** is attended with  
these it is considered impure, even  
though it is always regarded as an  
auspicious and happy event. There is  
also impurity caused by death, known as  
**maranashaucha**, but the presence of  
the **corpse** renders this impurity more  
violent; needless to say, it is also considered inauspicious.
