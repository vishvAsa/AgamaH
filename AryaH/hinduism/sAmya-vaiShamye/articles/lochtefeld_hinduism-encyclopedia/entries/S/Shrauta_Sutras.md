+++
(“aphorisms on Vedic rituals”) A set of  
brief sayings (4th c. B.C.E.) explaining the  
ritual instructions for performing the  
public sacrifices prescribed in the  
**Vedas**, the earliest and most authoritative Hindu religious texts. Such sacrificial instructions had been prescribed in  
the **Brahmana** literature—itself considered part of the Veda—but with the passage of time the Brahmanas had become  
too complex and difficult to understand.  
The Shrauta Sutras were essentially  
manuals for the priests presiding over  
the Vedic sacrifices, composed to ensure  
that the sacrifices would be performed  
correctly. Aside from instructions for  
639  
Shrauta Sutras  
performing the **sacrifice**, the Shrauta  
Sutras also contained an appendix with  
the exact measurements for the sacred  
altar, known as the **Sulva Sutras**. In theory, the Shrauta Sutras were the first part  
of a **Kalpa Sutra**, which would also contain prescriptions for domestic rites  
(**Grhya Sutras**) and appropriate human  
behavior (**Dharma Sutras**), with each  
Kalpa Sutra being connected to one of  
the four Vedas. But in practice the story  
of the Shrauta Sutras is far more  
complex, since aside from the three  
complete Kalpa Sutras that have  
survived, by **Apastamba**, **Baudhayana**,  
and **Hiranyakeshin**, there are other  
Shrauta Sutras, indicating a more  
independent composition.
