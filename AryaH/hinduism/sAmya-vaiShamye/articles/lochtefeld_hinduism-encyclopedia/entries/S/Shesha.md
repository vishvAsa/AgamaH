title = "Shesha"

+++
(“remnant”) Mythical thousand-headed serpent upon which the god  
**Vishnu** reclines, as on a couch;  
Shesha is also considered to support  
the various regions of the **earth**, particularly the underworlds. His name  
comes from the fact that he is considered a partial incarnation of Vishnu  
and is thus related to Vishnu, both as  
incarnation and through his status as  
Vishnu’s couch. As with most of the  
gods’ animal associates, Shesha does  
not play a prominent role in his own  
right. The one mythic episode in  
which he does play an important part  
is that of churning the Ocean of Milk  
in which Shesha serves as the churning-rope to turn Mount **Mandara**,  
with all the gods pulling from one  
side, and the **demons** pulling from the  
other. Yet here too he is only instrumental, necessary for the episode to  
unfold but with the main focus lying  
elsewhere. Shesha is seen as having a  
protective role. In Hindu astrology  
(**jyotisha**) he is identified as the protective **deity** for the fifth **day** of each  
half of the **lunar month**. See also  
**Tortoise avatar**.
