title = "Shiv Sena"

+++
(“Army of **Shivaji**”) Militant Hindu organization formed in Bombay in the late  
1960s by Bal Thackeray. It was originally  
a movement made up of people native  
to **Maharashtra**, a modern Indian “linguistic state” formed to unite people  
with a common language, to resist the  
perceived dominance of outsiders, in  
this case migrants from **Tamil Nadu** who  
were taking away jobs from the  
Maharashtrian “sons of the soil.” This  
nativist bent is reflected in its name, taking as its symbol the Maharashtrian  
hero Shivaji, who successfully resisted  
the power of the Moghul Empire. In  
more recent times the movement has  
associated itself with **Hindutva** or  
Hindu nationalism, projecting itself as  
defending the interests of the larger  
Hindu community against the “outsiders,” in particular Muslims. The Shiv  
Sena’s potential for violent action is well  
known, and they have always been  
ready to defend their interests with  
physical force, as well as working  
through official channels. The Sena’s  
ability to provide “muscle power” has  
given them political strength in  
Maharashtra, both in the municipal  
government of Bombay, and most  
recently as a partner (with the **Bharatiya**  
**Janata Party**) in running the state  
government. This political strength  
is being translated into a strong  
presence in other areas, particularly  
in labor unions, in which the Senaaffiliated union is gaining greater  
influence and membership. See also
