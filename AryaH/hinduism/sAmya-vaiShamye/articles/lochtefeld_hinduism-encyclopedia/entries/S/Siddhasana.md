(“perfected posture”) One of the common sitting postures (**asana**) used for  
meditation. In this position one foot  
(often the left) is placed with the heel in  
the area between the anus and genitals,  
with the other foot resting on the opposite calf, turned so that the heel is  
straight up. This is called the “perfected”  
posture partly because of its difficulty—  
only those perfected in **yoga** can do it—  
but also because it is believed to bring  
substantial spiritual benefits.
