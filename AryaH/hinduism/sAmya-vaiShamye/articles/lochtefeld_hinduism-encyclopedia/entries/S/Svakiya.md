title = "Svakiya"

+++
(“belonging to oneself”) Mode of conceiving the relationship between lover  
and beloved, in which the man  
and woman are married to each  
other. The **svakiya** relationship is  
socially respectable—sanctioned by  
society, upholding social propriety,  
fruitful, and procreative in its course.  
Although this mode of relationship  
is rich and celebrated, this very  
social approval is said to make it  
less intense than the adulterous **parakiya**  
relationship, in which the lovers gain  
nothing but their love itself. Although  
in most cases the union between  
the god **Krishna** and his consort  
**Radha** is described as parakiya, some  
**Vaishnava** communities—such as the  
**Radhavallabh** community—claim that  
this relationship is svakiya, perhaps  
reflecting reservations about endorsing  
**adultery**, even by the **deities**.
