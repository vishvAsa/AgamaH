title = "Sanaka Sampraday"

+++
One of the four branches (**sampraday**)  
of the **Naga** class of the **Bairagi** ascetics.  
Bairagi ascetics are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Vishnu**. The Nagas are fighting  
ascetics hired by the other Bairagis to  
protect them. The Naga class is organized in military fashion into different  
**anis** or “armies.” Until the beginning of  
the nineteenth century their primary  
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,  
although they also had substantial trading interests; both of these have largely  
disappeared in contemporary times.  
The Sanaka Sampraday traces its spiritual lineage from the **Nimbarki** sect,  
founded by **Nimbarka**. Members of this  
sect **worship Radha** and **Krishna** as a  
divine couple, with both **deities** holding  
equal status.
