title = "Shabari"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, a tribal woman  
who is a sincere devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Rama**. Shabari belongs to a  
group known as the Shabaras, and so  
her name conveys a sense of anonymity, since it is simply the feminine form  
of the group’s name. Rama and  
**Lakshmana** stop for some time at  
Shabari’s dwelling during their search  
for Rama’s kidnapped wife **Sita**.  
Although as a tribal she has very low  
social status, Rama graciously receives  
her hospitality as a reward for the  
devotion with which it is given. In the  
**Ramcharitmanas**, the vernacular  
retelling of the *Ramayana* written by  
the poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623?),  
Shabari tastes each fruit before she  
gives it to Rama, to be sure that he will  
get only the very sweetest—an act that  
violates one of the most pervasive ritual taboos barring the exchange of any  
food that has come into contact with  
saliva, and particularly from lower to  
higher status people. Yet in the story  
Rama eats the fruits very happily  
because of the love with which they  
are given. The message in this episode  
is consistent with a primary theme in  
the *Ramcharitmanas*, namely, the  
power of devotion to override or overturn conventional social norms. Soon  
after Rama and Lakshmana’s visit,  
Shabari dies a happy death.
