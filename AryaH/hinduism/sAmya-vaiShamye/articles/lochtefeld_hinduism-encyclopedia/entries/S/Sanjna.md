title = "Sanjna"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of  
**Vishvakarma**, workman and architect  
for the gods. Sanjna has been married to  
**Surya**, the **Sun**, but finds his dazzling  
radiance too much to bear. To help his  
daughter adjust to her husband,  
Vishvakarma trims off some bits of the  
sun with his divine tools, removing  
enough of his radiance that Samjna can  
bear to be with him. The trimmed-off  
parts of the sun are used to build the  
**Pushpak Viman**, an **aerial car**, as well as  
the god **Vishnu’s** discus (**chakra**), the  
god **Shiva’s** trident, and various other  
divine weapons.
