Hindu religious life is intimately connected to the land of India itself, which  
is studded with sacred sites, known as  
**tirthas**. These can be lakes, rivers,  
mountains, or any other natural feature;  
they can also be cities, temples, or any  
other created environment; they can  
even be the presence of holy men and  
**women**. Pilgrimage (**tirthayatra**) to any  
sacred site is a means of spiritual and  
religious advancement. See **tirtha**.
