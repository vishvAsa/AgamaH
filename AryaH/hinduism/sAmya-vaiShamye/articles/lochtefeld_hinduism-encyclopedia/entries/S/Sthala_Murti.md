title = "Sthala Murti"

+++
(“fixed image”) Image of a **deity** that is  
fixed in a certain place and does not  
move from it (in the case of stone  
images, this is often because such  
images are so large and heavy that  
moving them is virtually impossible).  
The other sort of image is the **utsava**  
**murti**, a movable image used during  
festival processions.
