title = "Saphala Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waxing) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Paush** (December–January). All the  
eleventh-day observances are dedicated  
to the **worship** of **Vishnu**. Most Hindu  
religious festivals have certain prescribed rites, which usually involve fasting (**upavasa**) and worship and often  
promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. Those performing this rite  
must stay up all night singing and telling  
of Vishnu’s exploits. The name *Saphala*  
means “successful,” and those who  
faithfully observe this will be successful  
in all their endeavors.
