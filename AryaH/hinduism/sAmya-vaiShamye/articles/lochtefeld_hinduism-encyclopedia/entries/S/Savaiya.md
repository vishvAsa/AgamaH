Syllabic **meter** in **Hindi** poetry, composed of four lines of between twentytwo and twenty-six syllables each. Its  
loose form gives the poet some flexibility,  
but the challenges of working with such  
an extended meter place considerable  
demands on the poet’s skill, making this  
one of the more “literary” meters.
