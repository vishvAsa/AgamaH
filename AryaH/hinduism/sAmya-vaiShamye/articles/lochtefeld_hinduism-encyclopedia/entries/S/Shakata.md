+++
(“cart”) One of the **demon** assassins sent  
by **Kamsa**, the demon-king of **Mathura**,  
to kill his nephew, the child-god  
**Krishna**. Shakata takes the form of a  
cart, intending to take the infant  
Krishna unaware. Yet Krishna is not  
fooled by this deception: With a kick of  
his infant toes Krishna launches the cart  
into flight, killing the demon with the  
force of the blow.
