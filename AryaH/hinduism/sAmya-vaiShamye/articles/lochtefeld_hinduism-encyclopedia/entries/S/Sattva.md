(“goodness”) One of the three fundamental qualities (**gunas**) believed to  
be present in all things. The other two  
gunas are **rajas** (“passion”) and **tamas**  
(“darkness”). According to this model,  
the differing proportions of these  
qualities account for the differences  
between the properties of concrete  
things, and in individual human  
capacities and tendencies. Of the  
three, sattva is invariably positive and  
carries associations with goodness,  
truth, wholesomeness, health, cognitive thought, and deep-rooted religious life. The notion of these three  
gunas originated in the metaphysics of  
the **Samkhya** school, one of the **six**  
**schools** of traditional Hindu **philosophy**. Although much of Samkhya  
metaphysics connected with the  
gunas have been long discredited, the  
idea of the gunas and their qualities  
has become a pervasive assumption in  
Indian culture.
