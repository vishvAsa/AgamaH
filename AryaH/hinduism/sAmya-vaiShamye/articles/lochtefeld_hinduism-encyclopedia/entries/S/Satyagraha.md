(“Holding Fast to the Truth”)  
Organized campaign of nonviolent  
resistance or non-cooperation as a  
political tool, a technique best refined  
by **Mohandas K. Gandhi**. For Gandhi  
himself, the basis of this technique  
was rooted in his commitment to the  
truth and his conviction that his opponents could be swayed by the **power of**  
**truth**, if it was put before them.  
Gandhi’s satyagraha campaigns would  
begin by publicly pointing out the  
injustice in question, in the hope that  
this alone could lead to the matter  
being rectified. If nothing was done, a  
campaign would then begin, but the  
adversary would always be informed  
of what was to happen next. The real  
goal was not to humble the adversary  
but to persuade the other party to see  
the rightness of one’s position and to  
accept it. The most important thing of  
all was to retain one’s own commitment to the truth and never to compromise it, even if doing so could gain  
one some immediate advantage. For  
Gandhi, in the end the truth was the  
only thing that mattered, and winning  
or losing could only be measured insofar as one kept this in perspective.
