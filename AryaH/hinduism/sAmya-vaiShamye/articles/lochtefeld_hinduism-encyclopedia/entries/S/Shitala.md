title = "Shitala"

+++
Hindu **goddess** who is both worshiped  
and feared. Shitala was traditionally  
believed to be the physical representation of smallpox, a deadly virus, and a  
person infected with the disease was  
thought to be possessed by the goddess,  
a notion reinforced by the fever and  
delirium that often accompany this disease. Shitala is also associated with  
heat—both because of the fever caused  
by smallpox and because her major  
religious observance, **Shitalashtami**,  
comes near the advent of the hot **season**. Shitala is considered a jealous,  
spiteful goddess whose wrath is visited  
upon those who ignore and displease  
her. The literal meaning of her name,  
“Cool One,” can be seen as an attempt to  
appease her wrath through flattery.  
Shitala has retained prominence even  
though the World Health Organization  
has declared that smallpox has been  
completely eradicated. In a fascinating  
example of religious change, one writer  
details how Shitala has shifted the disease through which she shows herself,  
and now appears in the guise of tuberculosis. See Margaret Thrice Egnor, “The  
Changed Mother, or What the Smallpox  
Goddess Did when There Was No More  
Smallpox,” *Contributions to Asian*  
*Studies XVIII*, 1984.
