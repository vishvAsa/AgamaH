title = "Samavaya"

+++
(“**inherence**”) Fundamental category  
in the worldview of the **NyayaVaisheshika** philosophical school.  
This school conceives of the world as  
made up of atomistic parts, which are  
connected to form larger things. The  
fundamental function of samavaya is  
as a subtle glue to connect various  
things: wholes and their parts, substances and their attributes, motions  
and the things that move, and general  
properties and their particular  
instances. It also connects both pleasure and pain to the Self. Thus  
samavaya is the fundamental thing  
holding the universe together. The  
philosophical problems raised by the  
idea of inherence—particularly the  
claim that inherence was one single  
principle, and not a collection of  
things—were ultimately responsible  
for the rise of **Navyanyaya** school,  
which attempted to explain these relationships in a more sophisticated way.
