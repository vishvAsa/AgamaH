title = "Sampraday"

+++
(“tradition”) Literally, “that which is  
handed down,” or the transmitted body  
of teachings that distinguishes one religious group from another. Belonging to  
a particular sampraday is based on having received teachings from one’s spiritual preceptor (**guru**), thus becoming  
part of a spiritual lineage, and continuing the life of that sampraday by transmitting the teachings to disciples.  
Although the sampraday is often translated as “sect,” this loses its sense of  
uniqueness within particular theistic  
traditions. For example, one can speak  
of different sampradays among Tamil  
**Shaiva** brahmins, by virtue of their differing spiritual lineages, even though  
they **worship** the same **deity** and share a  
common cultural heritage.
