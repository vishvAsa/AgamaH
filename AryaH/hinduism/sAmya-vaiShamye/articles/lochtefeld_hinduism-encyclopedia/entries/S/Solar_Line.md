title = "Solar Line"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the two  
great lineages, the other being the **Lunar**  
**Line**. The Solar Line traces its descent  
from **Ikshvaku**, the grandson of the **Sun**  
himself. Its descendants include many  
of the principal characters in the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
Indian epics. One of these descendants  
is **Rama** himself. In many of the small  
former princely states in **Rajasthan**, the  
rulers claimed descent from the Solar  
Line as a way to establish and support  
their royal authority. Although they no  
longer wield ruling power, many of these  
royal houses still exist, and thus this lineage is believed to be still extant.
