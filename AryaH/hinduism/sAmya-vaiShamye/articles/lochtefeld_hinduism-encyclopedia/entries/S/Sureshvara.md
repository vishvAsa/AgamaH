Philosopher in the **Advaita Vedanta**  
school, and one of two attested  
disciples of the school’s founder,  
**Shankaracharya** (788–820?), the other  
being **Padmapada**. The Advaita school  
upholds a philosophical position known  
as monism, which is the belief that a single Ultimate Reality lies behind all  
things, and that all things are merely differing forms of that reality. Advaita proponents exemplify this belief in their  
claim that reality is nondual (**advaita**)—  
that is, that all things are nothing but the  
formless, unqualified **Brahman**, despite  
the appearance of difference and diversity. For Advaita proponents, the  
assumption that the world is real as perceived is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate nature of things and  
a manifestation of **avidya**. Although  
often translated as “ignorance,” avidya  
is better understood as the lack of genuine understanding, which ultimately  
causes human beings to be trapped in  
karmic bondage, reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
In Hindu thought, Sureshvara is the  
only explicit proponent of **leap philosophy**, although one can see traces of this  
in the other figures in **Advaita Vedanta**,  
particularly in his teacher. Leap philosophy affirms that one can attain complete freedom from bondage, which in  
the Indian context is identified as the  
end of reincarnation and final liberation  
of the soul (**moksha**), but that such freedom cannot be gained by a precisely  
specified sequence of causes and  
effects. According to Sureshvara, since  
the ultimate problem stems from one’s  
mistaken understanding, the only solution can come from purified, correct  
understanding. Sureshvara’s path, such  
as it is, is to use a negative dialectic to  
distinguish clearly what the Self is not,  
and when one’s mind has been prepared, to gain a flash of mystic insight  
through hearing one of the **mahavakyas**  
(“great utterances”) that identify the  
Self with **Brahman**. Sureshvara affirms  
that actions can have no part in this  
process, since action is bound up with  
the world and is pervaded by ignorance. For further information see A. J.
