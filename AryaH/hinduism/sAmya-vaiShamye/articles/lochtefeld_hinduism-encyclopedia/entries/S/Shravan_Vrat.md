title = "Shravan Vrat"

+++
Religious vow (**vrat**) performed during  
the entire **lunar month** of **Shravan**  
(July–August), which is dedicated to the  
god **Shiva**. During this month devotees  
(**bhakta**) will perform various acts of  
homage, abstinence, and **worship**,  
although the strictness of this observance depends largely on individual  
inclination. Some worshipers observe a  
vow on each **Monday** of Shravan to worship Shiva (Monday is the day of the  
**week** over which he presides). The  
observant will fast (**upavasa**) during the  
day, worship Shiva and members of his  
“family” (**Ganesh**, **Parvati**, and **Nandi**),  
and sometimes stay up late into the  
night reciting Shiva’s mythic deeds.  
Some devotees will also refrain  
from cutting their **hair** and **shaving**  
their beards during this month, in  
imitation of Shiva’s primary identity as  
the great **ascetic**.  
Another observance falling in  
Shravan is the festival of **kanvars**, in  
which devotees draw pots of **water** from  
the **Ganges**, suspend them from a bamboo pole (kanvar), and carry this water  
to a Shiva temple, where it is offered to  
Shiva. This practice occurs in many  
places throughout northern India, but  
the most famous place is at **Deoghar** in  
the state of **Bihar**. There Shiva is present  
in his form as **Vaidyanath** (“Lord of  
Physicians”), and the image of  
Vaidyanath at Deoghar is one of the  
twelve **jyotirlingas** (images considered  
especially sacred). Pilgrims going to  
Deoghar draw their water from the  
Ganges at Sultanganj, and then walk to  
Deoghar to offer the water, a distance of  
over sixty miles. This particular observance combines devotion to God with  
the willingness to suffer hardship; it is  
often performed to fulfill a vow made  
when asking for some divine favor. See  
also **Solah Somvar Vrat**.
