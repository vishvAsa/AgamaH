title = "Shrichakra"

+++
Symbolic diagram (**yantra**) used in **worship** by the **Shrividya** school, a branch  
of the secret, ritually based religious  
practice known as **tantra**. The  
640  
Shravan  
Shrichakra is a set of nine interlocking  
triangles with four pointing up and five  
pointing down. The figure is surrounded  
by a double series of lotus petals, then  
an enclosing circle, and finally angular  
exterior walls. In the center of the diagram is a single point known as the  
**bindu**, representing the ultimate divinity  
that is the source of all things. The  
shrichakra is considered a subtle form of  
the **goddess** Lalita Tripurasundari, a  
goddess who is identified with different  
local goddesses throughout southern  
India. Lalita Tripurasundari is considered a “textual” goddess since she  
appears as an object of worship in the  
Shrichakra diagram but has no temple  
or image. The Shrichakra is used as a ritual aid during the rite known as  
**samharakrama**, in which the adept  
symbolically destroys the external  
world and ideas of a separate Self to  
become completely identified with  
this goddess, who is considered the  
source of all reality. For extensive  
information on the Shrichakra, see

*the Three Cities*, 1990.
