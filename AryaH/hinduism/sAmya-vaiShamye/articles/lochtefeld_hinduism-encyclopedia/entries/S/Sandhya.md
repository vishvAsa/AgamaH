(“union”) Morning and evening twilight,  
the two transitional times between day  
and night and thus, metaphorically, the  
times when day and night are united.  
The word also often denotes certain  
rites performed daily at morning, noon,  
and evening, the three times when different parts of the day are in union.  
These rites are prescribed in the **dharma literature** as mandatory for all  
**twice-born** men, that is, all men from  
the **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**  
groups who have undergone the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the  
“second birth.” At present time these  
rites are performed only by the most  
orthodox brahmins.
