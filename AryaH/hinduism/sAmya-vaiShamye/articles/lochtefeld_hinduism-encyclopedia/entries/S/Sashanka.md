title = "Sashanka"

+++
(7th c.) King of Bengal who was an  
ardent devotee (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva** and a fierce opponent of  
Buddhism, which was deeply entrenched  
in his domain. According to reliable  
historical reports, Sashanka not only  
persecuted the Buddhists themselves  
but also tried to destroy the tree in  
Bodh **Gaya** under which the Buddha  
gained enlightenment. This is one of  
the few well-documented cases of **religious persecution**.
