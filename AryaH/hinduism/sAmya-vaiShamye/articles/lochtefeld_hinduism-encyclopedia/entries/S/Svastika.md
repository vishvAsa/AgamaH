title = "Svastika"

Although in the modern mind the  
svastika is indelibly associated with  
Adolph Hitler’s Germany, it has a long  
and venerable history as an Indian symbol, predating the Nazis by several thousand years. The name is compounded  
from *su* (“good”) + *asti* (“to be”) + *ka*  
(“making”), and a general translation  
would be something like “bringing good  
fortune.” In Hindu India the svastika is a  
symbol of life, prosperity, and good fortune, at least when the arms are pointing in a clockwise direction. Circling an  
object in this direction presents one’s  
right side to the central object, and since  
this side is considered purer, the svastika  
with arms pointing clockwise is considered more auspicious than its counterclockwise counterpart.
