(“with conceptions”) In certain schools  
of Indian **philosophy**—among some  
Buddhists, the **Nyayas**, and the  
**Prabhakara** school of **Mimamsa**—a  
term referring to complex conceptual  
knowledge in which the mind puts  
together and interprets data from the  
senses or from memory. Since such  
knowledge involves the activity of the  
mind, it is susceptible to error. The  
opposite sort of knowledge, called  
**nirvikalpaka**, nonconceptual awareness, is produced directly by the operation of the senses without any interpretation. According to these schools, if the  
senses producing this awareness have  
no defect, such an awareness is true.
