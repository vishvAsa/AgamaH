title = "Sita"

+++
(“furrow”) Daughter of King **Janaka**,  
wife of the god-prince **Rama** (himself  
the seventh **avatar** or incarnation of the  
god **Vishnu**), and the major female  
character in the **Ramayana**, the earlier  
of the two great **Sanskrit** epics. Unlike  
many other Hindu goddesses, Sita’s  
identity stems almost completely from  
her husband, and she has little independent **worship** or personality of her own.  
Her abduction by the **demon**-king  
**Ravana** is the single major event driving  
the plot of the *Ramayana*, prompting  
her husband and his allies first to search  
the **earth** for her and then to fight a climactic battle to regain her, concluding  
with Ravana’s death. Throughout all the  
tumult Sita simply waits to be rescued,  
sure that this will provide her husband  
with greater glory.  
According to her charter myth, Sita is  
not born in the normal way but is found  
in a furrow by King Janaka as he plows  
his field. Sita thus carries a strong association with the earth, fertility, and prosperity; as David Kinsley points out, her  
marriage to Rama symbolizes the union  
between the fecund earth and a righteous king that will make it prosper. Her  
connection with the earth is also seen in  
her disappearance, when in response to  
Rama’s accusations of unfaithfulness,  
she calls on the earth to swallow her up  
as a witness to her chastity, and disappears forever.  
Sita’s primary virtue is her devotion  
to her husband, and in her unflagging  
love for him she is a model Hindu wife,  
just as many of the *Ramayana*’s other  
characters incarnate cultural ideals. An  
early sign of her devotion is shown  
when Rama has been wrongly exiled in  
the forest for fourteen years. Even  
though Sita has never known anything  
but luxury and ease, she is determined  
to accompany him into exile, based on  
the conviction that a faithful wife  
should always accompany her husband. Rama objects, reasons, and even  
forbids her, but Sita does not give in—  
perhaps the only time that she does  
not observe her husband’s wishes. She  
goes to the forest with Rama and her  
brother-in-law **Lakshmana**, cheerfully  
taking on the difficult life of an **ascetic**,  
since this means she can remain with  
her husband.  
The more difficult test of her devotion to her husband comes when she is  
abducted and held captive by Ravana.  
She holds steadfast despite Ravana’s  
unceasing persuasion, threats, and  
attempts to convince her that Rama has  
been killed. According to one story, the  
only part of Ravana that she ever sees is  
his feet, since as a devoted wife she kept  
653  
Sita  
her eyes modestly downcast rather than  
look directly at another man. When  
Rama’s ally **Hanuman** discovers where  
Sita is hidden, she refuses to let him  
carry her away, since this will have  
meant touching another man, as well as  
depriving her husband of the opportunity to rescue her.  
Her devotion is severely tested after  
her rescue, when Rama insists that she  
must have been unfaithful to him during her long captivity. This accusation  
reflects the Indian cultural assumption  
that **women** have much higher sex drives than men, and much less ability to  
control these drives. Stung by this accusation, she asks Rama to have a funeral  
pyre built for her and enters it with the  
wish that, if she is innocent, the **fire** will  
not harm her. When the blaze dies down  
she emerges unscathed, with the god  
**Agni** (fire personified) as a witness to  
her chastity. Despite this proof, Rama  
banishes her from **Ayodhya** after their  
return. When Rama later demands a  
second **ordeal**, Sita calls on the earth  
to swallow her up as a witness to her  
**purity**, and disappears forever.  
Sita’s ability to withstand both  
ordeals reflects the widespread Indian  
belief that women gain power through  
their devotion to their husbands, power  
that can be so great that they can even  
**curse** the gods themselves. Encoded in  
this notion are cultural messages about  
the role of women and the importance  
of their relationships with others. Sita  
represents the model Indian woman,  
whose primary loyalty is to her husband  
and his family. This reflects the northern  
Indian marriage pattern in which brides  
are brought into the groom’s home and  
become part of their marital families,  
severing their connection with their  
**birth** family. Wives are expected to place  
other people’s welfare before their own,  
so that they may live a happily married  
life. In return for such self-**sacrifice**, a  
wife becomes a model for all to respect  
and honor.
