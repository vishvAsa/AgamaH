(“faithful”) Ancestral memorial rite, performed either for one specific person  
(**ekoddishta**), or for a group in which the  
primary beneficiaries were one’s three  
paternal ancestors (**parvana**).  
An ekoddishta shraddha is usually  
first performed on the eleventh day after  
a person’s death, although it may be  
repeated on the anniversary of the  
death. It is also usually performed every  
year during the **Pitrpaksha**, a two-week  
period specifically devoted to such rites,  
on the lunar day during this period that  
corresponds to the lunar day of death.  
A parvana shraddha can be performed on a number of different occasions, for a number of different reasons. In the **dharma literature** and its  
commentaries, shraddhas are classified as falling in all three categories of  
ritual action: **nitya**, **naimittika**, and  
**kamya**. Certain shraddhas are obligatory (nitya) because they are prescribed for certain particular times,  
such as during the Pitrpaksha. Other  
shraddhas are occasional (naimittika)  
because they are necessary only under  
certain conditions, such as the obligation to give a **tirtha** shraddha when  
one visits a pilgrimage place (tirtha).  
Finally, certain shraddhas are freely  
performed because of the desire (**kama**)  
for certain benefits from them—usually  
conceived as the well-being of one’s  
ancestors—and these are desiderative  
(kamya) shraddhas.  
Whatever the motive for giving the  
shraddha, the general procedure always  
has two particular features: symbolically  
feeding one’s ancestor(s) by **offering**  
balls of cooked grain (**pindas**), and feeding real food to a group of brahmins (the  
group with the highest social status in  
Hinduism) representing one’s ancestors.  
Each of these parts is given a great deal  
of ritual elaboration, and there is considerable disagreement about which  
should come first, but in modern times  
offering the pindas generally precedes  
the meal. Many texts exalt the spiritual  
merits generated from feeding brahmins, but this is hardly surprising, since  
most of these texts were written by brahmins, and for many brahmins living at  
pilgrimage places these shraddhas were  
(and remain) an important part of their  
livelihood. However, many people deem  
this livelihood parasitic, and it is also  
potentially inauspicious, since it is  
gained through rites performed for the  
638  
Shiwalik Hills  
dead. For further information see
