title = "Sons"

It is difficult to overstate the importance  
traditional Hindu culture has placed on  
the need for sons, and the cultural bias  
for sons over **daughters**. Religious  
motives underlie one important reason  
for this bias, since only sons are entitled  
to perform the memorial **offerings** for  
the dead known as **shraddhas**. The men  
in each generation are responsible for  
making these offerings to their ancestors. They are in turn obliged to have  
sons of their own, so that the family lineage and the chain of ancestral offerings  
remains unbroken through the generations. Sonless couples are not completely  
out of luck, since sons can be obtained  
through **adoption**.  
The other major reason behind the  
preference for sons lies in far more pragmatic motives. According to the traditional Indian marriage pattern, daughters move into their marital homes and  
become members of their marital families, whereas sons bring their brides into  
the home and through their own families continue the family line. Thus, parents sometimes see their daughters as  
“temporary” family members, while  
their sons are “permanent.” The sons  
will dwell in their natal house their  
entire lives, support their parents in  
old age, and produce the family’s  
future generations. These traditional  
practices and beliefs still hold very  
strong, although the forces of modernity  
have affected the joint family. It has  
become more common for husbands  
and wives to live separately from the  
husband’s parents.  
The religious, economic, and social  
factors behind this preference for sons  
have sometimes had terrible consequences. Consciously or unconsciously,  
sons may be favored over daughters in  
many significant ways. Sons are often  
given better access to education and  
economic opportunities, because men  
are traditionally required to support  
their families. A similar presumption lies  
behind the inequities in traditional  
Hindu **inheritance** laws, which give  
the sons a much larger share of the  
inheritance. In poorer families, sons  
may even get preference for basic needs  
such as food and access to medical care.  
Despite these patterns, in contemporary  
times many families treat all their  
children with equal love and care. Given  
the trend toward smaller families, the
