(“discrimination of the real”) **Theory of**  
**error** propounded by **Ramanuja**, the  
eleventh century philosopher who was  
the founder of **Vishishthadvaita**  
**Vedanta**. This theory is also known as  
yathakhyati (“discrimination [of things]  
as they are”). All the theories of error aim  
to explain why people make errors in  
judgment, the stock example being mistaking the silvery flash of sea shell for a  
piece of silver. Ramanuja’s analysis is  
based on the understanding that all  
things are composed of the five **elements**, and that the different proportions of the elements account for their  
differences. The viewer is correct in perceiving the silvery flash, since this is a  
property shared by both shell and silver.  
The error comes in supposing that the  
object is silver—that is, taking the part  
of the judgment that is true, and making  
an incorrect assumption based on that.  
As for some of the other theories, the  
ultimate reason one “sees” silver and  
not other silvery things comes from  
karmic dispositions stemming from  
**avidya**, specifically the greed for silver  
that prompts us to look for such items of  
value. For further information see
