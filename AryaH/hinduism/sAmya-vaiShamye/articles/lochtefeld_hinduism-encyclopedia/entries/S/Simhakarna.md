(“**lion’s** ear”) Another name for the hand  
**gesture** (**hasta**) known as **kataka hasta**,  
in which the fingers are loosely pressed  
onto the thumb, creating a ring. This  
particular name comes from the fanciful  
notion that the shape of the hand  
resembles a lion’s ear. See **kataka hasta**.
