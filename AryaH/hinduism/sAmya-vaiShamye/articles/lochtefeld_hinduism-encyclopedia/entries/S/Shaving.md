Shaving  
A man shaves an infant boyâ€™s head. Hair is believed to trap impurities.  
purification. Body hair, however, is  
rarely shaved, since the **Sanskrit** language has different words for these  
two types of hair, and they are considered to be different things entirely.  
During the period of impurity associated with death (**maranashaucha**) the  
mourners will not shave for the entire  
ten days, signifying their continuing  
impurity, but at the end of that period  
they will shave completely to signify  
their final purification. Hindu men  
will sometimes also refrain from  
shaving as a sign of austerity while  
they are keeping religious vows, and  
shave when the vow has been completed. One example occurs during  
the **lunar month** of **Shravan**, in which  
men who are devotees (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Shiva** will often refrain from  
shaving. Another example can be  
found in the ritual preparation for the  
annual pilgrimage to **Shabari Malai**;  
men must keep a strict **ascetic** discipline for forty-one days before the pilgrimage, in which one element is a  
ban on shaving.
