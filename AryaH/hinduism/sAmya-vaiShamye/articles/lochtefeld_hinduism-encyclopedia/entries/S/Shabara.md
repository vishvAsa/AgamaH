title = "Shabara"

In the **Purva Mimamsa** school of  
Hindu **philosophy** Shabara was the  
author of the earliest and most famous  
commentary on **Jaimini’s Mimamsa**  
**Sutras**, the school’s founding text. The  
commentary is called Shabara**bhashya**. The date of the text is highly  
uncertain, and estimates range from  
the first century B.C.E. to the fourth or  
sixth century C.E. As often happens,  
later commentators have accepted  
Shabara’s commentary as part of the  
text itself and commented on it as well  
as on the original sutras.
