title = "Smarta"

+++
Name for a particular group of brahmins  
distinguished not by region or family,  
but by the religious texts that they hold  
most authoritative. For the Smartas, the  
most authoritative texts are the texts  
known as the **smrtis**—either the texts  
themselves or commentaries and compilations based on them. The smrtis or  
“remembered” texts were a class of literature that, although deemed important,  
were considered less authoritative than  
the **shrutis** or “heard” texts. In brief, the  
shrutis denoted the **Vedas**, the oldest  
and most authoritative Hindu religious  
texts, whereas the smrtis included the  
**dharma literature**, the **Bhagavad Gita**,  
the **Mahabharata**, and **Ramayana**, and  
the collection known as the **puranas**.  
The Smartas thus stand in contrast with  
sectarian brahmins, whether **Shaiva**  
(devotees of **Shiva**) or **Vaishnava** (devotees of **Vishnu**), for whom their particular sectarian scriptures have the highest  
religious authority. Smarta brahmins  
can therefore claim to be following the  
oldest and best established religious  
texts and thus in some way to be the  
most orthodox. Since Smartas are distinguished by their authoritative texts  
and practice rather than by the **deity**  
they **worship**, individual Smartas may  
worship different Hindu deities, and  
many do. Yet particularly in southern  
India, many Smartas perform the **panchayatana puja** to the five divine  
forms—Vishnu, Shiva, **Surya**, **Ganesh**,  
and the **Goddess**—which is intended to  
show the ultimate unity behind the differing manifestations of divinity.
