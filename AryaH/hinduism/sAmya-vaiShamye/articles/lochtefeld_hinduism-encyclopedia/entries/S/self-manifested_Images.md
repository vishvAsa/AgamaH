title = "(“self-manifested”) Images"

+++
Name denoting any image of a Hindu  
divinity believed to exist by virtue of  
divine self-revelation, rather than by  
being made or established by human  
hands. These images are believed to be  
intensely holy and powerful, and to have  
a more pronounced sense of the **deity’s**  
presence. They mark instances where  
these deities have revealed themselves  
out of **grace**, in order to become accessible to their devotees (**bhakta**), and  
they are places where the deities are  
believed to be particularly present and  
“awake,” and thus more receptive to  
requests for favors.  
Svayambhu images can be found for  
each of the three major Hindu deities.  
Images of the **Goddess** are often natural  
rock formations, such as the image of  
the goddess **Kamakhya**, which is a natural cleft in the rock, or the stone images  
of many of the **Shiwalik goddesses**; they  
can take other forms as well, such as the  
image of the goddess **Jwalamukhi**,  
which is a burning vent of natural gas.  
For the god **Vishnu**, the best-known  
self-manifested form is the **shalagram**, a  
black stone containing the spiralshaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea  
creature, which is believed to be a symbol of his discus (**chakra**). The god  
**Shiva’s** pillar-shaped symbol known as  
the **linga** appears in the widest variety of  
self-manifested forms. Many of these  
self-manifested lingas are found in natural rock formations, such as at  
**Kedarnath**; **Amarnath**, where the linga  
appears as a pillar of ice; and the **bana**  
**linga**, which is a naturally rounded  
stone, usually small enough to be easily  
portable. Further, in the Hindu religious  
groups that stress the **subtle body**, both  
Shiva and the Goddess are believed to  
be present within one’s own body. In  
some cases for all these deities, carved  
images are claimed to be self-manifest  
forms; in their usual motif the statue’s  
location is revealed to a favored devotee  
in a **dream**. A self-manifested image  
is a powerful claim for any site and will  
bolster its importance as a place of  
divine access.
