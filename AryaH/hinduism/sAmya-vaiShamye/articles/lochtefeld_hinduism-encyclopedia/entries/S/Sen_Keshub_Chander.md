title = "Sen, Keshub Chander"

+++
(d. 1884) Reformist Hindu and leader of  
the **Brahmo Samaj**, to which he gave most  
of his life. His emphases on the ideal of ethical monotheism and rejection of many rituals were heavily influenced by English  
Unitarianism. In 1865, the Samaj split over  
Keshub’s insistence that members should  
no longer wear the **sacred thread**. Then in  
1878 Keshub had an inexplicable lapse in  
principles when he arranged for the marriage of his thirteen year-old **daughter**.  
Most of his followers left him in protest,  
and he spent his remaining years creating  
what he called the New Dispensation, a  
new religion using elements drawn from  
various religious traditions. At his death he  
had few followers but had been influential  
through his earlier efforts to reform Hindu  
society, and to look critically at Christian  
culture and religion. In his curiosity for religious ideas, he happened to meet the  
Bengali mystic **Ramakrishna**, and it was  
through association with Keshub that  
Ramakrishna began to attract disciples  
from Calcutta’s middle class, most notably  
Narendranath Datta, who became famous  
as **Swami Vivekananda**.
