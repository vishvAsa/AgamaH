title = "Sugriva"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, a monkey king  
and an ally of the god **Rama** in his  
struggle to regain his kidnapped wife  
**Sita**. Sugriva and his brother **Bali**  
jointly rule the kingdom of **Kishkindha** but become enemies because  
of a misunderstanding. On one occasion the two are fighting a magician  
who has taken refuge in a cave. Bali  
goes in, after instructing Sugriva on  
certain signs that will indicate which  
of them has been killed. Sugriva waits  
outside the cave for a year, and then  
sees the sign indicating his brother’s  
death, which the cunning magician  
has engineered during his own death.  
Thinking that his brother is dead,  
Sugriva rolls a stone over the mouth of  
the cave to trap the magician, and  
returns home. Bali eventually manages  
to get out of the cave and, thinking that  
his brother has used this opportunity  
to get rid of him, forces Sugriva into  
exile and keeps Sugriva’s wife as his  
own. Sugriva lives in exile until he  
makes an alliance with Rama, who kills  
Bali by shooting him while Bali fights  
with Sugriva. After regaining his kingdom, Sugriva is a faithful ally to Rama,  
and with his monkey armies aids in the  
conquest of **Lanka**.
