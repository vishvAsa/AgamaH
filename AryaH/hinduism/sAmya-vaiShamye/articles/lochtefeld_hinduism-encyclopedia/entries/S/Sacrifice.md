title = "Sacrifice"

+++
Generally a rite involving a sacred **fire**  
and, often, an **offering** in that fire. This  
sort of ritual is rooted in the oldest part  
of the Hindu tradition, although it has  
undergone some profound changes,  
particularly in the decline of **animal** sacrifice. This sort of sacrificial rite is  
known as a **yajna**.
