In traditional Hindu belief, smallpox  
was personified as the **goddess Shitala**  
(“Cool One,” a euphemism), and the  
fever and skin eruptions accompanying  
the disease were interpreted as signs of  
**possession** by this goddess. In the time  
since the World Health Organization has  
declared smallpox officially eradicated,  
in some regions Shitala has been identified with tuberculosis. See **Shitala**.
