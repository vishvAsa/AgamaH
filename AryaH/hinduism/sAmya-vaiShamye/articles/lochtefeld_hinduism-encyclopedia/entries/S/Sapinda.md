(“having a common body”) Term for  
people having common ancestry, who  
could thus be said to share the same  
body through the ancestor. This relationship was held to cease after seven  
generations on the father’s side, and  
after five on the mother’s. Men and  
women who were sapinda were theoretically forbidden to marry, although this  
prohibition has been routinely ignored  
in southern India since very early times.
