title = "Sacchidananda"

+++
**Sanskrit** compound word denoting the  
three generally accepted attributes of  
the supreme **Brahman** (the Ultimate  
Reality of the universe according to  
some Hindu traditions): being (**sat**),  
consciousness (chit), and bliss (**ananda**).  
The differences between the form of the  
individual words and their form in the  
compound are the result of **sandhi** or  
euphonic combination.  
In certain Hindu philosophical traditions, but particularly in the **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** school, the supreme Brahman  
is considered the Ultimate Reality  
behind all things. Although Brahman is  
considered to be without particular  
qualities, these three attributes are  
believed to be inseparable from its very  
nature. It has the attribute of being,  
because it is the reality from which all  
other “being” comes. In the same way, it  
is consciousness, as the source of all  
conscious thought. Finally, bliss proceeds from its perfection, which is ultimate and complete.
