title = "Shastra"

(“order”) A shastra is the name given to a  
technical treatise explaining the standards  
of a particular cultural or artistic discipline  
in Hinduism, as in **Bharata’s Natyashastra**, a technical manual that discusses  
**dance** and the theater. When it is placed at  
the end of a compound (as in “**Shilpa**  
**Shastra**”), the word *shastra* can also serve  
to denote the whole body of teaching on  
that particular subject. All of the classical  
arts were placed under well-defined  
canons, each with its own specific rules  
and standards to guide artists: **Sculpture**  
and **architecture** were under Shilpa  
Shastra, music under Sangita shastra, and  
dance and theater under **Natya** shastra.  
Given the prevailing emphasis on upholding such strict rules, artistic genius meant  
doing something unusual within the larger  
confines of the tradition rather than creating something entirely new or original.
