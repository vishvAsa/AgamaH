(“wandering”) The cycle of reincarnation, one of the most fundamental  
assumptions throughout all Indian religion. In the Indian worldview, reincarnation involves a series of births and  
rebirths in different realms and forms,  
all based on the quality and quantity of  
**karma**, formed through previous  
actions and patterns of thought. Beings  
with good karma may be born into the  
**heavens**, which are essentially realms of  
pleasure and carefree enjoyment; those  
with bad karma may be reborn as **animals** or as **ghosts**, or into realms of punishment, such as **hells**. Neither pleasure  
nor punishment is eternal, although  
they may last an extremely long time.  
Beings in heaven enjoy the results of  
their past actions, but when their good  
karma is exhausted they must take  
another, lower birth; beings in realms of  
punishment are paying for their evil  
deeds, but when this has been done they  
will take another birth, presumably in  
some higher status.  
Between these two lies the human  
realm, which comprises infinite possibilities, based on various factors—such  
as high status or low, wealth or poverty,  
health or disability, and the religious  
piety of one’s natal family. Varying mixtures of good and bad karma combine  
for many different human circumstances, and according to popular  
belief one’s present life and body are a  
record of one’s past. The notion that  
people are, in life, where they deserve  
to be because of karma can be seen as  
the basis for the **caste** system.  
Fulfilling one’s particular social role  
(**svadharma**), no matter how humble,  
not only upholds the social order but is  
a means for individual spiritual  
advancement.  
The human realm is widely believed  
to be the best of all for spiritual life,  
partly because human beings can  
make rational choices, including the  
decision to take part in religious life. In  
this humans are different from animals, which are driven mainly by their  
instincts, and from ghosts or helldwellers, who are simply expiating  
their past acts. At the same time  
human life, unlike life in the heavens,  
is full of reverses and sorrow continually reminding human beings about  
the transience of life and possessions  
and the need to engage in spiritual  
development. Embodied existence is a  
constant cycling from one realm to the  
next, leaving one body and assuming  
another, and the inherent uncertainty  
of this condition has led to the search,  
dating from the time of the speculative  
texts known as the **Upanishads**, for an  
unchanging state, completely out of  
this cycle of rebirth. This unchanging  
state is widely accepted as life’s  
supreme goal, although in any generation very few actively seek it, with most  
people content to relegate it to some  
indefinite future lifetime. For further
