In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, the maternal  
uncle of **Duryodhana**, the epic’s  
antagonist. Shakuni’s most famous  
episode in the *Mahabharata* is as a  
player in the game of dice against  
**Yudhishthira**, the eldest of the five  
**Pandava** brothers who are the epic’s  
protagonists. The epic describes  
Shakuni as the world’s best dice player,  
whereas Yudhishthira is enthusiastic  
but completely unskilled. As  
Yudhishthira begins to lose, he keeps  
betting bigger and bigger stakes in an  
effort to win back what he has lost.  
After losing his family’s kingdom and  
all their possessions, Yudhishthira  
wagers himself and his brothers, and  
after losing this bet, he wagers and  
loses their common wife, **Draupadi**.  
As a result, Draupadi is paraded  
through the assembly hall by  
Shakuni’s nephews, Duryodhana and  
**Duhshasana**, her clothes stained  
with her menstrual blood, sharpening  
the already strong enmities between  
these two groups. Shocked at such  
treatment, Duryodhana’s father, King  
**Dhrtarashtra**, gives the Pandavas  
back their freedom. Then, because of a  
loss in a subsequent game of dice, the  
Pandavas agree to go into exile for  
twelve years and live incognito for the  
thirteenth, with the condition that, if  
they are discovered in the thirteenth  
year, the cycle will begin anew. In the  
ensuing Mahabharata war Shakuni  
fights on the side of his nephew and is  
eventually killed by the fourth  
Pandava brother, **Sahadeva**.
