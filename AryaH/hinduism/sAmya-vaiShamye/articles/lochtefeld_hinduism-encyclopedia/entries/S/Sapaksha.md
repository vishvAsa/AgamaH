title = "Sapaksha"

+++
One of the parts of an acceptable  
form of inference (**anumana**) in Indian  
**philosophy**. An acceptable inference  
has three terms: an assertion (**pratijna**),  
a reason (**hetu**), and examples (**drshtanta**);  
each of these three has its own constituent parts. The sapaksha is part of  
the third term, the examples. It is a positive example given to support the claim  
made in the initial assertion, by showing  
that similar things happen in comparable cases. For example, in the inference,  
“there is **fire** on the mountain, because  
there is smoke on the mountain,” the  
sapaksha could be “as in a kitchen,”  
since this place has both fire and smoke,  
and thus supports the initial assertion.  
Conventionally, an inference also has to  
have a negative example, to show that  
the claim made in the assertion does not  
happen in some other cases.
