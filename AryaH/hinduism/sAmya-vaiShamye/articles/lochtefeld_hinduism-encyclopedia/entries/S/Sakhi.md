(“friend,” “companion”) The motif of  
friendship as a religious ideal was well  
developed by the devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Krishna**, and to a lesser extent  
by devotees of the god **Rama**. Both of  
these **deities** are **avatars** (incarnations)  
of the god **Vishnu**, and **Vaishnava**  
devotion tends to stress not only **worship** of the chosen deity, but also the  
notions of relationship and communion—both between the deity and  
devotee, and among devotees themselves. Vaishnava religious practice  
often involved elaborate visualization  
exercises, in which devotees would  
envision the deity’s daily activities—for  
Krishna, the simple life of a village  
cowherd, and for Rama, the life of a  
prince. Some devotional manuals give  
detailed daily schedules of the deity’s  
activities to facilitate this process of  
visualization. Such elaborate visualization allowed the devotees to symbolically enter the deity’s world and take  
part in the deity’s divine play (**lila**) on  
**earth**, building a relationship with God  
through sharing the mundane elements of everyday life. In this sort of  
visualization, devotees commonly considered themselves to be the deity’s  
sakhis or companions—in some cases  
male companions, and in other cases  
female companions of the deity’s consorts, **Radha** and **Sita**. Taking on the  
persona of a sakhi provided a devotee  
with a concrete place in the divine  
world, in which he or she could both  
observe and participate in the god’s  
earthly activity.
