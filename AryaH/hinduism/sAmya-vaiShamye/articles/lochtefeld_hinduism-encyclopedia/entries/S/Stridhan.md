(“woman’s wealth”) Term denoting any  
property owned or inherited by a  
woman, which usually included any  
gifts given to her by her family or money  
that she earned herself. In the patrilineal  
**inheritance** systems prescribed by texts  
such as the **Mitakshara** and the  
**Dayabhaga**, stridhan was not considered part of the family property, but a  
woman’s personal property that she  
could dispose of as she pleased.  
Stridhan could be inherited, but the  
inheritance patterns were different than  
those for family property. The primary  
inheritors were a woman’s **daughters**;  
for **women** with no daughters, the ownership would devolve to her husband  
and his heirs, or to her birth family.
