title = "Sunday"

+++
(Ravivar) First **day** of the Hindu **week**,  
whose presiding **planet** (and **deity**) is  
the **sun** (ravi). As a day, Sunday is considered generally auspicious but not  
particularly powerful, probably because  
the sun is acknowledged as a deity but is  
not widely worshiped as a primary one.
