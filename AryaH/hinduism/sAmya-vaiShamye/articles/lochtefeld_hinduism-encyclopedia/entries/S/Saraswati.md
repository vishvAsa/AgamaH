**Goddess** associated with art, aesthetics,  
learning, sacred speech, and wisdom.  
Saraswati is the patron **deity** of culture  
in all its manifestations. The spoken  
word is considered very powerful in  
Hindu culture and Saraswati can either  
promote or frustrate one’s efforts by  
conferring or withdrawing the ability to  
speak clearly. Her association with  
sacred speech goes back to the time of  
the sacrificial manuals known as the  
**Brahmanas**, in which the cult of **sacrifice** was based on the precise performance of sacred speech and ritual.  
Her iconography emphasizes her  
connection with the life of the mind:  
She holds a book, a crystal (symbolic

of a purified mind), a **vina** (musical  
instrument), and a rosary (associated  
with religious rites, and particularly  
with the repetition of the sacred  
sounds known as **mantras**). Her animal vehicle is the swan, whose white  
color is a symbol of **purity** and whose  
high flight is a symbol of transcendence. Through Saraswati’s blessings  
(**ashirvad**) human beings can transcend their biological condition to  
create works of art and culture.  
Saraswati is usually believed to be  
married, although different mythic  
sources give her different husbands. In  
some cases she is described as the wife of  
the god **Brahma**, the creator; here their  
joint activity encompasses the formation  
of the material world and its transformation through human cultural activity. In  
other stories she is described as the wife  
of the god **Vishnu**, and thus a co-wife of  
**Lakshmi**. Here the realms of Lakshmi and  
Saraswati can be seen as giving differing  
messages about the “good things” in life—  
while Lakshmi grants wealth and material prosperity, Saraswati brings wisdom  
and culture. A popular Indian saying  
reports that Saraswati’s devotee (**bhakta**)  
will never make money, while a follower  
of Lakshmi (whose vehicle is the **owl**) will  
be “blind” to spiritual wisdom. For more
