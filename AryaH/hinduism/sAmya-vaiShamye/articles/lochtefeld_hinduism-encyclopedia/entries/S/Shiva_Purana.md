title = "Shiva Purana"

+++
One of the eighteen traditional **puranas**,  
which were an important genre of **smrti**  
texts and the repository of much of traditional Indian mythology. The smrtis,  
or “remembered” texts, were a class of  
literature, which, although deemed  
important, were considered less authoritative than the **shrutis** or “heard” texts.  
In brief, the shrutis included the **Vedas**,  
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu  
religious texts, whereas the smrtis  
included the **Mahabharata** and the  
**Ramayana**, the **dharma literature**, the  
**Bhagavad Gita**, and the puranas. The  
puranas are the collection of all types of  
sacred lore, from mythic tales to ritual  
instruction to exaltation of various  
sacred sites (**tirthas**) and actions. Most  
of the puranas stress the **worship** of  
one deity as supreme over all others  
and as this one’s name clearly shows  
it is focused on the worship of **Shiva**.  
The *Shiva Purana* is one of the  
longer and larger puranas. It gives an  
exhaustive account of Shiva’s mythic  
deeds—many of which have become  
the common mythology for many  
traditional Hindus—as well as instructions for how, where, and when Shiva is  
to be worshiped.
