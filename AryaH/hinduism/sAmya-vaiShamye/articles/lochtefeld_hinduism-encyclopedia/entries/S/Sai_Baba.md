title = "Sai Baba"

+++
Name used by two different charismatic  
Hindu teachers, now distinguished by  
the addition of other names. The earlier  
of the two is **Shirdi Sai Baba** (d. 1918), so  
named for the town in the state of  
**Maharashtra** where he lived much of his  
life. The latter figure, **Sathya** (“true”) **Sai**  
**Baba** (b. 1926), is a modern Hindu  
religious figure of the type known as a  
**godman**, who claims to be the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba.
