title = "Sainhikeya"

+++
In Hindu mythology, **demon** who  
appears in the story of churning the  
Ocean of Milk. After the gods and  
demons join forces to churn the Ocean  
of Milk and obtain the nectar of immortality (**amrta**), the gods succeed in tricking the demons out of their share. As the  
gods divide this nectar among themselves, the demon Sainhikeya slips into  
the distribution line and is mistakenly  
served some as well. As the demon  
drinks it, the **Sun** and **Moon** alert the  
god **Vishnu** to his presence and Vishnu  
cuts off the demonâ€™s head with his discus. Although the head and body are  
separated, both parts become immortal  
through their contact with the nectar.  
The head becomes **Rahu**, while the  
body becomes **Ketu**, both of which are  
considered malevolent **planets** in  
Indian astrology (**jyotisha**). According to  
tradition, Rahu is also the cause of  
**eclipses**: He roams the sky, chasing the  
Sun and Moon, and tries to get revenge  
by swallowing them, but the two planets  
always pass unharmed out of his severed neck. See also **Tortoise avatar**.
