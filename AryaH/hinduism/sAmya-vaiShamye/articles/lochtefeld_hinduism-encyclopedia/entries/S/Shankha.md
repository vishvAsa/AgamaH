A shankha, or conch shell. Used as a musical  
instrument, it is an identifying object  
carried by the god Vishnu.  
considered both a musical instrument  
and an instrument of war, since through  
its powerful sound he is said to have  
struck terror in the hearts of his enemies. The conch is also commonly  
carried by certain powerful forms of the  
**Goddess**. The reason for this can be  
found in her charter myth, in which she  
is formed from the collected radiance of  
all the gods and receives duplicates of all  
their weapons.
