title = "Suicide"

+++
An act whose permissibility and consequences have elicited varying opinions  
over time. In medieval times commentators distinguished between several  
types of suicide, depending on the circumstances surrounding the act. Any  
suicide prompted by an overpowering  
emotional impulse such as rage or grief  
was always strictly forbidden, and those  
who did this were said to reap dire  
karmic consequences. Another case  
entirely was suicide performed as an  
expiation (**prayashchitta**) for one’s sins,  
which was often prescribed to expiate  
one of the **Four Great Crimes**. A third  
type was suicide by people suffering  
from a terminal disease, or who were in  
chronic pain. This sort of suicide was  
performed according to a well-defined  
ritual, intended to put the performer in  
the proper frame of mind. This third  
category was one of the rites designated  
as “forbidden in the **Kali** [Age]”  
(**Kalivarjya**), although it had been permitted in earlier times. The most  
fascinating sort of suicide was at pilgrimage places (**tirtha**), particularly at  
**Allahabad**. This was also done according to a very specific ritual, and part of  
the ritual required the performer to  
name the benefit for which the rite was  
being performed—in some cases liberation of the soul (**moksha**), in other cases  
life in **heaven** for many eons. This practice is well documented up to the seventeenth century, although it is no longer  
done in contemporary times.
