title = "Self-Residence"

+++
In Indian logic, one of the **fallacies**  
in constructing an argument. Selfresidence occurs when the cause and  
effect are believed to be the same thing.  
Although the simplest forms of this  
fallacy are almost never found, since  
it is so patently unconvincing, one does  
find extended forms of it, such as **reciprocal dependence**, **vicious circle**, and  
**infinite regress**.
