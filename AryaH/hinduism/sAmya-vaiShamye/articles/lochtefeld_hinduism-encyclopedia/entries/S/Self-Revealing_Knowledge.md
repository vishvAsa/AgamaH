title = "Self-Revealing Knowledge"

+++
In Indian **philosophy**, the notion  
that certain things, such as knowledge,  
are self**-**revealing and do not need  
proof or substantiation to be known.  
Whether such knowledge (or things)  
exists, and what they would be if  
they did, was a source of lively  
disagreement among Indian thinkers.  
See **svaprakasha**.
