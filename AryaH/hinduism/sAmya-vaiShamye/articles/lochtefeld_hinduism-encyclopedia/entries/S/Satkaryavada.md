One of the three **causal models** in Indian  
**philosophy**, along with **asatkaryavada**  
and **anekantavada**. All three models seek  
to explain the relationship between causes  
and their effects in the everyday world,  
which has profound implications for religious life. All the philosophical schools  
assume that if one understands the causal  
process correctly, and can manipulate it  
through one’s conscious actions, it is possible to gain final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). Thus, disagreements over different causal models are not merely academic disputes but are grounded in basically  
different assumptions about the nature of  
things. The satkaryavada model assumes  
that effects preexist in their causes, which  
can thus be seen as transformations (real  
or apparent) of those causes. The classic  
example is the transformation of milk to  
curds, butter, and clarified butter.  
According to satkaryavada proponents,  
each of these effects was already present in  
the cause, and emerges from it through a  
natural transformation of that cause.  
This causal model tends to reduce the  
number of causes in the universe, since  
anything can be seen as a transformation of other things. Given these strong

Satkaryavada  
relationships, if one can understand how  
these relationships work, they can be  
manipulated to one’s advantage. The disadvantage of this model is that it can lead  
to **fatalism**. In a world in which everything  
occurs through natural transformation, it  
can seem as if the universe is running  
under its own power, and that human  
actions may not be able to influence such  
strong relationships. The philosophical  
schools espousing this model are the  
**Samkhyas**, proponents of **Bhedabhada**,  
**Ramanuja’s Vishishthadvaita Vedanta**,  
and the various branches of **Advaita**  
**Vedanta**. The first three believe that the  
difference between cause and effect is a  
genuine transformation of the cause,  
whereas the Advaita school stresses that  
this transformation is only apparent, and  
that the real source of bondage (and liberation) lies in **avidya**, the fundamental lack  
of understanding that causes one to misperceive the nature of things. For further
