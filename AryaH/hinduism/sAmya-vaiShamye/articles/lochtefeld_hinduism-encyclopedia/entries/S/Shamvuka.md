title = "Shamvuka"

+++
**Shudra ascetic** who appears both in  
the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, and in the poet  
**Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsha**, whose  
story line is based on the *Ramayana*.  
According to the story a **brahmin**  
comes to **Rama**, the epic’s protagonist, and complains that his son has  
died because of the unrighteousness  
running through the land. Since the  
king is considered responsible for the  
general moral climate in his kingdom,  
Rama immediately asks the brahmin  
for more information. He is told that a  
man named Shamvuka has been  
doing physical **asceticism** (**tapas**) in a  
bid to generate spiritual powers  
through his suffering, even though  
Shamvuka is a member of the servant  
(**shudra**) class, and these sorts of religious exercises are forbidden to people of such low social status. Rama  
finds Shamvuka hanging his head  
downward over a smoking **fire**, and  
when he refuses to desist from his  
ascetic practices, Rama kills him. This  
episode conveys several important  
messages. One of these is the Indian  
cultural belief that physical suffering  
generates spiritual and/or **magic**  
powers. When this belief is combined  
with a profoundly hierarchical model  
of society, it becomes important for  
the higher-class people to control the  
people who are allowed to do this,  
lest the lower classes gain power over  
their “betters.” Finally, this story  
shows the *Ramayana*’s general tendency to uphold established social  
values and boundaries.
