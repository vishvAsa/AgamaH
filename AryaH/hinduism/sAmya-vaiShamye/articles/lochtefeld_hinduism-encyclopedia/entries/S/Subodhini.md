title = "Subodhini"

+++
(“Greatly enlightening”) A name given to  
commentaries on various texts—presumably because of the commentary’s  
ability to illuminate the text. The most  
famous of these commentaries, to  
which the name *Subodhini* is often  
understood to refer, is the one by  
**Vallabhacharya** (1479–1531) on the  
**Bhagavata Purana**. The *Bhagavata*  
*Purana* is one of the later sectarian  
compendia known as **puranas**, and it is  
the most important source for the  
mythology of the god **Krishna**, whom  
Vallabhacharya considered the Supreme  
Being. Vallabhacharya’s *Subodhini* lays  
out the basic doctrines of his religious  
community, known as the **Pushti Marg**  
because of their stress on god’s **grace**,  
which they called *pushti*, meaning “that  
which nourishes the soul.”
