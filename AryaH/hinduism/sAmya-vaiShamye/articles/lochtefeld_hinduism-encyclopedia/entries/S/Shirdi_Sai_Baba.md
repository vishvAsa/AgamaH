title = "Shirdi Sai Baba"

+++
(d. 1918) Hindu **ascetic** and religious  
teacher whose disciples came from  
many different religious communities—  
Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, and Christian. His  
origins are mysterious, for in 1872 he  
simply appeared in the town of **Shirdi** in  
**Maharashtra**, as a boy of about sixteen.  
He was dressed in the manner of a  
Muslim **faqir** (religious mendicant, or  
beggar), but claimed to have forgotten  
his birthplace and his family. Because of  
his dress a local priest forbade him from  
staying at a Hindu temple, so he moved  
into a small, unused mosque, where he  
lived for the rest of his life. He kept a perpetual fire burning in a fire pit, and for  
religious rituals performed both Muslim  
prayers and Hindu **worship**. He was  
most famous for his supernatural powers: healing (for which he often gave  
people ash from his fire pit to eat), foretelling the future, multilocation (the  
ability to be in two places at the same  
time), and appearing in **dreams** to guide  
his followers. His response to people’s  
immediate needs made him famous  
through much of India, but he always  
maintained that his purpose in performing miracles was to attract people  
to spiritual life. He gradually attracted  
disciples, and in the time since his death  
the town of Shirdi has become an  
important regional pilgrimage place  
(**tirtha**). Although he referred to himself  
as **Sai Baba**, he is now usually called  
Shirdi Sai Baba, to distinguish him from  
**Sathya Sai Baba**, another religious  
leader who claims to be Shirdi Sai Baba’s  
reincarnated form.
