In the **Rg Veda**, the earliest Hindu sacred  
text, a servant of the storm-god **Indra**. In  
Rg Veda 10.108, Sarama is sent as an  
emissary to Indra’s enemies, the **Panis**,  
to inquire where they have hidden the  
**cows** they have stolen, and to threaten  
them with Indra’s wrath if they do not  
reveal their location.
