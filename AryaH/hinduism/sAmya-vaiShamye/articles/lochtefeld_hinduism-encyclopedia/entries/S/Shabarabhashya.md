+++
(“**Shabara’s** commentary”) Extensive  
commentary on the **Mimamsa Sutras**  
of **Jaimini**, the founding text of the  
**Purva Mimamsa** school of **philosophy**. The date of the text is uncertain.  
It is believed to have been written by  
Shabara in either the first century  
B.C.E., or the fourth or sixth century  
C.E. As often happens, later commentators have accepted Shabara’s commentary as part of the text itself and  
commented on it as well as on the  
original sutras.
