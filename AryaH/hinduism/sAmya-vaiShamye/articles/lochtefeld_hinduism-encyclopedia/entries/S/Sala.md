title = "Sala"

+++
In **Hindi**, “wife’s brother.” The term can  
be used as a serious insult if applied to  
someone who is not related in this way.  
Calling someone “sala” implies that the  
other is in a position of relative subservience, since he is a member of the  
family that “gives” the bride. It also  
implies that one is having sexual relations with that person’s sister, an allegation that is an insult to a family’s honor,  
whether or not it is true.
