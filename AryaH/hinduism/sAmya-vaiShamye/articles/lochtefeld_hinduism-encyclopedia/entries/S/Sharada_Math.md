title = "Sharada Math"

+++
One of the four **maths** or sacred centers  
for Hindu **ascetics** (often translated as  
“monasteries”) traditionally believed to  
have been established by the great  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**; the others are the **Jyotir Math**, **Shringeri Math**,  
and **Govardhan Math**. These four sacred  
centers are each associated with one of  
the four geographical corners of the  
Indian subcontinent; the Sharada  
Math is in the western quarter, in the  
city of **Dwaraka** in the state of **Gujarat**,  
on the shore of the Arabian Sea.  
Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as  
the founder of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
the most prestigious Hindu ascetic  
order. The Dashanami (“ten names”)  
ascetics are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
625  
Sharada Math  
**Shiva** who are divided into ten divisions,  
each with a different name. These  
ten divisions are organized into four larger  
organizational groups—**Anandawara**,  
**Bhogawara**, **Bhuriwara**, and **Kitawara**—  
each of which has two or three of the ten  
divisions and is associated with one of the  
four maths. Of these, the Sharada Math is  
associated with the Kitawara group.
