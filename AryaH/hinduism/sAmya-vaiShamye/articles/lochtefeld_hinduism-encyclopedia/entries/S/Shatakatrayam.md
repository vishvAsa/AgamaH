(“The Three Hundred”) Collection of  
**Sanskrit** poems ascribed to the poetphilosopher **Bhartrhari**, who is believed  
to have lived in the fifth century. The text is  
a three-part collection of poems about  
political life, love, and renunciation, which  
explore all of the conventional ends of life:  
The first two sections are about power  
(**artha**), sensual or physical desire (**kama**),  
and righteous action (**dharma**), whereas  
the final section is concerned with liberation of the soul (**moksha**). Much of the  
poetry carries a cynical, slightly bitter  
tone, suggesting the world-weariness of a  
man who has seen too much of the harsh  
realities of life. For further information see  
Barbara Stoller Miller (trans.), *The Hermit*  
*and the Love-Thief*, 1978.
