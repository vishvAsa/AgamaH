(“witness”) The perceiving consciousness believed to be the inner Self  
(**atman**), which observes changes going  
on around it but is utterly unaffected by  
them. It is described in a primitive way  
as early as the **Upanishads**, the speculative texts that form the final layer of the  
**Vedas**, the most authoritative Hindu  
religious texts. The **Katha** Upanishad  
describes the Self as a thumb-sized person inside the head. The **Samkhya**  
philosophical school develops this  
notion in a more subtle and sophisticated  
way: of its two fundamental first  
principles, one is the **purusha**, which is  
the conscious but inert witness to the  
transformations of **prakrti**, or nature.  
Later philosophical schools such as  
**Vedanta** reject the Samkhya school’s  
dualism by collapsing all reality into a  
single ultimate principle known as  
**Brahman**. Vedanta’s conception of  
Brahman as “being-consciousnessbliss” (**sacchidananda**) also conceives of  
the Self as the conscious and unchanging witness to the material flux surrounding it.
