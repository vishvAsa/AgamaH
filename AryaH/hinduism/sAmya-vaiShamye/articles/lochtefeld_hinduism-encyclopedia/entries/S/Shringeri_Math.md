title = "Shringeri Math"

+++
One of the four **maths** or monastic centers traditionally believed to have been  
established by the great philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**; the others are the  
**Jyotir Math**, **Sharada Math**, and  
**Govardhan Math**. These four sacred  
centers are each associated with one of  
the four geographical corners of the  
Indian subcontinent; the Shringeri Math  
is in the southern quarter, in the city of  
**Shringeri** in the southern Indian state of  
**Karnataka**. Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as the founder of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, the most prestigious Hindu **ascetic** order. The  
Dashanami (“ten names”) ascetics are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**, who  
are divided into ten divisions, each with  
a different name. These ten divisions are  
organized into four larger organizational  
groups—**Anandawara**, **Bhogawara**, **Bhuriwara**, and **Kitawara**—each of which has  
two or three of the ten divisions, and  
each of which is associated with one of  
the four sacred centers. Of these, the  
Shringeri Math is associated with the  
Bhuriwara group.
