Savitr  
Image of the sun god Savitr, more commonly  
known as Surya, sculpted in Bengal during the  
Pala dynasty.  
According to the **dharma literature**, a  
twice-born man was one born into the  
**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya** communities, who was thus eligible for the  
adolescent religious **initiation** known as  
the “second birth.” See **Surya**.
