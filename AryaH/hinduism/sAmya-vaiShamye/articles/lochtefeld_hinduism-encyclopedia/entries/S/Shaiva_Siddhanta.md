title = "Shaiva Siddhanta"

+++
Southern Indian religious community  
that was particularly developed in the  
Tamil country, and whose members  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**. Shaiva Siddhanta is based on a  
series of fourteen texts, all completed  
by the fourteenth century C.E., in  
which the ideas about Shiva found in  
**Sanskrit** texts were reinterpreted in  
light of the devotional faith of the  
**Nayanars**. The Nayanars were a group  
of sixty-three poet-saints who lived in  
southern India in the seventh and  
eighth centuries. The most famous  
and influential of these interpreters  
was the ninth-century poet  
**Manikkavachakar**. Central to Shaiva  
Siddhanta is the triad of Shiva as the  
“Lord” (**pati**), human souls held in  
bondage (**pashu**), and the “bonds”  
(**pasha**) holding these souls. Shiva is  
conceived as the supreme divinity,  
who wields the bonds of **maya**, or illusion, to keep souls in bondage. Yet he  
is also pictured as gracious and loving  
to his devotees, a far cry from the  
capricious and somewhat dangerous  
figure in his earliest mythology. As the  
supreme lord, Shiva is the source of all  
spiritual illumination and energy, and  
also the power through which the  
world is created, sustained, and reabsorbed again. Souls are conceived as  
different from Shiva, since they are  
subject to imperfections, although  
here too his power is their  
ultimate source. The only path to  
liberation is devotion to Shiva,  
through whose **grace** the bonds of  
maya can be broken or transcended.  
Even after liberation souls remain distinct from Shiva, although they remain  
in his presence. For further information see M. Dhavamony, *Love of God*
