title = "Shrichandra"

+++
(b. 1494–1612?) Historical founder of the  
**Udasi** (“indifferent”) **ascetic** community.  
Shrichandra was the elder son of Guru  
Nanak, the first of the Sikh community’s  
ten gurus. By all accounts, Shrichandra  
was a devout and pious man, but Nanak  
passed over Shrichandra to designate  
one of his followers, Angad, as the second  
Sikh guru. According to tradition this was  
because Guru Nanak, believing that his  
followers should live married lives in regular society, disapproved of Shrichandra’s  
status as ascetic. Due to his pedigree and  
his piety, Shrichandra gained a considerable following of his own, but the Udasis  
have always been considered as belonging in the Hindu fold. During the  
**Kumbha Mela**, an important bathing  
(**snana**) festival held in different places in  
northern India, the Udasis march third in  
the bathing procession, behind the  
**Sanyasis** and the **Bairagis**.
