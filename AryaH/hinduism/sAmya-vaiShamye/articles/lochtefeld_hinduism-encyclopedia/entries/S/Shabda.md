title = "Shabda"

+++
(“word”) In Indian **philosophy**, the  
general term for authoritative testimony. This is generally accepted as one of  
the **pramanas**, the means by which  
human beings can gain true and accurate knowledge, except by the **materialists**, who reject all pramanas except  
perception (**pratyaksha**). Such  
authoritative testimony is of two sorts.  
It most often refers to authoritative  
scriptural texts, such as the **Vedas**, but  
it can also refer to verbal instruction  
given by one’s **guru**, which is considered to have equal authority, at least  
by members of that spiritual lineage.  
Shabda is an important **pramana**  
because it tells people about those  
things that the other pramanas cannot  
uncover, such as the nature of the  
**heavens**, the course of the soul after  
death, proper religious life, and so  
forth. With regard to the liberation of  
the soul, it is often the most important  
pramana, since this cannot be discovered in any other way.
