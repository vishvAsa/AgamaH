title = "Saturday"

+++
(Shanivar) The sixth **day** of the Hindu  
**week**, whose presiding planet is **Saturn**  
(Shani). Saturn is by far the most feared  
of all the **planets**, and Saturday is considered by far the most inauspicious day  
of the week. In Hindu iconography,  
Saturn is depicted as a terrifying black  
figure holding a sword and riding a buffalo; he is also considered easily affronted and extremely thorough in avenging  
any offenses. Any misfortune Saturn  
brings will last for fourteen years—a figure doubtless drawn from the fourteen  
years of Saturn’s orbit.  
Hindus counter this danger by avoidance and **rites of protection**, just as they  
do on **Tuesday**, the other day considered to be generally inauspicious.  
Movements and activities are often  
widely restricted on Saturday, and certain activities, in particular buying  
things made from iron (whose black  
color is associated with Saturn), are  
avoided except when absolutely necessary. As on Tuesday, people **worship**  
protective **deities** and give as charity  
(**dana**) items associated with Saturn:  
iron, mustard oil, black sesame seed,  
black cloth, and black lentils. Giving  
away such items associated with Saturn  
is believed to transfer any potential  
**inauspiciousness** from Saturn to the  
recipient, providing a way to get rid of  
one’s bad luck.
