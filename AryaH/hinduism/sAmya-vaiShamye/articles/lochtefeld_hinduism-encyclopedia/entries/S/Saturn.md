title = "Saturn"

+++
In Hindu astrology (**jyotisha**), a  
strongly malevolent **planet** associated  
with obstruction and death. Saturn’s  
power and malevolent nature make  
him extremely dangerous, particularly  
608  
Sattan  
since any misfortune he brings will  
last for fourteen years—a figure  
doubtless drawn from the fourteen  
years of Saturn’s orbit. During the  
**week** Saturn presides over **Saturday**,  
considered by far the most inauspicious **day** of the week. On this day  
people refrain from numerous activities and also commonly perform **rites**  
**of protection**, such as giving alms  
(**dana**) as a way to give away any  
potential misfortune.
