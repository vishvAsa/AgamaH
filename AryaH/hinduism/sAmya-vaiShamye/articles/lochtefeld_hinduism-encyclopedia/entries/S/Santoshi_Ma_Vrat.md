title = "Santoshi Ma Vrat"

+++
Religious observance celebrated on  
**Fridays** in homage to the **goddess**  
**Santoshi Ma** (“the mother who satisfies”). This religious vow (**vrat**) is usually  
kept by **women** with the aim of attaining  
concrete goals for themselves or (more  
commonly) their families: getting a job,  
passing an exam, conceiving a child, or  
arranging a marriage. When one’s wish  
has been granted, a final ceremony  
calls for the observant to feed eight  
**brahmin** boys a meal of rice, yogurt, and  
bananas. After this concluding rite,  
one is no longer required to observe the  
vow, although many women choose  
to continue performing it as a means  
to maintain the household’s general  
good fortune.  
The Santoshi Ma Vrat has become  
extremely popular throughout northern  
India since the late 1970s, one reason  
being that it is simple and inexpensive.  
On the day of the fast (**upavasa**) the worshiper should not eat until the evening  
meal, although tea and other beverages  
are generally allowed. In the late afternoon the worshiper should light a lamp  
in front of a picture of Santoshi Ma, offer  
her small amounts of chickpeas and raw  
sugar—things that can be found in even  
the poorest households—and read  
aloud the rite’s charter myth, which tells  
how a poor, unfortunate woman solved  
all her family’s troubles through her  
devotion to Santoshi Ma. After this, the  
worshiper may eat the evening meal,  
although it is also subject to restrictions:  
Since Santoshi Ma is a goddess associated with sweetness, the food must not  
contain any sour, spicy, or bitter seasonings. This observance thus carries the  
two common features of most religious  
vows: some form of **worship** and modification of one’s diet, with the promise of  
benefits in return.
