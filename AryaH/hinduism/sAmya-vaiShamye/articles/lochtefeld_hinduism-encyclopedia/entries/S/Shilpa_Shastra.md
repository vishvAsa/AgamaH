Shilappadigaram  
Image of the god Vishnu. Crafted according to the  
rules of shilpa shastra, the image’s proportions are  
strictly defined and he holds identifying objects.  
formed, made, or fashioned. In the context of art and **architecture**, the term  
*shilpa shastra* is most often associated  
with two specific areas, which by the  
medieval era had had their conventions  
strictly fixed. One of these governed the  
creation of sculptural images, according  
to which the images of the **deities** had to  
be carved to exactly defined proportions, along with their identifying attributes. The other area was in regard  
to buildings, whether individual structures such as temples, or collections  
of buildings in city planning. The layout  
of temples was modeled after the  
human body (and thus mirrored the  
sculptor’s precision regarding the  
images of the divine); entire towns  
were similarly modeled to create a  
harmonious urban environment.
