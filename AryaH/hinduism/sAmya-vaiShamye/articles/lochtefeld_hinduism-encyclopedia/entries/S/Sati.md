title = "Sati"

+++
Hindu **goddess**, **daughter** of the demigod  
**Daksha** and wife of the god **Shiva**, whose  
death and dismemberment are pivotal  
incidents in the mythology of both Shiva  
and the **Goddess**. According to legend,  
after Sati marries Shiva, her father Daksha  
feels that Shiva has not shown him proper  
respect and develops bad feelings toward  
him. Inflated with pride, Daksha plans a  
great **sacrifice** to which he invites all the  
gods but deliberately excludes Shiva.  
When Sati learns about the sacrifice, she  
insists that she wants to go, since it is in  
her natal home. Shiva, after trying to discourage her by pointing out that one  
should not go without an invitation, finally gives her his permission. When Sati  
arrives at the sacrificial grounds and asks  
605  
Sati  
Daksha why he has excluded her husband, Daksha responds with a stream of  
abuse, excoriating Shiva as worthless and  
despicable. Humiliated by these public  
insults, Sati commits **suicide**—in some  
versions, by leaping into the sacrificial **fire**,  
in others by withdrawing into yogic trance  
and giving up her life.  
Shiva, furious at what has happened,  
creates the fierce **deity Virabhadra** (or  
in some versions, Virabhadra and the  
fierce goddess **Bhadrakali**), and dispatches them to destroy Daksha’s sacrifice. They gleefully carry out his command, scattering the guests and killing  
Daksha. The resulting carnage ends only  
when the assembled gods praise Shiva  
as the supreme deity. Daksha is eventually restored to life with the head of a  
goat, and he too repents his arrogance  
and worships Shiva. At Daksha’s request,  
Shiva agrees to remain at the sacrificial  
site forever and sanctify it. Shiva takes  
the form of a **linga**, the pillar-shaped  
object that is his symbolic form, and can  
still be seen at the **Daksha Mahadev**  
temple in the town of **Kankhal**.  
Although Shiva’s anger has been  
pacified by this **worship**, he is disconsolate at Sati’s death and wanders the  
**earth** carrying her body on his shoulders. In his grief, Shiva neglects his  
divine functions, and the world begins  
to fall into ruin. The gods, concerned  
over the world’s imminent destruction,  
go to the god **Vishnu** for help. Vishnu  
then follows behind Shiva and uses his  
razor-sharp discus to gradually cut away  
pieces of Sati’s body, until finally there is  
nothing left. When the body is completely gone, Shiva leaves for the mountains, where he remains absorbed in  
meditation until it is broken by **Kama**.  
Sati is reborn as the goddess **Parvati** and  
later remarries Shiva.  
The myth connected with the figure  
of Sati is important for several reasons.  
First, it provides the charter myth for the  
**Shakti Pithas** (“bench of the Goddess”),  
a network of sites sacred to the Goddess  
that spreads throughout the subcontinent. Each of these Shakti Pithas—  
in some lists there are fifty-one, and in  
others 108—marks the site where a part  
of Sati’s body fell to earth, taking form  
there as a different goddess. These  
differing goddesses, spread all over the  
subcontinent, are thus seen as manifestations of this one primordial goddess,  
united by the symbolism of the human  
body. Aside from establishing this network,  
the myth has several other important  
messages: It graphically illustrates the  
supremacy of devotion (in this case, to  
Shiva) over the older sacrificial cult; it  
illustrates some of the tensions in the  
joint family, in which **women** feel the  
conflict of loyalty between their natal  
and their marital homes; and it is the  
charter myth for the **Daksha Mahadev**  
temple in the town of Kankhal, just  
south of the sacred city of **Haridwar**,  
where Daksha’s sacrifice is claimed to  
have taken place. See also **pitha**.
