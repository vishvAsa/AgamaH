title = "Sundaramurtti"

+++
(8th c.) The last of the **Nayanars**, a  
group of sixty-three southern Indian  
poet-saints who were devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**. Along with their  
contemporaries the **Alvars**, who were  
devotees of **Vishnu**, the Nayanars  
spearheaded the revitalization of  
Hindu religion through their passionate devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god,  
conveyed through hymns sung in the  
**Tamil language**. Along with his predecessors, **Appar** and **Sambandar**,  
Sundaramurtti actively opposed the  
heterodox sects of the times, particularly the Jains, whom he reviles in his  
poems. The collected hymns of the  
three most important Nayanars—Appar,  
Sambandar, and Sundaramurtti—comprise the **Devaram**, the most sacred of  
the Tamil Shaivite texts. Sundaramurtti  
is also important for his catalog of the  
sixty-three Nayanars, which forms  
the first literary source for Tamil  
Shaivite hagiography.
