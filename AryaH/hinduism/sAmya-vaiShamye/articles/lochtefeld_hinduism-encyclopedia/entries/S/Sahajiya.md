title = "Sahajiya"

+++
Religious community originating in  
medieval Bengal. The Sahajiyas synthesize devotional practices to the god  
**Vishnu** and the ritual practices of the  
secret tradition known as **tantra**, particularly the extreme practices associated  
with the “left-hand” (**vamachara**) tradition of tantra. The name *sahajiya* comes  
from the word *sahaja* (“natural” or  
“spontaneous”), indicating the group’s  
belief that one’s natural passions, qualities, and tendencies should not be suppressed but should be channeled to help  
one gain final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). Over this foundation of  
tantric ritual practice was added the  
devotion to the god **Krishna** and his  
consort **Radha**, a devotional thrust  
strongly influenced by the **Gaudiya**  
**Vaishnava** religious community, founded  
by the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**. For further information see Shashibhushan B.

*the Hidden Moon*, 1989.
