Southern Indian religious community  
who are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu** and Shri (**Lakshmi**), and whose  
religious life is rooted in the devotional  
hymns of the **Alvars**, a group of twelve  
poet-saints who lived in southern  
India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees of  
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate  
devotion (**bhakti**) to a personal god,  
conveyed through hymns sung in the  
**Tamil language**, transformed and revitalized Hindu religious life. Two centuries later, the Alvars’ devotional outpouring was organized and systematized by the philosopher **Ramanuja**,  
considered the Shrivaishnava founder.  
Ramanuja was convinced that **Brahman**,  
or Supreme Reality, was a personal  
**deity**, rather than an impersonal  
abstract principle, and was also convinced that devotion was the most  
important form of religious practice.  
**Vishishthadvaita Vedanta**, his philosophical position, stressed both of these  
convictions, and thus opposed the  
**Advaita Vedanta** school founded by the  
philosopher **Shankaracharya**, which  
stressed that the Supreme Being was  
impersonal and that realization (**jnana**)  
was the best spiritual path. In the time  
after Ramanuja the Shrivaishnava community split into two smaller groups, the  
**Tengalai** and the **Vadagalai**. The schism  
stemmed from a disagreement over  
whether human action was necessary to  
attain final liberation, or whether the  
hope came in complete surrender (**prapatti**) to God’s **grace**; the Vadagalais held  
the former position, and the Tengalais  
the latter.  
In practice, the Shrivaishnava community has been strongly influenced by  
the doctrine of divine “emanations”  
originated by the **Pancharatra** religious  
community, particularly the notion that  
a properly consecrated image becomes  
a form of the deity itself. Shrivaishnava  
piety has tended to center around  
temples, and particularly the service of  
the temple’s image, which is considered  
a genuine form of the deity. Given  
this stress on learning and templebased **worship**, it is not surprising  
that the community has been dominated  
by **brahmins**, and the few nonbrahmins in the community have  
distinctly inferior status. For further
