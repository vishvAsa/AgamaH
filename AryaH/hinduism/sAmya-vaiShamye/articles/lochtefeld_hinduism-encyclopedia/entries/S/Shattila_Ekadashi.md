title = "Shattila Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waning) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Magh** (January–February). As with all  
the eleventh-day observances, this is  
dedicated to the **worship** of the god  
**Vishnu**. Most Hindu festivals have  
certain prescribed rites, which usually  
involve fasting (**upavasa**) and worship  
and often promise specific benefits  
for faithful performance. On this day  
one should bathe an image of Vishnu  
with the five auspicious things (milk,  
curds, honey, ghee, and sugar water),  
placing some sesame seed (tila) into  
each. One should also eat food containing sesame seed. During the night  
one should sleep before the image of  
the **deity**. This ekadashi’s name comes  
from the six (sat) ways in which  
the sesame seed has been used.  
Faithfully observing this festival is said  
to cause one to be reborn in Vishnu’s  
realm, **Vaikuntha**.
