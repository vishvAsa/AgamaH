title = "Shakha"

+++
(“branch”) The name given to a local  
“branch” of the **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS), whose  
membership is often drawn from a  
particular neighborhood or section of  
a city. The RSS is a conservative Hindu  
organization whose express purpose  
is to provide the leadership cadre for a  
revitalized Hindu India. The RSS has  
historically characterized itself as a  
cultural and character-building organization, and for much of its existence  
has shunned direct political involvement, although it has exercised considerable influence through its many  
affiliated organizations. Each shakha,  
or local RSS unit, holds a daily meeting  
for its members, who are known as  
**svayamsevaks** (“volunteers”). The  
meeting’s typical activities include an  
opening ceremony in which the organization’s saffron banner is raised; traditional games or exercises, including  
martial drill, and a discussion period  
in which RSS ideals can be disseminated and propagated. The shakhas in  
any given area are overseen by a fulltime RSS worker known as a **pracharak**  
(“director”), who serves as a liaison  
between the local units and the RSS  
leadership, and who oversees RSS  
activity in his area. Most of the  
shakha’s members will never advance  
beyond this local level, and those who  
do are usually gifted leaders. Thus, the  
primary stress at the shakha level is  
on forming personal relationships  
with other members, as a way to  
develop loyalty to the organization.  
Although the shakhas often have very  
high attrition, the bonds developed  
there are often very strong as well and  
are particularly beneficial in helping  
displaced and newly urbanized people develop a sense of community. For
