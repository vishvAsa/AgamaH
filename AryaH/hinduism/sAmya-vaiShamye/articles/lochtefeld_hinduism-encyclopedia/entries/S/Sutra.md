title = "Sutra"

(“thread”) In a metaphorical sense, a  
sutra is a short phrase or aphorism that  
can easily be committed to memory.  
Many early philosophical and grammatical texts were collections of such sutras,  
which are so brief that they virtually presuppose a commentary to explain their  
meaning. In many cases the commentary would have been an oral exchange  
between teacher and student, thus  
effecting the living transmission that is  
still the norm in **tantra**, a secret, ritually  
based religious practice. Memorizing  
such sutras was a way to gain mastery  
over an entire text, and the sutras could  
also serve as an aid to memory for the  
commentary, thus enabling a person to  
preserve the “thread” of the argument.  
In a more literal sense, the word sutra  
can also refer to the cord or cords strung  
through the centers of **palm leaf** manuscripts, which kept the pages of the text  
in their proper order.
