Northern Indian river that rises in the  
**Aravalli Hills** in the state of **Rajasthan**,  
and flows south to the Gulf of Cambay in  
the state of **Gujarat**. It is best known as  
the site of the Sabarmati **Ashram**, across  
the river from the city of Ahmedabad in  
Gujarat. The Sabarmati Ashram was  
home to **Mohandas K. Gandhi** for sixteen years after he returned from **South**  
**Africa** in 1915. He organized much of  
the struggle for Indian independence  
from this ashram.
