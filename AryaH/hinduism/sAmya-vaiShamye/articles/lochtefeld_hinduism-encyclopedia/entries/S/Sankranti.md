(“transition”) The transition of a celestial  
body (**sun**, **moon**, or **planet**) from one  
sign of the **zodiac** to another. Such transitions can give the celestial bodies or  
the time in question positive or negative  
qualities. The most important of these  
celestial bodies is the sun, whose two  
directional transitions—northward at  
**Makara** Sankranti, and southward at  
**Karka** Sankranti—define more and less  
auspicious times for the entire **year**.
