title = "Swami Malai"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) on a hill  
in the **Tanjore** district of **Tamil Nadu**,  
just outside the temple-town of  
**Kumbhakonam**. Swami Malai is part of  
the network of six temples in Tamil  
Nadu built to honor **Murugan**, a hill  
**deity** who has been assimilated into the  
larger pantheon as a form of the god  
**Skanda**, the son of **Shiva**. Five of these  
temples have been definitively identified, and each is associated with a particular region, a particular ecosystem,  
and a particular incident in Murugan’s  
mythic career. In the case of Swami  
Malai, it is said to be where he taught the  
meaning of the sacred syllable (**Om**) to  
his father **Shiva**, and thus presents him  
in the aspect of a teacher, which is one of  
his identifying features in **Shaiva**  
**Siddhanta** (a series of fourteen texts, all  
completed by the fourteenth century  
C.E., which reinterpret the ideas about  
Shiva found in **Nayanar** devotional  
poetry). The sixth of these temples is said  
to be every other shrine to Murugan in  
Tamil Nadu. This belief seems to stress  
Murugan’s presence throughout Tamil  
Nadu and sacrilize the entire landscape,  
giving mythic significance to every  
Murugan temple, no matter how small.  
The cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic  
vehicle for Tamil pride and identity, and  
since the number six has connotations  
of completeness—as in the six directions, or the six **chakras** in the **subtle**  
**body**—it also suggests that nothing outside is needed. For further information

the Tamil Cultus of Murukan,” in the
