title = "Shaka Era"

+++
One of the dating systems in India,  
which is claimed to mark the defeat of  
the Shakas by King Salivahana. For any  
given **year** in the common era, the  
Shaka era date is either seventy-eight or  
seventy-nine years earlier, a discrepancy  
that stems from the differing days on  
which the years begin in these two systems. In the common era the year begins  
on January 1, but in the Shaka era it  
begins with the **sunâ€™s** transition into  
Aries, determined in India as falling on  
April 14. Hence, to convert a Shaka era  
date to a common era date, one adds  
seventy-nine years for dates from  
January 1 to April 14, and seventy-eight  
years for dates from April 15 to  
December 31.
