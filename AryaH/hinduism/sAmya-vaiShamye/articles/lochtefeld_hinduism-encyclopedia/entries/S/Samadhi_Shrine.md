**Burial** place of a deceased ascetic. Part  
of the process of **ascetic initiation** is the  
initiate’s ritualized death, in which he  
(or far more rarely, she) performs his (or  
her) own funeral rites, followed by  
rebirth with a new name and a new  
identity. Consequently, upon the physical death of an ascetic the funeral rites  
(**antyeshthi**) are not performed, since  
the ascetic is (ritually speaking) already  
dead. The body is often disposed of by  
being weighted down with rocks and  
thrown into a river, but well-known and  
powerful ascetics are often buried, usually in a sitting position as if in meditation. Such people are often buried in  
places associated with their presence  
during their lives—whether a room,  
building, or particular outdoor site. In  
popular wisdom such ascetics are  
believed not to be dead but only rapt in  
deep meditation (**samadhi**). The  
samadhi shrines of very renowned  
ascetics often have shrines built over  
them, which can become places of pilgrimage for those seeking the ascetic’s  
continuing blessings (**ashirvad**).
