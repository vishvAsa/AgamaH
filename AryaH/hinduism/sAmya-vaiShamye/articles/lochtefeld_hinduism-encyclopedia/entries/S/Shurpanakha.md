([having] “nails [like] winnowing-fans”)  
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Indian epics, Shurpanakha is the  
sister of **Ravana**, the demon-king of  
**Lanka**. Although she is a minor character in the epic, she plays a pivotal role in  
advancing the action of the story. As  
Ravana’s sister, Shurpanakha is a **demon**  
woman of high status, and is free to  
choose her own husband according to  
her inclinations. As she roams through  
the forest one day, she happens to see  
**Rama**, the epic’s protagonist, and is  
immediately smitten by his handsome  
form. Assuming the shape of a beautiful  
woman, she approaches him and  
expresses her desire for him. Rama tells  
her that since he is already married, his  
brother **Lakshmana** will be a more  
appropriate match for her. When  
Lakshmana gives her reasons why he  
too cannot marry her, Shurpanakha  
becomes angry. Realizing that Rama’s  
wife **Sita** is the real impediment to her  
desires, Shurpanakha tries to harm her,  
and in the struggle that follows,  
Lakshmana mutilates her by cutting off  
her ears and her nose. Shrieking with  
pain and humiliation, Shurpanakha  
returns to her brother Ravana’s court,  
who swears that her insult will be  
avenged. After their brothers **Khara** and  
**Dushana** are killed in a direct attack on  
Rama, Ravana decides to get revenge by  
kidnapping Sita, an action that eventually causes his own death.
