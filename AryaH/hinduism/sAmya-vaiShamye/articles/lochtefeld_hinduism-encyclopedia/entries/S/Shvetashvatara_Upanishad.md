title = "Shvetashvatara Upanishad"

+++
A text generally regarded as one of the  
latest **upanishads**, the speculative religious texts that themselves form the  
most recent stratum of the **Vedas**. This  
judgment is based on both the Shvetashvatara Upanishad’s form and on its  
content. Stylistically, the earliest upanishads tend to be written in prose, or  
prose mixed with verse, whereas the  
later upanishads, including the Shvetashvatara, are completely in verse. In  
terms of content, the earlier upanishads  
tend to be long and rambling, whereas  
in the later ones the ideas are far more  
concise and clearly developed. The  
Shvetashvatara Upanishad’s most original idea is its description of the  
Supreme Being in completely theistic  
terms, in contrast to the abstract,  
impersonal representations in the earlier  
upanishads. It identifies Ultimate  
Reality as the god **Rudra**, who was later  
identified with the god **Shiva**, one of the  
most important modern Hindu **deities**.  
The text is also notable for an explicit  
description of the process and results of  
649  
Shvetashvatara Upanishad  
**yoga**, which is the first known written  
explanation of this tradition.  
Although it is best noted for these  
new ideas, the upanishad also reveals  
continuity with the older tradition. The  
second chapter begins with an extended  
invocation to the god Savitr (**Surya**),  
the **sun**, using verses drawn directly  
from Vedic texts composed a thousand  
years earlier. Such anachronisms  
indicate that there was no clear dividing  
line between the four differing types  
of Vedic text—**samhita**, **Brahmana**,  
**Aranyaka**, and **upanishad**—but rather  
that these textual styles were composed  
in overlapping periods.
