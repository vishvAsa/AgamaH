title = "(“Hundred-Path”) Brahmana"

+++
One of the two most important texts in the  
**Brahmana** branch of sacred Vedic literature, along with the **Aiteraya Brahmana**.  
The Brahmanas were primarily manuals  
describing the correct performance of  
Vedic ritual sacrifices. Each Brahmana was  
in theory connected with one of the  
**Vedas**, which gave them Vedic authority,  
but in fact they were quite different from  
the Vedas in scope and content. According  
to tradition, the Shatapatha Brahmana  
was connected with the “white” recension  
of the **Yajur Veda**, a variant form of the text  
in which the explanatory notes connected  
with the Vedic mantras have been collected  
into a separate appendix. This is in  
626  
Sharva  
contrast with the “Black” Yajur Veda, in  
which these notes have been incorporated  
into the body of the text itself. Aside from  
giving instruction on the practice of rituals,  
the Shatapatha Brahmana includes a wide  
variety of texts, one of which is the **Isha**  
**Upanishad**. The upanishad’s presence in a  
Brahmana text clearly shows that there  
was considerable overlap in the times of  
composition of various Vedic literary  
styles, rather than clear-cut “periods.”
