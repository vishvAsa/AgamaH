title = "Stages of Life"

+++
As described in the **dharma literature**,  
there were four stages (ashramas) in the  
life of a **twice-born** man, that is, a man  
born into one of the three “twice-born”  
groups in Indian society—**brahmin**,  
**kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—who are eligible  
for the adolescent religious **initiation**  
known as the “second birth.” In the first  
stage, immediately after this initiation,  
the young man would live as a celibate  
student (**brahmacharin**) studying the  
Vedas in his **guru’s** household. The second stage was that of the householder  
(**grhastha**), in which he would marry,  
raise a family, and engage in worldly life.  
In the third stage, as a forest-dwelling  
hermit (**vanaprastha**), he would gradually detach himself from worldly entanglements. The final stage was as a total  
renunciant (**Sanyasi**), who had given up  
all things in a search for the ultimate  
religious truth. These four stages are an  
idealized progression and should not be  
understood as describing actual practice, since most men never pass beyond  
the householder stage of life and have  
no desire to do so.  
Beneath this idealized progression  
lies the tension between two differing

Stages of Life  
modes of religious life—that of the  
householder, which is based in the  
world, and that of the **ascetic**, which  
renounces the world. The latter ideal  
originated with the religious adepts  
known as the **shramanas** and evolved  
into the monastic **asceticism** of the  
Buddhists and Jains, which was portrayed as a superior religious path than  
the householder’s life. Both these groups  
were highly influential—the Jains had a  
significant presence in southern Indian  
society up to the eighth century C.E.—  
and it is generally accepted that the pattern of the four ashramas was evolved as  
a way to appropriate and transform this  
stress on ascetic life. The doctrine of the  
four stages provided a place and time for  
asceticism, but as the last stage, at the  
end of one’s life. The clear message was  
that one should engage in the search for  
religious truth only after fulfilling one’s  
social and ancestral duties.
