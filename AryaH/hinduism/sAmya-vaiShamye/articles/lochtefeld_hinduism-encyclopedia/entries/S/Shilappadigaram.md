(“the Jeweled Anklet”) The greatest epic  
poem in classical Tamil literature. It is  
traditionally ascribed to the poet  
**Ilangovadigal** (2nd c.) but almost certainly was written several centuries  
later. The poem is a symbolic theater for  
several important themes that have pervaded Hindu culture, particularly the  
need for a king to rule righteously and  
the power gained by a wife through her  
devotion to her husband. The story tells  
the tale of a married couple, Kannaki  
and her husband Kovalan. In his infatuation with a dancer, Kovalan squanders  
the family’s wealth, selling nearly all  
their possessions. When he finally  
returns to his wife, their only remaining  
valuables are one pair of her jeweled  
anklets. The couple decides to travel to  
the town of **Madurai** to sell the anklets,  
and use the proceeds to reestablish their  
family as traders.  
When they reach Madurai, however,  
tragedy strikes. The night before the  
couple’s arrival, a dishonest jeweler has  
stolen an identical pair of anklets from  
the queen of Madurai, and when  
Kovalan goes to sell the anklets, the  
same jeweler accuses him of being the  
thief. Kovalan is executed, and when  
Kannaki hears of this she comes into the  
city, bearing the other anklet as a sign of  
his innocence. She gains an audience  
with the king, who falls dead with  
remorse when he realizes the disaster he  
has caused. Still furious, Kannaki rips off  
her left breast, pronounces a **curse** on  
the city, and hurls the breast onto the  
street; the breast bursts into flames that  
consume the city. In the end, Madurai’s  
patron **goddess** persuades Kannaki to  
withdraw her curse, and Kannaki dies a  
few days later.  
One of the forces assumed to be  
operating here is the power of a woman’s  
devotion to her husband. Even though  
Kovalan squanders all their money  
through unfaithfulness, Kannaki readily  
takes him back when he returns, and is  
willing to give up her last resource to  
help him. The power of her devotion  
gives her the ability to cause widespread  
destruction through a single curse, and  
the strength of this power is still an article of faith among many Hindus even  
today. For further discussion of the  
themes in this play, and more general  
consideration of images of Hindu  
**women**, see Sarah Mitter, *Dharma’s*
