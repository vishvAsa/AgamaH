title = "Singh, Udit Narayan"

+++
(r. 1796–1835) Maharaja of **Benares**  
whose reign saw the first performances  
of the **Ram Lila** at his palace in  
**Ramnagar**. The Ram Lilas are dramatized versions of the epic **Ramayana**,  
which transcend simple theater to  
become a form of **worship**. The Ram  
Lila at Ramnagar, the fort that is home to  
the kings of Benares, is the most famous  
and traditional of all these Ram Lilas.  
According to tradition, the Maharaja  
was a great devotee (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Rama** and a patron of the Ram Lilas in  
Benares itself, but on several occasions  
found it difficult to get across the  
**Ganges** because of the seasonal flooding. As a solution to the problem, he  
sponsored his own Ram Lila—no doubt  
also symbolically intended to reinforce  
his kingship—which has become the  
oldest, most traditional, and most  
important Ram Lila in Benares. Udit  
Narayan Singh finalized the  
locations of the Ram Lila, which is  
performed throughout the city, whereas  
his son **Ishvari Prasad Narayan Singh**  
was responsible for writing the  
dialogues (**samvads**) spoken by the  
characters. For further information see
