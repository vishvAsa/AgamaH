title = "Shivaga-Sindamani"

+++
By far the latest of the three **Tamil epics**,  
written perhaps in the late sixth century.  
The story describes the adventures  
of Shivaga, a man who excels at every  
possible manly art, who with each  
new challenge wins a new wife for  
his harem but in the end renounces  
everything to become a Jain monk.  
Although the story clearly has a Jain  
bias, the *Shivaga-Sindamani* paints a  
635  
Shivaga-Sindamani  
useful picture of contemporary southern Indian life.
