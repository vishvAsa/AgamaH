title = "Sagara Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant ascetics  
who are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**.  
The Dashanamis were supposedly  
established by the ninth-century philosopher **Shankaracharya** in an effort  
create a corps of learned men who  
could help to revitalize Hindu life.  
Each of the divisions is designated by a  
581  
Sagara Dashanami  
different name—in this case, sagara  
(“ocean”). Upon **initiation**, new members are given this name as a surname to  
their new **ascetic** names, thus allowing  
for immediate group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten “named” divisions are divided  
into four larger organizational groups.  
Each group has its headquarters in  
one of the four monastic centers  
(**maths**) supposedly established by  
Shankaracharya, as well as other particular religious associations. The Sagara  
Dashanamis belong to the **Anandawara**  
group, which is affiliated with the **Jyotir**  
**math** in the Himalayan town of  
**Joshimath**.
