title = "Shvetaketu"

+++
A character in the **Chandogya Upanishad**, one of the speculative texts that  
form the latest stratum of the **Vedas**.  
In the upanishad, Shvetaketu is the  
**son** of **Uddalaka Aruni**, and a paradigm for a seeker of knowledge.  
Shvetaketu’s education also symbolizes  
the conception of true knowledge found  
in the Upanishads and the way that this  
differs from earlier conceptions.  
According to a story in the upanishad’s  
sixth chapter, Shvetaketu is sent away by  
his father to study the Vedas, and when  
he returns twelve years later having  
mastered all the Vedas, he incorrectly  
considers himself learned. Shvetaketu’s  
father punctures his arrogance, showing  
him the difference between memorization and true knowledge, by asking  
Shvetaketu questions about the nature  
of the cosmos. When Shvetaketu cannot  
answer these, he admits his ignorance  
and accepts instruction from his father  
on the nature of the Self (**atman**). This  
instruction contains the teaching “That  
thou art” (**tat tvam asi**). This is one of  
the “great statements” (**mahavakya**) in  
Indian **philosophy**, and asserts the  
ultimate nondifference between **Brahman**  
and **atman**, the cosmos and the individual Self.
