title = "Sankat Mochan"

+++
(2) A temple in the southern part of  
**Benares** dedicated to the monkey-god  
**Hanuman** in his form as Sankat Mochan.  
The temple does not have a long history  
but first became famous in the nineteenth  
century through some **Ramanandi** ascetics  
living there, whose piety drew visitors to  
the spot. In modern times, the temple  
has become popular because the image  
of Hanuman is believed to be very powerful, but also accessibleâ€”qualities that  
lead petitioners to come with requests  
and leave with the assurance that help  
is forthcoming.
