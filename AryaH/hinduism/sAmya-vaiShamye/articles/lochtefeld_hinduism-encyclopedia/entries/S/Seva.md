title = "Seva"

+++
(“service”) Actions springing from an  
attitude of loving devotion, manifested  
as attendance on and service to a **deity**,  
religious teacher (**guru**), or any superior  
person. The notion of seva is particularly  
important in the relationship between  
religious teacher and disciple. The  
teacher’s task is to further the disciple’s  
spiritual development, which may  
sometimes entail harsh criticism to  
reform some of the disciple’s faults. The  
ideal disciple will accept such direction  
in a spirit of self-effacement and carry  
out the teacher’s instructions faithfully  
and without protest, as a sign of submission and service. Such arrangements are  
often necessary for spiritual growth, and  
a teacher can often give a much more  
objective assessment of the disciple’s  
true spiritual state and what must be  
done for advancement. Still, when one  
of the parties is not sincere, this model  
has great potential for abuse. In such  
circumstances the teacher’s call for obedience and service—in which any “resistance” to the teacher’s demands can be  
cited as a sign of spiritual immaturity—  
can be a way to take advantage of a  
devotee (**bhakta**).
