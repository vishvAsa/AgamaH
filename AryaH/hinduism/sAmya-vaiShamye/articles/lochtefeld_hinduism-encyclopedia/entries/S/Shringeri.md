title = "Shringeri"

+++
Town and sacred site (**tirtha**) in eastern  
**Karnataka**, about 160 miles west of  
Bangalore. Although Shringeri is a very  
small town, it is religiously significant as  
the home of the Shringeri **Math**, one  
of the four **Dashanami** maths, the  
monastic centers believed to have  
been established by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. The **ascetics** of the  
Shringeri math have a reputation for  
very strict adherence to traditional practice, and the town has a long standing as  
a center for religious learning.
