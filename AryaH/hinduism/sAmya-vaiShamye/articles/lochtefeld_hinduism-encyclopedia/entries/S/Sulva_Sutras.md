title = "Sulva Sutras"

+++
(“aphorisms on measurement”) A collection of brief sayings giving the exact  
rules for constructing the sacrificial  
altars for the public Vedic sacrifices. The  
Sulva Sutras were connected to the  
**Shrauta Sutras**, which laid down the  
ritual prescriptions for these rites, of  
which the preparation of the site was  
an obvious necessity. Given the  
premise that the **sacrifice** would be  
unsuccessful unless it was performed  
exactly right, such precise attention  
to the altar’s construction seems a  
necessary consequence.
