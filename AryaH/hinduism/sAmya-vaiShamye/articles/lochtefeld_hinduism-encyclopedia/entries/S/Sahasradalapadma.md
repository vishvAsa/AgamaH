In many schools of **yoga**, and in the religious tradition known as **tantra**, one of  
the sites in the **subtle body** (an alternate  
physiological system believed to exist on  
a different plane than gross matter but  
with certain correspondences to the  
material body). The subtle body consists  
of a set of six psychic centers (**chakras**),  
which are visualized as six multipetaled  
lotus flowers running roughly along the  
582  
Saguna  
course of the spine and connected by  
three vertical channels. Each of these  
chakras has important symbolic associations—with different human capacities, with different subtle elements (**tanmatras**), and with different seed syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed from the letters of the **Sanskrit** alphabet, thus  
encompassing all sacred sound. Above  
and below these centers are the bodily  
abodes of **Shiva** (awareness) and **Shakti**  
(power), the two divine principles  
through which the entire universe has  
come into being. The underlying  
assumption behind this concept of the  
subtle body is thus the homology of  
macrocosm and microcosm, an essential Hindu idea since the time of the  
mystical texts known as the **Upanishads**.  
The sahasradalapadma is the site at  
the apex of the **subtle body**, visualized  
as a “thousand-petaled lotus” located in  
the crown of the head. This is identified  
as the bodily abode of Shiva, where he is  
ever-present. In tantra, final liberation  
(**moksha**) comes through the divine  
union of Shiva and Shakti in one’s own  
body. This is done through awakening  
the **kundalini**, the bodily correlate of  
Shakti that lies dormant at the base  
of the spine, and drawing the kundalini  
up to the sahasradalapadma to effect  
the divine union. The sahasradalapadma  
is identified with the seed syllable  
**Om**, the symbol of completeness and  
perfection. For further information see
