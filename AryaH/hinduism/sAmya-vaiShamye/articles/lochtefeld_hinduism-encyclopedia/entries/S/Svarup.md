title = "Svarup"

+++
(“own-form”) In popular devotional dramas such as the **Ram Lila**, which is  
based on the story of the **Ramayana**,  
svarup is the name for the child-actors  
(most often **brahmin** boys) playing the  
parts of the gods and goddesses.  
Viewing these performances is not simply entertainment but also an act of religious devotion, since such dramas are  
considered to be ways in which the gods  
reveal themselves to their devotees  
(**bhakta**). When the actors are in makeup and in character—or wearing  
crowns, as in the case of the **Krishna**  
**lilas** in the town of **Brindavan**—they are  
actually considered to be forms of the  
**deity**, revealed within the context of the  
lila. As one sign of this status, a regular  
feature of such performances is time set  
aside for **darshan**, in which the actors sit  
perfectly still for the viewers to view  
them as an act of **worship**, in the same  
way that people would interact with an  
image in a temple.
