title = "Shramana"

+++
(from the **Sanskrit** verb *shram*, “to  
strive”) General term denoting religious  
adepts from the middle of the first millennium before the common era whose  
beliefs stressed renunciation, **ascetic**  
practices, and the search for intuitive  
insights. Shramana religious practice  
was individualist, experiential, freeform, and independent of society. All of  
these qualities put them in religious  
competition with the **brahmin** priests,  
whose practice stressed mastery of  
sacred texts and performing enormously  
complex rituals; the need for sponsors  
for these rituals made brahmin religion  
“establishment” religion, serving its  
patron classes. Indian grammarians use  
the pair shramana and brahmin to illustrate typically bitter opponents, along  
with examples such as mongoose and  
cobra, and their difference seems to be  
between a religious model stressing  
individual charisma (shramana), and  
one stressing highly trained technical  
expertise (brahmin). Part of the shramana tradition remained outside the  
Hindu fold by virtue of resolutely rejecting the authority of the **Vedas**; the Jains,  
Buddhists, Ajivikas, and other religious  
groups developed as a result of this  
rejection of the Vedas. Part of the shramana tradition was absorbed into traditional Hinduism in the **dharma literature**, which found a place for renunciant  
**asceticism** in the form of the **Sanyasi**,  
the last of the four traditional **stages**  
**of life** (ashramas). For further information on the shramanas and the  
development of this tradition, see
