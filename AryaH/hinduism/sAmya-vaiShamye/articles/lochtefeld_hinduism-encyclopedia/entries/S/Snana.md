(“bath”) Bathing is arguably the single  
most commonly performed Hindu religious act, and it is a necessary one  
before performing any rite or **worship**.  
An early morning bath is the norm for  
just about all Hindus, and this has been  
true for centuries. The earliest European  
visitors invariably remarked on this  
practice, since some of these visitors  
bathed only a few times in their lives.  
For Hindus, bathing not only keeps one  
clean but is a way to regain ritual **purity**  
by using water (most commonly) to  
remove any source of defilement.

Snana  
Snana, or bathing, at a festival in Rajasthan. Before performing any ritual, one must obtain  
purity by bathing.  
Bathing is normally the last part of one’s  
morning rites, preceded by cleaning  
one’s teeth and tongue, rinsing the  
mouth (**achamana**), and (immediately  
before bathing) voiding one’s bladder  
and bowels. These latter acts are a necessary part of life, but they also render  
one ritually impure, a state that the bath  
removes. People generally perform any  
daily worship immediately after  
bathing, while this ritual purity is  
still unbroken.  
Most people bathe only in the morning, although those scrupulously concerned with purity (generally brahmins  
or ascetics) will bathe more often. The  
bath itself is usually quite brief and  
some in cases consists of simply  
immersing oneself in a natural body of  
water, or pouring a bucket of water over  
one’s head. In modern times people  
often use soap, but the traditionally prescribed cleansing medium is **earth**. It is  
preferable to bathe in running water,  
since the bath purifies by removing the  
impurity (**ashaucha**) and carrying it  
away and although bathing in a large  
pond is seen as acceptable, bathing in a  
bathtub is seen as simply spreading the  
impurity around rather than getting rid  
of it. Although the most common medium  
for bathing is water, when this is impossible one can ritually cleanse oneself  
with oil, or one can perform ritual  
cleansing with **mantras** by using sacred  
sounds to remove defilement and bring  
one to a state of ritual purity.  
In the context of worship, snana is  
the sixth of the sixteen traditional  
**upacharas** (“**offerings**”) given to a **deity**  
as part of worship, on the model of treating the deity as an honored guest. In this  
offering, the deity is bathed, either literally or symbolically. The underlying  
motive here, as for all the upacharas, is  
to show one’s love for the deity and minister to the deity’s needs.
