title = "Samkalpa"

+++
(“intention”) Important ritual sequence  
at the beginning of many religious rites  
in which the person performing the rite  
states his or her identity, the time and  
place at which the action is being performed, the performer’s intention to  
carry out this particular ritual act,  
and the benefits desired from the action.  
The samkalpa is important as the  
formal commitment to perform the  
stated action. For ritual actions that  
promise several different possible  
benefits—for example, **birth** in **heaven**  
or final liberation—performing the  
samkalpa is believed to give one the  
result one desires.
