Soma is one of the most enigmatic  
**deities** in the Hindu tradition. The 120  
hymns to soma in the **Rg Veda**, the oldest Hindu sacred text, variously describe  
soma as a plant, as the juice pressed  
from that plant, and as the deified form  
of both juice and plant. The Vedic  
hymns give detailed descriptions of how  
the sacrificial priests pressed it, strained  
and filtered it, and finally consumed it,  
which then brought visions upon them.  
These hymns portray soma as some sort  
of mind-altering substance, although  
there is no general agreement on what  
the soma plant might be. Its identity has  
been lost since late Vedic times, and  
since then various substitutes have been  
used in rituals.  
Although the hymns describe soma  
as hallucinogenic, one need not take  
this literally. One can explain such  
visions in purely psychological terms, as  
induced or fostered by the priests’  
heightened expectations in the sacrificial arena. If one assumes that soma was  
actually mind-altering, it could not have  
been an alcoholic beverage—since it  
was prepared and consumed on the  
same day, this would have given no time  
for fermentation. One theory is that  
soma was hashish (**charas**), which is still  
consumed in certain ritual contexts. The  
most intriguing theory was  
proposed by R. G. Wasson, who  
contended that soma was *Amonita muscaria*, a mind-altering mushroom that  
has a long history of use in Asian  
shamanic traditions. Although Wasson’s  
theory would explain soma’s ability to  
take immediate effect, many Indologists  
have taken issue with this claim. See  
Robert Gordon Wasson, *Soma*, 1971; for  
contrary remarks, see J. Brough, “Soma  
and Amonita Muscaria,” in *The Bulletin*  
*of the School of Oriental and African*  
*Studies,* Vol. 34, 1971.
