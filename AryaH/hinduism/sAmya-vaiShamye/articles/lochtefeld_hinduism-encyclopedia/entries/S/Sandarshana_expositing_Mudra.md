title = "Sandarshana (“expositing”) Mudra"

+++
In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual, a  
particular symbolic hand **gesture**  
(**mudra**), in which the tips of the thumb  
and index finger are touching, with the  
rest of the fingers extended and the  
palm facing the viewer. This is the hand  
gesture used to signify explanation or  
exposition, and for this reason it is also  
known as the **vyakhyana** (“teaching”)  
**mudra**. Since the teaching gesture indicates a person of higher spiritual attainment, it is also known as the chit (“consciousness”) mudra.
