title = "Sagar"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a celebrated king  
of the **Solar Line**. Sagar, the son of King  
Subahu and his wife Yadavi, gets his  
name because one of Yadavi’s co-wives  
has given her poison (gara) while she is  
pregnant with him. Sagar has a very  
hard early life. His father is driven from  
his kingdom even before he is born, and  
Sagar is raised at the **ashram** of the sage  
Aurva, where his mother has taken asylum. When he comes to maturity Sagar  
embarks on a series of military campaigns in which he wins back all the  
lands his father lost, and becomes a  
righteous and religious king whose only  
concern is his lack of progeny.  
To beget **sons**, Sagar calls on the sage  
**Bhrgu**, who gives Sagar’s two wives a  
choice: one wife will bear 60,000 sons  
who will all die childless, and one wife  
will bear one son who will carry on the  
line. Each of his wives chooses, and in  
due course both have their children—  
**Keshini** delivers her one son in the normal way, whereas **Sumati** delivers a  
lump of flesh that is divided and put into  
60,000 pots, each of which develops into  
a handsome son.  
In his prosperity King Sagar continues to sponsor religious rites, and is on  
the verge of completing his hundredth  
horse **sacrifice** (**asvamedha**), which will  
entitle him to the throne of **Indra**, the  
god who is the king of **heaven**. To forestall this, Indra steals the sacred horse  
and hides it in the ashram of the sage  
**Kapila**. Sagar sends his 60,000 sons  
to search for the horse, but they make  
the mistake of insulting the sage, who  
burns them all to ash through his  
yogic powers. To rescue their souls it  
is necessary to bring down the **Ganges**  
from heaven, a job that Sagar’s descendants diligently attempt to complete.  
After several generations of frustration,  
his great-great-grandson **Bhagirath** is  
finally successful.
