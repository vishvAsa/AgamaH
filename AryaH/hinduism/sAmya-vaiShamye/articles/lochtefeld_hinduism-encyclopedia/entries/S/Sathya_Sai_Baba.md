(b. Satya **Narayana** Peddi Venkappa  
Raju, 1926) Modern Hindu teacher and  
religious figure who presides as religious  
teacher (**guru**) over millions of devotees  
(**bhakta**), both Indian and foreign. He  
was born in the small village of  
**Puttaparthi** in the state of **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**, where his main **ashram** is still  
located. He first claimed to be an incarnation of **Shirdi Sai Baba**, a  
Maharashtrian saint, at thirteen—a  
move that gave him religious authority  
and obviated the need to accept a  
human guru and a spiritual lineage.  
Sathya Sai Baba has since stated that he  
will be reincarnated a third time, thus  
eliminating awkward questions about a  
successor. His fame rests upon his supposed **magic** powers, particularly the  
ability to heal and to materialize objects  
from thin air. Sai Baba has many middle- and upper-class Indian devotees,  
whom he obliges to perform service  
(**seva**) to others. Some observers are  
highly skeptical about his reputed powers and about Sai Baba in general. For
