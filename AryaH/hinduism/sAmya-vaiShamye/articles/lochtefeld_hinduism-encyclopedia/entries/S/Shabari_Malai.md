title = "Shabari Malai"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
hills of the southern state of **Kerala**,  
about seventy miles north of Trivandrum. Shabari Malai is renowned for the  
temple to **Aiyappa**, a regional divinity  
who has been assimilated into the larger  
pantheon as the son of the gods **Vishnu**  
and **Shiva**; he is born when Vishnu takes  
the form of the enchantress **Mohini**.  
Shabari Malaiâ€™s annual month-long pilgrimage occurs from the middle of  
December to the middle of January, with  
the exact dates determined by astrological calculations.

This pilgrimage is most often taken  
by men, since, according to the charter  
myth, the site is forbidden to **women**  
of childbearing age. The pilgrimage  
itself is a highly structured ritual  
process. Pilgrims carry out their spiritual training for the journey in welldefined village groups, each headed by  
a local leader, who supervises their  
strict religious discipline. Their  
preparatory vows commence forty-five  
to sixty days before the actual journey  
begins, and entail strict **celibacy** and  
avoiding the company of women, distinctive dress, a ban on **shaving** and  
wearing shoes, a strict vegetarian diet,  
daily **worship**, and the erasing of all  
social and status distinctions among  
members. In essence, the men training  
for this pilgrimage live as renunciant  
ascetics for this period and later revert  
to their normal identities. The pilgrimage itself is an arduous and exhausting  
journey over the twisted ridges of the  
Periyar Hills, during which pilgrims  
symbolically divest themselves of their  
egos, to be filled with the **grace** of God.
