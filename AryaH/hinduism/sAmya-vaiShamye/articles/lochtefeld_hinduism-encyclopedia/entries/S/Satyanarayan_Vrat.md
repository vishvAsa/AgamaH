title = "Satyanarayan Vrat"

+++
Religious observance that may be  
observed any day of the month but is  
most commonly performed on the day  
of the **full moon**. The presiding **deity** is  
**Vishnu**, worshiped in his form as  
Satyanarayan (“Lord of Truth”). The rite  
is believed to destroy evil and to promote the prosperity of its sponsors  
(those who hire a **brahmin** to perform  
the rite), its performers, and even its  
hearers. The rite’s major features involve  
modification of diet and **worship**, the  
two general characteristics of most  
Hindu religious observances. On the day  
this rite is performed, the observant  
must keep a strict fast (**upavasa**) until  
the ceremony is over. A pavilion is prepared in which an image of Satyanarayan is installed and worshiped (part  
of the worship includes reading the rite’s  
charter myth), and after which **prasad** is  
given to all those present.
