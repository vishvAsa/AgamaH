  <meta property="og:description" content="(788–820?) Writer and religious thinker
who is unquestionably the most significant figure in the Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school, and arguably the
single greatest Hindu religious figure.
Very little is known about his life—
even his dates are a matter of speculation—but popular tales abound.
According to one story, he was the god
Shiva incarnate, who descended to
earth to reveal the knowledge of the
absolute. This connection is shown by
his name—Shankara is one of the epithets of Shiva, and acharya (“teacher”)
is an honorific suffix. He is traditionally believed to have been born in a
Nambudiri brahmin family at Kaladi
in the state of Kerala, to have become
an ascetic at a very young age, and to
have traveled widely engaging in religious disputes, particularly with the
Buddhists, whose religious influence
he put in permanent decline. He is
believed to have established the ten
Dashanami Sanyasi orders and the
four maths that are their centers, to
have written commentaries on the
three texts central to the Vedanta
school—namely the Upanishads, the
Vedanta Sutras, and the Bhagavad
Gita—and to have gone finally to the
high Himalayas, where he died at the
age of 32.
Many of these claims cannot be substantiated, but the significance of his
work cannot be denied. His commentary on the Vedanta Sutras, the
Brahmasutra Bhashya, gives the classic
formulation of Advaita Vedanta, with its
emphasis that the Ultimate Reality is the
unqualified (nirguna) Brahman, which
is eternal and unchanging, and to which
the human soul is identical. The changing phenomenal world (the world we
see and sense) is an illusion, created
through the superimposition (adhyasa)
of mistaken ideas upon the unqualified
Brahman. Since Shankaracharya believes
that one is released from bondage by
replacing this mistaken understanding
with the correct one, insight and not
action is the means to liberation. This
moment of understanding can be
described as a flash of realization, but it
seems mistaken to characterize Shankaracharya as a mystic. This is because
he strongly emphasizes the authority
of the sacred texts as a source of accurate knowledge about the ultimate
truth. Although this stress on insight
devalues the ultimate worth of ritual
action, except in a preparatory role
by removing defilements, Shankaracharya also believed that required ritual
actions should be performed from a
sense of duty.
Shankaracharya is as philosophically
significant for his silence as for his
speech. He gives no definitive answer
on many philosophical issues: about
whether selves are one or many, about
whether the locus of ignorance (avidya)
was Brahman or the individual, about
the nature of ignorance itself, and about
the real nature of the material world. His
refusal to take a position on these issues
left many different routes open to those
who came after him. Shankaracharya
himself tended to emphasize epistemological issues—how human beings
come to know things, and particularly
how to correct the mistaken ideas
through which human beings are held
in bondage. The image that comes
through his writing is of a deeply religious man whose primary concern was
623
Shankaracharya
to help his hearers destroy their illusions
and gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Given this underlying goal
and his acute philosophical mind, one
can argue that he was aware of such
metaphysical questions but chose to
ignore them, since they were unrelated
to his primary goal. For further information on Shankaracharya’s thought, see
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957; and Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara

  <p>(788–820?) Writer and religious thinker<br>
who is unquestionably the most significant figure in the <strong>Advaita Vedanta</strong><br>
philosophical school, and arguably the<br>
single greatest Hindu religious figure.<br>
Very little is known about his life—<br>
even his dates are a matter of speculation—but popular tales abound.<br>
According to one story, he was the god<br>
<strong>Shiva</strong> incarnate, who descended to<br>
earth to reveal the knowledge of the<br>
absolute. This connection is shown by<br>
his name—<strong>Shankara</strong> is one of the epithets of Shiva, and <strong>acharya</strong> (“teacher”)<br>
is an honorific suffix. He is traditionally believed to have been born in a<br>
<strong>Nambudiri brahmin</strong> family at Kaladi<br>
in the state of <strong>Kerala</strong>, to have become<br>
an <strong>ascetic</strong> at a very young age, and to<br>
have traveled widely engaging in religious disputes, particularly with the<br>
Buddhists, whose religious influence<br>
he put in permanent decline. He is<br>
believed to have established the ten<br>
<strong>Dashanami Sanyasi</strong> orders and the<br>
four <strong>maths</strong> that are their centers, to<br>
have written commentaries on the<br>
three texts central to the Vedanta<br>
school—namely the <strong>Upanishads</strong>, the<br>
<strong>Vedanta Sutras</strong>, and the <strong>Bhagavad</strong><br>
<strong>Gita</strong>—and to have gone finally to the<br>
high <strong>Himalayas</strong>, where he died at the<br>
age of 32.<br>
Many of these claims cannot be substantiated, but the significance of his<br>
work cannot be denied. His commentary on the <em>Vedanta Sutra</em>s, the<br>
<strong>Brahmasutra Bhashya</strong>, gives the classic<br>
formulation of Advaita Vedanta, with its<br>
emphasis that the Ultimate Reality is the<br>
unqualified (<strong>nirguna</strong>) <strong>Brahman</strong>, which<br>
is eternal and unchanging, and to which<br>
the human soul is identical. The changing phenomenal world (the world we<br>
see and sense) is an illusion, created<br>
through the superimposition (<strong>adhyasa</strong>)<br>
of mistaken ideas upon the unqualified<br>
Brahman. Since Shankaracharya believes<br>
that one is released from bondage by<br>
replacing this mistaken understanding<br>
with the correct one, insight and not<br>
action is the means to liberation. This<br>
moment of understanding can be<br>
described as a flash of realization, but it<br>
seems mistaken to characterize Shankaracharya as a mystic. This is because<br>
he strongly emphasizes the authority<br>
of the sacred texts as a source of accurate knowledge about the ultimate<br>
truth. Although this stress on insight<br>
devalues the ultimate worth of ritual<br>
action, except in a preparatory role<br>
by removing defilements, Shankaracharya also believed that required ritual<br>
actions should be performed from a<br>
sense of duty.<br>
Shankaracharya is as philosophically<br>
significant for his silence as for his<br>
speech. He gives no definitive answer<br>
on many philosophical issues: about<br>
whether selves are one or many, about<br>
whether the locus of ignorance (<strong>avidya</strong>)<br>
was Brahman or the individual, about<br>
the nature of ignorance itself, and about<br>
the real nature of the material world. His<br>
refusal to take a position on these issues<br>
left many different routes open to those<br>
who came after him. Shankaracharya<br>
himself tended to emphasize epistemological issues—how human beings<br>
come to know things, and particularly<br>
how to correct the mistaken ideas<br>
through which human beings are held<br>
in bondage. The image that comes<br>
through his writing is of a deeply religious man whose primary concern was<br>
623<br>
Shankaracharya<br>
to help his hearers destroy their illusions<br>
and gain final liberation of the soul<br>
(<strong>moksha</strong>). Given this underlying goal<br>
and his acute philosophical mind, one<br>
can argue that he was aware of such<br>
metaphysical questions but chose to<br>

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles<br>
A. Moore (eds.), <em>A Sourcebook in Indian</em><br>
<em>Philosophy</em>, 1957; and Karl H. Potter<br>
(ed.), <em>Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara</em><br>
<em>and His Pupils</em>, 1981.</p>
