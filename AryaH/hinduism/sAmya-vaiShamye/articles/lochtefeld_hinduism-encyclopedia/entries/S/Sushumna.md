title = "Sushumna"

+++
One of the vertical channels (**nadi**) in  
the traditional conceptions of the **subtle**  
**body**. The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system believed to exist on  
a different plane than gross matter but  
with certain correspondences to the  
material body. It is visualized as a set of  
six psychic centers (**chakras**) running  
roughly along the course of the spine,  
connected by three parallel vertical  
channels. Above and below these centers are the bodily abodes of the two  
divine principles, **Shiva** (awareness) and  
**Shakti** (power)—the latter as the latent  
spiritual energy known as **kundalini**—  
conceived in the form of a coiled serpent. In the types of **yoga** that focus on  
the subtle body, the ultimate aim is to  
awaken the kundalini, and move it up  
through the chakras to the abode of  
Shiva. The union of Shiva and Shakti in  
the aspirant’s body mirrors the action  
of these divine forces in the macrocosm, and with this union the aspirant  
gains bliss and final liberation of the  
soul (**moksha**).  
The sushumna is the middle of the  
three vertical channels in the subtle  
body—the side channels are the **ida**  
**nadi** and the **pingala nadi**—and it is by  
far the most important of the three. The  
sushumna provides the pathway for the  
rising kundalini as it awakens and  
straightens during the aspirant’s spiritual exercises, piercing through the  
chakras on its way. In most people the  
675  
Sushumna  
sushumna is closed where it intersects  
the chakras, which blocks the flow of  
energy from moving smoothly through  
it. When the chakras have been pierced  
and opened by the rising kundalini, the  
passageway has been opened for the  
kundalini to rise to the abode of Shiva,  
and effect the union of Shakti and Shiva  
that will bring ultimate realization. For
