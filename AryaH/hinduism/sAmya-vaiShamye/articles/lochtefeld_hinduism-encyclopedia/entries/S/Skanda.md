title = "Skanda"

+++
Hindu **deity** who is the son of the god  
**Shiva**. Skanda is born to destroy the  
**demon Taraka**, who has received the  
divine boon that he can only be killed by  
a son of Shiva. When Taraka makes this  
request, Shiva is deep in meditation in  
his grief after the death of his wife **Sati**,  
and it seems unlikely that such a son can  
ever be born. After Taraka grows too  
strong, the other gods begin the process  
of trying to encourage Shiva to marry,  
which results in his wedding with the  
**goddess Parvati**.  
Despite the marriage of Shiva and  
Parvati, Skanda is born in an unusual  
way. According to the legend, Shiva and  
Parvati are disturbed while making love,  
and Shiva inadvertently spills his **semen**  
on the ground (the verb *skand* means  
“to leap” or “to ooze”). In Indian culture  
semen is seen as a man’s concentrated  
essence, and for a deity like Shiva this  
means that the semen is inordinately  
powerful, capable of destroying the  
**earth**. The semen is first held by the god  
**Agni**, who is fire personified, but it  
proves too powerful for him. Agni then  
puts it in the River **Ganges**, and after  
10,000 years the river deposits a shining  
child in the reeds by its bank. The child  
is discovered by the **Krittikas** (the  
Pleiades personified), each of whom  
want to nurse him. To oblige them  
Skanda grows five extra heads. As a  
mark of the Krittikas’ care, one of his  
epithets is Kartikkeya. Skanda grows  
rapidly, assumes command of Shiva’s  
heavenly host (**gana**), and kills the  
troublesome Taraka. His persona  
remains that of a warrior prince, unlike  
that of his brother **Ganesh**, who is a  
scholar and sage.

Skanda  
Skanda, the god Shiva’s son. Skanda is a warrior  
prince, born to defeat the demon Taraka.  
In northern India Skanda is considered a member of Shiva’s household,  
and although his power is acknowledged, he is generally not a primary  
object of **worship**. In southern India  
Skanda has been identified with  
**Murugan**, a regional deity associated  
primarily with the hunt, but also with  
war. In this atmosphere he has taken on  
a much greater role, particularly in  
**Tamil Nadu**, and has assumed the mantle of a philosopher and exponent of the  
**Shaiva Siddhanta** school.
