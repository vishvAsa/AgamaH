title = "Samavartana (“return”) Samskara"

+++
The fourteenth of the life-cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**), which marks the  
end of a young man’s life as a celibate  
student (**brahmacharin**) and the return  
to his parental home. The most important element in this rite is a bath, after  
which the young man changes into new  
clothes, marking his change in status.  
The young man is supposed to ask his  
**guru’s** permission before performing  
the ceremony, and gives him his  
teacher’s fee (**dakshina**), both as payment for services rendered and as a sign  
of respect. Shortly after his return to his  
natal home, the young man usually  
gets married. In modern times this  
rite is not often observed, due to the  
decline of the traditional paradigm  
of the brahmacharin **stage of life**,  
although sometimes it is performed in  
preparation for a marriage.
