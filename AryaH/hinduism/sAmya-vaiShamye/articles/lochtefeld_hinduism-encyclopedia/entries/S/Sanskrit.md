(“perfected”) For much of Indian history,  
Sanskrit was the language of the cultural  
and religious elite. Even in the twentieth  
century, it is still the language with the  
highest religious status. Its name reflects  
the religious conviction that it was the  
perfect language—the language of the  
gods. Sanskrit was essentially fixed in the  
fourth century B.C.E. by the **grammarian**  
**Panini** in his **Ashtadhyayi**. Since it has  
not changed from Panini’s time, Sanskrit  
is no longer considered a “natural”  
language. Even in Panini’s time, Sanskrit  
would have been a person’s second  
language, learned by conscious study  
after acquiring a grammatically simpler  
mother tongue (one of the **Prakrits**)  
595  
Sanskrit  
through the normal process of language  
learning. In a religious context Sanskrit  
has primarily been the province of  
**brahmins**, serving both as a sacred  
language and a common language  
through which the brahmins from various areas could communicate with each  
other. Its place of pride as the religious  
language *par excellence* has been somewhat undercut by the influence of the  
devotional (**bhakti**) religious movement.  
One of this movement’s pervasive features was poetry composed in vernacular  
languages, which reflected the conscious  
choice to speak in a language that everyone could understand.
