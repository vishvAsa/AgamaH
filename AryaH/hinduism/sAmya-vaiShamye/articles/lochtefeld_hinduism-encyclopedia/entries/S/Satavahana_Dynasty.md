Central Indian dynasty whose core area  
was in the **Deccan** plateau in the western state of **Maharashtra**, and whose  
capital was in the city of **Paithan**. The  
Satavahana dynasty was at its peak from  
the first to the third centuries, when it  
ruled an area spanning the modern  
604  
Sarvadarshanasangraha  
states of **Gujarat**, **Madhya Pradesh**,  
Maharashtra, **Karnataka**, and **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**. It was in the Satavahana  
domains that the first cave temples were  
constructed in the **chaitya** and **vihara**  
architectural styles, which paved the  
way for later architectural forms.
