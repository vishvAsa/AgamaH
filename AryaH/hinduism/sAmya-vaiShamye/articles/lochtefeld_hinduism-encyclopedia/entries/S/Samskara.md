title = "Samskara"

+++
(“making perfect”) Collective name for  
the various life-cycle ceremonies in  
Hindu society. Although status in Indian  
society depends most on one’s **birth**,  
this alone is not sufficient to become a  
complete and finished person. In an  
individual’s development, the raw material given by nature must be refined  
through the process of culture, or the

Samskara  
The chudakarana samskara, in which a child’s head is shaved as a rite of purification.  
action of samskaras. This process of  
transformation begins before birth,  
with the three **prenatal** samskaras, and  
continues to death with the **antyeshthi**  
samskaras. In general, samskaras transform people in two ways: by removing  
latent or residual impurities, such as the  
childhood **chudakarana samskara**, or  
by generating new capacities and entitlements, such as the **upanayana** (**initiation**) and **vivaha** (marriage) **samskaras**.  
Although different writers in the **dharma literature** disagree on the number of  
samskaras, traditionally, sixteen are  
accepted. Three were prenatal samskaras:  
one to ensure conception (**Garbhadhana**),  
one to ensure the birth of a boy  
(**Pumsavana**), and one to ensure an easy  
delivery and a healthy child (**Simantonnayana**). Six samskaras were associated with childhood: ritual actions immediately after birth (**Jatakarma**), name-giving  
(**Namakarana**), the first outing (**Nishkramana**), the first solid food (**Annaprashana**), head-**shaving** (**Chudakarana**),  
and piercing of the ears (**Karnavedha**).  
Five samskaras were connected with life as  
a celibate student (**brahmacharin**): beginning of learning (**Vidyarambha**), adolescent religious initiation (**Upanayana**), the  
beginning of **Veda** study (**Vedarambha**),  
the first shave (**Keshanta**), and the return  
home at the conclusion of studies (**Samavartana**). The final two samskaras were  
marriage, and the last rites for the dead  
(**antyeshthi samskara**).  
These sixteen samskaras were the  
rites for a **twice-born** man, whom this  
literature considered the default person.  
A twice-born man was one born into  
one of the three “twice-born” **varnas**—  
**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya**—who  
were ritually eligible for the adolescent  
religious initiation known as the “second birth.” **Women** in the twice-born  
groups would undergo all the rites  
through the **childhood rites**, but would  
have no further rites until marriage,  
which was considered equal to all samskaras for them. People born outside the  
twice-born groups—namely, **shudras**  
and **untouchables**—would perform few  
if any of these rites.  
These life cycle rites drive and govern the formation of the individual. In  
modern times many of these samskaras are still performed, but mainly  
by brahmins who, because of their traditional role as priests and scholars,  
conserve this practice to help maintain their traditional prestige. For further information see Pandurang  
Vaman Kane, *A History of Dharmasastra*, 1968; and Raj Bali Pandey,  
*Hindu Samskaras*, 1969. The former is  
encyclopedic and the latter more  
accessible; despite their age, they  
remain the best sources about traditional Hindu rites.
