In Hindu mythology, a disciple of the  
sage **Vyasa**, who is said to have recounted  
the **puranas** to other renunciants in the  
**Naimisha** forest. The puranas are an  
important genre of religious texts that  
collect all types of sacred lore, from  
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exaltation of various sacred sites (**tirthas**)  
and actions. Individual puranas are usually highly sectarian and intended to  
promote the **worship** of one of the  
Hindu gods, whether **Vishnu**, **Shiva**, or  
the **Goddess**. The traditional puranas  
are numbered at eighteen, and in  
many of them Suta is named as the  
narrator, in accordance with the legend  
mentioned above.
