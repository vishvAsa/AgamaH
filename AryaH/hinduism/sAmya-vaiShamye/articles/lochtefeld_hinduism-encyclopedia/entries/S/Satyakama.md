(“He whose desire is truth”) Legendary  
figure in the early speculative text  
**Chandogya Upanishad**, renowned for  
his adherence to the truth. Desiring to  
take **initiation** as a celibate student  
(**brahmacharin**), Satyakama asks his  
mother about his extended family, so  
that he can have this information to give  
his teacher. His mother Jabala replies  
that she does not know who his father is  
and tells him to take her name, and call  
himself Satyakama Jabala. Satyakama,  
when asked by his teacher **Gautama** to  
tell about his family roots, tells the  
whole story. Impressed by his honesty,  
Gautama initiates him at once. This  
story is often cited in modern times, to  
emphasize the importance of one’s  
actions over one’s **birth**.
