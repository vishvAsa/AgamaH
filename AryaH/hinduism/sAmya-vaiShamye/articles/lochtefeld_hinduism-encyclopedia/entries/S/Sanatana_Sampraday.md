Another name for the **Nimbarki** religious community. The philosopher  
**Nimbarka** was the community’s historical founder, but, according to the  
Nimbarkis, the actual founder was the  
god **Vishnu** himself. One of Vishnu’s disciples was named **Sanatana** (“eternal”),  
hence the name of the **sampraday**.
