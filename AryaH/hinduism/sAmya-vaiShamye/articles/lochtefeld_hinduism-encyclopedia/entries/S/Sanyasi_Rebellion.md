title = "Sanyasi Rebellion"

+++
Name given by the British to a long-term  
struggle in the Bengal region in the latter  
half of the eighteenth century. This was  
the period in which the British East  
India Company was consolidating its  
economic, political, and military control  
over the region, causing wide-ranging  
dislocations in traditional Bengali society. Among the entrenched powers with  
which the British clashed were organized bands of soldier-ascetics, both  
Hindus and Muslims. These soldierascetics were significant local forces,  
with both military and economic power  
gained through mercenary services,  
trading, and money-lending, and they  
competed with the British East India  
Company for political authority and  
land revenue.  
Conflict between the British and the  
ascetics peaked shortly after the Bengal  
famine of 1770–1771. The rebellion was  
caused partly by competition for greatly  
598  
Santoshi Ma Vrat  
reduced agricultural revenue and by  
British-sponsored changes in land ownership patterns, in which officials in the  
East India Company replaced many of  
the “unprofitable” traditional landowners  
with their own Company employees.  
Many of the traditional landowners  
owed money to **ascetic** moneylenders  
(Sanyasis), and had pledged their land  
revenue as security. The Sanyasis were  
upset when the landowners were  
replaced and the debts not honored. For  
their part, the Company’s officials were  
reluctant to allow the ascetics, who traveled in heavily armed bands, to pass  
through the company’s territories while  
on religious pilgrimage, as the ascetics  
had traditionally done. Ultimately  
the ascetic attacks were disorganized  
and local, and the disparate **Sanyasi**  
bands were unable to withstand  
British resources and organization. A  
fictionalized account of the Sanyasi  
Rebellion appeared in the novel  
**Anandamath**, by **Bankim Chandra**  
**Chatterjee** (1838–1894), who used the  
Sanyasi Rebellion as a coded call for  
resistance to contemporary British rule.
