(“[one who has] bathed”) In the **dharma**  
**literature**, this is the name for a  
young man who had performed the  
**samavartana samskara**, the life-cycle  
ceremony that marks the end of  
his **stage of life** as a celibate student  
(**brahmacharin**) and return to his  
parental home. The most important element in the rite was a bath, after which  
he changed into new clothes, marking  
his change in status. Before doing this  
he was supposed to ask his **guru’s** permission, and also to give him his  
teacher’s fee (**dakshina**), both as payment for services rendered and as a sign  
of respect. A young man who had performed this rite would be eligible to get  
married, and the literature prescribes  
that this should follow in short order.
