Traditional Indian society was modeled  
as a collection of **endogamous**, or  
intermarried, subgroups known as **jatis**  
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their  
social status determined) by the group’s  
hereditary occupation, over which each  
group has a monopoly. This sort of differentiation applied even to **brahmins**,  
whose role has been to serve as priests,  
scholars, and teachers. The Saraswats  
are a brahmin jati counted as one of the  
five northern Indian brahmin communities (**Pancha Gauda**); the other four  
are the **Gaudas**, the **Kanaujias**, the  
**Maithilas**, and the **Utkalas**. Unlike most  
other brahmin communities, which had  
a well-defined core region, the Saraswats  
are found in several widely separated  
locations. One group lived in the  
coastal region of Sindh in modern  
Pakistan, although after Partition in  
1947 most of the group migrated to  
Bombay. Another group was located in  
prepartition **Punjab**, although here too  
they have tended to migrate away from  
the part of Punjab in modern Pakistan.  
A third branch, known as the Gauda  
Saraswats, is found on a narrow strip of  
coastline in the southern Indian state  
of **Karnataka**. The Saraswat community takes its name from **Saraswati**,  
patron **goddess** of speech and learning,  
and, as a group, is famous for its erudition and piety.
