title = "Saraswati River"

+++
One of the seven sacred rivers of India,  
along with the **Ganges**, **Yamuna**,  
**Godavari**, **Narmada**, **Indus**, and  
**Cauvery**. The Saraswati is particularly  
interesting because no one is sure exactly  
where this river is located. A river by this  
name is mentioned in the hymns of the  
**Vedas**, the earliest and most authoritative Hindu religious texts, and thus the  
Saraswati River would seem to have  
been in the northeastern part of India,  
in which these hymns are set. In modern  
times a Saraswati River flows through  
the northern Indian state of **Haryana**  
and dries up in the desert of the state of  
**Rajasthan**. Archaeologists have found  
extensive settlements from the **Indus**  
**Valley civilization** on its banks, indicating that in earlier times the river was an  
active tributary of the Indus. Popular  
belief holds that the Saraswati continues  
to flow underground, and joins the  
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers at their confluence in **Allahabad**. This reputed confluence of three sacred rivers is the  
source for one of the site’s names,  
**Triveni** (“triple stream”).
