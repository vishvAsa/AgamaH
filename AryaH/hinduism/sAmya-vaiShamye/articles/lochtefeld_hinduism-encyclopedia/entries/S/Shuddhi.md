(“purification”) Any ritual purification  
that removes impurities and thus  
returns one to a state of ritual **purity**.  
In a more specialized context the  
term denotes the “reconversion” back  
to Hinduism of people who had  
either converted to another religion  
or who had adopted practices  
characteristic of other religious traditions. This practice was first instituted  
in the 1890s by the reformist **Arya**  
**Samaj**, led by **Swami Dayanand**  
**Saraswati**. There was a tremendous  
stir in the Sikh community when several  
Sikhs were a part of a group thus  
“purified,” and in Sikh accounts  
this threat of reabsorption  
into the Hindu community was one  
of the major forces behind the Singh  
Sabha movement, which defined  
the Sikhs as a separate religious community. In modern times this practice has  
been employed by the Hindu nationalist  
organization **Vishva Hindu Parishad**,  
which has used it to “purify” certain  
groups who had adopted some  
Islamic practices.
