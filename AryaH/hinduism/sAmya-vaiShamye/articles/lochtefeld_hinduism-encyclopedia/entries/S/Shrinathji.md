title = "Shrinathji"

+++
The name of a particular image of the  
god **Krishna**, the presiding **deity** of the  
Shrinathji temple in **Nathdwara**,  
**Rajasthan**. According to tradition, the  
image was originally hidden on top of  
Mount **Govardhan**, a famous mountain  
in the **Braj** region that is mythically  
associated with Krishna’s humiliation of  
the storm-god **Indra**. The image’s location was revealed in a **dream** to  
**Vallabhacharya**, the founder of the religious community known as the **Pushti**  
**Marg**. Vallabhacharya built a temple to  
house the image on Mount Govardhan,  
and his descendants have remained  
Shrinathji’s hereditary servants since  
that time. The image was taken to  
Rajasthan in 1669, a move prompted by  
fears that it would be destroyed by the  
Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb**. According  
641  
Shrinathji  
to tradition Shrinathji revealed his  
wish to stay in Nathdwara by sinking  
his wagon’s wheels deep into the earth,  
so that it could not go further. A new  
temple was erected and dedicated in  
1672, and the image has remained there  
ever since.  
Whether or not one accepts the claim  
of the divine mandate, much of the story  
seems reasonable. Given the proximity  
of Braj to Agra, the Moghul capital,  
keepers of well-known images might  
have been concerned about their safety,  
and since the neighboring state of  
Rajasthan was controlled by the  
Moghuls’ Hindu vassals, this would have  
been an obvious place to go. Even today  
Nathdwara is in a remote and thinly settled region of Rajasthan, which indicates  
that in earlier times it would have been a  
place of refuge. The Nathdwara temple  
is particularly important to the Pushti  
Marg, a religious community devoted  
to the god Krishna, who play the major  
role in administering it. For more
