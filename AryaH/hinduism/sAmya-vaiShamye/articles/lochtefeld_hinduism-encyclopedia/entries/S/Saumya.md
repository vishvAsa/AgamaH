(“mild”) Term used to refer to the  
**deities** in their benevolent, beneficent,  
and gentle manifestations, as opposed  
to their terrifying (**ghora**) manifestations. This distinction is particularly  
applicable to **Shiva** and the **Goddess**,  
both of whom can appear in either  
form and whose **worship** can focus on  
either aspect.
