title = "Sayana"

+++
(14th c.) A southern Indian **brahmin**  
scholar most famous for his commentaries on the **Vedas**, the oldest and most  
authoritative Hindu religious texts.  
Sayana’s commentary is notable, in part  
because it is an outstanding scholarly  
work, but also because this is generally  
believed to be the first time that the Veda  
was ever written down, an estimated  
three thousand years after some of the  
hymns were composed. Part of Sayana’s  
commentary was simply explanatory  
because, in the time since the Vedas had  
been composed, the meanings of many  
of the words had been forgotten.  
Sayana’s text is noted as a careful and  
credible clarification of the text.
