title = "Sadhya"

+++
(“to be proved”) Element in the accepted form of an inference (**anumana**) in  
Indian **philosophy**. An acceptable inference has three terms: an assertion  
(**pratijna**), a reason (**hetu**), and examples (**drshtanta**); each of these three has  
its own constituent parts. The sadhya is,  
along with the **paksha**, one of the two  
parts of the assertion. The paksha is the  
subject of the hypothesis and names a  
class of things, while the sadhya contains the claim to be proven about that  
class. In the standard example, in which  
the hypothesis is “this mountain is on  
fire,” the paksha is “this mountain” (the  
class of things about which a claim is  
being made); and the sadhya, or thing to  
be proven, is “is on fire.”
