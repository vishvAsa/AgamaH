  <meta property="og:description" content="(auspicious) Along with the god Vishnu
and the Goddess, one of the three most
important deities in the Hindu pantheon. All three are notable for being virtually absent from the Vedas, and their
collective rise to dominance (and the
gradual eclipse of the original Vedic
gods) points clearly to a definitive
change in the Hindu tradition. Of the
three, Shiva is not mentioned at all
in the Veda. He is identified with the
god Rudra, who first appears in a few of
the late Vedic hymns and who is later
identified in the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad as the single supreme deity
behind all things. The word Shiva
(“auspicious”) first appears in this
upanishad, but as an adjective modifying the feminine noun body.
Despite Rudra/Shiva’s appearance in
the upanishad as a supreme divinity, his
position is not clear-cut. He is described
as a master of archery who dwells in the
mountains (and thus away from human
beings) and is implored not to use his
arrows to harm either man or beast. It is
certain that Rudra/Shiva is not a Vedic
deity, and some have claimed that his
roots lie in the ancient urban-cultural
center known as the Indus Valley civilization, citing as evidence one of the
seals found in Harappa, an ancient city
of Pakistan, which shows a horned figure sitting cross-legged as if in meditation. This identification is possible but
hardly compelling. A more likely possibility is that he entered the pantheon as
a god worshiped by ascetics, who have
always been associated with mountain
dwellings. His connection with ascetics
is reinforced by several ascetic characteristics attributed to Shiva, such as the
matted locks and ash-smeared body.
Ascetic origins would also account for
his marginal status among the gods,
since this would have rendered him an
“outsider” to Vedic sacrificial cult, which
was the “established” religion of the
time. Shiva’s dramatic entry into the
pantheon comes in the story of the
death of his wife Sati. In this story, his

father-in-law Daksha’s insulting remarks—
that Shiva was an ascetic with no money,
job, or family, and was unfit to join
respectable society—finally resulted in
the destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice as a
sign of Shiva’s supremacy.
Shiva has retained this ambivalent,
sometimes marginal quality in his
iconography, his mythology, and his
character. Perhaps his most basic and
important characteristic is that he is a
divinity whose nature allows him to
move beyond the opposing forces (or
dualities) within himself and the world
by being at all times the possibility of
both forces at once. Shiva can represent
both the wild and dangerous side of life
and the respectable and refined side. On
the one hand, he is the typical ascetic,
with matted hair, ash-smeared body,
and a home on Mount Kailas in the
remote Himalayas. On the other hand,
he is Hindu society’s ideal for the good
husband, who dotes upon his wife
Parvati. His body is adorned with
snakes and clothed with a bloody elephant skin, but he also wears the
Ganges River and the crescent moon,
which are associated with beauty, purity,
and auspiciousness. His mythic deeds
stress his overwhelming power, against
which no enemy can stand, and his sudden and sometimes impetuous temper,
seen best in the destruction of Kama,
the god of love; yet this sudden violence
contrasts with his grace and favor
toward his devotees (bhakta), by whom
he is given the name “quickly satisfied”
(Ashutosh) and to whom he will give
almost everything. Although he is portrayed as simple and without deceit (as
Bholanath, the “simple lord”), he is also
traditionally described as the expositor
of the tantras, the most secret and
hidden religious practice of all. This
transcendence of all opposites can be
seen in the images that commonly
represent him: in his form as Nataraja,
in which many of these contrary attributes are shown, or as Ardhanarishvara,
in which the image is half male and half
female. This transcendence of duality
is also visible in the linga, the
pillar-shaped object that is his symbolic
form, whose base and shaft are interpreted as symbolizing male and female
reproductive organs. Finally, one can
see this transcendence in the tantric
conception of the subtle body (the
system of psychic centers, or chakras,
that run throughout the human body),
in which religious practice aims for the
union of Shiva and Shakti. As Wendy
Doniger O’Flaherty points out, through
his actions Shiva embodies all the
contradictory possibilities for human
experience, and in mythic form provides
a resolution that one ordinary human
life can never provide.
In medieval times Shiva’s devotees
developed a doctrine of avatars (incarnations of Shiva who take the form of a
variety of saints, sages, and minor
deities who appear on earth to restore
balance and perform other necessary
acts), probably in response to the older
and better developed notion of avatars
of Vishnu. Unlike Vishnu’s avatars,
Shiva’s do not seem to have been a way
to create a place for smaller existing
deities in the larger pantheon. Of Shiva’s
twenty-one avatars, the most important
one is Hanuman, who is the only one
with a well-established independent
cult. The others were sages (such as
Durvasas) and important beings, but
the worship of Shiva’s avatars has never
upstaged the worship of Shiva himself,
as has often happened with Vishnu. For

Shiva, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty

  <p>(auspicious) Along with the god <strong>Vishnu</strong><br>
and the <strong>Goddess</strong>, one of the three most<br>
important <strong>deities</strong> in the Hindu pantheon. All three are notable for being virtually absent from the Vedas, and their<br>
collective rise to dominance (and the<br>
gradual eclipse of the original Vedic<br>
gods) points clearly to a definitive<br>
change in the Hindu tradition. Of the<br>
three, Shiva is not mentioned at all<br>
in the <strong>Veda</strong>. He is identified with the<br>
god <strong>Rudra</strong>, who first appears in a few of<br>
the late Vedic hymns and who is later<br>
identified in the <strong>Shvetashvatara</strong><br>
<strong>Upanishad</strong> as the single supreme deity<br>
behind all things. The word <em>Shiva</em><br>
(“auspicious”) first appears in this<br>
upanishad, but as an adjective modifying the feminine noun <em>body</em>.<br>
Despite Rudra/Shiva’s appearance in<br>
the upanishad as a supreme divinity, his<br>
position is not clear-cut. He is described<br>
as a master of archery who dwells in the<br>
mountains (and thus away from human<br>
beings) and is implored not to use his<br>
arrows to harm either man or beast. It is<br>
certain that Rudra/Shiva is not a Vedic<br>
deity, and some have claimed that his<br>
roots lie in the ancient urban-cultural<br>
center known as the <strong>Indus Valley civilization</strong>, citing as evidence one of the<br>
seals found in <strong>Harappa</strong>, an ancient city<br>
of Pakistan, which shows a horned figure sitting cross-legged as if in meditation. This identification is possible but<br>
hardly compelling. A more likely possibility is that he entered the pantheon as<br>
a god worshiped by <strong>ascetics</strong>, who have<br>
always been associated with mountain<br>
dwellings. His connection with ascetics<br>
is reinforced by several ascetic characteristics attributed to Shiva, such as the<br>
matted locks and ash-smeared body.<br>
Ascetic origins would also account for<br>
his marginal status among the gods,<br>
since this would have rendered him an<br>
“outsider” to Vedic sacrificial cult, which<br>
was the “established” religion of the<br>
time. Shiva’s dramatic entry into the<br>
pantheon comes in the story of the<br>
death of his wife <strong>Sati</strong>. In this story, his<br>
633<br>
Shiva<br>
634<br>
Shiva<br>
Statue of the god Shiva from the Kumbha Mela festival in Allahabad. Living outside of society with his hair<br>
in matted locks and his body smeared with ash, Shiva is often regarded as the model for the Hindu ascetic.<br>
father-in-law <strong>Daksha’s</strong> insulting remarks—<br>
that Shiva was an ascetic with no money,<br>
job, or family, and was unfit to join<br>
respectable society—finally resulted in<br>
the destruction of Daksha’s <strong>sacrifice</strong> as a<br>
sign of Shiva’s supremacy.<br>
Shiva has retained this ambivalent,<br>
sometimes marginal quality in his<br>
iconography, his mythology, and his<br>
character. Perhaps his most basic and<br>
important characteristic is that he is a<br>
divinity whose nature allows him to<br>
move beyond the opposing forces (or<br>
dualities) within himself and the world<br>
by being at all times the possibility of<br>
both forces at once. Shiva can represent<br>
both the wild and dangerous side of life<br>
and the respectable and refined side. On<br>
the one hand, he is the typical ascetic,<br>
with matted hair, ash-smeared body,<br>
and a home on Mount <strong>Kailas</strong> in the<br>
remote <strong>Himalayas</strong>. On the other hand,<br>
he is Hindu society’s ideal for the good<br>
husband, who dotes upon his wife<br>
<strong>Parvati</strong>. His body is adorned with<br>
snakes and clothed with a bloody <strong>elephant</strong> skin, but he also wears the<br>
<strong>Ganges</strong> River and the crescent <strong>moon</strong>,<br>
which are associated with beauty, <strong>purity</strong>,<br>
and <strong>auspiciousness</strong>. His mythic deeds<br>
stress his overwhelming power, against<br>
which no enemy can stand, and his sudden and sometimes impetuous temper,<br>
seen best in the destruction of <strong>Kama</strong>,<br>
the god of love; yet this sudden violence<br>
contrasts with his <strong>grace</strong> and favor<br>
toward his devotees (<strong>bhakta</strong>), by whom<br>
he is given the name “quickly satisfied”<br>
(Ashutosh) and to whom he will give<br>
almost everything. Although he is portrayed as simple and without deceit (as<br>
<strong>Bholanath</strong>, the “simple lord”), he is also<br>
traditionally described as the expositor<br>
of the <strong>tantras</strong>, the most secret and<br>
hidden religious practice of all. This<br>
transcendence of all opposites can be<br>
seen in the images that commonly<br>
represent him: in his form as <strong>Nataraja</strong>,<br>
in which many of these contrary attributes are shown, or as <strong>Ardhanarishvara</strong>,<br>
in which the image is half male and half<br>
female. This transcendence of duality<br>
is also visible in the <strong>linga</strong>, the<br>
pillar-shaped object that is his symbolic<br>
form, whose base and shaft are interpreted as symbolizing male and female<br>
reproductive organs. Finally, one can<br>
see this transcendence in the tantric<br>
conception of the <strong>subtle body</strong> (the<br>
system of psychic centers, or <strong>chakras</strong>,<br>
that run throughout the human body),<br>
in which religious practice aims for the<br>
union of Shiva and <strong>Shakti</strong>. As Wendy<br>
Doniger O’Flaherty points out, through<br>
his actions Shiva embodies all the<br>
contradictory possibilities for human<br>
experience, and in mythic form provides<br>
a resolution that one ordinary human<br>
life can never provide.<br>
In medieval times Shiva’s devotees<br>
developed a doctrine of <strong>avatars</strong> (incarnations of Shiva who take the form of a<br>
variety of saints, sages, and minor<br>
deities who appear on earth to restore<br>
balance and perform other necessary<br>
acts), probably in response to the older<br>
and better developed notion of avatars<br>
of Vishnu. Unlike Vishnu’s avatars,<br>
Shiva’s do not seem to have been a way<br>
to create a place for smaller existing<br>
deities in the larger pantheon. Of Shiva’s<br>
twenty-one avatars, the most important<br>
one is <strong>Hanuman</strong>, who is the only one<br>
with a well-established independent<br>
cult. The others were sages (such as<br>
<strong>Durvasas</strong>) and important beings, but<br>
the worship of Shiva’s avatars has never<br>
upstaged the worship of Shiva himself,<br>
as has often happened with Vishnu. For<br>
further information on the mythology of<br>
Shiva, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty<br>
<em>Shiva</em>, 1981; and Stella Kramrisch, <em>The</em><br>
<em>Presence of Shiva</em>, 1981. See also <strong>Shaiva</strong>.</p>
