title = "Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar"

+++
(1883–1966) Hindu nationalist leader  
and thinker whose ideas have had lasting influence. Savarkar spent his entire  
life opposing British rule, often by violent  
means. He was also virulently opposed to  
Muslims, whom he saw as invaders and  
intruders in the Indian homeland. After  
being expelled from college for organizing  
a political rally, he spent four years in  
London, where he and his compatriots  
learned bomb-making and planned  
political assassinations. In 1911 he was  
610  
Satyavati  
sentenced to life imprisonment in the  
Andaman Islands but was released  
because of political pressure in 1924,  
although he was barred from politics  
until 1937. In the time after that he  
served for seven years as president of  
the **Hindu Mahasabha**, until failing  
health finally forced him to resign.  
Throughout his life he had sharp differences with **Mohandas Gandhi**, first  
over the latter’s commitment to nonviolence and later over the partition of  
India, which Savarkar characterized as  
the “vivisection” of the Indian motherland. Savarkar was brought to trial  
when Gandhi was assassinated by one  
of his former associates, **Nathuram**  
**Godse**. Savarkar was acquitted, but the  
accusation had a negative affect on the  
rest of his life.  
Savarkar’s keynote work, **Hindutva**,  
was composed and committed to memory while he was imprisoned in the  
Andamans. His central thesis was that  
the Hindus were a nation, despite all of  
their differences—social, regional, cultural, linguistic, and religious—because  
for them India was their motherland,  
fatherland, and holy land. He called on  
Hindus to transcend the particular identities that divided them and to gain  
strength through unity to resist the  
oppression of outsiders. Sarvarkar’s formulation equates Hinduism and Indian  
nationalism and thus marginalizes both  
Muslims and Christians as “outsiders.”  
His ideas profoundly influenced **Dr.**  
**K. B. Hedgewar**, founder of the  
**Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS).  
The RSS and its affiliates have continued  
to stress some of Savarkar’s ideas, which,  
during the 1990s, have gained a national  
audience with the rise of the RSS-affiliated  
**Bharatiya Janata Party** (BJP). For further
