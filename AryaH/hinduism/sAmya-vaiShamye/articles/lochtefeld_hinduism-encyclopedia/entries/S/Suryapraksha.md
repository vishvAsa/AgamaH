(“effulgence of the **sun**”) Name given to  
the banner that is the symbolic emblem  
of the **Mahanirvani Akhara**, a particular  
group of the **Naga** class of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**. The Nagas are  
devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**,  
organized into different **akharas** or regiments on the model of an army. Until  
the beginning of the nineteenth century  
the *Nagas*’ primary occupation was as  
mercenary soldiers, although they also  
had substantial trading interests; both  
of these have largely disappeared in  
contemporary times. All of the akharas  
have particular features that signify  
their organizational identity, and this  
particular banner—one with strong  
connections to a martial identity—is  
one such feature.
