title = "Shantanu"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great **Sanskrit** epics, Shantanu is the  
father of **Bhishma** by his first wife, and  
the husband of **Satyavati** in his second  
marriage. Satyavati has agreed to marry  
Shantanu on the condition that her sons  
reign, despite the fact that Bhishma is  
the eldest and thus is rightly entitled to  
the throne. Shantanu agrees to this condition, and to please his father Bhishma  
vows never to marry, so that he will have  
no heirs to compete with Satyavati’s.  
Bhishma upholds his promise until his  
death, but Shantanu’s willingness to put  
aside the rightful heir has terrible consequences. When Satyavati’s son **Vichitravirya** dies childless, she calls on her  
elder son **Vyasa** to sire children by his  
wives. From this union comes **Pandu**  
and **Dhrtarashtra**. The struggle for royal  
power by their respective sons culminates in the Mahabharata war, in which  
the family is destroyed.
