Among the four major social groups  
(**varnas**) in the traditional Hindu society, the shudras are the lowest and least  
influential. In this model, the shudras’  
social function was to serve all the others. This low social status is reflected in  
the creation story known as the **Purusha**  
**Sukta**, in which the shudras are  
described as being created from the  
Primeval Man’s feet. The feet are the  
lowest and basest part of the body, and  
the shudra was correspondingly seen as  
the lowest level of **caste** Hindu society.  
Unlike members of the “**twice-born**”  
varnas—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, and  
**vaishya**—whose adolescent males were  
entitled to have a ritual second birth  
that entitled them to study the **Veda**,  
shudras were always once-born, and  
thus forbidden to study or even to hear  
the Veda. In practice the status of shudras differed widely from region to  
region—in southern India, many of the  
land-owning **jatis** (**endogamous** social  
subgroups) were shudras, and they were  
very influential communities. At the  
very least, they were accorded a definitive place in caste Hinduism, unlike the  
**untouchables**, who were considered  
completely impure, usually because of  
their hereditary occupations.
