title = "Savitri"

+++
In Indian culture, a mythic figure and  
the model for a virtuous and faithful  
wife, who by her cleverness is able to  
rescue her husband **Satyavan** from the  
clutches of Death himself. Before Savitri  
is betrothed to Satyavan, she has been  
told that he will die within a **year**. Savitri  
replies that she has chosen him for her  
husband and will not be deterred. On  
the day that he is fated to die, Satyavan  
goes to the forest to cut wood, accompanied by Savitri. After Satyavan falls  
unconscious while working, Savitri sees  
**Yama**, the god of Death, draw out  
Satyavan’s soul and start his journey  
back to the underworld. Savitri follows  
them. When Yama tells her that she cannot follow where they are going, she  
meekly replies that it is her wifely duty  
to follow her husband. Yama grants her  
some wishes, although she is forbidden  
to ask for her husband’s life. Savitri first  
requests that her blind father-in-law  
shall regain his sight, then that he shall  
regain the kingdom from which he has  
been exiled, and finally that she shall  
have many **sons**. All of these requests  
are granted, and when she points out  
that the return of her husband will be  
necessary for her to have many sons,  
Yama acknowledges that he has been  
outwitted, and leaves the two of them to  
many happy years together.
