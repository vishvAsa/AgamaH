title = "Shiwalik Hills"

+++
Himalayan foothills running through  
the Indian states of **Uttar Pradesh**,  
**Himachal Pradesh**, and **Jammu** and  
**Kashmir**. The hills are an ecological  
transition zone between the plains  
and the mountains but have their own  
religious ecology as well. Whereas the  
sites high in the **Himalayas** are often  
associated with **Shiva**, the primary  
sacred sites (**tirthas**) in the Shiwaliks are  
associated with the **Goddess**. See also  
**Shiwalik goddesses**.
