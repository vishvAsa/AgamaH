title = "Sun Temple"

+++
The most famous temple to the **sun** is at  
**Konarak** in **Orissa** state, right on the  
shore of the Bay of Bengal. The temple  
was built by King Narasimhadeva (r.  
1238–1264), a monarch in the **Ganga**  
**dynasty**, and the entire temple was  
intended to be a likeness of the sun’s  
chariot. It has twelve great wheels  
carved on the sides at the temple’s lowest level, and in front, statues of several  
colossal horses. As at the temples of  
**Khajuraho**, the lower levels here are  
covered with **erotic** and sexually explicit  
carvings, to which people have given  
differing interpretations: Some claim  
that these sanction carnal pleasure as a  
religious path, some interpret them allegorically as representing human union  
with the divine, and still others view  
them as teaching that the desire for  
pleasure must ultimately be transcended  
to attain the divine.  
The temple was built on a massive  
scale; according to one estimate, the  
central spire would have been over 200  
feet high. It is uncertain whether this  
spire was ever actually completed, since  
the sandy soil on which the temple platform was built would have been unable  
to support the weight of such an enormous structure. This same unstable soil  
has been the greatest contributor to the  
temple’s increasing deterioration. The  
primary structure left at the site is the  
**jagamohan** (assembly hall), which was  
filled with sand in the nineteenth century,  
in an effort to prevent further collapse.
