(“enumeration”) One of the **six schools**  
of traditional Hindu **philosophy**, whose  
founding text is the *Samkhyakarikas*,  
written by **Ishvarakrishna** in the third  
century B.C.E. Samkhya espouses an  
atheistic philosophical dualism positing  
two fundamental principles as the  
source of all things. The first of these is  
called **purusha** (“person”), which is conscious, but completely inactive and  
unchanging. It is seen as a passive witness to the transformations going on  
around it. As the source of consciousness, purusha is ultimately identified  
with an individual’s true and eternal  
Self. Purusha is inferred as plural, given  
the plurality of conscious beings, combined with the fact that one person can  
gain enlightenment while all the rest  
remain in bondage.  
The other fundamental principle is  
**prakrti**, (“nature”), which provides the  
object to the purusha’s subject. Prakrti is  
better conceived of as force or power  
rather than a specific material object.  
Prakrti contains within it forces with three  
different primordial qualities (**gunas**):  
587  
Samkhya  
**sattva** tends toward the good, **rajas**  
towards activity or passion, and **tamas**  
towards darkness and decay. In the primal prakrti these three forces are in perfect equilibrium, each perfectly balancing the others. The two principles of  
purusha and prakrti are distinct, separate, and alone.  
When prakrti’s initial equilibrium is  
disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern of  
**evolution** that creates both the exterior  
physical world and the interior psychological world. From prakrti emerges  
**mahat** (“the great one”), which has as its  
psychological counterpart the subtlest  
form of mental activity (**buddhi**). From  
buddhi evolves **ahamkar**, which contains the first real ideas of individual  
identity. From ahamkar evolves the  
mind (**manas**), the sense organs (**jnanendriyas**), the organs of action (**karmendriyas**), and the subtle elements  
(**tanmatras**); from the last evolve the  
gross elements that actually make up  
the material world. All of these evolutes—material or psychic—have a differing balance of the three gunas, which  
ultimately determines their character as  
wholesome, active, or unwholesome.  
Throughout this process of evolution,  
purusha remains unchanged, a mere  
witness to prakrti’s unceasing transformations. Their mutual functioning is  
described using the metaphor of the  
lame man (purusha) being carried by  
the blind man (prakrti).  
The ultimate source of bondage,  
according to the Samkhya school,  
comes because people do not recognize  
the difference between these two principles. Through this lack of discrimination  
between the two, the Self (purusha)  
appears as if it is an agent, and the evolutes (from prakrti) as if they are conscious. The Samkhyas illustrate this misunderstanding using the example of the  
rose behind the crystal, in which the latter appears to be colored but is in fact  
unchanged. Although for the Samkhyas  
prakrti undergoes real transformations,  
the primary problem is epistemological—that is, how one comes to know  
things—rather than ontological, or rooted  
in the nature of things themselves. Since  
the purusha never changes, there is no  
question of making it into anything else  
or regaining the way that it used to be;  
the real problem is making the distinction between the differing realities of  
these two principles. Once this has been  
done, the evolution of prakrti is said to  
reverse, leaving the purusha again in its  
state of magnificent isolation (**kaivalya**).  
Of course, once one has a developed (if  
erroneous) idea of (conventional) personality, this discrimination becomes all  
the more difficult. This mistaken idea  
becomes the basis for one’s volitional  
actions (**karma**) and one’s emotional  
dispositions. One’s actions and dispositions reinforce each other, and both of  
these are undergirded by the notion of a  
Self.  
The Samkhya metaphysics were  
adopted wholesale by the **yoga** philosophical school, and the two schools are  
usually mentioned together—Samkhya  
as the theoretical foundation, and Yoga  
as the practical component. One of  
Samkhya’s lasting contributions to  
Indian thought is the idea of the gunas, a  
basic concept running through Hindu  
culture. Another influential but less pervasive idea is their model of evolution,  
which has been adapted by other  
schools but often subsumed under theistic assumptions in which God is the  
source of both consciousness and the  
material world. The one philosophical  
problem that the Samkhya could never  
surmount was to explain the source of  
bondage, given their starting assumptions. If purusha and prakrti are completely separate, how could the two of  
them interact—much less mistake one  
for the other—and how did the process  
of evolution begin? Although their contributions remain significant, they were  
largely eclipsed by **Vedanta**, which  
claimed that the problem is ignorance of  
the Self and not-Self, and that the world  
around us is not an actual evolution, but  
only an illusory transformation (vivarta).  
This philosophical model is called  
**Vivartavada**. For further information
