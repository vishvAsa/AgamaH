(“junction”) In classical **Sanskrit** grammar, a term for the euphonic (harmonic)  
combination of words. In general this is  
done by modifying the final phoneme of  
one word, based on the initial phoneme  
of the following word, to facilitate a  
smooth verbal transition between the  
two. An example is the compound word  
**sacchidananda**, which designates the  
three essential aspects of the ultimate  
unqualified **Brahman**, and is formed  
from the words **sat** (“being”), *chit* (“consciousness”) and **ananda** (“bliss”).
