title = "Suchi Hasta"

+++
In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**, and ritual, a  
particular hand **gesture** (**hasta**), in  
which the hand is closed except for  
the index finger, which is pointing  
downward to indicate something to the  
viewer. The word *suchi* means “needle”  
but is derived from a verb that can mean  
either “to pierce” or “to indicate”—both  
meanings that imply focusing on a  
particular place.
