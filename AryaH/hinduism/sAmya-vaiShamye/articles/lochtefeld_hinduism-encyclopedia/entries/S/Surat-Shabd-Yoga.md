title = "Surat-Shabd-Yoga"

+++
Mystical discipline in the **Radha Soami**  
religious community, which stresses the  
671  
Surat-Shabd-Yoga  
joining (**yoga**) of the spirit (surat) with  
the Divine Sound (shabd). The Divine  
Sound emanates from the Supreme  
Being and is always present. Most people cannot hear it due to their preoccupation with worldly things. With proper  
training and devotion to a true **guru**  
(**satguru**), anyone can eventually  
become attuned to the Divine Sound,  
and resonate in harmony with it. The  
most important part of this path is contact with a true guru, since only a true  
guru has access to the divine and is considered a manifestation of the divine  
itself. Devotion to a true guru is the single most important factor in a person’s  
spiritual development, and this spiritual  
progress hinges on complete surrender  
to the guru’s **grace**.  
This metaphor of the Divine Sound,  
and human resonance with it, has much  
in common with the images used by  
Guru Nanak, the first of the Sikh gurus,  
and with the **Nathpanthis** before him.  
The overwhelming stress on a guru  
makes it possible for this religious  
discipline to be practiced by just  
about anyone, and most of the Radha  
Soami followers are householders living  
in the world rather than ascetics. For
