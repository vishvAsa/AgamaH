Term denoting “**women’s** religious duty”  
(**dharma**), the set of social roles, rules,  
and duties broadly conceived as applying to all women. In the **dharma literature**, it was generally assumed that  
appropriate women’s roles were as  
daughters, wives, and mothers, and that  
their lives would be primarily defined by  
their relationships with men—whether  
fathers, brothers, husbands, or sons. As  
described in the dharma literature, their  
position seems to have had status, but  
little authority. One well-known passage  
from the **Manu Smrti** warns that a  
woman must never be independent, but  
always under the guardianship of a man;  
this is followed by an equally famous  
664  
Steya  
passage warning that the treatment of  
women was a marker of the family’s  
honor, and that a household in which  
the women were badly treated would  
disappear. In real life women exercised  
considerably more power than in this  
theoretical model, but such power usually came later in life, when a woman’s  
sons had formed families of their own,  
and she had thus become the matriarch  
of an extended family.
