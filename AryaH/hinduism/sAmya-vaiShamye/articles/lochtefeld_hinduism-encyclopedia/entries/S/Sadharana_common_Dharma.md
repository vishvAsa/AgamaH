In the **dharma literature**, the religious  
duties required of all human beings,  
including truth, generosity, and compassion. One’s essential obligation, however,  
is to fulfill one’s own **dharma** (**svadharma**),  
which may supersede or even contradict  
the requirements of the common dharma. For instance, it is generally accepted  
that a king must occasionally disregard  
truth to be an effective ruler. Since a  
king’s primary duty is to maintain peace  
and order in the country, so that other  
people have the opportunity to do their  
duties, he is required to do whatever it  
takes to accomplish this.
