(“Slaughter of **Shishupala**”) **Sanskrit**  
drama written by the seventh-century  
poet **Magha**, which is traditionally reckoned as one of the six **mahakavyas**. The  
play’s theme is the death of the mythic  
figure Shishupala, whose mother has  
been promised by **Krishna** that he will  
forgive her son one hundred times. This  
promise only makes Shishupala more  
reckless, and after the one hundred and  
first insult, Krishna throws his discus  
and cuts off Shishupala’s head. Aside  
from its mythic theme, the play  
is notable for a number of unusual  
verses, such as verses that are perfect  
palindromes (verses that are the same  
when read backward or forward), or that  
use only one or two consonants, as a  
sign of the poet’s skill.
