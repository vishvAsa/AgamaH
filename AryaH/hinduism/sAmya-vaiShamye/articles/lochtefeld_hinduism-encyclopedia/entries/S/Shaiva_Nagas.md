**Naga** (“naked,” i.e., fighting) ascetics  
who are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**, organized into different **akharas** or regiments on the model of an  
army. The other major Naga division  
was the **Bairagi** Nagas, who were  
devotees of the god **Vishnu**. Until the  
beginning of the nineteenth century  
the Nagas’ primary occupation was as  
mercenary soldiers, although they also  
had substantial trading interests. Such  
resources allowed many Naga leaders  
to become rich and powerful men  
despite often coming from lower  
social strata, and in earlier times such  
opportunities would have made a  
career as a Naga an attractive proposition for an ambitious young man. Both  
these sources of income have largely  
disappeared in contemporary times,  
although some Naga communities are  
still landowners with extensive properties and thus both rich and influential. See also **shaiva**.
