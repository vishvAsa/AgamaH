title = "Sudama"

+++
In Hindu mythology, one of the god  
**Krishna’s** childhood friends who is a  
symbol for god’s **grace** and providence.  
In later life Sudama is desperately poor  
and, at his wife’s urging, goes to beg for  
help from his childhood friend, who is  
now the king of **Dwaraka**. Sudama is so  
poor that the only gift he can bring for  
Krishna is a small packet of parched  
rice, but Krishna greets him and graciously accepts it. The two have an  
enjoyable visit in which they reminisce  
about old times, and Sudama goes home  
without asking for anything. Some of the  
stories explain this lapse as stemming  
from shame, but in others Sudama is  
portrayed as having had such a nice  
time that he simply forgets. During his  
homeward journey Sudama worries  
over the reception he will get from his  
wife, but when he arrives he discovers  
that his hut has been transformed into a  
palace by Krishna’s **divine power**, and  
from that day he is never poor again.
