A lance or pike; one of the characteristic  
weapons in Hindu iconography. The  
most famous example of this is the trident (**trishul**), which has three points,  
although the center one may be larger  
than the side ones. This weapon is most  
intimately associated with **Shiva**, but it  
is also commonly carried by certain  
powerful forms of the **Goddess**. This  
may reflect her charter myth, in which  
she was formed from the collected radiance of all the gods and received duplicates of their weapons from all of them.  
The lance with a single blade is associated  
with the god **Skanda**, particularly in his  
southern Indian manifestation as  
**Murugan**. When carried by SkandaMurugan, the lance is usually called  
**shakti** (“power”), rather than shula.
