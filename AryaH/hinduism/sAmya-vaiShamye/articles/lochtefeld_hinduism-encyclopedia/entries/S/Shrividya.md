title = "Shrividya"

+++
Southern Indian school of **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based religious practice,  
in which the principal **deity** is the  
**goddess** Lalita Tripurasundari. The  
Shrividya tradition is noted for its ritual  
use of the **shrichakra**, a particular symbolic diagram (**yantra**) composed of a  
series of interlocking triangles. The  
Shrichakra ritual is known as **samharakrama**, and is a systematic ritual deconstruction of the perceivable world and  
all illusions of duality, to attain union  
with the single true reality. The interior  
counterpart to this exterior ritual is the  
practice of **kundalini yoga**, which is  
based on the tantric idea of the **subtle**  
**body**—the six psychic centers (**chakras**)  
running along the spine—and seeks to  
gain ultimate union within the aspirant’s  
own body by bringing together the  
microcosmic forms of the deities **Shiva**  
and **Shakti** that exist within the body.
