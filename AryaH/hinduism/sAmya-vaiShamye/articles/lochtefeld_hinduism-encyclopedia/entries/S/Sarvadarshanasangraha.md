(“Collection of all [philosophical]  
views”) A philosophical encyclopedia  
composed by **Madhava** in the late fourteenth century. In this text, Madhava  
compiled the views of all the existing  
philosophical schools, which he placed  
in hierarchical order, based on his judgment of their truth value. The **materialist** schools were ranked the lowest and  
least reliable since their proponents  
completely denied the virtue of any religious life. After this came various  
Buddhist schools, whose low standing  
can be attributed to the widespread perception that they were nihilists (**nastikas**). Madhava then moves through  
the various Hindu philosophical  
schools, finishing with the **Advaita**  
**Vedanta** school—his own—which was  
judged the highest and most perfect  
expression of the truth. Although the  
Sarvadarshanasangraha is a polemical  
text with a clear bias, it is one of the few  
extant sources that considers the perspectives of all the existing schools.
