(“**svastika**-posture”) One of the sitting  
postures (**asana**) described in commentaries to the **Yoga Sutras**. In this position, the right foot is inserted into the  
space between the left thigh and calf,  
and the left foot into the space between  
the right thigh and calf (one of the feet is  
pointing upwards, and the other downward). The opposing directions of the  
feet and the crossed legs evokes images  
of the svastika, hence the name.
