title = "Somnath"

+++
Temple and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
state of **Gujarat**. The temple is named  
for its presiding **deity**—the god **Shiva** in  
his manifestation as the “Lord of the  
**Moon**.” Shiva is present at Somnath in  
the form of a **linga**, the pillar-shaped  
image that is his symbolic form, and the  
Somnath linga is one of the twelve  
**jyotirlingas**, a network of sites deemed  
especially sacred to Shiva, and at which  
he is uniquely present. According to the  
site’s charter myth, the moon is married  
to all of the twenty-seven **nakshatras**, or  
signs in the lunar **zodiac**, but he loves  
**Rohini** nakshatra so much that he stays  
with her all the time, and neglects his  
other twenty-six wives. His father-in-law  
**Daksha** protests to the moon, but when  
he refuses to give them equal time,  
Daksha lays a curse on him that he will  
lose all his light. The moon overcomes  
this **curse** by worshiping Shiva at  
Somnath for six continuous months and  
is given the boon that he will only shrink  
during half the **lunar month**, and that  
during the other half he will grow. As  
a sign of this gift, Shiva takes  
residence there as Somnath, and  
remains to this day.  
Aside from its importance as a sacred  
site, the Somnath temple is a potent  
political symbol. The original temple  
was razed and pillaged by **Mahmud of**  
**Ghazni** in 1024, who reportedly carried  
off astounding booty. The present temple at Somnath was built after Indian  
independence in 1947 and consecrated  
in 1951. As a symbol, Somnath is thus  
associated with past oppression and  
depredation, and with the revitalization  
of Hindu culture in India. For this reason, the Somnath temple is a popular  
image for proponents of **Hindutva**, an  
idea that identifies Hindu identity and  
Indian citizenship.
