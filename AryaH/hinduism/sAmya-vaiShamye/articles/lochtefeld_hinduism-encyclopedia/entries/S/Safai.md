title = "Safai"

+++
Small cloth wrapped around the base of  
a **chillum**, a clay cylinder used for smoking a mixture of tobacco and hashish  
(**charas**). The safai serves two purposes,  
one ritual and one physical. On one  
hand, it forms a barrier intended to prevent passing the ritual impurity  
(**ashaucha**) carried by saliva when the  
chillum is being passed from person to  
person. Ascetics who are very conscious  
of **purity** or status will often wrap their  
own safai around the base of the chillum  
before smoking. Aside from helping to  
protect personal purity, the safai also  
serves a practical purposeâ€“it is usually  
dipped in **water** before being wrapped  
around the chillum, which serves to cool  
and mellow the smoke being drawn  
through it.
