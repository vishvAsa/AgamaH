According to the lunar **calendar**, by  
which most Hindu religious festivals are  
determined, Shravan is the fifth month  
in the lunar **year**, usually falling within  
July and August. In northern India  
Shravan is associated with the rains, the  
breaking of the heat and revival of the  
land, and a general feeling of release.  
The major holidays in Shravan are **Nag**  
**Panchami**, **Kamika Ekadashi**, **Tulsidas**  
**Jayanti**, **Putrada Ekadashi**, and **Raksha**  
**Bandhan**. In addition, the entire  
month is deemed sacred to the god  
**Shiva**, with all **Mondays** and the  
**Shravan Vrat** marked out as times for  
particular observances.
