title = "Sadachara"

+++
(“practice of good [people]”) One of the  
traditional sources for determining religious duty (**dharma**) for matters not  
treated in the **dharma literature**, or for  
cases in which the literature itself gave  
conflicting opinions. This was the least  
authoritative source of dharma, after the  
**Vedas** (the oldest Hindu scriptures) and  
the dharma literature. Sadachara recognizes that life has many ambiguities and  
uncertainties, and at the same time provides a resource for determining the  
appropriate action, by taking as a model  
the practice of established and upright  
people. Another term to designate this  
sort of authority was **shishtachara**, the  
“practice of learned [people].”
