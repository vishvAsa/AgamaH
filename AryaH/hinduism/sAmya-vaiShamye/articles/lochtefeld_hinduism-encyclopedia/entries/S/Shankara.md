title = "Shankara"

+++
(“auspicious”) Epithet of the god  
**Shiva**. With the honorific suffix  
**acharya** (“teacher”), this is also the  
name of the most significant figure in  
the **Advaita Vedanta** philosophical  
school, **Shankaracharya**, who is popularly considered to be Shiva incarnate. As noted above, the generally  
accepted meaning of the name

Shalagram  
Believed to be a manifestation of the god Vishnu,  
a shalagram is a black stone that contains the  
fossilized spiral shell of a prehistoric sea creature.  
Shankara has intensely positive connotations, yet the verb *shank*, from  
which this name is almost certainly  
derived, has associations with doubt,  
uncertainty, and anxiety. This sort of  
ambivalence has a long association  
with Shiva; the earliest accepted reference, in the **Shvetashvatara Upanishad**, mentions both his death-dealing arrows, and his kindness to his  
devotees (**bhakta**). The traditional  
meaning of this name may thus be a  
form of propitiation—knowing that  
Shiva wields awesome and unpredictable power but describing him as  
“auspicious” in the hope that he will  
show his kinder side.
