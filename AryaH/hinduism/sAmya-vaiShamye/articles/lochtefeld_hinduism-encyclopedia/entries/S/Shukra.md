title = "Shukra"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the religious  
teacher (**guru**) of the type of **demons**  
known as **asuras**. Shukra is a wellknown figure who appears most prominently in the tale of the **Vamana avatar**.  
In this tale, the Asura king **Bali** is performing a great **sacrifice**. He is  
approached by the god **Vishnu**, who has  
taken the form of a dwarf (**vamana**), and  
asks Bali for three paces of land to build  
a sacrificial altar. Shukra suspects a  
trick, and warns Bali not to grant it, but  
Bali ignores Shukraâ€™s cautionary advice.  
As soon as Bali grants the gift, the dwarf  
grows immensely large. With his first  
two steps Vishnu measures out the cosmos, and with his third pushes Bali  
down into the underworld, where he is  
allowed to reign as king.
