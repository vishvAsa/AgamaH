title = "Sen"

+++
(15th c.) Poet and saint of the **Varkari**  
**Panth**, a religious community centered  
around the **worship** of the Hindu god  
**Vithoba**. According to tradition, Sen was  
a barber—a very low-**caste** occupation—at the court of the king of Bidar.  
Sen renounced this occupation to wander and sing Vithoba’s praises. Little is  
known about him, but he is mentioned  
as a model of devotion in one of the  
hymns by the northern Indian poetsaint **Ravidas**, which indicates that he  
was well known outside **Maharashtra**.
