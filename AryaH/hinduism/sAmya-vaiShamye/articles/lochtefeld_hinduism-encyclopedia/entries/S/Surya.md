The **sun**, both in its physical form as a  
celestial phenomenon and personified  
as a **deity**. The sun has been an important deity as far back as the **Vedas**, the  
earliest and most authoritative Hindu  
religious texts, and has retained a position of some importance since that time.  
One example of this is the **Gayatri**  
**Mantra**, a sacred formula that is supposed to be recited every day by **twiceborn** males, that is, men from the three  
“twice-born” groups—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, and **vaishya**—who have undergone the adolescent religious **initiation**  
known as the “second birth.” The  
Gayatri Mantra invokes the sun as the  
generator and nourisher of all things,  
and requests him to stimulate the minds  
of those who perceive him. Surya is still  
worshiped by many **Smarta** brahmins as  
one of the “five-fold” (panchayatana)  
deities (the others being **Shiva**, **Vishnu**,  
the **Goddess**, and **Ganesh**), a practice  
attributed to the Advaita philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**. For some time Surya  
was also the primary deity for certain  
communities, particularly in eastern  
India, although his cult has been largely  
eclipsed in recent times. The most  
spectacular example of this **worship**  
is the temple of the sun at **Konarak**  
(now ruined), whose claims to fame  
stem from its enormous size and  
the profuse **erotic** sculptures on its  
exterior walls. For further information
