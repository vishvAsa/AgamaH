title = "Seasons"

+++
According to the most traditional enumeration, there are six seasons, each  
spanning two **lunar months**: Vasanta  
(spring) in the lunar months of **Chaitra**  
and **Baisakh**; Grishma (hot season) in  
**Jyeshth** and **Ashadh**; Varsha (rains) in  
**Shravan** and **Bhadrapada**; Sharad (fall)  
in **Ashvin** and **Kartik**; Hemanta (winter)  
in **Margashirsha** and **Paush**; and  
612  
Savitri  
Shishira (late winter) in **Magh** and  
**Phalgun**. In actual practice, there are  
three major seasons, at least in northern  
India: the hot season (April–June), the  
**monsoon** (July–September), and the  
cool season (October–March). All these  
seasons are approximate, because they  
are ultimately determined by larger climatic phenomena. In the hot season the  
sun bakes the northern Indian plains,  
eventually setting in motion air currents  
that suck moist air north from the  
Indian ocean; the resulting monsoons  
break the heat and provide rain for the  
crops. The weather then gets gradually  
cooler until January, when it becomes  
gradually hotter until the hot season  
returns. The monsoon arrives at different times in different parts of the country—earlier to regions further south,  
later to regions further north—and at  
times the monsoons are sporadic or do  
not come at all. Each of these three seasons has general correlations with certain festivals.  
The hot season is a time of gradually  
increasing heat, and many of the festivals during this time have associations  
with heat: **Holi**, **Navaratri**, **Ram**  
**Navami**, **Shitalashtami**, and **Ganga**  
**Dashahara**. Although the rising heat  
can make life difficult, it is considered a  
generally auspicious time.  
The rainy season is a time of both  
physical and ritual danger. The sudden  
influx of rain drives venomous animals  
such as snakes and scorpions from their  
holes, and their search for other habitations often brings them into contact with  
human beings. On a bacteriological level,  
the runoff from the rains often leads to  
the contamination of water supplies by  
sewage and to a sharp rise in sickness and  
death from gastrointestinal ailments, as  
well as other infections. On the ritual  
level, the gods are considered to be sleeping during part of the rainy season and  
thus less available to protect their devotees (**bhakta**). At the same time, the coming of the rains is greatly anticipated, and  
the moisture is essential for crops to grow.  
Consequently, although this is a time of  
great fertility and abundance, it is also  
associated with danger, and some of the  
festivals are **rites of protection**: **Nag**  
**Panchami**, **Raksha Bandhan**, **Ganesh**  
**Chaturthi**, **Anant Chaturdashi**, and the  
**Pitrpaksha**. Other ceremonies are associated with water or with the rains, such as  
the **Shravan** festival and **Janmashtami**.  
In the cool season the gods awaken  
from their sleep, and crops that have been  
fed by the rains are ready for harvest. This  
is the most ritually active time of the **year**,  
and is generally auspicious. Major festivals  
include the fall Navaratri, ending with the  
festival of **Dussehra** (Vijaya Dashami),  
**Diwali**, **Karva Chauth**, **Kartik Purnima**,  
**Makara Sankranti**, and **Shivaratri**. The  
last major festival of the year is Holi, which  
marks the unofficial beginning of the hot  
season. In ending with Holi, a festival celebrating license, excess, and the dissolution of all social boundaries, followed by  
an abrupt reestablishment of propriety  
and social order, the lunar year thus mirrors the cycle of the cosmos, which is subject to degeneration and periodic renewal.
