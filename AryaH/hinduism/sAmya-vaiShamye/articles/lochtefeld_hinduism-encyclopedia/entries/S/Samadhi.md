(“trance”) In the **ashtanga yoga** first  
codified by the philosopher **Patanjali**,  
the last of the eight elements of yoga  
practice. Along with **dharana** (“concentration”) and **dhyana** (“meditation”),  
samadhi is one of the three practices  
that make up the “inner discipline”  
(**samyama**), the culmination of yogic  
training. Samadhi is described as a state  
in which the mind is conscious of only  
the object of concentration, and is  
devoid of any notion of the self as perceiver. Once one has attained samhadi  
on the conscious plane, one supposedly  
pursues it on more subtle inner planes.  
The loss of subjectivity in samadhi is  
believed to make people unaware of the  
outside world, such that they will not  
respond to stimuli and may sometimes  
appear almost dead. For this reason, the  
**burial** places of deceased ascetics are  
usually referred to as **samadhi shrines**,  
since it is popularly believed that  
they are not dead, but only rapt in  
deep meditation.
