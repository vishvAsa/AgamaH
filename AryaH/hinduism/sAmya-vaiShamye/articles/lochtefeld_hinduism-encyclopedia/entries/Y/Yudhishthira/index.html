  <meta property="og:description" content="(“firm in battle”) In the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics,
Yudhishthira is the eldest of the
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. Yudhishthira is magically
born when his mother, Kunti, uses a
powerful mantra to have a son by
Dharma, the god of righteousness.
Yudhishthira is in all ways his father’s
son; he is described in the epic as the
manifestation of Dharma on earth. He
is proverbial for his strict adherence to
the truth, is courteous to all, and is
committed to righteousness. His only
personal flaw is a love of gambling, a
love matched only by his complete lack
of gaming skill, and this flaw has major
repercussions.
Because of his virtues, Yudhishthira
is selected as heir to the throne by his
uncle, Dhrtarashtra. This choice raises
the jealousy of Dhrtarashtra’s son,
Duryodhana. He first tries to kill the
Pandavas by building the flammable
house of lac. The house is burned, but
the Pandavas are able to escape
unharmed. Some time later, Duryodhana
decides to win Yudhishthira’s rights to
the kingship in a game of dice. Here
Yudhishthira’s love for gambling gets the
better of his judgment, for he is playing
against Duryodhana’s maternal uncle,
Shakuni, who is very skilled. As Yudhishthira begins to lose, he keeps betting
bigger and bigger stakes, in an effort to
win back what he has lost. After losing
their kingdom and all their possessions, Yudhishthira wagers himself and
his brothers. After losing this bet, he
wagers and loses the Pandava brothers’
common wife, Draupadi. This loss
leads to Draupadi’s humiliation, in
which she is paraded through the
assembly hall by Duryodhana and his
brother, Duhshasana, her clothes
stained with her menstrual blood. This
event sharpens the already strong enmities between the two groups. Shocked at
such treatment, Duryodhana’s father,
King Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas
back their freedom, but because of the
loss in the game of dice, the Pandavas
agree to go into exile for twelve years
and live incognito for the thirteenth,
with the condition that if they are
discovered in the thirteenth year the
cycle will begin anew.
Yudhishthira and his brothers peacefully pass their twelve years in exile.
During the thirteenth year, they live in the
court of King Virata, where they remain
undiscovered, despite frantic searching
by Duryodhana’s spies. When the thirteen years have passed, Yudhishthira and
his brothers return to claim their part of
the kingdom. Yudhishthira hopes for
some sort of peaceful settlement and
sends a message to Duryodhana saying
that they will be satisfied with a mere five
villages, one for each brother. When
Duryodhana responds that they will not
get as much land as could fit under the
point of a needle, Yudhishthira realizes
that they will not get their rights without
a battle. He reluctantly mobilizes his
brothers for war. He fights valiantly in
the great war and is crowned the king
after their victory.
After ruling for many years,
Yudhishthira sets out with his brothers
and their wife, Draupadi, for the
Himalayas, followed by a small dog. As
they climb the mountains Draupadi and
his brothers die one by one, but the dog
remains with Yudhishthira. At the top of
the Himalayas Yudhishthira finds the
god Indra, the king of heaven, waiting
for him in a golden chariot. Indra tells
Yudhishthira that he will take him to
heaven but that Yudhishthira will have
784
Yoni
to leave the dog behind. Yudhishthira
flatly refuses to abandon his faithful
companion, even if it means that he will
not go to heaven. The dog then reveals
himself to be the god Dharma in disguise. The lesson in this story is that
throughout his life Yudhishthira never
allows himself to stray far from righteousness; even at the end he refuses to
forsake it.">

  <p>(“firm in battle”) In the <strong>Mahabharata</strong>,<br>
the later of the two great Hindu epics,<br>
Yudhishthira is the eldest of the<br>
<strong>Pandava</strong> brothers who are the epic’s<br>
protagonists. Yudhishthira is magically<br>
born when his mother, <strong>Kunti</strong>, uses a<br>
powerful <strong>mantra</strong> to have a son by<br>
<strong>Dharma</strong>, the god of righteousness.<br>
Yudhishthira is in all ways his father’s<br>
son; he is described in the epic as the<br>
manifestation of Dharma on earth. He<br>
is proverbial for his strict adherence to<br>
the truth, is courteous to all, and is<br>
committed to righteousness. His only<br>
personal flaw is a love of <strong>gambling</strong>, a<br>
love matched only by his complete lack<br>
of gaming skill, and this flaw has major<br>
repercussions.<br>
Because of his virtues, Yudhishthira<br>
is selected as heir to the throne by his<br>
uncle, <strong>Dhrtarashtra</strong>. This choice raises<br>
the jealousy of Dhrtarashtra’s son,<br>
<strong>Duryodhana</strong>. He first tries to kill the<br>
Pandavas by building the flammable<br>
<strong>house of lac</strong>. The house is burned, but<br>
the Pandavas are able to escape<br>
unharmed. Some time later, Duryodhana<br>
decides to win Yudhishthira’s rights to<br>
the kingship in a game of dice. Here<br>
Yudhishthira’s love for gambling gets the<br>
better of his judgment, for he is playing<br>
against Duryodhana’s maternal uncle,<br>
<strong>Shakuni</strong>, who is very skilled. As Yudhishthira begins to lose, he keeps betting<br>
bigger and bigger stakes, in an effort to<br>
win back what he has lost. After losing<br>
their kingdom and all their possessions, Yudhishthira wagers himself and<br>
his brothers. After losing this bet, he<br>
wagers and loses the Pandava brothers’<br>
common wife, <strong>Draupadi</strong>. This loss<br>
leads to Draupadi’s humiliation, in<br>
which she is paraded through the<br>
assembly hall by Duryodhana and his<br>
brother, <strong>Duhshasana</strong>, her clothes<br>
stained with her menstrual <strong>blood</strong>. This<br>
event sharpens the already strong enmities between the two groups. Shocked at<br>
such treatment, Duryodhana’s father,<br>
King Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas<br>
back their freedom, but because of the<br>
loss in the game of dice, the Pandavas<br>
agree to go into exile for twelve years<br>
and live incognito for the thirteenth,<br>
with the condition that if they are<br>
discovered in the thirteenth year the<br>
cycle will begin anew.<br>
Yudhishthira and his brothers peacefully pass their twelve years in exile.<br>
During the thirteenth year, they live in the<br>
court of King <strong>Virata</strong>, where they remain<br>
undiscovered, despite frantic searching<br>
by Duryodhana’s spies. When the thirteen years have passed, Yudhishthira and<br>
his brothers return to claim their part of<br>
the kingdom. Yudhishthira hopes for<br>
some sort of peaceful settlement and<br>
sends a message to Duryodhana saying<br>
that they will be satisfied with a mere five<br>
villages, one for each brother. When<br>
Duryodhana responds that they will not<br>
get as much land as could fit under the<br>
point of a needle, Yudhishthira realizes<br>
that they will not get their rights without<br>
a battle. He reluctantly mobilizes his<br>
brothers for war. He fights valiantly in<br>
the great war and is crowned the king<br>
after their victory.<br>
After ruling for many years,<br>
Yudhishthira sets out with his brothers<br>
and their wife, Draupadi, for the<br>
<strong>Himalayas</strong>, followed by a small <strong>dog</strong>. As<br>
they climb the mountains Draupadi and<br>
his brothers die one by one, but the dog<br>
remains with Yudhishthira. At the top of<br>
the Himalayas Yudhishthira finds the<br>
god <strong>Indra</strong>, the king of <strong>heaven</strong>, waiting<br>
for him in a golden chariot. Indra tells<br>
Yudhishthira that he will take him to<br>
heaven but that Yudhishthira will have<br>
784<br>
Yoni<br>
to leave the dog behind. Yudhishthira<br>
flatly refuses to abandon his faithful<br>
companion, even if it means that he will<br>
not go to heaven. The dog then reveals<br>
himself to be the god Dharma in disguise. The lesson in this story is that<br>
throughout his life Yudhishthira never<br>
allows himself to stray far from righteousness; even at the end he refuses to<br>
forsake it.</p>
