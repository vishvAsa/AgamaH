title = "Yogi"

Literally meaning “one possessing  
**yoga**,” in practice the word refers only to  
a yogic adept—someone who “possesses”  
yoga in the sense of having mastered  
it—rather than to anyone simply practicing yoga. True yogis are widely  
believed to have superhuman powers  
(**siddhi**) as a by-product of their long  
spiritual development, which they can  
and will exercise for the benefit of their  
disciples—for physical healing of diseases, for psychological help, or for giving guidance on both spiritual and  
mundane matters. The yogi is seen as a  
spiritually realized person, and their  
authority stems completely from this  
attribution, which paradoxically is not  
subject to any sort of external verification.

Consequently, there are significant differences of opinion on whether or not  
any particular person is a yogi.
