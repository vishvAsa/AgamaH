title = "Yogmaya"

+++
Powerful form of the **Goddess**, particularly noted for her power to bewitch and  
bewilder people—in other words, her  
ability to wield **maya**, the power of illusion. In some modern sources Yogmaya  
is named as the **deity** who takes the  
form of the infant girl exchanged for the  
infant god **Krishna** and is later killed  
by Krishna’s wicked uncle, **Kamsa**.  
According to these sources, it is under  
her spell the previous night that all the  
inhabitants of Kamsa’s palace fall asleep,  
and Krishna’s father, **Vasudeva**, is able to  
spirit the infant away. Later in Krishna’s  
career, Yogmaya is believed to facilitate  
his clandestine meetings with the  
women of **Braj**—when Krishna plays his  
flute, the women come to him, but all  
the others fall into the spell cast by  
Yogmaya and are unaware of their  
absence. Because of her ability to wield  
maya, Yogmaya is a powerful deity; she  
is worshiped on the fourth day of the fall

Yogmaya  
**Navaratri**, the festival of the “nine  
nights” that are sacred to the Goddess in  
her varying forms.
