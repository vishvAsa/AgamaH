(b. Harbhajan Singh Puri, 1927) Modern  
Hindu missionary and founder of the  
**3HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood**. He  
first came to the United States in 1969,  
leaving behind his position as a customs  
official at the Delhi airport. His initial  
teachings were the traditional disciplines of **hatha yoga** and **kundalini**  
**yoga**, with his followers organized into a  
group known as the “Happy, Healthy,  
Holy Organization” (3HO). Hatha yoga is  
a system of religious discipline (**yoga**)  
based on a series of bodily postures  
known as **asanas**; this practice is widely  
believed to provide various physical  
benefits, including increased bodily  
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic  
ailments. Kundalini yoga is a religious  
discipline, the primary focus of which is  
awakening the **kundalini**, the latent  
spiritual force that exists in every person  
in the **subtle body**. The kundalini is  
awakened through a combination of  
yoga practice and ritual action and is  
believed to bring further spiritual capacities and ultimately final liberation  
(**moksha**) of the soul.  
These two disciplines remain an  
important part of Yogi Bhajan’s teachings, for he claims to be a master of  
**tantra**, a secret, ritually based religious  
practice, but in the 1970s his teaching  
widened to include traditional Sikh  
teachings and symbols. The most  
prominent of these symbols are the “five  
Ks” that all Sikhs are supposed to wear,  
so called because each of them begins  
with the letter *k*: uncut **hair** (kesh), a  
comb (kangha), a bangle on the right  
wrist (kara), shorts (kacch), and a ceremonial sword (kirpan). Many of Yogi  
Bhajan’s followers keep the Sikh symbols  
far more strictly than most people born  
as Sikhs, but the movement has two  
important divergences with the traditional Sikh community. One of these is  
its emphasis on tantra, which has little  
importance in the Sikh community. The  
most significant difference, however, is  
the religious authority that Yogi Bhajan  
holds over his followers, which is very  
different from the decentralized, essentially democratic form of the traditional  
Sikh community.
