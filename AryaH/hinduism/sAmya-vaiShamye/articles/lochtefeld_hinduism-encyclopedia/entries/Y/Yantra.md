(“instrument”) In astrology (**jyotisha**),  
and in **tantra**, a secret, ritually based  
religious practice, the word *yantra*  
most commonly refers to a symbolic  
diagram, often believed to confer  
**magic** or spiritual power on those  
who know how to use it. In some cases  
such yantras are considered to be an  
**aniconic** form of a **deity**, as is the case  
of the most famous yantra, the  
Shriyantra or **Shrichakra**, which is  
used in ritual for the **worship** of the  
**goddess** Tripura Sundari. The most literal meaning of the word is “device for  
restraining,” and in an astrological  
setting the yantras of the various  
**planets** are used in rituals to change  
their effects, usually to restrain or  
diminish the power of planets judged  
to be malefic or **inauspicious**.
