The Hindu ritual year is determined  
according to both a solar **calendar** and a  
lunar calendar. Aside from the Gregorian  
calendar and the common era, there are  
two indigenous Hindu calculations of  
the solar year, both of which have twelve  
solar months. In northern India these  
months correspond to the twelve signs  
of the **zodiac**, and the months change as  
the **sun** moves through them. As in the  
Western zodiac, the year begins when  
the sun enters Aries, although according  
to Indian astrology this transition takes  
place around April 14, rather than  
March 21, as figured in Euro-American  
astrology. In southern India there is an  
identical solar calendar, whose names  
are drawn from the names of certain  
**nakshatras** or lunar asterisms. Aside  
from the solar months, the solar year is  
also divided into halves based on the  
movement of the sun: the **Uttarayana**  
for the period when the sun is moving  
north, and the **Dakshinayana** in the  
time the sun is moving south. The sun  
begins its northward journey, considered the more auspicious time, on  
**Makara Sankranti**, reckoned as falling  
on January 14; it begins its southward  
journey six months later on **Karka**  
**Sankranti** on July 14.  
Far more important for religious  
purposes is the lunar calendar, which  
has twelve **lunar months**: **Chaitra**  
(March–April), **Baisakh** (April–May),  
**Jyeshth** (May–June), **Ashadh** (June–July),  
**Shravan** (July–August), **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September), **Ashvin** (September–  
October), **Kartik** (October–November),  
**Margashirsha** (November–December),  
**Paush**(December–January), **Magh**(January–  
February), and **Phalgun** (February–  
March). In northern India, the calendar  
usually begins in the first day of the  
bright half of Chaitra, meaning that the  
last days of the year are those in the  
dark half of this same month.  
Since these lunar months are based on  
the phases of the **moon** (ending with the  
**full moon** in northern India and the **new**  
**moon** in southern India), the festivals  
determined by this lunar calendar fall at  
different times each year with respect to  
the solar calendar. This is because the  
twelve lunar months are completed in  
about 354 solar days, and thus, each lunar  
year begins eleven days earlier than the  
last. About every 21⁄2years this discrepancy  
is corrected by the addition of an extra  
lunar month, known as the **intercalary**  
**month**, through which the solar and lunar  
calendars are kept in general correspondence. The intercalary month is added to  
any lunar month in which the sun does  
not enter a new sign of the zodiac and can  
thus fall in any month of the year. In this  
way, although the solar calendar is less  
important in everyday life, it helps maintain the general correspondence between  
the lunar calendar and the seasonal festivals associated with that calendar.  
At least in northern India, the three  
major **seasons** (hot, **monsoon**, and cool)  
have important links with the **festival**  
**calendar**. In general, the most ritually  
active time is the cool season between  
October and February; in many places  
this is also the time following the  
harvest, when many people have more  
time and money to spend on religious  
observances. The hot season has many  
rites associated with heat, whereas the  
rainy season, as a time of peril, is often  
connected with **rites of protection**.
