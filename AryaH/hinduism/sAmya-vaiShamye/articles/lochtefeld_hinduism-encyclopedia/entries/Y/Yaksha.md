title = "Yaksha"

+++
(feminine *yakshi*) A class of minor  
**deities** who are essentially nature spirits  
and are often narrowly associated with  
particular places. Yakshas are reckoned  
as the attendants of the **deity Kubera**,  
who is regarded as the guardian of the  
northern direction and the lord of  
wealth. The yakshas are generally  
regarded as beneficent toward human  
beings, and because of their associations with the generative power of  
nature and with Kuberaâ€™s wealth, they  
are often regarded as bestowing wealth  
and fertility. Yakshas have a long history  
of appearances in Indian sectarian literature, where they are either portrayed as  
guardian spirits or as examples of  
depravity. Although it is fairly old, the  
only extensive monograph on yakshas is  
Ananda Coomaraswamy, *Yaksas*, 1971.
