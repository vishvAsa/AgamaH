title = "Yajur Veda"

+++
Traditionally, the third of the four **Vedas**.  
As with the **Rg Veda** and the **Sama Veda**,  
the Yajur Veda was associated with sacrificial rituals, and the text itself consists  
mainly of the **mantras** to be uttered  
while the **sacrifice** was being carried  
out. The Yajur Veda exists in five major  
recensions, of which four are “black”  
and one is “white.” Their differences  
stem from the placement of explanatory  
notes on the mantras and their significance: The recensions of the **Black Yajur**  
**Veda** contain these notes in the text  
itself, whereas the **White Yajur Veda**  
gathers these notes into an appendix  
known as a **Brahmana**—namely, the  
**Shatapatha Brahmana**—and this  
Brahmana literature becomes the next  
major stratum of Vedic texts.
