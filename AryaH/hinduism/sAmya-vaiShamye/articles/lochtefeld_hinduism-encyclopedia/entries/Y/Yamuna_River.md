Northern Indian river rising at **Yamunotri** in the **Himalayas**, and flowing  
777  
Yamuna River  
Low fog hovers over the Yamuna River with the Taj Mahal in the distance.  
west and south of the **Ganges** River,  
which the Yamuna finally joins at  
**Allahabad** in the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. The Yamuna is traditionally  
considered one of the seven sacred  
rivers of India, along with the Ganges,  
**Godavari**, **Saraswati**, **Narmada**,  
**Indus**, and **Cauvery**. The Yamuna  
flows through the **Braj** region south of  
Delhi, which is traditionally associated as the homeland of **Krishna**, and  
his devotees (**bhakta**) revere it even  
more than the Ganges. For his devotees, places throughout the Braj  
region carry strong associations  
with the life of Krishna, but the most  
important sites are at **Mathura**  
and **Brindavan**.
