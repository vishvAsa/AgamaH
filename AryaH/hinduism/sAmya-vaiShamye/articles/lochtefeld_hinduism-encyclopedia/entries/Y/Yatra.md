(“journey”) Although in its literal meaning the word *yatra* can refer to any sort  
of travel, in modern **Hindi** its semantic  
field is considerably narrower and connotes travel with some serious purpose,  
rather than a stroll around the block or  
a sightseeing trip. The word yatra’s  
most important connotation is travel  
for religious purposes, particularly pilgrimage to the sacred sites (**tirthas**). A  
yatra is thus a journey, but a particular  
type of journey.
