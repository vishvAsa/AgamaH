title = "Yamunotri"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) in the **Himalayas**  
at the headwaters of the **Yamuna**  
**River**. Ritually speaking, Yamunotri is  
considered to be the source of the  
Yamuna, although the actual source  
lies farther upstream, at the foot of the  
Bandarpunch Mountain. Its high altitude also means that it is only accessible between late April and October,  
after which it is closed for the winter  
months—a pattern echoed at  
**Gangotri**, **Kedarnath**, and **Badrinath**,  
the other three major Himalayan pilgrim sites. One ritual center in  
Yamunotri is the river itself, in which  
pilgrims bathe (**snana**), braving the  
frigid waters. There are also several  
temples—the oldest built by one of  
the kings of **Nepal**—but the temples at  
Yamunotri are quite modest compared with those at **Gangotri**, and the  
only large one was built in the 1980s.  
Aside from the holy river and its temples, Yamunotri is also noted for several hot springs from which **water**  
emerges almost boiling; some of these  
hot springs have been channeled into  
a tank, and many pilgrims take advantage of the hot baths.
