title = "Yogini Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waning) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Ashadh** (Juneâ€“July). As for all the  
eleventh-day observances, this is  
dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**,  
particularly in his form as **Narayana**.  
Most Hindu festivals have certain  
prescribed rites, which usually involve  
fasting (**upavasa**) and worship and  
often promise specific benefits for  
faithful performance. On this day the  
prescribed action is to give gifts to  
poor brahmins; faithfully observing this  
festival washes away the sin of cutting  
down a pipal tree (**ashvattha**) and also  
brings one **birth** in **heaven**.
