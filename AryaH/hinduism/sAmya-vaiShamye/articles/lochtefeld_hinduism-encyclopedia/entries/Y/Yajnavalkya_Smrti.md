title = "Yajnavalkya Smrti"

+++
One of the **smrtis** or “remembered” texts, a  
class of literature deemed important but  
775  
Yajnavalkya Smrti  
less authoritative than the other textual  
category, the **shrutis** or “heard” texts. This  
smrti is ascribed to the sage **Yajnavalkya**  
and is an example of one of the **Dharma**  
**Shastras**, which were manuals prescribing  
rules for correct human behavior and ideal  
social life. Unlike the **Dharma Sutras**,  
which are ascribed to recognizable individuals, the Dharma Shastras are usually  
ascribed to mythic sages, as a strategy to  
reinforce the authority of these texts. The  
extant text is about a thousand verses,  
divided into sections on religious custom  
(**achara**), the administration of justice  
(vyavahara), and expiation (**prayashchitta**). Estimates on its date of composition range from the first to the sixth  
century, but it is clearly later than the  
**Manu Smrti** because some parts of the  
middle section are far more developed.  
The *Yajnavalkya Smrti* was the subject of  
numerous commentaries, one of which,  
the **Mitakshara**, was given the status of a  
legal code for the greater part of India during the British empire.
