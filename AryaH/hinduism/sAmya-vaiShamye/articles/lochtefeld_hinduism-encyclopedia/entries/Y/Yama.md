(2) In the **ashtanga** (“eight-part”) **yoga** first  
codified by **Patanjali** (1st c. C.E.?), yama  
(“restraint”) is the first and most basic of  
the eight constituent elements of yoga  
practice. Patanjali lists these as five:  
abstaining from harm to other living  
things (**ahimsa**), abstaining from theft,  
truthfulness, **celibacy** (**brahmacharya**),  
and abstaining from avarice. These can all  
be characterized as “restraints” because  
their intent is negative—they do not call  
for positive actions as much as they entail  
refraining from certain thoughts or actions  
deemed especially injurious.
