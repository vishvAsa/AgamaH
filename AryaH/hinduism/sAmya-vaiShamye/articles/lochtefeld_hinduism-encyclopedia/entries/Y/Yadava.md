title = "Yadava"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the tribe from which  
the god **Krishna** is said to have come and  
over which he ruled after he gained his  
kingdom in the city of **Dwaraka**. In Indian  
history, the Yadava dynasty controlled the  
**Deccan** region in modern **Maharashtra**  
between the thirteenth and fourteenth  
centuries. In northern Indian society, this  
is the name of a particular **jati**, an **endogamous** social subgroup that was organized (and whose social status was  
determined) by the group’s hereditary  
occupation. In past generations the  
Yadavas had fairly low status, but they  
have recently gained much greater political power—Mulayam Singh Yadav has  
twice been elected chief minister of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh** and has also served as India’s  
minister of Defense; Laloo Prasad Yadav  
has been the chief minister of **Bihar**  
(either directly or by proxy through his  
wife) throughout the 1990s.
