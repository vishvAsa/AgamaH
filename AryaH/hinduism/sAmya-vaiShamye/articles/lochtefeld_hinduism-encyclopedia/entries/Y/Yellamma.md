title = "Yellamma"

+++
Presiding **goddess** of the shrine on  
Yellama hill, in the town of Saundatti in  
780  
Yatri  
the Belgaum district of the state of  
**Karnataka**. Yellama’s temple is infamous for being a traditional center for  
the dedication of **devadasis** (“[female]  
servant of the Lord”), a class of **women**  
kept in temples as singers and dancers  
in the service of the temple’s presiding  
**deity** and to whom they were usually  
considered to be “married.” In Yellama’s  
temple, however, both boys and girls can  
be dedicated. Although for the past two  
centuries the **devadasi** tradition has carried associations with common **prostitution**, in earlier times it was far more  
common for a devadasi to live with a  
single man for her entire life, although  
she could not marry him because she  
was considered dedicated to the deity.  
At times this dedication is done  
because of a demand by the goddess  
herself, revealed through **possession**; in  
other cases the parents do this, hoping  
to gain some concrete benefit, particularly healing from disease. Yellamma is  
associated with **fire** and also with causing (and potentially curing) skin diseases, which can be seen as symbolic  
“burning.”  
According to the traditional model,  
devadasis held a definite social position  
and had special legal rights—they were  
entitled to family **inheritance** and to  
perform religious rites, which other  
women were not. These special rights  
have disappeared with the outlawing of  
the devadasi system, done, in part, by  
the British, and definitively in postIndependence India. Although such  
dedications still take place, in many  
cases they are little more than a cover for  
procurement, with the girls being  
shipped to brothels in Bombay, Pune,  
and other central Indian cities. In most  
cases the girls come from extremely  
poor families, and the dedication to  
Yellamma is a way to avoid paying for a  
wedding, a major expense in contemporary Indian society. The dedications take  
place on the **full moon** in the **lunar**  
**month** of **Magh** (January–February),  
and are reportedly widespread, but  
because of secrecy, the laws prohibiting this are rarely enforced. For further  
consideration of the devadasi system, in  
this case at the **Jagannath** temple in  
**Puri**, see Frederique Apffel Marglin,  
*Wives of the God-King*, 1985.
