(“patron of the **sacrifice**”) In the cult of  
sacrifice found in the **Vedas**, the oldest  
Hindu religious texts, the yajamana was  
the person who commissioned the sacrifice and paid for its performance, and  
who thus stood to gain its anticipated  
benefits. This term draws a crucial distinction between priest and patron and  
points to the relationship between  
them—the former were learned men  
and ritual technicians, who knew how to  
perform complex sacrificial rites, but  
they were dependent for their livelihood  
on the patronage of their sponsors.
