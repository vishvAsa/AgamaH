title = "Yudhishthira"

+++
(“firm in battle”) In the **Mahabharata**,  
the later of the two great Hindu epics,  
Yudhishthira is the eldest of the  
**Pandava** brothers who are the epic’s  
protagonists. Yudhishthira is magically  
born when his mother, **Kunti**, uses a  
powerful **mantra** to have a son by  
**Dharma**, the god of righteousness.  
Yudhishthira is in all ways his father’s  
son; he is described in the epic as the  
manifestation of Dharma on earth. He  
is proverbial for his strict adherence to  
the truth, is courteous to all, and is  
committed to righteousness. His only  
personal flaw is a love of **gambling**, a  
love matched only by his complete lack  
of gaming skill, and this flaw has major  
repercussions.  
Because of his virtues, Yudhishthira  
is selected as heir to the throne by his  
uncle, **Dhrtarashtra**. This choice raises  
the jealousy of Dhrtarashtra’s son,  
**Duryodhana**. He first tries to kill the  
Pandavas by building the flammable  
**house of lac**. The house is burned, but  
the Pandavas are able to escape  
unharmed. Some time later, Duryodhana  
decides to win Yudhishthira’s rights to  
the kingship in a game of dice. Here  
Yudhishthira’s love for gambling gets the  
better of his judgment, for he is playing  
against Duryodhana’s maternal uncle,  
**Shakuni**, who is very skilled. As Yudhishthira begins to lose, he keeps betting  
bigger and bigger stakes, in an effort to  
win back what he has lost. After losing  
their kingdom and all their possessions, Yudhishthira wagers himself and  
his brothers. After losing this bet, he  
wagers and loses the Pandava brothers’  
common wife, **Draupadi**. This loss  
leads to Draupadi’s humiliation, in  
which she is paraded through the  
assembly hall by Duryodhana and his  
brother, **Duhshasana**, her clothes  
stained with her menstrual **blood**. This  
event sharpens the already strong enmities between the two groups. Shocked at  
such treatment, Duryodhana’s father,  
King Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas  
back their freedom, but because of the  
loss in the game of dice, the Pandavas  
agree to go into exile for twelve years  
and live incognito for the thirteenth,  
with the condition that if they are  
discovered in the thirteenth year the  
cycle will begin anew.  
Yudhishthira and his brothers peacefully pass their twelve years in exile.  
During the thirteenth year, they live in the  
court of King **Virata**, where they remain  
undiscovered, despite frantic searching  
by Duryodhana’s spies. When the thirteen years have passed, Yudhishthira and  
his brothers return to claim their part of  
the kingdom. Yudhishthira hopes for  
some sort of peaceful settlement and  
sends a message to Duryodhana saying  
that they will be satisfied with a mere five  
villages, one for each brother. When  
Duryodhana responds that they will not  
get as much land as could fit under the  
point of a needle, Yudhishthira realizes  
that they will not get their rights without  
a battle. He reluctantly mobilizes his  
brothers for war. He fights valiantly in  
the great war and is crowned the king  
after their victory.  
After ruling for many years,  
Yudhishthira sets out with his brothers  
and their wife, Draupadi, for the  
**Himalayas**, followed by a small **dog**. As  
they climb the mountains Draupadi and  
his brothers die one by one, but the dog  
remains with Yudhishthira. At the top of  
the Himalayas Yudhishthira finds the  
god **Indra**, the king of **heaven**, waiting  
for him in a golden chariot. Indra tells  
Yudhishthira that he will take him to  
heaven but that Yudhishthira will have  
784  
Yoni  
to leave the dog behind. Yudhishthira  
flatly refuses to abandon his faithful  
companion, even if it means that he will  
not go to heaven. The dog then reveals  
himself to be the god Dharma in disguise. The lesson in this story is that  
throughout his life Yudhishthira never  
allows himself to stray far from righteousness; even at the end he refuses to  
forsake it.
