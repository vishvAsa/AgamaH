title = "Yajnavalkya"

+++
In the **Upanishads**, the speculative texts  
that form the latest textual stratum in  
the **Veda**, Yajnavalkya is named as a sage  
associated with the court of King  
**Janaka**, who was able to show that he  
had greater wisdom than the others. He  
is also ascribed as the author of the  
**Yajnavalkya Smrti**, one of the texts that  
comprise the **dharma literature**, based  
on the pattern of mythic ascription  
found in these texts.
