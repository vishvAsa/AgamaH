title = "Yaska"

+++
(5th c. B.C.E.?) Traditionally cited as  
the author of the **Nirukta**, a text giving etymological explanations for  
archaic words in the **Veda**. Almost a  
quarter of the words in the Veda  
appear only once. Even by Yaska’s  
778  
Yamunotri  
time, the meanings for many of these  
words had become either uncertain or  
completely lost, as the spoken language had changed. Although at times  
it is clear that Yaska himself is guessing—as when modern linguists  
can make comparisons to the Iranian  
*Avesta*, a related sacred text—his  
work was immeasurably helpful to  
later readers.
