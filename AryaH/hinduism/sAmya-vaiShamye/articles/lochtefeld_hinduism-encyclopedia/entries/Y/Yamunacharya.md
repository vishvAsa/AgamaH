title = "Yamunacharya"

+++
(10th c.) According to tradition, a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, who is  
claimed to be the grandson of **Nathamuni**,  
and the teacher of **Ramanuja**. Nathamuni  
was the compiler of the **Nalayira**  
**Divyaprabandham**, the collected hymns  
of the **Alvars**, a group of poet-saints who  
lived in southern India between the seventh and the tenth centuries. All the Alvars  
were devotees of Vishnu, and they  
expressed this devotion in passionate  
hymns sung in the **Tamil language**; among  
southern Indian **Vaishnavas** (devotees of  
Vishnu), these hymns are so holy that they  
are referred to as the “Tamil **Veda**.”  
Ramanuja, on the other hand, was a  
philosopher who organized and systematized this devotional outpouring into a  
coherent philosophical position and thus  
is considered the founder of the  
**Shrivaishnava** religious community.  
It is generally believed that Yamunacharya was Nathamuni’s grandson, and  
thus he was heir to the religious tradition his grandfather had helped create.  
There is much more doubt about the  
claim that he was Ramanuja’s religious  
preceptor (**guru**) because it seems more  
likely that Yamuna’s influence on  
Ramanuja was transmitted by Yamuna’s  
disciples. Still, what is indisputable is  
that these three are the three main figures in the development of the **Shrivaishnava** tradition, and thus that  
Yamunacharya occupies a pivotal spot.
