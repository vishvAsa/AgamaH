(b. Mukunda Lal Ghosh 1893–1952)  
Modern Hindu teacher and founder of  
the Self-Realization Fellowship. Yogananda was one of the earliest Hindu  
missionaries to come to America. He  
came to Boston in 1920, to address the  
International Congress of Religious  
Liberals in Boston and never returned  
to India. He eventually settled outside  
Los Angeles, where he established a  
center and lived for the rest of his life. In  
his early years in America he was considered something of a curiosity, and  
there are photos of him taken with  
President Calvin Coolidge. Yogananda’s  
teachings were largely based in the **ashtanga yoga** of the classical **Yoga Sutras**,  
but he also stressed the doctrine of kriya  
(“active”) yoga, which is claimed to  
accelerate spiritual attainment. Most of  
Yogananda’s disciples and both his successors were Americans, and the SelfRealization Fellowship is essentially an  
American organization with historical  
roots in India. For further information  
see Paramahansa Yogananda’s *Autobiography of a Yogi*, 1997.
