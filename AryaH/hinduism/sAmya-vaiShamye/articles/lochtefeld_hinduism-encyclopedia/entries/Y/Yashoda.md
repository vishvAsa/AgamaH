title = "Yashoda"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the god  
**Krishna’s** foster mother, who receives  
him on the night he is born, and cares  
for him until he is old enough to  
return to **Mathura** to claim his throne.  
Yashoda is a paradigm for selfless  
devotion, who loves Krishna as if he is  
her own biological child. Her mythic  
example of loving, motherly care has  
provided the model for **vatsalya**  
**bhava**, one of the five **modes of devotion** most prominently articulated by  
**Rupa Goswami**, a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Krishna** and a follower of the  
Bengali saint **Chaitanya**. In the vatsalya mode of devotion, devotees consider themselves as God’s parents,  
lavishing love and care on the **deity** as  
a **cow** cares for her calf.
