title = "Yati"

+++
(from **Sanskrit** *yam*, “to restrain”) From  
the time of the **Vedas**, the earliest Hindu  
religious texts, the word *yati* has been  
one of the terms used to designate an  
**ascetic**, as someone who had gained  
control over himself. At the time of the  
Vedas there seems to be some ambivalence for the yatis, since the storm-god  
**Indra** is said to have fought with them,  
but in later times the word takes on an  
unequivocally positive connotation.
