(“sleep of **yoga**”) Epithet of the **Goddess**  
in the first episode of the **Devimahatmya**, the earliest and most authoritative text for the mythology of the  
Goddess. In this episode, the Goddess  
has lulled **Vishnu** into a stupor through  
her power of illusion, making him  
oblivious to **Brahma’s** cries for help  
when he is menaced by the **demons**  
**Madhu** and **Kaitabha**. Brahma is saved  
when he praises the Goddess, after  
which she withdraws her yogic sleep  
from Vishnu; he then regains consciousness and rescues Brahma by  
killing the demons.
