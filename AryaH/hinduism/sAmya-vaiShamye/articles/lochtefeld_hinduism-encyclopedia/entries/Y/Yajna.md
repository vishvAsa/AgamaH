(“**sacrifice**”) A **fire** sacrifice, which was the  
primary religious act in the earliest stratum of Indian religion. This cult of sacrifice is elaborated in the greatest detail in  
the **Brahmana** literature, in which sacrifice is portrayed as the means by which  
the universe came into being. The performance of sacrifice needed highly trained  
priestly technicians (**rtvij**), who were differently responsible for chanting parts of  
the **Rg**, **Sama**, and **Yajur Vedas**, as well as  
building and maintaining the sacred fire  
that was the heart of the sacrificial action.  
This cult of sacrifice was essentially based  
on burning things in this sacred fire, conceived as the god **Agni**, so that Agni could  
convey the **offerings** to the other **deities**.  
These rites were so elaborate and expensive that they eventually fell into disuse; by  
the turn of the common era, there was  
also considerable ambivalence about the  
**animal sacrifices** that were originally an  
important part of many of these sacrifices.  
These ancient rites are rarely performed  
today, but in the present context the word  
*yajna* can be used for any rite involving  
the sacred fire, particularly one carried out  
by a **brahmin** for a patron.
