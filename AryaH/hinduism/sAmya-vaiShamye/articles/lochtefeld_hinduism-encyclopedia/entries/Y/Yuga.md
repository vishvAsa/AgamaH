title = "Yuga"

+++
A name denoting a unit of **cosmic time**,  
with two possible meanings. According  
to traditional belief, time has neither  
beginning nor end, but alternates  
between cycles of creation and activity,  
followed by cessation and quietude.  
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion  
years, with the active phase known as  
the **Day of Brahma**, and the quiet phase  
the Night of Brahma. In cosmic time,  
the Day of Brahma is divided into one  
thousand **mahayugas** (“great cosmic  
ages”), each of which lasts for 4.32  
million years, and this is one possible  
meaning of the word *yuga*. The more  
common use is to refer to a **mahayuga’s**  
four constituent yugas, named the **Krta**  
**Yuga**, **Treta Yuga**, **Dvapara Yuga**, and  
**Kali Yuga**.
