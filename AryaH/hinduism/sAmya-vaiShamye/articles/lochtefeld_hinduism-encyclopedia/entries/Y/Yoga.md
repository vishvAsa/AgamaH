The literal meaning of the word *yoga* is  
“the act of joining,” and it is cognate  
with the English word “yoke.” Just as the  
latter word can serve as either a verb or  
a noun—either the act of yoking, or the  
thing to which animals are yoked—in  
the same way the word yoga can refer  
both to the act or process of spiritual  
development and also to a specific set of  
teachings fostering this development.  
Both these meanings can be conveyed  
by the word “discipline,” and this is one  
of the preferred translations.  
There are many specific teachings  
styling themselves as yogas. The oldest  
one is laid out in the **Yoga Sutras** attributed to the sage **Patanjali**; this system is  
known as **ashtanga** (“eight-limbed”)  
**yoga**, because of its eight constituent  
parts. Other well-known yogas are the  
three “paths” described by the god  
**Krishna** in the **Bhagavad Gita**, an  
important religious text: the yogas of  
action (**karma**), wisdom (**jnana**), and  
devotion (**bhakti**). Another well-known  
yoga is **kundalini yoga**, the practice of  
which is entirely internal, in the alternate physiological system known as the  
**subtle body**. Kundalini yoga stresses  
awakening the kundalini, the latent  
spiritual power that exists in every person, and through this gaining spiritual  
benefits. These make up the main categories of teachings, but the members of  
many particular religious communities  
will describe their religious practice  
as yoga: Thus there is the **surat-shabdyoga** of the **Radha Soamis**, the Raja  
Yoga of the **Brahma Kumaris**, or the  
**Siddha** Yoga of the **SYDA** Foundation.  
In such cases the word is used to  
identify a particular religious group’s  
characteristic teaching, which usually  
includes elements from the classical  
articulations of yoga.
