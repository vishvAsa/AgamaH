title = "Yoga Sutras"

+++
(“aphorisms on **yoga**”) A set of brief sayings traditionally ascribed to the sage  
**Patanjali**, which are the foundational  
texts for the Yoga school, one of the **six**  
**schools** of traditional Hindu **philosophy**. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are usually  
read with a commentary ascribed to the  
sage **Vyasa**, and this commentary has  
become accepted as an integral part of  
the text. The text of the Yoga Sutras is  
divided into four parts, with each part  
devoted to a particular theme: The first  
part focuses on concentration (**samadhi**),  
the second part on the mechanics of  
spiritual development (**sadhana**), the  
third part treats various attainments  
(**vibhuti**), including **magic** powers (**siddhi**), and the last part describes the state  
of yogic isolation (**kaivalya**), which the  
text describes as liberation. The text presupposes the **cosmology** taught by the  
**Samkhya** school, another of the six  
schools, and the Yoga school is often  
considered the “practical” articulation  
of Samkhya theory.
