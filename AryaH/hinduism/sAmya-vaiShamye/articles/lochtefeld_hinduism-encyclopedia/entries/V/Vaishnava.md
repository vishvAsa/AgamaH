title = "Vaishnava"

+++
Name denoting a devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Vishnu**, in any of his myriad  
forms. Vaishnava theology is most  
prominently characterized by the doctrine of the ten **avatars**, or divine incarnations: **Fish**, **Tortoise**, **Boar**, **Man-Lion**,  
**Vamana** (dwarf), **Parashuram**, **Rama**,  
**Krishna**, **Buddha**, and **Kalki**. It is generally accepted that the avatar doctrine  
provided a way to assimilate smaller  
regional **deities** into the larger pantheon  
by designating them as forms of Vishnu,  
and it is in the form of these avatars that  
Vishnu is most commonly worshiped.  
Of the ten avatars, the two most important ones have been Rama and  
Krishna, although in the early centuries of the common era, the Boar  
avatar and the Man-Lion avatar were  
influential regional deities.  
Early Vaishnava religion is cloudy  
and mysterious. Although Vishnu  
appears in several hymns in the **Vedas**,  
the oldest Hindu religious texts, he was  
clearly a minor deity, and it is difficult to  
get from there to being the supreme  
power in the universe. Some scholars  
have speculated that the cult of  
Krishna—a deified local cowherd  
hero—originally came from outside  
the Vedic religious matrix, and that  
Krishna was identified with Vishnu as a  
way to assimilate Krishna’s cult into  
respectable Vedic religion. Such ideas  
are intriguing but have little hard evidence to support them. Inscriptional  
evidence clearly shows that the **worship**  
of Krishna was well-established by the  
first century B.C.E. These devotees are  
generally described as **Bhagavatas**  
(“devotees of the Blessed One”), a name  
that for the next thousand years is used  
to refer to Vaishnavas in general. One  
particular subset of this early Bhagavata  
community was known as the  
Pancharatrikas (“followers of the  
**Pancharatra**”), who later evolved distinctive cosmological doctrines. These  
mainstream Bhagavatas expressed their  
devotion to Krishna by composing texts,  
including parts of the **Bhagavad Gita**,  
the **Harivamsha**, and various **puranas**,  
culminating with the **Bhagavata**  
**Purana** in about the tenth century.  
The tone of Vaishnava devotion took  
a dramatic turn with the advent of the  
731  
Vaishnava  
**Alvars**, a group of twelve devotional  
(**bhakti**) poet-saints who lived in southern India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. Singing their hymns in the  
**Tamil language**, the vernacular tongue  
of their times, the Alvars propounded a  
bhakti that was marked by passionate  
devotion to God and characterized by a  
profound emotional attachment  
between deity and devotee. Along with  
their **Shaiva** counterparts, the  
**Nayanars**, the Alvars spearheaded the  
revitalization of Hindu religion *vis-à-vis*  
the Buddhists and the Jains, and in the  
process, transformed the tradition as the  
devotional wave they had begun moved  
northward. The period between the  
twelfth and sixteenth centuries saw the  
development of various Vaishnava communities, often stemming from a particular charismatic religious figure.  
This process began in southern  
India, where the philosopher **Ramanuja**  
(11th c.) founded the **Shrivaishnava**  
community, while the philosopher  
**Madhva** (1197–1276) founded the community that bears his name. The next  
great center was in **Maharashtra**, particularly in the **Varkari Panth**, which  
was centered on the temple of **Vithoba**  
in **Pandharpur**; some of this community’s greatest figures were **Jnaneshvar**  
(1275–1296?), **Namdev** (1270–1350),  
**Chokamela** (d. 1338), **Eknath** (1533–  
1599), and **Tukaram** (1598–1650). The  
Maharashtra region also saw the rise of  
the **Mahanubhav** sect, from the thirteenth century. At **Puri** on India’s eastern coast one finds the worship of  
**Jagannath**, a tribal deity assimilated  
into the pantheon as a form of  
Krishna. This was well established by  
the twelfth century, as the poet  
**Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda** clearly shows.  
Finally, in northern India one finds several vibrant religious groups. A very early  
figure is the twelfth-century philosopher  
**Nimbarka**, whose **Nimbarki** community  
bears his name; several centuries later  
came **Vishnuswami**, about whom little  
is known. The greatest explosion of  
northern Indian devotionalism came  
in the sixteenth century, with the  
philosopher **Vallabhacharya** founding  
the **Pushti Marg**, the Bengali saint  
**Chaitanya** founding the **Gaudiya**  
**Vaishnava** community, and the poetsaint **Harivamsh** (d. 1552) founding the  
**Radhavallabh** community. All these  
were based in the **Braj** region that is  
Krishna’s mythic home, and all of them  
worshiped Krishna: The Pushti Marg  
and the Gaudiya Vaishnavas considered  
him to be the supreme divinity, whereas  
the Nimbarkis and the Radhavallabh  
community worshiped him in conjunction with his consort **Radha**, whom they  
considered Krishna’s wife and equal. It is  
also in northern India that the worship  
of Rama has its deepest roots, as exemplified in the songs of the poet-saint  
**Tulsidas** (1532–1623?). Many of these  
schools with long histories are still vital  
in modern times.  
The final Vaishnava community that  
must be addressed is comprised of  
**ascetics**. Vaishnava **asceticism** is a more  
recent development than that of the  
Shaivas (though dates are uncertain),  
and it is largely located in the northern  
part of India (the Shaivas are spread  
throughout the country). Vaishnava  
ascetics are known as **Bairagis** (“dispassionate”) and are primarily organized  
into four **sampradays** (religious sects  
distinguished by unique bodies of  
teachings), each connected with a major  
Vaishnava figure. By far the most powerful is the **Shri Sampraday** of the  
**Ramanandi** ascetics, which traces its  
spiritual lineage through the poet-saint  
**Ramananda** to the southern Indian  
philosopher Ramanuja, whom they  
claim was Ramananda’s **guru**. The  
**Sanaka Sampraday** of the Nimbarki  
ascetics traces its spiritual lineage to the  
philosopher Nimbarka. The **Rudra**  
**Sampraday** of the Vishnuswami ascetics  
traces its lineage through the philosopher Vallabhacharya to an earlier figure,  
Vishnuswami. Finally, the **Brahma**  
**Sampraday**, an ascetic subset of the  
Gaudiya Vaishnava ascetics, traces its  
spiritual line through the Bengali saint  
Chaitanya to the southern Indian  
philosopher Madhva.

Each of these sampradays is differentiated not only by its founder, but also by  
its tutelary deity or deities. The  
Ramanandis **worship** the god Rama,  
whereas the others worship the god  
Krishna and his consort Radha, but differ in the position that they give to  
Radha. Scholars have noted that these  
historical claims are either highly suspect or completely spurious and that the  
distinctions among the sampradays are  
largely academic. Given that the overwhelming majority of these ascetics are  
Ramanandis, the others seem important  
only for symbolic reasons, to include a  
representative from each of the great  
Vaishnava religious figures.
