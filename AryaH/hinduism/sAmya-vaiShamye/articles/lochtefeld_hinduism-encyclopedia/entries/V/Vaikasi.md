Second month in the **Tamil year**, corresponding to the northern Indian solar  
month of Vrshabha (the zodiacal sign of  
Taurus), which usually falls within May  
and June. This name is a modification of  
**Baisakh**, the second month in the lunar  
**calendar**. The existence of several different calendars is one clear sign of the  
continuing importance of regional cultural patterns. One way that the Tamils  
retain their culture is by preserving their  
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the  
few regional languages in India with an  
ancient, well-established literary tradition. See also **Tamil language**, **Tamil**  
**months**, and **Tamil Nadu**.
