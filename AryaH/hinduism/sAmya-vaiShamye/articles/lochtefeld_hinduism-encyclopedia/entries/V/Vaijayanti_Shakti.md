title = "Vaijayanti Shakti"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, this is the name of an  
all-conquering weapon that the stormgod **Indra** gives to the warrior **Karna**.  
Karna has been born wearing earrings  
and a suit of armor, and Karnaâ€™s father,  
the **sun**-god **Surya**, has ordained that as  
long as Karna wears these, he cannot be  
harmed. Indra gains them from Karna  
by taking the guise of a **brahmin**, and  
**begging** for them as alms from Karna,  
who is famous for his generosity.  
Despite being warned in a **dream**,  
Karna cannot bring himself to refuse  
and gives them to Indra. When Indra  
gives him a boon in return, Karna asks  
for the Vaijayanti Shakti. Karna keeps  
this weapon in reserve to kill his nemesis, **Arjuna**, but is forced to use it  
against another mighty warrior,  
**Ghatotkacha**, when the latter proves  
unconquerable during the Mahabharata  
war. The loss of this weapon leaves  
Karna at a disadvantage against Arjuna,  
and Karna is eventually killed.
