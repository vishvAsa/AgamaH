title = "Virabhadra"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a powerful being  
who is created by the god **Shiva** to humble the demigod **Daksha** and to destroy  
Daksha’s **sacrifice**. Daksha gives his  
**daughter**, **Sati**, to marry Shiva, but later  
he feels that Shiva has not shown him  
proper respect. To humble Shiva,  
Daksha plans a great sacrifice and  
invites all the gods except Shiva. When  
Sati asks her father why he has done so,  
Daksha responds with a stream of  
abuse, excoriating Shiva as worthless  
and despicable. Humiliated by these  
public insults, Sati commits **suicide**—in  
some versions, by leaping into the sacrificial **fire**, and in others by withdrawing  
into a yogic trance and giving up her life.  
In the most common version of  
Virabhadra’s creation, Shiva is so  
enraged when he learns of Sati’s death  
that he tears out two matted locks (**jata**)  
from his head and dashes them to the  
ground. One matted lock takes form as  
Virabhadra, and the second takes form  
as **Bhadrakali**, a powerful and terrifying  
form of the **Goddess**. Just as Virabhadra  
represents Shiva’s destructive aspect,  
Bhadrakali represents the ferocious and  
dangerous side of the Goddess, in contrast with the gentle and loyal Sati. At  
Shiva’s orders, the two demolish  
Daksha’s sacrifice, scattering the guests  
and destroying the sacred fires, until  
Daksha finally repents and worships  
Shiva as the supreme **deity**. Although  
Virabhadra’s actions in this story are  
destructive, he is and remains Shiva’s  
servant, carrying out his divine master’s  
commands, a mandate that ultimately  
upholds the created order.
