title = "Vachaspati Mishra"

+++
(ca. late 15th c.) Commentator and compiler of the **dharma literature**. He composed dozens of texts in his working life,  
including a number of digests (**nibandha**)  
organized around various subjects,  
including daily religious rites, purification, **pilgrimage**, death rites (**antyeshthi**  
**samskara**), political life, judicial procedures, and funeral rites. In these digests  
Mishra would draw material relating to  
the theme from a number of different  
religious texts, weigh them, and sometimes interpret their position on a religious issue. Mishra was much respected  
for his learning and piety, and his texts  
were an important resource to those  
who followed him.
