title = "Vicious Circle"

+++
In Indian logic, one of the **fallacies** to be  
avoided in constructing an argument. A  
vicious circle occurs when a series of  
things stand in a cause-and-effect relationship to one another, with any one of  
them standing as both cause and effect.  
For example, when “a” causes “b,” and  
“b” causes “c,” (somewhere down the  
line) “x” causes “a.” This is seen as an  
extended case of **self-residence**—saying  
that “a” is both cause and effect—and is  
equally objectionable.
