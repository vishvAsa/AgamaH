title = "study‚Äù) Samskara"

+++
Traditionally, the tenth of the life-cycle  
ceremonies (**samskaras**), in which the  
child begins formal education, usually  
by starting to learn the alphabet.  
Although people in modern India may  
not perform this rite according to its  
prescribed form (which includes making **offerings** to a sacrificial **fire** and giving gifts to **brahmins**), families in which  
education is taken seriously usually  
have a ritualized commencement of  
study, often when the child is as young  
as three.
