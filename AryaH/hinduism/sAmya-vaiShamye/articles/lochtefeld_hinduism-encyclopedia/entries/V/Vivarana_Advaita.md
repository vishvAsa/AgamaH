title = "Vivarana Advaita"

+++
One of the later schools of **Advaita**  
**Vedanta**, a philosophical school, the greatest figure in which was **Shankaracharya**.  
The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism, which is  
the belief in a single impersonal Ultimate  
Reality, which they call **Brahman**. For  
Advaita proponents, reality is “nondual”  
(**advaita**)—that is, all things are nothing  
but the formless Brahman, despite the  
appearance of difference and diversity in  
the perceivable world. For the Advaitins,  
this assumption of diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate  
nature of things and a manifestation  
of **avidya**. Although often translated as  
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood  
as the lack of genuine understanding,  
which ultimately causes human beings  
to be trapped in karmic bondage,  
reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
Because the real problem for the  
Advaitins is this mistaken understanding,  
this means that realization (**jnana**)  
was the best spiritual path to gain final  
liberation (**moksha**).  
The Vivarana Advaita school is based  
on the thought of **Padmapada** (9th c.),  
one of Shankaracharya’s disciples,  
but takes its name from a commentary  
written by the thirteenth-century  
**Prakashatman**. The latter is traditionally  
a disciple of Padmapada’s, but this seems  
problematic. As with the **Bhamati**  
school, the Vivarana school took definitive stands on several points on which  
Shankaracharya had remained silent.  
One of these was on the locus of ignorance, which the Vivarana school  
describes as being located in Brahman.  
In explaining how this can be, since it  
seems to compromise the integrity of  
Brahman, the Vivarana Advaitins invoke  
the theory of **reflectionism** to explain the  
apparent difference between Brahman  
and the Self, although, in fact, the Selves  
are identical with Brahman. Their position seems based more than anything on  
an uncompromising affirmation of  
Brahman as the sole “reality,” in which  
anything that exists must belong to it.
