title = "Vidura"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the son of the sage  
**Vyasa** and the serving maid of Queen  
**Ambika**. Ambika and her sister  
**Ambalika** are the wives of King  
**Vichitravirya**, who has died without  
heirs. In a desperate attempt to save  
the lineage, Vichitravirya’s mother,  
**Satyavati**, summons her son, **Vyasa**, to  
sleep with his brother’s two wives.  
Ambika and Ambalika both spontaneously recoil from Vyasa, and each of  
their **sons** is born with a defect:  
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son  
**Pandu** to be born with an unnaturally  
pale complexion; Ambika covers her  
eyes,causing her son **Dhrtarashtra** to be  
born blind. Ambika is so repulsed by  
Vyasa’s appearance that when she is told  
to sleep with him again, she sends her  
serving maid instead. In contrast to the  
two sisters, Ambika’s maid gives herself  
willingly to Vyasa, and as a reward delivers a handsome son named Vidura.  
According to one legend, Vidura is a  
partial **avatar** of **Dharma**, the god who  
is righteousness personified. Vidura  
always shows his righteousness in his  
dealings with the **Pandavas** and the  
**Kauravas**, the epic’s two warring factions. As the Kauravas become more and  
more wicked, this inclines him more  
toward the Pandavas, for whom he  
serves as a trusted and faithful adviser. It  
is Vidura who realizes the danger in the  
**House of Lac**—a house built entirely of  
highly flammable materials—and  
makes arrangements for the Pandavas  
to escape from it. During the **Mahabharata** war, he remains neutral, but  
after the war is over he again serves as  
an adviser to King **Yudhishthira**, the  
eldest of the Pandavas, and to  
Yudhishthira’s brothers.
