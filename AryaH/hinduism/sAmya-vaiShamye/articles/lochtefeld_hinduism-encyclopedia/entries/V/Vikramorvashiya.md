+++
(“**Urvashi** won by valor”) Drama written  
by the poet **Kalidasa**, generally considered the greatest classical **Sanskrit** poet.  
The *Vikramorvashiya* is a musical play in  
five acts, whose mythic theme is the liaison of King **Pururavas** and the celestial  
nymph Urvashi, a story mentioned both  
in **Rg Veda** 1.95 and in the **Shatapatha**  
**Brahmana**. In both these earlier sources  
the story ends unhappily, with the separation of Urvashi and Pururavas, but in  
Kalidasa’s version the estranged lovers are  
finally happily reunited. This change may  
have been prompted solely from the  
desire for a happy ending, which is one of  
the most characteristic features of  
Sanskrit drama.
