(1479–1531) Philosopher, teacher, and  
founder of the religious community  
known as the **Pushti Marg**. Vallabhacharya propounded a philosophical  
position called **Shuddadvaita** (“pure  
non-dualism”), in which the Ultimate  
Reality was conceived as personalized,  
in the form of **Krishna**, rather than the  
impersonal **Brahman** propounded by  
the **Advaita Vedanta** school. Since  
Vallabhacharya had personalized his  
conception of the Supreme Reality, the  
supreme religious goal was conceived in  
terms of relationship with that divine  
person. This stress on devotion was  
soon articulated in elaborately arranged  
forms of image **worship** in the Pushti  
Marg’s temples. The devotees (**bhakta**)  
would visualize themselves as Krishna’s  
companions during his daily activities—waking, **eating**, taking the **cows**  
to graze, coming home, etc.—and thus  
gain the opportunity to take part in the  
divine play (**lila**). This emphasis on  
visualization and participation was  
fostered through the development of  
vast liturgical resources, which were  
composed by eight poets (the **ashtachap**) who were associated with  
Vallabhacharya and **Vitthalnath**, his  
**son** and successor. For further information see R.K. Barz, *The Bhakti Sect of*  
*Vallabhacarya,* 1976.
