(“[He whose] Lord is **Vishnu**”)  
According to tradition, the founder of  
the **Rudra Sampraday** of the **Vaishnava**  
760  
Vishnuchittar  
ascetics. (The Rudra Sampraday is one  
of the four branches, “sampraday,” of  
the **Bairagi Naga** ascetics, who are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god Vishnu; vaishnava refers to devotees of Vishnu.)  
Vishnuswami was an **ascetic**, whom  
some sources name as the **guru** of both  
**Jnaneshvar** and **Namdev**. As his name  
clearly shows, Vishnuswami was a  
Vaishnava, although other than this little is known about him. His ascetic line  
and its position as one of the four  
Vaishnava ascetic sampradays have  
been appropriated by the followers of  
**Vallabhacharya**, whose **Shuddadvaita**,  
or “Pure Monism,” stresses the **worship**  
of **Krishna**, with **Radha** as his consort.
