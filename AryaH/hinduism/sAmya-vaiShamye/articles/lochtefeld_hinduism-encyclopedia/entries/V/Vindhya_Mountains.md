title = "Vindhya Mountains"

+++
Mountain range running from east to  
west in central India. Despite their  
modest height, they have traditionally  
served as the cultural dividing line  
between northern and southern India.  
The Vindhyas themselves were seen as  
an uncivilized and potentially dangerous place, inhabited by **ghosts**,  
**demons**, and tribal peoples; these  
dangers were exemplified by the  
untamed nature of its presiding **goddess**, **Vindhyavasini**.
