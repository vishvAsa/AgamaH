title = "Vaishno Devi"

+++
Presiding **goddess** of the Vaishno Devi  
shrine, located in a cave on Trikut  
mountain in the hills near **Jammu**, and  
one of the nine **Shiwalik goddesses**.  
Pilgrims to Vaishno Devi travel by road  
via Jammu to the village of Katra,  
whence they walk the ten miles to the  
shrine itself. As with many of the images  
of the Shiwalik goddesses, the images at  
Vaishno Devi are “self-manifested”  
(**svayambhu**), in the form of three stone  
outcrops. These outcrops are considered to be **Mahakali**, **Mahalakshmi**,  
and **Mahasaraswati**, the three forms  
of the Goddess mentioned in the  
**Devimahatmya**, the earliest and most  
authoritative source for the mythology  
of the Goddess. The presence of all three  
goddesses is believed to make this site  
extremely powerful, and according to  
popular belief, Vaishno Devi grants  
whatever request her devotees (**bhakta**)  
make. According to some accounts,  
those whose wishes are granted are  
highly advised to make a second trip,  
both to thank the Goddess and to bear  
witness to her **grace**. The number of visitors to the site has increased dramatically in the recent past, perhaps  
reflecting anxieties about modern  
Indian life.  
There are several stories connected  
with Vaishno Devi’s charter myth. The  
name *Vaishno* is a derivation of **Vishnu**,  
reflecting the claim that Vaishno Devi  
was born as a partial **avatar** of Vishnu.  
One sign of this connection is that  
Vaishno Devi is a vegetarian goddess, for  
whom no **animal sacrifices** can be performed. According to another story,  
Vaishno Devi was the spot at which the  
arms of the dismembered goddess **Sati**  
fell to **earth**. Since this story is never further connected to Vaishno Devi, this  
seems a transparent attempt to tie into  
the network of the **Shakti Pithas**, a  
group of shrines sacred to the Goddess,  
which stretch throughout the subcontinent. The longest version of the charter  
myth reports that the cave is discovered  
by a **brahmin** named Shridhara.  
Shridhara, a great devotee of the  
Goddess (who tested him in various  
ways), is disturbed by the fact that he  
has no children. The Goddess reveals  
the location of the Vaishno Devi cave to  
him in a **dream**. After an extensive  
search he finally finds the cave and is  
soon blessed with four **sons**, emphasizing the claim that Vaishno Devi will  
grant the desires of her devotees, whatever they may be. For further information see Kathleen Erndl, *Victory to the*  
*Mother*, 1993. See also **pitha**.
