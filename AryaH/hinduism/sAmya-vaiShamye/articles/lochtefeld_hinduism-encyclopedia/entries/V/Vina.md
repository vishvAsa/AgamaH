Vina  
The vina is a classical Indian musical instrument.  
large hollow gourd projecting from  
the back, which further amplifies the  
sound. The vina is one of the classical  
musical instruments, particularly in  
southern India, where its mastery is  
still held in high regard. In Indian  
iconography, the vina is most strongly  
associated with the **goddess Saraswati**, in keeping with her identity as  
the patron **deity** of the arts, culture,  
and learning.
