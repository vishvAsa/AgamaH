In Hindu astrology (**jyotisha**), a planet  
associated with love and pleasure. It is  
considered a strong planet, with pronounced benevolent qualities, although  
like all the other **planets**, its powers will  
vary according to context. Venus presides over **Friday**, and its positive qualities make this an auspicious **day**.
