title = "Vayu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the **deity** who is  
**wind** personified. Vayu is a minor deity  
who is one of the eight **Guardians of the**  
**Directions**; his direction is the northwest. Aside from being the external  
winds, Vayu is also believed to be present inside the body, in the five “**vital**  
**winds**” (**prana**) through which all physiological processes are believed to occur.  
Although Vayu is a minor deity, two of  
his **sons** are extremely significant. His  
son, **Bhima**, is one of the five **Pandava**  
brothers who are the protagonists in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
**Sanskrit** epics. Bhima is famous for his  
size and strength, and also for his earthy  
appetites, both of which reflect the  
wind’s raw, uncontrollable nature. Vayu’s  
other famous son is the monkey-god,  
**Hanuman**. Even though mythically  
Hanuman is most famous for his devotion and service to the god **Rama**, in  
practical terms he is one of the most  
popular and widely worshiped deities in  
northern India. This popularity may  
stem from his intermediate status;  
because Hanuman is also a servant, he  
is less remote and majestic than Rama  
and, therefore, accessible to human  
petitions. Another important factor is  
that this accessibility is coupled with  
power and the ability to protect those  
who call on him.
