(“clothing”) The seventh of the sixteen  
traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”)  
given to a **deity** as part of **worship**, on  
the model of treating the deity as an  
honored guest. In this offering, the deity  
is offered clothing, either through symbolic presentation or through physically  
dressing the image. The underlying  
motive here, as for all the upacharas, is  
to show one’s love for the deity and minister to the deity’s needs.
