The latest of the **six schools** in traditional  
Hindu **philosophy**. The name Vedanta  
literally means “the end of the Vedas,”  
and reflects their contention that they  
were revealing the ultimate meaning of  
these sacred texts. Vedanta proponents  
gave particular attention to the  
**Upanishads**, which were also the latest  
stratum of Vedic texts, and thus their  
“end” in a different sense. These texts  
have served as authoritative sources for  
several major schools, with widely differing philosophical positions. The best  
known and most important of these is  
the **Advaita Vedanta** school, propounded  
by the philosopher **Shankaracharya**  
and his followers. The Advaita school  
upholds a philosophical position known  
as monism, which is the belief in a single  
impersonal Ultimate Reality that they  
call **Brahman**. For Advaita proponents,  
reality is thus “nondual” (advaita)—that  
is, all things are nothing but the  
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite  
the appearance of difference and  
diversity. For the Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is a fundamental  
misunderstanding of the ultimate  
nature of things and a manifestation of  
**avidya**. Although often translated as  
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood  
as the lack of genuine understanding,  
which causes human beings to be  
trapped in karmic bondage, reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
Whereas the Advaita school conceives  
of this Ultimate Reality in abstract impersonal terms, the other Vedanta schools  
are theistic—that is, they conceive the  
Ultimate Reality as a personal God,  
namely the god **Vishnu**. The two other  
major schools are the **Vishishthadvaita**  
vedanta (“qualified nondualism”) propounded by **Ramanuja** and the **Dvaita**  
Vedanta (“dualist”) propounded by  
**Madhva**. The major differences between  
these two schools stem from assumptions about connections between God,  
human souls, and the world. Ramanuja  
tends to see these in a continuum, with  
the world and human souls sharing in  
the divine nature, whereas Madhva  
stresses the great gulf between God and  
all other things. Another minor school is  
the **dvaitadvaita** vedanta (“dualism and  
nondualism”) of **Nimbarka**, which  
strives to find some middle ground  
between Advaita Vedanta’s monism, and  
Dvaita Vedanta’s dualism. Nimbarka  
stressed that the world and souls were  
dependent on God, in whom they exist,  
and with whom they had a subtle connection. Even from their names, it is  
obvious that there are significant differences between these positions.
