+++
(“letter of petition”) One of the later  
poetic works by the poet-saint  
**Tulsidas** (1532–1623?), in the form of a  
series of 280 short poems written in  
the **Braj Bhasha** dialect. The entire  
work is presented as a letter of petition  
to Tulsidas’s chosen **deity**, **Rama**,  
using as his intermediary the monkeygod **Hanuman**. The letter’s general  
theme is a plea for deliverance from  
the evils of the current degenerate age  
(**kali yuga**). The first sixty-odd verses  
are a series of invocations paying  
homage to various deities, showing  
the ecumenical quality that more generally marks Tulsidas’s devotion. The  
remainder of the poem is directed to  
Rama and stresses other themes that  
run throughout Tulsidas’s poetry. One  
theme is the corrupted nature of the  
present cosmic age, the kali yuga,  
which makes devotion the only effective means to salvation. Another pervasive theme is the power of God’s  
name and its incomparable ability to  
rescue the devotee (**bhakta**). Finally,  
there are warnings to the hearers not  
to waste the opportunity of a human  
**birth**. Much of the poetry has an intimate personal quality, and it seems to  
reflect both the poet’s despair at his  
own frailty and his eventual hope for  
salvation. From this general tone, the  
*Vinaya Patrika* is generally assumed  
to have been written in the later part  
of the poet’s life, although it cannot be  
precisely dated.
