title = "Vikramaditya"

+++
(“**Sun** of Prowess”) Title taken by King  
**Chandra Gupta II** (r. 376–415) as a symbol  
of his royal mastery. This monarch is traditionally identified as the Vikramaditya  
who established the **Vikram era**, but  
because the Vikram era was established a  
little less than sixty years before the common era, this claim is clearly untenable.
