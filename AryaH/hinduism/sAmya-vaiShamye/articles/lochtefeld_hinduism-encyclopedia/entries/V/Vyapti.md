title = "Vyapti"

+++
(“pervasion”) In classical Indian **philosophy**, vyapti is the key condition determining the validity of an inference  
(**anumana**). The accepted form of an  
inference has three terms: An assertion  
(**pratijna**) containing the thing to be  
proved, a reason (**hetu**) containing  
evidence to support the assertion, and  
supporting examples (**drshtanta**). In  
the stock example “there is fire on  
the mountain, because there is smoke  
on the mountain,” the assertion is  
that there is fire, and the reason is that  
there is smoke—with the underlying  
assumption that smoke invariably  
accompanies fire. In a valid inference,  
the reason accounts for every case of  
the thing to be proven; vyapti, or pervasion, is the term for this invariable  
association between cause and effect.
