title = "Vaidyanath"

+++
Form of the god **Shiva**, in his manifestation as the “Lord of Physicians” (vaidya).  
A temple is named for him at **Deoghar**  
in the state of **Bihar**. Shiva is present at  
Vaidyanath in the form of a **linga**, the  
pillar-shaped image that is his symbolic  
form, and the Vaidyanath linga is one of  
the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network of  
sites deemed especially sacred to Shiva,  
and at which Shiva is uniquely present.  
Vaidyanath’s charter myth is associated  
with the **demon**-king **Ravana**, who is  
said to be a great devotee (**bhakta**) of  
Shiva. Ravana travels to Shiva’s home on  
Mount **Kailas** and practices harsh  
**asceticism** for years, hoping to gain a  
vision of Shiva. When his asceticism  
proves unsuccessful, the ten-headed

Ravana proceeds to cut off his heads,  
one by one, and to offer them to Shiva.  
As he is about to cut off the last of his  
heads, Shiva appears before him and  
grants Ravana a boon. Ravana asks for  
Shiva to come and live in his palace in  
**Lanka**, a request that would have made  
Ravana invincible. Shiva agrees to come  
in the form of a linga, but warns Ravana  
that wherever the linga touches the  
**earth**, it will stay there forever. As  
Ravana begins traveling back to Lanka,  
he feels the urge to urinate (which in  
some versions is described as being  
caused by Shiva himself, because the  
other gods have begged Shiva not to go  
to Lanka). Given the condition of his  
boon, he cannot put the linga down;  
moreover, since urination renders one  
ritually impure, the linga would be  
defiled if he holds it while answering  
nature’s call (or touches it before he has  
taken a purifying bath). Ravana ends up  
handing the linga to a cowherd, giving  
him strict orders to keep it off the  
ground. The linga is so heavy, however,  
that the cowherd eventually has to let it  
rest on the ground, where it sticks fast,  
and remains there to this day.
