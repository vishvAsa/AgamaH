(“noting characteristics”) One of the  
**six schools** of traditional Hindu  
729  
Vaisheshika  
**philosophy**, and a school whose special  
concern was the elucidation of physics  
and metaphysics. The Vaisheshika  
analysis of the categories for the  
universe was later combined with the  
stress on reasoning in another of the six  
schools, the **Nyayas**, to form the NyayaVaisheshika school, sometimes called  
the **Naiyayikas**. The Vaisheshika school  
was atomistic—that is, it espoused the  
belief that all things were made up of a  
few basic constituent things—and this  
atomism was the root of the school’s  
metaphysics. Philosophically speaking,  
the Vaisheshikas were realists—that is,  
they thought that the world was made  
up of many different things and that  
these things actually existed as perceived, except in cases of perceptual  
error. They believed that all things were  
composed of nine fundamental substances—the five **elements**, **space**, time,

Vaisheshika  
One of the many forms of Vishnu. Vishnu’s followers are known as Vaishnavas.  
mind, and Selves—and that whatever  
exists was both knowable and nameable. The Vaisheshikas subscribed to the  
**causal model** known as **asatkaryavada**,  
which posited that when a thing was  
created, it was a whole new aggregate,  
completely different from its constituent parts. This causal model tends  
to multiply the number of things in the  
universe because each act of creation  
brings a new thing into being. It also  
admits that human efforts and actions  
are one of the causes influencing these  
effects, making it theoretically possible  
to act in a way that brings final liberation of the soul (**moksha**).  
According to the Vaisheshika analysis, the objects of experience can be  
divided into six categories: substances,  
qualities, activity, universals, particulars, and **inherence** (**samavaya**); some  
later Vaisheshikas add a seventh category,  
absences. The first three categories  
can be perceived, whereas the others  
must be inferred, but the concept of  
inherence is central to their system of  
thought. Inherence is the subtle glue  
connecting all the elements of the universe: wholes and their parts, substances and their qualities, motions and  
the things that move, general properties  
with their particular instances, and most  
important, pleasure and pain to the Self.  
The philosophical problems with inherence—particularly the notion that it was  
one single principle and not a collection  
of things—caused them great difficulty  
and were responsible for the rise  
of **Navyanyaya** school, which attempted  
to explain these relationships in a  
more sophisticated way. For further
