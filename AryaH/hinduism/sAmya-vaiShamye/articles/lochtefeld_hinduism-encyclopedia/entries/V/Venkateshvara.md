(“the Lord of Venkata [Hill]”) Presiding  
**deity** of the Venkateshvara temple near  
the town of Tirupati in the state of  
**Andhra Pradesh**; the temple is north  
and east of Madras. Venkateshvara is a  
local deity who has been assimilated  
into the larger pantheon as a form of the  
god **Vishnu**. The temple is in the  
Tirumalai hills, a cluster of seven hills  
believed to represent the seven cobra  
hoods of **Shesha**, the mythic serpent  
who serves as Vishnu’s couch.  
Venkateshvara’s image is unusual, in  
that his forehead is covered with a plate.  
The two branches of the **Shrivaishnava**  
community, the **Tengalais** and the  
**Vadagalais**, each wear distinctive sectarian markings, and this plate conceals  
these markings on the image and thus  
allows both communities to claim him  
as their own.  
Venkateshvara is also famous for  
having the single richest temple in  
India. People come to Tirupati from all  
over the country, largely because of the  
popular belief that any wish made in the  
deity’s presence will invariably be granted.  
Aside from significant monetary  
**offerings**, it is also very common for pilgrims to have their heads shaved, as a  
sign of their visit and to make an offering of the **hair**, as well. In the time since  
independence the temple’s wealth has  
been administered by a trust, which has  
been particularly attentive in fostering  
publishing, educational institutions,  
and in helping to build Hindu temples  
outside India.
