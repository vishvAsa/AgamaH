title = "Vellala"

+++
The landlord community throughout  
much of traditional **Tamil Nadu**.  
Although technically the Vellalas were of  
**shudra** status, their control over the  
land gave them considerable influence  
and prestige in the region. The Vellala  
community was the source for many of  
the **Alvars**, a group of twelve poet-saints  
whose stress on passionate devotion  
(**bhakti**) to the god **Vishnu** transformed  
and revitalized Hindu religious life. Most  
of the Alvarsâ€™ influence undoubtedly  
stemmed from the strength of their religious devotion, but this was undoubtedly  
reinforced by Vellala status as a landholding community.
