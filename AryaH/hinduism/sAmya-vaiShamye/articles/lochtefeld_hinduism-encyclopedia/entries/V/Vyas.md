In the traditional **Ram Lila** (name given  
to any public dramatic presentation of  
the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the two  
great Hindu epics), vyas is the name  
769  
Vyas  
A vyas, or stage director, at a performance  
of the Ram Lila, Bombay.  
given to the stage directors. The  
Ramnagar Ram Lila is the longest, most  
elaborate, and arguably the oldest of  
these dramas. In the Ramnagar Ram  
Lila, one vyas is responsible for the  
**svarups**, the **brahmin** boys who are  
playing the parts of the divinities, and  
who are considered manifestations of  
the **deities** when they are “in character.”  
The other vyas is responsible for the rest  
of the cast. Between them they shift  
the action between chorus and cast, give  
the actors minute directions for their  
acting, and prompt them when they  
forget their lines. As such, they are visible agents themselves and an important  
part of the Ram Lila.
