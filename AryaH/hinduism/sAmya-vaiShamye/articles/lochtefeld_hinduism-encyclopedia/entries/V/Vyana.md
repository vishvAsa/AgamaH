+++
In traditional Indian physiology, one of  
the five bodily “**winds**” considered to be  
responsible for basic bodily functions,  
the others being **prana**, **apana**, **udana**,  
and **samana**. Unlike all the others,  
which are given specific locations in the  
body, the vyana **wind** is believed to pervade throughout the body, to keep  
things moving and mixed together.
