title = "Valmiki"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is  
regarded as the first poet, and who is traditionally cited as the author of the  
**Ramayana**, the earlier of the two great  
**Sanskrit** epics. According to legend,  
735  
Valmiki  
Valmiki is a bandit in his early life. One  
day, one of his victims asks him  
whether his family will also share the  
sins he is committing, and when  
Valmiki finds out that they will not, he  
has a change of heart. He sits down in a  
secluded place and begins to do **japa**  
(recitation), but his heart is so blackened by his sins that the only words he  
can say are “mara mara” (“death,  
death”). After a long time the syllables  
become reversed, and by reciting  
“Rama Rama” he expiates his former  
sins. This recitation is so long that a  
colony of white ants (in Sanskrit,  
named “valmika”) builds a hill over  
him, and when he emerges from this he  
is given the name Valmiki.  
After his emergence, Valmiki builds  
an **ashram** on the banks of the Tamasa  
River and lives a quiet life. He gives shelter to **Sita** after she has been exiled from  
**Ayodhya** by her husband, **Rama**, and  
also cares for her **sons**, **Lava** and **Kusha**.  
One day when Valmiki is walking by the  
Tamasa River, he sees a hunter shoot a  
pair of courting Krauncha birds, and in  
his intense anger, his rebuke to the  
hunter comes out in verse; according  
to legend, this is the first poem ever  
composed. After this first verse  
composition, the god **Brahma** appears,  
and at Brahma’s encouragement Valmiki  
composes the *Ramayana*.
