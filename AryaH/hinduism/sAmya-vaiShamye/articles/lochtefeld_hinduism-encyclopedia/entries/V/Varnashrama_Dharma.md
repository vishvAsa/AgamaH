title = "Varnashrama Dharma"

+++
In the **dharma literature**, varnashrama  
dharma is the ordering of **dharma** or  
religious duty based on the hierarchical  
social ordering of the four major social  
groups (**varnas**) and the four successive  
**stages of life** (ashramas). According to  
this theory, all people would be able to  
discern their social status and appropriate function based on their social class  
and stage of life. The interrelationship  
between these two sets of categories is  
often used to denote traditional Hindu  
society, in theory if not always in fact.  
The term survives in modern times,  
but because the doctrine of the  
ashramas is now largely ignored, those  
who uphold varnashrama dharma are  
primarily defending the hierarchical  
social divisions commonly known as the  
**caste** system.
