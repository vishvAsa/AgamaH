title = "Vena"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a wicked king  
who prohibits all religious rites and giftgiving except those dedicated to him. He  
is finally killed by a group of outraged  
sages, who through their **magic** powers  
transform blades of sacred **kusha** grass  
into spears. After Vena has been killed,  
the problem of the royal succession arises.  
The sages first churn from his thigh a  
small, malformed, dark-skinned man  
named Nishada, who is believed to be  
the ancestor of the tribal people known  
as the Nishadas. Nishada takes upon  
himself all Venaâ€™s manifold sins, thus  
purging them from Vena. After Vena has  
been cleansed, the sages churn his right  
hand, from which emerges a radiant and  
shining boy, who is King **Prthu**.
