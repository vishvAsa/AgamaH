+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, Vibhishana is  
the youngest brother of **Ravana**, the  
**demon** king of **Lanka**. In their youth  
Vibhishana, Ravana, and their third  
brother, **Kumbhakarna**, have performed harsh physical **asceticism**  
(**tapas**) to gain boons from the gods.  
Whereas his brothers have chosen  
boons designed to advance their military ability and glory, Vibhishana asks  
that he remain righteous in times of  
danger, and this quality marks his life.  
When Ravana holds a council of war  
preceding the battle with **Rama’s**  
army, Vibhishana is the only one to  
vote against battle and instead advises  
Ravana to return Rama’s kidnapped  
wife, **Sita**, and to beg Rama’s pardon.  
For these words, Ravana expells his  
brother from the city, and Vibhishana  
goes over to Rama’s army, where he  
fights valiantly throughout the war.  
After the death of Ravana, Rama  
crowns Vibhishana the king of Lanka,  
as a reward for his fidelity and his  
virtue. Vibhishana is a perfect example  
of the fact that **demons** (in this case  
the type of demons known as **rakshasas**) are not inherently evil in  
Indian mythology. They are powerful  
beings who may clash with gods and  
men, but they have many virtues as  
well. In the **Ramcharitmanas**, the vernacular retelling of the *Ramayana*  
written by the poet-saint **Tulsidas**  
(1532–1623?), Vibhishana is portrayed  
as a great devotee (**bhakta**) of Rama, in  
keeping with the emphasis of Tulsidas  
on the primacy of devotion over all  
other forms of religious life.
