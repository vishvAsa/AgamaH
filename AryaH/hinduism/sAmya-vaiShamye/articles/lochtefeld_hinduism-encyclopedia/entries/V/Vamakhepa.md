title = "Vamakhepa"

+++
(1843–1911) **Ascetic** devotee (**bhakta**) of  
the **Goddess** in her fierce and powerful  
form as Tara; his presence and supposed  
miraculous powers are largely responsible for the importance of **Tarapith** as an  
important regional sacred site (**tirtha**) in  
**West Bengal**. From his earliest childhood, Vamakhepa was occupied with  
thoughts of the Goddess, and from an  
early age he took up residence in the  
**cremation ground** at Tarapith, where he  
undertook the **worship** of Tara. Various  
stories describe his power to heal people  
of all sorts of ailments, as well as his  
complete disregard for all accepted  
standards—according to tradition, he  
once urinated on the temple’s image of  
Tara, to show his contempt for a **deity**  
made of iron, and was struck in punishment by the Goddess.
