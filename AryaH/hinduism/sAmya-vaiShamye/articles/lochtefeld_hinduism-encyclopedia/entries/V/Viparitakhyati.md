(“contrary discrimination”) **Theory of**  
**error** propounded by the **Mimamsa**  
philosopher **Kumarila**, who lived in the  
seventh century C.E. All the theories of  
error aim to explain why people make  
errors in judgment, such as the stock  
example of mistaking the silvery flash of  
seashell for a piece of silver.  
Like **Prabhakara** and the **Naiyayikas**, Kumarila believes that the simple judgments “that object is silvery”  
and “silver is silvery” are both true  
and indisputable. Kumarila also  
agrees with the Naiyayika that the  
error comes from a discrimination  
that is contrary to reality. His difference with the Naiyayikas comes with  
the latter’s postulation of the **inherence**-relationship as connecting subjects and predicates (“silver color”  
and “silver”). Kumarila’s theory is  
identity-and-difference (**bhedabhada**)  
in which all things are what they are  
and are not what they are not. Thus  
the perception (**pratyaksha**) of the  
shell on the beach would involve its  
similarities and differences from silveriness, combined with silver’s similarities and differences from  
silveriness. One can combine the similarities and get a false judgment, or  
the differences and come up with a  
true one. As in the Naiyayika theory of  
error, the root cause for combining  
the similarities rather than the differences comes from karmic dispositions  
stemming from **avidya**, specifically  
the greed for silver that prompts us to  
look for such items of value. For further information see Bijayananda Kar,
