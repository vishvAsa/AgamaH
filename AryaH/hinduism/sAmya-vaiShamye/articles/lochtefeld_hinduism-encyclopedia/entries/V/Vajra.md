title = "Vajra"

+++
Name for the thunderbolt, conceived  
as one of the divine weapons. It has  
two symmetrical sides, sometimes  
pointed, with a handle in the middle.  
The vajra is an enormously important  
symbol in Buddhism, particularly the  
tantric forms (i.e., secret, ritually based  
religious practices) found in Tibet, but  
it appears very seldom in Hindu  
iconography. It is attested to be an  
attribute of certain forms of the gods  
**Ganesh** and **Vishnu**, but on the whole it  
is not as important as some of the other  
symbols. See also **tantra**.
