title = "Vinata"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the **daughter** of  
the divine sage **Daksha**, and the sister  
of **Kadru**. Vinata gives **birth** to a line of  
eagles—of whom the most famous is  
**Garuda**—whereas Kadru gives birth to  
a line of serpents. The proverbial  
antipathy between these two kinds of  
**animals** is described as stemming  
from conflict between these two sisters. One day the sisters get into an  
argument about the tail color of a certain celestial horse, with Vinata arguing that it is white, and Kadru  
asserting that it is black. The disagreement becomes more intense, until  
they finally agree that the person who  
is wrong will become a slave to the  
other. To ensure her victory, Kadru  
persuades a number of her children to  
hang from the back of the horse, which  
from a distance makes the tail appear  
to be black. When Vinata sees the  
black snakes, she accepts her defeat,  
and for many years has to serve Kadru  
under extremely harsh conditions. She  
is finally rescued by her **son**, Garuda,  
who when he discovers what has happened, embarks on a program of  
killing snakes that has never abated.
