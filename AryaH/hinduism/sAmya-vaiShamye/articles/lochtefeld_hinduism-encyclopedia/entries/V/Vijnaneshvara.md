(12th c.) Author of the **Mitakshara**, a  
voluminous commentary on the **Yajnavalkya Smrti**, itself an example of the  
**dharma literature**, or texts on religious  
duty. This particular commentary  
played a pivotal role in the British  
administration of India. The British were  
largely content to have their Indian subjects governed by traditional religious  
laws, but to do so, they needed an  
accepted standard. For large sections of  
British India, the *Mitakshara* was given  
the status of traditional law and was  
used as a legal code. The only major part  
of India in which Hindus were not subject to this was in Bengal, where the legal  
authority was the **Dayabhaga**. One of  
751  
Vijnaneshvara  
the major differences between the two  
was in matters of **inheritance**. The  
*Mitakshara* stresses inheritance by  
survivorship, in which only living males  
can inherit property, whereas the  
*Dayabhaga* stresses inheritance by succession, in which a dead manâ€™s heirs can  
inherit in his name.
