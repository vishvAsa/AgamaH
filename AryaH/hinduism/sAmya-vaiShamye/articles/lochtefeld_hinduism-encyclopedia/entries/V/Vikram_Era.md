title = "Vikram Era"

+++
One of the most common dating systems,  
particularly in northern India. It is generally believed that the Vikram era takes its  
name from King **Vikramaditya** of **Ujjain**,  
who is supposed to have ruled over much  
of India. The Vikram era date is fifty-six or  
fifty-seven years later than that of the common era; the discrepancy stems from the  
differing first days of the **year** in the two  
systems. In the common era the year  
begins on January 1, but in the Vikram era  
the year begins with the **sunâ€™s** transition  
into Aries, considered in India as occurring  
on April 14. Hence, to convert a Vikram era  
date to a common era date, one subtracts  
fifty-six years for dates between January 1  
and April 14, and fifty-seven years for dates  
between April 15 and December 31.
