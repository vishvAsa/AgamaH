One of the two main subsects in the  
**Shrivaishnava** religious community, the  
other being the **Tengalai**. The Shrivaishnavas are devotees (**bhakta**) of the  
god **Vishnu**, and the community’s roots  
lie in the devotional hymns of the  
**Alvars**, a group of twelve poet-saints  
who lived in southern India between  
the seventh and tenth centuries. Two  
centuries later, the Alvars’ devotional  
outpouring was organized and systematized by the philosopher **Ramanuja**  
(11th c.), who is considered the  
Shrivaishnava founder. Ramanuja was  
convinced that **Brahman**, or Supreme  
Reality, was a personal **deity** rather than  
an impersonal abstract principle, and he  
was also convinced that devotion  
(**bhakti**) was the most important form of  
religious practice. **Vishishthadvaita**  
**Vedanta**, his philosophical position,  
stressed both of these convictions and  
thus opposed the **Advaita Vedanta**  
school, founded by the philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**, which believed that  
the Supreme Being was impersonal and  
that realization (**jnana**) was the best  
spiritual path.  
The split between the Tengalais and  
the Vadagalais came several centuries  
later and stemmed from differing perspectives on what the individual must  
do to gain final liberation of the soul  
(**moksha**). The Vadagalais not only  
stress the saving power of God’s **grace**,  
but also assert that the individual must  
respond to that grace and take an active  
role in his or her salvation. This belief is  
in complete contrast to the Tengalais,  
who emphasize the need for absolute  
surrender (**prapatti**) to the grace of God,  
through which devotees are saved with  
no action of their own.
