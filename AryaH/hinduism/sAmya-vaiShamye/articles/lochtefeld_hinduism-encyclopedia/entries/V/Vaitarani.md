title = "Vaitarani"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a river flowing  
through the underworld over which  
souls must cross on the way to their  
audience with the god **Yama**, the god of  
the dead. For righteous people the  
crossing is fairly easy, and they are widely  
believed to get over by holding the tail  
of a **cow**. For wicked people, on the  
other hand, the Vaitarani is a river of  
pus, **blood**, spit, and other polluting  
substances, in which various ferocious  
beasts lie in wait.
