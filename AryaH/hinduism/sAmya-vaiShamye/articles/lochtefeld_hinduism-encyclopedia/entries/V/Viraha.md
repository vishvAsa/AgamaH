(“separation”) Well-established poetic  
genre in classical **Sanskrit** poetry and in  
much of vernacular devotional (**bhakti**)  
poetry. The genre focuses on describing  
the pain resulting from the separation of  
lover and beloved, whether the separated lovers are two human beings or devotee (**bhakta**) and **deity**. Such separation  
is believed to bring on specific physical  
symptoms, which the poets describe in  
detail—lack of appetite, insomnia,  
inability to attend to daily life, or to  
think about anyone but the beloved. The  
sort of love felt in such separation is  
believed to engender an even more  
intense love for the beloved than love in  
union because the latter is sweetened by  
the presence of the beloved, whereas the  
former has to stand by itself.
