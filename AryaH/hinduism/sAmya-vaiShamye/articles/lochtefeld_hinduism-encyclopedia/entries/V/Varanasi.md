title = "Varanasi"

+++
Traditional name for the sacred city of  
**Benares**. The name *Varanasi* may be  
generally used to denote the whole city,  
but in a more specific context this refers  
to one of the concentric sacred zones  
surrounding the **Vishvanath** temple, the  
city’s ritual center. The smallest of these  
zones is called **Avimukta**, the second is  
Varanasi, and the largest is named  
**Kashi**. The sacred zone of Varanasi is  
conceived as the area between the  
Varana and the Asi rivers—the traditional  
boundaries of the city of Benares—but  
Varanasi’s boundaries do not stretch  
inland as far as those of Kashi.
