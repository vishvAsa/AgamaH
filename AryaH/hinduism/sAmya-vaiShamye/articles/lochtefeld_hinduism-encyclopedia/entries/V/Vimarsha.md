(“reflection”) In Hindu **tantra**, a secret,  
ritually based religious practice, **vimarsha** is one of the bipolar opposites that  
are used to characterize the nature of all  
reality, with its counterpart being illumination (**prakasha**). These two terms are  
particularly important for the creation  
of the world, which is said to happen  
when the pure and radiant consciousness (prakasha) of the ultimate  
**Brahman** becomes self-conscious  
through the reflection (vimarsha) of this  
original consciousness. From one single  
consciousness, the absolute then  
evolves into a binary divinity—the god  
**Shiva** and his consort **Shakti**—whose  
continued interaction combines to  
create the world. This dyad of prakashavimarsha is particularly important in the  
**Trika** school of Kashmiri Shaivism. For  
further information see Jaideva Singh,  
*Pratyabhijnanahrdayam*, 1982.
