title = "Vijayanagar Dynasty"

+++
(“City of Victory”) The last of the great  
southern Indian Hindu kingdoms,  
which took its name from its capital city,  
near modern **Hampi** in **Karnataka**. The  
kingdom was founded in 1336 by  
**Harihara**, a regional governor in the  
Tughluq dynasty who broke away to  
carve out a kingdom in the central  
**Deccan** plateau. The kingdom went  
through several periods of expansion  
and decay. In the early fifteenth century  
it controlled most of southern India, but  
then passed through a period of decline  
and loss of territory; this was followed by  
renewal in the early sixteenth century,  
during the reign of **Krishna Deva Raya**,  
and finally ended after the battle of  
**Talikota** in 1565, in which the ruling  
prince Rama Raja was decisively defeated  
by a coalition of the sultans from the  
northern part of the Deccan. The city of  
Vijayanagar was abandoned almost  
immediately, and although it has suffered the ravages of time, it still contains  
stunning examples of late medieval  
Hindu art and **architecture**.
