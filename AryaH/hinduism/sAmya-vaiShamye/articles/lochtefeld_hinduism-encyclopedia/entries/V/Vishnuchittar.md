An epithet of the **Alvar** poet-saint  
**Periyalvar**. The Alvars were a group  
of twelve poet-saints who lived in southern India between the seventh and tenth  
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, and  
their stress on passionate devotion  
(**bhakti**) to a personal god, conveyed  
through hymns sung in the **Tamil**  
**language**, transformed Hindu religious  
life. See **Periyalvar**.
