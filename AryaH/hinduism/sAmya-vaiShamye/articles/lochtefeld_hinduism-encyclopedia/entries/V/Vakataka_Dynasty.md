title = "Vakataka Dynasty"

+++
(4th–6th c.) Central Indian dynasty  
whose ancestral homeland was in the  
center of modern India. The Vakataka  
zenith came between the fourth and  
sixth centuries, during which their sway  
extended through most of the **Deccan**  
plateau. At the turn of the fifth century,  
the Vakataka king Rudrasena II married  
Prabhavati Gupta, creating a marriage  
alliance with the northern Indian **Gupta**  
**dynasty** that gave the two dynasties  
sway over much of India. Prabhavati  
Gupta ruled as regent following  
Rudrasena’s untimely death, during  
which the Vakataka kingdom was a virtual part of the Gupta empire, but in the  
time after that the Vakatakas regained  
greater autonomy.
