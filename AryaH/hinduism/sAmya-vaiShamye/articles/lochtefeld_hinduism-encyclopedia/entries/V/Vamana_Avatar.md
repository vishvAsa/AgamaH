title = "Vamana Avatar"

+++
Fifth **avatar** of **Vishnu**, this one in the  
form of a dwarf (“vamana”). As with all  
of Vishnu’s avatars, the Vamana avatar  
comes into being in a time of crisis and  
serves to restore the cosmic balance  
that has been thrown out of equilibrium. In this case the source of trouble  
stems from a **demon** (asura) named  
**Bali**, who has grown so powerful that  
he is able to rule the entire universe,  
doing as he wishes. As in many other  
cases, Vishnu is able to counter and  
conquer this disruptive force through  
cunning and trickery, rather than simple  
overt power.  
The mythic tale describes how Bali is  
sponsoring a great **sacrifice**, to which all  
the gods and sages have come. Vishnu  
comes in the form of a dwarf, disguised  
as a mendicant **brahmin**. Bali gives  
many rich gifts to those attending, as  
part of the gift-giving (**dana**) associated  
with sacrifice, and he offers to give  
Vamana anything that he asks for.  
Vamana refuses the offer of riches, land,  
and material wealth, and asks only for  
three paces worth of land to set up his  
own sacrificial altar. Bali is amused by  
the request and grants it flippantly  
despite the warnings of **Shukra**, his religious preceptor (**guru**), that he should  
not do this.  
As soon as Bali pours **water** on  
Vamana’s hand, marking that the gift has  
been given irrevocably, Vamana suddenly  
begins to grow. He grows so large that he  
takes up all the space in the cosmos and  
then begins to take his three steps. With  
his first step he traverses the **earth**,  
with his second the **heavens**, and with  
his third step there is nowhere else to  
go. Bali realizes that he has been  
defeated, and as a **gesture** of submission indicates that Vishnu’s third step  
should fall on his head. Vishnu’s third  
step pushes Bali down into the netherworld, where he still remains as the  
ruler. As for many of the other avatars,  
Bali’s fate gives an important lesson:  
Vishnu’s purpose is not to destroy him,  
but to restore the cosmic balance that  
has been lost through one being gaining  
disproportionate or inappropriate power.  
Through his submission to Vishnu, Bali  
remains a powerful being, but on a  
diminished scale.  
The motif of measuring out the universe in three steps is part of the oldest  
stratum of Vishnu’s mythology. In one of  
the few hymns to Vishnu in the **Rg Veda**  
(1.154), the oldest Hindu religious text,  
he is described as a protective and  
benevolent **deity**, who with three steps  
defines the boundaries of the universe.  
This manifestation of Vishnu is named  
Trivikrama (“[taking] three steps”); it  
seems likely that the motif from this  
hymn was grafted onto the Vamana  
story as part of the process of assimilation into the pantheon.
