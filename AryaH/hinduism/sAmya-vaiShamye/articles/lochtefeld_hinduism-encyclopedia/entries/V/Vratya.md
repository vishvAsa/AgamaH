title = "Vratya"

In the **Atharva Veda**, one of the earliest  
Hindu religious texts, the vratyas were a  
particular class of vagrant ascetics who  
were priests of a non-Vedic fertility cult.  
Not much is known about them because  
there are no other sources, but they were  
clearly outside the Vedic cult and thus  
looked down upon. In later times, the  
word is used to designate a person who  
has lost **caste** through nonobservance of  
one of the necessary **samskaras** (lifecycle ceremonies).
