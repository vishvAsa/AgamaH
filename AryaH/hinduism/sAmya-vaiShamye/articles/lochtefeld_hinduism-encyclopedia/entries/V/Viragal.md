(“Hero-stone”) Stone erected in memory  
of a warrior, often the village headman,  
who perished in battle while defending  
the village cattle from pillage. Such  
stones can be found all over the **Deccan**  
region, and Deleury speculates that the  
origins of the Maharashtrian god  
**Vithoba** lay in such a deified hero, who  
was later assimilated into the pantheon  
as a form of **Vishnu**.
