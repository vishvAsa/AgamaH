Pseudonym of Father Constanzio Beschi  
(1680â€“1747), an Italian Jesuit who lived  
in **Tamil Nadu** for thirty-six years. Like  
many of the other early Jesuits, Beschi  
learned the local language and adopted  
the local way of life. As part of his missionary work, he translated parts of the  
Old and New Testament into literary  
Tamil, and his facility with the language  
and its poetic conventions make this  
work a significant milestone in later  
Tamil literature.
