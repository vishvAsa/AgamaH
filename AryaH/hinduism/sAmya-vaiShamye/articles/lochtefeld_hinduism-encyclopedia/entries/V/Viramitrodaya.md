One of the latest and the largest of the  
**nibandhas** (“collections”), compiled in  
the early seventeenth century by the  
scholar **Mitra Mishra**. The nibandhas  
were compendia of Hindu lore, in  
which the compilers culled references  
on a particular theme from the **Vedas**,  
**dharma literature**, **puranas**, and other  
authoritative religious texts, and then  
compiled these excerpts into a single  
volume. The *Viramitrodaya* is a massive  
compendium of Hindu lore, each of  
whose twenty-two sections is devoted to  
a particular aspect of Hindu life, such as  
daily practice, **worship**, gift-giving  
(**dana**), vows, pilgrimage, penances  
(**prayashchitta**), purification, death  
rites (**antyeshthi samskara**), law, and so  
forth, finally ending with liberation  
(**moksha**). Aside from citing the relevant  
scriptural passages, Mitra Mishra also  
provides extensive learned commentary, and his work became an important  
source for later legal interpretation, particularly in eastern India.
