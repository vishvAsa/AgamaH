title = "Vasant Panchami"

+++
Festival falling on the fifth **day**  
(panchami) of the bright (waxing) half  
of the **lunar month** of **Magh**  
(January–February), celebrated as the  
first day of spring (vasant). This day is  
considered sacred to the **goddess**  
**Saraswati**, patron **deity** of the arts,  
music, and learning. In her honor, celebrants sing songs in melodic modes  
(**ragas**) associated with spring. Given  
Saraswati’s connection with learning,  
this is also traditionally reckoned as the  
day on which young children should  
begin their studies.  
Vasant Panchami is also associated  
with **Kama**, the god of love, since the  
coming of spring brings the reappearance of flowering plants, with their  
scents and colors. This is supposedly  
the day that Kama attempts to instill  
**erotic** desire in the god **Shiva’s** heart,  
first by bringing spring to Mount  
**Kailas**, where Shiva is meditating, and  
then shooting Shiva with one of his  
flower arrows. Shiva awakens from his  
meditation, becomes angry at Kama,  
741  
Vasant Panchami  
and reduces him to ashes with a burst  
of flame from his third eye. Despite  
being destroyed, in the end Kama is  
successful—after being awakened,  
Shiva becomes aware of **Parvati’s**  
**ascetic** practice and eventually becomes  
her husband.
