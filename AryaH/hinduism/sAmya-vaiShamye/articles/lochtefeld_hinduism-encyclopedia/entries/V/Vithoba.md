title = "Vithoba"

+++
Presiding **deity** of the temple with the  
same name in the city of **Pandharpur** in  
the state of **Maharashtra**; other epithets  
for Vithoba include Vitthala and  
Pandurang. Vithoba was originally a  
local deity—according to some theories,  
a deified hero—who has been assimilated  
into the larger Hindu pantheon as a  
form of the god **Vishnu**. According to  
the temple’s charter myth, Vishnu  
comes to Pandharpur drawn by the filial  
devotion of a young boy named  
Pundalika. When Vishnu arrives  
Pundalika is massaging his father’s feet,  
and when Vishnu asks for the hospitality  
due to any guest, Pundalika stops only  
long enough to throw a brick over his  
shoulder, to give the god a place to stand  
out of the mud. Impressed that  
Pundalika’s devotion to his parents  
supersedes even his devotion to God,  
Vishnu becomes rooted to that spot and  
has remained there ever since; Vithoba’s  
image shows him with his hands on his  
hips (still waiting, perhaps, for  
Pundalika). Aside from this story,  
Vithoba has surprisingly little mythic  
history, although he has become an  
important regional deity.  
Vithoba is most famous for the activities of his devotees (**bhakta**), the  
**Varkari Panth** religious community,  
who make pilgrimages to Pandharpur  
twice a year. Pandharpur sits in the  
**Bhima River** valley on the edge of the  
Maharashtra-**Karnataka** border, and  
pilgrims come from all directions.  
Individual pilgrims travel in small  
groups called **dindis**, often made up of  
people from the same neighborhood or  
locality. The dindis are organized into  
larger groups known as **palkhis**, each of  
which is associated with one of the  
Varkari poet-saints, and which is led by  
a **palanquin** (palkhi) bearing the sandals of that saint. Each palkhi departs  
from a place associated with its particular saint—for example, the palkhi of  
**Jnaneshvar** leaves from the town of  
**Alandi** in which he lived, and thus he  
and all the other saints are still symbolically journeying to Pandharpur twice a  
year. Each of these palkhis travels a prescribed route, and pilgrims time their  
departure and their travel to arrive in  
Pandharpur on the same day—the  
eleventh day (**ekadashi**) in the bright  
half of **Ashadh** (June–July) in the summer, and the eleventh day in the bright  
half of **Kartik** (October–November) in  
the fall. Pilgrims compare their journey  
to that of a small stream merging with  
other streams, gradually forming a  
mighty river converging on Pandharpur.  
During their journey pilgrims sing  
the devotional songs composed by  
these poet-saints, among them  
**Jnaneshvar**, **Namdev**, **Eknath**, **Tukaram**,  
**Chokamela**, **Gora**, **Janabai**, and **Bahina**  
**Bai**. In this way, the pilgrims are emulating the saints before them, both by  
treading in their physical footsteps and  
by singing their songs of devotion.  
Although the pilgrimage ends with the  
entry to Pandharpur and the **worship** of  
Vithoba, the most important part is the  
journey itself. For more information on
