title = "Valli"

+++
In the mythology of southern India, the  
god **Skanda** (in his southern Indian  
form as **Murugan**) becomes enamored  
of and marries Valli, a young girl from a  
group of tribal hunters. The marriage  
takes place despite his earlier marriage  
to the **goddess Devasena**, who has been  
given to him by **Indra** and the established Hindu gods. Muruganâ€™s marriage  
with Valli is a sign of his connection with  
the land and probably reflects his earlier  
past as a tribal **deity**. The marriage is  
described as taking place at **Tiruttani** in  
**Tamil Nadu**, but he is also described as  
settling at **Kataragama** in **Sri Lanka**.
