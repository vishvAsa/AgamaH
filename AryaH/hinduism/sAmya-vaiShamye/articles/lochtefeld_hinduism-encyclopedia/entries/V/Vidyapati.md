title = "Vidyapati"

+++
(ca. 1400) **Brahmin** court poet in the  
Hindu kingdom of **Mithila** in northern  
**Bihar**. Although Vidyapati wrote works  
in **Sanskrit**, he is best known for his love  
poetry, which was written in the vernacular Maithali language. In this poetry he  
drew on the literary traditions of  
Sanskrit love poetry, but his favorite  
subjects for this poetry were the divine  
lovers **Radha** and **Krishna**. Although  
later **Vaishnavas** considered Vidyapati’s  
love poetry as devotional works,  
Vidyapati’s own religious writings definitively describe **Shiva** as the Supreme  
Being, clearly showing that he was a  
**Shaiva**. For further information see
