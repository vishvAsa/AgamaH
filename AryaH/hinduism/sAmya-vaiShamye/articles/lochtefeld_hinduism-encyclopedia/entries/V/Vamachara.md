(“left-hand practice”) In the secret, ritually based religious practice known as  
**tantra**, this term denotes a type of  
tantric practice that makes ritual use of  
forbidden substances, such as the Five  
Forbidden Things (**panchamakara**), or  
promotes behavior that the orthodox  
would consider scandalous or objectionable. When seen in a tantric context,  
the use of such normally forbidden substances is not mere license, but a powerful ritual tool. One of the most pervasive  
tantric assumptions is the ultimate  
unity of everything that exists. From a  
tantric perspective, to affirm that the  
entire universe is one principle—often,  
conceived as the activity of a particular  
**deity**—means that the adept must reject  
all concepts based on dualistic thinking.  
The “Five Forbidden Things” provide a  
ritual means for breaking down duality  
because in this ritual the adept breaks  
societal norms forbidding consumption  
of **intoxicants**, nonvegetarian food, and  
illicit sexuality, in a conscious effort to  
sacralize what is normally forbidden.  
Within the tantric tradition itself there is  
a long-standing debate about the propriety of such acts, and whereas the  
vamachara practice uses these elements  
in their actual forms, in the **dakshinachara** (“right-hand”) practice, other  
items are substituted for the forbidden  
ones. This distinction between “right”  
and “left” hand also reveals the pervasive polarity between right and left in
