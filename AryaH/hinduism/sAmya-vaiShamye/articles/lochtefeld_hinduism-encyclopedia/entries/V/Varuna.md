title = "Varuna"

+++
In the **Vedas**, the oldest and most  
authoritative religious texts, Varuna is  
a **deity** associated with the sky, with  
waters, with justice, and with truth.  
Varuna belongs to the earliest layer of  
the Indo-**Aryan** deities; this is clearly  
shown by comparisons with the  
Avesta, an ancient Iranian sacred text  
that shows many parallels with the  
Vedas, and with even older epigraphic  
sources. As portrayed in the Vedas, however, Varuna’s influence has clearly  
declined—there are far fewer hymns  
addressed to him than to deities such as  
**Indra**, **Agni**, and **Soma**, and he seems to  
have played a far less important role  
than these other deities in Vedic religion.  
In the Vedas, Varuna is portrayed as  
the guardian of **rta**, the cosmic order  
through which the world proceeds. As  
the deity associated with the high **heaven**,  
he also watches over the deeds of  
human beings and punishes them for  
any transgressions. The best known  
hymn to Varuna, **Rg Veda** 7.86, shows  
Varuna’s connection with justice, moral  
order, and the waters. The hymn is the  
lament of a person who has committed  
some offense against Varuna and whose  
sin has become visible through being  
afflicted with **dropsy**, in which the body  
retains its fluids and swells. The speaker  
begs Varuna to reveal the forbidden act,  
“committed under the influence of  
**liquor**, anger, or heedlessness,” so that  
Varuna may be propitiated and the sufferer healed.  
Despite his virtual eclipse early in the  
tradition, in the later tradition, Varuna  
retains his association as the god presiding over the waters. He is also considered to be one of the eight **Guardians of**  
**the Directions**, each of which is associated with one of eight points on the  
compass. Varuna presides over the western direction.
