(“all-pervasive”) Along with **Shiva** and  
the **Goddess**, one of the three most  
important **deities** in the Hindu pantheon. All three of these are notable for  
being almost unmentioned in the  
**Vedas**, the earliest Hindu religious texts,  
and the ascendancy of these three and  
the gradual eclipse of the Vedic gods  
points clearly to a definitive shift in  
Hindu religious life. Of the three, Vishnu  
has the most significant presence in the  
Vedas. Many of the hymns in which he is  
mentioned describe him as a helper to  
the storm-god **Indra**, the primary Vedic  
god, and one of Vishnu’s epithets here is  
Upendra (“junior Indra”). Yet he also  
appears in some of the late hymns as an  
independent agent, who is associated  
with marvelous deeds for the good of  
the cosmos, such as taking three steps to  
measure out the universe. Vishnu is also  
associated with the **sun**, both in his ability to move through the **heavens**, and to  
fall on (and thus “observe”) all things.  
In the divine triad of **Brahma**Vishnu-Shiva, Vishnu is identified as the  
sustainer or maintainer of the cosmos.  
One manifestation of this can be seen in  
a common creation myth, which begins  
with Vishnu lying on the back of his serpent couch, **Shesha**, in the primordial  
ocean at the time of cosmic dissolution  
(**pralaya**). A lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s  
navel, which opens to reveal Brahma,  
the creator, who begins the work of creation. Vishnu presides over the creation,  
and when the time for dissolution comes  
again, the entire process reverses, and  
the universe is drawn back into Vishnu,  
who is thus seen as the source of all.  
The other way that Vishnu sustains  
the cosmos is through the action of his  
**avatars** or incarnations, who come into  
the world to restore balance to a universe dangerously out of equilibrium,

usually because of a **demon** grown disproportionately strong. There are ten  
generally reckoned avatars. The first  
four are in nonhuman forms: the **Fish**  
**avatar**, **Tortoise avatar**, **Boar avatar**,  
and **Man-Lion avatar**. The other six are  
in human form, often as sages or heroes:  
**Vamana avatar**, **Parashuram avatar**,  
**Rama avatar**, **Krishna avatar**, **Buddha**  
**avatar**, and **Kalki avatar**; the last has yet  
to come. In each of these cases, Vishnu  
takes form to avert some sort of disaster  
and to maintain the integrity of the cosmos. The doctrine of the avatars provided  
a mechanism to assimilate existing  
deities into the larger pantheon and to  
give them recognizable status of their  
own. Although most of the avatars are  
no longer objects of **worship** (the Boar  
and Man-Lion avatars each had a substantial following early in the common  
era), in much of northern India the worship of Rama and Krishna has largely  
eclipsed that of Vishnu himself, who  
has largely faded into the background.  
In southern India, Vishnu is still  
an important object of worship, particularly in the **Shrivaishnava** community.  
Aside from the doctrine of the avatars,  
important local deities have also been  
assimilated into the pantheon as forms  
of Vishnu; the most significant  
examples are **Jagannath**, **Venkateshvara**,  
and **Vithoba**.  
In medieval Hinduism sectarian  
rivalry developed between **Vaishnavas**  
and **Shaivas**, with each claiming that  
their chosen deity (Vishnu and Shiva,  
respectively) was supreme. Although  
Vaishnavas see Vishnu as the supreme  
power in the universe, his mythic character and activity differ sharply from  
Shiva’s. Whereas Shiva is associated with  
**ascetic** life and practices (**tapas**), and  
thus with the religious power generated  
by such practices, Vishnu’s headdress is  
a crown, and his persona is that of an allruling king. Whereas Shiva destroys his  
mythic adversaries using raw power,  
from which all subtlety is absent, Vishnu  
more often triumphs through cunning,  
cleverness, and trickery. Each deity’s  
adherents affirm their divinity as the  
preeminent power in the universe, from  
which all the other gods gain their  
power, and both are seen as gracious  
and loving to their devotees (**bhakta**).
