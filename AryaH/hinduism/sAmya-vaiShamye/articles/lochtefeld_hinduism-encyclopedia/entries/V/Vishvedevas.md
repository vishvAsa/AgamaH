title = "Vishvedevas"

+++
This name can either be construed as  
referring to all the gods, based on the  
term’s literal meaning (“all the gods”), or  
it can refer to a group of **deities** reckoned as the **sons** of **Vishva**, the **daughter** of the divine sage **Daksha**. The  
number of sons differs according to different texts and is reckoned at either ten  
or thirteen. The Vishvedevas are especially worshiped at the memorial rites  
for the dead known as **shraddhas**,  
although the **Manu Smrti**, one of the  
authoritative texts in the **dharma literature**, prescribes **offerings** to them every  
day. These prescribed daily offerings are  
said to have been their reward for having performed particularly harsh **asceticism** (**tapas**).
