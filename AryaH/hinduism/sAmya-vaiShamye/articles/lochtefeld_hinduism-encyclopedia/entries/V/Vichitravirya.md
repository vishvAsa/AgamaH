In Hindu mythology, the **son** of  
**Satyavati** and king **Shantanu**. Vichitravirya dies after his marriage to  
**Ambika** and **Ambalika**, but before he  
has fathered any children. In her desperation to perpetuate King Shantanuâ€™s lineage, Satyavati calls on her eldest son,  
**Vyasa**, to sleep with the two wives. From  
this union Vyasa sires **Pandu** and  
**Dhrtarashtra**, whose descendants form  
the major warring factions in the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
**Sanskrit** epics.
