title = "Varkari"

+++
Religious community of devotees  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Vishnu**, in his manifestation as **Vithoba**. Varkari **worship**  
has centered on Vithoba’s temple at  
**Pandharpur** in the southern part of the  
state of **Maharashtra**. The community’s  
history begins with a series of extraordinary devotional (**bhakti**) poet-saints,  
dating from the twelfth to the seventeenth century: **Jnaneshvar**, **Namdev**,  
**Eknath**, **Tukaram**, **Chokamela**, **Gora**,  
**Janabai**, **Bahina Bai**, and many others.  
One of the ways that these saints  
expressed their devotion was in pilgrimage to Pandharpur, and this pilgrimage  
is still the major ritual act in the Varkari  
community. Twice a **year** Varkaris come  
on pilgrimage to Pandharpur and time  
their travel so that all the pilgrims arrive  
on the same **day**—the eleventh day  
(**ekadashi**) in the bright half of **Ashadh**  
(June–July) in the summer, and the  
eleventh day in the bright half of  
**Kartik** (October–November) in the fall.  
Individual pilgrims travel in small  
groups called **dindis**, often made up of  
people from the same neighborhood or  
locality. The dindis are organized into  
larger groups known as **palkhis**, each of  
which is associated with one of the  
Varkari poet-saints and is led by a  
**palanquin** (palkhi, an enclosed singleperson litter borne on the shoulders of  
bearers by means of poles) bearing the  
sandals of that saint. Each palkhi  
departs from a place associated with its  
particular saint—for example, the  
palkhi of Jnaneshvar leaves from the  
town of **Alandi** in which he lived—and  
thus he and all the other saints are still  
symbolically journeying to Pandharpur  
twice a year. During their journey pilgrims sing the devotional songs composed by these poet-saints. In this way,  
the pilgrims are emulating the saints  
739  
Varkari  
before them, both by treading in their  
physical footsteps and by singing their  
songs of devotion. Although the pilgrimage concludes with the entry to  
Pandharpur and the worship of  
Vithoba, the most important part is the  
journey itself. For more information
