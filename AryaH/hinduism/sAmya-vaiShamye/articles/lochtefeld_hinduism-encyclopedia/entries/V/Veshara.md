One of the three developed styles in  
medieval Hindu temple **architecture**,  
the others being the **Nagara** and the  
**Dravida**. The Veshara style is primarily  
found in western India and the **Deccan**  
and was the least significant and widespread of the three styles. Whereas the  
Nagara style was characterized by vertical uplift achieved by a temple’s towers  
(**shikharas**), and the Dravida style by  
lower temples covering enormous tracts  
of ground, the Veshara style’s most identifiable feature is a barrel roof above the  
747  
Veshara  
sanctuary, which has its roots in the  
rock-cut caves (**chaityas**) first sculpted  
by the Buddhists. This sort of roof is  
midway between the Nagara towers and  
the Dravida horizontal tiers, just as the  
Deccan was the intermediate region  
between the two.
