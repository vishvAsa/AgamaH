title = "Vata"

+++
(“air”) Along with **pitta** (“bile”) and  
**kapha** (“phlegm”), one of the three  
humors (**tridosha**) in **ayurveda**, the traditional system of Indian medicine.  
Every person has all three of these  
humors, but usually one is predominant, and this marks a person in certain  
ways, particularly with regard to health,  
digestion, and metabolism. Vata is associated with the element of air, which is  
quick, light, and dry. People whose predominant humor is vata are said to have  
quick minds, light bodies, and tend to  
always be doing something. At the same  
time, they lack substantiality and can  
run down easily if not careful.
