  <meta property="og:description" content="(“World Hindu Organization,” hereafter
VHP) Modern Hindu religious organization affiliated with the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a conservative Hindu organization whose express
purpose is to provide the leadership
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The
VHP was formed in 1964, when RSS leader
Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar met in
Bombay with a group of Hindu religious
leaders. Their immediate concern was
the upcoming visit of Pope Paul VI to
India, which they interpreted as a concealed attempt to convert Hindus to
Christianity, and resolved to oppose by
forming an organization dedicated to
the propagation of Hinduism. For the
next fifteen years, the VHP focused its
attention on countering Christian missionary efforts in northeastern India,
with little fanfare and little impact on
the public consciousness.
A watershed in the VHP’s public image
came in 1982, following the conversion
of some untouchables to Islam in the
Tamil Nadu village of Minakshipuram.
The VHP used this much-publicized
event as evidence that Hindu identity
was endangered and countered it by
launching a series of innovative public
761
Vishva Hindu Parishad
actions, first in Tamil Nadu, but later
extending throughout the entire nation.
The VHP’s renewed activity corresponded
with a more activist bent in its parent
organization, the RSS, as well as the decision by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
a political organization that is also an RSS
affiliate, to assume a more militantly
Hindu identity. Many of the VHP’s
national campaigns coincided with
national or state elections, and many of
these centered on the campaign to build
a temple to the god Rama in the city of
Ayodhya, at the site claimed to be
Rama’s birthplace. The site on which
they proposed to build the temple was
occupied by a Muslim mosque, the
Babri Masjid, which the VHP claimed
had been built only after tearing down
the original Rama temple. This temple
campaign thus carried powerful images
of past oppression, as well as the
assertiveness of a renascent Hindu identity. The VHP’s activism has enormously
boosted the BJP’s political fortunes, and
helped make it the dominant political
party through much of northern India.
The VHP’s activism has generated
sharply contrasting emotions throughout India. Proponents point to its long
record of social service and its role in
helping strengthen and define a modern Hindu identity. Detractors point to
its disregard for the niceties of law,
which was epitomized by the destruction of the Babri Masjid in December
1992, its often vitriolic anti-Muslim
rhetoric, and its ultimate control by the
RSS, despite its separate institutional
identity. Other critics have censured
the VHP for attempting to declare certain “required” Hindu rites as antithetical to the Hindu tradition and for
attempting to define and control the
nature of “Hinduism.” Other critics
question the organization’s claim to
speak for all Hindus, noting that its real
power lies in the hands of brahmins and
other privileged classes; these critics see
the VHP as an organization designed to
conceal its true purpose, the maintenance of upper-class influence and privilege. For further information see Walter

  <p>(“World Hindu Organization,” hereafter<br>
VHP) Modern Hindu religious organization affiliated with the <strong>Rashtriya</strong><br>
<strong>Svayamsevak Sangh</strong> (RSS), a conservative Hindu organization whose express<br>
purpose is to provide the leadership<br>
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The<br>
VHP was formed in 1964, when RSS leader<br>
<strong>Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar</strong> met in<br>
Bombay with a group of Hindu religious<br>
leaders. Their immediate concern was<br>
the upcoming visit of Pope Paul VI to<br>
India, which they interpreted as a concealed attempt to convert Hindus to<br>
Christianity, and resolved to oppose by<br>
forming an organization dedicated to<br>
the propagation of Hinduism. For the<br>
next fifteen years, the VHP focused its<br>
attention on countering Christian missionary efforts in northeastern India,<br>
with little fanfare and little impact on<br>
the public consciousness.<br>
A watershed in the VHP’s public image<br>
came in 1982, following the conversion<br>
of some untouchables to Islam in the<br>
<strong>Tamil Nadu</strong> village of Minakshipuram.<br>
The VHP used this much-publicized<br>
event as evidence that Hindu identity<br>
was endangered and countered it by<br>
launching a series of innovative public<br>
761<br>
Vishva Hindu Parishad<br>
actions, first in Tamil Nadu, but later<br>
extending throughout the entire nation.<br>
The VHP’s renewed activity corresponded<br>
with a more activist bent in its parent<br>
organization, the RSS, as well as the decision by the <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party</strong> (BJP),<br>
a political organization that is also an RSS<br>
affiliate, to assume a more militantly<br>
Hindu identity. Many of the VHP’s<br>
national campaigns coincided with<br>
national or state elections, and many of<br>
these centered on the campaign to build<br>
a temple to the god <strong>Rama</strong> in the city of<br>
<strong>Ayodhya</strong>, at the site claimed to be<br>
Rama’s birthplace. The site on which<br>
they proposed to build the temple was<br>
occupied by a Muslim mosque, the<br>
<strong>Babri Masjid</strong>, which the VHP claimed<br>
had been built only after tearing down<br>
the original Rama temple. This temple<br>
campaign thus carried powerful images<br>
of past oppression, as well as the<br>
assertiveness of a renascent Hindu identity. The VHP’s activism has enormously<br>
boosted the BJP’s political fortunes, and<br>
helped make it the dominant political<br>
party through much of northern India.<br>
The VHP’s activism has generated<br>
sharply contrasting emotions throughout India. Proponents point to its long<br>
record of social service and its role in<br>
helping strengthen and define a modern Hindu identity. Detractors point to<br>
its disregard for the niceties of law,<br>
which was epitomized by the destruction of the Babri Masjid in December<br>
1992, its often vitriolic anti-Muslim<br>
rhetoric, and its ultimate control by the<br>
RSS, despite its separate institutional<br>
identity. Other critics have censured<br>
the VHP for attempting to declare certain “required” Hindu rites as antithetical to the Hindu tradition and for<br>
attempting to define and control the<br>
nature of “Hinduism.” Other critics<br>
question the organization’s claim to<br>
speak for all Hindus, noting that its real<br>
power lies in the hands of <strong>brahmins</strong> and<br>
other privileged classes; these critics see<br>
the VHP as an organization designed to<br>
conceal its true purpose, the maintenance of upper-class influence and privilege. For further information see Walter<br>
K. Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, <em>The</em><br>
