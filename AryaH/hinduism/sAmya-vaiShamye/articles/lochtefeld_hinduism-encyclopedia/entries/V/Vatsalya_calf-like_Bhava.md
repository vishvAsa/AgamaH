title = "Vatsalya (“calf-like”) Bhava"

+++
The fourth of the five **modes of devotion**  
to God that were most prominently  
articulated by **Rupa Goswami**, a devotee  
(**bhakta**) of the god **Krishna** and a follower of the Bengali saint **Chaitanya**.  
Rupa used differing types of human  
relationships as models for differing  
conceptions of the link between **deity**  
and devotee. These five models showed  
growing emotional intensity, from the  
peaceful (**shanta**) sense that comes  
from realizing one’s complete identity  
with **Brahman** or Supreme Reality, to  
conceiving of God as one’s master,  
friend, child, or lover. In the Vatsalya  
mode of devotion, devotees consider  
themselves as God’s parents, lavishing  
love and care on the deity as a **cow** cares  
for her calf. This is an emotionally  
intense mode of relationship, but without the **erotic** element present in the  
fifth mode, **madhurya bhava**.
