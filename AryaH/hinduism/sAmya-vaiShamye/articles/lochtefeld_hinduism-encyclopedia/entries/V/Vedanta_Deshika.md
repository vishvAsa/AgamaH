title = "Vedanta Deshika"

+++
(13th c.) Writer and commentator in the  
**Vishishthadvaita Vedanta** philosophical school. Vedanta Deshika was a follower of **Ramanuja** and interpreted  
Ramanuja as teaching that there were  
two sorts of liberation: a lower one in  
which one was subject to no outside  
forces, and a higher one in which one’s  
entire being was focused on the Lord,  
whom Ramanuja identified as the god  
**Vishnu**. The human being is considered  
both identical to and different from the  
Lord, which means the perfect identity  
is never possible; God’s transcendence  
leads to the exaltation of devotion  
(**bhakti**) and the stress on submission to  
God’s **grace**.
