(“hero”) In the context of **tantra**, a  
secret, ritually based religious practice,  
the vira is one of the modes of ritual  
expression. The tantric “hero” is said to  
be one who not only partakes of the Five  
Forbidden Things (**panchamakara**)—  
wine, fish, meat, parched grain, and sexual intercourse—in their elemental  
forms, but also uses this inversion of  
normal moral rules as a way to affirm  
the ultimate unity of all things in the  
universe. Aspirants adopting a heroic  
mode will often **worship** a powerful but  
dangerous **deity**, in which the ultimate  
affirmation of this unity is to affirm one’s  
identity with that deity. If one can do  
this successfully, it is believed to confer  
various powers, but if one fails it is said  
to lead to illness, insanity, or death. This  
is not a path without hazards, but  
through it the heroes quickly attain their  
desired goals.
