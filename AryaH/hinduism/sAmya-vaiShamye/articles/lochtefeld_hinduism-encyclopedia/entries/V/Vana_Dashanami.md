title = "Vana Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant  
ascetics who are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
**Shiva**. The Dashanamis were supposedly established by the ninth-century  
737  
Vana Dashanami  
philosopher, **Shankaracharya**, in an  
effort to create a corps of learned men  
who could help revitalize Hindu life.  
Each of the divisions is designated by a  
different name—in this case, vana (“forest”). Upon **initiation**, new members  
are given this name as a surname to  
their new **ascetic** names, thus allowing  
for immediate group identification.  
Aside from their individual identities,  
these ten “named” divisions are divided into four larger organizational  
groups. Each group has its headquarters in one of the four monastic centers  
(**maths**) supposedly established by  
Shankaracharya, as well as other particular religious associations. The Vana  
Dashanamis belong to the **Bhogawara**  
group, which is affiliated with the  
**Govardhan Math** in the city of **Puri**, on  
the bay of Bengal.
