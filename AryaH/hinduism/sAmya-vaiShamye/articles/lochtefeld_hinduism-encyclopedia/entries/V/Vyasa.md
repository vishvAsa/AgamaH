title = "Vyasa"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is traditionally considered to be the author of  
the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great **Sanskrit** epics. Vyasa is the **son** of  
the sage **Parashara** as a result of his dalliance with the ferrywoman **Satyavati**.  
Later in life Satyavati marries King  
**Shantanu** but only after extracting the  
promise that their children will rule,  
instead of Shantanu’s eldest son,  
**Bhishma**. Satyavati’s first son dies in  
childhood, and the second dies after his  
marriage but before having any children. In her desperation to preserve  
Shantanu’s line, Satyavati calls on Vyasa  
to sleep with her younger son’s wives,  
**Ambika** and **Ambalika**. According to  
tradition Vyasa is very ugly, and both of  
the **women** involuntarily react when  
Vyasa appears in her bed. Ambalika  
turns pale, causing her son, **Pandu**, to be  
born with an unnaturally pale complexion, and Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son, **Dhrtarashtra**, to be born  
blind. Vyasa also has sexual relations  
with Ambika’s maidservant, who gives  
herself to him willingly, and from her is  
born **Vidura**. The descendants of Pandu  
and Dhrtarashtra are the **Pandavas** and  
**Kauravas**, respectively, who are the two  
warring factions whose enmity drives  
the *Mahabharata*. Thus Vyasa is not only  
the author of the *Mahabharata*, but also  
the source of the two families whose  
struggle is described in it.
