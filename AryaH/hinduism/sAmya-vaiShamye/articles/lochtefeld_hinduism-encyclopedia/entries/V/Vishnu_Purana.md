title = "Vishnu Purana"

+++
One of the eighteen traditional **puranas**,  
which were an important genre of **smrti**  
texts, and the repository of much of traditional Indian mythology. The smrtis or  
“remembered” texts were a class of literature that although deemed important,  
were considered less authoritative than  
the **shrutis** or “heard” texts. In brief, the  
shrutis denoted the **Vedas**, the oldest  
and most authoritative Hindu religious  
texts, whereas the smrtis included the  
**Mahabharata** and the **Ramayana**, the  
**dharma literature**, the **Bhagavad Gita**,  
and the puranas. The puranas are compendia of all types of sacred lore, from  
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exaltation of various sacred sites (**tirthas**)  
and actions. Most of the puranas are  
highly sectarian, and as this one’s name  
clearly shows, it is focused on the **worship** of **Vishnu**. It gives an exhaustive  
account of Vishnu’s mythic deeds—  
many of which have become the common mythic currency for many  
traditional Hindus—as well as instructions for how, where, and when Vishnu  
is to be worshiped.
