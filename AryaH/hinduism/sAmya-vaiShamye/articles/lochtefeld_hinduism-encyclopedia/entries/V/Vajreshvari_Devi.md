(“**Goddess** of the Thunderbolt”)  
Presiding **deity** of the Vajreshvari temple  
in **Kangra**, **Himachal Pradesh**, and the  
only one of the nine **Shiwalik goddesses**  
whose temple is in an urban center.  
Kangra has a long tradition as a center of  
Goddess **worship** and may have been a  
site for practitioners of **tantra**, a secret,  
ritually based religious practice. The  
charter myth identifies Vajreshvari Devi  
as one of the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of  
sites sacred to the Goddess, which  
spreads throughout the subcontinent.  
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a  
body part of the dismembered goddess  
**Sati** fell to **earth**, taking form there as a  
different goddess; in the case of  
Vajreshvari Devi the body part was Sati’s  
breast—certainly a highly charged part  
of the female body, thus making it a  
more attractive place for tantric practitioners. Another indication of her possible connection comes from her name, in  
which the image of the thunderbolt carries associations with Buddhist tantric  
practice. For further information see  
Kathleen Erndl, *Victory to the Mother*,
