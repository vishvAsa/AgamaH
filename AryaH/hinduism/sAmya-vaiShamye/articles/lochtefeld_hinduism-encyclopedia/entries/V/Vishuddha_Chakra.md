title = "Vishuddha Chakra"

+++
In many schools of **yoga**, and in the  
secret, ritually based religious practice  
known as **tantra**, the vishuddha chakra  
is one of the six psychic centers  
(**chakras**) believed to exist in the **subtle body**. The subtle body is an alternate physiological system, believed to  
exist on a different plane than gross  
matter, but with certain correspondences to the material body. It is visualized as a set of six psychic centers,  
which are visualized as multipetaled  
lotus flowers running roughly along  
the course of the spine, connected by  
three vertical channels. Each of these  
chakras has important symbolic associationsâ€”with differing human capacities, with different subtle elements  
(**tanmatras**), and with different seed  
syllables (**bijaksharas**) formed from  
the letters of the **Sanskrit** alphabet,  
thus encompassing all sacred sound.  
Above and below these centers are the  
bodily abodes of **Shiva** (awareness)  
and **Shakti** (power), the two divine  
principles through which the entire  
universe has come into being. The  
underlying assumption behind this  
concept of the subtle body is thus the  
homology of macrocosm and microcosm, an essential Hindu idea since  
the time of the mystical texts known as  
the **Upanishads**.  
The six chakras are traditionally enumerated from the bottom up, and the  
vishuddha chakra is the fifth. It is visualized as a sixteen-petaled lotus, located  
in the region of the throat. The petals  
each contain a seed syllable formed  
from a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, in  
this case all sixteen of the Sanskrit vowels, the essential connecting elements  
for any meaningful speech. On a symbolic level, the vishuddha chakra is associated with the human capacity for  
speech and respiration. It is also identified as the bodily seat for the subtle element of **space** (**akasha**), through which  
hearing is believed to take place. For further information see Arthur Avalon (Sir  
John Woodroffe), *Shakti and Shakta*,

*Tantra*, 1973.
