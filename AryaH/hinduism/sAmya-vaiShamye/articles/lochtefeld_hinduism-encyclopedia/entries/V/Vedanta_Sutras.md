title = "Vedanta Sutras"

+++
Text ascribed to the sage **Badarayana** in  
the third to fifth century B.C.E. Along  
with the **Upanishads** and the **Bhagavad**  
**Gita**, the *Vedanta Sutras* is one of the  
three traditional sources for the **Vedanta**  
school, one of the **six schools** of  
traditional Hindu **philosophy**. The text  
itself is a collection of 555 brief aphorisms (**sutras**), which are so terse that  
they presuppose a commentary. The  
sutras focus particularly on the ideas  
about **Brahman**, hence their other  
common name, the **Brahma Sutra**. In  
content, the first section describes the  
nature of Absolute Reality, the second  
responds to objections and criticizes  
other positions, the third details  
the means to acquire knowledge, and  
the fourth describes the benefits of  
such knowledge.
