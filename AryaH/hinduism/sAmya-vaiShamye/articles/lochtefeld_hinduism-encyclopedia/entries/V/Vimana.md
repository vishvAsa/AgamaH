title = "Vimana"

(“vehicle”) A word with different specific  
meanings in different contexts, a common feature in the **Sanskrit** language. It  
can refer to the vehicles used by a  
**deity**—either in a mythic sense, because  
each of the **deities** has an **animal** considered to be his or her vehicle, or in a literal sense as the cart used to carry them  
in procession, or to the human being  
who “carries” them through becoming  
possessed. In the context of **architecture**, the word *vimana* is used to refer to  
that part of the temple that “carries” the  
deity, that is, the sanctuary as a whole.
