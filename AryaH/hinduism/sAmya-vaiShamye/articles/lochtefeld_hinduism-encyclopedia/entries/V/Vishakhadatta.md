(6th c.) **Sanskrit** dramatist whose  
only surviving work is the play  
**Mudrarakshasa** (“**Rakshasa’s** Ring”).  
The play is of some historical interest,  
for its major theme is the rise of  
**Chandragupta Maurya** (r. 321–297  
B.C.E.), founder of the **Maurya dynasty**,  
although the play ascribes his success to  
the machinations of his cunning **brahmin** minister, **Chanakya**. The play  
paints the king as a weak figure, with the  
minister as the real power behind the  
throne, although in fairness to the  
historical king this portrayal seems  
inaccurate. The drama’s plot is highly  
complex, as with many **Sanskrit** plays,  
but its climax comes when the principal  
characters are dramatically rescued  
from execution at the last moment.  
The play has been translated into  
English by Michael Coulson, and  
published in an anthology titled *Three*  
*Sanskrit Plays*, 1981.
