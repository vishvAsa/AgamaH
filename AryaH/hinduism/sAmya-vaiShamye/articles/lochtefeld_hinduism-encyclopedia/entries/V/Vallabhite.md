title = "Vallabhite"

+++
Popular name for the followers of  
**Vallabhacharya**. As the suffix clearly  
shows, this term is one term formed by  
non-Hindus that was used to describe a  
particular Hindu group. In earlier times  
it was used by British government officials, but today it is used mainly by  
scholars, usually foreigners. Vallabhaâ€™s  
own followers would be far more likely  
to describe themselves as belonging to  
the **Pushti Marg**.
