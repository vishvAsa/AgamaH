title = "Vrtra"

+++
(“obstruction”) The name of the **demon**  
killed by the storm-god **Indra** in one of the  
hymns from the **Rg Veda** (1.32), the oldest  
Hindu religious text. In this hymn Vrtra is  
described as a serpent obstructing the free  
flow of waters, hence his name. The action  
in this hymn is one of Indra’s defining  
deeds, in which he destroys the serpent,  
cuts it into pieces, and releases the waters  
to run free. Some interpreters inclined to  
read the **Vedas** as historical record have  
seen in this hymn the breaching of the  
dams constructed by the **Indus Valley civilization** by the incoming **Aryans**, but  
there is little proof that such an incident  
ever happened.
