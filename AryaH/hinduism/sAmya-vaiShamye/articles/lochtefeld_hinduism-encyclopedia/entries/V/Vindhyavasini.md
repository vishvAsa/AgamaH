title = "Vindhyavasini"

+++
(“dweller in the Vindhyas”) Powerful  
form of the great **Goddess**. The  
**Vindhyas** are a mountain range in  
central India that are difficult to  
reach, inhabited by tribal peoples,  
754  
Vinata  
and seen as a place at the margins of  
civilized society. As the goddess who  
dwells in that place, Vindhyavasini is  
equally marginal, often seen as a  
fierce and dangerous **deity** who  
demands **blood sacrifices** from her  
devotees (**bhakta**). The mythology of  
Vindhyavasini is associated with various places in the Vindhyas, but for  
centuries, her primary temple has  
been in the village of Vindhyachal  
near the city of Mirzapur in the state  
of **Uttar Pradesh**, although she is  
worshiped in other places in northern  
India. One of her charter myths identifies her as the goddess (in infant  
form) exchanged for the infant god  
**Krishna** and killed by Krishna’s  
wicked uncle, **Kamsa**. After taunting  
Kamsa that the child he seeks has  
already escaped, she flies off and  
takes up residence in the Vindhyas.  
Since other accounts identify this  
goddess as **Bhadrakali**, this points to  
the fluidity of the Hindu pantheon, in  
which the renditions differ in the various accounts, according to the purpose of the writers. For further  
information see David R. Kinsley,  
*Hindu Goddesses*, 1986; and Cynthia  
Humes, “The Goddess of the  
Vindhyas in Banaras,” in Cynthia  
Humes and Bradley R. Hertel, *Living*
