  <meta property="og:description" content="One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school purporting to
reveal the ultimate meaning and purpose (anta) of the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Vishishthadvaita’s greatest figure
is the eleventh-century philosopher,
Ramanuja, who was central to its formation, although he was building on
earlier work. Ramanuja was convinced
that Brahman or Supreme Reality was a
personal deity, rather than an impersonal abstract principle, and he was
also convinced that devotion (bhakti)
was the most important form of religious practice. Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions and
thus opposed the position of the
Advaita Vedanta school, founded by
the philosopher Shankaracharya.
The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief in a single
impersonal Ultimate Reality, which they
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,
reality is “nondual” (advaita)—that is,
all things are nothing but the formless
Brahman, despite the appearance of difference and diversity in the perceivable
world. For the Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate nature of
things and a manifestation of avidya.
Although often translated as “ignorance,” avidya is better understood as
the lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage, reincarnation (samsara), and suffering.
Since for the Advaitins the real problem
is this mistaken understanding, this
means that realization (jnana) was the
best spiritual path to gain final liberation (moksha).
According to Ramanuja’s formulation, the material world and selves have
real and independent existence,
although their existence is ultimately
rooted in God, whom he identifies as
Vishnu. The world comes from God in a
process of evolution adapted from the
Samkhya model, but since matter is
unconscious, it is both similar to and
different from God. In the same way,
human beings share similarity to God in
having God as their source, and difference from him in being subject to ignorance and suffering. For Ramanuja and
his followers, God is not identical to
Selves or the world, all of which are perceived as having real and independent
existence. This doctrine of identity and
difference makes the perceivable world
real, in a sense that the Advaita proponents would never admit. This same
contention of simultaneous identity and
difference distinguishes Ramanuja’s
position from that of a later thinker,
Madhva, whose Dvaita Vedanta stressed
the great gulf between God and all other
things. Given this difference in capacities between deity and devotee (bhakta),
Ramanuja and his followers have
stressed bhakti as the most efficacious
means to salvation. Even after liberation
the souls retain enough of a distinction
758
Vishakhadatta
from God to make devotion possible;
liberation is seen not as loss of identity,
but as eternal communion with God.

Ramanuja, 1974; and Sarvepalli

  <p>One of the branches of <strong>Vedanta</strong>, the<br>
philosophical school purporting to<br>
reveal the ultimate meaning and purpose (anta) of the <strong>Vedas</strong>, the oldest and<br>
most authoritative Hindu religious<br>
texts. Vishishthadvaita’s greatest figure<br>
is the eleventh-century philosopher,<br>
<strong>Ramanuja</strong>, who was central to its formation, although he was building on<br>
earlier work. Ramanuja was convinced<br>
that <strong>Brahman</strong> or Supreme Reality was a<br>
personal <strong>deity</strong>, rather than an impersonal abstract principle, and he was<br>
also convinced that devotion (<strong>bhakti</strong>)<br>
was the most important form of religious practice. Vishishthadvaita<br>
Vedanta, his philosophical position,<br>
stressed both of these convictions and<br>
thus opposed the position of the<br>
<strong>Advaita Vedanta</strong> school, founded by<br>
the philosopher <strong>Shankaracharya</strong>.<br>
The Advaita school upholds a<br>
philosophical position known as<br>
monism, which is the belief in a single<br>
impersonal Ultimate Reality, which they<br>
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,<br>
reality is “nondual” (<strong>advaita</strong>)—that is,<br>
all things are nothing but the formless<br>
Brahman, despite the appearance of difference and diversity in the perceivable<br>
world. For the Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate nature of<br>
things and a manifestation of <strong>avidya</strong>.<br>
Although often translated as “ignorance,” avidya is better understood as<br>
the lack of genuine understanding,<br>
which ultimately causes human beings<br>
to be trapped in karmic bondage, reincarnation (<strong>samsara</strong>), and suffering.<br>
Since for the Advaitins the real problem<br>
is this mistaken understanding, this<br>
means that realization (<strong>jnana</strong>) was the<br>
best spiritual path to gain final liberation (<strong>moksha</strong>).<br>
According to Ramanuja’s formulation, the material world and selves have<br>
real and independent existence,<br>
although their existence is ultimately<br>
rooted in God, whom he identifies as<br>
<strong>Vishnu</strong>. The world comes from God in a<br>
process of <strong>evolution</strong> adapted from the<br>
<strong>Samkhya</strong> model, but since matter is<br>
unconscious, it is both similar to and<br>
different from God. In the same way,<br>
human beings share similarity to God in<br>
having God as their source, and difference from him in being subject to ignorance and suffering. For Ramanuja and<br>
his followers, God is not identical to<br>
Selves or the world, all of which are perceived as having real and independent<br>
existence. This doctrine of identity and<br>
difference makes the perceivable world<br>
real, in a sense that the Advaita proponents would never admit. This same<br>
contention of simultaneous identity and<br>
difference distinguishes Ramanuja’s<br>
position from that of a later thinker,<br>
<strong>Madhva</strong>, whose <strong>Dvaita Vedanta</strong> stressed<br>
the great gulf between God and all other<br>
things. Given this difference in capacities between deity and devotee (<strong>bhakta</strong>),<br>
Ramanuja and his followers have<br>
stressed bhakti as the most efficacious<br>
means to salvation. Even after liberation<br>

Vishakhadatta<br>
from God to make devotion possible;<br>
liberation is seen not as loss of identity,<br>
but as eternal communion with God.<br>
