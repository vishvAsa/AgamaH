title = "Virata"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Virata is the king  
who shelters the five **Pandava** brothers,  
the epic’s protagonists, during the year  
they spend incognito, following their  
twelve years of exile in the forest. This  
year is critical because according to the  
agreement that the Pandavas have  
made with their adversary, **Duryodhana**,  
if they are discovered during this year  
the cycle of exile and living incognito  
will begin again. Due to Virata’s care  
and foresight the Pandavas are not  
discovered, even though Duryodhana  
has sent legions of spies to find them.  
During the Mahabharata war he continues to support the Pandavas and is  
eventually killed by the archery  
master **Drona**.
