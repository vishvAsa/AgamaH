title = "Vishvakarma"

+++
(“doing all things”) A minor **deity** whose  
mythic roles include being the architect  
of the gods; creator of innumerable  
handicrafts, ornaments, and weapons;  
the finest sculptor; and the inventor of  
the aerial chariots used by the gods. He  
is the patron and paradigm for all the  
skilled crafts in which materials are  
shaped and formed, and in particular he  
is said to have fixed the canons for carving images of the gods. According to one  
story, Vishvakarma’s **daughter**, **Sanjna**,  
is married to **Surya**, the **sun**, but  
because of the sun’s radiance cannot  
bear to be with him. Vishvakarma takes  
the sun to his workshop and trims off  
enough of his effulgence so that Sanjna  
can bear his brightness. He then shapes  
the cut-off pieces of the sun into the  
god **Vishnu’s** discus (**Sudarshana**), the  
god **Shiva’s** trident (**trishul**), various  
other divine weapons, and the **Pushpak**  
**Viman**, the most famous of the  
aerial chariots.  
Vishvakarma is sometimes identified  
with **Tvashtr**, the workman of the gods  
in the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious  
texts. Yet it seems that these are two different deities, homologized to each  
other through their common function.  
Tvashtr’s name means “builder of carriages,” and this seems to have been his  
primary function, although he is also  
noted for crafting the weapons of the  
gods, especially the mace with which  
the storm-god **Indra** slays the serpent  
**Vrtra**. Still, his name seems to indicate that his major function is in  
building carriages, which is believed  
to be highly significant in a Vedic context, since many Vedic hymns mention  
762  
Vishvakarma  
the use of military chariots. Vishvakarma,  
on the other hand, has much more  
wide-ranging skills, and this would  
seem to indicate that the two are not the  
same deity.
