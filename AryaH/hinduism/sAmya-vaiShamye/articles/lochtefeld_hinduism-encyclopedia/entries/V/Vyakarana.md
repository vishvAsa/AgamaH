title = "Vyakarana"

+++
(“analysis”) One of the six **Vedangas**.  
These were the auxiliary branches of  
knowledge connected with the **Vedas**,  
the oldest Hindu religious texts, and all  
the Vedangas were associated with the  
use of the Vedas. In its essence,  
vyakarana is the study of **Sanskrit** grammar, which was obviously essential to  
understanding the Vedic texts (which  
were written in Sanskrit). Vyakarana’s  
role as the gatekeeper to the Sanskrit  
language made grammar the queen  
of the traditional learned sciences,  
and in many contexts it is what is  
meant by the term *vidya* (“knowledge”).  
Aside from vyakarana, the other  
Vedangas are **shiksha** (correct pronunciation), **chandas** (Sanskrit prosody),  
**kalpa** (ritual instructions), **nirukta**  
(etymology), and **jyotisha** (auspicious  
times for sacrifices).
