(“World Hindu Organization,” hereafter  
VHP) Modern Hindu religious organization affiliated with the **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS), a conservative Hindu organization whose express  
purpose is to provide the leadership  
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The  
VHP was formed in 1964, when RSS leader  
**Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar** met in  
Bombay with a group of Hindu religious  
leaders. Their immediate concern was  
the upcoming visit of Pope Paul VI to  
India, which they interpreted as a concealed attempt to convert Hindus to  
Christianity, and resolved to oppose by  
forming an organization dedicated to  
the propagation of Hinduism. For the  
next fifteen years, the VHP focused its  
attention on countering Christian missionary efforts in northeastern India,  
with little fanfare and little impact on  
the public consciousness.  
A watershed in the VHP’s public image  
came in 1982, following the conversion  
of some untouchables to Islam in the  
**Tamil Nadu** village of Minakshipuram.  
The VHP used this much-publicized  
event as evidence that Hindu identity  
was endangered and countered it by  
launching a series of innovative public  
761  
Vishva Hindu Parishad  
actions, first in Tamil Nadu, but later  
extending throughout the entire nation.  
The VHP’s renewed activity corresponded  
with a more activist bent in its parent  
organization, the RSS, as well as the decision by the **Bharatiya Janata Party** (BJP),  
a political organization that is also an RSS  
affiliate, to assume a more militantly  
Hindu identity. Many of the VHP’s  
national campaigns coincided with  
national or state elections, and many of  
these centered on the campaign to build  
a temple to the god **Rama** in the city of  
**Ayodhya**, at the site claimed to be  
Rama’s birthplace. The site on which  
they proposed to build the temple was  
occupied by a Muslim mosque, the  
**Babri Masjid**, which the VHP claimed  
had been built only after tearing down  
the original Rama temple. This temple  
campaign thus carried powerful images  
of past oppression, as well as the  
assertiveness of a renascent Hindu identity. The VHP’s activism has enormously  
boosted the BJP’s political fortunes, and  
helped make it the dominant political  
party through much of northern India.  
The VHP’s activism has generated  
sharply contrasting emotions throughout India. Proponents point to its long  
record of social service and its role in  
helping strengthen and define a modern Hindu identity. Detractors point to  
its disregard for the niceties of law,  
which was epitomized by the destruction of the Babri Masjid in December  
1992, its often vitriolic anti-Muslim  
rhetoric, and its ultimate control by the  
RSS, despite its separate institutional  
identity. Other critics have censured  
the VHP for attempting to declare certain “required” Hindu rites as antithetical to the Hindu tradition and for  
attempting to define and control the  
nature of “Hinduism.” Other critics  
question the organization’s claim to  
speak for all Hindus, noting that its real  
power lies in the hands of **brahmins** and  
other privileged classes; these critics see  
the VHP as an organization designed to  
conceal its true purpose, the maintenance of upper-class influence and privilege. For further information see Walter
