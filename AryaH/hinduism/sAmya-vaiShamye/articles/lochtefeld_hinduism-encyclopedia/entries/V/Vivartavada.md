title = "Vivartavada"

+++
A philosophical model used to explain  
the relationship between the Ultimate  
Reality or Realities and the perceivable  
world; this model describes the world as  
an illusory transformation of this reality.  
The vivartavada model is unique to the  
**Advaita Vedanta** philosophical school.  
The Advaitins are proponents of a  
**causal model** called **satkaryavada**,  
which assumes that effects already exist  
in their causes, and that when these  
effects appear, they represent transformations (**parinama**) of those causes. The  
classic example is the transformation of  
milk to curds, butter, and clarified butter. According to asatkarya’s proponents,  
each of these effects was already present  
in the cause and emerges from it through  
a natural transformation of that cause.  
The Advaita school upholds a philosophical position known as monism,  
which is the belief that a single Ultimate  
Reality lies behind all things and that all  
things are merely differing forms of that  
reality. Advaita proponents exemplify this  
belief in their claim that reality is nondual  
(**advaita**)—that is, that all things are “actually” nothing but the formless, unqualified  
**Brahman**, despite the appearance of difference and diversity in the world. The  
Advaitins’ belief that an effect already  
exists in its cause comes from the principle that all things in the universe ultimately depend on Brahman as a first cause. At  
the same time the Advaitins are unwilling  
to admit that Brahman ever undergoes  
actual change because this would nullify  
its eternal and unchanging nature. For this  
reason, they speak of an illusory transformation (vivartavada). For the Advaitins,  
Brahman never really changes, because it  
is eternal and thus unchanging; the  
apparent changes are only illusory, based  
on human ignorance through changing  
patterns of superimposition (**adhyasa**). In  
this way the Advaitins can maintain the  
transcendence of Brahman and at the  
same time account for the (apparent)  
changes in the phenomenal world.  
This position is contested by proponents of another model, which describes  
the perceivable world as an actual transformation of this single reality. This position is espoused by proponents of the  
**Samkhya**, **Vishishthadvaita Vedanta**, and  
**Bhedabhada** philosophical schools, who  
like the Advaitins are also proponents of  
satkaryavada. Each of these three schools  
believes that the world as perceived is real,  
that it has some single ultimate source  
behind it, and that this first principle  
undergoes a real transformation by which  
the world comes into being. This parinama relationship allows these schools to  
explain the phenomenal world but in a  
way that compromises the transcendence  
of these first principles by making them  
part of the world. Philosophically, their  
difficulties come in describing how the  
transcendent can become mundane, and  
then become transcendent again.
