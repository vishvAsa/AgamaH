(“color”) Theoretical system dividing  
Indian society into four major groups,  
each with a differing occupation and  
status: **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, **vaishya**,  
and **shudra**. The highest status was held  
by the brahmins, who were priests and  
scholars, next came the kshatriyas, who  
were kings and soldiers, then the  
vaishyas, whose purview was economic  
life, and finally the shudras, who were  
supposed to serve the others. This picture is articulated as early as the **Vedas**,  
the oldest Hindu religious texts, in particular by a hymn in the **Rg Veda** (10.90)  
known the **Purusha Sukta**. The Purusha  
Sukta describes the creation of the world  
and of society as stemming from the  
**sacrifice** of the Primeval Man  
(**purusha**), with the brahmins coming  
from his mouth, the kshatriyas from his  
shoulders, the vaishyas from his thighs  
(a common euphemism for the genitals), and the shudras from his feet.  
This four-fold scheme is conceptually  
neat, but the real picture was far more  
complex. For one thing, none of these  
four varnas was as uniform as this  
scheme might lead one to suppose:  
Each of the varnas had multiple occupationally defined subcommunities  
known as **jatis**, which often competed  
for status with one another, even though  
they may have been members of the  
same varna. The other discrepancy was  
that local circumstances had a great  
effect on any particular community’s  
social status. As one example, the  
**Vellala** community in **Tamil Nadu** had a  
great deal of status and power, even  
though they were technically **shudras**,  
because they were a landholding community. On the opposite end, it is not  
uncommon for brahmins in northern
