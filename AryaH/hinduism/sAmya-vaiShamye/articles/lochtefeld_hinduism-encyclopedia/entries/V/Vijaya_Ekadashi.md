title = "Vijaya Ekadashi"

+++
Religious observance falling on the  
eleventh **day** (**ekadashi**) of the dark  
(waning) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Phalgun** (Februaryâ€“March). As for all  
the eleventh-day observances, this is  
dedicated to the **worship** of **Vishnu**.  
Most Hindu festivals have certain prescribed rites, which usually involve fasting (**upavasa**) and worship and often  
promise specific benefits for faithful  
performance. Those performing this  
vow should fill an earthen pot with the  
seven kinds of grain, set an image of  
Vishnu on the pot, and for twenty-four  
hours, remain engaged in chanting the  
names of Vishnu. On the twelfth the pot  
of grain should be given to a **brahmin**.  
As for results, faithfully observing this  
festival is said to bring victory (**vijaya**)  
over poverty and unhappiness.
