title = "Vrat"

+++
Term denoting a religious vow, usually  
thought to be derived from the verb  
meaning “to choose.” As religious observances, vrats are an important part of  
modern Hindu life. They may refer to  
religious practices performed once a  
**year** with particular festivals, such as the  
vrat performed on **Shivaratri**, or to  
more regular religious observances,  
such as those connected to the monthly  
lunar **calendar** (e.g., the **ekadashi** rites)  
or those performed on the day of the  
**week** associated with a particular patron  
**deity**. The specific prescriptions for  
these vrats vary widely, but there are  
several common features. They usually  
involve modification of diet—sometimes through fasting (**upavasa**), and  
other times by **eating** or avoiding certain types of food. Another constant feature is **worship** of the presiding deity.  
Part of this worship usually involves  
reading or hearing the vrat’s charter  
myth, which tells how the vrat was  
established, how one should perform it,  
and what sort of benefits it brings. Vrats  
connected with festivals are performed  
by all sorts of people, but weekly vrats  
(such as the **Santoshi Ma Vrat**) are most  
often performed by married **women** to  
promote the health, safety, and prosperity of their families. Although such  
weekly vrats are theoretically voluntary,  
they have become an expected element  
in women’s religious life, through which  
women by their sacrifices can safeguard  
their family’s welfare. For further consideration of women’s rites, see Mary  
McGee, “Desired Fruits: Motive And  
Intention in the Votive Rites of Hindu  
Women,” in Julia Leslie, ed., *Roles and*  
*Rituals for Hindu Women*, 1991; and
