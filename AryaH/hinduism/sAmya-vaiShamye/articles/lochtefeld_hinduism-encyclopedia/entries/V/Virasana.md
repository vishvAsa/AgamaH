One of the sitting postures (**asana**)  
described in commentaries to the **Yoga**  
**Sutras**; this is also one of the sitting postures in which **deities** are portrayed in  
Hindu iconography. As described in the  
commentaries to the Yoga Sutras, in this  
position one foot rests on the ground,  
under the opposite thigh, while the  
other foot rests on top of the opposite  
knee. In modern yoga manuals this posture is described quite differently, as a  
sitting posture with the legs folded back  
outside the body, with the feet pressed  
against the thighs and buttocks.
