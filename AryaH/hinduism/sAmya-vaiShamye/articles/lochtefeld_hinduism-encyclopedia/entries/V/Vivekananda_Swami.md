title = "Vivekananda, Swami"

+++
(b. Narendranath Datta 1863–1902) Bestknown disciple of the Bengali mystic  
**Ramakrishna** and also the first Hindu  
missionary to the West. Narendranath had  
received a good education and had originally intended to be a lawyer; on meeting  
Ramakrishna he was initially skeptical and  
questioning but in the course of a year  
became transformed. After Ramakrishna’s  
death he spent several years roaming  
through India, gradually coming to the  
conclusion that religious life had to  
address India’s material needs as well as its  
spiritual ones. Vivekananda is most  
famous for his address to the First **World**  
**Parliament of Religions** in Chicago in  
1893, in which Hinduism—in its rational,  
Vedantic form—was first seriously  
received by his Western hearers. For the  
next four years, he lectured in America  
and in England and returned to India to  
widespread acclaim. He devoted the rest  
of his short life to fostering the  
**Ramakrishna Mission**, a religious organization intended to promote social uplift as  
767  
Vivekananda, Swami  
well as religious education. For further
