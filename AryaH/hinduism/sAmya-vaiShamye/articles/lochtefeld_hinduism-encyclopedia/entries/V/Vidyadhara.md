title = "Vidyadhara"

+++
(“wisdom-bearer”) Class of semidivine  
beings. The Vidyadharas are generally  
believed to live in the **Himalayas**  
and are thus often associated with  
the god **Shiva**, whose home is also said  
to be there. Vidyadharas are generally  
benevolent toward human beings and  
are often (as their name suggests)  
associated with bringing wisdom to  
those they favor.
