title = "Vitthalnath"

+++
(r. 1566â€“1585) Second **guru** of the  
**Pushti Marg** (a religious community),  
which was founded by his father,  
**Vallabhacharya**. Vitthalnath continued  
the consolidation of the Pushti Marg, in  
particular the organization of its rites,  
and in fostering the composition of  
songs and poetry to accompany them.  
According to tradition, the eight poets  
known as the **ashtachap** were all active  
during his tenure, although four of them  
are more closely associated with his  
father. The four poets associated with  
Vitthalnath were clearly members of the  
Pushti Marg, for among their poetry can  
be found hymns praising him and his  
leadership. He was succeeded by his **son**  
**Gokulnath**, under whose direction the  
lives of these and other saints were finally written down, with each being given a  
**Vallabhite** emphasis.
