Form of the god **Shiva**, in his manifestation as the “Lord of the Universe” at the  
Vishvanath temple in **Benares**. Shiva is  
present at Vishvanath in the form of a  
**linga**, the pillar-shaped image that is his  
symbolic form; the Vishvanath linga is  
one of the twelve **jyotirlingas**, a network  
of sites deemed especially sacred to  
Shiva, and at which **Shiva** is uniquely  
present. Benares, or **Varanasi**, is one of  
the most sacred cities in India; it is  
considered particularly sacred to Shiva,  
and of all the Shiva temples there,  
Vishvanath is the most important. The  
original temple was destroyed by the  
Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb**, who built  
a mosque on the site, and the only  
remaining part of the original temple is  
the **Gyan Vapi** (“well of knowledge”),  
into which the original Shiva linga was  
reportedly cast (to save it from desecration by Aurangzeb’s soldiers). The present temple was built in 1776 by the  
**Maratha** queen **Ahalya Bai Holkar**, on a  
site adjoining the original temple. It was  
later roofed with gold by Maharaja  
Ranjit Singh of Lahore, and thus one of  
its nicknames is the “Golden Temple.”  
Even in preceding centuries the history and proximity of the Vishvanath

Vishvanath Temple  
temple and Aurangzeb’s mosque made  
for delicate relations between the Hindu  
and Muslim communities, and like  
many northern Indian cities Benares has  
seen its share of bloodshed between  
these two communities. In recent times  
the destruction of the original Vishvanath  
temple has been taken up as a political  
issue by the **Vishva Hindu Parishad**  
(VHP), a Hindu activist organization  
calling for the “return” of this and other  
northern Indian sites by force if necessary. The VHP’s presence and activity have  
significantly escalated tensions between  
Hindus and Muslims as a whole. Given  
the political gains that these confrontational strategies have brought, it seems  
likely that they will continue in the future  
and that the Vishvanath temple will be a  
site connected with conflict.
