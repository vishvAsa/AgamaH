title = "Vivaha (“uplift”) Samskara"

+++
Traditionally, the fifteenth of the lifecycle ceremonies (**samskaras**), in which  
a man and woman became husband  
and wife. Except for those rare individuals who remained lifelong celibates  
(**naisthika brahmacharin**), marriage  
was an essential element in the life  
of every man (and woman), since the  
children procreated through marriage  
allowed him to retire one of the **three**  
**debts**, this one to the **ancestral spirits**  
(pitr). One mark of the importance given  
to marriage can be seen in the literal  
translation of the word *vivaha*—it  
signifies that by which a man is  
“uplifted” and made complete. Given  
the stress on family in Indian society,  
marriage has also been a gravely  
important matter, and for many  
Indians, it remains the most important  
day of their life. The **dharma**  
**literature** underlines the importance of  
marriage by cataloging eight different  
forms. See also **marriage**, **eight**  
**classical forms**.
