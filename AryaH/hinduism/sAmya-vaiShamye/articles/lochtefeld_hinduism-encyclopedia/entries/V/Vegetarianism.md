title = "Vegetarianism"

+++
A dietary practice that carries extremely  
high status among Hindu people, probably because of its associations with  
strict **brahmin** practice; even people  
who are nonvegetarian themselves will  
commonly think of a vegetarian diet as  
“purer.” Strict vegetarians eat no flesh or  
eggs, but milk and milk products are  
always eaten and are considered pure  
and health-giving, probably because  
they come from the **cow**. Those people  
who keep the strictest diets will also  
often refrain from onions and garlic,  
which are considered to excite the passions. This religious commitment to  
vegetarianism by a certain part of the  
population, and the general status given  
to “pure” vegetarian food, are both  
responsible for the great variety of vegetarian cooking found in Indian culture.  
Despite the higher status given to a vegetarian diet, most modern Hindus are  
not vegetarian—a recent poll of urban  
Hindus found that only about 25 percent were pure vegetarian, although the  
number may be higher in villages, which  
tend to be more traditional.
