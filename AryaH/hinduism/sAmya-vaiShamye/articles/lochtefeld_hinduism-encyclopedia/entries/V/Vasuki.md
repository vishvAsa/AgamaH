title = "Vasuki"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a famous **Naga**  
(mythical serpent). Vasukiâ€™s most famous  
mythic role comes in the story in which  
the gods and **demons** churn the Ocean  
of Milk to obtain the nectar of immortality (**amrta**). In the form of his **Tortoise**  
**avatar**, the god **Vishnu** serves as the  
churning-base, Mount **Mandara** serves  
as the churning-stick, and Vasuki, with  
his enormous length, as the churningrope. With the gods on one side and the  
demons on the other, they pull Vasuki  
back and forth until the sea of milk gives  
up its treasures.
