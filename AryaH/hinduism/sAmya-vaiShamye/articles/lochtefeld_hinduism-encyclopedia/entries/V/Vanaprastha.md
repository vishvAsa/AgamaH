title = "Vanaprastha"

+++
(“forest-dweller”) According to the  
**dharma literature**, the vanaprastha was  
the third of the idealized **stages of life**  
(ashrama) for a **twice-born** man, that is,  
a man born into the **brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or **vaishya** communities, who had  
undergone the adolescent religious **initiation** known as the “second birth.”  
According to this idealized pattern, after  
engaging in religious learning as a celibate student (**brahmacharin**), the first  
stage; marrying and raising a family as a  
householder (**grhastha**), the second  
stage; a man should, in the third, gradually disengage himself from the world by  
giving up his attachments and withdrawing to a more secluded place. The  
renunciation in this third stage of life is  
738  
Vanamalin  
Varanasi ghats with pilgrims bathing in the Ganges.  
less severe than the last stage, the  
**Sanyasi**—the texts are very clear that he  
should remain with his wife and that he  
should continue to perform the prescribed daily domestic sacrifices.  
Although in contemporary times it is  
fairly common for older people to live a  
more retired life, bequeathing the bulk  
of the family affairs to their children, few  
people live by the strict prescriptions for  
the vanaprastha. The prescription for  
this third stage of life is generally considered to be a reaction to the growth of  
**asceticism** in the centuries before the  
turn of the common era, particularly the  
monastic asceticism of the Buddhists  
and Jains, which they claimed was religiously superior to the life of a householder. The vanaprastha is a transitional  
stage that paves the way for an **ascetic**  
life, but it is set in one’s old age and thus  
allows for the fulfilling of one’s duties to  
family and society.
