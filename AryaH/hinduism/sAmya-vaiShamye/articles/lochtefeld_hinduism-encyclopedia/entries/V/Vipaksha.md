title = "Vipaksha"

+++
In Indian **philosophy**, one of the parts  
in the accepted form of an inference  
(**anumana**). The accepted form of an  
inference has three parts: an assertion  
(**pratijna**), a reason (**hetu**), and examples (**drshtanta**); each of these three  
have their own constituent parts. The  
vipaksha is part of the third term, the  
examples, and is a negative example  
given to show that the claim made in  
the initial assertion is one that reflects  
the action of particular causes. For  
example, in the inference, “there is  
fire on the mountain because there is  
smoke on the mountain,” the vipaksha could be “unlike a lake” since  
lakes are places with neither fire nor  
smoke, and thus shows that these  
conditions are not universally present  
(fire is found in mountains, but not in  
lakes). By convention, an inference  
also had to have a positive example,  
the **sapaksha**, to show that similar  
things happened in similar cases (i.e.,  
that there were other cases in which  
there was both fire and smoke).
