(“dismissing”) The sixteenth and last of  
the traditional **upacharas** (“**offerings**”)  
given to a **deity** as part of **worship**, on  
the model of treating the deity as an  
honored guest. In this offering, the  
devotee (**bhakta**) gives the deity leave to  
go, as the concluding rite in worship.  
Although the word dismissal sounds  
presumptuous in any interaction with a  
deity, this term really refers to the words  
of parting that one would say to any  
departing guest. The underlying motive  
here, as for all the upacharas, is to show  
one’s love for the deity and minister to  
the deity’s needs.
