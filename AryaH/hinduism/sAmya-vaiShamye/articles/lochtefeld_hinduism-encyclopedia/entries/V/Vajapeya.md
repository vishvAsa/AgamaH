title = "Vajapeya"

+++
Along with the **Rajasuya**, one of the  
two most famous of the Vedic sacrifices.  
The Vajapeya **sacrifice** was essentially  
intended to provide an established  
king with continuing strength and  
vitality, magically rejuvenating him  
after a long reign and in the face of  
advancing age. In ancient times the  
rite was elaborate and entailed the  
sacrifice of **animals**; when it is  
performed in modern times it is  
performed in one day, and the **animal**  
**sacrifice** is symbolic.
