title = "Vajroli Mudra"

+++
Yogic practice attributed to **Nathpanthi**  
ascetics, as part of their effort to attain  
physical immortality through the practice of **hatha yoga**. The dominant  
metaphor used in describing the  
process of gaining immortality in this  
manner is the union of **sun** and **moon**,  
in which the sun stands for the  
processes of change and destruction,  
and the moon for stability and immortality. In some cases this union was  
described in very abstract terms, as a  
process in the **subtle body**, at other  
times in the most concrete possible  
fashion, for which the best example is  
vajroli mudra. This is urethral suction  
or the “fountain-pen technique,” in  
which a man, having ejaculated into  
his female partner, draws his **semen**,  
now refined through contact with the  
woman’s uterine **blood**, back into his  
734  
Vaitarani  
body, along with a certain amount of  
his partner’s blood. Despite some commentators’ discomfort and denials  
(characteristic of most references to  
sexual activity as part of Hindu spiritual practice), vajroli mudra is consistently named as one of the Nathpanthi  
practices. For further information see
