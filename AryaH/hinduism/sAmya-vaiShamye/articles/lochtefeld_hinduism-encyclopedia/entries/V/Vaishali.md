title = "Vaishali"

+++
City and region in northern **Bihar**; the  
regionâ€™s western border is the **Gandaki**  
River, and its southern border the  
**Ganges** river. Although now the region  
is extremely backward, at the time of  
the Buddha, Vaishali was one of the  
largest cities in India and a center of  
intellectual culture of the time. Vaishali  
is famous as the birthplace of Mahavira.  
He was the last of the Jain tirthankars,  
the founding figures in the Jain religious  
tradition. Tradition also holds Vaishali  
as the site of the second Buddhist  
council, convened one hundred years  
after the death of the Buddha (ca. 386  
B.C.E.), at which the Buddhist community  
split between the Sthaviravadins and  
the Mahasanghikas.
