title = "Veda"

(“knowledge”) The oldest and most  
authoritative group of Hindu sacred  
texts, also designated by the term **shruti**  
(“heard”). According to tradition, these  
texts were not composed by human  
beings, but are based in the primordial  
vibrations of the cosmos itself. The  
ancient sages, whose faculties of perception had been honed through arduous religious practice, were able to  
“hear” and understand these vibrations,  
and transmitted them to others in a lineage of learning. On one level, the term  
*veda* is part of the names of four individual texts—the **Rg Veda**, **Sama Veda**,  
**Yajur Veda**, and **Atharva Veda**, each of  
which has a differing focus and content.  
The term *veda* is also a collective term  
for the material in these texts or their  
associated appendices: the Vedic hymns  
(**samhitas**), the **Brahmanas**, the  
**Aranyakas**, and the **Upanishads**.  
Although these four groups of texts are  
all considered part of the Vedas, they  
have very different forms and characteristics. The samhitas are hymns of praise  
addressed to particular **deities**, and are  
found mainly in the Rg Veda and the  
Sama Veda. In contrast, the Brahmanas  
are detailed ritual manuals, giving the  
instructions for performing complex  
sacrificial rites; the Aranyakas and the  
Upanishads are speculative ponderings  
on the nature of the cosmos. The Vedas  
were considered so sacred that for 3,000  
years they were not written down, but  
transmitted orally, a mode of transmission that still persists today. The Vedas’  
power comes not from their literal  
meaning, but from their very sound,  
which is the identical sound heard by  
the sages long ago. To safeguard this tradition, Hindus developed an elaborate  
system of **mnemonics** to ensure that the  
texts would not be altered or corrupted,  
thus preserving their efficacy.
