title = "Vishishthadvaita (“Qualified NonDualism”) Vedanta"

+++
One of the branches of **Vedanta**, the  
philosophical school purporting to  
reveal the ultimate meaning and purpose (anta) of the **Vedas**, the oldest and  
most authoritative Hindu religious  
texts. Vishishthadvaita’s greatest figure  
is the eleventh-century philosopher,  
**Ramanuja**, who was central to its formation, although he was building on  
earlier work. Ramanuja was convinced  
that **Brahman** or Supreme Reality was a  
personal **deity**, rather than an impersonal abstract principle, and he was  
also convinced that devotion (**bhakti**)  
was the most important form of religious practice. Vishishthadvaita  
Vedanta, his philosophical position,  
stressed both of these convictions and  
thus opposed the position of the  
**Advaita Vedanta** school, founded by  
the philosopher **Shankaracharya**.  
The Advaita school upholds a  
philosophical position known as  
monism, which is the belief in a single  
impersonal Ultimate Reality, which they  
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,  
reality is “nondual” (**advaita**)—that is,  
all things are nothing but the formless  
Brahman, despite the appearance of difference and diversity in the perceivable  
world. For the Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ultimate nature of  
things and a manifestation of **avidya**.  
Although often translated as “ignorance,” avidya is better understood as  
the lack of genuine understanding,  
which ultimately causes human beings  
to be trapped in karmic bondage, reincarnation (**samsara**), and suffering.  
Since for the Advaitins the real problem  
is this mistaken understanding, this  
means that realization (**jnana**) was the  
best spiritual path to gain final liberation (**moksha**).  
According to Ramanuja’s formulation, the material world and selves have  
real and independent existence,  
although their existence is ultimately  
rooted in God, whom he identifies as  
**Vishnu**. The world comes from God in a  
process of **evolution** adapted from the  
**Samkhya** model, but since matter is  
unconscious, it is both similar to and  
different from God. In the same way,  
human beings share similarity to God in  
having God as their source, and difference from him in being subject to ignorance and suffering. For Ramanuja and  
his followers, God is not identical to  
Selves or the world, all of which are perceived as having real and independent  
existence. This doctrine of identity and  
difference makes the perceivable world  
real, in a sense that the Advaita proponents would never admit. This same  
contention of simultaneous identity and  
difference distinguishes Ramanuja’s  
position from that of a later thinker,  
**Madhva**, whose **Dvaita Vedanta** stressed  
the great gulf between God and all other  
things. Given this difference in capacities between deity and devotee (**bhakta**),  
Ramanuja and his followers have  
stressed bhakti as the most efficacious  
means to salvation. Even after liberation  
the souls retain enough of a distinction  
758  
Vishakhadatta  
from God to make devotion possible;  
liberation is seen not as loss of identity,  
but as eternal communion with God.
