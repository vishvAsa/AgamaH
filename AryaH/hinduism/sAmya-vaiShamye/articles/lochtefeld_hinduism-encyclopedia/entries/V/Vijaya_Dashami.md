(“victory tenth”) Another name for the  
festival of **Dussehra**, which falls on the  
tenth **day** of the **lunar month**. The festival has two mythic charters, one with  
the god **Rama** and one with the  
**Goddess**, and both these myths point to  
this as the day on which the **deity** wins a  
definitive victory. See **Dussehra**.
