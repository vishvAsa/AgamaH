title = "Hindu Mahasabha"

+++
Hindu religious and political organization, formed at the 1915 **Kumbha Mela**,  
a gigantic religious festival. The Hindu  
Mahasabha was originally formed to  
help foster Hindu causes, such as a  
call for a complete ban on **cow**  
**slaughter**, promoting the use of the  
**Hindi** language in the **DevaNagari**  
script, and addressing the problem of  
**caste** discrimination.  
In the early 1920s, the movement  
became more overtly political and  
by the early 1930s espoused an  
unabashed Hindu nationalism, exemplified by its leader, **Vinayak Damodar**  
**Savarkar**. The dark underside of this  
Hindu nationalist crusade was a pronounced animus toward Muslims,  
which was only strengthened by the  
deteriorating relations between the  
two communities in the years preceding World War II.  
Although the Hindu Mahasabha was  
eager for official recognition by the ruling British government and sought to be  
recognized as the sole legitimate speaker for the Hindu community, these  
hopes were never realized. The British  
government included them in talks only  
after negotiations with the Indian  
National Congress Party had broken  
down, and cut relations with the  
Mahasabha after fences had been  
mended with the Congress.  
After independence in 1947, the  
282  
Hindi  
party’s image was damaged by its association with **Mohandas Gandhi’s** assassin, **Nathuram Godse**. It continued  
to field political candidates until the  
early 1960s, but never gained significant  
political power. For further information
