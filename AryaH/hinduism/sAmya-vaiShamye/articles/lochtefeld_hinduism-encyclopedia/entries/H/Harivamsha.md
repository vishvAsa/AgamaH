title = "Harivamsha"

+++
(“lineage of Hari”) A text traditionally  
considered to be an appendix to the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics. The *Harivamsha* is one of  
the important **puranas**, which describe  
the mythology of the Hindu **deities**, as  
well as many other facets of popular  
Hindu life.  
In particular, the *Harivamsha* is  
devoted to the mythology of the god  
**Krishna** (also known as Hari). It is especially important for the traditional stories connected with Krishna’s childhood  
in the **Braj** region, for which it is the earliest identifiable source. The episodes  
described in the *Harivamsha* are further  
developed in the **Bhagavata Purana**, a  
later work that is considered the most  
influential text for the cult of Krishna.
