title = "Hastinapur"

+++
Archeological site about sixty miles  
northeast of Delhi. This site has yielded  
pottery and other artifacts believed to  
be from the ninth to sixth centuries  
B.C.E., which would make them contemporary with the latest parts of the **Vedas**,  
the earliest Hindu religious texts. In the  
**Mahabharata**, the later of the two great  
Hindu epics, Hastinapur is the capital of  
277  
Hastinapur  
the **Kauravas**, a group of one hundred  
brothers who are the epicâ€™s antagonists.  
Although the name of the site and the  
place named in the epic matches, nothing has been found to provide a connection between these two.
