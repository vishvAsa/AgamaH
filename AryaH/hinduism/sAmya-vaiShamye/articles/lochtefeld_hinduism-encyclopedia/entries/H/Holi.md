title = "Holi"

+++
Major religious festival celebrated on the  
**full moon** in the **lunar month** of  
**Phalgun** (February–March), which in  
northern India comes very close to the  
end of the lunar **year**. Holi is essentially a  
festival of reversal and is celebrated with  
great enthusiasm throughout much of  
India. As the lunar year’s final major festival, the celebrations for Holi mirror the  
pattern of cosmic dissolution found in  
other units of time, whether the solar  
**day** or the basic unit of **cosmic time**, the  
**mahayuga**. In this pattern, the order in  
the cosmos steadily deteriorates until all  
order finally disappears, but after a certain time is suddenly, completely, and  
perfectly reformed.  
The festival of Holi is celebrated in  
two parts: a bonfire on the evening  
before Holi, and the “festival of colors”  
on the morning of Holi itself. Material for  
the bonfire is collected in the weeks  
before Holi and although the things put  
on this bonfire pile are supposed to be  
old and worn-out (with the symbolism of  
getting rid of the old), much newer  
things are often put on it as well, and this  
is a time in which people guard their  
**possessions** carefully.  
The days before Holi see the breakdown of various social taboos. In his *The*  
*Divine Hierarchy*, author Lawrence Babb  
reports the use of **obscenity** and bawdy  
discourse during this time, including  
stamping the word “penis” all over town  
using stamps carved from potatoes. As  
Holi gets closer, pranks such as pelting  
passersby with water balloons become  
more and more common. Such behavior  
is ultimately harmless, but is still completely unacceptable in ordinary times  
and symbolizes the coming cosmic dissolution. On the night of Holi, the bonfire is lit, symbolizing the destruction of  
the old, and people may direct obscenities toward the **fire** as a vehicle for getting rid of enmities from the previous  
year. Mythologically, the bonfire comes  
from the burning of the **demon Holika**,  
who tries to trick her brother **Prahlada**  
into being burned on a bonfire, but is  
herself consumed by the flames.  
The morning after the bonfire is the  
high point of Holi, the “festival of colors.”  
For weeks before Holi, the shops in the  
markets display mounds of powders in  
various colors, most commonly in vivid  
greens, reds, and purple; the colors are  
used as powder, or are mixed with water.  
People play with the colored water using  
syringes or balloons. In the gentlest type  
of play, each person takes a small pinch  
of colored powder and gently applies it  
to the other person’s forehead. Needless  
to say, the play with colors can often  
become much rougher, with people  
smearing and soaking each other with  
colors, dyeing each other’s clothing in  
multiple hues, and often staining the  
skin for weeks afterward.

The evening before the festival of Holi, men in Delhi arrange  
colored powders to prepare the site for a bonfire.  
This and all other Holi-related antics  
are always described as “play” (khel),  
and the operating assumption is that  
one cannot become angry with the people with whom one is playing, no matter  
how outrageous the behavior or how  
pointed the insults. The festival of Holi is  
the one day in the year when the boundaries of the usual social hierarchy are  
completely disregarded, along with the  
taboos on physical touching that are primarily based on the inherent concern for  
ritual **purity**. Another characteristic of  
Holi is that it is one of the few occasions  
when socially respectable people consume **bhang**, an intoxicating preparation made from ground-up marijuana.  
The morning passes in a welter of  
noise, confusion, and color, with (at  
street level) absolutely no rules, symbolizing the chaos of cosmic dissolution. Yet  
in the afternoon, cosmic (and social)  
order are suddenly restored. People take  
baths, change into new clothes, and go  
out visiting without fear of being colored, and any person bold enough to  
pelt someone with dyes at this time is  
subject to severe disapproval.  
In recent times, particularly in the  
larger cities, the license associated with  
Holi has been taken as an opportunity  
for all sorts of antisocial behavior: public  
drunkenness, molesting **women**, destroying property, and the chance to settle old  
grudges by physically harming people.  
The chaos is so intense that in larger  
cities many people stay in their houses  
on Holi, “playing” with members of their  
immediate family in the gentler spirit  
that is characterized as “true” Holi.  
Given the threat to public order, the  
government has taken some action, but  
the very nature of the holiday makes it  
difficult to regulate—since it is a festival  
of reversal, the government is one more  
force to be disregarded on that morning.  
Various government agencies have also  
tried to discourage the practice of making bonfires, although here the concern  
stems from worries about deforestation  
rather than the breakdown of social  
order. For further information see
