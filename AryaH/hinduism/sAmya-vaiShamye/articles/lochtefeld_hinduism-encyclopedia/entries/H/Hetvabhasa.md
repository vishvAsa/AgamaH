This is the term for a fallacious argument.  
For a valid inference (**anumana**), certain  
conditions must be met, or the inference  
will be invalid. The accepted form for an  
inference has three central terms: the first  
is a hypothesis (**pratijna**), which contains  
a subject class (**paksha**) and a thing to be  
proved (**sadhya**); the second is a reason  
(**hetu**) giving evidence for the hypothesis;  
and last come examples (**drshtanta**),  
which give further evidence for the  
hypothesis. In the stock example, the  
hypothesis that “there is **fire** on this  
mountain” is making a certain claim  
(sadhya)—namely, that there is fire—  
about a certain class of things (paksha)—  
namely, this mountain. The inference’s  
second part gives the reason (hetu)  
“because there is smoke on this mountain,” which also makes a claim about the  
subject class—namely, this mountain.  
One condition necessary for a valid  
inference is for the subject class to  
fall within the reason given, so that in  
all cases the reason would apply to it.  
The statement “there is fire on this  
mountain because there is smoke on  
that mountain” is an example where  
the subject class and the reason given  
are clearly separate.  
Yet the most important condition for a  
valid inference is that the reason given  
must account for every case of the thing  
to be proved, such that it cannot be  
explained in any other way. This is known  
as pervasion (**vyapti**) and is a critical test  
for the hetu. For the Indian logicians,  
claiming that smoke implied the presence  
of fire was a valid inference, since smoke  
was always produced by fire.  
On the other hand, the claim that fire  
implied the presence of smoke was  
invalid. This was because the logicians  
could name a case in which fire was not  
invariably accompanied by smoke, and  
thus failing this requirement of “pervasion”—the case of the red-hot iron ball,  
which was considered fiery, but not  
smoky. This counterexample is known as  
an **upadhi** (“obstruction”). It gives an  
example when one thing does not  
inevitably bring another, and thus shows  
that the hetu fails to pervade the sadhya,  
since there is a class of fiery things that do  
not smoke. For further information see
