(“The Deeds of **Harsha**”) A drama written by the playwright **Bana** (7th c.),  
which chronicles the emperor Harsha’s  
rise to power. Bana was a member of  
Harsha’s court, and thus a contemporary; his tale contains some evident  
exaggeration, but also a great deal of  
276  
Harivamsh  
historical detail. Bana was a careful  
observer, and the detailed descriptions  
in the *Harshacharita* give significant  
information about courtly and everyday  
life in his times.
