The practice of human sacrifice was  
uncommon in the history of Hindu  
religious life, but not unknown. One of  
the common mythic motifs in the **worship** of certain fierce and powerful  
**deities** is for devotees (**bhakta**) to offer  
their own heads to the **Goddess** as the  
ultimate sacrifice and act of devotion,  
but experts are uncertain how frequently this rite was performed. One  
mythic example of this is the **demon**king **Ravana**, who cuts off nine of his  
ten heads before the god **Shiva** grants  
him **divine power**. The resolve to commit this action is also attributed to the  
Bengali saint **Ramakrishna**, although  
the goddess **Kali** intervened before he  
could carry it out.  
The one place where human sacrifice was undoubtedly a regular practice was at the temple of the goddess  
**Kamakhya** in **Assam**. This temple is  
one of the **Shakti Pithas**, a network of  
sites sacred to the Goddess that  
spreads throughout the subcontinent.  
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where  
a body part of the dismembered goddess **Sati** fell to **earth**, taking form  
there as a different goddess. In this  
case, the body part was Satiâ€™s vulva,  
and the presence of such a highly  
charged part of the female body made  
Kamakhya a very powerful goddess.  
When the new temple was dedicated in 1565, she was reportedly offered  
the heads of 140 men, and this practice continued until the British halted  
it in 1832. The men offered as human  
sacrifices were reportedly volunteers,  
who believed that they had been  
called by her to do this; in the time  
between announcing their intention  
290  
Hrshikesha  
to be sacrificed and their deaths they  
were treated as virtual divinities, since  
they were considered to have been  
consecrated to the goddess. For further information see E. A. Gait, *A*
