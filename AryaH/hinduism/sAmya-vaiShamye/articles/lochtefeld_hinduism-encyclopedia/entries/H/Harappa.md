title = "Harappa"

+++
Ancient city and archeological site on  
the Ravi River in Pakistan, about one  
hundred miles southwest of the modern  
city of Lahore. Harappa is one of the  
cities of the **Indus Valley civilization**, a  
highly developed urban culture that  
flourished in the Indus Valley region  
between the fourth and third millennia  
B.C.E. Harappa and **Mohenjo-Daro** have  
been the most extensively excavated of  
these cities, although archeological  
work is proceeding in some of the others, and the similarities between these  
different cities have revealed a great deal  
about this civilizationâ€™s material culture.
