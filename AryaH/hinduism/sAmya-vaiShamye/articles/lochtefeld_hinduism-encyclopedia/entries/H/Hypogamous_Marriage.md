title = "Hypogamous Marriage"

+++
A marriage in which the wife comes  
from a group with higher social status  
than the husband. Such marriages were  
strictly forbidden in the **dharma literature**, and this prohibition illustrates the  
role of **women** in determining a group’s  
social status.

Hypogamous Marriage  
It is deemed acceptable for women  
to marry people of higher social status  
(**hypergamous marriage**), because it is  
believed that they are improving the status of their group by becoming associated with a higher status group. Marriage  
to a man of lower status was strictly forbidden, since the exchange of women  
implies some sort of equality between  
the two groups, and thus drags the community’s status down. In the dharma literature, hypogamous marriage was  
known as pratiloma, “against the **hair**”  
(i.e., in an unnatural direction). For further information see Jadunath Sarkar, *A*  
*History of the Dasanami Naga Sanyasis*,  
\1958.
