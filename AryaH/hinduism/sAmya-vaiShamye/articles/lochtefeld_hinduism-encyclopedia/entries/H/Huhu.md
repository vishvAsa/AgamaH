title = "Huhu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Huhu is a particular **gandharva**, or celestial musician.  
He has the misfortune to displease a  
Hindu sage, when his amorous **water**  
play with some celestial damsels  
breaks the sageâ€™s meditation. The sage  
curses Huhu to become a giant crocodile, and he remains in this state for  
many years. The crocodile preys on the  
creatures in the lake, and one day  
seizes the leg of a giant **elephant**. This  
elephant is really King **Indradyumna**,  
who has also assumed this form as the  
result of a **curse**. The elephant and the  
crocodile struggle for one thousand  
years, so evenly matched that neither  
can best the other. Huhu is finally  
released from his curse when the god  
**Vishnu** himself comes down from  
**heaven** and kills him. See also  
**Gajendramoksha**.
