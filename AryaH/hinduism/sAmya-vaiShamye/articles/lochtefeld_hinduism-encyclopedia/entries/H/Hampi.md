Deserted city in central **Karnataka**,  
about 170 miles northwest of the state’s  
capital, Bangalore. Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire (1336–1565  
C.E.), which at its peak in the early sixteenth century controlled most of the  
Indian peninsula south of the **Narmada**  
**River**. The empire’s wealth primarily  
stemmed from its control of the spice  
and cotton trade—both highly valuable  
commodities at the time—and the  
city of Hampi was built on a scale to  
reflect its importance. The empire came  
to an abrupt end after the battle of  
**Talikota** in 1565, when the last  
Vijayanagar king, Rama Raja, was  
defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultans from further north in the **Deccan**.  
The city was sacked by the invading  
sultans, and has been deserted ever  
since. See also **Vijayanagar dynasty**.
