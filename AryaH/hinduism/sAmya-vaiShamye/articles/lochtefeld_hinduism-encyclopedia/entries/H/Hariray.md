title = "Hariray"

+++
(mid-17th c.) A noted disciple of  
**Gokulnath** (1551–1640 C.E.), the third  
**guru** of the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community founded by his grandfather  
**Vallabhacharya**.  
Aside from being a disciple, Hariray  
is considered Gokulnath’s scribe. He is  
the commentator on a text called the  
**Chaurasi Vaishnavan ki Varta**  
(“Account of eighty-four Vaishnavas”),  
and probably compiled the text itself  
under Gokulnath’s direction. This text  
describes the lives of eighty-four  
**Vaishnavas**, or devotees (**bhakta**), of the  
god **Vishnu**, all associates and disciples  
of Gokulnath’s father **Vitthalnath** or his  
grandfather Vallabhacharya. The text’s  
real purpose is not to provide biographies of these figures, but to illustrate  
the importance of the Pushti Marg and  
its leaders. Besides the *Chaurasi*  
*Vaishnavan ki Varta*, a number of poems  
are also attributed to Hariray, but these  
may be the work of a later figure.
