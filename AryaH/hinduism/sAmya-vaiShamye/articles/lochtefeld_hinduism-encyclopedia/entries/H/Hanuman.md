Monkey-headed Hindu god. Hanuman  
originally appears in the **Ramayana,** the  
earlier of the two great Indian epics,  
where he is described as a minister  
of the monkey king **Sugriva** and a  
devoted servant of **Rama**, the god-king  
who is the epic’s protagonist. Despite  
Hanuman’s seemingly minor place in  
the Hindu pantheon, he is an enormously popular **deity** in modern India,  
because he gives humans a god essentially like themselves (or as they would  
like to be) but on a greater scale and  
with greater capacity.  
Hanuman is said to have been born  
of a union between the **wind**-god, **Vayu**,  
and the nymph **Anjana**. After his **birth**  
the infant Hanuman is continually hungry, and one day he attempts to eat the  
**sun**. **Indra**, the king of the gods and  
ruler of **heaven**, is incensed at Hanuman’s  
action, and strikes the infant with a  
thunderbolt, breaking his jaw (hanu).  
Vayu becomes very angry upon learning  
of his **son’s** injury and ceases to perform  
his usual activities. Since in Indian physiology winds are responsible for all internal functions—including digestion,  
respiration, and elimination—Vayu’s  
strike means that no one can live a normal life. After a short time the gods realize their predicament and beg Vayu for  
forgiveness; he is placated when each of  
the gods promises to give Hanuman a  
divine gift.  
By virtue of these divine gifts,  
Hanuman gains great powers. He is  
immensely strong, and his image portrays him with bulging muscles. He is  
also skilled as a healer, both through his  
skill with herbs and natural medicines,  
and his magical abilities to protect people from evil supernatural beings.  
Among his most unusual divine gifts are  
the power to live as long as he likes and  
to choose the time of his death.  
His greatest virtue, and many would  
say the real source of his power, is his  
devotion (**bhakti**) to Rama. In the  
*Ramayana*, Hanuman plays a pivotal  
role in advancing the story. Hanuman is  
sent out with a troop of other monkeys  
to search for **Sita**, Rama’s kidnapped  
wife, and after a long and arduous  
search finally finds her imprisoned in  
the kingdom of **Lanka**.

Hanuman  
Image of Hanuman, a monkey-headed god who is  
a devoted servant of the god Rama. He plays a  
pivotal role in the Hindu epic the *Ramayana*.  
Hanuman plays an even greater role  
in the **Ramcharitmanas** (a vernacular  
version of the *Ramayana* written by  
**Tulsidas**), in which he is transformed  
from a powerful monkey servant to the  
devotee (**bhakta**), whose only aim is to  
serve Rama with loving devotion. This  
devotion precludes any type of worldly  
attachment, including marriage and  
family, and Hanuman remains a model  
for a religious lifestyle stressing celibate  
**asceticism**. In Indian culture, **celibacy** is  
perceived as a source of power, since it  
prevents the loss of a man’s vital forces  
that takes place with ejaculation.  
Yet for Hanuman’s devotees, his  
greatest virtue is not his strength, but his  
ability to act as an intermediary to  
Rama, who is usually perceived as far  
more remote from human affairs.  
Because Hanuman is also a devotee,  
people feel an affinity and kinship with  
him, even though his powers are far  
greater than theirs. In fact, they believe  
that messages conveyed by Hanuman  
have a better chance of reaching Rama’s  
presence and getting action. In a text  
aptly named the “Letter of Petition”  
(**Vinaya Patrika**), the poet-saint  
Tulsidas appoints Hanuman as his messenger, in the full confidence that his  
plea will be heard in the divine court.  
Hanuman’s intimate access to **divine**  
**power**, his own undeniable strengths,  
and his perceived accessibility and sympathy have all combined to make him  
one of the most widely worshiped  
deities in India, and one who crosses  
sectarian boundaries.  
Because of his service to Rama, he  
is usually counted as a **Vaishnava** or  
devotee of the **Vishnu**. Yet in an  
interesting twist, Hanuman is also  
considered to be an **avatar** or ”incarnation” of the god **Shiva**, and is thus  
revered by the **Shaivites**, Shiva’s  
devotees. As a protective deity,  
Hanuman is often worshiped on  
astrologically inauspicious days, to  
keep these inauspicious forces at  
bay. His prodigious strength, celibate  
lifestyle, and single-minded devotion  
have made him the patron deity  
of Indian wrestlers, who strive to imitate  
him as they train.  
Finally, he plays an important role as  
a healer and sustainer. On one hand, he  
is famous as an exorcist, helping people  
get rid of evil spirits. On the other, he  
preserves life for those who know his  
special **mantra**, which gives them the  
power—as he had—to choose their time  
of death. Given his importance in modern Hindu life, Hanuman is only now  
receiving the attention he deserves. For
