title = "Hala"

+++
(“plow”) In Hindu iconography, the  
branch of study concerned with the representation of various figures, the hala is  
an ordinary Indian plow, which represents farming; it is also considered a  
weapon. The hala is most often associated  
with the **avatars** of the god **Vishnu**, but  
the only figure who always bears it is  
**Krishna’s** brother **Balarama**, for whom  
one of the epithets is **Haladhara** (“bearing a plow”).
