(“bearing a plow”) Epithet of **Balarama**,  
elder brother to the god **Krishna**.  
Balarama was given this name because  
of his strong associations with farmers  
and farming, and also because he  
occasionally used the plow itself as  
a weapon.  
On one occasion he is said to have  
menaced the **Yamuna River** with his  
plow when he was displeased with the  
course she was taking. This threat to dig  
a new channel for her induced the  
Yamuna her to change her course to one  
with which Balarama was happier.
