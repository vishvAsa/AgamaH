One of the more extreme vows performed by devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Skanda** during the annual pilgrimage at  
**Kataragama**, in the southern part of the  
island of **Sri Lanka**. This vow is performed in return for finding healing  
from physical ailments or deliverance  
from distress. Those keeping this vow  
inserted hooks into their back and thigh  
muscles; ropes are attached to these  
hooks, and the devotees are suspended  
over the heads of passersby.  
These ardent devotees are reportedly  
rewarded for their suffering with a state  
of ecstasy in which they feel no pain and  
suffer no bleeding. In this state, they are  
also believed to be mouthpieces for the  
god Skanda, and other pilgrims seek  
their advice for every conceivable kind  
of problem. For further information see
