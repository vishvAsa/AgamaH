title = "Hinglaj"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) located on the  
coast of the Arabian Sea in the  
Baluchistan Province of modern  
Pakistan. Hinglaj is one of the **Shakti**  
**Pithas**, a network of sites located  
throughout the subcontinent that are  
sacred to the **goddess Sati**. Each Shakti  
Pitha marks the site where a body part  
of the dismembered goddess fell to  
earth, and then took form as a different goddess; in the case of Hinglaj, the  
body part was the crown of Sati’s head.  
Hinglaj is the furthest west of all the  
Shakti Pithas, and thus represents the  
furthest boundaries of the traditional  
Hindu cultural area.  
The presiding goddess at Hinglaj  
is known by various names, the most  
common being Hinglaj Devi. She is  
considered an extremely powerful  
goddess—partly because of her  
dangerous location on the periphery of  
India, but also because the crown of the  
head (**brahmarandhra**) is considered  
the highest and most powerful part of  
the **subtle body**.  
The subtle body is an alternate physiological system believed to reside on a  
different plane of existence than the  
actual body, but with certain correspondences to the actual body. It is visualized  
as a set of six psychic centers (**chakras**)  
running roughly along the course of the  
spine. Above and below these centers  
are found the two divine principles,  
**Shiva** (awareness) and **Shakti** (power)—  
the latter at the base of the spine, and  
former in the crown of the head.  
Because of Hinglaj’s association with  
mastery of the subtle body, a visit to her  
shrine was considered essential for anyone striving for perfection in **yoga**. By  
283  
Hinglaj  
the 1800s the area around her shrine  
had become completely dominated by  
Muslims and thus well outside the  
Hindu culture area. To travel outside of  
this area is to risk loss of one’s Hindu  
identity. To counter the danger of traveling outside this area, it became traditional for **ascetics** who had gone there  
on pilgrimage to be branded with her  
symbol on their return to India, as a way  
to purify them and remake them as  
Hindus. The political tensions between  
India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947 have made it almost  
impossible for Hindu pilgrims to visit  
the shrine. For further information see
