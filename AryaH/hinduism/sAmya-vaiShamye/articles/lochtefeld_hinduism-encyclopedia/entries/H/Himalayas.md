Himalayas  
Panorama of the Himalayas in Nepal. Hindus consider the Himalaya mountains  
sacred since they are believed to be home to the gods.  
In a Hindu religious context, the  
Himalayan regions in the first three  
states are the most significant; the  
mountains in these three contiguous  
states are all part of an extended  
Himalayan cultural region, fronted by  
the **Shiwalik Hills**. They are considered sacred, both as the literal abode  
of the Hindu gods (in particular **Shiva**,  
who is believed to live on Mount  
**Kailas**) and also as the source of  
sacred rivers such as the **Ganges**,  
**Yamuna**, and **Indus**. These high  
mountains are also a traditional home  
for Hindu ascetics wishing to  
renounce the everyday world and  
search for personal spiritual realization; the physical hardships these  
**ascetics** must endure in the mountains are also believed to generate  
spiritual power.  
Given their religious importance,  
the Himalayas are full of sacred  
sites (**tirthas**); among the most important are **Amarnath**, **Yamunotri**,  
**Gangotri**, **Kedarnath**, **Badrinath**, and  
**Nanda Devi**.
