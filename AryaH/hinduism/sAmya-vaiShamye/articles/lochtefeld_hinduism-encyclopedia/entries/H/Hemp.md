Colloquial name for *Cannibus indica*,  
more commonly known as marijuana.  
In earlier times the plant’s long fibers  
were used in the manufacture of rope  
and cloth. In contemporary times it is  
mainly used for its narcotic properties,  
either by crushing and processing the  
leaves to make **bhang** or by collecting  
the plant’s resins as hashish (**charas**).

The use of hemp as a narcotic is illegal,  
except for specific places and times,  
including certain pilgrimage sites and  
festivals. However, many ascetics  
continue to smoke hashish regularly.
