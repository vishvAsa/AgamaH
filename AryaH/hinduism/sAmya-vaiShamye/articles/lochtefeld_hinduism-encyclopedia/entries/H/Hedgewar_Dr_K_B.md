title = "Hedgewar, Dr K B"

+++
(1889–1940) Founder and first  
supreme leader (sarsanghchalak) of  
the **Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh**  
(RSS), which he formed in the central  
Indian city of **Nagpur** in 1925. The RSS  
is a conservative Hindu organization  
formed for the express purpose of  
providing leadership for a revitalized  
Hindu India; for most of its history it  
has characterized its mission as cultural, rather than religious or political.

The character of Dr. Hedgewar and  
the RSS are inextricably linked to the turbulent years immediately after World  
War I, and the profound dislocation in  
Indian society that came with the struggle for independence. In his youth,  
Hedgewar had been involved in the  
independence movement, and for some  
time even supported **Mohandas**  
**Gandhi’s** Congress Party. But by the  
early 1920s, he had become disillusioned with Gandhi’s methods. He had  
also been deeply influenced by the  
Hindu nationalist **Vinayak Damodar**  
**Savarkar**, whose central thesis was that  
the Hindus were a nation, despite their  
profound regional, social, linguistic, and  
religious differences.  
On the festival of Vijaya Dashami  
(**Dussehra**) in 1925, Hedgewar formed  
the RSS to help create this Hindu nation  
by unifying Hindus previously separated  
by divisions of **caste** and class. This date  
is highly significant, since according to  
popular Hindu belief any endeavor  
begun on Vijaya Dashami will invariably  
succeed. Hedgewar led the RSS until his  
death, fifteen years after the organization was founded.  
Aside from training a leadership  
corps, the RSS was also formed to protect  
Hindu interests. On one level, it endeavored to do this by developing more  
assertive, tough members, and by training them to use traditional weapons  
such as the wooden staff. On quite  
another level, the RSS has a long history  
of charitable work with refugees and victims of natural disasters, and one of its  
missions is service to the Hindu community.  
In either case the RSS has often been  
perceived as anti-Muslim—until 1977,  
non-Hindus were barred from being  
members—and many of its members  
view the Muslim community as aliens in  
India, if not actual enemies. Throughout  
his life, Hedgewar kept the RSS strictly  
aloof from politics, and his insistence  
that it was a cultural and characterbuilding organization helped keep it  
from being banned by the British. Under  
its banner as a cultural organization, the  
RSS spread from the state of  
**Maharashtra** to other parts of India,  
aided in part by deteriorating HinduMuslim relations in the years prior to  
independence in 1947. For further
