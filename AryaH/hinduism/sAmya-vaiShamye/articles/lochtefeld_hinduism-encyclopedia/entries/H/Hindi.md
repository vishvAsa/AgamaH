Modern Indian language classified as a  
member of the Indo-European language family; Hindi is the “official”  
language of the Republic of India.  
Hindi is spoken throughout most of  
northern and central India as a second  
or “link” language and as a “mother”  
tongue in much of the states of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh** and **Madhya Pradesh**. It is  
also one of the broadcast languages  
for the television and radio networks  
run by the Indian government and by  
virtue of these mediums can be found  
throughout the nation.  
As with many of India’s regional  
languages, Hindi has a long history as  
a literary language, particularly in an  
earlier version known as **Braj Bhasha**,  
which was the dominant language in  
which northern Indian devotional  
(**bhakti**) poetry was written. The slow  
demise of **Sanskrit** in contemporary  
times has helped make Hindi an  
important language for fiction,  
learned scholarship, and writing on  
Indian culture.  
In modern India, speaking a certain  
language often carries political implications, since an important factor in  
preserving regional identities has been  
the stress on maintaining one’s regional language. For this reason, many people are not about to let Hindi replace  
their regional languages. This sentiment is particularly marked in southern India, where the imposition of the  
Hindi language is decried as a new  
form of imperialism.
