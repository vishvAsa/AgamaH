title = "Hundi"

+++
In earlier times, the name for a letter  
of credit issued from a mercantile  
house. By the early 1800s, these letters  
functioned as a virtual currency, since  
in some cases they would pass  
through twenty or thirty transactions  
before being returned for payment.  
Hundis are significant because they  
allowed families to transact business  
over large areas without having to  
actually carry large sums of money  
with them and thus helped to foster  
long distance trade.  
In modern times, this is also the  
most common term for a temple  
collection box, where visitors deposit  
their **offerings**.
