title = "Haryana"

+++
Modern Indian state that surrounds  
Delhi, the nation’s capital, in every  
direction but the east. Haryana is one of  
the so-called linguistic states formed  
after Indian independence, to unite  
people with a common language and  
culture (in this case, **Hindi**) under one  
state government. Haryana was created  
in 1966, from the Hindi-speaking  
regions of the former **Punjab** state. It  
has traditionally been an important  
agricultural region, since the land is fertile and productive, but more recently it  
has also benefited from the attempt to  
create “satellite cities” around Delhi, in  
order to spread out the development in  
the capital region. These efforts have  
greatly raised the land values in the  
areas closest to the capital. Aside from  
this localized land boom, Haryana is a  
largely rural state.  
Haryana’s major religious sites,  
which are right next to one another, are  
**Kurukshetra** and **Thanesar**. The former  
is cited as the battleground for the war  
described in the epic **Mahabharata**; the  
latter is named as the place that the god  
**Shiva** was worshiped by the **Pandavas**,  
the *Mahabharata*’s protagonists.  
From a true historical perspective,  
the level plains around the town of  
Panipat have seen three decisive battles  
that influenced the course of Indian history. In 1526, Babar, a central Asian  
monarch who had been displaced from  
his own homeland in Afghanistan,  
crushed the Lodis to end the Lodi  
dynasty and establish his own **Moghul**  
**dynasty**. In 1556 Babar’s grandson  
**Akbar** decimated the Sur dynasty, which  
had temporarily occupied the Moghul  
capitals at Delhi and Agra, and thus  
reestablished Moghul rule. In 1761 an  
invading Afghan army defeated the  
**Marathas**, ending the period of Maratha  
territorial expansion. For more information, an accessible reference is Christine
