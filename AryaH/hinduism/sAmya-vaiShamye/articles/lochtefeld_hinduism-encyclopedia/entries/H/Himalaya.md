A minor **deity** who is the personified  
form of the Himalaya Mountains.  
Although the Himalaya Mountains are  
one of the defining features of the Indian  
subcontinent, the deity Himalaya has a  
very insignificant place in Indian  
mythology. His most important role is as  
the father of the **goddess Parvati**, who  
when she reaches maturity is married to  
the great god **Shiva**. Himalaya is  
described as exceedingly wealthy,  
because of the mineral riches that the  
mountains contain. See also **Himalayas**.
