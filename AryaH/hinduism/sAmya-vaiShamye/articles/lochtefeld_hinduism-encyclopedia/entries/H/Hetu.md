(“reason”) In Indian **philosophy**, this is  
an important part of formulating an  
inference (**anumana**). In this context,  
the word has two differing meanings,  
one general, the other more obscure.  
The accepted form for an inference has  
three terms: a hypothesis (**pratijna**), a reason (hetu), and examples (**drshtanta**);  
each of these three have their own constituent parts. In its most general sense, the  
word *hetu* refers to the reason or evidence  
that supports the assertion in the initial  
hypothesis. For example, the hypothesis  
that a mountain is on **fire** would be supported by the reason that there is smoke on  
the mountain.  
In a narrower sense, hetu can also  
refer to the part of a reason that proves  
the hypothesis. For example, if one  
proves the statement “the mountain is  
on fire” with the reason “the mountain  
has smoke,” the part of the reason that  
indicates that there is smoke is the hetu.
