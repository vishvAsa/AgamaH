title = "Holika"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the wicked sister of  
the **demon**-king **Hiranyakashipu**.  
Holika helps Hiranyakashipu try to  
kill his son **Prahlada**, who is a  
steadfast devotee (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Vishnu**. Because of a **divine power**, she  
cannot be harmed by **fire**. She tricks  
Prahlada into sitting on her lap in a  
bonfire, expecting that she will be  
unharmed and he will die. Fortunately  
Vishnu transfers her power from  
Holika to Prahlada, and she is  
consumed by the fire, while he remains  
completely unscathed.  
The myth of the burning of Holika is  
the model for the bonfires for the festival of **Holi**. On a mythic level, the bonfire symbolizes the triumph of good over  
evil; on another level, since the materials in the fire are supposed to be old and  
broken things, the bonfire symbolizes  
getting rid of oneâ€™s baggage from the  
previous **year**, and starting anew.
