title = "Holkar, Ahalya Bai"

+++
(r. 1761â€“1795) Hindu queen in the  
Holkar dynasty. The family ruled one  
of the successor states resulting from  
the breakup of the **Maratha** empire,  
whose capital was in the central Indian  
city of Indore.  
She came to power at a time when  
the influence of the **Moghul dynasty**  
had been greatly reduced and moved to  
fill the political vacuum that this created.  
During her long reign she managed to  
wield genuine political power over  
much of north-central India. She also  
served as a highly visible royal patron at  
several Hindu pilgrimage sites, including **Benares**, where she funded the  
reconstruction of the **Vishvanath** temple, and **Haridwar**, where she is said to  
have paid for the construction of a **ghat**,  
which is a structure that leads to a  
sacred bathing (**snana**) area. For further
