title = "Hygiene"

+++
Orthoprax Hindus (that is, Hindus who  
stress correct religious practice) lay  
great stress on cleanliness of their bodies and their immediate environment.  
Although to the outside eye this scrupulous attention would seem to indicate a  
concern for hygiene, these actions are  
performed primarily to protect and  
retain religious **purity**.  
In many cases, concerns for hygiene  
and purity overlap, as in the pervasive  
practice of bathing (**snana**) and the  
regulations concerning bodily cleanliness. Both of these simultaneously  
remove dirt and impurity (**ashaucha**),  
but in other cases these concerns  
clearly diverge.  
One example of this divergence is  
the way that household refuse is often  
simply put out in the streetâ€”a practice that keeps the home pure and  
clean, but which fosters unhygienic  
conditions directly outside the home.  
Another example of this disjunction  
can be seen in the traditional use of  
**cow dung** as a purifying substance, or  
the way that the **Ganges** River is  
always considered pure, even in its  
lower reaches where it is full of sewage  
and industrial effluents. These examples clearly show that purity and  
hygiene are very different concepts  
and that, from a religious perspective,  
purity is by far the more important of  
the two.
