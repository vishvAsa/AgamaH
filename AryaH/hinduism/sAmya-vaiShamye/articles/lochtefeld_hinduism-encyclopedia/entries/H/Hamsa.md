The name for the Barheaded Goose  
(*Anser indicus*), a bird with several  
important symbolic associations; the  
most significant is **purity** and transcendence, since the bird’s color is largely  
white. It flies at very high altitudes,  
and it is reputed to nest in Lake  
**Manasarovar** in the high **Himalayas**,  
the region believed to be the land of  
the gods. Since it is popularly believed to  
be able to separate milk and **water**—

Hampi  
Ruins of the city of Hampi. These structures were once a part  
of the capital of the powerful Vijayanagar empire.  
drinking for former, and discarding the  
latter—the hamsa is also a symbol for  
a discriminating person, who is able  
to take counsel from many different  
people, and to separate the good from  
the bad.  
Perhaps because of these associations, the hamsa is also the name for a  
particular type of Hindu **ascetic**. The  
Hamsa ascetics were described as peripatetic—they were directed to stay no  
more than one night in a village or five  
nights in a town. They were also directed  
to perform different sorts of ascetic  
practices, such as subsisting on **cow’s**  
urine or dung, fasting (**upavasa**) for a  
month at a time, or observing the **chandrayana** rite, a fast in which one  
increases and decreases one’s food consumption according to the waxing and  
waning of the **moon**.
