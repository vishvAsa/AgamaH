title = "Hiranyakashipu"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu  
is a **demon** king who is killed by the  
god **Vishnu**, in his **avatar** or incarnation as a **Man-Lion**. As a result of his  
harsh physical **asceticism**, Hiranyakashipu  
gains a series of **divine powers**, which  
render him virtually invulnerable:  
notable of these powers is that he  
cannot be killed by man or beast, by  
day or by night, and neither inside  
nor outdoors.  
Protected by these powers,  
Hiranyakashipu first conquers the  
entire **earth** and then drives the gods  
from **heaven**, growing prouder and  
more oppressive as his power increases. He particularly oppresses his **son**  
**Prahlada**, who despite his father’s  
power remains a sincere devotee  
(**bhakta**) of Vishnu. Incensed at the  
thought that someone refuses to **worship** him, Hiranyakashipu finally gives  
Prahlada the ultimatum to worship  
him or die.  
Prahlada calls on Vishnu for help,  
and Vishnu appears in the form of a  
Man-Lion—a man from the torso down,  
with the head and shoulders of a lion—  
which is neither man nor beast. The  
Man-Lion seizes Hiranyakashipu in the  
palace doorway, which is neither  
inside nor out, at twilight, which is neither day nor night, and uses his sharp  
claws to tear out the demon’s entrails,  
killing him. The story of Hiranyakashipu  
is meant to illustrate the danger of  
pride, and the mythic reality that no  
power, however powerful, can keep  
one from the consequences of one’s  
evil deeds.
