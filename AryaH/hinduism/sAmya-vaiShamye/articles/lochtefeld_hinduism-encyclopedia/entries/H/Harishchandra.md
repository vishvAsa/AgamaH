title = "Harishchandra"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a king who is  
famous for his truthfulness and integrity.  
In modern Hindu culture, he has  
become the symbol for someone who  
patiently endures undeserved suffering.  
Harishchandra’s suffering is a result  
of the long-standing feud between the  
sages **Vasishtha**—his family priest—and  
**Vishvamitra**. When Vasishtha praises  
the virtue of Harishchandra, Vishvamitra  
becomes determined to prove him  
wrong. Disguised as an old **brahmin**,  
Vishvamitra conjures up an imaginary  
**son** using his magical powers and gets  
Harishchandra to promise that he will  
give whatever is necessary for the  
boy’s wedding.  
When the time comes to redeem  
this promise, Vishvamitra demands  
Harishchandra’s kingdom. Vishvamitra  
expects that the king will balk at this  
demand, but Harishchandra immediately fulfills it. Vishvamitra then  
remarks that when giving a gift to a  
brahmin it is customary to give a gift of  
money (**dakshina**) and demands a  
large sum. To raise this amount,  
Harishchandra first sells his wife  
(**Chandramati**) and son into slavery  
and finally sells himself to an outcast,  
who puts him to work burning bodies  
at the **cremation ground**.  
After enduring these miseries for  
some time, Harishchandra’s son is  
bitten by a snake and dies. When  
Chandramati brings the body to be  
burned, he does not recognize her. He  
refuses to cremate the boy until the  
cremation fee is paid, since this will  
275  
Harishchandra  
cheat his master of his rightful income.  
Chandramati has no money for the  
fee, and after listening to her lamentations Harishchandra recognizes her  
and becomes doubly miserable. The  
couple finally decides that **suicide** is  
their only escape from their misery  
and make a pyre on which to burn  
themselves. When Harishchandra is  
about to light the pyre, the gods  
appear before them, praising his righteousness and his commitment to his  
word, and Harishchandra’s outcast  
master is revealed as **dharma** (“righteousness”) incarnate. Harishchandra’s  
son is restored to life, his kingdom is  
restored back to him, and everyone  
lives happily ever after.
