title = "Hotr"

+++
Type of priest mentioned in the  
**Brahmana** literature, one of the later  
strands in the sacred literature known as  
the **Vedas**. The Brahmanas largely functioned as manuals describing how to  
perform sacrificial ritesâ€”which primarily involved burning **offerings** in a  
sacred **fire**. These rites were so complex  
that they required specialized ritual  
technicians: the hotr, the **adhvaryum**,  
the **udgatr**, and **brahman**. Of these, the  
hotr was the sacrificial priest who recited  
the verses from the **Rg Veda** that were  
used in the **sacrifice**.
