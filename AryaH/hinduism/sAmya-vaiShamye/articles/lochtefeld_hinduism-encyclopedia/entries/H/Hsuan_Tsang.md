title = "Hsuan Tsang"

+++
(605–664) Chinese Buddhist scholar and  
translator, whose account of his extended stay in India (629–645) provides one  
of the few reliable sources for Indian life  
in that period.  
Hsuan Tsang’s purpose in coming  
to India was to find reliable copies of  
the Buddhist scriptures, which had  
become severely garbled and corrupted during their transmission to China.  
He was a highly learned man and during his stay spent years studying in  
Buddhist educational institutions,  
particularly the Buddhist university at  
Nalanda. He traveled all over northern  
India and because of his piety and  
learning was honored by the kings he  
met, including the Emperor **Harsha**.
