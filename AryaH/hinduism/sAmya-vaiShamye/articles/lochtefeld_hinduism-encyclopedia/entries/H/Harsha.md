title = "Harsha"

+++
(r. 606–647) Ruler in the Pushyabhuti  
line, a dynasty whose capital was the  
city of **Kanyakubja** in eastern **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. Harsha is generally considered  
the greatest Pushyabhuti ruler; he controlled a large part of northern India and  
to some extent restored the glory of the  
**Gupta dynasty** (350–550).  
Historically, Harsha’s reign is welldocumented, in part by the Chinese pilgrim **Hsuan Tsang**, whose account gives  
invaluable information about Indian life  
at that time. Harsha was an able and  
energetic ruler who spent much of his  
later life evaluating the condition of his  
empire. He was also a cultured and literate man—he was the author of three  
**Sanskrit** plays—whose court was  
graced by significant literary figures,  
especially the playwright **Bana**. After  
his death, his kingdom quickly disintegrated when he died without an heir.
