According to traditional Hindu notions  
regarding **purity** and impurity (**ashaucha**),  
head and facial hair trap and retain ritual impurity. In ordinary cases this  
impurity is removed by simple washing  
in running **water**, just as for the rest of  
the body. In cases of particularly violent  
impurity, such as that connected with  
death (**maranashaucha**), men will often  
conclude the period of impurity by completely **shaving** both their heads and  
beards. They may also have their nails  
cut, probably reflecting that conviction  
that any dispensable parts of the body  
should be removed as a way to get rid of  
any residual impurity.  
Shaving the head is also the major  
feature in the **chudakarana**, the tonsure  
ceremony that marks the ritual conclusion of infancy to remove any residual  
impurities left from childbirth. Among  
adults such head shaving is usually  
restricted to men; **women** usually offer a  
token lock of hair as a symbol for the  
whole, although women may have  
their heads shaved to fulfill a religious  
vow. While shaving the head is fairly  
common, shaving the body hair is notâ€”  
the **Sanskrit** language has different  
words for these two types of hair, and  
they are considered to be different  
things entirely.
