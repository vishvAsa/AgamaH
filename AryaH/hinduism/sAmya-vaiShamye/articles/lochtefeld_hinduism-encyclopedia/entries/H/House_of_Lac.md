title = "House of Lac"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the two  
great Hindu epics, this is one of the  
stratagems through which the epic’s  
antagonist, **Duryodhana**, tries to kill the  
five **Pandava** brothers, who are his  
cousins and the epic’s protagonists.  
Duryodhana builds the Pandavas a  
magnificent palace, without telling  
them that it is constructed completely of  
lac, a highly flammable substance. After  
the Pandavas have settled into the  
palace, Duryodhana has his minions set  
it on **fire** in an effort to burn them alive.  
The Pandavas are saved by the sagacity  
of their uncle **Vidura**, who not only  
warns them of the danger, but has constructed an underground passage allowing them to escape from the house and a  
tunnel to convey them far away without  
being discovered. When the house is set  
afire, the Pandavas escape through the  
tunnel and for some time are safe from  
Duryodhana, since they are presumed  
to have died in the fire.
