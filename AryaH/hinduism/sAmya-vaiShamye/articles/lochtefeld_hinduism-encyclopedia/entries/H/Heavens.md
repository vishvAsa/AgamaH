title = "Heavens"

In Hinduism, there are believed to be  
many additional planes of existence  
besides the visible earthly realm. These  
other planes of existence include the  
heavens, which are realms of reward,  
pleasure, and enjoyment. Beings are  
born in heaven as a reward for their past  
good deeds, and the life of the gods living in these heavens is invariably  
described as long and pleasurable. Yet  
heaven is not permanent, and when  
one’s karmic merit is exhausted and  
one’s stay in heaven is done, one  
inevitably descends from heaven to take  
birth in a lower form.  
In general, heaven is viewed as a distraction to serious religious life. Birth in  
heaven comes only through accumulating and expending an enormous  
amount of religious merit generated by  
past good deeds, and thus is a tremendous drain on one’s accumulated spiritual resources. Furthermore, once one  
has been born in heaven, life is so easy  
and carefree that people generally feel  
no inclination to engage in religious life.  
For both reasons, life in heaven is considered a goal to which people should  
not aspire.
