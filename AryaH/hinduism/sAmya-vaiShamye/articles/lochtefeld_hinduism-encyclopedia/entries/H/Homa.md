title = "Homa"

+++
In its most specific meaning, homa  
refers to the “**sacrifice** to the gods”  
(**devayajna**), which is one of the Five  
Great Sacrifices (**panchamahayajna**)  
prescribed in the **dharma literature**, or  
texts on religious duty. Homa refers to  
the act of making **offerings** of clarified  
butter into a sacrificial **fire**, a rite that is  
directed toward satisfying the gods.  
Today, the word homa is often used with  
a far more general meaning, to refer to  
any religious rite in which offerings are  
placed in the sacred fire.
