title = "Hijra"

+++
Name for a class of male transvestites,  
most of whom have undergone self**castration** as a ritual renunciation of  
their sexuality. Hijras often serve as  
homosexual prostitutes, and they are an  
established feature of the decadent  
underside in most Indian cities. Their

Hero-Stones  
most important social function is to  
sing and **dance** at houses in which a  
male child has been born, although they  
may also be called to perform on other  
auspicious occasions.  
Their ritual role in connection with  
births shows a strong association with  
fertility, and at any function their presence is believed to confer health and  
prosperity on the sponsoring family, for  
which the hijras will demand appropriate compensation. At the same time, the  
life of the hijras seems fraught with contrary notions: Although they are ritually  
associated with fertility, they are themselves sterile, and their sexuality is nonprocreative. Though they are associated  
with **auspiciousness** and prosperity,  
they are a socially marginal group with  
very low social status. For the only reliable study to date, see Serena Nanda,  
*Neither Man Nor Woman*, 1999.
