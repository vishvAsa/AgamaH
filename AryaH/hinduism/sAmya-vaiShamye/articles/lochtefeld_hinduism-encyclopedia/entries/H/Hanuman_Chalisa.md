title = "Hanuman Chalisa"

+++
(“**Hanuman’s** forty”) Forty poetic stanzas  
in praise of the god Hanuman, written in  
**Hindi**. A signature line (**bhanita**) at the  
end of the text attributes it as written by  
the poet-saint **Tulsidas** (1532–1623),  
best known as the composer of the  
**Ramcharitmanas**, a vernacular version  
of the epic **Ramayana**.  
Short texts like the *Hanuman Chalisa*  
are often sung as a devotional act, or as  
an established part of **worship**, and in  
many cases people can recite the text by  
heart. The text is written in the **chaupai**  
**meter**, the predominant meter in the  
*Ramcharitmanas*.  
The text begins with a description of  
Hanuman’s physical features, then  
relates his devotion to **Rama** and  
his heroic deeds in the *Ramayana*. The  
closing verses reiterate Hanuman’s  
power, promise benefits as a result of the  
recitation of the verses, and reclaim  
Tulsidas’s wish that Hanuman will reside  
in his heart.
