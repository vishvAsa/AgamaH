title = "Hatha Yoga"

+++
System of religious discipline (**yoga**)  
based on a series of bodily postures  
known as **asanas**. Practicing this yoga is  
widely believed to provide various physical benefits, including increased bodily  
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic  
ailments. Yet in the **Yoga Sutras** written  
by **Patanjali**, the earliest systematic  
treatment of yoga, these asanas are only  
one part of an eight-step program that  
also includes such practices as breathing exercises and meditation. The purpose of hatha yoga is to train and  
strengthen the body so that the practitioner can sit comfortably in meditation. Although Hatha yoga’s emphasis is  
on the body, it assumes a spiritual and  
religious context that in contemporary  
times has often been either evaded or  
ignored—leading some Hindus to disparage such yoga as simply a technique  
to develop better sexual control.  
A more esoteric meaning of hatha  
yoga comes from the **Nathpanthi**  
**ascetics**, who understand hatha yoga as  
referring to processes in the **subtle**  
**body**. The subtle body is an alternate  
physiological system believed to reside  
on a different plane of existence than  
the actual body, but with certain correspondences to the actual body. It is visualized as a set of six psychic centers  
(**chakras**) running roughly along the  
course of the spine; above and below  
these centers are found the two divine  
principles, **Shiva** (awareness) and  
**Shakti** (power), the latter as the latent  
spiritual energy known as **kundalini**.  
The aspirant aims to combine kundalini  
with the Shiva principle at the crown of  
the head; through this union, the physical body will become immortal.  
According to the Nathpanthis, the  
phoneme *ha* refers to the **sun**, a symbol  
for Shakti, and the phoneme *tha* to the  
**moon**, which is a symbol of Shiva. Hatha  
yoga is interpreted as the union of the  
sun and moon—that is, these two centers of power are believed to exist in the  
subtle body.
