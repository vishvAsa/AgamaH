(d. 1552) Poet, singer, and founder of the  
**Radhavallabh** religious community,  
which is based on the figure of **Radha**.  
Initially portrayed as the god **Krishna’s**  
human consort, she was later considered his adulterous mistress. The  
Radhavallabh community took a very  
different perspective, stressing Radha’s  
nature as a **deity**, her equality and identity with Krishna, and her status as his  
lawful wife. The Radhavallabhs focused  
on the love (hit) of Radha for Krishna,  
and because of this emphasis the poet is  
also known as “Hit Harivamsh.”  
Harivamsh’s poetry treats many of  
the traditional themes found in Krishna  
devotionalism, but from the perspective of a female companion (**sakhi**). He  
compiled a collection of eighty-four  
poems known as the *Hit-chaurasi*,  
which are notable both for their highly  
Sanskritized language and for their  
incorporation of the **alamkara** (“poetic  
ornamentation”) tradition of earlier  
**Sanskrit** poetry. For further information

*of Sri Hit Harivams*, 1977.
