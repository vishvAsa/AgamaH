title = "House of Clay"

+++
Realm of punishment described in a  
verse in the **Rg Veda** (7.89), the earliest  
Hindu religious text. As described in this  
verse, the House of Clay is a place to  
which evildoers—particularly those  
guilty of speaking falsely—will be sent  
by the god **Varuna**, who is considered  
the guardian of righteousness and cosmic order (**rta**).  
As its name indicates, the House of  
Clay is a gloomy and joyless place. What  
is notable in the original verse is the lack  
of any notion of reincarnation (**samsara**), which later became a central  
Indian assumption. At the time it was  
seen as an undesirable and permanent  
state after death.
