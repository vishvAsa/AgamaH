title = "Haridwar"

+++
Sacred city (**tirtha**) on the **Ganges** River  
about 140 miles northeast of Delhi.  
Haridwar is one of India’s **Seven Sacred**  
**Cities**. Dying in one of these cities is  
believed to ensure the final liberation of  
one’s soul. It is located on the edge of the  
**Shiwalik Hills**, the foothills to the  
**Himalayas**, and is the place where the  
Ganges is believed to leave the mountains and enter the northern Indian  
plain. As with all the places where the  
Ganges makes some natural transition,  
Haridwar is considered especially holy,  
and has been a pilgrimage destination  
since at least the sixth century, when the  
Chinese pilgrim **Hsuan Tsang** reported  
enormous pilgrim crowds.  
Haridwar’s primary importance is as  
a bathing (**snana**) place, and it draws  
large crowds on festival days. For centuries it has been an important site  
for performing **asthi-visarjana**, the  
last of the funerary rites (**antyeshthi**  
**samskara**), in which the ashes of  
the deceased are immersed in the  
Ganges. Haridwar is also important as  
the gateway to the pilgrimage sites in  
the **Garhwal** region of the Himalayas,  
and during the pilgrim season  
(April–October) it serves as an important transit and supply point to places  
farther up in the mountains.  
Finally, Haridwar has a long history  
as a dwelling place for ascetics. It is a  
major center for several **ascetic** groups,  
273  
Haridwar  
particularly the **Naga** class of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, trader-soldiers  
who are devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**. It also serves as the winter quarters for many ascetics who spend their  
summers in the Himalayas. The presence of so many ascetics has had a profound effect on the city’s general  
character, both in the hundreds of  
**ashrams** that are spread throughout the  
city, and in the prohibitions on the sale  
of eggs, meat, and **liquor**.
