title = "Hasta"

+++
(“hand”) In Indian **dance**, **sculpture**,  
and ritual, a hasta is a particular hand  
position. In some cases, this hand position may have symbolic meaning, as in  
**varada** hasta or the “gift-giving” **gesture**; in other cases the hasta’s name  
may simply describe the shape of the  
hand, as in **kataka** hasta, in which the  
tips of the fingers are loosely joined to  
the thumb. In the context of dance, all  
of these gestures have been given multiple symbolic meanings, and the dancer  
can use these gestures to tell a story  
through her gestures.  
There is some overlap in meaning  
between the words hasta and **mudra**  
(“seal”), which are both used to describe  
hand gestures, and the two are sometimes used interchangeably. Of the two,  
mudras tend to be more strictly defined,  
and to be far more stylized than hastas.  
They stress the positions of the fingers,  
rather than of the entire hand; the fingers are always in very specific positions. Mudras always have very specific  
symbolic meanings.
