title = "Hiranyaksha"

+++
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyaksha is a  
**demon** king who is killed by the god  
**Vishnu**, in the latterâ€™s **avatar** or incarnation as a **Boar**. Hiranyaksha has performed harsh physical **ascetic** practice  
(**tapas**) and as result, gained various  
**divine powers**. He eventually grows so  
powerful and proud that he spirits away  
the **earth** herself, hiding her at the bottom of the cosmic ocean. It is at such  
times of cosmic crisis that Vishnu takes  
form on earth, to restore the equilibrium

Hiranyagarbha  
of the cosmos through his actions.  
Vishnu takes the form of a giant boar  
and dives to the bottom of the ocean,  
where he slays Hiranyaksha, places the  
earth on the tip of his tusk, and lifts her  
from the waters. With the reappearance  
of the earth, the process of creation  
resumed. See also **Boar avatar**.
