title = "Harijan"

+++
(“child of God”) Name used by  
**Mohandas Gandhi** (1869–1948) to designate those social groups formerly  
known as **untouchables**. The name  
reflected Gandhi’s conviction that these  
people were human beings like any others, and thus children of God.  
Unfortunately, the word *harijan*  
can also carry a pejorative sense in  
modern India. It is used for any child  
whose father is unknown—with the  
child’s paternity ascribed to God—and  
is thus a euphemism for “bastard.” In  
modern times, the people whom  
Gandhi called Harijans prefer to used  
the name **dalit** (“oppressed”), since  
they feel that this more accurately  
describes their social status.
