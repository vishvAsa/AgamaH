title = "Hindutva"

+++
(“Hindu-ness”) An idea first propounded  
by the political activist **Vinayak**  
**Damodar Savarkar**. It first appeared in a  
pamphlet titled *Hindutva/Who is a*  
*Hindu?* and is the fundamental basis of  
modern Hindu nationalism.  
Savarkar’s thesis was that the  
Hindus were a nation, despite their  
sharp regional, cultural, linguistic,  
and religious differences; furthermore, he defined a Hindu as anyone  
who considered India both fatherland  
and holy land. This loose definition  
was broad enough to encompass all  
of the variety found in Indian Hindu  
culture. But it was also clearly reaching for the lowest common denominator. For most Indians, identity is  
invariably based on concrete regional, linguistic, or sectarian grounds,  
rather than an abstract notions of  
being “Hindu.”  
Yet it is important to note who this  
loose definition excludes—Muslims  
and Christians, India’s most visible  
**minorities**, who are marginalized by  
virtue of their “alien” holy lands. By  
this definition, Hindus “belong” in  
India simply by virtue of who they are,  
whereas Muslims and Christians, no  
matter how long their families may  
have lived in India, are always considered to be outsiders.  
Hindutva ideology is a fundamental  
assumption of the **Rashtriya Svayamsevak**  
**Sangh** (RSS), a contemporary conservative Hindu organization, and the  
organizations that are affiliated with  
the RSS, particularly the **Vishva Hindu**  
**Parishad**, and to a lesser extent the  
**Bharatiya Janata Party**. Hindutva ideals  
are also a prominent feature of parties  
such as the **Shiv Sena**, which combine  
Hindu and regional identity. For further
