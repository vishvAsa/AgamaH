title = "Halebid"

+++
Village in the southern Indian state of  
**Karnataka**, about sixty miles northwest  
of the city of Mysore. As at its sister city,  
**Belur**, Halebid is known for a magnificent collection of temples from  
the **Hoysala dynasty**, who ruled  
western Karnataka from the eleventh  
to thirteenth centuries C.E. The  
most notable site at Halebid is the  
magnificent **Hoysaleshvar Temple**,  
269  
Halebid  
dedicated to **Shiva** in his form as Lord  
of the Hoysalas.  
At both Belur and Halebid, the temples were built from a particular type of  
stone—variously described as chlorite  
schist, steatite, or soapstone—that is  
quite soft when newly quarried, but  
gradually hardens with exposure to air.  
This initial malleability makes the stone  
easy to carve, and resulted in the lush  
detail characteristic of Hoysala temples.  
Architecturally speaking, Hoysala  
temples have certain unique features:  
a central hall connecting three starshaped sanctuaries, and temple towers  
(**shikharas**) composed of well-defined  
horizontal tiers, rather than the  
continuous upward sweep characteristic of the northern Indian **Nagara** architectural style.
