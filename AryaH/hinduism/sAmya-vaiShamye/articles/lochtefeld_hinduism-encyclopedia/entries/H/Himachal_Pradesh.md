+++
(“Himalayan State”) Modern Indian state  
located in the Himalayan region between  
the state **Jammu** and **Kashmir** and the  
kingdom of **Nepal**. Himachal Pradesh was  
created in 1966 when the former state of  
**Punjab** was divided into Punjab,  
**Haryana**, and Himachal Pradesh. As its  
name implies, Himachal Pradesh is a  
mountain state, with its lower regions in  
the **Shiwalik Hills** and its upper regions in  
the high **Himalayas**. Most of the state’s  
people live in the long, fertile river valleys  
between the mountain ranges, and in the  
hot **season** its hill stations provide welcome relief from the scorching heat.  
Himachal is the home for seven of  
the nine **Shiwalik goddesses**. These  
seven goddesses are all the presiding  
**deities** of a particular site, and some of  
them have become quite important in  
northern Indian religious life. Himachal  
Pradesh is also home to a spectacular  
**Dussehra** festival in the town of **Kulu**,  
at which all the gods in the Kulu Valley  
are brought to Kulu to honor the god  
**Rama** on his victory over the **demon**king **Ravana**. For general information,
