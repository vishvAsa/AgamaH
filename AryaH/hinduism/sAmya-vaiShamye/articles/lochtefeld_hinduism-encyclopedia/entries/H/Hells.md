title = "Hells"

+++
In Hinduism there are believed to be  
many additional planes of existence  
besides the visible earthly realm. These  
alternate planes of existence include the  
hells, which are conceived of as places of  
punishment for one’s past misdeeds.  
Traditional Hindu accounts describe  
the hells in great detail, often linking  
particular sorts of punishments to  
particular sinful actions. Just as with  
**heavens**, life in a hell is ultimately  
an impermanent state, although the  
time of punishment is usually described  
as enormously long and incredibly  
painful. Still, when the time of punishment is done and one’s bad deeds  
have been expiated, one will be reborn  
in a higher form.  
Needless to say, **birth** in any of  
the hells is something to be avoided if  
at all possible, and for this reason people  
are urged to perform penances  
(**prayashchitta**) for their sins while they  
are still living, so that the consequences  
of these sins may not burden them in  
their next lives.
