(“beneficial teaching”) A well-known  
moralistic story that is drawn from  
**Panchatantra**, a set of moralistic fables  
aimed at conveying practical and worldly  
wisdom. The *Hitopadesha* was compiled  
in the twelfth century as an introductory  
reader to **Sanskrit**.  
The frame story for the both of these  
texts describes a king who is distressed  
by his **sons’** lack of learning and good  
moral character; these doubts lead to  
grave misgivings about their abilities to  
be good and fair rulers after his death.  
He resolves this problem by hiring a  
teacher who teaches the boys using  
fables, often with several shorter fables  
embedded in a longer tale. The  
*Hitopadesha* was intended to give pragmatic advice about how to be successful  
in the real world and maintains that  
caution and self-interest are the keys to  
success in life.
