title = "Hanuman Jayanti"

+++
Festival of the god **Hanuman’s** birthday.  
In southern India, this is celebrated on  
the **full moon** in the **lunar month** of  
**Chaitra** (March–April), whereas in  
northern India it is more commonly celebrated on the fourteenth **day** of the  
dark (waning) half of the lunar month of  
**Kartik** (October–November). This latter  
date reflects the date of **Shivaratri**, the  
272  
Hanuman Chalisa  
most important festival of **Shiva**, which  
is celebrated on the fourteenth day of  
the waning half of the month **Phalgun**  
(usually in February). The two festivals  
are associated because Hanuman is  
sometimes deemed an **avatar** or “incarnation” of Shiva, come to **earth** to serve  
the god-king **Rama**.  
Although Hanuman’s primary mythic importance is as a faithful and powerful servant of Rama, in everyday  
religious life Hanuman is a very important **deity**, with a wide following. His  
birthday has no prescribed celebrations,  
but usually his devotees (**bhakta**) often  
mark it with **worship**, festive processions, and devotional reading of religious texts, particularly the **Hanuman**  
**Chalisa** and the **Ramayana**.
