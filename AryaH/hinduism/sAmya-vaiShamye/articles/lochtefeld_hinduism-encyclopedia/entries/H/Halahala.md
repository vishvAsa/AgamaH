title = "Halahala"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the name of the  
deadly poison produced when the  
gods and **demons** churn the Ocean  
of Milk. The gods and demons churn  
the ocean to produce **amrta**, the nectar  
of immortality. Yet their action produces not only the amrta, but also its  
antithesis, the halahala poison. This is  
an event of great peril, since if left  
unchecked this poison is so powerful  
that it will destroy the **earth**. The poison is neutralized by the god **Shiva**,  
who holds it in his throat without swallowing it. The poison turns his throat  
blue, hence one of his epithets is  
**Nilakanth**, “the blue-throated [one].”  
See also **Tortoise avatar**.
