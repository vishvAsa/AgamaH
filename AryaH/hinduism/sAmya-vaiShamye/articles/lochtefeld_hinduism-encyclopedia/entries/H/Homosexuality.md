title = "Homosexuality"

Although homosexuality is not  
unknown in Indian culture, it has never  
had a very prominent presence. The  
**Kama Sutra** contains a brief account of  
homosexual oral sex and the classes of  
men who performed this, but it is little  
more than a passing mention.  
In modern times, the male transvestites known as **hijras** often serve  
as homosexual prostitutes, and they  
are an accepted if marginal presence  
in Indian life.  
Although according to the dominant  
Hindu ethos the search for pleasure—of  
any kind—is an **aim of life** (purushartha),  
other factors have channeled the  
expression of sexual desire in other  
directions, especially toward traditional  
marriage. One of these is the general  
desire for progeny, particularly **sons**;  
another is the notion of the family as the  
basic unit for social life. In addition, the  
traditional male concern with losing  
vitality through seminal emission is a  
reason to abstain from sexual relations.  
Finally, the cultural assumption that  
ultimate wisdom comes only when one  
has renounced all desires would have  
affected sexual desire of all kinds.
