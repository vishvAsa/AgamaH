title = "Hoysala Dynasty"

+++
(11thâ€“14th c.) Southern Indian dynasty  
that ranged over the southern part of  
the southern Indian state of **Karnataka**.  
The capital city was **Dorasamudra**,  
which is now called **Halebid**.  
The Hoysalas were originally hill  
chiefs who were vassals to the  
**Chalukyas** (a central Indian dynasty  
that ruled from the seventh to eighth  
century C.E.), but who became independent in 1093. At their peak they ruled  
much of the states of Karnataka and  
northern **Tamil Nadu**, but by the beginning of the fourteenth century had seen  
their power decline. By the middle of the  
century, their kingdom had been  
annexed by the Sangamas, whose capital was at Vijayanagar.  
The Hoysalas are most famous for  
the magnificent temples they constructed  
at the cities of **Belur** and Halebid, which  
are treasure-houses of medieval southern Indian **sculpture**.
