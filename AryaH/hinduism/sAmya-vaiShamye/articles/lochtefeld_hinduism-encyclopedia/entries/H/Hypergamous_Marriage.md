title = "Hypergamous Marriage"

+++
A marriage in which the wife comes  
from a group with lower social status  
than the husband. Although the ideal  
Hindu marriage is between a man and  
woman of equal social status, hypergamous marriage was admitted as a possibility in the **dharma literature**, although  
it was not encouraged. In most cases, it  
was specified that a man’s first wife  
should be of equal social status, but that  
he was then permitted to marry **women**  
of lower status.  
In modern India, where the predominant form of marriage is still **arranged**  
**marriage**, most marriages are still  
between men and women of equal status. However, a hypergamous marriage  
is likely to generate less opposition than  
a hypogamous marriage, where a  
woman marries a man from a lower status group. In the dharma literature,  
hypergamous marriage was known as  
anuloma, “with the **hair**” (i.e., in the natural direction).
