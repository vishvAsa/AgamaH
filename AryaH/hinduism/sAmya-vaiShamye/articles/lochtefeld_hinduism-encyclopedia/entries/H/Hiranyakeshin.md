(4th c. B.C.E.?) Sage, writer, and commentator, also considered a disciple of the  
writer **Apastamba**. Apastamba is the  
author of a type of text known as a **Kalpa**  
**Sutra**. He is only one of three authors,  
along with **Baudhayana** and  
**Hiranyakeshin**, whose surviving works  
contain all three elements prescribed for  
a Kalpa Sutra: prescriptions for Vedic rituals (**Shrauta Sutras**), for domestic rites  
(**Grhya Sutras**), and for appropriate  
human behavior (**Dharma Sutras**).  
All three of these men belonged to  
the same school, the Taittiriya school of  
the **Black Yajur Veda**. According to tradition, Baudhayana was the oldest,  
Apastamba his disciple, and  
Hiranyakeshin Apastamba’s disciple.  
This chronology is supported by the  
texts themselves, since Baudhayana’s  
text is much less organized than the others, and more archaic in its language.
