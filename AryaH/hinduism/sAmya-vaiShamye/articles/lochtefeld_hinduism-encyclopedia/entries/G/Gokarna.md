title = "Gokarna"

+++
(“**cow’s** ear”) Sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
state of **Karnataka** on the shore of the  
Arabian Sea, just south of Karnataka’s  
border with the state of **Goa**. Gokarna is  
most famous for a temple to the god  
**Shiva** in his form as Mahabaleshvara,  
the “exceedingly powerful Lord.”  
According to the site’s charter myth,  
Shiva intends to perform the work of  
creation, but before he begins he  
becomes rapt in meditation in the  
depths of the earth. The god **Brahma**  
grows impatient with the delay and carries out the work of creation himself.  
Shiva is enraged when he discovers what  
has happened and is about to force his  
way up through the earth, which will  
create a terrible cataclysm. The earth  
appears to Shiva in the form of a cow,  
who begs him to rise to the surface  
through her ear. It is claimed that a cave  
at Gokarna is the remnant of that passage through which Shiva rose.
