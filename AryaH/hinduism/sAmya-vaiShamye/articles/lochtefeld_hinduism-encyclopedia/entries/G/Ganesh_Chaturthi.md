title = "Ganesh Chaturthi"

+++
Festival falling on the fourth (chaturthi)  
**day** of the bright or waxing half of  
the **lunar month** of **Bhadrapada**  
(August–September), dedicated to the  
**worship** of the god **Ganesh**. This festival  
is observed throughout India, but is particularly celebrated in **Maharashtra**.  
During this festival clay images of  
Ganesh are consecrated and worshiped.  
At the festival’s end the images are carried in procession for ceremonial  
immersion in bodies of **water**—whether  
the sea, a river, or the village pond.  
Although Ganesh is a relatively  
minor **deity** in the Hindu pantheon,  
his role as the Lord of Obstacles  
(Vighneshvar) makes him important in  
everyday life, since his involvement can  
either further or hinder one’s efforts. For  
this reason, Ganesh is always worshiped  
at the start of any endeavor and at the  
beginning of all religious ceremonies.  
While Ganesh plays an important role in  
people’s everyday lives, the festival  
Ganesh Chaturthi gained prominence in  
Maharashtra for political reasons. **Bal**  
**Gangadhar Tilak**, one of the most  
important figures in the nineteenthcentury Hindu renaissance, promoted  
the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi as a  
visible way to assert and celebrate a  
Hindu nationalist identity during the  
time of British imperial rule. Given the  
power of British rule, outright rebellion  
was simply impossible, and the British  
government heavily restricted all forms  
of political dissent. The Ganesh festival  
provided a way to circumvent these  
restrictions, since the British had a longstanding policy of not interfering with  
religious observances. The celebration

Ganesh Chaturthi  
of this festival in Maharashtra, particularly the processions to immerse the  
images in the sea, became an important  
theater to demonstrate and affirm  
Hindu cultural and political identity.
