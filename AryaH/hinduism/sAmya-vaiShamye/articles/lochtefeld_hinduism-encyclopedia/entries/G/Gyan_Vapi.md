(“well of knowledge”) A well that is the  
sole part of the original **Vishvanath**  
temple in the city of **Benares**. The temple’s name refers to the god **Shiva** in his  
form as Vishvanath, “Lord of the  
Universe,” and was one of the most  
sacred Hindu sites in medieval India. In  
1669 the armies of the Moghul emperor  
267  
Gyan Vapi  
**Aurangzeb** razed the temple and built a  
mosque in its place. Although the temple’s destruction is usually portrayed as  
an act of Muslim iconoclasm, according  
to Gyan Vapi’s account, Aurangzeb may  
have also intended it as a political message to punish local rebellion. According  
to local legend, the image of Shiva as  
Vishvanath was thrown into the well to  
protect it from desecration, and it  
remains there to this day.
