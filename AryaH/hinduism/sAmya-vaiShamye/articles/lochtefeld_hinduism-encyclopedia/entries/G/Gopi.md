title = "Gopi"

+++
(feminine of *gopa*, “**cow**-keeper”) In  
Hindu mythology, the gopis are the cowkeeping **women** who are the god  
**Krishna’s** companions in **Braj**, the  
region south of Delhi in which Krishna is  
believed to have spent his early life. The  
gopis are the simple village women of  
Braj, who keep the village cows, churn  
the milk into butter for sale, and provide  
Krishna with an adoring and familiar  
presence as he grows up. They exclaim  
over his beauty as an infant and they  
endure his boyhood pranks—particularly his continual theft of their hardearned butter. When he becomes an  
enchanting adolescent, they respond  
to the nightly call of his flute to join  
him in the circular **dance** (**ras lila**) on  
the shores of the river **Yamuna**.  
Although the gopis are completely  
devoted to Krishna and love him above  
all else, their relations with him are  
also devoid of any affectation or awe.  
The gopis are simple country women,  
and they treat Krishna as one of their  
own. For example, they feel no qualms  
about scolding him when he has stolen  
their butter. Their intimate but unaffected  
relationship with Krishna makes them  
paradigms for the ideal devotee (**bhakta**).  
For his part, Krishna is said to prefer this  
sort of natural and spontaneous relationship to any sort of calculated **worship**. Krishna loves Braj more than any  
other place on **earth** because the people  
there treat him as one of their own.
