title = "Gandiva"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Gandiva is the  
name of the bow carried by **Arjuna**.  
Arjuna is the world’s greatest archer  
and the third of the five **Pandava** brothers, the *Mahabharata*’s protagonists.  
Gandiva was originally fashioned by  
the god **Brahma** and is given to Arjuna  
by the god **Varuna** (identified with the  
ocean) at the request of another **deity**,  
**Agni** (“**fire**”). Agni makes this request  
because he wants to “eat” (burn) the  
**Khandava forest**, but is afraid of interference in the form of rain from the god  
**Indra**, ruler of the storm. Arjuna uses  
the bow to create a canopy of arrows  
that shields the forest from Indra’s  
storms, thus allowing Agni to consume  
the forest in peace. Arjuna uses this  
bow for many years. At the end of his  
life he returns it to Varuna by throwing  
it into the sea.
