title = "Ghat"

+++
In its broadest meaning, a ghat is a  
bathing (**snana**) place by a body of  
**water**, such as a river, lake, or pond. The  
word ghat is also commonly used to  
refer to the permanent structures that  
have been built at these bathing places.  
They usually include a flat area at the  
waterâ€™s edge, where people can walk,  
stand, or sit. A set of steps leads from the  
platform into and below the surface of  
the water. Constructing a ghat is often  
considered a pious act that generates  
religious merit. This is particularly  
true in pilgrimage places (**tirtha**),  
where ghats are often centers for public  
religious life.
