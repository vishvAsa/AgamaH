Princely protagonist of *The Song of*  
*Gopichand*, an allegorical adventure  
that is much beloved throughout  
northern India and has even spread to  
Bengal where it is called **The Song of**  
**Manik Chandra**. The story tells of the  
trials of Gopichand, who loses his kingdom through the vicissitudes of fate  
but eventually regains it after numerous trials and setbacks. Aside from the  
song’s story, it is also embedded with  
the ideas of the **Nathpanthis**, an **ascetic**  
community supposedly founded by  
255  
Gopichand  
**Gorakhnath**. Some members of this  
community believed that perfecting  
their bodies through **yoga** would make  
them immortal. This idea appears in the  
song through its description of  
Gopichand’s mother Mayana, who has  
power over Death himself. In some versions of the story Mayana’s religious preceptor is identified as a low-**caste**  
sweeper, while in others it is the sage  
Gorakhnath himself. Two versions of  
this song have been translated by G. A.  
Grierson in the *Journal of the Asiatic*  
*Society of Bengal*, the first published in  
1878 and the second in 1885.
