title = "Gokulnath"

+++
(1551–1640) The third **guru** of the religious community known as the **Pushti**  
**Marg**. Gokulnath inherited the mantle  
of leadership from his father **Vitthalnath**,  
who was the successor to his father  
**Vallabhacharya**, the community’s founder.  
During his tenure Gokulnath helped  
solidify the religious community and  
paid particular attention to its organization. He is best known for compiling  
several hagiographic works describing  
the careers of his father and grandfather, to provide an appropriately reverent picture for their followers.  
Gokulnath was also the moving force  
behind a text named the **Chaurasi**  
**Vaishnavan ki Varta** (“Account of  
eighty-four Vaishnavas”), although the  
actual text was probably compiled by  
Gokulnath’s disciple **Hariray**. This text is  
a sectarian hagiography describing the  
lives of eighty-four paradigmatic  
**Vaishnavas**, all of whom—at least  
according to the text—were associates  
and disciples of Vallabhacharya and  
Vitthalnath. The text’s real purpose is  
not to provide a biography, but to illustrate the importance of the Pushti Marg  
and its leaders.
