title = "Ganga Sagar"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) on **Sagar** Island,  
which is located at the outer edge of the  
Hugli River delta in the Bay of Bengal.  
Ganga Sagar is where the **Ganges** River  
merges with the sea (sagar). As with all  
the places where the Ganges makes  
some natural transition, this spot is considered especially holy. Ganga Sagarâ€™s  
biggest festival comes on **Makara**  
**Sankranti**, the **day** in January when the  
**sun** resumes its northward course. On  
this day, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims come to bathe (**snana**). The site is  
also famous for a temple to the irascible  
sage **Kapila**, whose fiery power incinerates the 60,000 **sons** of King Sagar and  
sets in motion a series of events leading  
to King **Bhagirath** bringing the Ganges  
down to **earth**.
