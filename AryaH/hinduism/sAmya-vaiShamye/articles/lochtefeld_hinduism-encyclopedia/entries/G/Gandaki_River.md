One of the tributaries of the **Ganges**, it  
flows southward from **Nepal**, joining the  
Ganges at the city of Patna in the state of  
**Bihar**. Although the riverâ€™s source is now  
extremely poor, in the time of the  
Buddha it contained major urban centers, particularly the city of **Vaishali**.
