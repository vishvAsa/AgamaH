In Hindu astrology, gemstones are used  
to strengthen, neutralize, or counteract  
the celestial influence of certain **planets**. Hindu astrology recognizes nine  
planets, each of which is associated with  
a particular gemstone: **sun** (ruby),  
**moon** (pearl), **Mars** (coral), **Mercury**  
(emerald), **Jupiter** (topaz), **Venus** (diamond), **Saturn** (sapphire), **Rahu** (agate),  
and **Ketu** (turquoise). Each of these nine  
planets is considered to be a minor **deity**  
and to have a distinct personality and  
characteristics. When deciding which  
gemstones to wear, one must make certain astrological considerations, particularly the position of the planets in one’s  
**natal horoscope** (janampatrika), which  
is believed to reveal each planet’s influence. These gemstones are worn  
in rings, with the base of the stone  
in contact with the skin to give the  
gemstones their efficacy over their  
planetary counterparts.
