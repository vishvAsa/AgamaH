(“Lord of Compassion”) One of the  
twelve **jyotirlingas**, a group of images of  
the god **Shiva** that are deemed particularly holy and powerful. Shiva is believed  
to be uniquely present at these places.  
This particular jyotirlinga is located in  
the village of **Velur** in the state of  
**Maharashtra**, and is also known as  
Dhushmeshvar. This site is unusual  
because the form of Shiva that resides  
here is known by two different names  
and has no unequivocal charter myth.  
At none of the other jyotirlingas is there  
any doubt about the presiding **deity’s**  
form or how it came to be there. This  
indicates that Ghrneshvar is a minor  
site, perhaps one simply filling out  
the catalog of the jyotirlingas to get  
the number up to twelve. Despite  
this apparent lack of importance,  
Ghrneshvar is arguably the most-visited  
of the jyotirlingas. It is only a few  
miles from the world famous cave  
temples at **Ellora** and is a regular stop  
on the local tourist circuit. The temple is  
fairly small but is well kept and very  
impressive. Male visitors are required to  
remove their shirts before entering  
Shiva’s presence.
