title = "Goswami, Sanatana"

+++
(ca. mid-16th c.) A disciple of the  
Bengali saint **Chaitanya**, and a pivotal  
figure in the establishment of the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** community, along  
with his brother **Rupa Goswami** and his  
nephew **Jiva Goswami**. Although the  
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by  
the poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the  
Goswamis who brought order and systematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic  
devotionalism. Records indicate that the  
Goswamis were **brahmins** whose families originally hailed from the  
**Karnataka** region. The family had settled in Bengal, where Rupa and  
Sanatana were in the service of a local  
Muslim ruler. However, their lives were  
transformed when Rupa and Sanatana  
met Chaitanya. Chaitanya dispatched  
the brothers to **Brindavan**, the village  
where the god **Krishna** is believed to  
have spent his childhood, with instructions to settle there and reclaim it as a  
holy place. The three Goswamis lived  
there for several decades, reclaiming the  
sacred sites (**tirthas**), having temples  
built, and above all providing the ideas  
and institutions that defined the  
Gaudiya Vaishnava community.  
Sanatana was more of a devotee  
(**bhakta**) than a scholar. This is evident  
in his written works, which tend to  
be either devotional songs or commentaries on religious texts. Sanatana’s most  
famous text is the *Hari-bhakti-vilasa*  
(“The delight of devotion to Hari”), for  
which he wrote a commentary as well.
