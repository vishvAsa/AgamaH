title = "Goswami, Rupa"

+++
(ca. mid-16th c.) A disciple of the  
Bengali saint **Chaitanya**, a pivotal figure  
in the establishment of the **Gaudiya**  
**Vaishnava** community, along with his  
brother **Sanatana Goswami**, and his  
nephew **Jiva Goswami**. Although the  
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by  
the poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the  
Goswamis who brought order and systematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic  
devotionalism. Records indicate that the  
Goswamis were **brahmins** whose families originally hailed from the  
**Karnataka** region. The family had settled in Bengal, where Rupa and  
Sanatana were in the service of a local  
Muslim ruler. However, their lives were  
transformed when Rupa and Sanatana  
met Chaitanya. Chaitanya dispatched  
the brothers to **Brindavan**, the village  
where the god **Krishna** is believed to  
have spent his childhood, with instructions to settle there and reclaim it as a  
holy place. The three Goswamis lived  
there for several decades, reclaiming the  
sacred sites (**tirthas**), having temples  
built, and above all providing the ideas  
and institutions that defined the  
Gaudiya Vaishnava community. Rupa  
was a passionate devotee (**bhakta**) of  
Krishna, but also had interests as a  
dramatist and a scholar. In addition to  
258  
Gosala Maskariputra  
writing poetry as a vehicle for expressing  
devotion to Krishna, he also focused on  
analyzing **bhakti** as an emotional experience. He is most famous for enumerating  
the five **modes of devotion**, explaining  
the different possible ways to experience the love of God. For further information see Sushil Kumar De, *Early*
