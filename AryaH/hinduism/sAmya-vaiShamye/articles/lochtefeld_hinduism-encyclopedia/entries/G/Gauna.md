This is the name for the ceremony of  
taking a new bride into her marital  
home for the first time. The addition of a  
new bride marks an important change  
for a family and is a time of both opportunity and danger. On one hand, it carries the potential for great blessings,  
since it is assumed that the bride and  
groom will soon begin a family. On the  
other hand, it also carries the threat of  
danger since the addition of a new person to the family brings the potential for  
disruption. The bride and her new family  
perform various rituals to ensure that  
her addition to the family will be auspicious and harmonious.
