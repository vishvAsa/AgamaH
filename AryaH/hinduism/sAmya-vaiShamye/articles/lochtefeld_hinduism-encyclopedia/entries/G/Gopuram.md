In the **Dravida** style of temple **architecture**, which was mainly prevalent in  
southern India, gopurams are the ornate  
temple gateways in the center of the  
temple’s perimeter walls. Temples built  
in the Dravida style tend to be shorter  
than temples built in the northern  
Indian **Nagara** style, but compensate for  
this by stretching over vast areas, often  
forming towns in their own right. There  
are usually four gopurams, one for each  
of the cardinal directions; in some cases  
these gopurams are ten stories tall and  
can be seen for miles from the surrounding countryside. The gopurams  
were originally fortified gateways built  
to restrict access to the temple, but in  
present times their function is more  
decorative. By dominating the skyline  
around the temple—much like spires of  
Gothic cathedrals—gopurams are a  
pronouncement about the power of  
the resident **deities** (and their client  
rulers); they have also helped to educate  
the faithful, since they are usually  
covered with sculptures detailing  
mythological themes.
