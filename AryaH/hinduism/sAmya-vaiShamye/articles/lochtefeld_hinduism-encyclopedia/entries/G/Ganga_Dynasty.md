title = "Ganga Dynasty"

+++
(11th–15th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty  
that ruled the coastal strip on the Bay of  
Bengal in the modern states of **Orissa**  
and **Andhra Pradesh**. Although the  
Ganga dynasty was never more than a  
regional power, it left an artistic legacy  
in a series of stunning temples in modern Orissa. The Ganga dynasty was  
responsible for the temple to the god  
**Jagannath** in the city of **Puri** and the  
**Sun Temple** at **Konarak**, built by king  
Narasimhadeva (r. 1238–1264). The  
dynasty also built temples scattered  
throughout the modern city of  
**Bhubaneshvar**, including the temple to  
the god **Shiva** as Tribhuvaneshvar, “the  
Lord of the Triple World,” from which  
the city takes its name.
