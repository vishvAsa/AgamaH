(“cow’s mouth”) Sacred site (**tirtha**) high  
in the **Himalayas**. It is located at the  
glacier that is the actual source of the  
**Bhagirathi** River, one of the tributaries  
of the **Ganges**. Gaumukh is twelve miles  
upriver from **Gangotri**, the place that is  
ritually celebrated as the source of the  
Ganges. In popular Hindu belief, the  
Ganges is believed to issue from the  
mouth of a **cow**, hence the name.
