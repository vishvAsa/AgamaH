title = "Gaudiya Vaishnava"

+++
Religious community founded by the  
Bengali saint **Chaitanya** (1486–1533).  
It takes its name from the ancient  
name for Bengal (**Gauda**), and its  
stress on the **worship** of the god  
**Vishnu**. The community’s religious  
practices and beliefs are founded in  
Chaitanya’s ecstatic devotionalism. He  
asserted that the path to religious  
ecstasy is the repetitive recitation of  
**Krishna’s** name, often while singing  
and dancing in the streets. Chaitanya’s  
religious charisma gained him many  
followers, of whom the most important  
were the **Goswamis**—the brothers  
Rupa and **Sanatana**, and their nephew  
**Jiva**. At Chaitanya’s command the  
Goswamis went to live in **Brindavan**,  
the village where Krishna is believed  
to have grown up. The Goswamis’  
descendants live there to this day. In  
Brindavan, the Goswamis set about organizing and systematizing the philosophical foundation of Chaitanya’s ecstatic  
experience. Although they conceived of  
themselves as Chaitanya’s servants,  
they are equally important in the community’s development. The Goswamis’  
key philosophical doctrine was  
**achintyabhedabheda**, the idea that  
there was an “inconceivable identity  
and difference” between the Supreme  
Divinity (Krishna) and the human being  
that renders the soul simultaneously  
identical to and different from the divinity. The Gaudiya Vaishnava community  
is also famous for its exhaustive analysis  
of devotion (**bhakti**) as an emotional  
experience. They enumerated the different ways to experience the love of god as  
five **modes of devotion**. For further
