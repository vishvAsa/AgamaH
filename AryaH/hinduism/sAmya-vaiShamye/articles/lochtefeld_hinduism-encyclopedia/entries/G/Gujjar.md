In traditional northern Indian society,  
the Gujjars were a **jati** whose hereditary occupation was herding cattle,  
buffalo, and other livestock. Jatis  
were **endogamous** subgroups in  
traditional Indian society that  
were organized (and their social  
status determined) by the groupâ€™s  
hereditary occupation.
