(“release of the **elephant**-king”) The  
name of a particular incident in Hindu  
mythology involving a battle between  
king **Indradyumna**, in the form of  
a giant elephant, and a **Gandharva**  
(celestial musician) named **Huhu**, in  
the form of a giant crocodile. Both  
Indradyumna and Huhu have assumed  
these forms as the result of a **curse**.  
Indradyumna has been cursed by the  
sage **Agastya**, who becomes angry when  
the meditating king fails to greet him  
with proper respect. Huhu has been  
cursed by the sage Devala, when the  
amorous **water** play between Huhu and  
some celestial damsels has disturbed  
the sage’s meditation.  
The struggle between the two **animals** begins when the elephant comes  
to the water to drink and the crocodile  
grabs him by the leg. The crocodile  
attempts to pull the elephant into deeper water while the elephant struggles to  
break free. The pair are so evenly [[231]]  
matched that neither can best the other.  
After the battle has raged for a thousand  
years the god **Vishnu** appears, kills the  
crocodile, and restores Indradyumna to  
his previous form. The story thus takes  
its name, the “release of the elephant  
king,” because Indradyumna was freed  
from the crocodile’s grasp and the  
effects of the curse.
