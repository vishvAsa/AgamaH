title = "Gauri-Shankar"

+++
A particular variety of **rudraksha**, a bead  
made from the dried seed of the tree  
*Elaeocarpus ganitrus*, which is considered sacred to **Shiva**. The rudraksha is  
often strung into garlands and worn by  
Shivaâ€™s devotees (**bhakta**). The GauriShankar rudraksha is made when two  
seeds grow together naturally. Although  
the Gauri-Shankar is not as rare as certain other beads, it is unusual enough to  
command a fairly good price. The GauriShankar is revered as a natural manifestation of the divine couple, the **goddess**  
**Parvati** (Gauri) and the god Shiva  
(Shankar). It thus represents the total  
presence of divinity in its eternal and its  
dynamic aspects: Shiva as knowledge  
and Parvati as **Shakti** or power.
