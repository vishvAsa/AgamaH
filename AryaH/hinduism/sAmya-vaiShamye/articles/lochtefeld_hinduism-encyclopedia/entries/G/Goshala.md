title = "Goshala"

(“abode of cows”) In modern India, a  
goshala is a rest home for aged, infirm,  
and unproductive cows, where they can  
live for the rest of their lives in peace and  
happiness. Goshalas are usually established and supported as acts of religious  
merit, to provide for cows that would  
either be slaughtered or abandoned.  
These institutions are built as a sign of  
respect for cattle, which is one of the  
most pervasive ideas in Hindu culture.
