title = "Gandhi Jayanti"

+++
Indian national holiday falling on  
October 2, celebrating the **birth** of  
**Mohandas Gandhi**. Perhaps because  
Gandhi is a relatively recent figure, or  
because the event is a national holiday,  
this celebration is one of the few that is  
marked according to the common  
era **calendar**, rather than the lunar  
calendar that is used to determine most  
Hindu festivals.
