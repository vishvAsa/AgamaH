(“Lord of [**Shiva’s**] Host”) **Elephant**headed god who leads Shiva’s horde of  
divine followers; another name for  
Ganesh is Ganapati. Ganesh is usually  
portrayed as short and fat, with a bowl of  
sweets and his **animal** vehicle, the **rat**,  
close by. Among the items most often  
portrayed in his hands are a lotus  
(padma) and his own broken tusk. He  
also often holds a noose and an  
elephant goad (**ankusha**), which symbolize his power to restrain or move  
obstructing forces.  
Although Ganesh is worshiped as a  
primary **deity** by a small sectarian community, the **Ganpatyas**, most Hindus  
**worship** him as a subsidiary deity along  
with their principal divinities. Ganesh’s  
importance in Hindu life, however, is far  
greater than his relatively minor place in  
the pantheon. Hindus consider Ganesh

A sculpture of the god Ganesh from the village of  
Khajuraho. As “Lord of Obstacles,” Ganesh has the  
power to remove or bestow difficulties.  
as “Lord of Obstacles” (Vighneshvar),  
who has the power both to remove and  
to bestow difficulties, depending on  
whether or not a person has pleased  
him. Hindus invoke Ganesh at the start  
of any important undertaking—whether  
it is performing a religious ritual, starting a business, performing a marriage,  
building a home, or even taking a school  
examination—so that through his **grace**,  
potential obstacles may be removed or  
avoided and the undertaking will proceed smoothly and successfully. This  
power over obstacles is symbolized both  
by his elephant head and his animal  
vehicle, the rat. The elephant’s strength  
allows it to break down any impediments, while the rat is able to slip  
through the smallest cracks to gain  
access to locked places. Ganesh’s **aniconic image** is the threshold, the transitional strip dividing and separating  
different spaces, which further symbolizes his power to control transitions  
from one state to another.  
Ganesh is considered to be the **son**  
of the god **Shiva** and his wife **Parvati**,  
but he is born in an unusual manner.  
One day when Parvati is bathing  
(**snana**), she forms a child from the dirt  
from her body, animates him, and  
directs him to permit no one to enter  
her bathing place. When Shiva comes  
to the door Ganesh bars his way, and in  
the ensuing battle Shiva cuts off  
Ganesh’s head. Parvati is so upset that  
Shiva promises to replace the missing  
head with the head of the first animal  
he encounters, which happens to be an  
elephant. Upon reviving Ganesh, Shiva  
appoints him as the leader of his troop  
of followers. As a further boon, Shiva  
tells Ganesh that he will be worshiped  
before any other deity.  
Ganesh’s elephant head has a broken  
tusk, and there are differing myths  
recounting how this happened. In one  
story it comes from an altercation with  
the **Parashuram avatar**, who tries to  
enter Shiva’s chambers while Ganesh is  
guarding the door. According to another  
account, the injury is self-inflicted. In a  
fit of rage at the **moon**, Ganesh breaks  
off his tusk and throws it at the moon.  
According to tradition, Ganesh uses  
this tusk as a pen to write down the  
text of the epic **Mahabharata** as it is  
dictated by the sage **Vyasa**. For further
