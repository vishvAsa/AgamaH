title = "Gandharva Marriage"

+++
One of the eight forms of marriage recognized in the **dharma literature**, the  
treatises on religious duty. A **Gandharva**  
marriage takes place when a man and  
woman have sexual intercourse by  
mutual consent, but without consulting  
anyone else. The marriage is so named  
because gandharvas, who are demigods  
and celestial musicians, are said to be  
the witnesses. Although the gandharva  
rite created a valid marriage, it was considered one of the four reprehensible  
(**aprashasta**) forms of marriage because  
it was done without parental consent,  
performed without religious rituals, and  
was rooted in lust. These marriages were  
recognized not to sanction and legitimize promiscuous behavior, but to provide the woman with the legal status of a

wife. Although **Sanskrit** literary sources  
are replete with Gandharva marriages—  
perhaps the most famous being the  
marriage of King **Dushyanta** and  
**Shakuntala**—it is doubtful that this  
form was ever widely practiced. See also
