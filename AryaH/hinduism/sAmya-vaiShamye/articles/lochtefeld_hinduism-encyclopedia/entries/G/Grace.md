title = "Grace"

The notion of divine grace has been and  
remains vitally important in Hindu devotional religiosity (**bhakti**), although it is  
perceived differently among the various  
devotional movements in Hinduism. In  
the Tamil devotionalism that marked the  
earliest articulation of the bhakti movement, the two major religious groups, the  
**Alvars** and the **Nayanars**, both stressed  
the utter transcendence of their chosen  
god and the gulf between God and human  
beings. In this understanding, grace  
became something only God could give  
freely. Only God had the power to transform human beings and bring their souls  
to final liberation—a notion of grace not  
far removed from Christian ideas. Within  
the **Shrivaishnavas**, a later southern  
260  
Govardhan Math  
Indian religious community, there was a  
debate whether liberation was primarily  
achieved through one’s faith or one’s  
works. The **Tengalai** school favored faith  
and argued that liberation came from God  
alone. In contrast, the **Vadagalai** school  
favored a person’s works and countered  
that humans had to respond to divine  
grace in order for their souls to gain final  
liberation. The importance of divine transcendence and omnipotence, as articulated by Tamil devotionalism, has remained  
an important part of Hindu piety, even to  
the present time.  
Southern Indian bhakti tended to  
express the **deity**-devotee (**bhakta**) relationship using images of master and servant. Northern Indian bhakti,  
particularly that which focused on the  
gods **Rama** and **Krishna**, stressed other  
images of this relationship: friend and  
friend, parent and child, lover and  
beloved. These differing conceptions  
necessarily influenced the notion of  
grace, ranging from the idea of God as  
other and saving power to the sacred  
quality coming from sharing everyday  
interactions. In the latter, grace is manifested through being able to take part in  
God’s divine play (**lila**), to play with God,  
and thus take part in the divine world. In  
this model, God is immanent rather  
than transcendent, and divine activity  
comes in the guise of sharing the ordinary activities of human life. All of these  
models can be found in modern Hindu  
religious life, although certain ones are  
more strongly associated with particular  
groups or religious communities.
