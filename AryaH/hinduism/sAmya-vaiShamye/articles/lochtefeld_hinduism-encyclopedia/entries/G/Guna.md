(“quality”) A fundamental concept that  
originated in the **Samkhya** philosophical school, but has become one of the  
key ideas in the Hindu worldview. The  
word *guna* literally means “strand,” and  
by extension a “quality,” of which there  
are believed to be three: **sattva** (“goodness”), **rajas** (“passion”), and **tamas**  
(“darkness”). According to the Samkhyas,  
in the time before the **evolution** of  
**prakrti** (primal matter), these three  
qualities were in perfect equilibrium.  
As mental activity began to disturb the  
balance, prakrti evolved into the subjective self and the objective world. All  
things and beings in the world have  
these three basic qualities, but their  
nature and tendencies differ according  
to the differing proportions. The quality sattva is always positive and carries  
associations with goodness, truth,  
wholesomeness, health, cognitive thought,  
and deep-rooted religious life. The  
quality tamas is always negative and is  
associated with darkness, ignorance,  
sloth, spoilage, and death. Rajas can  
be either positive or negative,  
depending on the context. It is negative when one becomes a slave to  
one’s passions, blinding one to careful  
and conscious thought. However,  
one’s passions can also help to engender activity and industriousness.  
Although much of Samkhya metaphysics has been long discredited, the  
notion of all things drawing their tendencies from the differing proportion of  
these three gunas has become an  
accepted part of Indian culture.
