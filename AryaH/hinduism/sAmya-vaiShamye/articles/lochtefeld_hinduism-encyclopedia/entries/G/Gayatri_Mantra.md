title = "Gayatri Mantra"

+++
A particular verse from the **Rg Veda**  
(3.62.10), the oldest Hindu religious text;  
this verse is written in the poetic **meter**  
named gayatri, hence its name. The  
verse itself is an invocation to the **sun**  
and can be translated “let us meditate  
on the sun, most excellent of all the  
**deities**, may he inspire our minds.”  
Reciting the Gayatri mantra is part of the  
morning and evening **worship** (**sandhya**) prescribed for every “**twice-born**”  
man who has received the adolescent  
religious **initiation** known as the “second birth.” An important part of this initiation is the transmission of this  
**mantra** to the young man. Although the  
Gayatri must be recited every **day**, it  
should not be recited over **water**; in  
earlier times this was one reason why  
many orthodox Hindus were reluctant  
to travel abroad.
