title = "Gangotri"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) in the **Himalayas** at  
the headwaters of the **Bhagirathi** River,  
one of the Himalayan tributaries of the  
**Ganges**. Ritually speaking, Gangotri is  
considered to be the source of the  
Ganges, although the riverâ€™s actual  
source is the glacier at **Gaumukh**,  
another twelve miles upstream. Its high  
altitude also means that it is only accessible between late April and October,  
after which it is closed for the winter  
months. One ritual center in Gangotri  
is the river itself, in which pilgrims  
bathe (**snana**), braving the frigid  
waters. The other center is the temple  
to the **goddess Ganga**, first built about  
250 years ago by the Gurkha monarch  
Amar Singh Thapa and restored in the  
late nineteenth century by the royal  
house of Jaipur. By the side of the river  
is a large stone slab, on which the sage  
**Bhagirath** is said to have performed his  
austerities to bring the Ganges down to  
**earth**. As with all the places where the  
Ganges makes some transition,  
Gangotri is considered particularly  
holy. Its sanctity is amplified because it  
is difficult to get to and is only accessible during the summer months.
