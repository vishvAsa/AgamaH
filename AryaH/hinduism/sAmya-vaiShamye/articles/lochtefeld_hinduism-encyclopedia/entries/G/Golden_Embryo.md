title = "Golden Embryo"

+++
One of the earliest cosmological myths.  
It first appears in the **Rg Veda** (10.121),  
the oldest Hindu religious text.  
According to this account, the universe  
originally consisted of the Golden  
Embryo (Hiranyagarbha). The Golden  
Embryo stirred and evolved into  
**Prajapati**, the creator of all things  
and ruler over all creatures. In this story,  
as with most other accounts of Hindu  
**cosmology**, the cosmos originates  
from a single source and is thus an  
organic whole.
