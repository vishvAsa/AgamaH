title = "Garhmukteshvar"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) on the **Ganges** River  
in the Ghaziabad district of the state of  
**Uttar Pradesh** about sixty miles due  
east of Delhi. Garhmukteshvar’s primary  
temple is dedicated to the god **Shiva** in  
his form as the “Lord of Liberation”  
(mukteshvar), but the site’s major  
importance comes from its location on  
the Ganges as a place for bathing  
(**snana**) and performing memorial rites  
(**shraddhas**) for the dead. Large crowds  
gather there to bathe on festival days,  
particularly on **Kartik Purnima**, the **full**  
**moon** in the **lunar month** of Kartik  
(October–November).
