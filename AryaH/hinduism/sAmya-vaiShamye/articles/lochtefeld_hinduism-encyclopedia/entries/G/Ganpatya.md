Sectarian Hindus who **worship** the god  
**Ganesh** as their primary **deity**. Most  
Hindus pay considerable homage to  
Ganesh, in part because his status as  
“Lord of Obstacles” (Vighneshvar) gives  
him power to help or hinder human  
endeavors. However, he is usually worshiped as a secondary deity. The  
Ganpatyas, in contrast, venerate Ganesh  
as their primary deity and worship no  
other deities. Most of the Ganpatyas live  
in the state of **Maharashtra**, where a  
network of shrines centered around the  
city of Pune and the nearby village of  
Chinchvad serves as their sacred center.  
The Ganpatya sect was founded by the  
sixteenth-century figure Moraya Gosavi,  
whose spiritual **initiation** came through  
a series of visions of Ganesh. One of his  
visions revealed that partial incarnations of Ganesh would be born in  
Moraya’s family for seven generations.
