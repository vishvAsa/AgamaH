title = "Gotra"

+++
A word for exogamous lineages.  
Lineages are particularly stressed  
among **brahmins**, although the status  
associated with some lineages sometimes led other **twice-born** groups to  
adopt them as well. The word literally  
means “**cow** pen,” and by extension the  
family is associated with a particular  
herd of cattle. Brahmins were believed  
to be descended from the seven sages—  
**Kashyapa**, **Vasishtha**, **Bhrgu**, **Gautama**,  
**Atri**, **Bharadvaja**, and **Vishvamitra**—  
with each family taking as its gotra the  
name of the sage believed to be its progenitor. The only situation in which it was  
really important was in marriages, since  
marriage within the gotra was forbidden. After marriage, a woman would  
adopt the gotra of her husband as part  
of her new identity. Since this practice  
was observed by brahmins, having  
a gotra became something of a status  
symbol. This led other twice-born  
groups to imitate the brahmins and  
adopt gotras as well.
