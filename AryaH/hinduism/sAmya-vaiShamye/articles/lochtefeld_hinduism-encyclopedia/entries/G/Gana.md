title = "Gana"

+++
(“host”) In Hindu mythology, a collective term for a group of minor gods  
who are the god **Shiva’s** servants and  
attendants. The members of this gana  
are often represented in frightening  
forms—smeared with ash, bearing  
skulls and weapons, physically malformed, and grinning and laughing  
horribly. The members of the gana are  
Shiva’s followers, supporters, and  
minions, who are ready to do his bidding when commanded. The leader of  
the gana is the god **Ganesh** (“Lord of  
the Host”).
