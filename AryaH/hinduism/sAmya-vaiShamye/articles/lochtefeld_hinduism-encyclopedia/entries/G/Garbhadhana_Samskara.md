title = "Garbhadhana Samskara"

+++
The first of the sixteen traditional  
life-cycle ceremonies (**samskaras**)  
performed at important moments  
throughout one’s life. The Garbhadhana  
Samskara was performed to ensure the  
conception of a child. This rite was performed on a specific **day** following the  
onset of the wife’s menstrual period,  
although different sources specify different days. Although part of this rite  
obviously involved sexual intercourse  
between husband and wife, as a whole it  
was meant to create a sacred context for  
the act of procreation.
