title = "Gobind Deo Mandir"

+++
A temple built in 1590 in **Brindavan**, the  
town believed to be the god **Krishna’s**  
childhood home. The temple is dedicated  
to **Krishna** in his form as the “Divine  
Cowherd.” From an architectural perspective, the temple is unique for its  
vaulted ceiling, which is seldom found  
in Hindu temples. The temple’s interior  
and exterior are also notable for their  
almost complete lack of figural ornamentation, which is extremely unusual.  
The temple is close to the major road  
connecting Agra and Delhi. These are  
the two major political centers of the  
Moghul empire (1525–1707), whose  
rulers were Muslims. Since many orthodox Muslims believe that figural representations are idolatrous, particularly in  
places of **worship**, the temple’s austere  
style may have been an attempt to avoid  
inciting Muslim iconoclasm. There is  
evidence of conflict between Hindus  
and Muslims at this site since the few  
figures inside the temple, carved into  
the lintels of door and windows, have  
had their heads broken off. See also  
**Moghul dynasty**.
