title = "Guruvayur"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) in the Thrussoor district in the southern Indian state of  
**Kerala**, a short distance inland from the  
Arabian Sea. Guruvayur is most famous  
for a temple to the god **Vishnu**, worshiped in his form as **Krishna**, and the  
temple’s main image is of Krishna as a  
young boy just past toddler age.  
According to the temple’s charter myth,  
the image at Guruvayur was originally at  
Krishna’s mythic kingdom in the city of  
**Dwaraka**, on the Arabian Sea in the  
northern Indian state of **Gujarat**. When  
Dwaraka was destroyed by floods, the  
image was saved from destruction by  
**Guru**, the **planet Jupiter**, and **Vayu**, the  
god of **wind**. These two **deities** brought  
the image to Kerala, and in their honor  
the place was named Guruvayur.  
Guruvayur’s mythic charter also  
describes the site’s power to heal ailments such as rheumatism and leprosy.  
This healing power is a great attraction  
in modern times, not only for people  
with rheumatism, skin diseases, and  
other afflictions, but also for childless  
**women** seeking children and pregnant  
women seeking an easy delivery and a  
happy child.
