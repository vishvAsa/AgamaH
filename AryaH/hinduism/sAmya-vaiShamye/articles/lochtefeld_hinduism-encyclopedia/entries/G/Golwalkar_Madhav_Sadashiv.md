+++
(1904–1973) Second sarsanghchalak  
(“Supreme Leader”) of the **Rashtriya**  
**Svayamsevak Sangh** (RSS). The RSS is a  
conservative Hindu organization whose  
express purpose is to provide the leadership cadre for a revitalized Hindu India;  
for most of its history it has characterized its mission as cultural, rather than

religious or political. Golwalkar is a pivotal figure in RSS history. He took office  
in 1940 upon the death of its founder,  
**Dr. K. B. Hedgewar**, and guided it  
through the tumultuous years surrounding India’s independence. After  
**Mohandas Gandhi’s** assassination by  
the Hindu nationalist **Nathuram Godse**  
in 1948, the RSS and several other organizations were briefly banned. Despite initial suspicions, the RSS has never been  
implicated in Gandhi’s death. During  
the ban the RSS continued to function  
underground, and many of its leaders  
became more politically active, a trend  
that Golwalkar had earlier discouraged.  
When the ban was rescinded in 1949,  
the RSS began to exercise greater influence by forming and sponsoring affiliated  
organizations, such as trade unions, student organizations, charitable institutions, and political parties. This trend  
continued throughout the rest of  
Golwalkar’s tenure, although he was far  
less activist than his successor,  
**Balasaheb Deoras**. For further information see Walter K. Andersen and
