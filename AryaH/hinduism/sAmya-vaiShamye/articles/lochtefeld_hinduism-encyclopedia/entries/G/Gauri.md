title = "Gauri"

+++
(“fair”) Epithet of the **goddess Parvati**,  
wife of the god **Shiva**. According to a  
story from the **Shiva Purana**, a sectarian text recounting the mythology of  
Shiva, Parvati takes offense when  
Shiva refers to her as **Kali** (“black”).  
She performs harsh physical austerities (**tapas**) to accumulate the power to  
rid herself of her dark complexion.  
When this is accomplished, she  
receives the epithet Gauri to signify  
her new and lightened complexion.  
This story illustrates the pervasive religious belief that physical hardship can  
give one spiritual and even magical  
powers, a conviction that is still found  
in contemporary India. This brief story  
also reveals the stigma that Indian  
society attributes to people with dark  
complexions—a prejudice that persists  
in modern times.
