title = "Gorakhnath"

+++
(13th c.?) Medieval **yogi** and wonderworker who is the founder of the  
**Nathpanthi ascetics**. There is little  
doubt that Gorakhnath was a historical  
person, and his teacher was named  
**Matsyendranath** (also known as  
Minanath). However, the accounts of his  
life tell of him performing so many miracles and wonders that they cannot be  
taken as factual. He is generally believed  
to have lived early in the thirteenth century, since the Maharashtrian poet-saint  
**Jnaneshvar** (1275–1296?) described his  
own spiritual preceptor as one of  
Gorakhnath’s disciples.  
Tradition regards Gorakhnath not  
only as a magician and a wonder-worker,  
but also as the author of the  
**Gorakhshatakam**. This text is a religious manual that gives instruction on a  
specific type of **yoga** practiced  
by Nathpanthi ascetics. The ultimate  
goal of this yogic practice is to transform  
the perishable elements in the physical  
body into immortal elements. Whether  
or not Gorakhnath authored this  
text, the spiritual instructions therein  
are consistent with those of the  
Nathpanthi ascetics who claim to be  
his disciples. According to legend,  
Gorakhnath and his most accomplished  
followers have never died, and their  
victory over death is a sign of their  
spiritual accomplishment. The most  
complete source on Gorakhnath and  
his followers, despite its age, is

and Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta,

also **Maharashtri**.
