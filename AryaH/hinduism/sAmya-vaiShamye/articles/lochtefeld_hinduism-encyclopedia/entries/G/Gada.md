title = "Gada"

+++
(“club”) In Hindu iconography, one of  
the identifying objects carried by the  
god **Vishnu**, along with the conch shell  
(**shankha**), lotus (**padma**), and discus  
(**chakra**). In the **Mahabharata**, the  
later of the two great Hindu epics, the  
gada is also the weapon of choice for  
**Bhima**, one of the five **Pandava** brothers who are the epic’s protagonists. Of  
these five brothers, Bhima is noted for  
his prodigious size and strength, which  
gives him obvious advantages in wielding the gada.
