The earliest reference to the transmigration of souls is found in both the  
**Brhadaranyaka Upanishad** (6.2) and  
the **Chandogya Upanishad** (5.10). These  
texts make a qualitative distinction  
between two different paths. The path to  
the world of the gods ultimately led to  
the **sun**, and the person traveling it did  
not return again, whereas the path to  
the **world of the fathers** led to the  
**moon**, and the person traveling it was  
eventually reborn on earth. The leitmotiv of the **Upanishads** is the need for  
individual spiritual realization, which is  
the key to getting on the path to the  
world of the gods. Those who gain this  
realization attain the final and ultimate  
end, whereas those who simply do good  
deeds will return to earth, although their  
good deeds will give them karmic benefits. See also **karma**.
