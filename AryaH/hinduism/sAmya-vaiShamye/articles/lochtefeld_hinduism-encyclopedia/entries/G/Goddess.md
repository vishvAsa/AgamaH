India is home to a host of different goddesses. Although goddesses differ greatly  
in demeanor and character, they are all  
generally seen as expressions of a single  
underlying female **deity**. This vision of  
the goddess coincides with the characteristic Hindu practice that allows for  
multiple manifestations of a divinity,  
while at the same time asserting his or  
her underlying reality as a single entity.  
Many of India’s goddesses are the deities  
of a specific site, who might be worshiped only in that specific place. Yet as  
these local goddesses are all mythically  
linked as differing forms of a single great  
Goddess, the sacred sites (**tirthas**) are  
also connected with this great Goddess.  
The sites, called **pithas** or “benches,”  
form a sacred network stretching  
throughout the entire subcontinent.  
The origins of the goddess cult  
in India are uncertain. Excavations of  
cities of the **Indus Valley civilization**  
have unearthed female figures with  
enormous breasts, hips, and buttocks.  
These figures resemble the Venus of  
Willendorf found in Bronze Age Europe  
and suggest that there was some kind of  
cult associated with **women’s** fertility.  
Some interpreters have seen the Indus  
Valley figures as proof that the cult of the  
Mother Goddess originated in the Indus  
Valley civilization, but hard evidence  
supporting this claim is slim. Another  
reason some interpreters believe that  
goddess **worship** must have come from  
the indigenous Indian culture is that the  
deities mentioned in the **Vedas**, the oldest Hindu religious texts, are almost  
exclusively male. The female goddesses  
in the Vedic hymns are infrequent and  
unimportant—**Ushas** (the dawn),  
**Prthivi** (the **earth**), and **Nirriti** (death  
and destruction). But somehow female  
divinities were elevated from virtual  
obscurity and became conceived as the  
reigning power in the universe.  
The cult of the great Goddess  
appears fully formed, seemingly out of  
nowhere, in about the fifth century. She  
first appears in the text known as the  
**Devimahatmya** (“greatness of the  
Goddess”), which is itself a section of the  
251  
Goddess  
A shrine in the Godavari River near the riverbank of Nasik.  
**Markandeya Purana**. The depth and  
subtlety of her characterization in this  
text leads scholars to infer that this  
cult had existed for some time, perhaps as a secret religious community  
open only to initiates. The goddess in the  
*Devimahatmya* is a powerful, independent female force and is able to do what  
the gods cannot. She is created from the  
collected radiance (tejas) of all the gods,  
and comes into the world to kill a  
demon against whom the gods have  
struggled in vain. The *Devimahatmya*’s  
three different episodes portray her in  
three different divine personas: as  
**Mahasaraswati** in the slaying of the  
**demons Madhu** and **Kaitabha**, as  
**Mahalakshmi** in slaying a demon  
named **Mahishasura**, and as **Mahakali**  
in the battle against the demon generals  
**Shumbha** and **Nishumbha**.  
Many of India’s goddesses are the  
patron deities of particular locales, and  
are considered unique to that place. The  
**Shiwalik goddesses**, for example, are  
unique to particular sites in the  
**Shiwalik hills**. At the same time, all of  
these goddesses are considered different  
manifestations of the same divine energy.  
According to the sites’ charter myth,  
each site is associated with a particular  
body part of the primeval goddess. The  
myth tells of the death of **Sati**, who commits **suicide** when her father **Daksha**  
insults her husband **Shiva**. Shiva picks  
up Sati’s body and wanders the earth,  
carrying her on his shoulders. In his  
grief Shiva neglects his divine duties,  
and the world begins to fall into ruin.  
The other gods beg **Vishnu** for help, lest  
the world be destroyed. Vishnu uses his  
razor-sharp discus to cut off pieces of  
Sati’s body, until finally there is nothing  
left. When the body is completely gone,  
Shiva goes to the mountains, where he  
becomes absorbed in meditation.  
Wherever a part of Sati’s body falls, that  
place becomes a **Shakti Pitha** (“seat of  
the Goddess”), sanctified to the Goddess  
in a particular form. The number of  
these places differs from source to  
source—some list fifty-one, and others  
\108. Whatever the number, the sites are  
spread throughout the subcontinent,  
from Baluchistan in modern Pakistan, to  
**Assam** in the far east, to deep in southern India. Each Shakti Pitha is associated  
with a particular body part of the great  
Goddess, has a particular presiding  
female deity, and has a particular  
**Bhairava** as a consort to that goddess.  
From this perspective, the entire subcontinent is seen as a single cohesive  
unit, with the network of sites connected to one another as are the parts of the  
body. Different places may claim the  
same body part, the result of the drive to  
establish a site and to give it prestige.  
For example, Sati’s vulva, the most powerfully charged part of the female body,  
is usually accepted to have fallen at  
**Kamakhya** in Assam, but the same  
claim is made at **Kalimath** in the  
**Himalayas**. There is no single authoritative list of sites and competing claims  
are not uncommon. Many Hindus seem  
unconcerned with the seeming inconsistency of having the same body parts  
claimed by different sites; perhaps this  
reflects the conviction that the Goddess  
is behind them all, and that the specifics  
are therefore less important.  
While some goddesses are only worshiped in their particular locale, such as  
the goddesses found in the Shiwalik  
hills, other goddesses have become  
more widely worshiped, and some have  
become pan-Indian. In the pantheon,  
the Goddess generally appears in two  
widely differing types of manifestations.  
At times she appears as a wife and mother,  
in forms such as **Parvati**, **Lakshmi**, and  
**Saraswati**. Although these married  
goddesses are not completely powerless,  
they tend to be benign, benevolent,  
and auspicious. Her other manifestation  
is in forms such as **Durga** and **Kali**,  
whose male consorts are considered  
subordinate to them. These independent manifestations of the Goddess  
have the power to help their devotees  
(**bhakta**), but they are also volatile and  
potentially dangerous, since their power  
is sometimes unleashed without control. Cultural observers have suggested  
that this dual perspective represents  
252  
Goddess  
cultural perspectives on Indian women,  
particularly the belief that women’s  
procreative capacities should be  
channeled through the safe, confining  
bounds of marriage. Married women,  
as wives and mothers, are auspicious,  
life-giving, and life-sustaining because  
their creative power has been regulated under male control. Unmarried  
women remain a source of danger,  
particularly to the family’s prestige,  
since the quickest way to ruin a family’s  
good name is through the corruption of  
its women.
