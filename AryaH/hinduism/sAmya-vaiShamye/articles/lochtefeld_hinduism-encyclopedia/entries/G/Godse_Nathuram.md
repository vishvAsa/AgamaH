title = "Godse, Nathuram"

+++
(1912–1948) Hindu nationalist figure  
who is most famous as the assassin of  
**Mohandas Gandhi**. Godse was a devoted  
follower of **Vinayak Damodar Savarkar**,  
whose articulation of Hindu nationalism equated Hindu identity and Indian  
patriotism. Savarkar and his followers  
saw the partition of India in 1947 as the  
“vivisection” of Mother India, dividing  
her into India and Pakistan. Like many  
of Savarkar’s followers, Godse was  
enraged by Gandhi’s post-partition  
efforts to protect Indian Muslims and to  
influence the Indian government’s policy  
toward Pakistan, particularly his hunger  
strike to force the Indian government to  
transfer to Pakistan a large sum of  
money that had been promised. Filled  
with the conviction that Gandhi had to  
be stopped, Godse intercepted Gandhi  
on the way to a prayer meeting, touched  
his feet as a sign of respect, and then  
shot him three times. Godse was tried  
and executed for his action and is sometimes cited as a martyr by the most  
ardent contemporary nationalists.
