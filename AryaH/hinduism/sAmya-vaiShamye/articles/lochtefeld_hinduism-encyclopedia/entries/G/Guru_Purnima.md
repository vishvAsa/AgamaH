title = "Guru Purnima"

+++
Religious holiday falling on the **full**  
**moon** (**purnima**) in the **lunar month** of  
**Ashadh** (June–July). Guru Purnima is a  
day of respect and reverence to one’s  
**guru**, a word that has historically indicated a religious preceptor, but is used  
now for any teacher, adviser, or mentor.  
In the **dharma literature**, a young man  
is to spend his adolescence as a member  
of his guru’s household, receiving room,  
board, and instruction. In return he renders to his guru obedience and loyalty.  
On Guru Purnima, a guru’s students are  
directed to enshrine and **worship** their  
guru as a **deity**, giving their guru gifts  
and fees, according to their means.  
Modern Hindus celebrate this day in  
various ways, depending on the type of  
guru they have. Although some religious  
preceptors are enshrined and worshiped, this practice is not always performed. However, modern Hindus still  
celebrate this day by paying particular  
honor and homage to their teachers.  
This day falls on the full moon, which is  
associated with completion and perfection—the same qualities that gurus are  
considered to have. This day is also  
known as **Vyas** Purnima, since the sage  
**Vyasa** was renowned as a great guru.
