title = "Guha"

+++
In the **Ramayana**, the earlier of the  
two great Indian epics, Guha is the  
king of the Nishadas, a tribe who lived  
on the banks of the **Ganges** River.  
When the god **Rama** goes into exile  
with his wife **Sita** and his younger  
brother **Lakshmana**, they pass  
through Guhaâ€™s kingdom. Guha  
arranges for a boat to take them to the  
other side of the Ganges and personally conveys the three over to the other  
side. Although Guha is of very low  
social status, his humble services are  
accepted because of his sincere devotion to Rama. In the *Ramayana* of  
**Tulsidas**, a later vernacular rendition  
of the *Ramayana* that emphasizes the  
power of devotion, Guha symbolizes  
how sincere devotion can transcend  
all social boundaries.
