title = "Goa"

+++
One of the smallest states in modern  
India. It lies between the states of  
**Maharashtra** and **Karnataka** on the  
shore of the Arabian Sea. Goa was a  
Portuguese colony for more than 400  
years and did not become a part of the  
Indian union until 1961, when India  
engineered a nearly bloodless takeover.  
Goa still retains much of its Portuguese  
influence—in its food, easygoing pace,  
and the continuing presence of Roman  
Catholicism—which makes it one of the  
most unusual cultural areas in India. For  
general information about Goa and all  
the regions of India, an accessible reference is Christine Nivin et al., *India*. 8th
