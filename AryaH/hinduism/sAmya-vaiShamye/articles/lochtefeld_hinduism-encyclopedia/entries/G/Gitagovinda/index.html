  <meta property="og:description" content="(“Govinda’s Song”) Lyric poem written
in the twelfth century by the poet
Jayadeva. Written in an era when vernacular languages were becoming the
prevalent vehicle for devotional religiosity, the Gitagovinda is one of the last
great devotional (bhakti) texts composed in Sanskrit and is an exquisite
example of Sanskrit poetry. According to
tradition, Jayadeva was associated with
the temple to Jagannath in the eastern
Indian city of Puri, and his wife
Padmavati was a dancer at the same
temple. The Gitagovinda is a devotional
poem to the god Jagannath. The text was
obviously meant to be sung, since its
twenty-four cantos are set in various differing musical modes (ragas), each of
which conveys a different emotion. The
text has also been expressed through
dance for at least 500 years in the Orissi
dance style that originated in the
Jagannath temple. The Gitagovinda is
still used in the daily worship of
Jagannath and occupies a position held
by no other literary text.
The Gitagovinda is an allegory of
the union of the human soul with God.
This union is described through the
story of the love between the god
Krishna and his human consort Radha
as they experience an initial flush of
passion, followed by jealousy, separation, reconciliation, and reunion.
Although Jayadeva’s text lavishly
employs the images from Sanskrit love
poetry, it is far more than a romantic
novel. The poem was written to show
that Krishna is the lord of the entire universe. The first cantos after the introduction, the Dashavatara Stotra, pay
homage to Krishna in his ten avatars or
earthly incarnations (Dashavatar), each
of whom is instrumental in preserving
the cosmic equilibrium. Although
Krishna is considered an avatar of the
god Vishnu in many parts of the Hindu
tradition, Krishna is the supreme deity
for Jayadeva. The place usually occupied
by Krishna in the enumeration of the
avatars is taken by Krishna’s brother,
Balarama. The song that follows continues this theme, giving the divine attributes of Krishna as Vishnu, and further
emphasizing that the entire Gitagovinda
describes the deity’s divine play (lila).
Having set the appropriate context in
the opening songs, Jayadeva’s text
returns to a more conventional tale of
romantic love. The next chapter
describes the symbols of spring, which
are intended to evoke a mood of love. Yet
this mood is marred by Radha’s jealousy
when Krishna sports with a troop of
cowherd girls, for she desires Krishna for
herself alone. She withdraws and sits
apart, sulking and despondent, only to
burst into rage when Krishna comes to
meet her, bearing the signs of another
erotic liaison. Her anger and dismissal
make Krishna realize what he has done.
He eventually succeeds in dispersing
her anger, and convinces Radha of his
249
Gitagovinda
love. They reconcile and make passionate love. The text ends by describing
their love play in the afterglow, in which
Radha orders Krishna to ornament her
as she wishes, showing her complete
power over him.
As a text, the Gitagovinda can be read
on many different levels simultaneously.
The themes of love, betrayal, and reconciliation speak easily to everyday human
experience, but the theological and
mystical levels are always present. In the
end, deity and devotee (bhakta) are
described as needing and loving
one another. Neither is complete without the other. Radha’s demand for exclusive love is at first denied, but in the end
her persistence and conviction are
rewarded. The Gitagovinda has been
masterfully translated by the late
Barbara Stoller Miller as The Love Song
of the Dark Lord, 1977.">

  <p>(“Govinda’s Song”) Lyric poem written<br>
in the twelfth century by the poet<br>
<strong>Jayadeva</strong>. Written in an era when vernacular languages were becoming the<br>
prevalent vehicle for devotional religiosity, the <em>Gitagovinda</em> is one of the last<br>
great devotional (<strong>bhakti</strong>) texts composed in <strong>Sanskrit</strong> and is an exquisite<br>
example of Sanskrit poetry. According to<br>
tradition, Jayadeva was associated with<br>
the temple to <strong>Jagannath</strong> in the eastern<br>
Indian city of <strong>Puri</strong>, and his wife<br>
Padmavati was a dancer at the same<br>
temple. The <em>Gitagovinda</em> is a devotional<br>
poem to the god Jagannath. The text was<br>
obviously meant to be sung, since its<br>
twenty-four cantos are set in various differing musical modes (<strong>ragas</strong>), each of<br>
which conveys a different emotion. The<br>
text has also been expressed through<br>
<strong>dance</strong> for at least 500 years in the <strong>Orissi</strong><br>
dance style that originated in the<br>
Jagannath temple. The <em>Gitagovinda</em> is<br>
still used in the daily <strong>worship</strong> of<br>
Jagannath and occupies a position held<br>
by no other literary text.<br>
The <em>Gitagovinda</em> is an allegory of<br>
the union of the human soul with God.<br>
This union is described through the<br>
story of the love between the god<br>
<strong>Krishna</strong> and his human consort <strong>Radha</strong><br>
as they experience an initial flush of<br>
passion, followed by jealousy, separation, reconciliation, and reunion.<br>
Although Jayadeva’s text lavishly<br>
employs the images from Sanskrit love<br>
poetry, it is far more than a romantic<br>
novel. The poem was written to show<br>
that Krishna is the lord of the entire universe. The first cantos after the introduction, the <strong>Dashavatara Stotra</strong>, pay<br>
homage to Krishna in his ten avatars or<br>
earthly incarnations (<strong>Dashavatar</strong>), each<br>
of whom is instrumental in preserving<br>
the cosmic equilibrium. Although<br>
Krishna is considered an <strong>avatar</strong> of the<br>
god <strong>Vishnu</strong> in many parts of the Hindu<br>
tradition, Krishna is the supreme <strong>deity</strong><br>
for Jayadeva. The place usually occupied<br>
by Krishna in the enumeration of the<br>
avatars is taken by Krishna’s brother,<br>
<strong>Balarama</strong>. The song that follows continues this theme, giving the divine attributes of Krishna as Vishnu, and further<br>
emphasizing that the entire <em>Gitagovinda</em><br>
describes the deity’s divine play (<strong>lila</strong>).<br>
Having set the appropriate context in<br>
the opening songs, Jayadeva’s text<br>
returns to a more conventional tale of<br>
romantic love. The next chapter<br>
describes the symbols of spring, which<br>
are intended to evoke a mood of love. Yet<br>
this mood is marred by Radha’s jealousy<br>
when Krishna sports with a troop of<br>
cowherd girls, for she desires Krishna for<br>
herself alone. She withdraws and sits<br>
apart, sulking and despondent, only to<br>
burst into rage when Krishna comes to<br>
meet her, bearing the signs of another<br>
<strong>erotic</strong> liaison. Her anger and dismissal<br>
make Krishna realize what he has done.<br>
He eventually succeeds in dispersing<br>
her anger, and convinces Radha of his<br>
249<br>
Gitagovinda<br>
love. They reconcile and make passionate love. The text ends by describing<br>
their love play in the afterglow, in which<br>
Radha orders Krishna to ornament her<br>
as she wishes, showing her complete<br>
power over him.<br>
As a text, the <em>Gitagovinda</em> can be read<br>
on many different levels simultaneously.<br>
The themes of love, betrayal, and reconciliation speak easily to everyday human<br>
experience, but the theological and<br>
mystical levels are always present. In the<br>
end, deity and devotee (<strong>bhakta</strong>) are<br>
described as needing and loving<br>
one another. Neither is complete without the other. Radha’s demand for exclusive love is at first denied, but in the end<br>
her persistence and conviction are<br>
rewarded. The <em>Gitagovinda</em> has been<br>
masterfully translated by the late<br>
Barbara Stoller Miller as <em>The Love Song</em><br>
<em>of the Dark Lord</em>, 1977.</p>
