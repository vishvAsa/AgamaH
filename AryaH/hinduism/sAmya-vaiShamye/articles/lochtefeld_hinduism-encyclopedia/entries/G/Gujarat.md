title = "Gujarat"

+++
Modern Indian state, located on the  
Arabian Sea at the border with  
Pakistan. Gujarat is one of the socalled linguistic states formed after  
Indian independence to unite government people with a common language and culture (in this case,  
**Gujarati**). It was formed in 1960 by  
splitting what was Bombay into the  
present states of Gujarat and  
**Maharashtra**. Gujarat’s presence by  
the sea has given the area a long history as a trading center, beginning as  
the port of **Lothal** in the **Indus Valley**  
**civilization**, one of the earliest, highly  
developed urban cultures.  
Most of the Indians who migrated  
to Kenya, Uganda, and other parts of  
East Africa are Gujaratis; substantial  
numbers of Gujaratis have migrated to  
the United Kingdom and the United  
States, especially New York City.  
Gujarat is also famous as the birthplace of **Mohandas Gandhi**. The  
**Sabarmati Ashram** near the city of  
Ahmedabad in Gujarat was his home  
base during much of the struggle for  
independence. Gujarat is also famous  
for several prominent holy places:

Gujarat  
**Dwaraka**, which is the site of  
**Krishna’s** mythical kingdom, as well as  
the location of the **Sharada math** of  
the **Dashanami Sanyasis** religious  
community; **Somnath**, which is one of  
the twelve sites where **Shiva**,  
in his first manifestation as the  
**jyotirlinga**, came to **earth**; and  
**Girnar**, which is famous as a dwellingplace for **ascetics**. For general  
information about Gujarat and all  
the regions of India, an accessible
