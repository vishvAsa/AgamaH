title = "Gandhi, Mohandas K"

+++
(1869–1948) Leader of the Indian  
National Congress, one of the architects  
of the struggle for Indian independence,  
and one of the best-known Indians in  
history. Gandhi was born in **Gujarat**,  
where his father was a minister to one of  
the native princes. Shortly after Gandhi’s  
father died, the British ousted the ruling  
prince for mismanagement, and the  
family lost their position. Gandhi was  
sent to London to study law, and during  
this time he came into contact with a  
variety of new ideas that would strongly  
influence his future. Ironically, one of  
these influences was the **Bhagavad Gita**,  
an important Hindu religious text from  
which he drew continuing inspiration in  
his later life. After returning to India in  
1891, Gandhi failed in his attempt to set  
up a law practice in Bombay, and he  
went back to Gujarat. In 1894 Gandhi  
traveled to **South Africa** to do some  
work for a Muslim trading firm. He  
intended to be gone only a short time,  
but ended up staying in South Africa for  
twenty years. During this time he discovered his true calling, political  
activism. This was sparked by his own  
experience of racial discrimination—  
being thrown out of a railway car  
reserved for “whites only”—and was  
fueled by the social, political, and legal  
disadvantages suffered by South Africa’s  
40,000 Indians, most of whom were illiterate agricultural workers. During his  
time in South Africa, Gandhi developed  
and refined his basic tactics: mass noncooperation, nonviolent resistance, willingness to face imprisonment, and  
skillful use of the print media to influence public opinion. In 1914 he  
returned to India, where he soon  
became one of the leading figures in the  
struggle against the British—first for  
home rule, and finally for outright independence.  
Gandhi’s deeply held moral principles shaped his entire career. He saw his  
political activism not as a vehicle for  
personal advancement, but as a means  
for selfless action for the welfare of the  
world. This stress on selfless action drew  
heavily on the message of the Bhagavad  
Gita, in which the god **Krishna** recommends a similar path to his friend and  
devotee (**bhakta**), **Arjuna**. Throughout  
his life Gandhi remained committed to  
nonviolence. Gandhi felt strongly that  
the nature of any goal would be influenced by the means by which it had  
been attained. Another of his fundamental principles was truth, as seen in  
his insistence that evil and injustice had  
to be resisted, even by violence when all  
other means had failed. A third essential  
tenet was self-control, which he considered the prerequisite to leading others.  
His commitment to his principles gave  
him the strength to endure imprisonment, injury, and more than thirty years  
of struggle with the British government;  
it also moved him to campaign against  
many other injustices, particularly the  
notion of untouchability.  
When independence finally arrived  
in 1947 it was tainted by the partition of  
British India into India and Pakistan,  
fueled in part by Muslim concerns about  
their **minority** status in an independent  
Hindu India. The partition sparked a  
massive exodus, in which fifteen million  
people migrated from one country to  
the other. It also sparked unspeakable  
communal violence, in which an estimated one million people died. Despite  
his best efforts, Gandhi was unable to  
prevent partition or to create good relations between the two countries. Within  
six months of independence, Gandhi  
was assassinated by **Nathuram Godse**, a  
Hindu nationalist who felt that Gandhi  
was being too soft on Pakistan.  
Gandhi had critics and opponents  
throughout his career, many of whom  
felt that he did not deserve the sainthood that people attributed to him.

Among his critics were **B. R. Ambedkar**,  
who felt that Gandhi had used the  
untouchables as pawns in negotiations  
with the British because he opposed  
letting the untouchables separate from  
the larger body politic. His critics also  
included **Subhash Chandra Bose**, who  
advocated an armed struggle against  
the British, and **Vinayak Damodar**  
**Savarkar**, a Hindu nationalist who was  
Godse’s inspiration. For further information see Mohandas K. Gandhi, *An*
