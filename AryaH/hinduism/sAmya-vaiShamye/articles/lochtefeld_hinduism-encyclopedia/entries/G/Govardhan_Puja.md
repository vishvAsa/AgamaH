Festival celebrated on the first **day** of the  
bright (waxing) half of the **lunar month** of  
**Kartik** (October–November), the day after  
the festival **Diwali**. The charter myth for  
this festival comes from the mythology of  
the god **Krishna**, and this festival is celebrated mainly in the **Braj** region south of  
modern Delhi, where Krishna is said to  
have lived. According to legend, this is the  
day that Krishna lifted up Mount  
**Govardhan** to protect the people of Braj  
from the storms sent by the god **Indra**.  
Indra was angry because Krishna had persuaded the village elders to make **offerings**  
to Mount Govardhan, rather than to Indra.  
Krishna held up the mountain as an  
umbrella for an entire **week**, after which  
Indra admitted defeat. On this day pilgrims  
circle Mount Govardhan on foot. The  
mountain is seen as a physical manifestation of Krishna himself, and because of  
Krishna’s association with cattle, they also  
adorn and **worship cows** and **bulls**. In  
memory of the offerings given to Mount  
Govardhan in that story, as well as the  
mountain of offerings (particularly milkbased sweets) that are prepared for celebration in modern times, the festival is also  
known as **Annakut** (“mountain of food”).
