title = "Gupta Dynasty"

+++
(ca. 350–550) Northern Indian dynasty  
whose ancestral homeland was in the  
lower **Ganges** River basin. The Gupta capital was initially at **Pataliputra**, identified  
with the city of Patna in the modern state  
of **Bihar**, but was later moved to the city  
of **Allahabad**, which lies at the confluence of the Ganges and **Yamuna** rivers.  
At its zenith under **Chandra Gupta II**,  
the Guptas controlled all of northern  
India and modern Pakistan, as well as  
the eastern **Coromandel** Coast all the  
way south to modern Madras. The  
Gupta reign is associated with an efflorescence of Indian culture, and with the  
revival of Hinduism in northern India.  
The force behind both of these trends  
was the royal patronage of the Gupta  
kings. According to tradition, one of  
their court poets was **Kalidasa**, who is  
considered the greatest **Sanskrit** poet.  
The Guptas are also characterized as  
ardent devotees (**bhakta**) of the god  
**Shiva**, a devotion they displayed  
through temple building and religious  
endowments. Aside from Chandra  
Gupta II, the dynasty’s most famous  
rulers were his father **Samudra Gupta**  
and his grandfather **Chandra Gupta I**.
