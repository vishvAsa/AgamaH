title = "Gaurikund"

+++
Village and sacred site (**tirtha**) in the  
**Himalaya** Mountains of the state of  
**Uttar Pradesh**. Gaurikund is located  
about ten miles downstream from the  
headwaters of the **Mandakini** River,  
which is itself one of the Himalayan tributaries of the **Ganges**. Gaurikund is the  
end of the motorable road on the way to  
**Kedarnath**, and after this pilgrims  
must travel on foot. Gaurikund’s mythic charter is connected with the god  
**Shiva** and his wife **Parvati**. Parvati is  
said to have performed harsh **asceticism** at Gaurikund in order to gain  
Shiva as her husband; after a long time  
Shiva is pleased with Parvati, reveals  
himself to her, and the two become  
lovers in that place. According to local  
geography, the place at which Parvati  
lived during this time is marked by a  
group of hot springs, which are another  
of Gaurikund’s attractions.
