title = "Gandhari"

+++
A character in the **Mahabharata**, the  
later of the two great Hindu epics.  
Gandhari is the wife of the blind king  
**Dhrtarashtra** and the mother of the  
**Kauravas**, a group of boys who are the  
epic’s antagonists. Gandhari shows her  
devotion to her blind husband by always  
covering her eyes with a blindfold, thus  
sharing his sightlessness. As is often the  
case in Hindu mythology, her **sons** are  
born in an unusual manner. Gandhari  
receives a blessing (**ashirvad**) from the  
sage **Vyasa** that she will give **birth** to one  
hundred sons. Soon after, she becomes  
pregnant. However, her pregnancy lasts  
for more than two years. When she  
grows impatient and tries to hasten the  
delivery, she gives birth to a great lump  
of flesh. Vyasa advises Gandhari to  
divide the lump and place each piece in  
a pot of clarified butter (ghee).  
Eventually the pots break open, revealing one hundred handsome boys and a  
single **daughter**, Dussala.  
All of Gandhari’s children are killed  
by her nephews the Pandavas in the  
Mahabharata war. Just as Gandhari is  
about to **curse** the Pandavas, Vyasa  
reminds her that her sons’ deaths are  
the result of their own misconduct. After  
the war, Gandhari retires to the forest  
with her husband and a few others. They  
live in retirement for six years before  
they are killed in a forest **fire**.
