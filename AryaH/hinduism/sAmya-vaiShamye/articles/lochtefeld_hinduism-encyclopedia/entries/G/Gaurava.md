(“[needless] complexity”) In Indian  
logic, one of the faults to be avoided in  
constructing and pursuing an argument. According to the principle of  
“simplicity” (**laghava**), when one is presented with two equally plausible theories, one should choose the theory that  
is easier to understand and makes the  
fewest assumptions. The primary criterion in evaluating any argument is the  
validity of the argument itself, and it is  
only after this has been satisfied that  
one may raise objections based on complexity or simplicity.
