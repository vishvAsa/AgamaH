title = "Grammarians"

+++
Philosophical school based in the  
teachings of **Bhartrhari** (7th c. C.E.). The  
Grammarians conceived of **Brahman**, the  
Ultimate Reality, as being manifested in  
sound, particularly the sound of the spoken word. They centered their cult around  
the word **Om**, a word that is described as  
the source of all things in the **Mandukya**  
**Upanishad**, an early speculative text. For  
further information see Harold Coward  
and K. Kunjunni Raja (eds.), *The*  
*Philosophy of the Grammarians,* 1990.
