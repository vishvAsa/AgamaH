(“Govinda’s Song”) Lyric poem written  
in the twelfth century by the poet  
**Jayadeva**. Written in an era when vernacular languages were becoming the  
prevalent vehicle for devotional religiosity, the *Gitagovinda* is one of the last  
great devotional (**bhakti**) texts composed in **Sanskrit** and is an exquisite  
example of Sanskrit poetry. According to  
tradition, Jayadeva was associated with  
the temple to **Jagannath** in the eastern  
Indian city of **Puri**, and his wife  
Padmavati was a dancer at the same  
temple. The *Gitagovinda* is a devotional  
poem to the god Jagannath. The text was  
obviously meant to be sung, since its  
twenty-four cantos are set in various differing musical modes (**ragas**), each of  
which conveys a different emotion. The  
text has also been expressed through  
**dance** for at least 500 years in the **Orissi**  
dance style that originated in the  
Jagannath temple. The *Gitagovinda* is  
still used in the daily **worship** of  
Jagannath and occupies a position held  
by no other literary text.  
The *Gitagovinda* is an allegory of  
the union of the human soul with God.  
This union is described through the  
story of the love between the god  
**Krishna** and his human consort **Radha**  
as they experience an initial flush of  
passion, followed by jealousy, separation, reconciliation, and reunion.  
Although Jayadeva’s text lavishly  
employs the images from Sanskrit love  
poetry, it is far more than a romantic  
novel. The poem was written to show  
that Krishna is the lord of the entire universe. The first cantos after the introduction, the **Dashavatara Stotra**, pay  
homage to Krishna in his ten avatars or  
earthly incarnations (**Dashavatar**), each  
of whom is instrumental in preserving  
the cosmic equilibrium. Although  
Krishna is considered an **avatar** of the  
god **Vishnu** in many parts of the Hindu  
tradition, Krishna is the supreme **deity**  
for Jayadeva. The place usually occupied  
by Krishna in the enumeration of the  
avatars is taken by Krishna’s brother,  
**Balarama**. The song that follows continues this theme, giving the divine attributes of Krishna as Vishnu, and further  
emphasizing that the entire *Gitagovinda*  
describes the deity’s divine play (**lila**).  
Having set the appropriate context in  
the opening songs, Jayadeva’s text  
returns to a more conventional tale of  
romantic love. The next chapter  
describes the symbols of spring, which  
are intended to evoke a mood of love. Yet  
this mood is marred by Radha’s jealousy  
when Krishna sports with a troop of  
cowherd girls, for she desires Krishna for  
herself alone. She withdraws and sits  
apart, sulking and despondent, only to  
burst into rage when Krishna comes to  
meet her, bearing the signs of another  
**erotic** liaison. Her anger and dismissal  
make Krishna realize what he has done.  
He eventually succeeds in dispersing  
her anger, and convinces Radha of his  
249  
Gitagovinda  
love. They reconcile and make passionate love. The text ends by describing  
their love play in the afterglow, in which  
Radha orders Krishna to ornament her  
as she wishes, showing her complete  
power over him.  
As a text, the *Gitagovinda* can be read  
on many different levels simultaneously.  
The themes of love, betrayal, and reconciliation speak easily to everyday human  
experience, but the theological and  
mystical levels are always present. In the  
end, deity and devotee (**bhakta**) are  
described as needing and loving  
one another. Neither is complete without the other. Radha’s demand for exclusive love is at first denied, but in the end  
her persistence and conviction are  
rewarded. The *Gitagovinda* has been  
masterfully translated by the late  
Barbara Stoller Miller as *The Love Song*  
*of the Dark Lord*, 1977.
