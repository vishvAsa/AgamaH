Sacred site (**tirtha**) and city in the modern state of **Bihar** and capital of a district by the same name. According to  
Hindu mythology, this is the place  
where the god **Vishnu** sacrifices a powerful **demon** named **Gayasura**, having  
promised the demon that the space covered by his body will be the holiest spot  
on **earth**. Gaya is best known as a site to  
perform various rites for the dead, particularly the memorial rites known as  
**shraddhas**. Its sanctity is so well known  
that it draws people from all over the  
eastern part of India.
