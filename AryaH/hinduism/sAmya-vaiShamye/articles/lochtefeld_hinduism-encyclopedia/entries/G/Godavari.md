title = "Godavari"

+++
River running from west to east in central India. The Godavari’s headwaters lie  
in the state of **Maharashtra** on the  
inland side of the western Ghats. It  
meanders through that state to **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**, where it enters the Bay of  
Bengal. The Godarvi is traditionally  
considered one of India’s seven sacred  
rivers, along with the **Ganges**, **Yamuna**,  
**Cauvery**, **Saraswati**, **Narmada**, and  
**Indus**. The Godavari has special status  
in central India, where it is often referred  
to as the “Ganges”—the most sacred  
river for Hindus. Although its entire  
length is considered sacred, the  
Godavari’s most important religious  
sites are all in the west: **Nasik**,  
250  
Goa  
**Tryambakeshvar**, and **Paithan**. See  
also **ghat**.
