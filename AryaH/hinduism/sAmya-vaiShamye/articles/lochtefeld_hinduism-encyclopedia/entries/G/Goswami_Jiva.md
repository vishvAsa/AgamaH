title = "Goswami, Jiva"

+++
(ca. late 16th c.) A pivotal figure in the  
**Gaudiya Vaishnava** religious community,  
along with his uncles **Sanatana Goswami**  
and **Rupa Goswami**. Although the  
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by the  
poet-saint **Chaitanya**, it was the  
Goswamis who brought order and systematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic devotionalism. The Goswamis were  
southern brahmins by origin, but their  
family had resettled in northern India.  
Their lives were transformed when  
Rupa and Sanatana met Chaitanya.  
Chaitanya dispatched the brothers to  
**Brindavan**, the village where the god  
**Krishna** is believed to have spent his  
childhood, with instructions to settle  
there and reclaim it as a holy place. The  
three Goswamis lived there for several  
decades, reclaiming the sacred sites  
(**tirthas**), having temples built, and  
above all providing the ideas and institutions that defined the Gaudiya  
Vaishnava community. Jiva was a versatile scholar who wrote on many different aspects of **Vaishnava** devotion,  
but is best known for his works on  
metaphysics, which provide the community’s basic philosophical underpinnings. For further information see
