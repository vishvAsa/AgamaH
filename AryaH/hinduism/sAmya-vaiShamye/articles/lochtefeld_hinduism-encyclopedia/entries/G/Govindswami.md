title = "Govindswami"

+++
(late 16th c.) One of the poets of the **ashtachap**, a group of eight northern Indian  
**bhakti** (devotional) poets. The compositions of these eight poets are used for  
liturgical purposes by the **Pushti Marg**, a  
religious community whose members  
are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Krishna**. The  
Pushti Marg named all eight poets as  
members of the community and associates of either the community’s founder,  
**Vallabhacharya**, or his successor  
**Vitthalnath**. Govindswami is believed to  
have been an associate of Vitthalnath. In  
his poetry, Govindswami writes from the  
perspective of a companion (**sakhi**) to  
Krishna’s consort **Radha**, and in this  
voice not only gives a picture of the  
divine activities, but also an extremely  
detailed picture of everyday village life.
