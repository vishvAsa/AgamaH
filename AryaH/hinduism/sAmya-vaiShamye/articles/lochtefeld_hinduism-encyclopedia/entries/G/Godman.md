title = "Godman"

+++
Colloquial name for a particular type of  
charismatic Hindu **ascetic**. As religious  
figures, godmen are generally characterized by a high-profile presence, by their  
ability to attract attention and support  
from the larger Indian society, and by  
their claims to advanced spiritual  
attainments. They sometimes claim to  
possess **magic** powers—such as the  
ability to heal, read minds, foretell the  
future, or to influence future events—  
which are exhibited to prove the godman’s spiritual attainments. Godmen  
often come from outside the established  
ascetic orders and may have never even  
taken formal ascetic **initiation**. They are  
able to flourish in the Indian religious  
“free market,” which recognizes and  
rewards religious charisma. Godmen  
typically dwell in their own **ashrams**  
rather than one belonging to an order.  
Although most of them acknowledge a  
**guru** or religious preceptor, their success stems more from their personal  
qualities than the strength of their spiritual lineage. In recent years a number of  
these godmen have cultivated large  
numbers of foreign disciples, which can  
bring both wealth and enhanced prestige. One contemporary example of  
such a godman is **Sathya Sai Baba**,  
whose ashram is in **Puttaparthi** in the  
southern state of **Andhra Pradesh**. For  
an example of one person’s encounters  
with a variety of these figures, see Peter  
Ludwig Brent, *Godmen of India*, 1972.
