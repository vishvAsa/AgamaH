title = "Gambling"

+++
A practice with a long history in Indian  
culture, but that has almost always been  
portrayed in a negative light by Hindu  
texts. The earliest reference appears in  
the **Rg Veda**, the oldest Hindu religious  
text, in a hymn often described as “The  
Gambler’s Lament.” The hymn is a gambler’s first-person account of the ways in  
which his obsession with gaming ruined  
his life. It ends with a warning to the listener not to be seduced by gambling’s  
siren song. Gambling is also negatively  
portrayed in the **Mahabharata**, the later  
of the two great Hindu epics. A passion  
for gaming is the only fault afflicting  
**Yudhishthira** (the eldest of the five  
**Pandava** brothers who are the epic’s  
protagonists), but it brings disastrous  
results. In a dice game with the kingdom’s most skillful player, **Shakuni**,  
Yudhishthira loses his kingdom, his  
brothers, and even himself; as a result of  
the game, he and his brothers have to go  
into exile.  
These mythic models mirror the  
attitudes toward gambling in Hindu  
society. Sober and upright Hindus have  
generally avoided games of chance,  
since they are not a stable or respectable  
way to risk one’s capital or earn a living.  
The only time that prudence and  
caution can be legitimately disregarded  
is on the festival of **Diwali**, which is  
sacred to **Lakshmi**, the **goddess** of  
wealth and prosperity. Gambling is a  
traditional part of the Diwali celebrations, used to pay homage to Lakshmi in  
her guise as Lady Luck. Diwali is most  
often celebrated in people’s homes, and  
thus any gambling will take place with  
one’s family and close associates, and  
with purely nominal betting. Aside from  
Diwali, gambling is strictly proscribed in  
polite society, and even on Diwali its disruptive capacities are strictly contained.
