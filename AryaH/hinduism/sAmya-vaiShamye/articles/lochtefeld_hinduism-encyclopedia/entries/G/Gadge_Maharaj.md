title = "Gadge Maharaj"

+++
(1876–1956) Modern **ascetic** teacher  
and religious preceptor in the **Varkari**  
**Panth**, a religious community centered  
around the **worship** of the Hindu god  
**Vithoba** at his temple at **Pandharpur** in  
the modern state of **Maharashtra**.  
Gadge Maharaj got his name from the  
clay pot (gadge) that was his only **possession**, signifying his rejection of all  
wealth and worldly entanglements.  
Gadge had been born into a **caste** of  
washermen, who are considered a low  
status group since their everyday work  
brings them in contact with other people’s soiled garments. In his teachings,  
Gadge not only stresses the importance  
of devotion to God—the hallmark of  
the **bhakti** (devotional) movement—  
but also advocates temperance, poverty,  
and **vegetarianism**.
