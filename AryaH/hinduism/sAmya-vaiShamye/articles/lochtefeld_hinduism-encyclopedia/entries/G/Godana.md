(“gift of a **cow**”) In Hindu religious practice, gift giving (**dana**) is common and  
believed to be a pious act that generates  
religious merit. Godana is the gift of a  
cow, usually to a **brahmin**. Traditional  
religious texts highly laud the gift of  
a cow, both as a charitable act and as  
a way to expiate one’s sins. However,  
since many of these texts were written  
by brahmins, one can detect a hint  
of self-interest.
