Historical site in the **Shiwalik hills**,  
the foothills of the Himalaya  
Mountains. In the eighteenth and  
nineteenth centuries these hills were  
the home to many small kingdoms,  
which served as important sites for the  
development of arts and culture. In  
Guler, the **Pahari** style of **miniature**  
**painting** first appeared in its developed form. The developed Pahari style  
differs from the earlier **Rajasthani**  
style in its emphasis on more linear  
drawing—perhaps influenced by

Gujarati  
Guler was the birthplace of the Pahari style of miniature painting.  
This Pahari painting depicts the god Rama killing a female demon.  
European art—and a more restrained  
use of color, both of which tend to give  
the paintings a more lyrical feel.
