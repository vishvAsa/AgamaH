title = "Gokhale, Gopal Krishna"

+++
(1866–1915) College professor, legislator, and reformist Hindu, who worked  
for much of his life with his older contemporary, **Mahadev Govind Ranade**.  
Unlike Ranade, whose position as a  
judge barred him from active political  
involvement, Gokhale spent the last fifteen years of his life as a legislator.  
Thirteen of these years were spent as  
Bombay’s Indian representative to the  
Imperial Legislative Council, the highest  
lawmaking body in India. Like Ranade,  
Gokhale sought to influence British policy by working within established institutions, in this case through the British  
colonial government. This willingness to  
compromise brought him opposition  
from leaders such as **Bal Gangadhar**  
**Tilak**, who advocated stiffer, even violent opposition to British rule.
