In Hindu mythology, the **goddess** whose  
material form is the **Ganges** River. The  
Ganges is sacred because the river is  
considered to be a goddess who has the  
power to take away the sins of those who  
bathe (**snana**) in her. There are numerous legends to explain her origin. The  
best-known is the tale of King **Bhagirath**,  
who by his **ascetic** practice succeeds in  
bringing the Ganges down from **heaven**  
to **earth**. Bhagirath is the great-greatgrandson of King **Sagar**, whose 60,000  
**sons** had been burned to ash by the sage  
**Kapila’s magic** power after they had  
erroneously accused Kapila of being a  
thief. Kapila later tells **Anshuman**, King  
Sagar’s grandson and sole surviving  
descendant, that the only way to bring  
peace to the souls of Sagar’s sons is to  
bring the Ganges down from heaven to  
earth. Anshuman strives unsuccessfully  
to do this, as does his son **Dilip** after  
him. Dilip’s son Bhagirath takes their  
efforts to heart and retires to the  
**Himalayas**, where he performs **asceticism** until the gods finally agree to send  
the Ganges down to earth. Yet  
Bhagiratha’s efforts are not yet over.  
Next, he has to gain the favor of the god  
**Shiva**, so that Shiva will agree to take the  
shock of the falling river on his head.  
Otherwise, its force will destroy the  
earth. When all is finally in place, the  
Ganges falls to earth onto the head of  
Shiva. Bhagirath leads Ganga out of the  
mountains to the sea, where she touches  
his ancestors’ ashes and they finally find  
peace. This myth highlights both the  
salvific touch of the Ganga and her intimate association with the last rites  
(**antyeshthi samskara**) for the dead.  
According to another story, the  
Ganges comes down to earth because of  
a curse pronounced during a family  
quarrel between **Vishnu** and his wives  
Ganga, **Lakshmi**, and **Saraswati**. When  
one day Ganga and Vishnu begin  
exchanging lustful glances in public,  
Saraswati gets angry and begins to beat  
Ganga. As Lakshmi tries to stop her,  
Saraswati let loose a string of **curses**:  
that Vishnu will be born as a stone (the  
**shalagram**), that Lakshmi will be born  
as a plant (the **tulsi** plant), and that  
Ganga will be born as a river and take  
the sins of the world on her. In the struggle, Saraswati is cursed to become a  
river. Vishnu sweetens Ganga’s curse by  
telling her that she will be considered  
very holy on earth and have the power to  
remove people’s sins. Vishnu also tells  
her that she will fall from heaven onto  
the head of the god **Shiva** and become  
his consort.
