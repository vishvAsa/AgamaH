(1267–1397?) Poet and saint in the  
**Varkari Panth**, a religious community  
centered around the **worship** of the  
Hindu god **Vithoba** at his temple at  
**Pandharpur** in modern state of  
**Maharashtra**. According to tradition,  
Gora was a potter, which by the standards of the time was a very low-status  
occupation; Gora’s inclusion as one of  
the Varkari saints helps underscore the

devotional (**bhakti**) conviction that  
**birth** status was less important than  
genuine love of God. Gora is reported to  
have lived most of his life at Teradhoki  
village in the state of Maharashtra, but  
since he is a minor Varkari figure, little is  
known about his life. For further information see G. A. Deleury, *The Cult of*
