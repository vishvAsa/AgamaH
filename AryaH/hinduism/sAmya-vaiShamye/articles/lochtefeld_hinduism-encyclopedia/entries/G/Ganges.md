Northern Indian river that has its source  
in various small rivers in the Himalaya  
Mountains. It comes onto the northern  
Indian plain at the city of **Haridwar**,  
flows east across the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh** to the city of **Allahabad**, where  
it unites with the **Yamuna River**, and  
then flows east through the states of  
**Bihar** and **West Bengal** before joining  
the sea at **Ganga Sagar**. At 1,560 miles in  
length, the Ganges is shorter than many  
other major rivers, but for Hindus no  
river carries greater religious significance. To pious Hindus the Ganges is  
not merely a river, but the **goddess**  
**Ganga** come down from **heaven**, and by  
whose touch they are purified of all sin  
and defilement. For the Ganges no  
superlatives are spared—every drop is  
sacred, every inch along its banks is

Ganges  
Street fair in Ganga Sagar.  
holy, and one gains great religious merit  
by seeing it, drinking from it, touching  
it, or merely by thinking about it. It is  
also considered the best place to perform certain rites for the dead.  
Hindu devotion to and reverence for  
the Ganges has established it as a place  
of unique importance. The religious  
importance of the Ganges is reflected in  
the religious practices connected with it  
and the many well-known pilgrimage  
places (**tirtha**) that are found on its  
banks, particularly the city of **Benares**.  
The Ganges is considered the paradigm  
for the sacred river. Other Indian sacred  
rivers, such as the **Godavari** and the  
**Cauvery**, are claimed to “be” the  
Ganges—that is, one can gain the  
same religious benefits from bathing  
(**snana**) in them that one gains by  
bathing in the Ganges.
