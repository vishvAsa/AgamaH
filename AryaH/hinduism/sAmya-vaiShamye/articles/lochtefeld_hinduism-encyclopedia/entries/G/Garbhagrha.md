title = "Garbhagrha"

+++
(“womb-house”) In traditional Hindu  
**architecture**, the garbhagrha is the  
inner sanctum of a temple, which contains the image of the temple’s primary  
**deity**. In the **Nagara** architectural style  
found in northern and eastern India—in  
which the whole temple building culminates in one highest point—the garbhagrha was located directly below the  
summit of the highest tower (**shikhara**).  
In the **Dravida** style found in southern  
India—in which the temples are shorter,  
but tend to sprawl over vast areas—the  
garbhagrha’s location is marked by a  
tower higher than the rest of the roof.
