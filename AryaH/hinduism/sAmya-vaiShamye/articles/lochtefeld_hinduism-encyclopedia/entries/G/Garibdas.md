title = "Garibdas"

+++
(early 18th c.) Founder of the **Garibdasi**  
religious community. Garibdas was born  
in the Rohtak district in what is now the  
state of **Haryana**. Garibdas did not have  
a human **guru**. Instead, he claimed to  
have received his religious **initiation**  
from the poet-saint **Kabir**, who  
appeared to him in a **dream**. Garibdas  
was a householder, as were his immediate disciples. Under one of their later  
leaders the Garibdasis renounced their  
**possessions** and became an **ascetic**  
community. Garibdas preached and  
taught on a number of subjects and was  
a well-respected and influential religious reformer.
