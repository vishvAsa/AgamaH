Sacred mountain in the western part  
of the **Mathura** district of the state of  
**Uttar Pradesh**. According to Hindu  
mythology, this was the mountain  
that the god **Krishna** held up as  
an umbrella over the **Braj** region to  
protect its inhabitants from the storms  
generated by the wrath of **Indra**, god  
of the storm. According to the traditions of the **Pushti Marg**, a religious  
community founded by **Vallabhacharya**  
(1479â€“1531), a particular image of  
Krishna called **Shrinathji** was discovered by Vallabhacharya on Mount  
Govardhan, after Krishna revealed its  
location to the saint in a **dream**.
