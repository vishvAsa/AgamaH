title = "Govardhan Math"

+++
One of the four **maths** or sacred centers  
traditionally believed to have been established by the great philosopher **Shankaracharya**; the others are the **Sharada**  
**math**, **Shringeri math**, and **Jyotir math**.  
These four sacred centers are each associated with one of the four geographical corners of the Indian subcontinent; the  
Govardhan math is in the eastern quarter,  
in the city of **Puri** on the shores of the Bay  
of Bengal. Shankaracharya is traditionally  
cited as the founder of the **Dashanami**  
**Sanyasis**, the most prestigious Hindu  
**ascetic** order. The Dashanami (“ten  
names”) ascetics are devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Shiva** and are divided into ten divisions, each with a different name. These  
ten divisions are organized into four larger  
organizational groups—**Anandawara**,  
**Bhogawara**, **Bhuriwara**, and **Kitawara**—  
each of which has two or three of the ten  
divisions and is associated with one of the  
four sacred centers. Of these, the  
Govardhan math is associated with the  
Bhogawara group.
