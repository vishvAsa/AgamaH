title = "Garibdasi"

+++
Religious community founded by  
the religious reformer **Garibdas** (early  
18th c.). The Garibdasi community  
was originally made up of householders, but was fundamentally altered by  
one of the later leaders, Swami  
Dayaludasa. Under his direction, the  
community renounced their **possessions** and became an **ascetic** sect. The  
Garibdasis have more than one hundred centers in northern India, mainly  
concentrated in the regions of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh** and **Haryana** around present-day New Delhi, where Garibdas  
lived during his life.
