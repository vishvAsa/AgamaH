title = "Ghatotkacha"

+++
In the **Mahabharata**, the later of the  
two great Hindu epics, Ghatotkacha is  
a **son** of **Bhima**, one of the five  
**Pandava** brothers who are the epic’s  
protagonists. Ghatotkacha’s mother is  
a **rakshasi** (female **demon**) named  
Hidambi; Bhima’s carnal relations with  
a nonhuman being are one sign of his  
earthy and unsophisticated personality. As the offspring of a rakshasi and  
the strongest Pandava, Ghatotkacha is  
a massive physical specimen. He is a  
staunch ally to the Pandavas all his life  
and fights valiantly on their behalf during the war between the Pandavas and  
their cousins the **Kauravas**, destroying  
large parts of the Kaurava army. He  
fights several times with the hero  
**Karna**, but is finally killed when Karna  
uses a **magic** weapon known as  
**Vaijayanti Shakti**.
