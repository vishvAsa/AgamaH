(“householder”) In the **dharma literature**, which gives instruction on religious practice and duties, a grhastha is  
a “householder.” According to the  
dharma literature, the grhastha is the  
second of the four **stages of life**  
(ashramas) in the life of a man born  
into one of the three **twice-born**  
groups—**brahmin**, **kshatriya**, or  
**vaishya**—which have the highest religious and social status in Indian society. The householder stage is preceded  
by that of the **brahmacharin** or celibate student, and succeeded by the  
**vanaprastha** or forest-dweller, and the  
**sanyasi** or wandering **ascetic**. In practical terms, for most men the householder stage is the final stage of life,  
since most men do not choose to move  
beyond it. The householder stage  
begins with marriage, and leads to  
raising and supporting a family. This  
stage is an active and fruitful time of  
life, and the householder is indispensable to society since his labors and  
resources support those in the other  
three stages of life. This is also the only  
stage of life in which sexual intercourse is not explicitly forbidden,  
since the general fruitfulness of this  
stage of life is expressed through procreation. A householder is permitted  
to pursue three of the traditional **aims**  
**of life** (purushartha): wealth (**artha**),  
desire (**kama**), and religious duty  
(**dharma**). Given the depth and richness of the householder’s life, it is not  
surprising that many men have little  
inclination to move on to the two  
other stages.
