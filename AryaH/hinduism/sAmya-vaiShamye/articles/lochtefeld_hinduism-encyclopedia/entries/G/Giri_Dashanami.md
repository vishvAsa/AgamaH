title = "Giri Dashanami"

+++
One of the ten divisions of the  
**Dashanami Sanyasis**, renunciant ascetics  
who are devotees (**bhakta**) of **Shiva**. The  
Dashanamis were supposedly established by the ninth-century philosopher  
**Shankaracharya**, in an effort to create  
247  
Giri Dashanami  
a corps of learned men who could help  
to revitalize Hindu life. Each of the divisions is designated by a different  
name—in this case, giri (“mountain”).  
Upon **initiation**, new members are  
given this name as a surname to their  
new **ascetic** names, thus allowing for  
immediate group identification.  
Aside from their individual identity,  
these ten “named” divisions are collected into four larger organizational  
groups: **Anandawara**, **Bhogawara**,  
**Bhuriwara**, and **Kitawara**. Each group  
has its headquarters in one of the four  
monastic centers (**maths**) supposedly  
established by Shankaracharya. Each of  
the four groups is also associated with  
one of the four **Vedas**—the oldest Hindu  
sacred texts, a different geographical  
quarter of India, a different great utterance (**mahavakya**), and a  
different ascetic quality. The Giri  
Dashanamis belong to the **Anandawara**  
group, which is affiliated with the **Jyotir**  
**math** in the Himalayan town of  
**Joshimath**.
