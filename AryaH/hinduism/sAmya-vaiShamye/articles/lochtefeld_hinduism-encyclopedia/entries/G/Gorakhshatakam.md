(“Gorakh’s Hundred”) Text attributed to  
the sage **Gorakhnath**. Although his  
authorship is ultimately unprovable, its  
teachings are consistent with those of  
the **Nathpanthi ascetics** who claim to be  
his disciples. In at least one of its forms,  
as translated by Briggs, the text has 101  
verses, not 100 verses as the title suggests. The *Gorakhshatakam* gives  
instruction on the type of **yoga** practiced by the Nathpanthi ascetics in  
which the major motif is the union of  
polar opposites. It begins with instruction on the structure of the **subtle body**,  
an alternate physiological system that  
resides on a different plane of existence  
than gross matter, but possesses certain  
correspondences to the material body.  
The subtle body is visualized as a set of  
six psychic centers (**chakras**) running  
roughly along the course of the spine.  
Above and below these centers are the  
bodily abodes of the two divine principles, **Shiva** (awareness) and **Shakti**  
(power). The aspirant aims to awaken a  
latent spiritual energy residing in the  
shakti called **kundalini** and move it to  
union with the Shiva principle at the  
crown of the head. The ultimate aim of  
this practice is to gain control over the  
forces that affect the body, allowing one  
to become purified and immortal.
