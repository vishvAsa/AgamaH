title = "Ganika"

+++
(“harlot”) In Hindu mythology, a figure  
who serves as an example of the  
boundless power of God’s **grace** and  
the ease with which one can be saved  
by even unconscious devotion. Ganika  
is a notorious prostitute who devotes  
little time or attention to religious life.  
Her only pious act is to teach her pet  
parrot to repeat the name of the god  
**Vishnu**, and in trying to teach it she  
repeats the divine name over and over  
again. This continual repetition of the  
name is enough to gain Vishnu’s grace.  
Upon Ganika’s death, Vishnu’s servants rescue her from the minions of  
Death and convey her to his celestial  
realm, **Vaikuntha**.
