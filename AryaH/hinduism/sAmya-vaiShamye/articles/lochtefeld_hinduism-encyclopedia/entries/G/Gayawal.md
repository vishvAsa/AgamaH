title = "Gayawal"

+++
**Endogamous** group of pilgrimage  
priests (**pandas**) who live in **Gaya**, a pilgrimage place (**tirtha**) famous as a site  
for rites for the dead. Each Gayawal family  
245  
Gayawal  
has exclusive hereditary rights to serve  
all the pilgrims whose ancestral homes  
lie in a particular region or regions,  
regardless of where those pilgrims may  
be living at the time. As at all pilgrimage  
sites, pilgrims are supposed to be served  
only by their hereditary family priest.  
This monopoly gives the Gayawals  
greater leverage in negotiating fees  
with their pilgrim clients, who are in a  
vulnerable position since most of them  
have come to perform rites for dead relatives. The Gayawals are notorious for  
their rapaciousness, greed, and general  
lack of learning. These qualities render  
them somewhat debased by **brahmin**  
standards, as does the fact that they  
make much of their income from the  
dead, which is considered inauspicious. In fairness to the Gayawals, the  
relative power derived from this  
monopoly is also balanced by a sense of  
hereditary obligation to their clientsâ€”  
the perennial issue is never whether the  
clients will be served, but how much  
they will have to pay.
