The Grand Bassin, a mountain lake on the island of Mauritius. Just before the festival of Shivaratri,  
crowds of people gather at this lake and draw water to offer to the god Shiva.  
relate or correspond to sacred landscape features on the Indian subcontinent. Grand Bassin is a remote and  
high lake, which the Hindus on  
Mauritius call the **Ganges** River. In the  
days before the festival of **Shivaratri**  
(Februaryâ€“March), great crowds of people come to Grand Bassin. They bathe  
(**snana**) in the lake, **worship** at the temples surrounding it, and then draw pots  
of **water** from the lake and carry them  
on foot back to their homes. The pilgrims time their departures to arrive at  
their homes on the evening of  
Shivaratri, and the water is offered to  
the god **Shiva** in their local temple. This  
sort of rite can be found in several  
places in India, most notably at  
**Vaidyanath** in **Bihar**.
