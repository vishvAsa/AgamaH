title = "Gudimallam Linga"

+++
A particular **linga**, or symbolic form  
of the god **Shiva**. It is reliably dated  
from the second century B.C.E. and is  
arguably the oldest existing Hindu  
image. It is named after the place in  
which it is found, the village of  
Gudimallam, which is in the southeastern corner of the state of **Andhra**  
**Pradesh**, near the border with **Tamil**  
**Nadu**. Despite its venerable age, the  
linga is still enshrined in its original  
temple and remains an object of **worship**. The linga itself is a five-foot pillar of polished stone, which bears a  
four-foot-high carving of Shiva on its  
front side. The sculptural work is  
quite detailed and shows several surprising features. Shiva’s **hair** is woven  
into a turban-like shape, rather than  
in the usual matted locks. Shiva has  
only two arms, rather than the multiple arms one commonly finds in later  
images. He carries a ram in his arms,  
rather than a **deer**—the only **sculpture** in which a ram appears. Finally,  
the figure of Shiva has no **sacred**  
**thread** (yajnopavit), which became  
commonplace later. The linga is also  
notable for the detailed work at the  
top of the pillar, which exactly models  
the head of an erect penis. This is also  
a departure from later iconography,  
in which the top of the linga is usually smoothly rounded. Although linga  
worship should be interpreted symbolically as an homage to the power  
behind the universe, the object’s form  
is clearly phallic.
