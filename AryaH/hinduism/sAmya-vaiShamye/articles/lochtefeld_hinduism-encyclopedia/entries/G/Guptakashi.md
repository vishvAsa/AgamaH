(“hidden **Kashi**”) Village and sacred site  
(**tirtha**) in the **Himalaya** Mountains of  
the state of **Uttar Pradesh**. Guptakashi  
is located on the **Mandakini** River, one  
of the Himalayan tributaries that combine to create the **Ganges** River. The  
site’s charter myth is connected to the  
**Pandavas**, the five brothers who are the  
protagonists of the epic **Mahabharata**.  
According to local legend, the **Pandavas**  
went to **Benares** (also known as Kashi)  
seeking an audience with the god **Shiva**,  
but Shiva slipped away and hid in  
Guptakashi. Guptakashi’s two holiest  
sites are temples to Shiva. At one of  
these temples, Shiva is worshiped in his  
form as **Vishvanath**, the “Lord of the  
Universe,” who is the presiding **deity** at  
the most important temple in Benares.  
The other is dedicated to his form as  
**Ardhanarishvara**, in which the left side  
of the image has female form, dress, and  
ornamentation, whereas the right side is  
male. The local claim that Guptakashi is  
a “hidden” Kashi shows the fluidity of  
the Indian sacred landscape, in which  
265  
Guptakashi  
the sacredness of one place can be  
appropriated by another. This is a way to  
claim some of the splendor of Kashi as a  
sacred site and to attribute power to a  
much smaller and more remote site.
