title = "Girnar"

+++
Sacred site (**tirtha**) on a hill outside the  
city of Junagadh in the state of **Gujarat**.  
Girnar has been a holy site for at least  
2,000 years and remains an important  
place for several religious communities.  
The hill’s summit is an important pilgrimage site for the Jains and has a cluster of Jain temples, some of them dating  
back to the twelfth century. It also has a  
long history as a center for Hindu  
ascetics—the Brahmachari **Sanyasis**  
(**Brahmacharin**) have an **ashram** there,  
and the summit is said to have a set of  
footprints left by **Dattatreya**, a famous  
mythic figure who is considered a partial  
**avatar** of the god **Vishnu** and a  
paradigm for **asceticism**. Girnar is the  
site of a large Hindu **ascetic** gathering  
on **Kartik Purnima**, the **full moon**  
in the **lunar month** of Kartik  
(October–November).
