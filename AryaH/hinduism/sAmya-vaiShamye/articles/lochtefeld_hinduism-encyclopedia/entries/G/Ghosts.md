title = "Ghosts"

+++
Popular Hindu culture generally accepts  
the existence of ghosts and spirits, particularly of people who have died a violent or untimely death. Despite the  
virtually universal belief in reincarnation (**samsara**), it is generally accepted  
that the spirits of people who have died  
such deaths linger near where they lived  
during their lives. Ghosts will usually  
reveal themselves through disturbances,  
misfortunes, or by appearing to family  
members in visions or dreams. The family  
will then take measures to appease  
the spirit. Sometimes this is done by  
sponsoring rituals or ceremonies. Other  
times a family may prepare a shrine for  
the ghost to inhabit. Such ghosts are  
usually believed to have unsatisfied  
desiresâ€”either they died prior to getting  
married or having children, or they  
started major enterprises they were  
unable to finish. People who have lived  
long lives and fulfilled all the major  
human goals will not become ghosts.
