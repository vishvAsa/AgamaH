+++
Temple town in the eastern part of **Tamil**  
**Nadu**, about forty-five miles north and  
east of the city of **Tanjore**. This was one  
of the temples in the Tanjore region built  
by the Chola kings during their era of  
preeminence between the ninth and  
thirteenth centuries. The temple at  
Gangaikondacholapuran was built in  
1025 by King **Rajendra I** (r. 1014â€“1042)  
to commemorate his march to the  
**Ganges** in 1023 after vanquishing the  
king of Bengal. One of the images outside the temple door shows the kneeling  
Rajendra being garlanded by the god  
**Shiva** and his wife **Parvati**, doubtless  
intended to give Rajendra divine support for his entitlement to rule. See also  
**Chola dynasty**.
