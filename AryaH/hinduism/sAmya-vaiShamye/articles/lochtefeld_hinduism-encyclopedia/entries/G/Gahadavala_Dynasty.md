title = "Gahadavala Dynasty"

+++
(r. 1089â€“1194) Northern Indian dynasty  
whose core region was the western and  
central parts of the Gangetic plain. The  
Gahadavalas were a short-lived and  
transitional dynasty who filled a political vacuum during the tumultuous years  
following the turn of the first millennium.  
During this period the Gangetic plain  
was plagued by political instability and  
was regularly subjected to Muslim raids.  
The Gahadavalas supplanted the  
**Rashtrakutas**, whom they conquered in  
1089, and consolidated their power  
through the middle **Ganges** basin. In  
1194 the Gahadavalas were defeated by  
the Ghurids, an Afghani Muslim dynasty.  
Following their defeat, most of the  
Gahadavala territory became part of the  
Ghurid empire.
