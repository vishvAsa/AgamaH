title = "Gond"

+++
Tribal (**adivasi**) community in central  
India. The Gonds are concentrated in  
the state of **Madhya Pradesh**, particularly in the hills on both sides of the  
**Vindhya Mountains**, in the Kaimur  
Range at the eastern border of Madhya  
Pradesh and **Uttar Pradesh**, and in the  
**Ramgarh** Hills on the border of Madhya  
Pradesh, **Orissa**, and **Bihar**. Like most  
tribal peoples, they tend to be quite  
poor and eke out a living from subsistence agriculture.
