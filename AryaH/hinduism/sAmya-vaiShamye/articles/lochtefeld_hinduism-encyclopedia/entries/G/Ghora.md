(“terrifying”) Term used to refer to  
Hindu **deities** in their frightful, terrifying, and powerful aspects, as opposed to  
their benevolent (**saumya**) manifestations. This distinction is particularly  
applicable to the god **Shiva** and the  
forms of the **Goddess**, both of whom can  
appear in either form, and devotees  
(**bhakta**) can focus their **worship** on  
either aspect.
