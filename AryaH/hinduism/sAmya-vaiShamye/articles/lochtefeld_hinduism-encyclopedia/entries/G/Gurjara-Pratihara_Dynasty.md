title = "Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty"

+++
(7th–11th c.) Northern Indian dynasty  
that filled the political void created by  
the collapse of the **Pushyabhuti dynasty**  
late in the seventh century. Like the  
Pushyabhutis, the Gurjara-Pratiharas  
initially had their capital at the city of  
**Kanyakubja**, on the **Ganges** River in  
eastern part of the state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. At its peak early in the eighth  
century, the Gurjara-Pratiharas controlled most of the Indian subcontinent  
north of the **Vindhya Mountains**, and  
the Ganges basin well into **West Bengal**.  
The dynasty was weakened when the  
kingdom split in two in the mid-eighth  
century, with the Gurjaras reigning over  
the kingdom’s western part from their  
capital at **Ujjain** and the Pratiharas  
remaining in Kanyakubja. Both kingdoms were engaged in constant warfare  
with the **Rashtrakuta** dynasty, which  
controlled central India south of the  
Vindhya Mountains; they were also  
harassed by Muslim raiders from modern day Afghanistan. The Gurjara kingdom was conquered by the **Chandella**  
**dynasty** in 1019 and became restricted  
to the lower Ganges basin. It finally disappeared about 1050 C.E.
