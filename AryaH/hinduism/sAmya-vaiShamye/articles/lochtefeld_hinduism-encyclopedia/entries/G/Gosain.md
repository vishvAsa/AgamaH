title = "Gosain"

+++
Vernacular form of the **Sanskrit** word  
*goswami* (“master of the senses”).  
Although this epithet could be used to  
refer to any **ascetic**, during British colonial rule in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was most commonly  
257  
Gosain  
used to denote certain subgroups  
among the **Sanyasis**, the ascetic devotees (**bhakta**) of the god **Shiva**. The  
name was particular to Sanyasis at the  
low end of the ascetic status scale, such  
as the **Nathpanthis** or the **Naga** (militant) Sanyasis, who were often recruited  
from the lower classes of society.
