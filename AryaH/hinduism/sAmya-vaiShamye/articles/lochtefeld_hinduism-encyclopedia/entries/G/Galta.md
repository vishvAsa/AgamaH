title = "Galta"

+++
A village in the state of **Rajasthan**, a few  
miles east of Jaipur, the capital. Galta is  
most famous for its connection with the  
**Bairagi Naga** ascetics, renunciant tradersoldiers who were devotees (**bhakta**) of  
the god **Vishnu**. According to Bairagi  
tradition, in 1756 a conference took  
place at Galta in which the different  
groups of Bairagi Naga ascetics were  
welded into one cohesive military unit  
called the **Ramanadis** or “army of Ram”  
under the leadership of a Bairagi named  
Balanand. Balanand organized the  
Ramanandis into three **anis** or armies—  
the **Digambara** Ani, **Nirvani Ani**, and  
**Nirmohi Ani**—which are still the major  
Bairagi divisions. According to tradition, this unification was necessary  
because of continual attacks by the  
Naga class of the **Dashanami Sanyasis**,  
a competing group of renunciant tradersoldiers who were devotees of the god  
**Shiva**. The dispute occurred during  
the festival **Kumbha Mela**, ostensibly  
over precedence in the bathing (**snana**)  
procession, which was a sign of relative status. However, an underlying  
cause may have been power and control of an area’s resources.  
The exact circumstances under  
which the armies of Ram were formed  
are difficult to determine. Independent  
sources clearly show that the Bairagis  
became more cohesively organized during the late eighteenth century and  
that some of these bairagi bands were  
using their mobility, resources, and  
power to engage in long-distance trading. However, the decentralized nature  
of **ascetic** life makes the summary formation of such an army highly unlikely,  
unless this was the final fruition of an  
already existing trend.
