(“mountain-lifter”) In Hindu mythology,  
a youthful and heroic form of the god  
**Krishna**. According to the story, as a  
young man Krishna observes that the  
village elders make yearly **offerings** to  
**Indra**, the god of the storm. After some  
persuasion, Krishna manages to convince the elders that instead of making  
offerings to Indra, who is too far off in  
**heaven** to do them any good, they  
should offer them instead to Mount  
**Govardhan**. This mountain looms over  
their village as a symbol of their prosperity, and since Krishna’s devotees  
(**bhakta**) consider this mountain to be  
another form of Krishna, he is actually  
persuading the elders to make offerings  
to him. Indra is furious when he discovers what has happened, and unleashes a  
violent storm that threatens to wash  
away the village and destroy all the  
inhabitants. To protect the villagers and  
their cattle from harm, Krishna lifts up  
Mount Govardhan, and holds it over  
their heads as an umbrella to protect  
them from the rain. After seven days,  
Indra admits defeat, and Krishna  
emerges as the hero of the village. This

Jain temple in Girnar. Settled atop a hill, Girnar is an ancient site  
that is sacred to both Hindu and Jain religious communities.  
story illustrates the gradual eclipse  
of the older Vedic **deities**. The figure  
of Krishna as Giridhara is widely  
worshiped in **Rajasthan** and is particularly noteworthy as the “chosen deity”  
(**ishtadevata**) of the poet-saint **Mirabai**.
