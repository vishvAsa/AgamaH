title = "Gayasura"

+++
In Hindu mythology, the name of a very  
powerful asura (**demon**). Gayasura performs harsh **asceticism** (**tapas**), spurred  
by the traditional Indian assumption  
that to voluntarily endure physical suffering brings one spiritual and magical  
powers. Gayasura’s powers grow so  
large that all the gods become concerned that he might become powerful  
enough to overthrow them. As the gods’  
fears grow, the god **Vishnu** advises the  
god **Brahma** to convince Gayasura to  
allow his body to be sacrificed. Vishnu  
promises Gayasura that the place where  
he dies will become holier than all the  
sacred sites (**tirthas**) in the world. The  
spot where Gayasura’s body lies becomes  
the holy place known as **Gaya**, which by  
virtue of Vishnu’s boon is claimed to be  
holier than all other places on earth. See  
also **magic**.
