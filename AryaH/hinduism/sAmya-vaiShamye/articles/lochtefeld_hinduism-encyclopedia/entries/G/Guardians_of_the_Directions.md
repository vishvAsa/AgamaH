A collection of eight **deities**, each  
associated with one of the four cardinal and intermediate directions. In  
their traditional order, the deities are  
as follows: **Indra** for the east; **Agni** for  
the southeast; **Yama** for the south;  
**Nirriti** for the southwest; **Varuna** for  
the west; **Vayu** for the northwest;  
**Kubera** for the north; and **Shiva** for  
the northeast. Most of these are  
deities who were important in the  
**Vedas**, the earliest Hindu religious  
texts. Except for Shiva, they were  
replaced as traditions changed and  
have become minor deities in modern

Hindu religious life. These eight  
deities protect the directions with  
which they are associated. Each direction also carries certain associations  
because of its presiding deity. For  
example, south is generally considered an inauspicious direction  
because it is associated with Yama, the  
god of death.
