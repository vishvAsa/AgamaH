title = "Garuda"

+++
A mythical bird, often portrayed as an  
Indian kite or eagle. All of the Hindu  
**deities** have **animal** “vehicles,” who are  
their symbols and their associates.  
Garuda is considered the vehicle for the  
god **Vishnu**. As Vishnu’s vehicle, Garuda  
reflects some of the protective, lifeaffirming qualities associated with  
Vishnu. Garuda is the **son** of the sage  
**Kashyapa** and the divine maiden **Vinata**.  
The most famous story associated with  
Garuda explains the proverbial antipathy  
between eagles and snakes. Vinata has  
given **birth** to a line of eagles, whereas  
her sister **Kadru** has engendered a line of  
serpents. One day the sisters get into an  
argument about the tail color of a certain  
celestial horse—Vinata argues that it is  
white and Kadru asserts that it is black.  
They finally agree that the person who is  
wrong will become a slave to the other. To  
ensure her victory, Kadru persuades a  
number of her children to hang from the  
back of the horse, which from a distance  
makes the white tail appear to be black.  
When Vinata sees the black snakes, she  
accepts her defeat and has to serve Kadru  
under extremely harsh conditions for  
many years. When Garuda learns what  
has happened, he embarks on an endless  
program of killing snakes.
