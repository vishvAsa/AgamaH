title = "Gurutalpaga"

(“going to the **guru’s** bed”) In the **dharma**  
**literature**, which outlined rules for religious duty and appropriate behavior,  
Gurutalpaga was one of the **four great**  
**crimes** that made one an outcast from  
society. This particular offense was committed by having sexual relations with  
the wife of one’s guru or religious  
teacher. Since the disciple is considered  
a member of the guru’s family and must  
treat the guru with reverence and loyalty,  
this was obviously a serious breach of  
trust. Since these disciples are adolescent men and many of their gurus may  
have had wives much younger than  
themselves, such proximity could have  
easily generated serious temptation and  
required a strict prohibition to maintain  
appropriate relationships. The gravity of  
this offense can be seen by the penances  
prescribed for its expiation (**prayashchitta**). According to the dharma literature, the offender could either tear off  
his genitals, or embrace the red-hot statue of a woman while lying on a red-hot  
iron bed. In either case it was expected  
that this expiation would result in his  
death, although the texts always note  
that death blots out the offense.
