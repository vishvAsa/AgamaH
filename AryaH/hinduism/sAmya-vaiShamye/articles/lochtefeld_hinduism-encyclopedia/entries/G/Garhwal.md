In the most technical sense, Garhwal is  
the name of a particular hill district in  
the northern Indian state of **Uttar**  
**Pradesh**. Garhwal is more commonly  
used as the name for a cultural region in  
the Uttar Pradesh hills, made up of the  
241  
Garhwal  
districts of Garhwal, TehriGarhwal,  
Dehra Dun, Chamoli, and **Uttarkashi**.  
The Garhwal region contains all the  
major tributaries of the **Ganges**: the  
**Bhagirathi**, the **Mandakini**, the  
**Pindara**, and the **Alakananda**. It also  
contains many of the holiest sacred sites  
(**tirthas**) in the **Himalayas**, including  
**Yamunotri**, **Gangotri**, **Kedarnath**, and  
**Badrinath**. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, under the patronage of  
the king of the state of Tehri, the region  
was also one of the centers for the  
**Pahari** school of **miniature painting**.
