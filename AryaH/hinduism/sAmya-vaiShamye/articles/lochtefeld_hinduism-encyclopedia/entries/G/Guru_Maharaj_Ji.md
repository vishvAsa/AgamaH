title = "Guru Maharaj Ji"

+++
(b. 1957) Modern religious teacher and  
founder of the Divine Light Mission. In  
the early 1970s, Guru Maharaj Ji enjoyed  
phenomenal but fleeting success during  
a tour of the United States. Maharaj was  
the fourth **son** of Hans Ji Maharaj, a  
respected religious figure who founded  
the Prem Nagar **Ashram** in **Haridwar**, a  
sacred city on the **Ganges** River in the  
state of **Uttar Pradesh**. Maharaj’s father  
died when he was eight, after which his  
mother announced that Maharaj had  
inherited his father’s mantle. As with  
many modern Hindu missionary figures, Maharaj’s religious message  
stressed the need for devotion to an  
enlightened master, which he claimed  
to be. At fourteen, he came to the United  
States to considerable success. It quickly  
dissipated when he and his mother disagreed over his lifestyle and his marriage  
to an American woman. He later reconciled with his family, but not before his  
mother had named his eldest brother  
Satpal as successor to the family line.
