Battle reportedly fought in **Benares** by  
the **Naga ascetic** warriors of the  
**Mahanirvani Akhara**. According to a  
handwritten book in the **akhara’s**  
archives, in 1664 the akhara’s soldiers  
won a great victory near the **Gyan Vapi**  
well. This document simply states that  
the **Sanyasis** were victorious against the  
forces of “the Sultan,” although historians have inferred that this figure was the  
Moghul emperor **Aurangzeb**. If the story  
is true, this battle may have been a contributing factor in Aurangzeb’s decision  
to raze the **Vishvanath** temple in 1669.  
In light of this claim, it is possible that  
the temple’s destruction was motivated  
not simply by intolerant iconoclasm,  
but by the desire to inflict punishment  
for resistance and rebellion.
