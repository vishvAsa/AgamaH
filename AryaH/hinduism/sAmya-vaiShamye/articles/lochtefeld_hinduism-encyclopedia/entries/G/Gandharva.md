title = "Gandharva"

+++
In Hindu mythology, a class of demigods  
who are celestial singers and musicians.  
The gandharvas occasionally interact  
with humans. One of their divine gifts is  
the ability to bestow good singing voices  
to girls. Since the Gandharvas are always  
watching from above, they are considered to be the witnesses in a Gandharva  
marriage, one of the eight forms of marriage recognized in the **dharma literature**. The gandharva marriage was a  
marriage contracted by consensual sexual intercourse. See also **Marriage, eight**  
**classical forms**.
