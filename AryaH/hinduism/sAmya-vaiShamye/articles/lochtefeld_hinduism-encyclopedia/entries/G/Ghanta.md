A handbell. These bells typically have a  
long straight handle projecting upward  
from the top and are usually rung with  
the bell part projecting from the bottom of the closed hand. Ringing bells is  
an important element in Hindu **worship** (**puja**) and its pleasing sound is  
one of the sixteen traditional **offerings**  
(**upacharas**) given to the **deity** as part of  
worship. Many different deities are pictured with bells in Hindu iconography,  
but it is particularly associated with the  
**goddess Kali**, whose roaring voice is  
equated with a tolling bell.
