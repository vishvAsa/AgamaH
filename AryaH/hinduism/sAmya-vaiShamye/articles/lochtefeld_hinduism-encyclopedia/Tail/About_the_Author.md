Dr. Lochtefeld specializes in Hinduism and is particularly interested in contemporary
Hindu religious life. He did fieldwork for his dissertation in the North Indian pilgrimage
town of Haridwar under the guidance of the American Institute of Indian Studies and Delhi
University. Aside from Hinduism, his areas of teaching have included the Buddhist tradition
in India, China, and Japan; Islam; Chinese religion; and Sanskrit. Lochtefeld was three times

the summer of 1996, he returned to Haridwar to conduct fieldwork. He was awarded a Senior
Research Fellowship by the American Institute of Indian Studies, through which he was able
to study the Kumbha Mela, the world’s largest religious festival, during a sabbatical leave in
Haridwar in the spring of 1998.
