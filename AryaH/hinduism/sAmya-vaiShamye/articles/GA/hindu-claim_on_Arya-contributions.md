## Summary
> There are achievements by non Arya peoples all over that are great.

Agreed with the point on Non-Ārya contributions but most importantly, lest people be confused, Ārya contributions are exclusively for Hindus to claim, celebrate and boast. The historical origins & evolutionary lineage are highly overrated in the question of legacy. The Ārya contribution to Dharma is a pan-Hindu legacy for Hindus to enjoy and suffers no claims from those who are merely “fellow IEs”—an identity that means nothing to the Āryas.

## RShis and their folk
The legacy of the Veda belongs primarily to those who survived the Rșis and secondarily to those whom the descendants of the Rșis saw as their “folks”.

The Rșis established the Samhitā corpus and their descendants successively conceived the Brāhmaņas, Āraņyakas & Upanișads (thereby completing the Vedic canon), the itihāsapurāņas, the Āgama/Tantra canon, etc. Eventually, some of the exalted descendants of the hoary Rșis would go on to master regional languages of “non-Ārya linguistic families” and contribute to the devotional canon in those languages.

Being IA, IE—all this means nothing.

## External connection
Somewhere in the deepest south of Bhārata, you will have a “non-Ārya”, Drāvida-haplogroup man who divines the futures of fellow men through the mystical revelations of an Ārya Rși. The Rșis have become connected to him despite the seeming lack of ethnic/hereditary connection.

… Their yet later descendants would go on to discover, through their mind’s eye, new lores concerning the gods worshiped by so-called, “non-Ārya” Draviḍas and Śabaras, as if these Deities were but their own “Ārya” Devas from the very beginning, albeit in a different skin & tongue.

## IA rejects
Meanwhile, so-called IA Mazdayasni who hates the Devas will be forever hated and condemned by our Rși fathers in the heavens.

The Ārya sages chose Bhārata. Their descendants chose to identify the south, west & east as part of their universe rather than some far-flung IE cousins.

In fact, a pious Ārya would have affection for a Draviḍa who adopted Deva as Deivam into his native tongue and detest an accursed fellow “IE/IA tribe” which blasphemes the Daevas as evil.

Even if Āryas came to Bhārata from outside, the only ones who have a right to talk about them with a sense of inheritance are Hindus, particularly the heirs of the Rșis who are very much alive today.

## History
We don’t have to stand in the way of genuine historical conclusions. We just don’t care.
