Tragicomical to see ahistorical “sanātana dharma was all over the world once” narrative backfire, with some of these Western “Hindus” claiming that Hindudharma does not have a special link with Bhārata. 

This is a problem that we have pointed out before. It horrifies some of these Western Hindus, to the very core of their being, that a “lowly Bhāratīya” can be their Ācārya or Dīkșāguru. The resources of the religion (scriptures, lore, icons, etc) are for us to generate but the leadership position is for them.

They can never accept the leadership of a Bhāratīya who is inferior to them.

To be honest, I am fine with them feeling that way. But it must also mean that they cannot be recognized as Hindus by (real) Hindus.


When you are facing these bad-faith actors, it’s best to be tethered to historical realities and solid facts, which all point towards the special and one-of-a-kind link between Bhārata and Hindudharma, even though Hindudharma has a deep link with southeast-Asia as well and can be followed by anyone in the world.

As for Kṛṣṇa, his Yādavatvam is so clearly emphasised in the Viṣṇupurāṇa:

Original and Translation below

Kṛṣṇa was a Yādava on this earth.

The epithet Yādava, indicating patrilineal descent, indicates a particular type of hereditary lineage found only among Bhāratīyas.

Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is a Bhāratīya.

Even for Viṣṇu who remains beyond this earth during an incarnation as well as for Śiva and Rudra, they all have a special relationship with Bhārata alone and when those among the Devas who incarnate do incarnate, it is the lineages which are Bhāratīya in essence that they choose to grace.

Śrīkaņțharudra’s golden hair or “white” body has nothing to do with Caucasian bodily features. The same Rudra is called Nīlalohita as well (blue-red); what will you make of this? And His (& Paramaśiva’s) special abodes are all based in Bhārata alone.

And the wisdom about the Devas was born in (i.e. revealed in) the minds of Bhāratīya sages and Ācāryas. Inasmuch the revelation of a birth-less Deva can be figuratively called ‘birth’, the Devas are all Bhāratīya alone.

So, whether you like it or not, you are worshiping a Bhāratīya when you choose to worship a Deva.
