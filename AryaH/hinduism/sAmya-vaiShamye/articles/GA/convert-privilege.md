While certain paths are open to MahāmlecchādayaH by initiation, a problem they undeniably present is that they can’t be content with being passive spectators. They have to be leaders & reshape the path/system in their image. No ritual space can be closed off to them.

A certain Āṅglika Mantravādī of the “Adhvamata” of the Cīnas in this realm is a good example of this tendency. 

Another example is this priest +++(rAmi sivan/ rAma rAmanuja?)+++ initiated into the Pāñcarātra, who has taken it upon himself to waive off the applicability of adhikāravidhi for… well… himself.  

Many of them are simply not interested in or devoted to preserving the integrity of a Sampradāya’s teachings & practices. If it’s a space that appeals to them, they want to own that space & will undermine traditional institutions & rules in play, if that is deemed necessary.

Prachanna-Pāñcarātrika uses the favourite excuse for claiming authority - That the Ārṣeyas are effectively dead & obsolete when the reality is far from that. This is why I refer to this ilk as museum-chasers.
