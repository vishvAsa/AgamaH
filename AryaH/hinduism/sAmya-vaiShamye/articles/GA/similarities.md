The more you read your own scriptures as well as those of other religions as a Hindu, the more you will realize that 95% of the memes in other religions, which are purportedly objects of ridicule, contention or disgust, will have some parallels in the vast ocean that is Hindu Dharma. You just haven’t heard of them. It’s the remaining 5% which forms the most crucial line of demarcation & are completely non-negotiable.


Someone was ridiculing a story of how Mohamatta was miraculously nursed by his uncle Talib. But in essence, this belongs to the same category as the story of Mandhātṛ (who was literally birthed by his father Yuvanaśva after the latter drank consecrated water meant for his wife). 

Or trying to make a “scandal” out of Song of Songs in the Yahudāgama or, say, Bridal Mysticism in the Romaka-Preta tradition—all such efforts to create a scandal are devastatingly stupid in the light of our Dharma’s own rich heritage of Śṛṅgāra.

("Not just nuns all Christians are considered as brides of Jesus . There is a erotic book known as song of solomons which the Christians interpret as between Christians and Jesus .")

Hindus never get into the heart of the matter, always peripheral concerns and particular stories (which will have some parallel somewhere inside our religion which has thousands of stories). 

Even purported philosophical differences are stupid. “Abrahamics believe that scriptures are revealed by God while Hindus believe that they are apauruṣeya—unauthored & uncreated”. Some Hindus even think that “uncreated scripture” is some remarkably unique idea.

Not all Hindus believe in an uncreated scripture while Sunni Marūnmattas (which is the majority group) believe in uncreated Kōrān.
