A point that will discomfit many: Deva/Devī X is father/mother of all; how can she cause harm to me for reciting certain mantras without initiation? How can he/she punish me for this, whether now or at some point in the future?

A naive question. Yes, Īśvara/Īśvarī is always gracing all sentients at all times. But why do you conflate their grace (i.e. what is Good from their POV) with what is good from your POV (protection of physical body and mind from harm and subtle body from pāpaphala).

There are actual textual references to the Deity’s parivāra inflicting certain sufferings on you as a form of grace. From that Supreme God’s POV, it is only good. If you want their broad definition of ‘Good’ and your narrower understanding of ‘good’ to be aligned, nothing wrong with it at all—follow the vidhi. 🙂

Īśvara is a silent observer who keeps giving his grace. Of course, how we choose to receive that grace depends on us. There is not one hint of deliberated action on his part. He is ultra-simple; everything about Him and everything done by Him is pure anugraha.

Hence, the mention of “parivāra”. parivāra & Gaņas are distinct from Śiva in Siddhānta. Śakti is inseparable Śivatvam of Śiva.


These are learnings from various Śaiva-Śākta texts; not some papal proclamations by myself. From Īśvara’s point of view, everything is anugraha, including the impetus given to your mind, brain & hands to type such cynical gyān and whatever will result for you over time from such cynicism.
