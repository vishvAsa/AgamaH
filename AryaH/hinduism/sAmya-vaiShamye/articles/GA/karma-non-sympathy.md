> As a Hindu who believes in karma, do you believe whatever is happening to people is due to their own past karma? Then why feel sympathy towards the poor?

Not for an individual to make karmic computations. It could also be his karma to be put into distress & then either successfully saved by you or fail to be saved by you (but you nevertheless attempted) or saved from the distress but only partially. Not for you to know. 

All you need to know is that scriptures have mandated what you need to do when someone is suffering. You need to give your best & help. 

His indeterminable karmic trajectory is none of your business, unless you have come to know what it is by divine grace.
