The more you read your own scriptures as well as those of other religions as a Hindu, the more you will realize that 95% of the memes in other religions, which are purportedly objects of ridicule, contention or disgust, will have some parallels in the vast ocean that is Hindu Dharma. You just haven’t heard of them. It’s the remaining 5% which forms the most crucial line of demarcation & are completely non-negotiable.

Also, to frame Hindudharma as a polar opposite of Abraham religions in all respects is stupid. It’s almost as if you want to be a polar opposite solely so that you can mock them for beliefs you have already decided are ridiculous or wrong.


The moment you decide to frame yourself as a polar opposite of someone or something, you are already dependent on them in a perverse way.+++(5)+++ You should have your own positive substance which will come with a core and a periphery and you must muster the wisdom from within to separate the wheat from the chaff.

## Cases
Hindus never get into the heart of the matter, always peripheral concerns and particular stories (which will have some parallel somewhere inside our religion which has thousands of stories).

### Islam
Someone was ridiculing a story of how Mohamatta was miraculously nursed by his uncle Talib. But in essence, this belongs to the same category as the story of Mandhātṛ (who was literally birthed by his father Yuvanaśva after the latter drank consecrated water meant for his wife).

#### svarga and apsarases
Why are some Hindus so bothered about the idea of dalliance with apsaras in svarga?

Is it because you have invested too much in making fun of Hoors? That’s on you. The learned ones never told you to take that direction. More importantly:

1. You can try rebutting one or two verses due to mistakes in verse numbering (which is cheating and taking the easy way out) or genuinely wrong attributions. But there are enough verses to talk about Apsaras in Svarga. Arjuna is cursed to become a eunuch for a year precislty because he refuses to accept Ūrvaśī’s advances and justifications for same that dalliance with her is not sinful (which is correct). However, his refusing her advances are said to bring him and his mother’s upbringing lasting fame and even that curse is said to be a blessing in disguise. 

2. Svarga is not the highest end in any Āstika Sampradāya. Mukti does not envision such bhogas. That’s a point everyone forgets to bring up. Those who enjoy carnal pleasures in svarga have to take birth on earth again if they did not attain spiritual perfection. And Svarga with all its luxuries will be burnt to ashes in Mahāpralaya. 


### Christianity
Or trying to make a “scandal” out of Song of Songs in the Yahudāgama or, say, Bridal Mysticism in the Romaka-Preta tradition—all such efforts to create a scandal are devastatingly stupid in the light of our Dharma’s own rich heritage of Śṛṅgāra.

("Not just nuns all Christians are considered as brides of Jesus . There is a erotic book known as song of solomons which the Christians interpret as between Christians and Jesus .")

### Philosophical
Even purported philosophical differences are stupid. “Abrahamics believe that scriptures are revealed by God while Hindus believe that they are apauruṣeya—unauthored & uncreated”. Some Hindus even think that “uncreated scripture” is some remarkably unique idea.

> Not all Hindus believe in an uncreated scripture while Sunni Marūnmattas (which is the majority group) believe in uncreated Kōrān.
