      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/i/lists/934873690050740224&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tragicomical to see ahistorical “sanātana dharma was all over the world once” narrative backfire, with some of these Western “Hindus” claiming that Hindudharma does not have a special link with Bhārata.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that we have pointed out before. It horrifies some of these Western Hindus, to the very core of their being, that a “lowly Bhāratīya” can be their Ācārya or Dīkșāguru. The resources of the religion (scriptures, lore, icons, etc) are for us to generate but the leadership position is for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bhadrakali-priest-swap&#34;&gt;bhadrakAlI priest swap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Ādiśaiva Brāhmaņa who served at a temple at Simhapuri mentioned to us about a Bhadrakālī temple his patriline is associated with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On most days, she would receive worship in the Saiddhāntika fashion, being seen as the consort of Vīrabhadra, whose Tattva placement is between Prakrti and Guņa tattvas. Her liturgy is Samskrta and the praxis is Āgamika, an “Ārya” evolute ultimately rooted in Vaidika and Sāńkhya thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/GhorAngirasa/status/1817423939267879176&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a Hindu who believes in karma, do you believe whatever is happening to people is due to their own past karma? Then why feel sympathy towards the poor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not for an individual to make karmic computations. It could also be his karma to be put into distress &amp;amp; then either successfully saved by you or fail to be saved by you (but you nevertheless attempted) or saved from the distress but only partially. Not for you to know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mercy by punishment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/GhorAngirasa/status/1925109619128733978&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A point that will discomfit many: Deva/Devī X is father/mother of all; how can she cause harm to me for reciting certain mantras without initiation? How can he/she punish me for this, whether now or at some point in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A naive question. Yes, Īśvara/Īśvarī is always gracing all sentients at all times. But why do you conflate their grace (i.e. what is Good from their POV) with what is good from your POV (protection of physical body and mind from harm and subtle body from pāpaphala).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rationale</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who do the greatest damage to traditional positions are those who give scientism-laced nonsense to rationalise the traditional position. If you don’t know how to defend traditional positions, it’s better to not say anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truth is; some traditional positions have a straightforward rationale whereas others do not. It’s often the case that traditional positions on outsiders may not have a rationale spelt out or fleshed out because they are addressed to insiders and it’s taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/GhorAngirasa/status/1919354622768296023&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to read history of one’s religion and be fully aware of the diverse forms of our religion &amp;amp; what they achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;rise-of-popular-cults&#34;&gt;Rise of popular cults&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m no fan of Kabīr &amp;amp; the like (it’s not my cup of tea and there are far more satisfying forms of religion for me, personally). However, one has to be honest and ask himself what leads to the proliferation of such forms of religion, which are more focused on “feel-good”, “vibes” &amp;amp; “social justice”? Changes like this do not happen in a vacuum. They are reactions to profoundly dissatisfying transformations of traditional religion, due to the erosion &amp;amp; corrosion of the caliber of the traditional custodians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You just haven’t heard of them. It’s the remaining 5% which forms the most crucial line of demarcation &amp;amp; are completely non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Veda tantra continuity</title>
