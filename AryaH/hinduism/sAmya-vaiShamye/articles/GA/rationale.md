Those who do the greatest damage to traditional positions are those who give scientism-laced nonsense to rationalise the traditional position. If you don’t know how to defend traditional positions, it’s better to not say anything at all.

Truth is; some traditional positions have a straightforward rationale whereas others do not. It’s often the case that traditional positions on outsiders may not have a rationale spelt out or fleshed out because they are addressed to insiders and it’s taken for granted.

In the absence of a fleshed out rationale, you have to go through all extant texts on the matter and piece together the rationale from scratch—a laborious but rewarding endeavour if done carefully and skilfully.
