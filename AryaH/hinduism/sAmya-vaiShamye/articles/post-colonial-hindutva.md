Hindutva claims to embody Hindu pride, and a rejection of colonialism and white racism. Nevertheless virtually every proponent of Hindutva agrees with the following statement (explicitly or implicitly):

We accept the norms that were violently imposed on us, during colonialism, by our white British masters. This is because the norms of our masters are superior to the norms found in Hinduism.

The British were correct in banning monstrous Hindu practices like caste, untouchability, female infanticide, wife burning, bars on widow remarraige, bars on female inheritance of property, minor marriage, polygyny, human sacrifice to kali, etc.

The only aspects of Hinduism we retain are those which do not conflict with the superior norms of our white British masters. Even to this day, whenever the British or other whites demand it, we immediately change our norms (e.g., LGBT). This is because in our hearts we are committed to a neo-colonial world where whites are still our masters.

Hindu pride simply means that we verbally claim to value Hinduism, that we publicly use Hindu symbols, and that we attack non-Hindus as morally evil enemies.
