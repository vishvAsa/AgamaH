Preamble

The scope of this study is limited to funerary practices within the brahminical \(Hindu\) fold of the ancient period, i.e. North India from the Vedic Age to the reign of King Harṣavardhana \(7th century\). Funerary practices in South India, Dravida country, and Southeast Asia seem to have differed significantly from those in North India. 1 They deserve a study of their owṇ In late medieval North India new forms of commemoration \( samādhis, chatarīs\) emerged, 

possibly under Islamic influence. 2

The funerary monument in Sanskrit literature

We possess a moving literary description of what the death of a king—great in the eyes of his contemporaries—brought about, how it was experienced by the court, and which ritual and ceremonies were performed to cope with the calamity. Bāṇa in Harṣacarita 5 tells us that, even before the actual demise of Harṣa’s father, Prabhākaravardhana, the latter’s first wife, Queen Yaśovatī, was so overwhelmed by grief and the prospect of widowhood that she, against the express wish of her son, committed herself to the flames \(i.e. became a satī\), while her husband was still alive. 

After the death of his mother Harṣa goes to his dying father and clasps his feet in dispair̥ The latter comforts him, recommends him to his royal duties, and utters his last words: ‘enemies should be exterminated’. 3 The body is brought to the bank of the Sarasvatī on a bier, a funeral pyre is built and the cremation ritual is performed at dusk. It is suggested that the remaining ladies of the king’s harem also commit satī. Harṣa keeps a vigil and next morning goes to the Sarasvatī to bathe, offers an oblation of water to his father, and goes home in distress \(p. 293\). A brahmin eats the first piṇḍas  offered to the

ghost \( preta\) and the period of impurity passes. 

The deceased king’s paraphernalia are given to the brahmins; the collected bones are brought to holy places. Then it is said that a ‘stab of pain’ is set up

in the form of a monument at \(the place of\) the funeral pyre made of a mass of bricks. 4 Finally the royal elephant is set loose and gradually the lamentations subside. The metaphor used by Bāṇa, ‘a stab of pain’ \( śokaśalya\)—the primary meaning of śalya  being ‘dart’—suggests that the monument had the form of a needle. 5 Such a monument seems to be known from the Sanskrit literature, viz. the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa’s chapter on the so-called aiḍūka. 

The aiḍūka of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa

Viṣṇudharmottara 3.84.1–15 describes the aiḍūkarūpa  as followṣ6

A structure is built of three \(receding\) square platforms \( bhadrapīṭha\), with steps on four sides. On the third platform a liṅgarūpa  is erected, but one not

decorated with lines \( rekhā, i.e. without the brahmasūtra  and the pārśvasūtra\). 

In the middle of this liṅgarūpa  an immovable square column \( yaṣṭi\) is fixed. 

On that thirteen bhūmikās  are made. 7

On top of this is an āmalasāraka

\(= āmalaka?\) and on that again a round column, yaṣṭi, is fixed. This column is decorated with a medallion \( candraka\). 8 In between the bhūmikās  and

the liṅga \(i.e. on the square column?\) the four Lokapālas are situated, Virūḍha, 

Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, Virūpākṣa, and Kubera, with lances \( śūla\) in their hands, wearing armour and ornaments. 9 It is said that in this construction Virūḍha is

Śakra, Dhr̥tarāṣṭra is Yama, Virūpākṣa is Varuṇa, and Kubera is Rājarāja. 

This aiḍūka  is named ‘Prajāhita’; men who worship it obtain happiness and

heaven after death. 

Shah in her commentary emphasizes that this Aiḍūka structure is not a particular deity but is designed to embody the whole universe. As to the names of the Lokapālas she remarks: ‘These are known to Buddhist mythology as the four Buddhist Yakṣas who do the work of the Lokapālaṣ’10 Shah assumes that 4 Harṣacarita \(HC\* 6 p. 300\): kalpitaśokaśalye sudhānicayacite citācaityacihne, which

that takes away the grieve of bereavement, taught to king Muṇḍa. 

6 For the Sanskrit text of VDhP 3.84.1–15 see Appendix. 

7 It is unclear whereon exactly, the li ˙

ngarūpa  or the yaṣṭi; liṅgarūpa  is neuter, yaṣṭi

feminine. tasyopariṣṭāt \(84.5c\) refers to the liṅgarūpa, unless we assume double sandhi. 

A similar sloppy construction is seen in 6a. Shah cites Kramrish, who interprets the bhūmikās  as ‘steps’. 

8 I read samārdhacandra◦ instead of samārkacandra◦, meaning that the medallion is situated in the middle of the horizontal \( sama\) crescent mooṇ The thirteen bhūmikās  and

the āmalasāraka  are said to represent the 14 bhuvanas. The li ˙

nga  represents Maheśvara, 

the round column Pitāmaha and the square column Janārdana. The three platforms

represent the three guṇas. 

9 In accordance with the oldest MS C, I take ‘the apparel of the sun \(Sūrya\)’ in 12b

singular, corresponding with Kubera. 

10 See Barhut Inscriptions \(CII II, pṭ ii\), p.73:

As Kupira \( Kubera\) and Viruḍaka \( Virūḍhaka\) are the guardians of the Northern and

Southern region respectively we can assume with certainty that on the lost corner pillars of both the quadrants Virūpakkha and Dhataraṭṭha, the guardians of the West

and East, were represented, each one with two companions. Vogel, Indian Serpent-

the aiḍūka  of the VDhP is without ashes or bones and is therefore acceptable to be worshipped, whereas originally such monuments would have contained bones or relics. This plausible assumption as well as the naming of the four Buddhist Lokapālas strongly suggest that Buddhist examples lie at the root of the Purāṇa’s description of the aiḍūka.11 We may add that the use of the word aiḍūka, instead of eḍūka, could also point to this, meaning ‘derived from/related to/of the nature of the eḍūka’, not the original \(Buddhist\) ‘ossuary’. 

The

view that sees in the aiḍūka  an appropriation by the author of the VDhP of a Buddhist architectural tradition finds support in the outcome of Gustav Roth’s investigation into the Symbolism of the Buddhist Stūpa. 12

The eḍūka

We have some more literary evidence regarding the eḍūka. The Mahāvastu

refers to an anticipated funerary monument of Princess Sudarśanā, who tells

her mother:

Mother, when the seven Kṣatriyas, after fighting one another, shall have caused my death, then, after having performed the cremation rite and collected the bones, you should next erect for me a monument \( elūkā\). And at the entrance of that

monument you should plant a karṇikāra tree. Thereupon, when the first month of the rainy season has come after the hot season, that karṇikāra tree will be wrapped in a golden colour as it is covered abundantly by blossoms. Then you shall remember me, thinking to yourself: ‘I had a daughter whose complexion was beautiful \( sudarśanā\) like this’. 13

Lore, p. 212, is of the opinion that the names of the four world-guardians do not occur in the older Pāli texts, but they are given in the Mahāsamayasutta \(D II, 257–258\)

and in the āṭānāṭiyasutta \(D III, 197 ff.\) in accordance with their fixed distribution in the four directions. 

In the Aiḍūka construction it seems that Virūḍha represents the East \(= Śakra\) and

Dhr̥tarāṣṭra the South \(= Yama\). This would make a pradakṣiṇā: Virūḍha East, 

Dhr̥tarāṣṭra South, Virūpākṣa West, Kubera North. This is a deviation from the standard Buddhist doctrine; cf. Banerjea 1956, 521 f.:

In Buddhist mythology too we find a group of four divine beings associated with the four principal quarters, and the Sanskrit Buddhist texts give us a stereotyped list of four; they are Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, the Gandharva king \(east\), Virūḍhaka, the king

of the Kumbhāṇḍas \(south\), Virūpākṣa, the Nāga monarch \(west\) and Vaiśravaṇa, 

the Yakṣa king \(north\). They are the Catur-mahārājas of some Buddhist texts, and Pāṇini seems to have had them in his mind when he referred to their bhaktas in one of his sūtras \(P 4.3.99\): mahārājāṭṭha˜

ṇ 

11 If we compare this description with that of the Divyāvadāna \(see below, ṇ 77 on p. 428\)

we observe another correspondence: the stairs at the four sides. The three bhadrapīṭhas may reflect the three medhīs  or platforms \(see Roth 1980, 200 f.\). 

12 Roth 1980. In a Postscriptum Roth draws a comparison between the description in the VDhP and some Buddhist texts and refers, for instance, to a bronze stūpa \(ca. 10th

century\) kept in the Patna Museum \(Plate XIV/3; cf. op. ciṭ  208\). Roth concludes that the VDhP ‘follows an older Buddhist tradition which is found in the above quoted chapters of Caityavibhāgavinayodbhāvasūtra, Stūpalakṣaṇakārikāvivecana, and Kriyā-

saṁgraha’ \( op. ciṭ  200\).

Evidently the word used here for the monument, elūkā, refers to a funerary

monument of laymeṇ Emeneau, discussing the word in a review of Mayrhofer’s kewa, 14 and referring to Edgerton’s bhsd ṣv. eluka, remarks: The word in Buddhist texts seems clearly to be eluka  or elūka  and to mean ‘mon-

ument containing the ashes or bones of a dead person’. \[. . . \] Considering the clear meaning in the Buddhist texts \(bones are specifically mentioned in one passage\) and the l  of the word there, one must at least consider again Kittel’s old suggestioṇ . . of connection with the Dr\[avidian\] words for ‘bone’. . . . 

Shah quotes Helmer Smith who derives it from the Canarese root el.- ‘to stand up, to rise’. 15 This meaning of the word eḍūka  is confirmed by the Amarakośa, 

in which it occurs in connection with ‘wall’: ‘An eḍūka  is \(a wall\) wherein bones

are placed, i.e. an ossuary.’ 16

From the evidence surveyed above it seems to appear that the erection of funerary monuments was not strictly limited to the heterodox traditions. However, being from its inception connected with the remains of the dead, the eḍūka

Kane IV, 255 ṇ 580 draws our attention to a passage in the Brahmanical literature where a tree and eḍūka  are mentioned. It concerns a passage found in Aparārka’s commentary

on the Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti \(vol. II, pp. 885 f.\) ascribed to the Brahmapurāṇa: It is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and water, that a puṣkaraka tree should be planted there or an eḍūka \(a structure\) should be built over iṭ

15 Shah VDhP p. 173. She further speculates about the etymology and concludes: ‘If this is correct, it would lead us to the conclusion that the Deśya word eḍūka, which later

on became sanskritised and accepted in sanskrit lexicons, originally must have meant a

√

structure containing bone relicṣ’ \(p. 172\). Allchin 1957, 3 refers to Tamil iṭu, meaning

‘bury’ since very early times and iṭu-kāṭu, ‘burial ground’. The same author refers to the ubiquitous stone cists found in Dravida country: ‘The stone cists have been found to contain almost every possible combination of relics including the collected bones of many personṣ’. . . ‘The cist was sometimes built on the bare rock, or sometimes partly or entirely buried in a piṭ

was, for obvious reasons, not much in vogue in orthodox circles, as the following passage demonstrates. Mahābhārata 3.188 pretends to describe the period

of total disruption at the end of the Kali Age, but, as is often the case with such passages, its hidden agenda seems to be to attack contemporaneous practices. 17

And this perverted world shall be upside down: at the dissolution of the yuga \(people\) will venerate charnel-houses \( eḍūkas\) and abandon the gods, \(whereas\)

śūdras will not serve the brahmins. When the yuga expires, the earth shall no longer be decorated by temples, but marked by charnel-houses \( eḍūkas\): in the

hermitages of the great seers, in the settlements of brahmins, in the dwellings of the gods, in hallowed places \( caitya\), and in the abodes of the Nāgas. That is the

sign that the yuga has come to an end. When men, fierce and devoid of dharma, will be constantly eating meat and drinking liquor, then the yuga will collapse. 18

Although not popular with the orthodox, the custom of erecting a monument for the dead goes back to megalithic times and was partly sanctioned by Vedic literature. 19 Kane, dealing with funerary rites, observes \(IV, 255\): ‘It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages, viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites \(called Śāntikarma\) and erection of a monument

over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case.’ Caland in his Die altindischen Todten- und Bestattungsgebräuche describes this optional procedure. On the ground where the cremation had taken place \( śmaśāna\) a

plot of land of the size of a man is demarcated, square or, according to others, round. The land is ritually ploughed.

Der Aschenkrug wird darauf vernichtet \( op. ciṭ §105\). . . . . Die eigentliche Schichtung kann jetzt einen Anfang nehmen \( op. ciṭ §107\).. . . Jetzt ist die citi  mittelst der ‘raumfüllenden’ Ziegel zur erforderlichen Höhe aufzuschichteṇ Ihre Anzahl ist abhängig von der Größe, die man der citi  geben will; meistens ist die Gesammtzahl der Ziegel tausend \( op. ciṭ §112\). 20

Despite the attention paid to these barrows \( citi\) in the Kalpaśāstra, we, pace

Giuseppe de Marco, find little hard evidence that this Vedic tradition was continued in historic times in classical North India. Disposal of the remains in holy water \( tīrtha\)—be it the ashes/bones, or the body as a whole \(as in the case of ascetics\)—seems to have replaced the older practices of inhumation and exposure. 21 This tallies with the virtual absence in the Mahābhārata of

any reference to the erection of monuments to the dead, apart from the quoted passage regarding the alleged worship of eḍūkas. 22

The Sanskrit literature knows, however, yet another type of monument to commemorate the deceased; it is said to appertain in particular to the kṣatriya class. 23 The Pratimānāṭaka, traditionally ascribed to Bhāsa, describes how Bharata on his return to Ayodhyā pauses at a building, outside the city, tucked

away amidst the trees, on the walls of which sandal imprints of hands are found, of which the doors are decorated with floral wreaths, and where he finds offerings \( bali\), evident from flowers and parched rice grains that are well-arranged, and a floor strewn with sand. 24 Little wonder that, when he also fails to see a dhvaja  or other emblem of a god \( cihna\), Bharata is puzzled: could this be a ‘house of the gods’ \( devakula\)? Inside there are images, well made and true to life, which makes one believe that they are human beings. And this they 20 Caland 1896; cf. Falk 2000, 75 ff. Saindon 2000. 

21 Cf. de Marco 1987, 219 ff. 

22 In an interesting study, Disposal of the Dead in the Mahābhārata, Tiwari 1979, 23 f. 

observes the following:

It has already been remarked that the Mahābhārata seems to contain no clear refer-

ence to the rite of asthi-sañcayana, which formed an essential element of antyeṣṭi  as described in several ritual texts. This rite involved the collection of charred bones and ashes some days after the cremation and disposal of them in various ways—hanging in a bundle on the branch of a tree, or recremating in some special cases, or depositing at the foot of a tree, or, more generally, burying them in a hole dug in the ground and sometimes also building some kind of memorial mound \( śmaśāna\) over them. 

Apparently this practice gradually went out of vogue, and, already towards the close of the epic, the custom of depositing the bones in holy river had probably become more commoṇ 

23 The South-Indian Dīptāgama Paṭala 52, Kṣatriyasthāpana, gives a description of the installation of images of the king, his queen and the ministers \(Dīptāgama II, 347–56\). 

For the South-Indian tradition of royal portraiture see also Lefèvre 2006, Part 3 Ch. 8.

prove to be. Bharata has come upon a statue gallery, pratimāgr̥ha, in which

images of the deceased kings of the Ikṣvāku race are set up; his uncertainty seems to indicate that it is an uncommon phenomenoṇ 25 The keeper tells him that a brahmin should not salute or worship them as they do not represent gods \( daivata\), but kings \( kṣatriya\) who have passed away. When Bharata discovers an image of Daśaratha among them, he understands that his father has died. 26

The problem with this testimony, however, is its date and place of origiṇ 

The issue has been discussed by many scholars, and Tieken 1993, summarizing much of this discussion, argues that the so-called ‘Trivandrum Plays’, to which the Pratimānāṭaka belongs, may be late and of South-Indian origiṇ27

The archaeology of the funerary monument

If we turn to archaeology, it becomes immediately clear that, despite the literary evidence, material testifying to the actual practice of erecting funerary monuments in the Brahminical tradition in ancient India is rare. 28 A. Ghosh 25 Pratimānāṭaka 3.6. 

26 Pratimānāṭaka 3.7–9. 

27 On account of a formal statistical analysis, van der Geer 1998 dates this particular play to the 4th or 5th century ad \( op. ciṭ  177\) and also thinks a South Indian author most likely \( op. ciṭ 

187\). 

The Pratimānāṭaka may reflect a South-Indian custom. That

South-Indian funerary practices differed from the ‘Aryan’ North may also be deduced from the description of a cemetery in the early Tamil epic Maṇimekalai \(Daniélou 1989, 

24 ff.\). The practice to install commemorative images of Śivabhaktas is prescribed in the relatively late South-Indian redaction of the Ajitāgama, not known to \(12th-century\)

Aghoraśiva \(Goodall 2004, cx\), which text tells us that this sort of images may be installed at holy places or in a Śiva temple where they should be worshipped. According to Dīptāgama 52.59 images of bhaktas should follow the rules of the images of the king \(above, ṇ 23 on p. 410\). The Ajitāgama gives the following description 63.39–42:

The editor of the Ajitāgama, ṇr̥ Bhatt, quotes the Acintya- and refers to the Uttarakāmikāgama ad loc.  The underlying idea seems to be that these bhaktas have reached sārūpya  with Śiva and can therefore be depicted with four arms, though they keep the distinct \(iconographic\) characteristics of the devotee: two hands forming an añjali, as a

true devotee should, two others holding li ˙

nga  and chowry. 

Along with this South Indian custom one may consider funerary practices in Indianized Southeast Asia. Thus there is substantial evidence that in Cambodia as well as on Java and Bali temples and statues were erected for deceased kings and their families; see i.a. 

Cœdès 1940, 320 ff. \(I thank Arlo Griffiths for this reference\). 

28 Cf. Malamoud 1982, 442:

Or, la suppression physique du cadavre s’accompagne de procédures qui aboutissent à l’abolition du souvenir de la personne du morṭ Notons d’abord qu’après la dispersion des restes du défunt nul tombeau, bien sûr, mais aussi nul cénotaphe n’est mis en place qui pourrait prolonger son existence terrestre en lui réservant un morceau d’espace.

Hans Bakker

observes the following: ‘As by the time cremation had virtually replaced inhumation there is hardly any archaeological evidence of the practices concerning the disposal of the dead. \[The Buddhist \(and Jaina\) stūpas  form an entirely

different category.\]’ 29 From the following it will emerge that this sweeping statement should be qualified on two points: the Buddhist and Jain customs are not so categorically different from the Hindu ones \(see p. 425\), and there is more archaeological evidence of Hindu funerary practice than supposed by Ghosh \(see below, p. 430\). 

In discussions regarding this apparent absence reference is often made to excavations at Lauriya–Nandangarh \(W. Champaran District, Bihar\), 30 which, since ṭ Bloch’s excavations in 1905, 31 are supposed to show ‘Vedic burial mounds’. Ghosh assesses the evidence unearthed by Bloch, refers to the reexamination by ṇG. Majumdar, 32 whose excavation he himself continued after the demise of Majumdar, and concludes:

He \(i.e. Majumdar\) found that all of them were earthen burial memorials with burnt-brick revetment, two being faced with a brick lining in a double tier, so that there was no justification for regarding them as more earthen barrows. He also pointed out that the gold leaves found by Bloch \[containing a female figure in frontal pose\] had their exact replica in the stūpa  at Piprawa, which is definitely a

Buddhist stūpa  of 300 bc or earlier̥ The respective Lauriya stūpas  might be of a

comparable date and there is nothing to connect them with Vedic burial rites. 33

Nevertheless, the question is justified whether cremation completely replaced inhumatioṇ It certainly did not for certain categories of persons such as children, yogins or ascetics \( yati\), and pregnant womeṇ 34 The evidence of eighteen Gandhāra reliefs containing depictions of cemeteries and burial monuments discussed by de Marco 1987 seems to indicate that burial was still customary long after the Vedic period at least in certain parts of India and for certain categories of persons. We shall come back to this below \(p. 424 ff.\). 

In order to improve our understanding of the phenomenon of memorials to the dead it might be useful to distinguish between categories of monuments.

Temples dedicated to a particular god, erected in order to transfer the merit thereof to the deceased, often recorded in epigraphs. Many temples may actually fall into this category, for which there is, to the best of my knowledge, no 29 Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology I, p. 267.

34 De Marco 1987, 221–226 discusses various categories of people liable to be buried and evidence of the burialgrounds. As to the burial of pregnant women he concludes \( op. ciṭ 

222, ṇ 59\): ‘Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the practice of burial for deceased pregnant women, even if not explicitly traceable in the texts, has always been considered, from an unspecifiable epoch, as both necessary and legitimate.’ Cf. Kane IV, 227–233.

specific Sanskrit word, but which in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription

is referred to with the generic term prāsāda. 35 A special relation between the

god and the deceased indicates that this type of buildings has a commemorative function, at least for contemporaries, and I therefore propose to refer to this type of monuments as ‘memorials’. 

2

Sanctuaries/buildings that contain an image/images of the deceased. They are known in Sanskrit as pratimāgr̥ha, or ‘statue galleries’. 

3

Hero-stones, including satī-stones, which are found in particular in the Deccan in great number, and which commemorate the place where a heroic death took place. They could be classified as ‘memorial stones’. 

4

Structures that have some formal correspondences with the funerary monuments of the following category \(5\), but which do not contain the actual mortuary remains; these seem to have been described in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa under the name of aiḍūka. 

5

Burial mounds or sepulchral monuments that actually contain the ashes and/or bones, or the bodies of the deceased, in Sanskrit literature referred to as eḍūka. 

Memorials

This category may be illustrated by two examples, the first one being the Vākāṭaka temples on the top of the Rāmagiri, the other a temple built by Skandagupta for his father Kumāragupta in Bhitarī. 36

As I have argued elsewhere \(Bakker 1992b and 1997, 30 f.\), the 5th-century Vākāṭaka temples on the Rāmagiri were erected to transfer merit to the dead. 

The choice of the temple-deity was not arbitrary; it was made on the basis of an envisaged similarity or affinity of the god and the deceased queen and kings \(Bakker 1992b\). This theory builds on the evidence of the inscription found in the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on the Rāmagiri, in which Prabhāvatī’s daugh-

ter, Princess Atibhāvatī, widow of Ghaṭotkacagupta, records the good works she has done. The text is very fragmentary and problematic. A translation of the relevant passage may run as follows. 

Then \(the princess\) commissioned the splendid ‘Master of Prabhāvatī’, \(the image

of the\) Lord of the World, within the temple, for the sake of undecaying merit of 35 Above, p. 125; Bakker 1997, 167. Granoff 1992, 187 refers to a temple built after the cremation of the Jain minister Vastupāla on Mt Śatruñjaya called ‘Svargārohanaprāsāda’. 

Granoff 1992 \( passim\) proves that the building of memorial temples was just as popular in Jainism as it was in Hinduism. 

This type of memorial temple seems to be

referred to under the C¯

ol.as as pal.l.i-paṭai  in Tamil: ‘temple erected in memory of kings’. 

Huntington 1985, 310 conjectures that the famous Dharmarāja shrine in Māmallapuram

may have been such a pal.l.i-paṭai, since it contains a portrait image of the Pallava king Nr̥siṁhavarman I himself on its southern face. 

36 The wide-spread practice to install li ˙

ngas  in commemoration of the deceased, which could be comprised in the category of ‘memorial’, is left out of account here. An example hereof is e.g. attested by the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61, above, p. 287, below, p. 494. For this practice in Nepal, centering around Paśupatinātha, see

Mirnig 2016.

On account of this evidence we assume that either the Kevala–Narasiṁha Tem-

ple, in which the inscription is found to date, or the adjacent Trivikrama Temple, to which the inscription originally may have belonged, 38 had been erected around the middle of the 5th century to transfer merit to the Vākāṭaka queen

Prabhāvatī Guptā, who may have died a little earlier̥ This queen took great pride in her descent from two famous families, her father being the Gupta emperor Candragupta II, her mother Kuberanāgā born in the Nāga House and

belonging to the Dhāraṇa gotra \(Bakker 1997, 12\). It may therefore not be coincidence that in front of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple entrance an image

of a serpent, Nāga, is found. We will come back to this below, \(p. 434\). 

A reference to another specimen of a memorial temple erected to transfer merit to a deceased king can be found in the Bhitarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta. 39 The inscription of Prabhāvatī’s nephew, Skandagupta, is not

without difficulties. The temple to which it may refer has been excavated, 40

but the image installed has not been found. Though somewhat elliptical, verse 12 may be read as follows. 

Hence the manifestation of the Lord \(Bhagavat\), this \(image/manifestation\) here \(i.e. Kumārasvāmin\) and that which here has been consigned \(to it\) \(i.e. the grāma\), he \(i.e. Skandagupta\) has destined both for the merit of \(his\) father, since he is determined upon meriṭ 41

The inscription tells us that Skandagupta installed an image, probably of Vāsudeva and possibly named Kumārasvāmin, 42 a deity who is said in verse 10

to be a great archer, Śārṅgin, and as such reflects the qualities of the emperor 37 Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple Inscription lines 11–14: Bakker & Isaacson 1993, 54 \(above, pp. 125 f.\); Bakker 1997, 166 f.; Bakker 2010c \(above, p. 354, v. 21\).

and his father̥ In verse 8, in which his victory over the Hūṇas is reported, the

twanging sound of a bow \( śārṅgadhvaniḥ \) is referred to in a simile that seems

to express Skandagupta’s prowess. For the maintenance of the image/temple Skandagupta assigned a community/village \( grāma\) to the deity, that is to say, 

he exempted this community from taxes, so that its surplus production could be used for worship and maintenance. Both beneficial acts were performed to increase the merit of the deceased father, Kumāragupta. 

Pratimāgr̥has

When searching for galleries where effigies of kings were installed, the pratimāgr̥ha, our second category, two sites spring to mind: Māṭ near Mathurā, and a cave at Nāṇeghāṭ, a pass leading from the Konkan to Junnar \(Pune Disṭ\). The latter site has been discussed by Ajay Mitra Shastri. In this cave two sets of inscriptions are found: 43

One of them, a large but fragmentary one is inscribed partly on the left and partly on the right walls. On its \[i.e., the cave’s\] back wall were put up statues of eight personages which have all disappeared almost completely and over their heads there were inscribed what may be called labels of which also only six are now extant enabling us to identify the figures originally carved below them. Going by the preserved labels there were installed statues of Simuka Sātavāhana, the

founder of the dynasty, queen Nāganikā and her spouse king Sātakani \(Sātakarṇi\), 

Kumāra \(prince\) Bhāya, Mahāraṭhi Tranakayira, Kumāra  Hakusiri and kumāra Sātavāhana. 44

According to Shastri the gallery was initiated by King Kr̥ṣṇa, who set up the image of his elder brother Simuka, and continued by Vediśrī, who set up the images of his father and mother Sātakarṇi and Nāganikā. Shastri argues, on

the basis of the Pratimānāṭaka, that all images were erected after the death

of the person involved. If his identification of these early Sātavāhana kings

is correct, it would mean that this pratimāgr̥ha  predates the one at Māṭ and

therefore cannot have been inspired by the Kuṣāṇa example. The epigraphs found in Nāṇeghāṭ do not give any reason to believe that these images were worshipped. The long inscription enumerates many Vedic sacrifices and their dakṣiṇās, but is silent as to the images. 

The situation seems different at Māṭ. The archaeological remains of a build-

ing and the inscribed images of the Kuṣāṇa kings Vima/Vema \(Kadphises\), Kaniṣka, Huviṣka \(?\) and others, belong to the most well-known India has produced. The epigraphs have been competently dealt with by Lüders \(posthumously published by Janert 1961\). The building that housed these images is referred to as devakula  in the inscriptions themselves. About this Lüders remarks:

43 For these inscriptions see also Sircar SI I, 190–197. 

44 Shastri 1998, 102. Cf. Verardi 1983, 244–50. 



416

Hans Bakker

There can be little doubt that the devakula  at the Māṭ site, similarly to ‘Bhāsa’s’

devakula, served chiefly as a hall for the statues of members of the royal Kuṣāṇ 

family, although, as proved by the life-size image found together with the Kaniṣka statue, images of gods were mixed up with them. 45

The latter concessive clause may mark a significant difference with the situation in Nāṇeghāṭ and the depiction in the Pratimānāṭaka. It may account for the term devakula  used in the Māṭ inscriptions. ‘Bhāsa’ speaks also about a

devakula, but that word is used when Bharata does not yet know whether he has to do with a ‘house of the gods’ or noṭ When he discovers the true nature of the monument the text uses the word pratimāgr̥ha.46 Another important

difference may be related to this. Lüders remarks, 

In one respect, however, the collection of the Kuṣāṇ statues seems to have differed from the gallery described in the Pratimānāṭaka. Bhāsa tells us that only deceased

kings were honoured by setting up their images. This restriction does not seem to have prevailed in the case of the Kuṣāṇ devakula. The present inscription was engraved on the pedestal of a statue, and we may reasonably assume that, in addition to the repair of the devakula, the gift of the statue was recorded in the inscriptioṇ The statue cannot have represented the grandfather of Huviṣka, nor is it likely that it was the second image of Kaniṣka. As the donation was made for the increase of the life and strength of Huviṣka, it becomes very probable that it represented that king, but that benedictory phrase shows at the same time that the statue was set up during the lifetime of Huviṣka. 47

From this combined evidence it may appear that the images of the Kuṣāṇa kings were worshipped like those of gods, even when still alive. The true nature of the devakula  was the subject of an interesting essay by Gérard Fussman, who compared the Māṭ sanctuary with a similar one in Surkh-Kotal, also containing images of Kuṣāṇa kingṣ48 He argues that we should conceive of these temples as ‘shrines where the king, his family and high officials worshipped the deity who protects the king and his family, not the temple of the godlike king’. 49

A devakula  is, according to the French scholar, ‘a royal family shrine’. 50 This 45 Lüders 1961, 144. 

46 Pratimānāṭaka 3. 5, 6. Cf. ibid.  3.1 paḍimāgeha, 3.13 idaṁgr̥ haṁtat pratimānr̥ pasya. 

It has to be admitted, though, that the keeper is called devakulika. 

47 Lüders 1961, 144 f. 

48 Fussman 1989; cf. Rosenfield 1993, 154–172. Shastri 1998, 109 refers to similar ‘small sanctuaries in the Swāt region of Afghanistan’. 

49 Fussman 1989, 199. 

50 Fussman 1989, 198. Cf. Frantz Grenet 2015, 209 f. discussing the Rabatak Temple and its inscription:

The temple is said to contain images of Kani˘

ska’s three direct ancestors and prede-

cessors \(Kujula Kadphises, Vima Taktu, Vima Kadphises\), and of himself: as in the Surkh Kotal temple, and also at Māṭ in Mathura, another royal foundation, the royal

statues are commemorative and not in themselves an object of worship \(despite the enduring theory of the Kushan dynastic cult\). In the Rabatak inscription gods, clearly distinguished from deceased kings, are mentioned in two contexts. 



21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 417

connotation accords well with the use of the term in the Vākāṭaka inscriptions, 

in which the state sanctuaries are referred to as ‘places’ \( sthāna\) of the devakula

\(above, p. 332\). However, the idea of installing in these sanctuaries life-size images of the royal family itself is clearly imported into North India. Fussman’s contention that these royal images were not meant for worship in their own right remains open to doubt; the word devakula  may have been used precisely because the Kuṣāṇa kings thought of themselves, or wanted their subjects to believe that they were members of the divine family \( kula\). 51

Their title, 

devaputra, also seems to endorse this. 52 Apparently the Brahmanical tradition represented by ‘Bhāsa’ found this too much to swallow, in view of the shift from devakula  to pratimāgr̥ha, and, to judge by our archaeological evidence, the idea of a statue gallery as a whole became obsolete, at least in North India during the period under review. 53

Memorial stones

The third category, ‘hero-stones’, has been the subject of a seminar at Dharwad, the papers of which have been edited by s. Settar & Günther d. Sontheimer \(1982\). 

In this volume ḍr̥ Patil studies The Origin of Memorial Stones. Patil \( op. ciṭ  48\) observes that ‘. . . a memorial stone, in its basic conception, is commemorative in character, raised in memory or honour of the dead, and did not form part of the actual practice of the disposal of the dead’. 

Nevertheless Patil traces its origin back to this very practice by referring to early Buddhist monuments containing mortuary deposits, because in some of them a wooden post was found \(Lauriya-Nandangarh\), whereas an inscription in another Buddhist monument \(Sui Vihar\) seems to refer to such a post as a yaṣṭi  raised in honour of the deceased \(see below, p. 426\). Typical of this type of stones seems to be that they contain a visual representation or symbol referring to the fate of those commemorated, in addition to, occasionally, a brief texṭ 

Early specimens of ‘memorial stones’ as defined above seem to have been the so-called chāyāstambha  or chāyāskambha \(‘shade-pillar’\) from Nāgārjunakoṇḍa

51 Von Hinüber 2004, 172 ṇ 234. Rosenfield 1993, 202 thinks that Iran is the most likely source of the tendency to deify the Kuṣāṇa kings. The term devakula  literary means the

‘family seat of the god\(s\)’. When one installs a life-size image of oneself in this ‘seat’, does that not suggest that one wants to be regarded as part of that family? 

52 Cf. Rosenfield 1993, 202 ff. Differently Grenet 2015, 209 ṇ 27: The Kushan royal title ‘son of the god\(s\)/son of the lord\(s\)’, Bactr̥ bagopouro, Indian devaputra, are no more real proof of a claim to divine filiation as theopat¯

or  on some

Arsacid coins, probably corresponding to a genuine Parthian word \*bagpuhr̥ It can just as well allude to the legitimate royal filiation, eventually to the divine electioṇ 

A critical examination of this difficult issue is found in Verardi 1983. 

53 Cf. above, ṇ 27 on p. 411. Granoff 1992, 190 reports that ‘. . . images of tīrtha ˙

nkaras

were often made for the welfare of the dead. Bharata’s funerary monument to his father also bears striking resemblances to actual funerary monuments for Jain monks in having a portrait image of the deceased. . . ’ See also below, ṇ 72 on p. 425. Von Hinüber 2004, 172 refers to the inscribed portrait images of Pallava kings and queens \(7th century ad\) in South India \(see above, ṇ 35 on p. 413; Huntington 1985, 310; Lefèvre 2006\).

discussed by H. Sarkar in the same volume. 54 These pillars were raised during the rule of the Ikṣvākus in the third century ad. They commemorate the death of members of the ruling class, religious personages and soldiers. One may serve as an example. King Rudrapuruṣadatta erected in the 11th year of his reign a memorial stone \( chāyakaṁbha\) for his mother, Mahādevī Varmabhaṭā

\(Vaṁmabhaṭā\) belonging to the Bahaphala \(i.e. Br̥hatphalāyana\) gotra, who was the daughter of the Mahākṣatrapa, probably a Śaka king from Ujjaiṇ55

The pillar on which the inscription is found is decorated by one panel depicting the queeṇ The queen ‘is seated on a stool \[and\] holding a mirror in her hand. 

She is dressed like a foreign lady, accompanied by two female attendants’. 56

Sircar \( op. ciṭ  20\) argues that the word chāyā  in this context means ‘image’, 

and thus refers to the portrait of the deceased queen above the inscriptioṇ 57

Most chāyāstambhas  belong to a Buddhist milieu, but this pillar seems to be the only one that ‘was found in the precincts of a Buddhist monastery’ \(Sarkar op. ciṭ  202\). 58

The Śaka connection is reinforced by a find in Paunī, a Sātavāhana site in the

Bhandara District of Maharashtra. The inscription on a memorial pillar \( chāyā-

khaṁbha\) mentions a prince \( kumāra\) Rupiaṁma of the Mahākṣatrapa.59 Shas-

tri \(1998, 66\) does not believe that Rupiaṁma actually ruled over Vidarbha, 

as does Mirashi, but surmises that ‘he might have come over there as a pilgrim as Paunī was an important religious centre, especially for the Buddhists. . . ’. In view of this evidence, Sarkar \(1982, 205\) tentatively suggests that the memorial in this form, i.e. our third category, may have originated in and spread from the area under Śaka rule in the first centuries of the Christian era.

The queen appeared to be dressed like a foreign lady which she really was. . . ’. 

57 For an illustration see Fig. 1 of Sarkar’s contribution to Settar & Sontheimer 1982. The usage of the word chāyā  in this funerary context has a close parallel in the related Greek

, \(‘shade’\). For chāyā  meaning ‘portrait’ see Granoff 2001, 68 ṇ 10. 

58 Another, somewhat later \(5th century?\), specimen of a memorial stone with portrait has been found in Sangsi \(Kolhapur District\). It depicts a funeral scene showing the figure of the queen and attendants. The inscription on it reports the erection of a stone funerary monument \( śailaṁcaityakam\) \(i.e. the slab of stone itself, referred to by idam\) by her loving husband, King Pu. . . , in order to protect/preserve \(her\) merits/virtues.

It is indeed in the Śaka territories that we find corroborative evidence for this hypothesis. It has the form of six ‘long narrow slabs of stone’ that were discovered ‘standing as monuments on a hillock’ at the village Andhau on the Rann of Cutch \(Gujarat\). 60 These stones had been erected in the \(Śaka\) year 52, i.e. ad 130, under the rule of Rāja Rudradāman, who is none other than the Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman I.61 Four stones still carry inscriptions, one of which records that the inscribed slab of stone, referred to as laṣṭi \(=

yaṣṭi\) in the inscription itself, had been erected \( uthāpita\), by Madana for his sister Jeṣṭhavīrā belonging to the Opaśati \(Aupaśatika\) gotra. This Madana erected in the same year similar monuments for his brother r̥ ṣabhadeva and

his wife Yaśodattā, who is called a novice nun \( śrāmaṇerī\). Patil and Sarkar

\( op. ciṭ  54 f., 204 ff.\) discuss a number of similar pillars, all of them from areas ‘where the Śakas were ruling’, and Patil concludes that they are ‘funerary monuments. . . presumably intended to commemorate the dead’. 62 We have no indications that the memorial stones \( yaṣṭis\), such as found in Andhau, marked the spot where mortuary remains were deposited, although this may be deceptive, since the sites have not been subject to archaeological scrutiny. 63 If this is correct, however, and there are no deposits, we are here concerned with funerary monuments that may be thought of as forerunners of the ‘hero-stones’

\(category 3\), not yet carrying a picture; strictly speaking, they should be classified in our fourth category: funerary monuments without mortuary deposits. 

On the other hand, although the term yaṣṭi  is used to refer to these steles, these monuments differ widely from the constructions composed of square and circular yaṣṭis  as described under the heading aiḍūka  in the VDhP. 

Aiḍūkas

Ahicchatra

There exists a brick monument that has been thought to conform to and has been identified as an aiḍūka  in the sense of the VDhP. This is the ‘Śiva temple’

at Ahicchatra \(AC I\), which is, in the words of Agrawala \(Plate 85\): A massive brick structure unique of its kind in North India. On plan it is similar to the quadrangular Buddhist stūpas  raised in several tiers, diminishing upwards like a gigantic staircase. The structure answers closely to what the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa describes as an eḍūka \(sic\) built in three terraces \( bhadra-pīṭhas\), one above the other, with four stepped approaches and surmounted on the top by 60 EI XVI \(1921-22\), 19 ff. 

61 Shastri 1998, 156 f. 

62 Perhaps the stone slab with inscription, in which a Kosala king called Dhana\(deva\) is said to have erected a ketana  for his father Phalgudeva, falls within the same category, as suggested by Shastri 1998, 108 \(see Bakker 1986 I, 21 ṇ 5\). 

63 The Central-Asian tribes of the Alta¨

ı Mountains, variously known as Scyths or Śakas

and related to the Indian Śakas, are known for their extraordinary burial practices. 

Reference may be made to the burial mounds, or ‘kurgan’, found in Pazyryk \(Korolkova 2017; cf. Het Rijk der Scythen, 74 ff.\).

a Śiva-liṅga. The monument, still having a colossal Śiva-liṅga on its top, must therefore be identified as an eḍūka  dedicated to Śiva. 64

Plate 85

Ahicchatra \(AC I\) during excavation \(1940–44\)

The identification of this structure as an eḍūka  or aiḍūka, is open to doubṭ 

Within the structure in AC I a few terracotta sculptured panels were found with depictions of Śaiva mythology, such as Gaṇas destroying Dakṣa’s sacrifice \(No. 298\), a ‘Bhairava’ figure \(No. 300\), and the so-called ‘Dakṣiṇāmūrti’ of Śiva \(No. 302b; below, Plate 149\), which are supposed to have decorated ‘a frieze running round its upper terrace’. 65 The aiḍūka  of the VDhP, on the

64 V.s. Agrawala in Ancient India 4 \(1947–48\), 167. This identification has been taken over by several authors, among whom Shah in the ‘critical notes’ to her edition of the Third Khaṇḍa of the VDhP \(1994\), I p. 405.

other hand, is explicitly not a temple and not dedicated to one god in particular̥ Moreover, there seem to be more terraces than the three bhadrapīṭhas  of the VDhP, whereas there is apparently not a trace of the four Lokapālas, the

thirteen bhūmikās, the āmalasāraka, and, worst, the square and circular yaṣṭis seem to be missing. A note of caution is in place here. I have not visited the site myself and base my assessment on the excavation reports. The ‘colossal Śiva-liṅga’ originally may have been enshrined, as foundation walls found atop the uppermost terrace seem to indicate. In view of these incongruities and uncertainties the structure crowning mound AC I and a similar one at mound AC II may therefore have been more adequately characterized by A. Ghosh who describes them as:

Terraced temples of brick, each terrace made on foundation cells round a square frame, filled with earth. Both of them underwent many restorations and exten-sions resulting in the increase of their dimensioṇ The larger of them \[i.e. AC I\]

was founded on a layer with typical Stratum IV \(Kushan\) pottery and could not therefore have been founded before the early Gupta age. 66

On the other hand, the mass of bricks ordered in a pyramidal, i.e. tapering framework, ending in a column or liṅga  has an outward similarity with the structure described in the VDhP. It could be that Bāṇa \(above, ṇ 4 on p. 406\), 

describing the ‘funerary monument’ \( citācaitya\) of King Prabhākaravardhana

in Thanesar as a ‘mass of bricks’ \( sudhānicaya\) resembling the form of a dart

or needle \( śalya\), was thinking of a monument similar to the one uncovered in Ahicchatra, 300 km to the southeast of Thanesar, 150 km north of Kanauj. 

According to Bāṇa the ashes and bones \( kīkasa\) had been sent off for dispersal in holy places \( tīrthasthāna\), and this too would conform to the description of the aiḍūka  in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, which does not mention nor refers to mortuary deposits. As far as one can tell—the description of this monument in the excavation report being very brief indeed—this would agree with the archaeological state of affairs in AC I, where no mortuary deposits have been reported. 67

Mansar

‘Unique’ as the structure may have appeared to the excavators at the time, I would like to draw attention to a recent excavation that has surprisingly much 66 Ghosh in EIA II, 7. Cf. Shrimali 1983 I, 149: ‘Even if it was an eḍūka, the existing

structure could not be identified with that of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa. The nucleus of the structure appears to be pre-Gupta—even the sizes of the bricks used are those, which were popular in the period between c. 100 bc and c. ad 300.’

67 Ahicchatra has most recently been investigated by Laxshmi Greaves \(2015\). She concludes \(p. 219\):

Neither the shaft at the heart of the monument, nor the foundations of AC I have been fully excavated so we cannot be entirely sure that no mortuary remains exisṭ 

Nevertheless, without further evidence being brought to light, we cannot designate AC I at Ahichhatra an aiḍūka  with any confidence.

in common with the Ahicchatra one. These are the excavations at Mansar: MNS 3 \(Plate 86\). The brick structure uncovered at a mound there, the so-called Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī, has been interpreted by the excavators, who failed to refer to Ahicchatra, as a mixture of Hindu temples and Buddhist stūpas. 

Elsewhere I have shown the untenability of this conflation \(Bakker 2004a\). 

As in Ahicchatra, the Mansar mound shows a series of terraces built of brick, constructed over and against a natural hillock, which makes the whole thing look like a pyramid of brick. 

As in Ahicchatra, the various platforms are

constructed over brick boxes filled with rubble, earth and stones, a construction device also know from stūpa  domes. The mistake the Mansar excavators have made is that they have confounded similarity with identity. Mansar, like Ahicchatra, is definitively a Śaiva sanctuary, identities corroborated at both sites by beautiful 5th-century Śaiva sculptures, of terracotta in Ahicchatra, of red sandstone in Mansar̥ Are we to classify the Mansar structure as an aiḍūka? 

Plate 86

Mansar \(MNS 3\)

The same reasons that speak against such an identification in Ahicchatra also apply to Mansar, but the Mansar site is characterized by some intriguing features of its owṇ 

One of these is ‘the figure of a Puruṣa made of lime’ \(Plate 87\).68 This figure is truly out of the ordinary and various interpretations are possible. In Bakker 2007b and 2009a \(below, p. 458\) I have made a case for seeing this Man 68 Joshi & Sharma 1999-2000, 128. Cf. Bakker 2004a, 81.

of Mansar as part of a construction sacrifice, in which the clay man replaced a human victim. The excavators report that ‘a vedi  in the chest portion with a hole for fixing a yaṣṭi  over it was made \[below, Plate 105\], and an earthen lamp was found nearby’. 69 Two pots have also been found near the knee of the Puruṣa, but we do not know what they may have contained. Could they have been filled with ashes? Near the figure’s left foot a small iron image of a snake was found \(Plate 104\). 

In addition, though not mentioned in the excavation report, during my stay at the site \(1999\) some bones were said to have been recovered from one of the two natural caves in the rock at the northern side of the hill. In the excavation report these caves are identified as a ‘shrine’ and ‘meditation chamber’ \( ibid. 

129\); due to lack of any further information, it is impossible to say with what sort of bones we are concerned and to which period they may have belonged. 

Anyway, there seems to be no intrinsic connection with the brick monument on top of the mound.

Despite the Puruṣa, the urns, the hole to fix a yaṣṭi \(here meaning ‘sacrificial post’ or yūpa\), the alleged bones, and the terraced, pyramidal structure, I would be very reluctant to speak of this temple complex, referred to in inscriptions and seals as ‘Pravareśvara’ \(above, p. 373, Plate 75\) and called a devakulasthāna, 

in terms of an aiḍūka, or eḍūka  for that matter̥ 

For the time being our conclusion should be that so-far there have not been discovered in the Hindu sphere structures that conform, more than superficially, to the description of the aiḍūka  in the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa. 

Funerary monuments with mortuary deposits

It remains to discuss the funerary monuments in which actual mortuary deposits have been found, the eḍūka, our fifth category. 

As has been briefly noted above, Giuseppe de Marco brings together in an interesting article eighteen Gandhāra reliefs in which we find depictions of

funerary monuments. Fifteen of them relate to the Buddhist legend of Sudāya, 

known form the Chinese canoṇ 70

The story is briefly given by Zwalf in his catalogue of Gandhāra Sculpture

in the British Museum \(I, p. 202, ad  225 = below, Plate 88\): A king of Candravatī \(?\), his mind poisoned by the jealousy of his other wives, caused his pregnant youngest wife to be killed and buried. A posthumous son

\[name restored as Sudāya\], however, nourished himself from one breast on a half of his mother’s corpse not decomposed; when he was three the collapse of part of the tomb released him, and when he was six he met the Buddha and became an arhaṭ 

The reliefs depict Sudāya in the tomb

at his mother’s side and his meeting

of the Buddha. The representations

of the tombs themselves, though pre-

served in a Buddhist context, have

nothing intrinsically Buddhist about

them; they may be based on contem-

poraneous examples of funerary mon-

uments in Gandhāra belonging to no

religious persuasion in particular, but

which served the artist to illustrate a

Buddhist legend. The reliefs testify

to the fact that, at least in Gandhāra

Plate 88

and at least in the first centuries of

Kāfir-koṭ \(Gandhāra\)

the Christian era, a pregnant woman, 

Sudāya meets the Buddha

and one who had met a violent death

to boot, was not always cremated. 

70 For a discussion of this source see de Marco 1987, 191 f. ṇ 2. 



21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 425

The funerary monuments shown on the reliefs are divided by de Marco into four types. The most common one \(de Marco: type 1\) is described as a \(closed\)

‘tumulus’ made of bricks. De Marco does not explicitly link this type with the \( loṣṭa\) citi, but it would seem to me that the burial mound made of bricks, known from the Kalpaśāstra, may be considered as its prototype. The other

common type \(de Marco: type 3\) is described as a ‘hut’, ‘ vihāra’, or ‘ caityagr̥ha’. 

De Marco \( op. ciṭ  232\) observes: ‘It is difficult to determine why the funerary monuments displayed on these reliefs are this shape.’ It appears to me that some influence from outside the Indian world could be considered as a possible explanation: the sarcophagus or stone coffin, moulded according to the sim-pliest form of a ‘dwelling’ in the Indian artistic idiom, the kuṭi  or ‘hut’—the heavy, arched cover of the sarcophagus being interpreted as the ‘attic story’ or vault above a cubical chamber̥ 71 However, apart from these reliefs, no archaeological attestation of either of these two types is known to me. The question seems justified whether we are here concerned with a real historic phenomenon or an artistic conventioṇ 

The above two types of tombs are particularly appropriate to burial of the body. This is less obviously the case in the two remaining types \(de Marco’s types 2 and 4\), which consist each of one specimen only \(A-2 and B-10\). In one of these instances \(B-10\), the subject of the Sudāya legend requires the

depiction of a corpse, but the monument seems incongruous \(below, p. 436 and Plate 94\). The other specimen \(A-2\), illustrating the śmaśāna, does not show

a corpse at all. We shall treat these two in more detail below, when we deal with what still remains to be discussed: funerary monuments connected with the remains of cremation, i.e. ashes. It will appear that, if conceived in this way, a link of these two types with other archaeological evidence can be made. 

Since we are particularly concerned with monuments in the Hindu sphere, we will not dwell upon the Buddhist stūpas  at great length. 72 But, since the

Buddhist cult of the stūpa  developed out of more general South-Asian practices 71 See Foekema 2003, 11. Zwalf \( op. ciṭ  I, 202\) describes the tomb on the relief \(Plate 88\) kept in the British Museum \(No. 225 = de Marco’s B-2\) as: ‘The hut is a cubic structure with a high arched roof covered with a leaf pattern and surmounted horizontally along its ridge by a hemi-cylindrical element supporting a large bird; it seems double-roofed like the structures underlying the false gable panel but with the upper part unusually small.’

72 Jaina stūpas  are left out of account altogether̥ Jaina texts refer to stūpas  and ‘stūpa

worship has been depicted in a number of sculptures. . . Actual Jaina stūpas were very

few, but the most important of them was that of Mathurā at Ka ˙

nkālī T

. īlā’ \(Joshi 1989a, 

333\). For this stūpa  and its interpretation see also Folkert 1989. Phyllis Granoff, asked about this subject, kindly wrote to me the following \(email 22-5-05\): In the Jain stories there is no relic worship. The gods take the relics to heaven and worship them there \[cf. Granoff 1992, 189; Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra I, 364\]. In the medieval period stūpas are regularly built for monks and images of the monks are made. They are both worshipped. The story about the first Jain images is that they are funerary images, but the accounts are pretty late \[e.g. Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra I, 365–370\]. It is a very interesting topic. There are also the memorials constructed where Jain monks fasted to death.

of mortuary ritual and disposal of the dead, and the Brahmanical or Hindu tradition evolved from the same breeding ground, it may be informative to begin with an example from the Buddhist fold, the interesting case of the Sui Vihar stūpa  in Bahawalpur \(Pakistan\). 

Sui Vihar

In the remains of this stūpa  a copperplate inscription has been found, dated in the 11th year of the reign of Kaniṣka, i.e. ad 138. The inscription attests the word yaṣṭi  in a funerary context and this time there is an actual connection with mortuary deposits. 

Plate 89

Sui Vihar Stūpa in Bahawalpur

The inscription tells us that the wife of Balanandin, an upasika  who was mis-tress of the vihara, raised in Damana a yaṭhi  for the bhikṣu  Nagadatta and that It seems that in later Jainism the cult of image worship is explained and justified by the doctrine that the images of the tīrtha ˙

nkaras  are actually memorial statues. Granoff 1992, p. 191:

The fact that temples are memorial monuments and images of the tīrtha ˙

nkaras are

funerary statues has a certain appropriateness in the Jain traditioṇ The tīrtha ˙

nkaras

are above all martyrs, who have suffered what others might have found unendurable in their quest for religious salvation: they have also died a special death, in meditation and voluntary renunciation of all food and water̥ 

This ideology did not remain uncontested \(Granoff 1992, pp. 194 f.; 2001, 64 f.\). 



21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 427

the mother of Balajaya, after having established the ‘foundation’ \( pratiṭhana\) of the yaṭhi, donated the ‘enclosure’ \( anuparivara\).73

From the not all too clear description by Major Stubbs quoted by Konow and a drawing in Indian Antiquary \(Plate 89\), 74 it appears that out of an earthen mound rises a brick tower of 15 m high. About half way up the tower is a room of 8 fṭ square, i.e. measuring c. 85 by 85 cm; its height seems to have been 2fṭ, i.e. 60 cm. The inscription was found at the bottom of this chamber, apparently covering a square brick shaft  of 16 inch, i.e. 40 by 40 cm, going down to the mound, i.e. having a length of at least 6 m. In the chamber were found

‘coins, mixed with some pieces of iron, a few beads, fragments of ornaments, all mixed up with ashes and earth’. 75 It is unknown whether the shaft ends precisely at the mound or continues into iṭ The chamber may have been the relic chamber, as Konow surmises, but, in view of the other occurrences of the word yaṣṭi, we cannot follow him when he takes over Hoernle’s suggestion \(Hoernle 1881, 327\) and proposes that the word here refers to the monk’s staff of Nāgadatta ‘set up’ or ‘assumed’ \(like a bishop’s staff\) at the occasion when he assumed ‘a high clerical office’. Rather it would seem, as has been proposed by Schopen, 76 that the yaṣṭi  mentioned refers somehow to the brick shaft on top of which the chamber is found and which forms the central axis or yūpa  of

the monumenṭ If this is the case, the structure of the Sui Vihar monument resembles closely the two mounds M and N of Lauriya-Nandangarh, in which was found, 

A hollow shaft, about 10 iṇ \(25.4 cm\) in diameter, running right through the centre from the bottom up to a little below the deposits of burnt human bones and a gold leaf. The shaft most probably indicates the position of the wooden post which had perished. At the bottom of the mound N, which was dug down to the natural soil, was actually found the stump of a wooden pillar in situ \[Plate 90\]. Significantly 73 This interpretation follows mainly Sircar’s rendering in SI I, 139 f.

Konow in CII II A, 141 and Schopen 1997, 157 suggest that parivāra  here might mean the

room or chamber, i.e. the chamber in which the mortuary deposits and the inscription have been found. I diverge from Sircar et al.  by taking anu  in composito with parivāra, 

a noun related to anuparivārayati: ‘to encircle’ \(see Edgerton’s BHSD ṣv.\).

enough, the Divyāvadāna mentions the setting up of a pillar, called yūpa\[ yaṣṭi\], 

in the interior of the dome. 77 King Devāna ˙

mpiyatissa, Ceylonese contemporary

of Aśoka, is stated in the Mahāva ˙

msa, a Ceylonese text, to have erected a stone

column to mark the site of the Mahāthūpa to be constructed in future by King

Duṭṭhagāmaṇī. 78

It remains uncertain whether the brick

shaft in the Sui Vihar monument origi-

nally enclosed a wooden column, though

the use of the word yaṣṭi  in the in-

scription strongly suggests thaṭ 

If

this is the case, it may be conjectured

that the yaṣṭipratiṣṭhāna  that was built refers to the still present brick ‘casement of the column’. 79 The building ac-

tivity described in the inscription may

thus be conceived as follows:

On an

earthen mound a wooden pole or col-

umn \( yaṣṭi\) of a diameter of c. 40 cm and

a height of 6 m was erected \( āropayati\)

by Balanandin’s wife; then the brick

casement \( yaṣṭipratiṣṭhāna\) around the

column was built \( sthāpayitvā\) by the

mother of Balajaya; subsequently the

same mother donated \( dadāti\), on top

of the casement or shaft, a chamber or

Plate 90

safe \( anuparivāra\), containing the coins, 

Wooden pillar

ornaments, etc., and the remains of

Lauriya-Nandangarh, mound N

Nāgadatta, after which she had it all

dedicated, as recorded in the inscription

The second yaṣṭi  is clearly the post on top of the dome \( aṇḍa\). The yūpayaṣṭi  is the

pole within the aṇḍa. 

78 Mitra 1971, 24 ṇ 12. Cf. Bloch 1906–07, 123, plate xl \(= Plate 90\). A difference between the shaft in Lauriya and Sui Vihar is that the one in the latter site is square and made of bricks, whereas the one in Lauriya is circular, apparently informed by the wooden column itself. 

79 If pratis

. ṭhāna  would have its common meaning and refers to the ‘pedestal’ or ‘foundation’

of the yaṣṭi, the inscription does not record the exact sequence of building activities; in that case anuparivāra  may refer to the casement \(plus chamber?\). 



21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 429

per se. This must have been the cardinal phase of the constructioṇ The enveloping brick construction, which remains today in the form of a ‘tower’, and which always may have had a more tower- than dome-like appearance, 80 was built after the donation recorded in the inscriptioṇ 

It is evident that in the case of Sui Vihar we are concerned with a monument belonging to our fifth category: funerary monuments containing ashes of the deceased. Is anything similar to be found in the non-heterodox traditions? Or, we may ask, what had become of the Vedic option to build a citi, a pile of bricks over the bones and ashes? The citi  may have occasionally lived on in burial mounds as these are attested in the Gandhāra reliefs, but when

the Mahābhārata \(above, ṇ 18 on p. 409\) describes the situation at the end of the Kali Age by saying that eḍūkas  have replaced temples, this expresses the concern of the author that too many people are being converted to heterodox religions, 81 not the fear that eḍūkas  would eventually be worshipped all-out

by those who were supposed to belong to the Brahmanical traditioṇ The few Gandhāra reliefs aside, evidence of monuments containing mortuary deposits belonging unambiguously to the Hinduized tradition in the period under investigation is very rare indeed. 

The archaeology of the śmaśāna

We shall leave the monuments aside for the moment and will focus on archaeological sites that attest the practice of cremation and inhumatioṇ In his Burial Practices in Ancient India, Singh \(1970, 131\) sums up the situation of iron-age burials in North India as follows:

Evidence regarding the disposal of the dead during this period has been obtained from Sonepur, Rajgir and Lauria Nandangarh—all in Bihar; Rajghat \(district Varanasi, U.P.\) and Amreli in Gujaraṭ Besides, a large number of megalithic graves, tentatively datable to this period and later, have been located in the Vindhyan ranges, Chotanagpur plateau, the Aravalli ranges and north-western India. 

The predominant mode of the disposal of the dead seems to be cremation and a limited quantity of charred human bones have been found buried either in urns or pits in the habitation-area itself. 

80 See Franz 1978, 1–18, Figs. 1–17 illustrating the ‘Turmstupa’. 

81 Allchin 1957, 1:

Since Lassen it has been generally accepted that this description of the Kali-yuga refers to the spread of Buddhist practices and the popular desertion of Brahmanical temples. 

This is not to say, however, that the composer of this passage was exclusively thinking of Buddhism. He might have lashed out at all pan-Indian practices frowned upon by the orthodox that involved the erection of monuments over mortuary remains. Eḍūka  thus

seems to be a wider term than, for instance, stūpa, and it clearly has here, if not in all

cases where it occurs, a pejorative connotation \(cf. discussions in Goswamy 1980, 5 ff.; de Marco 1987, 228 f.\).

One of the major sites seems to have been missed by Singh, who does not refer to the excavations at Ujjaiṇ 

The Kumhāra T

. ekd

.ī in Ujjain

The archaeological findings at the Kumhāra T

. ekḍī in Ujjain are interesting

enough to deserve our attentioṇ This mound has been the subject of a preliminary exploration by M.B. Garde in the season of 1938–39. It is a longish mound of about 67 m long, 33 m wide and 3 m high. Trial excavations exposed about forty-two skeletons, some of them laying on their bellies others on their backs, most of them north-south with the head towards the north, but two of them with heads pointing to the southwest \(below, Plate 127\). 82 Garde reports the following \(AAR 1938–39, 16\):

One large urn with the neck broken off, another small urn complete, and pieces of two or three large urns were found buried in the midst of skeletons. The large urn contained a few bones, ashes and smaller pottery mostly cups and dishes. The contents of the small urn consisted of ashes and bones. A large stone mortar and quite a number of stone pedestals were found in association with the burials. \[. . . \]

Innumerable fragments of large and small jars, cups and dishes with which the mound is literally made up can be easily explained by this custom of burying a large number of earthen vessels and cups along with the dead body. 

Signs of cremation were also unearthed along the lower stratum reaching down to four or five feet below the surface of the mound. Thus the customs of cremation, post cremation partial burial, and simple and complete burial appear to have been in vogue almost simultaneously during the period to which this cemetery belongs. 

On account of the coins found—‘cast coins notably with the elephant or tree in railing on the obverse and the chaitya  or mountain with a crescent above on the reverse’— Garde dates this śmaśāna  to the 3rd or 2nd century BC \( ibid. 

p. 16\), but the actual time it may have been in use could be many centuries longer̥ In addition to the skeletons and earthenware, ornaments were found, such as earrings and beads, and one wonders which purpose the ‘pedestals’ may have served. However tentative Garde’s excavation may have been, there can be little doubt that the mound revealed a prominent śmaśāna  in the sense of

‘burial-cum-cremation ground’. We know of one prominent śmaśāna  at Ujjain

from the Sanskrit literature: it was allegedly the birthplace of the Pāśupata

82 Annual Administration Report of the Archæological Department Gwalior State \(AAR\) 1938–39 p. 16:

The faces of many were turned to the West, of some to the East, and of others upwards to the sky. The poses of a few were quite unusual for ordinary burial. Thus two skeletons had the knees bent and raised up. One of them was in a seated posture with the trunk folded and the head bent forward. 

Another again had the trunk

twisted to right, the knees bent, and legs folded to the lefṭ Still another was seated in a meditating attitude almost like a Buddhist monk or a jain Sadhu. 

A few of

the skeletons, judging from their short stature and the development of pelvic cavity appeared to be females, while a few others distinctly represented youngsterṣ\[. . . \]

movement, the site where Kuśika/Kauśika was believed to have been initiated by the Lord \( bhagavat\) Himself. 83

Although this accumulation of evidence may seem substantial, if we take stock of the extent of the Subcontinent and the many centuries involved, it indicates that burial, of the complete body or partial after cremation, was a marginal rather than a central phenomenon in classical India. And, unfortunately, it does not furnish us with factual information on the monuments to the dead outside the Buddhist sphere. 84 We don’t know how the Ujjain śmaśāna

looked aboveground when it was still in use. The following find in Mansar may not solve this question definitively, but it has enough fascinating characteristics to warrant a separate treatment, which, in combination with the material collected by de Marco, may give us some idea as to what a funerary monument of a person of consequence may have beeṇ

Sanchi, which, according to de Marco \(1987, 226, Fig. 22\), ‘is certainly  the tomb of a yogin  belonging to the same community represented in the relief’. How to explain that we have no archaeological evidence of this sort of ancient monuments of yogins, whereas we have innumerable ones of Buddhist saints? And even if it were a tomb of a yogin, I find it hazardous to conclude from this piece of ‘evidence’ \(and this tentative piece alone\), that the samādhis  of yogins found in South Asia to date existed all throughout Indian history \(de Marco 1987, 228 ṇ 76\). 

The situation appears significantly altered in the later \(post ad 1200\) period, in which we find samādhis, chiefly of yogins and saints—e.g. the ‘ śmaśāna  of Pāśupatanāth’ il-

lustrated in de Marco 1987, Figs. 18 f., or the samādhis  of Gorakhnāth yogis, ibid.  Figs.

This change may be partly due to Islamic influence; it falls outside the scope of the present investigatioṇ For the burial practice of the Gorakhnāth yogis see Briggs 1938, 39–43.

The eḍūka at Mansar

I have dealt with the Vākāṭaka site of Mansar in several earlier publications. 

In Bakker 2004a I have drawn attention to the important publication of ṭA. 

Wellsted in the jasb xxix, in which he reports that, 

In 1928 a certain amount of interesting material came to light and led to the examination of the whole area surrounding Mansar tank, with the result that the traces of an extensive townsite were discovered. 85

Wellsted carried out a careful archaeological survey and some of the finds described in his report were donated to the British Museum. In the present context Wellsted’s site ‘T’ \(Figure 11\) deserves special attentioṇ 

Figure 11

Wellsted’s survey map of Mansar

This site \(encircled on the map\) is situated on a direct line between the Pravareśvara Temple on the Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī \(MNS 3\), about 2 km to the west, and the Vaiṣṇava monuments of the Rāmagiri, 3.5 km to the east, that is to say, virtually in the middle of these two great Vākāṭaka state sanctuaries, the for-

mer built by King Pravarasena II, the latter by his mother, Prabhāvatī Guptā, 

both in the first half of the fifth century ad. The site as described by Wellsted concerns a brick shaft, uncovered and destroyed during mining work.

This shaft reached to within 2 feet \[60 cm\] of the surface and extended downwards to the junction of the surface soil with bedrock 14 feet \[4.2 m\] from the surface, its total height therefore was 12 feet \[3.6 m\]. Of square plan, with walls of single brick construction, the space enclosed was about 4.5 sq ft \[≈ 65 × 65 cm\]. The bricks were of large size, 18” × 9 .  5” × 3 .  5” \[≈ 45 × 24 × 9 cm\]. Near the bottom, making a lower chamber 15” \[38 cm\] deep, was a false floor of brick. The bottom of the lower chamber was paved with brick and rested directly on bedrock. In the upper part of the shaft was filled earth from which was recovered a small snake image of greenish soapstone and some pottery. Beneath the false floor was a large spherical pot, 1 ft \[30 cm\] in diameter containing ashes; with it also were several small pots. 

\(Wellsted 1934, 164\)

On the face of it, the brick construction described resembles a mirror image of the Sui Vihar monument, but there are fundamental differences. 

There

is no subterranean tower- or dome-like construction, something hardly to be expected, whereas another, possibly more significant difference is, that the burial gifts that accompany the urn with ashes are not so much beads and ornaments as in Sui Vihar, but ritual implements such as vessels, pots, bowls \(Plate 92\), a lamp, two tubular, subconical pieces of red-polished ware, 86 and the Nāga image \(Plate 91\).

Plate 92

Pottery found at site T in Mansar

It is important to note that partly the same items have been found at the adjacent site of MNS 3, in the hypogeum which contains the so-called Man of Mansar, viz. two pots, an oillamp and an image of a snake \(Bakker 2004a, 81 f.; above, Plate 87\). And, finally, in contrast to Sui Vihar, no dedicatory inscription has been discovered in the burial chamber̥ There might have been nothing to dedicate. The shaft is likely to have ended in a monument above the ground, not an object of worship. 

The pottery and the Nāga image were stored in the British Museum in

1930, 87 but not the urn with ashes, which has disappeared. The coarse red ware, the size of the bricks and the smooth, perfectly sculptured soapstone image of a rising cobra \(Nāga\), its central hood crowned by the typical Vākāṭaka

flower cap, leave little doubt that the finds are Vākāṭaka.88

As to the form of the Nāga sculpture, this differs completely from the iron

snake found near the Man of Mansar \(Plate 104\), but it conforms to an image found in front of the entrance of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple on the

Rāmagiri. 89 The size of the two Nāga images is different, but the similarity of

concept is rather striking \(Plate 93\). 

The function of the Nāga may have been a protective and supportive

one, representing the Vāstunāga, a concept somewhat parallel to that of

87 The pottery: BM 1930,10.7.2–25; the Nāga image: BM 1930,10.7.1. 

88 The height of this Nāga image including pedestal is 7.6” \(= 18 cm\). 

89 For the iron snake found in MNS 3 see Bakker 2004a, Plate 6.24 = below, Plate 104: it is a crawling snake. The Nāgas found in front of the Kevala–Narasiṁha Temple and at site

T, on the other hand, are frozen in a position in which the hood is raised and expanded to ward off danger; the snake hood in this position may be imagined to support what is placed on top of it \( ādhāraśakti\).

the Vāstupuruṣa: a local snake-deity of the site, ritually converted to the guardian of the vāstu, homologized with the cosmic Ananta, who carries the building/earth on his hoods. The major difference between both images is the number of the hoods \(heads\)—three in the case of the burial shaft Nāga, five

in the case of the temple one—which may be explained by the difference in status of the two: one protecting a funerary monument, the other the house of a god, i.e. temple. 

Plate 93

Nāga Rāmagiri \(left\), Nāga Mansar \(right\)

The idea that a site belongs to and is protected by a Nāga, who underlies it, is

common to the Hindu as well as the Buddhist traditions. 90 However, I conjecture that at site T we are not concerned with a Buddhist or Jain monument, but with a funerary monument belonging to the mainstream tradition, to which the Vākāṭaka royal family belonged, and this on the following grounds: 1\) the significant differences with the Sui Vihar monument; 2\) the burial gifts, which at site T show correspondences with those found next to the Man of Mansar in MNS 3—viz. the pottery and the serpent—and the finds at the śmaśāna  in

Ujjain—the urn with ashes and the pottery; 3\) the striking similarity of the Nāga of the burial shaft and the one found at the entrance of the Kevala–

Narasiṁha Temple; 4\) the situation of the site in between two Hindu state sanctuaries \( devakulasthāna\). 

90 E.g. Bose 1932, 29: ‘According to the Śilpaśāstras, it is imagined that a great serpent

\(Nāga\) lies encircling every building-site.’ Rāmacandra Kaulācāra’s Śilpaprakāśa 1.55–

60 \(Boner & Śarmā 1966, 4 f. \(14 f.\). Cf. the Buddhist Kriyāsaṁgrahapañjikā, discussed

in Tanemura 2004, 24 ff.; Cohen 1998.

The aboveground monumental part of this grave is irretrievably lost and thoughts as to what it may have looked like are necessarily of a speculative nature. The plausibility of such speculation would be increased, though, if we could connect what still remains with other instances of funerary monuments. 

As such I would like to adduce the two Gandhāra reliefs left out of account

so far, in particular the monument shown in de Marco’s relief B-10, a specimen that by itself makes up this author’s type 4 \(Plate 94\). 91 This is the only specimen that shows a subterranean and an aboveground part, and the subterranean part consists of a brick shafṭ 

Plate 94

Tomb of the mother of Sudāya and the latter’s meeting with the Buddha

At the lower end of this shaft is an arched opening out of which sticks the body of Sudāya’s mother, but, as de Marco justly remarks, as in the case of the tumuli \(type 1\), this ‘is clearly a representational device’ \(de Marco 1987, 234\). The brick shaft seems badly fitted to contain a body anyway, and the thought thrusts itself upon us that we are here concerned with what is actually a burial shaft meant to contain an urn with ashes and/or bones appropriated by the artist to illustrate the legend of Sudāya. The aboveground structure is

described by de Marco as follows:

A high podium \( adhovedikā\) quadrangular in form \( cāturāṣra  sic\), framed at the

extremities by a moulded plinth and cyma, a basement with two tambours moulded 91 This relief had been photographed when it was in the Karachi antique market; its present location is unknown \(de Marco 1987, 210\). 



21 / Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India 437

at the summit, and a cupola \( aṇḍa  or kumbha\) from the centre of which rises a short pole \( yaṣṭi\) supporting a single umbrella ‘disc’ in the form of a spheroidal vault, similar to the topmost element \( uṣṇīṣa\) of the stūpa  itself. 92

De Marco argues laboriously that we are here concerned with a sort of Buddhist memorial, but his argument is not entirely convincing. It seems to me that the structure as such is non-denominational. Aside from a general resemblance with a stūpa, there are conspicuous resemblances with the aiḍūka  structure

of the VDhP: three receding platforms \( bhadrapīṭhas\), admittedly the upper two circular \(the ‘tambours’\) and not square, on which stands an aṇḍa \(the

‘cupola’\), which, in another context, could also be interpreted as a liṅga-like \( liṅgarūpa\) column; from this rises again a column or yaṣṭi  that is crowned by a spherical element, interpreted by de Marco as a \(single\) ‘umbrella’ \( chattri \). 

Note, not the triple umbrella usual for a Buddhist stūpa. 93

Since Gustav Roth’s Symbolism of the Stūpa \(Roth 1980\), we may take it for

certain that the author of the VDhP calqued his Hindu aiḍūka  on a Buddhist

example, but by doing this he elaborated on what must have been a monumental tradition that was common to all Indian religions, most pronounced within Buddhism, less in Jainism, and inconspicuous in the Hindu mainstream. 

It might be useful to draw a comparison here with the monument depicted in de Marco’s relief A-1, classified by him again as a type by itself \(type 2:

‘square plan monuments’\), which lacks the subterranean part of B-10, since the myth represented did not require its depiction \(Plate 95\). The śmaśāna

scene of this relief makes it clear that it represents a funerary monumenṭ 94 It consists of, 

A high quadrangular stone podium, decorated, on the visible side, with a sort of disc or circular emblem. From the platform rises a cylindrical structure terminating in a cupola, slightly compressed at the sides and flattened at the top, with a similar element of smaller dimensions rising from the summiṭ 95

92 De Marco 1987, 212. 

93 Similar structures are depicted in the petroglyphs found in Oshibat on the upper Indus River in northern Pakistaṇ Bemmann & König \(1994\) classify these pictures, given in Tafel 24–27, as ‘ stūpas’, but they may rather be funerary monuments of a more general nature, as the crowning with a trident \(18:227\), the crescent and sun \(18:127, 18:199, 18:156\), or a pennant \(18:269, 20:2\) seems to indicate. Also the pictures in Tafel 32, classified as ‘Scene’, are monuments rather than Buddhist stūpas. 

94 This regards a relief that is kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum \(Iṣ1-1945\) and has been described by Ackermann 1975, 107–109. The scene is found in the lowest of three registers that make up this relief; it depicts the episode of a boy bound in the cemetery \(i.e., śmaśāna\) who takes refuge with the Buddha. For the identification of this scene see Santoro 1980, 106 f., who bases herself on the Chinese Tripiṭaka \(Tsa p’i-yü ching II, 20 = Taish¯

o Issaiky¯

o IV, nr̥ 205, pp. 507, c, 7-508, a, 1\), translated by P. Daffinà. 

Ackermann 1975, 107 had described this funerary monument as a ‘miniature vihāra’. 

95 De Marco 1987, 196. Cf. the description given by Ackermann 1975, 107 f.: The vihāra  between the Buddha and the boy stands on a cubic block of stone, its visible side is decorated by a round, shield-like protuberance. The vihāra  itself consists of

a cylindrical body and the double, vaulted roof, decorated with a rhomboid patterṇ 

The opening of the vihāra  is assumed to be on the side turned towards the child.

This structure too, with its alternation

of square and round vertical elements—

there seems to be one more quadrangu-

lar podium below the one that is deco-

rated by the ‘protuberance’—echoes the

VDhP description, or rather the other

way round. 

Although certainly differ-

ent in many details, I think that the

structures of A-1 and B-10 are basically

the same, and that they are variants of

the modest beginning that in the Viṣṇu-

dharmottarapurāṇa, under Buddhist in-

fluence, has evolved into the phantas-

tic aiḍūka. 

Another variant of such a

structure, a true eḍūka, might have once

Plate 95

crowned the burial shaft in Mansar, as it

Funerary monument

might have done the śmaśāna  at Ujjaiṇ 

in śmaśāna

A funerary monument to Prabhāvatī Guptā? 

The prominent situation of the findspot of the burial shaft, site T in Mansar, in between the two Vākāṭaka \(Hindu\) state sanctuaries, suggests the pres-

tigious character that the funerary monument must have had in the eyes of contemporaries; it may have called to mind an important public figure. In an earlier publication I have conjectured, on account of the Nāga guarding the

burial chamber, that this public figure may have been Prabhāvatī Guptā her-

self, ‘Pravarasena’s remarkable Bhāgavata mother, the queen who styled herself

as belonging to the Dhāraṇa gotra, a princess who was, on her own account, an ornament of both dynasties, the Gupta and the Nāga’. 96

I would like to be more cautious here. If the ashes were those of Prabhāvatī

she would have had two monuments, a memorial temple on the Rāmagiri and

the eḍūka  at issue. The latter may have marked the spot where she was cremated, the former was the place where merit was transferred to her in the next world. The two similar Nāgas found at both sites seem to underpin this

hypothesis. However, a serpent underneath a structure is a common rather than a specific feature, and, apart from that, there is little that points to any person in particular̥ It is therefore possible altogether that the burial shaft belonged to someone else, another king, another important person of the fifth century. The anonymity of this grave illustrates again what Malamoud sees 96 Bakker 2004a, 84. Poona Plates of Prabhāvatīguptā \(CII V, 7 ll. 7–8, 36 ll. 8–9\):

as the ‘l’idéologie funéraire dans le brâhmanisme’: ‘La durée de vie des mânes est brève. Le culte qui leur est rendu n’est pas fait pour leur donner ou leur permettre de garder un visage’ \(Malamoud 1982, 449\). 

Conclusion

The natural human inclination to erect monuments to the dead has been recognized within the Brahmanical tradition since Vedic times. However, it did not really take root within Hinduism. Abhorrence of everything connected with death owing to its pollutive potential may be one of the explanatory factors. 97

Worship was reserved for those powers which could enhance the human condition and mortuary remains were not counted among them. In this respect the Buddhist tradition with its human founder distinguished itself fundamentally from the Hindu mainstream. The funerary structures pertaining to the Brahmanical sphere that we have surveyed were all, with the exception of the last one at site T in Mansar, ‘cenotaphs’ in essence. In order to reconcile the inclination to commemorate the dead with the religious propensity to increase merit through worship, the memorial temple, our category one, came into being. This became a resounding success. Literary and archaeological evidence for the other four categories, however, remains meagre within the period under review, the ancient and classical age. 

To erect stone steles \( yaṣṭis\) in memory of a dear one who had passed away may have been a wide-spread custom in South Asia from neolithic times or earlier̥ It was apparently unknown to Vedic religion, but was accommodated to Hindu and Buddhist practices; within both religions, however, it developed in quite divergent ways. The yaṣṭis  of Andhau and the one of Sui Vihar have in common that both commemorate the death of a venerated person; one of the Andhau steles was erected for a novice nun \( śrāmaṇerī\). A significant

difference, however, is that in Sui Vihar the deceased was an initiated Buddhist monk \( bhikṣu\), whose ashes were deposited on top of the yaṣṭi, thus turning the monument into an object of \(relic\) worship, comparable to the cult of saints in Christianity; accordingly the monument was expanded into a stūpa. 98 The

yaṣṭi, combined with bones or ashes and appropriating, as it would seem, the Vedic idea of the burial mound \( citi\), thus became the stūpa  of the heterodox

traditions; without mortuary deposits it evolved into the memorial stones of 97 Malamoud 1982, 451 ṇ 3:

Le cadavre est une source majeure d’impureté, pour les objets et les lieux, mais aussi pour les hommes. Les survivants sont atteints d’une souillure d’autant plus grave et durable qu’ils sont plus étroitement apparentés au morṭ 

98 The difference between monks and laymen should not be taken to be absolute. ‘Burial ad sanctos’ was, as Schopen 1997, 114–147, has shown, a common phenomenon in Indian Buddhism.

Hans Bakker

Indian folk religioṇ 99 The former development is earlier than the latter̥ The Śaka tribes, who came from a background with a rich funerary tradition, may have acted as a catalyst of the second development, which did not meet with great acclaim from the side of the orthodox. 

Foreign influence may also account for another exceptional phenomenon in ancient and classical North India: the installation of human effigies within holy space, i.e. a temple. Although one indigenous example of a statue gallery has been found, this cave at Nāṇeghāṭ differs substantially, as we have argued, from what the Kuṣāṇa kings had made for themselves. The devakulas  at Māṭ and Surkh Kotal are sui generis. 

Finally the aiḍūka  and eḍūka. The latter, if not a pejorative for a Buddhist stūpa, is nearly as elusive as the former̥ In both cases we should think of vertical, elongated or needle-like constructions, mostly of brick \(in which one could see an echo of the Vedic citi\), combined with one or more yaṣṭis, round or square pillars or poles, raised by way of a commemorative columṇ The general Hindu reluctance to connect it with actual remains of the dead rendered it futile: being neither temple nor relic sanctuary there were not enough incentives to construct, worship and maintain it; the Hindu funerary monument or aiḍūka

never really came off the ground. The only specimen recognized as such by some scholars is the one preserved in Ahicchatra, where no mortuary deposits seem to have been found \(for this we reserve the word ‘ aiḍūka’\), but this identification

is spurious. The aiḍūka  of the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa is a hybrid product of śāstric imagination, calqued on a Buddhist example. 

The remains of an eḍūka  seem to have been preserved at site T in Mansar, where ashes have been found \(hence our reference to it as ‘ eḍūka’\) and a sub-

terranean brick shaft was excavated, but where there is no longer a column above the ground. With the help of some Gandhāra reliefs we have made an

attempt to visualize a structure that possibly once stood on top of the burial shaft and which to contemporaries may have been a ‘stab of pain’ \( śokaśalya\), 

reminding them of one of the great \(wo\)men of their age. 

99 Cf. Irwin 1980, 12:

In my first lecture—entitled The Stūpa and the Cosmic Axis: the archaeological

evidence \[not available to this author\]—it was shown that the primary component of the early stūpa  had been an axial pillar of wood. In the earliest stage, this pillar had not been erected simply to mark the centre of the mound: it had taken structural precedence over the raising of the mound itself, the latter serving as an envelope to enclose iṭ Later, when earthen stūpas  were superseded by more permanent structures in brick or stone, the axial function of the original type of monumental pillar was taken over by a comparitively slender pole or staff \( yaṣṭi\) bearing one or more umbrellas at its summiṭ
