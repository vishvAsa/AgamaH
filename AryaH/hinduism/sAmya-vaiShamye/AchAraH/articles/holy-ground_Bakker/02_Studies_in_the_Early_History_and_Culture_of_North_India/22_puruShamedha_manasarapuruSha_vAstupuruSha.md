The Image of Man in the Sacrificial Context

The image of man

To the Greek philosopher Xenophanes \(6th century bc\) the following insight is ascribed:

But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves. 1

One of the fascinating aspects of early Indian thought as come down to us in the tenth book of the r̥ gveda is that such naive representation of the divine or of the anthropomorphic nature of the gods of the conventional religion had been transcended centuries before Xenophanes, in the masterly, mystical vision of the poet of the Hymn of Creation who observed:

Non-existent there was not, existent there was not theṇ There was not the atmospheric space, nor the vault beyond. What stirred, where, and in whose control? Was there water, a deep abyss? 

Nor death nor immortality \(mortals nor immortals\) was there then; there was no distinction of night or day. That One \( tad ekam\) breathed without breath by inner power; than it verily there was nothing else further̥ 

\[. . . \]

Who truly knows? Who shall here proclaim it—whence they were produced, whence this creation? The gods \(arose\) on this side \(later\), by the creation of this \(empiric world, to which the gods belong\); then who knows whence it came into being? \[. . . \] 2

Yet, in the same book we encounter another cosmogonic idea which makes it clear that transcendental thought and human imagery could exist side by side; to which of these two visions preference was given depended evidently on the

sphere of life to which they were applied, the philosophical or the sacrificial one, both supposed to be equally valid in their own righṭ 

The Puruṣa has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feeṭ He, encompassing the world on all sides, stood out ten fingers’

lengths beyond. 

The Puruṣa alone is all this universe, what has been, and what is to be. He rules likewise over \(the world of\) immortality \(viz. the gods\), which he grows beyond, by \(sacrificial?\) food. 

\[. . . \]

When the gods, with the Puruṣa as oblation, extended \(performed\) the \(cosmic\) sacrifice, Spring became the butter for it, Summer the firewood, Autumn the oblatioṇ 

They consecrated on the sacred grass this sacrifice, \(namely\) the Puruṣa, born in the beginning. 

With him the gods sacrificed, the

Sādhyas, and the Seers. \[. . . \] 3

It is to this sphere of sacrifice that we shall confine ourselves in the following essay. And, as may be derived from the Hymn of Cosmic Man, sacrifice of Man or human sacrifice, real or symbolic, is an integral part of the Indian ritualistic world. Philosophers may draw the forms of the world like abstract principles, ritualists prefer to draw them like tangible substances of flesh and blood or their homologous substitutes. But as we will see, the Indian genius of speculation and abstraction operated not only in the philosophical sphere. 

It may also take credit for the transformation of the cruelest of all sacrifices into a vision that synthesizes the realms of god and maṇ What evidence, the sceptic may ask, do we have for human sacrifice in India? 

Human sacrifice in India

William Crooke, one of the great connoisseurs of the living traditions of India of his time and reporter of many a crooked thing, notes in his delightful book Things Indian under the heading ‘House’:

Very similar to these \[scil. houses\] was the earliest Indo-Aryan house, the form of which has been handed down in the marriage shed of our days. The materials were wood, basket-work, and clay. The main feature was the corner-posts, which were fixed in the ground with rites, sometimes including human sacrifice, intended to conciliate the earth-spirits, and were always regarded as, in some sense, sacrosancṭ 4

22 / Puruṣamedha, Manasarapuruṣa, Vāstupuruṣa 445

All through the later course of history we meet occasional instances of the custom

\[i.e. of human sacrifice\]. First we find the foundation sacrifice, either, as some believe, intended to appease the earth-deities of the place, or as a deliberate piece of god-making, to create a divine protector of the building. Many a fort and tank, as legend tells us, were guarded in this way. \[. . . \] Whenever we \[i.e. the British\]

build a great bridge or harbour mole, our engineers are suspected of being on the look-out for victims, and people are careful not to wander abroad at night during the time the foundation is being laid. 5

It is evident that all this ‘information’ is merely based on hear-say, but the fact that it was said and heard may be an indication that at least the notion of killing a human victim in the context of a construction sacrifice or Bauopfer  was well-knowṇ That the practice was actually wide-spread in the rest of Asia, SE

and E Asia including Japan, is well attested in the scholarly literature regarding the subjecṭ 6

With regard to South Asia, however, the evidence is apparently more problematic, as already indicated by the title of a recent article by two Dutch anthropologists, Jordaan and Wessing—calqued on the title of an article by the French scholar Paul Mus 7—Construction Sacrifice in India ‘seen from the East’. 8 The reason why it is ‘seen from the East’ is that, on the one hand, the two anthropologists find abundant \(archaeological\) evidence for the practice in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia; this leads them to infer \( op. ciṭ  229\) that this violent custom may actually have received impulses from South Asia, the cradle of the Indianized cultures and religions of Southeast Asia. In South Asia itself, on the other hand, the two anthropologists have ‘seen’ comparatively little hard evidence that could support their inference. They suspect, however, that this is not so much due to the absence of the practice itself, than to prejudice on the part of indologists—after all South and Southeast Asia share, according to them, ‘common prehistoric origins in Mus’ monsoon Asia’

\( op. ciṭ  229\), a dubious argument on which the two anthropologists set great store. Hence their exhortation: ‘Further archaeological research is obviously needed into various aspects of \(human\) sacrifice, without dismissing possible indicators out of hand as has been done in the past’ \( op. ciṭ  228 f.\). 

Jordaan and Wessing make a distinction into two types, which partly overlap, 

Namely appeasement sacrifice, aimed at gaining title to the land to be used from the spirits that are believed to own it, and animation sacrifice used to give the structure strength and protection by animating it with the spirit of the sacrificial victim. 9

In the Indian context the former type of rites could be subsumed under the category of Vāstuśānti  or Vāstuśamana \(‘Appeasement of the House’\) ritu-

als. These rituals, to be performed whenever one begins the construction of and/or enters a newly built house are summarized by Kane in his History of Dharmaśāstra, Volume V, 790 f. 

They derive from prescripts in various

texts pertaining to the Vedic tradition dealing with domestic sacrifices—the Gr̥hyasūtras—and develop in later digests to ‘a very elaborate affair’, which we, like Kane, pass over here, not ‘for reasons of space’ though, but because human sacrifice is not touched upon in this contexṭ 

Installation of the house or Vāstupratiṣṭha

The second type of sacrifice may be subsumed under the category of Vāstupratiṣṭhā \(‘Installation of the House’\), which is described by Kane \( op. ciṭ \) in Volume II, 833–36 \(conflated with Vāstuśānti  rites\). This type

of ritual also reaches back to Vedic times and is canonized in the same Gr̥hyasūtra literature. 

A central role in these rituals is reserved for the ‘Lord of the Homestead’, Vāstoṣpati, already hymned in r̥gveda 7.54.1-3, a power who is represented by a firm posṭ Kane gives the following description of this House Sacrifice \(Vāstuyajña\). 

On an auspicious day and moment, the stone should be laid over jewels and all seeds; similarly the post is to be worshipped at the hands of four brāhmaṇas; the

priest who should wear white garments, should be master of the Veda and should be accompanied by the artizans, should fix the post that is washed with water mixed with all herbs and covered with many whole rice and decked with clothes and ornaments to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras and the tunes of auspicious music; he should perform a homa  with honey and clarified butter and should repeat the mantra ‘ vāstoṣpate prati’ \(r̥V 7.54.1\); then the owner should feed brāhmaṇas with a dish of rice-milk. 10

All this appears to give us little more than the usual harmless Brahminical ritualism, and seems remote from the gruesome practices in which animals or humans are slaughtered in order to lend their strength to the construction, as reported by Crooke and surmised by Jordaan and Wessing. Yet, appearances may be deceptive, especially in India. 

The two anthropologists have recourse to an authority, Stella Kramrisch, who refers to Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 1.2.3.6–7, in order to underpin the homol-

ogy of, on the one hand, the seeds placed underneath the foundation-stone and the rice offered to the Vāstoṣpati, and, on the other, the sacrificial animal

\( paśu\). This homology is believed to exist, because the grain ‘has the nature of the sacrificial victim; this essence passed to sacrificial animals, it entered into 10 Kane II, 834 f. Gonda 1980, 154: ‘An offering \( sthālīpāka  cooked in milk\) is made to

Vāstoṣpati with the formula “drive away evil; make our wealth increase; protect us always etc”.’ Cf. Bodewitz 1977–78, 59–68; Ray 1960, 311.

the horse, ox, sheep and goat, and lastly into the earth with its rice and bar-ley, etc’. 11 This at first sight curious doctrine goes back to early brahmanical speculation regarding the life-sustaining substance \( medha\) embodied in the sacrificial victim and transmitted in the sacrificial acṭ The primordial cosmic Puruṣa \(r̥V X.90, see above\) is the fountain-head of the medha. By his being sacrificed in the cosmic Puruṣamedha the medha  of the Puruṣa passed on to the horse, empowering the horse-sacrifice \(Aśvamedha\) etc., a lineage that finally makes the seeds of the earth fit for sacrifice \( medhya\). 12 Speaking of this conception, the French scholar Charles Malamoud warns against misinterpre-tation, observing that, rather than with a historical development, we are here concerned with a peculiarity of brahmanical thought, in which each part of a structure is at the same time equivalent of and comprising the whole. 13

All the same, it seems possible, if we take an orthodox brahmanical view, to see in the innocent vāstuyajña, House Sacrifice, its link with a less gentle, more bloody prototype, which, however, as far as house and temple building is concerned, is not attested in the texts, unless perhaps wrapped up in highly symbolic language that can be decoded only by learned brahmins and well-trained indologists. Yet, to infer from this the unhistoric nature of such a bloody prototype may be a fallacy. 

The Vedic text corpus knows of an ‘animation sacrifice’, to use Jordaan and Wessing’s terminology, not to install a house or other permanent building, but to build a make-shift sacrificial fire-altar in the Agnicayana ceremony. Archaeological evidence confirms the historic reality of this type of altars in ancient India. I refer to the three Agnicayana altars found in Jagatgram \(Dehra Dun District, UP\). 14

The building of the fire \( agnicayana\) and its altar is an elaborate and complicated affair, which is comparatively well researched. The following summary therefore does not pretend to add anything new, but rather serves as an aide-de-mémoire.

Excursus upon the construction of the

Agnicayana altar

The ritual of placing a golden \(i.e. immortal\) man at the base of the fire-altar is i.a. described in āpastamba Śrautasūtra 16.22.3-4. Taken by and large, the

procedure is as follows \(leaving out the mantras to be recited with every act\). 

After preparing the ground of the fire-altar, a knobbed, gold disk or plate is laid on a lotus-leaf; on this \(plate\) a man of gold is laid, directed towards the east, stretched out on his back, to the right of the hole \(in the plate\). Then the Puruṣasāman should be sung.15 According to the Taittirīya Saṁhitā:

He puts down a gold disk; gold is immortality; verily in immortality he piles the fire, for propagatioṇ He puts a golden man, to support the world of the sacrificer; if he were to put it over the perforation in the brick, he would obstruct the breath of cattle and of the sacrificer; he puts it down on the south side with head to the east: he supports the world of the sacrifice; he does not obstruct the breath of cattle and the sacrificer̥ 16

Next, after the golden man has been ‘touched’ by a verse—‘The drop hath fallen on the earth, the sky, on this seat, and on the one which was aforetime; the drop that wandereth over the third seat I offer in the seven Hotrās’ 17—the

serpents \( sarpa\) should be saluted with three verses. 

Homage to the serpents which are on the earth, the serpents in the atmosphere, in the sky, to those serpents homage etc. \[. . . \] 18

Ghee is sprinkled over the maṇ On either side of the man a sacrificial ladle is laid. 19 Hereafter the laying of the bricks is begun, the first one being the svayamātr̥ṇṇā \(‘the naturally pierced one’\) placed on the gold man to allow him to breathe. Within the altar also a living tortoise is builṭ 

Then, after a square mortar \( ulūkhalaka\) made of udumbara wood is installed

at the ‘northern shoulder’ \( uttare ’ṁse\) \(of the fire-altar\) and the fire-pot \( ukhā\)

is placed in the middle \( madhye\), 20 the heads of the five sacrificial victims \( paśus\) are installed, the human head in the middle of the fire-pot, the head of a horse towards the west, of a bull towards the east, of a ram towards the south, and of a goat towards the north, while seven gold pieces are laid in the seven orifices of the human head. 

Hereafter āpastamba prescribes that a snake head \( sarpaśiras\) should be

put on the right shoulder \( dakṣiṇe ’ṁse, i.e. south side\) of the fire-altar \(with the same verse ‘Homage to the serpents’\), which is turned away from the other sacrificial heads lest, the Taittirīya Saṁhitā \(5.2.9.5\) remarks, it should bite

these domesticated animals instead of wild ones. 21 After the snake, āpastamba

\(AŚS 16.28.1–3\) enjoins that a human figure \( puruṣākr̥ti\) should be assembled \( cinoti\) by means of twelve ‘turns’ \( paryāya\) each spoken trice, a \(virtual?\)

body stretching from east to west, the head of which coincides with the head of the golden man \( puruṣaśiras\). The sacrificer gives praise to this construction \( upahitā\) by the Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa.22

Though they seem to differ with respect to where exactly the puruṣa  and the sarpaśiras  are to be constructed, 23 both Black Yajurveda branches \(the 19

āŚS 16.22.4:

drapsaś caskandeti puruṣam abhimr̥śya namo astu sarpebhya iti tisr̥bhir abhimantrya kr̥ ṇuṣva pāja iti pañcabhir uttaravedivat puruṣaṁvyāghārya srucāv upadadhātīty u-

. 

paśuśīrṣaih. . 

The verb upadhā  is used for piling bricks as well as for the installation/placing of other items. It is therefore not clear whether a representation in brick \( citi\) or a real snake head is intended here. Tsuji 1983, 156 takes Mānavaśrautasūtra

8.3 to mean ‘piling of a serpent head’. Baudhāyana speaks of a ‘real’ snake head \(BŚS

10.9, Agni II, 499\) that should be placed on the right \(southern\) part of the forehead. 

It may be directed towards the direction from which danger threatens the country \(BŚS

10.30; Agni II, 539\). 

22 The Puruṣa Hymn, Tai ār 3.12 \(= r̥ V X.90; above, p. 444\). As has been observed by Ca-

land, this element may have been derived from the tradition of the Maitrāyan

.īyas \(Mai-

trāyan

.ī Saṁhitā 3.5.1\), as it is not found in the Taittirīya Saṁhitā nor in Baudhāyana

Śrautasūtra. The Śrautasūtra of the Maitrāyan

.īyas, the Mānava Śrautasūtra, indeed

reads as follows \(6.1.8.1, 3\): ‘He should construct the ‘man-layer’ \( puruṣaciti\) on the northern shoulder \( uttarasminn aṁse\). \[the same formulas\] Aloof from the upper part of the body \( uttarārdhāt\) he should construct the head of the snake \( sarpaśiras\) turned

away \(from the body\) by means of the ‘Homage to the serpents’ verses \( sarpanāma\); or

he should assign it \(only\) and not \(actually\) construct iṭ’ \(The same alternative in āŚS

16.27.23\). 

23 The Hiraṇyakeśi Śrautasūtra places the serpent head on the left shoulder \(see Caland 

450

Hans Bakker

Maitrāyaṇīyas and Taittirīyas\) differ from the Vājasaneyins \(represented by the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa and Kātyāyana Śrautasūtra\) in that the Śrautasūtras of

both Black Yajurveda traditions prescribe this human figure and serpent head to be part of the first layer of the fire-altar̥ The uncertainty regarding the positioning, however, the alternative allowed by two Śrautasūtras \( āpastamba

and Mānava\) to construct the serpent head only virtually, by means of formulas, and the omission of the human figure in Baudhāyana bespeak the idiosyncrasy

of this part of the ritual. 24

It is clear that the central role of the human head \(and the four animal heads\) in the piling up of the fire-altar presuposes sacrificial slaughter of some sorṭ According to the Śrautasūtras of the Black Yajurveda, the human head

should be cut off of a kṣatriya  or vaiśya  killed by an arrow or the thunderbolt,25

after which it has to be covered with clay and set aside. 26 The tradition of the White Yajurveda is more explicit that this ritual requires a human sacrifice. The Śatapathabrāhmaṇa \(6.2.1.18\) unambiguously declares that ‘a man

\( puruṣa\) should be sacrificed first, for man is the first of the sacrificial animals \( paśu\)’. The Kātyāyana Śrautasūtra states that the victim, a vaiśya  or rājanya

\(16.1.17\), should be suffocated in a special secluded place, 27 after which his head is taken \(16.1.18\), though it allows the option that a head of gold or clay is used as a substitute. 28 This may have become common practice when animal ad āŚS 16.27.22\). As to the place of the human figure Caland \( ad loc. \) remarks: ‘Art und Weise ihrer Schichtung sind undeutlich.’

24 It is conceivable that the theologians of the White Yajurveda, the Vājasaneyins \(as

well as Baudhāyana\), in view of their identification of the altar with the Puruṣa \(ŚBr 6.1.1.3-7\), took the totality of the bricks of the first layer itself as a representation of the puruṣa, which would render another puruṣa figure, in addition of the man of gold and the altar itself, redundanṭ On the other hand, though, the omission of the serpent head remains intriguing. As we have seen, the serpents were earlier invoked, by the same verses but without the examplifying head, after the man of gold had been installed and the Puruṣasāman had been sung. 

25

āŚS 16.6.2-3; cf. VŚS 2.1.1.50 and MŚS 6.1.2.23 \( vaiśya  and rājanyabandhu\). According

to Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra 10.9 it should be the head of a vaiśya  killed in battle \(Agni

II, 499\). 

26 mr̥ dā pralipya nidadhāti, āŚS 16.6.7; cf. BŚS 10.10 \(Agni II, 501\). The ritual according to Caland’s translation of āpastamba \(AŚS 16.6.2–4\) is as follows:

Dann geht er mit sieben oder einundzwanzig Bohnen in der Hand, um einen Menschenkopf zu holen, der von einem Vaiśya oder Kṣatriya herrührt, welcher durch einen Pfeil \(im Kriege\) oder durch den Blitz getötet worden isṭ Nachdem er die Bohnen in der Nähe \(des Körpers\) hingeworfen hat, haut er den Menschenkopf ab mit der Formel: ,Der du hier bist, dem dir dieses Haupt angehört, durch dieses Haupt sollst du dort im Besitze eines Hauptes sein’ und legt dann an die Stelle des Kopfes einen siebenfach durchlöcherten Ameisenhaufen nieder̥ Er singt, während er rechts um das Haupt herumgeht, die drei an Yama gerichteten Verse. \[. . . \]

sacrifice, not to speak of human sacrifice, had become tabu. The bodies of the four animal victims are thrown into the water from where the clay is taken to make the bricks. 29 What is done with the decapitated human corpse remains unclear in the Śrautasūtras. The Śatapathabrāhmaṇa strongly suggests that

all trunks are thrown into the water: 30

As to these glories \( śriyaḥ \), \[identified with the elixir of life \( rasa\) in ŚBr 6.1.1.4.\], they are these very heads of the sacrificial victims and these trunks are the five \(altar\) layers \( citi\). Therefore, after having placed the heads of the sacrificial victims, one piles up the layers; then one unites these trunks with these same heads. 31

Although the obvious interpretation takes the layers as a substitute of the trunks, it cannot be excluded that, especially in the case of the human paśu, 

the body of the victim was, occasionally perhaps, interred into the altar, to the effect that the Puruṣa, i.e. 1\) the Demiurge Prajāpati, 2\) the sacrificial victim, and 3\) the sacrificer \( yajamāna\), became reintegrated in the sacrificial sphere, a reintegration that is the alpha and the omega of the Agnicayana, for instance reflected in the golden maṇ 

In total the altar consists of five layers of brick, which may have the shape of a bird, especially the śyena \(hawk\), which is the default, but optionally also that of a triangle, a chariot-wheel, a trough, a circle, or a burial mound \(i.e. square\). 32 When this brick altar has been completed the āhavanīya  fire is

The remains of the three Agnicayana altars, found in Jagatgram apparently do have the shape of a hawk, but whether they include human and animal bones remains as yet unknowṇ According to the two 3rd-century inscribed sacrificial bricks, which mention an otherwise unknown king Śīlavarman, lord of Yugaśaila, they were used for the performance of altogether four Aśvamedha sacrifices.

Preliminary conclusion

From their inception the Indian higher, i.e. literate, religions \(I am limiting myself here to Vedism and Hinduism\) know of and prescribe construction sacrifices, mostly of a highly symbolic nature. To judge by the texts, human sacrifice seems only to have played a role in the construction of a make-shift fire-altar, not in that of permanent constructions. 

Theoretically, it is quite possible to conceive of an Indian construction sacrifice, including human victims, that evolved from ideas and practices developed in the context of the building of the Agnicayana altar, but if such an evolution took place, it did not find expression in Sanskrit texts dating from before the sixth century ad. It is remarkable, for instance, that the classical Indian Book of the State, the Arthaśāstra, though elaborately describing the lay-out and

building of cities and fortifications \(2.3\), does not spend one word on construction sacrifices. It is of course perfectly conceivable that blood-sacrifices of this sort belonged to a realm less well represented by Brahmanical and Hindu scriptures, but if this were the case on the scale suggested by Jordaan and Wessing, this would have become obvious long time ago through archaeology. Of course, we subscribe to their exhortation to do more unbiased archaeological research, but much of this type of research has been done, and its outcome seems to be that human remains as part of the foundations of stone buildings in India occur only rarely. 34

Archaeological evidence for the

construction sacrifice

Yet, unnoticed instances do occur, and I wish to draw attention to two of them here. Both of them have so far not been seen as examples of construction sacrifices, but I would like to argue that their evidence is best explained by interpreting them as such. And both could be seen as ‘construction variants’ of the Agnicayana altar, the intellectual feasibility of which was postulated above.

uncovered the remains of a genuine Agnicayana altar, outside of the eastern gate, within an enclosure-wall, sandwiched between the ramparts and the moat of this ancient towṇ This structure is assigned to the 2nd century bc.

in the excavation of a mound known as Meḍh in the village of Gokul near Mahāsthān in

the District Bogra, West Bengal. In addition to this skeleton, a gold leaf with the figure of a bull has been found. The excavation is reported by ṇG. Majumdar in ASI Annual Report 1935–36, 67–69. 

This very interesting site requires another study, especially because there seem to be striking parallels with the Mansar excavations \(see below\). 

The second site is at Keesargutta, District Hydarabad of Andhra Pradesh, reported in IAR 1978–79, 63 f.: ‘The skeleton, the head facing down and hands joined together above the head, in anjali-mudra, probably represents narabali  performed before the construction of the shrine.’

Within the alleged five layers of the altar ‘a large number of human skulls and bones of animals of different species, meticulously arranged’ were found. 35

In layer one the excavators found, inter alia, a ‘human skull’, ‘the shell of a tortoise’ and ‘the iron model of a snake’. 36

Kauśāmbī excavation: Iron Snake

Layer three ‘yielded the largest number of bones with a preponderance of human bone’: ‘three complete human skulls, ten skull pieces and other skeletal material’. 37 Summarizing, Sharma states that, 

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that this fire-altar was piled up for the performance of the Puruṣamedha. \( op. ciṭ  126\) 35 G.r̥ Sharma 1960, 118.

Sharma’s conclusions have been challenged by Schlingloff, whose criticism is in particular directed against the alleged historicity of the human sacrifice \( puruṣamedha\).38 The criticism of Romila Thapar takes a different route. She not so much doubts the historicity of the puruṣamedha, but calls the ‘fire-altar’ itself into questioṇ 

The identification of the site as a fire-altar does raise some problems. The location of the altar so close to the ramparts of the city seems unusual. \[. . . \] The shape of the bird as presently reconstructed appears to be rather curvilinear, whereas the bricks used for the altar would indicate a more rectilinear form. The interpretation of the objects found is also not convincing. \[. . . \] The frequency of human skulls and bones would also seem to suggest a ritual different from that described in the texts and it certainly is in excess of what is required. \[. . . \] there can be little doubt that the structure did represent some kind of sacrificial or funerary site. 39

Comparison of the Kauśāmbī brick structure with the fire-altar remains in Jagatgram makes it clear at a single glance that the two are completely differenṭ 

Thapar is right when she notes that the location where this brick construction was found, at the foot of the ramparts, is unusual and I would like to go one step further, saying that this location virtually excludes the possibility that we are here concerned with an Agnicayana altar, which has to and can only be constructed in an open field. The great number of animal and human remains also seems incompatible with the Agnicayana ritual. Neither can I accept Schlingloff’s suggestion that we may here be concerned with a ritual ‘Grabstätte’ or cemetery just like thaṭ The location speaks against it and what to do with all the animal bones? The excavation is in need of a thorough reassessment, but my tentative suggestion would be that the uncovered brick structure represents the material remains of a construction sacrifice performed to ‘animate’, i.e. strengthen the defence constructions of the towṇ Taking its clue from the paradigmatic Agnicayana, this sacrifice entailed that animals and humans were slaughtered and bricked into an altar-like structure, yielding a ‘Grabstätte’ of a very peculiar kind. And what remains valid of Sharma’s conclusions, against Schlingloff, is that the site does indeed testify to the practice of a Puruṣamedha, human sacrifice. 

Mansar

My other example is taken from the excavations in Mansar, 5 km west of the Rāmagiri/Ramtek, Maharashtra. We shall focus here on the excavation of the site MNS 3, the so-called Hiḍimbā ṭekḍī, where a large and complicated temple complex has been unearthed. I have dealt with this excavation extensively at other occasions. 40

Here I shall concentrate on the alleged ‘two sacrificial altars, one in the shape of a śyena-citi \[hawk\] and the other a kūrma-citi \[turtle\], made of bricks’, 41

exposed by the excavators A.K. Sharma and J.P. Joshi in excavations carried out between 1998 and 2000. 42 These two putative ‘altars’ have been found half-way up a natural hill that is completely covered by brick constructions, the nature of which is controversial, but the most plausible interpretation of which takes them as the remains of a large Hindu temple complex \(above, p. 421, Plate 86\). The ‘altar’ layer is assigned to the 3rd century ad by the excavators, but, as we have argued, may be one or two centuries later̥

MNS 3 \(Hiḍimbā T

.ī\): Altar Site

As in the case of Kauśāmbī, the location—on a hillock, at the foot of, or

underneath a Hindu temple—makes it very unlikely a priori  that we have to do with a Vedic Agnicayana altar, as suggested by the excavators. No animal or human bones have been found in connection with these ‘altars’, but the area has yielded a most extraordinary and unique find \(see above, p. 422, Plate 87\).

In the śyenaciti, \[a more than life-size\] figure of a Puruṣa made of lime has been found sacrificed with his head smashed. The head of the figure is oriented towards west, whereas the legs are put towards easṭ A vedi  in the chest portion with a hole for fixing a yaṣṭi  over it was made and an earthen lamp was found kept nearby. 

Two pots have also been kept near the knee region of the figure which lies on his right side with an iron snake kept near his left toe, looking towards the human figure. 43

How rapidly the decline of this unique find has set in may become apparent from photos taken three months after the discovery in 1999 \(Plate 103, cf. Plate 87\). 

Plate 103

MNS 3: Man of Mansar \(Manasarapuruṣa\)

When we collect all the unearthed evidence carefully and compare this with the ritual of building an Agnicayana altar as described in the literature, only one conclusion is possible: the Mansar site is not an Agnicayana locatioṇ The most serious objection against such an identification is perhaps that the ‘altars’, though fantastic constructions, do not consist of five layers of bricks. All the same, like in Kauśāmbī, much of the evidence seems to reflect an Agnicayana paradigm. One of the conspicuous points in common with Kauśāmbī \(Plate

101\) is the discovery of a little iron snake \(Plate 104, cf. Plate 101\).

MNS 3: snake at the left foot of the Manasarapuruṣa Whereas in Kauśāmbī in the 2nd century bc the foundation structures may still have been reinforced by real animal and human victims, 600 years later, in the heyday of India’s classical culture, when the doctrine of no-injury, ahiṁsā, 

was fully developed, the same effect may have been thought obtainable by an effigy, the Man of Mansar, or Manasarapuruṣa. To cut a long story short, I believe that the excavators of Mansar hit upon the remains of a construction sacrifice. 

The meaning and function of the Man of Mansar, the ceremony with which he was installed, and the purport of his makers may have comprised elements from the interpretation schemes that we have discussed: 1 The idea of reintegration of man and God through the sacrificial insertion of a \(substitute\) human figure into the brick fundament of an altar or sacred building, as the case may be. 

2 The idea of a \(human\) sacrifice to safeguard the building, by warding off genii loci, on the one hand, and by embedding it in a recreated micro-macrocosmic unity, on the other̥ 

The Lord of the Homestead, Vāstoṣpati, who was subsequently installed and

worshipped, may have been represented by a firm wooden post that was placed in the hole in the breast of the clay figure \(Plate 105\). 

Earlier we envisaged the theoretical possibility that a new concept of a construction sacrifice could have evolved from ideas and practices developed in the context of the Agnicayana altar, but added that, if such an evolution took place, it did not find expression in Sanskrit texts that date from before the

sixth century ad. We have seen next that the evidence of at least two archaeological sites is indicative of such an evolution: Kauśāmbī and Mansar, to which, 

maybe, Gokul \(above, ṇ 34 on p. 452\) is to be added. 

Plate 105

Breast of the Manasarapuruṣa with hole to fix the Vāstoṣpati Discussing this material with my friend Phyllis Granoff, she made a significant observation which I would like to quote. She refers to Jain stories, In which people have to undergo tremendous troubles in order to build a temple. 

In fact, they often have to die. I think this may also be a reworking or memory trace of a construction sacrifice. Sometimes the donor or yajamāna has to die; in a

few cases he has to give up the possibility of having children, which is also a kind of death. 44

On the other hand, Granoff \( op. ciṭ  316\) refers to the ‘common belief that a temple built over bones of a dead person was doomed to collapse’. This belief may reflect the historical process, in which blood sacrifice gradually became tabu and was replaced by symbolic representations as described here. 

The Vāstupuruṣa

The restrictive clause limiting our search to texts from before the sixth century ad is deliberate. This is because I am of the opinion that from that century onwards we see a new concept gradually taking shape in the religious literature, an idea which raises the Kauśāmbī–Mansar progression that we ten-

tatively elaborated to a higher level of doctrinal abstraction, so characteristic 44 See Granoff 1992a, 315.

of medieval Hinduism. I mean the idea of the Vāstupuruṣa, the ‘Man of the

Homestead’, first encountered in the Br̥hatsaṁhitā. 45

The author Varāhamihira \(mid 6th century\) begins his chapter on ‘Architecture’ with the following two verses, after having said that the science of house-building \( vāstujñāna\) came down from Brahmā. 

To be more precise, there was a being that by his body obstructed the earth and the sky; that being was forcibly seized by the immortals, who felled him, head-dowṇ And wherever a god held it, there that god became established; the Creator ordained that the House Man \( vāstunara\) was to consist of those immortals. 46

This myth, which still strongly shows the mark of the Vedic concept of the Cosmic Man \(Puruṣa\), became the basis of an ideology that we find in nearly all Sanskrit texts dealing with the Hindu temple, be they sectarian religious scriptures \( āgamas\), or technical treatises concerned with architecture and the like, Śilpaśāstra. The central idea is that underneath the Hindu temple lies a diagram, a maṇḍala, that embodies the cosmic Puruṣa and houses all divinities. 

The temple, thus founded on a macrocosmic grid, is a junction of this world and the other, a fusion of micro- and macrocosm. Seen in this way the ideology of the temple continues that of the Agnicayana altar̥ 47

The ritual application of the theoretical concept of the Vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala

is described by ṇr̥ Bhatt as follows. 

The performer of the installation ceremony then draws a diagram called Vāstu-

maṇḍala on the site made even and clean and performs a fire ritual to please the deities of the lords of this maṇḍala. Vāstu means a site for dwelling. Vāstupuruṣa is a deity who governs the site and is lying on the site, and his limbs are occupied by different deities. Before construction, these deities are to be pleased and permission to use the site is to be obtained. This ritual is named vāstupūjā. 48

Kandhar

Occasionally a human-shaped figure in lieu of a maṇḍala  may be found. Such

a stone structure has been discovered, for instance, at Kandhar \(Disṭ Nanded, Maharashtra\) in excavations conducted by M.K. Dhavalikar and A.P. Jamkhedkar̥ 49

Excavation revealed the remains of a unique stone structure which is human shaped \(22 m long and 7 m wide\) and is enclosed by a double stone wall \(37 m × 33 m\). It is provided with an entrance on the easṭ \[. . . \] The structure is built of dressed 45 Shastri, 1991, 143–157.

stones in mud masonry, the intervening space being filled in with pebbles. The maximum length from head to toe is 23.05 m and the head portion, which is in the northwest, is 6.35 m long and 4.85 m wide. The legs, which are in the southeast direction, are 10.88 m long and their maximum width at the thigh is 2.20 m. \[. . . \]

The left-half of the head is destroyed. Around the head was a pavement of stone rubble in mud masonry which is 0.88 m wide. Near the legs was noticed a circular pit, which is now full of fallen stones. \(IAR 1983–84, 58 f.\) Plate 106

Human figure underneath temple in Kandhar

This remarkable structure may be half a millennium later than the Manasarapuruṣa—dating from the Rāṣṭrakūṭa period—and lacks the latter’s sophistication, but it more clearly reflects the literary idea of the Vāstupuruṣa. A conspicous agreement between both figures is the direction of head and legs: northwest/southeasṭ 

Curdi

Finally I would like to discuss briefly a figure found in Curdi \(Goa\). I am obliged to my friend Frans Janssen for sharing this information with me. The more than life-size image is made of laterite stone and is situated between a temple and a tank. In between the left arm and the trunk is the effaced image of a child still visible. 

The featuring of the child proves that we are here concerned with another type of image that may rather be classified as a fertility icoṇ In that respect

the brief description of Dr Shirodkar in the Purabhilekh-Puratatva 50 may be correct, when he calls the image a Lajjā Gaurī, although we usually understand

a completely different type of icon by that term.

Final remark

Apart from a few rare exceptions, the idea of the Vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala is first

and foremost a mythological and theoretical, ritualistic concept, which has hardly, if at all, had demonstrable effects on the actual architecture of the temple, or its archaeology for that matter̥ 

As such it is one more ingenuous product of brahmanical ritualistic speculation, and it carries its hallmark: abstractioṇ Taking its origin from the construction sacrifice, such as represented by the Manasarapuruṣa, and ultimately from the Puruṣamedha in the context of the make-shift fire-altar, the sacrifice of Man or sacrifial man is thus preserved in the concept of the Vāstupuruṣa. It

testifies to the civilizing force of brahmanical culture, which first banned human and then animal sacrifice, and which teaches us that even the most gruesome of religious practices can be viewed under the perspective of the sublime. Pace Xenophanes.
