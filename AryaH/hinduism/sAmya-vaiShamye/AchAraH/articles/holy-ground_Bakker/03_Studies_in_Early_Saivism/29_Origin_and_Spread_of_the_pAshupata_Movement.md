About Heracles, Lakulīśa and Symbols of Masculinity

Lāguḍi

The study of the origins of organized Saivism received a completely new perspective with the publication of the Pāśupatasūtras \(PS\) and Kauṇḍinya’s com-

mentary thereon, the Pañcārthabhāṣya, by r̥ Ananthakrishna Sastri in 1940. 

Research by Minoru Hara, Daniel Ingalls, Alexis Sanderson, Thomas Oberlies, Peter Bisschop, and Diwakar Acharya, to mention just the major players in this field, built on this new evidence and has paved the way for our present investigation, which draws heavily on their work. 1

For the last fifteen years we have also been fortunate to possess another source that comes from the same Pāśupata tradition and is chronologically not

too far removed from Kauṇḍinya. This text reflects the layman’s, laukika, view, rather than that of the initiated ascetic, who is the primary person treated by Kauṇḍinya. This text is the Skandapurāṇa \(SP\), whose composition we date between ad 550 and 650, which means that the text is probably about 200 years later than Kauṇḍinya’s commentary. Much had happened in India in those 200 years: it saw the rise and fall of the great Gupta Empire, the intrusion of Hunnic peoples, and the gradual recovery of centralized power in the new capital Kanauj \(Kanyakubja\) under the Maukharis and the great Harṣavardhana of Thanesar̥ 

The first thing that strikes us, when we compare the Skandapurāṇa’s account

of the well-known descent of Śiva in Kāyāvataraṇa \(called Kārohaṇa in SP and

known today as Karvan in Gujarat\) with that given by Kauṇḍinya, is that the uniqueness of this mystical event is no longer maintained. Reflecting the general Hindu and Buddhist conception of the time, viz. that a Buddha or a god incarnates on earth again and again in various forms and persons, the Skandapurāṇa makes Śiva’s descent in Gujarat a cyclic event: each world period

\( yuga\) had its own incarnation: Bhārabhūti in the Kr̥tayuga, Diṇḍimuṇḍa in

the Tretā, āṣāḍhi in the Dvāpara, and Lāguḍi in our Kali Age.2

Another development that apparently took place or gained prominence in the 5th to 6th centuries is that the avatāra  story in Kārohaṇa itself was revised. 

God is said in the Skandapurāṇa to have been born into the house of a certain

Somaśarman, who is said to belong to the lineage of the r̥ṣi  Atri, father of Soma, the Mooṇ 3 This new tradition may have been invented to account for a lineage of Pāśupata teachers who traced their pedigree back to Somaśarman, a topic that I have discussed in my paper Somaśarman, Somavaṁśa and So-

masiddhānta \(above, p. 283 ff.\). The Skandapurāṇa is, in all likelihood, the

first extant text that attests the name Lāguḍi \(variant: Lākulin\), meaning

‘club bearer’ \( laguḍa/lakuṭa: ‘club’; see above, p. 529\). However, this relatively late first attestation of the name ‘club bearer’ does not preclude the possibility that the association of this incarnation with the attribute of the club is much older̥ For this we have some indications. 

Early images of a club bearing ascetic or teacher

To begin with, there is an image found in Mathurā, 4 usually dated to the third

century ad on stylistic grounds, of a rather glum-faced, club-bearing ascetic. 

This figure might represent, either an ascetic associated with the Pāśupata

sect, or—less likely, because characteristic iconographic signs are absent—the incarnation of Śiva himself \(Plate 121\). 5

Secondly, the American scholar Daniel Ingalls, who compared the Pāśupata

sect with the school of the Greek Cynics, broke new ground in his paper Cynics and Pāśupata: the Seeking of Dishonor, when he conjectured that the name Lakulīśa, the Lāguḍi of the Skandapurāṇa, may have been derived from the Greek name Heracles, 

, ‘if it lost its first syllable in order to help out

a folk etymology’. 6 If this were correct, it might point to an \(iconographic\) influence of the Hellenistic school of the Cynics, whose patron saint was the club-bearing Heracles, on the movement of the Pāśupata. 

Ingalls’ wider suggestion, namely that the Pāśupata practice of seeking dis-

honour may have originated under the influence of the Cynics, has been met with scepticism by contemporary scholarship. Thomas Oberlies \(2000\) argued in his Kriegslisten und ungeziemendes Benehmen: Die Askesepraktiken der Pāśupatas that antinomian praxis, as part of the context of the brahmodya, is already attested in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa \(2.3.9.9\); the influence of Cynicism

in this particular respect, something that was conjectured by Ingalls, is therefore not required to explain the phenomenoṇ Though it may indeed be the case that the Pāśupata antinomian praxis in the second stage of the ascetic’s 2 Skandapurāṇa S recension \(SPS 167.112–117\) in Bisschop 2006.

career is an orthogenetic Indian development, the eponymous attribute of the saint, the laguḍa  or club, remains as yet unexplained. Let us reconsider the earliest iconographic evidence. 

The laguḍa or club

The first unquestionable visual representation of the divine Śaiva teacher with the attribute of the club is a fifth-century image from Mathurā. This sculpture

is understood to be an image of Lāguḍi or Lakulīśa \(Plate 122\).7 For rea-

son of comparison, and in order to explore further Ingalls’ supposedly Greek connection, I would like to draw attention to an image of Heracles found in A¨ı Khanum on the Darya-i Pandj River̥ This little bronze statuette \(height: 18.2 cm\) from the National Museum of Afghanistan \(G 04.42.8\) has been on display in the Musée Guimet \(Paris\) in 2007 and has since been touring in Europe and the USA \(Plate 123\). 8

The natural gnarls, which usually characterize Heracles’ cudgel and which in stylized form are visible on the club of the A¨ı-Khanum Heracles, resemble the phallic line pattern on the club of the Mathurā image \(Plate 125\): a Greek

symbol of masculinity encounters an Indian symbol of virility.

A¨ı Khanum, whose excavation by a French mission began in 1965, represents an important Hellenistic city founded in the wake of Alexander’s conquests in Central Asia \(329–27 bc\).9 This city, possibly Ptolemy’s ‘Alexandria on the Oxus’, 10 was once the centre of a hybrid culture in which East met Wesṭ

This is clear from, among other things, coins found of the Indo-Greek king Agathokles \(c. 170 bc\). They show two Indian deities, who have been identified as Vāsudeva \(Kr̥ṣṇa\), obverse, and Saṁkarṣaṇa \(Balarāma\), reverse. As

Härtel has observed, ‘these coins are the oldest examples at all of the pictorial representation of Hinduistic gods, a fact which cannot be emphasized enough’. 11

Elements of the syncretistic culture of Bactria reached western India with the entrance into the Subcontinent of Śaka tribes, who built a kingdom from Mathurā to southern Gujarat in the last decades before the Common Era. 

That Heracles remained a popular figure there till Kuṣāṇa rule is attested, for instance, by the so-called Hercules-type of coins of the Śaka ruler Rajuvula \(1st quarter 1st cenṭ ad\), some of which were found in Mathurā, 12 and a second-century ad image of Heracles and the Nemeian Lion, which was also found in Mathurā \(Plate 124\). 13

The raised arm is also gone. The lion is rather a weak animal. The group is not cut in the round, but is an altro-relievo  with a rough back, and has apparently formed one side of an altar̥ 

Cf. Harle 1986, 67 f. The ‘Indian Heracles’ of Greek sources, mentioned by Megasthenes et al. , is mostly identified as Kr̥ṣṇa, a deity very well at home in Mathurā \(Karttunen 1989, 211 f.\).

The origin of the Pāśupata movement

The Pāśupata movement originated under Śaka hegemony in that part of India where the figure of Heracles was known at the time. If the iconography of Heracles had exerted some influence on, or had moulded the figure of the club-bearing divine teacher, we would have expected this to become apparent in the sources that date to the period in which both, the figure of Heracles and the Pāśupata teacher, existed side by side, viz. the first centuries of the Common Era. However, neither our oldest source, the Pāśupatasūtras, nor Kauṇḍinya’s

commentary knows, either the club as an attribute, or the name Lāguḍi.14

Ingalls’ hypothesis, therefore, which assumes that the Greek Heracles launched the Indian Lakulīśa, is just as unlikely as his assumption that the Hellenistic school of the Cynics influenced the development of the Pāśupata practice. 

An orthogenetic root of the club-bearing deity seems therefore to be more obvious. The Amarakośa \(3.3.42\) mentions laguḍa  as a synonym of daṇḍa. It

is but natural to conceive of the club as a variant of the traditional stick or staff \( daṇḍa\) of the brahmin ascetic. The earliest Pāśupata monument known

to us, the Mathurā Pilaster of Candragupta II of the Gupta Year 61, i.e. ad 380 \(above, Plate 112\), 15 depicts a naked three-eyed figure with a daṇḍa  in his

right, and what is possibly a kamaṇḍalu  in his left hand \(Plate 126\). 16

Plate 126

Daṇḍapāṇi on Mathurā pilaster,  ge 61

14 The Mahābhārata knows the Pāśupata sect, its vow \( vrata\), doctrine \( jñāna\), and prac-

tice \( yoga\); it also knows the Pāśupata weapon \( astra\), which Śiva gave to Arjuna; for this weapon see below, p. 567. Lāguḍi/Lakulīśa is unknown to the MBh and so is his

club. 

15 CII III \(1981\), 240. 

16 The identity of this figure is disputed. That we are concerned with a divine figure follows from the third eye. Acharya 2005, 209 proposes to read the name of this deity as Caṇḍa. 

My designation ‘Daṇḍapāṇi’ is descriptive, it is not the proper name of the deity. 



29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement

559

Admittedly, the origin of the word laguḍa/ lakuṭa—attested, for instance, in Manusmr̥ti \(8.315\) and Mahābhārata \(7.29.16\) in the sense of ‘cudgel’ or

‘club’—remains as yet unclear̥ 17 But even if we do not accept Przyluski’s etymology that links the word to the Austro–Asiatic lāṅgula, meaning ‘stick’

or ‘penis’, 18 we may assume that phallic symbolism easily suggested itself to the Indian mind and came to be associated with this particular attribute. The phallic shape of the club in the earliest representations of the divine teacher, evident from the line pattern and its upright position \(Plate 125\), may have been prompted by the ithyphallic nature of this teacher and his prototype, Śiva. Thus, the club may have replaced the ascetic daṇḍa, by virtue of its more

outspoken phallic, i.e. Śaiva connotatioṇ 19 The name Lāguḍi, ‘club-bearer’, 

in Skandapurāṇa \(SPS 167.129\), Laguḍīśvara in SPS 167.169 \(interpolation\), Lākuli in Niśvāsamukha 3.19 \(Kafle 2015, 149\) and Lakulīśa, i.e. ‘Lord of the club-bearers’, in slightly later sources, e.g. the Guhyasūtra \(12.18\) of the

Niśvāsatattvasaṁhitā, derive all from this eponymous attribute. 20

The four disciples

Another major development \(in addition to the invention of the figure of Lāguḍi\) that took place in the 4th to 6th centuries is also attested by the Skandapurāṇa: Kuśika is no longer the only disciple. The number of disciples that is said to have been initiated by Lāguḍi himself has increased to four̥ 

These four are considered to have a semi-divine status; our text declares them to have sprung from the four faces of God \(Parameśāna\), out of His desire to

bestow grace \( anugraha\) upon the world:

17 See Manfred Mayrhofer, EWA ṣv. ‘ lakuṭa’: ‘Nicht erklärt’. 

18 Turner, CDIAL ṣv. ‘ lakuṭa’: ‘Ac. to J. Przyluski Pre-Aryan in sense “penis” is of same origin as lā ˙

ngula &c ← Austro-aṣ; but prob. same word as “stick”.’ Cf. Mayrhofer, KEWA ṣv. 

19 The Atharvavedapariśiṣṭa 40, dealing with the Pāśupatavrata, contains the following interesting passage, specifying what should be given to the initiated brahmin: tato ’sya mauñjiṁprayacchati  k

sāvitryā tu daṇḍaṁpālāśaṁbailvam āśvatthaṁvāsiṁlakuṭaṁkhaṭvā ˙

20 Lakulīśanātha in the Malhar \(Junvānī\) Copperplates of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57 \(above, 

p. 290\). The names Lakulin/Lakulīśa/Lakuladhārin are also known to the Pāśupatavidhi

texts discovered and published by Diwakar Acharya; for instance the Saṁskāravidhi

\(Acharya 2007\). The name ‘Nakulin/Lakulin’ is known from the list of 28 incarnations of Śiva as given in the Vāyupurāṇa 1.23 and Li ˙

ngapurāṇa 1.24. However, as Bisschop

2006, 43 ff. has argued convincingly ‘this list of twenty-eight avatāras  did not yet form

part of that text \[i.e. the Vāyupurāṇa\] at the time of composition of the Skandapurāṇa’. 

The earliest attestation of a group of ascetics named Lākuḍas seems to be a graffito on

Mount Kālañjara \(Bakker 2014, 196\).

You four should descend to earth to become twice-born ascetics. 

And after having led the brahmins to the supreme station, you, O masters of yoga, should return to Me. \(SPS 167.120\) The first disciple, Kuśika/Kauśika, is born in Ujjain and initiated there by Śiva’s incarnation himself, just as is in Kauṇḍinya’s version of the story \(above, ṇ 7 on p. 529 and p. 542\). But the venue has changed. The initiation according to the Skandapurāṇa takes place in the cremation ground instead of a temple. 

The Lord, smeared with ashes, is said to hold a firebrand \( ulmuka\) in his left hand \(SPS 167.127 f.\). This seems appropriate for a cremation ground and may suggest that the initiation included branding. Although it is tempting to hypothesize that the ascetic’s club has been mistakenly interpreted for what was originally a firebrand, this hypothesis has to be discarded, not only because of what has been said above, but also, more importantly, because images of Lakulīśa with a firebrand have never come to light and the ulmuka  is elsewhere never mentioned as one of his potential attributes. On the other hand, the firebrand as an attribute is found in some later images of Śiva as a teacher, in his so-called ‘Dakṣiṇāmūrti’.21

The ancient cremation ground in Ujjain has been identified. Locally known as Kumhār T

. ekḍī, this site was the subject of preliminary explorations by M.B. 

Garde in the season of 1938–39. Discovered there were skeletons in sitting posture, reflecting the normal way of interning yogins. Kuśika may have been one of them. 22 The specification of these four disciples in the Skandapurāṇa

allows us to catch a glimpse of the spread and ramification of the movement; it will be our subject in the final part of this essay.

29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement

561

Spread and ramification of the Pāśupata movement

From the Mathurā Pilaster of ad 380 we deduce that the Pāśupata movement had spread from South Gujarat to Mathurā before the end of the fourth cen-

tury. This is true for at least one tradition of gurus, the so-called ‘Vaimalas’, who traced their pedigree also directly back to Kuśika. In an image found in Mathurā that might be slightly later than the pilaster, the ithyphallic divine teacher—who, to judge by his attribute, is to be identified as Lāguḍi—is shown

with two disciples \(above, Plate 118\). 23 Evidently the Kuśika lineage \( paramparā\) as attested in Kauṇḍinya’s commentary needed to compete with one or more rival traditions that also claimed direct descent from Śiva’s incarnatioṇ 24

The Skandapurāṇa’s account of the four disciples of Lāguḍi, which would

become the standard, reflects this bifurcation, which may have started already in the 4th century, if not earlier̥ The earliest known image that shows four disciples seated around a divine teacher, however, comes only in the 6th century \(Plate 128\); it is found ‘above the doorway in the east vestibule to the great cave at Yogeśvarī near Bombay’, which is dated by Walter Spink to c. ad 525.25

25 Spink 1983, 243. Shah 1984, 88. The divine figure in the Yogeśvarī Cave seems to be four-armed: the left upper hand holds the rosary, the left lower hand the club, the right lower hand seems to make a vyākhānamudrā, whereas the right upper arm is missing \(cf. 

Shah 1984, 98\). This early Śaiva monument, just as the monuments at Mandapesvar and Elephanta, shows the flourishing of the Pāśupata movement in the middle of the

6th century, when the movement’s home country came under the control of the early Kalacuris, who extended their rule to the northern Konkan, where these monuments are preserved \(Spink 1983; cf. Mirashi in CII IV.1, xlvi f., cxlvii f.\). The Kalacuri king Kr̥ṣṇarāja in an inscription of his son \(Śaṁkaragaṇa\) datable to ad 597, is said to have

been devoted to Paśupati from the day of his birth \( janmana eva paśupatisamāśraya-

paraḥ , CII IV.1, 41\).

The account in the Skandapurāṇa tells us that the third disciple, who was

initiated in Mathurā, was named Mitra. No doubt there were many Mitras in Mathurā, but the mentioning of this name in this context may betray some historical awareness of the fact that the city of Mathurā, before the coming

of the Śakas, had been governed by a Mitra dynasty. 26 Making a \(legendary\) Mitra the fountainhead of a lineage of Pāśupata gurus in Mathurā would only

add to the authenticity of this traditioṇ 

The Skandapurāṇa suggests that before the Pāśupata teachers had settled

in Mathurā, the movement had reached the city of Jambumārga, to be located

between Ujjayanī and Mathurā. 27 In this city, the divine incarnation is said to

have initiated his second disciple Gārgya. The exact location of Jambumārga is

unknown, but it must have been an important Śaiva centre. Professor Tsuchida \(Tokyo\) has suggested to me that it may be the town called Mo-hi-shi-fa-lo-pu-lo, Maheśvarapura, visited by Xuanzang in the first quarter of the seventh century. The chinese pilgrim describes the place as follows. 

The produce of the soil and the manners of the people are like those of the kingdom of Ujjayanˆı. They greatly esteem the heretics and do not reverence the law of the Buddha. There are several tens of Dêva temples, and the sectaries principally belong to the Pâsupatas. The king is of the Brâhman caste; he places but little faith in the doctrine of Buddha. 28

The itinerary of the Chinese pilgrim suggests that Maheśvarapura lay on the route from Ujjain to the north through Chitor, that is on the axis Ujjain, Mandasor, Chitor, Puṣkara, Mathurā.29 The research of Elizabeth Cecil \(2016, 150 ff.\) has shown that the salt lake region north of Puṣkara, around Sikar–

Sambhar, traditionally known as Sapādalakṣa, in particular the excavation site

at Naliasar, 6 km from Sāmbhar \(Śākambharī\), may be another good candidate

for Jambumārga. 

In between Puṣkara and Ujjain is the village presently known as Nagarī, corresponding to the ancient town of Mādhyamika, which is located near Chitor

\(Xuanzang’s Chi-ki-to\) in Rajasthaṇ Just as in Maheśvarapura, Xuanzang reports a strong Śaiva presence in Chi-ki-to: ‘There are about ten Dêva temples, which some thousand followers frequent’ \(Beal II, 271\). The archaeological remains in Nagarī \(Mādhyamika\) testify to its importance as a Śaiva centre in the 5th and 6th centuries, predating Chitor̥ 30 We discuss the Nagarī remains in more detail elsewhere. 31

27 Cf. Bisschop 2006, 209.

29 See also Deloche 1980 I, 60 & Fig. 8. This appears to be the same route that is described in the Tīrthayātrāparvan \(MBh 3.80.59–71\). Another candidate for Maheśvarapura has been proposed by Michael Willis \(1997, 17\), who identifies this place with the village of Shivpur \(Shivpuri/Sipri\), c. 100 km west of Jhansi \(MP\), c. 240 km south of Mathurā. 

30 An image of Lakulīśa with four disciples is found built into the Rampol Gate of Chitorgarh, which is dated to ‘ca. seventh century’ by Shah 1984, 97 f., Pl. 84.

29 / Origin and Spread of the Pāśupata Movement

563

The route along which the Pāśupata religion moved north

Combining the evidence and the above conjectures, tentative as much of it may be, we could try to reconstruct the route along which the Pāśupata reli-

gion moved north in the fourth century. Coming from Karvan in Gujarat, and after having established itself in Ujjain in Western Malwa \(Madhya Pradesh\), it moved northwards along the ancient caravan route that connected the port of Bharukaccha \(Bharuch\) at the mouth of the Narmadā River, through Uj-

jain, with Puṣkara in Rajasthan and the town of Mathurā further-on in Uttar Pradesh. 

On this route Jambumārga, Maheśvarapura, became a Pāśupata

stronghold like Ujjain and Mathurā \(Figure 15\). 

The movement did not end in Mathurā. The Skandapurāṇa speaks of the

fourth disciple of Lāguḍi as a man born in the Kuru country, i.e. Kurukṣetra, but it stops short of mentioning him by name \(see above, p. 527\). This puruṣa issued from the fourth face of Śiva is said to have been initiated by Lāguḍi in

Kanyakubja, the city of Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh \(SPS 167, 129\). We take this as an indication that Kanauj had become another important centre of the Pāśupata sect in the 5th or 6th century. The explicit mentioning of the birth of the fourth disciple in the Land of the Kurus strongly suggests that this region too, with its capital Thanesar \(Sthāneśvara\), had become a mainstay of the

new faith. The rise of the city of Kanauj as the political \(and cultural\) capital of Northern India in the 6th century, made that it became the base from where the movement spread over North India and beyond, into Magadhā, Nepal and

Southeast Asia \(Cambodia\). 

The origin of a pan-Indian religion

The Skandapurāṇa describes the four disciples, after they had been initiated \( anugr̥hya\), as apostles of the Pa˜ncārtha doctrine. 

Lāguḍi \(the divine incarnation\) bestowed on them ‘**H**is own doctrine’ \(Svasiddhānta\) and yoga, and spoke:

This is the final mystical teaching known as Pañcārtha. It has been proclaimed

to you in order that you liberate the brahmins from the fetters of death. You should make the brahmins reach the highest station by initiating them \(in this teaching\). Your dwelling places shall be on sacred river banks, in holy sanctuaries, as well as in deserted houses and forests, excluded from society. 

Having heard this word of Lord Paśupati Himself, all these four disciples, being enlightened by God, did as they were told. 32

To pursue the further course of the Pāśupata religion will remain a future task.

in many respects unique, mystical event, the religious enlightenment of the brahmin saint Kuśika in Ujjain, developed into a pan-Indian cult of Lakulīśa. 

The author Kauṇḍinya gives the impression of still being in direct touch with the origins of the movemenṭ He relates how the divine incarnation reached Ujjain by foot, a touching detail, and suggests that the authenticity of this event can be confirmed by the still visible traces that have been left behind. 33 In the two hundred years between Kauṇḍinya and the composition of the Skandapurā-ṇa great developments had taken place. There had risen a number of gurus, no doubt rivals with one another, who claimed that their respective lineages \( paramparā\) hailed back to a disciple of the divine incarnatioṇ To unite them, the idea of multiple disciples—first two, and then four—was invented. 

In an orthogenetic process—or, less likely, a heterogenetic one through the influence of the Hellenistic figure of Heracles—the divine incarnation who was believed to have initiated these four disciples somehow came to be called Lāguḍi

or Lakulīśa. Once the idea was accepted that this Lāguḍi had operated not

only in Kārohaṇa and Ujjain, but had initiated in Śaiva centres such as Jambumārga, Mathurā and another as far off as Kanyakubja, there was no longer a reason not to claim that he had operated in other places as well. The last vestige of historicity vanished. It was replaced by the belief that there had been incarnations of Śiva in all world periods: Lakulīśa was just one of them. 

And why should God limit his range to western India? This new view is evident in a passage in the Skandapurāṇa that has been shown by Peter Bisschop to be

an interpolation in the earliest extant recension of the text, the one preserved in Nepal \(SPS\). 34 This passage runs as follows:

Tradition has it that there are eight holy places of Śiva \(Śaśimaulin\) in the land of Magadhā, through which Laguḍīśvara wandered, surrounded by his pupils. When one has visited those, a man will be at once redeemed from sins. 35

Thus developed an elitist faith of ascetic virtuosi into a catholic religioṇ The anonymous saviour of Kauṇḍinya turned into just another manifestation of the divine, his worship into just another form of Śiva devotioṇ
