An Artist’s Impression

\! 

Friends, if you will permit me, let me be that kavi  today. 1 Allow me to take advantage of this unique occasion to read an essay in the indicative mood. No modal auxiliaries: neither ‘would’ nor ‘should’; neither ‘may’ nor ‘could’. In other words, a thoroughly unscholarly exposition, but a, hopefully light, and delightfully careless artist’s impression, which puts ‘how beautiful it may have been, possibly’ into an apodictic style: ‘so beautiful it was, definitely’. After all, an artist’s impression is, according to the infallible Wikipedia, ‘the representation of a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available’. 

So it came to pass, 

When Avantivarman ascended the Maukhari throne in Kanyakubja in the last quarter of the sixth century, it may have appeared as if the old days of stability and prosperity had returned to Madhyadeśa. Thanks to the incessant war efforts of his grandfather, Īśānavarman, the cruel intruders called Hūṇas had

been driven back to the foothills of the western Himālayas after a long and

devastating period of war̥ A close friendship had developed between the rulers in Kanyakubja and Sthāneśvara, where the dynasty of the Vardhanas guarded

the western part of the kingdom. The eastern enemies, the Gauḍas and their allies the Guptas, had been forced to take refuge at the borders of the ocean, where they were being kept in check by Kanyakubja’s powerful southern allies in Dakṣiṇa Kosala, who traced their respectable pedigree straight back to Pāṇḍu and his mighty son Arjuna.

The ancient land of the Buddha and the cradle of empire was firmly under control. Avantivarman proudly bore the title ‘sovereign of Magadhā’. A

Buddhist settlement there was developing into a place of learning of high international repute. The university of Nālandā attracted students and scholars

from all over India and abroad, and the Maukhari king, though not a Buddhist, prided himself on being its chancellor̥ 

The monarch watched over the Bull of the Dharma, which was shepherded by his countrymeṇ The Bull, shown on the royal seal, had in recent years become a forceful emblem, a symbol appropriated by another religion, one to which the Maukharis had confessed ever since they had thrown off the yoke of the Imperial Guptas with their state deity Viṣṇu. Worship of Śiva had opened up new avenues for the imagination and enshrined royal authority in burgeoning forms of early tantric Hinduism. 

Though familiar with all sorts of asceticism, northern India in the sixth century saw a new type of strange sādhus travelling around, who smeared

themselves with ashes and imitated the god of their devotion, Śiva Paśupati. 

A lineage of gurus  pertaining to this movement had settled in Kanyakubja, an establishment founded in the capital by a saint from Kurukṣetra, the ancient battlefield, now firmly under the control of the friendly Vardhanas or Puṣya-bhūtis, who themselves had become staunch followers of this type of religioṇ 

Avantivarman, too, was well disposed towards them and invited some of them to his courṭ 

The Pāśupatas, as these Śiva worshippers were called, made good use of the patronage that fell to their loṭ They set up religious centres \( sthāna\), temples

\( āyatana\) and monasteries \( maṭha\) at the country’s holiest grounds, such as the Kapālasthāna in Kurukṣetra, Bhadreśvara near Gaṅgādvāra, the great Deva temple, āyatana, in Prayāga, and the siddhasthāna, ‘home of the saints’, called

Madhyameśvara, circa  one kilometer north of the renowned cremation grounds of Avimukta or Vārāṇasī. 

A network of itinerant sādhus connected these centres, which became well

integrated with the local religious infrastructure and developed into junctions within a fabric of yogins and religious teachers. The Pāśupatas had had a

good look at their Buddhist counterparts and had copied their formula for success, namely a standing organisation of professional religious specialists—

yogins, ascetics, and ācāryas—supported by a following of ordinary devotees, the Māheśvara community at large, to whose spiritual needs it catered. One of the peculiar facilities offered to the community of laukikas, by at least some of these Pāśupata ascetics, was to extend services in and around the cremation grounds. 

Living in the cremation ground was a highly acclaimed strategy within Pāśupata asceticism. Mahākāla in Ujjain, Mahākapāla in Thanesar, 

Avimukteśvara in Benares, Paśupatinātha in Nepal, to mention just the best

known, were run by Pāśupatas and became key to their success. 

Avantivarman, therefore, acted in tune with the spirit of his time when he supported the movemenṭ Earlier his uncle Sūryavarman had spent large sums

on the rebuilding of a dilapidated temple of the ‘Foe of Andhaka’, whose images were beginning to appear around this time. The prince had hired a poet to sing the praises of the god as well as of himself, chiselled into stone, for everyone to read:

May that figure of Andhaka’s Foe, on whose body snakes glimmer, offer you a stable abode—a figure who wears a lion skin that is slightly crimsoned by the light of the jewel in the hood of the serpent \[that is his sacred thread\], and who reddens the white line of skulls that is the chaplet by the radiance from his third eye, and who bears on his crest the slender, darkness dispelling digit of the mooṇ 

He \(the prince\) had youth that was beautiful like the waxing moon and dear to all the world; he was at peace and his mind was devoted to reflection on the branches of learning; he had mastered fully \(all\) the arts; it was as if Lakṣmī \(fortune\), Kīrti \(fame\) and Sarasvatī \(learning\), among others, vied with one another for his patronage: in the world, women in love experience the feeling \(of love\) all the more, if their lover is beloved. 2

Poets were held in high esteem and Avantivarman invited them to his courṭ 

Imagine the glamorous world in which plays like the Mudrārākṣasa were staged, 

attended by the playwright Viśākhadatta in person, or the Kaumudīmaho-

tsava, to mention another play, in which the entrance of the ruler himself is announced:

A son of the House of Magadhā has arrived, thronged by hundreds of eminent

ministers, like the moon enhanced by an aureole of stars, that prince, who is a feast for the eyes of his delighted subjects. 3

This is the world in which Sanskrit flourished, the world in which the kavi Bhatsu, Bāṇa’s respected teacher, was honoured by crowned heads. This court was sustained by the inhabitants of Kanyakubja who, in the words of the famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, were ‘honest and sincere, noble and gracious in appearance, clothed in ornamented and bright-shining fabrics’, inhabitants who

‘applied themselves much to learning, and in their travels were very much given to discussion on religious subjects, whereas the fame of their pure language was far spread’. 4 To this court the leading figures of the community of Māheśvaras

were also welcomed. Sanskrit was their language and in Sanskrit they composed their learned treatises and witty mythology. 

For learned treatises and religious expositions the educated classes of northern India looked to Vārāṇasī. This trading town on the River Ganges had emerged under the Guptas in the preceding century as a centre of traditional Hindu learning. The arrival of the Pāśupata movement added to its reputation for

holiness, whereas the collective Sanskrit learning of the town added to the literary achievements of the Māheśvaras.

The composition of the two classic Sanskrit epics was closed by the fourth century. Some of the new religious ideas concerning the god Śiva had still made it into the latest layers of the Mahābhārata. After the Rāmāyaṇa had been

completed, mythology related to the tutelary deity of the Gupta Empire, Viṣṇu, and his popular manifestation of Kr̥ṣṇa in particular, had found expression in an Appendix to the great epic, the Harivaṁśa, as well as in a new type of

Sanskrit text styled ‘Ancient Lore’, i.e. Purāṇa. 

The Purāṇa as a literary genre in its first stages of development dealt with the creation of the universe, the origin of the world and its royal dynasties. 

However, as for instance the Viṣṇupurāṇa had shown, the genre also lent itself perfectly to the circulation of popular, religious and mythological material. 

After the civilized world had recovered from a period of devastating wars and invasions, and now that Viṣṇu had ceded his place of prominence to Śiva, the sixth century embraced a new form of devotioṇ The time had come to collect the mythology of the Great God. In the words of the Skandapurāṇa: ‘Having

heard the story of Bhārata as well as the Ancient Lore, we wish to hear about the birth of Śiva’s son, Kārttikeya.’

A senior brahmin member of the Māheśvara community in Vārāṇasī, well-

versed in Sanskrit literature, an expert on the epic tradition, initiated in the Pāśupata sacred texts, in short, a brahmin with great prestige among his fellow believers, charismatic and dynamic, that man, let us call him the Sūta, took

the initiative to fulfil this wish and to compose a Purāṇa text that would do

justice to the rich mythology of Śiva and his family, that would be accessible to the whole community, and, last but not least, that would validate local claims of the sanctity of holy ground by telling their Māhātmyas. In order to possess

this authority, the text should be in the anonymous, pseudohistoric style of the Purāṇa, reportedly spoken by a sage of yore with intimate knowledge of the Great God’s own thoughts and deeds. 

It happened in the days of Avantivarman’s reign that a group of kindred spirits and literary talents convened in an institution of the community in Benares. They discussed the plan and pledged their commitmenṭ The Sūta, 

the editor-in-chief, began his composition in Śloka verses, while an inventory was being agreed on of the myths, stories, topics and places that had to be treated in the course of the work, a narrative that was designed to lead to the birth, consecration and heroic deeds of Kārttikeya, but could not reach

that point before an extensive cycle of Andhaka myths had been told first—

Andhaka who, like the Mleccha foes of the Maukharis, could not be slain until after an endless series of battles. 5

The materials were arranged in a preliminary order in versified form. This inventory or blueprint, Anukramaṇikā as it was called, has survived and come down to us in the second adhyāya  of the Skandapurāṇa. The editor-in-chief

was assisted by some editors who were assigned specific portions of the com-5 SPBh 130–56.

positioṇ The Pāśupata network was called in to assemble information about places sacred to the Māheśvara community. Sometimes this resulted in new

collaborators entering the group, bringing in local knowledge couched in Māhā-

tmya-style texts, sometimes the editor himself used the information to compose the story. Rarely were ready-made texts taken from existing literature. The Sūta guaranteed the unity of literary style and the quality of the Sanskrit, but this could not prevent minor differences remaining. He also took great care that the arrangement of stories, the complex narrative structure of the text, remained consistent and logical. However, soon it appeared that the original blueprint could not be implemented except in broad outline; the myths and stories composed had too powerful a dynamic of their own to link up with each other perfectly. Here the genius of the Sūta was most needed and he did a

brilliant job. 6

The Pāśupata network was strongest along the east-west axis, Vārāṇasī–

Kanyakubja–Kurukṣetra. It had been decided to begin in the west, since it was one of the underlying aims of the work to cover, or rather to recover the entire landscape of northern India, transforming it into sacred space, a landscape on which the deeds of the Great God and his entourage had bestowed holiness at the beginning of time. The work was well under way—the myths relating to Kurukṣetra and the Sarasvatī, Sthāneśvara, Bhadreśvara and Kanakhala, and Vārāṇasī itself had been composed, and the Vindhyavāsinī Cycle was drafted—

when political reality threatened to disrupt the literary activity. A joint attack from the east and the southwest brought to an end the rule of the Maukharis, just when Grahavarman had succeeded his father Avantivarman, while that of its allies in Thanesar was shaking on its foundations. For a while Benares came under the control of the easterners, the Gauḍas. 

A young prince, a kumāra  from Sthāneśvara, installed as chief of the army

on the banks of the Sarasvatī, as it were the embodiment of Skanda himself, came to the rescue of the kingdom of Kanyakubja. In a war that lasted several years, Harṣavardhana succeeded in pushing the Gauḍas under their king

‘Moon’, Śaśāṅka, back across the rivers Soṇa and Gaṇḍakī. 

In about ad 606, the political situation had stabilized enough to organize a magnificent royal coronation ceremony. Harṣavardhana was enthroned in Kanyakubja. It would take Harṣa six more years, however, to consolidate his sovereignty over the combined hereditary lands of the Vardhanas and Maukharis, including Magadhā, and before finally, to paraphrase the closing metaphor of Harṣa’s Deeds sung by the greatest writer of the time, Bāṇa—‘After a day of bloody contest, at the fall of night, while the sinking sun crimsoned the sky and the waters of the ocean, the Fame of his House, the Glory of his Rule, and the Force of his Destiny united to hand over to him a pale-looking Mooṇ’

6 An illustration of this intricate process is the inclusion of the legend of the seven brahmins into the Vindhyavāsinī Cycle, for which see Yokochi’s Introduction SP III, 15–22.

Vārāṇasī was back in the kingdom of Kanyakubja, but the new political situation had an effect on the perspective and scope of the composition in progress. 

To begin with, the historical consecration of a young prince \( kumāra\) on the

banks of the Sarasvatī to lead an army against the Gauḍa king Moon \( śaśāṅka\), reflected the mythology of Skanda, the main subject of the Purāṇa—Skanda, 

the god of war, who, after his consecration as General \( senāpati\) on the banks

of the same river, led the Devas against the Asuras in order to destroy the demon king Star \( tāraka\). 7 The composers decided to bring their work to the attention of King Harṣavardhana, soliciting his blessing. After all, Harṣa himself confessed to be a paramamāheśvara, and his court offered a venue to

the most promising literary men of the country, among whom was the king himself. 

Secondly, the king’s military successes against Gauḍa called attention to the east, bringing a Śaiva settlement in western Gauḍa within the purview of the composers. The Sūta, or his successor, made the decision to conclude

the sanctification of the sacred landscape of northern India in Koṭivarṣa, an important commercial and religious centre in the province of Puṇḍra, which was situated 80 km northeast of the army camp of King Harṣa on the Lower Ganges, the camp where the king would eventually meet the Chinese pilgrim. 

The concluding chapters of the Purāṇa were reserved for philosophy and an

exposition of Pāśupata yoga, which, along with devotion and pilgrimage, would bring the Māheśvara, yogin and layman alike, to paradise, the City of Śiva at the top of the universe \(SPBh 183\). 

The day arrived when the composition of the Purāṇa was concluded and the

text could be copied into a carefully prepared book, a pustaka, that could be offered to the Great God and donated to the king and the community of the Māheśvaras. As usual when a work of such magnitude was completed, a solemn occasion had to be found when parts of the work could be recited and the book could be consecrated and ritually entrusted to a temple. Such an occasion was King Harṣa’s ‘arena of charitable offerings’, a spectacular event that was staged every five years at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and Yamunā. The great

āyatana  or temple of Deva there would be an excellent repository. 

The permission was obtained. In the middle of Harṣa’s reign, when he was at the pinnacle of power, a great assembly of feudatories, Śramaṇas, and Brahmins, convened in Kanyakubja around the beginning of the New Year, in preparation of the quinquennial evenṭ The procession to Prayāga and the festivities

there were part of the Festival of Spring in the month of Caitra. The king rode on his magnificent elephant Darpaśāta towards Prayāga, scattering pearls and

other riches, while dressed as Indra. His mobile court offered splendid opportunities for staging theatrical productions, first and foremost, of course, those of 7 SPBh 163–65.

his owṇ The Sūtradhāra in the Ratnāvalī and Priyadarśikā introduces Harṣa’s

plays:

Today, on the occasion of the Spring Festival, I have been respectfully called by the assembly of kings, which has convened from all quarters of the world, and which is subservient to the lotus-feet of King Śrī-Harṣadeva. I have been addressed as follows: ‘We have heard by hearsay that a play entitled Ratnāvalī, which is

embellished by an unprecedented arrangement of the material, was composed by our lord Śrī-Harṣa, but we have not yet seen it performeḍ’ 8

The play turned out to be a great success, and would stand the test of time. 

But Harṣavardhana was too great a king to hear only his own voice. A date for the first recitation of the Skandapurāṇa was agreed oṇ The Sūta and his

team were offered their platform. In order to sustain the illusion of its being a work from time immemorial, an essential feature of the genre of Ancient Lore, a professional reader, a pustakavācaka, was asked to recite iṭ The first

presentation of the work went ahead before an audience including the king, courtiers, sādhus, monks, literati of all sorts, pandits and a selection of educated Māheśvaras. It was a great tamāśā, going by the consolidated words of the Sūta

and his fellow kavi, Bāṇa:

The sages, assembling in Prayāga to bathe in the confluence of the Gaṅgā and

Yamunā on the day of full moon, see the Singer of Ancient Lore coming towards them to pay his respects. 

Dressed in white silk made in Puṇḍra, his forehead marked by a tilaka  consisting of lines of orpiment on a white clay coating, his topknot ornamented by a small bunch of flowers, his lips reddened by betel, and his eyes beautified by lines of collyrium, he takes his seat and begins his performance. 

He pauses for a moment before he places, on a desk made of reed stalks that is put in front of him, a pustaka, which, although its wrapping has been removed by that time, is still wrapped, as it were, in the halo of his nails, which shine softly like the fibres of a lotus. 

They ask him about the birth of Kārttikeya, a story that equals the Mahābhārata

and surpasses the Purāṇa, both of which he had recited in the Naimiṣa forest on the occasion of a brahmasattra. 

Then, while he assigns two places behind him to two flautists, Madhukara, ‘the bee’, and Pārāvata, ‘the turtle-dove’, his close associates, he turns over the fron-tispiece, takes a small bundle of folios, and announces the story of the birth of Skanda, of his friendliness towards brahmins, his glory and his heroism, greater than that of the gods. 

By his chanting he enchants the hearts of his audience with sweet intonations, evoking as it were, the tinkling of the anklets of Sarasvatī, as she presents herself in his mouth, while it seems as if, by the sparkling of his teeth, he whitewashes the ink-stained syllables and worships the book with showers of white flowers. 9

Hans Bakker

The performance received favourable reactions. After having done their ritual duties, attended the great potlatch ceremony at the confluence, and paid obeisance to the Great God in his temple and the king in his court, the Sūta and

his entourage returned to Vārāṇasī. More copies of the book were produced. 

Small emendations were made and the first transcriber’s faults slipped iṇ The different versions of the text were borṇ 

The subsequent transmission and distribution of the Purāṇa over various

centres of the Māheśvaras added more flaws. The copying took place in focal points of Sanskrit learning, to the west and the east of Vārāṇasī. In Maga-

dhā, some Pāśupata ācāryas  were not entirely satisfied with the texṭ They missed in particular an account of the Lakulīśa tradition in their own country, and, in general, they felt that the holy places in the east and in the north, in Magadhā, Orissa and Nepal, had not been done justice. They decided to amend this shortcoming by inserting an additional list of tīrthas  in an adhyāya

that appeared to be the right place for iṭ 10

While these processes were underway, the political situation in India changed dramatically. What a few years earlier had still seemed far away or downright impossible, happened. Harṣa’s empire collapsed. Chaos prevailed all over northern India, whereas the Northeast was confronted by an unprecedented military invasion from Nepal and Tibeṭ 

Magadhā was the first country in which order was restored under the authority of the dynasty of the Later Guptas. The daughter of ādityagupta married

the Maukhari prince Bhogavarman, a wise move, contributing significantly to political stability. And while the kingdoms of Kanyakubja, Puṇḍra and Kāmarūpa were still in disarray, the Gupta House of Magadhā consolidated its power

further by re-establishing good relations with its northern neighbour, the Licchavi kingdom of Nepal. A daughter born of the marriage with the Maukhari prince, Vatsadevī, was married off to the Licchavi king Śivadeva. 

During the last two decades of the seventh century, relations with Nepal became close and cultural exchange between the two countries intensified. Pāśu-

pata yogins and ācāryas  wandered from Magadhā into Nepal to visit the great

shrine of Paśupatinātha, which had developed into a state sanctuary and received substantial financial support from Vatsadevī and her Nepalese husband. 

The priesthood of this temple was firmly in the hands of a local branch of Pāśupatas. They were happy with the growing reputation of their temple. It brought them pilgrims from afar and their coffers filled accordingly. At the same time the intensive traffic kept them up-to-date with new religious developments and informed about the latest literary productions. 

Thus the reputation of the Skandapurāṇa spread to Nepal, and friends in

Magadhā were asked for a copy. They brought one, naturally a manuscript that contained the insertion mentioning Paśupatinātha in Nepāla. The new

acquisition was treasured. In order to preserve the text, the manuscript was 10 SPS 167.163–87.

copied in the century that followed. And so it happened that on the twelfth day of the bright half of the month of Caitra in the year 234 \(= ad 810/11\) a scribe in Nepal could complete his work on the Skandapurāṇa, a labour that he had

undertaken for the sake of the perfection of all beings. It would become our manuscript S . And, if it has not contributed to our perfection, we ourselves 1

are the only ones to blame. 

I began my lecture today with a quote from ānandavardhana’s Dhvanyāloka:

‘In the boundless universe of literature the author alone is god. In it the world revolves as per his liking.’ 11 The scenario presented here is indeed to my liking, but as you have, no doubt, understood, it is just one possible scenario among others. I hope that the reader can appreciate it for what it is and will not lose sight of its speculative nature. Nevertheless, it is the most plausible one that I can come up with after twenty years of study of the text and context of the Skandapurāṇa. It was a work of the longue durée, too long maybe for

modern adepts of bibliometrics, but not so for building a dedicated team of fellow students. A day like this proves that I am right at least in that respecṭ 

Western indologists usually leave the pre-modern history of the Subcontinent to their Indian colleagues. For this there are no good arguments, especially not, if we realize that classical Indian culture and religion cannot be fully comprehended without situating them in their proper historical and geographical contexṭ I am fortunate in having two friends who share this view with me. Michael Willis, the active curator of South Asia at the British Museum, and Ellen Raven, just as active, working in the University of Leideṇ Walking together in the field, or down in the storage rooms of the BM, Michael has always surprised me with cute and innovative insights. They have influenced my view of Gupta India to no small degree. 

Without Ellen and her work I would have been a blind man in another field, one which forms a most important source of early Indian history and iconography, numismatics. Not only has Ellen opened my eyes for the beauty of the Gupta coinage, she has also always found time to answer my many queries and has been willing to help me out with splendid photos from her incredible database of Indian coins. But maybe most importantly, Ellen’s scholarly cautiousness and meticulousness has often kept me from rash conclusions. As a pair, if I may say so, Michael and Ellen are a student-of-Indian-history’s best friends. 

Our study of the Skandapurāṇa has been team work from the early nineties

of the last century. It is entirely to the credit of Harunaga Isaacson and Rob Adriaensen that this project got off the ground. Rob had been my mainstay and support from my college days. His spirit lives on in all we do until this very momenṭ And just as great a privilege it has been to have Haru among my students and soon as a great colleague and team member̥ The critical edition 11

Hans Bakker

of the Skandapurāṇa as it has crystallized over the long years of intensive collaboration is unthinkable without his genius. 

One of the wonders of my career has been that time and again generations of students showed the interest, capacity, and stamina to join our work on the world of the Purāṇa. Yuko Yokochi, Peter Bisschop and Natasja Bosma, you have brought the kalpavr̥kṣa  into blossom. Without your studies hardly a word of what I have said this afternoon could have been spokeṇ To quote an old love of mine, the philosopher Aristotle: ‘In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the whole is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the totality is something besides the parts, there is a cause of unity; \[. . . \].’ 12 This cause of unity, I would like to argue, is the form \(

\) of scholarship that you

embody. I am deeply obliged.
