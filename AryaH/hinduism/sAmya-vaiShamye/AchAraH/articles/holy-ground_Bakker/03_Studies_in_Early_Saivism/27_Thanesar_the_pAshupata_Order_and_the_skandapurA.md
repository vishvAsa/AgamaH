Studies in the Skandapurāṇa IX

The tradition of the four pupils of Lāguḍi

By the middle of the sixth century the city of Kanauj seems to have emerged as the capital of the rising dynasty of the Maukharis under its king Īśānavarmaṇ 1

This town, in the Sanskrit tradition named Kānyakubja/ Kanyakubja, is known

from the Skandapurāṇa, and from this text only, as the seat of one of the Pāśupata lineages. 

The Skandapurāṇa \(SPS 167.123–29\) informs us that the fourth pupil of Lāguḍi was a brahmacārin  who came from a distinguished family in the \(Land of the\) Kurus. 2 He received initiation in Kanyakubja and, as implied by SPS

167.130, established the fourth lineage of Pāśupata teachers there. 

Lāguḍi

bestowed on him \(and the other three pupils\) ‘**H**is own doctrine’ \(and\) yoga. 3

∗ The first version of this article was published in Journal of Indological Studies 19 \(2007\), 1–16. 

1 As far as I am aware, there exists no direct evidence for this statemenṭ 

There is

circumstantial evidence, though, which has led the majority of historians to accept it as the most plausible hypothesis. Tripathi 1964, 32–36; Majumdar in HCI III, 69 f.; Goyal 1967, 363; Thaplyal 1985, 19 f. Among this evidence is the clay seal-matrix, probably to be ascribed to Avantivarman, that was found in Kanauj \(Thaplyal 1985, 153\). The major argument for Kanauj being the Maukhari capital, at least at the time of Grahavarman, is based on the evidence of Bāṇa’s Harṣacarita \(see Tripathi 1964, 32–36\). 

2 We deduce from this evidence that the name of the fourth pupil was unknown to the composer of the SP, but that there was a living tradition that connected him with the Kurus or Kurukṣetra. In order to supply a name for the founder of this lineage, this tradition later invented the name Kauruṣya \(LiP 1.7.51, 1.24.131, ŚiP Śatarudrasaṁhitā

5.49\) or Kauruṣa \(see above, ṇ 16 on p. 287\).

The route along which the Pāśupata movement had reached the Land of the

Kurus may also be deduced from the Skandapurāṇa: 1\) Kārohaṇa \(where Śiva’s

incarnation took place\), 2\) Ujjayanī \(initiation of Kauśika\), 3\) Jambumārga

between Ujjayanī and Puṣkara \(initiation of Gārgya\), 4\) Mathurā \(initiation of Mitra\), 5\) Land of the Kurus, 6\) Kanyakubja \(initiation of the Kuru\). 4

The major city in the ‘Land of the Kurus’ in the 5th and 6th centuries was Thanesar̥ In his Harṣacarita Bāṇa depicts Thanesar \(Sthāṇvīśvara\) under \(the legendary\) King Puṣyabhūti as a country completely devoted to Maheśvara.5

It is therefore not impossible, at least it is suggested by the Skandapurāṇa, that

the Pāśupata movement had reached Kanauj from Gujarat via Kurukṣetra and had thus passed through Thanesar̥

SPS 167.130 thus defines the svasiddhānta  doctrine as ‘Pañcārtha’ and explicitly declares

that these four pupils have the right to initiate, i.e. that they are established as the founders of four lineages.

Some information about this ‘Kuru lineage’ seems to have survived the ages. The \(Jaina\) tradition—preserved in Guṇaratna’s \(fourteenth century\) commentary on the S

. aḍdarśanasamuccaya of Haribhadra \(ninth century\) and

Rājaśekharasūri’s S

. aḍdarśanasamuccaya \(fourteenth century\)—records the

first four names of the teachers in each of the four lineages that are said to derive from Lakulīśa. The fourth teacher, here named Kauruṣa, was succeeded by Manuṣyaka, Puṣpaka and Rāśīkara.6

Lāguḍi

The idea of a guru with four pupils named Lāguḍi/Lākulin or Lakulīśa seems to

be an example of ‘invention of tradition’. Kauṇḍinya does not know a teacher \(incarnation\) by the name of Lakulīśa, but speaks only about the Lord \( bhagavat\) descending in Kāyāvataraṇa \(= Kārohaṇa\), who initiated only one pupil, Kuśika, in the city of Ujjayanī. 7 Nor does the name Lakulīśa, or any of its variants, occur in the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta II, Year 61. 8 It may have been coined in the fifth century to refer to the \(divine\) teacher who carried a club \( laguḍa\), portrayed in several fifth-century images, and as such came to be attested in the Skandapurāṇa. 9

The apparently oldest image of an ithyphallic Śaiva teacher with a lakula resting against his left shoulder is accompanied by only two pupils and may date from the 5th century \(Plate 118\). 10

Plate 118

Mathurā: Lakulīśa with two pupils

In the first half of the 6th century images of Lakulīśa surrounded by four pupils began to appear, such as the one in the Yogeśvarī Cave near Bombay \(below, Plate 128\). 11

In short, at some stage in the process by which the Pāśupata movement

was gathering momentum, the avatāra  of Śiva/Paśupati received the name

Lāguḍi/Lākulin/Lakulīśa. It became an article of faith common to various traditions, on the one hand serving to account for the spread of several guru lineages that claimed to go back to Śiva’s incarnation and, on the other hand, uniting these into one coherent religious movemenṭ 

The Kuru lineage

Puṣpaka in the Kuru \(Kauruṣa\) lineage evokes the name of the \(alleged\) founder of the Paśupatinātha Temple in Nepal, Supuṣpa.12 It may also remind one of 11 Shah 1984, 98, Pl. 88. 

12 The foundation of this temple is credited to a \(legendary\) king of the Licchavi dynasty, named Supuṣpadeva in the \(corrupt\) Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī \(ff. 19v–20r\):

rājā śrīsupuṣpadeva varṣa 76  k tena hi nepālabhūmiś cāturvarṇakr̥ tā  k śrīpaśupati-

This Supuṣpa is also known from the genealogy of King Jayadeva, the same who recorded the name of his maternal grandfather, the Maukhari prince Bhogavarman \(see below, p. 538\): tasmāl licchavitaḥ pareṇa nr̥ patīn hitvā parān dvādaśa śrīmān puṣpaśarākr̥tih. 

kṣitipatir jātah. supuṣpas tatah. | \(Verma & Singh 1994, 238\). According to Slusser 1982, 227 this king is ‘alternately known as Paśuprekha \(he who has seen Paśupati\)’. A later \(equally legendary\) Licchavi king, Supuṣpavarman, is said in the Gopālarājavaṁśāvalī

to have renovated the temple of Paśupati:

Puṣyabhūti, a name spelled in some mss as Puṣpabhūti, the legendary founder of the dynasty of Thanesar to which King Harṣavardhana belongeḍ13

Puṣyabhūti is depicted in the Harṣacarita 3 \(pp. 49–55\) as being deeply involved in a Śaiva ritual of black magic \(Vetālasādhana\) in the cremation

ground \(Mahāśmaśāna\), under the guidance of a Mahāśaiva preceptor \( bhu-

vanaguru\) hailing from the South \( dākṣiṇātya\), Bhairavācārya.14 In this ritual the deity \( vāstunāga\) of the land \( janapada\) Śrīkaṇṭha, in which Sthāṇvīśvara \(Puṣyabhūti’s capital\) is situated,15 the Nāga Śrīkaṇṭha is conjured up by the

ācārya; 16 he is forced into submission by the king, who is about to kill him with the magic sword Aṭṭahāsa, a gift of Bhairavācārya. Then, when the king is prepared to let him go because of his brahminhood, a goddess dressed in white, evidently Lakṣmī \(Rājyaśrī\),17 emerges from the sword, annoints the king and grants Puṣyabhūti to become the founder of a mighty dynasty. This dynasty is therefore believed to have acquired its legitimicy and authority over the land of Kurukṣetra thanks to the magic of the Śaiva preceptor̥18

The fourth teacher in the Kuru \(Kauruṣa\) lineage, Rāśīkara, is known from the Ratnaṭīkā \(9th century?\).19 It would seem a plausible hypothesis to rājā śrīsupuṣpavarmā varṣa 56, tena nepālabhūmi dharmeṇa vr̥ dhikr̥ tam  k puna śrī-

It is found in the Paśupatinātha Temple in a shrine called Chatracaṇḍeśvara, in which the pillar next to the image of Chatracaṇḍeśvara is engraved

with an inscription, which records a donation by a \(Pāśupata\) teacher \( ācārya\) called

Bhagavat Pranardanaprāṇa Kauśika \(Verma & Singh 1994, no. 119\). The donation was made to some ascetics of the muṇḍaśr̥ ˙

nkhalikapāśupatācāryaparṣad \(the assembly of

Pāśupata teachers belonging to the Muṇḍa–Śr̥ṅkhalikas\). See Bakker 2014, 149 f. The

ācārya  Bhagavat Pranardana informs us in another inscription on the pedestal of the same image that he is varn

. āśramodvāsita, i.e. living outside the varn

. āśrama  confines

of society \(Verma & Singh 1994, no. 120\). The Licchavi inscriptions further provide information about the Śr̥ṅkhalika-Pāśupatas who care for the sick \(Verma & Singh 1994, no. 132\), and Pāśupata ācāryas \(Verma & Singh 1994, no. 147 l. 8\), for whom see below, ṇ 44 on p. 539.

The report on the excavations of the Harṣa kā ṭīlā at Thanesar informs us that the ‘Pushyabhuti or Vardhana period \(middle of the sixth to end of seventh entury\) was distinguished by a massive brick building and other structural remains’ \(IAR 1987–99, 29; see Plate 117\).

connect the branch of Pāśupata teachers with names ending in ◦ rāśi  to this

Rāśīkara, and it might perhaps be not too far-fetched to imagine that, by the time that the SP was composed, Kanauj/Kanyakubja possessed a Pāśupata

Maṭha of the Rāśi branch, which derived its authority from a paramparā  that was conceived of as going straight back to Lakulīśa through the guru who came from Kurukṣetra.20

Rāśi ascetics and ‘His own doctrine’

Rāśi ascetics are known from inscriptions to have been living in various places. 

The first epigraphical attestation \(c. ad 600\) is that of an ascetic called Udbhavarāśi, said to be a Rudra, in an inscription from the Gandharveśvara Temple in Sirpur \(Śrīpura\) of the time of King Mahāśivagupta Bālārjuna, who

ruled from c. ad 590 to 650.21 This Udbhavarāśi Rudra, called ‘an ocean for the streams of his own doctrine’, might have reached Dakṣiṇa Kosala in the train of Bālārjuna’s mother Vāsaṭā, who was a Maukhari princess, daughter of

Sūryavarman, and who had come from Kanyakubja to Śrīpura as the wife of the Pāṇḍuvaṁśi prince Harṣagupta in the last quarter of the sixth century.22

rāśīkarāntāṁś ca tīrthakarān anukrameṇa yathāvad bhaktyā namaskuryāt tad anu pra-

dakṣiṇam ekam iti |

20 The Skandapurāṇa \(SPBh 162.45\) refers to Śiva as rāśividāṁvaraḥ , ‘Best of the As-

trologers’, or a reference to the Rāśi ascetics? In this connection attention should be

drawn to a passage in the Skandapurāṇa, SP 32.103–110. It tells us that the gods out

of fear for Kālakarn

.ī, a personification of death, dive into a heap \( rāśi\) of ashes \( bha-

sman\), due to which they become Pāśupatas and enjoy the protection of Śiva. Could

this myth reflect the initiation rite in which the novice takes his first bath in a heap of ashes \( bhasmarāśi\) and receives a sectarian name ending in rāśi? \(this was suggested

to me by Peter Bisschop\).

There \(i.e. in Śrīpura\) arose Udbhavarāśi, a Rudra, the one who is an ocean for the

streams of his own doctrine, whose pure splendour/ash was illuminated by the light of his asceticism, and who satisfies the people with the nectar of his speech. 

I take ‘Rudra’ as a title, which, on the one hand, may be connected to the doctrine, attested in the Malhar \(Junvānī\) Plates of Mahāśivagupta, Year 57 \(l. 15; above, p. 290\), 

which acknowledges a lineage of sixty-six Rudras \(embodiments on earth of Gahaneśa, the Rudra who, in Śaiva cosmology, reigns the ‘net of bonds’ \( pāśajāla\)\), on the other

hand, with a development within the Pāśupata fold of a Bhairava tradition, to which

the ‘Rudra’ teachers in particular belong \(see above, p. 292, and below, ṇ 22 on p. 532\). 

22 Bakker 1994b, 14 ff. \(above, p. 252 f.\). 

Another early attestation of a Rāśi ascetic is

found in the Indragarh Stone Inscription of VS 767 \(ad 710/11\) found in the Mandasor District, which records the erection of a Śiva temple, Guheśvara, by a Pāśupata named

Dānarāśi. He is said to be a disciple of the Pāśupata ācārya  Vinītarāśi, the foremost

of the Rudra Śr̥ṅkhalikas \( rudraśr̥ṅkhalikāgraṇīh. \) \(JBRS XLI \(1955\), 260 vv. 5–7\). To mention one more instance of Rāśi ascetics in the kingdom of Kanauj, we may refer

to the stone inscription found in Sirsa \(Haryana\) of the time of the Pratīhāra king of

Kanauj, Bhojadeva \(middle of the ninth century\), which features the name of Ratnarāśi:

27 / Thanesar, the Pāśupata Order and the Skandapurāṇa

533

Although, admittedly, ‘his own doctrine’ \( svasiddhānta\) would normally be

taken to mean ‘the doctrine of/adhered to by Udbhavarāśi’, it may be signif-

icant to note that SPS 167.129–30 refers to the Pañcārtha doctrine imparted

by Lāguḍi to his disciples as ‘His own doctrine’: svasiddhānta \(above, ṇ 3 on p. 527\). Possibly the phrase ‘his own doctrine’ within this lineage was a shib-boleth, a denomination signifying ‘**H**is own doctrine’, thereby claiming that the doctrine was the only true one, revealed directly by Lord Lāguḍi himself. 

The phrase ‘an ocean for the streams of his own doctrine’ makes sense, if the

‘ocean’, i.e. the ascetic, is conceived a receptacle of the streams that make up the Pāśupata/Pañcārtha traditioṇ We will come across another Pāśupata

ascetic who was devoted to ‘his own doctrine’ below, \(p. 539\). 

The Skandapurāna and the Pāśupata movement

Vārāṇasī

It is obvious that the Skandapurāṇa is an important source for reconstructing

the history of the Pāśupata movement, a text composed during the second

half of the 6th and first half of the 7th century. 23 The holy town of Vārāṇasī

plays an important role in this text and its Vārāṇasīmāhātmya shows detailed

knowledge of the local situatioṇ It is the only holy place that is eulogized in much detail and at great length. 24 The Māhātmya describes a kṣetra  that seems

to correlate with the historic situation in the late Gupta and early medieval period. The sanctuary of Avimukteśvara takes centre stage. Around it are said to be twelve liṅgas  of lesser importance \(above, p. 471; Figure 12\), none of which is known from seals. 

The Skandapurāṇa testifies to the establishment of a Pāśupata community of

ascetics and ācāryas  in Vārāṇasī, who may well have been in charge of most of

the sanctuaries described in the texṭ Being united in the kingdom of Kanauj by the time the SP was composed, 25 the Vārāṇasī Pāśupatas entertained probably

manifold relations with their brethren in Kanyakubja. This sectarian affiliation may partly explain why, with the exception of Avimukteśvara, the tīrthas mentioned in the SP do not feature in other sources, before their inclusion in the Tīrthavivecanakāṇḍa of Lakṣmīdhara who, by quoting the Skandapurāṇa, 

23 Above, pp. 185 ff., p. 469. See also Bakker 2014, 137f. 

24 See Introduction to SP II A. 

25 Being so near to their homeland in Baghelkhand, Vārāṇasī may have been part of the

Maukhari territories from the moment that these kings began to assert themselves in the Ga ˙

ngā Valley, that is during the course of the first half of the 6th century. The three inscriptions of the Maukhari kings were found within a circle of 220 km around Vārāṇasī: in Shankarpur, 200 km SW \(Harivarman\), Jaunpur, 52 km NW \(ascribed to

¯

Iśvaravarman, but probably of ¯

Iśānavarman or one of his successors\), Haraha, 220 km

NW \(Sūryavarman/¯

Iśānavarman\).

canonized them, so to speak. 26 The spread of the Pāśupata order itself towards

the east, to Vārāṇasī and Magadhā, may have taken off from Kanyakubja earlier, during the period when North India was united in the Gupta kingdom. 

In view of the learned tradition of the town, duly observed, for instance, by Xuanzang, it has a certain probability per se that the Skandapurāṇa was

composed either in Vārāṇasī, or in a \(Pāśupata\) centre that had close contacts with this city. If the above dating is correct, the text was composed under the rule of either the Maukharis or Harṣavardhana of Kanauj \(see below, pp. 601 ff.\). 

The Māhātmya of Sthāneśvara

The historic relations between the Pāśupatas of Vārāṇasī and those in Kanauj

and Thanesar at the time of its composition also seem to emerge from the Skandapurāṇa itself. It might be significant in this respect that—after a brief inter-mezzo \(SP 31.15–47\) in which Śiva makes Mount Mandara his House \(named Vr̥ṣan\) and the question arises why, after having first made Yaj˜na in the form of a cloud his vehicle, he has exchanged him for Vr̥ṣa, the bull \(which again is a prelude to the myth of the destruction of Dakṣa’s sacrifice told in SP 32\)—

the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya is followed by a section \(SP 31.48–115\) that tells the mythology related to and the Māhātmya of Sthāneśvara. 27

This mythology relates that the Śaiva sage Dadhīca \(son of Cyavana, grandson of Bhr̥gu\), whose āśrama  is on the Sarasvatī River, defeats his Vaiṣṇava rival Kṣupa with Śiva’s help.28 To commemorate this victory the site \( sthāna\) named ‘Sthāneśvara’ is established, one krośa  in circumference, full of flowers

\( puṣpa\) and creeperṣ29 It is evident that the foundation myth of Sthāneśvara, i.e. Thanesar, is told. 

26 TVK pp. 130–135. An exception is Svarlīna, which had passed into the hands of ācāryas

of the Śaivasiddhānta, at least by the 12th century. One of its incumbents left us an inscription \(the National Museum Kathamandhu Stone Inscription of NS 264 \(ad 1144\), edited in Acharya 1997\), in which an ācārya Rudraśiva reports, among other things, 

that he initiated several princes in Nepal. See SP II A, 72 ff., SP 29.28. The modern Svarlīneśvara Mandir is situated at Prahlāda Ghāṭ in the north of Benares \(A 11/29\). 

27 This Māhātmya is intricately positioned between the prelude to the Dakṣa myth \(SP

31.15–47\) and this myth itself \(SP 32\); see SP II B, 27. It provides the cause \( kāraṇa, 

SP 31.49\) of Śiva’s victory over all the gods in the Dakṣa myth. This cause is the boon asked by Dadhīca after his victory over the Vaiṣṇava Kṣupa: bhagavan yadi tuṣṭo ’si yadi deyo varaś ca me | icchāmi viṣṇunā sārdhaṁsarvān devāṁs tvayā jitān  k 31.101 k

28 The fight \( vaira\) between Dadhīca and Kṣupa, who argue about the superiority of either the brahman  or the kṣatra  principle, resembles in many respects that between Vasiṣṭha and Viś

vāmitra, whose āśramas  are also said to be in Sthāṇutīrtha \(MBh 9.41.4\). MBh

3.81.163–64 locates Dadhīca’s āśrama  in Kurukṣetra, where also the Sthāṇuvaṭa is said to be \(MBh 3.81.54\).

Dadhīca’s own āśrama  is here called

‘Sthāṇutīrtha’, where the famous

Sthāṇuvaṭa is said to stand,30 both

already known from the Mahābhā-

rata. 

Sthāṇutīrtha is said to have

been established by Lord Sthāṇu

\(MBh 9.41.6\) and is the place cred-

ited in the Mahābhārata with the

birth of Skanda and his consecration

\( abhiṣeka\) as senāpati.31

In MBh

9.43.51 this place is defined as sit-

uated on the Sarasvatī in Samanta-

pañcaka \(= Kurukṣetra\). 

As has

been noted in the Prolegomena of

SP I \(p. 26\), one of the few direct

borrowings from the Mahābhārata by

the Skandapurāṇa is this description

of Skanda’s consecration in Samanta-

pañcaka. 32

Thanesar: the Sthāṇuvaṭa

Bāṇa’s relationship with Dadhīca, the founder of Sthāneśvara

The Māhātmya in the Skandapurāṇa thus reformulates the significance of

Sthāṇutīrtha and adds to its glory the newly established site Sthāneśvara. In his Harṣacarita Bāṇa ingeniously adapted this mythological complex by linking his own descent to Dadhīca, when he made the latter’s son \(by his divine wife Sarasvatī\), viz. Sārasvata, the foster brother of another scion of the Bhārgava

lineage, namely Vatsa; Vatsa again is the ancestor of the Vātsyāyanas to whom

the author of the Harṣacarita belongs on his own account \(see Figure 13\). When he embroidered on the story of Dadhīca’s mother Sukanyā, told in Mahābhārata

3.121–25, Bāṇa and his audience may have been aware of the mythology that attributed the foundation of Harṣa’s native city Thanesar to Dadhīca as told in the Skandapurāṇa. 33 It may actually have been the very reason why he gave 30 SP 31.109–10:

Bāṇa’s Pedigree

Compare the version in SPRA 167.4.10, 20:

34 The pedigree constructed by Bāṇa not only links the Vātsyāyanas to the collateral

Bhārgava branch of Dadhīca, it seems also to have a geo-political dimension in that it connects two regions: the one along the Sarasvatī and the one along the Śoṇa River̥ The

Puṣyabhūtis belonged to the former area, the Maukharis to the latter̥ Bāṇa’s hero Harṣa

united both regions within his kingdom. Cf. HC\* 4 \(p. 244\), where the wise brahmin Gambhīra says to Harṣa’s brother-in-law Grahavarman, when the latter is about to enter the house of his bride Rājyaśrī:

The Skandapurāṇa reaches Nepal

It has been argued by Yokochi in the Introduction to SP III, taken up in Bakker 2014, 137 f., that a major new redaction of our text, the ancestor of the RA recension, came into being in the ninth century. 35

It is likely that before this major new redaction took place the Skandapurāṇa had reached Nepal, where it became our S recensioṇ This so-called S or ‘Nepalese recension’ has a few particularities of its owṇ 

The end of

chapter 167 in this recension features two remarkable passages in what is in all probability an accretion to the original text \(SPS 167.163–187\), two passages that may betray the background against which this recension S came into being: in one it is said that there are eight places in the country of Magadhā

where Laguḍīśvara \(Lakulīśa\) roamed about together with his pupils \(cf. below, p. 564\), and in the other, at the end of this interpolation, Paśupati in Nepāla

is mentioned together with another sanctuary called Naikatuṅgādhipeśvara, 

which calls forth associations with the king of Nepal, the lord supreme of many mountain peaks/thrones. 36 Could it be that there is a nexus that links both additions to the original text? 

It has been argued by Yokochi that this interpolation in what would eventually develop into our ‘Nepalese recension’ was made ‘in an early text of the S

recension in northeastern India before it bifurcated and came to be transmitted to Nepal’. 37 Since the earliest transmission to Nepal relates to an ancestor of our ms S , this transmission must, according to Yokochi’s theory, have taken 1

place before ad 700.38

We know of a formal exchange between North India and Nepal in the decades before ad 700, namely when the grand-daughter \( dauhitrī\) of the Later–Gupta 35 As noted in Bakker 2014, 138 ṇ 425 this is ‘a slight modification of the date proposed for this redaction in the Introduction to SP II A, p. 54, where we had argued that it may have taken place in the eighth, possibly first half of the ninth century’. The earlier date featured also in the original version of the present article, published in 2007.

Bisschop 2006, 218 observes about this interpola-

tion: ‘Although the list starts with places in the northwest, the number of toponyms in the northeast is striking’, e.g. Gr̥dhrakūṭeśvara and Pāṭalīputra in Magadhā, where

the Prahasiteśvara li ˙

Hans Bakker

king ādityasena of Magadhā \(3rd quarter 7th cenṭ\), Vatsadevī, married the

Licchavi king of Nepal, Śivadeva II, father of Jayadeva. This Jayadeva and his Indian mother recorded this fact in their Paśupati Temple Inscription, 

\[Aṁśuvarman\] Saṁvat 157 \(ad 732\). 39

Vatsadevī was the daughter of a Maukhari prince, called Bhogavarman \(see Figure 14\). 40 The inscription, ipso facto, proves that the family of the Maukharis outlived the reign of Harṣa, in one way or the other̥ If our conjecture above is right and the composition of the SP was begun under the Maukharis of Kanauj, it is conceivable that the princess, or someone in her entourage, took this text to Nepal as part of the Maukhari heirloom. And her Magadhā

background was also not forgotten, as the interpolation shows.

40 This Bhogavarman cannot be the same as the son of Śūrasena and nephew of the Mahā-

sāmanta Aṁśuvarman, who is mentioned in the Deopāṭana Inscription, Saṁvat 39 \(ad

615\); Verma & Singh 1994, 140.

539

The Later Guptas of Magadhā, from whose family the princess stemmed, were

well familiar with the Pāśupata traditioṇ 41

This follows from an inscrip-

tion of the time of another grandchild of ādityasena \(Vatsadevī’s cousin\), the

Later–Gupta king Viṣṇugupta. In this inscription we are told that the pilgrim Avimuktajja \(Skṭ Avimuktārya\), 42 who had visited numerous Śaiva holy places

inhabited by Siddhas \( anekaśivasiddhāyatana◦\), was devoted to ‘his own doc-

trine’ \( svasiddhāntābhirata\). 43 It is therefore possible, even likely, that one or more Pāśupata teachers from Magadhā had traveled to Nepal, some of whom

may have reached it in the company of the Later–Gupta princess. 44

When the Skandapurāṇa text was thus brought to Nepal, it had undergone

the two additions quoted above, \(ṇ 36 on p. 537 f.\) as part of a wider interpolation, in order to make good for what were, in the eyes of its conveyers and receivers, two neglected issues: the authenticity of the Pāśupata tradition

within Magadhā, now said to have been founded by Lakulīśa himself, and the prominence of the holy state sanctuary of Nepal, Paśupatinātha. 

Matrimonial alliances and the spread of culture

Historians are used to judge royal matrimonial alliances by their political implications. If our reconstruction holds any water, the cultural implications may also have been significant and may have had a more lasting effect than the political ones. Next to their husbands, princesses on their way to the residences of their grooms were accompanied by a cortège of ladies-in-waiting and dignitaries of all sorts. Among these there may have been religious virtuosi and literati, who, in the train of the two newlywed queens, Vāsaṭā and Vatsadevī, brought

the Pāśupata order to Dakṣiṇa Kosala and the Skandapurāṇa to Nepal. 

41 A post-Gupta Lakulīśa image was found in Benisagar, southeastern Bihar \(Panigrahi 1956, 3\). Other Lakulīśa images in Bihar are reported in Mitra 1984, 116, ṇ 16. 

42 See von Hinüber 2001, 141. 

43 EI XXVI, 246; Thaplyal 1985, 168. Cf. above, ṇ 3 on p. 527. 

44 Vatsadevī’s Nepalese husband, King Śivadeva, is known from the Laganaṭola Inscription \(ad 694/95\) to have himself patronized the ācāryas  of the Pāśupata order, since he

handed over to the Pāśupata ācāryas  the village of Vaidya as an agrahāra  settlement for

the maintenance of the temple \( devakula\) of Śivadeveśvara Bhaṭṭāraka, which the king had built himself.
