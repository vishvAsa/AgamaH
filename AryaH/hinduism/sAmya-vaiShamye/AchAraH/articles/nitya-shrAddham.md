Many asked me about what is nitya shraadham. Typically after the demise of one's mother or father, some are habituated to doing the 13 day ceremonies followed by the monthly maasikam/ oona maasikam. 

Typically soda-kumbham is done the previous day of the maasikam. This soda-kumbham on the 12th day after sapindi-karanam is done. This soda-kumbha is what needs to be done on all days till the previous day of the prathama aabdika shraadham. Nowdays this has reduced to one day in a month as it is certainly difficult to do everyday for one year.

Having said that I decided to see if its possible to do after my father passed away in July this year. It is actually possible with some extra effort. At least what is definitely possible is giving a uda-kumbha everyday with a small dakshinaa along with rice/pulses. I got a potter in the village and made 300+ mud small sized pot. Shaastra says the daana of this is equivalent to gold ! I do a small procedure everyday along with a small dakshinaa/rice/pulses and this mud vessel. This takes only 15 mins. 

On days when its convenient for the visiting brahmana, we offer food as well. Thus so far 5 months completed. Everyday we have one person visiting our house. If I travel. Either I do and leave or do it after reaching my destination. Support from visiting vaidika is also important and received well so far. Practically still possible. I know son of vaidika shree ghanapatigal performed with bhojanam on all 365 days which is a rare feat.
