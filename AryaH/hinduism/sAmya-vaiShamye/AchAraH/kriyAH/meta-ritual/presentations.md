Title: "Saṁskāras : Hindu self cultivation - it's is not out of fashion."


Abstract: A practicing Hindu is a Hindu who observes Hindu rituals and festivals of his choice, with the belief that they make him a happier and a better person, embedded in a joyful and thriving community. These practices, together with their impact on the psyche of the practitioner and his surroundings, are called saṁskāra-s (refinement). Several people are unable to appreciate saṁskāra-s and cease to be practicing Hindu-s as a result. This has several negative consequences, the most poignant of which include an erosion of the Hindu identity and a crasser society. This talk examines the problems people have with appreciating saṁskāra-s (atheism, anti-ritualist bias, lack of artistic sensitivity, social and peer pressure), and makes the case that Hindu self-cultivation is both natural and desirable, and is not out of fashion.
