## Language

Ritual (mantra-s and hymns therein) can involve specialized language. The use and preservation of sanskrit for ritual purposes was an important ancestral IE trait - seen in Lithuanians, Romans and Indo-Aryans (ref. patanjalI).

Yet, local languages were harmoniously integrated in later ritual systems which involved non IE devotees. Though, some opposers of Agama and veda-s have tried to use this as a dividing point ([Chidambaram08 HK](https://haindavakeralam.com/atheist-assault-shiva-temple-hk14653)).

## Initiation

- A western pagan reconstructionist's view ([KR16](https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/thoughts-on-initiation/)) with divination for compatibility testing etc.. is consonant with many hindu mantra traditions.

### Eligibility limitations

- The [right to exclusivity](../../communal-support/exclusivity/) (based on gender, stage of life, varNa, position etc..) naturally applies.

## Risks
- Rituals sometimes carry risks. This can be especially sharp in case of tAntrika rituals (see ["Lindahl: Trauma among VajrayƒÅnists"](/AgamAH/bauddhaH/articles/somatic-energies_trauma_vajrayAna/) for example).
