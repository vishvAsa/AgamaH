title = "TN Audit fee"

We don't need allocation if your government doesn't allow encroachment of temple lands through your officials. Moreover is the finance minister unaware of 14% admin fee and 4% audit fee imposed by hrce on temples of the state? Where do you think the revenue for HRCE comes from?

As per the announcements made by @PKSekarbabu yesterday, Thiruvannamalai temple will pay electricity charges for street lights & repairing costs for roads around the temple. So will the govt allot road tax paid by residents in these places to the temple?

Infact @ptrmadurai should clarify the reason behind the use of Thiruvannamalai temple funds for renovating municipality roads and street lights if his government is not taking even a single penny from temple funds as claimed by him.
