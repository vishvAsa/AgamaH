## केशान्तः
> The Āpastamba-gr̥hya-sūtrá and most other Gr̥hya-sūtrá-s have tonsure as part of the upa-náyana (4.10.6) and as a cāúla at the age of three years (6.16.3), but not separately.  However, Pāraskara-gr̥hya-sūtrá 2.1.7 (with 2.2.18 specifying the beard) and Jāiminīya-gr̥hya-sūtrá 1.18 mention the keş'-āntá separately from even the sam-ā-vártana (JGS 1.19) -
