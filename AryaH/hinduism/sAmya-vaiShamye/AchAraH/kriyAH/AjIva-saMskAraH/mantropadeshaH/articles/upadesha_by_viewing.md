I asked my Guru (mukkUru Lakshminarasimhachariar) about having learnt many mantras just from attending yajnas and hearing them. He told me that if you have heard the mantra in a natural setting (say being recited in a yajna or being recited by vedavits) and learnt it from there, then it is equivalent to learning it from a Guru directly by upadesha.

He also said that if one learns non-traditionally etc. then they will never shine in a sabhA. ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡§ó‡•Å‡§°‡•Å‡§ó‡•Å‡§°‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§¨‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§® ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á‡•§ So this is the necessary side-effect üôÇ
