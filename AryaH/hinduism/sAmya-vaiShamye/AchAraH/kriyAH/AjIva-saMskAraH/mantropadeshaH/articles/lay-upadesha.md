Most of these mantravids were women or non Brom males. The general rule for teaching is that they should get upadesha during grahana and then do japa so that they attain siddhi during the next grahana. 

And they have some restrictions regarding lifestyle. Just as a bhootakola artist has several shaucha rules - closely corresponding to a Tulu brahmana, these people also have certain very specific rules based on who their teacher and what said teacher's practice is.
