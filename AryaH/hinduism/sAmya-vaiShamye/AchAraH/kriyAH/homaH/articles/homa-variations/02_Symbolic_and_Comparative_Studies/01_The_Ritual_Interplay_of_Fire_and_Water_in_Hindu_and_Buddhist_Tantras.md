SHORTLY BEFORE HIS untimely death in 1994, Sinologist Michel Strickmann turned his attention to the study of *homa* fire sacrifices, specifically in the East Asian context. Strickmann questioned why, given the surplus of material and opportunities for direct observation, Western scholars have neglected a comparative study of *homa* for so long. He makes the case that the basic structural homogeneity of *homa* transcends sectarian, geographical, and cultural boundaries, and thus it clearly calls for a comparative study in its own right.1 I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment and would further argue that due to their widespread and persistent nature, *homa* rites provide a valuable organizing principle for a wide variety of comparative studies. The present comparison, therefore, is not intended to be all-inclusive, as there exists an indefinite number of possibilities for works that investigate shared ritual practices from within both general and specialized categories.2 It is intended, rather, to illuminate the pervasiveness of ritual structures over time and space and then to investigate the ways in which Hindu and Buddhist tantric rituals internalize these structures. Here, emphasis will be placed on the ritual interplay of fire and water.

*Homa* sacrifices represent perhaps the most ancient and widespread of Asian ritual practices. In various forms, *homa* rituals continue to be performed in diverse countries including India, Tibet, Iran, Mongolia, Bali, and Japan by practitioners belonging to Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, Zoroastrian, Shintō, and other religious groups. For millennia, the structure and basic rules of *homa* sacrifices, particularly the rules governing the interplay of fire and water, have remained remarkably constant in these various contexts. This study uses *homa* rites as a starting point for investigating how shared ritual technologies, particularly the ritual use of fire and water, have been appropriated within a tantric ritual universe.3 Instead of limiting the discussion to a particular tantric school, this project will attempt to speak of an overarching tantric ritual universe—that is, shared structures and meanings found in both Hindu and Buddhist tantric sources. I argue that in a tantric ritual universe, individual rites, ceremonies, and ritual rules are often practiced for the explicit purpose of transforming the self. The interplay of fire and water represents a primary means of both visualizing and effecting this transformation. Thus, though the ritual structure and rules of tantric fire sacrifice are quite ancient \(being found in the most ancient Vedic and Avestan accounts\), the purpose and goal of practice is entirely tantric.



## FIRE AND WATER

The ritual use of fire and water typically follows certain rules—rules that characterize not only *homa* and other paradigmatic tantric rites \(such as initiations and internalized rites\) but also multiple rituals found across Asian traditions. For example, most Asian fire rites have a symmetrical frame structure, with water sequences framing the central fire offering. This basic structure characterizes early Vedic and Avestan sacrifices as well as medieval and contemporary fire rituals across Asia.

Fire and water represent contrasting functions in the ritual arena. Water is plural, feminine, and multilocal. Fire, in contrast, is singular, masculine, and tends to be limited to one location—the center of the rite.4 Ritual rules that govern the interplay of fire and water include the following: water both precedes and follows fire; water flows downward while fire flames upward; water exists on a horizontal plane and functions as the container, while fire exists on a vertical plane and is contained. Building on William Darrow’s analysis of the Zoroastrian *yasna* sacrifice, I argue that this ritual interplay helps illuminate the unity and meaning of ritual within a tantric ritual universe.5

First, a few examples should be given to demonstrate the structural homogeneity that broadly characterizes Asian rituals. In the Vedic context, most fire rites, both simple and elaborate, follow a similar pattern. Stephanie W. Jamison and Michael Witzel point out that both burnt offerings \(*haviryajña*\) and *soma* sacrifices \(*somayajña*\) are located at the exact center of a “bilaterally symmetrical structure” that allows the rites to be expanded by inserting new sequences into the structure.6 Frits Staal notes that this bilateral structure is also found in the elaborate Vedic *agniṣṭoma* and summarizes as follows:

In the Agniṣṭoma the final bath \(avabhṛtha\) at the end corresponds to the consecration at the beginning, and the concluding offering \(udayanīyeṣṭi\) similarly corresponds to the introductory offering, the departure \(udavasāna\) to the entrance \(adhyavasāna\), the dissolution \(sakhyavisarjana\) to the alliance \(tānūnaptra\), and so forth. In all these cases, a large number of rites and rituals intervene between these initial and final rites. However, if we look at smaller units, we often find the same structure, and the intervening portion is correspondingly clarified.7

The pattern allows for the ritual to “be extended indefinitely” with “indefinitely increasing complexity.”8

Vedic domestic rites, such as the daily *agnihotra*, follow a similar symmetrical pattern: the rite both begins and ends with water sequences. In his comparison of Vedic and tantric *agnihotra* rituals, Witzel points to this common frame structure.9 He argues that while the basic structures of the *agnihotra* are shared, tantric traditions add several ritual frames. Tantric ritual structure, thus, cannot be a mere survival of old Vedic forms, but rather represents a special development: “an amalgamation which involved various strands of traditions both ancient and medieval, and both local and supraregional.”10 While tantric rites contain more ritual sequences, the basic structure remains the same.

Avestan fire rites also reveal a symmetrical structure, with water sequences framing the central fire offering. In the daily *yasna* liturgy \(a rite that likely predates the Avesta itself, ca. 1500 B.C.E.\), ritual purifications with water are required as a preliminary to the rite. The liturgy has a symmetrical structure or, in the words of Almut Hintze, a “concentric compositional structure.”11 At the exact center of the *yasna* liturgy, the heavenly fire is invited to merge with the ritual fire, addressed as Ahura Mazda’s most beautiful shape.12 And “ from *that* moment of the ritual onwards, the worshippers believe themselves to be in the presence of Ahura Mazda, who has become visible to them in the form of the ritual fire before which they stand.”13

Darrow points out that while fire stands at the center of the liturgy, ritual water surrounds fire and frames the central offering. The officiating priest is first required to perform a number of preliminary purifications with water in order to remove physical and spiritual impurities. These preliminary water purifications, similar to both Vedic and tantric rites, are accompanied by mantra recitation.14 The final act of the rite consists of pouring the *hōm* libation15 into the community well, thus infusing the water to be consumed by faithful Zoroastrians. During the pouring of the *hōm* libation, the priests offer three recitations to Ardvīsūr, the spirit being who presides over water. Through this act it is hoped that “sins will be atoned for, and that meritorious deeds will increase.”16

Tantric *homa* rites share a similar structural frame. First, in external *homa* sacrifices, fire offerings tend to be located at the center of a bilaterally symmetrical structure. In both Buddhist and Hindu tantras, the central offering also tends to be framed by ritual sequences utilizing water. Consecration/initiation rituals \(*dīkṣā* or *abhiṣeka*\) and internal purification rites \(such as *ātmaśuddhi* and *bhūtaśuddhi*\) follow the same basic pattern of external fire sacrifices. As Yael Bentor points out, the external structure and form supplies “a continuing frame of reference for the internal ritual.”17 Thus, external rites such as *homa* sacrifices provide the structural frame for the symbolic use of fire and water in internalized rites.

Although the basic ritual rules that govern the interplay of fire and water remain relatively constant, tantric rites utilize specific and unique substances, mantras, and interpretations. For example, tantric meanings—particularly those regarding the balance of male and female forces—are applied to the interplay between fire and water. Within the tantric ritual universe, Witzel identifies the male element, fire, as the active one—it flames upward and is represented by a triangle. Water, the female element represented by a downward triangle, in contrast, is passive and fluid. Although fire is not united with water in either Vedic or tantric *agnihotra*s, water is sprinkled around the ritual fire; it surrounds Agni everywhere. Agni \(the male element\) is envisioned as “burning in the womb of the female Goddess Earth, represented by pit dug or fire altars. What is poured into \[the\] fire altar is ghee, symbol of semen; from \[the\] yoni shaped offering ladle.”18 Witzel argues that this productive union of Agni and *śakti*, symbolized by pouring ghee into the firepit, constitutes perhaps “the deepest meaning” for the tantric *agnihotra*.19 This is the sexualization of ritual, identified by Sylvain Lévi as the source of real and symbolic tantric sex.20

Other specifically tantric meanings, found in both Hindu and Buddhist tantras, are applied to the interplay of fire and water. For example, the move toward symbolic internalization of ritual fire and water reflects an emphasis on the rite’s power to effect a transformation of self. External forms of *homa* continue to be widely practiced, but even external fire and water are often understood to function internally. Fire, the central focus in many tantric rituals, primarily tends to have a destructive function: destroying false views and karmic propensities, including the past sins of either the practitioner or the initiate. Thus, the destructive force of heat tends to be directed toward the self rather than projected outward toward enemies, as in Vedic conceptions.21

Water also predominates in tantric rituals, and in fact may be more prevalent. For example, water is typically required in consecration and initiation rites \(*dīkṣā* or *abhiṣeka*\), whereas fire is only used sometimes.22 Here, as in earlier conceptions, water serves to purify and empower the ritual elements, including the participants. In the tantric ritual universe, water symbolism also comes to be employed to describe the function of seed mantras. These seed mantras, imposed on the ritual *maṇḍala* and on the *sādhaka*’s body, exemplify the deities themselves, and thus aid in transforming the mind and body of the *sādhaka*. The process is often explained in both Buddhist and Hindu tantras as the downward flow of nectar \(*amṛta*\), or as a “flood” or “stream” pouring down onto the head of the initiate.

In the move toward internalization in tantric systems, we find both continuity and change with earlier Avestan and Vedic ritual structures. Just as in these earlier contexts, tantric rituals employ the primary elements fire and water to facilitate the opening of a mesocosmic channel, linking the macrocosmic and microcosmic realm. However, several scholars have noted that the emphasis on self-purification and self-deification distinguish the tantric path from previous Vedic conceptions.23 The emphasis placed on self-purification subsequently alters the ways in which fire and water are understood to function in tantric ritual practice. In both Buddhist and Hindu tantric contexts, the ritual use of fire and water is understood to effect, or produce, personal transformation via the destruction of impure elements and the \(re\)construction of a new “self”—a pure, illuminated “self.”



## FIRE AND WATER IN BUDDHIST TANTRAS

As with most Asian rites, the central fire offering in Buddhist *homa* sacrifices represents the culmination of the rite, with water sequences framing this event. Unlike earlier Vedic forms, the climactic point of Buddhist fire rites, such as *homa,* consists of the practitioner identifying directly, and merging with, the divinity installed in the ritual fire. Giovanni Verardi derives a description of this moment in the Buddhist context from the *Mahāvairocana-sūtra* \(ca. fifth century\). He writes:

The Bodhisattvas of the stele are actually evoked and induced to perform the actions that are proper to their descending function. The ritual is centered upon the visualization by the officiant of the Bodhisattva to whom it is addressed and to whom the officiant proceeds to identify or otherwise unite. These stele are capable of expressing the unity of the interior mind made of fire, evoked divinity and officiant, of which we are told by texts such as the *Mahāvairocana Sūtra.*24

This merging is also explained in Richard Payne’s translation of a ritual manual for the performance of *homa* to Mañjuśri, where the officiant invites Mañjuśrī to leave his original location in the cosmic *maṇḍala* and be present in the ritual arena. He writes that, at this point, “the fire is identical with the dharmakāya fire of wisdom … the fire is nothing other than the wisdom within the practitioner’s body.”25 Therefore, the practitioner not only invites the bodhisattva in the form of fire but also self-identifies with the fire, the essence of which is wisdom.

In the Buddhist context, ritual fire primarily tends to serve a destructive function, both on external and internal levels. Just as the external fire burns and destroys physical substances, the internal fire burns away past sins, incorrect ways of thinking, and ontological constructs that obstruct clarity. Fire, conceived of as wisdom itself, not only has a destructive function but also an empowering one. Internalized fire is understood to be the wisdom that both destroys personal impurities/obstacles and illuminates the heart/mind of the adept. In a talk sponsored by the Harvard Buddhist Studies Forum, Bishop Ekan Ikeguchi \(a Shingon master\) spoke about the *goma* \(*homa*\) fire ritual. He explained that during the *goma* practitioners imagine that they are burning the “wisdom of fire within their hearts in order to eliminate the confusion…. I try to invite the Buddha and make myself a Buddha by lighting the fire in my dark inside and separating the wisdom from the confusion completely.”26

Confused states of consciousness are thus destroyed by the same \(symbolic\) fire that illuminates wisdom.

The luminous quality of ritual fire accounts for the transformative function of Buddhist rites. Ritual primarily functions to mediate luminous powers between the enlightened beings \(such as buddhas and bodhisattvas\) and the ritual practitioner. For example, Glenn Wallis characterizes “the conceptual world operating” in the *Mañjuśrīmulakalpa* as being founded on the belief that “enlightened beings are actively engaged in the world on behalf of devotees.”27 Ritual fire represents the means by which the power of these radiant beings is made manifest.

Light imagery is commonly employed to describe *tathāgata*s, bodhisattvas, and other enlightened beings in Buddhist tantras. For example, the luminous quality of Śākyamuni is described in the opening scene of the *Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa*, chapter 8. When he smiles, he emits “brilliant, colorful, and cosmically cataclysmic rays of light from his mouth.”28 In the Vajrabhairava tantras, Mañjuśrī is similarly described as a solar disc, arisen from the syllable DHIḤ, from which “lights emanate and invite the tathāgatas, bodhisattvas, wisdom-goddesses and wrathful ones who reside in the ten directions…. The light which blazes from this illuminates fully for a hundred thousand leagues around.”29

Iconographical portrayals of this luminous atmosphere include enlightened beings surrounded with a glowing aureole, a halo, and/or with flames rising from their shoulders.30

According to the *Mahāvairocana-tantra*, wisdom is transmitted from these radiant beings via rays of light: “Then those rays of light gathered together from the sky and flowed down onto the crown of Vajrapāṇi’s head.”31 The rays of light represent the connecting link between the shining beings and the *sādhaka*. In the Kālacakra initiation, deities of the *maṇḍala* are dissolved into the *sādhaka*’s action faculties, a transaction conceived of as follows: “Light rays from them draw in the male and female Wrathful Deities of the mandala in the manner of a second butter lamp separating off from the first.”32 Within the ritual arena, then, a symbolic identification with the fire connects one to the luminous realm of enlightened beings.

Water sequences often frame the central identification with fire in both internal and external rites. Ritual water is poured or sprinkled both before and after the officiant directly visualizes and identifies with the ritual fire/attendant divinity. The many categories of external *homa,* as described in various Buddhist tantras, begin with sprinkling the hearth with water and culminate with the *mantrin*, who has visualized Agni shining forth in a specific form, sprinkling more water. For example, in the pacifying \(*śānti*\) *homa*, the body image of Agni, dressed in white robes, has the “color of conch, jasmine or moon” and “emits white tongues of fire and is Awareness in nature.” After thus visualizing Agni, the *mantrin* should “sprinkle \[around\] Agni in a circular manner, with water consecrated with the Mantra of the Noble Acala.”33 In the enriching \(*puṣti*\) *homa*, Agni is to be visualized as arising from the shining light, gold in color, with yellow robes, and emitting “blazing tongues of fire.” The *mantrin* should then “cleanse him with sprinkled water, wash his face and offer him the oblation.”34 And in the subduing \(*vaṣya*\) *homa*, after imagining the “*RA* letter which radiates out a blazing garland of fire changing into the body-image of Agni, dressed in red robes, radiating red light from blazing tongues,” the *mantrin* purifies him “with sprinkled water.”35

The external *homa*s, like the internal rites, are understood to destroy sins and other obstacles. The *Kriyāsaṃgraha* prescribes that for the enriching *homa,* after summoning the knowledge-fire \(*jñānāgni*\) and sprinkling water, one “recites the *mantra* for Vajrayaṣa for turning into ashes of all sins \(*papa*\), evil spirits \(*vighna*\), and *māra*s, one throws five mustard seeds \(*sarṣapa*\).” Then, at the conclusion of the rite, the practitioner “sprinkles water \(*prokṣaṇa*\) on Agni’s body, offers him the water for the face \(*argha*\) on the head, the water for the feet \(*pādya*\) on the feet, and the water for sipping \(*ācamana*\) in the mouth, while reciting the relevant *mantra*s.”36

Therefore, the function of external fire to destroy personal obstacles is explicit in Buddhist sources. It is also clear that water sequences both precede and follow the burning rites.

This process is further mirrored in external *homa* ceremonies performed at the time of cremation. Within the ceremony, fire offerings are again followed by consecration with water. The ritual performer invites Agni to merge with the ritual fire \(“Oh fire-god radiant with the flames of splendour, I invite you to take residence inside these flames”\) and to summon other enlightened beings \(“Dispersing once again the rays of light from their hearts, I summon the five Buddha families and execute the consecration”\).37 This is followed by offering water that “fills their bodies and overflows on the top.”38 The overall structure, of course, follows the same pattern. The corpse, first ritually cleansed with water, is incinerated in the crematory fire. The rite concludes by depositing the ashes into water. If the ashes come from a “pure person,” they are to be thrown into large bodies of water, and when “living beings drink this water, their obscurities become purified.”39

Internal forms of Buddhist *homa* reveal a similar purpose and function. However, instead of burning physical offerings \(or an actual corpse\), the internal *homa* is understood to burn away karma and personal obstructions. The *Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi* describes this as follows:

There are two kinds of *homa*, namely, internal and external: One obtains liberation from karma and \[re\]birth, and there is also the arising of sprouts and seeds \[of awakening\]. Because it is able to burn away karma, it is called “internal *homa.*”40

And in the *Jyotirmañjarī of Abhayākaragupta*, internal \(or mental\) *homa* is considered the supreme \(*anuttara*\) *homa* “because the highest mind is the source of mental formations, because it constitutes the absolute essence in the outer *homa,* and because the mind has the essential character of stainless clear light.”41

Buddhist initiation or self-purification rituals appropriate the structure of *homa* rites and, like internal *homa*, are aimed at the destruction of karma and the subsequent transformation of self. The symbolic and literal pairing of fire and water is understood to function internally as it does externally. In other words, fire serves to destroy defilements and illuminate wisdom within the initiate, while water aids in the process of reconstructing a new, more enlightened being. Discussing the *Kālacakra-tantra*, Jeffrey Hopkins offers a good overview of the importance of tantric initiation rites \(*abhiṣeka*\) in the Buddhist context:

Initiation means to cleanse and purify defilements; to authorize students to hear about and cultivate the tantric paths and to achieve special feats; to empower the attainment of beneficial qualities; to set potencies for attaining levels of the path and the fruits of those paths; to sprinkle water; to pour potencies and cast seeds into the mental continuum of the initiate; to convey a new style of behavior and its attendant releases from distorted states; and to cause initiates to be endowed with a blissful mind.42

The central meaning attributed to initiation consists of transforming the mind from a distorted state to an enlightened one \(*bodhicitta*\).

Transformation \(on both micro- and macrocosmic levels\), described by Hopkins as purification, is effected via the use of fire and water in both internal and external rituals. Within the consecration \(*abhiṣeka*\) ceremony, the outer and inner ritual frames incorporate similar rules pertaining to fire and water, with water sequences framing the central fire offering. Again, ritual fire and water serve as mediums to purify the initiate of defilements and sins. Just as an external fire burns the offerings, the internal fire is visualized as burning afflictions \(*kleśa*s\). Water is then sprinkled over the consecrated one in order to cleanse and empower his inner potencies.43

Initiation ceremonies similarly have both outer and inner ritual frames, with water sequences framing the central fire offering in both. For example, Kālacakra systems list water initiation as the first of fifteen initiations and speech \(often identified with water\) as the last. Within each of the fifteen initiations, the sprinkling of water follows the mental absorption with wisdom, described in terms of light or fire. Light is the medium through which the practitioner unites with wisdom: “Light is emitted from the hūṃ at their hearts, which draws in Wisdom Beings.”44 Then offerings of perfume, flowers, incense, and so on are followed by a water initiation, where the initiate’s body parts are sprinkled with water. Specifically, the following is prescribed:

“With the water touch the five places—crown protrusion, right and left shoulders, upper arms, thighs, and hips—and having sprinkled a little, \[have the student\] drink a little and also wash, conferring initiation.”45

A comparable description of Buddhist initiation, from the *Sarvadurgati- pariśodhana-tantra*, also begins with an external *homa* sacrifice and ends with a water initiation:

Then the wise one himself performs with resolution the protective rite for his pupils … he offers the *homa* sacrifice using firewood which has been smeared with clarified butter, sesame seeds and clarified butter mixed together, clarified butter and burnt offerings, and rice prepared with curds. In the first place this is done in order to nullify evil influences, and furthermore because of his concern \[for them\]. Next he should perform the pacifying *homa* rite or the one for nullifying sins…. Next, he should sprinkle their heads with water blessed with the recitations of the Wrathful ones … touching them on the heads he should recite the *mantra* applicable to all the rites.46

Regarding the recitation of mantras belonging to the wrathful deities, Wallis argues that by mastering these wrathful beings \(through recitation of their seed mantras\), the *sādhaka* is able to transform their fierce energy into powers that serve his own aims. These mantras then serve to “destroy, purify, and convert energy of various forms of embodiment, including mental, supernatural, and physical.”47 A specific example can be found in certain *abhicāra* rites described in the Vajrabhairava tantras, where one identifies himself with the wrathful, terrible deities, such as Vajrabhairava, “blazing like the fire of the age of destruction.” The practitioner visualizes himself as being the great Vajrabhairava, thus “able to devour the three worlds.”48 Wrathful beings are not appeased or combated but are instead appropriated for the *sādhaka*’s own goals. In these meditations, water follows fire and most often is understood to have a pacifying function.49

Again, just as water sequences frame external fire offerings, water imagery typically both precedes and follows the burning of defilements/illumination of wisdom in internal rites. For example, in a relatively modern manual for self-initiation of Vajrabhairava, the center of the initiation consists of the practitioner merging with the light of Mañjuśrī:

Then think that all the faults of sentient beings, and particularly all faults of ignorance, are eliminated like the sun shining into a dark corner. Think that you achieve a special light of wisdom like that of \[Mañjuśrī\]. Light is emanated outward, purifying the vessel and essence and placing sentient beings in a state of \[Mañjuśrī\]…. Then visualize a brilliant orange DHIḤ on the base of the tongue with its head facing your throat. In one breath, recite DHIḤ one hundred times. Much light is emanated from this letter DHIḤ, filling your own body entirely, and think that you have achieved a special power of memory not to forget the words and meanings of the teachings.50

When reciting the mantras, one imagines an infinite light coming from the seed syllable and “filling the entire inside of your body \[thus\] eliminating the downfalls and obstacles accumulated from beginningless lives, as well as pacifying all sickness and evil spirits.”51 Thus, the center of the internal process resembles external sacrifice in that the practitioner identifies him- or herself \(merges his or her consciousness\) with the light \(fire\) of wisdom.

Following this fusion, water imagery is employed to describe the process of transformation. Specifically, with obstacles eliminated by the fire of wisdom, one is transformed and regenerated via the influx of mantras, conceived of as a stream of nectar \(*amṛta*\). It is prescribed that one should “think that a stream of nectar flows from the letter HUṂ surrounded by the hundred syllables at the heart of the respective lord of the family, and think that all downfalls are purified.”52

In tantric meditations, this process of transforming the self again occurs via identification with a deity followed by water imagery. First, the meditator “purifies himself of all past sins,” and, after becoming “inseparably united with Buddhahood,” he visualizes that he is initiated into a new divine state by “goddesses holding flasks filled with the nectar of the five knowledges, which fills his entire body … and these *mantras* make his body, his speech, and his mind into an unshakeable diamond.”53 Thus, the infusion of knowledge follows the destruction of distorted mental dispositions and constructs.

In summary, the Buddhist tantras prescribe similar rules that govern the use of fire and water in both internal and external rites, and in both smaller ritual frames as well as in the overarching ceremonial structure. These rules, though very common across Asia, have come to be interpreted with language and imagery specific to the Buddhist tantric ritual universe. Ritual has transformative power—a power that functions by associating oneself, ritually, with the luminous wisdom embodied by the various buddhas and bodhisattvas. Fire destroys impurities and incorrect mental formulations, thus illuminating wisdom in one’s mind/heart. The element water fertilizes potencies and leads to the generation of enlightened mind \(*bodhicitta*\).



## FIRE AND WATER IN HINDU TANTRAS

The category *tantra* includes “a complex array of ritual, theoretical, and narrative strategies that are specific to their various religious, cultural, sociopolitical, geographical, and historical contexts.”54 However, some common denominators, what David White refers to as the “there” of tantra, still exist. For example, we find some common conceptions of ritual across Hindu and Buddhist tantras. In Hindu tantras, as in Buddhist tantras, the internal rituals mirror the structure of the external *homa* rites, and all are governed by similar rules. Both tantric systems prescribe numerous initiation and purification rituals intended to transform the self. Ritual fire and water again function as the primary agents of transformation.

Although both Hindu and Buddhist tantric sacrifices share a symmetrical structure similar to that of Vedic rites, tantric forms of sacrifice particularly emphasize the identification of the practitioner with the fire. Witzel points out that in the Hindu context, while both Vedic and tantric forms of *agnihotra* serve as a “mesocosm to connect the microcosmic aspect of man with the macrocosmic one of the deities,”55 the latter version of the rite is unique in that the central act “consists of a secret, mental identification of the priest with the fire in front of him, and with Viṣṇu who is the Fire and the Sun.”56 In this context, the rays of the sun, identified with the ritual fire, come to be “understood as conduits, rather than harnesses” for connecting the luminous person with the macrocosm and, by extension, with “all that exists—including one another.”57

The ritual pattern, including the identification with the deity, is basically the same in the various forms of external *homa* sacrifices prescribed in Hindu tantras. First, the rite begins with an invitation. According to Cal G. Diehl’s account, the practitioner first draws lines for the *sthanḍila*, or sacrificial ground, with a bundle of *darbha* \(*kuśa*\) grass \(a tall grass used for purification in several ceremonies\), while reciting mantras. Then, Brahmā, Viṣnu, and various other celestial beings are invoked.58 The fire altar is prepared by sprinkling ceremonial \(*arghya*\)59 water. In the process, each direction is acknowledged and worshiped while the deities are invoked.60 The tantric priest then identifies bodily with the deity \(present in the form of the ritual fire\). Jan Gonda describes this moment as follows:

Fire is procured in accordance with the prescripts, worshipped with the *mulamantra* and “united” with the fire of the *mulādhāra*, i.e., the lowermost power centre \(*cakra*\) and with that of the *bindu* on the forehead. Thus the worshipper enacts his unification with the fire in which now Agni’s spirit \(*caitanya*\) is introduced…. After that the worshipper must unite the arteries of his \(yogic\) body \(*nāḍi*\) with those of Siva-of-the-temple and of Siva-of-the-fire, creating a sort of luminous circuit between these and proceed to perform the fire sacrifice \(*homa*\), consisting of oblations of ghee, and accompanied by offerings of fried rice grain, sugar-cane, flowers, etc.61

After merging with the deity, there is a “luminous circuit” opened between Śiva-of-the-fire and the internal body of the performer. As in the Buddhist *homa*sacrifices, the ritual fire is associated with the central divinity and exemplifies wisdom. Diehl describes this association as follows: “\[The fire\] is now considered to be “Siva-fire” and after some fire has been thrown to the south west as the portion of Rākşasas, it is invoked to be present and considered to be the form of intelligence \(caitanyarupamāka\).”62 The pouring of liquid ghee follows this symbolic unification with fire.

Internalized rites follow the same basic structure of external *homa*, and again the primary focus is on transforming the self. Richard Davis details the internal processes involved in initiation and purification rituals practiced by Śaiva Siddhāntas \(a branch of Hindu tantrism once practiced across India but now primarily concentrated in the south\). Davis situates individual rites within a larger ritual universe, arguing for structural consistency among the various rituals. For example, he claims that the *ātmaśuddhi* \(lit., “purification of self”\) rite can also be seen as a shorter or abbreviated ritual sequence that accomplishes the same goal \(via similar means\) as the more elaborate initiation ceremonies. We find analogous rules governing the interplay between fire and water in both the purification rituals and initiation ceremonies.

First, in the initiation \(*dīkṣā*\) rites, though an external fire is often still used it is understood to function on an internal level. Initiation in general “annihilates fetters like a blazing fire” and ritual fire specifically destroys the binding fetters63 like a “sacrificial fire burns offerings.”64 For example, in the “sprinkling” initiation \(the *niṣeṣadīkṣā*\), the guru ritually removes the fetters of the initiate from his body and transfers it into the womb of Vagīśvarī \(the goddess of speech\), installed in the sacrificial fire, where they are incinerated. Similarly, in the “cessation” initiation \(*nirvānadīkṣā*\) the removal of fetters is accomplished via transference. Fetters and impurities, which constitute the initiate’s body, are transferred onto a cord \(*paśasūtra*\) that is fastened from the initiate’s topknot to his toe. After the process of transference, the cord is incinerated in the sacrificial fire. The external fire in these initiation rites thus explicitly functions to destroy internal impurities and bonds.

Davis also describes how the internalized \(imagined\) fire functions in the same manner. In the self-purification ritual \(*ātmaśuddhi*\), the practitioner is to imagine an internalized fire that burns bodily and mental impurities: “With the fire arising from his right big toe, and with the ASTRA mantra, he burns the impurities of the elements located in the body, which is the product of *karman*.” The result of imagined fire, going upward from the toes, is that “all impurities that normally distinguish the worshipper’s body from that of Śiva have now been ritually extirpated.”65

Mantras replace the impure constituents after they are incinerated. Śaiva Siddhānta authors enjoin that following the removal of bodily constituents, a divine body modeled on the Śaiva cosmology is constructed out of mantras. As in the Buddhist rites, water imagery is employed to describe the process:

Imagining it completely emptied of all that has the form of a fetter, the worshiper should bathe his entire body, inside and out, with streams of nectar flowing from the upside-down lotus at the top of his crown, penetrating the openings of every capillary, using MŪLĀ ending in VAUṢAT.66

Thus, even when internalized, ritual fire moves upward while liquid flows downward—fire destroys, water revivifies.

The *Vīṇāśikha-tantra* offers another description of *ātmaśuddhi* in the Śaiva tantric context. Here, the self-purification rite is described as burning up the “sinful body,” which is then “revived by \[the\] water of life.” Specifically, one should meditate “upon the bīja of the Fire of Destruction, which resembles the Apocalyptical Fire,” and

he should then burn his own body \[in meditation\] and cause it to overflow with Water-of-Life \[*variṇāplāvayet*\]. Having burnt his mortal body so that it as it were is left as a heap of ashes, he should then meditate on a “body of wisdom” \[*vidyādehaṃ*\] which is \[constituted\] by showers of Water-of-Life \[*amṛtadhārabhir*\]; and on the Supreme Syllable *Oṃ,* directed downwards, \[with Amṛta\] streaming on one’s head.67

As in external rites, internalized fire functions to purify via destruction while water functions to regenerate life.

Gavin Flood discusses the self-purification \(here called *bhūtaśuddhi*\) rite in the *Pancarātra* \(*Vaiṣṇava*-*tantra*\) context as a parallel process. *Bhūtaśuddhi*,68 performed both as an independent daily rite \(*nityakarman*\) and as a preliminary to other ritual ceremonies, closely resembles self-purification in the Śaiva tantra systems. According to the *Jayākhya Saṃhitā* \(JS\),69 ritual sequences of *bhūtaśuddhi* consist of mentally visualizing the burning up of the six outer coverings \(*saḍkośika*s\)70 and replacing these with a “mantra body” or “body of light,” which correlates with the subtle body, referred to as the “City of Eight.”71 The process is again understood to function via the internalization of ritual fire and water.

The practitioner visualizes fire, starting at the big toe, arising up through the body and burning the various constituents that keep the practitioner in a state of bondage. The fire burns the *saḍkośika*s like “grass in a sacrificial fire.”

“Starting with the seed syllable \[the *praṇava*\] and ending with the name expressing the fire of desire itself, \[the practitioner\] should visualize the body, blazing from the feet. After that, O Twice-Born, the fire is calmed and \[the body\] resembles a pile of ashes.”72

After this internal fire consumes the *saḍkośika*, mantras are imposed \(*nyāsa*\) upon the body of the practitioner to reconstruct a divine body that is in harmony with the *Pancarātra* hierarchical system. The imposition of mantras upon the body are described in terms of flowing water and nectar—or as a mass of streams flowing forth:

Meditating upon his reduction to ashes, \[he should use the mantra\] *tyaṃ* preceded by the syllable *Oṃ* and ending with *namaḥ*. Then he floods the ashes to the directions with the water, sprinkled with his own mantra, arising from his meditation and having the appearance of milk73 … the nectar of the twice-born, continuously meditated upon, is made to fall as a mass of streams from its elevated position, flowing out from the fourth state.74

After the flood of mantras reconstruct the worshiper, he has a luminous quality, similar to that of the deity at the center of his ritual universe. The practitioner “should visualize \[himself as\] Lord Nārāyaṇa … shining with vibrant rays.”75 Again, the interplay of fire and water is central to the meaning of the rite.

Therefore, though tradition-specific terminology is employed in various tantric systems, we find that there are certain common denominators regarding fire sacrifice. Both Buddhist and Hindu tantric schools continue to practice external *homa* fire sacrifices, demonstrating consistency with ancient ritual structures, but they internalize the meanings of these rites, primarily emphasizing their transformative power. In both Hindu and Buddhist tantras, external and internal rites function to destroy or burn up the obstacles keeping one in a bound or deluded state. Then both systems describe the downward flowing of the nectar, or the “waters of life,” upon one’s head, resulting in a type of rebirth or generation of a new “self.”



## CONCLUSION

*Homa* sacrifices represent perhaps the most long-lived and pervasive practice in Asia. However, ritual structures are characterized by both continuity and change. While the ritual rules governing the interplay of fire and water have remained remarkably constant in rites such as *homa* for millennia, these rules have been interpreted in theologically specific ways. During the medieval period, elements \(such as meanings, nomenclature, substances, etc.\) emerged that appropriated ancient ritual structures in a manner specific to tantra.

This essay has focused on the ritual pairing of fire and water as a symbol and means of self-transformation. The tantric emphasis on self-purification and self-transformation significantly altered the ways in which ritual fire and water were understood to function. In a tantric context, divinities or deities are invited into the ritual fire where they become present. The ritual participant, via the emanating luminous rays, symbolically identifies and unites with the ritual fire, which exemplifies the central divinity \(usually conceived of as identical to wisdom itself\). This unification opens a mesocosmic circuit that enables direct contact with the luminous—a contact that results in the destruction of fetters, the bonds that have kept the participant in a deluded state. After these binding fetters are incinerated, literal or symbolic water sequences aid in the reconstruction of self—a self that now resembles the deity located at the center of one’s ritual universe. Water is sprinkled or poured upon the initiate in order to fill them, or overfill them, with purifying and regenerative qualities. Thus, in a tantric ritual universe, fire and water are instrumental in effecting the overarching tantric goal—the transformation of self.

Pervasive shared ritual technologies, such as those that characterize *homa* fire sacrifices, offer a valuable pool of data from which to investigate historical continuity and change. This study has used the ritual structure of *homa* fire sacrifices as a starting point to discover how these ritual rules remain constant yet acquire varying meanings over time. Given how widespread and foundational in Asian practice *homa* fire sacrifices are, much work certainly remains to be done.

The rites discussed in this essay most logically fit within this last category of internalized rites.

[^4]: The obvious exception here is found in the elaborate *śrauta* Vedic rites in which the traditional three fires are utilized; thus, fire is found in three locations while water has multiple locations. However, fire still represents the central element and is surrounded by water.

[^21]: Vedic healing rites, particularly those found in the *Atharva Veda*, are directed toward the self to the extent that the practitioner hopes to destroy *takman* or some other disease that afflicts the body. However, this differs significantly from the internalization of fire in a tantric context.

[^22]: In the Buddhist *Kriyāsaṃgraha*, for example, consecration rites utilize only water \(though light symbolism could be interpreted as replacing the internal fire\), whereas the use of internal fire is explicit in most Hindu tantric sources.

And the *Pariśiṣtas*, which contain several elements that overlap with Buddhist tantras, similarly depict water as “a means of purification by which the evil effects which may be connected with certain actions are removed or appeasement is realized.” Specifically, “after having pronounced the word vaṣat he \(the priest\) touches water; water is a means of appeasing and medicine \(against evil influences\) appeasing and medicine thus are produced at the end in the sacrifice” B.

White himself argues that “Indic metaphysics of rays came to be applied to the diverse yet interconnected fields of aesthetics, epistemology, climatology.”
