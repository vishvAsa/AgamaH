FIRE, IN ITS creative and destructive potency and in its luminous immediacy, has inspired a variety of ritual activities across religious settings and mythological contexts. We may briefly recall the lame god Hephaistos \(Grk. Ἥφαιστος; Lat. Vulcan\), master of weaponry, metallurgy and volcanoes worshipped by the Greeks and Romans, and Hestia \(Grk. Ἑστία; Lat. Vesta\), the virgin goddess of the hearth bestowing blessings on the altars of the faithful. Across the Black Sea, a national hero with a “flaming beard,” “hair of fire,” and “eyes of sun,” the sun-god and king Vahagn watches after the welfare of Armenians,1 and in the Far East the Shinto Hi-No-Kagu-tsuchi-no-kami \(radiant father\) or Homusubi-no-kami \(fire-growth\) is worshipped as a fire-god by the Japanese.2 In one of the most important of all Iranian ceremonies, devotees supplicate the “wise lord” and “world-creator” Ahura Mazdā to descend from the sky as heavenly fire and merge with the ritual hearth.3 Alhough nowadays worshipers of the medium of fire are commonly identified with Zoroastrianism, the official religion of Persia that lasted nearly a millennium, the religious hypostatization of fire may predate the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster.4 Magical customs of firewalking are noted in many parts of the world, while cases of self-immolating *śramaṇa*s \(Buddhists\) have been memorialized by the Greeks.5 In ancient Greek esoteric traditions death by fire was “a standard way of attaining heroic status;” especially by lightning that was seen as the purest form of death.6

In Vedic lore, the Universal Fire \(Agni Vaiśvānara\) is the “king of all worship” and “guardian of the cosmic law.”7

While the prevalance of fire rituals in Indian religions is well-attested, canonical texts of Early Buddhism rejected such rites, except in cremation ceremonies performed for the purpose of purifying the negative karma of the recently departed and avoiding physical and ritual pollution.8 However, the Buddha’s injunctions against the use of Vedic rituals may not have prevented some Buddhists from performing the rites of *homa* \(from the Skt. root √ *hu-*, meaning “to sacrifice” especially to pour butter into the fire\).9 Over time, *homa* formed an integral part of Buddhist ritual ceremonies in Tibet, Nepal and Japan, vindicating Strickmann’s observation of “a near-obsessive inclusiveness” in tantric Buddhism.10 Indian tantric Buddhists and their Tibetan successors readily adopted fire rituals as efficacious means to accomplish “lower activities” \(*smad las*\), or worldly goals like prosperity, protection, or power, and “higher activities” \(*stod las*\) or soteriological aspirations like liberation from *saṃsāra*. By and large, *homa* may take several hours, days, or weeks to perform at considerable expense incurred by the donors,11 and may be conducted in conjunction with other tantric rituals such as *sādhāna*s, initiations, consecrations, and tantric feasts \(*tshogs mchod*\).12

The transmission of *homa* texts and rites from India to Tibet was part and parcel of the soteriological mission of Indian Vajrayāna \(*rdo rje theg pa*\), and nowadays Tibetan Buddhist literature \(and Bön\) features a large repertoire of fire-ritual manuals that vary in length, complexity and function. Tibetan *homa* is linked to a variety of Mahayana Buddhas such as, Amitāyus, Akṣobhya, Vajrasattva; celestial bodhisattvas like Vajrapāṇi, Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara; Vajrayāna deities like Chakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, Vajrayoginī, Vajrabhairava, Vajrakīla; dharma protectors such as Mahākāla, Palden Lhamo; wealth deities like Dzambhala; tantric masters like Padmasambhava; “worldly gods” \(*’jig rten pa’i lha*\), and other non-human beings such as *garuḍa*s and *nāga*s.

In the following study we will examine the *Aparimitāyur-homa-vidhi-nāma* \(ApH\), a tantric manual in Tibetan translation preserved in the Tengyur \(“Translated Treatises”\)13 that links the Indian Mahayana lore and popular worship of Aparimitāyus with *homa* rituals. Presumably it was written by and for ritual specialists as a handbook containing abridged technical instructions on the intricacies of the “four rites” \(*las bzhi*, Skt. *catuṣkarman*\) found in Hindu and Buddhist tantras, namely: 1. “pacification” \(*zhi ba*, Skt. *śānti*\) of negative forces, obstacles, illnesses, malevolent intentions, obscurations, enemies, and black magic; 2. “enrichment” \(*rgyas pa*, Skt. *puṣṭi*\) of one’s lifespan, strength, wealth, merit, wisdom, splendor, prosperity, happiness, and so forth; 3. “subjugation” \(*dbang*, Skt. *vaśa*\) or control of a situation or the manipulation of important people like kings, queens, or ministers, and even gods, nāgas, and spirits; and 4. “sorcery” \(*mngon spyod*\) by “wrathful means” \(*drag po*, Skt. *abhicāra*\) for the purpose of summoning, separating, binding, suppressing, averting, killing, expelling, driving someone insane, and even causing natural disasters such as lightning, hail, and so on.

Originally there were “six activities” or rites \(Skt. *śaṭkarmāṇi*\) mentioned in the Indian tantras. 14 In Vajrayāna Buddhism the two activities of “conjuring forth” \(Skt. *vaśya, vaśīkaraṇa*\) and “causing harm” \(Skt. *māraṇa*\) were absorbed into the latter two activities of subjugation and wrath. Among the four kinds of *homa* activities, the rites of pacifying and enriching are more frequently performed by ritual specialists. *Homa*rituals of pacification \(*zhi ba’i sbyin sreg*\) are utilized during consecrations, before constructing a new house or going on a journey, and also at the end of meditation retreats in order to compensate for any excess or omission during the practice. In a general sense, they are carried out to eliminate obstacles, calamities, and everything that is considered inauspicious and an impediment to the attainment of liberation. They are sometimes performed on the last day of consecrations in order to purify mistakes that may have occurred during their performance.15



## THE LINEAGES OF APARIMITĀYUS IN TIBET

In Tibetan Buddhism, Aparimitāyus \(Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa\) is equated with the Buddha Amitāyus \(Tshe dpag med\), who is also known as Amitābha \(’Od dpag med\)—the Buddha who presides over his pure land Sukhāvatī. Although there are some issues concerning the origins of Aparimitāyus16 there is no question as to his importance in the development of Indo-Sino-Tibetan trends of “Pure Land Buddhism” in Central Asia.17

Two Kangyur and eight Tengyur texts are dedicated to this deity. The former include the *Immeasurable Life and Wisdom Sutra* \(or *The Sutra of Aparimitāyus*\), extant in nearly one thousand Tibetan and several hundred Chinese copies, and the *Dhāraṇī of the Essence of Aparimitāyus,* translated for the first time in Chinese \(T. 370\) between 502–557 C.E., and again in the first half of the ninth century \(T. 936\) by a Tibetan monk from Dunhuang, and by a monk from Nālandā in the second half of the tenth century \(T. 937\).18 Aparimitāyus texts in the Tengyur served as canonical precursors to a later systematization of life-extending rituals attributed to Aparimitāyus-Amitāyus conflated, by the eleventh century \(if not earlier\), into a single deity .19 From the Tengyur colophons we can reconstruct two seemingly independent lines of transmission of this deity to Tibet. One lineage is traceable to the Bengali Buddhist scholar Jetāri sometime between the end of the tenth and early eleventh century.20 Out of thirty texts attributed to Ācārya Jetāri in the Tengyur, three are dedicated to Aparimitāyus inspiring what came to be known as Jetāri’s system of long-life practices \(*dze ta ri’i lugs*\).21 The second Aparimitāyus lineage is credited to a twelfth-century figure by the name Jñānaḍākinī Siddharājñī. Siddharājñī is associated with the Indian pandita Valacandra who figures in the Tibetan translation of one Aparimitāyus text \(ApH\) in the Tengyur corpus and who features, rather curiously in Réchungpa’s \(Ras chung pa, 1082/4–1161\) biography and in relation to his meeting with the wisdom-*ḍākinī* in India.



### The Colophon of the Aparimit*ā*yur-homa-vidhi-n*ā*ma

The colophons in the Derge, Narthang and Cone editions provide similar information on the ApH’s author and Indo-Tibetan team of translators. They also include a Mahayana aspiration that all transmigrating beings may come to behold Buddha Amitāyus, either in this life or soon after death:

This fire-ritual cycle came to fruition as composed by the *ḍākinī* Siddharājñī \(Grub pa’i rgyal mo\). By virtue of this, may all transmigrating beings encounter Amitāyus. This \[text\] was translated by the Indian scholar Valacandra and the translator Glan dar ma tshul khrims.22

The formulaic wish to behold Amitāyus, common to a number of Mahayana works, is the only explicit “Pure Land” Buddhist theme in our text, save of a passing allusion to the “horse-neck” deity Hayagrīva \(folio 2, line 2\) that is, by some counts, the spiritual son of Buddha Amitābha.23 A certain “ḍākinī” \(*mkha’ ’gro ma*; lit., “sky-goer”\) known as the “Queen of Siddhas” \(Grub pa’i rgyal mo; Skt. Siddharājñī\) is mentioned as the author of our text.24 Traditionally, Amitāyus’ longevity rites have been associated with two female adepts known as the “Queen of Siddhas”: the ninth-century princess of the ancient kingdom of Zahor Mandāravā and one of Padmasambhava’s main consorts;25 and the twelfth-century female adept from Uḍḍiyāna encountered by Réchungpa in India and mentioned in his biography.26 We don’t seem to have any biographical information on Siddharājñī, and her story fits neatly with a legendary description of Mandāravā’s alleged accomplishment of the deities Hayagrīva and Amitāyus and the origins of related longevity practices to Tibet.

According to the “New” \(*gsar ma*\) Tibetan Tantric Schools, the lineage of Amitāyus long-life rituals was brought to Tibet by Réchungpa, the heart disciple of Tibet’s most famous yogi Milarépa \(Mi la ras pa\), after his encounter with Jñānaḍākinī Siddharājñī. It is said that he was struck by leprosy and went to India in search of a cure. There Réchungpa met the master Valacandra who advised him to go to the “City of Joy” where he received a prophesy that he had only seven months left to live. Distressed by the news, he pleaded with Valacandra for a cure. The Indian master send him to a place called the “Maṇḍala of the Golden Woodland Meadow” \(*shing spang gser gyi maṇḍal*\) to meet a *ḍākinī,* the “Queen Mother of Siddhas,” who had attained the *siddhi* of immeasurable life by the grace of Buddha Amitāyus. During their encounter she inquired how long he desired to live, to which Réchungpa replied, “until I feel it’s all right to die.” Hence, she extended his life for forty-four years and taught him the longevity practice of Amitāyus.

Réchungpa passed on the *ḍākinī’s* teachings to his heart teacher Milarépa along with the practice of the wrathful deity Hayagrīva \(Rta mgrin\) for dispelling obstacles. The transmission of this cycle of teachings came down to the illustrious physician and scholar Gampopa Sonam Rinchen \(Sgam po pa sod nams rin chen, 1079–1153\) and to all the lineage holders of the Dakpo Kagyü lineage.27 From there, it was passed on to the Drukpa lineage by Gyelwa Götsangpa \(Rgyal ba god tshang pa, 1189–1258\) and onward to the school of the Gélukpa through Tsongkhapa \(Tsong kha pa, 1357–1419\).28

Padma Karpo \(Padma dkar po, 1527–1592\) provides a brief account of the Tibetan “translator” \(*lo tsa ba*\) of the ApH, Lenchung Darma Tsültrim \(Glan chung dar ma tshul khrims\) from the Glan clan \(*gdung rus*\). This active translator of more than a dozen texts, also known as Lugyépa \(Klu brgyad pa\), is mentioned in the Kangyur and Tengyur and in the biographies of Réchungpa.29 There is not much in the Tibetan sources concerning Darma Tsültrim’s collaboration with the Indian scholar Valacandra other than what is available in Réchungpa’s biographies and only in relation to Réchungpa. In a variant narrative by Ζönnupel \(Gzon nu dpal, 1392–1481\), the well-known author of the *Blue Annals* \(*Deb ther sngon po*\), it is said that Guru Valacandra granted Réchungpa the mantra of a form of Vajrapāṇi \(*gtum po khyung sam can*\) that cured his leprosy.30 Although Ζönnupel mentions that Réchungpa received long-life practices from the Queen of Siddhas, this alternative version concerning his cure seems plausible as it accords with four tantric texts dedicated to Vajrapāṇi in the Tengyur translated by him and Darma Tsültrim.31



### A Summary of the homa of Aparimit*ā*yus

According to the ApH \(folio 1, line 2\) and other sources, supreme among the four rites is the “sorcery of fierce means” \(*drag po mngon spyod*\). This infamous fire sacrifice, the *abhicāra-homa*, is performed when all other subjugation rites have failed and a terrible conflict or threat caused by malignant forces threatens the Buddhist institutions and teachings, and the well-being of the community. According to the *Mahāvairocana-abhisambodhi-tantra*, one should perform the fierce rites to subdue menacing foes. For Bhavyakīrti, the tenth-century scholar and abbot of Vikramaśīla -- a renowned Buddhist center of learning during the Pāla dynasty -- fierce *homa* rituals can be employed for the purpose of subduing a rival kingdom.32 Under acute circumstances the ritual specialist may resort to the fierce *homa* to exterminate an opponent, as illustrated in the following passage of the Tibetan version of the *Śri-vajramahābhairava-tantra*:

The mantrin who desires to kill should, in union with the Buffalo-headed One \(i.e., the deity Vajrabhairava\), naked, with dishevelled hair and facing south, draw the sixteen-section wheel of Vajramahabhairava \(Vajrabhairava\) on a shroud in venom, blood, salt, black mustard, *nimbi* \(*Azadirachta indica*\) and *Datura* juice using a pen made from a raven feather or from a human bone. When he has placed it in between two fires along with the name of the victim of the rite, he surrounds it with ten syllables and writes eight HŪṂs. In the corners of the syllable PHAṬ is to be written. Anointing himself with warm butter he places this magical device within two crania. When he has placed it above three hearths, he should kindle a fire with cremation wood. Then he tramples it with his left foot and recites the ten syllable mantra. By this means the victim will doubtlessly die instantly.33

The ApH does not elaborate on this controversial type of sorcery that is rarely discussed openly. It offers instead an overview of the shapes, colors, and direction of sacred “fire pits” \(*thab khung*, Skt. *homa-kuṇḍa*\) to be constructed according to the type of fire rites performed \(lines 2–4\): for pacification activities \(*zhi ba*\) a white hearth of “circular shape” \(*zlum po*\), one cubit across and a cubit deep, facing to the east; for enrichment \(*rgyas pa*\), a “square” \(*gru-bzhi*\) yellow hearth, two cubits across and one cubit deep, facing to the north; for subjugating \(*dbang*\), a red hearth, bow-shaped, “semicircular” \(*zla gam*\) facing west; and for destructive sorcery \(*mngon spyod*\), a “triangular” \(*zur gsum*\) black hearth, twenty finger-widths, facing south. The designs of the four fire hearths correspond to the shapes, colors, and directions of the four continents of Mt. Meru and to the four elements with the pacifying circle representing water, the square the element earth, the semicircle air, and the triangle the element of fire.34



### Offerings, Utterances and Signs

An examination of the ApH shows that *homa* is a ritual genre of considerable sophistication that entails the organization of several “physical,” “cognitive” and “non-cognitive” phenomena that includes reading and following the instructions of the tantric manual, uttering prayers and mantras, invoking and visualizing Buddhist deities, casting liquid and solid substances and observing and interpreting the signs of the consuming flames. From the perspective of the officiating adept, the performance requires psychophysical coordination and an exercise in high correlative thinking that links the literary with the ritual traditions. 35

According to the ApH \(lines 4–5\), the officiating priest visualizes the “fire god” \(*me lha*\) in the red syllable *raṃ* and utilizes instruments comprising a “wand” \(*dbyu gu*\), a “round water vessel” \(*ril ba spyi blugs*\), and a “rosary” \(*bgrang ’phreng*\) for counting left to right. While absorbed in \(non-dual\) wisdom and crowned with the ornaments of the Buddha family he holds on to the silken braided string of Brahma, and offers “bathing water” \(*zhabs bsil*\) and “drinking water” \(*mchod yon*\).

The signs for the development of the ritual \(folio 2, line 1\) can be ascertained from the “color” \(*kha dog*\), “sound” \(*sgra*\), “appearance” \(*dbyibs*\), and “smell” \(*dri*\) of the burning wood. In the “waxing of the moon” \(*zla ba rgyas ba*\), if there is no smoke, illnesses and negative actions are exhausted without exception. There will be an increase in joy with objects such as conch shells, drums, and string instruments. The use of “sandalwood” \(*tsan dan*\), “camphor” \(*ga pur*\), and “aloe” \(*a ka ru*\) will induce virtue, long life, and auspiciousness. The “eight auspicious substances” \(*bkra shis rdzas brgyad*, Skt. *ashtamangala-dravya*\),36 a victory banner, a parasol, and so forth,37 are all signs of merit for practitioners, while the propitiation of Hayagrīva offers protection \(line 2\).

The “fire-offering substances” \(*bsreg rdzas*\), “butter” \(*mar*\) and “firewood” \(*yam shing*\) are used to fuel the sacred flames. One may cast “sesame seeds” \(*til*\), “grains and curd” \(*zho ’bras*\), “lentils or peas” \(*sran ma*\), “wheat” \(*gro*\), *dūrvā* and *kuśa* grass stalks. After that one recites this mantra:

oṃ agna ye svāhā / oṃ bodhi bṛikṣā ya svāhā / oṃ sarba pā paṃ da ha na badzrā ye svāhā / oṃ sarba saṃ pa de svāhā / oṃ badzra puṣṭa ye svāhā / oṃ badzra bi dza ye svāhā / oṃ ma hā be ga ye svāhā / oṃ ma hā ba la ye svāhā / oṃ badzra ghasma ri ye svāhā // oṃ badzra ā yu ṣe ye svāhā / oṃ a \(line 5\) pra ti ha da badzra ye svāhā.

The fire god is entreated and supplicated with the casting of offerings visualized in the center of the *maṇḍala* and dissolved in wisdom. The priest presents drinking water and bathing water for the feet \(line 6\). Venerating the mouth of the fire with “liquid” \(*khu ba*\), he offers firewood, *kuśa* grass to the radiance of the fire and recites the mantra: *ā u puṣṭi ku ru oṃ.* For the purpose of extending life, the officiant makes libations of “curdled milk” \(*sho*\), “grain meal” \(*zan*\), and drinking water offered to the gods \(folio 3, line 1\). With five nectars38 mixed with other substances, the accomplished master joins with the “small finger” \(*mthe’u chung*\) of his left hand the small finger of his disciple’s right hand. Oblations are made following the circumambulation of the hearth three times. The remaining “substances of accomplishment” \(*dngos grub rdzas*\) should be given to the disciples \(line 2\). Then follows the recitation of the mantra *oṃ badzra ā yu ṣe amṛita siddhi hūṃ\!*

For the peaceful *homa* combine the syllables *svā-hā*, for the enriching *oṃ-la*, for the subjugating *la-ho*, and for the destructive *ma-rā-ya-phaṭ.* Having venerated and propitiated the deities of the *maṇḍala* \(line 3\), request them to depart \(from the site\). Bestow them with offerings. The fire will fulfill all desires as the firewood burns with radiance \(line 4\). With the casting of butter, there will be increase in wealth; with the offering of sesame seeds, the cleansing of nonvirtuous actions will ensue; with the casting of yogurt and porridge, an enhancing of one’s ability for “reasoning” \(*rigs pa*\); with barley, one’s diligence and effort will increase; with rice, one’s power will grow; \(line 5\) with the oblation of grains and fruit, one’s fortune will multiply; with the casting of wheat and lentils, all illnesses and impurities will be cleared away; with *dūrvā* grass, there will be long life without sickness; with *kuśa* grass, there will be protection against obstacles;39 with milk and honey, there will come “attainment” \(*dngos grub*, Skt. *siddhi*\); and with the casting of firewood, auspiciousness will increase \(line 6\). Furthermore, the ways of good fortune will come to the sponsor of the ritual. The perfection of two provisions, “skilful means” \(*thabs*, Skt. *upāya*\) and “wisdom” \(*shes rab*, Skt. *prajñā*\), comes about with the use of the “ladle” \(*gzar bu*\) and satiation through the casting of nectar and butter.40 This is what is to be done with the sacrifices made by others.

Usually the Buddhist hearth is a temporary construction on a makeshift platform either near the vicinity of a practitioner’s retreat or in a secluded place. Occasionally we find a permanent structure for fire ceremonies in the courtyard of some monasteries, as in Thiksey \(Khrig rtse\) monastery east of Leh in Ladakh A stepped wall, which bears the color that corresponds to the type of *homa* rite being performed, is commonly erected in front of the throne of the ritual master to protect him from the flames. As for the ritual articles, there are those for worship \(*mchod rdzas*\) and the substances for burning \(*bsreg rdzas*\). According to a description furnished by Robert Beer, to the left of the master’s throne there is a brocade-covered altar upon which are placed “four purifying waters,” “three waterbowls,” and “three conch-shell receptacles.” On another altar the ritual implements of the *homa* specialist are situated, such as the inner offerings, the action vase, *kuśa* grass sprinkler, a bowl of consecrated rice and so forth. 41 On a large table to the right of the throne are arranged the offering substances.

Several accomplished attendants usually assist the ritual master with the elaborate procedures of the ritual, such as tending to the fire, presenting the offerings, handling the ritual ladles, playing the ritual music, and reciting prayers. Throughout the performance of the *homa* ritual, the master holds the *vajra* and bell on his right and left hands respectively. The following description is furnished in the *Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra*:

To the right of the teacher’s position there are the paraphernalia for *homa*, while the trainees reside to his left, squatting with heightened respect. He himself spreads auspicious grass \(*kuśa*\) on the ground and sits at ease. Alternatively \(when it is not possible to dig a hearth, he paints one\) with pigments, bright red and most imposingly beautiful—Anything that is painted will be effective: this is the simplified *homa* site. Around \(the hearth\) he spreads auspicious grass with the ends overlapping one another toward the right \(i.e., clockwise\), all wide and thick, and he sprinkles it all with perfumed water. Contemplating the honored one Agni out of pity for all, he should take a full ladle and make oblations to him with it, and at the same time the well-abiding \(*ācārya*\) should utter this mantra: *Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ, agnaye svāhā*. \(Homage to all Buddhas\! For Agni, *svāhā*\!\)42

Based on the instructions laid out in our text \(folio 4, line 1\), the hearth should be constructed at a solitary place and the ritual substances properly arranged. For the performance of peaceful *homa*, the offering of white sandalwood is appropriate. For the enriching *homa*, one should use wood from plants or trees bearing fruit and grain. For subjugation rites, red sandalwood should be used, and thorny wood for wrathful activities \(line 2\). In an open space together with eight different petals of a lotus flower to the left and right of the ritual master, the fire-offering substances are sequentially arranged to his right \(line 3\) and the offering vases to his left.

The ritual master begins the generation phase of “deity-yoga” \(*lha’i rnal ’byor*, Skt. *devata-yoga*\) along with the recitation of mantras for overcoming hindrances, followed by the visualization of Hayagrīva inside the ritual vase. The Brahmin \(*bram ze*\) \(line 4\) throws butterfat to the fire, causing the flames to rise, and requests the promotion of his activities. He does so by offering first to the fire deities of this world; second, by satisfying the deities of the extensive *maṇḍala*; and third, by offering his appreciation to the fire deity. Following this, the “wisdom deities” \(*ye shes pa*, Skt. *jñāna-sattva*\) are asked to depart, and the “pledge deities” \(*dam tshig*, Skt. *samaya-sattva*\) dissolve. The text ends by admonishing that the remains of the fire yoga should be dispersed in the waters of a river and the *homa* will yield its fruit.



## A BUDDHIST REJECTION AND REAPPROPRIATION OF FIRE RITUALS

In the *Brahmajāla-sutta* \(*Dīgha*-*nikāya* I, 9\), the Buddha repudiated and condemned *homa* sacrifices performed by Brahmins. Along with other money-making professions such as divination, the Buddha openly devalued and rejected a variety of *homa* rituals that employ fire \(*aggi-homa*\), ladles \(*dabbi-homa*\), mouth oblations \(*mukha-homa*\), husks \(*thusa-homa*\), grains \(*kaṇa-homa*\), rice \(*taṇḍula-homa*\), ghee \(*sappi-homa*\), oil \(*tela-homa*\), and blood \(*lohita-homa*\). It is unclear to what extent admonitions against Brahmanical rituals were followed by Buddhists at different places and times and before the compilation of the Pāli scriptures. Over time it appears that the Buddha’s admonitions were discarded by Indian Buddhists who promptly adopted *homa* in their ritual repertoire without any reference to the negative prescriptions of the *Brahmajāla-sutta* or any attempt to rationalize a progressively complex and fatuous ritualism that came to characterize the Buddhist tantras.43



### Brahmanical Rituals in a Buddhist Text

As we have seen the ApH is attributed to the Buddhist deity Aparimitāyus while its contents reflect a summary for the execution of Brahmanical rituals \(*cho ga*, Skt. *vidhi*\) with no apparent relation to Buddhist doctrines per se. Unambiguous references to the Brahmins and to the Vedic gods Agni and Brahma in the ApH suggests that fire rites were initially performed by Brahmin officiants at the behest of Buddhist patrons. Professional Buddhists in India, monastics and tantrikas, were competing not only for patronage but also for ritual competence and religious prestige, and they would have readily performed *homa* on behalf of interested donors, especially if the latter belonged to the powerful and wealthy strata of Indian society. The scarcity of readily available Brahmins in Tibet could easily justify the performance of ApH rituals by Tibetan Buddhist specialists, lay or ordained. And this scarcity, juxtaposed with an increased demand for new ritual technologies imported from the land of Buddhism, accounts for the popularity fire offerings enjoyed in Tibet and the culturally Tibetan regions of the Himalayas. It is therefore not surprising that *homa,* by some counts, is considered one of the three most significant rituals that every Vajrayāna Buddhist master in Tibet should be able to perform.44

As with other ritual exchanges between skilled experts and clients, the setting of Tibetan votive offerings is framed according to the requirements and expectations of the participants. At the most fundamental level of Mahayana practice, *homa* may be sponsored for the purpose of accumulating merit \(*bsod nams*, Skt. *puṇya*\) for oneself and others in hope of a better life, rebirth in superior realms, and even liberation from *saṃsāra* through the cleansing of negative karma.

At the relative level of truth \(*kun rdzob bden pa*, Skt. *samvṛtisatya*\), *homa* features complex outer performances \(*phyi*\) related to vocal utterances, ceremonial use of colors, forms and physical activities \(*las*\) like “hand-gestures” \(*phyag rgya*, Skt. *mudrā*\), libations, and the casting of various medicinal and nourishing substances into the “mouth of fire.” In a socially constructed nexus of cognitive, emotive and abstract correspondences seemingly discreet verbal and mental activities and experiences \(visual, olfactory, auditory\) are ceremonially granted unity through a stylized external presentation and manipulation of surrounding objects with distinct properties linked \(directly or indirectly\) to the form and meaning of the ritual.45 It would appear that several kinds of “outer sacrifices” or “external *homa*s” were practiced by medieval Buddhists challenging untenable dichotomies posited between a “Buddhism of doctrines” on the one hand, and “esoteric forms and trends” on the other.46 Furthermore, presupposing a dominant religious function to rituals in general and *homa* in particular can be misleading. Fire is clearly associated with culturally reinforced concepts such as “transformation,” “luminosity,” “purification,” “food,” “consumption,” “heat,” and “danger.”47 From the perspective of religious reform, fire ceremonies have been denounced as “spiritually useless” at the time of the Buddha and in some Hindu schools they were transfigured into “inner sacrifices” \(internal fire rituals\) that require neither an audience nor an external performance. 48 For the *Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra*: 

There are two kinds of *homa*, namely, internal and external: One obtains liberation from karma and \(re\)birth, and there is also the arising of sprouts and seeds \(of awakening\). Because it is able to burn away karma, it is called ‘internal homa.’ For external use there are three positions \(i.e., practitioner, hearth, and deity\), and these three positions dwell within \(each of\) the three. Accomplishing the path of the three actions \[*śāntika, pauṣṭika,* and *ābhicāruka*\] is the excellent mundane *homa*.49 The continuity and transformation of these media as inner rites \(*nang*\) is analogically presented in food to be consumed by digestive heat and the unexcelled \(*bla na med pa*\) offering of the blazing of enlightened wisdom that *burns away* all cognitive-cum-emotive imperfections. At the ultimate level of interpretation \(*don dam bden pa*, Skt. *paramārthasatya*\), all visible/external and invisible/internal gestures are understood as reflections on the nonsubstantial, fleeting, and dependently arisen nature of these rites.

A superimposed Mahayana perspective that runs through Buddhist *homa* rituals—whether external, formalized, and interpretable, or internal, nonverbal, and symbolic—is the legitimation of the rite as the “skill-in-means” \(*thabs*, Skt. *upāya*\) of an esoteric variety that centers on incorporating and reenacting interpretations of the fire-god Agni \(Lat. *ignis*\) under the spiritual tutelage of Buddhist deities. In a meta-narrative reading, actions, rituals details, symbolic signs, and mental processes mirror each other in microcosmic-macrocosmic relationality and in accordance with the law of “co-dependent arising” \(*rten cing ’brel bar’byung ba*\). The inner performative logic of *homa* presupposes literal and metaphorical points of reference and correspondences between actions, expectations, and events played out in real time, but coming into effect in the timeless realization of emptiness beyond the inter-play of ritual and interpretation . Hence, the recognition of the emptiness or “co-dependent arising” of “agent, ritual \(agency\), and other \(recipient\)” during the performance constitutes an interpretive constant that unifies the following disparate elements: \(1\) the preparatory training, motivation, and spiritual qualities of the officiating priest \(i.e., the outer, inner, and secret qualifications of the ritual expert to perform external, internal and non-dual offerings\); \(2\) a ritualized sequence of actions strictly relying on the specificity of constructing the fire altar and choosing the right place, time, instruments, and offering substances \(as prescribed in the *homa* texts, oral instructions, and commentarial literature\); and \(3\) the kratophanies of the invoked/supplicated Buddhist deity-forms. Arguably, these are some salient elements for a Buddhist theorization of *homa* understood in its own particular ritual terms and narrative contents.

[^6]: Heroic acts of self-sacrifice by fire featured in Orphic mysteries and in the earliest traditions surrounding Herakles’ fiery death on Mt. Oeta and Empedokles’ plunge into the active volcanic crater of Etna. See Peter Kingsley, *Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic. Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition* \(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995\), p. 258.

[^7]: Propitiated by the officiating Brahmin priest, Agni carries the offerings from the earth to the heavenly realms and serves as the mouth or medium from which the Vedic deities may partake of the sacrificial offerings; see Nakamura, *A Comparative History of Ideas*, p. 89.

[^8]: Generally speaking, cremation ceremonies are classified as *homa* of the pacifying variety \(*zhi ba’i sbyin sreg*\); see Martin Brauen, “Death Customs in Ladakh,” *Kailash* 9/4 \(1982\): 322. According to the *Sarvadurgatipariśodhana-tantra* \(321.7–322.42\):\[I\]‌f the body of the deceased is available, then the Tantric officiant will cremate the corpse in a *homa* sacrifice seven days after death has occurred. Before the cremation the corpse is cleansed with consecrated water and milk, purified with incense and perfume, wrapped in a clean cloth, and decorated with flowers. The Tantric yogin then writes the syllables of the mandala’s mantra on a card and touches the card at various points on the body while reciting the mantra. Placing the corpse in the center of the hearth, the yogin performs the *homa* rite. He envisages Agni, the consumer of the fire offerings, and Vajrapāṇi in wrathful form…. They serve as the divine recipient and the agent for transforming the deceased person’s karmic condition. See Zeff Bjerken, “On Mandalas, Monarchs, and Mortuary Magic: Siting the *Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra* in Tibet,” *Journal of the American Academy of Religion* 73/3 \(2005\): 828.

[^9]: Reliefs in Gandhāra depicting Siddhārtha’s marriage to Yaśodhara portray the popular and normative use of *homa* at least on the occasion of sacramental ceremonies, such as weddings among Buddhists; see Giovanni Verardi, *Homa and Other Fire Rituals in Gandhara* \(Naples: Istituto Universitario Orientale, 1994\), pp. 4–5.

[^10]: See Michael Strickmann, “Homa in East Asia,” in Frits Staal, ed., *Agni: The Vedic Ritual of the Fire Altar* \(Berkeley: Asian Humanities Press, 1983\), p. 425; Tadeusz Skorupski, “Jyotirmañjarī of Abhayākaragupta,” in Tadeusz Skorupski, ed., *The Buddhist Forum VI* \(Tring, UK: Institute of Buddhist Studies, 2001\), p. 184.

[^11]: Tāranātha in his *History of Buddhism in India* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1990\) p. 278, reports that Buddhajñānapāda, the Vajrācārya of Vikramaśīla and foremost disciple of Haribhadra, persuaded king Dharmapāla to perform the great *homa* so that his dynasty endures passed beyond the rule of his grandson \(*tsha bo*\). Dharmapāla sponsored the performance of the *homa* for many years and offered “articles worth nine lakh and two thousand \**tolā*-s of silver.” He also writes that Vimuktasena propitiated Ajitanātha for ten years without any signs of success. When he asked *ācārya* Candrakīrti what is to be done he advised him “to perform a *homa* for removing the obscurations caused by sin. After offering twelve lakhs of *homa*-s, he received a vision \(of Ajitanātha\) in the *kuṇḍa*;” p. 212. This was also the case with Vararuci who made *ārya* Avalokiteśvara appear before him and obtained the *siddhi*-s having performed a fire offering costing four lakhs of gold; p. 112.

[^12]: For example, *homa* rituals are performed to induce rainfall and to enhance the potency of Tibetan medicine \(*sman sgrub*\); see Frances Garrett, “The Alchemy of Accomplishing Medicine \(*sman sgrub*\): Situating the *Yuthok Heart Essence \(G.yu thog snying thig*\) in History and Literature,” *Journal of Indian Philosophy* 37 \(2009\): 208.

[^13]: The Tengyur and the Kangyur \(“the Words of the Buddha”\), almost 5,000 scriptures in all, form the Tibetan Buddhist canon. Nearly identical copies of the Tibetan translation of ApH, the *Tshe dpag tu med pa’i sbyin sreg gi cho ga,* are located in the Derge \(no. 2144, ff. 219r–220r\), Narthang \(vol. 46, ff. 249v–251r\), Cone \(vol. 49, ff. 224r–225r\), and Ganden Tengyurs \(vol. 46, ff. 346r–348r\).

[^16]: Payne assigns Buddha Aparimitāyus to the Indian proto–Pure Land milieu, and dates the earliest known Aparimitāyus text to about the fifth century; see Richard K. Payne, “Aparimitāyus: ‘Tantra’ and ‘Pure Land’ in Late Medieval Indian Buddhism?” *Pacific World* 3/9 \(2007\): 276–280.

[^17]: In the Tibetan Kangyur and Tengyur, there are 18 texts, including the short and long *Sukhāvatīvyūha* sutras, attributed to the Pure Land deity known by the names: Amitābha, Amitāyus, and Aparamitāyus. The popularity of the *Ārya-aparimitāyur-jñāna-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra* \(*Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa zhes bya ba theg pa chen po’i mdo*\) in Tibet, China and Central Asia during the time of the Tibetan Empire fits well within Gregory Schopen discussion of the “cult of the book” see Schopen, “The Phrase ‘*sa pṛthivīpradeśaś caityabhūto bhavet*’ in the *Vajracchedikā*: Notes on the Cult of the Book in Mahāyāna,” *Indo-Iranian Journal* 17/3–4 \(1975\): 147–181. The dedication of the *Immeasurable Life and Wisdom Sutra* to the Tibetan emperor Khri Gtsug lde brtsan testifies to the Tibetan prominence of this Pure Land text that was reproduced in conspicuously large numbers across the Tarim basin. While Tibetan translations occupy nearly 950 scrolls, it exists also in Tangut and Central Asian translations. For an introduction and English translation of the *Immeasurable Life and Wisdom Sutra*, see Georgios T.

[^20]: Also Jitāri, or Guhyajitāri \(Dgra las rnam rgyal or Dgra las rgyal ba gsang ba\) appears to have been a native of Bengal and teacher of Atiśa; see Sarat Chandra Das, *Indian Pandits in the Land of Snow* \(Calcutta: Baptist Mission Press, 1983\), pp. 40, 50. For a list of his works surviving in Sanskrit and Tibetan, see Siglinde Dietz, *Die Buddhistische Briefliteratur Indiens* \(Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz 1984\), pp. 47–49.

[^21]: Two works with the title *Ārya-Aparimitāyur-jñāna-sādhana-nāma* are ascribed to Jetāri and Siddharājñī \(“Queen of Siddhas”\) but in fact they are two different texts that bear the same title in the Derge and Narthang Tengyurs.The Aparimitāyus texts attributed to Jetāri are: \(1\) *Aparimitāyuḥ-stotra* \(*Tshe dpag med la bstod pa*; D 2698, *Rgyud*, nu 66b3–67a3\); \(2\) *Aparimitāyurjñana-vidhi-nāma* \(*Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa’i cho ga*; D 2700, *Rgyud*, nu 67b4–69a4\); and \(3\) *Ārya-Aparimitāyur-jñāna-sādhana* \(*’Phags pa tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa’i sgrub thabs*; D 2699; *Rgyud*, nu 67a3–67b4\). Jetāri’s influence can be discerned in later collections that include: the *Nine-deity Maṇḍala of Amitāyus according to the System Transmitted by Ācārya Jetāri* \(*Tshe dpag med lha dgu slob dpon dze ta ri’i lugs kyi dkyil ’khor*\) in the *Rgyud sde kun btus* \(vol. 2, pp. 113–210\); the *Ritual Text of Abhiṣeka of Long Life* \(*Tshe chog bdud rtsi’i chu gter*\) in Tāranātha’s *Collected Works* \(vol. 12, pp. 793–832\); the *Contemplation of Amitāyus According to Jetāri Tradition* \(*Tshe dpag me dze tā ri’i lugs kyi bsgom bzlas tshe dpal ye shes kun ’grub*\) in Kun dga’ blo gros’ *Collected Works* \(vol. 4, pp. 107–112\); and a ritual text for the *abhiṣeka* of long-life according to Jetāri \(*Chi bslu’i zur ’debs*\) in the *Collected Works* of Ngag dbang bstan ’dzin ’phrin las, pp. 749–758.

[^23]: Hayagrīva is a Hindu and a Buddhist deity and the two deities claim distinct origins and iconography. In one of his forms in Buddhism, he appears as an emanation of Buddha Amitābha in wrathful form, red color, and a horse’s head over his principle face; see Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, *The Indian Buddhist Iconography: mainly based on the Sādhanamālā and cognate tāntric texts of rituals* \(Calcutta: Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, 1987\) pp. 146–147. For a link between the two deities, see the reply to questions raised by Sdings po che mchog sprul rin po che concerning the empowerment of Amitāyus in union with Hayagrīva according to the *Ras chung snyan brgyud*, a transmission received by Ras chung from Ma gcig grub pa’i rgyal mo; *Tshe rta’i dbang bskur rgyas ’bring bya lugs sdings che sprul sku rin po che’i dri lan* \(*kha yo*\), located in the *Collected Works* of Kun gzigs chos kyi snang ba, vol. 2, pp. 419–424. There is a *Hayagrīva-sādhana* in the Tengyur attributed to Ma gcig grub pa’i rgyal mo; see n.25.

[^24]: The following five Tengyur texts are attributed to Jñānaḍākinī Siddharājñī and the last two to Siddharājñī who is probably the same person: \(1\) *Hayagrīva-sādhana* \(*Rta mgrin gyi sgrub thabs*; D 2142, *Rgyud*, tshi 215b4– 216a5; \(2\) *Aparimitāyur- jñāna-nāma-sādhana* \(*Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa zhes bya ba’i sgrub thabs*; D 2143, *Rgyud*, tshi 216a5–219a3; \(3\) *Aparimitāyur- homa-vidhi-nāma* \(*Tshe dpag tu med pa’i sbyin sreg gi cho ga zhes bya ba*; D 2144, *Rgyud*, tshi 219a4–220a5\); \(4\) *Aparimitāyur-jñāna-sādhana* \(*Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa’i sgrub thabs*; D 2145, *Rgyud*, tshi 220a5–223a3\); \(5\) *Bhagavad-aparimitāyur- jñāna-maṇḍala-vidhi-nāma* \(*Bcom ldan ’das tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa’i dkyil ’khor gyi cho ga zhes bya ba*; D 2146, *Rgyud*, tshi 223a3–231a3; \(6\) *’Phags pa ’jig rten dbang phyug gsang ba’i sgrub thabs zhes bya ba* \(no Sanskrit title; D 2140, *Rgyud*, tshi 205a3–210a3; \(7\) *Aparimitāyur-jñāna-maṇḍala-vidhi-nāma* \(*Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa’i dkyil ’khor gyi cho ga zhes bya ba*; D 2141, *Rgyud*, tshi 210a3–215b4\). There are several important ritual cycles focusing on *Amitāyus* longevity rites attributed to her system \(*lugs*\), such as: \(in brief\) the *Amitāyus System based on Grub pa’i rgyal mo* \(*Grub pa’i rgyal mo’i lugs kyi tshe dpag med lha gcig bum gcig gi byin rlabs dbang bskur gyi cho ga ’chi med bdud rtsi’i grol thigs*\), in ’Jam mgon kong sprul blo gros mtha’ yas, *Bka’ brgyud sngags mdzod* \(vol. 1, pp. 213–240\); *Amitāyus Deity-yoga based on Grub pa’i rgyal mo* \(*Tshe dpags med grub rgyal lugs kyi bskyed rdzogs zab khrid*\), in ’Jam mgon kong sprul blo gros mtha’ yas, *Rgya chen bka’ mdzod* \(vol. 5, pp. 543–595\); *Amitāyus System of Rituals and Empowerments based on Grub pa’i rgyal mo* \(*Ma gcig grub pa’i rgyal mo’i lugs kyi tshe dpag med kyi dbang chog*\), in Mkhyen brtse’i dbang po, *Sgrub thabs kun btus* \(vol. 1, pp. 327–362\); *Aparimitāyus Oral Instructions for Meditation by Grub pa’i rgyal mo* \(*Tshe dang ye shes dpag tu med pa’i khrid dmigs grub pa’i rgyal mo’i zhal lung*\), in Kun dga’ grol mchog, *Gsung thor bu* \(vol. 2\); among several other works in the collected works of Kun gzigs chos kyi snang ba \(1768–1822\), Ngag dbang blo bzang bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan \(1770–1845\), and others.

[^25]: Mandāravā is often called the “sole mother queen of siddhas” \(*ma gcig grub pa’I rgyal mo*\) who was not “of a human lineage…\[but\]…a wisdom-dakini who has appeared in the human realm,” bearing the “thirty-two and eight auspicious marks of a Buddha;” see Judith Simmer-Brown, *Dakini’s Warm Breath: The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism* \(Boston and London: Shambhala, 2002\) p. 191. In the *Za hor rgyal po’i sras mo lha lcam man dha ra wa’i rnam par thar pa*, a liberation narrative redacted in the nineteenth century by Bsam gtan gling pa phrin las ’gro ’dul, we read that after practicing for three months with Padmasambhava at the Maratika cave in the Khotang district of Nepal she had clear visions of Buddha Amitāyus and Hayagrīva and attained the *siddhi* of Amitāyus, a life immortal in this body. Following her attainment she “compiled a treasury of more than a thousand extensive and concise longevity methods, including essential pointing-out instructions. Both guru and consort became free from the process of birth, and death, until the end of this age of ongoing existence;” translated into English by Lama Chonam and Sangye Khandro in *The Lives and Liberation of Princess Mandarava* \(Boston: Wisdom Publication, 1998\), p. 153.

[^32]: On such destructive rituals in India see Hans-Georg Turstig, “The Indian Sorcery Called *Abhicāra*.” *Wiener Zeitschrift fur die Kunde Sudasiens* 29 \(1985\): 69. In his commentary on chapter 31 of the *Cakrasamvara Tantra*, Bhavyakīrti writes:Then the destruction of all, arising from the vajra, is held \[to be accomplished\] with the great meat. It is the dreadful destroyer of all the cruel ones. Should one thus perform without hesitation the rites of eating, fire sacrifice \(*homa*\), and sacrificial offerings \(*bali*\) with the meats of dogs and pigs, and also with \[the meat of\] those \[chickens\] that have copper \[colored\] crests, everything without exception will be achieved, and all kingdoms will be subdued.

The contents of our text resonate with Kong sprul yon tan rgya mtsho’s \(1813–1899\) survey on the four *homa* rites according to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of treasures \(*gter lugs*\); see the *General Requirements for the Practice of Four Homa Rites* \(*Las bzhi’i sbyin sreg spyi la nye bar mkho ba’i lag len*\) in the *Rin chen gter mdzod*, vol. 67, pp. 47–98.

[^36]: The eight auspicious substances, or lucky articles, consist of a mirror, precious medicine, yogurt or curds, *durva* grass, the *bilva* fruit, a white conch, cinnabar or vermilion powder, and white mustard seeds. According to Beer \(*The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs*, p. 188\), the eight auspicious substances “essentially represent the four *karmas* or activities of an enlightened being. The mirror, medicine and yoghurt represent peaceful activities; the *durva* grass, *bilva* fruit and conch represent activities of increase; the vermilion powder represent the activity of magnetizing or empowering; and the mustard seed represents destructive activity.”

[^37]: The parasol and the victory banner are two of the “eight auspicious symbols” \(*bkra shis rtags brgyad*\), originally a group of early Indian symbols of royalty.

[^38]: The incorporation of five bodily “nectars” in tantra \(*bdud rtsi lnga*, Skt. *pañcāmṛta*\), also known as the five sacramental substances, are semen \(white elixir\), blood \(red elixir\), urine, excrement, and flesh. These form the impure “left-hand” tantric equivalents of the orthodox Hindu five “pure nectars” refered to in our text: the “three whites” \(*dkar gsum*\) milk, curd, and ghee and the “two sweets” \(*mngar gnyis*\) honey and molasses.

[^39]: *Dūrvā* \(*capriola dactylon*\) and *kuśa* \(*poa cynosoroides*\) grasses are both considered sacred in Indian contexts and there are legends associated with their religious significance; see Beer, *The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs*, p. 189.

[^40]: Two of the most important ritual instruments for the performance of *homa* are a circular “ladle” \(*blug gzar*, Skt. *shrava*\), used to pour the melted butter or ghee and liquid substances into the square pouring “spoons” \(*dgang gzar*\), and a bowl or scoop utilized to transfer the seeds, grains, and solid substances into the fire.

[^43]: Tāranātha, *History of Buddhism in India,* p. 275, reports that the Vikramaśīla-vihāra had even provisions for a Homa-ācārya. Yael Bentor notes in “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and Tibet,” *Journal of the American Oriental Society* \(2000\): 609, that “Tibetan Buddhism does not require a strategy of presenting non-vedic practices in vedic garb. When Buddhism adapted fire rituals, their internalized forms were already firmly established. While Indic Buddhist texts were aware of the popularity of fire rituals among non-Buddhists, and therefore designate such non-Buddhist *homa* as false, Tibetan Buddhism gradually lost contact with ‘heretic’ fire rituals. Their vedic origin was forgotten and the ritual was attributed to the Buddha.”

[^44]: According to Rje-brsun Grags-pa rgyal-mtshan’s \(1147–1216\) commentary on the *Hevajra-tantra*, the most important actions of a *vajrācārya* \(*rdo rje slob dpon*\), are initiations, consecrations, and fire rituals; see Bentor, *Consecration of Images & Stupas in Indo-Tibetan Tantric Buddhism*, p. 50.

[^45]: For an informative discussion on the form and meaning of objects and their analogical relation \(positive and negative\) to “magical acts” see Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, *Culture, Thought and Social Action* \(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1985\), pp.60–86.

[^46]: For the pertinence of esoteric currents and ritualism in the Buddhism of Thailand and Burma see Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, *The Buddhist Saints of the Forest and the Cult of the Amulets,* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984\).

[^47]: The same process is described as follows by Bentor, “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and Tibet,” p. 606: “…the fire of Enlightened Wisdom destroys duality through the union \(*zung-’jug, yuganaddha*\) of the object and subject \(*gzung-’dzin*\), wisdom and means \(*shes-rab, prjañā* and *thabs, upāya*\), tranquil abiding \(*zhi- gnas, śamatha*\) and penetrative insight \(*lhag-mthong, vipaśyanā*\), emptiness \(*stong-pa-nyid, śūnyatā*\) and compassion \(*snying-rje, karuṇā*\), and so forth.”

[^48]: The following passage from the *Liṅga Purāṇa* demonstrates the point in question:The aspirant who seeks salvation shall perform the non-violent sacrifice Dhyānayajña \(meditation\). One shall meditate on the fire stationed in the heart and perform the sacrifice of meditation. After realizing Śiva stationed in the body of all living beings, the lord of universe, he shall devoutly perform the sacrifice by Prāṇāyāma perpetually. He who performs the external Homa becomes a frog in the rock. See Bentor, “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and Tibet,” p. 595.
