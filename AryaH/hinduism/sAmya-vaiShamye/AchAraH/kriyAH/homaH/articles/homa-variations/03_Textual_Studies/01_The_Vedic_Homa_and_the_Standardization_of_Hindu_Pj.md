## INTRODUCTION

The *homa*, the ritual offering of food in a fire, has had a prolific career in Asia over the course of more than three millennia.1 In various forms, rites of this type have become a part of most of the religions that arose in India as well as their extensions and offspring from Samarqand to Japan. All of these *homa*s ultimately descend from those of the Vedic religion, but at no point has the *homa* been stable. Like fire itself, it has flickered with many flames, glowing under the ashes in one place while flaring up in another, spreading, marking, and transmuting what it touches. Within the Vedic tradition, Agni played diverse roles: “Flesh-eater” in the funeral, “Offering-bearer” when yoked for sacrifice, then rewarded as “He Who Has Offered Well,” praised as “Everyman’s” because he is active in every hearth and in every heart.

The rules for Vedic fire offerings have come down to us in two parallel systems. A few of the later exegetical passages \(*brāhmaṇa*\) in the Vedas refer to “cooked food” \(*pāka*\)2 offerings contrasted with the multiple-fire ritual otherwise being prescribed.3 Later Smārta tradition \(the Brahmanical tradition that adheres to the “secondary” revelation, *smṛti*\) characterizes the full priestly cult as based on the “revealed” \(*śruti*\) sacred texts of the Vedas \(hence “*śrauta*”\), in contradistinction to the “homely” \(*gṛhya*\) or “worldly” \(*laukika*, or even “popular” in the sense of “conventional”\).

The fire offering was the most distinctive feature of the Vedas, so when the Brahmin priesthood sought to put its stamp on a wider range of religious practices, they used the *homa* rite as a template. An early result of this policy is the *Gṛhyasūtra* corpus, which systematizes a wide variety of non-*śrauta* ceremonies in imitation of the *śrauta*cult as it is canonized in the *Śrautasūtra*s. These codes are presented as extensions of the *śrauta* codes and refer back to them on many occasions. The models for this systematization partly mimic the sorts of classification and ritual formatting rules \(e.g., *ūha, tantra/āvāpa, prakṛti*/*vikṛti*\) that had been developed for the multiple-fire rites, but other innovations are introduced as well.

Speaking of Buddhist and Jain appropriations of Hindu rituals a thousand years later, Phyllis Granoff describes the phenomenon as “ritual eclecticism”:

The group of insiders explicitly acknowledges that others have rituals, and then enjoins or permits the practice of those rituals along with the rituals specific to the group itself. To be more concrete, in what I am calling “ritual eclecticism,” the Jain or Buddhist explicitly acknowledges the existence of a non-Jain or non-Buddhist ritual, and then tells Jains or Buddhists that they can perform the non-Jain, non-Buddhist version with the same success as the Jain or Buddhist ritual.4

The difference here is that the Vedic priests do not openly acknowledge any such otherness so far as the religious group is concerned. However, a substantial difference is signaled and overcome: many of the rites prescribed in the *Gṛhyasūtra*s lacked features that could readily be correlated with features of the *śrauta* system; some could be seen as falling short of the status of ritual acts \(*karmāṇi*\), constituting mere “auspicious ceremonies” \(*maṅgalāni*\) such as those airily dismissed by Aśoka as utterly pointless.5

Descriptive studies of the *gṛhya* liturgy are legion, but few people have sought to reconstruct the internal development of this aspect of the Brahmanical tradition, except in the broadest terms, over the *longue durée.* There are a few recent exceptions, however. Shingo Einoo has shown that the early history of *pūjā*-type Hindu worship—devotional worship involving offerings to the deity—can be traced in Vedic domestic ritual codes, where many probably very early Sanskrit models of image worship were structured around a *homa*, the offering of the honey-drink \(*madhuparka*\), or both.6

Some of my own work has traced the consolidation of *gṛhya* liturgy as a reorientation of the Brahmin priestly profession that increasingly relied on *rites de passage* and disciplinary regimens \(*vrata*s\) as public markers of an idealized social model.7 A recent dissertation by Granoff’s student Marko Geslani does something similar for Vedic appeasement rites \(*śānti*\), showing how these provided a framework for many *pūjā* offering rites, largely under the influence of *Atharva-Veda* specialists.8 This article aims to clarify another aspect of this history: the Vedicization of *pūjā*-type offerings though assimilation to the *gṛhya homa*.

Merely stating the topic in these terms reveals that, like many others, I regard such offerings as an innovation in the Vedic religion, and indeed a borrowing from a substrate or neighboring culture with which the Vedic priesthood and its traditional clientele were in contact—a culture the identity of which will likely remain forever uncertain.9 What is clear is that nothing quite like *pūjā* can be found in the oldest strata of the Vedic literature, and as it begins to creep in the authors of the codes are at pains to assign to it a Vedic character, by various means, and to connect the deities thus honored with those already familiar to the Vedic pantheon. At no point is there direct acknowledgment that either the deity or the ceremony is non-Vedic, but an indirect acknowledgment of this may be perceived here and there.

In any case, the primary means of assimilating new religious elements, whether found outside the tradition or innovated from within, was by superimposing Vedic ritual structures \(such as that of the *homa, madhuparka, vrata*, or *śānti*\) over them, while inserting into them Vedic \(or Vedic-style\) mantras, the DNA of Vedic ritual. These adaptations served dual purposes: to appropriate borrowed ritual forms so that they would not seem alien from the Brahmanical point of view and to ensure a role for the expert services of the Brahmin priesthood in religious milieux in which they had previously been absent. My examples here focus on the role of the *homa* and its mantras in such appropriations.



## RITUAL SYNTAX AND RITUAL CHANGE

The scenario suggested above presupposes that a historical progression can be discerned or reconstructed, at least in its broad outlines, from an examination of liturgical texts and the ritual practices that they model. This is no simple matter, and it calls for a reflection on method. First, we must admit that the object of study is an assortment of rituals per se and the particular texts that prescribed them. The texts themselves pose daunting problems as sources of knowledge, as they are anonymous works of uncertain provenance and date, probably composite in origin, and inadequately edited in their standard published forms. The scope of this essay does not permit dealing with these problems, beyond accepting heuristically that they were produced by Brahmin experts in Vedic ritual sometime in the long period beginning with the reign of the Mauryas and ending roughly with the Gupta period. We should further note that these are prescriptive, normative works and actual practice may never have conformed precisely or consistently during this period. It is likely that at least the communities to which these texts belonged made an effort to follow the models, and the descriptions of these models may indeed have been intended to standardize patterns of practice already in use in some circles at the time of the texts’ composition.

As regards the rites depicted in these texts, they employ the same sort of segmented, multilayered structure as the *śrauta* Vedic rites. Complex rites are built up from a vast repertory of individual ritual units, each consisting of a simple action or gesture or a stipulated verbal formula \(mantra\), or a coordination of both.

Caroline Humphrey and James Laidlaw, in *The Archetypal Actions of Ritual*, following Jane Monnig Atkinson,10 distinguished between “liturgy-centered” and “performance-centered” ritual. Rites of the latter type tend to be less scripted, relying on “a repertoire of ritual actions available to performers acting independently in the ritual arena.”11 Like bardic song, such rites are formulaic but not fixed; this is “inspirational ritual” that is deemed successful to the same extent as the charismatic authority of the particular performer is felt to be established or confirmed \(as in the case of a shaman\).

Vedic ritual, including the rites to be examined here, belongs much more to the other end of the spectrum. Such rites are identified in terms of their conformity to an explicit, textual model. They are judged effective *ex opere operato*, and the only elements left to the discretion of the individual performer are by definition those marked as inessential or para-ritual. The ritualist’s qualifications are purely formal or official, rather than personal or numinous. Humphrey and Laidlaw note that it is precisely their greater “ritualization” that distinguishes the actions of liturgical ritual. It is this determinacy of form that that makes it easier to track changes in liturgy.

We owe to Frits Staal the observation that Vedic ritual is composed of basic and secondary elements combined in patterns that he calls “syntax” \(by analogy with linguistic structure\). This syntax includes patterns such as transformation, recursiveness, and embedding.12 This syntax is “generative” in the sense that smaller ritual units may be combined in different ways to produce more complex and varying extended rituals. However, unlike language \(in Staal’s view\), ritual has no “meaning” \(or “function,” “aim,” “goal”\), despite the myriad ways in which the words and actions appear significant on their face, and despite, too, the many meanings and purposes attributed to it by Vedic exegetes past and present.

Carl Seaquist has gone to great lengths to rescue this much maligned aspect of Staal’s theory. Admitting that Staal has not made his case as well as he might have done, Seaquist explains that Staal takes “meaning” only in the sense of lexical meaning or reference and expands Staal’s dictum thus: “‘Meaningless’ means ‘having no aim or goal \(besides itself\).’”13 Actually, Staal’s theory makes a much bolder claim. He hypothesizes that ritual syntax is the origin of language itself and predates linguistic meaning: it is structure for structure’s sake. As evidence, he points to \(seemingly\) arbitrary actions and nonsense utterances—the *stobha*s and *bīja*s of *śrauta* and tantric ritual, respectively—that are deployed so meticulously and systematically. He concedes that some mantras consist of intelligible Sanskrit phrases, but in his view these “mantras-couched-in-language” are “not used for the expression of meaning”; they are “vestigial,” like legs used as fins, “remnants of something that preceded language.”14 On the other hand, like anything else, rituals can have any meaning imposed on them as a secondary matter, as happens prolifically in the Vedic *brāhmaṇa* exegeses, which Staal says \(in an echo of Max Müller’s “theological twaddle”\) “can often be shown to be failures” in interpretation.15

Staal’s linguistic analogy is not inappropriate, however. The meaninglessness thesis got off on the wrong foot by insisting on a comparison between the structure of a single fully codified liturgy-based ritual \(the *śrauta* Vedic system\) and natural language. Humphrey and Laidlaw get to the heart of the matter when then emphasize the tendency for ritualized action \(especially in liturgy-centered ritual\) to be “stipulated” to a high degree. Ritual actions \(including ritual utterances\) are stipulated too in much the same way that the language of a poem or the sounds produced in a \(non-improvisational\) musical composition are stipulated. \(Humphrey and Laidlaw’s performance-centered ritual is more like jazz.\)

The asymmetry of Staal’s comparison lies in the fact that while speakers use the syntactical patterns of language to produce new meaningful expressions, the *agnicayana* rite and Vedic mantras are the same every time they are performed.16 If a new performance deviates from the model in any impermissible way, it will be deemed either a failed performance or no performance at all.17 Vedic ritual, in fact, provides ritual remedies for such lapses: a general reparative rite called “the purifier” \(*pavitra*\) and individual expiatory measures called *prāyaścitti*s. The examples discussed below show Vedic expert ritualists saying new things with Vedic ritual syntax, including new “vocabulary” that may adopt “loan words” and even ritual “calques” from another system.

This is not the place to enter a lengthy discussion on what Staal meant by the “meaninglessness” of Vedic ritual, something that even his defenders agree he did not explain adequately. The claim was motivated in part by his observation that contemporary Vaidikas affirm that understanding what the mantras or acts mean \(or refer to\) is irrelevant to the correctness, or efficacy, of a performance—the performers may indeed be ignorant of anything except correct pronunciation and correct ritual activity. Staal was also building on the Mīmāṃsā doctrine, which asserted the self-validating authority of the Vedas and viewed the ritual as an end in itself \(even asserting that the gods named as recipients of offerings had no existence beyond their being named in the performance\). The Mīmāṃsakas themselves attribute to the ancient sage Kautsa the claim that “Vedic mantras are meaningless” \(*anarthakā mantrāḥ*; for a larger discussion, see *Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra* 1.2.31–39\).18 Finally, his claim presupposes his hypothesis that language itself is a development from an older proto-ritual syntax connected with other patterned forms of behavior such as birdsong; in this case, referential, linguistic meaning could be seen as a novel outgrowth of linguistic syntax.19

However, it is indisputable that the ritual words and actions are in the vast majority of cases not perfectly arbitrary but are assigned their places on the basis of lexical meaning \(if not of the whole of the mantra, at least of some word in it\) and the mimetic or dramatic value of ritual acts. Even if we grant that Vedic ritual performances were not intended to advance propositions or to facilitate communication \(even with divinities, who are verbally addressed\), and that the semantics may be irrelevant in any given performance of a fixed ritual, we would still wish to acknowledge the “illocutionary force” of such performances: they were and are performed for intended purposes, including but not limited to the aim of successfully accomplishing the ritual itself.20 In most cases, the illocutionary force of the ritual act is discernably connected with its locutionary form; for example, the illocutionary act of purifying an implement for use in worship is reflected in the sprinkling of water \(used commonly in cleansing\) and the recitation of a mantra invoking the water to cleanse. This connection should be acknowledged even if a particular performer in a particular case may be ignorant of part or all of these semantic aspects of the act, and even if he recognizes them as irrelevant to the putative efficacy or perlocutionary forces \(real or imagined\) of the ritual act.

In any case, the illocutionary considerations drive the innovations in the *gṛhya* Vedic domain. The formulators of the rites discussed later explicitly acknowledge intentions underlying such acts and the way such intentions determine the appropriateness of a given act or the use of a given mantra or implement. Moreover, the syntax itself implies meaning. Particular Vedic rituals are identifiable—“individuated,” to use Israel Scheffler’s terms21—by the main offerings and their mantras, which are embedded as the “insertion” \(*āvāpa*\) into a common template \(*tantra*\). The repertoire of possible variations was canonically fixed in certain authoritative works, and in this sense not like “natural language,” yet despite this the syntax remains linguistically productive over time through canonical extensions and transfers between Brahmanical traditions. So it comes about that in Śaiva tantras a “liberating initiation” \(*nirvāṇa dīkṣā*\) gets inserted into the middle of the Vedic funeral. Richard Davis points out here that

embedding is not simply the meaningless structuring device that Staal makes of it. The embedded initiation becomes the dominant rite of cremation and reduces the Vedic portions to a subordinate role. In other words, it shifts the entire focus of the ritual, and in so doing brings cremation into accord with the Saiva notion of death as the last door to liberation.22

It will be clear from the following discussion that in the later phases of the *gṛhya* system, embedding—and a more complex process that I call “interleaving”23—are employed creatively to integrate *pūjā*-type rites into a palpably Vedic framework. In order to lay bare the interleaving process involved here, I begin with a brief sketch of the *gṛhya homa*, focusing on the Baudhāyana format. This will be followed by some observations on Vedic modes of offering without placing the oblation in fire. I suggest that the latter rites provide a precedent for later *pūjā*-style rites integrated into the system.



## THE BASIC FORMAT OF THE *HOMA*

General rules found in several *gṛhya* ritual manuals \(*Gṛhyasūtra*s\) specify several ways in which a *homa* employing a cooked offering \(*pākayajña*\) can be distinguished from a *śrauta* offering. The *Vārāha* opens with a definition of the *pākayajña*s: they are offered in the domestic fire;24 they follow the model of the *śrauta* new-and-full-moon service,25 omitting the fore-offerings and after-offerings, the “offerings to the wives of the gods,” and the “kindling-verse offerings” \(*sāmidhenī*\). On the other hand, *Jaimini* 1.1 suggests that they may optionally follow a format of their own \(*darśapūrṇamāsatantrāḥ svatantrā vā*\).

The mantras accompanying the actual oblations conclude with the exclamation *svāhā* \(*Vārāha-Gṛhyasūtra* \[VGS\] 1.2–5\). At most, one priest is to be employed, the *brahman*, while the householder himself performs the function of the *hotṛ*.26 \(The daily evening and morning offerings dispense even with the *brahman* priest.\)

The *Mānava-Gṛhyasūtra* makes some general observations about the general features of and occasions for Vedic domestic ceremonies:

In the case of groups \[of rites \(?\)\] a simple grass strew,27 the fire, the *āgāra*s, *ājyabhāga*s, *āhuti*s, and the *sviṣṭakṛt* \[are the common elements\].28

In the annual \[and\] fortnightly rites, \[and\] in the worship preceding harnessing, circling \[the field\], sowing, and harvesting, the furrow-worship, the threshing-floor worship, the sacrificial tether worship, and the draft ox worship, he worships the deities Agni, Indra, Soma, Sītā, Savitṛ, the twin Aśvins, Anumatī, Revatī, Rākā, Pūṣan, and Rudra.

He worships Varuṇa in rites at rivers, pools, wells, and tanks; \[he worships\] Soma in rites involving plants and trees; \[he worships\] Agni in \[all\] rites whose deity is not prescribed.29

This list begins by enumerating distinctive features of Vedic fire offerings that should be present in *gṛhya*. In listing the occasions for such performances, it begins with the major rituals of the *śrauta* calendar but then turns to ceremonies closely connected with agricultural and pastoral life. The list of deities to be honored similarly begins with the *śrauta* divine triumvirate—Agni \(the fire\), Indra \(the hero\), and Soma \(the drink of divine power\)—but most of the remaining deities named are mainly more involved with day-to-day concerns \(farming and other productive enterprises, illness and healing, wealth and blessings\). While Agni is designated as the default recipient of offerings, Varuṇa and Soma take pride of place in rites associated with water bodies and plants, what we would probably today call folk practices. Domestic rites of these types are sprinkled throughout the domestic ritual codes; while some of these seem to include a fire offering, many others do not \(or may do so only optionally\).

Several of the *Gṛhyasūtra*s outline a standard format for all rites of the one-fire *homa* type, generally speaking a reduced version of the *iṣṭi* service in the multiple-fire *śrauta* system. Generally, it is described within the context of the first sacrament, whether of marriage or the initiation into Veda study. The *Hiraṇyakeśin* designates it an “offering made with a ladle” \(*darvihoma*, 1.2.18\), a name otherwise applied to a simplified *śrauta* offering such as the twice-daily *agnihotra*.30

While the structure of the *homa* can vary in detail, that of the *Baudhāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* \(*BGS*\) is typical. It comprises a sequence of preparatory acts, the offerings proper, and a set of concluding acts. The preparatory acts include: marking out the place of worship \(*devayajanollekhana*\); bringing forward the fire \(*agnipraṇayana*\), installing it, and venerating it \(*agnyupasthāna*\); cooking a pot of milk-rice \(*sthālīpāka-śrapaṇa*\); sweeping together the embers \(*samūhana*\); bringing forward the pot of holy water \(*praṇītāpraṇayana*\); and further preparations of the fire \(strewing grass around it, enclosing it with sticks, sprinkling it\) and of the vessels and offering materials \(washing and sprinkling the vessels, taking out portions of grain or clarified butter\).

The series of offerings broadly follows the *śrauta* sequence, but omitting the fore- and after-offerings \(*prayāja*s and *anuyāja*s\) and recitation of the kindling verses \(*sāmidhenī*s\). The *gṛhya homa* may optionally retain the ghee libations \(*āghārau*\), and the two ghee portions for Agni and Soma \(*ājyabhāgau*\), poured in the northeast and southeast parts of the fire. Just before the main offering, *Baudhāyana* inserts a set of offerings called “Agni’s mouth” \(*agnimukha; BGS* 1.3.33–39\), by which Agni and other divine powers are conciliated; other traditions \(e.g., *Mānava*\) call these the *āhuti*s. The mantras prescribed vary depending on the branch of the Veda to which the *sūtra* belongs.

At this point, the main offering is inserted, followed by a long series of mantras and offerings called “victory” \(*jaya*\), “aiming” \(*abhyātāna*\), and “bearing rule” \(*rāṣṭrabhṛt*\) \(*Taittirīya-Saṃhitā* \[*TS*\] 3.4.4, 5, and 7, totaling forty-three *svāhā*s\), closing with the offering to Agni “who accomplishes the offering well” \(*sviṣṭakṛt*\).31 Finally, the grass “purifier” is thrown on the fire, which is fed and venerated again; the vessels are wiped clean, and the priest is offered an honorarium \(in the *varadāna* rite\). Although much simpler than its *śrauta* counterpart, it is basic to the *gṛhya* system that the *homa* is equally efficacious.



## FIRELESS RITES IN THE DOMESTIC SPHERE

The challenge of the late Vedic tradition was not simply to show that the one-fire ritual could be as effective as a multiple-fire service, but to show how practices that required no fire at all were connected to the Veda in any way. There is no complete agreement as to what properly belongs to the sphere of *gṛhya* \(domestic\) ceremony. In the main, the rites of the *gṛhya* sphere comprise those performed by an individual on his own behalf, with the assistance of a single Brahmin priest or no priest at all. There are fire-worship rites that partly parallel the more elaborate *śrauta* performances but which may be accomplished by the householder himself, with perhaps one priest to assist him; there are the so-called life-cycle rites \(the *saṃskāra*s\); there are other consecrations and blessings of domestic objects or persons in certain circumstances \(such as going on a journey\); there are other offerings to chthonic deities and spirits that are not placed in the fire; and, of course, there is more besides, which makes the “*gṛhya*” or, later, “*smārta*,” a virtual catch-all category.

In fact, unlike the codes of the *śrauta* system, the *gṛhya* canon was very slow to close, and there was a tendency to integrate new rites into it over the course of several centuries, particularly through the accretion of supplements \(*pariśiṣṭa*s\) to the known *sūtra*s, or, in the unique case of the Vaikhānasa school, through the later redaction of the *Gṛhyasūtra* as a whole. In later stages of the elaboration of the *gṛhya* system \(especially in *pariśiṣṭa*s\), a broader range of performances, including image worship of Rudra, Viṣṇu, and Gaṇeśa and votive acts, get rubricated, drawing for precedents on older fireless ritual acts that had an indisputably Vedic pedigree.



## RITES OF ATTENDANCE ON A DEITY: *UPASTHĀNA*

Here and there we find mention of rites of attendance on a deity \(*upasthāna*\) in a sacred locale. For example, *Vārāha-Gṛhyasūtra* 15 describes the *upasthāna* of Rudra residing in a shrine \(*caitya*\), in a tree, at a crossroads, on a cremation ground, or in a pot. The main activity in this instance is recitation \(*japa*\).

The very opening of the *Āśvalāyana*, in distinguishing the *pākayajña*s from the *śrauta* \(*vaitānika*\) ritual, cites three lines from the *Ṛg-Veda* that are made to serve as warrants for three types of simple offering: that “offered \[in fire\]” \(*huta*\), that “proffered \[as *bali*\]” \(*prahuta*\), and that “offered in a Brahmin \[as food\]” \(*brahmaṇi huta*\). It then goes on to prove that mantras signifying an offering can be as good as \(and thus can be substituted for\) the offering itself. The formula *namaḥ* plus the recipient’s name in the dative case marks the accomplishment of such offerings:

Furthermore, they quote the *Ṛg-Veda*: “The mortal who, with a fuel-stick, with an oblation, with knowledge \(*véda*\), worships the fire, who makes good sacrifices with homage …” \(*ṚV* 8.19.5\). … And “who makes good sacrifices with homage” means: even with the expression of homage alone \(*namaskāreṇa vai khalv api*\). The gods are not beyond the expression of homage \(*namaskāram ati*\). Homage *is* worship \(*yajña*\). Thus says a *brāhmaṇa*.32

This rare example of *Brāhmaṇa-*style exegesis in a *Gṛhyasūtra* explicitly justifies on principle the validity of worship that relies mainly on recitation and gestures of obeisance.



### *Fireless Food Offerings:* Balihara*ṇ*a

The Vedic tradition also had from the beginning a form of food offering that did not necessarily require a fire. Offerings of scattered food could occur on their own or they might accompany a *homa* performance. *Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* 1.12 prescribes the offering of morsels of food \(*piṇḍa*\) at a shrine \(*caitya*\) “prior to the *sviṣṭakṛt*” and thus within the larger context of a *homa*. The fire offering itself is described there as “fire worship at a shrine” \(*caityayajña\)*.

There are also older precedents for fireless offerings. The beginnings of Rudra and Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa’s rise to importance in the domestic sphere can be discerned on the periphery of the *śrauta* cult. Rudra earlier appeared mainly in the *Atharva-Veda* as a fearsome heavenly archer apt to visit disease upon people and their herds, but when he is identified with Agni he comes to be seen \(e.g., in the *Śvetāśvatara-Upaniṣad*\)33 as the divinity venerated in the *agnicayana* ritual, an elaborate *śrauta* performance in which a giant fire altar in the shape of a bird is constructed of bricks. The *Śatarudriya* litany recited in the *agnicayana* is also prescribed for use in the *traiyambaka* rite,34 which propitiates Rudra as Deva Tryambaka, with his sister\(s?\) Ambikā; it is intended to win protection for the worshiper, health for the herds, and prosperity for the household. A cake for Rudra is deposited on a mole heap, after which remnants of it \(also for Rudra\) are placed on a leaf at a crossroads. After the wife of the rite’s sponsor circles a fire kindled from a coal from the “southern fire,” offering cakes are hung from a tree in baskets.

A related rite to be performed at a crossroads serves as an exorcism for one who has been possessed by a *vināyaka,* a type of mischievous spirit \(later reconceived as the benevolent Gaṇeśa, Śiva-Rudra’s “son” and leader of his hosts\) \(*Mānava-Gṛhyasūtra* 2.14; cf. *Yājñavalkya-Dharmaśāstra* 1.270 ff.\). Ambikā is invoked here too, as well as several other deities associated with Rudra. These and similar rites provide a precedent for offerings in which no fire is used.35 Any food offering that includes a portion of a fire-oblation \(*havis*\) may be treated as *bali*.36

The *Baudh* *āyana* prescribes two types of *bali. BGS* 2.8–9 presents the general type, while another *baliharaṇa* described in *BGS* 1.11 is really a type of funerary rite, the *viṣṇubali*.37 In this case, the rule promises that the *bali*, fed to the sponsor’s wife, will result in the birth of a male child;38 the next *praśna* begins by describing the birth sacrament for a male newborn.39

*Bali* rites are sometimes, though not always, combined with *homa*s. They were performed for a wide variety of divinities, ghosts, and spirits associated with particular locales. The offerings are verbally completed on uttering the word “*namaḥ*.” For all these reasons, the *bali* provided a model for the elaboration of a “Vedic” *pūjā* ritual.



### The Spit-Ox Offering

A special form of *bali* was the “spit-ox offering” \(*śūlagava* or *īśānabali*\)40 dedicated to Rudra, the most prominent of the Vedic deities otherwise omitted from the *śrauta* offerings. Rudra, a celestial archer associated with the mountains and storms, belonged more to the Atharvan sphere, defined by the text of the *Atharva-Veda*, than that of the *Ṛg-Veda*, in which he appears infrequently. Vedic Rudra was especially associated with household affairs and the well-being of people and herds, but he was not a recipient of offerings in the *śrauta* cult. The central ritual acts are the ritual slaughter of a cow \(or optionally a ram or goat\), the offering of the blood, the omentum, and other pieces of meat sprinkled with clarified butter \(ghee\) and roasted on skewers, followed by the sprinkling of the herd with the remaining ghee and dishwater from cleaning the bowl. We may wonder whether the subsuming of it within the *homa* framework was done precisely to make the rite conform to the Vedic fire-ritual model.

The *Mānava* identifies the *śūlagava* as the *gṛhya* equivalent of the *śrauta* animal offering \(*paśuyajña*\):

He who is going to worship \(*yaj-*\) with an animal tends the fire that is tended in *pākayajña*s. The \[service\] dedicated to Rudra in the autumn is the *śūlagava*. Out of sight of the settlement, in the northeasterly direction, the post is cut at night in the midst of cattle. Having filled eight cups of blood prior to the *sviṣṭakṛt*-rite, he should offer them in the directions and intermediate directions while reciting the eight *anuvāka*s that begin “*namas te rudra manyave*” \(“Homage to your wrath, Rudra…,” i.e., the *Śatarudriya* litany\). He should not bring uncooked \[meat\] to the village. The rest he should bury in the ground, as well as the hide. Some say that animals are offered in a *pākayajña* without using a post.41

The most startling option proposed by Baudhāyana, though, is mentioned in the last breath, after the option of sacrificing a ram or a goat: “Or else they cook a pot of rice and milk \(*sthālīpāka*\) for Īśāna; thereby, he does all those things which are to be done with a cow.”42

It is probably not possible to say how ancient this prescription is, but the fact that it has been accepted as belonging to the *Gṛhyasūtra* proper and not relegated at least to the *Paribhāṣā*- or *Pariśiṣṭa-Sūtra* suggests that it may be a relatively early “vegetarian” option prefiguring the substitution by certain Maharasthrian Mādhvas of animal forms shaped from dough \(*piṣṭapaśu*\) or pots of ghee \(*ājyapaśu*\) for the animal victims in *śrauta* rituals in recent centuries \(a practice going back at least 600 years\) and the Kerala innovation of using rice folded into banana leaves for the same purpose.43 Such a radical substitution is not condoned in *śrauta* ritual texts, even later ones such as the *Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana* of Bhāskara Miśra \(eleventh or twelfth centuries\), with its long chapter on substitutions \(*pratinidhi*\), which does however condone the replacement of certain missing parts of the animal by ladles of ghee \(2.68, and 2.58–73 in general\).



### The Vedicization of Image Worship

The organizing impulse was extended in the later phases of the *gṛhya* corpus, where a fully developed rubric for image-based worship was introduced; the *Baudhāyana-Gṛhya- Śeṣasūtra* \(*BGŚS*\) and the *Vaikhānasa-Gṛhyasūtra* are the major examples of this. But while the Vaikhānasa liturgy was thoroughly and consistently Vaiṣṇavized, the *BGŚS* is characteristically Smārta in that it prescribes rites for both Rudra and Viṣṇu, the major male deities of later Hinduism, as well as for the goddesses Durgā, Upaśruti, Śrī, and Sarasvatī; for Ravi \(the sun\); for Vināyaka \(3.3–6, 8–10\), and for Dhūrta \(Skanda, 4.2\). Eventually the Smārtas settled on a group of five deities as the focus of attention: Rudra/Śiva, Viṣṇu, Sūrya, Gaṇeśa/Vināyaka, and Devī/Śakti,44 sometimes augmented by Skanda; the *BGŚS* records an early stage in the development of this tradition.

*BGŚS* 2.13–15 and 2.16–19 are fully parallel expositions of the installation, worship, and bathing of images of Viṣṇu and Rudra, respectively.45 In many sections, the wording is so parallel that only the names of the deities and the mantras to be recited differ. This pattern can be easily observed in table 1, which shows how a parallel sequence of rites and mantras proper to each of the two deities has been superimposed over a common template based on the *gṛhya homa* ritual.

b Oddly, this stanza invokes Agni as Rudra, and not Viṣṇu.


This parallel presentation achieves four things:

\(1\) it sets the two deities on a par;

\(2\) it identifies them both as forms of *brahman*;

\(3\) it establishes a common, ostensibly Vedic format for the worship in image form, drawing on an already well-recognized repertory of mantras applied in many rituals to accompany particular types of action; and

\(4\) it coordinates the Vedic and Purāṇic traditions by mapping the *pūjā* ceremonies onto a standard *gṛhya homa*; the *homa*, itself embedded in an image ceremony, frames the main *pūjā* service.

The distinct sets of mantras prescribed for use with each deity constitute in effect a liturgy of Vedic passages proper to each god. The mantras selected for this purpose are appropriate mainly because they mention the deity concerned, but it may be noted that in the *śrauta* cult they may be associated with non-fire offerings that are ancillary to the main event. Thus, “Over this Viṣṇu strode; thrice did he set down his foot; \[All\] is gathered in its dust” \(*idaṃ viṣṇur vi cakrame …*\) is recited in the *Soma* sacrifice to sanctify an offering laid on the track beside one of the ritual carts.

Rudra in the *Atharva-Veda* has no connection with the *śrauta* tradition; the *Yajur-Veda* treats him as a form of Agni, the fire deity. While elsewhere in the fire rituals Agni receives various specified shares in the fire offerings, oblations to Rudra are conveyed without fire. The *Śatarudriya* litany \(*TS* 4.5.1–11\) prescribed here by Baudhāyana is elsewhere used in a *śrauta* context to consecrate offerings poured with a leaf on a brick in the northwest portion of the altar constructed during the *agnicayana* ritual. The traditional exegesis emphasizes the notion that Rudra is in a spot appropriate to him: “He offers standing facing north; this is the quarter of Rudra; verily he propitiates him in his own quarter” \(*TS* 5.4.3.3\).46

This systematic parallelism in Baudhāyana’s *pratiṣṭhā* rite is reinforced by *BGŚS* 2.22, which discusses in plain terms the common structure of the ritual process:

Now at the performance of *pūjā* of the two great gods, the offering of a seat, of water for washing the feet, of scented water \(*arghya*\), and of water for *ācamana*, everywhere takes place with \(the recital of\) the two \(verses\), “*trīṇi padā vi cakrame*,” etc. \(“\[Viṣṇu the protector\] took three steps … ,” *Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa* \[*TB*\] 2.4.6.1\), \[or\] “*tryambakaṃ yajāmahe*,” etc. \(“I worship Tryambaka … ,” *TS* 1.8.6.i\), in accordance with the characterizing word.47 And \[the *pūjā*\] of these two \[gods\] is performed because it is the Dharma of the three high classes, because it is ordained in all cases, and because there is no prohibition \[against it\] that is generally known and accepted. Thus spoke Baudhāyana.48

The last part is interesting: it establishes, in Baudhāyana’s name, the injunction to perform the *pūjā* of Viṣṇu and Rudra on the grounds \(1\) that it is part of the Dharma, the pious observances, of Āryas; \(2\) that it is formally prescribed in the rules \(*vacana*\); and \(3\) that no prohibition of it is widely accepted. This rather overdetermined justification suggests, in fact, that there were well-known objections to it, and that there was some question as to whether there was warrant for the *pūjā* of these gods in Vedic practice or texts.



## THE *DHŪRTABALI*

*BGŚS* 4.2 prescribes that a *bali* offering be made to Dhūrta, a minor deity better known as Skanda, who in the late Vedic context was thought to bring \(and thus to be capable of averting\) illness, especially in children. It is said to follow the paradigms of both the *āhuta* and the *baliharaṇa* \(*BGS* 3.7 and 3.9\) because it includes an offering of food before an image \(understanding this act as the *bali*\) as well as oblations in the fire, which are inserted into the middle of the rite prior to the bathing of the image. By the choice of mantra, moreover, the ritual bathing of the image is homologized with the Vedic bath undergone by a sacrificer at the conclusion of the ritual, the *avabhṛtha*. In structure, the various *upacāra*s of a Puraṇic *pūjā* service are interleaved with the major elements of the standard *gṛhya homa* \(see table 2\).


TABLE 2.  
INTERLEAVING OF “VEDIC” AND “PURāNIC” RITUAL ELEMENTS IN THE DHūRTABALI RITE
“Vedic” “Purāṇic”   *devayajanollekhana* \(marking the place of worship, including *sthaṇḍila*\) erection of a leafy branch and an image of Dhūrtasvāmin on the *sthaṇḍila* \(sacrificial ground\), intertwined in a sacred thread: ‘The sacred thread is the best purifier…’ *BGS* 2.5   *homa* up to *agniparidhāna* and *agnipariṣecana*, with disciples touching from behind anointing pieces of wood and putting it on fire with *ṚV* 1.94.1–3, 14; and 6.16.11= *TS* 2.5.8.1 \(bec.it mentions Angiras, a name identified with Dhūrta here, 57:13\)    *āghārau*    *agnimukha*     dancing thrice around the fire, invoking Dhūrta, with a Purāṇic mantra; image seated on *kuśa* grass; presenting *arghya*-water mixed with flowers, fruit, barley corns in a cup covered with a golden lid; *snāpana* \(bathing the image with Vedic mantras for *avabhṛtha*, the performer’s bath at the end of the ritual\)   *sυiṣṭakṛt*     scent, flowers, incense, lamp, fruit, water *namaskāra*, with promise to offer rice if prayer is answereda

a This sort of vow is called in Marathi *navas*, a term derived from *namas* in Sanskrit.




## CONCLUSION

These examples from the latest stratum of the Baudhāyana *gṛhya* canon exhibit the priestly authors’ ongoing fluency in the syntax of Vedic ritual, as well as the plasticity of that syntax in adapting to a diversifying ritual “discourse.” These adaptations and rephrasings of the *gṛhya* Vedic ritual syntax only make sense if we take its meaningfulness into account. Even Staal once conceded that his “meaninglessness of ritual” hypothesis applied best to the *śrauta* Vedic ritual.49 The peculiarity of ritual action and ritual speech that Staal called “meaningless” has been better explained as a potential but by no means the intrinsic tendency for the significance of individual ritual elements, or even of whole rites, to fade into the background, even to be forgotten, when the performance becomes an end in itself, as it can be for some ritualists. This is an extreme case of the putative efficacy of a rite *ex opere operato*—its illocutionary force—to crowd out all other significance.

But this clearly was not the case for the priestly authors of the ritual codes. They knew what they meant by the ritual words and acts, and they knew how to deploy the syntax to “say” and do new things. This is how the extended Baudhāyana domestic canon came to integrate Purāṇic rites and ritual terminology into the Vedic framework by assimilating the food offerings to the well-known Vedic *bali*, by culling from the old mantra collections those stanzas that pertained to Rudra and Viṣṇu for use in the *pūjā* ritual, and by inserting the *pūjā*-type acts of ritual service \(*upacāra*\) into a standard fire sacrifice. In the case of the *dhūrtabali*, the divine image was located in front of the ritual fire so that they could be circumambulated together.

By these means, and through the analogous use of elements of the Vedic appeasement \(*śānti*\) rituals as demonstrated by Geslani, the large class of ritual texts falling within the penumbra of the Vedic literature established patterns of claiming and demonstrating the legitimacy of Brahmanical orthopraxy that were adopted by the Smārtas seeking to establish the image worship of the Smārta Hindu deities on a Vedic basis \(as is the case with *BGŚS*\), as well as, especially later, by early sectarian movements like the Pāśupatas,50 Pāñcarātras, and Vaikhānasas.51 The latter groups, oriented exclusively to Rudra-Śiva or to Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, would use the same principles to demonstrate Vedic warrant for—or at least harmony with—Purāṇic or Āgamic theology.52 In the Smārta case, this amounted to a sort of tacit ritual eclecticism, one that never acknowledged the “otherness” of the rites being thus appropriated. The sectarian movements tended to be more open in their efforts to demonstrate the compatibility of Vedic and Purāṇic or Āgamic practices.

If this would seem to subordinate the image cult to the fire cult, this was only the thin end of the wedge. While initially \(as here\) the elements of image *pūjā* were inserted into the framing structure of a *homa*, eventually the frame–insertion relationship would be reversed, and the *homa* would become an optional and clearly circumscribed element in Hindu *pūjā* services.



## NOTES

[^1]: The examples discussed here were presented earlier in papers at the 2006 meeting of the American Academy of Religion and at the 4th International Vedic Workshop, Austin, Texas, 2007. I gratefully acknowledge the support of a Fulbright-Hays FRA fellowship and a National Endowment for the Humanities sabbatical fellowship. An early draft was prepared while in residence at the Institut français de Pondichéry.

[^2]: There is a thread of exegesis that takes *pākayajña* to mean “simple worship,” as if it contained the word *pā́ka*, “simple” \(etymology contested\) as its first element, rather than *pāká,* “cooked food” \(&lt; *pac-, pacati*, “cook”\). Thus, *brāhmaṇa* passages in the *Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā* \(*KS*\) 36.9:76.13, the *Taittirīya-Saṃhitā* \(*TS*\) 1.7.1, and the *Mādhyandina Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa* \(*ŚBM*\), 1.7.4.19, 1.8.1.18, and 43–44, represent a *pākayajñá* as a “household sacrifice” \(*gṛhamedha, KS*\) lacking the fore-offerings and after-offerings of a full *śrauta yajña* \(*KS, TS*\), and identifying it with the *iḍā* offering, which is called the “weakest part” \(*taniṣṭha*\) of the sacrifice \(*ŚBM* 1.8.1.18\). Even more explicit is the *Vārāha-Gṛhyasūtra* \(1.2–4\): *hrasvatvāt pākayajñaḥ | hrasvaṃ hi pāka ityācakṣate | darśapūrṇamāsaprakṛtiḥ pākayajñavidhir aprayājo ‘nanuyājo ‘sāmidhenīkaḥ |* “\[It is called\] ‘*pāka* worship’ because of its brevity. For what is brief is known as ‘*pāka.*’ The rule for simple worship follows the paradigm for the new- and full-moon rites, omitting the preliminary offerings, closing offerings, and kindling recitation.” *Gobhila-Gṛhyasūtra* \(1.9.8–9\) may imply the meaning “simple worship” when it defines the *pākayajña* as worship performed by the patron acting as his own *hotṛ* priest and employing just a single *brahman* priest. Brian K. Smith, “The Unity of Ritual: The Place of the Domestic Sacrifice in Vedic Ritualism,” *Indo-Iranian Journal* 28 \(1986\): 79–96, endorses the notion that the original meaning of *pāka* in this compound was “simple,” but this is unlikely.

[^23]: Staal \(“Ritual Syntax,” p. 131\), citing a letter from Jan Heesterman, acknowledged that an embedded rite may be interrupted by segments of the rite in which it is embedded. An extended form of this is “interleaving.”

[^24]: The *Khādira* states that “any offering made in a single fire is called ‘*pākayajña*’” \(*pākayajña ity ākhyā yaḥ kaś caikāgnau*, 1.1.20\). This single ritual fire is generally said to be the same as the one used in the wedding ceremony performed for the incipient householder, though the *Baudhāyana* prescribes that the fire used in the future ritualist’s initiation into Veda study should become his ritual fire. It is designated by various names in different sources \(*gṛhya, āvasathya*\), but it is to be distinguished from the ordinary kitchen fire \(the *laukika*, “secular,” or *pacana*, “cooking,” fire\). To convert the rite into an act of sorcery, the offering may instead be made in the *śālāgni*, or in the southern fire in the case of one who has laid the *śrauta* fires \(*Vārāha-Gṛhyasūtra* 1.6\). *Baudhāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* quotes an ostensibly general view that the use of iron ladles serves the same purpose.

[^45]: For the relationship between the various strata of the Baudhāyana *gṛhya* canon, Willem Caland’s *Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana* \(Leipzig: F. A. Brockhaus, 1903\) remains the authority. Pieter Harting made a study of the installation rites discussed here in *Selections from the Baudhāyana-Gṛhyapariśiṣṭasūtra* \(Amersfoort: J. Valkhoff & Co, 1922\).

[^46]: All translations from the *Taittirīya-Saṃhitā* are from Arthur B. Keith, *The Veda of the Black Yajus School Entitled Taittiriya Sanhita* \(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1914\).

[^49]: Staal writes, “As for rites, it is especially rites of the śrauta ritual that seem to be devoid of meaning or functions. Rites of the gṛhya or ‘domestic’ ritual, on the other hand, seem often quite meaningful and functional” \(“Mantras and Bird Songs,” p. 553\). He does not explain why this should be the case, given the similarities between the two systems, simply noting that *gṛhya* rites are more attuned to practical concerns.

[^50]: The *Atharvaśiras* and the *Nīlarudra* represent examples of Vedic liturgies for Rudra as supreme deity \(Timothy Lubin, “The *Nīlarudropaniṣad* and the *Paippalādasaṃhitā*: A Critical Edition and Translation of the Upaniṣad and Nārāyaṇa’s *Dīpikā*,” in Arlo Griffiths and Annette Schmiedchen, eds., *The Atharvaveda and its Paippalāda Śākhā: Historical and Philological Papers on a Vedic Tradition* \[Aachen: Shaker Verlag, 2007\], pp. 81–139; and *Atharvaśiras: Historical Study, Critical Edition, and Translation* \[Leiden: Brill, forthcoming\]\).

Bhatt Felicitation Volume* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1994\), pp. 511–525, identifies connections between Vaiṣṇava Tantric liturgy and the prescriptions found in the *BGŚS*.
