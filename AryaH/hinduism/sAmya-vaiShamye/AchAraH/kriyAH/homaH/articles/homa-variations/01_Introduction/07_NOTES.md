[^1]: Discerning such idiosyncrasies from longer term patterns is consistent with Rappaport’s distinction between canonic and indexical. See Roy A. Rappaport, *Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999\), p. 54.

[^2]: To the best of my knowledge, the only other work that considers similar temporal and cultural scope in its study of a ritual is found in Michael Stausberg, ed., *Zoroastrian Rituals in Context* \(Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2004\).

[^3]: Even in an adaptation of the homa made by Yogi Chen in which the main deity is Jesus, the first of the two sets of offerings being made are for Agni. See “A Ritual of Fire Sacrifice to the Five Saints of Christianity,” *A Systematized Collection of Chenian Booklets, Nos. 1—100*, no. 122, [http://www.yogichen.org/cw/cw40/bk122.html](http://www.yogichen.org/cw/cw40/bk122.html).

[^4]: In Japan, e.g., sesame oil \(*goma abura* 胡麻油\) is substituted for *ghee*. Until the modern era, Japan did not have a dairy culture that could have provided *ghee*. Despite its potential availability now, however, practitioners continue to use sesame oil.

[^9]: The only comparable ritual in terms of both duration and variety of cultural locations would seem to be the initiatory practice known as *abhiṣeka*. See, e.g., Ronald M.

[^17]: We are here purposely avoiding suggestions about how to understand or define the ends sought, whether practical, social, spiritual or any other characterization. Nor are we suggesting any determination about the epistemologically most appropriate perspective from which to evaluate or describe those ends, broadly either emic or etic. And further, we are making no determinations regarding the best way to judge the efficacy of ritual in the accomplishment of those ends. In order to avoid prematurely foreclosing directions of inquiry, we are here bracketing off those questions, while at the same time wanting to acknowledge their relevance and importance for the general project of ritual studies.

[^28]: As a field of academic specialization, religious studies developed out of both comparative theology and the education of Christian missionaries. As a consequence, though often simply taken for granted and therefore not made explicit, themes of Christian triumphalism informed the field, and to a large extent continue to give structure by defining the issues addressed in religious studies.

[^29]: This should not to be confused with Frits Staal’s theoretical argument regarding the meaninglessness of ritual, which is a different thing entirely.

One might also, of course, mention Freud in this regard as well, who, although not in the line of religious studies scholars with whom Brosius and Hüsken are concerned, was perhaps more influential in the formation of popular conceptions of ritual as a meaningless and compulsive reenactment symbolic of some other traumatic experience that could not be integrated into conscious awareness.

[^37]: The struggle to define religious studies as a social science separate from theology is a long-standing one. Indeed some scholars have recently declared it to be futile on the grounds that the field of religious studies is necessarily grounded in theology.

[^38]: The contrast with the academic study of ritual in French research is instructive in this regard. French religious culture, with its Catholic, and specifically counter-Reformation heritage has generally had a more positive approach to ritual—apparently reflective of a more positive understanding of the sacraments.

[^39]: Brosius and Hüsken, *Ritual Matters*, p. 3. For myself, David I. Kertzer’s *Ritual, Politics and Power* \(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989\), which examined political and social power relations from the perspective of ritual performance, was pivotal in reorienting the concept of ritual from a set of activities within the larger category of religion to a separate, though overlapping, category.

[^45]: Although sometimes used synonymously, by historicality I am not referring here to the problems identified by the term “historicity,” which in religious studies often seem to have to do with questions of factual historical existence, apparently largely motivated by theological concerns regarding the historical existence of Jesus.

[^49]: It is worthy of note, however, that Liénard and Boyer reference some of Rappaport’s older works and do not cite his 1999 publication, *Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999\), in which he qualifies “invariant,” using the phrase “relatively invariant,” pp. 30, and 35.

[^53]: The literature on Freud and ritual, as well as Freudian theories of ritual is extensive. For an overview, see Bell, *Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions*, pp. 12–16. Rather than an expression of an unconscious motivation, ritualization is often employed purposely. Bell notes several instances in which “invariant practice is meant to evoke disciplined control for purposes of self-cultivation” \(p. 151\).

[^54]: Liénard and Boyer, “Whence Collective Rituals?” p. 819. Although originally given as a parenthetical, the qualification “clearly different” is emphasized here to clarify the difference between \(a\) Liénard and Boyer’s treatment of the relation between ritual and the three examples they consider \(children’s rituals, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and life-stage-relevant intrusive thoughts\) as a fruitful analogy, and \(b\) Freud’s treatment of the two, which is easily understood as an explanatory identity.

[^55]: One of the limiting factors for Reformation era studies of ritual change, however, is that to a large extent they assume that it is changes in theology, broadly defined, that lead to changes in ritual. While noting that recent theoretical orientations have changed the field, Miri Rubin notes, e.g., that “discussions of the eucharist have usually taken place within studies of theology and canon law, in worlds of ecclesiastical history” \(*Corpus Christi: The Eucharist in Late Medieval Culture* \[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991\], p. 4\).

[^68]: On the basis of existing scholarship, we have pointed to the images of modern versus traditional that played a role in the expansion of colonialism in the nineteenth century. Speculatively, given the similarity of interpretation and the synchronicity of events, one wonders in this regard whether the mindless repetition of meaningless actions imposed on the working class by the rise of industrialization was not in the background of those members of the social elites who maintained and promoted the view of ritual as just such a practice?

[^101]: In his *The Enlightenment of Vairocana* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1992\), chapter 14 “Study of the Homa chapter” \(pp. 189–208\), Alex Wayman studied this section in detail and was able to expand on its significance. He was able to do so, however, only with extensive examination not only of Buddhaguhya’s commentary, but several ancillary texts as well. Despite the thorough-going nature of his research, many of the explanations he gives remain speculative, some more highly so than others. Perhaps the most important question—Why does the text include this lengthy set of different fires?—remains unaddressed. Such difficulties are, of course, not unusual for scholarly work and seem to increase with distance in time and culture. What is relevant here, though, is that the understanding of the texts that record the history of rituals goes far beyond translation per se. In a sense, this is nothing more than the truism that “context matters.” However, there are theoretical issues involved in determining what the appropriate context actually is. Without such a theoretical basis the conceptual danger is that similarities and associations alone are not explanatory, especially when they are linked in an extended sequence. See, e.g., Wayman’s learned discussion of *kṣayāgni*, the “Transient Fire” \(pp. 196–197\), which links together transiency with “being lean” through the Tibetan rendering in the *Amarakoṣa*, and then further with the lean character of lightning, which in turn leads to a possible association between Agni Pāvaka and Agni Mātariśvan, and the latter’s possible association with metallurgy, and therefore with Hephaestus. One has the feeling here that by knowing so much more, we in fact wind up knowing less.

[^103]: This approach follows the line of argumentation Samuel raises in relation to the description of the *maṇḍala* of the *Suvarṇaprabhāsasūta*, which he is “pretty sure … reflects some kind of practice in which the four Buddhas were visualized and invoked, but precisely how and in what way remains obscure.” Samuel, “The Writing,” p. 308.

[^111]: I am using the term “sectarian” here not to denote the category of heretical separatism that it usually refers to in Christian usage, which has long tended to give primacy to church institutions and doctrinal orthodoxy in its own historiography. Rather, it is here used in accord with Axel Michaels’s usage, which is closer to “lineage” than to “church,” and therefore more appropriate to the Indian context. Michaels notes that “in the Indian context, the word *sect* does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by a founder, with ascetic practices. In India, there are various words for *sect: pantha* \(“way”\), *saṃpradāya* \(“tradition”\), *saṅga* \(“community”\), or *samāj* \(“society”\). Thus, Indian sects do not focus on heresy, since the lack of a center or a compulsory authority makes that impossible—instead, the focus is on adherents and followers. Therefore, if the term *sect* is derived from the Latin *sequi* \(“accompany, follow, pursue”\) instead of the Latin *secare* \(“cut, separate”\), it is acceptable.” Axel Michaels, *Hinduism: Past and Present*, translated by Barbara Harshav \(Princeton, NJ, and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2004\), p. 319. Similar points have also been made by both Mark Juergensmeyer and Frits Staal regarding the use of “religion” in relation to India.

[^112]: It also produces such distorting generalizations as the conception of “Hinduism” as a unitary religion, when traditionally adherents considered themselves followers of Viṣnu, or Śīva, or Śakti—distinct traditions in their own right, not simply parts of a single, more comprehensive whole. Much the same effect is found in terms of “Buddhism” as well. See Brian K. Pennington, *Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion* \(Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2007\); Peter Gottschalk, *Religion, Science, and Empire: Classifying Hinduism and Islam in British India* \(Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2013\); Tomoko Masuzawa, *The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism* \(Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2005\); Urs App, *The Birth of Orientalism* \(Philadelphia and Oxford: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010\).

[^116]: *Soma* is the ritual drink offered into the fires for the gods. Arguments attempting to establish its nature have differed, creating scholarly debate for several decades. One theory, argued for by Gordon Wasson, is that it is extracted from the fly agaric mushroom \(*amanita muscaria*\), a mushroom with a bright red cap and white spots, familiar to some readers as the dancing mushrooms in Walt Disney’s *Fantasia*. Despite the appeal of this theory, particularly to those researchers such as myself who grew up with both *Fantasia* and the late 1960s drug culture, it is generally no longer considered a viable theory as to the identity of the Vedic *soma*.
