IN OCTOBER 2010 a conference entitled “Homa Variations: From Vedic to Hindu and Buddhist” was held at Harvard University. For three days, a dozen scholars presented their work as it relates to the *homa* ritual. Over the course of that time, about two dozen others were in attendance as well. One of the high points of the conference was the performance of a Newari *homa* by Naresh Bajracharya, one of the conference participants. Following the conference, additional papers were solicited to provide greater depth to this collection.
