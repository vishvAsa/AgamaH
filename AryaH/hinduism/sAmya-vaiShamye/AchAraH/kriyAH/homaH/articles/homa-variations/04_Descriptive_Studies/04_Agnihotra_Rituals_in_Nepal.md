TODAY FIVE GROUPS of brahmins reside in the Kathmandu Valley:[^1] the Newari-speaking Rājopādhyāya; the Nepali-speaking Pūrbe, who immigrated in the last centuries before the Gorkha conquest \(1768–1769 C.E.\), the Kumaĩ; the Newari- and Maithili-speaking Maithila; and the Bhaṭṭas from South India, who serve at the Paśupatināth temple. Except for the Bhaṭṭas, all are followers of the *White Yajurveda* in its Mādhyandina recension. It could therefore be expected that all these groups, with the exception of the Bhaṭṭas, would differ from each other in language and certain customs brought from their respective homelands, but that they would agree in their \(Vedic\) ritual. However, this is far from the case. On the contrary, the brahmins of the Kathmandu Valley, who have immigrated over the last 1,500 years in several waves,2 constitute a perfect example of individual regional developments in this border area of medieval Indian culture, as well as of the successive, if fluctuating, influence of the “great tradition” of Northern India.

Just one aspect of this far-reaching issue will be studied here in some detail,3 the various forms of the more important Vedic rituals carried out to the present day: the daily *agnihotra* and the rituals connected with it, such as the fortnightly new and full moon sacrifice \(*darśapūrṇamāsa*\) and some related seasonal rituals.



## 1. ON THE HISTORY OF THE *AGNIHOTRA* IN NEPAL

1.1. The *agnihotra*, “the casting \(of cow’s milk\) into the fire,” while a comparatively uncomplicated Vedic sacrifice, nevertheless requires around a hundred individual actions.4 It is to be performed at sunset every night and at sunrise in the morning by all initiated brahmins who have installed the three holy fires \(*ahitāgni*\). Its original purpose was as a sun spell:[^5] in the evening, the power of the sun enters into the embers of the fire, from where it has to be rekindled the following morning. The underlying identification of sun and fire is very old, in any case already Indo-Iranian, as shown by the fire worship of the Zoroastrians. This is already seen in the *Yasna Haptaŋhāiti*, composed in quasi-Zarathustrian Old Avestan.6

In early Indian history the *agnihotra* became a popular topic of discussion. The time of the morning offering \(before, during, and after sunrise\) was especially controversial; in the *Upaniṣad*s, even *kṣatriya*s offered their opinions on this matter, and in the following centuries the *agnihotra* \(just like the *aśvamedha*\) remained a constantly used, standard example of Vedic ritual in texts such as the *Mahābhārata.* During these times, not every initiated brahmin carried out the rite. On the other hand, it grew in importance to becoming one that a king must constantly perform with the help of his priest, the *rāja-purohita.* According to the *Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa*, a collection of texts whose early sections may have been composed in the centuries before the beginning of our era, the priest must always be an Atharvavedin.7 The first late- and post-Vedic descriptions of the *agnihotra* and other rites of the royal court, which were intended to serve the interests of the king and the country, are found in this text. However, the Atharvavedins were mostly not able to enforce this claim[^8] and therefore the royal priests in Nepal, too, have been \(as far we know of their school affiliation\) Mādhyandinas of the *White Yajurveda* \(besides the *śaivācārya*s\).

1.2. Unfortunately, the *agnihotra* is not mentioned in early Nepalese inscriptions and texts, but we know that brahmins settled in Kathmandu Valley as early as the Licchavi period[^9] \(Changu Narayan inscription, 464 C.E.\); perhaps they had settled there already before the Kirāta time or before the so-called Gupta dynasty. At Mātātīrtha, in the west of the valley, they appear in Licchavi inscriptions as “leaders” of villages. They performed, for example, Aṃśuvarman’s *rājābhiṣeka* \(Hāḍigaon inscription, 606 C.E.\) and would have carried out his other royal rites as well, including the *agnihotra*.10 Perhaps the site of this hypothetical *agnihotra* was first at Jhul \(Mātātirtha\) in the west of the valley,11 and later at the southern rim of the \(supposed\) palace of Aṃśuvarman[^12] at Hāḍigaon, where an excavation discovered an *agnikuṇḍa*[^13] next to the Māneśvarī temple. The Kuladevatā \(Māneśvarī of the Malla kings\) and the *agnikuṇḍa* also coincide elsewhere \(see §[^1].3, §[^3] \).

The first source for the history of the Nepalese *agnihotra* \(and at any time new sources may appear,14 such as in the 3,000 unpublished inscriptions of the Malla period[^15]\) is a fragmentary inscription from Bhaktapur along with the manuscripts to be discussed in this essay. It is almost to be expected that this inscription was found in the vicinity of the old palace of Bhaktapur, at Tachapal-Tol in the east of the city. A rule always followed in Nepal \(and elsewhere, for example, in Orissa\) is that brahmins would live south of the palace \(before the transfer of the palace to the northwest of the city\). In this case, it seems to have been the *agnihotrī* of the king. \(Today, brahmins again reside south of the palace, just as in Kathmandu, at Om Bahal.\)

That *agnihotrin*s existed at Bhaktapur at this early time is shown by a legend reported by Munamkarmi.16 Although historically impossible,17 the legend says that the Maithila king Harisiṃha, on his arrival in the Kathmandu Valley \(1324 C.E.\), established the *yantra* of Talejū Bhavānī at Bhaktapur in the house of an *agnihotrī.* Talejū appeared to him in a dream and requested that a particularly distinguished location should be found for her. The king first looked in the eastern part of the city, at Banelaykū, then at Kvāchẽ Tol, and eventually found the house of an *agnihotra* brahmin. According to the brahmin’s wishes the king exchanged the brahmin’s piece of land for another one, and the new place was called Palisachẽ. The legend goes on to relate King Harisiṃha’s expulsion of an *agnihotrī* who is described as a great, accomplished *tantrika.* In Bhaktapur tradition, therefore, the legend of a previous *agnihotra* is alive and well. This may go back to the time of the still undivided kingdom in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. Later, from about 1600 C.E. onward, the *agnihotra* has only been attested at Patan.

1.3. The oldest manuscript known to me of this ritual, the *Yajurvidhāna*[^18] *agnihotra darśapaurṇamāseṣṭi sāyamprātarvidhi/śunasīreṣṭi*, and so on, in thirty-three chapters, dates to about the same time \(1433 C.E.\). Here, the fortnightly *dārśa-paurṇamāsa* –as to keep the local form of the designation*-* is the basic form of the *sāyamprātar agnihotra*, a reversal of the normal procedure in which the two are treated separately. The manuscript is dated in NS 553 *śrāvaṇa* \(= summer of 1433 C.E.\), by \(or for?\) a *soma-śramaṇa*, at Śrī Pitho Bamlānihma Yetā-gṛha.19 In addition, there exist two inscriptions at the *agniśālā* of Patan, one of which is very weathered but nevertheless readable, which indicates a donation for an annual feast for brahmins of all Patan groups \(perhaps already dated 1572 C.E., discussed in §3.1\). Hemrāj Śākya[^20] mentions \(without a source\) a date of 1572 C.E. for this *agniśālā.*

There are additional manuscripts, such as one[^21] dating to NS 701 \(= 1601 C.E.\), of the famous Rājaguru Viśvanāth Śarmā, or V. Upādhya, of Patan, who had thus far been attested only to 1638 C.E. and later.22 This text is a *Dārśapaurṇamāsa-vidhāna* \(according to the *bhāṣya* of the *Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra*\). Further there is an approximately simultaneous *Prasādaṣoḍaśadamanārohaṇayajña*, a *Pavitrārohaṇa*, and so on. In addition, there are also modern, though inaccessible, manuscripts now in use;[^23] they are said to go back to a copy dated NS 884–889 \(= 1683–1689 C.E.; see below\).24

What is striking is that all of these documents come from the Patan area, where the *agniśālā* is located, while the older inscription was at Bhaktapur. Strangely, there is thus far no testimony about an *agnihotra* of the king of Kathmandu.25 The presumption arises that the *agnihotra* meant for the entire valley had been localized at Patan early on.

1.4. Both facts agree with the legends still told in Patan by the families of the local *agnihotrī* clans, as well as in Padmagiri’s *Vamsāvali.*[^26] Under the Vaiśya-Ṭhakuri king Śaṅkaradeva \(c. 1065–1082 C.E.\) not only the *kuladevatā* of these kings, Tāraṇīdevī, would have been established at Kathmandu[^27] but also the *agnikuṇḍa* at Patan.

The *Vaṃśāvali* \(in Wright’s *History of Nepal*\) reports the same. However, it also adds[^28] that some *agnihotrin*s intermittently emigrated to Gaur \(Bengal\) after their village of Jhul was burned. Jhul was situated between Kīrtipur and Mātātīrtha, again located in the \(pre-\)Licchavi heartland of the brahmins.29 The wife of one of these brahmins then fled to Patan \(later than 188 C.E., the alleged date of a manuscript that she took along with her\), and she then lived in Ga\(la\) Bahal. Her son was a Banrā, a Buddhist. This tale combines an original *agnihotra* in the west of the valley with the later one at Patan.30 Apparently King Śaṅkaradeva was forced to reestablish the *agnihotra* after its abandonment or conversion to Buddhism by its priests.

There is, however, another legend from approximately the same period of time. According to the late *agnihotrī* Gurujvālānand, the *agnikuṇḍa* of Patan was founded about a thousand years ago after the destruction of Hāḍigaon by an *agnihotrī* who came down from the Manicūḍa mountain, north of Bhaktapur and Chaṅgu Nārāyaṇ. He stuck his staff into the sand of the Nakhu River \(Prabhāvatī\), located west of Patan, and took a bath there.31 By the end of his bath the staff had already begun to sprout leaves. This is the *varuṇa* \(= *varaṇa*\) tree,32 the *varuṇa-nāga*, that is currently in the courtyard of the *agniśālā.* The *mitrāvaruṇa* figure used in the ritual is made from its wood \(see below\). At that time, the Nakhu River was supposed to have flowed into the Bāgmatī at the place where the *agniśālā* is located today. Certainly various motifs are combined here, for example, that of King Maṇicūḍa of Sāketa, who is said to have given his name to many places in the valley.33 The Maṇināga legend is discussed in §[^2].10; \(compare the location of deities in Figure 1\)..

What is surprising in the study of the sources regarding the traditional *agnihotra* of Patan is the increasing “Newarization” of the texts during the last few centuries. The 1433 C.E. manuscript is written entirely in Sanskrit, while the one of 1601 already has Newari insertions; today’s manuscripts have, by and large, Newari “stage directions” for the individual rituals. Other local influences will be discussed later.

FIGURE 1


1.5. Besides the *agnihotra* of the Rājopādhyāyas of Patan, three others still exist, two of which are recent revivals by individuals: Nārāyaṇa Prasād \(a Pūrbe\) at Kumārīgal \(south of Bodhnāth\) and Tīrtha Rāj Ācārya \(a Pūrbe\) at Thamel \(north of the center of Kathmandu\). Both have taken up the Vedic ritual of their own accord[^34] and both closely follow the Vedic rules of the *Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra*, although Nārāyaṇ Prasād is said to have visited the Patan *agnihotra* as an “apprentice.” He is also said to have published a rather error-filled *Agnisthāpanavidhi.* The expenses for the ritual were paid for by King Mahendra.

These two revivalist Vedic rituals will not be discussed further here. Instead, another traditionally performed *agnihotra*, that of a Pūrbe brahmin who lives at the southern edge of the Paśupatināth temple \(opposite the newly built government pilgrims’ resthouse\). His house has an annex for the sacred fires. His family has been performing the ritual for some 200 years on behalf of the current[^35] dynasty. For this service he receives \(as of 1974\) the sum 18,000 rupees per year,36 meant for the purchase of wood for the sacred fire, and so on.

In India, of course, the *agnihotra* is still performed, though not all who call themselves *agnihotrī* are priests. In many cases the term has become a family name, in the same manner as Dixit, Vājapeyī/Bajpai, Chaube, and Tripathi. These priests cannot be located easily; whether or not there are Agnihotrins can only be discovered through local research. Clues may be found, for example, in A. Parpola’s and C. G. Kashikar’s list of *śrauta* rituals of officiating brahmins.37 Further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this essay, though a comparison would probably be useful if carried out after the investigation of the Nepalese *agnihotra.*

Not to be confused with the *agnihotra* ritual is the morning and evening *homa* \(*sāyamprātar-homa*\) that is not based on *śrauta* ritual. One example is that of the Kashmiri brahmins,38 which rests partially on the ritual of the Vedic Kaṭha school, but it has also has been influenced by Śaiva tantra. This ritual will be adduced later to explain the *agnihotra* of Patan. Finally, the very similar Buddhist *homa* rituals of the Kathmandu Valley should be noted.39



## 2. THE COURSE OF THE RITUAL

2.1. The layout of the offering ground basically is the same in all cases: it concerns the famous three Vedic fires: the *gārhapatya, āhavanīya*, and *dakṣiṇāgni* in the west, east, and south of the offering ground, respectively.40 Already in the *agnihotra* manuscript of 1433 C.E. these fires are called Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Rudra-Kuṇḍa, after the Hindu *trimūrti.* In between the three fires, a shallow depression or hole is dug out, the *vedi*, which according to the texts is supposed to have the shape of a woman, “broad at the shoulders and hips, narrower in the middle.” In the *agniśālā* of Patan, the *vedi* is missing, but at the new and full moon sacrifice rites grains are strewn out in the oval shape of a *vedi/samudra.*

There are two additional fires, the *sabhya* \(“hall fire”\) and the *āvasathya* \(“guest house fire”\); though their use was already controversial in the Vedic texts. If they are used, they are situated in separate “sheds” \(open halls\), each further west of the *gārhapatya* fire, in square- or triangular-shaped hearths. Both of these are found at Paśupatināth, but they are round in shape and are situated to the north of the *gārhapatya*, and as used by Tīrtharāj Ācārya at Thamel, they are even placed to the east \(\!\). At Patan they are used under the names *kumāra* or *sūrya kuṇḍa*, although the one in the east is parallel to the *gārhapatya.* In addition, between the two \(the *sūrya* and the *kumāra*\), there is an otherwise unknown structure, the *jala kuṇḍa.* In the yard in front of the *agniśālā*, several additional deities are situated, with aniconic places of worship: a *nāga*, the Bhairava stone, the *“varuṇa”* tree, Viśvakarma, and the Sūryavināyaka temple. All *agnihotra* forms of the valley share the accommodation of fire in an actual house, not, as is common in Kashmir or in India proper, in an open-sided hall or pavilion.

A sixth altar, without fire, the *jala*\[*vināyaka*\]*kuṇḍa*, has been added at Patan. The *vedi* is excavated about 10–[^15] cm. deep in the mud floor. Although the *vedi* depression as such is missing in Patan, it is indicated during the new and full moon sacrifices by a layer of rice or barley \(*samudra*\). Strikingly different from the Vedic norm is the reverse placement of the Vedic *dakṣiṇāgni* at Patan and Kumārīgal.

2.2. The implements used in the rituals are largely consistent with each other in shape and number \(for a selection, see Figure 3\).41 Particularly striking is the constant use of the *jñānakhaḍga*, the “sword of knowledge,” by the *agnihotrī* of Patan; during the ritual performance, he keeps this pointed piece of wood in his hand, or at least has it in a pocket or fold of his clothes. The *agnihotrī* of Paśupati seems to own something similar, however, in a much bigger format. It probably is the *sphya* that also appears next to the *jñānakhaḍga*, during the new and full moon sacrifices in Patan. The number of priests and other participants is congruent as well, although their external appearance, such as their clothing, differs.

FIGURE 3


2.3. The “sacrificer” \(*yajamāna*\)42 and his wife may be in attendance at the actual *agnihotra*, but the rite is carried out on their behalf by a priest. This is certainly necessary in the Veda when, as in this present case, the rite concerns the king, who as a *kṣatriya* is not qualified to perform the rite. It is, however, also the case that the sacrificer can perform the *agnihotra* himself if he is a brahmin.

In Patan and Paśupatināth, the king is the actual sacrificer, that is, the one who as the sponsor of the rite ultimately pays for it. However, he does not attend the rite, and the *agnihotrī* himself is the *yajamāna* who carries out the ritual for his own benefit, as well as on behalf of the king and the country.

There also are variations in the design of the four *agnihotra*s regarding the status of the wife of the sacrificer. At Paśupatināth I have never seen an *agnihotrī*’s wife participate, while at Thamel the wife’s participation is as prescribed in the Vedas. At Patan, however, the *agnihotrī*’s wife is very active, for various reasons. To begin with, she actually must actively assist her husband in the preparation and execution of the hundreds of small ritual actions. Such involvement is not as necessary with the other *agnihotrī*s who perform less complicated rites, as a Vedic ritual has “only” about a hundred individual actions. On the other hand, at Patan the wife of the sacrificer also has true priestly functions; we will return to this topic \(§[^3].3\). The clothing of the brahmins differs. The Newar *agnihotrī* wears traditional North Indian attire \(*dhoti, caubandhi*\) for the ritual just like the others, but his clothing may sometimes be colored red \(e.g., at the *pratipadā*\); otherwise, white clothing prevails.

2.4. The installation, the observances of the priests, and the time of the offering by the *agnihotra* differ as well. The succession of the *agnihotrin*s of Paśupatināth is governed by family membership; ideally, the son of the late *agnihotrī* becomes the new priest of the ritual. However, at Patan things are very different. According to Newar custom, it must be the eldest among the groups of brahmins that supply the *agnihotrin*s; of course, this results in relatively short tenures, and worse, in the successor’s relative unfamiliarity with the ritual. Although probably everyone has assisted his relatives as a boy or young man, these experiences may date back fifty years by the time the new *agnihotrī* takes over performance of the ritual.

On the other hand, knowledge of the ritual can optimally be acquired by participating in the biweekly *dārśapaurṇamāsa* rituals, which four additional priests must attend. They almost never appear, however, and it is often the case that the *agnihotrī* and his wife must carry out the duties of all six priests simultaneously. The last *agnihotrī*, who died in 1982, maintained that the ritual manual served as his real teacher \(*guru*\), and for that reason he did not allow the manuscript to be filmed, though otherwise the ritual could be recorded. This man served as the *agnihotrī* from 1974 to 1980; his successor, by now no longer the eldest but only the second or third in age ranking, could be persuaded only after a one- or two-year break to accept this vocation, since it requires a lot of time and effort.

Unlike with other *agnihotrin*s, very serious observances are imposed on the Patan *agnihotrin*. Perhaps most significantly, because he is seen to be identical with Agni, the fire god, he may no longer cross over a river. This restriction, incidentally, was already observed in the Vedic tradition for certain consecrated persons, though only for certain periods of time. The movements of the Patan *agnihotrin* for the rest of his life are thus limited to Patan and its southern outskirts, up to the rim of the valley, as large and small rivers limit the town’s area in the north, east, and west. Furthermore, he must fast often, cannot eat meat or eggs, and must be celibate. The late, penultimate *agnihotrin* \(who died in 1974\) is said to have suffered from impaired health after taking up the office, whereas he had previously walked every day from Patan to Gokarna, a distance of many kilometers. His successor, however, lived to the age of ninety-two.

2.5. The time when the ritual is performed at Paśupati and Patan also differs. The Vedic ritual is to take place at the time of sunrise or sunset; the *Brāhmaṇa* texts are full of discussions about the right point of time: before, during, or after sunrise. This rule is usually followed by the *agnihotrī* of Paśupati but not that of Patan: the first *agnihotra* takes place sometime in the morning, usually around 10 a.m., not at sunrise. Furthermore, the evening ritual is abbreviated. The reason for this discrepancy is in all likelihood the current status of the Patan *agnihotra*, which is not a private rite but is widely publicly accessible. About two dozen visitors attend, not just on their birthdays but even daily. The attendees are mostly women who offer *pūjā* plates and all kinds of gifts, and their attendance would hardly be possible at 6 a.m. In contrast, the *agnihotrin*s of Kumārīgal and Thamel still perform the rituals more or less at the correct time.

2.6. Regarding the pattern of the ritual, the similarities and differences in the rite are best outlined in a table \(see Figure 1 and Table 1\). Clearly, five main parts can be distinguished in the rite.43

2.7. Even from a cursory comparison of the Vedic rules \(here given according to the *Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra* of the *White Yajurveda*\), with the execution of the ritual by the Paśupatināth *agnihotrī* we can recognize that both forms are nearly identical. All actions that deal with the fire, the actual offering into the fire of milk, melted butter, and so on, are found, and the various water libations for the gods, ancestors, the seven *ṛṣi*, and Agni are present. All of these ritual forms have remained unchanged over the past two to three millennia. Recalling my first personal impressions, it is undeniable that this ancient ritual delivers an effect emanating from its simple solemnity. It is all the more remarkable that the prescribed form has been maintained and followed for so long, as generally the Vedic tradition in Nepal is not as strong and vibrant as that of South India.

Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the *agnihotrī* emphasized that he had never seen the text of the *Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra* or its commentary; he carried out the ritual simply according to family tradition. He referred to the extensive worship of the fires at the end of the ritual, especially that of the *sabhya* fire, as a family tradition, a supplement to the actual offering. This accords with the fact that the *agnyupasthāna* is expressly allowed as optional in the Veda and described in great detail, while a detailed worship of the fourth fire, the *sabhya*, is not mentioned. Only in the medieval *Paddhati* has an offering \(*homa*\) to the *āvasathya* fire been appended. That this is indeed a new departure is immediately apparent to the viewer through the rite of yogic *prāṇāyāma*, a practice of holding the breath and breathing through the left or right nostril.

2.8. Leaving aside the two Vedic revivals of the *agnihotra* at Thamel and Kumārīgal, we now turn to the *agnihotra* of Patan. Unfortunately, the textual situation is not as clear as might be desired because the actual text used in the *agnihotra* is not yet available.44 However, we have a full text that deals with all forms of *agnihotra-*related rituals: the *Agnihotra-vidhāna*, dated 1433 C.E. This manuscript first presents the establishment of the fires, then the special yearly rituals \(*pavamāna, pāvaka, śuci*\), then, in folios 28–[^84], the new and full moon ritual is described in great detail. This fundamentally still follows the Vedic rite, but it includes many later additions \(including the *mitrāvaruṇapūjā*\).45

The text then says, about the subsequent morning and evening *agnihotra* \(*sāyamprātarhoma*\):[^46]

*nyāsa-sthānāgniviharaṇa-vratagrahaṇa*

*pūrvavat, akṣa-vaṭana lokapālārcanaḥ,*[^47] *sarvatra pūrvavat samidhahomaḥ | … manike arja-vaṭana*[^48] *-lokapālārcanam paurvavat | … vratamokṣaṇam … | pradakṣiṇa |*[^49]

Some mantras are inserted into these specifications. Therefore, this is an abridged version that relies on the *prakṛti* of the *Dārśapaurṇamāsa*, which precedes it. Actually, the individual actions largely agree with each other, as a comparison of the columns “*agnihotra* \(PTN\)” and “*dārśapaurṇamāsa* \(PTN\)” shows; that is, apart from those that are typical for the new and full moon sacrifices such as the *vedi-saṃskāra* \(creating the *vedi* by drawing furrows, bestrewing, etc.\), producing, baking, and distribution of the *kapāla*s, the *iḍā* butter slices, as well as post-Vedic additions such as *bali, stotra*, and *mitrāvaruṇapūjā*.

This strange dependence is not found in the Veda, where the *agnihotra* and *dārśapaurṇamāsa* are treated as a separate rituals. It is my opinion that this can be explained by the ancient Vedic rule \(*Āpastamba Śrauta-sūtra* 6.15.10 ff., *Kaṭha Saṃhitā* 6.6, *Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā* 1.6.10\) that an *agnihotra* is not to be offered for a *kṣatriya* because members of that caste are violent and oppress brahmins \(*Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra* 4.15.16\). However, if one wants to offer for a *kṣatriya* \(such as for the king, *Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra* 4.15.16–[^19]\), then it may be done only for one who performs the *soma* ritual and who himself performs the *agnihotra* at the new and full moon \(*Āpastamba Śrauta-sūtra* 6.15.15\). On the other days, the main sacrificial priest \(*adhvaryu*\) is to celebrate the rite; that is, the king must theoretically take part as the *yajamāna* on new and full moon days, while on the other days only the *adhvaryu* need be present, as the quasi-*yajamāna*. It may be that the emphasis on the *dārśapaurṇamāsa* is based on these rules. Or, according to another provision, the *yajamāna* \(i.e., the *adhvaryu*\) only offers at the new and full moon rites; in turn, the daily *homa* secondarily derived from the *dārsapaurṇamāsa* is associated with it.

Whatever may be the case, even the replacement of milk offerings by ghee, grains \(or rice gruel, or *soma*\) can already be found in the Veda \(*Āpastamba Śrauta-sūtra* 6.15.8 *ad* 6.6.4\): for one who wishes, like a king, for “fiery force” \(priestly reputation\), destruction of his opponents, fulfillment of every desire, or a capable son. In any case, the form of the offerings, specifically the use of grains instead of milk, indicates that the king is the ritual sponsor.

These considerations aside, the actual execution of the daily *agnihotra* corresponds perfectly to the provisions of the 1433 C.E. manuscript, as a comparison of the columns “PTN: text \+ ritual” indicates; obviously, table 1 has been greatly simplified. The ritual takes about an hour, but it is often extended a great deal by the women who come to offer *pūjā.* The ritual thus includes several hundred individual actions that are simply confusing, if observed without an understanding of the underlying scheme.

2.9 Even during an initial, superficial consideration of the ritual structure, our attention is immediately drawn to the introduction of a *fixed vrata* scheme: the sponsor or the priest must submit to a particular observance that varies according to the ritual. Often its purpose is ritual rebirth: the sponsor must be silent, shave his hair, clench his fists; he receives new clothes that are identified with the *amnion*; he may drink only milk—these actions reflect the prenatal and early childhood stage. All of this is not as clea[^50] in the Vedic *agnihotra*, and originally was not even necessary as it concerned a sun spell. However, following the model of other rituals such as the *dārśapaurṇamāsa, soma*, etc., and the Purāṇic-Tantric *homa*,51 a clear *vrata* \(better, a *dīkṣā*\) scheme was introduced, which encloses the main part of the ritual. The *agnihotra* thus follows the typical Indian system of nesting ritual elements, a scheme also known from literature \(the *Mahābhārata, Kathāsaritsāgara*, etc.\).52 This procedure cannot be discussed here in detail; however, it is useful to keep in mind when we take up discussion of other parts of the ritual.

Another element that has clearly been inserted is the previously mentioned *āvāhana*, the summoning of the god Agni, who is identified with the sun:

*agnir jyotir, jyotir agniḥ svāhā* \(The light is Agni, Agni is the light, *svāhā.*\) \(VS 3.9\)

In other Vedic recensions this is even more obvious:

*agnir jyotir, jyotiḥ sūryaḥ… .* \(The light is fire, the sun is the light.\)

The summoning and worship of the god is followed by his “dismissal” \(*visarjana*\), a medieval designation derived from a *pūjā* term.53 This occurs immediately after the end of the ritual, when the worship of the fires takes place and the fires have been pushed together by hand, so that they will last overnight as burning embers, at least in the case of the *gārhapatya*. Agni will be “reawakened” in the morning, as the texts state.

Just as with the Paśupatināth *agnihotra*, and also at Patan, the worship of the fires is appended to the main ritual. In both cases, this is clearly a post-Vedic development, perhaps due to the separate representation of the *Agnyupasthāna* in the sūtras: whatever followed the actual *agnihotra* was now also appended in practice. In both forms of the *agnihotra*, this devotion has been extended a great deal. In Patan it takes place in front of the *jalakuṇḍa*, thus in front of the place of the snakes \(*jalanāga, mani*\[*ka*\]*nāgarāja*\), and this devotion does not involve a fire at all.

2.10. We have now arrived at a very interesting point. We know that snakes, such as the *nāga* king Karkoṭaka, play a major role in the mythological prehistory of the Kathmandu Valley. Like Kashmir, the valley is said to have originally been covered by a lake \(now affirmed by geology\). Special worship of snakes can, therefore, be expected. They have their own festival in the monsoon, the Nāga Pañcamī, which is also carried out at the *agniśālā.* In both the *agnihotra* and the *dārśapaurṇamāsa*, there is an additional *sarpahom*a or *maṇināga*\[*rāja*\]*-kṣīrahoma*, an offering to the snake king Maṇināga \(often Manināga, Manika\).54 This occurs at precisely the same moment as that of a water libation to the snakes in the Vedic *agnihotra* \(*Āpastamba Śrauta-sūtra* 6.12.4\): after the remains of the offerings by the *yajamāna* have been consumed and after the water libations to the *deva, pitṛ*, seven *ṛṣi*, and *agni pṛthivīkṛt*, the offerer cleans the sacrificial spoon with water and grass and then offers in the different directions of the sky with the formulas “for the snakes, you; animate the snakes”; “revive the snakes and ants”; “animate the creatures other than snakes”; “revive the serpent deities\!”[^55] These mantras are not found in the *Kātyāyana Śrauta-sūtra*, but in the *Āpastamba Śrauta-sūtra* and \(partially\) the *Hiraṇyakeśi* \[*Satyāṣāḍha*\] *Śrauta-sūtra*, the *Mānava Śrauta-sūtra* and the *Āśvalāyana Śrauta-sūtra*.56

Interestingly, in this ritual we find that a blending with the operation of other Veda schools has taken place, which raises the question of the compilation of the *Yajurvidhāna* of 1433 C.E. 57 In this regard, the Vedic detail is probably the origin of the extensive worship of snakes in this ritual. Methodologically, this is of great interest. Without the Vedic or medieval texts, we would readily assume that the cult of Maṇināga was a purely local Nepali tradition. We can now no longer assume that; consequently, we must refer to Maṇināga, who is attested earlier in Orissa, where he was venerated by Maitrāyaṇīya brahmins.58 But how was the name Maṇināga\[rāja\] derived? Maṇināga, in association with Maṇicūḍa, is not unknown in Nepal. As a later bodhisattva he was the king of Sāketa \(Ayodhyā\) and, according to legend, he wore a jewel \(*maṇi*\) on his head. His beneficial actions are well reported in literature.59 Local legend has it that he carried out a *nirguṇa-yajña* on Manicūṛ mountain, north of Bodhnāth/Bhaktapur.

The following place names are derived from his name: Maṇicūḍa-giri \(the name of the mountain mentioned above\); Maṇiliṅga \(in Gyāneśvar?\); Maṇirohiṇī; Maṇitalāva; Maṇiyoginī \(in Sankhu, cf. Wright, *History of Nepal*, p. 90\): Bajrayoginī; Maṇicaitya; Maṇidhārā; Maṇigaṇeś; Maṇimahākālā; Maṇimanoharā \(river\) = Maṇimatī;[^60] Maṇikumāra; Maṇimaṇḍapa \(= west of Mangal Bazar, Patan\); Maṇigal-bhaṭṭa \(Palace of Patan\); cf. also Maṇināgāṭṭika,61 in a Licchavi inscription of ca. 750 C.E. 62

In another variant[^63] the stone would have been hidden in the *liṅga* of Gyāneśvar and would have fled from there into the Prabhāvatī \(Nakhu\) River, which also plays a major role in the founding legend of the *agnihotra* of Patan. Gyāneśvar \(Hāḍigaon\) was probably the capital of Nepal during the Licchavi period.64 We notice that one always tried to connect the ancient capitals with their *agnihotra* locations: Mātātīrtha—Patan,65 Gyāneśvar—Patan \(Nakhu\); and, in contrast, originating from India, the land of the “great tradition”: Sāketa \(Ayodhyā\)—Manicūḍa mountain—Nakhu \(Patan\), Mithilānagara \(Simraongarh\)—eastern Bhaktapur—northwestern Bhaktapur.66

The importance of Maṇināga for the *agnihotra* is indicated already in the introductory verse of the 1433 C.E. manual: *brahma viṣṇuḥ sarudrāya pāvakosatyarūpiṇe Maṇiko-nāganāthāya namaḥ.* Similarly, in the inscription at the Patan *agniśālā: … maṇiko-nāgarājāya yajñarūpāya te namaḥ.*[^67]

2.11. A comment on a development typical for Nepal may be made here. Both at the beginning of the ritual, sometimes in the middle of the ritual, and in particular at its end, a small red wooden figure, standing before the *āhavanīya*, is particularly revered. According to the priest and mentioned in the 1433 C.E. manuscript, it is called Mitrāvaruṇa, for example, *mitrāvaruṇam ādāya … mitrāvaruṇasthāpanam.* This actually concerns two gods, Mitra and Varuṇa, the Vedic Mitrāvaruṇā\[u\]‌. As is well known, only Varuṇa has survived in post-Vedic times, though not as a king of the gods but as the lord of the ocean, a less important position in the pantheon. However, at Patan this divine pair suddenly resurfaces, after 2,000 years, without any supporting textual evidence. There are many traditions in India that have existed “under the surface” for a long time or have lived on without textual mention, or which have deliberately not been mentioned but developed further, only to show up rather suddenly in a later text. However, in the present case, there is another reason for the seemingly odd reemergence of these two obscure figures.

The founding legend of the *agniśālā* reports that the *“varuṇa”* tree in the courtyard grew from the walking stick of the *agnihotrī* \(as in the legend mentioned above\). The *mitrāvaruṇa* figure is made from its wood, and when performing an *agnihotra* the priest walks to the *varaṇa* tree, the *mitrāvaruṇa* figure in his hand, and worships the tree with a *tilaka.* We may therefore assume that a connection has been made between the *varaṇa* tree of the first *agnihotrī* and the ocean god Varuṇa; this is one of quasi-etymological nature, as has been quite common since Vedic times. \(Note also that many sacrificial implements are to be made from *varaṇa* wood; Kāty.Śr.S. 1.3.32\).

The background is this, among other elements: the location of the *agniśālā* is closely related to water—at this site there was the earlier confluence of the Nakhu \(Prabhāvatī\) and Bāgmatī rivers \(thus, a *triveṇī,* including also the heavenly Sarasvatī, the Milky Way\),68 and this is also where the *jalakuṇḍa* of the serpent god Maṇināga is found. Even today the ground is particularly moist, and in fact one can clearly see traces of rising groundwater on the fire altars. Even the *vedi* \(which is incidentally called *samudra*\) had once been flooded; however, this failed to extinguish the *āhavanīya.* Everything fits nicely in mythical thought\!

On the other hand, in Indian texts rites such as the Mahārāṣṭrian fortnightly *pakṣayāga*[^69] also include worship of Varuṇa. Indeed after worship of the Mahāvedi and the *maṇḍala* gods, and after the installation of the *kalaśa*, Varuṇa is worshiped on the covering plate of his vessel.

2.12. Returning to the structure of the ritual, two frames have become clear: that of the actual *agnihotra* \(*vratārambha—vratamokṣaṇa*\) and that of the main oblations \(*agny- āvāhana—visarjana*\). Another, all-enclosing frame may be seen in the carrying forward \(*agni-viharaṇa*\) and final combining of the wooden sticks and the embers of the fires. This is not as pronounced here as in the Vedic ritual, however. A framework that includes the entire ritual is established by the *nyāsa*, the evocation of the god in meditation at the beginning of the ritual and the identification of his body parts with those of the priest; and, upon completion, the sending off of the god.

This ultimately results in a structure equivalent to Buddhist and other Hindu tantric *homa*s[^70] with a dual summoning of the god: first, by meditation and infusion into the fire of the conventional \(*samaya*\), mentally created god, then the evocation \(*avāhana*\) of, as the Buddhists would say, the *lokottara* or *jñānadeva*, and their union.71 Apparently it is only at this one location in Indian culture that the Vedic *agnihotra* ritual has undergone a development to a typical tantric ritual, a real and quite special local development.72

2.13. Many other details of the Patan *agnihotra*, in particular, of the new and full moon sacrifice, and other rituals cannot be further discussed here. According to the 1433 C.E. text, there are those listed in Table 2

b Similar to the consecration of a new Macchendranāth figure \(Locke 1980: 208‒216\); at the assumption of office by the new Agnihotri, the new Mitrāvaruṇa, too, has to undergo the ten *saṃskāras* \(MS fol. 7: *nāganātha* \(Maṇikanāga\), starting with *garbhādhāna* via *vratabandha* \(= *upanayana*\) and ending with *patnīyojana* \(who is the *patnī* here is not clear initially, perhaps the wife of the Agnihotri, as he should carry the fire inside\); on the *janai pūrṇimā* day, Mitrāvaruṇa as all participating Brahmins, the fire altars, etc. receive a new Yajñopavīta \(*puṭṭikā*, whose shape differs from the commonly used one\).


Two additional comments: when the new or full moon sacrifice is carried out every fortnight, next to the *agnihotrin* and his wife \(*yajamana, yajamānī*\) the following priests must take part as well: the *hotṛ, adhvaryu, brahman, agnīdh* \(who are attributed to the *Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda*, and *Upaveda*, respectively\). However, they appear rarely; only at the performance of the *pāvanārohaṇa* in 1985 did three of the four additional officiating priests attend. In this particular case, the sequence of the ritual was: *agnihotra—paurṇamāsa—pāvanārohaṇa.* At other times, only the new and full moon sacrifice follows the actual *agnihotra*, just as it is prescribed in the Vedas.

Finally, a very important point: during the offerings to the gods, ancestors, and so on, the late *agnihotrī* clearly mentioned the name of the king \(also that of the late King Mahendra\), probably because the king had financially supported the *agnihotra* \(as well as the *agnihotra* of Kumārīgal\). It was previously noted that the ruler was mentioned, for the first time, in the manual of 1601 C.E. Thus, an expressive relationship is established between the *agnihotra* and its real *yajamāna*, the \(ruling\) king.



## 3. SOCIAL POSITION

3.1. We now proceed to the important social context of the ritual and the social position of its priests, for both or all of its four forms. The different ethnic or communal affiliations of the *agnihotrin*s have been discussed above: the *rājopādhyāya*s represent the oldest, early medieval layer of the immigration of brahmins into the valley. As has very frequently occurred in eastern India,73 here, too, Kanauj is claimed as their previous home. In Patan, they belong to six clans \(*kawaḥ*\)74 that purport, just as those from Bhaktapur, to have immigrated from Mithilā along with King Harisiṃha. The family tradition of a *rājopādhyāya* family of Patan goes back for twenty-three generations to a Śaktirāma,75 one of Bhaktapur for twenty generations to Ullāsarāja,76 thus to ca. 1400–1500 C.E., a period when many brahmins immigrated both from central North India \(“Kanauj”\) as well as from Mithilā, and from eastern areas up to Bengal.

The six clans, named after their place of residence, and with additional “family names,” are the following, according to Michael Allan: \(1\) Bakaniṃha, about twenty-five families, family name Sukula;[^77] \(2\) Wala: Paṇḍeya; \(3\) Thabu \(in Allan; perhaps more correctly Bamlāniṃha \[Bolima\]: *agnihotrī*\); \(4\) Tadalibi \(?\); \(5\) Nuga, extinct; \(6\) Soniṃha \(Solima\): Miśra, about twelve families.78 Incidentally, it is doubtful whether this classification is old. The inscription at the *Agnimaṭha* speaks only of a Guṭhī[^79] \(*dvijapañcāli*\). Here, too, a Śakti-\[Rāma\] is mentioned: *brahmapuri dvijavara śakti.* … Perhaps this inscription is the source of Hemrāj Śākya’s date of 1572 for the Agnimaṭ*ha*: the number “[^2]” could still be recognized.80

The *agnihotrin*s thus seem to belong to the third subgroup. All marriages take place among these five subgroups, nowadays often also outside of town \(e.g., in Bhaktapur\), since the 100 *rājopādhyāya* families are divided in just three *gotra*s, and it is difficult to find suitable brides for their young men. The *gotra*s are Bhāradvāja, Gārgya, and Śāṇḍilya.81

The Pūrbe, to whom the other three *agnihotrin*s \(of Paśupati, etc.\) belong, came from areas to the east, some clearly from Bengal.82 After the conquest of the valley by the Gorkhas \(1768–1769\), they outflanked the *rājopādhyāya*s and supplied the *rājaguru*s from them onward, up to the Rāṇā rulers. Both groups were therefore in close contact with the respective dynasty. This also applies to the priests who perform the *agnihotra.* It was previously mentioned that an old witness of the *agnihotra* in Nepal, a fragmentary inscription, is found very close to the old palace of Bhaktapur. Also, the legends about the creation of the first *agnikuṇḍa* of Patan and the *agnihotra* unequivocally prove a relationship with the palace. Śaṅkaradeva founded both the temple of his \(actually, already the Licchavi kings’\) *kuladevatā*, Tāraṇīdevī, at the Hanuman Dhoka and the Patan *agnikuṇḍa.*

I have not found a direct reference to the king in the 1433 C.E. manuscript; however, in the 1601 C.E. text the king is mentioned \(see §[^4]\):[^83]

*rājā dharma-vijayī bhavatu | prajā sukhinaḥ santu | deśa-subhodayo ‘stu …*

*dvipada-catuṣpadebhyaḥ śubham bhavatu | sarvvasatvāḥ sukhinaḥ santu | parjanyaḥ kālavarṣī bhavatu ||*

This manuscript belonged to the famous *rājaguru* of Patan, Viśvanāth Upādhya. Some statements can be made about his family and other relatives. The manuscript of NS 721 \(1601 C.E.\) comes from a time when Patan still belonged to the kingdom of Kathmandu \(under King Śivasiṃha, NS 718–739 = 1598–1619 C.E.\). Under this king, as well as under his predecessor Ratnamalla \(1482–ca. 1520 C.E.\) South Indian brahmins served as the *rājaguru*s or chief priests of Paśupatināth.84 It appears that the first king of Patan, Siddhinarasiṃha Malla \(NS 738–788 = 1618–1667 C.E.\), deliberately preferred the local brahmins, in contrast to Kathmandu. Viśvanāth is attested as his *rājaguru* at the Kṛṣṇa temple[^85] in NS 757, and then under the next king, Śrīnivāsa Malla \(NS 778–805 = 1668–1685 C.E.\). In NS 793, his son Harināth Upādhya performed a *koṭyāhuti-homa*, and in NS 800 a *homa* at Lele.86

Today, the king is mentioned in all the rituals, such as the *saṃkalpa*, and, as mentioned earlier, King Mahendra is also named. The latter point may go back to a donation from the king and is probably of a more random nature. All brahmins report that there had been many rituals in Rāṇā time and under Mahendra, but that in the 1970s there was no money to be had for them. Perhaps this situation is, since 1977, undergoing change as a result of the Sanskritization policy established by the education minister Paśupati Śamśer. A first indication is the introduction of a *paurohita* examination by the university.87

3.2. What happened to the *agnihotra* supported by the Malla kings of Patan after the conquest of the valley by the Gorkhas? Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇ, especially as he was planning to set up his capital at Dahacok at the rim of the valley, could have let it continue “for the good of the country,” as is still said today, just as the kings of Kathmandu and Bhaktapur \(after the division of the valley into two or three subkingdoms\) apparently did not install their own *agnihotra*s but, for example, established a special Paśupatināth temple in Bhaktapur, in competition with that of Kathmandu, many *kumārī*s, and so on. Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇ reached another decision, however: as the *rājaguru*s were no longer chosen from among the Newari-speaking Rājopādhyāyas \(and also were not freshly imported from India\), the *agnihotra* was replaced, too—not in Patan, however, but with a newly founded one \(or a reestablished one\); and neither at Kathmandu nor at Nuwakot but at a more or less centrally located place, on the southern edge of the Paśupatināth temple. One would actually have expected a location south of the palace of Kathmandu \(or of Nuwakot\), as brahmins were settled south of the palace.

Pṛthvī Narayan selected, apparently deliberately, a Pūrbe brahmin family \(Gautam\) at Paśupatināth. This family has performed the *agnihotra* for 200 years with an annual stipend of 18,000 rupees \(in 1974–1975\). This was clearly a centrist political move: neither a Gorkha \(Kumaĩ\), nor a Newar, nor a Maithila became *rājaguru*s and *agnihotrī*s but one of the Pūrbes, a clan that had recently given its allegiance to the Gorkhas.

The end of royal patronage and support were not without consequence at Patan. The *agnihotrin*s must have initially been secure enough due to their family possessions and the Guṭhī; in the long run, however, they were at a disadvantage in terms of social position and also financially. It is likely that the *agnihotrin*s then came up with the brilliant idea to seek support from among the population of Patan. So far, it had merely been stated in the 1601 C.E. text: *prajā sukhinaḥ santu*, and so on; it now became normal for people to attend the temple at least once a year, on their birthdays, with horoscope and *pūjā* gifts, to ask for prayers of good fortune in the coming year.

However, local worship is not restricted to this: even today many women \(though few men\) still come to the Agni temple with *pūjā* gifts. The *agniśālā*, the space of an originally private \(or royal\) Vedic sacrifice, has become a popular Agni temple. Incidentally, the popular aspect of the temple can be recognized in its external form; it is not one of the usual pagoda-style temples with a *cella* at its center; rather, it is a *dyocheṃ* \(a “god’s house,” in its real meaning\), and only the temples of some popular gods have this form. We may actually be witnessing the Vedic god Agni experiencing a secondary flowering, to gauge from the constant influx of twenty to fifty women \(on average\) appearing for his *pūjā* every morning. Certainly, Agni is not as popular as, for example, the Maru Gaṇeś of Kathmandu, but he also is no longer only a “private god,” as in the Paśupatināth, Thamel, and Kumārīgal *agnihotra*s.

It is also important that the visiting women do not worship the iconic form of Agni above the entrance on the lower end of the *toraṇa*, as is often the case \(e.g., the deity figures at Suvarṇadhoka, Bhaktapur\). Instead they venerate the aniconic Agni, the *āhavanīya* fire. Here, in probably the only place remaining in Indian culture, Agni is still a living god, just as is Mitrāvaruṇa, though probably quite secondarily. How far Vedic ideas can penetrate again is seen in the idea of Agni as “growing inside his house” \(RV 1.1.8\).88 Sometimes non-Newars appear for his *pūjā* \(I once observed Nepali speakers with a Gurung servant\); sometimes even Rāṇās are said to offer sacrifice; one of whom sponsored a big *lakṣahoma*. Smaller *homa*s for the attainment of special requests are also commissioned by others \(Newars, etc.\).

3.3. Particularly striking is the role of the *yajamānī*, the wife of the *agnihotrī*: she is not, as is the case with other *agnihotrin*s, merely a static attendant or one who performs just a few ritual actions; rather she serves, as does her husband, in a kind of “pastoral” function, taking special care of the women. For example, I once observed a *yajamānī* sitting in the vestibule of the *agniśālā* and comforting a woman who had recently lost both her husband and son.

3.4. After losing their high position as *rājaguru*s 200 years ago, these brahmins tried to regain their social status from time to time. For example, in the law code of the Rāṇās \(valid until 1963\), the Rājopādhyāyas ranked after the Nepali Kumaĩ \(Upādhyāya\), Rājput \(Chetri\), Jaisi Bahun, Desi Bahun, but before the actual Chetri castes.89 They conducted—like one at Bhaktapur and the Buddhist one of the *bajrācārya*s[^90] of Kathmandu—a special *śāntihoma* at the home of a Rājopādhyāya \(near Mangal Bazar, Patan\) in summer 1976 to avert a predicted earthquake, and they thus tried to gain the attention of the palace. Such pursuits did not have much success, even if for the first time some Rājopādhyāyas were invited to the coronation of King Birendra in 1975, though they did not serve as main actors in the ritual. It looks as if the Rājopādhyāyas are to remain at a relatively low social position—even though other brahmins both envy and despise them because of their facility with tantric rituals and due to the high number of *yajamāna*s among them. All Hindus among the approximately 300,000 Newars of the valley have one of about 100 Rājopādhyāya families as their *purohita*.

Hope remains that the Rājopādhyāya will retain their special institution of the *agnihotra* \(possibly financing it themselves\) and that the tradition will not die out, as was feared would be the case in the early 1980s.91 It remains to be seen what impact the government’s Sanskritization policy may have. The resumption of interest in Sanskrit and everything connected with it, under education minister Paśupati Śamśer \(1977\), took place after some ten to fifteen years of emphasizing Nepali culture \(folk songs, dances, theater productions, study of the Karṇāli region by the university\), and included the recent introduction of Karmakāṇḍa courses at the university \(probably along the lines of Baroda, at the beginning of the century\), to further the establishment of the Sanskrit University at Dang, which had been planned since the days of King Mahendra. It had been regarded as superfluous \(i.e., not conducive to economic development\), was quickly abandoned, and then founded in the mid-1970s merely as a “campus,” and also in order to get rid of the annoying propaganda of Yogi Naraharināth for a Sanskrit university.

It is interesting to observe that this impulse emanated from a minister who had spent almost all of his school years and received his university education in the West. On other hand, in the consistent implementation \(including the exemption of fees for Sanskrit studies even for high school years\) we may perceive a request of the palace behind all of this. During the coronation celebrations, too, one could observe a holding on to old traditions, in part, including the *rājopādhyāya*s. Unless major political changes set in,92 one can actually reckon with a follow-up of promoting the \(as much as possible, local\) Sanskritic traditions, in short, of all that can serve the public image and further the consolidation of the “only Hindu kingdom.”



## 4. SUMMARY

Finally, when an attempt is made to summarize the results of a first comparison of the two main proponents of the *agnihotra*s in Nepal \(leaving the two revivals apart\), their original similarities and subsequent individual developments can briefly be presented by a few key words \(see Table 5\) .


TABLE 5.  
COMPARISON OF THE PATAN AND THE PAŚUPATINĀTH AGNIHOTRAS
Patan Paśupatināth  **[^4].1**    Probably central for all Nepal \(of the Malla kingdom\), located on the southern edge of Patan. Central for all of Nepal \(of the Gorkha/Shaha dynasty\) on the southern edge of the Paśupatināth complex.   According to legend, founded by King Śaṅkaradeva \(about 1075 C.E.\). Founded by the first king of recently united Nepal, Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇ \(ca. 1779\)   **[^4].2**    Execution by Newari-speaking Rājopādhyāyas, long-established and assimilated during the Middle Ages. Execution by Pūrbe Brahmins, relatively late immigrants from India who took over Nepali as their vernacular.   **[^4].3**    Tradition of the rite by automatically witnessing, shared experience and by assistance in its execution; more importantly, by written tradition: pure Sanskrit \(1433 C.E.\), later on Skt. mixed in with Newari instructions \(1600 C.E. \+\); succession by Thakali system. Purely oral family tradition; written tradition is not taken into account even though its existence is known: a ‘Vedic’ trait.   **[^4].4.**    Ritual is *miśra:* Tantric and Vedic elements are strongly intermingled: the frame is Tantric, the core still is Vedic: *nyāsa → \(vrata → \(\(āvāhana -→ visarjana\)\) vratavimokṣaṇa\) śānti.* The ritual structure and its sequence is \(almost\) purely Vedic; *vrata → \(anga \(\(pradhāna\)\) aṅga\) → vrata-vimokṣaṇa*.   Though Agni is aniconic, Mitrāvaruṇa undergoes, as a figure, the *saṃskāras* and *pavitrārohaṇa*. Only—in the opinion of Agnihotrin—additional Upasthāna at the Āvasathya fire \(which is, however ,already medieval: Paddhati on the Kāty.ŚS\).   **[^4].5**    Three main fires \+ two extra ones \(these are wrongly arranged\); in addition, *jala-kuṇḍa* \(of the snakes: Maṇināga\). Three main fires \+ two extra ones \(these are wrongly arranged\).   Numerous additional gods \(Viśvakarman, etc.\) Special veneration of Mitrāvaruṇa, secondarily created from the Varuṇa \(&lt; *varaṇa\)* tree.    **[^4].6.**    Recent developments:  
Pūjā ritual: interwoven and independent from the Agnihotra, Development of Agni into local \(and realm’s?\) god. **—**   **[^4].7.**    New function of the Agnihotri and his wife as a “pastor” of Patan Partial acceptance by the Gorkhalis \(offers by Rāṇā families\). **—**   

The originally North Indian *agnihotra* of Patan, which has for centuries been executed in the Kathmandu Valley, and which has increasingly been exposed to local influences, was replaced by the new dynasty at the end of the eighteenth century with a purely Vedic ritual, as it was contemporaneously carried out at Benares. The priest was changed as well and was centrally positioned at the realm’s main sanctuary, Paśupatināth. The goal of Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇ was obviously to counterpoise and balance local tantric tradition with the transregional “pure” Vedic tradition \(of Benares\). In addition, he also wanted to move away from local Newar traditions, customs, and usages; this included the plan for a capital just outside the valley. Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇ’s turn toward Vedic tradition may ultimately have been influenced by a north Indian model: a few decades earlier the Mahārāja of Jaipur had performed the last known *aśvamedha.*

[^35]: The monarchy of the Shaha dynasty was abolished by Parliament in 2008; Nepal now is a secular “federal democratic republic.” However, Ram Prasad Gautam Agnihotri, the brother of the Agnihotri I interviewed and filmed in the 1970s has continued the ritual until today \(personal communication by François Voegeli, April 30, 2014\).

[^40]: Discussed in Tadeusz Skorupski, “Buddhist Permutations and Symbolism of Fire,” in this volume.

[^41]: They are very ancient in that they are still made of wood, just as is described in the Vedic texts themselves, but also, as Dieter Schlingloff has kindly informed me, as shown in figures at Sanchi; thus the forms of these implements date from the last few centuries B.C.E.

[^42]: “Sacrificer” is the traditional Indological translation, though the *yajamāna* \(literally, “one who sacrifices for himself”\) usually is only the sponsor of a particular ritual, which is carried out by his *purohita* or other priests, as in the present case.

[^43]: Cf. Hertha Krick, *Das Ritual der Feuergründung: \(Agnyādheya\)* \(Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1982\), p. 502 ff.; the *Agnihotravrata*, for the Vedic situation.

[^44]: See n. 21 for the filming of the manuscripts. Cf. Dumont, *L’Agnihotra*, §[^80], and the *Devayājñika Paddhati* in *Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra* 1933: 127 f.

[^45]: See §[^2].13, and notes 19, 21, 23, 24.

[^46]: See §[^2].11.

[^47]: Not to be confused with the *gṛhya* ritual \(see §[^1].5 n. 34\). The ritual discussed here has clear *śrauta* elements; this probably concerns just a medieval confusion of terms, such as: *sāyam/prātar-*\[*agnihotra*\]-*homa/ yāga.*

[^48]: Not yet clear to me; even the reading is not certain: *akṣa/arja/akra* at this and other passages.

[^49]: This probably could be translated “*nyāsa* \(projection of the god\); carrying apart \(i.e., spreading to the other fires\) of *sthānāgni* \(“continuation fire,” which should not be extinguished = *gārhapatya*, cf. Böhtlingk and Roth, eds., *Sanskrit-wörterbuch herausgegeben von der Kaiserlichen akademie der wissenschaften*, column 1320, *sub* d.\); or rather as “fire of the place” \(= of the *agniśālā*\); taking up of the observance, as shown previously \(namely in the *dārśapaurṇamāsa*, etc.\); worship the guardians of the world \(and?\) … everywhere as before: offering of the fire sticks into the fire; at the *maṇika* \(altar?\); worship the guardians of the world as before, releasing the observance, clockwise circumambulation.”

[^50]: Cf., however, the Paddhati on *Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra* 4.15.5; Dumont, *L’Agnihotra*, §[^76].

[^51]: Dealt with by Witzel, “Buddhist Forms of Fire Ritual \(*homa*\) in Nepal and Japan”; cf. n. 39.

[^52]: On this, cf. Witzel, “Buddhist Forms of Fire Ritual \(*Homa*\) in Nepal and Japan”; Frits Staal, in my view, depicts this, not quite accurately, based on the family tree scheme that has been popular in philology and linguistics since the mid-nineteenth century. However, this concerns \(sets of\) fully interchangeable \(under certain conditions\) pieces that can be inserted *into* each other, much like the well-known Russian nesting dolls or Japanese *kokeshi* dolls. The same is found in Pāṇini’s grammar \(where the conditions are more complicated, see, e.g., the Tripādī\), and the in the study of the Veda \(*avāntaradīkṣā*; see Witzel, *The Veda in Kashmir*, chapter 5\). This may well be regarded as one of the more typical arrangements and forms of thought in India \(besides ring composition, concatenation, etc.\) Probably the first mention of such an idea in the secondary literature is found in Louis Dumont, who however has taken this over from his African student, R. Apthorpe. See Dumont, *Homo hierarchicus: Le Système des castes et ses implications* \(Paris: Gallimard, 1979\), 398 ff.; Paul Thieme, “Meaning and Form of the ‘Grammar’ of Pāṇini,” *Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik* *[^8]*/[^9] \(1982\): 12.

[^53]: Note, however, the opposite concept of *āvahana* already in Vedic; e.g., *devatānām āvāhanam* in the *Dārśapaurṇamāsa*, cf. A. Hillebrandt, *Das altindische Neu-u. Vollmondopfer* \(Jena: Eugen Diederichs Verlag, 1879\), p. 84: *agnim agna āvāha, somam āvaha*… .

[^54]: With the typical nonobservance of retroflex sounds in Newari.

[^55]: Willem Caland’s translation in *Das Śrautasūtra des Āpastamba* \(Amsterdam: Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, 1924–1928\); the text has *sarpebhyas tvā sarpān jinva, sarpān pippilikā jinva, sarpetarajanān jinva, sarpadevajanān jinva*.

[^56]: See Dumont, *L’Agnihotra*, p. 63, Index of the ritual actions, p. 219, nos. 138–141; Caland, *Das Śrautasūtra des Āpastamba*, p. 192; cf. also Vaitāna Sūtra in Dumont, *L’Agnihotra*, p. 208.

[^57]: The origin of this is still open to question; the colophons always read *brahmokte yajurvidhāna agnihotre … prathamo dhyāyaḥ*, and the like. I have found nothing in the *Brahmapurāṇa; brahmokta,* “proclaimed by Brahma,” could indicate a very general origin or point to a relationship with the *Atharvaveda* \(*Brahmaveda*\). The mantras, however, agree with the *Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.*

[^67]: Why the grammatically incorrect form *Maniko* is used in both cases is not apparent to me. It cannot be a local form \(without *sandhi*\), as elsewhere Manika, Maṇika-nāga, etc. appear regularly.

Oosthoek’s Uitgevers Mij., 1951\]\), where the use of mantras for sorcery is taught, etc.

[^70]: Cf., e.g., E. Krishnamacarya, ed., *Jayākhyā-Saṃhitā* \(Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1967\), pp. 132–158 \(*agnikāryavidhāna*\); also with ten *saṃskāra*s \(p. 141\) for the tantric fire like the ones for Mitrāvaruṇa; see also n. 49. A superficial characterization of the ritual is found in R. C. Hazra, *Studies in the Puranic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs* \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas, 1975\), p. 219.

[^71]: It remains to be seen whether Buddhist forms of fire ritual have exercised an influence on the Brahmanical forms \(*homa, agnihotra*\) in the Kathmandu Valley. One merely has to observe the fairly frequently occurring designation *nirvāṇa* in these rituals and the doubling of the sword, *sphya* or *jnāna-khaḍga*, the name of which points to that of the sword of wisdom of Manjuśrī Bodhisattva, and which is not used to excavate the *vedi*, as is the ordinary implement. It is possible that similar ideas underlie the use of the sword by the *agnihotri* of Paśupatināth, but this requires further exploration.

[^79]: A *guṭhī* \(Skt. *goṣṭhikā, pañcāli*\) is a socio-religious organization supported by a private or royal donation or by land revenue.

[^80]: The inscription had further decayed by 1985, and even more so when I last saw it in 2009. Children \(or *bhikṣu*s, as the *agnihotrī* used to call them when scolding them\) play in the courtyard where the inscription is set into the surrounding wall; cf. text in Sharma, *Agiṃmathaḥ.yā aitihāsik sāmagrī*, p. 25; cf. Bajracharya, *Madhyakāliṇkā Abhilekh*, p. 31, dated 1569 C.E.

[^83]: Here printed as seen in the manuscript.

[^84]: See Regmi, *Medieval Nepal*, vol. 2, p. 440; another South Indian from Colamaṇḍala appears in the long inscription of 1671 C.E. \(*Medieval Nepal*, vol. 3, p. 83\): Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa, see also no. 30, NS 734 \(= 1615 C.E.\); cf. also Petech, *Mediaeval History of Nepal*, p. 70, South Indian brahmins lived perhaps since 1178–1182 C.E., under Cālukya influence in Nepal; Witzel, “Materialien zu den vedischen Schulen: I. Über die Caraka-Schule,” *Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik* *[^7]* \(1981\): 129 sq., however, indicates that already around 750 C.E. and 1036 C.E. Taittirīya brahmins \(i.e., by that time only South Indians\) were present in the Kathmandu Valley. Perhaps they were even earlier immigrants, in early Licchavi or pre-Licchavi times; note such names as Godavari and Gokarna. See also Axel Michaels, *Die Reisen der Götter: der nepalische Paśupatinātha-Tempel und sein rituelles Umfeld* \(Bonn: VGH Wissenschaftsverlag, 1994\).

[^85]: Particularly this structure in northern Indian style shows another trait of contemporary religious politics, taking into account the spread of the Kṛṣṇa cult. \(Cf. the encroachment of names of  Viṣṇu, e.g., in the family tree \(Witzel, *Zur Geschichte der Rājopādhyāyas von Bhaktapur*, opposite p. 172\); at the same time the first inclusion into the Hindu pantheon of Lokeśvara/Karuṇamaya/Bugadeva is attested \(as Macchendranāth\), see the *Matsyendrapadyaśatakam* of Nīlakaṇṭha, manuscript dated 1677 C.E.; Locke, *Karunamaya*, pp. 282, 437; *Bhāsāvaṃśāvali*, vol. 2, p. 70. On the other hand, note the emphasis on the independent Nepalese tradition \(Talejū cult\) and the choice of the *rājaguru* from the ranks of the Upādhyas \(today’s Rājopādhyāyas\).

[^86]: See Regmi, *Medieval Nepal*, vol. 3, Appendix III, p. 71, cf. p. 62 \(inscription of NS 804\); Viśvanāth is still mentioned in the year 786 \(living in Bakanihma\); see Thyāsaphu in *Medieval Nepal*, vol. 3, Appendix III, p. 69, where the *agnihotra yajamāna*, and the Svanihma and Olanihma localities are also mentioned. Later Patan Rājopādhyāyas are Siṃhadeva, whose son Harihara Śarmā \(Garga Gotra\), and his grandson Vaṃśidhara Sarma, an *agnihotri*, who also lived in Bamlanimha, is attested in 836 \(see *Journal of the Nepal Research Centre*, vol. 1\); one Ratnadhara Śarmā, probably a descendant, is attested in 876. Another son of Harihara Śarmā is Parśurāma Śarmā, who became the *rājaguru*, and his son Cakrapāṇi Śarmā, who is attested in NS 866, carried out an *ayutāhuti*, and lived at Omraniṃha Tol. More historical data in Sharma, *Agiṃmathaḥ.yā aitihāsik sāmagrī*; Regmi, *Medieval Nepal*, vol. 4, with inscriptions from 1524 to 1768 C.E.; Bajracharya, *Madhyakālin.kā Abhilekh.*

[^87]: Cf. Witzel, “On the History and the Present State of Vedic Tradition in Nepal,” pp. 36–[^37].

[^88]: I heard from a member of the *agnihotrī* clan \(who had trained abroad\) the following account: it is said that the fire burning in the *agniśālā* burns with a different \(lower\) intensity if there is a fire somewhere in the city; in such a case Agni would have already left his house \(cf. *Ṛgveda Saṃhitā* 1.1.8: \[*agnim*\] *vardhamānaṃ sve dame*\) and consequently, would burn with only a small flame in the temple. In the summer of 1973 the government palace, the Singha Darbar, was burned down; the fire lasted for about a week and could only be ended by blowing up the structure. The said member of the Agnihotrin told that, out of curiosity, he went to take a look at the temple to check whether the prophecy was correct \(from this one can recognize his scientific education\) and in fact, Agni burned with a very low flame; it was thought that he was destroying all the government papers, which floated away for miles, as far away as to our house in Swayambhu.

[^89]: See Witzel, *Zur Geschichte der Rājopdhyāyas von Bhaktapur*, p. 161 n. 12; compare András Höfer, *The Caste Hierarchy and the State in Nepal: A Study of the Muluki Ain* \(Innsbruck: Universitätsverlag Wagner, 1979\).

[^90]: See Todd Lewis and Naresh Bajrācārya, “Newar Buddhist *Homa* Ritual Traditions,” in this volume.

[^91]: That is, ca. 1982. In the meantime, the ritual changed after the death of the last *agnihotrin,* Viṣṇujvālānand, in 2004. Bal Gopal Shrestha reports: “when Vishnu Jwalananda passed away we could arrange recording the funeral rituals and follow-up rituals afterward. Later, when they installed a new Agnihotrī I was there with a Dutch anthropological film maker to record all the procedures… . We plan to make documentaries in four parts from the materials we have recorded. We also have obtained all texts from Patan priests, and even received translation of some Sanskrit texts into Newar language” \(email of December 28, 2010\). He adds: “Vishnu Jwalananda served as Agnihotra for 22 years and passed away in 2004. Kabijananda Rajopadhyay succeeded him in November 2004. Kabijananda passed away in 2007 and Padmaraj Rajopadhyay became the new Agnihotra, but this occasion no detailed rituals were performed as it was in 2004, because they kept the existing structure. This year, as Padmaraj passed away, and Brijendra Rajopadhyay is entering as a new Agnihotra tomorrow, I was told that only a few rituals will be performed as it was in 2007” \(email of November 27, 2012\). My friend François Voegeli adds \(May 13, 2014\), based on a recent visit, that the “current Agnihotrī is Vipendrarāj Rājopādhyāya, who holds office together with his wife Kamalādevī \(phone 984 966 9767\). He is 89 years old and lives in front of Pim Bahal Pokhari. He is the eldest of the Rājopādhyāyas belonging to the Svanimha Kavaḥ \(a list of these six kavaḥ is given in Nijiros Śreṣṭha, p. 18\). Agnihotrī Vipendrarāj is not practising the morning and evening ritual anymore. The latter is entrusted to the following five Rājopādhyāyas: Oṃkānta Rājopādhyāya, Baskārbālānanda Rāj., Pūrṇacandrānanda Rāj., Mohanśarma Rāj., Govinda-\(/Govīndra-?\)śarma Rāj. None of the Rājopādhyāya that now perform the Agnihotrawill become the next Agnihotrī. The next Agnihotrī will be the eldest of the members of the 6 kavaḥ. … AgnihotrīVipendrarāj is involved only in the “big” festivals at the Agnimāth. Contact address: Sanjay Sharma \+977 1 553 4305, e-mail: Sanjay1910@live.com.”—As I could indeed ascertain during short visit in July 2009, there is no longer a permanent *agnihotrin* but various *rājopādhyāya*s serve in turn to keep the ritual going. This procedure is not unknown among the Newars in other ritual contexts, where the role of the leading sponsor or priest is transferred to another person each year. Thus, the hope is well founded that this ritual will endure the onslaught of modernization for some time to come. \(The new Agnihotri is Vipendrarāj Rājopadhyāya and his wife is Kamalādevī; as per email by François Voegeli, April 30, 2014; he adds that a committee has been formed to try to have the UNESCO declare Patan’s Agnimath a World Heritage\). Indeed, the Patan Brahmins have now grasped the technical opportunities offered by the internet and have opened \(Oct. 2012\) a Facebook page \([https://www.facebook.com/Agnishala](https://www.facebook.com/Agnishala)\), where they publish periodical updates and photos of the yearly cycle of rituals and festivals, including a list of Agnihotrins going back to 1652 CE. -- Who would have thought so in 1975, or even 1985, when I last did some extensive research there? Also, there now is a small illustrated book \(56 pp, in Newari\) on many aspects of the Agnimaṭh: Nijiroś Śreṣṭha, *Yala.yā Agiṃ Matha.* Yala \[Patan\]: Bijaya Prakashan: NS 1133 \[2013 CE\]; nijiros@hotrnail.com.

[^92]: This prediction has come true with the abolishment of the monarchy in 2008. Nevertheless, most of the rituals and festivals of the Kathmandu Valley continue unabated, with the president of Nepal having taken over the role of the king; even staunchly Maoist party leaders are seen to sport *tilaka*s and perform or take part in certain rituals.
