## INTRODUCTION

Brahmanism developed various forms of external fire oblation rituals from the beginning of its history.1 Meanwhile, some traditions in Brahmanism \(especially the Upaniṣadic tradition\) attempted to internalize fire oblation rituals and developed various theories on the internal practice of fire oblation.2

The same attempt can be seen in Buddhist esoteric traditions. The *Mahāvairocana-sūtra* \(ca. seventh century\) is the oldest Buddhist scripture that systematically teaches inner forms of fire oblation. Several esoteric scriptures \(i.e., tantras\) compiled after the *Mahāvairocana-sūtra* expound a variety of different kinds of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation. For example, in his *Jyotirmañjarī*, Abhayākaragupta \(eleventh to twelfth centuries\) presents a typology of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation: \(1\) mental fire oblation \(*yid kyi sbyin sreg*\), \(2\) internal fire oblation \(*nang gi sbyin sreg, adhyātmahoma*\), and \(3\) supreme fire oblation \(*bla na med pa’i sbyin sreg*\). He further divides internal fire oblation into: \(2\)-1 internal fire oblation by use of external matters \(*phyi rol gyi rdzas kyis nang gi sbyin sreg, bāhyavastunādhyātmahoma*\), and \(2\)-2 internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matter \(*phyi rol gyi rdzas la ma ltos pa’i nang gi sbyin sreg*\).3 This typology is not perfect. There are other Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation that do not fall into either category, or that are mixtures of these types. \(However, this typology is useful to a certain extent if we take it as a list of elements of practice that constitute actual types of inner fire oblation rather than as a list of actual types of inner fire oblation.\)

This essay analyzes structures of Buddhist systems of “psychosomatic fire oblation” developed between ninth and thirteenth centuries in South Asia, and through this analysis draws a comprehensive picture of them. Systems of psychosomatic fire oblation can also be found in Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism,4 and constitute an important component throughout South Asian traditions of fire oblation.

“Psychosomatic fire-oblation” is not a native term. Many of the Buddhist scriptures that teach this type of fire oblation call it “internal fire oblation” \(*adhyātmahoma, nang gi sbyin sreg*, or the like\). However, there are other scriptures that do not use the term “internal fire oblation.” Moreover, there are many works that use the term “internal fire oblation” to indicate other types of fire oblation. Hence, I have coined the term “psychosomatic fire oblation” in order to avoid confusion. By “psychosomatic” I mean “of subtle-body yoga,” or “of a circle of channels.” Psychosomatic fire oblation, that is, yogic fire oblation based on the subtle body, roughly corresponds to Abhayākaragupta’s category of internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters, and it also contains elements of meditation that constitute Abhayāyakaragupta’s third category, supreme fire oblation, as well as elements that are not considered in his typology.5

Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation in South Asia have not been fully studied. Yael Bentor conducted a relatively comprehensive study of forms of inner fire oblation \(including psychosomatic fire oblation\) in India and in Tibet. While this study is no doubt a great contribution and was really helpful for me to research forms of inner fire oblation, there are some problems, especially in her analysis of Buddhist versions of inner fire oblation in South Asia. Some important materials are omitted and her interpretations appear to depend more on the views of the Indian scholar-monk Abhayākaragupta \(which were summarized in the second paragraph of this introduction\) and some Tibetan scholar-monks \(who were probably affected by Abhayākaragupta’s views\) than on the texts of Buddhist tantras and related works composed in South Asia.6 Bentor is correct in describing some later scholarly views, but I would like to attach the same importance to the tantra texts and related works in South Asia.



## THREE ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE STRUCTURES OF PSYCHOSOMATIC FIRE OBLATION SYSTEMS

Three elements form the structure of psychosomatic fire oblation practices in esoteric Buddhism: the practice of oblation, nonconceptual meditation, and subtle-body yoga. We will consider these elements before examining the instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation given in Buddhist scriptures.



### Oblation Practice: Internalization of a Standard Ritual Form of Fire Oblation

A standard ritual form of fire oblation, often called “external fire oblation” \(*bāhyahoma*\), is divided into four kinds \(or more\) according to its function: the pacifying \(*śānti*\) rite, the prospering \(*puṣṭi*\) rite, the bewitching \(*vaśya* or the like\) rite, and the subjugating \(*abhicāra* or the like\) rite. Psychosomatic fire oblation does not have these ritual categories. Nevertheless, the standard ritual form of fire oblation served as a model for the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. A practitioner uses external ritual items such as a hearth \(*kuṇḍa*\), a fire \(*agni* or the like\), and big and small ritual ladles \(*pātrī* and *sruva*, etc.\), firewood \(*samidh* or *samidha*\), fuel \(*indhana*\), and various offered articles in the standard ritual form of fire oblation. In psychosomatic fire oblation all of these items are internalized, that is, equated with components of the practitioner’s body and mind.

The idea that fire oblation is performed to gratify deities is also incorporated into the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation, with a modification from the yogic viewpoint. The *Subāhuparipṛcchā* \(ca. sixth century\) offers a concise explanation of this basic mechanism: “Deities become satisfied through the fire oblation. They bring fruits as hoped.”7 As described in the *Subāhuparipṛcchā*, the mechanism of gift-giving is premised upon a widely accepted idea underlying many ritual systems, that practitioners and deities are distinguished from each other in terms of their ritual roles. To some degree preserving this ritual idea, the idea that the practitioner and the deities are ultimately undivided is emphasized in the system of psychosomatic fire oblation. From this viewpoint, oblations to deities are simultaneously oblations to the practitioner.



### The Fire of Gnosis: Nonconceptual Meditation

Just as a fire burns fuel \(wood\) into ashes, so gnosis \(*jñāna*\) destroys sins, defilements, and all worldly concerns. In this analogy, fire has often been regarded as a symbol of gnosis in both Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions since the ancient age.8 Conversely, some ancient Brahmanical \(Upaniṣadic\) scriptures put forward the idea that knowledge of ultimate reality formed the essential part of fire oblation rituals in general. The earliest case of this is found in the *Chāndogyopaniṣad*, according to which knowledge of the universal Self \(*vaiśvānarātman*\) makes an oblation universal and that burns up all bad things in the practitioners of the rite.9

The idea that knowledge of ultimate reality constitutes the heart of fire oblation practice became prevalent and was combined with the idea of the fire metaphor of gnosis. The Buddhist *Mahāvairocana-sūtra* teaches a contemplation of nonconceptual reality as a superior form of fire oblation practice, calling it “the internal fire oblation” \(*nang gi sbyin sreg*\). In this practice, gnosis is called “nonconceptualizing wisdom” \(’*phro ba med pa’i shes rab*\) or “mental fire” \(*yid kyi me*\). Fire in this practice does not mean an actual material fire but refers to one’s mind in a meditative state. Through this contemplative fire oblation, concepts produced from and dependent on the mind, such as sensory objects and the process of their perception, are counteracted and disintegrated by the mind in a meditative state.10 A similar teaching appears in many Buddhist scriptures composed after the *Mahāvairocana-sūtra*,11 in which metaphoric fire is called “the fire of gnosis” \(*jñānānala, jñānāgni, ye shes me*\) or the like.



### **The Subtle Body, or the Circle of Channels

The Sāṃkhya religio-philosophical tradition in Brahmanism is probably the oldest tradition that uses the term “subtle body” \(*sūkṣmaśarīra*\) to indicate the collective body of one’s mental and physical functions \(such as speaking, holding, hearing, touching, thinking, etc.\). It can be defined as the functional or spiritual body. One’s subtle body works within the gross \(physical\) body \(*sthūlaśarīra*\), and together they constitute an individual being. The subtle body plays a vital role in both the ordinary activities of one’s life and in one’s spiritual training. Tantric traditions \(both Buddhist and non-Buddhist\) incorporated this idea of the subtle body and developed tantric forms of it.

Much importance was given to the “channels” \(also translated as veins or arteries, *nāḍī*\), and theories of the subtle body centered around these channels were developed.12 There are said to be seventy-two thousand channels in one’s body. Channels are bodily pathways through which various substances, such as “winds” \(*prāṇa*, etc.\) and other body substances carried by the winds move, or they are the movements of these substances per se. One’s mental and physical activities are closely connected with movements of body substances in \(or as\) channels. Thus, meditation on channels and the movement of body substances through them is an important practice.

As is well known, the *Hevajra-tantra* \(ca. eighth century\) is the first Buddhist scripture to systematically expound the subtle-body system centered on channels. In Buddhism the term “circle of channels” \(*nāḍīcakra*\) is more general than the term “subtle body.” There are three principle channels: *avadhūtī, lalanā*, and *rasanā. Avadhūtī* is the supreme channel, running along the vertical centerline of one’s body from the head to the abdomen. The *lalanā* and *rasanā* run on the left and right sides of the *avadhūtī*, respectively. These three channels run through lotus-shaped *cakra*s \(wheels or circles\), each with a different number of petals. *Cakra*s are areas in the body where many channels gather together.

There are different theories regarding the *cakra*s found in Buddhism. Theories closely related to the psychosomatic fire oblation are the four-*cakra* theory and the six-*cakra* theory, especially the former. The four *cakra*s are the “great bliss *cakra*” \(*mahāsukhacakra*\) in the head, the “enjoyment *cakra*” \(*saṃbhogacakra*\) in the throat, the “Dharma *cakra*” \(*dharmacakra*\) in the heart, and the “creation *cakra*” \(*nirmāṇacakra*\) in the navel area. The six *cakra*s are these four together with the “fire *cakra*” \(*vahnicakra*\) below the creation *cakra*, and the “wind *cakra*” \(*vāyucakra*\) below the fire *cakra.*13

Winds, body fluids, and other bodily substances move in the *cakra*s through channels. Particular types of body fluids are called “awakening mind” \(*bodhicitta*\), “immortal nectar” \(*amṛta*\), “*soma*” \(*soma* or *somapāṇa*\), “semen” \(*retas*\), and so forth. These are fluid essences symbolizing enlightenment, inner alchemical essences, and/or inner sources of superhuman power. When a practitioner performs yoga based on his subtle body or circle of channels, he ignites a yogic subtle fire or inner heat in his body through breath control and concentration. The yogic subtle fire or inner heat is called either Caṇḍālī or the name of the highest goddess in each scriptural tradition. The yogic subtle fire moves through the channels and *cakra*s and heats them, and they then secrete the body fluids mentioned above, such as “awakening mind,” and so on.

Composers of Buddhist tantras applied this technique of subtle-body yoga to various kinds of practices in different ways and developed varieties of yogic practices based on the subtle body. A well-known \(and the oldest\) example is the yoga of perfection process \(*utpanna-*/*niṣpanna- krama*\) connected with the fourfold bliss \(*caturānanda*\) theory taught in the *Hevajra-tantra*. Through this yoga a practitioner attains nondual reality in the form of bliss, called “innate bliss” \(*sahajānanda*\) or “great pleasure” \(*mahāsukha*\).14 Other examples are some versions of the yoga of creation process \(*utpattikrama*\), the psychosomatic *bali* offering, and so forth. Psychosomatic fire oblation is also an example of an application of subtle-body yoga.



### Sexual Intercourse and Its Internalization

Early Buddhist tantras, such as the *Guhyasamāja-tantra* and others, teach many practices employing sexual substances, including the physical practice of sexual yoga. Particular versions of psychosomatic fire oblation are also carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga between a male practitioner and his female partner\(s\). In these versions, his bodily substances and penis are respectively equated with clarified butter \(ghee\) and a ladle to offer it, and his female partner’s vagina is regarded as a hearth or sacrificial ground. The idea that sexual intercourse has the significance of fire oblation appears in ancient Brahmanism. The *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* teaches:

\[The essence\] of man is semen. Prajāpati \(i.e., the Creator\) then thought to himself: “Now, why don’t I prepare a base for that semen?” So he created woman and, after creating her, had intercourse with her. A man, therefore, should have intercourse with a woman. Prajāpati stretched out from himself the elongated stone for pressing Soma \(i.e., the penis to ejaculate semen\) and impregnated her with it. Her vulva is the sacrificial ground; her pubic hair is the sacred grass; her labia majora are the Soma-press; and her labia minora are the fire blazing at the center. A man who engages in sexual intercourse with this knowledge obtains as great a world as a man who performs a Soma sacrifice, and he appropriates to himself the merits of the women with whom he has sex.15

Having children to continue one’s family line is an obligation \(*dharma*\) of adult males of the twice-born class in Brahmanism. In order to have children, he must marry an appropriate woman and have intercourse with her. The passage in the *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* explains sexual intercourse as an obligation derived from the creative deed of the Creator, having the same significance as a *soma* sacrifice \(a Brahmanical fire oblation ritual\). In contrast, Buddhist versions of sexual psychosomatic fire oblation are not intended for twice-born males to fulfill Brahmanical dharma. They are instead intended for male Buddhist *tāntrika*s to make oblation to deities through nonconceptual meditation, as discussed later. However, the Brahmanical idea that righteous copulation has the significance of fire oblation appears to have assisted the development of the idea of the physical practice of sexual yoga as a practice of Buddhist fire oblation.

Sometime shortly after the eighth century, composers of later Buddhist tantras preserved this practice to a certain extent by internalizing sexual practices. This was an attempt to resolve the contradiction between monastic vows of celibacy and engaging in sexual practices, which occurred as tantric traditions originating outside monasteries were incorporated into monastic Buddhism. The same attempt can be said of some versions of psychosomatic fire oblation in which the physical practice of sexual yoga is not a necessary component. Generally such internalized sexual practices equate female partners with channels, a particular *cakra* \(or *cakra*s\), and/or the yogic subtle fire in the male practitioner’s body. Alternatively, in some versions of psychosomatic fire oblation the metaphor of the penis as an offering ladle and the female partner’s vagina as a hearth are identified, respectively, with a particular channel and *cakra* in the male practitioner’s body.



## MATERIALS

Except for works that give only brief or obscure explanations, which therefore make it difficult to know details of the practice or to judge with certainty whether they really explain this type of fire oblation, available textual sources suggest that Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation appeared around or after the ninth century. The next discussion examines the structures of Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation, using mainly the following six works that provide the most detailed descriptions:

[^1]: The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* \(the *Hevajra* scriptural cycle\).16

[^2]: The *Vajramālā-tantra* \(the *Guhyasamāja* scriptural cycle\).

[^3]: The *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* \(the *Hevajra-Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\).17

[^4]: The *Vajraḍāka-tantra* \(the *Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\).

[^5]: The *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* \(the *Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\).

[^6]: Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi* \(the *Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\).

Because many of the instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation given in minor Buddhist works are identical with, or similar to, the instructions given in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* and the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*, and especially those given in the former text, the instructions in these works can be considered to be the most popular in South Asian Buddhism.18 We first investigate the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* \(1\) and the *Vajramālā-tantra* \(2\), then the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* \(3\) and the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* \(4\), and finally the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* \(5\) and the *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi* \(6\). This order is followed for the following reasons:



•Instructions on the psychosomatic fire oblation in the six works can be grouped into two in terms of the differing ways of performance: texts 1 and 2 show the first way of performance, and texts 3, 4, 5, and 6 show the second. It is also possible to group them into three in terms of the differing manner of internalization of ritual items: 1 and 2 show the first, 3 and 4 the second, and 5 and 6 the third.

•The instruction in text 2 is very likely to be a redaction of the instruction in text 1. Text 6 is an extensive manual of fire oblation based on the instruction on fire oblation in text 5.

•It is difficult to determine whether the instruction in text 2 or those in numbers 3, 4, and 5 were composed earlier,19 but we can say that the former instruction reflects the older idea of sexual practices \(i.e., as a physical practice of sexual yoga\) and the latter instructions reflect the newer idea \(i.e., as an internalized or symbolized form of sexual practice\). Additionally, text 5 is later than 3 and 4, because it mentions the names of both those texts.20



## THE *MAHĀMUDRĀTILAKA* AND THE *VAJRAMĀLĀ*

### Instructions

The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* \(chapter 11\) and the *Vajramālā-tantra* \(chapter 60\) explain the psychosomatic fire oblation as follows.



#### 1. *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*

Now, listen to the next \[instruction\].21 I will explain the fire oblation that \(1\) *removes sins*.

The sound \(*nāda*\) is in the navel area. The secret lotus \(*guhyapaṅkaja*\) is in the end of the sound.22 Having caused the self-dependent wind \(*svatantrapavana*\) of the reed \(i.e., channel\) to move in a circle in that \[navel area\], and through excellent fusion of the two forces \(*dvīndriya*\),23 he ignites \(2\) *a fire* \(*tejas*\) and reflects on \[it\]. The *cakra* in the top filled with clarified butter \(*ājyapūrṇacakrāgra*; i.e., the great bliss *cakra* in the head\) is taught to be a bowl \[for clarified butter\] \(*sthālikā*\). And also, the letter HA is explained to be a big ritual ladle \(*srukka*\).24 The *vajra* \(i.e., penis\) is taught to be a small ritual ladle \(*sruvā*\) in this \[system\]. The *bhaga* \(i.e., vagina\) is known as a hearth \(*kuṇḍa*\), and the five sense faculties \(*pañcendriya*\) as rice \(*vrīhi*\). The \[five\] aggregates \(*skandha*\) are firewood \(*samidha*\). The awakening mind \(*bodhimānasa*\) is the best-quality clarified butter \(*ājya*\).

From the new moon day up to the full moon day he should perform \[this sexual practice\] and send \[the awakening mind into the vagina-hearth\]. \(3\) *He should never spill the drop-only \(bindumātra, i.e., the awakening mind\) outside of the hearth by means of the small ritual ladle*. \(4\) *One should please with oblation those such as the buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, dānavas, rākṣasas, and the eight great world-protectors. An offering to Vajrasattva is taught to be an oblation with a full ladle \(pūrṇāhuti\)*. The oblation should be made carefully with mantras, which are *hūṃ* and *phaṭ* placed on the moonstone \(i.e., the practitioner visualizes the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ on the tip of his *vajra*\).25 \(5\)*Ḍākinīs and many Mothers in this \[place of performance or system\] are appeased through this*. \(6\) *They grant a great accomplishment \(mahāsiddhi, such as supernatural powers\), which is desirable and hoped in mind*.

Thus has been explained this fire oblation, which \(7\) *realizes all \[accomplishments\]*.

Thus is the eleventh chapter on the internal fire oblation \(TTP: “the fire oblation in the real”\) in the glorious *Mahāmudrātilaka*.



#### 2. *Vajramālā-tantra*

Now, listen to the next \[instruction\].26 I will explain the eminent internal fire oblation, in accordance with which he should constantly perform the marvelous fire oblation by means of substances moving inside which are fluid \(i.e., the awakening mind\); by means of fuel \(*bud shing*\), which are the five aggregates \(*phung po lnga*\) born out of the subliminal impressions of \[past\] discrimination \(*rnam rtog bag chags sa bon*\); and by means of \(1\) *the fire of great yogic gnosis \(rnal ’byor ye shes chen po’i me\)*.

The sound \(*sgra tsam*\) is in the navel area. The external of the sound is a secret lotus \(*gsang pad ma*\).27 In that \[navel area\], by the fire ignited with the self-dependent wind \(*rang rgyud rlung*\) \[and through\] the fusion of the two forces \(*dbang po gnyis*\),28 the light shines brightly. The secret lotus in the top filled with clarified butter \(*rtse mar gang gsang pad ma*; i.e., the great bliss *cakra* in the head\) is proclaimed to be a bowl \[for clarified butter\] \(*snod*\) in this \[system\]. The letter HAṂ is explained to be a big ritual ladle \(*dgang gzar*\). The *vajra* \(*rdo rje*, i.e., the penis\) is taught to be a small ritual ladle \(*blugs gzar*\). The *bhaga* \(*bha ga*; i.e., the vagina\) is known as a hearth \(*thab khung*\), and the five sense faculties \(*dbang po lnga*\) as an offered article \(*bsreg rdzas*\). The \[five\] aggregates are firewood \(*yam shing*\). Clarified butter \(*mar*\) is explained to be the awakening mind \(*byang chub sems*\).

From the new moon day up to the full moon day he should perform \[this sexual practice\] and send \[the awakening mind to his penis-ladle inserted into the vagina-hearth\]. \(2\) *The hearth is explained to be drop-only \(thig le tsam,* i.e., *the awakening mind\). The small ritual ladle never spills out*. \(3\) *One should be pleased through the incessant fire oblation to the buddhas, Moharati and so on, bodhisattvas such as Rūpavajra and so on, and the ten krodharājas \(“furious kings”\). An offering to Vajrasattva is taught to be an oblation with a full ladle \(dgang blugs\)*. The oblation should be made according to prescription with mantras having *hūṃ* and *phaṭ* \(i.e., the practitioner visualizes the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ on the tip of his *vajra*\).29 \(4\)*If those residing in the body are appeased through this,* \[*there will be*\] *the supreme samaya* \(*dam tshig*\),30 *having been granted an accomplishment* \(*dngos grub\) as he hopes in mind*.

This fire oblation is explained to be the highest. \(5\)\[*It*\] *brings all accomplishments as fruits*.

The sixtieth chapter on the internal fire oblation in the glorious *Vajramālābhisamayamahāyoga-tantra*.

Psychosomatic fire oblation is called “internal fire oblation” \(*adhyātmahoma,* according to the Sanskrit manuscript\) or “fire oblation in the real” \(*don dam pa’i sbyin sreg;* \**paramārthahoma*, according to the Tibetan translation\) in the last paragraph of the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra.* It is called “internal \(*nang gi bdag nyid*\) fire oblation” in the second and last paragraphs of the *Vajramālā-tantra*. We will now examine the passages just translated, using other chapters of both tantras that give related information as supporting materials. \(The italicized words or sentences with subscripts in the translation above are referred to in the following examination as “line 1,” “line 2,” etc.\)



### Internal Forms of Ritual Items

Internal forms of ritual items are described in the second paragraph in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* and the first and second paragraphs in the *Vajramālā-tantra* \(summarized in table 1\).


TABLE 1.  
THE *MAHĀMUDRĀTILAKA* AND THE *VAJRAMĀLĀ* SYSTEMS
Items of fire oblation *Mahāmudrātilakatantra* *Vajramālātantra*  Bowl for clarified butter *Cakra* in the topa Secret lotus in the topa   Big ritual ladle HA-letterb HAṂ-letterb   Small ritual ladle *Vajra* \(Penis\)c   Hearth *Bhaga* \(Vagina\)c   \[1\]‌ Rice/Offered article Five sense faculties   \[2\]‌ Firewood Five aggregates   \[3\]‌ Clarified butter Awakening mind   \[4\]‌ Fuel — Five aggregates   
a The *cakra* or secret lotus in the top means the great bliss *cakra* in the head.

b The letter HAṂ is at the center of the great bliss *cakra* in the head. The letter HAṂ consists of “HA” and “Ṃ \(*anusvāra*\).” The HA-part of the letter HAṂ is identified with a big ritual ladle in the *Mahāmudrātilakatantra*.

c The pair of opposite words *vajra* and *bhaga* is important in esoteric Buddhism. These two words have many meanings. The primary meaning of these two words is penis and vagina, respectively. It is most likely that their meanings in the teachings translated above are also the penis of a practitioner and the vagina of his female partner\(s\) because prescriptions on ejaculation are given \(: line 4 in the *Mahāmudrātilakatantra* and line 2 in the *Vajramālātantra*\). Gambhīravajra’s *Guhyārthaprakāśa* also interprets the *vajra* and *bhaga* as the penis and vagina.


A small ritual ladle and a hearth are the *vajra* \(i.e., the penis\) and the *bhaga* \(i.e., the vagina\), respectively: the psychosomatic fire oblation is carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga between a male practitioner and his female partner\(s\) in these two tantras. The duration of time appropriate for this practice is from the new moon day up to the full moon day \(i.e., “the white half of a month,” considered the auspicious half of a month\). It is probable that this practice is performed in some sort of tantric festival where male and female *tāntrika*s \(tantric practitioners\) gather during the auspicious part of a month; it is also probable that a practitioner performs it privately with his female partner during that time.

The texts give only brief explanations of some of the steps constituting the entire process of this practice. However, it is possible to reconstruct the outline of the entire process as follows. Having visualized the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ on the tip of his penis \(i.e., a small ritual ladle\), a male practitioner has sex with his female partner\(s\). Through the union of their genital organs the practitioner controls the movements of the winds in his body and ignites the yogic subtle fire. The yogic subtle fire blazes upward, burning up concepts such as “the five sense faculties” \(i.e., rice or offered articles\) and “the five aggregates” \(i.e., firewood and fuel\) that the practitioner conceives. Then the yogic subtle fire heats the great bliss *cakra* in his head \(i.e., a bowl for clarified butter\). The great bliss *cakra* has the letter HAṂ \(i.e., a large ritual ladle\) at its center. When heated by the yogic subtle fire, the *bindu* \(“drop”\) of the *candra-bindu* part \(i.e., the Ṃ part\) of the HAṂ letter is refined into the body fluid “awakening mind” \(i.e., clarified butter\), and it flows out of the great bliss *cakra* through the HA part of the letter HAṂ \(i.e., a large ritual ladle\). The awakening mind flows downward in his body. He offers the awakening mind to the vagina of his female partner\(s\) \(i.e., hearth\) through his penis \(i.e., the small ritual ladle\).

The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* and the *Vajramālā-tantra* offer different views regarding whether the practitioner ejaculates the “awakening mind” into his partner’s vagina in the last step of the sexual yoga. The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* seems to teach that the practitioner should ejaculate into the vagina without fail \(line 3\). On the other hand, the *Vajramālā-tantra* rejects ejaculation \(line 2\). The latter opinion accords with the general opinion in Buddhist traditions of sexual yoga. The intention of the latter tantra is probably that sexual intercourse while keeping the awakening mind in the penis is the righteous practice of oblation.31

As shown in table 1, things that are offered are grouped into three in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* \(1, 2, 3\) and into four in the *Vajramālātantra* \(1, 2, 3, 4\). From this classification we can interpret that psychosomatic fire oblation has two aspects: as a practice of oblation and as a nonconceptual meditation. \(3\) The awakening mind \(i.e., inner clarified butter\) is offered to the female partner’s body hearth and, through that hearth, to recipient deities. \(1\) How to offer the “five sense faculties” \(i.e., inner rice, or inner offered articles excluding clarified butter\) is not explained in the texts, but it can be inferred that the practitioner’s concept “five sense faculties” is burned up by his yogic subtle fire and is offered through that fire to recipient deities.32 These are practices of oblation. The concepts “five sense faculties” and “five aggregates” \(i.e., inner firewood and fuel\) \(1, 2, 4\) that the practitioner conceives are burned up and disintegrated by the yogic fire. This is therefore a practice of nonconceptual meditation.

The concepts “five sense faculties” and “five aggregates” are Buddhist frameworks of the elements that constitute an individual self. This suggests that the practitioner renounces his erroneous attachment to the concepts that frame his own self by means of nonconceptual meditation on the yogic subtle fire. The yogic subtle fire is named “the fire of great yogic gnosis” \(a variant name of “the fire of gnosis”\) in the *Vajramālā-tantra* \(line 1\), while it is merely called “fire” in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* \(line 2\). The term “the fire of great yogic gnosis” is probably intended to emphasize its function of disintegrating concepts.



### Recipients of Oblation

#### Recipients in the *Mahāmudrātilaka*

The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* mentions deities \(or holy human beings\) who receive, or are pleased with, inner oblations in lines 4 and 5. Buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, *dānava*s, *rākṣasa*s, the eight world-protectors, and Vajrasattva are spiritual leaders, followers, or protectors of Buddhism, respectively. They reside in various places of the universe.33 “*Ḍākinī*s and mothers in this” are probably both human and spiritual female participants at the place of performance, especially the female partner \(or partners\) of the practitioner, who receives the “awakening mind” from the practitioner through sexual yoga. Indeed, these deities or holy human beings are outside the body of the practitioner. However, for the practitioner, they are undivided from himself both epistemologically and ontologically. The key deity is Vajrasattva. Chapter 10 of the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, which gives general information about practices of internal oblation, reads:

\[The external\] ceremony of installation, *maṇḍala*, and fire oblation; he should never perform this. He should always make oblation to himself by means of \[bodily substances such as\] feces, adamantine water, jewel, and so on because what exists in this \[universe\] are evidently representations of the mind, which is the mind-*vajra*. This All \(i.e., the universe\) is of good reflection, a manifestation of the mind-*vajra*. Its form … \(text unreadable; TTP has “Its manifested form \[as object\] is not the mind \[itself\]”\) and is of the characteristic of emptiness, and since emptiness is not also perceived as object, All is like the sky. Even a man who thus knows the purity should respect … \(text corrupted; TTP reads “channels and so on, too”\). Thus All consists of the mind. There is nothing besides the mind. He is himself Lord Vajrasattva. He should wander in the form of the mind. Besides the mind, there is no being that is the highest in the form of a deity.34

Since all beings are none other than the practitioner’s mind, that is, the mind-*vajra* \(which is, however, ultimately empty\), what the practitioner should do is practice oblation as oblation to himself as Vajrasattva, using his own bodily substances. This explains well the logic of psychosomatic fire oblation. Vajrasattva is the tantric lord or the ideal type of tantric practitioner, on the one hand, and is the practitioner himself, on the other. Since the practitioner knows the truth of the mind-*vajra*, all outer recipient deities \(or holy human beings\) are, for him, within himself. The practitioner’s self-oblation has universal effect because his mind is of a universal nature.

What, then, is the relationship between the realization of that inclusive mind and nonconceptual meditation \(i.e., renunciation of erroneous attachment to concepts that frame one’s individual being\)? The text does not clearly explain this relationship. However, it can be inferred that the former meditative state of mind is attained helped by the latter meditation because the latter meditation by means of the yogic subtle fire starts before the inner oblation which is done in the former meditative state.

I argue that the recipient *ḍākinī*s and mothers were female partner\(s\) of the practitioner. It may also be posited that the same *ḍākinī*s and mothers are channels in the practitioner’s body for the following reasons: The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* has an idea that channels are internal forms of *ḍākinī*s \(it gives detailed explanation of the circle of channels in chapter 4: channels running through the six *cakra*s\).35 The passage in chapter 10 translated above proclaims, “Even a man who thus knows the purity should respect *channels* and so on.”36

Fruits that can be attained through the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation are mentioned in lines 1, 6, and 7. Lines 5 and 6 relate that accomplishments \(such as supernatural powers and superhuman experiences\) are given to the practitioner by the *ḍākinī*s and mothers in return for his service to them. It is possible to interpret this as follows: Externally, the *ḍākinī*s and mothers as female participants of this practice give accomplishments to the practitioner by their superhuman power. Internally, accomplishments are the results of the practitioner’s self-empowerment: the *ḍākinī*s and mothers as channels in his body become increasingly active through this practice, which results in the development of his inner spiritual powers.37



#### Recipients in the *Vajramālā*

The *Vajramālā-tantra* explains the idea that the practitioner and the recipient deities are inseparable, using the idea of the body *maṇḍala*.38

The *Vajramālā-tantra* mentions buddhas, Moharati and so on, bodhisattvas such as Rūpavajra and so on, the ten furious kings, and Vajrasattva as deities who receive inner oblations \(line 3\) and describes them as “those residing in the body” \(line 4\). We can identify these recipient deities with the deities constituting a body *maṇḍala* \(*lus kyi dkyil ’ khor*\) expounded in chapter 45 of the same tantra.39 The structure of this body *maṇḍala* is formed by the traditional Buddhist frameworks of an individual being: \(1\) the five aggregates \(*phung po*, \**skandha*\), \(2\) the five material causes \(\**dhātu*\), \(3\) the twelve bases of experience \(*skye mched*, \**āyatana*\), \(4\) channels \(*rtsa*, \**nāḍī*\), \(5\) gnosis \(*ye shes*, \**jñāna*\), and \(6\) other elements of the body \(*lus kyi chos rnams*, \**kāyadharma, dhātu*, or the like\). These frameworks correspond to the five buddhas \(1\), the five *vidyā*-goddesses \(i.e., Moharati and four others\) \(2\), twelve bodhisattvas \(i.e., Rūpavajrā and eleven others\) \(3\), Maitreya Bodhisattva \(4\), Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva \(5\), and the ten furious kings \(6\), respectively. Chapter 64 of the same tantra also illustrates a body *maṇḍala* \(*sku yi dkyil ’ khor*\) that has almost the same structure as the body *maṇḍala* in chapter 45.40 In chapter 64, all the *vidyā* goddesses, bodhisattvas, and the ten furious kings constituting the body *maṇḍala* are titled Bhagavat or Tathāgata, and the body *maṇḍala* is defined as a collective body of perfect buddhas \(*rdzogs pa’i sangs rgyas*\) and as the body of Vajrasattva.41 The body *maṇḍala* described in these two chapters can be summarized as shown in table 2. \(The Sanksrit names of the deities were restored by consulting the *Guhyasamāja-tantra*, Candrakīrti’s *Pradīpodyotana*, some other texts of the Guhyasamāja tradition that have parallel or similar passages, and Abhayākaragupta’s *Vajrāvalī* and *Niṣpannayogāvalī*.\)

f TTP reads reg bya’i rdo rje \(: masculine sparśavajra\).

g The text gives the name of its deity, but the object represented by this deity is not mentioned. Hence I supplemented.


The five aggregates, the five material causes \(forming the form aggregates\), the six sense faculties \(in the twelve bases of experience\), channels \(interpretable as “sinews” in this context\), gnosis, joints, and the other elements of the body are frameworks of an individual human being; the five material causes and the six sense objects \(in the twelve bases of experience\) are frameworks of the outer world; and all these frameworks of existence constitute the body *maṇḍala*, which is Vajrasattva, that is, the practitioner himself. Thus, the body *maṇḍala* is a concept to explain the practitioner as a universal being that includes outer existences within. We can infer that the practitioner becomes aware of his own existence as a body *maṇḍala* through the nonconceptual meditation \(i.e., renunciation of erroneous attachment to concepts framing one’s individual being\) discussed above.

The fruits that can be attained through this practice are mentioned in lines 4 and 5. Line 4 explains that these fruits are given to the practitioner by the recipient deities in return for his service to them. As previously mentioned, the recipient deities are indivisible from the practitioner, and we can therefore interpret this give-and-take relationship as the practitioner’s self-empowerment.



## THE *SAṃPUṭODBHAVA* AND THE *VAJRAḍāKA*

### Instructions

The *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* \(chapter 6.3\) and the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* \(chapter 44\) explain psychosomatic fire oblation as follows:



#### 3. *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*

Fire oblation42 is performed in \(1\) *the fire of wisdom* \(*prajñāgni*\), which is shining greatly, by use of offered articles \(*havis*\) that are both internal, such as the semen and other \[bodily substances\] \(*śukrādya*\), and external, such as the form and other \[sense objects\] \(*rūpādi*\). \(2\)\[*This practice*\] *is proclaimed to be yogic oblation especially to those in the forms of deities, i.e., the six bases of experience* \(*ṣaḍāyātana*\), *the material causes* \(*dhātu*\), *and the aggregates* \(*skandha*\), *and also to ḍākinīs because they are made oblation to through that* \[*practice*\].

The skull bone in the head \(*śiraḥkapāla*\)—this is explained as a bowl for offered articles \(*havirbhājana*\). \[The channel named\] *rasanā* is known as a small ritual ladle \(*sruva*\). A large ritual ladle \(*pātrī*\) and \[its\] mouth \(*vaktra*\) are taught as the embodiment of \[the channel named\] *lalanā* and the *cakra* in the heart \(*hṛccakra*\). And a hearth \(*kuṇḍa*\) is the circle in the navel area \(*nābhimaṇḍala*\). The fire of Brahman \(*brahmāgni*\) is fanned with the wind of action \(*karmamāruta*\) and resides at the *trikaṭi* \(i.e., the abdominal point where the three channels join together\). *Mantra* is explained to be sound \(*nāda*\). Recitation \(*japa*\) should be cycling \(*āvartana*\). Visualization \(*bhāvanā*\) is manifestation \(*pratibhāsa*\) through nondual identification with the *maṇḍala*.

This \[practice\] is based on the innate \(*sahaja*\) and is of the nature of the Jinas’ *maṇḍala*. \(3\) *The mind-king* \(*cittarāja\) is a teacher* \(*ācārya*\) *because of* \[*its*\] *function as a superintendent of the maṇḍala*. All \[practices\] such as this sort should be understood in this very \[body\] as \[above\] explained.



#### 4. *Vajraḍāka-tantra*

\[The supreme goddess\]43 is fanned with the wind of action \(*karmamāruta*\) as \(1\) *the fire of gnosis* \(*jñānāgni*\) *whose fuels* \(*indhana\) are the* \[*five*\] *aggregates and other* \[*mental constructs*\] \(*skandhādi*\). She is blazing on this circle in the navel area \(*nābhimaṇḍala*\). \(2\)\[*She is*\] *the fire of Brahman* \(*brahmāgni*\) *standing at the trikaṭi* \(i.e., the abdominal point where the three channels join together\). A large ritual ladle \(*pātrī*\) is \[the channel named\] *lalanā*. A small ritual ladle and \[its\] mouth \(*sruvānana*\) is declared to be \[the channel named\] *rasanā*. A bejeweled *vajra* attached to \[the lower end of\] the handle \[of the ladle\] \(*daṇḍadharatnavajra*\) is, that is to say, one’s *kuliśa* \(i.e., penis\). A bowl for the offered article \(*havirbhājana*\) is the skull bone \(*kapāla*\), and all offered articles should be offered.44 This process is performed.

\[Thus\] explained to you. O, goddess\! This is indeed the supreme \[form of\] fire oblation. When performed in this way, \(3\) *one attains firm meditation, and it does not diminish*. This method is proclaimed to be common to all tantras.

No particular name is given to the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*. It is called “the supreme” \(*niruttara*\) form of “the internal fire oblation” \(*adhyātmahoma*\) in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*.45 Supporting materials in this section are Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī*, a commentary on the *Saṃpuṭodbhavatantra*, and his *Jyotirmañjarī* \(along with Naoji Okuyama’s study of them\),46 and other chapters of both tantras that give related information.47 The type of inner fire oblation that Abhayākaragupta calls “internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters” refers to the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*.



### Internal Forms of Ritual Items

a The *Vajraḍākatantra* mentions offered articles in the skull bone in the head, but it does not detail them.

b According to Abhayākaragupta, the Rasanā channel is the handle part of a small ritual ladle and its mouth part is the lotus in the throat \(i.e., the enjoyment *cakra*\) in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*.

c According to Abhayākaragupta, the Lalanā channel is the handle part of a big ritual ladle and its mouth part is the *cakra* in the heart \(i.e., the Dharma *cakra*\) in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*.

d According to Abhayākaragupta, a bejeweled *vajra* is attached to the lower ends of both Rasanā and Lalanā. However, unlike the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*, he relates that the bejeweled *vajra*, along with a hearth, is situated in the navel area.

e The *Vajraḍāka-tantra* does not explain clearly which bodily area is the hearth. We can construe the circle in the navel area as the hearth because it is the only area in the body that produces fire in this practice. However, it is not always necessary to interpret that the place of ignition of fire in the body is an inner hearth: the place of ignition of fire is the navel area in the body of a male practitioner, while an inner hearth is the vagina of a female partner in the texts of the first group as we observed in the previous section of this essay; and the place of ignition is the soles of the feet of a practitioner, while inner hearths are bodily areas above the foot-soles in the *Ḍākārṇava* system of psychosomatic fire oblation \(as will be investigated in the next subsection of this essay\). Hence, I wrote “Circle in the navel area” with round brackets in the table.

f According to Abhayākaragupta, it is the sound of the blazing of this yogic subtle fire.

g According to Abhayākaragupta, it means to repeat this practice of blazing yogic subtle fire.

h According to Abhayākaragupta, it means manifestation of the body *maṇḍala*.


Internal forms of ritual items in these two tantras can be summarized as shown in table 3. The offered article in the skull bone \(i.e., the great bliss *cakra* in the head\) is the body fluid, which Abhayākaragupta calls “the awakening mind.” The body fluid represents both bodily substances \(semen and so on, internal offered articles\) and external objects \(the five sense objects, external offered articles\) in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*.48

Concepts \(such as the five aggregates, etc.\) are equated with fuel for the fire in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*. These concepts are burned up and disintegrated by the yogic subtle fire, which is called “the fire of gnosis” \(line 1\) and “the fire of Brahman” \(line 2\). On the other hand, the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* does not mention fuel, nor does it clearly mention the meditative disintegration of the five aggregates and other concepts except for the sense objects. However, the yogic subtle fire is called “the fire of wisdom” \(line 1\). This appears to suggest that in this practice of fire oblation the practitioner renounces his erroneous attachment not only to the sense objects but also to the five aggregates \(and other concepts\). This interpretation is supported by Abhayākaragupta’s comment that the function of the fire of wisdom in this practice is “to dispel whole darkness of discrimination completely.”49Unlike in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* and *Vajramālā-tantra*, a small ritual ladle and a hearth are not respectively equated with the genital organs of a male practitioner and his female partner\(s\) in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* or *Vajraḍāka-tantra*. As shown in table 3, a small ritual ladle, a large ritual ladle, and a hearth are identified with the *rasanā* channel, the *lalanā* channel, and the circle in the navel area where these two channels join together \(i.e., the creation *cakra*\), respectively. All these channels and the navel *cakra* exist in the practitioner’s body. The physical practice of sexual yoga is not an indispensable component of the practices of psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* or *Vajraḍāka-tantra*,50 although there may be cases in which a practitioner performs sexual yoga as a practice that supports controlling the movements of the winds to ignite the yogic subtle fire in his body, as Abhayākaragupta suggests.51 However, the physical practice of sexual yoga does not serve as a framework for the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation in these two tantras.

We can draw an outline of the practice as follows: A practitioner controls the movements of the wind of action in his body and ignites the yogic subtle fire on the circle in his navel area \(i.e., the creation *cakra*\). The yogic subtle fire, which Abhayākaragupta calls “Caṇḍālī,” blazes upward. In the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* the yogic subtle fire, “the fire of gnosis,” burns up and disintegrates all concepts such as the five aggregates and so on, of which the practitioner conceives. The yogic subtle fire heats up the skullbone in the head \(i.e., the great bliss *cakra*\). When heated, the skullbone in the head produces the body fluid, which Abhayākaragupta calls “the awakening mind.” In the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*, the body fluid symbolizes both internal body substances and external objects \(“the five sense objects”\). Then the body fluid flows downward in the practitioner’s body. According to Abhayākaragupta, the body fluid flows downward through the central channel, *avadhūtī*, passing through the throat *cakra* \(i.e., the enjoyment *cakra*\) and the heart *cakra* \(i.e., the Dharma *cakra*\), which are the mouth of an inner small ritual ladle \(i.e., the mouth of the *rasanā* channel\) and the mouth of an inner large ritual ladle \(i.e., the mouth of the *lalanā* channel\), respectively. Finally the body fluid flows into the creation *cakra* \(i.e., the inner hearth\).



### Recipients of Oblation

#### Recipients in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava*

The recipients of inner oblations are the deities that represent the six bases of experience, the material causes, and the aggregates and *ḍākinī*s in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* \(line 2\). They constitute a body *maṇḍala*; Abhayākaragupta comments that they are inner deities and that the *ḍākinī*s are channels.52 The names of these deities are given in chapter 5.2.53 Table 4 shows the body *maṇḍala*.

It has almost the same structure as the body *maṇḍala* in the *Vajramālā-tantra* \(table 2\).54 The body *maṇḍala* is superintended, or represented, by the mind \(i.e., the mind-king\) of the practitioner \(line 3\). Abhayākaragupta comments that the mind \(i.e., the mind-king\) means the nondual mind, which he calls “the awakening mind-*vajra*” \(*byang chub sems rdo rje*\).55 It is probably of the same kind as the mind-*vajra* in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, in which the practitioner and outer deities are indivisible. This meditative state of the body *maṇḍala* is probably experienced with the help of nonconceptual meditation on the fire of wisdom.

Fruits of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation are not mentioned in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*. According to Abhayākaragupta, its fruit is the perfection of “supreme bliss.” He explains the “internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters” \(i.e., the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*\) as “a means for perfection of the supreme bliss” \(*mchog tu dga’ ba phun sum tshogs pa’i rgyu*\) in his *Jyotirmañjarī*.56 He seems to have done so based on the following facts: the subtle-body yoga, in the form of the yoga of perfection process, serves as a means for attaining nondual reality in the form of bliss; the subtle-body yoga constitutes the basis of the “internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters” and the sequence of practice of this fire oblation is similar to that of the yoga of perfection process, although the psychosomatic fire oblation and the yoga of perfection process are taught separately in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* and should not be completely equated.



#### Recipients in the *Vajraḍāka*

The *Vajraḍāka-tantra* does not mention recipient deities. Indeed, we find in chapter 1 an explanation of a *maṇḍala* of deities whose structure is quite similar to the body *maṇḍala* in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* shown in table 4.57 In chapter 14, the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* teaches that *ḍākinī*s are channels and that the body *maṇḍala* is the circle of channels.58 But these deities and *ḍākinī*s are not described as the recipients of the oblations in the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. Nevertheless, the lack of description of recipient deities is not a shortcoming of this teaching but simply marks the nature of the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*.


TABLE 4.  
THE BODY *MAṆḌALA* IN THE *SAṂPUṬODBHAVA-TANTRA*

![images](images/00014.jpeg)


First, in its instruction on the psychosomatic fire oblation, the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* does not mention any concept, such as the body *maṇḍala* or the like, that frames a practitioner’s existence to include outer existences within it. Second, the yogic subtle fire is defined as the fire of gnosis that burns up concepts such as the five aggregates and so forth \(line 1\). Third, a fruit of this fire oblation practice is the attainment of firm meditation that does not diminish \(line 3\). From these we can interpret that the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* is a yogic practice to attain the meditative state of nonconceptual reality, rather than being a practice of oblation. The body fluid meditated in this fire oblation can be interpreted to be an inner source of experience of nonconceptual reality, rather than an inner article to offer deities.

I argue that integration of a practice of oblation and nonconceptual meditation into subtle-body yoga constitutes the structure of psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, the *Vajramālā-tantra*, and the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*. On the other hand, with regard to the practices of oblation and nonconceptual meditation, the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* emphasizes the latter, and the former practice is not manifest. The psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* appears to be close to the meditation of perfection process, the highest meditation whose purpose is not to make oblations but to attain ultimate reality. This may be why psychosomatic fire oblation is taught to be the “supreme” form of internal fire oblation in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*.



## THE DḌĀKĀRNṆAVA SYSTEM

#### 5. The *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*

The *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* explains psychosomatic fire oblation in chapter 24. No particular name is given to this practice. The instruction is as follows:59

What is related to all tantras is explained since \[it is\] being taught a little.

A hearth manifested in the navel area is round \(1\). A square \[hearth\] is in the heart \(2\). A triangular hearth is in the private part \(3\). A hexagonal \[hearth\] is at the urethral orifice \(4\). A heptagonal \[hearth\] is in the throat \(5\). An octagonal \[hearth\] is in the head \(6\). An enneagonal \[hearth\] is between the eyebrows \(7\). A pentagonal \[hearth\] is in the tuft of the head \(8\). A decagonal \[hearth\] is in the forehead \(9\). \[These hearths are\] rooted in \[the areas\] where winds come.



One should make oblation of all the body substances \(*dhātu*\) by carriage of wind. At the time of performance in this very way, the wise \[use\] little external \[matter\]. *Lalanā* and *rasanā* are the two \[ritual ladles\], i.e., a large ritual ladle \(*sruci*\) and a small ritual ladle \(*sruva*\) respectively. *Avadhūtī* is a bowl for clarified butter \(*ājyasthālī*\). \(1\)\[*Each*\] *hearth is each interval of her*. \(2\) *He should perform the all-effective fire oblation* \(*sārvakarmikahoma*\) *in this moment*. He should make oblation of all offered articles to that without hesitation.


TABLE 5.  
THE *ḊĀKĀRṆAVA* SYSTEM

![images](images/00003.jpeg)


Internal forms of ritual items can be summarized as shown in table 5. All items of fire oblation are internalized in the body of a male practitioner; the physical practice of sexual yoga is not an indispensable process in the psychosomatic fire oblation of the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*.

The two tantras investigated earlier \(namely, the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* and the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*\) and the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* have in common the idea that the left and right channels, the *lalanā* and *rasanā*, are the internal forms of a large ritual ladle and a small ritual ladle, respectively. The same can be said of the body substances, which are defined as inner offered articles in these scriptures. However, the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* identifies a bowl for clarified butter with the central channel *avadhūtī,* while all the other tantras we have examined here equate it with the great bliss *cakra* in the head. However, the former identification and the latter identification do not contradict each other, for *avadhūtī* originates in the great bliss *cakra* in the head, and is that through which the body fluid in the great bliss *cakra* is offered to the inner hearth.

All the other tantras we have examined mention only one inner hearth; the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*, however, elaborates nine inner hearths \(second paragraph\). These nine hearths each have a different shape. They are located along the vertical centerline of the body in order and are linked together by the central channel, the *avadhūtī* \(line 1\),60 as shown in table 5. In other passages in chapter 24, the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* expounds the features of nine external hearths used in the external fire oblation ritual. The first eight external hearths have different ritual functions: pacifying \(*śānti*\), prospering \(*puṣṭi*\), bewitching \(*vaśya*\), subjugating \(*abhicāra*\), expelling \(*uccāṭana*\), estranging \(*vidveṣa*\), paralyzing \(*stambhana*\), and killing \(*māraṇa*\), respectively. The ninth hearth is effective for all eight of these functions \(*sarvakarma*\).

The nine internal hearths have the same shapes as the nine external hearths. We can therefore say that the nine internal hearths are interiorized forms of the nine external ones, and, for this reason, it is very likely that the different ritual functions ascribed to the nine external hearths are implicitly ascribed to the nine internal ones. The text says that this practice is “all-effective,” that is, effective for all kinds of actions \(line 2\). It is very likely that the psychosomatic practice of fire oblation is said to be all-effective because the practitioner visualizes in his body all of the nine hearths that comprise eight different functions.61

The explanation on psychosomatic fire oblation given in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* lacks detailed information on the sequence of practice. Padmavajra’s *Vohitā*, a commentary on this tantra, gives only a brief comment and is not useful.62 Details of the sequence can be found in Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*, a manual of both external and internal fire oblations in the *Ḍākārṇava* system. Jayasena calls psychosomatic fire oblation “the internal fire oblation” \(*nang gi sbyin sreg*\) and defines it as “the yoga of Caṇḍālī” \(*gtun mo’i rnal ‘byor*, i.e., “the yoga of inner subtle fire”\).63 Jayasena’s instruction on the internal fire oblation is next.



#### 6. Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*

Now I will explain the internal fire oblation.64

A practitioner, who applies himself most diligently to the internal, sits on a soft and wide seat. Having aroused compassion for all sentient beings, he transforms himself through meditation into Saṃvara, who is accompanied by Vārāhī of one face and two arms, in an instant.

There is a disk of wind produced from \[the letter\] YAṂ on the soles of the feet and a disk of fire from \[the letter\] RAṂ on that \[disk of wind\]. Subsequently, a hearth manifested in the navel area is round \(1\). A square \[hearth\] is in the heart \(2\). \[A triangular hearth is in the private part \(3\)\]. A hexagonal \[hearth\] is at the urethral orifice \(4\). A heptagonal \[hearth\] is in the throat \(5\). An octagonal \[hearth\] is in the head \(6\). An enneagonal \[hearth\] is between the eyebrows \(7\). A pentagonal \[hearth\] is in the tuft of the head \(8\). \[A decagonal hearth is in the forehead \(9\)\].65 Having meditated that all have the appearance of a channel-hearth in this way, he contemplates that \[the letters\] HŪṂ of blue color and VAṂ of red colo[^66] are put together at the centers of all \[those hearths\]. He illuminates well \[the body areas\] between the tuft of the head and the penis, which are linked together by the *avadhūtī* channel and which are accompanied by the right and left channels \(i.e., *rasanā* and *lalanā*\).

Then he ignites a fire with the wind \[blowing\] on the soles of the feet through the yoga of controlling upward and downward \[movements of the\] wind.

He refines the awakening minds of all channels in the body, draws \[them\] into the right and left channels, and makes \[them be\] absorbed into \[the letter\] HAṂ at the top of the *avadhūtī* through those two channels. Subsequently, by means of those flowing down through the *avadhūtī,* \[that is to say,\] by means of oblation with a full ladle of the awakening minds to the flaming hearths, he fills all \[those hearths with the awakening minds\]. Contemplating that \[the awakening minds\] also spread into all channels in the body, he performs without interruption the yoga of collecting \[the awakening minds\] again. He will achieve all aims.

This is what is supreme among all. Having been taught by the master who had had the instruction, \[it\] was not concealed by me. Thus is the section of the internal fire oblation.

The yogic sequence of the internal fire oblation expounded in these passages can be summarized as follows: \(1\) transformation of the practitioner through meditation into the highest deity Saṃvara, in whose body the internal fire oblation is practiced \(second paragraph\); \(2\) visualization of an inner place of ignition \(a fire disk and a wind disk on the soles of his feet\), nine inner hearths, an inner bowl \(i.e., the *avadhūtī*\), and inner ritual ladles \(i.e., the *lalanā* and *rasanā*\) \(third paragraph\); \(3\) ignition of the yogic subtle fire \(fourth paragraph\); and \(4\) production of the body fluids called “the awakening mind” and oblation of them to the inner hearths \(fifth paragraph\). The first and second steps are preparatory meditations. The third step is the starting of the fire oblation. The fourth step is the performance of oblation. All the awakening minds are produced from channels throughout the body, are gathered to the letter HAṂ in the great bliss *cakra* in the head, and are offered to the inner hearths through the *avadhūtī* from the great bliss *cakra.*

Through this practice, it is said, the practitioner achieves all aims. This appears to reflect the words in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* that this fire oblation practice is all-effective \(line 2 in the passages of the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* translated earlier\).

In the opening verses of his *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*, Jayasena declares that fire oblation is a means for delighting deities who appear in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra:*

“I will explain the fire oblation \(i.e., both the external fire oblation and the internal fire oblation\), which is a means for delighting deities of the glorious *Ḍākārṇava* and which is an oral instruction by many masters from this tantra.”67

How, then, are the recipient deities and the practitioner related? This is not clear. Jayasena does not use the idea of a body *maṇḍala* for framing the practitioner’s own being as inclusive of recipient deities. \(Probably he followed the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*, which does not mention a body *maṇḍala* in its teaching of psychosomatic fire oblation.\) He does not mention the idea of the mind that includes outer deities within it \(like the mind-*vajra* in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*\). The practitioner transforms himself through meditation into the highest deity Saṃvara in the first step of this practice. Saṃvara may have the same function as Vajrasattva of the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*. If so, the practitioner in the form of Saṃvara is inclusive of outer deities.

No matter what the actual relationship between recipient deities and the practitioner might be, it can be safely stated that the practice of oblation is an important element of the psychosomatic fire oblation in Jayasena’s manual, and what is emphasized as the purpose of this practice is that oblation to the deities brings achievement of all aims. On the other hand, the element of nonconceptual meditation is not articulated in this manual.



## CONCLUSION

In Buddhism, the *Hevajra-tantra* is the first scripture that systematized psychosomatic yoga, that is, the yoga based on one’s subtle body \(i.e., one’s circle of channels\). In tantras composed after the *Hevajra-tantra*, the technique of subtle-body yoga was applied to various kinds of practices in different ways. Psychosomatic fire oblation is an example of these applications of subtle-body yoga. This essay examined instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation given in \(1\) the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, \(2\) the *Vajramālā-tantra*, \(3\) the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*, \(4\) the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*, \(5\) the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*, and \(6\) Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*. Figure 1 shows a conclusion drawn from this examination.

FIGURE 1. Psychosomatic fire oblations in six works


The elements that comprise structures of practices of psychosomatic fire oblation in these six works are the practice of oblation, nonconceptual meditation, and subtle-body yoga. Subtle-body yoga is the basis. Through subtle-body yoga the practitioner carries out both a practice of oblation and nonconceptual meditation, or specifically either one of these two. The six works have different views on how to practice subtle-body yoga \(i.e., the manner of performance of the ritual\), how to interpret components of the subtle body \(i.e., the manner of internalization of ritual items\), and how to organize the practice of oblation along with nonconceptual meditation on that basis.



### Ways of Performance

Systems of psychosomatic fire oblation in the six works outlined can be grouped into two, in terms of the differing ways of performance.

The fire oblation in works 1 and 2 are carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga. A practitioner must perform it from the new moon day up to the full moon day, that is, the auspicious half of a month \(suggesting that it is an auspicious practice\). The sexual fire oblation explained in works 1 and 2 is probably carried out at some sort of tantric festival held during this auspicious term where male and female *tāntrika*s gather, or it is practiced privately between a male practitioner and his female partner during this time.

On the other hand, the physical practice of sexual yoga is not an indispensable process in works 3, 4, 5, and 6. There may be cases in which a practitioner performs sexual yoga as a practice that supports controlling the movements of the winds to ignite the yogic subtle fire; however, this is not a framework of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. The appropriate time and place for such practice is not prescribed in these works.

Like the *Guhyasamāja-tantra*, early Buddhist tantras teach many sexual practices, including the physical practice of sexual yoga. Composers of later Buddhist tantras sometime shortly after the eighth century attempted to reshape some of the sexual practices into more internal forms that do not require the practice of sexual yoga. If instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation in works 1 and 2 are chronologically older than those in works 3 to 6, it is very likely that the change in the manner of performance from the former to the latter works is related to the attempt of the composers of later tantras to internalize the sexual practices. However, we do not have enough evidence to prove that the instructions in works 1 and 2 were really composed earlier than those in the other works. We can therefore describe the history of psychosomatic fire oblation as follows: this practice took two forms, that is, psychosomatic fire oblation carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga, which is related to the early tantric tradition of sexual yoga; and the more internal form of psychosomatic fire oblation, which is likely the result of certain composers of later tantras to internalize sexual practices.



### Ways of Internalization of Ritual Items

In the external fire oblation ritual clarified butter \(ghee\) is offered to a ritual fire in a hearth by means of ritual ladles. These ritual items are internalized in different ways in the six works and can be grouped into three types.

According to works 1 and 2, in which psychosomatic fire oblation is carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga, a male practitioner offers his “clarified butter in a bowl” \(i.e., the body fluids produced in the great bliss *cakra* in his head\) to his female partner’s “hearth” \(i.e., the vagina\) by means of a “large ritual ladle” \(the letter HA or HAṂ in the great bliss *cakra*\) and “small ritual ladle” \(penis\). Ejaculation is done in work 1, while it is prohibited in work 2; that is to say, the seminal fluid is not released from the penis inserted into the partner’s vagina.

All ritual items are internalized in the body of a male practitioner in works 3 and 4, in which the physical practice of sexual yoga is not a framework of the entire process of the psychosomatic fire oblation. A practitioner offers his “clarified butter in a bowl” \(body fluids produced in the great bliss *cakra* in his head\) through the *avadhūtī* channel to his internalized “hearth” \(the creation *cakra* in the navel area\) by means of the “small ritual ladle” \(the *rasanā* channel \[with the enjoyment *cakra* in his throat according to Abhayākaragupta\]\) and the “large ritual ladle” \(the *lalanā* channel \[with the Dharma *cakra* in his heart according to Abhayākaragupta\]\).

As in these works, all ritual items are also internalized in the body of a practitioner in works 5 and 6, in which sexual yoga is not a necessary practice. A bowl for clarified butter and clarified butter are the *avadhūtī* channel \(at the top of which the great bliss *cakra* is located\) and body fluids \(which flow through the *avadhūtī* from the great bliss *cakra*\), respectively. The two ritual ladles are the *lalanā* and the *rasanā* channels. The body fluids are produced in all channels throughout the body and are gathered to the letter HAṂ located at the center of the great bliss *cakra* through the *lalanā* and *rasanā.* There are nine inner hearths, internalized forms of the nine hearths for eight functions used in the external fire oblation ritual. These nine inner hearths are located along the vertical centerline of the body and are linked together by the *avadhūtī* channel. A practitioner offers his “clarified butter in a bowl” \(body fluids that flow through *avadhūtī* from the great bliss *cakra*\) to the “nine hearths” \(the nine inner hearths\) by use of the “large ritual ladle” \(*lalanā*\) and “small ritual ladle” \(*rasanā*\).





### **A Practice of Oblation, Nonconceptual Meditation, and Subtle-Body Yoga

There are two principal elements of practice that constitute systems of psychosomatic fire oblation: the practice of oblation and nonconceptual meditation. From this viewpoint we can group the systems in the six works into three: In works 1, 2, and 3, the integration of a practice of oblation along with a nonconceptual meditation into subtle-body yoga constitutes the structure of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. In work 4 the practice of oblation is not specifically mentioned, and nonconceptual meditation is emphasized. The position of work 5 is not clear because of its lack of description. In work 6 the practice of oblation is emphasized, while nonconceptual meditation is not mentioned specifically.

Fruits mentioned in the six works are both mundane and supermundane: in work 1, the removal of sins; in works 1 and 2, the attainment of accomplishments \(*siddhi*, i.e., supernatural power or superhuman experience\); in 4, the attainment of firm meditation that never diminishes; in 6, the achievement of all aims such as pacifying, prospering, and so on. Works 3 and 5 do not mention fruits. According to Abhayākaragupta, a fruit of the practice in work 3 is perfection of “supreme bliss,” which indicates some level of experience of nondual reality in the form of bliss.

The practice of oblation can be explained as follows: Offering oblations to deities who reside in various places in the universe can be considered the core element of the external ritual form of fire oblation. The fire god Agni consumes external offered articles and transmits them to deities residing in heavens. Oblation to deities takes the form of oblation to the practitioner himself \(i.e., self-oblation\) in systems of psychosomatic fire oblation. This does not mean that deities residing in various places in the universe cease to be the recipients of these oblations. Recipient deities are ultimately contained within a practitioner: they are idealized as being within the practitioner’s meditational expansion or meditative absorption. Concepts used in the six works that frame one’s existence in this way are the mind-*vajra* \(or the mind-king\), the body *maṇḍala* \(or the circle of channels\), and/or Vajrasattva \(or his other form, Saṃvara\). The yogic subtle fire, which is the inner Agni, consumes internally offered articles and transmits them to the practitioner, who contains the recipient deities within himself.

The practice of nonconceptual meditation can be explained as follows: Various concepts, such as “the five aggregates,” of which a practitioner conceives are the firewood and fuel. The yogic subtle fire, which is the inner Agni, burns up and disintegrates this fuel. A practitioner renounces his erroneous attachment to concepts by means of meditation on the yogic subtle fire. The yogic subtle fire is called “the fire of gnosis” \(or the like\) in this aspect of psychosomatic fire oblation because of its function of disintegrating concepts. It can be inferred that one’s inclusive self described earlier is realized with the help of nonconceptual meditation on the yogic subtle fire in works 1, 2, and 3, in which the practices of oblation and nonconceptual meditation are combined.

[^3]: Abhayākaragupta’s *Jyotirmañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 3142, 161a3–b3, Otani 3963, 198b1–b6. Base studies of the *Jyotirmañjarī* were conducted by Naoji Okuyama, who published a Sanskrit edition of the *Jyotirmañjarī* based on an incomplete Sanskrit manuscript, “*Jyotirmañjarī* no Kenkyū \(I\),” *Bunka* \[*Culture*\] 47/1–2 \(1983\): 29–46, and “*Jyotirmañjarī* no Kenkyū \(II\),” *Indogaku Shūkyōgaku Kai Ronshū* 13 \(1986\): 1–18. In his other papers, Okuyama argued Abhayākaragupta’s view on fire oblation practices. Tadeusz Skorupski published a translation of the entire text of the *Jyotirmañjarī* using Okuyama’s edition and Tibetan translations: “*Jyotirmañjarī*: Abhayākaragupta’s Commentary on *Homa* Rites,” *Mikkyō Bunka Kenkyūjo Kiyō* \[*Bulletin of the Research Institute of Esoteric Buddhist Culture*\] 8 \(1994\): 206–236. The Sanskrit text of section II \(1\) of the *Jyotirmañjarī* \(i.e., the internal fire oblation by use of external matters\) can be restored from Jagaddarpaṇa’s *Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya*. A draft edition of the Sanskrit text is presented in Tsunehiko Sugiki, “The Consumption of Food as a Practice of Fire-Oblation in Esoteric Buddhism in Medieval South Asia,” *International Journal of South Asian Studies* 3 \(2010\): 74 n. 30. In this “The Consumption of Food” paper, I examined the type of inner fire oblation that I call “fire oblation of food,” which roughly corresponds to Abhayākaragupta, section II \(1\), and which also contains elements of Abhayākaragupta, section III.

[^4]: For a Śaiva Śrīkula example, see Katsuaki Ida, “Tantorarāja ni okeru Homa Girei,” *Shakai Kankyō Kenkyū* 8 \(2003\): 13–23. For a Vaiṣṇava Pāñcarātra example, see Hiromichi Hikita, *Hindū Tantorizumu no Kenkyū* \(Tokyo: Sankibō Butsu Shorin, 1997\), pp. 193–195.

[^5]: Elements that are not considered in Abhayākaragupta’s typology are the physical practice of sexual yoga and elements of meditation related to it. For these, see section four \(THE *MAHĀMUDRĀTILAKA* AND THE *VAJRAMĀLĀ*\) of this essay.

[^6]: Yael Bentor, “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet,” *Journal of the American Oriental Society* 120/4 \(October–December 2000\): 594–613. Bentor develops a new typology of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation, arguing for a type of inner fire oblation that was not considered in Abhayākaragupta’s typology. However, with regard to other types of inner fire oblation, Bentor’s typology is almost same as that of Abhayākaragupta. Bentor’s typology is as follows: I. “Fire offerings based on the inner heat and the subtle body as part of the Perfection Process,” which corresponds to Abhayākaragupta’s \(2\)-2; II. “Fire offerings of great bliss performed together with a consort, as in the third initiation,” which is omitted in Abhayākaragupta’s typology; III. “Food ritual, in which food is offered to the deities residing at one’s heart,” which corresponds to Abhayākaraguta’s \(2\)-1; IV. “Mental fire offerings,” which corresponds to Abhayākaragupta’s \(1\); and V. “Fire offerings of the Great Enlightened Wisdom which destroy ignorance, burn the *kleśa*s, and consume dichotomies,” which corresponds to Abhayākaragupta’s \(3\) \(Bentor, “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet,” p. 596\). Psychosomatic fire oblation roughly corresponds to Bentor’s I and II, and it also contains elements that constitute Bentor’s V. As Abhayākaragupta’s typology, Bentor’s typology appears to be a list of elements of practice that constitute actual types of inner fire oblation rather than as a list of actual types of inner fire oblation.

Problems in Bentor’s study \(pp. 596–601\) can be summarized as follows: First, I use as the main materials in my essay the following texts: \(1\) the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, \(2\) the *Vajramālā-tantra*, \(3\) the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*, \(4\) the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*, \(5\) the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*, and \(6\) Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*. The fundamental reason for Bentor’s study being insufficient is that she used only Tibetan translations of texts 1 and 4. Second, important elements that form structures of Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation are the practice of oblation, nonconceptual meditation, and subtle-body yoga, as I discuss in this essay. Bentor did not clarify these structures, as she did not develop a category of inner fire oblation that I call “psychosomatic fire oblation,” which is a major type of inner fire oblation both in Buddhism and non-Buddhist traditions in South Asia, as mentioned earlier. Finally, Bentor regarded types I and II of her typology as being similar to, or having nearly the same significance as, the third initiation and the yoga of perfection process \(*utpanna*-/ *niṣpanna-krama*\), respectively. While these two types are indeed similar in the respects that type II and the third initiation are forms of sexual yoga and that type I and the yoga of perfection process are forms of subtle-body yoga \(as is also examined in this essay\), we must also carefully consider the significance of their being taught as different practices in the tantras.

[^7]: *Subāhuparipṛcchā*, CT 895, 733b1–b2, 以呼摩故本尊歡喜 即便施與如意樂果. \(This passage appears only in its Chinese translation. It can not be found in its Tibetan translation. However, one passage found in Tohoku 805, 138b5-b6, and in Otani 428, 200a2-a3, may be a different reading of this passage.\) Similar passages can be found in scriptures compiled after the *Subāhuparipṛcchā*. For example, the *Māyājāla-tantra*, TTP: Tohoku 465, 129b7–130a1, Otani 102, 97b3. Text: *sbyin sreg gis ni lha rnams tshim* / *tshim par gyur nas dngos grub ster* / \(The deities become satisfied through \[the performance of\] the fire oblation. Having been gratified, \[these deities\] bring accomplishment\[s\]‌\). The same passage appears in the *Vajrahṛdayālaṃkāra-tantra* \(TTP: Tohoku 449, 46b4, Otani 86, 308b8\), which was composed later than the *Māyājāla-tantra*.

[^8]: For the fire of gnosis in the practice of inner fire oblation, see also Bentor, “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet,” pp. 605–606; Sugiki, “The Consumption of Food as a Practice of Fire-oblation,” pp. 56–57.

See also Stephen Hodge, *The Mahā-Vairocana-Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra with Buddhaguhya’s Commentary* \(New York: Routledge Curzon, 2003\), pp. 389–390 \(translation\); Sugiki, “The Consumption of Food as a Practice of Fire-oblation,” p. 57. The *Mahāvairocana-sūtra* teaches two kinds of internal fire oblation: a fire oblation practiced in the form of the meditation mentioned earlier, and an external ritual form of fire oblation that a practitioner performs while considering internally the identity of the nature of three constituents of fire oblation \(i.e., fire, practitioner, and offered article\) in terms of emptiness \(TTP: Tohoku 494, 228a2–a3; see also Hodge, *The Mahā-Vairocana-Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra*, p. 386 \[translation\]\). From the viewpoint of the second kind of internal fire oblation, a truly external form of fire oblation means an external ritual form of fire oblation that a practitioner performs without considering the identity of the nature of the three constituents.

[^11]: Jñānapāda’s *Mukhāgama*, TTP: Tohoku 1854, 27b7, Otani 2717, 32b2 \(*ye shes me ’bar ba yis phung po ni* / *sreg pa gang yin de ni bla med bshad* //. For this, see also Naoji Okuyama, “Indo Mikkyō Hōma Girei,” in Musashi Tachikawa and Motohiro Yoritomi, eds., *Indo Mikkyō* \(Tokyo: Shunjū Sha, 1999\), p. 191 n. 19. \(Probably Okuyama is the first scholar who pointed out the existence of this passage in the *Mukhāgama*.\) The following three works give a similar explanation: Kṛṣṇa’s *Hevajrahomavidhi*, TTP: Tohoku 1256, 277a3–a4, Otani 2385, 338b4; Saroruhavajra’s *Homavidhi*, TTP: Tohoku 1223, 23a6, Otani 2352, 27b2; and Abhayākaragupta’s *Jyotirmañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 3142, 161b3, Otani 3963, 198b5–b6. For some other works that hold the idea of the fire of gnosis that burns up the conceptual categories, see Tsunehiko Sugiki, “The *Homa* System of the *Vajraḍākatantra*: A Critical Edition and a Preliminary Analysis of its *Homa* System,” *Tantric Studies* 1 \(2008\): 134. These works often call fire oblation of this type “the supreme \[form of\] \(*niruttara, bla med*\) fire oblation.”

[^12]: The earliest teachings on channels can be found in old *Upaniṣad* scriptures such as the *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* and *Chāndogyopaniṣad*, compiled around the fifth century B.C.E. *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad*, Sanskrit ed. 4.2.3 and 4.3.20; *Chāndogyopaniṣad*, Sanskrit ed. 8.6.1–6. See also Olivelle, *The Early Upaniṣads*, pp. 109, 115, 279 \(translations\). The channels are also called Hitā in these two *Upaniṣad* texts, and the number of channels totals 101 according to the *Chāndogyopaniṣad*. Some sort of divine body fluid flows in the channels. One of the channels goes upward from the heart to the top of the head, and one’s soul \(or inner god\) moves to the top of the head through that channel.

[^13]: The theory of six *cakra*s mentioned here appears in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* and in the *Vajramālā-tantra*, two of the main source materials of this essay. \(See also n. 34.\) It differs from theories of the six *cakra*s found in the *Kālacakra* and *Jñānodaya* systems.

[^14]: The *Hevajratantra*, Sanskrit ed. I.8.30–36, etc. The first of the four types of bliss is simply “bliss” \(*ānanda*\), the second is “highest bliss” \(*paramānanda*\), the third is “renunciation bliss” \(*viramānanda*\), and the fourth is “innate bliss” \(*sahajānanda*\).

[^15]: The *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad*, Sanskrit ed. 6.4.1–3. Translation of the passages is from Olivelle, *The Early Upaniṣads*, p. 155. \(Interpolations and glosses are supplemented by me.\) See also the *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad*, Sanskrit ed. 6.2.13; the *Chāndogyopaniṣad*, Sanskrit ed. 5.8.1–2; Olivelle, *Saṃnyāsa Upaniṣads*, p. 28. After this instruction, the *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* gives an instruction on the way of retrieving one’s discharged semen, which also appears to have assisted the development of theories on the tantric Buddhist practice of *guhyābhiṣeka* \(“secret consecration,” the initiation rite in which a teacher transmits his semen to his disciple’s mouth with his thumb and ring finger\). The *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* \(Sanskrit ed. 6.4.4–5; Olivelle, *The Early Upaniṣads*, p. 155\) teaches as follows: When a man has discharged semen, whether in sleep or while awake, he should take the semen with his thumb and ring finger and rub it between his breasts or brows. By this he can retrieve his virility inherent in the semen. In a personal conversation, Einoo Shingo suggested that the passages given in the *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* can be read as instructions on the *garbhādhāna*, or impregnation, rite.

[^16]: The supreme \(*bla med*\) fire oblation in Kṛṣṇapādaś *Cakrasaṃvarahomavidhi* \(TTP: Tohoku 1447, 293a4–b1, Otani 2165, 363b3–365a3\) \(*Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\) may fall into the group of the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* and the *Vajramālā-tantra* because internal symbols in Kṛṣṇapāda’s work are quite similar to those in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* and *Vajramālā-tantra* \(see also Bentor, “Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet,” p. 600\). There is also a possibility that Kṛṣṇapāda’s supreme fire oblation is not a version of psychosomatic fire oblation because his work does not clearly mention the subtle-body system, the base element constituting psychosomatic fire oblation.

[^17]: The psychosomatic fire oblation taught in Kṛṣṇācārya’s *Vasantatilakā* \(Sanskrit ed. 8.20c–24\) and the *Herukādyavajravārāhīyogarājottamottamaparamarahasya* \(Sanskrit ms. in Kiyotaka Goshima and Keiya Noguchi, *A Succinct Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Possession of the Faculty of Letters* \[Kyoto: Kyoto University, 1983\], p. 133, 18a5–b3; both from the *Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\) are the same as that taught in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*. “The internal fire oblation with no recourse to external matter” \(*phyi rol gyi rdzas la ma ltos pa’i nang gi sbyin sreg*\) in Abhayākaragupta’s *Jyotirmañjarī* \(cross-traditional\) should be related to the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* because Abhayākaraguta states in his *Jyotirmañjarī* that he explained details of this type of fire oblation in his *Āmnāyamañjarī*, a commentary on the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*. The internal \(*adhyātma*\) fire oblation in Umāpatideva’s *Vajravārāhīsādhana* \(*Cakrasaṃvara* scriptural cycle\) may also be able to be related to the psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* \(Umāpatideva’s *Vajravārāhīsādhana*, Sanskrit ed. 51\); see also Elizabeth English, *The Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms* \(Somerville, MA: Wisdom Publications, 2002\), p. 221. The instruction given in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra* \(with Abhayākaragupta’s comment on it\) was examined by Naoji Okuyama, “Abhayākaragupta no Goma Shūhō \[The Practice of Homa of Abhayākaragupta\],” *Indogaku Bukkyōgaku Kenkyū* *\[Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies\]* 32/2 \(1984\): 105–106. As for outlines of all chapters in the *Saṃpuṭodbhavatantra*, see Tadeusz Skorupski, “The *Saṃpuṭa-tantra* Sanskrit and Tibetan Versions of Chapter One,” in Tadeuz Skorupski, ed., *The Buddhist Forum IV. Seminar Papers 1994–1996* \(London: School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 1996\), pp. 151–244.

[^18]: See n. 17.

[^19]: One passage in text 2 is quoted in Tantric Nāgārjuna’s *Pañcakrama* \(Nāgārjuna’s *Pañcakrama*, Sanskrit ed. 1.16.\). The *Pañcakrama* was composed at an early stage of the history of the Ārya school of the *Guhyasamāja* tradition \(i.e., ninth century\) and does not quote any passages from works 3, 4, and 5. This suggests the possibility that work 2 was composed earlier than works 3, 4, and 5, but this does not prove with certainty that work 2 is really earlier. First, the passage quoted in the *Pañcakrama* does not appear in the instruction on psychosomatic fire oblation. Second, there is also the possibility that the chapter that gives the instruction on psychosomatic fire oblation was not contained in the older version of work 2 used by Tantric Nāgārjuna. Alaṃkakalaśa’s \(or Alaṃkadeva’s\) *Gambhīrārthadīpikā*, a commentary on work 2 deals only with chapters 1–44 of the extant version of that text and gives no mention of chapter 60, in which the instruction on psychosomatic fire oblation under examination here appears.

[^20]: The names of scriptures mentioned in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* are *Guhyasamāja, Saṃvarottara, Saṃvara, Vajraḍāka, Herukābhyudaya, Tattvasaṃgraha, Vajrabhairava, Saṃpuṭa*, and *Laghusaṃvara*. For details, see Tsunehiko Sugiki, *Sanbara Kei Mikkyō no Shosō* \[Aspects of Saṃvara Esoteric Buddhism: Practitioner, Holy Site, Body, Time, and Death and Life\] \(Tokyo: Tōshindō, 2007\), pp. 17, 20.

[^21]: See Appendix, Source Text no. 1. Sanskrit or Tibetan texts of the translations of the works mentioned are found in the Appendix.

[^22]: What the terms “sound,” “navel area,” and “secret lotus” indicate is not clear, although it is doubtless that they represent some areas, or explain what is happening, in the body of the practitioner. Probably they explain what is happening around the *cakra* in the navel area of the male practitioner. In his *Guhyārthaprakāśa* \(TTP: Tohoku 1200, 137a3–138a7, Otani 2330, 150a2–151b1\), a commentary on the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, Gambhīravajra mentions some masters’ interpretations of these words: according to Mahāguhyavajra, the “navel area” means the heart of a secret lotus \(*gsang ba’i pa dma’i snying po*\), and according to Ḍombīpa it is the center of the lotus with sixty-four petals \(*’dab ma drug cu rtsa bzhi’i lte ba’i gnas*, probably indicating the creation *cakra* in the navel area\); according to Gambhīravajra’s teacher, the “secret lotus” means the petals of channels to be touched \(*reg bya’i rtsa’i ‘dab ma*, probably indicating a *cakra* somewhere in the body\); and the “sound” is the sound of the awakening mind \(*byang chub sems kyi sgra*\) according to Vīrabhūti \(*bī ra bhū ti* \[TTP: Tohoku\] and *bhi ra pu ti* \[TTP: Otani\]\). Based on these masters’ words, Gambhīravajra relates that the “sound” is momentary sound \(*blo bur ba’i sgra*\) and that “sound is located at the center of the ‘secret lotus.’” What Gambhīravajra wants to say here remains unclear.

[^23]: In Tanric Buddhism the phrase “fusion of the two forces” signifies the union of two opposite principles, such as union of wisdom and means, of female and male genital organs, the gathering of winds blowing in the left and right channels in a practitioner’s body, and so on.

[^24]: The letter HA means the “HA” part of the letter HAṂ that is visualized in the great bliss *cakra* in the head of a male practitioner.

[^25]: As for the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ placed on the moonstone, see the instruction on the third initiation \(*prajñājñānābhiṣeka*, “consecration of the gnosis of the wisdom female”\) in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*, Sanskrit ms. SB Hs or 8711, 5a1; *prāṇāyāmasamānatvāt suratenārcanaṃ punaḥ* / “*hūṃphaṭmantraṃ maṇimukhe nyastvā*” *vajraṃ pracālayet* // \[Note\] *maṇimukhe*\] em; *maṇimukhye padyate tadā jñā*, Sanskrit ms \(ac\). *maṇimukhye*, Sanskrit ms \(pc\). The same interpretation can be applied to the “mantra of *hūṃ* and *phaṭ* letters” in the teaching of psychosomatic fire oblation in the *Vajramālā-tantra*; see chapter 2, *’byung rngub pa ni ro gcig cing* / *rab tu dga’ bas mchod par bya* / *hūṃ phaṭ sngags kyi nor bu’i sgor* / *bkod de rdo rje rang bskyod bya* // \(TTP: Tohoku 445, 213a2, Otani 82, 172b3\). On the other hand, Gambhīravajra comments that the practitioner visualizes the letter HŪṂ in the middle of his penis and the letter PHAṬ in the middle of his female partner’s vagina. His comment suggests that *maṇi* indicates the penis and *mukha* signifies the vagina.

[^27]: What “sound” and “secret lotus” indicate in this context is not clear. Chapter 7 of the *Vajramālā-tantra* expounds the nature and features of the “sound” \(*nā da* or *sgra*\) and an inner lotus where the sound resides. The “sound” is the letter AṂ \(or A\). The lotus is the creation *cakra* in the shape of a lotus with sixty-four petals, which is situated in the navel area of the practitioner. The letter AṂ \(or A\) is located at the center of the creation *cakra,* and the yogic subtle fire blazes up from the letter AṂ \(or A\); TTP: Tohoku 445, 218b3–b7, Otani 82, 178a2–a7. See also Alaṃkakalaśa’s comments on this chapter, TTP: Tohoku 1795, 65b2–b6, Otani 2660, 77a1–a6. These explanations on the sound and inner lotus in chapter 7 may be applicable to the “sound” and “secret lotus” in chapter 60.

[^28]: As for the meaning of the phrase “fusion of the two forces,” see n. 23.

[^29]: See n. 24.

[^30]: The word *samaya* \(*dam tshig*\), or “vow,” is a technical term in Tantric Buddhism that has many meanings. In this context, it appears to mean some sort of heavenly or superhuman experience.

[^31]: According to Gambhīravajra, the sentence in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* in question \(line 3\) is intended to teach that the practitioner ejaculates into the vagina, to prohibit ejaculation to places outside the vagina \(TTP: Tohoku 1200, 137b6-b7, Otani 2330, 150b8- 151a1: *ho ma khung gi phyi rol* \(*kuṇḍād bahir*\) *ni gsang ba’i pa dma’i phyi rol lo* // *blugs gzar nas* \(*sruvayā*\) *ni gsang ba’i rdo rje’i rin po che nas* / *de la don ni ’di yin te* / *byang chub sems kyi mar dgang blugs dbul ba’i dus su* / y*o ni phyi rol du gtang bar mi bya’o* \(*na kṣipet*\) // \[Since *gsang ba’i pa dma’i phyi rol* in the first sentence and the *yo ni phyi rol* in the last sentence are equivalent terms, the latter \(*yo ni phyi rol*\) should be read as “outside of the vagina,” not as “the vagina, which is outside.”\). Gambhīravajra’s reading appears to be the most natural reading of the sentence. However, at the same time, Gambhīravajra mentions an interpretation of this sentence by Ḍombīpa, according to whom this sentence explains non-ejaculation. Ḍombīpa says that both the words “hearth” \(*kuṇḍa*\) and “small ritual ladle” \(*sruvā*\) in this sentence signify the penis of the practitioner \(TTP: Tohoku 1200, 137b7- 138a1, Otani 2330, 151a1-a2\).

[^32]: The five sense faculties are inner instruments for sensory enjoyment. This is probably why the five sense faculties are identified not with firewood and fuel but with articles that bring sensory enjoyment \(i.e., rice or offered articles\).

[^33]: I believe that this is the most natural understanding of the passage. However, it must be noted that there were practitioners who internalized these recipient deities, as Gambhīravajra suggests. Gambhīravajra comments that masters taught the sacred meanings of these recipient deities \(excluding *ḍākinī*s and mothers\) as follows: buddhas are the mind and mental functions; bodhisattvas are the five aggregates; gods and *dānava*s are the \(four or five\) material causes; *rākṣasa*s are \(twelve\) bases of experience; and the eight world-protectors are the eight faces. However, no such teaching can be found in the *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra*. Regarding Vajrasattva, Gambhīravajra introduces the words of the master Jñānapūti, who says that Vajrasattva means Mahāsukharāja, probably Heruka, the highest deity in this scripture.

[^35]: The *Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra* \(chapter 4\), Sanskrit ms. Hs or 8711, 6a5–9a2.

[^36]: Gambhīravajra also explains that the *ḍākinī*s are channels and the mothers are outer channels \(*phyi’i rtsa*\) in this context. \(However, I have no idea about what the outer channels mean.\)

[^37]: Gambhīravajra comments that the acquisition of accomplishments means “to increase channels and so on” \(*rtsa la sogs pa rgyas pa*\).

[^38]: The body *maṇḍala* is a concept that I would like to define as explaining “the innate purity and power of an initiated practitioner.” It explains that deities are present as a framework \(such as the five aggregates, the five or six sense faculties, channels, and so forth\) that constitutes one’s own being; it says that one’s own being is a *maṇḍala* consisting of deities. Although the body *maṇḍala* is innate to each person, it becomes really significant when one is taught its contents and significance in practice through the initiation to become a master \(*guru* or *ācārya*\). For details of *Cakrasaṃvara* systems of body *maṇḍala*, see Tsunehiko Sugiki, “Five Types of Internal *Maṇḍala* Described in the *Cakrasaṃvara* Buddhist Literature: Somatic Representations of One’s Innate Sacredness,” *Tōyō Bunka Kenkyūjo Kiyō* \[*Memoirs of the Institute of Oriental Culture*\] 144 \(2003\): 157–231.

[^47]: Bhavabhadra’s *Vajraḍākavivṛti*, a commentary on the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*, gives only a brief comment on chapter 44 and is not useful. The *Vajraḍākavivṛti*, TTP: Tohoku 1415, 185b6, Otani 2131, 211a4. The entire comment on this instruction is: “\[The passages\] beginning with ‘internal fire oblation’ are easy to understand” \(*nang gi sbyin sreg ces bya ba la sogs pa ni go sla’o*\).

[^48]: The *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*’s definition of the five sense objects as externally offered articles does not mean that a practitioner uses external objects actively in this fire oblation practice. Both internal and external articles \(i.e., bodily substances and the five sense objects\) are described as offered articles in the skullbone in the head \(i.e., body fluid in the great bliss *cakra*\). However, why are external objects \(i.e., the five sense objects\) represented in the form of body fluid? Abhayākaragupta explains: There is no distinction between inner and outer in the real \(*don dam pa*\). They are undivided and are both of the nature of the awakening mind. Hence, a practitioner must perform the inner oblation of the awakening mind, which represents both the inner and outer \(Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 1198, 213a3–a4, Otani 2328, 234b4–b6\).

[^49]: Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 1198, 213a3, Otani 2328, 234b4; *rnam par rtogs pa’i rab rib ma lus pa sel bar byed pa’i phyir*….

[^50]: As shown in table 3, a bejeweled *vajra* attached to the lower ends of the handles of ritual ladles is identified with the penis of the practitioner in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra*. This is not to explain a process of the physical practice of sexual yoga. In chapter 48, the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* explains how to make the large and small ritual ladles that are used in the external fire oblation ritual. According to this chapter, a bejeweled *vajra* is attached to the lower end of the handle of a ritual ladle \(Sanskrit ed.; Sugiki, “The *Homa* System of the *Vajraḍākatantra*,” pp. 48, 85–91\). In the psychosomatic fire oblation the ritual ladles are the two inner channels, i.e., the *lalanā* and *rasanā*, and the lower ends of these two channels are located around the genitals of a practitioner. This is the reason the penis is regarded as a bejeweled *vajra* attached to the lower ends of the handles of the ritual ladles and indicates nothing more than that.

[^51]: Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 1198, 213a7–b1, Otani 2328, 235a1–a2; *las ni yid mnyam par bzhag pa ’am* “*dbang po gnyis kyi bya ba*”*’o* / *des bskul ba’i rlung ste* / *des sbar ba’o* //. The phrase *dbang po gnyis kyi bya ba* \(“the action of the two forces”\) may mean the union of the genital organs of a male practitioner and his female partner.

[^52]: Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 1198, 213a5–a6, Otani 2328, 234b6–b7.

[^54]: The prototype idea of a *maṇḍala* consisting of deities representing the five aggregates, the bases of experience, and the material causes first appeared in the *Guhyasamāja-tantra*. The idea of the body *maṇḍala* consisting of channels \(i.e., the circle of channels\) was first systematically taught in the *Hevajra-tantra*. Both of these ideas prevailed and were later combined. As a result, many similar schema of the body *maṇḍala* appeared. The body *maṇḍala* shown in table 4, or those similar, is a widely taught version, especially in texts belonging to the *Cakrasaṃvara* literature, and the body *maṇḍala* shown in table 2, or those similar, is a version found especially in later texts belonging to *Guhyasamāja* literature.

[^55]: Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 1198, 213b6, Otani 2328, 235a8.

[^56]: Abhayākaragupta’s *Jyotirmañjarī*, TTP: Tohoku 3142, 161b2, Otani 3963, 198b4. It is not clear what he means by “supreme bliss” \(*mchog tu dga’ ba*\). He may mean “highest bliss,” the second of the four types of bliss according to the four-bliss doctrine, because *mchog tu dga’ ba* is often a translation of Sanskrit *paramānanda*, “highest bliss.” Or he may mean innate bliss \(or great pleasure\), the fourth and highest of the four bliss states, because *mchog tu dga’ ba* is also often a translation of a Sanskrit phrase that indicates the supreme level of bliss. Abhayākaragupta’s *Āmnāyamañjarī* is not useful in this examination, as it does not explain clearly what the term “supreme bliss” in the *Jyotirmañjarī* means.

[^57]: The *Vajraḍāka-tantra*, chapter 1, Sanskrit ed.; Tsunehiko Sugiki, “A Critical Study of the *Vajraḍākamahātantrarāja* \(I\)—Chapters 1 and 42,” *Chisan Gakuhō* \[*Journal of Chisan Studies*\] 51 \(2002\): 81–115, 1.16–22. There are slight differences between the *maṇḍala* in the *Vajraḍāka-tantra* \(VḌ\) and that in the *Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra*. Vajraḍāka \(who is the supreme deity in VḌ\) represents all the aggregates and all the bases of experience in VḌ. Mahāmāyā \(who is the supreme goddess in VḌ\) represents the space material cause and, at the same time, all the material causes in VḌ.

[^58]: The *Vajraḍāka-tantra,* chapter 14, Sanskrit ed., Tsunehiko Sugiki, “A Critical Study of the *Vajraḍākamahātantrarāja* \(II\)—Sacred Districts and Practices Concerned,” *Chisan Gakuhō* \[*Journal of Chisan Studies*\] 52 \(2003\): 53–106. The idea that *ḍākinī*s are channels appears in many chapters of this scripture, but chapter 14 can be taken as representative because it has the most systematic explanation.

[^59]: See Appendix, Source Text no. 6.

[^60]: This does not mean that the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* has the nine-*cakra* theory. The *cakra* theory found in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* is the four-*cakra* theory, and its structure is the same as the four-*cakra* theory taught in many scriptures belonging to the *Yoginī-tantra* tradition. In short, in this *Ḍākārṇava* system, four hearths are visualized on the four *cakra*s and the other five hearths are visualized at other points on the vertical centerline of the body.

[^61]: In the external ritual form of fire oblation, a practitioner \(i.e., a tantric priest\) makes one of the nine hearths according to the aim of his ritual performance \(e.g., a practitioner makes a round hearth on the ground in the ritual place when performing the pacifying rite\). From this one might expect that the practitioner visualizes a particular hearth in his body according to the specific aim of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation \(e.g., a practitioner visualizes a round hearth in his navel area when he is performing the pacifying rite\). However, this is unlikely, and no available textual sources support this interpretation. Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*, which is examined next, clearly teaches that a practitioner visualizes all nine hearths in his body.

[^62]: Padmavajra’s *Vohitā*, TTP: Tohoku 1419, 185b7, Otani 2136, 219b4–b5. It comments on the instruction of the psychosomatic fire oblation as follows: *da ni sbyin sreg gi thab rnams gsungs pa* / *zhi ba zhes bya ba la sogs pa ste* / *de ltar phyi dang nang gi bdag nyid thams cad rtogs pa sla’o* //.

[^63]: Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi*, TTP: Tohoku 1522, 68a3, Otani 2236, 85a1–a2.

[^64]: See Appendix, Source Text no. 7.

[^65]: This passage explaining inner hearths is likely to be from the passage in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra* previously examined in this subsection of this essay. The available texts of Jayasena’s *Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi* \(TTP: both Tohoku and Otani\) omit the sentences “a triangular hearth is in the private part” and “a decagonal hearth is in the forehead.” I provided them as supplementary from the passage in the *Ḍākārṇava-tantra*, although there is also a possibility that these sentences were omitted in the original Sanskrit text of Jayasena’s work.

[^66]: Both texts \(TTP: Tohoku and Otani\) read *baṃ*, but the original may be *aṃ* \(the letter AṂ\). In esoteric Buddhism the fusion of the letters HŪṂ \(blue color, male\) and AṂ \(red color, female\) signifies the union of male and female, which represents the real. If this fusion occurs in all the inner hearths, they all represent the real, which makes this fire oblation practice more excellent. The letter VAṂ, however, generally symbolizes male. It may be that the letter VAṂ colored in red symbolizes female in this context.
