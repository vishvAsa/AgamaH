## INTRODUCTION

The diverse *homa* rituals attested in the *Kālacakra-tantra* and in its commentary, the *Vimalaprabhā*, represent an amalgamation of theories and ritual practices unique to the Kālacakra tradition with others that are appropriations and redefinitions of Vedic fire ritual and the Sāṃkhya theory of the material world \(*prakṛti*\) and its properties \(*guṇa*\). The appropriation and adaptation of Vedic *homa* ritual by Buddhist and Śaiva tantric traditions are well attested. Although these adaptations of Vedic *homa* show certain commonalities in terms of their functions, they mutually differ in their set ritual requirements and broader theoretical contexts. However, since an examination of these differences exceeds the scope of this essay and deserves greater attention, they will not be discussed here.

*Homa* rituals and their specific immediate aims and multiple functions are part of more elaborate ritual practices within the different stages of Kālacakra tantric practice. They are integral to the following broader ritual contexts: the ritual of initiation into the Kālacakra tantric tradition, which is described in great detail in the “Chapter on Initiation,” the magico-religious healing rituals discussed in the “Chapter on the Individual,” and the *kālacakra-sādhana* practice, taught in the “Chapter on *Sādhanā.*”

As indicated by the author of the *Vimalaprabhā*,1 externally performed *homa* rituals, which are able to bring about diverse mundane accomplishments \(*siddhi*\) and effect protection from harmful entities such as “mothers” \(*mātṛka*s\), “seizures” \(*graha*s\), and the like, belong to the domain of conventional reality, for their efficacy depends on knowledge of the characteristics of the natural world and prescribed ritual conventions. For example, in the ritual of pacification and protection from cruel *mātṛka*s who may cause harm to infants and *yogī*s, a thousand fire offerings consisting of flesh and blood are to be made in the fire of a *kṣatriya* household with sticks of the *khadira* tree,2 as Agni is invited by means of deity yoga and the syllables *oṃ hrīṃ phreṃ hūṃ phaṭ* are placed on the forehead, throat, heart, navel, and secret *cakra*s.3

Because externally performed rituals encapsulate social norms and are contingent on the nature of the material things utilized in the ritual and on the mental processes of the ritual master, they are deemed ineffective in procuring the accomplishment of the supreme, indestructible gnosis \(*paramākṣara-jñāna-siddhi*\), characterized by nonconceptuality. Nevertheless, externally performed *homa* rituals are not entirely devoid of soteriological significance: they are said to facilitate purification, the accumulation of merit, the appearance and blessings of enlightened deities, and the like. In contrast, the internally performed *homa* involving the fire of gnosis is said to bring about spiritual awakening and freedom from cyclic existence.

A similar view of the liberating power of the internal *homa* is also held in other Buddhist tantric texts, such as the *Hevajra-tantra* and so on. Likewise, Śrīkṛṣṇācārya’s *Vasantatilakā* speaks of the fire of wisdom, or *caṇḍālī*, blazing in the firepit of the navel *cakra*, into which the oblation \(*havis*\) of semen falls.4 It reads: “When the fire of wisdom is greatly blazing with internal oblations such as semen and the like, and with external oblations, the form and the like, a *homa* is performed.”5

Within the Kālacakra tantric tradition, internally performed *homa* rituals are of two kinds: those combined with externally performed *homa* rituals and those that are solely internal. A *homa* ritual performed internally during a preparation for bestowing Kālacakra tantric initiation or for protection from malevolent entities radically differs from the internal *homa* ritual, which is characterized by the practice of the six-phased yoga \(*ṣaḍaṅga-yoga*\). The former is characterized by conceptual methods involving *sādhana*s with visualizations and recitations of mantras, whereas the latter is characterized by a nonconceptual yogic method of kindling the fire of gnosis \(*jñānāgni*\), which consumes the fuel of the psychophysical aggregates \(*skandha*s\) and elements \(*dhātu*s\) as its oblation \(*huta*\). It is therefore considered efficacious in bringing about complete purification \(*viśuddhi*\) and the highest accomplishment of perfect spiritual awakening \(*samyaksaṃbodhi*\). That fire of gnosis is seen as an internal firepit \(*kuṇḍa*\) and is described as follows:

Having paid homage to the fire of gnosis, which consumes the entire oblation whose fuel is the psychophysical aggregates, elements, and the like, I will describe the characteristics of that firepit.

The firepit is said to be of eight types in accordance with the classification on the pacificatory \[rite\] and so on. The ninth, belonging to the all-effective \[rite\], is due to the division on individual directions.6

The aforementioned types of firepits also correspond to the eight channels \(*nāḍī*\) in the heart *cakra*, where the fire of gnosis resides.7

As is the case with most ritual actions, in this tantric system an externally performed *homa* ritual never stands by itself but is invariably a component of larger, more complex, and systematized ritual actions such as healing rites, rites of protection and purification, tantric initiation rites, and rites of gaining various mundane *siddhi*s. As such, it is indispensable for the efficacy of other rites, serving as a conduit through which other rites communicate and exercise their power. It thus has a dual function: to offer the appropriate oblation in a manner that is acceptable to its receiver, and to assist another, encompassing ritual in accomplishing its aims. As will be shown, a *homa* ritual achieves its goals by utilizing matter, its properties, and the potencies of the natural world to produce diverse effects. It exemplifies a ritual in which a close relationship between ritual means and their ends is obvious.

Ritual contexts in which the *homa* rites are performed within the Kālacakra tradition and the corresponding prerequisites for *homa* rites, discussed below, are based on the *Kālacakra-tantra*’s system of correspondences between conventional and ultimate reality and between the cosmos, society, and the person. They are not arbitrarily chosen. For example, the shapes of the firepits constructed for *homa* rites in rituals of pacification and the like correspond to the shapes of the four continents surrounding Mt. Meru; the respective locations of the firepits in relation to a town or a royal palace correspond to the locations of the four continents in their relation to Mt. Meru. Different types of soil on which the *maṇḍala*s for *homa* rites are constructed, sand poured into the firepits, fire deities, emblems, sacrificial sticks, and offerings to the fire have the colors and potencies that correspond to the colors, powers, and activities of the four faces of Kālacakra and to the colors and characteristics of the four main social classes in India.



## PREREQUISITES FOR EXTERNALLY PERFORMED *HOMA* RITES AS GIVEN IN KĀLACAKRA TANTRIC TRADITIONS

For a *homa* ritual to be effective it must be performed at the appropriate place and time, which will differ from one *homa* ritual to another according to their diverse aims and functions. The *Vimalaprabhā* says that in the mantra vehicle, those who practice the heroic process \(*vīra-krama*\) or the process of self-empowerment \(*svādhiṣṭhāna-krama*\) for at least a year in a cremation ground in the dead of night, or in a forest or mountain, at the shore of the ocean, and so on, are able to bring into manifestation Lord Heruka, Samantabhadra, or any other deity due to the power of mantra recitation, *homa*, and meditation. If *homa* rites along with mantra recitations and meditation are performed in an unsuitable place, such as one’s own home at any time one pleases, the practitioner will be unable to encounter any deity or attain purification and *siddhi*s.8

Although all *homa* rituals prescribed within this tradition have certain commonalities, some of their prerequisites differ. This is especially evident among the *homa* rituals prescribed for facilitating mundane *siddhi*s, which are integral to the eight types of rites—namely, those for procuring the powers of pacification, prosperity \(*puṣṭi*\), subjugation \(*vaśya*\), attraction \(*ākṛṣṭi*\), immobilizing \(*stambhana*\), bewilderment \(*mohana*\), exorcism \(*uccātana*\), pinning down \(*kīlana*\), and killing \(*māraṇa*\)—and to the all-effective rite \(*sarvakarman*\). The prerequisites for a *homa* performed in the aforementioned ritual contexts fall into two main groups: those that are equally indispensable for both the rites of procuring mundane *siddhi*s and for their individual *homa* rituals, and those that are unique to an individual *homa* ritual. When examining *homa* rituals in the context of the *Kālacakra-tantra*’s aforementioned rites for procuring mundane *siddhi*s, one finds that these prerequisites are not unique to this tantric tradition and that they share features in common with other Buddhist and Śaiva tantras. However, the mantras accompanying *homa* rituals and their broader interpretative frameworks differ.

In the Kālacakra tradition, the specific types of soil, their colors, tastes, and smells, that are required for a construction of the *kālacakra-maṇḍala* are also required for the rites procuring mundane *siddhi*s and are indispensable for various *homa* rituals. Thus, white soil with the scent of clove \(*divyagandha*\)9 and with bitter and astringent tastes, due to the dominance of the water element, must be used in the rites of pacification and prosperity. Black soil that has a putrid smell and sour taste due to the dominance of the wind element is to be procured for the rites of killing and exorcism. In the case of rites of immobilizing and bewildering, yellow soil with a pungent smell and sweet taste due to the dominance of the earth element is to be used, whereas red soil with the scent of lotus and a spicy taste is to be used for rites of attraction and subjugation. In case of the all-effective rite \(*sarvakarman*\),10 green soil that contains all of the elements, colors, and tastes, characterized by the dominance of the space element, must be selected. The characteristics of each type of soil, which derive from different elements, correspond to the nature of a given rite and make it successful.

If the area in which a rite is performed lacks soil with the required qualities, one is advised to dig a hole and fill it with soil having the required qualities prepared especially for the given rite. For example, for preparing soil with the taste and smell required for rites of pacification and prosperity, one is advised to pour a bitter decoction into white soil that has been previously soaked with sandalwood water. In case of attraction and subjugation, one should pour lotus water and add three types of myrobalan into red soil, the pungent urine of a horse or a human and molasses into yellow soil, and the water of a putrid fish into black soil.

Likewise, substances bearing the qualities corresponding to a particular rite are to be buried in the appropriate soil. For instance, in case of the so-called “fierce” \(*krūra*\) rites, substances of a dark color and that bear fierce qualities should be placed in the soil. Thus, in the rite of killing, one buries human bones; in the rite of exorcism, one buries a crow’s tail; and in the rite of engendering animosity, one buries the bones of a donkey. For the rites of pinning down \(*kīlana*\), immobilizing, and bewildering, one buries a ram’s horn, a yellow-colored pigeon, and a snake, respectively, in yellow soil. For the rites of subjugation, attraction, and immobilizing, one buries the bright yellow orpiment from the urine or bile of a cow, vermilion cinnabar \(*hiṅgula*\), and red arsenic, respectively, in order to make red soil. However, nothing should be buried in green soil except when the all-effective rite is of a general kind. In that case, five types of gems should be placed in the ground. It is on these types of soil that the mantric master \(*mantrin*\) builds not only a *maṇḍala* for the individual rite but also a firepit for the accompanying *homa* ritual.

The success of each of the aforementioned rites and their *homa* rituals also depends on the location where they are carried out. If a town’s cremation grounds are located in the eight directions from the royal residence, the rites of pacification and prosperity, together with their *homa*s, are successful only if they are performed in the northeastern direction of the royal palace and in its northern direction, respectively. The rites of killing and expelling must be performed in the southeast, the rite of engendering animosity in the east, the rite of subjugation in the southwest, and the rites of attraction and immobilizing in the south. All other rites must be performed outside the royal palace. A *maṇḍala* for accomplishing all rites \(*sarvākārmika*\) and a firepit for its *homa* must be built in the center of the town. In contrast, firepits for the *homa* of the remaining eight rites should be constructed in the eight directions outside of the town.

Each *homa* ritual that is integral to the aforementioned rites and subject to the designated location in relation to the town requires a firepit of a different shape. The shapes of the firepits are determined by the *Kālacakra-tantra*’s symbols for the properties \(*guṇa*\) or the elements, which constitute the material nature \(*prakṛti*\) of the world and which exert their individual powers, giving unique characteristics to the rites. In fact, the individual features of everything utilized in a *homa* ritual—the characteristics of different types of soil, the shapes of the firepits, the characteristics of the fuel sticks, and the ingredients of the oblations—are determined by the nature and efficacy of the elements of water, fire, wind, and earth, and their combinations.

The Indian *Kālacakra-tantra* master Abhayākaragupta \(eleventh to twelfth centuries\), in his *Jyotirmañjarī*, asserts that among the countless firepits used for *homa* rituals in accordance with diverse classes of sentient beings, there are five types of firepits related to the five buddha families. He also points to existing differences between the prescribed shapes of firepits prepared for *homa* rites in the *Kālacakra-tantra*’s system and those in Buddhist tantras such as the *Susiddhikara, Vajramālābhidhāna, Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi, Trisamayavyūharāja, Samantābhiṣekajanana, Vajrapāṇigarbhasaṃbhava, Vajrābhyudaya, Buddhakapālatantra*, and so on.11



### Regulations Regarding the Firepit

In the rite of pacification, a circular firepit is built in the northeastern direction of the town. It is half the size of its *maṇḍala*, which measures four cubits in circumference. Within it, the gnosis *cakra* \(*jñāna-cakra*\) extends from the center of the *maṇḍala* up to the pillars and *vajra* lines, and its central lotus is half the size of that *cakra*.

In the rite of prosperity, a quadrangular firepit is built in the north. It measures two cubits in size, and extends from the border of the firepit’s fence up to the limit of the painted mind *maṇḍala*. The *maṇḍala* is half the size of the firepit with a lotus in its center. On white soil, either in the northern or northeastern directions, one should paint the *vajra* flames of the sand *maṇḍala* at the exterior of the two-cubit firepit. Its hollow \(*khāni*\) is the size of a lotus, or two *vitasti*s12 in circumference, and its interior has a central lotus. A sword, jewel, and other emblems are placed in the cardinal and intermediate directions within the central lotus. The lotus in the center of the firepit must be painted with white sand or clay dyed with ground, non-husked rice. The *vajra* master should leave two cubits outside of the firepit for drawing three fences with white, red, and black sand. One is told that this should be done with all firepits.13

In the rite of killing or in exorcism, a bow-shaped firepit is built in the southeast. In the rite of engendering hatred, a pentagonal firepit is built in the east; in the rite of subjugation, a heptagonal firepit is built in the southwest; in the rite of attraction, a triangular firepit is in the south; in the rite of bewildering, a sectagonal firepit is built in the northwest; and in the rites of immobilizing and pinning down, an octagonal firepit is built in the west.

Each firepit used for a *homa* must be marked with its own emblem \(*cihna*\), some of which correspond to a particular buddha family. The emblem of a circular firepit is a lotus. The emblem of a quadrangular firepit is a wheel; a bow-shaped firepit has a cleaver as its emblem; a pentagonal firepit has a sword; a heptagonal firepit has an arrow; a triangular firepit has a *vajra* noose; a hexagonal firepit has a snake; and an octagonal firepit has a conch as its emblem. Moreover, there should be either a *vajra* or some other designated emblem in the center of the firepit.

Different measurements are also prescribed for each of the aforementioned firepits: a circular firepit measures one cubit in circumference; a quadrangular firepit is two cubits in size; a bow-shaped firepit is half a cubit; a pentagonal firepit is one cubit. A heptagonal firepit is forty finger-breadths in size; a triangular firepit measures twenty finger-breadths; a hexagonal firepit measures thirty finger-breadths; and an octagonal firepit measures sixty finger-breadths. The hollow within a firepit is half the size of the firepit, and an altar \(*vedī*\) is the sixth part of the firepit. The forepart \(*oṣṭha*\) of a firepit and its row of emblems form the twelfth part.14

In terms of the firepit’s correspondences with the individual and the cosmos, in the rite of pacification the firepit is said to be of the nature of the moon \(semen\) and marked with the sun \(uterine blood\) as its emblem. In the rite of prosperity, it is of the nature of the sun and is marked with the moon as its emblem. In the rite of killing, the firepit is of the nature of Rāhu \(consciousness\) and has Kālāgni \(the fire of gnosis\) as its emblem.15 In the rite of exorcism, the firepit is of the nature of the wind and fire elements and is marked with a cleaver as its emblem. In the rite of attraction, the firepit has the qualities of the earth and fire elements and has a hook as its emblem. A triangular firepit represents Kālāgni and is marked with its emblem, the *vajra* noose. A hexagonal firepit consists of Rāhu and the earth element, and it has a serpent as its emblem. In the rite of immobilizing, the firepit is Mt. Meru and has the nature of the earth element.16



### Regulations Regarding the Pouring of Sand into the Firepit

Regarding the pouring of sand \(*rajas-pāta*\) into the firepit, the following regulations are prescribed. For pacification and prosperity, white sand is poured either into the firepit or into the center of its *maṇḍala*. In the rites of killing and exorcism, black sand is used; in the rite of subjugation and attraction, the sand must be red-colored; in the rite of bewildering and immobilizing, yellow sand is poured into the firepit; and in the all-effective rite, the sand can be green, white, black, or alternatively, it can be red, yellow, and green. In the all-effective rite, the sand of four different colors is poured into the four cardinal directions of the firepit to correspond to the classification of the four bodies of the Buddha—the dharma body \(*dharmakāya*\), the enjoyment body \(*sabmbhogakāya*\), the emanation body \(*nirmāṇakāya*\), and the body of gnosis \(*jñānakāya*\)—and to the four faces of Kālacakra Buddha: the white, eastern face; the yellow, western face; the red, southern face; and the black, northern face, with which he pacifies, paralyzes, attracts, and destroys, respectively.17

After pouring colored sand into the firepit, the *vajra* master installs mantras, sprinkles water, and emanates deities from his heart-*vajra*. In the rites of pacification and prosperity, the firepit has a *maṇḍala* with the fire deity \(*agni-devatā*\), a white and peaceful presiding deity \(*nāyaka*\). In the rites of killing and exorcism, the firepit comprises a *maṇḍala* that has a black, fierce fire deity; in the rites of subjugation and attraction, the deity is impassioned and red; in the rites of bewildering and immobilizing, the deity is motionless and yellow; and in the all-effective rite, the deity is green, slightly smiling, and lovely in form.18

Once an appropriate firepit has been constructed, the *vajra* master ritually protects it by pinning down ritual nails around it while reciting the prescribed mantras and invoking the kings of the fierce deities \(*krodha-rāja*\) and goddesses \(*devī*\). In the all-effective rite, he sprinkles the perfumed water that is taken from the offering dish with a stalk of *kuśa* grass in the ten directions of the firepit, while reciting the syllables *oṃ āḥ hūṃ phaṭ.* Thereafter, he installs Vaiśvānara \(Agni\) into the firepit within his own heart and visualizes Vaiśvānara as having one face, four hands, and two feet, holding a *vajra* with his first right hand and a string of *akṣa* seeds19 with his second right hand, and holding a bell and a lotus with his two left hands.

After meditating on Vaiśvānara in this form, visualized as standing on top of the moon in the lotus of his own heart, the *vajra* master makes fire offerings to the fire, together with water and flowers. He then meditatively generates a pledge being \(*samaya-sattva*\) and visualizes on the moon disc of his heart a hook situated on the top of the moon and emanating stainless rays of light. With the hook, he draws the omnipresent Jñānasattva into his body and merges him with the pledge being. After emitting Jñānasattva from his heart by means of the out-breath, he offers an oblation to the fire with the *vajra*-hook *mudrā* and places Jñānasattva on the filament of the lotus with a *vajra* fist with the thumb held erect.



### *Regulations Pertaining to the* Vajra *Master’s Throne and Stall for the Fire Offerings*

Prior to performing a *homa* ritual, the *vajra* master must prepare his throne \(*āsana*\) in a prescribed location. In the rite of pacification, his throne is placed in the southern direction of the *maṇḍala*; in the rite of prosperity, it is in the southwestern direction; in the rite of killing, in the western direction; in the rites of exorcism and engendering animosity, in the northwest; in the rite of subjugation, in the north; in the rite of attraction, in the northeast; in the rite of bewildering, in the east; and in the rite of immobilizing, it is in the south.20

The shape of the *vajra* master’s throne, the stand for the *homa*, and the stall for the offerings must be of the same shape as its corresponding firepit. Thus, the *vajra* master’s throne is quadrangular and of the same size as a quadrangular firepit, measuring two cubits in size and twice the size of its central lotus. On the left is a stand for offering rice and *durvā* grass that should measure one cubit in size. On the right is a stand for the *homa* offering dish, which is also one cubit in size. In the rite of prosperity, it is two cubits in size. The space in between all the stands must have scattered lotus petals, and the center of every stand should have a variegated *vajra* of Vajrasattva or Mātā’s space-lotus, the triangular source of phenomena \(*dharmodaya*\), as its emblem. In the all-effective rite, the firepit inside the body and outside the body is of two kinds: the so-called “mouth firepit” \(*vaktraṃ kuṇḍam*\) for the burnt oblation of rice and the like, and the “secret firepit” \(*guhyaṃ kuṇḍam*\) for the offering of the oblation of ghee, five ambrosias \(*amṛta*\), and so on.



### *Regulations Regarding Sacrificial Sticks Used for* Homa *Rituals*

The type of fuel, or the sacrificial sticks \(*samidha*\), whose individual colors, fragrances, aromas, and so on are derived from their constitutive elements, is chosen in accordance with the nature of the rite in which it is used. Thus, in the rites of pacification and prosperity, the *vajra* master performs a *homa* ritual with 500 sacrificial sticks made from the *udumbara, aśvattha, nyagrodha*, and *madhūka* trees, which belong to the *kṣīra* class of trees having white sap. In the rite of killing, 500 sacrificial sticks are made of human bones in the shape of a little finger. In the rites of engendering animosity and in exorcism, 500 tailfeathers from crows are used as fuel; in the rite of subjugation, the sacrificial sticks are made of the *khadira* tree; in the rite of attraction they are made from the *palāśa* tree.21 In the rite of bewildering the sacrificial sticks are made from an *unmatta* tree,22 and they are made of the *bilva* tree in the rite of immobilizing.23

Moreover, following the conventions of class distinction and the characterization of the four social classes in terms of their colors, aromas, and activities, as given in the Brāhmaṇic tradition, the fuel used in the *homa* of each rite must come from a household of the social caste whose characteristics correspond to the nature and aim of the rite in question. In the all-effective rite, the *vajra* master kindles the fire with fragrant sticks made of sandalwood, aloeswood \(*aguru*\), or pine \(*devadāru*\) brought from a royal palace. In the rites of pacification and prosperity, he kindles the fire with sticks brought from the house of a *brāhmaṇa*; in the rite of killing and the like, with sticks brought from the house of a *śūdra*; in the rite of subjugation, red *khadira* sticks brought from the house of a *kṣatriya* are used; in the rite of immobilizing, yellowish-red sticks24 brought from the house of a *vaiśya* are used; and in the rite of killing, *kaṇṭaka* sticks brought from the house of a *caṇḍāla* are used.25



### *Regulations Pertaining to Substances Offered in* Homa *Rituals*

Different offering substances are prescribed for the *homa* of each rite. In the rite of pacification, the *homa* is performed with cow’s milk and *durvā* grass; in the rite of prosperity, butter and five types of grain \(*śasya*\); in the rite of killing, blood, flesh, and poison; in the rites of exorcism and engendering animosity, human marrow, mustard, and salt; in the right of subjugation, sweat and the red flowers of a *vīra* plant; in the rite of attraction, urine and the leaves of a *bilva* tree or its fruit; in the rite of immobilizing, phlegm and a wreath of flowers left from a garland; and in the rite of bewildering, the *homa* ritual is performed with a vine and the flowers of a *dhattūraka* tree.26 Once again, the color and taste of the substances offered in a *homa* must correspond to the nature of the rite in which it is performed.27



### *Regulations Pertaining to Utensils Used in* Homa *Rituals*

The dish \(*pātra*\) that holds the oblation offered in a *homa* must also bear features that correspond to the properties of the given rite. In the rite of pacification, the dish used for offering the oblation is a shallow dish made of crystal in the shape of eight petals with a filament. Each petal and the filament of a lotus should be four finger-breadths in size. In the rite of pacification, the oblation is placed in a dish made either of silver, iron, gold, copper, wood, or clay, or it can be placed into a skull dish \(*kapāla*\). The materials of which the dishes used in *homa*s of the remaining rites must be made are not given. However, it is safe to assume that their colors must correspond to the colors associated with the rites.

The ladle \(*śravaka*\) used for pouring oblations into the fire must also meet specific requirements. Its handle must be one cubit long and have a *vajra* emblem on its back. Its quadrangular scoop \(*culuka*\) should measure one finger-breadth in depth so that it can contain as much as a mouthful of ghee. The curved part of the scoop should be as long as the space in between a man’s face and his heart. Its smooth surface has a lotus made of the tips of lotus leaves, measuring sixteen finger-breadths in circumference. On the outside, next to the interior and the lip of the scoop, there is a five-pronged *vajra*. The central prong of the *vajra* has a hole through which the stream of ghee can flow in the manner in which the stream of urine or semen flows from the body.28

The water jar \(*kalaśa*\) also must meet certain requirement: it must be a round water jar, measuring sixteen finger-breadths in diameter and twenty finger-breadths in height from its center to its opening lip. From the opening up to its end, the neck of the jar should measure six finger-breadths in height, the lips should be two finger-breadths in size, and the opening from one lip to another eight finger-breadths in size. A whitish water jar made of crystal or silver is used in the rites of prosperity and pacification. In the absence of a crystal or silver jar, the *vajra* master must prepare an inauspicious clay jar by smearing white sandal paste and rice meal on it. In the rite of killing, the water jar, which protects from hell, must be painted black with powder made from charcoal from a cremation ground. In the rites of exorcism and causing animosity, the jar should have a long neck, with a spout measuring eighteen finger-breadths and the black body measuring twelve finger-breadths in diameter and twenty-four finger-breadths in height. The lips should measure one finger-breadth, and the mouth should be the size of six finger-breadths. In the rites of attraction and subjugation, the water jar is a conventional one made by a craftsman; in the rite of immobilizing, it is short, measuring eighteen finger-breadths in diameter and in height; the neck is four finger-breadths in size, its opening six finger-breadths, and its lips two finger-breadths.29



### *Regulations Regarding the Proper Time for* Homa *Rituals*

After constructing the throne, the *vajra* master is advised to wait for about three hours \(or one watch of the day\) before performing the *homa* ritual, which is to last for half of a watch. The times at which a *homa* may be performed differ according to the prescribed times for carrying out the rite in the context in which it is to be performed. In the rite of pacification the *vajra* master performs the *homa* in the first watch of the morning; he performs it in the second watch for the rite of prosperity; in the third watch for the rite of killing; in the fourth watch for the rite of exorcism; in the fifth watch for the rite of subjugation; in the sixth watch for the rite of attraction; in the seventh watch for the rite of bewildering; and in the eighth watch for the rite of immobilizing. Likewise, in the afternoon he performs *homa* during the rite of pacification within the first half of the watch of a day; in the second half of the watch of the day, he performs it during the rite of prosperity, and so on.

Furthermore, at night, during the rite of pacification, a *homa* ritual is to be performed within the first half of the first watch of the night, during the rite of prosperity in the second half of the night, and so on. Since the rites of pacification and prosperity are never to be performed at noon or midnight, as these times are considered to be “fierce” periods, their accompanying *homa* rituals must be avoided at those times as well. Similarly, when a solar mansion is associated with fierce planets such as Mars, Saturn, and Kālāgni, the *vajra* master must refrain from the two peaceful rites. Otherwise, the danger of killing someone will arise, as these times are appropriate for the rites of killing and exorcism.



### *Regulations Pertaining to the Mantras Recited During the* Homa *Rituals*

As for the mantras recited in *homa* rituals performed for the sake of the previously mentioned *siddhi*s, the *vajra* master must know the following mantric principles. In the name mantras \(*nāma-mantra*\), also called the “heart mantras” \(*hṛdaya-mantra*\), the syllable *oṃ* stands in front of the names of the principle male and female deities in the *maṇḍala*, and the word *svāhā* is at the end of such mantras. During worship in the all-effective rite, the mantra ends with *namo*. At the summoning of the deity, a hook hand gesture \(*mudrā*\) is made with the syllable *jaḥ*; at the entering of the deity, a *vajra* hand gesture is made with the syllable *hūṃ*; in tying the deity, a noose hand gesture is made with the syllable *vaṃ*; and in satisfying the deity, a *vajra* bell hand gesture is with the syllable *ho*. Then, when offering oblation at the end of the name mantra, the following phrase is uttered: “Such and such \[deity\] accept, accept, this offering of mine” \(*amukedaṃ gṛhṇa gṛhṇa arghakaṃ me punar*\).30

The mantras of the *homa* rituals performed during the previously discussed rites of prosperity and so on end differently. For instance, in the rite of pacification, the mantra recited during the *homa* ritual begins with *oṃ* and ends with *svāhā*, whereas in the rite of pacification it ends with *namaḥ*. In the rite of attraction, it ends with *vauṣaṭ*, and in the rite of subjugation it ends with *vaṣaṭ*. In the rites of exorcism, engendering animosity, and killing, it ends with the syllable *hūṃ*. In the rites of pinning down, immobilizing, and bewildering, it ends with the syllable *phaṭ*. These different endings of the *homa* rite’s mantras are said to be in accordance with the properties \(*guṇa*\) of the material nature \(*prakṛti*\). Thus, in the rite of prosperity, the material nature is soft earth, or *svāhā.* In the rite of pacification, the material nature is water, or *namaḥ*; in the rite of attraction, the material nature is fire, or *vauṣaṭ*; in the rite of subjugation, *vaṣaṭ* stands for the material nature of fire; in the rites of killing and exorcism, the syllable *hūṃ* stands for the material nature of wind and fire; in the rites of pinning down and immobilizing, the syllable *phaṭ* stands for the material nature of the Meru-like earth, and in the rite of bewildering, it stands for the material nature of water and earth. In the rites of killing and bewildering, mantra recitation \(*mantra-jāpa*\) ends with *hūṃ phaṭ*.

Corresponding to the nature of the elements \(*dhātu*\) that constitute the material world, the ending syllables of the mantras employed in the *homa* rituals of these mundane rites also correspond to the colors of the deities invoked in the ritual, which also accord with the elements. Thus, in the rites of pacification and prosperity, the white color of the deity corresponds to the moist earth and water, or to *svāhā* and *namaḥ*; in the rite of subjugation, the red color of the deity corresponds to the fire element, *vaṣaṭ*; in the rite of killing, the black color of the deity corresponds to the combined wind and fire elements, the syllable *hūṃ*; in the rite of bewildering, the yellow color of the deity corresponds to the water and earth elements, *hūṃ phaṭ,* and so on.31



## *HOMA* RITUALS AND THEIR DIVERSE FUNCTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE *KĀLACAKRA-TANTRA* INITIATION

Within the context of the Kālacakra tantric initiation and its various phases, *homa* rites are performed in three separate phases: an initial, preparatory phase, a middle portion of the ritual of initiation, and a concluding phase. In this context, *homa* rituals are integral to the rites of securing pacification of various entities for the sake of a successful construction of the *kālacakra-maṇḍala* and for its protection, for initiates’ entrance into the *maṇḍala*, and for the dissolution \(*visarjana*\) of the *maṇḍala* at the conclusion of initiation.



### Homa *Rituals in the Rites of Protection and Purification of the Ground*

Prior to drawing the *kālacakra-maṇḍala*, the *vajra* master ritually protects himself, makes offerings \(*bali*\) to fierce deities, and protects and purifies the ground on which the *maṇḍala* will be constructed. After that, he ritually protects the initiates and meditates on Kālacakra as Bhairava, requesting pacification, prosperity, and protection for all sentient beings. In order to subjugate all classes of malevolent entities, such as *māra*s, “obstacles” \(*vighna*s\), “undefeated” \(*aparājita*s\), and hungry ghosts \(*preta*s\), who may cause impediments to initiation, the *vajra* master recites ten million mantras using a *mālā* and makes 1 million *homa* offerings for the duration of one week. Within every single rite, he performs 1 million recitations and makes 100,000 *homa* offerings.32

Once the *kālacakra-maṇḍala* is created and the seed syllables \(*bīja*\) of its body, speech, and mind *maṇḍala*s are installed, the *vajra* master once again makes *homa* offerings in the firepit, summons heretics \(*tīrthika*s\), consecrates the ground by sprinkling it, offers rice and *durvā* grass, and ritually eradicates *māra*s. Then, for the sake of the protection of the gates of the *maṇḍala*, he presents at the four gates four of his previously initiated disciples, who have taken the twenty-five tantric vows \(*vrata*\) and observances \(*niyama*\), who are free from any of the fourteen root downfalls \(*mūlāpatti*\), and who are holding the *vajra* and the *vajra* bell in their hands. After this, he visualizes himself as a glorious Gaṇeśa and appoints a fifth disciple, who is skilled in all rites, to act as a ritual *varjī* and perform a *homa* ritual. In the absence of such a disciple, the *vajra* master himself, as Gaṇeśa, performs the *homa*.33



### **Homa *Rituals in the Rites of Pacification and in Invoking and Worshiping Agni*

After the protection of the disciples is secured, *homa*s are again performed within the rites of pacification, and so on. In the rite of pacification, the *vajra* master meditates on Jñānasattva, who is now Vaiśvānara \(Agni\), wearing a crown with Amitābha, dressed in white clothing and holding a rosary \(*mālā*\) of *akṣa* seeds and a crystal lotus in his two right hands and a vase and a conch in his left hands. In the rite of killing, Vaiśvānara is dressed in a black garment, has a crown with Amoghasiddhi, and holds a small sword \(*kartikā*\) and a spear in his right hands, and holds a skull \(*kapāla*\) and a skull-staff \(*khaṭvāṅga*\) in his left hands. In the rites of exorcism and engendering animosity, he holds a sword and a trident in his right hands, and a skull and a skull-staff in his left hands. In the rite of subjugation, he wears a saffron-colored garment, has a crown with Ratnasaṃbhava, and holds an arrow and a jewel in his right hands and a bow and a mirror in his left hands. In the rite of attraction, he holds a *vajra* hook and a jewel in his right hands, and in his left hands a *vajra* noose and a mirror. In the rite of bewildering, he holds a serpent and a staff in his right hands and a wheel and a mace in his left hands. In the rites of immobilizing and pinning down, he wears a yellow garment and a crown with Vairocana, holds a chain and a mace in his right hands, and a wheel and a *vajra* dagger \(*kīlaka*\) in his left hands.

Next, the *vajra* master kindles the fire with fuel sticks made of the previously mentioned type according to the nature of the rite, and invites Vaiśvānara with this mantra:

*Oṃ* come, come the most excellent among the great beings, gods, sages, and twice-born. Having taken a dish, O Great Splendor, being in this one, become overcome. The *vajra*-holder commands, *svāhā* \(*oṃ ehi ehi mahābhūta- deva-ṛṣi-dvija-sattama gṛhītvāyudhaṃ mahā-raśmi asmin san nihato bhava. vajradhara ājñāpayati svāhā*\).34

Upon uttering these words, the *vajra* master draws Vaiśvānara toward himself with the hook hand gesture \(*aṅkuśa*-*mudrā*\), brings him in with the *vajra* hand gesture \(*vajra*-*mudrā*\), binds him with the noose hand gesture \(*pāśa*-*mudrā*\), and pleases him with the bell hand gesture \(*ghaṇṭa*-*mudrā*\). Forming these *mudrā*s, he utters the syllables *jaḥ hūṃ vaṃ ho* respectively. Then, having rung the *vajra* bell, he subjugates Vaiśvānara and gives him offerings, reciting the following *mantra* of giving \(*dāna-mantra*\): “*Oṃ*. Accept the most excellent hospitality and great light rays *svāhā*.”35

Next, he worships Agni in this way:

Accept a *vajra* perfume *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* flower *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* incense *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* candle *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* meal *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* dance *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* laughter *svāhā*; accept a *vajra* song *svāhā*; and accept a *vajra* sensual pleasure *svāhā*.

Having recited thus, he performs a *homa* with the previously mentioned types of fuel sticks in accordance with the previously described rules for preparing the corresponding seats and *homa* substances for the given rite. Igniting the fuel sticks with his hands, he offers all *homa* substances with the ladle and presents an oblation \(*āhuti*\) with the dish.36

In the absence of a ladle or a dish, he offers oblation with his hand into the mouth of Agni in the following manner. Seated on his throne, he stretches out his left arm and makes a boon-granting hand gesture \(*varada-mudrā*\) with his right hand. Then he offers *homa* with his right thumb and places it into the widely opened mouth of Vaiśvānara, who consumes it. While reciting these six *vajra* words *oṃ āḥ hūṃ ho haṃ kṣaḥ svāhā* 108 times, the *vajra* master offers oblations of grains, *durvā* grass, clarified butter, and milk. With these, he offers the fuel sticks of the bodily limbs with the mantra *hlṛ hraṃ ṝ hrīṃ hrāṃ hrā svāhā* 108 times. He then offers the fuel sticks of the psychophysical aggregates \(*skandha*s\) and elements \(*dhātu*s\) with the mantra *a ā i ī ṛ ṝ u ū ḹ aṃ aḥ svāhā* 108 times. He also offers the fuel sticks of the twelve sense bases \(*āyatana*s\) with the mantra *a ā e ai ar ār o au al āl aṃ aḥ svāhā* 108 times, and the fuel sticks with *ha hā ya yā ra rā va vā la lā haṃ haḥ svāhā* of the six faculties of action \(*karmendriya*s\) and the six sense objects \(*viṣaya*\) 108 times.37

These 540 \(5 x 108\) oblations to the god of fire are said to correspond to the 500 fuel sticks ignited in an external *homa* ritual. The 108 recitations of each aforementioned mantra are said to correspond to the thirty-two marks \(*lakṣaṇa*s\) and eighty secondary marks \(*vyañjana*s\) of the Buddha, minus these four: body, speech, mind, and gnosis. These four are represented by the four faces depicted on the central bead of the *vajra* master’s 108-bead *mālā*, which is used for the recitation of mantras during *homa* rituals. For the sake of the accumulation of merit \(*puṇya-saṃbhāra*\), the quantity of everything utilized in a *homa* of the all-effective rite must be 108.38

As for the oblation offered to the fire, the *vajra* master makes the offerings of grains prepared with the purified butter and *durvā* grass prepared with milk. After that, as a *vajrī* of rites who knows all the mantras and has the body of mantras \(*mantra-mūrti*\), he stands in a *paryaṅka* pose. Calm and with unwavering mind, he pours a prepared oblation, together with clarified butter, into a dish and offers it while reciting the mantra *oṃ hkṣmlvryaṃ*. Then he takes the food and water, performs benediction, and recites the following words:

Homage to gods\! May it be well with subjects, *svāhā*, and with kings. Libation of food to the ancestors, sufficient for spirits, *vaṣaṭ*39 to Indra\! \(*oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ*40 *svāhā namo devebhyaḥ svasti prajābhyaḥ svāhā rājabhyaḥ svadhā piṭrbhyaḥ alaṃ bhūtebhyaḥ vaṣaṭ indrāya*\)

Having done this, he tosses the food and drink outside the firepit, rinses his mouth with water, enters the *maṇḍala* palace, and rinses the mouth of Pavaka \(Agni\) with water infused with *kuśa* grass while reciting the mantra *oṃ āḥ hūṃ kāyavākcittasvabhāvaśuddha svāhā*. When kindling the fire in the firepit he is not to blow onto the fire with his mouth but only by fanning it.41

Agni, or Vaiśvānara, is said to be of three kinds. The first is the southern fire \(*dakṣiṇāgni*\), identified here with lightning that resides in a bow-shaped firepit in the heart *cakra*. The second is the domestic fire \(*gārhyapatya*\), which is identified with the sun that dwells in a circular firepit within the throat *cakra*; the third is the consecrated fire taken from the perpetual domestic fire \(*āhāvanīya*\), or the flesh-consuming fire \(*kravyāda*\), which is located in a quadrangular firepit within the navel *cakra*. Above these three fires, at the edge of darkness, where neither the light of lightning, the sun, the moon, or the planets shine, there is an additional fire, the fire of gnosis \(*jñānāgni*\). This fourth fire is of the nature of joy \(*ānanda*\) located in the secret and forehead *cakra*s, and it has been there since beginningless time. It is the flesh-consuming fire that ends cyclic existence and is therefore equal to the Fourth Noble Truth.42

It is said here that the meaning of the flesh-consuming fire should also be understood in this tantric system as being in accordance with the *Ṛg Veda*, 10.16.9: “I am dispatching the flesh-consuming fire far away. Removing the stains, may it go to King Yama\! May this other fire carry oblation to the gods\!”43

The interpretation of the correspondence of the flesh-consuming fire in the Kālacakra tradition’s internal *homa* with that of the aforementioned *Ṛg Veda* verse is seen in the following way. Reciting the mantra “*Oṃ* Vajra Agni, who incinerates all sins, O Vajrasattva, incinerate, incinerate every sin *svāhā*” \(*oṃ sarva-pāpa-dahana-vajrāgni vajrasattva sarva-pāpaṃ daha daha svāha*\), the *vajra* master invites the fire of sensual desire \(*kāmāgni*\) and recites the following mantra pledge \(*mantra*-*samaya*\) of the offering of oblation to the sun, the ruler of the seven days of the week, whose chariot is pulled by seven horses, and who has seven tongues: “*Oṃ vajra* Agni illuminate all beings, turn all evil people into ashes *hūṃ phaṭ svāhā*” \(*oṃ vajrānala sarvabhūtān jvālaya sarvān bhasmī-kuru sarva-jana-duṣṭān hūṃ phaṭ svāhā*\). In the case of pacification, the sun has the tongue of Soma \(the moon\); in the case of prosperity, he has the tongue of the sun; in the cases of killing or exorcism, he has the tongue of Saturn;44 in the case of subjugation, he has the tongue of Venus; in the case of attraction, he has the tongue of Jupiter; in the case of bewildering, he has the tongue of Mercury; and in the case of immobilizing, he has the tongue of Mars. Thus, Agni/Vajrasattva’s tongues of flame correspond to the colors and powers attributed to the aforementioned planets in accordance with the results of his flame.

Moreover, in accordance with the purification of each day of the week, the sun has one face in every rite. In accordance with the purification of one day and a night, he has two legs. In accordance with the purification of the four junctures of a day \(*sandhyā*\), he has four arms. In the rites of pacification and so on, and in the rite of killing he has two arms holding a knife and a skull cup due to the purification of Ketu. In the rite engendering animosity, he holds a sword and a skull due to the purification of Saturn. In the all-effective rite, he has two hands due to the purification of Rāhu and Kālāgni. The fire of sensual desire must be also invoked as a deity because it pervades all the days of the week, and the fire of gnosis should be worshiped as well. All this is seen as a method of invoking Vaiśvānara.45

After performing the *homa* ritual for Agni as described above, the *vajra* master rinses both his mouth and the mouth of Pavaka, and offers incense, perfume, and the like. Then, by means of exhalation, he emits the fire of gnosis from his own heart while reciting these words of mantra:

*Oṃ jāḥ* go, go, great light, to your own place. Satisfied, *ho*, you will again return when I send for a god *svāhā.* \(*oṃ jāḥ gaccha gaccha mahāraśmi svasthānaṃ saṃtṛpto ho*46 *punar āgamiṣyasi devasya yadā āhvayāmi svāhā*\)

When *homa* rituals, together with their mantras, are completed in this way, the *vajra* master is allowed to install a sand *maṇḍala* that represents the mind and body of the Buddha, and to initiate his disciples and offer them a pill consisting of the five *amṛta*s,47 placed in an oyster shell for the sake of purification. This prescribed procedure of a *homa* in the rite of worshiping Vaiśvānara is said to be applicable to all the tantras.48



### The Final *Homa* Ritual at the Conclusion of the Rite of Initiation

After the initiation and the tantric feast are completed, and prior to the dissolution of the *kālacakra*-*maṇḍala*, the *vajra* master once again performs a *homa* ritual in the same manner as he has previously done. Thus, the entire series of ritual actions constituting the rite of initiation begins and ends with *homa*.



## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, one could say that the *homa* ritual as understood and performed in this tantric system is yet another example of inter-rituality, the appropriation and adaptation of another tradition’s ritual forms and techniques that become validated by their efficacy. Perhaps no other ritual has been transported across the boundaries of different Indic traditions as much as the *homa*. The question remains whether the reason for this lies in something inhering thematically, structurally, and functionally in the *homa* that appeals to communally shared concerns and values, or has to do with other factors. Whatever the reasons, *homa*’s pervasiveness is testimony to the common perception of its relevance. In relation to the preceding *homa* rituals of other traditions, Buddhist tantric *homa* seems to be both a derivative and a responsive ritual act.

Whether external or internal, a *homa* ritual is seen as a coherent activity that mobilizes the forces of the natural world and transforms one’s experiences and perceptions. An external *homa* appeals to the invisible forces external to one’s body. It incites and at times even manipulates their responses. It derives its meaning not from within but from its convergence with other rituals and from its broader theoretical frameworks. It is filled with symbolic forms, utterances, and paradigmatic gestures that pattern worldly activities and prevent or redirect violence. In contrast, an internal *homa* appeals to the forces within and is founded on the principle of self-transformation. It activates the innate gnosis and therefore becomes a medium for the appearance of the ultimate reality and cognitive transformation. It is performed in privacy and requires from its performer a high degree of yogic and meditative expertise, whereas an external *homa*, which is performed publicly, requires knowledge of the world, its operations, and its ritual conventions.

[^15]: In this tantric system, Rāhu, considered to be the deity responsible for eclipses of the sun and the moon, represents the consciousness in the body of the individual; Kālāgni, usually known as the fire that incinerates the world at the time of destruction of the cosmos, represents the sexual heat in the lower part of the human body, referred to as “the fire of gnosis.”
