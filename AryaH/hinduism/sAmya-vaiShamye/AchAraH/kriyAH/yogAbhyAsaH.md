## Building daily yogAsana practice
Can learn from a teacher, videos or books - whatever suits you, desire to learn is most important. More importantly, you will learn from your long-term experience to suit your particular needs, ability and schedule. Whatever you learn, practice daily. If you can spare 15 minutes, come up with a variegated sequence of Asana-s which will last that time and which suits your body and mind - then go through it daily, making changes/ tuning as needed.
