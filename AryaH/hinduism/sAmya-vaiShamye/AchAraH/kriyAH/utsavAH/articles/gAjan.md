Today is Chaitra Sankranti. Today Bengali hindus in WB, Bangladesh & Tripura celebrates gajan with great fervour. Gajan is related to Shiva, Dharma thakur & Ma manasa - Though Gajan in Chaitra sankranti is related to Shiva. It ends today with Charak puja.

At Malda Gajan is known as Gambhira & at Jalpaiguri it is known as Gomira. Kali Dance is an important part of gajan. Also, Hara-Gauri Nritya, Kalika-Patari nritya, Samshan-nritya are all important part of gajan.

Charak puja is also known as Neel Puja. The persons who were involved in the festival become a Shiva Devotee and are respected by all, they are considered above normal humans. In earlier days the peasants who were involved in penances which involved piercing one‚Äôs tongue with sharp needles to hung oneself from sharp hooks hanging from wooden structures were respected by the Landlord.

Festival takes place in its full intensity for 3 days, starting before the day of Chaitra Sankaranti & ending the day after, it continues till the beginning on the... which signifies the rainy season.

These are arranged on the premise of the shiva temples, by the "gajan sanyasis". They dress up as Shiva, parvati, krishna & other deities. A Charak Tree is actually the trunk of a tree without any roots or branches. The height is around 30 to 40 feet. The trunk needs to be straight. The tree is worshipped by priests and then erected inside a ditch and is balanced by bamboos.

There are several customs such as Giri Sanyas, Babar Sanyas, Baan-sanyas, Betra-sanyas etc.

- Giri Sanyas :- one sadhu dress up as lord Hanuman and the act of bringing Gandhamadan parvat is performed by him.
- Babar Sanyas is abt breaking a branch of mango tree full of mangos.
- Baan-sanyas & Betra-sanyas is abt penance act performed by sanyasis. 
  
Infact penance act is a big part of gajan utsav. The Sanyasis perform their penance acts at the Charak tree on an empty ground as mentioned before. 

After these acts the tree is duly immersed into the river which is believed to visit the same ghat of the river next year. The Charak Sanyasis then brings it back to the puja ground. The Charak tree is believed to be the abode of Ardhanarishwar. An Idol/Mask is first attached to the top of a tree, before the worship & hoisting it up straight on the ground. Several people are engaged to pull it up. 

In some villages the mask is also referred to be that of Harakali. The penance part is abt sanyasi priests pierce sharp hooks at the bodies of participating sannyasis. However amazing part these are done with almost without any cut or injury.

There are too many famous Gajans in West Bengal. Among them most famous is probably Tarakeshwar at Hooghly. Gajan of Ishaneshwar mahadev at Burdwan, Ekteshwar at Bankura too are famous. Also Krishnadevpur(Bardhaman), Panchal(Bankura), Shantipur(Nadia), Baruipur & Joynagar(S 24 pargana), Beldanga & Kandi (Murshidabad), Bainan & Narna at Howrah, Shandeshwar at Hooghly are what comes to mind right now. This is by no means is a complete list. Almost every part of rural WB celebrates this festival. The list is too long. Some Gajans aren't for weak hearted like Krishnadevpur, Bainan etc. At Kotalipara(Faridpur,BD) it is mandatory to bath mahadev with with the Bali's bloodüôè. 

Gajans of Ma manasa or Dharma thakur are separate.Dharma raj gajan of Beliator (Bankura) at Purnima of Ashar month & Manasa gajan at Dashhara of Ayodhyagram(Bishnupur) are very famous. 

Kali Nritya, Gambhira, Ashtak gan deserves their own thread. Will write abt them in free time.
