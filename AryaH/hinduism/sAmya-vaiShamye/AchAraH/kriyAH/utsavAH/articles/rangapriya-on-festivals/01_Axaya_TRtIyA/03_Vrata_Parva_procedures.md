03 Vrata Parva procedures


Early in the morning on that day, bath should be taken in the *Gaṅgā* as a part of the *Vrata,* along with vows. \(वैशाखे शुक्लपक्षे तु तृतीयायां तथैव च । गङ्गातोये नरः स्नात्वा मुच्यते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ॥\) *\(Nirṇayasindhu\)* Those who cannot afford to bathe in the *Gaṅgā* directly, should invoke HER in the water in which they wish to take bath, worship her and then take the bath. And, purified by such a bath, they should worship their *ishṭadevatā* and especially *Lakshmīnārāyaṇa* and *Śrī Kṛshṇa,* along with the rituals for the manes.

> वैशाखस्य तृतीयायां श्रीसमेतं जगद्गुरुम् ।  
> नारायणं पूजयेच्च पुष्पधूपविलेपनैः ॥ 

It is very auspicious to apply sandal paste on the idol of Lord *Kṛshṇa* during his worship.

> यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनलेपितम् ।  
> वैशाखस्य सिते पक्षे स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ \(धर्मसिन्धु\) 

The *ŚrīKṛshṇamantra* should be chanted. *Tarpaṇa* should be performed for the *pitṛs* and *Pinḍapradāna* should be done. After that, gifts of wheat, barley, roasted barley powder, Bengal gram, many varieties of cooked rice, especially curd rice, a pot filled with water and other articles useful for the summer season, should be made to the suitable persons. And the gift of cash should also be made along with other gifts. Offering of gold is very auspicious. The rule of *Ekabhukta* \(i.e. eating only once\) should be observed on that day.
