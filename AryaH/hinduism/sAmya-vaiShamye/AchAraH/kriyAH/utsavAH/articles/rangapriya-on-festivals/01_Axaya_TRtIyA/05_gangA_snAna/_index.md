**d\) *Gaṅgā Snāna***

***Vidhi Vijnāna*\(Modalities\):** While discussing the rules of celebrating *Akshayatṛtīyā*, we have stated that a dip in the holy *Gaṅgā* is most auspicious. According to *Vagbhata*, even the \(regular\) bath taken in clean water on any day, is \(highly\) beneficial.

> दीपनं वृष्यमायुष्यं स्नानमूर्जाबलप्रदम् ।  
> कण्डूमलश्रमस्वेदतन्द्रातृड्दाहपाप्मजित्\(वाग्भट 2:15\) 

A bath stimulates *agni* in the stomach, increases the virility in the body, promotes long life and gives enthusiasm and strength. It removes itching, dirt, exhaustion, sweat, lethargic sleep, thirst, burning sensation, and sins. During *parvakālas*, water \(used for bathing\) possesses special powers to induce *puṇya*. Water used by *jnānis* and blessed by their grace is termed as *Tīrtha*. \(“ऋषिजुष्टजले गुरौ”-अमर\) \(यदध्यासितमर्हद्भिः तद्धि तीर्थं प्रचक्षते”-कुमारसम्भव सर्ग-6\) Taking a holy bath in that water cures not only bodily ailments but also mental illnesses.

		
Taking bath in clean water removes bodily dirt, sloth and fatigue and this is commonly experienced by all. But ordinary knowledge does not help in understanding how it can remove sins and bestow *puṇya*. Unless this is understood scientifically, the importance of having *Gaṅgāsnāna* on *akshyatṛtīyā* as prescribed by the *śāstras* cannot be known. Therefore we are taking this up for discussion. As a backdrop to this, we would like to give the commentary \(as commanded\) by Śrī Raṅgamahāguru pertaining to this.
