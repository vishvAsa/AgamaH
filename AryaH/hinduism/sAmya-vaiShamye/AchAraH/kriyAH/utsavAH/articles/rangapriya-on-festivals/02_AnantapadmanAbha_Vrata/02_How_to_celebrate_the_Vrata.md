02 How to celebrate the *Vrata*?


*Saṅkalpa* to perform this *vrata* should be done after bath and *ācamana*. And a *saṅkalpa* should be done for performing *YamunāPūja,* which is a part of the *Anantavrata*. \(This *yamunā pūja* should be performed by the side of a river, a lake or a pond or even near a well\)

> लोकपालस्तुतां देवीम् इन्द्रनीलसमप्रभाम् ।   
> यमुने त्वामहं ध्याये सर्वकामार्थसिद्धये ॥ 

> क्षीरोदार्णवसम्भूते क्षीरवर्णोपशोभिते ।   
> प्रसन्ना भव मे देवि यमुने ते नमो नमः ॥ 

And, as a part of the *Yamunāpūja*, the worship of \(the following viz\) *Tuṅga* who is *Sūryapādābjasambhūtā*, the dark hued *Kṛshṇaveṇi*, *Nandipādā, Bhīmarathī, Godāvari* river, deities and *Gaṅgadevī* should be performed. *Yamunādevī* should be worshipped with flowers. After the *Aṅgapūjā*, *nāmapūjā*, and *ashṭottaranāmapūjās* to *Yamunā* are performed, *uttarārādhana* should be done. All the services such as *Dhūpa, dīpa* etc should be offered. And river *Yamunā* should be praised \(with the sloka\):—

> विगाहे यामुनं तीर्थं साधु बृन्दावने स्थितम् ।   
> निरस्तजिह्मगस्पर्शे यत्र कृष्णः कृतादरः ॥ 

The worshipped *Kalaśa* which is filled with the water of *Yamunānadī—devī* who is the daughter of the Sun god, and sister of *Yamadharmarāja,* and who is dearest to *Padmanābha ŚrīKṛshṇa*, should be taken home along with *Maṅgalavādyas*. The *tīrtha* in the *Kalaśa* should to be added to the *Pūjākalaśa* of Lord *Ananta* and, on that \(*Kalaśa*\) the *darbha* knot, clothes, coconut and flowers should be arranged decoratively. That *darbha* knot should be in the shape of a seven hooded snake.
