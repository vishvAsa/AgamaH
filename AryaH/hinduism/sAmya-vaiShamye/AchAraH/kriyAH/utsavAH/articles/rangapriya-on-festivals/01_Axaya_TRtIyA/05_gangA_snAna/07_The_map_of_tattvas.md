title = "07 The map of tattvas"

+++

Śrī Raṅgamahāguru used to expound-“The basin of Gaṅgā and the holy pilgrimages along its banks are indeed the maps drawn in the land of Bhārata by mother nature. This can be made clear by one or two examples.

Lord *Mahādeva*, who had held *Gaṅgā* captive in his head, laid her down at *Bindusaras,* to bless *Bhagīratha*. We see in the *Rāmāyaṇa* that the river branched into seven streams while descending.

विससर्ज ततो गङ्गां हरो बिंदुसरः प्रति ।  
“तस्यां विसृज्यमानायां सप्तस्रोतांसि जज्ञिरे ॥ 

ह्लादिनी पावनी चैव नलिनी च तथोऽपरा ।  
तिस्रः प्राचीं दिशं जग्मुः गङ्गागाश्शिवजलाश्शुभाः ॥ 

> सुचक्षुश्चैव सीता च सिन्धुश्चैव महानदी ।  
तिस्रस्त्वेता दिशं जग्मुः प्रतीचीं तु शुभोदकाः ।  
> सप्तमी चान्वगात्तासां भगीरथमथो नृपम् ॥” 

We can observe a map that conforms to the inner design also, in the external form of *Gaṅgā*. This *Bindu* is an effulgent principle, which can be seen only by the inner vision of the *jnānis*. And *nāda* gets manifested out of that. Then the seven *prāṇas* are created. The universe is created next.

> बिंदोर्नादसमुद्भवः समुदिते नादे जगत्कारणम्”  
> “मध्ये फालं बिन्दुर्दीप इवाभाति वर्तुलाकारः”  
“सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति” 

At the origins of river *Gaṅgā*, we come across a *tīrtha* by name *Gomukha*. This happens to be the map of the principle that is responsible for the origin of speech.

The holy places related to *Gaṅgātīrtha* such as *Brahmakapāla*, *Brahmakunḍa*, *Haridvāra* and many others, belong to this category.

On the banks of Gaṅgātīrtha we see a bathing ghat called Maṇikarṇikā in the Kāśikshetra. Śrī Śaṅkaracārya in his stotra ‘Maṇikarṇikāshṭaka says that both Gods Hara and Hari vie with each other to bestow their world to those who take a bath here. This may sound like a funny story or like an arthavāda \(exaggeration either to praise or to disparage\). But we humbly remember here the explanation bestowed by ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru, based on his vision of truth and dharma that it is the external form of the philosophical truth \(tāttvik satya\). “Maṇi means God, a self luminous light. The words of the Vedas and also the scholars of the past exhort this. “अन्धो मणिमविन्दत्, तमनङ्गुलिरावयत्” “चिन्तारत्नं सुलभमिह नः” “आराधयामि मणिसन्निभमात्मलिङ्गम्” There are two nādīs associated with the place of vision of that luminous light within. One nādī takes a person to the abode of Vishṇu and the other to the abode of Śiva.” This was the description graced by ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru. The jnānis have given this name to it \(i.e Maṇikarṇika\) because the river Gaṅgā has formed two beds resembling the passage of these two nādīs.

Thus, *Gaṅgā* is chosen by Mother nature, as an important ‘line’ to draw the map of the abode of *tattva*. Those who take a dip at some special nodal centres of this line with their mind immersed in the divine meaning will travel in the abode of those principles only. With this, \(it can be known that\) *Gaṅgā* is giving a message to both intellectuals and sentimental people, that they should give up the path carved out by the evil, and take the path of the aforesaid maps.

In this article on *Akhshayatṛtīyā*, the discussion on the *Gaṅgā* has occupied a large part. Though this may appear to be an encroachment on the discussion of *Akshayatṛtīyā*, a lengthy analysis of *Gaṅgā* was necessitated because, this is a very important and useful matter in the study of all festivals, where the taking of the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* is prescribed. Now, we shall attempt answering some important questions regarding *Gaṅgā*, as a remaining part of this discussion.
