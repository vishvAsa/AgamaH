Answers that are perceptible to the extraordinary vision

But, when the disposition \(of a person\) is purified and the *tattvas* are pursued with an inner vision, it can be realized that they \(the form of *Gaṅgā* and the parapheralia\) are not mere imageries but sublime forms that are clearly and naturally visible in the divine ground. In the chapter *‘Devatā vigrahatattvādhikaraṇa* of the *Brahmasūtras*, the subject matter viz., whether the gods have forms or not, has been discussed, and it has been established that they do have forms. And, just because of this, one need not believe that \(gods have forms\). It should be clearly understood that they are forms which have been seen, being seen and are going to be seen, directly, by pious persons who undertake a spiritual inward journey in the body called *Brahmapura*. Also, it is not impossible that those principles and their paraphelnalia could be seen manifestly, by the will of God who is the almighty, *Satyakāma* and *Satyaksaṅkalpa*.

“They are the forms seen and described by the yogis”—these are the words of ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru the great yogi par excellence, who uttered from his own experience, and we remember them here with reverence.

The upward facing lotus which has adorned the hand of the holy *Gaṅgā*, is the thousand petalled lotus of the *yogis*. It has blossomed by the golden rays of the sun of divine knowledge. Even the *Kamanḍalu* in the shape of a lotus facing upwards held in her hand, is filled with the nectar of divine knowledge. The rosary is the canon of the universe. The beads in that are the principles under her control. Her shining eyes are not the representatives of the fickle fish. They are the steady eyes of a *jnāni*. Among them, in the middle, is the bright upward eye that is similar to the third eye in the region of the forehead of Lord *Mahādeva*.

\(Even though the eyes appear opened, the focus is inside. There is no movement of the eyelids. This is a *mudrā* called *Shāmbhavī mudrā-Vaishṇavī mudrā*, which is esoteric in all the *tantras*\)-This is precisely described in the *śāstras*. Anyhow her lotus, *Kamanḍalu*, eyes etc., have all taken the upward path, as can be seen in the words. “ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्थाः”

Now, about her vehicle *makara*. It is nothing but *avidyā*, which by its sharp jaws slashes the poor ignorant souls into pieces and devours them. But that goddesses of *vidyā*, who is an embodiment of divine knowledge, has conqured it and has transformed it as an instrument that takes the devotees to her divine abode. The *Upanishads* proclaim that ignorance can be a ladder that dismounts one to death, and can also be a boat which can make \(the souls\) to cross the \(ocean\) of death, and elevate them to immortality.

They acquire the above said second power when they come under the command of a *guru* who has a penetrating wisdom. In the present context, the *makara* which symbolizes the *avidya*, has almost obtained that capacity, as it has come under the rule of the goddess of *Vidya*. Because of the association with that goddess who is an embodiment of *Śuddhasattva* and who looks comely with her pure white complexion, even that crocodile has turned white.
