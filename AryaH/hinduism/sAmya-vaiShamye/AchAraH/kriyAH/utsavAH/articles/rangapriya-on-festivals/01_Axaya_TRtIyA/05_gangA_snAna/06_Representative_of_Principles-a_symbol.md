06 Representative of Principles-a symbol


“The river of *jnāna* and *dharma* itself is the spiritual *Gaṅgā*. This is nothing but the image of God in the form of water.”-So say the *jnānis*. Also, we come across compositions of *jnānis* which express the following sense.-“The *Idā* nādī in our body is *Gaṅgā*. *Piṅgalā* is *Yamunā* and *Sushumnā* is *Sarasvatī*. And the place of confluence of these three viz. the place of meditational immersion between eyebrows \(*bhrūmadhya* is nothing but the *tīrtharājaprayāga*.”

“काशीक्षेत्रं शरीरं त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा”  
> “सेयं जलमयी मूर्तिः शिवस्य परमेशितुः”  
> धर्मस्रोतोऽवहं तीर्थं शिवं कल्मषनाशनम्”  
> “इडा भागीरथीनाम्नी पिङ्गला यमुनानदी ।  
> तयोर्मध्ये स्थिता नाडी सुषुम्नाख्या सरस्वती ॥ 

*Jnānis* have done the *tattvasamyoga* here in the ascending and descending order, in the following manner—Placing the lucid vision in the river obtained by delving deep in the above said principles, remembering those principles while taking a bath in the river, and again delving in the principles.

We come across statements in scriptures which say that all the accumulated sins will get redeemed by taking a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā*. “सर्वपापहरां शिवाम्.” We also see statements such as “A person bereft of spiritual knowledge, cannot attain salvation by any means, even if he takes a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā*, or performs rituals or offers great gifts. “कुरुते गङ्गासागरगमनं व्रतपरिपालनमथवा दानम् । ज्ञानविहीनः सर्वमतेन मुक्तिं न भजति जन्मशतेन” These two statements appear to be contradictory. But when seen in the background of the above *tattvasamyoga* principles, they concur with each other. Undoubtedly, the evil impressions present in our inner and outer nature get washed out and the divine knowledge in the form of bliss, and *dharma* which is its natural disposition, flow naturally in us, if *Gaṅgātīrtha* is taken with the faith that it is a spring of *jnāntattva* and *dharmatattva*.
