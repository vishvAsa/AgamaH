06 Modalities \(of worship\)


**Worship of God:** It is a part of *Nityakarma* to worship god mentally and also to worship in detail externally, in keeping with the grandeur of the festival. Sandal paste and barley are specially prescribed for offering to god during worship on *Akshaya Tṛtīya*. Let us now discuss the appropriateness of those two \(prescribed\) for offering.

यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनभूषितम् ।  
> अर्पयेद्धान्यराजं च स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ 

One who decorates Lord *Kṛshṇa* with sandal paste on *Tṛtīyā* and offers him barley the king of cereals, he will attain *Vaikunṭha*. As *akshaya tṛitīyā* falls in the latter part of *Vasanta* which is very close to *Grīshma*, some *śāstra* texts term it as summer season only.

वैशाखज्येष्ठौ ग्रीष्मः \(सुश्रुतसूत्र 6-10\) 

Whatever may be the definition of the month, it is a time of strong currents of wind, and the body gets dry because of increase in temperature in nature due to sun’s heat, and thirst increases. Sandal paste controls all these detriments.

> चन्दनं शीतलं रूक्षं तिक्माह्लादनं लघु ।  
श्रमदोषविषश्लेष्मतृष्णापित्तास्रदाहनुत्” ॥\(भावप्रकाश-कर्पूरादिवर्ग\) 

\(*Śrīgandha* provides cooling effect, is fragrant, drying, bitter, delightful and light. It relieves tiredness, dryness, toxic effects, phlegm, thirst, *raktapitta* and burning sensation.\)

Sandal paste in one among the important substances offered in the external worship of God. *Pūjakalpas* consider it very auspicious in using it for smearing on idols of God and for the offering of *abhisheka* with it’s water. Though there are many substances with good fragrance, sandal paste is considered best among them and also as the one very dear to Goddess *Śrīdevi* and thus it is called *‘Śrīgandha’*. As it is also delightful, it is called *‘candana’* \(*cadi āhlādane*\)’ In addition to this, there is an element in the *Śrīgandha* which provides inspiration to get divine feelings, when offered in the freshly ground state for worship. When a piece of *Śrīgandha* is being ground on the stone, the pure sandal \(paste\) obtained after the upper layer of dirt is removed, gets ready for offering in the worship of God. In this aspect, *Śrīgandha* reminds us of a Yogic experience, in which, due to the churning or grinding in the form of *dhyāna*, the bad *vāsanās* of the mind surface first in the upper layers \(of the mind\), and after they vanish, as the mind gets near *‘Mānasaspati’* the Almighty who is deep inside, good *vāsanas* appear and get offered to God. That’s why a great *yogi* by name *Śathāri* prays to God with the words, ‘Lord, My mind is the sandal to anoint you. *Pūśum Sāndum Neñjame’*.

The words

> यथा चन्दनागर्वादेः उदकादिसम्बन्धजक्लेदादिजमौपाधिकम्  
> दौर्गन्ध्यं तत्स्वरूपनिघर्षणेन आच्छाद्यते स्वेन पारमार्थिकेन गन्धेन” 

in the *Īśāvasyabhāshya* of *Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavatpāda* may be remembered here. We also humbly remember here the words of Śrīraṅgamahāguru, who said “we have to grind our lives, like the stump of sandal wood, in the service of the Almighty.”

A question arises in the mind of laymen here. Let us agree with the view of *Āyurveda* that *Śrīgandha* is a great subtance and we should apply it on the body during festivals. The ailments of the body are removed by that and the mind gets delighted. O.K. But why should it be applied on the idol of God who is free from ailments and who is unattached? Why should it \(i.e. the idol\) be given a sandal water bath?’ This question may invade the mind. The answer to this should be gathered with discrimination. God has no need of this offering of sandal \(paste\). The *Upanishads* declare him as *‘Agandha’* and *‘Sarvagandha’* as well.

So, keeping aside the thought that the sandal paste is meant for ‘we people’ who are stained with blemishful dispositions and when offered with a pure mind to God who is *Nityaśuddha* and *Nirañjana* and taken as *prasāda* after that, it becomes most divinely enjoyable because, the *Śrīgandha* here gets associated with *Brahmagandha* also. Ailments of both the body and the mind get removed. The *Bhogadravya* becomes a *yogadravya*. We are transported to pure piousness, because of an upward proclivity. It is for this intent, it should be offered to God.

Also, when sandal paste is applied to the great *Sāligrama* or a *Śivalinga*, it’s inherent quality increases further by their contact. And when one takes it with the sentiment of *prasāda*, he obtains both *śreyas* and *preyas*.

Now about barley. “It is the king among cereals” say the *śāstras*. \(*Yavosi Dhānyarājosi*\). In *Śrīmad Bhāgavatha*, Lord *Kṛshṇa* tells *Uddhava*. “I am barley among grains.” \(*Oshadhīnāmaham Yavah*\).

यवः कषायो मधुरः शीतलो लेखनो मृदुः ।  
> कण्ठत्वगामयश्लेष्मपित्तमेदः प्रणाशनः ॥  
> पीनसश्वासकासोरुस्तम्भलोहिततृट्प्रणुत् ॥ 

\(It is astringent, sweet, cool and tender. It is a panacea for throat pain, skin diseases, phlegm, acidity and obesity. It cures diseases like catarrh, breathing problem, cough, pain in the muscles of the thigh, diseases of blood and thirst.\) Thus the *Ayurveda* describes the qualities of barley. Consumption of this in the seasons of *Vasanta* and *Grīshma* proves highly beneficial.

Using such a great substance just to gratify our senses is beastliness. It is right conduct for humans to offer it at least on the day of an auspicious festival to *Hṛshīkeśa* \(the Lord of our *Indriyas*, and *Paśupathi* \(Lord of all living beings\) and take it as *prasāda*.

		
**2\) *Pitṛ Pūja.*** “The word *Pitṛ* means one’s father and the ancestors in the family. One should serve them as long as they are alive. This itself is *pitṛpūja* or *pitṛyajna*. Other than this, performing *śrāddha* after death and offering of *tarpaṇa* etc are nothing but blind belief.”—some people say. It is better to treat this topic in a separate chapter called *Pitṛyajna.* For the time being, we wish to state that the *pitṛs* are a class of deities. *Vasu*, *Rudra*, *Āditya*, *Kavyavāhana*, *Agnishvātta* are some of the other names of *pitṛs*. Just as *Brahma* and other gods are to be worshipped with modalities in a distinct time, they \(the *pitṛs*\) also are to be worshipped in a distinct time with modalities. Those who worship them accordingly, will be duly bestowed with desired things. The word *pitṛ* also denotes the father, grand father and the great grand father. No doubt, they should be served. But, they should not be mistaken for *‘Pitṛdevatās’* in the context of *‘Pitṛyajna’* where that word \(i.e. *Pitṛdevatās*\) is used in the technical sense. This is our humble request.

Persons supposed to offer *tarpaṇa* and *pinḍapradān*a to the *pitṛdevatās* on the day of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, will be graced by them.

**3\) *Dāna:*** *Śāstras* state that gifts are to be made after worship of gods and *pitṛ devatās*. This concept of *dāna* also requires a detailed discussion in a separate chapter. This has been alluded to in the introductory section also. For the time being a few important points may be remembered in brief.

The term *dāna* referred to here is not one of the four *upāyas* \(means of success\) namely *sāma, dāna, bheda* and *danḍa* in the path of the work-a-day world. It is an humble gift conforming to the *śāstras*, made either with the pure thought of making an offering to God or with a wish for the accomplishment of desires. Lord \(*Kṛshṇa*\) proclaims this as *‘Pāvana’* like *yajna* and *tapas*.

> यज्ञो दानं तपश्यैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् 

*Śrīmadbhāgavata* lauds this as a means of *dravyaśuddhi*. *Srutis* also praise the glory of this—“शुद्ध्यन्ति दानैः सन्तुष्ट्या द्रव्याणि” “यज्ञेन दानेन तपसा अनाशकेन” “तस्माद्दानं परमं वदन्ति” *Śāstras* state “Those who do not gift in the form of *dāna*, but enjoy pleasures for themselves will meet with misfortunes. The one who gives-away, benefits greatly.”

Here a question arises in the minds of laymen-“True, the person who receives the gifts is benefited. But the donor who parts with the gift, obviously stands as the loser. No gain is seen on his part, isn’t it?” We would like to briefly answer this in the words of *jnānis*. They say-“If a person gives-away with either hypocrisy or insolence, or makes a gift not conforming to regulations of the *śāstras*, or in the wrong place or time, or to a wrong person, such a gift does not fetch any good result. But if done in the proper place and time to a proper person, it does fetch great rewards. Such a gift takes the form of the highly valuable *‘puṇya’*, and goes on increasing in the mind-bank of a person, and in the opportune time, yields results thousand fold to the donor.” This is our concise answer. The matter of *puṇya* and *pāpa* has been already explained previously, in the discussion on the topic of *Gaṅgāsnāna*.

The substance offered as a gift should be good and pleasing. The *Kaṭhopanishad* decries an arrogant person who gave a gift of old and non-milch cows which could not even eat fodder or drink water. \(*Katha*-Chap 1\). People void of judgement have created niggardly words such as coconuts of *dāna*, ghee of *homa* etc. This is indeed undoubtedly reprehensible.

Places such as a holy place of pilgrimage, a temple, and a *yajnabhūmi* are some of the best places for giving gifts. Times such as the time of eclipses and nodal times like *saṅkrāntis* are the best times for giving gifts. A *Brahmajnāni*, a *śrotriya*, a man with a large family, a poor person, a weak person, a person in danger etc., are all the most deserving ones for gifts, in keeping with propriety. In this way making right gifts at the suitable time, place, and to the deserving ones with discrimination, brings in amazingly huge rewards.

*Akshaya Tṛtīyā* is also one such excellent timefor making gifts. The special things that are prescribed for gifting on that day are barley powder, fried barley, Bengalgram, curd rice, water and a *pūrṇakumbha*. Among these we have already noted the greatness of barley. Likewise the dry fried powder of barley is also excellent.

> यवजाः सक्तवः शीताः दीपना लघवः सराः ।  
> कफपित्तहरा रूक्षा लेखनाश्च प्रकीर्तिताः ॥ 

> ते पीता बलदा हृष्या बृंहणा मेदनास्तथा ।  
> तर्पणा मधुरा रूक्षाः परिणामे बलावहाः ॥ 

> कफपित्तश्रमक्षुत्तृट्व्रणनेत्रामयापहाः ।  
> प्रशस्ता घर्मदाहाध्वव्यायामार्तशरीरिणाम्”\(भावप्रकाश-कर्पूरादिवर्ग\) 

The dry fried powder of barley causes a cooling effect, improves digestion, is light, clears wastes from the body, removes phleghm and *pitta,* and is dry. When consumed, it provides strength, happiness, increase in virility and fat. Causes satisfaction, sweetness, and results in the increase of stamina. It removes *Kaphapitta*, exhaustion, hunger, thirst and heals wounds, and is curative of eye diseases. The science of medicine praises its quality as one which is excellent for people who are worn out with the thirst of summer and travel. Gifting of such an excellent substance in the hot summer yields a great reward and so there is no need to explain the propriety of that time \(for gifting\). It is very clear that gifting of curd rice and water in summer, is also most proper. The merit of bengalgram has been already described in the discussion of *Hanumajjayanti*.

A little elaboration needs to be provided pertaining to the gift of *pūrnakumbha*. Gifting of cold water and a vessel filled with it in summer, becomes highly useful to all. Even common sense tells that highly useful things when gifted result in great *puṇya*. But in the vision of *jnānis*, this *pūrṇakumbha* is one which is filled with the riches of divine wealth also. It is suggestive of the supreme entity who is complete and an embodiment of nine *rasas*, as is evident from the words of the *śṛutis*.

“ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते । पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते”

It is also an image of the supreme *yogi* who is completely immersed in HIM. The silence of the *Kumbha* which is filled with water, is also symbolic of the great quietness of a *Yogi* in *Samādhi* who is a *Rasapūrṇa*. It also reminds us of the stillness of the *Kumbhakayoga* which is a form of complete arrest of the *praṇa* and *Apāṇa*. The shape of the *kumbha* being narrow at the bottom, wide in the center and again narrow at the top, represents the cosmos that is subject to creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe, and the principle of *Trimūrti* carried out by God. We can see this meaning in the *ślokas* of the *mantras* recited during *Kalaśapūja*.

Not that the *Purṇakumbha* has only this wealth of meaning in the eyes of the *jnānis*; even the sight or touch of such a pot can remove sufferings and can cause bliss. Worshipping of such a *pūrṇakumbha* as per modalities in the nodal time of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā,* and gifting it to the deserving person during worship, yields inexhaustible results undoubtedly.

**4\) One time fasting:**We shall discuss this topic while deliberating on the observance of *Prathamaikādaśī*. Some people may object—* “Akshaya Tṛtīyā* is not a big festival. Ours is a poor country. We cannot afford to celebrate it.” They should understand that the benefit of celebrating of the festival accrues to them, even if they take up meditation and worship of god in the available time, if they cannot afford to celebrate the festival. Thus, if the *Akshaya Tṛtīyā* festival is celebrated in keeping with the science of time, materials and modalities pertaining to that day, imperishable results will be obtained in the true sense. When even the intellectual science pertaining to this can bestow brilliance and tranquility in us, what doubt can be there in \(the truth\) that it yields imperishable benefits when it is brought into practice? Many salutations to the glory of the *jnāna* and *vijnāna* of the *guruparamātman* who resides in the *guha.* Only because of that,\(glory\), the benefit of the above said *jnānavijnāna* has been obtained by us.
