03 Gaṅgā - ailments and health

2. The power of Gaṅgā to cure ailments and to bestow health.

Many Ayurvedic texts tell us that, besides absolving people of sins, and blessing with *Sadgati*, the water of *Gaṅgā* is very tasty, removes a number of diseases, and helps to acquire good health.

“All the rivers which take their origin on the slopes of the *Himālaya* mountains have medicinal value. Their waters consumed by *devarshis* are really beneficial” says *Caraka*.

> हिमवत्प्रभवाः पथ्याः पथ्याः देवर्षिसेविताः । 

The prince of ayurvedic physicians by name *Cakrapāṇidatta*, confirms this view point.

“यथोक्तलक्षणहिमवत्प्रभवत्वादेव गाङ्गं पथ्यम् ।” 

*Vagbhata’s Ashṭāngahṛdaya* also states that these \(rivers\) do have medicinal properties, and are enduring *tīrthas*.

> “हिमवन्मलयोद्भूताः पथ्यास्ता एव च स्थिराः ।” 

A work by name *Bhojanakutūhala* showers rains of praises thus:-*“Gaṅgatīrtha* is cool, sweetish, clean, very tasty, suitable to health, digestive, improves digestion, removes sins, relieves thirst, quells infatuation, increases appetite and sharpens the intellect.”

> शीतं स्वादु स्वच्छमत्यन्तरुच्यं पथ्यं पाक्यं पाचनं पापहारि ।  
> तृष्णामोहध्वंसनं दीपनं च प्रज्ञां धत्ते वारि भागीरथीजम् ॥
