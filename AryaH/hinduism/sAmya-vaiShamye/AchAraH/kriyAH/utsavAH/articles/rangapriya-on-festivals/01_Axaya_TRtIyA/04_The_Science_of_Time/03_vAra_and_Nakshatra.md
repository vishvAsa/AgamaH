**C. *Vāra and Nakshatra***. *Yogis* says that if on that day, there is a conjunction of *Rohiṇī* with either Monday or Wednesday, it is a \(rare\) *Yoga* which is a result of imperishable good deeds. This is because, those two days and *Rohiṇī* are very auspicious days for the worship of Lord *Kṛshṇa*. So, on *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, it is only *ŚrīKṛshṇa* who is to be specially worshipped after the worship of the *ishṭadevatā* isn’t it?

> यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनलेपितम् ।  
> वैशाखस्य सिते पक्षे स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ 

\(We shall explain how the \(conjunction of the\) above said day and star \(*Rohiṇī*\) match well for the worship of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, in the chapter of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayantī.*\)
