03 Worship of *AnantaPadmanābha*


The number fouteen is a fixed number very dear to *AnantaPadmanābha*. The day of his *pūja* is the fourteenth day of *Śuklapaksha*. The number of knots in the thread in which is he invoked, should be fourteen etc. After invoking Lord *Ananta* in both the *Kalaśas*, the following should be done viz *saṅkalpa, Sarvopacārapūja Kalaśapūja, Praṇapratishṭhā, Dvārapālādiparivārapūjā, Dikpālaka pūjā, aṅga pūjā, pūjā* with leaves and flowers \(even red coloured flowers are best\), invoking *śesha* in fourteen darbha knots, *śeshapūja*, *Pūja* of fourteen *doragranthis*. and āvāhana. After *āvāhana*, these fourteen *granthi devatās* \(deities of knots\) viz., *Vishṇu, agni*, *Sūrya*, *Indra, Brahma, Vāyu, Śiva, Vighneśa, Skanda, Soma, Ākaśa, Varuṇa, Pṛthvi* and *Vasus* should be worshipped. And then *pūjā* should be done with *nāmāvalis* and *Ashṭtottara Śatanāmāvalis* addressing *Ananta*.

*AnantaPadmanābha* can be worshipped in a *kumbha* and also in a *manḍala*, an idol, or even in a picture. He can also be meditated upon and worshipped in the abovesaid form, as seen in *Tiruvanantapuram*. Or, he can be meditated upon and worshipped in the form, where he is seen resting on the seven hooded *Ādiśesha* in *Kshīrasāgara*, Four armed holding a lotus in his right hand and a conch in the lower right hand, a disc in the left hand and the mace in the lower left hand, and attended by *Śrī, Bhū* and *Nīlādevīs*, servants like *Garuḍa*, deities, sages like *Sanaka* and the seven sages such as *Bhṛgu* etc. The *dhyānaśloka* \(for that worship\) is as follows:

> कृत्वा दर्भमयं देवं वारांनिधिसमप्रभम् ।   
> फणसप्तान्विते सर्पे पिङ्गलाक्षं चतुर्भुजम् ॥ 

> दक्षिणाग्रकरे चक्रं गदां तस्याप्यधःकरे ।   
> शङ्खमूर्ध्वकरे वामे पद्मं तस्याप्यधःकरे ॥ 

> दधानं सर्वलोकेशं सर्वाभरणभूषितम् ।   
> दुग्धाब्धिमध्ये संस्थाप्य तत आवाहयेत् सुधीः ॥ 

The Lord is resting on a seven headed *Śesha* in *Kshīrasāgara*. He is dark complexioned, has four shoulders, holds five weapons such as *Śankha* and *cakra*. He is being served by *Garuḍa* and *Vishvaksena*, and is accompanied by *Śrī-Bhū-Nīlā Devīs*, and *Dvārapālakas*. He is worshipped by *Brahma, Indra* and other *devatās*. He is attended upon by *Siddhas* like *Sanaka* etc and seven sages like *Bhṛgu* etc. He holds a disc in the upper right hand and a mace in the lower one, a conch in the upper left hand and a lotus in the lower one. He should be offered *Shoḍaśopacāras* in detail. Also, pūja of fourteen *āvaraṇa devatās*, *pūja* with fourteen *patras* and fourteen *pushpas*, and *pūja* with fourteen *doragranthis* should be offered to him. Fourteen types of *bhakshyas* \(eatables\) should be offered to him. They are—

1. *puri unḍe* 
2. *pullangāyi unḍe* 
3. *Tuṇitenkoḷalu* 
4. *araḷunḍe*, 
5. *Cakkuli* 
6. *Thenkoḷalu*, 
7. *muccore*, 
8. *Kāyi obbattu* 
9. *Sajjappa*. 
10. *Āmbode*. 
11. *Kārāseve* 
12. *Kobbari Miṭhāyi* 
13. *Kadubu* 
14. *Atirasa* 
15. Butter \(mixed with saffron, Cardamon and sugar\) and, 
16. beaten rice mixed with jaggery. \(beaten rice should be prepared at home with purity\) 

Each one of these items should be prepared in twenty eight numbers and after offering them to God, fourteen from each of the items should be offered to *ṛthviks*. The rest fourteen should be retained as *prasāda*. And, the services viz *tambūla samarpaṇa*, *uttara nīrājana*, *arghya*, *pradakshiṇa* and *namaskāra* should be offered.

Then, new *doragrahaṇa* \(is done next\), reciting the *śloka*

> अनन्तकामदं देव सर्वपापप्रणाशन ।   
अनन्तदोररूपेण पुत्रपौत्रान्प्रवर्धय ॥   
> अनन्तसंसारमहासमुद्रे मग्नं समभ्युद्धर वासुदेव ।   
> अनन्तरूपिन् विनियोजयस्व ह्यनन्तसूत्राय नमो नमस्ते ॥ 

And saluting God, the *dora* should be tied to the right wrist. The following *śloka* is chanted during *dorabandhana*:

> संसारगह्व्रगुहासु सुखं विहर्तुं   
> वाञ्छन्ति ये कुरुकुलोद्भव शुद्धसत्त्वाः ।   
> सम्पूज्य च त्रिभुवनेशमनन्तदेवम्   
> बध्नन्ति दक्षिणकरे वरदोरकं ते ॥ 

The worn out old *dora* should be discarded chanting

> नमस्ते सर्वदेवाय विश्वरूपधराय च ।   
> सूत्रगन्थिषु संस्थाय अनन्ताय नमो नमः ॥ 

The last part of the *Vrata* is *upāyana dāna*. \(The *Kalaśa* of *Āvāhana*, *vastra*, *dakshiṇā* and half of the *naivedya* offered to God should given as *dāna* to *srotriyas*\)

> गृहाणेदं द्विजश्रेष्ठ वायनं दक्षिणायुतम् ।   
> त्वत्प्रसादात् व्रती देव मुच्यते कर्मबन्धनात् ॥   
> अनन्तः प्रतिगृणाति अनन्तो वै ददाति च ।   
> अनन्तस्तारकोभाभ्यां अनन्ताय नमो नमः॥ 

The hymn *“Devasyatvā”* should be chanted while offering the *dāna,* and also during the *Pratigraha*. *Pūjā* should be performed again. And *Anusandhāna* should to be done with the wish that Lord *Anantapadmanābha* may become pleased, graceful and may grant boons.

“अनया पूजया भगवान् सर्वात्मकः अनन्तपद्मनाभः सुप्रीतः सुप्रसन्नो वरदो भवतु”

The story of *AnantaVrata* should be listened to, after the worship.

An important point to be taken note of regarding *Ananta Vrata* is that the number fourteen is significant in this *Vrata*. The day of his *vrata* is *Caturdaśī*. The number of knots in the threads that are tied to the hand in his worship is fourteen. The number of deities in the *Āvaraṇapūja* is fourteen. The number of leaves, flowers and items for *Naivedya* are all fourteen. *Udyāpana* is also after fourteen years. This unique number is symbolic of the fact that the entire universe consisting of the fourteen worlds is under his unabridged reign. *Ādiśesha* who happens to be his couch is *Ananta*. He \(i.e. *Ādiśesha*\) is adored with infinite qualities and endowed with endless power and is totally *Śeshabhūta* to *Anantapadmanābha*. Remaining in close proximity to him, he happens to be the foremost recipient of his *Śeshaprasāda*.

***“Garuḍa* and serpants are enemies by birth. But in the vicinity of *Ananthapadmanābha,* both are friendly and are completely at his service. *Garuḍa* is not gandering at his wings and *Śeshanāga* is not worried about his hoods. Because, the gazes of both of them are fixed at *Nārāyaṇa* who is the eternally blissful Lord.”—These were the words of *Śrī Gurudeva* pertaining to this.** *Kālidāsa* also describes this as “मुक्तशेषविरोधेन”. \(“The one who has not an iota of enemity with *Ādiśesha*”\) *Nāgasarpas* are of different colours and kinds. But this *Nāgarāja Ādiśesha* is pure white in complexion, as described by the *aḷvārs* who were greatest devotees. “Vellattaravil tuyil amarndavittinai”. He is of pure bright white colors is of pure bright white colors is full of pure *Sattvaguṇa*, and not a smidgen of *rajas* and *tamas* is found in him. This *Anantanāgarāja* has one thousand hoods.

The *purāṇas* say that this entire earth is perched on one of his thousand hoods, like a mustard grain. In the images and pictures in temples, he is seen with five or seven hoods. Which is this strange \(imaginary\) serpent?

One may say no such snake carrying the earth is seen around. Yes, it is not the physical serpent. This *Śeshasarpa* is the very *Kunḍalinī Śakti* which is described in *Yogaśastra* and visualized by *jnānis*. As it has countless *Vrttis*, it is called as a thousand hooded serpent, say the *jnānis.* The *jnānis* who witness it say that the *Prāṇaśakti* \(*Kunḍalini*\) in our *pinda* \(body\) which has five *vṛttis* such as *prāṇa, Apāna* etc. or seven *Vṛttis,* is itself *Ādiśesha* as expressed in “सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति”. That is why the *Ādiśesha* who is both the couch and umbrella etc to the Lord, is shown as a five hooded or a seven hooded serpent. One can see this *Śeshanāga* whom the *yogis* who are *jnānis* have seen with the *Jnanadṛshṭi* and described, only after obtaining the inner eye.

*Yogis* see this *AnantaPadmanābha* who rests on this *Anantanāga*. We wish that the external worship offered to Lord *Padmanābha* helps us to obtain the *Yogadṛshṭi* and *Jnānadrshṭi* which are needed for that.

We noted that as per precepts, fourteen pairs of *Bhakshaṇas* should to be prepared and offered as *Naivedya* in the worship of *Ananta*. What should one do if he cannot afford to prepare so many *Bhakshaṇas*? It will be O.K. even if one item among them viz. *Sajjappa* is prepared and offered. God will be pleased even if fruits are offered. Those who can afford, many prepare all of them in fourteen numbers which is a mystrical, significant number and offer them for the awakening of the spiritual centres, and for bliss.

It is prescribed that at the end of the *Pūjā*, half of the things used for the worship of God viz the pot, the idol, clothes and the *Bhakshaṇa* and *Naivedya* etc., should be gifted to *Srotriyas*.

But, eligible recepients who are austere, do not \(generally\) receive \(any gifts\) from others. In such a case, without finding out whether a person is *satpātra* or *apātra*, can those things be gifted as *dāna* to anyone that comes by at that moment?

No. A *dāna* should be given to *satpātras* only. *Dāna* should be made after meditating upon God and with the sentimental feeling that all the items of gift are *Brahmasvarūpas*. The *dāni* also should receive it with the same *Brahambhāva*. Divine observances should be completed without any blemish touching anyone on both the sides. It is for this very reason, the following *sloka*, the purport of which is, “everything is *Anantapadmanābha Svarūpam”* should be chanted and reflected upon.

> अनन्तः प्रतिगृहणाति अनन्तो वै ददाति च ।   
> द्वयोश्च तारकोऽनन्तः अनन्ताय नमो नमः॥ 

The person who receives the *dāna* is also *Ananta*, the person who gives it is also *Ananta* and the divine force that helps the two to attain salvation is also *Ananta*. We salute Lord *Ananta* again and again.
