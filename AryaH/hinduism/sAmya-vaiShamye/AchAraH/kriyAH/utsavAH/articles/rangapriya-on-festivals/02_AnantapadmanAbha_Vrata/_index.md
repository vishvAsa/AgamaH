02 ānantapadmanābha Vrata

\(Anantana Caturdaśī-Anantana Habba\)

**The *Āradhya Deva* of this *Anantana Vrata***

*Ananta Padmanābha Vrata* is one of the auspicious *parvas* observed by a vast number of *sanātana Ārya Bhāratīyas*. It is called *AnantanaVrata* as it is a day of austerity of deity worship, and many precepts of *Vratas* have to be followed on that day. The term *Ananta* means ‘king of serpents’, and also *Ādiśesha* the *Śeshanāga*.

“शेषोऽनन्तो नागराजः”

The meaning of the component parts of this term is ‘the one who has no end’. *Ādiśesha* has this name because he is the form of the *prāṇaśakti* \(*Kuṅḍalini*\) of the Lord, who has infinite power.

This term *Ananta* also refers to the the great Lord *Ādinārāyaṇa* who is a *Śeshī* for this endless *Śeshanāga*, whom the Lord has employed \(in his service\) as a couch, a seat, an adornment, the royal white umbrella, a jewel lamp and *Pādukā* \(Sandal\)

“नमोऽस्त्वनन्ताय सहस्रमूर्तये” As his \(i.e. *Śeshanāga’s*\) forms, qualities, powers and glories are all endless, this word \(*Ananta*\) befits him also.

“अनन्तवीर्यामृतविक्रमस्त्वम्”

“अनन्त”is the name in short of that *Nārāyaṇa* the Lord of Lords, who is called *Anantaśayana* as he has made *Anantanāga* his couch, and is also called *Anantapadmanābha,* as he has the navel which is the origin of *Brahma*.

There are three types among the idols of *Nārāyaṇa* who rests on *Anantanāga*. The first one is *Raṅganātha*. He has only two arms. He has no weapons in his hands. He has neither the lotus projecting out of his navel nor Lord *Brahma* on it. The Lord is in the posture of deep sleep placing one of this arms as a pillow. This idol can be seen in *ŚriRaṅgam, Śriraṅgapattaṇam. Śivanasamudra, Raṅgasthala* and some other places.

The second one is *Govindarāja*. He has four arms. He has *śankha*, *cakra* and *gadā* in three hands. The other arm is stretched \(forward\). He is in the posture of having eyes partially opened just after getting up from sleep. *Brahma* is seen sitting on the lotus flower. *Madhu* and *Kaiṭabha* are seen sitting at his lotus feet with folded hands. One can have the *darśan* of this *Govindarāja* in *Govindarājapattaṇa* which is at the foot of *Tirumala* \(*Tirupati*\), and in the *Sannidhi* opposite to that of Lord *Naṭarāja* of the *Cidambara* temple of *Cidambaram*, and in *Kalkunṭe* which is near *Chikkatirupati* \(which is\) near Bangalore.

The third is *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*. He has two arms. Of them, the left arm is raised holding a downward faced lotus at the level of his neck. In the outstretched right lower arm, he appears to be covering a *śivaliṅga*. The Lord is shining in the posture of gracing the sages who are wishing him *Suprabhātam* with his broad eyes, just after waking up from *Yoganidrā*.

> योगनिद्रान्तविशदैः पावनैरवलोकनैः ।   
> भृग्वादीननुगृहणन्तं सौख्यशायिनिकानृषीन् ॥ 

The four faced *Brahma* is beaming in the *Padmāsana* posture in the lotus navel of the Lord. One can see this idol in *Tiruvanantapuram*. The *dhyānaśloka* is as follows:—

> श्रीकृष्णं क्षेत्रपालं ध्वजबलिसहितं भूतनाथं नृसिह्मम्   
> व्यासम् शम्भुं गणेशं रघुवरमनुजं जानकीं वायुपुत्रम् ।   
> विष्वक्सेनं सुपर्णं सुरमुनिकमलाभूमिब्रह्मादिसेव्यम्   
> वन्दे श्रीपद्मनाभं परमपदमहोपन्नगाभोगसुप्तम् ॥ 

I salute *Padmanābha* the Lord of the highest abode who is resting on *Anantaśeshanāga*, and who is being attended by *SrīKṛshṇa, Kshetrapālaka, Dhvajabali, Bhūtanātha, Śāstā, Yogānṛsimha, Vyāsa, Śiva, Gaṇeśa, ŚrīRāmaśītā Lakshmaṇa, Hanumanta Vishvaksena, Garuḍa, devatās, sages, ŚrīDevi, Bhūdevi* and *Brahmadeva*, *Sanakādisiddhas, Tumburu Nāradas, Saptarshis, Sūrya* and *Candra, Dikpālakas*, and *Jaya Vijayas*. As all these three are *Śeshanāga Anantamūrtis*, who among the three should be meditated upon and worshipped during *Anantana Vrata*? It is the third one i.e. *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*. \(*Ananta* is also the short form of *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*\)
