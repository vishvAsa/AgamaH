01 Importance of this Parva:


*Akshaya Tṛtīyā* is considered as one of the most important festivals celebrated in the month of *Vaiśākha*.

There is a reference to this *parva* in the *Bhavishya Purāṇa* where Lord *ŚrīKṛshṇa* himself has described the extraordinary greatness of this *Vrata* thus:-

> बहुनात्र किमुक्तेन किं बह्वक्षरमालया ।  
> वैशाखस्य सितामेकां तृतीयामक्षयां शृणु” ॥ 

\(Of what avail is stating with plentiful words? Just listen to the topic of the *Parva* of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā* coming in the month *vaiśākha*.\) This statement proclaims the superiority of this *parva*. This day is considered as one of the most commendable days for taking bath in the *Gaṅgā* and to worship Lord *ŚrīKṛshṇa* with *dhūpa*, *dīpa*,* Pushpa* and *Candana*. *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, the God of all gods refers to *Badari* as “My *Āśrama*” and narrates the great benefits one gets by going on a pilgrimage to *Badarī*.

गच्छोद्धव मयाऽदिष्टः बदर्याख्यं ममाश्रमम् ।  
> तत्र मत्पादतीर्थोदे स्नानोपस्पर्शनैः शुचिः ।  
> ईक्षयालकनन्दाया विधूताशेषकल्मषः । \(श्रीमद्भागवत xi-29\) 

\(O *Uddhava*, I command you to visit *Badarī* which is my *āśrama*. By bathing in my *Śrīpadatīrtha* there and doing *ācamana*, and by the contact and the sight of the water of *Alakanandā* you will be freed from all the sins.\) *Tḷrumaṅgai Āḷvar*, the best among devotees, declares—“Undertake the *Badarīyātra* before reaching the state of walking with the help of a stick with a bent back, and the state of \(keeping repeatedly\) coughing \(due to old age\). It is the doorway to salvation.” And *Akshya Tṛtīyā* is the day on which the gate of *Badarinārāyaṇa mandira*, the greatest of the pilgrimages, is opened. It can be termed alternatively as the day of opening of the doors for emancipation.

This day also happens to be the day of incarnation of *Paraśurāma,* who is referred to as *Brahmakshatra Avatāra*, and whose incarnation is the sixth among the ten *avatāras* of Lord *Vishṇu*.

The *Akshaya Tṛtīyā Parva* is praised as a great day for the worshipping of gods and also for the worshipping of the manes.

The day is also considered the first day of *Satya Yuga*, which is the first among the four *yugas*. It is also considered a good day for sowing seeds in the fields.

This *parva* is called *Akshaya Tṛtīya* because the *snāna*, *japa, tapas, adhyāyana*, *tarpaṇa* and *dāna* and other rituals performed on this day bring in inexhaustible merit to the doer. *\(Akshaya Phala Tṛtīyā\)*

\(“स्नात्वा हुत्वा च जप्त्वा च दत्त्वानन्तफलं लभेत्”\(*Vratarāja*\) The name is also well suited because it bestows on the performer *akshayamoksha*. The *Kannada* name *‘Akshatadige’,* is the vernacular form of the word *Akshaya Tṛtīya.*
