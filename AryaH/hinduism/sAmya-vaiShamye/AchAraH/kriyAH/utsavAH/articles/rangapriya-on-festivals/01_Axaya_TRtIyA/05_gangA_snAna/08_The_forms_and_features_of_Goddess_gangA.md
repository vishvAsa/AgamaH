08 The forms and features of Goddess *Gaṅgā*


*Āgamas*, history and *purāṇas* proclaim Goddess *Gaṅgā* as a river of divine knowledge, a stream of *dharma* and an embodiment of the supreme power of the Almighty. In the *dhyānaśloka* of that river, it is described that *Gaṅgā* has a unique third eye, holds a lotus, a pot and a rosary in her hands, sports *varadamudrā*, and has a crocodile as her vehicle.

> सितमकरनिषण्णां शुभ्रवर्णां त्रिनेत्राम् ।  
> करधृतकमलाक्षां कुम्भहस्तेष्टमुद्राम् ॥ 

Are these just fantasies of a poet, or can there be a form of a deity with the above said paraphernalia? This is the first question.
