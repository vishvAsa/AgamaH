02 The time of observance:


It is stated that this *parva* should be observed on *Vaiśākha śukla tṛtīyā*. What should be the extent of the *Tithi* on that day? Does it require a conjunction of *Vāra* and *nakshatra*? What is the outcome of these? Let us discuss these points in detail.

The *tṛtīyā tithi* should extend from sunrise to midday on that day.

“सा च पूर्वाह्‌णव्यापिनी ग्राह्या” It is possible that the *tṛtiyātithi* may be touching the *caturthī*. *“Gaurīvināyakopetā”*, But if the duration of the *tithi* is less than six *ghatikās* on the next day, the *Vrata-parvas* should be celebrated on the previous day itself. If it extends beyond six *ghatikās,* the *parva* should be celebrated the next day.

“त्रिमुहूर्ताधिकव्याप्तिसत्त्वे परा, त्रिमुहूर्तन्यूनत्वे पूर्वा” \(*Dharma Sindhu*\) If that day happens to be a Wednesday \(or Monday\) and if it has the conjunction with star *Rohiṇi*, it is very commendable. But, just for the sake of that conjunction, the *parva* should not be observed the previous day. \[i.e. even if such a conjunction occurs on the previous day, the *parva* should not be observed\] which means, this *Vrata* should not be observed when *Dvitīyā* and *Tṛtīyā* occur on the same day. Just as the pervasion of *Tṛtīya* in the *purvāhṇa* is prescribed, the prohibition of the observance on the day when *Tṛtīyā* has pervasion in the afternoon, is also done clearly.

> पूर्वाह्‌णे तु सदा कार्याः शुक्ले मनुयुगादयः ।  
> दैव्ये कर्मणि पित्र्ये च कृष्णे चैवापराह्‌णिकाः ॥  
> वैशाखस्य तृतीयां च पूर्वविद्धां करोति वै ।  
> हव्यं देवा न गृह्‌णन्ति कव्यं च पितरस्तथा ॥ 

\(For the observance of *Manvādi* and *Ugādi*, only the *tṛtīyā* of the *Śuklapaksha* which has pervasion in the forenoon, has to be considered. Only in the *Kṛshṇapaksha* it can be considered, if it pervades in the afternoon, both for religious rites of gods or *pitṛs*. If it is considered when it pervades in the afternoon in the *śuklapaksha*, all the worships offered will go in vain, says the *Vratarāja*.\)
