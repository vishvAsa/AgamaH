05 The modalities of the *vrata*


Those who observe the *vrata* should go on fast, worship *Śrī Nārāyaṇa* and pray him “O Lord\! I am observing this *vrata* in your *Sānnidhya*. This can be completed without hurdles, only with your blessings. In case my life departs from the body in the middle of this *vrata*, let me obtain the fruits, of the *vrata* then also with your blessings.” And, reducing the worldly activities as much as possible, one should worship Lord *Nārāyaṇa* who is delightful in the posture of sleep, with meditation, stotra and worship etc. One should follow *Brahmacarya*. One should give up *Rāga* and *dvesha*. Lies should not be uttered. Robes suitable to the *vratadīksha* should be put on. One should abstain from violence to animals. Food prohibited by scriptures and causing disturbance to the *Samyama* should not be consumed. Liquor and meat should be given up during all the four months. It is good to give up some particular food items during some months. For example, One should not use vegetables in *śrāvaṇa māsa,* curds in *bhādrapadamāsa*, milk in *āśvayuja māsa* and pulses in *kārtika māsa.* \(These are respectively called the *śākavrata, dadhivrata*, *kshīravrata* and *dhānyavrata\)*.

> श्रावणे वर्जयेच्छाकं दधि भाद्रपदे तथा ।   
> दुग्धमाश्वयुजे मासि कार्तिके द्विदलं त्यजेत् ॥ 

It is good to totally give up pulses, guava fruit and brinjal.

> द्विदलं बहुबीजं च वृन्ताकं च विवर्जयेत् ।   
> नित्यान्येतानि विप्रेन्द्र व्रतान्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ 

Similarly it is good to forego ash gourd, raddish, sugarcane, jujube fruit, fresh *Āmalaka* fruit and tamarind.\)

विशेषाद् बदरीं धात्रीं कूष्माण्डं तिन्त्रिणीं त्यजेत्॥

It can’t be called a *vrata* if someone takes a vow that he is going to give up fruits and vegetables that are not liked by him, or gives up fruits and vegetables that are not available in that season. One should give up what is prohibited by the *śāstras* and the food items which cause greater unsteadiness \(fickleness\) of the tongue. One should give up with some effort, the vegetables that are available in plenty in that season.

> तत्तत्कालोद्भवाश्शाकाः वर्जनीयाः प्रयत्नतः । 

Among vegetables, the most prohibited is brinjal. That is why the saying *“purāṇa heḷalikke badanekāyi tinnalikke”* has come up.

It is best to consume only *havishyānna* in all these four months. Sins get redeemed by this and it facilities restraint and *dhyānayoga*.

“चतुर्ष्वपीह मासेषु हविष्याशी न पापभाक् \(विष्णुधर्मोत्तर\)”

At the end of the *vrata, śrotriyas* should be invited and they should be informed of the *vrata* that has been taken up. They should be fed well and offere *Dakshiṇā*. They should be gifted with cow, land, gold and clothes etc. To the extent possible, it is better to make *Godāna*, *Vastradāna*, *Śayyādāna*, *Vastradāna*, go*dāna* and *Suvarṇamūrtidāna* to couples, corresponding to the *vratas* observed by the devotee viz., eating once a day, eating only in the night, sleeping on the ground, giving up of vegetables, giving up of curds, liquor and ghee, and the observance of *brahmacaryā*.
