+++

*Upākarma* is one of the most important *parvas* which is observed in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*. This is a very important *parva* which is observed all over India. The people of North India say—“Four very important *parvas* are observed in our country. They are *sravanī-Upākarma*, *daśaharā* \(*Navarātra, Vijayadaśamī*,\) *dīvālī* \(*dīpāvalī*\) and *Holī*. Though these four are important for all, they are especially important to brahmins, *Kshatriyas, Vaishyas* and *śūdras* respectively”. *Karmas* are of three types. They are *kāmya, nitya* and *naimittika. Kāmya karmas* are the ones which are performed only if there is a desire for something; otherwise they need not be performed. *Nitya karmas* are obligatory deeds which have to be performed every day. And the *Naimittika Karmas* are the ones which should be performed compulsorily on some particular days which are significant because of the *Tithi*, star and the planetary position of the day etc. *Upākarma* belongs to the third category. It is a *parva karma* which should performed every year on a particular day. It is a commendable auspicious *karma* related to the study of the *vedas*. Some *Maharshis* consider this as one of the eighteen *Mahāsamskāras*.

		
## Names
Names of Upākarma and the reason for using the term

This *parva* is called by many names in *Śāstras* such as *Upākarma*, *adhyāyopākarma, upākaraṇa, vedasvīkāra, vedārambhaṇa* etc., In North India it is known by the name *‘Śrāvaṇī’*, in Tamilnadu, it is called *‘Āvaṇi avittam’* In Karnataka it is called by the scriptural name *‘Upākarma’* by people who are knowledgeable in traditions. Common people call it *‘janivārada habba.’*

As it is a sacrament of initiation for the study of *vedas* and their comprehension, the names *Upākarma*, *adhyāyopākarma, upākaraṇa, vedasvīkāra*, and *vedārambhaṇa* suit the *parva*. \(उपाक्रियते अनेन इति उपाकरणं. उप \+ आ \+ कृ \+ मनिन्\) The name *Śrāvaṇī* also suits it as it is an important festival in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*. As this is a festival which is observed by *Yajurvedis* on the day when the star *Śravishṭhā* occurs in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*, tamils call it *‘Āvaṇi-Avittam’* As the wearing of a new sacred thread \(*janivāra*\) is noticed by all, the custom of calling it. *‘janivārada habba’* by common people is in vogue.

## *Adhikāris* 
\(Rightful claimants\) for *Upākarma* and rules of time for the observance

This is a *parva* which should be observed by men who belong to all *Vedaśākhās* \(branches of the *vedas*\). All those who have undergone *upanayana samskāra* are qualified to observe this. Even those who are not qualified for *upanayana*, should worship God in a special way and meditate upon him on this day, which is dear to the *Veda Purusha* \(The God of the *Vedas*\).

Some people think that *Upākarma* is important only to *Brahmacāris* and not of much importance to others. But *Dharmaśāstras* state that *Upākarma* observance is intended for all the three i.e. *Brahmacāris*, *gṛhastha*s and *Vānaprasthas*.

> अधीयीत गृहस्थोऽपि नियमाद्ब्रह्मचारिवत् \(व्यासस्मृति\) 

> उपाकर्म तथोत्सर्गं वनस्थानामपीष्यते,  
> धारणाध्ययनं कृत्वा गृहिणां ब्रह्मचारिणाम् \(देवलस्मृति\) 

*Upākarma* should not be performed in the year of the passing away of one’s father or mother. This *vrata* should not be observed in *jātāśauca* \(impurity caused by the birth of a child in the family\) or *mṛtāśauca* \(impurity because of a death in the family\). It is not auspicious to observe *Upākarma* in *malamāsa* \(intercalary month\) But some people say that *Upākarma* can be observed after performing *Śāntikarma* \(expiatory or propitiatory rites\). But the first *Upākarma* \(*pratamopākarma*\) should never be done in *Malamāsa*.

*Bṛhaspati, Śukra*, *Maṅgala* and *Budha* \(Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Mercury\) are the *adhidevatās* \(presiding deities\) for *Ṛgveda*, *Yajurveda, Sāmaveda* and *Atharvaveda* respectively. It is auspicious for the followers of respective *shākhās* to observe this *vrata* on those days when the power of the respective *grahas* is strong.

> ऋग्यजुस्सामअथर्वेशा जीवशुक्रकुजेन्दुजाः ।  
> शाखाधीशे शक्तियुक्ते तच्छाखाध्ययनं शुभम् ॥  
> गुरुर्भृगुसुतो धात्रीपुत्रः शशधरात्मजः ।  
> स्युरेते ऋग्यजुस्सामाथर्वणाधिपाः स्मृताः ॥ 

Sages state that the months of *Śrāvaṇa*, *Bhādrapada* or *Āshāḍha,* and the *tithīs Pūrṇima* and *Pañcamī*, and the stars *Śravaṇa* and *Hasta* are best suited for the observance of *Upākarma*. But different *Sūtrakāras* \(Authors of religious manuals\) have stated either different months, *tithis* and *Nakshatrās*, or the same month, *tithi* and *Nakshatrās* among these. It is best for people who belong to different *śākhas* to observe the *vrata* according to the words of their *Sūtrakāras*.

Manu has stated that *Upākarma* should be observed in the month of *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*.

श्रावण्यां प्रोष्ठपद्यां वाप्युपाकृत्य यथाविधि। युक्तश्छन्दांस्यधीयीत ।

Of the two months \(*Śrāvaṇa, Bhādrapada*\), *Śrāvaṇa* is generally considered suitable for *Ṛgvedis* and *Yajurvedis*, and *Bhādrapada* is considered suitable for *Sāmavedis* for *Upākarma*.

*Āpastamba* is of the opinion that *Upākarma* should be observed on the day of *Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima*.

श्रावण्यां पौर्णमास्यां अध्यायं उपाकृत्य

He opines that it is desirable to observe *Upākarma* on the *Pūrṇima* of *Bhādrapada*, if any blemish or inconveience is encountered in *Śrāvaṇa*. But it is important that it is observed in *Pūrṇimā tithi*.

*Āshvalāyana* states that *Upākarma* should be observed either on the day of *Śrāvaṇa nakshatra* in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*, or in *Hastā Nakshatra* occuring with *Pañcamī tithi*.

> अथाथोऽध्यायानामुपाकरणं ओषधीनां प्रादुर्भावे  
> श्रवणेन श्रावण्यां पाञ्चम्यां हस्तेन वा। 

According to *Yājnavalkya*, *Upākarma* should be observed on *Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima* with *Śrāvaṇa Nakshatra* or on *Pañcamī* with *Hasta Nakshatra*.

> अध्यायानामुपाकर्म श्रावण्याम् श्रवणेन वा।  
> हस्तेनौषधिभावे वा पाञ्चम्यां श्रावणस्य तु ॥ 

*Bodhāyana* says that *Upākarma* should be observed either on *Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima* or on *āshādha Pūrṇima*.

श्रावण्यां पूर्णमास्यां आषाढ्यां वोपाकृत्य माध्यां वा उत्सृजेत् ॥

According to sage *Gautama, Upākarma* should be observed either in the month of *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*.

श्रावणीं वार्षिकीं प्रौष्ठपदीं वोपाकृत्य

*Vasishṭha smṛti* also gives the same opinion. This *smṛti* states that *Pūrṇimā* is a must for *Upākarma*.

अथातः स्वाध्यायोपाकर्म श्रावण्यां पूर्णमास्यां प्रौष्ठपद्यां वा॥

We have to note an important matter here. The time when medicinal plants start sprouting is the most auspicious time for observing *Upākarma*.

“ओषधीनां प्राद्रुर्भावे”  
“तद्वार्षिकमित्याचक्षते” 

Sages say “ऒषधिप्रादुर्भावे”. If the medicinal plants fail to sprout in *Śrāvaṇa*, *Upākarma* should be performed in *Bhādrapada* when the medicinal plants sprout.

Those who state that *Śrāvaṇa nakshatra* is most important for *Upākarma* should note an important point. “If *Śrāvaṇa nakshatra* does not pervade for the whole day and if it is conjoined with *uttarāshāḍhā*, *Upākarma* should not be observed on that day. And,if star *Śravaṇa* is conjoined with *Dhanishṭhā*, *Upākarma* should be observed on that day”— says the *Vyāsasmrtī*.

> श्रवणेन तु यत्कर्म उत्तराषाढसंयुतम् ।  
> संवत्सरकृतोऽध्यायः तत्क्षणादेव नश्यति ॥  
> धनिष्ठासंयुतं कुर्यात् श्रावणे कर्म यद्भवेत् ।  
> तत्कर्म सफलं विद्यादुपाकरणसंज्ञितम् ॥ 

According to *Āpastamba, Upākarma* should be observed on *Pūrṇima* of *Bhādrapada* or *Āshāḍha*, if any *āsouca* occurs in *Śrāvaṇa,* or if it is a *Malamāsa*, or if any blemishes, eclipse, *Saṅkramaṇa* or the setting of the planets *Guru* and *Śukra* happen to occur in *Śrāvaṇa*. If there are any demerits or stains in all these three months, *Upākarma* should be observed in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*, according to *Vasishṭhasmṛti* and *Vyāsasmṛti*.

मासत्रयेपि दोषश्चेत् श्रावण्यामेव कारयेत्

When all the three months have some *doshas* \(blemishes\), *Upākarma* should be observed in *Śrāvaṇa* itself, after performing *śānthi karmas* with the *mantras* prescribed for *gṛahayajna*.

Now we have to evaluate one or two matters alluded to earlier.

The first is whether *Upākarma* is *nityakarma* or *naimittika karma*. “*Nityakarma* is one which has to be performed everyday” is one definition. In that sense, *Upākarma* is not a *nityakarma*. \(Because\) It is performed only on a specified day in a year. But *nityakarma* would mean duties which should be done regularly as per rules every day. “It is a *karma* that should be necessarily observed on time according to precepts. If not, it causes a demerit \(called\) *pratyavāya*”-This is another definition of *Nityakarma*. From this point of view, *Upākarma* becomes a *Nityakarma* only. The analysis provided by *Mārkandeya Purāṇa* in this regard may be noted here.

> नित्यं नैमित्तिकं चैव नित्यनैमित्तिकं तथा ।  
> गृहस्थस्य त्रिधा कर्म तन्निशामय पुत्रक ॥ 

> पाञ्चयज्ञाश्रितं नित्यं यदेतत्कथितं तव।  
> नैमित्तिकं तथा चान्यत् पुत्रजन्मक्रियादिकम् ॥  
> नित्यं नैमित्तिकं ज्ञेयं पर्वश्राद्धादि पण्डितैः । 

\(A *gṛhastha* \(householder\) must necessarily perform three duties namely *nitya, naimittika* and *nityanaimittika karmas*. *Nityakarmas* are those which are performed based on the *pañcamahāyajnas*. When a male child is born in the family, *Jātakarma* \(A ceremony at the birth of a child\) is to be done. For this reason it comes under *naimittika karma. Karmas* such as performing a *śrāddha* to please the *pitṛs* which are performed on specific *parvas* come under *nityanaimittika karmas*. It comes under *Naimittika* as it is performed due to the death of a relative. It also comes under *nityakarma* as it is enjoined on every *parva* such as *amāvāsya*, *saṅkramaṇa* and *grahaṇa*. From this point of view, *Upākarma* is also a *Nityakarma* as it has to be observed by all the *dvijas* \(twice born\), on the day of the occurrence of *Śrāvaṇa \(Bhādrapada Āshāḍha\), Pūrṇima, Śravaṇanakshatra, Hastanakshatra* etc., as per precepts.

The second matter: On what days *Upākarma* is prohibited? The *Śāstras* say that it should not be performed on those days which have blemishes such as *Āsauca, Malamāsa*, eclipse, non-appearance of *guru* or *śukra* etc. And, it should be observed on a day which is free from these blemishes.

		
> मलमासे निपतिते सूतके मृतकेऽपि वा ।  
> ग्रहणे सङ्क्रमे वोपि मौढ्ये च गुरुशुक्रयोः ॥  
> प्रौष्ठपद्यामथाषाढ्यामुपाकरणमिष्यते  
\(वसिष्ठस्मृति, वैद्यनाथीय वर्णाश्रमाचारकाण्ड\) 

> प्रायश्चित्तं तु सर्वस्य मलमासे विवर्जयेत् ।  
> उपाकर्मोत्सर्जनं च पवित्रदमनार्पणम्॥ 

“In spite of all these, *Upākarma* is a *nityakarma* like *sandhyāvandana*. Therefore it should be observed even if it comes in a *malamāsa*. Only the *prathama Upākarma* should not be done in *malamāsa*. Instead, it should be done in *śuddhamāsa*.” — With this explanation some perform the yearly *Upākarma* even if it occurs in a *malamāsa*. Which of these two opinions is right? When there is a provision, it is best to perform it in a month other than a *malamāsa*. If another auspicious day is not available, only then it should be done in *malamāsa*.

> सावकाशं तु यत्कर्म न कुर्यान्मासि दूषिते ।  
> कुर्यान्निरवकाशं तु नित्यं नैमित्तिकं तथा॥ 

Third question: Can *Upākarma* be performed in the year of the death of any of the parents when the *ābdikas* are yet to be completed?

*Śāstras* say—“The body of the *Karta* \(the one who has performed the obsequies of the parents\) is said to be impure till the year end rites are completed. So, excepting the *māsikas* \(monthly rites\) no other *karmas* such as *pitṛkarmas* or *devatākarmas* should be performed.”

> प्रमीतौ पितरौ यस्य देहस्तस्याशुचिर्भवेत् ।  
> न दैवं नापि पित्र्यं वा यावत्पूर्णो न वत्सरः ॥ \(धर्मसिन्धु page 964\) 

As *Upākarma* is both a *daiva* \(divine\) and an *Ārshakarma* \(pertaining to the sages\), it should not be performed according to the above statement, in the year of death of father or mother. Also, *Hemādrismṛtimīmāmsā* clearly states that *Upākarma* is included in the list of *karmas* prohibited from being observed till the *Ābdika* ceremony is over. This statement is quoted by the texts of religious codes and commentary viz.,-*vaidyanāthīya Varṇāśramācāra kānḍa* \(p. 219\), *Nirṇayasindhu* \(III 4791\) and *Dharmasindhu* P. 961\)

> स्न्नानं चैव महादानं स्वाध्यायं चाग्नितर्पणम् ।  
> प्रथमेऽब्दे न कुर्वीत महागुरुनिपातने ॥ 

\(Performing of *Snātakakarma, Mahādāna, Svādhyāya* and especially *Agnipūja* and even *Tarpaṇa* should not be done \(by a person\) when \(either of his\) parents has passed away, till the *Ābdika* \(ceremony\) is completed.\)

According to this, the aforesaid persons who are in the *pitṛdīkshā* do not perform *Upākarma* till the *Ābdika* is over. But there is a custom practiced by some, who perform the regular *Upākarma* even before the *Ābdika* is over. They defend their practice in the following way.

a\) The word *svādhyāya* referred to in the above *śloka* does not mean *Upākarma*. It means *upanayana* \(thread ceremony\) \(“स्वाध्यायः” उपनयनं तदर्थत्वात् उपनयनस्य\). Therefore only *upanayana* is prohibited and not *Upākarma*.

b\) If *sapinḍīkaraṇa* is scheduled to be performed at the end of the year, *Upākarma* is prohibited as per the above *śloka*. But if *sapinḍīkaraṇa* is done earlier then the performer’s body does not remain *aśuci*. Therefore *Upākarma* can be performed before the *Ābdika.*

But there is no statement or indication in the above *śloka* that *Upākarma* is prohibited only for persons who perform *sapinḍikaraṇa* at the end of the year.

“*Upākarma* can be observed or dropped as per one’s family custom”— This is one of the solutions to be above problem.

“Those who have the strength of mind and feel that they are not impure as they have performed *sapinḍīkarṇa* earlier can observe *Upākarma*. But those who feel in their hearts that they are mentally and spiritually in *pitṛdikshā* during the entire year, and so have no right to perform the auspicious ritual of *Upākarma* which is both *daiva* \(related to gods\) and *Ārsha* \(related to sages\)”—This is also considered as the suitable solution to the problem.

Also, points like why *Upākarma* should be performed, what is the benefit from it and what one stands to lose if it is not performed should also be discussed.

“The first *Upākarma* which comes after the *upanayana* is called *prathamopakarma*. *Brahmacāris* acquire the right to do *brahmayajna* only after performing *prathamopākarma*. “After that, by the observance of *Upākarma* by them every year, their *vedādhyayana* gets refreshed. The newness which causes prosperity is obtained by that. The study of the *vedas* which has become stale, gets renewed” - say the *śāstras*.

> प्रत्यब्दं यदुपाकर्म सोत्सर्गं विधिवध् द्विजैः ।  
> क्रियते छन्दसां तेन पुनराप्यायनं परम् ॥ \(कात्यायन\) 

> अयातयामैश्छंदोभिः यत्कर्म क्रियते द्विजैः ।  
> क्रीडमानैरपि सदा तत्तेषां वृद्धिकारणम् ॥  
\(वैद्यनाथीय, वर्णाश्रमाचारकाड page 53\) 

The abovesaid benefit will not accrue to one who does not observe *Upkārma*.
