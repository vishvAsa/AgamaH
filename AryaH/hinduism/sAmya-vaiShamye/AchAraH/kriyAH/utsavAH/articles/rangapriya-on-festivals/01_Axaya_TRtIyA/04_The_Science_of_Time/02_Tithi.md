**b\) *Tithi***: The *tithi* of this *parva*, viz. *tṛtīyā* is called *‘Jayātithi’*. And that too, the *Jayātithi* of *Śukla Paksha* is very auspicious.

The name *Jayā* indicates that it is the precious time for success, ie the securing of the accomplishment of the endeavours taken up with auspicious intentions.

We have also heard that *tṛtīyā* conjoined with *caturthī tithi* is highly auspicious for this festival. *‘Gaurī Vināyakopetā’*. *Tṛtīyā* is considered to be the *tithi* of goddess *Gauri* who bestows auspiciousness for all living beings, and *caturthī* as the *tithi* of Lord *Gaṇeśa*, the remover of all obstacles. “चतुर्थीगणनाथस्य” गौर्याः तत्पूर्ववासरे” \(Agnipurāṇa\)

The union of these two *tithis* which is dear to these gods \(i.e. Goddess *Gauri* and Lord *Gaṇeśa*\) is indeed \(a time\) which cherishes the removal of obstacles and the accomplishment of auspiciousness, brought about by the tranquility of the said time.

The main reason for laying down that the *tṛtīyā tithi* should extend till noon is because *śuklapaksha* is dear to gods. As it is the domain of the gods, they desire the forenoon only for their worship. Also, in the duration of the day, the forenoon is dear to gods and the afternoon to the *pitṛs*. If any worship is offered in the afternoon of a *śuklapaksha,* it enters the sway of the *pitṛs* typically. So the *śāstras* stipulate only such a *tithi* which has a forenoon pervasion, and as the bright half of a month belongs to the gods, it is commended for worships and rituals.
