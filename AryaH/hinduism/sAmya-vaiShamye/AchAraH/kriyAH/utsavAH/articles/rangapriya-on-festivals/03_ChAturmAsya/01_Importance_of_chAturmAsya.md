01 Importance of *cāturmāsya*


Though the name *cāturmāsya* is familiar to many of us in the row of *vratas*, there is an impression that it is related to monks and some *Maḍi hengasaru* \(some women in the olden days who were very orthodox\) and people belonging to the other *Āśramas* need not consider it. This is a result of misunderstanding. From the view point of *śāstras* this is a *parva* that should be observed by everyone. This does not belong either to the category called *naimittika karma*, a rite which should be performed because of a *nimitta;* Or a *kāmya karma* a rite which is performed only for the fulfillment of a specific desire, which need not be observed otherwise. It happens to be a *nitya karma* only, as it belongs to a category in which certain rituals are mandatory at some distinct times, and the blemish of sinfulness may occur if they are not observed. There is no doubt that it must be specially observed by *sanyāsis*. But the *śāstras* say that is the duty of all i.e. people belonging to all *Āśramas,* to observe it to the extent possible.

> चत्वार्येतानि नित्यानि चतुराश्रमवर्णिनाम् ।   
> नित्यान्येतानि विप्रेन्द्र व्रतान्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ \(स्कान्दपुराण\) 

The *Mahābhārata* proclaims that if this *vrata* is not observed, one will be stuck with the sins of the whole year.

> वार्षिकांश्चतुरो मासान् वाहयेत् केनचिन्नरः ।   
> व्रतेन नोचेदाप्नोति किल्बिषं वत्सरोद्भवम् ॥
