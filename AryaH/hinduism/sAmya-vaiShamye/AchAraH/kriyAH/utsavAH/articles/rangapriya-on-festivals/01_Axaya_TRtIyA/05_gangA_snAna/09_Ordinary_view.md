Answers coming from an ordinary vision

When viewed ordinarily, these appear to be the forms imagined by a poet. “As *Gaṅgā* is in the form of a river, a water filled pot is placed in her hand. The small quantity of water that can be filled in the *kalaśa*, later expands and flows as a great river.

“The term *tīrtha* also means *āgama* or *vidyā* \(निपानागमयोस्तीर्थं\). To suggest that the garland of letters i.e. the alphabet is the mother of all learning, the poet has presented an *akshamāla* \(rosary\) in one of her hands.

		
“As the lotus is the best of flowers born in water, a beautiful lotus has been placed in the hand of the goddess of holy water. The waves of the river are her hands. The shining fish are the many eyes of the goddess. As she is a great sustainer of the livelihood of people, she is fancied as one who sports the right hand in the blessing posture. As crocodiles abound in the river, a crocodile has been shown as her vehicle.”—Such answers come to the minds of the sentimental people.
