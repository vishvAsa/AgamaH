title: +Decoration

Hindu-s often decorate their foreheads and other parts of their body - or for that matter, their homes. What does it mean?

- Certain decorative marks and substances are closely associated with deities.
    - The deva-s, in their embodied forms, as conceived by Hindu-s, favor certain decorations on their body (especially on the forehead). The reasons behind this (when specified or theorized) could be aesthetic or mythological.
    - For example, Shiva favors horizontally applied ash, Vishnu is thought of as favoring the tilaka or the urdhva-puNDra - multi-hued vertical lines.
    - Eg. In [श्रीकृष्णकर्णामृतम्](http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_vishhnu/kkarna.html?lang=sa) - "कस्तूरीतिलकं ललाटफलके, वक्षस्स्थले कौस्तुभं, नासाग्रे नवमौक्तिकं करतले वेणुं करे कङ्कणं। सर्वाङ्गे हरिचन्दनञ्च कलयं कण्ठे च मुक्तावलीं , गोपस्त्रीपरिवेष्टितो विजयते गोपालचूडामणिः॥"
    - Certain substances (red kunkuma powder, turmeric, sandal paste, ash, flowers etc..) are used in performing pUja-rituals for the deities.
- The devotees of these deva-s apply similar decorations. Women simply tend to wear a red dot.
  - Particular rituals and incantations, which serve to reinforce such meaning and feeling, are associated with applying these decorations.

## Reasons at an individual level
- They dedicate themselves to (the service of/ protection from) these deities (and through them to the broader pantheon) by applying similar decorations on their body.
- Various components of these marks may serve as a reminder of particular philosophical concepts (eg.: the three bonds in case of a [tripUNDra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripundra)), associated deities (eg: red parts in the Urdhva-puNDra indicating laxmI) and mythology.
- Devotees may be thought of as offering up their bodies as temples to these deva-s, so that they may receive divine inspiration in their thoughts and actions. For this reason, they maintain ritual purity, eat suitable (sAttivka) food offered to the deity, perform yogic exercise etc..

## Communal allegiance reasons
- These decorations signify their pride in associating with the related traditions (sampradAya-s) or even the entire hindu culture.
- Most of these decorations have nothing to do with caste, though orthodox brAhmaNa-s tend to be more particular about them.
