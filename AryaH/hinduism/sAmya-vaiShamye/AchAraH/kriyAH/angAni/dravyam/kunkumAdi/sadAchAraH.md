### शास्त्र-निषेधः
> असंस्कृतां हरिद्रां यो मुखे लिम्पन् नराधमः।  
> तन्मुखं न निरीक्षेत चण्डालम् इव न स्पृशेत्॥

कथं स्ंस्कारः?

> कुङ्कुमं चन्दनं चैव करूप्रञ्चानुलेपनम्।  
> विष्णुगात्रपरामृष्टं तद्वै पावनपवनम्॥

### Color traditions
> Many of the parakala matha sishyas use red even now. That said, in the 1990s, I have seen tenkalais wearing yellow srichurnam. The numbers have reduced now but I do see a few of them even now sometimes. I don't consider red = tk and yellow = vk as valid.

> In spite of 150 year old pramANas for the use of turmeric based shrIchUrNam, many vadakalai shishthas of the previous generation (1950-2020) still wore red shrIchUrNam. My own family was wearing red until some 30-35 years ago and switched to yellow. Back them my mother would say that "vaidIkas wear yellow and laukIkas wear red".
>
> I myself know of a TK Vaikhanasa priest who wears yellow and Mahamahopadhyaya Srivatsankachariar Swamy has talked about a TK shishtha who only wore yellow. 
> - विजयः ताताचार्यः



## तिरुमण्
> In fact, I would go to the extent of saying that Y = Tk and U = vk itself is a later development (maybe 250 yrs or so). Prior to that, both options were there and neither was wedded to one particular school of thought. You can see both types of tiruman in the temples of Hampi - even from the 14th century (like Hazara Rama). - रविलोचनः
