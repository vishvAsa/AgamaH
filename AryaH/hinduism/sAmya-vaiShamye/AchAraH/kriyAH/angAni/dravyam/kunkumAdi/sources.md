Beware store-bought colors. 

Eg. [2016 yellow shrIchUrNam lead poisoning](../articles/shrIchUrNam-kunkumam-lead/)

## White source
The white clay that we purchase from the shops or from temples nearby comes majorly from tirunArAyaNapuram, tiruvahIndrapuram, ayodhyA and few other divya kshterams where this white clay is found.

## Yellow procedure
- Make in small batches. (Else harder to dry, fungus growth.)
- Directly use turmeric powder
- Optional additives to improve consistency
  - 5-10% thirumaN
  - Rice flour
- Classic procedure [here](../articles/diy-shrIchUrNam/).

### tirumaN/ chandana + turmeric
> I do archanA to mahAlakShmI using turmeric. Separately I collect the sandalwood paste that is offered daily to the Lord and keep it aside. I mix both of them together in 50-50 ratio and usually this is good enough to get the consistency for application. Sometimes I add a little bit of thirumaN to get the right texture.

### Maroon
> our home made one is deep red and good fragrance with pachai karpooram. ... In fact to get maroon red they add a flower called thaazham poo. If you look into the YouTube video, that Matushri adds a Ennai Vengaram to get the maroon colour.
