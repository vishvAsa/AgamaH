<details><summary>Ravilo's assessment (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

Has some anti Brahmin (anti UC) tendency (despite himself being an UC - nair) but far better than most others. Also acknowledges that the Dravidianist nonsense against broms is not fair. He doesn't like Hindutva politics. But at the same time, he is opposed to missionaries and Islamists as well. So a mixed bag.
